8356098,1,B0028ERCA2,complete crap! The only part of the race that is visible is the last lap. Best lap of the race but I didn't spend hard earned cash to watch one lap. Would NOT reccomend buying any of these.  2001 July Daytona race won't even load. This company should be thrown in jail,1423785600,,268,4.153846153846154
8356099,5,B0028ERCA2,"This video shows the best finish in Nascar history. Kurt Bush and Ricky Craven fighting it out at the end.
The announcers were totally shocked by the fantastic finish.
If you are interested in NASCAR and enjoy their races this is a must for your collection.
Enjoy it if you buy it.",1398643200,,281,4.423076923076923
