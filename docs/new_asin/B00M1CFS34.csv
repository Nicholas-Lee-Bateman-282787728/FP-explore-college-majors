6546640,5,B00M1CFS34,"GREAT collection!
I'm 67; I remember ROCKY & BULLWINKLE. I, fondly, enjoyed these---91 timeless---segments, that
were excerpted from my childhood memories. Due to my Strawberry Alarm Clock; Electric Prunes;
Mobey Grape; Vanilla Fudge; Jimi Hendrix... and Vietnam, I hadn't seen ANY of these until TODAY.
I bought a bigger Blu-ray [empty] case, and put these in the same case as the recent BLU-RAY movie
of the same name.
While the M-O-V-I-E did feature President Clinton, and was/is more timely, I felt that the ORIGINAL
cartoons were/is more entertaining: THEY succeeded in pulling a [White]Rabbit from my Jefferson-
ian hat... in a Rocky Mountain sorta way. Took ME waaaaay back...",1461888000,,683,5.275229357798165

6546679,4,B00M1CFS34,"I wish they would have taken time to restore the episodes better. The picture quality and color is not consistent from episode to episode. Though, even on the worst looking ones, it's not terrible for being over 50 years old. Previously released DVDs were ""The Best of Mr. Peabody & Sherman - Volume 1"" released in 2012 that contained only 15 episodes, and then ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman WABAC Adventures - Volume 1"" and ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman WABAC Adventures - Volume 2"", both released in 2014 and only containing 10 episodes on each. This two disc DVD collection is the first to contain all 91 Peabody and Sherman episodes, originally called ""Peabody's Improbable History"" when it appeared on Rocky and His Friends and The Bullwinkle Show from 1959 to 1964, and then were re-run on TV as part of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show for years after.

6546685,4,B00M1CFS34,"When I was a kid my father once told my mother ""You've got to see this Mom!  It's not for kids.""  This was my late father telling the household that Rocky and Bullwinkle and all their friends were ready to make you laugh and take some pun--ishment.  Years later on I really missed that brand of humor and the genteel way of presenting it.  Mr. Peabody & Sherman served up some neat little tales that were sort of a ""Reader's Digest"" version of Rocky and Bullwinkle's stories!  And Gee!  Didn't every kid want a Time Machine??  Or have a Dog for a Master??  OK... Maybe not a real dog.  But a person who would make life endlessly interesting for them -- even if they didn't ""get it"" at first!  It is interesting that the opening of the new movie made in their honor should reflect almost word for word the first episode in that wonderful collection of 90+ episodes available!  Don't expect the artwork to be 21st Century by any means, but it is all about the story telling, isn't it?  ""Come along Sherman; today you get to drive.""
Today's kids might even be hip to the puns being handed out, and might also wonder where the colorist went when he should have been kept very busy.  If you have already taken the kids out to see the very well done movie with no end of wit  (As Mr. Peabody and Sherman are ejected from the rear end of the Sphinx, Peabody says: ""I guess we were the butt of that joke!""), and show that they may be ready for more  of the same sort of fun, than this reasonably priced collection will be a good value for the whole family.",1418256000,16,1548,4.2714776632302405

Once I received it however, I found that while it lists a full 91 episodes, sadly, mine only held 21.  They sure are great shows though.  I'm enjoying every bit of it.

I was informed (thank you for the communication) that there is indeed 91 excellent episodes.  I did not realize at the time that our tv was set on the big zoom.  Once I was able to downsize the picture I found the 'next' button which takes you into the next set of stories and so on.  Thanks again for letting me know that there was so much more to be offered.
