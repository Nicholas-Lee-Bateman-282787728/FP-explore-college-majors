8328792,4,B001O17SXQ,"I liked this film but it wasn't as immaculate as some of Deepa Mehta's other films. It is certainly worth watching and has some interesting concepts which are very ""Deepa Mehta"" but it wasn't Water by any means. If you are a Deepa Mehta film as I am I think it is worth watching.",1411257600,,279,4.185185185185185
8328793,5,B001O17SXQ,"Videsh, or Heaven on Earth, has recieved very little recognition by cinema-goers, which is a shame since it is a truely touching story. I think it recieved little importance because it deals with an issue that is very real, and still exists today, not only in India but all over the world. And because this movie is realistic this may be the cause of it not making a huge impact on Indian cinema like a Kal Ho Naa Ho would (I love that movie too!), since movies act as a form of escape for many people.

In Deepa Mehta's story we meet Chand (Preity Zinta) who lives in the Punjab region of India, and is preparing for her wedding, an arranged marriage with a $20,000 dowry. The following morning her mother wakes her up to give her advice about her upcoming nuptials. She reminds Chand the story of the priest and cobra, and how not to bite when a hiss is sufficent warning. She says that strength is not necessarily in physical action, but can also be in a quiet warning. She tells Chand to be careful with her in-laws, which turns into a foreshadowing of events...

Chand is then placed on a plane to head to Canada where her husband-to-be, Rocky, and his family live (parents, brother, his wife, and their two children). The poor girl doesn't even have time to sit down in her new environment before her mother-in-law tells her to get Rocky and her other son some drinks. The next day is Chand's wedding and Rocky takes her to Niagra Falls for their honeymoon. At the hotel Chand asks if she can call home and speak to her mother, but Rocky says she can do it tomorrow, her face drops and we can see how much she misses her mother. On their first night togher Rocky's own mother shows up claiming she had a dream that he died, and she wanted to check on him. She offers to leave after seeing he is good and alive, but Rocky insists she can stay the night with them because she is still so upset. Chand makes a suggestion that maybe they should book another room for themselves (I mean it is their honeymoon). Rocky stares at her and slaps her across the face, adding that no one asked for her opinion. Rocky ends up sleeping in the car and leaves Chand and his mother in the hotel room. Chand is in tears as her mother in-law asks her to massage her legs, and she mentions that sometimes these things happen (refering to Chand being hit).

Chand is made to work in a hotel, washing the dirty towels with her sister in-law. When she asks the manager when she gets paid, he tells her that all her money will be given to Rocky directly as per his instructions, now, Chand is an educated woman and we can see on her face that she doesn't feel right about this. We meet Rosa who also works in the hotel, and she notices Chand's bruises. She gives a ""magical"" root that she says will make Rocky fall in love with her when she mixes it in one of his drinks. So she tries but as she is mixing it in the drink begins to bubble and get hot. Chand rushes it outside and throws it on the ground, as she is walking away we can see a cobra emerge from the steam...

Word gets around that there is a cobra in the neighborhood, which none of Chand's family believes since cobras can't live through a Canadian winter. As this is going on Chand continues to try to reach home, and is unable too, and she continues to be hit by Rocky as her in-laws silently watch. One day she thinks she sees the cobra on her bed, but when she turns around it is Rocky standing behind her. He is kinder and more gentler to her than he has ever been and she begins to think things have changed. But the following day he is cruel to her and she is confused by his mood swings. What she doesn't realize is that the kind Rocky she thinks she talked to is really not him, but just a figment (and really the cobra). This confusion continues until Rocky believes she has had an affair with another man while being in Canada (which isn't plausable since she doesn't know her way around, and is always with the family). She denies it, but he tells her she must prove her innocence. So she decides that she will reach into the cobra pit (that's in their backyard...think back to the bubbling drink)and take out the snake. Legend has it that if the snake bites her that proves she is guilty, but if it doesn't it proves her innocence... I won't ruin the ending!

Psychologically this movie is fascinating. Though many may think she is just losing her mind by seeing a kind husband, I think it is more of a coping mechanism to get her through her situation. She imagines the husband she wants but isn't able to have and that is what gets her through the day. I also think the stories she whispers to herself are another form of coping. Many of them have to do with her mother, which shows the importance she places on her mom. I'm still trying to figure out the back and forth between color and black & white episodes. Now to Rocky and his abuse. For him it seems that hitting Chand is also coping mechanism. He is the sole bread winner of the family, and at that he doesn't make that much, then his family decides to add another mouth to feed by bringing Chand around. Since he can't take his frustration out on his other family memebers, Chand becomes the only available source. And why doesn't his family step in to stop his abuse? Probably because he is the only bread winner, and to stop him would then bring attention to themselves and he might kick them out and leave them on their own. This movie is not only about the domestic violence protrayal but of immigration in general. We see Chand struggle with adjusting to Canada, there are certain phrases she uses that her sister in-law tells her not to because they aren't in India anymore. We also she her struggle through her desparate desire to talk to her family, she also tells her brother not to come to Canada, that it isn't a good place.

Before watching this movie it is also important to look up the plot of the play Nagamandala, which is kind of the foundation of Videsh. It's also important to know that in Hindu mythology, serpents (naga) are like shape shifters, and can take on human form, which is why we see in one instance the cobra, followed by Rocky. Nagas are also protectors of treasure and the cobra/Rocky character acts as a protector of Chand (who would be the treasure) by showing gentleness and kindness to her. It's important also to understand the element of fantasy in this movie, especially concerning the cobra. Yes, it is unlikely a cobra would be hanging around Canada, but that isn't the point of the movie. The cobra is just the vehicle Mehta uses to get her story across. And not matter what if you stick your hand in a snake pit, you probably won't come out with a hand no matter if your innocent or guilty, but again it is just a metaphor Mehta uses to shoe Chand's strength.

Preity Zinta did an outstanding job portraying Chand. Whereas Preity is known for her outspoken opinions and her outer strength, we see in Chand more of a quiet strength that is not expressed outwardly until the moment arises (watch the end!), and Preity carries this off gracefully and flawlessly. By far this is one of her best performances. Watch this movie because it carries an important and all to realistic message.",1377993600,,7250,4.373887240356083
8328794,4,B001O17SXQ,"Videsh (Heaven on Earth) is a perfect movie. Like all the other Deepa Mehta movies I've seen (Earth, Fire, Water), it's one of the best of movies.

The DVD comes with four audio tracks, two in Hindi and two in Punjabi (5.1 Dolby Digital and Stereo), all on one disk.

There is beautiful background music in the Hindi version that isn't present in the Punjabi version. The background music is subtitled.

All of the subtitles are easy to read.

A major disappointment is the presence of a colorful LOGO on every frame of the movie after the first half-minute or so of the movie. The logo is an ongoing distraction and simply shouldn't be there.

Videsh is definitely a treasure.",1334793600,,677,4.608333333333333
