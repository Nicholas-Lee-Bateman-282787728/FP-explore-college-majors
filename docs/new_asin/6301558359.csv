I'm buying a copy for me and a friend. I  *loved* this movie. Preston is a wonderful actor and I still remember the  wonderful ""burn the pine cones"" scene at the end of the movie,  not to mention the many other memorable scenes throughout.

I believe the characters, I believe the story.  Then again, when it is two superb craftsmen as Mary Tyler Moore and Robert Preston, it is quite easy.  Incredible nuance in both of their performances, never a false note.

And Sam Waterston is a hoot!!!  My wife and I are Law & Order addicts and to see him in this role was hysterical.",1202688000,2,427,4.0843373493975905
339968,5,6301558359,"This movie was released in 1985 direct to cable TV on HBO.

Romantic-Drama. It's really not a comedy. There are some humorous moments, just as in real life, but the overall tone of the movie is serious.

This movie does not have an MPAA rating.  I would rate it as PG-13 because of mild violence, adult content and adult dialog.

Mike Finnegan (Robert Preston) is a newspaperman. When he turned 65 and was forced to retire, the Managing Editor kept him on to write the lonely-hearts column as ""Felicity Hope."" Mike is not a good fit for the job. His replies are filled with bitterness and morality, which is causing a drastic drop in the number of letters received.  His attitude may be because of his own marital situation. His wife, Margaret (Silvia Sydney), is 75 years old and suffers from senile dementia. Despite his personal troubles, he's always a public symbol of cheer when he takes the bus to and from work every day. He greets everyone who boards with a smile and a compliment.

Liz DeHaan (Mary Tyler Moore) is a teacher in her mid-forties. She's widowed and having an affair with a married man, Paul Broadbent (Sam Waterston). Liz keeps up hope that Paul will eventually leave his wife, so she continues to meet him once a week in a run-down apartment on the bad side of town. She takes the bus to their rendezvous so their cars won't be seen together on the street.

On the bus is where Mike and Liz meet. Mike notices Liz is troubled and, because he is an observant newspaperman, deduces this is caused by her present relationship. When he tries to help her by explaining what he has determined by observing her, he actually scares her because he is 100% correct and she thinks that what he knows may cause trouble for her and Paul.  Mike allays her fear by confiding some of his own history that relates to her present situation, which also explains why he hasn't left his wife and why he isn't such a good fit as the newspaper's advice columnist.

So now Liz and Mike are friends, although Mike is not quite sure what to make of it all. Liz likes him because what he tells her is what she tells herself. She easily denies the truth when it's herself talking, but she listens when Mike says it. She doesn't understand why; maybe it's because he's completely blunt about it. Whatever it is, she likes it.

A distressing situation occurs and their friendship deepens, but neither of them notices because of their other troubled relationships. Eventually the strength of their friendship is tested.

Watch this movie to see how it all turns out.  You won't regret it.

This movie is an A+ across the board.

Story: A+

The character development is excellent, true-to-life and very believable. The dialog is also real and believable. There's nothing corny or glamorous here. No hidden messages.  No sugar sweetening.

Acting: A+

How can it be anything but A+ from this cast?

Robert Preston was one of this country's most under-appreciated performers. He was much more than just The Music Man. Sure, when you see him strut down the street with the boom box guy, you might think Harold Hill, and that's okay. It put a smile on my face.&#9786; He always covers all of the emotions with perfection. With Mike, he gets the chance to cover everything; happy, sad, love, pain.

Mary Tyler Moore is just plain perfect, as usual. She takes Liz from being completely tangled up in her affair that she can't see how wrong it is, then is confused yet intrigued by this strange but honest and concerned man until finally she's able to break free from her troubles.

Sam Waterston surprised me. He's very comical here and I'd never seen him in this type of role. He fits it well and he's very believable and actually makes me like Paul even though Paul is a louse.

Another part of why the main cast works is that their real ages are close to their character's ages. They look the part; they act the part.

Direction: A+

Another great job from Joan Micklin Silver.  Full of emotions, evenly flowed.

Visuals: A+

Again, very real and nothing fancy. You don't feel like you're watching this story through a camera.

Great quotes:

""If only flesh and spirit could grow at the same pace.""

""I did your ironing.""

339969,5,6301558359,"What a nice story!  Truly one of those that you'll watch more than once.  The evolution by Mary Tyler Moore's character with a rather ""make-do"" romance with Sam Waterston's character, a scheduled ""weekly appointment"", bland romance affair, to liking and truly gently loving an older, warmer, tender, and dry sense of humor Robert Preston character, is so delightful!!  There are many funny scenes such as Mary and Sam in that muddy grave, and Robert Preston announcing in an awkward moment that ""I did your ironing"".  So Finnigan learns to write his advice column with new vigor and finds true love too.  The kind of fluffy story that romantics love, like me!  We bought this video because we're collecting Sam Waterston movies.  We think he's always excellent in his roles, and this one fits the bill again.  Mary is the main character, and she's delightful and the attractive widow who found comfy love.  Ah-h-h-h!!",1019347200,15,917,4.9411764705882355
339970,5,6301558359,"I saw this movie when it first came out and ran on cable TV. I went out of my way staying up late to see it as many times as it ran. Robert Preston and Mary Tyler Moore are both wonderful in their roles. Though I love the Music Man, I have to say this is my favorite Preston role. I loved this movie when I was 22 and love it more at 38. It means even more now that I'm married and have children. ""Love isn't what you feel, it is what you do for each other.""

339972,5,6301558359,"I've been a Robert Preston fan for years, but this film really gives him an opportunity to show the breadth of his talent. Most of the others I've seen cast him into one particular 'type' or another (such as a con-man),  but in ""Finnegan Begin Again"" he shows his capabilities: humour,  satire, pathos, comedy.. Mary Tyler Moore, no slouch herself, also plays a  'real person' with exquisite verisimilitude. I first spotted this on a  video-store shelf and thought the combination might be good; my  expectations were wildly exceeded: the combo is *great!*  I bought a copy  as soon as I could locate one for sale.  There are some adult themes that I  think keep this from being full-family fare, but perhaps PG-13 would be the  most appropriate rating.",957916800,5,753,4.8125
7813116,5,6301558359,"This really is not a comedy however there are some very amusing scenes. However I like the ratiocination scenes best. And when at the funeral, Paul Broadbent (Sam Waterston) suggests that Finnegan move out of Liz's place; he gets pushed in the grave. This is about people, affairs, and aging. And many other people issues.
In the process of this movie you can see how much better the actors have improved over the years and play fuller characters than in most of their previous movies. This is one of those movies that you watch over at first to get the parts that were missed. Then over again just for the feel.",1500940800,,612,4.5225225225225225

first watched it. MTM and Preston are wonderful together and make a great comedy team but it also has a serious side at times and
makes the movie even better. This is so much better than any romantic comedy they could make today. My favorite part is Preston on
the bus with MTM sitting next to him but they haven't met yet and he's talking to a pimp! one of the best funniest movie scenes ever!

7813121,3,6301558359,"The story is wonderful.  You know it's good when you see it once and remember it for decades.  Robert Preston and Mary Tyler Moore give two outstanding performances, as does Sam Waterston appearing in a light turn on the heals of The Killing Fields.  The MTM line at the end (I apologize for paraphrasing and hope my memory hasn't mangled it too much) asking RP about trading 10 indifferent years for three or four good ones really hit home when I first saw it.  And RP telling one child he's a ""sweet boy"" while another posts a sign on his back that reads ""this old mother for sale cheap""...hilarious.  And I agree with those who call for a DVD version.  This is such a sweet story, with top notch dialogue and acting.  It deserves to live on a bit longer.

So why only three stars?  The quality of the physical tape and video were both not great, but on par for a TV movie that has sat around for several decades.  Got a few viewings out of it before it stopped playing.  I do wish it had held up longer, but that's to be expected.  Can't really fault anyone.  Technology marches on...",1449878400,,1087,4.321782178217822
7813122,5,6301558359,"This is one of my favorite movies, ever since I first watched it on HBO decades ago.  It is a movie you can watch with just about anyone and not worry about offending.  Robert Preston plays a former investigative reporter whose career has entered the doldrums as he reaches retirement age.  He takes over a column with advice to the lovelorn, but his advice is basically for them to snap out of it and stay with their spouses.  The truth is not romantic, though, and the incoming letters dwindle.

He meets Mary Tyler Moore's character and in a way, becomes one of those lovelorn persons himself, which allows him to be more gentle in his advice.  That is just one part of the plot, however, mostly the story revolves around these two characters as they get to know each other and help each other bring their respective messy lives in order.

The movie is an intelligent romantic comedy, both funny and romantic, with interesting lesser characters especially featuring a superb performance by the actress who plays Preston's ailing wife.

I recorded this on VHS back when it ran, and hung onto it because I liked it, and then transferred it to DVD when I embraced that technology.  The picture quality isn't great, but now that I see it was never released on DVD I am glad to have it.  The reviews of the VHS quality sold here are not very favorable.  But do watch it if you haven't already, and watch it again if you have seen it..",1444435200,,1432,4.511627906976744
