2230252,4,B0007PALX4,"La Nina De La Mochila Azul(1979, The Girl With the Blue Backpack) is a solid, family-friendly Mexican film from the late 1970's. It stars Adalberto Martinez, Pedro Fernandez and Maria Rebeca. It was directed by Ruben Galindo. It was released on October 18th, 1979. The film is about a Mexican boy and a Mexican girl growing up in the United States of America. There was a glossy telenovela remake in 2006 starring Pedro Armendariz Jr. This movie has a gritty, real world feel and a low budget look. You can see grey clouds in some scenes. The film also has a funky soundtrack with some ranchera music. The film is a must see if you enjoy Mexican cinema.",1365984000,2,653,4.5423728813559325
2230253,4,B0007PALX4,"one of my favorite classic Mexican movies ever. I was in love with Pedro Fernandez as a kid and to be able to buy it as an adult and share the same love for this movie with my daughter is amazing. The songs are incredibly well sang by him and the movie is very endearing. The quality of the dvd is okay, but its to be expected for a movie to be filmed in the 80's.",1314576000,,364,3.8026315789473686
2230254,5,B0007PALX4,I love this movie. If you were a child of a multicultural home and got to go to the drive in; this was a classic. Pedro Fernandez is pure gold in this movie and the songs will stick with you for years to come.,1223942400,5,209,3.772727272727273
2230255,5,B0007PALX4,"I was involved in the making of this movie, the Ida H, shrimp boat, and the Western Star were my boats and I had a small part in the film.  I was the boat captain that was running the Western Star and if you look real close at the end of the movie you can see me driving the boat and standing at the side when we docked.

It is a great movie, not because I had a part in it, but because of the plot and the singing, real family type and entertaining movie.
