240657,5,6300214613,"If you are looking for just a laughable picture without trying to be a great western, this is the one. There are numerous sight gags and quips, plus several big stars and some soon to be stars. So don't try to build  plots or complicated story lines, just sit back,relax and enjoy a fairly  well made and certainly funny show..",914284800,,327,4.433333333333334

240790,3,6300214613,I think this is the best comedic western I have seen since Cat Ballou.  Tom Berenger plays a a 1920sh era big screen cowboy.  Who is naive but also smart and witty.  He stays one step ahead of everybody because the same things always happen in all of his movies. That sums this movie up.  You have to watch it yourself to really get it.,1517443200,,336,4.123076923076923

240871,5,6300214613,Netflix doesn't carry this.  Perhaps my local CD rental place may still have it--they carried it back when this film came out.  I seemed to remember more singing in this film.  It's a cowboy movie parody (the good guy is REAL pure until he meets some hot women).  A nice change from The Magnificent Seven or Hang Em High westerns.  Tom Berenger was also reaching his best.,1500422400,,372,4.492537313432836

240873,4,6300214613,"I always thought this movie was unfairly compared to Blazing Saddles. That would be like comparing Mt. McKinley to Mt. Everest.  McKinley is not the tallest mountain in the world, but it is still pretty high. Rustlers' Rhapsody is not as funny as the Mel Brooks film, but it is funny. If you prefer your westerns to be Sam Peckinpah gory, you will not like this film. If you like Roy Rodgers, the Lone Ranger, and the ""shoot the guns out of the hands"" type of western, you will like this movie. My dad, a John Wayne fan, likes this movie, and he hates Roy Rodgers and the Lone Ranger. ""Yoddle lay hee yoddle lay hee, I ride alone.""",1498521600,,631,4.302521008403361

240942,5,6300214613,"This film is often compared unfavorably to Blazing Saddles.  Blazing Saddles satirized the grittier, more epic era of westerns.  This film satirizes the old singing cowboy era of westerns.  The spaghetti westerns are shoehorned in for comic effect.  In retrospect, this is the best comedy film of 1985",1488153600,,301,5.208333333333333

Bailey (Police Academy), Fernando Rey, Marilu Henner (Taxi), Tom Berenger, and Patrick Wayne (John Wayne's son).

I downloaded this from Amazon Prime for my elderly Bonanza & Gunsmoke-loving mother-in-law and she laughed all the way through.

RUSTLER'S RHAPSODY: Legend has it that between 1938 and 1947, Hollywood churned out 52 low-budget Westerns starring Rex O'Herlihan, ""The Singing Cowboy"" (Berenger). But what would one of those old B-movie ""horse operas"" look like if it were made in today's self-conscious, post-modern world? Rex finds out when he rides into Oakwood Estates and realizes that the town is virtually identical to every frontier town he's ever been in, complete with stereotypical characters like ""Miss Tracey"" (Henner), a virginal hooker with a heart of gold; a power-mad cattle baron, ""Colonel Ticonderoga"" (Griffith), who really runs the town; and ""Peter"" (Bailey), the eccentric but friendly town drunk.

Rex is a bit confused about why he's reliving the same ""sheepherders versus cattle baron"" plot for the 53rd time--and he's getting a bit tired of it as well. His presence threatens The Colonel, who enlists the aid of the villainous railroad builders to kill him. And just about the time Rex gets a handle on this ""self-awareness"" thing, people start throwing him curves. Peter trades in his drunk suit for a ""sidekick"" outfit, for instance. And The Colonel devises a giddily twisted plan to pit Good Guy Rex against the single foe he's never faced and can never defeat: another Good Guy.

Discussion: It's ""Blazing Saddles"" for intellectuals: an absurdly aware romp that asks the insidiously simple, comically quirky question, ""What would happen if a character in a movie suddenly became aware that he is a character in a movie?""

The real wonder of this Western is that it works on many levels. On the surface, it's a fun-filled, affectionate tribute to a long-gone genre; a gentle lampoon of childhood idylls about cowboy idols like Roy Rogers, Gene Autrey and Hopalong Cassidy. Wilson knows these flicks inside out, and hasn't missed fondly mocking even the most minor detail. His Rex O'Herlihan is an archetype among stereotypes, complete with all the external accouterments of the perfect Singing Cowboy (flashy, color-coordinated costumes, hand-tooled boots, extravagant guitars), as well as all the psychological characteristics that qualify him as a Good Guy: humility, respect for a lady's virtue, and a pledge never to shoot a bad guy anywhere but in the hand.

As wild parody, it's stocked with strange takes on standard cardboard characters: The sheepherders are Hassidic Jews, for example, and Griffith does a truly eccentric turn as the closeted Colonel. Wayne alone almost steals the film in an engagingly enthusiastic performance as the ""other good guy,"" Bob Barker. (His every line is a gem, especially those concerning his own background, and his requirements for being a Good Guy.)

But Rustler's Rhapsody is more than just smart slapstick, insightful foolery and poignant nostalgia. Rex's blossoming into consciousness has devastating effects. He's cursed with foresight, for one; merely remembering his repetitious ride gives him a thorough education in Western movie conventions. And almost like a communicable disease, Rex's self-awareness seems to infect everyone--and critical awareness changes everything, liberating them all from endless repetitions of their habitual patterns of ""oater"" action. Even Rex grows increasingly edgy, first at the oddity of his newfound knowledge, and eventually in realizing that something is about to happen that has *never happened before.*

Wilson asks an obvious question, impeccable in its logic and childlike in its simplicity: What happens if you pit a Good Guy against another Good Guy? In the morally unambiguous universe of ""B"" Westerns, Good always triumphs over Evil. But how can Good triumph over Good? The complications and implications are both mindbending and hilarious. Wilson accomplished something new--something no one ever thought of before.
There is of course the danger that overanalysis can strip the film of its fun--but fun is just the surface of this surprisingly insightful flick. I absolutely adore this sweet, unique and memorable gem, and would forgive Hugh Wilson a hundred ""Police Academy"" entries for creating it.",1422230400,2,4352,5.271284271284271

I don't know what other reviews are referring to about a deleted scene; my version has a scene with the words ""confident heterosexual"" in it. I must have the latest release of the film. Highly recommended, and one of Berenger's best.",1404432000,,737,4.466666666666667
241746,1,6300214613,"Readers should know that the version I'm reviewing runs 88 minutes, the same time given on IMDb. But it does seem to be ""missing something"", and I'm inclined to believe those reviewers who think scenes have been removed (for TV, perhaps?). It really doesn't matter, because ""RR"" quickly sinks beneath the waves five minutes after it starts.

Hugh Wilson is best known as the producer of ""WKRP in Cincinnati"", a classic sitcom. (When I watched re-runs a year ago, I was pleasantly surprised that it was even better than I remembered.) He's been associated with other excellent shows, and created the outstanding ""Frank's Place"". But his movie record is checkered. Most of his films have been critically panned comedies.

""RR"" tries to spoof classic B Westerns by transplanting one of their greatest stars -- Rex O'Herlihan -- into a modern color+widescreen Western. Wilson doesn't seem to know that a good story requires some sort of conflict to drive it. In this case, the most-obvious conflict would be to treat the story as a //double// fish-out-of-water tale -- Rex doesn't understand the modern-sensibilities Western he finds himself in, while that story's characters can't comprehend a singing ""good-guy"" cowboy dressed in ridiculous clothing.

In the right hands, this could be very funny, with Western-movie clichs (both old and recent) colliding to great comic effect. Instead, Wilson trots out each clich, throws it in the audience's face, then //explains// it. The low point is G W Bailey (an unappealing actor mimicking Jack Elam's role in ""Support Your Local Sheriff!"") screwing up a classic gag line, then //explaining// it to the audience. You've got to be kidding, Mr Wilson. (Would that he were.)

The story builds to what is a terrific comic idea -- that to be a true ""good guy"", you have to be not merely a heterosexual, but a //confident// heterosexual. It never occurs to Wilson that Rex -- coming from an era of asexual cowpokes -- might not know what ""heterosexual"" means. (Throughout the film, he says he knows everything that's going to happen (in a general sort of way). How do you get humor out of that?) Nor do we see him finally gaining his ""confidence"" with the virgin hooker. (This appears to be the missing scene.)

The climax -- in which all the bad guys kill each other -- is probably intended as a spoof of ""The Wild Bunch"". But it fails to provoke even the faintest snicker.

Wilson's dialog is lame, labored, and logorrheic. Despite ""RR""'s relatively short running time, I found myself nodding off at several points. It's not merely tedious, but actively boring.

The PG rating is absurd. The talk about sex and sexuality easily pushes ""RR"" into PG-13 territory.

A terrible ""comedy"", with perhaps two (count 'em -- two) solid jokes. Not recommended -- unless you want an object lesson in how not to make a good movie.",1404086400,,2854,4.894409937888199

This a very funny Western movie spoof. Tom Berrenger plays the cowboy hero that is like those in the 40-50s Westerns.  The problem is somehow he has ended up in the real Old West and he must find a real sidekick and sweetheart.  I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys Western Comedies.  The story, casting, directing, acting, stunts, and music are all great.  I hope they make this available on Instant Video.  I have the DVD but I would like it on Digital too.

241953,4,6300214613,"Rustlers' Rhapsody was one of those films that had the misfortune to be made for a cinema audience that no longer existed: not only was it a comedy Western in 1985, the spoof landscape having moved on a long way since Blazing Saddles barely over a decade earlier, but it was a gentle and affectionate comedy Western parodying 30s and 40s matinee B movies that were no longer even playing on TV, so a fair portion of the small audience that might have been lured in by Police Academy director Hugh Wilson's name probably didn't get the joke. But if you are well versed in Western lore and can give it a reel or two to find its feet after an unsteady start, it's really rather delightful. Tom Berenger is singing cowboy Rex O'Herlihan, drifting into yet another stereotypical Western town where they complain if there isn't a hair in the gin and where another power mad cattle baron (Andy Griffith) with thousands of cattle you hear but never see is at war with the local sheep herders who smell awful and rely on passing strangers who only ever shoot the bad guys in the hand to fight their battles for them. Even Rex is aware of how predictable it is, filling in G.W. Bailey's town drunk and future sidekick in on the town characters rather than vice versa while town hostess Marilu Henner and the villain's daughter Sela Ward vie for his affections and Griffith allies his traditional cowboys with railroad boss Fernando Rey's spaghetti Western bad guys who wear long raincoats even when it's 110degrees and who have better theme music than the good guys. (Leone fans will certainly recognise some of the Almeria locations.)

Despite numbering Walter Hill among its producers, this is a world away from Deadwood, though it has fun with the characters' sexuality and undermines many of the absurd Code of the West rules the films it spoofs were built on. Griffith is terrific as the chief villain constantly frustrated by the inability of his minions to understand him, Bailey gives good sidekick, Jim Carter has a nice but all too brief cameo as a vicious gunfighter and Patrick Wayne has fun as a rival good guy who throws him into existential crisis by undermining his belief in his own goodness and his own heterosexuality. It's a lot of fun despite the complete absence of any rustlers, but unfortunately the DVD release is missing one scene where Rex resolve his confident heterosexuality issues as well as being devoid of any extras.",1374796800,,2440,4.714285714285714

242038,5,6300214613,"...is one of the sly ways a departed character is described. However, as with much in this very clever film, it's repeated each time giving the viewer a new reader about which to wonder. Top flight cast knows their way around witty comedy that has been based on a whole melange of stereotypes. Indeed it's the wit that probably kept this from being the hit it deserved. For a public too used to television sit come, or an audience that was actually expecting a John Wayne-esque Western, would have either puzzled or confused or both. If you can only see Andy Griffith as the Sheriff of Mayberry, then his portrayal of an evil cattle baron, and one about whom there may be ""questions"" will be distressing. Tom Berenger and Patrick Wayne play two good guys but, as everyone knows, there can only be one good guy per film. They seem to realize that they're in some sort of parallel universe but, still, there can only be one good guy in a white hat wherever you are. Marilu Henner can't get a rise out of either gentleman but she, too, is distraught over the death of a cowboy who had...""feelings, Pa, he could feel things."" One doesn't often get to apply the word ""droll"" but here's an example of it. As parody it works perfecty but as a Western....well, maybe if were a musical.

  all the wrong things. One joke I will tell you is when a guy get Shots the Doctor looks at him and says well we will have to amputate the leg and the guy goes but Doc I got shot in the hand.

A spoof on all westerns from the old depression-era shorts to the ""spaghetti"" westerns of the 70's & 80's, ""Rustlers' Rhapsody"" not only pays homage, but injects some modern-day common sense into them. I was hooked from the moment the screen shifted into color and the bad guys who had been fleeing the lone cowboy suddenly realized they outnumbered him and turned around to chase him.

This movie not only taught me that I could enjoy a western, but also (with some help from my dad) served as a sort of guide to the various types of westerns that have been popular.

For anyone who can remember and quote these words and was raised watching Roy Rogers, Gene Autrey, Hopalong Cassidy, The Cisco Kid and Saturday morning westerns on black and white TV, or listening on the radio, this film is a hoot and a half. I rarely laugh out load at a film at home, but I was constantly laughing at this wonderfully funny film.

What great take offs on the typical western film characters and situations! The lone cowboy in clothes no self respecting cowboy would wear. A fantastic horse names Wildfire, who danced better than Gene Kelly or Fred Astire. The music hall hostess who charged $600 a night, but only talked to her clients (Miss Kitty from ""Gunsmoke"" maybe?)The town drunk who wants to become the hero's sidekick. The mysterious ""root"" that makes anyone eating it feel soooo good.

Tom Berenger is great as the virginal, overdressed hero. He kids this stereotype magnificently. G. W. Bailey almost steals the film as the drunk/sidekick. Marilu Henner is just right as the sexy hostess. Sela Ward is perfect as the villain's daughter who has a special problem with her horse. Andy Griffith makes a delightful comic ""villain"". The whole cast is wonderful.

Anyone who doesn't know the old westerns might be lost and think this film not too good, but for those who remember the ""cowboys"" mentioned earlier, this is a comic treasure!

Be sure to watch the credits at the end of the film to hear a lovely balled, ""Lasso You The Moon"", sung by Gary Morris.

242536,5,6300214613,"I love Rustler's Rhapsody. It's easily one of Tome Berrenger's best flicks ever. While most people view Blazing Saddles as the best western comic spoof, Rustler's to me blows it away. It's not nearly as raunchy and not quite as stupid.
Every time I watch this movie it leaves my stomach hurting because of all the times I'll laugh. There's a great cast to this movie. Tom Berrenger, Andy Griffith, Sela Ward, and many more people you'll recognize. That's another reason I can't beleive people haven't seen this.
The story is a western spoof. The hero comes to the western town being used and abused by the evil cattle baron. The hero must stop them and overcome some of his own problems. The story also reveals why the bad guys always lose and why the good guys always win.
The movie is great. I guarentee it will make you laugh and laugh hard. If you don't like spoofs then you probaly won't like Rustler's Rhapsody. If you like Blazing Saddles you will definetly love Rhapsody. This is a must own. It's one of the greatest and funniest movies nobody has ever heard of.",1065571200,39,1070,4.549222797927461
242537,5,6300214613,"The best spoof of all is the movie that pokes fun at ""The Formula"", while carefully following ""The Formula"" itself, whether the movie is a western, science fiction, or murder mystery.  ""Rustler's Rhapsody"", ""Galaxy Quest"", and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" succeed, and succeed superbly, in spoofing their respective genres in this way.
White Hats, Black Hats, action and comedy combine to make this ""feel good"" movie a hit.  Those lucky enough to remember Roy Rogers, Mat Dillon, and Clint Eastwood will enjoy this movie.
I currently own this movie on VHS.  It is on my ""must buy"" list when it becomes available on DVD.",1048204800,,616,4.903846153846154
242538,5,6300214613,"This has long been one of my favorite movies. Every one who knows me, or whom I meet, must at some point sit down with me and watch this extremely humorous video. Tom Berenger's Rex O'H. - The Singing Cowboy, makes a perfect 'Gooder Good Guy', especially with Rex's fashion sense. The story revolves, not around Rex, but around Peter, the town drunk, who aspires to become Rex's sidekick during an ensuing range war. Andy Griffith's 'Colonel', with his latent attraction to the hired-hands makes his one of the best characters in the film. And while it does use just about  E-V-E-R-Y cliche from the westerns it could, from 30's hollywood to spaghetti westerns, the in-joke of the film is that Rex knows it's a cliche, but no one else in the lovely town of Oakwood Estates does. One of it's greatest strengths is the restraint not to 'neon' every joke and gag. Either you get it, or you don't. A lot of the humor plays out in the background, or even off camera, too impatient to wait around for the main action to conclude. Watch it more than once and you will find things going on you never noticed before. While I must concede that Blazing Saddles has more slapstick, and most of it extremely funny, It takes about five Blazing Saddles gags to equel 1 Rustler's. The theme song (the movies, not Rex's) is a true tribute to all the westerns of ours, our fathers, and even our grandfathers youths. So if it comes down to one or the other, I'm pullin up stakes, and movin' to Oakwood Estates, (or a small village near Oslo, Norway). Hey, my dog's name is Rex!",983923200,7,1558,4.485915492957746
242539,5,6300214613,"This is a wonderful movie for those who love westerns and their cliches. Every cliche that ever appeared in a western has been lovingly put into this movie (i.e. bad guys with rifles are never a match for a good guy with  a pistol).  Tom Berenger plays Rex, the Singing Cowboy, with superb  understatement. Andy Griffith plays the daft, dastardly Colonel perfectly  (my favorite Griffith role). Marilou Henner and a young Sela Ward also  appear.  Be aware that this is a silly movie. If someone has to explain the  humor of the opening sequence to you, it may not be for you.  On, Wildfire,  on!",948672000,18,595,4.59047619047619
