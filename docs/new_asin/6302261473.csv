A Gunfight is a good western, but not quite a classic. The story is striking: two friendly gun fighters agree to duel to the death that one of two might rake in a lot of dough for shooting the other. Cash puts on a marvelous performance, and makes you wish he had acted more regularly. I like the film immensely--can't wait for it to really come out on DVD!",1158105600,2,533,4.125
453974,5,6302261473,"this movie should be given its place in any western collection.
much as another fabulous western 'the man who shot liberty valence', it deals with a 'west' that has changed beyond the main characters' capacities to understand.
and, in common with countless westerns (of the a, the b, and the c varieties), it all comes down to who fastest, no? or does it?
both the leading characters are riveting in their own ways,and the ending! oh my, what an ending. whew.
this is a fine western, definately watchable again and again, and therefore definately buyable.

454094,5,6302261473,"Director Lamont Johnson deserved better box office and critical backlash to A GUNFIGHT. He would have to wait two years until THE LAST AMERICAN HERO to deserve better treatment and critical response for his directorial efforts. I found A GUNFIGHT to be more of a thinking man's Western and a curiosity piece. Perhaps it seemed thematically more like something out of the Twilight Zone. Selling to tickets to a gunfight is a fanciful idea, even noble in some respects given the performances of Kirk Douglas and Johnny Cash.",1378944000,,522,4.943181818181818

It is still a good movie - and the ending?  I had to go see it a couple of times in the theatre to fully grasp it.  It is, after all this time, still better than about 90% of the movies out there - and well worth it to see the stars interact.",1373068800,,477,3.816326530612245

454100,5,6302261473,"I can't understand why this film didn't receive greater acclaim.  Maybe the plot was too uncomplicated, who knows?  Kirk Douglas gave his usual topnotch performance as a retired gunfighter, who couldn't resist challenging a renowned ""competitor"" at such trade, played by Johnny Cash.  This was more than just another western flick, but a psychological study of two men, leading up to their armed confrontation at the end, where only one could survive.",1326758400,,451,5.236111111111111

454129,4,6302261473,"I saw this movie when new, and to this day I am blown away at the staging and the premise of the story. It was a truly ""revisionist"" western, when making westerns in that category became almost cliche'. Kirk Douglas is as good as usual, meaning better than most. Johnny Cash gives a suitable and able performance as the  protagonist of the film. This movie is more of an ""Art House"" movie than a mainstream western, and I think that's the problem for many of those who've seen it and written about it. You really must view it in a different context than many standard fare movies of the western genre. I'd place this alongside ""The Hired Hand"" before I'd compare it to any standard western tale. I absolutely loved the duel ending, filmed as a reverie in Johnny Cash's mind as he prepares to leave town. Excellent film, but again, be warned, it's not your standard western by any means",1266451200,8,885,4.496894409937888

454132,5,6302261473,"This movie is a classic for more than one reason.  It has a great story presenting a moral quandary.  It has two great starring actors including Johnny Cash in his first starring role.  It is the first ever movie produced by an Indian tribe, the Jicarilla Apaches of New Mexico.  Before casinos and cigarette concessions, the Jicarillas had money as a tribe to invest from oil, gas and uranium leases.

Bringing tears to my eyes and shame to this great movie, the VHS tape I recieved was of extremely low quality.",1191628800,,513,4.593406593406593
454133,2,6302261473,"I didn't expect much from this film but the presence of Kirk Douglas, Johnny Cash, Karen Black and Keith Carradine in the cast conduced me to rent it. I must admit that the main and sole theme of Lamont Johnson's A GUNFIGHT is very good. Two aging gunfighters decide to make some money by organizing a public shootout in a bullring on the other side of the Mexican border.

The problem is that you can't present a 90 minutes movie with only one idea. OK, there is another interesting scene in the film: the arrival of a young gunman in town, played by Keith Carradine, who wants to kill one of the old pistoleros. But if you like shootouts, the definitive movie about these duels is of course Samuel Raimi's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Quick-and-the-Dead/dp/0767817710/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Quick and the Dead</a>. In conclusion, A GUNFIGHT is a curiosity whose screenplay should have been given then to an Italian director. It typically develops the kind of theme one can find in the spaghetti westerns of that period.

454134,3,6302261473,"The Western showdown is a duel, a matching of gunplay skills in which the faster, more professional gunman wins... The logical extension of the show is without doubt a gladiatorial Roman circus combat between two fighters and such is the elemental structure of Lamont Johnson's film...

Kirk Douglas is a retired gunman sick enough of his life, and Johnny Cash is a weary gunslinger who knows that even if he wins, he will eventually lose... Both are famous, veteran gunfighters who provide their talent as the quick and the fast... The auditorium chosen is a bullfight ring...

Whether the two men are considered as gladiators or bullfighters, the film deplorably smashes the traditional conception of the showdown, twisting it from a clash between good and bad into a show of a very poor quality...

The situation exposed is certainly ambiguous, implausible and anti-climactic against popular blood lust...

The film captures the viewer with a double-ended showdown... One with Douglas as the winner, and the other with Cash...

Our feeling is that the strands of myth and honest re-creation which connect the American Western to the real American West are being cut by those whose roots are far removed from the actual frontier... To the Western purist, such tendency can only be seen with alarm... The screen showdown has been undermined and ruined... There are no white hats and black villainy anymore...",1162944000,,1409,5.082251082251083
454135,3,6302261473,"By no means an epic, nor is it a ""B"" movie, ""A Gunfight"" falls into the category of good mainstream western entertainment with a twist. Two famous gunfighters, one semi-active one semi-retired with a family and feeling a bit stale, meet and speculate what it might be like to fight one another for a paying audience. The idea comes to fruition and that's it in a nutshell. Solid performance by Kirk Douglas, as expected, and Johnny Cash proves he's come a long way since ""Five Minutes To Live"". Cash performs the main title as well. A good supporting cast, including Jane Alexander and a young Keith Carradine, makes this a worthwhile pic. On second thought I give it four stars. A good DVD transfer, though I'd like to see this in widescreen in a future release.",1161043200,6,763,4.617647058823529
7824536,4,6302261473,"This is good. And Johnny Cash is a good actor.

There are quite a few subtle things in this movie, you see it or hear, but you may not get the impact of it.

The film quality isn't special. And the DVD a got is crap-ola; no main menu and no scene selections. It's all one long file, you can't skip around.

Kirk Douglas is his cliche / same as always / bubbly center of attention actor. He lacks subtleties. Johnny Cash balances that out. He plays a sincere 'real person' type character. He can also ride a horse well and handles a Colt SAA well (no, not like Clint Eastwood). Back to Kirk - I haven't seen him play a character like this, so that is worth see if you are a fan of his.

Lots of little things. Cash's bedroom seen with Karen Black is cool. He shows some good dialogue delivery.

This plays out in cliche small town atmosphere; lots of talk, goading, innuendo, and more ""town talk"". Cash's character gets put in a situation he didn't want and with some hesitation falls back to his old ways.

Bottom line, this is about 2 men past their primes. One yearns for his glory years, the other is looking to be mellow in his current circumstance. You don't feel bad for either character, only the people they leave behind.

I can recommend to people who like Johnny Cash and a movie that puts some interesting non-standard scenes and dialogue in a fairly standard story.

This could be, or should be, in the Criterion Classic selection.

SPOILER-ISH

here is something i wrote as a reply to someone else's critique of the movie:

..

This film never tries to be an action packed gunslinger thriller. It tries to distill 2 men who have exclusively devoted their souls to wildness; killing, gambling, whoring. And now these 2 men are trying to (failing) to live out their later years passively.

There is a scene early on, most people will never catch it or get it. I am quick draw guy, I own Alfonso of Hollywood quick draw rigs. I do a lot of this type of shooting. So this scene is means something, but you have to know the context.

Kirk Douglas goes into his closet to get his gun rig (in correct parlance, that is a belt and holster, in this case it has a pistol in it). There is an extremely duded up elaborate beautiful rig, complete with silver conchos and it is stitched with rawhide, not sewn. A rig like that is a ""fancy"" rig and costs $3000-$4000 dollars now. Back then way way way less (tho not as fancy).

Here is the point of all of that - he is going into town to meet Johnny Cash who is another notorious gunman. Kirk has been in town doing ""gun play"" stuff to make money. You get that he uses this beautiful (clearly Mexican made) rig when goes to town. BUT.. he picks it up, pauses, then uncovers his ""old"" rig and puts it on.

This is an extremely important part. His wife notices it and asks him why he is not taking his ""fancy rig"". He replies that his old rig is more ""comfortable"".. this is the rig he did all his killing with. It is not fancy, it is his killing rig.

By that one choice the entire tone is SET. He aims to meet Johnny with his real-deal serious gun slinging rig, not his fancy rig. Very important scene.",1524268800,,3150,4.284991568296796

7824543,3,6302261473,"I saw this at the theater when I was 10 years old with my parents.  It seemed to me at the time.  That Johnny Cash as a singer was a step behind Glen Campbell.  Who was my favorite singer.  He sold a ton of record.  But I don't think he outsold Glen.  Glen had a t.v. show.  A year later Johnny had a t.v. show.  Glen was in a movie.  True Grit that everybody went to see.  Then Johnny Cash mad this movie that not too many people went to see.
Anyway the movie isn't great.  And it's slow.  Johnny and Kirk Douglas are old gunfighter's who decide to have one last winner take all shootout in a bull fighting ring.  With a paying audience.  Sort of a western pay per view duel.  Douglas and Cash play well off each other.  And I was surprised by how good an actor Cash is.  The winner at the end.  Rides off into the sunset thinking about what would have happened if he had lost.  And that  pretty much sums this movie up.",1492819200,,921,4.011111111111111
