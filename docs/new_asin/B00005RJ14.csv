7952871,3,B00005RJ14,"This is not a Columbia short but a failed pilot. It is similar in length and comparible in quality to the ""average"" Shemp shorts of the period. It can't really be placed at the level of the top Shemp shorts such as ""Goof on the Roof"" ""Heavenly Daze"", etc. It would have been interesting if the TV show was picked up. Maybe after a number of episodes, the writers would find a rythm with the Stooges.
As a Stooges fan, I recognize that Curly is the best ""third Stooge"" but I like Shemp, too. Too often, Shemp was burdened with inferior material and cheap remakes but every once in a while, they'd hit a home run with Shemp but nowhere near as regularly as they did with Curly. This pilot is another example of this: it's pretty good with a few laughs but you probably wouldn't place it in the top 25 Shemp shorts.",1141257600,,812,4.279220779220779
