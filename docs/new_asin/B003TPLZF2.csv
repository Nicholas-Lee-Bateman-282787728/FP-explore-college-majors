8405375,5,B003TPLZF2,"I agree with the top four reviews. I watched that show with Ben Bailey just about every day it was on, and really loved it. So did my mother. Before that my all- time favorite game show was Jeopardy. I'd still rather watch Cash Cab with Ben Bailey. Of course, I'm also bald,and us baldies should stick together. Alex Tribec has too much hair. I wish I had DVDs of every episode of Cash Cab ( and maybe Jeopardy too. I sure would learn a lot.)",1512864000,,442,4.151162790697675
