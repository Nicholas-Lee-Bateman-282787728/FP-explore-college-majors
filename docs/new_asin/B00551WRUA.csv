I mean, what more do you need if you like fantasy? A great and intriguing story is being woven around fantasic looking characters and creatures wich play against cool looking sets in a world screaming to be explored. AND there are puppets. Yes indeed, puppets! I grew up loving Jim Henson's Labyrinth, The Storyteller and The Dark Crystal, but there's just not much puppet fantasy around anymore these days. Sure, we're still waiting for the sequel to The Dark Crystal, if it will ever be made, and even that's unsure. But this series brings all that goodness back! Humor, excitement and high adventure in a fantasy world resembling the Dungeons and Dragons universe. I seriously enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed watching Lord of the Rings for example. The only small point of critisism I can think of is that it's just way to short (about 25 minutes but has some extra's to enjoy) and ends with a big cliffhanger. The story continues in the 2nd Season though, so let's hope that'll be finished and available on dvd soon! In the meantime I recommend this to any fantasy fan who yearns for those good old fantasy movies from back in the 80's. It's not only very nice to have, but by buying the dvd we support and encourage the creators to bring us more Spellfury goodness!

It's aimed at a slightly younger audience but is very similar in look and feel and thus has that hensonesque feel to it.",1335398400,,1886,5.044871794871795
