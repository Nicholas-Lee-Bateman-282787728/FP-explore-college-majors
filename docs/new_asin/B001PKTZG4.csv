8333622,5,B001PKTZG4,"Very informative about the need for the troops here and abroad to be entertained, and to know they are not forgotten. It was originally aired on Fox News. Liked it so well I wanted my own copy. Would highly recommend it!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-the-Road-in-Iraq-With-Our-Troops-and-Gary-Sinise/dp/B001PKTZG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On the Road in Iraq With Our Troops and Gary Sinise</a>",1322438400,4,439,7.148148148148148
8333623,5,B001PKTZG4,"I found this video uplifting and patriotic.  Gary Sinise is not only an accomplished actor, he is a true American!  What amazing dedication and appreciation for the men and women who protect our lives and lifestyles every day.  Instead of critizing and using stardom to voice personal opinions and agendas, Gary and his friends devote their time and money showing appreciation for our troops.  I'm glad I caught this video segment on FOXS News.  I enjoyed it so much I purchased two DVDs to give as gifts.  It's frustrating that other ""mainstream"" news networks haven't publicized Gary's efforts.  It's also extremely frustrating and unfortunate that other Hollywood actors don't follow Gary's lead.  What happened to being proud of being an American and showing support for those who protect her?  Thank you Gary for all you've done and continue to do.  I'm glad I could help contribute to your cause by buying the DVDs.  I look forward to growing old watching you fill Bob Hope's shoes.  Thank you!",1237161600,23,1000,4.922155688622754

8333625,5,B001PKTZG4,"Gary Sinese is an American hero.  His support for our courageous men and women in uniform is incredibly inspirational, and this DVD should be required viewing for every American.  What a fantastic view of life in the US military.  It highlights the need for us to recognize and commend them for their voluntary efforts.  Thank you.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Courage-A-Pictorial-Essay-on-Life-in-Iraq-Today/dp/0615164307/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Courage - A Pictorial Essay on Life in Iraq Today</a>",1232841600,16,549,7.029411764705882
