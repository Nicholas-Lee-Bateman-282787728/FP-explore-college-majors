773537,2,6304056915,"I do think Bergman was miscast, but she gives a very good effort at playing a part that would have been much better with Vivian Leigh or Joan Crawford or Betty Davis.  And Bergman certainly is gorgeous and full of fire.  But she is not believable.
Cooper is fun to watch, but seems a parody of himself in this film. Here is one of the flaws.  He seems to be in a different film than the other characters.  His part is played mostly for comedy, the other parts are mainly played melodramatically.
The film is wildly uneven and inconsistant.  The tone of the film varies strangely in different sections:  It starts dark and moody, almost like a horror film. Later scenes are either romantic melodrama, or broad comedy, and by far the best scene in the film is sophisticated and witty comedy, with far better dialogue than the rest of the film has (this is the scene where the old socialite trys to get the Bergman character to pay her to help Bergman win social acceptance).
A couple of more flaws; the dwarf character is fun to watch in spots, but is the characterization, or poor acting ability of the  man who plays him becomes grating.
Flora Robeson, does quite a accomplished job playing the black servant; her New Orleans accent is quite believable.  But despite her acting chops, she isn't believable as a black character; much of this is the makeup she wears.  I assume that at the time the film was made, having a black actress play the cheeky, and not really subservient character would have been too radical for Hollywood. Since the audience knew that a white woman was playing  this sort of black woman, presumably they would not be ""shocked"" or offended.",990748800,5,1665,4.594594594594595
773538,4,6304056915,"Miscast?  Hardly (in my opinion).  This movie was a favorite of mine on the local stations' after school or latenight slots (in those ancient days before cable) and I waited years for it to be released in video.  I can't imagine anyone being a fan of both Bergman AND Gary Cooper, but Bergman fans shouldn't let Cooper's presence be a deterrent . . . he's actually kinda attractive in this.  Ingrid is, of course, stunning.  But why doesn't anyone mention the fact that she plays one of Ferber's favorite archetypes:  the light-skinned Black woman seeking to avenge her mother's mistreatment?  She's quite believable in the role and the relationship between her and her maid/companion sets this apart from a lot of other films where Black actors are cast only as servants.",980121600,10,772,4.847328244274809

Ingrid Bergman is excellent as Clio who has returned to her New Orleans roots bringing with her a flame of revenge for the treatment of her mother years earlier. There she meets a charming Texan, Clint played wonderfully by Gary Cooper who falls for Bergman but also can't quite abide her elitist actions. Sparkling dialogue especially when Cooper and Bergman are arguing. A memorable sound track topped by the theme music for Cooper's Texan. Very good special effects for the time with a train wreck that rivals anything on the big screen today. If you're a Cooper fan don't miss this one. If you're a Bergman fan this is one of her most memorable roles.

774034,4,6304056915,"Ingrid Bergman really shines in this offbeat romantic epic from Edna Ferber. The story is a simplification of Ferber's massive novel about the early days of the famous Saratoga Springs spa and the ""railroad war"" in upstate New York just after the Civil War. The title refers to the Saratoga Trunk Line, a vital and lucrative railway between the coal mines and the New England markets, which was fought over by several robber barons. If you want to know more about the railway battles and the spa, read the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saratoga-Trunk-Perennial-Classics/dp/0060956712/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saratoga Trunk (Perennial Classics)</a>. But if you are a fan of Bergman and her co-star, Gary Cooper, sit back and enjoy the fireworks between them in their second film together (after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/For-Whom-the-Bell-Tolls/dp/0783229488/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a>).

Clio Dulaine and Clint Maroon--only Edna Ferber could come up with names like that for her larger-than-life protagonists. Bergman is Clio, a raven-haired(!) Creole(!) beauty whose constant companions are Dame Flora Robson (in blackface!) as her mulatto nanny and the wonderful small actor Jerry Austin as her faithful dwarf manservant. Bergman schemes and lies her way into Saratoga's high society to exact revenge against her father's family for dishonoring her late mother, and along the way she falls for Cooper, a Texas gambler with a revenge plan of his own (involving the railroad). Needless to say, sparks fly, trains crash, and Max Steiner music pounds in the background (the score is highlighted by Steiner's lovely theme song, ""As Long As I Live""). Director Sam Wood manages to bring a light touch to the sprawling plot, and that's a big compliment.

This film is fascinating for several reasons. Clio is Bergman's least typical role--a ruthless, scheming, charming vixen (did I mention the raven hair?). Robson's cross-racial performance is a real triumph--she hits all the ""mammy"" stereotypes while maintaining the character's dignity and humanity. (Yes, they should have cast an actress of color, but Robson received the film's only Academy Award nomination for her performance.) Austin has a field day as the clever manservant--one of the best roles ever given to a small person in old Hollywood--and he, like Robson, emerges as a dignified, noble character. There are even powerful moments for both of them, when they each chastise Cooper for his disrespectful treatment of them. Edna Ferber was passionate about equality for all people (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Show-Boat/dp/B00004RF9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Show Boat</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giant-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0007US7FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giant (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ice-Palace/dp/B002P92OV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ice Palace</a>&nbsp;for more on this), and these are two of her best characters.

774035,5,6304056915,Saratoga Trunk is such a unique story. The performances by Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman are playful and seriously indepth by turns. I have loved watching this movie many times over and see something new in the filming each time.,1252540800,8,230,4.775
774036,4,6304056915,"I love New Orleans and most movies about the place. In this good story by esteemed novelist Edna Ferber, Ingrid Bergman plays Clio Dulaine, the daughter of a New Orleans placee whose benefactor married another. We learn immediately that the broken-hearted mother shot the father. Bergman is wonderful as the daughter who returns from Paris and intends to make good and show up the family that spurned her mother. A little bit mellodramatic at the beginning when she loses it upon first returning to the old house in the French Quarter, the movie has wonderful atmospheric black and white photography and surprising plot twists among the characters she runs into, including a woman who perceives Clio's plans. Interesting side trip into the history of the railroad--the Saratoga Trunk. The costumes and interiors are beautiful, and the painted backdrops of New Orleans are effective. Flora Robson plays her loyal, sassy personal maid in a dreadful make-up job. Jerry Austin, a comedic dwarf, is her other servant. And the young Gary Cooper in an enormous Western hat is great, as always, especially when he first gazes at Bergman. They soon realize they both want the same things in life.

Bergman and Cooper do have a chemistry, and this was capatilized on following their pairing in ""For Whom the Bell Tolls.""  It is not ""high art"" but it is so delightful to watch.  To see Bergman and Cooper work the camera, to view the sets and costuming.  To witness the flirtations, and to see Bergman's temper rise and fall.  This is the only time I have ever seen Gary Cooper overact--but he does it on purpose and with great skill. I feel he probably did not really want to make this movie, but that it was a ""filler"" for him.

774041,3,6304056915,"While I concur that English actress Flora Robson playing a ""mulatto"" is stretching things a bit, her studied performance, as well set decorations, is the only reason that this Cooper/Bergman vehicle is tolerable.
Robson had an extremely long career on the stage and in film, comparable to contemporary Dame Judith Anderson.  By portraying the role of Bergman's maid, she joined a rather short list, including Lord Olivier (""Othello"") and Ava Gardner (""Showboat""), of white actors ""passing"" as black.
Hey, it was the norm, back in the day. ""Saratoga Trunk"" was no different from most era westerns or historical dramas in the practice of white actors portraying persons of color.",1062806400,2,677,5.2110091743119265

A Magic Movie Moment comes when he looks at her with a small smile and says ""may I say - you are very -- beautiful?"" And she says with a beautiful, wicked smile ""Yes, isn't it lucky?"" You want to say YES!! You go girl!
Florence Bates as the grand dame in Saratoga steals every scene she is in. Jerry Austin as the dwarf ""Pepito"" jack-of-all-trades, is fun and I think brings dignity to the role. Flora Robson is quite good as the maid/companion and received an academy award nomination.
But it is the romantic French Quarter, the wide veranda at the Saratoga hotel, with all the old biddies rocking and gossiping; and Clio and Clint, two rogues, and their love story that make this so much fun to watch. Just relax and enjoy.",999043200,47,1270,4.454935622317596
774043,4,6304056915,"Ingrid Bergman plays Clio Dulaine, the half-Creole illegitimate daughter of a new Orleans aristocrat, who returns to the Crescent City from Paris after her mother's death to revenge herself on her father's family.  While she succeeds in humiliating the Dulaines, she flirts with Texas gambler, Colonel Clint Marron (Gary Cooper).  He is not thrilled by her need for revenge and heads off to Saratoga Springs.  Clio eventually shows up, pretending to be a French noblewoman in an attempt to get a rich husband, setting her sights on railroad tycoon Bart Van Steed (John Warburton).  But we all know who is really the right guy for her.  Bergman, a brunette for this film, certainly finds the sexy Clio to be a nice change of pace from the nuns and cool refugees from the continent she had been playing of late.  Unfortunately, the melodrama offers nothing new and Bergman ends up with Gary Cooper because, well, he is Gary Cooper; a bit roguish, but still a pillar of strength and virtue.  All the sparks are on her side of the equation.  ""Saratoga Trunks"" is based on a novel by Edna Ferber.  Flora Robson received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for role as Angelique, Clio's attendant, in this 1945 film was directed by Sam Wood.",994377600,6,1247,4.789719626168225

7860712,5,6304056915,"I remember this film being broadcast on network television back in the late 60s but never saw it until I decided to buy the DVD sight unseen. I have always been a huge fan of Miss Bergman, the great lady star of the 1940s. I have seen just about every one of her films, including her early Swedish films. She had star quality even then and I can see why David Selznick signed her to a contract. I had a ball watching Saratoga Trunk. I could not decide whether it was a comedy or drama but just let myself fall under its spell. It was a hoot seeing the famed English actress, Flora Robson, play her Haitian companion, all done up with dark face makeup. And her other companion, a dwarf, made for a lively and unusual trio. I could tell that both Miss Bergman and Gary Cooper must have had fun making this film. And I had a lot of fun watching it.",1501632000,,845,4.158536585365853
