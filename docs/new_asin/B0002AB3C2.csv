8313567,3,B0002AB3C2,"This video is OK.  It could have been so much better.  The box description says you will be introduced to ""some of the amazing women who have been blah blah blah blah blah.""  ""Some"" is the operative word here.  We meet some of the first ladies but as far as makers of this video are concerned most of the women who lived in the White House never existed.

Three of the earliest first ladies (Washington, Abigail Adams, Madison) are discussed for a few minutes each.  We then skip direclty to Mrs. Lincoln (who gets one of the longest descriptions).  We backtrack very briefly to Mrs. Pierce and Mrs. Polk and that's it for the 19th century.  None of the first ladies who lived in the White House from 1817 to 1845 and from 1865 to 1913 are even mentioned.  Not once.  Surely the most flamboyant first lady in history, Julia Tyler, and one of the most popular first ladies in history, Frances Cleveland, deserved at least a look-see.  Helen Taft, one of the strongest and most ambitious first ladies (and who arranged for the planting of 3,000 cherry trees in Washington) is also AWOL. The wives of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover also do not exist in the world of this video.  Bess Truman is mentioned once only in passing.

The video zeroes in on the second Mrs. Wilson (the first one is not mentioned), Eleanor Roosevelt, and then all the first ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Barbara Bush (they are not shown in order, but in hopscotch fashion).

A major focus of the video is the collection of Inaugural ball gowns so it's weird that only once or twice do we actually see an ENTIRE gown and told which first lady wore it.  For example, Mrs. Wilson's gown is discussed in depth, especially the back of it, but the camera only shows us details of the gown and never pulls back far enough so we can see the entire thing.  One piece of jewelry (a brooch worn by Mrs. Wilson) is discussed.  The famed White House collection of china is not mentioned (perhaps they use paper plates for state dinners)?

Interview clips include ones with Mrs. Johnson, Carter, and Reagan, and also Julie Eisenhower.

There is a lot of talk in the film and a lot of interesting facts.  Too bad they couldn't mention more first ladies and really show the gowns, rather than having group shots of them in the staid, unattractive exhibits they've cooked up for them at the Smithsonian.",1397692800,,2359,4.545023696682464
