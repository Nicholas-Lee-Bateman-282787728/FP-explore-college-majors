7954692,2,B00005UM47,"While Aya and her pals are just laying around the house enjoying themselves, they seem to have forgotten they have the powerful Mikage family breathing down their necks along with a reincarnated psycho who wants to rape Ceres. I guess these important things just slipped their minds. So, anyway, Chidori and Shota end up getting taken captive just as soon as Yuhi leaves them. He vows to rescue them and gets together some of his family's security agents along with Toya to sneak into the Mikage building, leaving an ailing Aya behind.

This is probably the most lamebrained volume of the Ceres series so far. I don't understand why the characters just feel like they can just lay around doing nothing, knowing the Mikage group will stop at nothing to get their hands on Aya and other C-Genome girls. They don't try to go public with it or threaten to reveal Mikage's plans to the press or anything. Aya just sort of shambles around with no rhyme or reason looking for the Celestial Robe. They leave Chidori and Shota unprotected. And the plot twists straight out of the movie Species kind of bankrupts the whole Ceres as rape victim plot point. The senseless deaths of some of the main chracters is unneeded at this point and is done more for effect and is a disservice to the series. The voice acting, which has always been too subdued and spoken mostly in hushed tones goes to the other extreme in this volume. What with all the blood and carnage, the voice acting gets almost hysterical and the actors are not talented enough to go to the emotional depths needed. The sound effects in the show are subpar too. I expect Ceres to sink even lower in the next volume.",1167609600,2,1667,4.593959731543624
7954693,5,B00005UM47,"Disc 7 is undoubtedly the best, and the gloomiest, DVD in the series, along with the final disc 8.  Without ruining the heart-wrenching plot twist for you, the viewer will be witness to one of the saddest single episodes in any and all anime.  A very much ignored character up until this DVD, that character's death will resound the ultimate gloom throughout the series.  Make no mistake about it - you will shed some tears, if not through your eyes, then at least pouring of your heart.  Touya also ends up seeing stars, but his death won't matter much after the first death in the DVD.
In any case, Ceres has and will develop itself to be one of the best drama anime ever.  Sure it tends to go melodramatic at times, but the overall plot and character development package is one of the best, if not the best, in the genre among anime.  If you've enjoyed the first 6 DVDs, then you'll absolutely love this and the final DVDs.",1012780800,8,926,4.41764705882353
