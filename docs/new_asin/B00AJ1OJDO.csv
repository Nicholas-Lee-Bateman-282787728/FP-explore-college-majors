5439927,5,B00AJ1OJDO,"Beautiful, traditional animation, brisk storytelling and lovable characters.  It's far and away more entertaining than the average educational film.  The world needs more cartoons like this one!",1356566400,2,194,6.148148148148148
5439928,5,B00AJ1OJDO,"""Pups of Liberty"" is a fun, simply told tale of the American Revolution. Done in classic Disney-style animation, this film is perfect education for the younger elementary school grades. Filmmakers Jennifer and Bert Klein cleverly tell the story with dogs, representing Americans, fighting against cats, representing the bad-guy British soldiers. The plot is simple and clear-- the Americans' freedom of speech, through the printing press owned by main character John Kennel, is taken away as they protest the raising of taxes by the British. Young and old will enjoy this wonderful film!

5439929,5,B00AJ1OJDO,"I have two school age children, and they absolutely loved this! They wanted to see it a few times at the first sitting. It is absolutely beautiful to watch, and is told in a story that is easy to understand. Rather than feeling ""educational"", it felt familiar and was entertaining. More educational material should be presented like this. Will pass on to their school and recommend to friends.",1355702400,3,393,4.794117647058823
5439930,5,B00AJ1OJDO,"This is a superbly animated story of the beginnings of the American revolution as told by cats and dogs representing some of the founding fathers. This video is
an excellent way to introduce children to events like the Boston Tea Party (The Boston T-Bone Party) and the break away from tyranny in an entertaining and educational way. I'm planning to give copies of it to the younger kids in my family.",1355529600,2,401,4.661971830985915
8552426,5,B00AJ1OJDO,"""THE PUPS OF LIBERTY""  is both a love letter to fantastic and adorable classical animation and the real life events that have shaped American history.
This tightly constructed telling of the boston Tea party has the ability to take its young audience by the hand and take them on this earnest journey, all while never losing sight of teaching an important lesson wrapped in an entertaining and solid story. The characters are animated beautifully and the visual style goes a long way to giving this film an atmosphere thats a joy to watch. With its pitched perfect running time it flows at an great pace and respecting its young audience it never dumbs down the events it down too much. Its a great balance of history and entertainment that should appeal to all who settle down to watch ""PUPS OF LIBERTY"".
The film makers definitely poured their hearts in to this and i for one would love to see them tackle other era's in history.",1362441600,,931,4.642424242424243

8552428,5,B00AJ1OJDO,"Very cute little story encapsulating the Boston Tea Party and events surrounding the American Revolution. Entertaining, involving way for children to learn about history, where (as usual) the cats are the the haughty, insensitive, scheming antagonists and the dogs are the scrappy, brave, loyal heroes - but the many dog/cat puns are clever, and the deceptively simple characters are animated with a sophistication usually reserved for Disney-quality theatrical films (and the credits reveal several Disney veterans' involvement), that adults should not mind watching too. Has a sweetness and charm reminiscent of ""Winnie The Pooh"". Would like to see more installments in the ""Pups of Liberty"" series.",1357257600,,701,5.622641509433962
8552429,5,B00AJ1OJDO,"Coming from the perspective of an animation fan and an American history fan this animated film satisfies both interests. It doesn't hurt that it is simultaneously entertaining, educational and able to be enjoyed by all ages, whether in a classroom or at home. Being produced by seasoned animation professionals the quality of its animation, storytelling, voice work and more is of superior quality and reminds the viewer of the underlying principles behind the formation of the United States of America, something that is always a timely topic.",1357171200,,544,5.264367816091954

8552433,5,B00AJ1OJDO,"PUPS is a well animated, fun and informative film from some of the modern day masters of the medium. Envisioning the American Revolution as a dog/cat battle for freedom, it puts an important and difficult to explain story in terms that children can easily understand. I highly encourage all parents to introduce this to their children as soon as possible!",1356566400,2,355,4.933333333333334
