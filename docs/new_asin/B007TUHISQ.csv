8521836,4,B007TUHISQ,"This short (50 minute) film by Tod Browning, essentially closed out the silent era as a few months later, ""The Jazz Singer"" was released.  Browning, no stranger to odd movies - ""Freaks"" anyone - delves into a story about a circus performer known as Alonzo the Armless (the great Lon Chaney).  Alonzo pretends to be armless by strapping his arms down close to his body.  He makes a living by throwing knives and shooting guns with his bare feet.  He is assisted by a dwarf named Cojo (John George) who knows his secret and the target of his knives, Nanon (a beautiful, sexy Joan Crawford), who doesn't.

Nanon has an aversion to touching men.  And while we might guess why that is, it is never hinted at in the film.  The pursuers of her charms are the strong man Malabar (Norman Kerry) as well as Alonzo.  When Alonzo figures out that Nanon doesn't like to be touched, he calculates he has a shot.  She's friendly with him, but then again, he really has arms.

Alonzo gets into a violent argument with the circus owner Zanzi (Nick De Ruiz) when the armless ruse is discovered.  One thing leads to another and Alonzo kills Zanzi.  The act is seen from a distance by Nanon, but all she seems to see is an armed man with 2 thumbs on one hand.  Yeah, Alonzo has this deformity for real.  After Alonzo confides in Cojo about his affection for Nanon, he is reminded that she is not aware of his armed status and would eventually find out.  In addition the double thumb thing would prove him a murderer.

So Alonzo concludes what any reasonable man would under the circumstances, have his arms removed.  He blackmails a surgeon he had some dirt on, and off they come.  He pretty much uses his feet anyway.  Chaney shows his physical dexterity by lighting a cigarette and smoking it with just his feet and a few other tricks.  When Alonzo returns to circus duty he discovers that Malabar is courting Nanon now that she has miraculously discarded her man-touching affliction.  This puts Alonzo into a rage and he plots to have Malabar's arms pulled off during a strong-man stunt where he ties himself to 2 horses that run in place on a treadmill, in the opposite direction.  It doesn't go well for Alonzo as Nanon discovers the plot as it is happening.

The movie certainly has a creepiness to it and it is bizarre to say the least.  Chaney is terrific and the 20 year old Crawford shows the promise that would catapult her to stardom.",1389052800,,2426,4.498855835240275
8521837,5,B007TUHISQ,"""It was just something in here that stung like the lash of a whip,"" explains Alonzo the Armless. Moments before, his grinning mask had slipped and his utter shock had peeked out and the girl he adores madly - but who now stands in another man's arms - had asked him what was up. But Alonzo recovers rapidly. The grin's back in place. Lon Chaney, acclaimed as ""The Man of a Thousand Faces,"" had the ability to instill pathos and an emotional thru arc into each of those thousand faces, most of which were of the grotesque persuasion. And so even though we identify Alonzo for the out and out villain that he is, we also sympathize with him up to a point. Chaney's remarkable knack for make-up and his uncanny grace and physicality were only parts of a whole, a gestalt that translated to his being a hell of an accomplished actor. People, I think, forget that he could act.

In the annals of disturbing cinema, director Tod Browning occupies a special corner. Most would agree that Browning's masterpiece is FREAKS. But Browning built his rep as a horror master from his collaborations with Lon Chaney, and 1927's silent thriller, THE UNKNOWN, is one of them. In THE UNKNOWN Chaney plays Alonzo the Armless, a featured attraction in Antonio Zanzi's gypsy circus. Alonzo applies his trained feet to perform amazing feats such as throwing knives and shooting guns at his lovely assistant, and this with unfailing accuracy. In a later scene, we see him strumming the guitar with his toes.

Alonzo nurses a secret. In reality he's a sought felon who has two functioning arms that he straps tightly to his torso. Okay, one hand does flaunt the deformity of two thumbs, so he actually is a physical freak. In old Spain, in each town constituting a circus stopover, Alonzo, with his dwarf accomplice Cojo, commits acts of robbery. In privacy Alonzo and Cojo exult at the stupidity of all those what they've kept fooled.

That things go off the rails for Alonzo the Armless can be backtracked to his obsession with the circus manager's beautiful daughter Nanon (a young Joan Crawford). Nanon has a phobia. She can't stand a man's hands on her person. She constantly must fight off the amourous advances of the strongman Malabar (Norman Kerry). Alonzo, being an asshat, poisons the well for Malabar. He urges the strongman to persist in his unruly courtship, knowing that this would disgust Nanon and drive her into Alonzo's armless embrace for comfort. She views Alonzo as safe haven, someone who can't manhandle her. Alonzo means to have her.

Tod Browning directs economically but brilliantly. THE UNKNOWN is about an hour long, but with a story that's complex and psychologically provoking. Lon Chaney is mesmerizing and tragic and twisted, and I can see why this thriller is often labeled as horror. I wonder where the tipping point was for Alonzo? There are at least two or three definitive moments that could've sent him over the edge. Or could it be that his descent into madness started long before the film's opening scene? Chaney is something to see, such a consummate professional. He often went to unbelievable lengths to lend authenticity to his roles. For this one, to look like he was armless he had his arms rendered immobile by a straightjacket. He did use his own feet to pull off some of Alonzo's tricks. But, for the mid- and close-up scenes, a stunt double named Peter Dismuki (who was born without arms) applied his own talented feet. And Daniel Day Lewis has got nothing on Dismuki.",1351728000,,3496,4.754530477759473
