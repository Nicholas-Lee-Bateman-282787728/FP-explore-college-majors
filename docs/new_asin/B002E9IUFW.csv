8366968,1,B002E9IUFW,$121 for 4 old movies on AMAZON!! ITs cheaper to buy them separately!! RIP OFF,1260144000,5,78,4.266666666666667
8366969,4,B002E9IUFW,"Who would pay $121 for this 4-pack?  Has Amazon gone mad?  $39.95 was a great deal and I was about to pull the trigger only to see this deal go from the sublime to the ridiculous.
Giving the 4-pack 4 stars, the original deal 5 stars but the current deal negative 1 star.  Why even bother listing it at this price?",1256256000,7,313,4.098360655737705
8366970,5,B002E9IUFW,"Ok, so yes The Invisible is a totally weird inclusion on this four pack Blu-Ray set. But three classic Shyamalan movies at less than $10 a pop makes this completely worth it for me! The regular sale price of both Signs and Sixth Sense easily tops the price of this set by at least $10. When you do the math, it's easy to see this 4-pack is an absolute steal!",1256169600,4,358,4.128571428571429
8366971,2,B002E9IUFW,"Why are they selling a 75% Shyamalan movie collection?

They took three movies by M Night Shyamalan, one thriller, one sci-fi with a couple of startling moments and one comic book movie, add in a cheesy teen drama with themes of death and call it a thriller package?
Shyamalan would be disgusted to know he is packaged with ""The Invisible"" and everyone should wonder what amazon is talking about.",1256169600,7,396,4.739130434782608
