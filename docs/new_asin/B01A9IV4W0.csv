8746728,2,B01A9IV4W0,"Very depressing and no redeeming characters.  I saw at the end it was dedicated to people that lost someone to substance abuse and obviously it was a low budget film, but I didn't realize when I rented it and was very disapointed and depressed after watching it.  Too expensive at 4.99 to rent for this type of movie.  Bad acting and lousy script.  I get the message and I've seen better Lifetime movies that dealt with the same subject, better acting and quality!",1475452800,,464,4.554216867469879
8746729,1,B01A9IV4W0,"If you would like to waste your time watching this movie go ahead. But I will never watch this movie again. Just recently rented it and it was the worst movie I've seen in years. If your looking for a movie about addiction and death then watch it, but it if you want an uplifting movie this isn't it trust me.",1464998400,,309,4.081967213114754

8746732,5,B01A9IV4W0,"The characters were believable. The story raw and real. The emotional range, numbing to explosive. Character development was adequate. There were no real bad guys here, just people dealing with there own demons and that of others. How does a mother cope with abuse and loss? An emotional roller coaster ride that climbs slowly to a peak and rushes down slope again and again. Provocative, intense with a lingering emotional imprint demanding closure.",1461283200,,450,5.178082191780822
8746733,4,B01A9IV4W0,"This is an important film speaking for the victims of dysfunctional homes, illicit drug use, and addiction.  Featuring good performances all around  and a well crafted screen play, it will grab you.",1460937600,3,198,5.15625
