8682011,4,B00O4DIAHE,"The hero of the story was a top intelligence agent in the Indian government before he was betrayed and blinded by bomb. The movie is composed of flashbacks, and as such, is a little difficult to follow. There is a good comic relief character in the form of a taxi driver who always seems to be in the right place at the wrong time.

Overall, the story is hardly original, but what sets it apart for me is the way the main character's blindness is portrayed. Unlike many films featuring a character who is blind and who commits a crime--and there are more than just a few--here, the fact that the protagonist is blind doesn't give him an automatic alibi. It is refreshing. Add that to the writers' use of ecolocation, which I've never seen shown correctly in films as accurately as this one does (though it does perhaps exaggerate a bit for dramatic purposes), I'm content. _Thaandavam_ wasn't an original movie, but it was a good one that got the facts right. If you're looking for an engaging action that doesn't promote the ridiculous stereotype of people with disabilities being unable to commit crimes, this is a good Friday-night movie for you.",1456963200,,1149,4.6600985221674875
