3627970,4,B001HB1JYC,"Chris Rock is not just a comedian. He doesn't just tell jokes (anymore). He's a truly smart guy that sees the world for what it is...and then shares his view of it with you. And the world is clearly a very very funny place.

Political views. Racial views. Religious views. Social views. His views on plain old common sense....Whether you agree with his views or not, he'll make you laugh. He might even make you mad with some of his views...but that's the point. Oh, you mean the stuff you agree with is funny, but the stuff that you don't agree with isn't??? C'mon!

Rock's 2008 HBO special Kill the Messenger is Chris Rock at his best. Some of the act does seem familiar just because (most of us?) now know his routine so well after so many fine years. You have his previous HBO specials: from ""Big *** Jokes"" 14 years ago when he used to simply ""tell jokes"", to his breakthrough specials starting in 1996 that established Rock for the unique style and delivery that he is now famous for {<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bring-The-Pain/dp/B00006HAVX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bring The Pain</a>&nbsp;(1996),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bigger-and-Blacker/dp/B0000399WN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bigger and Blacker</a>&nbsp;(1999), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Never-Scared/dp/B00026L9BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Never Scared</a>&nbsp;(2004)}. And of course you also have years and years of TV and movies to go with his signature HBO persona.

So, while some of the act may seem a bit familiar, rest assured that the subject matter is fresh. The only annoyance (albeit a slight annoyance) with the Kill the Messenger performance is the 3-venue video splicing presentation. In other words, you'll see Rock start a joke in New York, but then finish it in London or South Africa (not necessarily in that order); this splicing effect was distracting for me, but may not bother you.

So do go ahead and hit the buy button for a night of laughs if you didn't have the good fortune to catch this on HBO. One other word of caution is that the material is very timely. When the DVD is finally released in early 2009, some of it will actually be dated...mostly the pre-election stuff.",1223424000,3,2314,5.584045584045584

Additionally, I think this is his second best (after Bigger and Blacker, of course). The additional discs contain the independent performances from each location, which I enjoyed because there were a few jokes that were cut out due to the nature of the final product.

Bottom line: if you're a Chris Rock fan, get this. If you're a stand-up comedy collector, get this. If you're just a casual consumer of stand-up and just want something to entertain you for a nice night in, get the regular version, it's cheaper and still hilarious.",1368403200,3,669,4.669491525423729

He spends half his time kissing Obama's tuchus and the other half mocking George W. Bush.  I understand, it was 2008 and America was on the verge of electing its first black president.  Objectivity and facts couldn't be allowed to screw that up.  Just as an oh by the way, George W. Bush made sure that more money was funnelled into Africa than any other president in history.  As an example, the uber-liberal wackadoo ""Progressive"" actor Matt Damon said ""I would kiss George W. Bush on the mouth for his AIDS work in Africa.""  I say all this to illustrate the point that Chris Rock was far less interested in being either funny or objective and truthful here than in politicking for Obama.

My whole family laugh at this preformance at the same parts. So if you love great comedy shows and a great preformance from an amazing comedian pick this show up and laugh your butt off.  The show was film in 3 areas so the editing is little rough but still an amazing show.  So pick this up and unwind yourself after a long work week with good comedy.,1341705600,,510,4.173469387755102

3628013,3,B001HB1JYC,"What I love about Chris Rock most is his spot on insights about daily life. In this performance he reminds us of two things we waste our money on. I also loved his thoughts on George W. Bush's attitude toward the public. He has a pocket full of ___, but won't give you one. This kind of material shows off the genius and creativity of CR. My problem with this show is that he goes on too long about racial issues. The jokes just get too repetitive. If he varied his choice of topics, this performance could have been so much more interesting. Instead, he chose to stay on familiar ground and for that, this performance suffers a bit. Good, but not classic Chris Rock.",1259971200,2,667,4.344
3628014,4,B001HB1JYC,"It takes this show a while to get moving, but it does pick up nicely about 15 minutes in. The use of three different shows is interesting, but the rapid cuts get old fast and lead to unnecessary confusion.

The best performance is clearly at the Apollo, the site of Rock's greatest success, Bigger And Blacker. So why include the Jo'berg and London shows? Just to show he's an international star now? Too bad, because you can hear from his voice that Rock is most comfortable and free--and funny!--at home in NYC. His outfit in each town says it all.

When it does pick up, you can see Rock relax and start to really deliver the goods. As usual his best material is related to race and personal politics, and there are some classic bits here. The ""crease"" line is pretty special, among many.

So, while not close to the perfection and edge of B&B, and not quite as solid as Bring The Pain, this is better than Never Scared. But Chris---one show every five years? We need more of your comedy, and especially your gift for telling the truth about society, particularly America's blind greed and narcissism.

I'm not sure who came up with the idea of shooting and cutting between 3 cities but it was an extremely brave choice.  I would have thought the show was going to be jarring and the shifting from city to city would steal the thunder but i think it adds to it.  Funny is funny no matter what country you're in.  I googled the director to see what else he's done and it's a pretty amazing list.  He's done a bunch of other HBO shows including Will Ferrells new broadway show and Dane Cooks show (which i thought dane comedy lacked substance but was amazing in the round).  anyhow he's got a website where he actually responds to peoples technical questions and about the artists [...] anyhow back to Rock his comedy is still cutting edge and I was laughing my ass off the whole time.  In particular he does a bit about the rich white man that lives next door to him, I don't want to spoil it but when you see it you'll know what I'm talking about.

3628031,5,B001HB1JYC,"For Kill The Messenger, Chris Rock combines 3 performances of his 2008 ""No Apologies"" Tour, and combines them into one special.

While the splicing between the 3 locations (Johannesburg, NYC, London) in the middle of a joke can be a bit distracting, The 3 disc set comes in handy mainly because you get all 3 performance separate, the spliced HBO special and a digital copy.

Disc 1 - HBO Version - 3.5 of 5 stars. While the location switching isn't too distracting, the sound quality in Johannesburg is lower and kind of doesn't blend in as well with London And NYC. Plus, if it were up to me, I wouldn't switch locations in the middle of a joke. I'd finish a joke in one location
Disc 2 - NYC & HBO Digital copy - 5 stars - He seemed to have the best audience reaction in NYC. The digital copy is easy to use.
Disc 3 - London and Johannesburg - 4 stars each. Johannesburg's sound quality was a lot lower than NYC and London and that's what threw me off with the HBO Special. London - He probably got the worst audience reactions from London.

Anyways, Chris Rock gives another great performance with Kill the Messenger and for this 3 disc set it a much better way to go simply because all 3 performances are separate and some jokes are extended or not featured in the 1 disc (Also Disc 1 here) HBO special",1238457600,3,1307,4.326530612244898

The splicing between his different locations of his performances was smooth and unoticeable, no sound crackling and the only way i can tell that the splicing was done is that the background changes, again I don't see how its irritating when ur listening to jokes and his style of delivery reuires u to pay attention to whats being said rather than focusing so much on the visuals. As far as his delivery being the same in a previous review, why would he change about what has clearly made him a succesful comedian?

I know he says its based off some older movie called Chloe in the afternoon but the movie does match a lot of what Chris Rock says in Never Scared.
 So looking for more pearls of funny wisdom, I watched the Best of Chris Rock Show, Bring the Pain, and Kill the Messenger.
 The Chris Rock show and Bring the Pain just dragged on racism way too much.  In the Chris Rock showChris Rock says that in the early twenties African Americans were in the Olympics and yet America had the nerve to abuse African Americans in the twenties too.  It doesnt make sense to me for Americans to mistreat certain people and then have them represent America to the world in the Olympics.
 Lets talk about racism.  I think it exist but I think the people that racism hurts are the same people who keep it alive and give it power.  For example certain group of people like to call each other a certain word jokingly but if people that were outside of that certain group used the same special word then it would be a problem and likely to cause a fight.  Dont believe me?  Next time your around a group of women call one of them a B word and see what happens.  Then theres this other group of people that can call each other a certain word but if we are not part of their group then it would be big trouble for me and you.  Dont believe me?  Next time you see a police officer walk up to him and call him a pig.  Do you now see how its this exclusivity of certain words that can be only used by certain people jokingly that give the word power.  White people don't have that.  White people don't jokingly call each other cracker, which is why the word has no power.  So if there is a fight against racism then people need to look in the mirror and not use it as a crutch and blame other people.  Cartoon series Boondocks did a good episode about this asking what would MLK think if he was alive today.  I also like the episode N moment too.
 Kill the messenger was just way too much politics and when you don't know the people or keep up with that stuff then you miss the jokes",1459036800,,2299,4.123595505617978
