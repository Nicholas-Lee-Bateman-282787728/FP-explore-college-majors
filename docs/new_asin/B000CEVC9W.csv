2460534,4,B000CEVC9W,"I was really looking forward to seeing this the momnent I heard about it.  I've enjoyed the Ultimates comic books and their approach to the Avengers, and this was very loyal to the feel of the series.

In many ways, watching the flick was like watching X-Men 1, where it was necessary to establish the foundation of the team.  Ultimate Avengers offers a less fluid take with the introductions, but things mostly flow well.  Some items feel forced, but with the time frame and all that had to be accomplished, I'd say the film works.

I'm not an animation snob, so I didn't notice anything overly wrong.  U:A didn't have quite the vibrance of a JLU episode, but the darker world and tone may contribute to that as much as the ""quality"" of animation.

Overall, for the price, I think it's hard to go wrong.  You get a fresh take on some fun characters with a pretty good story, and the knowledge that the sequel will be able to accomplish much more!",1139788800,10,947,4.465116279069767
2460535,2,B000CEVC9W,"Let's get a few things out of the way:

1) Based on the ultimates - yes and no - while the costumes are those of the ultimates (mainly some tweaks and Ironman's armour is not like that of the ultimates), the characters tend to act more in keeping with those of the 616 (original avengers) than their ultimate counterpoints. All of the political sub-text has been removed and most of the more ""adult"" issues. This has been replaced by more Slam-blam action. That of course is no problem, if you like Slamblam action ! However anyone expecting it to be a very faithful adaptation of Ultimates volume 1 is going to be disappointed.

2) Animation - It's not bad but not of that standard of the preview trailers (which is odd unless the preview trailer material was produced purely for that purpose). I'll say it's competent but it never reaches the level of the Warner brothers output. There are some dodgy flight moments where Ironman just moves totally out of keeping with the direction in which his boots are pointed and thus how action-reaction would make him move (that's sounds picky but if you see the movie, you will understand what I mean, pretty glaring)

3) Speaking of Warner brothers - I'm not going to do too many spoilers but the changes to the Storyline and the sequence of events means that large elements of this seem to be *ahem* borrowed from the pilot for the JLU cartoon.

Overall - It's a passable 1hr 13minutes that fans of superhero type material will enjoy but it not's ""must watch"" or something that you are likely to again and again.

I hope this review is helpful for you.",1139788800,14,1597,4.56993006993007
2460536,5,B000CEVC9W,"Finally a movie that respects the process of adapting a successful graphic novel ('The Ultimates') to the big screen.  Not only did the producers respect the incredible original designs of Bryan Hitch and the storyline by Mark Millar but they chose to animate this movie in classic 2D hand drawn animation with such a flair that CGI lovers will do a double take.  This movie is quite an achievement as not only is it Marvel's entree into feature length animation but it aims to please fan boys and general audiences alike...and it does so successfully.  Fan boys will appreciate the homage's throughout while all will love this action packed, well paced debut piece and it is destined to be a classic as it is just the beginning of Marvel's commitment to this new genre.  The choice of using working actors and not 'stars' to voice the characters is a winner as the true stars of this movie are the classic marquee characters Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Giant Man, Black Widow, Wasp and the Incredible Hulk.  This non-stop, smart, fun ride is the first time the Avengers appear together in a movie and they don't disappoint.  This is no extended TV episode ala the Batman DTV films, but a truly emotional, hard hitting story. Without being gratuitous, a strong and engaging story with surprisingly balanced screen time for its ensemble cast.  The music and sound design are on par with any major studio feature.  In fact, this movie seems to be all that which $100million live action studio pictures try to achieve but would never be able to as this movie would be unproducable in live action ...which is all the more reason to appreciate the producer's choice of animation.",1139356800,11,1679,4.76551724137931
2460537,4,B000CEVC9W,"No one knows anything about this movie. It hasn't been released yet. Either wait for it to come out THEN read the reviews, or just buy it.

There was an article in Wizard Magazine about this. They (producers) said they wanted to keep the movie as close to the comic as possible. Some things were changed (like Giant Man being naked) to avoid problems with parents or the FCC or something like that. But in general, it's supposed to be much like the comic. Screen shots were also featured in the article, they were almost mirror images of the comic book panels. So maybe it will be a lot like it. Even if it's not exactly like it, I'm getting it anyway because I'm a fan of Marvel, The Avengers, and The Ultimates.",1139356800,7,713,4.360902255639098
2460538,3,B000CEVC9W,"Okay, maybe for those of you who just looked at all the pretty pictures in Ultimates Vol #1 this will in fact be a direct adaptation for you.  However, for those of you who actually read the book, you're probably gonna be a little dissapointed.  Read my review and you'll see why.  All these other reveiwers obviosly haven't seen the movie, they've all just read articles about how cool it's supposed to be and have hyped themselves up so high that I think they're gonna feel like crying once they've seen the actual movie.  Just so everyone knows this movie is loosely based on Marvels ""Ultimates"" series one written by Mark Millar.  I say loosely because it only takes some of the elemants from that series like costumes. Most everything else is different, even the origins of the team itself is different from in the book.  Some of the crucial parts of the series that really gave it it's originality is completly left out, such as the domestic abuse between ""Giant Man & Wasp"".  I was under the impression this movie was an animated feature geared mainly towards adults.  In some ways I suppose maybe yes, there is maybe some subject matter still left in tact, but definately still geared for a family audiance.  this is not a direct a straight adaptation of the book like I'd heard so much about, some of the visual scenes in the book are there, but not in the same context as in the book.  The other thing about this that bummed me out was the animation.  I heard all this talk about how Lions Gate was using some special state of the art animation, and what you get here is no better than your average saturday morning cartoon stuff.  It honestly looks to me like it was done by the same guys who did the X-Men, Spider Man, Iron Man, Hulk, & Fantastic 4 in the 90's & those shows weren't pretty, this movie may be a step(a small step) above those series.  Basically if you're looking for this to be Mark Millar's Ultimates you might be disapointed, the movie is still entertaining, I guess I was just hoping the film would be a little more faithful to the books original content.  We get to thank Lions Gate yet again for getting our hopes up and letting us down for another less than spectacular straight to video release. Okay I can see if this were a live action film, certain things would have to change obviously.  Comics just don't translate to film as well as we'd all hope they would.  However with this movie being animated, not to mention the fact that this book was practically written to be translated to film, there's really absolutely no excuse for altering the story here at all.  I'd have been okay if the changes were just cutting ""Naked Giant-Man"" or ""Hulk Horny"", these issue's I can see maybe changing if need be for the censor's.  They've altered the story so much; why not just call the movie The Avengers, and leave anything Ultimate out of the picture altogether?  It just really bothers me how badly Lions Gate has intentionally raped this project.  Hopefully another more competent studio will bring us a live action ""Ultimates"" in the future, until then Lions Gate can just about garuntee I'll be skipping the other 5 animated features including ""Ultimate Avengers 2""(How awful does that look?)",1138924800,5,3228,4.580869565217391
2460539,4,B000CEVC9W,"First I'd like to say grifterb Milton is incorrect. Marvel's ultimate line started with Spider-man then moved on to the X-Men then the Ultimates, which is the the basis for Ultimate Avengers.

If you watch the trailer or stills, this film has been toned down from the source material to be perhaps a bit more adult than the Justice League cartoons. You should definitely read the comics.",1138579200,4,387,4.776119402985074
2460540,3,B000CEVC9W,"Just wanted to add my two cents as a fanboy:  please note this animated feature follows the storyline of The Ultimates, a kind of parallel Marvel Universe Avengers than the one most people know.

Basically, a couple of years ago Marvel Comics started publishing a line of comics with the ""Ultimate"" title, beginning with the X-Men (ie: Ultimate X-Men).  This line was meant to be a starting off point for new readers with age-old Marvel characters set in contemporary times, like Peter Parker getting his powers in the new millenium, and eliminating the need for new readers to sift through the vast history of the Marvel Universe to understand what was going on.  Some names and characters from the Old Marvel U would look familiar but their origins and storylines would vary in this new Ultimates universe (take for example the Gwen Stacy storyline in ""classic"" Marvel U and her storyline in the Ultimate universe)

Ultimate X-Men proved so popular Marvel has done Ultimate Spiderman and also a title just called The Ultimates, which is this line's take on the Avengers.  The Ultimates is a VERY adult-leaning comic and I suspect they've had to tone some of that down for the animated feature, but if you want to brush up on what you'll be getting into, there are currently four, I believe, volumes available in paperback.  Even if the video sucks, do yourself a favor and pick up the books; they're a good read and great artwork.",1138579200,4,1432,4.77327935222672
2460541,5,B000CEVC9W,"The violence on this is good. Could stand for a touch more though. I didn't like How some of the characters have changed from the old comics but I can deal with some of it. Nick Fury is not the one I remember and this character is inferior to the original by far but what ya gonna do? What threw me back was the way they have disrespected the Mighty Thor. They have turned him into a pansy liberal protestor guy, deprived him of his original colors, winged helmet and cape, and allowed the Hulk to pick up his hammer and hit him with it. Bruce Banner is strung out and Captain Americas voice is weak and unheroic. A lot of these things I don't like probably come straight from the Ultimates comic so I have to give the movie 5 stars. Im glads to see Marvel releasing this stuff and look forward to more. If I have to rate the current marvel characterizations however thats a big ZERO. No gonads. The movie itself is an excelent straight to dvd production not movie theater quality here but far better than television stuff. Yeah, I like it.",1138492800,5,1040,4.311224489795919
2460542,5,B000CEVC9W,"FYI, that footage John Q. was talking about from the comic con was just the test animation done when the studio first got the assignment.  Just wait and see the final product for yourselves and ignore the fanboy ranting.  Honestly, you'd think he'd at least wait until the film is released before he starts picking it apart.  He sounds like the Comic Book Guy on the Simpsons.",1137715200,27,376,4.582089552238806

2460915,4,B000CEVC9W,"In World War II, the Nazis tried to launch an intercontinental missile and was thwarted by Captain America, but at great cost: Captain America fell into icy waters and was presumed dead. Some sixty years later, he was found and revived by S.H.I.E.L.D., who ends up convincing him to join their fight against the alien Chitauri. When the Chitauri attack, S.H.I.E.L.D. implements Project Avenger and begins assembling together Earths Mightiest Heroes to take on the Chitauri and put a stop to them once and for all.

This ensemble flick is one of the greats and is a solid introduction for the uninitiated to the AvengersCaptain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Giant Man, Wasp and Hulkall led by Nick Fury.

Its evenly paced, exciting, and gives each member of the team enough screen time to give them a chance to lock in with the viewer and make that viewer-character connection before moving on to the next guy.

Marvels direct-to-video efforts have been lacking and haven't been that great because theyve been very busyalbeit very successfullyfocusing their efforts on bringing their heroes to the big screen. Ultimate Avengers and its sequel are the major exceptions to their animated shortcomings and this movie is every bit as good as their live action counterparts. I also think thats the secret to making a good animated movie: treat it with the same care and seriousness as a live action film and youll hit it out of the ballpark every time. It works in Japanese animation. No reason why it wouldnt work here in the West.

This movie was good start to finish. Had a story that spanned decades, and made you care about what was going on from first frame to last.

You have multiple plotlines going on, ranging from the Avengers dealing with the Chitauri to Bruce Banner trying to find a cure for the Hulk, to Captain America trying to find his place in the world. The amazing thing is they fit all these plotlines into a very short runtime (just over an hour).

The art direction was superb and I enjoyed how everyone looked in this, especially Hulk. (For me, hes one of those guys that don't always come out well.)

While theres a pretty good dose of violence in this movie, its much more kid-friendly than the majority of DCs animated features and is safe for kids (depending on your household rules for this sort of thing). Personally, I let my kids watch it but don't let them watch the DC movies.

Whether a Marvel fan, an Avengers fan, or a superhero fan in general, Ultimate Avengers is a fantastic flick worth watching many times over. Whats cool is its basically part one of two and goes right into its sequel, Ultimate Avengers 2: Rise of the Panther, without missing a beat, so if you have both, you're in for a doubly-good time.

The animation was good and The Avengers were well-developed, but their foes were aliens, which did not make for very entertaining storytelling.

2461006,3,B000CEVC9W,"I didn't care for this new and unimproved origin story for the Avengers. The original story seemed to flow better, the interpersonal relationships were more complex and interesting, and the spectre of 911 obviously didn't exist in a tale written in the early 1960's. Rewriting Bruce Banner's character into that of a man almost without principles, willing to do anything to get his way makes him into a darker and in my opinion less interesting character.

Turning the Avengers into an arm of the military without uniforms or rank is a mistake.

The animation was good, voices adequate if uninspired. Cap seemed to adjust to his 60+ year sleep a bit too easily. Thor, defender of Whales is out of character in the Norse Pantheon-he wasn't a sea or water god.

2461028,4,B000CEVC9W,"First we start off with part 1 which tells in the beginning of how Captain America was once a soldier in 1943 until he was frozen in the ocean for many years until he gets thawed out now by a New York government agency called SHIELD lead by Nick Fury. He assembles new recruits like Black Widow, Thor,  Giant-Man with his wife Wasp and Tony Stark/Iron Man into the team, however Dr. Bruce Banner with Betty Ross are working for a way to control the Hulk while a a deadly race of aliens are trying to take over Earth, the Avengers must deal with the intrduers from space including with the Hulk. Next in Ultimate Avengers 2, an African prince who is now known as Black-Panther has his kingdom under threat from the same alien forces in the first movie as he wants Fury and the Avengers to battle this menace.

Both movies are based on Marvel's ""The Ultimates"" by Mark Millar which which is Ultimate version of ""The Avengers"", these 2 animated Marvel movies are very entertaining and action packed. The animation in both are quite good and the storytelling is good, the first movie develops the characters we all know but very different from the original Avengers comics many Marvel fans are familar with but remember, this is based on Ultimate Avengers. Part 2 is slightly better as it introduces the underrated Marvel hero BlackPanther and has some intense moments plus drama to it but both movies are worth watching.

This Blu-Ray contains both movies on one disc, the picture is terrific and the sound is sharp. The extras are gag reel and 3 featurettes with Trivia track on both films.",1338768000,,1588,4.604240282685512
2461029,4,B000CEVC9W,"Really didn't follow The Avengers growing up. Was more of a Spidey and X-men fan. I must say that I've really enjoyed the big screen Iron Man films, and to a lesser extent Thor and Captain America. Decided to watch this one over the weekend to gear up for the big screen, live-action Avengers flick. It wasn't bad. The one thing that animation always has going for it is that you can do pretty much anything. I'll grant you that CGI is getting there, but animated features still rule the school yard in this arena.

I wasn't used to seeing such a neurotic Bruce Banner, but the rest of the characters were pretty much spot on. Thor was a little flaky... But Tony Stark was the playboy alcoholic, Black Widow was the seductive, yet deadly spy. Captain America bled red, white, and blue. The team was well represented, even if there were some substitutions between the animated and live action line-ups.  The Hellicarrier was great. Nick Fury was the more modern Sam Jackson director, than the ""grey around the temples"" Fury that so many of us grew up with. To remain spoiler-free, can I say that the final conflict stretched believability just a bit, even in a superhero universe. Still, it was a fun ride.

A strong voice cast, including Grey DeLisle, OLivia D'Abo, and Justin Gross really brings this animated flick home. If you're a fan of the House that Stan Built, you could do lots worse than to sit down and chew some popcorn with this Avenger outing !",1336435200,,1458,4.578544061302682
2461030,3,B000CEVC9W,"After reading several Amazon comments what astounds me is that so few understand that this film is supposed to be an Ultimates film and not an Avengers film, but I guess that's Marvels fault. I've watched the film, read the Ultimates comics, read the Avengers comics and see that the film is an attempted mishmash of both comics. This film is supposed to be an adaptation of the first story arc of the Ultimates comic book. Because this book takes place in another universe from the traditional Marvel universe,the characters are different versions of the Avengers called the Ultimates. They have different costumes(ie wasp, giant man, captain america, iron man), races(ie fury=black, wasp=asian), personalities(banner=neurotic mess, giant man=dick, thor=hippie, captain america=gun using military man) and situations(ie the team working for the government and the origins of giant man, wasp and hulk). Thus, the characters in the film started patterned on the characters of that universe. Unfortunately, in an attempt to make the characters more recognizable to the casual viewer Marvel attempted to mix in traits and situations of the regular Avengers cast to the detriment of both versions. The casual viewer is left wondering why the characters are so different from the traditional take and the Ultimates fan is left to wonder why the characters and situations they enjoyed reading have been so whitewashed and twisted to better fit the traditional characters. Had Marvel stuck to its guns to either do an Avengers OR an Ultimates film it could have let either casual or diehard viewers know to expect a different set of characters than they are used to rather than confuse and disappoint both. Marvel seems to have intentionally confused both types of viewers so both would buy the film. This can easily seen by the title. Rather than call it ""The Ultimates"" (as the team is never called the Avengers in the alternate universe)it's called ""Ultimate Avengers"" confusing viewers as to what version of the characters to expect. That said the film is actually good for the attempted mishmash it is the pacing, art and voices were good. As I was expecting the Ultimates, I just wish they had chosen to focus more on those versions of the characters and feel more than alittle deceived that they advertised as much.",1336003200,2,2315,5.078740157480315

2461032,4,B000CEVC9W,"Ultimate Avengers wasn't a total waste of time - if you're on a super hero high, then this might be the movie to help you wean off your obsession.

The animation was fairly pretty, but I would suggest almost any other movie for better, if not more consistent, shading and coloring. I'll admit it's been a few weeks since I actually watched the movie, but I remember it being kinda sloppy at points.

My biggest problem, however, was how the show devolved into ""let's all beat up the Hulk."" Does this always happen when he's involved? It's a waste of time and I'd rather see the team fighting the bad guys instead of each other.

All in all, if you're looking for something exciting and entertaining, I'd pass on this movie and go to a free anime streaming site like Crunchyroll and watch something else.",1335225600,2,803,4.524137931034483

These two films had a lot of potential but they just never delivered. It felt like I was watching a seriously edited version of a longer story that felt rushed and inconsistent. If you're not already familiar with the characters this isn't going to do much for you. The only real back story that's provided is on Captain America and The Black Panther.  The other characters get little (if any) exposition on their origins powers. The animation seems oddly inconsistent as well; in some places the quality is very good and in others it's sloppy, poorly shaded, and just plain boring.

I found the whole story for both films to be really rushed, and the villains were boring and uninspired (aliens... rly?). I would have much preferred the villains to be comic book villains we all know. They also made several characters quite annoying and unlikable (Bruce Banner/Hulk, Hank Pym, Black Widow), I don't know if those were products of the comic reboot, but I didn't care for it.

I did give it 3 stars, rather than 1, because the action was pretty good, there were some touching moments, and Cpt America was a likeable character.",1278806400,,723,4.511450381679389
2461051,2,B000CEVC9W,"While managing to introduce some famous superheroes, Ultimate Avengers feels rushed and the characters underused.  It has moments but never takes the time to develop anyone other than Captain America, Nick Fury and Bruce Banner.  This is partly due to the film itself, and partly because it was released before major motion pictures Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk.  After witnessing Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man, the Tony Stark here was incredibly disappointing.  Bruce Banner is exceptionally whiny, and Thor is hardly even in the movie.  However, there are some great moments with Wasp and Giant-Man and I appreciated being introduced to Black Widow.

The other aspects of the film are so-so.  The art itself works pretty well, but most of the military equipment is drawn with cgi and apparently no effort was made to blend the two styles together.  The story is adequate but its pacing helter skelter.  I'm not very familiar with the Avengers, (I've read a few of the first issues, watched a few tv episodes, etc) so I at least appreciated getting to know some lesser known heroes and seeing the characters work as a team.  I won't give away what it is, but the end fight is particularly impressive.

Overall, I enjoyed watching it but left feeling empty. Ultimate Avengers is worth seeing if you're a fan or want a quick introduction to the Avengers, but nothing worth adding to your DVD library.  I'd recommend seeing Avengers just because your appreciation of Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and the new Marvel films will be much, much higher.",1278720000,2,1551,4.855513307984791

2461063,1,B000CEVC9W,"Ok - I'll admit that I really liked comic books as a kid in the 70s and I was into the Avengers, Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Spiderman, etc.  Well I say this on Blockbuster and decided to rent it because I thought interesting.  Well I'm really glad I didn't buy it because I really didn't like it.  First of all it changed characters in a way that I really didn't like.  Captain America was OK but seemed to second guess himself more than I remember.  Ironman was dumb, weak, and an unlikeable person.  Same for Ant Man.  Banner was a whining, rat faced, weak and dislikeable character.  Nick Furry was now a young black man and a general to boot.  Maybe like a Doctor Who time lord he regenerated.  Thor was a hippie nut case that got knocked out permanently by the Hulk with Thor's own hammer?  I don't remember the Hulk ever being able to lift Thor's hammer and he tried many times in the comics I read as a kid.  The plot made no sense.  Aliens from WWII try to nuke the Allies, Capt America stops them and gets frozen (I remember him getting frozen but where's the Red Skull?), the aliens are still on earth with only 3 ships and SHIELD is trying to track them, their ships are made of a metal that absorbs all energy directed at it but Thor takes one out with lighting(???),Iron Man's armor get's dented by the Hulk (I remember Iron Man knocking the Hulk out with that armor once?), etc.

Well I'm too old to know that Marvel decided it was time to shake things up and create a new story called The Ultimates which loosely bases itself on the original Avengers.  Once I googled it and read what it was all about, I figured out that this movie is based on The Ultimates without the dark attitudes from the comics.  Thor is now a green peace wuzie who may be actually a mental patient, Iron Man is a drunk dark figure, Capt America is an over zealot nationalist, Banner is insecure whining weakling, Giant-Man is an arrogant idiot, and not they fight against the ""Chitauri"" who look a lot like HP Lovecraft's Cthulhu (oops - I said his name so I guess he's going to eat my soul).

Well what can I say, I'm glad I didn't read this dribble of the times.  I don't care to waste my limited time for entertainment reading about how there really are no ""noble"" heroes anymore and the world and the people in it suck.  If that's what the world was really like, then let the aliens have it and destroy it because it's basically a hell on earth.

Anyways, returning to the movie, it tries to go off the dark version as portrayed by The Ultimates but is scared to go there fully so it straddles it with the pseudo noble characters of the original Avengers.  I my opinion it fails miserably because for people like me who do not like The Ultimates and like the original Avengers, this movie sucks and is inconsistent with what we know from the comics.  For the people who like the darker Ultimates and hate the boy scouts of the original Avengers, they won't like this movie because it didn't go far enough.  All in all the movie stinks.",1273104000,11,3024,4.322695035460993

My wife and I have several animated Marvel and DC movies (Green Lantern, Superman/Batman PE, Planet Hulk, etc...) on blu-ray and they're beautiful, very crisp and vivid.  These movies are lacking a little in the crisp and vivid department.  I doubt it's because both movies are on one disc - a blu-ray should have more than enough space for two shorter movies and still have a better picture quality.

It's not bad, and the price isn't terrible, but unless you're trying to get more blue cases on your shelf, maybe stick with DVD and the upconvert?",1272844800,3,811,4.56551724137931
2461065,1,B000CEVC9W,"I would first like to say that I write this as a fan of the original comics on which this movie was (quite loosely) based, ""The Ultimates.""

With that said, I was very, very disappointed in this work.  Here are the disappointments (trying not to give any spoilers for those who do not heed my rating):

1. Animation.  Just because you add shadows to a work, it doesn't make it good.  The animation in this was choppy, inconsistent, and poorly done.

2. Casting.  When tiny, scrawny Bruce Banner has a lower voice than Captain America, there's a problem.

3. Story.  This is the most disappointing, so I saved it for last.  The story is simplistic to the point of pain, and makes little to no sense if you are watching with even half a brain.  My buddy, his 10-year-old son, and I were all watching, and even the 10-yr-old said it made no sense.

4. ""Ultimate.""  The art on the cover led me to believe that this was an adaptation of the comic, ""The Ultimates.""  It was as far from it as could be, which was the least of the disappointments, but on top of everything else?

I actually threw this one in the garbage after watching it.",1267747200,,1131,4.3701923076923075

In 'Ultimate Avengers,' General Fury assembles a group of reluctant superpowered heroes to protect the world from an alien threat. In the second film, 'Ultimate Avengers II,' Black Panther defies tradition and requests help from the outside world when the same aliens attack his country. The stories are wonderful even though they fall short of the source material. The animation is lacking and should have been better.

BLU RAY THOUGHTS: This is easy...even though all the special features from both dvd's are carried over...IT IS NOT UPGRADE WORTHY! On a side note, if you don't own it, the quality is marginally better than DVD and the price is attractive for 2 films.",1265414400,2,829,5.007246376811594
2461068,3,B000CEVC9W,"Here we have two animated Avengers movies on one blue ray disc. The first movie was an acceptable origin story for both Cap and the Avengers. The second movie introduced the Black Panther, recycled the same enemy introduced in the first film, lack any real plot and was a bit difficult to sit through at times. (Not unlike DC's New Frontier and Batman Gotham Knights, which were horrible) The Avengers was Marvel's first attempt in the Direct-to-DVD market, and should be seen as such. Although they have their issues, I'd definately recommend this disc. The films have good character designs, good voice acting and smooth animation. Since its release, Marvel animated films have improved by leaps and bounds. Consider Iron Man, Doctor Strange, the New Avengers and Hulk VS. Each subsequent film has gotten better, especially the second part of Hulk VS., where the Hulk ends up in Asgard and goes head to head against the Mighty Thor.

2461069,4,B000CEVC9W,"Given that my first job as a young teenager was at a comic book store, and my favorite comic was The Avengers, the Ultimate Avengers should have been right up my alley.  The result, however, is a confusing attempt to blend styles and cater to mixed audiences.  At parts I was incredibly interested, caught up in the nostalgia of Marvel comics, and at other times I was somewhat aggravated with the efforts.  Overall I'd say it's still fairly great, but there are a few aspects that don't

When a ""Super-Serum"" is used to turn a WWII era U.S. soldier into Captain America, the Nazis quickly meet their match.  Unfortunately for the Captain, the Nazis have aliens called the Chitauri on their side, and a nuclear warhead.  While thwarting the enemy's efforts the Cpt. Gets knocked unconscious and falls from the sky, landing in freezing water where he is preserved in a glacier.  Fast forward to the future where Gen. Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. is pressing Dr. Bruce Banner to complete the serum.  After multiple failures, and a discover/dethawing of Cpt. America, Fury is forced to compile a crew of superheroes to combat the Chitauri.  Among those recruited for Project Avenger are: Cpt America, Natalia Romanov - Black Widow, Hank Pym - Ant Man (Giant Man), Janet Van Dyne-Pym - Wasp, Tony Stark - Iron Man, and Thor.

Despite initial difficulties with teamwork and leadership, not to mention subsequent setbacks when encountering the Chitauri, the team - along with a little help from an unexpected, albeit angry visitor - comes together for the triumphant final battle.  Only then do they face the real battle, versus a completely enraged, absolutely P.O.'d Hulk.

The story and action are great.  Good enough for an actual motion picture (perhaps when the X-Men run their course).  The characters and animation, on the other hand, are irritating and lacking, respectively.  Nick Fury, a cigar-chomping white guy, is turned into a bald black guy with an eye patch.  Completely pointless change.  And Thor is made out to be a drunken, deranged idiot, someone protesting like an indoctrinated college student.  The animation is sketchy at best.  Some scenes are flawless, while others look like they were handed off to the B-Team of animators.  Several walking scenes are painfully choppy, like flipbook animation, but other scenes - like the final battle - are absolutely epic.

NOTEWORTHY SPECIAL FEATURES:

*Avengers Assemble - Great history lesson of the Avengers, completely awesome and worth the viewing

*The Ultimate Voice Talent Search - Mostly a collection of voice submissions by hopeless morons who better hope their videos don't make it to Youtube.  There is one guy, however, who is absolutely BRILLIANT.  He recites the Thor lines with perfect impersonations of Sean Connery, William Shatner, Yoda, and Christopher Walken.

2461070,3,B000CEVC9W,"This movie is kind of hard to review. Because it's two things. It's both an Ultimates movie and an Avengers movie.

As an adaptation of the Ultimates this is absolutely terrible. This loses everything that makes that series good. Mature and updated/realistic take son the classic characters. Dealings with political, ethical, and social issues. And great dialouge.  You'll find none of that in here. And one of the things that really agravates me is that in the special features the creators are like ""The opening scene is almost panel for panel the opening of the comics. But it's really not important how much you can match up panel for panel"" Yeah that's because that scene is the ONLY one that's really taken from the Ultimates. That and fighting Hulk at the end. This is really just a joke as an adaptation.

As an adapation of the Avengers it's ok. I mean it's nothing really great but it's ok.

I belive another reviewer nailed it when they said this is too dark for most kids and too childish for older fans. All and all I'd say ether get it from teh library or the bargain bin.",1257811200,,1086,4.553846153846154

2461072,3,B000CEVC9W,"I'm a big fan of animated superhero shows, so I jumped at this DVD.  The movie was good but somewhat disappointing.  The story starts off very well with a brief history of Captain America then around 3/4 of the way through, I lost interest.  I still enjoyed the movie but I guess I was expecting more.

I guess my main disappointment was with the characters.  I liked Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor.  Black Widow was okay but I didn't really see how she fit in with a group of ""super"" heroes.  I found the characters of Bruce Banner and Hank Pym to be extremely annoying with all their whining.  The Wasp was also a questionable character.  I don't have any really problem with her but neither did I really like her.  I wish they had chosen another Avengers line-up to do a movie about.  I'd rather have seen Ms. Marvel, Spider-Woman, or the Scarlet Witch.

The animation and voice actors were good.  The WWII battle scenes and the final fight scene are really well done.  The storyline is interesting but the ending seemed a little rushed.  One minute the team is in a sort of training phase and everyone is bickering then, all of a sudden, its the final fight sequence.  My favorite parts are those featuring Thor.  The dramatic opera music that plays when he is in action is just perfect and he seems to be the funniest/most entertaining of all the heroes.  Unfortunately, he only appears for a few minutes, altogether, and I'd really love to see more about him.

As for special features, there is a Trivia Track that you can play during the movie.  Instead of having an audio commentary, there are bubbles that pop up containing facts about The Avengers comic books, the characters, or the making of the movie.  For me, they made the movie a little more enjoyable.  There is also a featurette, called ""Avengers Assemble,"" which really has nothing to do with the movie.  It features comic book artists and writers discussing The Avengers comic books.  It's somewhat interesting but I suspect that long-time Avengers fans will appreciate it more than the average viewer.

""The Ultimate Voice Talent Search"" features videos of Avengers fans submitting auditions for the film.  Some are a bit strange but most are funny.  There is a brief preview for the sequel, Ultimate Avengers II, which has commentary by the film's creators.  There is also a DVD-Rom game, ""What Avenger Are You?"" which asks you a series of questions.  Based on your answers, it tells you which Avenger you most resemble.  I took the test 3 times, giving slightly different answers and came up with Mantis, Mockingbird, and Starfox.

2461106,4,B000CEVC9W,"To the nay-sayers who think that animation can't be better on Blu-ray, I say pick up this or any other Marvel animated film and see the difference.

I've been reading Marvel Comics since I was ten, and I have to say I'm really impressed with these two films.  To be honest, I wish there was a third, just because they've done such a good job of bringing the Avengers into the 21st century.  None of this would have been possible if it weren't for the creators of the Ultimates comics, which there's a great featurette on the disc about their contributions to the Ultimate line of comics.

The plot of both of these films is deeply involved in an invasion by a species called the Ch'tauri and their involvement in Earth's history since World War II.  I won't spoil the stories, but basically, the first film is centered around Captain America's resurrection in the present day, and his involvement with the fight against the Ch'tauri both now and in the past.  The second film is primarily about the Black Panther and the fight that Wakanda has had against the Ch'tauri and how the Avengers help to protect Wakanda.  I know it's boiled down and basic, but if you want a detailed synopsis, I would imagine there are other reviews that have them.",1234051200,3,1243,4.572072072072072

Pity they had to kill one the minor charachters at the end but it did give it a dramatic turn one wouldn't expect from these kind of non-rated films.

The animation is near-perfect, razor-sharp picture, great colors and all and the sound, if lacking a little bottom end for the sound effects like explosions, gunshots , thuds and thumps on the 2.0 mix is superb anyway, and mega-loud to boot !

2461113,5,B000CEVC9W,"I really do not care what other reviewers here say, I personally think this is a great little DVD. It has my favorite character of all-time, Iron Man, and also making a rare appearance in an animated cartoon, is the god of thunder himself, Thor. The story is nothing extraordinary, but the plot moves along at a great pace and has plenty of action. Of course The Hulk steals the show at the end when he destroys everything in sight and no one can stop him.

Captain America is discovered frozen in ice and is revived. Not because SHIELD misses him and the world needs a hero, but because the alien threat that was aiding the Nazis in World War II are back and they need Captain America's help. On a side note SHIELD also needs Captain America's DNA to create more super soldiers, because no one could figure out how to replicate him. Dr. David Banner is entrusted to lead the program, but unknown to everyone, he is really working on a way to control The Hulk, and he thinks Captain America's DNA is the key.

General Fury recruits attempts to recruit a team to battle the aliens, but no one seems interested, not Iron Man, Thor, or Giant Man, but eventually they come together. However they blow their first assignment because no one wants to take orders from Captain America, instead of being a team, they all work on their own. This causes the aliens to steal all of SHIELDS data and get away.

The final fight has the aliens attacking the city. The Avengers are fighting them off pretty good, but it is The Hulk that flattens them and their ships. The Hulk goes on a rampage and no one can stop him, not even Thor. Hulk throws Thor and then actually picks up his hammer to use against him, Iron Man is beaten until he looks like an old tin can, Captain America gets thrown all over the place, Giant man gets a broken knee and is choked. WASP goes into Hulks ear to distract him long enough for a sedetive to be administered, and it still takes Dr. Banner's pretty assistant to finally calm him down.

So if you are looking for a good comic book type story with plenty of action, I highly recommend this. Great to watch with the kids. My daughter always laughs when Iron Man is flying and Giant Man comes from behind a building and says 'Hello there' and swats him down to the street.",1211328000,,2287,4.374117647058823

However, I truly enjoyed reading the trade paperback that collects issues 1-6 of ""The Ultimates"" (four stars out of five), which is based on The Avengers. The story significantly tweaked the team's origins, but gave older readers a basis of comparison to earlier adventures.

The comics and movie don't differ too much. In the film, SHIELD military commander Nick Fury (voiced by Andre Ware) assembles The Avengers to take down an alien threat. Each of the heroes (except Captain America) show contempt for Fury, but the writers don't explain why there is bad blood.

The team, in its first mission, lives up to Fury earlier calling them ""showboaters ... who won't take orders from me or anyone else"" after they fail to stop an alien from sabotaging a remote military base.

The Avengers' confrontation with The Hulk is more violent than, but just as ""fun"" as, the published version. The heroes coordinate their efforts under Cap's leadership, but the writers again ""drop the pen"" by not explaining the sudden change in motivations.

The reason for The Hulk's comics rampage is downright silly since Banner is enraged enough to turn into the super-powered monster because his estranged girlfriend is dating Freddie Prinze Jr. In the movie, Banner says he can control The Hulk while battling the aliens. The battle ends with the clich of beauty calming the beast.

Sadly, the ""Ultimate Avengers"" creators commit the most unforgivable cinematic sin: It's forgettable and leaves me longing for the live-action Avengers and Captain America films being developed.",1175817600,,1630,5.112781954887218

The story is very detailed and goes from Captain America in WW2 to the exciting battle between the Avengers and the Hulk. It goes through the history of the Avengers and how the team formed, according to this story anyway. The voice acting in the movie is really good and features some known names such as Michael Massee (24, The Crow) for example. Overall, if you are fan, this is for you! The special features are great, especially ""Assembling the Avengers"" which is a short history of the series all the way up to `The New Avengers'.

Overall, this is a well put together animated feature - some of the animation initially looks limited (still equal or better to any japanese anime) but the action is well storyboarded and the climactic battle with the Hulk is as good as any animated action scene I've seen.  Tightly paced, well characterised - nice sound effects - I enjoyed it.  Yes, it could've been longer, but that's what sequels are for.

It was dreadful from the very beginning to the very end: poorly drawn, no plot, no character development and mediocre villians.

Why did Bruce Banner look like a reject from Eon Flux, why was Thor drinking beer the whole time and why was he hanging out with a group of environmentalists when he is a norse God? If the villians were an advanced race of super-alliens, why were they defeated in 4 minutes?  Why were Iron Man and Giant Man made to be so unlikeable?

Don't buy it, don't rent it; if I were you I would forget that it was ever made.

2461222,3,B000CEVC9W,"I have always been a fan of Marvel superheroes, but stuck more to X-men and Fantastic Four as far as super teams went.  However, with both of those teams getting their own live action movies, and loving super hero animation, I couldn't resist checking this out.

The Avengers team is a little different than I remembered.  My first reaction was, where's Ant-Man, Hawkeye, The Vision?  But I suppose this is Ultimate Avengers and this particular team has always had a rotating roster.

The animation was great, always pleasing to the eye, and very anime style.  The voice acting was really solid too and they were able to sneak a little personality into the characters amongst the action.  Speaking of the action, it was pretty solid.  Without giving away too much, the best part being when the Hulk goes on a rage induced rampage.  I really enjoyed the new spin on Captain America's history as well.  Keeping his origin the way it was, but enabling him to move fluidly into the modern age.

The primary villain however are my least favorite aspect of the movie.  I will say this, the primary plot of this movie is seeing how the Avengers team assembled.  But in any good super hero storyline, your villain has to be just as interesting as your heroes, and that's not the case here.  The nemesis is this case being aliens, and they're just not interesting.  Yeah, they may look cool, but how many times can you do a story about alien invasion before it starts to feel stale?

Overall, a lot of good aspects to it, but I can only hope that now that the team is formed, the sequel has a lot more in store for us.",1170892800,,1609,4.496551724137931

There are differences from the original, but none so bad as to ruin the story, and some are changes for the better.

About the movie itself... it is well done.  The 2D animation is superb and is more ""comic book"" than had they chosen the trendy 3D computer animation we see nowadays.  The story is nice and flows well.  I enjoyed it, and the sequel, a great deal.  You will find Captain America, Iron Man, Giant Man, the Wasp, and the Black Widow as Avenger members.  The Hulk is in the movie, though not as a member.  Nick Fury is also in the story as the ""founder"" of the team.  If you enjoyed the comic, or if you still DO, this will certainly please you.

2461251,3,B000CEVC9W,"Ultimate Avengers: The Movie is an engrossing animated feature that brings to life the Marvel magazine of the same name.  However, creative changes have been made, and these may annoy some hardcore fans of the Avengers characters.  Besides changes of race to Nick Fury and Janet Pym (Wasp), I can't say another biggie.

Some reviewers complained about a) not enough character development and b) poor animation.  Both these claims are bogus, as the animation is excellent in both line drawing, color, and depth.  Character development is enhanced if you turn on the English subtitles.  Instead of dialouge, there are trivia balloons that pop up periodically with intriguing information about the History of the Avengers, specific changes made for the animated feature, and character information.  This is especially useful for someone unfamiliar with the series.

There is a lot of violence and sexuality.  The two female superheroes have huge perky breasts, and one scene involves blatant seduction.  In battle scenes, soldiers die.  An astronaut desperately screams she is ""burning up"" as aliens attack a space station.  In some of the most violent cartoon scenes I have ever seen, the Hulk goes bananas on his teammates, going for blows to the head, the knee, the throat.  This is not kid stuff.  Neither is the poignant story of the return of Captain America to a modern world, one in which he meets his former fiancee who is now elderly.  Intelligent adults with a grasp of WWII will appreciate this storyline.

The voice acting is terrific.  Extras include dubbing in Spanish (although there are no English dialouge subtitles), a ""which Avenger are you?"" quiz, and an interview with longtime Marvel Avengers illustrator George Perez and current writers.

My only complaint is that the aliens were not developed well.  They seemed like Saturday morning disposable monsters.  Their ships were cool, though.",1157241600,3,1909,5.176470588235294
2461252,4,B000CEVC9W,"I went into Ultimate Avengers with low expectations after all the mixed reviews I'd heard, but thankfully this little animated flick is surprisingly good.  Based on Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch's superb Ultimates comic series (which is pretty much a modern update of the classic Avengers lineup, hence the title of the DVD), Ultimate Avengers begins with the discovery of legendary WWII hero Captain America, who has been frozen in ice for over 60 years.  When he's thawed out, he is teamed with Nick Fury, Iron Man, the Wasp, Giant Man, Black Widow, and eventually Thor, to combat the same shape shifting aliens that Cap fought back in the war.  The story and dialogue aren't what you'd expect from Warner Bros. superb DC animated titles, but the animation is crisp and clean, and no other cartoon has blended traditional animation with CGI better to date.  The story stays surprisingly close to Millar's comic, even though the volitale relationship between Giant Man and Wasp is downplayed here, but it's the use of Bruce Banner/Hulk where Ultimate Avengers really shines.  All in all, if you're a fan, new or old, check this out, and while you're at it, check out the recently released sequel as well, which is even better.",1156118400,9,1225,4.8701923076923075
2461253,4,B000CEVC9W,"That opening line pains me to say because I grew up a Marvel fan and I still am one. That being said, perhaps I've been a so spoiled by the writing quality of JLU from WB that I expected much more from Lionsgate with Ultimate Avengers. I'll admit, I didn't enjoy it on first viewing but after I set my own expectations aside, I found it to be a very well done opening!

In this one, we start back at the end of World War II when Captain America seemingly died after stopping a nuclear warhead from reaching its target. In reality, he fell from the exploding missle into the Atlantic Ocean where he remained frozen for 60 years! He is awakened by Nick Fury and SHIELD to help form a team of super-heroes to stop a new alien threat...........which happens to be the same threat Captain America fought back in WWII!

The characters strikingly different here than in the traditional past. Captain America isn't as optimistic but still is the brave solider that we all know. Iron Man is kept about the same as he is in the comics and in other animated features of the past. Thor has no secret identity anymore of Dr. Donald Blake. He's just Thor! Henry and Janet Pym aren't the lovey dovey couple they were in the old school comics either! Janet is actually a mutant with the same ""Wasp"" powers but Henry (while still a brilliant scientist) is a big jackass here! From what I understand, their relationship in particular was toned down for this feature because in the ""Ultimates"" line of comics, Henry was actually physically abusive to Janet and even got into a fist fight with Captain America himself over her! As a result, Cap and Janet actually dated for awhile! Here, the Pyms just argue constantly but the heated tension is there to where you think something COULD happen.

The Black Widow is still very much the person she is in the comics. Dr. Bruce Banner and Betty Ross have a strained relationship due to his transformations into the Hulk and Nick Fury is recast as an african-american! I was shocked by this at first but I've grown to love it though I do miss the classic Nick Fury.

I thought that the animation was suspect a little but nothing bad. I agree that the way the characters are drawn are more realistic than even in Justice League. Both the men and women dress like they are going into battle instead of a costumed ball.

Overall, I found this to be a watchable feature. While certain aspects could've been better (particularly the Thor/Hulk fight), its not a bad first attempt. Worth a rental or buying (preferably at a special price).",1155945600,4,2556,4.535791757049892
2461254,4,B000CEVC9W,"I didn't know as much about Marvel's Avengers as I do their DC counterparts, the Justice League, but I have to admit that I enjoyed this film nonetheless.

This animated feature focuses on Captain American thought dead after World War II, who once found, is selected by Nick Fury to head a group of super heroes.  The group, the Avengers, are made up of Capt. America, the Black Widow, Wasp, Giant Man, Thor, the Hulk, and Iron Man.  Together, this group must face an alien force threatening mankind.

I thought the animation was well done but there were a few things that I hope is tweaked for the sequel.  Sometimes scenes just moved along to quickly and the characters need to be better developed.  Also, I hope we are given a longer movie the next time around.  Otherwise I think this was a good first movie for this group of deserving heroes and I look forward to seeing the sequel.

I could have given this a 5 star but certain superhero characters were not true.  Hank Pym ""Giant Man"" is a giant jerk in this movie instead of a brilliant scientist.  There's not enough Thor and even he was way off.  He didn't act like a Thunder God at all.  He lost to the Hulk very easily. His own hammer knocked him out. Usually he could go toe to toe with the Hulk with bare fist without the hammer and take a huge amount of beating.  How on earth did the Hulk lift Mjolnir???  You have to be worthy to do that.

Too much emphasis on Captain America and not enough on the others.  Iron Man was the only character that was played out right.  This movie made the Hulk look good, which happens to be Marvel's cash cow anyway.

2461258,4,B000CEVC9W,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is a good, fun, and entertaining movie that sticks fairly closely with the characters from the comics.

The animation is high quality, in my opinion.  The people look like people.  While I also greatly enjoy the Justice League, I find that their animation quality isn't as good as here in the Avengers.  Batman and Superman seem to have concrete blocks for faces.  In the Avengers, everyone looks distinct and realistic.

The Avengers are much like DC's Justice League; an assembly of heroes to fight against global problems.  And while overall, the Avengers may not be quite as powerful as the Justice League, they are formidable in their own right.

This first film deals with the origin of the Avengers.  It brings in heroes such as Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Giant-Man, Wasp, Hulk, and still others in Nick Fury (who puts the team together) and Black Widow.  I collected comics for nearly 15 years, and the Avengers was always one of my favorite, mostly because my favorite character was in it: Iron Man.

The film is a parallel to the comic.  Some reviewers have stated that there isn't much character development.  This is true.  However, this is a movie and not an episodic series like the Justice League.  Also, in the comic, you're expected to know these characters already from their individual books.  And for good or bad, this film seems to expect that as well.  And in the limited 70 or so minutes, there just isn't much time for character development.  Most people should already be familiar with Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, and Thor.  The ones that people may be less familiar with are Giant Man and Wasp.

The Avengers are asked to defend against an extraterrestrial invasion that began back during World War II.  After 60 years, these aliens have resurfaced by knocking out one of America's satellites/detecting systems.

The team is shakey the first time out.  They don't listen to Captain America.

You might think that the climax is a battle between ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" and these Aliens.  But it's not.  It is actually between the Avengers and the Hulk.  Bruce Banner injects himself with Captain America's Super-Soldier Serum with the hopes of controling the rage of the Hulk.  It back-fires, and a huge all-out fight ensues.  You get an idea of just how powerful the Hulk is (arguably the comic industry's strongest character).

They make Thor a little over-the-top cheesy, but it is a small glitch that is easliy overlooked as he's barely in this film.  Captain America and Iron Man are nearly perfectly done.

Be sure to catch ""Avengers Assemble"" in the special features page if you're interested in the history of the comic book from some of the top writers and artists.

This was a fun film.  I'm looking forward to the next one.",1154649600,7,2818,4.81419624217119

2461300,4,B000CEVC9W,"While I hold off giving the film 5 stars because of the animation quality, only part of it is horrible (i.e. the planes flying overhead in the opening scenes).  Most of the rest is at least acceptable, with some of the battle scenes, especially those with the Hulk, are pretty well done.

That being said, I think the word ""anime"" is Korean or somesuch for ""cheap animation done fast, mucked up with a few exagerations we can call style.""  This isn't anime as some of the reviewers suggest; it's not far off but it definitely tries harder.

Where the movie shines strongest is the pacing and the direction of the scenes.  The movie is truly like watching a comic book on the screen, something I've never seen done before whether in live action or animation.  Add to that a beautiful and appropriate score and it's an experience that far exceeded my expactations.

I became a fan of the Avengers at the very start of the Silver Age and I really, really wish they would have done a movie like this with the characters and settings of those times.  It's a pipe dream, I'm sure, but those are the comic books I'd like to see on screen.

For the people that recommend the books over the movie, read the books and don't see the movies.  They're two different mediums; if the movies don't give you what you get from the books, how can you be surprised?  If you don't have enough crossover appreciation the movie won't work for you but it's not the fault of the movie.  That's silly.

This is a good effort, I'd love to see them improve the animation, and I'd love to see them do the stories I remember from my youth, say the Kree-Skrull War.  At the very least, if this first release is indicative of the kind of films they're looking to release, I say keep them coming.  I'll keep buying.",1152057600,5,1782,4.423312883435583

Because Avi Arad (head of Marver Enterprises or whatever they call it) and Co. are basically ruining their characters everytime they adapt it.

Earth is in danger from age-old enemies on the verge of attack, and cannot be saved by a single hero. A team of heroes - all of whom are very independent in spirit - must be formed. The team is to be led by Captain America/Steve Rogers (voice: Justin Gross),  who has been frozen in ice for over sixty years. He is revived by Bruce Banner (voice: Michael Massee)and Dr. Betty Ross (voice: Nan McNamara). My personal favorite, Thor, (voice: David Boat) was probably the hardest to convince to come on board with the team. But eventually the Thunder God does lend a hand and a warhammer to the cause.

They are joined by Nick Fury (voice: Andre Ware).

Although these heroes manage to present a united front against Earth's enemies, their biggest threat comes from within - we all know what happens when Bruce Banner becomes angry - The Incredible Hulk! (voice: Fred Tatasciore).

For a long-time comic book addict, the only thing better than reading them is seeing them come to life on the small screen. Wonderful fun! Great storyline, fun movie!

- Thor seemed more like a alchoholic hippie. Always drinking his mead and trying to save whales. A ""Hero"" not interested in the wars of man. What's with his hammer having a blade on one end? I know Marvel revamped most of it's characters quite a while back, but if I remember correctly it's referred to as the HAMMER of Thor, not the AXE of Thor. This makes me think of how DC ruined Aquaman.

- Henry Pym was about as arrogant and self-centered as they come. He blamed everyone else for his mistakes. While I remember him as being arrogant this was went overboard. I did though, like the part of the movie where he puts on his old Ant Man helmet.

At first I was dissapointed with the World War II airplanes in the beginning of the film. But it gets better.  The character interaction is a bit more complex than your average Saturday (do they still make them for Saturdays?) morning cartoon.

While this isn't Pixar animation it's worth your money.  The colors are bright and vibrant and if you are a fan of the superhero genre, you won't be dissapointed!",1144627200,3,880,4.409937888198757
2461343,4,B000CEVC9W,"Let's get a couple things out of the way.  ONE:  Marvel has never been a match for DC when it comes to animation.  TWO:  I don't really care much for this new age of bickering heroes.  THREE:  This is an adaption of an adaption, meaning its resemblance to the classic comic material is fleeting at best.  AND FOUR:  This is actually a pretty good film.

Oh, it has its flaws.  The biggest is the animation, which while really fairly good is just lacking in style and finesse.  The story is good, too, and the characters are well-defined.  There's some nifty action as well, and the dialogue straddles that fine line between family friendly and adult.

BONUS POINTS:  There's a couple of things that I really liked about this film.  For one, people actually die.  When you've got an evil alien invasion, it just seems realistic.  For another, the dialogue is damn clever in places.  And the final battle between the Hulk and the rest of the team is pretty cool.

NEGATIVES:  Like I said, I get tired of bickering heroes.  If you take away much of that, the film would be even shorter.  And the ending seems a little sudden.  The alien invasion never seems to be well-organized, and is destroyed a little too easily.  Also, I just didn't care for Thor's voice in this.  It seemed to match his old, traditional persona.  He should've sounded more like a hippie.

OVERALL:  This is worth renting.  I probably wouldn't recommend buying it.  But at least it's a step in the right direction for Marvel.  Who knows?  Maybe one day they'll finally be able to compete with DC.",1144281600,4,1566,4.561594202898551
2461344,3,B000CEVC9W,"I'm a bit disappointed in the response this DVD has received.  Frankly, those of you who gave this film poor reviews should have knows what to expect.  Examine the details of the film, and the details of the source material in which it came from.

The Ultimates comic-book - Innovative.  Millar's ability to shape Marvel's most premier super-team into bickering and reluctant team players works.  We love what he has built for us.  Hitch's amazing art-work brings Millar's vision to life with great detail.

What the DVD gives us - Consider Marvel's challenge for a moment.  The Ultimates Comic book is an adult comic book (admit it, it's just not for kids - Example = Wasp flashing the twins at the Hulk in issue #5).  A major majority of who will buy this movie are young children.  Marvel had to find a way to gear the film towards those who love the comic, and also find a way to bring a younger demographic into the mix.  I'll admit, they tried to please everyone, which just did not work the way they had hoped.

The focus of the film is on Captain America.  Any film school junkie can tell you that to make a hero film effective, you have to focus on one hero.  To draw the focus away from that hero causes the audience to lose sympathy for them.  The cost of this was losing details on supporting characters like the Iron Man or Thor.  Iron Man is by far my favorite Marvel icon ever, but I watched this movie knowing the focus would not be on him, and I was pleased with the screen-time they gave him.

The animation is rushed.  It's direct to DVD, not PIXAR.  Know what to expect.  Also, realize this is Marvel's first attempt at an animated film.  Admirable for a first attempt, but falls from the goals Marvel set up for themselves.

I give the film three stars for a couple of reasons.  Even though your favorite characters don't get the same screen-time as the good Captain, it's wonderful to see life breathed into them.  Second, kids love this movie.  Marvel secured it's younger demographic well by giving them an easy to follow storyline, as well as some action.

Stop expecting X2 and just sit back and enjoy the movie.  Take it for what it is worth, and move on.",1144108800,8,2182,4.444444444444445
2461345,3,B000CEVC9W,"I read this story line in the Ultimates series sometime back and was really looking forward to this release.  I guess I'm still a little naive when it comes to movie adaptations, because I was really disappointed.  The length of the film (70 minutes) leads to some seriously underdeveloped characters - we don't know squat about several key players here, including Iron Man, the Black Widow and the Hulk.  The alien invasion storyline is severely thin as well.  I kept thinking to myself, ""I wish I had seen this first, then read the Ultimates"", as I was watching this.  I should know better though - I had the exact same experience with ""Empire Strikes Back"" when I was 12 years old (I read the book first and then saw the movie - BIG mistake)

The animation is standard at best.  I kept having flashbacks to the old GI Joe cartoons from the 1980s.  Movements were pretty bulky for the most part but there are some moments where the animation shines (the Hulk fight in particular).

That being said, one of the neatest features of the DVD is the pop-up narration feature.  A la ""Pop Up Video"" you can get a running text commentary during the film.  The fight scene between Iron Man and the Hulk was the most amusing.  As Iron Man is on the ground and the Hulk is just pounding the living snot out of him, a bubble pops up and says ""This scene would not be approved by broadcast censorship standards"" - classic!

All in all, something I don't think I would show the little kids (say 5 to 8) but its also something I don't think the bigger kids (say 9 to 13) would like.  But I could be wrong.

Just do yourself a favor - RENT IT first - and do NOT read the Ultimates before you watch this.",1143676800,2,1689,4.334394904458598

It lacks the both earnest charm of the original comic as well as the Matrix-esque glitz and gusto that makes The Ultimates one of the most readable and cleverly modern comics published today.  Additionally, the special features fall short with a long winded (and inexplicably Millar-less) documentary on the Avengers past, present and future that would bore even the least discriminating fan boy to tears.",1143244800,9,540,5.493975903614458
2461348,3,B000CEVC9W,"Marvel is giving the Avengers a pretty big buildup these days. This direct-to-DVD movie doesn't take too many risks, and I don't blame Marvel for this, since they are already finding other ways to ssaturate the comic-buying market with Avengers-related merchandise, and probably making a killing.

This DVD's actually based on Ultimate Avengers, a comic title set in an alternate universe that has grown very popular, since it revamps the well-known characters with different histories and rewritten origins, even reinterprets them completely in some cases. Here we see Nick Fury as a relatively young Black man instead of the grizzled Caucasian, weathered soldier with white streaks in his hair and a potty mouth. Wasp is still married to Henry Pym in his incarnation as Giant Man, and Wasp also looks vaguely Latino. The idea of ethnically diverse heroes is refreshing, but it just makes you do a double take at first to make sure you can recognize the leads.

Basically, Captain America is discovered by the government after being frozen and cryogenically preserved in a block of ice since World War II. He's shell-shocked, culture-shocked, and his girlfriend has married his old sidekick, Bucky.

The plot of the movie is vague. The Avengers find themselves embroiled in battle with shape-changing aliens who break into SHIELD (Nick Fury's spy organization) and download their security and weapons files. As a side plot, Bruce Banner, AKA the Hulk, is working on a new version of the Super Soldier formula that originally gave Captain America his powers. Little do his backers at SHIELD and his ex-wife, Betty know that he is testing the new formula on himself and skipping his dose of sedatives that repress his transformations into the Hulk.

I thought the animation was good enough, at least in certain scenes, I would call it at least as good as the X-Men: Evolution cartoon from Saturday mornings. The voice talent left a lot to be desired, and the fact that there weren't a lot of celebrities voicing any of the characters feeds my assumption that this was done on a shoestring budget.

As far as whether it is suitable for children goes, my ten-year-old and seven-year-old both loved it and didn't find it scary. I don't recall any bad language or gratuitous blood, so that was good. I didn't like the interpretation of Bruce Banner's character as a washed-up hack all that much, and I haven't read the comic book to know if this is how he is portrayed now. He was the most poorly drawn character, looking slumped over and disheveled, and whoever voiced him sounded like Dennis Leary after ten cigarettes. Thor's character was very cartoony and was reimagined here as a hippy, mead-swilling environmental activist. His hammer also looked huge. Filling out the ranks were Iron Man and the Black Widow, whom I actually liked the best, but who didn't get as much exposure as Captain America and Bruce.

If you aren't already a comic book fan, this movie is a fine ""starter,"" much like watching episodes of ""Justice League Unlimited"" allows prospective DC Comics fans to have a little ""primer"" of who's who. The relatively low price is worth the cost, as long as you aren't a purist.",1143158400,9,3190,4.909090909090909

Plenty of fan boys are coming out of the woodwork to slam the animation while, they should be glad that we are even getting comic book movies made.
Like the original X-Men and Spider-man live action movies, the budget is modest and this is considered by Marvel a low risk experiment to see how well the movies will sell.
If it does well, we get things like X2 and Spider-man 2.
Better FX and all that. In this case, you will get better animation with a bigger budget.

2461371,5,B000CEVC9W,"As long-time fan of the super-hero genre, I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  The treatment of classic Marvel heroes is well done.  In traditional Marvel style, the DVD addresses the emotions and feeling of Captain America who is agruably the central figure of the story.  That is what I expect from Marvel.  Perhaps the story line borrows a little from the premiere of Cartoon Network's adaptation of the Justice League (i.e. heroes uniting against an alien menace).  And maybe an origin story isn't truly necessary.  But I still have to give this DVD the highest ratings",1142812800,2,568,4.926315789473684
2461372,3,B000CEVC9W,"""Ultimate Avengers"" is an interesting combination of the new and improved 21st century version of the Avengers written by Mark Millar and penciled by Bryan Hitch, and a revitalization of the 1980s style of animation.  Now, ""The Avengers"" was the one Golden Age Marvel comic book that never really impressed me growing up.  I liked the X-Men and the Fantastic Four, so it was not a question of not liking superhero groups.  But the roster of the Avengers went from one extreme to the other.  They started out power heavy with Thor, Iron Man and the Hulk, and then went ultra light with Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and the Scarlet Witch.  Either way there was always a problem with coming up with super villains for the Avengers to fight, and only the Vision really captured my interest.

Then Millar and Hitch came up ""The Ultimates,"" the Avengers counterpart for the Ultimate series Marvel came up with the rework its superheroes for the 21st century.  On balance, I like the Ultimates more than the Avengers, even though the way they play off of the ""real"" Marvel Universe does not always work (e.g., Hank Pym having Hawkeye's personality, Thor's divine delusion).  ""Ultimate Avengers: The Movie,"" is a direct-to-video effort that covers the same group as the first Ultimate's storyline, ""Super-Human,"" which had to do with the formation of the group and their first collective effort to bring down the Hulk.  The idea is that Bruce Banner's days as the Hulk are behind him and he is in charge of the government's effort to update the super-solider formula that created Captain America way back when. In charge of the proceedings is General Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The story begins with the final mission of Captain America during World War II, but after that point all of the superheroes who make up the Ultimates already recognized as superheroes, albeit with one large exception. The Captain America thread is the best of the bunch, with Steve Rogers getting caught up on his life 57-years later and free from that annoying guilt over the death of Bucky Barnes, but the movie moves so quickly (it is only 70 minutes long) that there is no time to give depth to Rogers or any of the other characters.  The key difference from the comic books is that in addition to having to deal with the Hulk, when he finally shows up, the Ultimate Avengers have to contend with aliens.  These aliens were around at the end of World War II and have apparently waited for Earth to develop advanced weapons and superheroes before launching their attack.  But the advantage with aliens is that there are a whole bunch of them, they do not spout corny super villain dialogue, and the Ultimate Avengers can wale on them big time.

If they had added another 20 or even 10 minutes to this ""movie"" and expanded the characterizations beyond the bare bones, the retro-animation style would certainly be more acceptable and perhaps almost endearing.  But that complaint comes from my adult perspective and clearly Marvel is aiming this at a much younger audience.  That makes it more of a recruitment effort as well as a first foray in the direct to video market.  But that is not to say the older audience is ignored.  You can turn on the Avengers Trivia Track, so you can access trivia about the characters and the world of the Avengers which watching the film.  This covers not only information about the characters, but also the World War II, the production company, and what scenes are lifted from the comic book.  ""Avengers Assemble"" looks at the history of the group from September 1963 when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created the Avengers, to the creation of the Ultimates by Millar.  Showing up as talking heads are editor Tom Brevoort, artist George Perez, writer Kurt Busiek, and editor-in-chief Joe Quesada from ""The Avengers.""

There is also a first look at ""Ultimate Avengers 2,"" so there will be more of the same in the future and you can make the argument that things have to improve.  This 2006 effort turns the comic book into a cartoon, which in this case is not a good thing.  The results are not really bad, they are just ultimately disappointing.",1142640000,5,4139,4.748603351955308
2461373,5,B000CEVC9W,"A lot of people are bagging this movie, but it's actually a really good setup with some really cool action sequences.  For old school Marvel fans, the characters are updated in many ways, but still have their powers with minor changes to their respective histories (having read the Ultimates though would've prefaced that).  The story jumps straight to the action showing the newly formed team as awkward heroes showing off their abilities...not very much depth if you're looking for a serious story line with solid villians, but an incredibly over the top intro to what could lead to very good and intense stories and potentially a good Marvel series.  Analyzing the animation is useless because the pacing is good as is the design, so the movie flows like butter.  With all the other Marvel animation duds out there this sets the stage to potentially develop more animation with a cast of characters who easily match DC superheroes and would rival the great animation series developed on that end.  Marvel characters definitely deserve top notch animators and story tellers and this is a huge step in the right direction.",1142553600,3,1123,4.952127659574468

I want that hour back that I lost watching this snoozefest.  The plot was slow and boring.  This was basically Captain America's story and I have got to say one of the most boring characters in the Marvel Universe.  Thor on the other hand is one of the most fascinating characters and he is on the screen for only a few minutes tops.  The only interesting part of this was when the Avengers had to do battle with the Hulk.

The animation is mediocre 1980s Saturday morning, the direction is artless and the story is just a timid outline of what it could have been. Dull. I don't know what's more insulting; teasing the audience with Hitch's illustrations in the end credits or the Special Features material where Avi and company gush about how hard they worked bringing the book to life. I suspect the only envelope they pushed was with schedule and budget.

The animation and character designs are all nicely presented, in particular, the Hulk. And while I would have liked to have seen a more faithful adaptation of Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch's ULTIMATES comic, the end result is quite good.

2461380,5,B000CEVC9W,"I don't know what some of these people are whining about.  This is a great product with excellent animation and a compelling story.  I suspect this flick will suffer review-wise from fanboys with an imaginary stake in the final product who are groaning because they would have changed some aspect or another if--magically--Marvel had only let THEM do the movie instead of Avi Arad and friends, who have consistently brought us some truly great superhero material over the past several years.

It's an animated superhero flick.  It harkens back stylistically to the Spiderman the Animated Series, though it's more crisp and the colors are more vibrant.  It's not Japanese anime art, though, I'll give you that.  It's American cel animation and it looks on par with anything impressive that's come out of that market.  It's about 70 minutes long, but it is satisfying and doesn't leave you feeling like you got short-changed.  There is a lot going on and quite a few characters to bring together--all while ramping up the conflict in this story.  They do a good job multitasking with these challenges so the film doesn't suffer from boring beginning syndrome.  The fight choreography is exciting and the sparing use  of integrateed CGI in the 2D cel animation that dominates fits right in.

I haven't read comic books in many years, so I'm sure that this movie creates something of a new continuity in some ways (I know Nick Fury of SHIELD was not a black man, for one thing--one thing which, while possibly an unnecessary change obviously meant to inject some diversity, really didn't bother me).  So if you're all about the Ultimates comic this is supposedly based on, I'm sure you'll find some offense.  However, it's all good with Marvel, just like every other continuity change that has riddled all comic book companies forever always were and will be.  They're par for the course, and nothing here is glaring or in the face of the spirit of the heroes focused on.

Before seeing the movie, I was not psyched about the particular heroes focused on besides Cap and Iron Man, actually. Giant Man has never really captured my imagination.  Even so, he was really great, and I'm now a fan.  Same goes for the Wasp.  Hulk was more interesting the way they did it than he could have been; he wasn't all ""Hulk smash"" and conveniently Banner gets mad at the right place at the right time.  There was a running thread there that worked well, and they even did it without stepping all over Hulk's usual deal (because Hulk smash is still awesome . . .).  Banner got a slightly different treatment, but it worked for me in the end.

There's a sequel in the works, and not too far off in the future it will be in stores.  This movie does not need a sequel to feel complete, and the sequel supposedly will fly on it's own even if you haven't seen this flick first.

Look, for the like 12 or 14 bucks this thing's gonna cost you, it's a great buy.  If it was even 25 bucks or so, I might say wait and see if you can rent it or see a friend's copy before you invest.  But this thing comes with extras, and it's a great ride for a cheap price.  All gravy.  The feature with the long time writers and artists was great.  The pop-up video style factiods you can turn on are nice, though absolutely riddled with typos and spelling errors.  (It's almost embarassing, really.)

I am a big fan of the DC animated stuff like the box sets of Batman the Animated Series, Superman's series, and I'm all over Justice League when it comes out. I don't seem to be too excited by the new The Batman series, but I'm probably going to pick up Batman Beyond when it hits.  If you're like me, you love this stuff.  There was not much Marvel going on DVD-wise in this genre up until now, but they hope to change that apparently, and if this is how they started things off, I can't wait to see how awesome a whole movie on Iron Man is going to be.

Being a longtime Avengers fan, I was happy to see Marvel do something with them in animated form(although I'd be even happier if they did a live action version of the Avengers). It was very entertaining.

Although, I will agree with some of the other reviewers here at Amazon. I expected more out of Marvel as far as the animation goes. I'll admit, they did use CGI in several parts of the movie which was good but it wasn't enough to bring it above Saturday Morning Cartoon Animation. When I first got it, I was expecting it to be more like the Spawn animated movies as far as animation goes. Yet, considering they're making an Ultimate Avengers II as well as Iron Man and Doctor Strange Animated movies, Marvel still has time to bring that up to par.

Having said that, I am currently collecting MORE JLU & THE BATMAN animated series, to quench my close-to-anime thirst, and fill the void, WHICH I ASSUMED THIS MOVIE would provide.

2461404,2,B000CEVC9W,"Back in 2005 I attended Wizard's Comicon in Rosemont, IL and was fortunate enough to sit through a preview with the Lion's Gate & Marvel Productions folks regarding a new line of straight-to-DVD animated features.  They mentioned the first would be the Avengers from the first Ultimates storyline, then Iron Man, and then a 3rd character who had hardly ever made it to the little or big screen.  At the session they screened a brief 1-2 minute clip of animation from the overseas studio who had won the contract to make the animated movie.  The clip was of Captain America and Giant-man fighting the Hulk in downtown New York, ala the first 5 issues of The Ultimates, which we were told would be the story for this first movie.

Folks, I am here to tell you that this movie bears some resemblence to what we were shown and told, but it is in fact a Saturday morning or afternoon Cartoon Network version of the Avengers, plain and simple.  The animation is of such low quality for a movie, direct to DVD or not, that I am appalled.  The story is not exactly the first few issues of the Ultimates.  It is more a meshing of those issues with the next issues that featured the Ultimates fighting an alien race sent to overtake the Earth. The scene(s) we saw at Comicon do not appear in this film, and the animation snippet that we saw was at least 2-3 times better than the final product.

Anything good?  Yes, the voices were okay.  But overall it reminded me of something for the 12-14 year crowd (and my apologies to anyone in that age group who feels offended by my assumption that you would really like this drek).

If this is what Lion's Gate has in store for us for the upcoming DVDs, I choose to keep my money and spend it elsewhere.  After all of the good things Marvel Films has done for franchises like X-Men and Spiderman, they sure dropped the ball this time with an animated feature, something you would think a comic book company would have more knowledge and sense to have come out extremely well.

2461405,3,B000CEVC9W,"Let me say that I haven't enjoyed Marvel animations since Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends.  It's been my feeling that all subsequent animated ventures have been a steady downward spiral, with the exception of X-Men: Evolution.

I was pleasantly surprised with the Ultimate Avengers movie because of what it was: A fusion of the modern rebirth given in Ultimates and the classic Silver-Age style of comics.

The animation isn't poor, but it isn't groudbreaking.  DC's animations are exceptional because the animation style is distinct - it's identifiable and is as much a part of the story as the dialogue and plot.  Teen Titans has anime elements which exaggerate emotions and actions - like it should for the loose style.  JL / JLU is very angular and a mix of generic and specific.  It has a grand quality because of the stark lines and art style.

Ultimate Avengers, on the other hand, is sort of cookie-cutter artwork.  Not inappropriate, as the current ""Batman"" animated series is, but sort of generic, like Static Shock was.  This isn't to say that it's poor (though I don't care for animations that mix obvious computer graphics with line-art for no good reason) because it's not.  But it doesn't speak to the prestige and power of the Avengers.

The plot is a neat condensation of the first 12 issues of the Ultimates, sanitized (in some parts extremely) for a younger audience. They also do some interesting work making the story tie slightly more into the regular Marvel Universe (those in the know will just need to hear ""Vibranium"" to know what I'm talking about.)  Unfortunately, it leaves the question of Banner / Hulk's origin, but that in and of itself allows viewers to possibly link it to the live-action Hulk movie as well (tenuously).  They give away the surprise element of the Ultimates' foes way too early, IMO, but it works, I think, for the younger audience they appear to be aiming for.

Although I was disappointed not to see certain members of the team (Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver), only one of the three had significant face time in the comics, so it's not too large of a loss.  They also allude to a foreknowledge of Cap by Thor, which I hope they will follow up on in the sequel.

The fight scenes are decent, if a little unbelievable (""Vibranium bullets"" comes to mind here) in the resources involved.  The Hulk's involvement, as well as the rest of the Avengers, is handled well, however.  It also manages to paint a Savage Hulk as sympathetic and heroic (at least at the start), which is a plus for Hulk fans.

In all, it's an OK video for anyone to watch.  It suffers from lackluster production and (for those expecting the mature grittiness of the actual Ultimates storyline) a somewhat immature plot, and the special features are barely worth looking at.  However, there is significant superheroic action and entertainment for children of all ages.  Just be careful to check some preconcieved notions at the door.  This is neither the Ultimates, nor the Avengers.

This is the Ultimate Avengers.",1141516800,2,3048,4.815384615384615
2461406,4,B000CEVC9W,"I don't understand some of the negative reviews posted here.  This is an animated adaptation of the Ultimates comic, not a re-telling of the comic.  Just think of it as a ""new story"".  No,it does not follow the comic (not closly anway), but it's not at all bad...in fact, it's pretty darn good.

There are some things that make me raise an eyebrow, like Hulk picking up Thors hammer...but in EVERY animated adaptation of a comic, there are things that make you go ""what the heck"".  Example - In the Justice League cartoon, in one episode, Superman is in space wearing astronaut gear!  What the heck??  Since when can Supes not fly in space, especially around earths yellow sun...without the aid of a space suit!!

Bottom line...the ""rules"" that govern these heroes are always somewhat different in the animated adaptations then they are in the comic.  Does that make it ""right"" or does that mean it could not have been written better...no, not at all (otherwise I may have given it 5 stars instead of 4), but it certainly does not make it bad (and certainly not worthy of the one star rating I saw a few people give it).  It's just ""different"".

But one thing this movie does do is capture the spirit of the Avengers (ultimate or not).  I was a little disappointed that Thor was not in it more, but the screen time he does have is great.  Cap is very well written, the voice acting was much better then I was expecting and the animation far exceeded my expectations.

I am not at all a fan of the Spiderman cartoon or the X-Men cartoon...the stories are not only to ""in depth"" for my kids, but they also bore the heck outta me and the animation in both of those, to me anyway...it's just ""blocky"" looking, and the characters often seem out of proportion, hard to puy my finger on it, but I have never liked the animation in Spiderman or X-Men.

But Avengers animation is quiet good.  It flows very well, and the characters ""look"" cool.  The fight scenes are intense and entertaining and the the overall effect was very enjoyable  (the do a GREAT job of capturing the pure fury and uncontrollable rage of the Hulk).  I had low expectation, but man, I was very happy with the end result.  I still think Justice League may have the best overall animation, but Avengers is 2nd without a doubt and the best from Marvel.

The story was fine, it fit with the spirit of the comic (if not the ""exact"" story) and a lot of the more adult content was left out, wich is fine because animated features, just by nature being a cartoon, target a larger audience then just adults.  This was very well done.

My son (2 1/2) enjoyed it (expecially the Captain America parts), but it is pretty intense for kids, and some of the slower ""story-line"" parts lost his interest for a bit, but he was right back into it when the action kicked up again.

My Nephew and his friend (both around 7) LOVED this movie.  They were yelling and screaming during the fight scenes (which had us pausing our movie in the other room, just to listen to them yelling)...

""Ooooh...I bet that hurt!!!"" (Thor hitting Hulk with his hammer)
""Captain America's OK!!""
""Ironman's back!!!""
""Oh, ow!!""...
""Ow!!""
""He's a monster!""
""It's the Hulk!!""

LOL...it was totally great.  They loved it, and I think any comic fan will be able to appriciate this movie as well.

The only reason this get's 4 instead of 5 stars is Hulk picking up Thors hammer (and using it against him, no less).  I'll leave the end results of that battle out of this review (don't want to spoil anything for those of you who have not seen it) but suffice it to say, the same end to that confrontation could have been written without Hulk picking up Thors hammer (unless they are going on the assumption perhaps that Thor is not a deity or Asguardian or whatever, and he's just a nutcase with a high tech weapon, but that's neither here nor there with regards to this movie or review).  I also have to wonder how a little needle/syringe penetrates Hulks skin, but again, I can let that go (think Hawkeye did that in the comic as well, firing it from his bow, but don't recall for sure...been a while since I read the comic).

In the end, if your a fan of comics or animation, I highly recommend...Ultimate Avengers and greatly look forward to Marvels next animated release's (Ultimate Avengers II - Aug, Ironman - Oct, and Dr. Strange - Feb 07).",1141516800,4,4365,4.4860759493670885

To have this team re-imagine by starting with Captain America is really a great what if story. The best thing I like about the team is they kept the Hulk.

2461408,3,B000CEVC9W,"Marvel has great movies.  DC is starting to have great movies.  DC has some of the best animated tv shows.  I love the Batman animated straight to DVD movies, and recently The Batman vs. Dracula animated film.  When I heard about Ultimate Avengers I was excited to see Marvel coming into the light of great animated films.  I was wrong.  What a disapointment this movie is.  Although a good film for any comic book fan, but not great.  Marvel animation needs work.  The animated shows they put out in the 90's were good.  Spider-Man: the new animated series (MTV) was fantastic.  What went wrong?  If Marvel is trying to compete with DC in the animation genre then they have A LOT of work ahead.

Here's what I thought worked:  It's the Avengers.  I'm a Avenger fan so the time for an Avenger movie (even if it's animated) is over due.  great!

Here's what I thought didn't work:  Everything else.  The quality of the animation is just not good.  Nowhere near the animated quality of Teen Titans, Justice League Unlimited, and Spider-Man: New Animated Series.  Even The Batman animation is better and I don't like the way they character design.  Marvel should of picked the classic Avengers line up.  Where was Thor in his red cape and winged helmet. Where was She-Hulk, Hawkeye, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Black Knight?  The team that made up THE AVENGERS.  I like the Ultimate Avengers, but they shouldn't of picked that version of the team for the start of their animated line up.  Ultimate Avengers is dark and mature.  This film is light and family based.  Much like the original team.

What also didn't work is the voices they picked.  They sounded generic and dry.  I thought none of the voices matched the characters.  Thor's accents was just terrible.

where was the plot?  It didn't have one.  I understand it was character development and introduction to the team, but where was the plot?  There was this alien invasion coming, so Nick Fury had to gather the earth's mightiest heros to stop them.  This battle lasted all of about 1 chapter.  The climax of the film came when the Avengers battled the Hulk.

Some of the fight scenes with the Hulk were good.  I think Justice League Unlimited and Teen Titans have better fight scenes.  Marvel needs to watch those and take some notes.

I would recommend renting before buying.  $14 in stores is a waste of money.  if you can find the film for $10 or less, buy it.  I'm going to buy when it drops in price so I can add it to my Comic/Superhero library.

2461410,4,B000CEVC9W,"I'm a longtime fan of the Avengers and have been dying for a good Avengers cartoon.  On top of that, I've been dying for a good Marvel cartoon in general.  Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends was ok for its time (although when Superfriends outdoes you, you're in trouble), and I watched the '90s versions of Spider-Man and X-Men, but they were pretty shoddy in comparison to the Batman Animated Series.  So the pressure was on for Ultimate Avengers.

Well, it was a treat.  It took from regular Avengers continuity and what I assume is Ultimates continuity and brewed up something new and original and exciting.  I agree Natasha's accent is a little over the top, but everyone else did well, and the look was great.  Captain America has a clear character development arc, everyone is fairly fully realized by the end, and the end fight is truly incredible.  I've never really gotten to see the Marvel powerhouses unleashed like that, and it's worth watching for that alone.

Also, Thor is awesome.  And hilarious.  Hilariously awesome.  I adore him.

The animation isn't quite up to the quality of JLU, but even without Bruce Timm, it flows pretty well, and the writing is solid.  Considering debut efforts are usually the weakest, subsequent movies should be even more satisfying.  But for a start, this movie is absolutely the spirit of the Avengers and the feature that should redeem Marvel's animation efforts.

However, if you've read The ULTIMATES.....  this is a total crock!!!  It ended and I was wondering where the rest of the story was!!  Tony Stark does not have a brain tumor. Where's Captain America destroying by splitting him in half with his shield while yelling ""Do you think this stands for France!!!"" while pointing at the ""A"" on his head.  Classic moments were left out and the language and subject matter toned down for all ages.  The Hulk does not appear trying to ""capture"" Betty Ross.  Captain America does not kick the HULK in the b*lls. Oh, and it's all out of context.  The fight against the hulk is the end of the movie.  HUH?  My thoughts exactly.  But if for nothing else, it's fun to put the CD in the computer, answer a few questions and have it determine which character you are most like.

2461432,1,B000CEVC9W,"When I heard this was coming out, I was thrilled.

The Ultimates comics made me a huge fan of the Avengers, and while I have read comics for years they were never characters I cared much about.  This movie was a stereotype of exactly why.

It was very typical cartoon/comic.  Evil aliens.  Heroes stop them.  It lacked all the potency the comic offered.  No horrible, rampaging, cannabalistic Hulk.  No alcoholic Iron Man.  No gay, bitchy Jarvis.  No Captain America trying to come to terms with the modern age.  No domestic violence between the Pyms.  No deluded Thor.  It makes it sound like the comic was just a bunch of insane people, but.. well, it was.  But it was brilliant.  It had pathos.  You CARED.

And this is where Sci-Fi/Fantasy movies ALWAYS fail and where the popular Sci-Fi/Fantasy books/comics/etc thrive at.  You care  There is depth.  The circumstances should never be as important as the PEOPLE.  The people DEALING with these fantastic circumstances is what is entertaining, what is rivoting.  Hell, that's what makes Battlestar Galactica so bloody amazing... the sci-fi aspects are just... props. The movie is not about 'people in space."" Just like Ultimate Avengers the comic was not about ""people with superpowers fighting aliens.""  The movie, however, was.  And it bit.

Animation in no way means it can't be good.  Aiming at a young audiance doesn't either.  Batman: the Animated Series showed us that.

Marvel... you pulled another Daredevil.  You made something so mediocre that it'll probably actually hurt the IP.  Well done.",1141257600,7,1557,4.992156862745098
2461433,3,B000CEVC9W,"The Ultimate Avengers arrises largely from the massive success Marvel has been having with film versions of their biggest superhero characters (although ""success"" might be a debatable word when speaking of Daredevil, Elektra, the Punisher or the Hulk), combined with an effort to stay competitive with Justice League Unlimited and cash in on the market for cartoon movies. If it seems a natural move from comics to animated features, be duly warned - it often seems awkward and highly uncertain in execution. The story is taken largely from Mark Millar's wonderful comic series The Ultimates (putting ""Avengers"" in the title to arouse the interest of more passive and less up-to-date comics fans), but toned down significantly for a broader audience, although. Alas, giving up this extra grit directly results in giving up much of what made The Ultimates such a great book that the idea of basing a movie off it seemed so appealing.

I finished watching this movie wondering who on Earth Marvel's target audience was supposed to be. Although several aspects of the action sequences and simplistic plot, not to mention the usual spectacle of superheroes with super-powers, would make it seem to be for kids, the PG-13 rating, combined with the several slower scenes and deviations from an action-packed main plot seem to work against this. One might argue that the movie was made for people previously not exposed to the Avengers, but this certainly would be counter-productive, given that, besides Captain America, none of the characters are developed nearly enough to be truly compelling or for you to learn to care about them at all, and in a lot of cases, so little about the history, powers and traits of some characters (notably Iron Man, Thor, the Wasp and the Hulk) is given that it would take someone who already knows the characters not to be somewhat lost about what's going on moment-by-moment. This said, the film CERTAINLY wasn't made for true comic fans (aside from the fanatical ones who love anything and everything that puts comic plots into the mainstream), with lousy characterization, some glaring inconsistencies with tried and true elements of the characters (I don't mind some creative licence, especially when creating for a new medium and a fresh story, but the Hulk lifting Thor's hammer was ridiculous), and a poorly constructed plot in which the main threat of the film is built up for most of the movie, then dispatched with relative ease, leading into a completely unrelated and anti-climactic final battle that, while not bad unto itself, was hardly an appropriate way to climax the piece. Even big fans of animated feature films would be yawning uncontrollably at the passable but certainly not remarkable animation. Who does Marvel think will be enjoying this?

Alas, keeping it down to little over one hour really hurt this little film, and prevented it from reaching its decent potential. Although I appreciate the importance of keeping the action moving along, the Avengers (and the Ultimates) is a great comic franchise for its characters, and there simply isn't nearly enough character development. Captain America is dealt with nicely, but the Wasp is so utterly irrelevant both as a person and as a hero that this movie would lose absolutely nothing appreciable by cutting her altogether. Hank Pym is purely annoying, Iron Man lacks any of his trademark charisma and suave, and Bruce Banner, who seems to have depth and an interesting story, never fully achieves this, and only comes off slightly less annoying than Pym. Oh yeah, and the Black Widow is there, so forgettably that I almost forgot to mention her in this review. Fury's OK, and fairly close the Nick Fury of the Ultimate universe, but still lacks depth. And finally, Thor, who is certainly one of the most interesting characters in the Ultimate universe, has only enough of his ""psycho hippie or Norse God"" story given to tease watchers, but not enough to be understandable without having read the comics or enjoyable on its own. I know that one movie could hardly go into full depth with all these characters, but more could have been done to make them something other than just annoying or boring. An extra half hour would have been extremely helpful.

The other big problem was the plot holes or empty plot elements that serve no purpose and aren't carried out. Hank and Janet's relationship problems are introduced...but nothing is done with them. Given their tremendous drama in the comics, this is a real shame. Then there's Hank's beef with SHIELD, which drives all of one and a half scenes, until he's suddenly an enthusiastic team player, for no apparent reason. Likewise with Iron Man, who says he won't help, then shows up with NO EXPLANATION WHATSOEVER. Then he leaves again, and comes back again - still without explanation. Want another character who says he won't help, then shows up for no apparent reason? Thor! And when, and why, does Banner lose control of the Hulk...no explanation! Hulk lifts Thor's hammer? Ridiculous, but okay...so why, then, is it such a challenge, if it's not to be made impossible...sounds like a job for NO EXPLANATION! Groan...the list goes on and on, and is filled with logistical problems, as people travel across massive distances with no apparent transportation in no time flat (see Captain America's moody huff after the team's first failure, and Thor's arrival from overseas halfway through a ten minute battle).

This may all sound pretty damning, but I'm trying to underline the fact that the film had potential that was simply not attained. It IS entertaining, it IS fun, and it's a good way to blow off a few brain cells. But a great film it is not, and if you're not enough of a fan to put up with some glaring errors, better to let it pass you by.",1141084800,4,5808,4.91743119266055

2461435,2,B000CEVC9W,"The Ultimates comic is an excellent revamp of the classic Marvel title. The Avengers was a favorite of mine throughout my childhood, but recently, with the popularity of the Justice League comic and cartoon, it was hard not to see the Avengers as a weaker JLA.

What the Ultimates comic did was resurrect the team with grittier, more cinematic, more realistic angles: Captain America as the tough-as-nails but assinine patriot, Iron Man as the frivolopus alcoholic, Thor as the possible schizophrenic merely pretending (perhaps) to be a Norse god, etc. It's interesting, it's dramatic, and the concept of creating a PG-13 version for a straight-to-DVD release is promising.

The promise goes unfulfilled. First of all, only the bare structure of the Ultimates is followed. I can accept that; it's an adaptation, after all. But what is most missing is what was most vital, and that's the gritty characterization. In the ""Ultimate Avengers,"" Captain America is the same boring hero we've already seen a million times. Thor and Iron Man are themselves, no more and no less. We get no new insight in their lives, we see nothing new about them, and they do what generic Marvel characters seem to do best: punch people and get thrown around.

So what we get is the worst of both worlds. We get the generic characterizations of these Avengers, except without the comic book fantasy and flourishes that could possibly compensate. And then we get SOME realism, but without the full depths and subtleties that such realism requires to turn into actual drama. The result is a bland story filled with boring characters--when they're not being outright annoying, as is the case with Banner and Pym (why ""annoying,"" and ONLY ""annoying,"" passes as ""realistic"" to so many writers escapes me).

The art is ok, but not great. It's what you would expect from an Avengers TV cartoon, if they made one today for, say, Cartoon Network. The animation is ok, but not great; CG is used randomly, as has become the custom in most TV cartoons, and there are moments of ""not bad"" to moments of ""oh my god, that's awful.""

There was a time--when I was a teenager and when I was starved for comic book films and cartoons--when this movie might have appealed to me. Maybe there are 12-15 year olds who might get a kick out of it. But in an era of Justice League Unlimited, successful Spider-Man and X-Men and Batman movies, and even decent super-hero live-action TV shows like Smallville, this is no longer acceptable. They're going to pump these out now, probably twice a year, until the well runs dry. In the meantime, the results are uninspired.

In short: Don't buy this movie. At most, watch it on Cartoon Network when they show it one day (which is probably very soon, knowing their track record with straight-to-home-video movies).",1141084800,15,2807,4.8375

Whoever decided that mashing the two storylines into a sloppy and uneven hour-long poorly directed cartoon needs to be fired before Marvel winds up with a catastrophic string of direct-to-DVD animated adaptations besmirching its finely written titles.

The dialogue, the pacing, the structure, and the character development in the movie are almost entirely terrible. The details and the thematic elements that make Millar's ""Ultimates"" series sensational are all but completely dropped from the screenplay. What is left is a rushed script with a hackneyed plot populated by almost entirely flat characters and anticlimactic action sequences. As for the music, most video games today have better soundtracks than this movie's (not to mention battle scenes). The voice acting was only passable. (Interestingly enough much of the voice talent came from video game V.O. backgrounds.) On the positive side, the animation is fairly solid and mostly faithful to the Hitch's ""Ultimates"" artistic vision; however, that is the only positive aspect of the movie.

About thirty minutes into the viewing, I was wishing it would just end already. I am a little bit surprised that Millar allowed his name to be attached to this project, but I guess he made some decent money off of it.

If you like mindless super hero action that requires no thought whatsoever (except perhaps critical), if you can stand to walk away from a movie and take nothing of value away from it, if you can allow yourself to waste time watching a movie so vapid that you forget everything about it immediately afterward, then I can sadly recommend this picture for you.

For everybody else, avoid this movie at all costs.

One final note: there is a preview for the upcoming ""Ultimate Avengers II"" follow-up movie included on the disc. The sequel has absolutely nothing to do with Millar's storylines and promises to be even worse than the original. So for all of you hoping that Marvel's animated team will correct the heinous mistakes it committed on this project... don't. From all appearances the creative team likely will shed any remnants of Millar's original ideas and goof about in a 1980s cartoon world mentality.

Also please keep in mind that this is supposed to be the first in a series of direct-to-DVD Marvel animated adaptations. I personally shudder at the thought. Millar and Bendis (two of Marvel's most talented and influential writers) ought to slap around Avi Arad or whomever is responsible for this blunderous venture. Maybe then we can expect some quality animated movies in Marvel's future.",1140912000,5,2869,5.091489361702128

In Ultimate Avengers, once a plane has exploded in flight, the occupants are not shown surviving; parachuting down to safety. It is a subtle message to viewers paying attention that the pilot has died. Avengers has the same subpar 1980's style voices and animation as GI Joe. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. The only area this DVD explores sucessfully is showing the raw power of an angry Hulk.  The storyline was terrible; not worth following. The DVD booklet reads Ultimate Avengers 2 will be soon be released this year. Hey Marvel, wait until you hear the viewer reactions to Part 1 before you release more junk. Corporations....all about the bottom line; cashing in with the fans selling poor product. I won't be fooled into buying anymore of these Marvel animated DVD's.",1140825600,5,946,4.839506172839506

This movie is supposed to be based on the Ultimate Avengers comic but for some ridiculous reason, they decided to flip the events upside down. In the comic, the Hulk goes on a rampage and rips through Captain America, Iron Man, and Giant Man with little difficulty after which Thor shows up and does a number on him, thereby settling the long-time argument as to who is the more powerful. In the movie, Thor is practically a no-show and he is the first Avenger to go down...for good. There is even a scene where the Hulk picks up Thor's hammer (which hasn't happened in the history of Marvel comics, only Thor is supposed to be able to pick it up) and he knocks Thor out with it. The Thunder God never gets his due when it comes to Marvel.

The animation is adequate but I will never understand why they can't just stick to the true nature of the characters as they have been portrayed for decades. Don't mess with Icons. Just ask Ang Lee. For true Marvel fans, this is a bomb.",1140825600,9,1099,4.360975609756098
2461467,4,B000CEVC9W,"Huge Comic fan here.  Huge Ultimates fan specifically.  This is not a direct translation of the material.  How could it be?  It's a direct to DVD feature animation, and it's PG13.  It would have to be a full length major motion picture rated R to do the material full justice.  It's certainly a step in the right direction though.

The streamlining of the story changes very little, but does omit quite a few favorite moments from the comics.  I did miss the focus Tony's alcoholism got in the comics.  I did miss seeing Pym's brutal marital abuse.  I did miss watching the Hulk chase after Freddie Prinze Jr..  I did miss Cap yelling ""Do you think this letter on my forehead stands for France?!?!""

That said, what's left is a very entertaining story.  Certain scenes are direct translations from the comic, and some stuff was a combination of a few ideas to keep the story chugging along.  All in all, a very tonally faithful & entertaining adaptation.

The trailer made the animation look way worse than it actually is.  It's actually quite beautiful at times.  The Hulk transformation & final battle with the aliens in particular are fantastic pieces of animation.  Very brutal, and a little scary, which is what I expect out of the Ultimates.

The music was a little over the top here and there, but the main title sequence & theme are quite good.  None of the voice actors seem distractingly miscast, though I, again, would've preferred a more subtle approach sometimes.

So, it's not as good as the comics, but it's a good start.  Hopefully the Marvel animated films will only get better with time.  The second movie, due this summer, is veering off in a completely different direction than the Millar series.  This is just a jumping off point for what may be a good animated franchise totally separate from the Ultimates we already know and love.

Oh yeah, almost forgot!  Come on Marvel, why would you shave off Thor's hippy beard????  Ridiculous!",1140825600,,1956,4.710059171597633
2461468,1,B000CEVC9W,"After reading the reviews on Amazon, I have decided that I will not buy this DVD... it seems to be another dumb-downed, childish version of the comics.

When is Marvel going to learn that the public loves the superheroes and storylines as is?  Why do they keep trying to ""fix"" what isn't broken?  Why don't they listen to the fans?

After the disappointments of ""Elektra,"" ""Fantastic Four,"" and ""Hulk"" movies (and even the Spider-Man movies weren't all that great compared to the comics), I REFUSE to put another dime in Marvel Enterprise's (read:  AVI ARAD's) pockets until they put out a movie or DVD that is in the style that STAN ""THE MAN"" LEE wrote it and the Mighty Marvel Bullpen drew it... or any other of its amazing writers and artists (Frank Miller, John Byrne, Jim Lee, etc.)!

What is so hard about going to the SOURCE?  Just go to the SOURCE, and the public is happy, and MARVEL makes mucho dinero!

Like others have said, I believe the original characters and stories have stood the test of time for over 45 years!  The ONLY reason I can see for AVI ARAD to change things is to try to make a name for himself (despite having the tremendous talent of STAN LEE working for him)... I believe AVI ARAD just wants to sell out and make a profit... he doesn't have respect for the material, otherwise he would not approve and market this garbage!

The writing is on the wall, and it reads:  ""MAKE MINE MARVEL... OR DON'T MAKE IT AT ALL!!!""

I'm 41 years old and grew up immersed in the Marvel comic universe until at least twelve or more. Just seeing these superheroes before me fighting, talking, with all their powers intact as I remember them was a shear pleasure. Enough was given of charactor development for this storyline. The voices matched well to the animation, and that comes from someone who was avidly reading the Avengers when a few of you reviewers were in diapers or not even born.

  The Hulk fight was spectacular. That is exactly how the Hulk is supposed look, sound and smash. The animation may not have been on par with of the stuff being done today, but it still had a great Marvel ""look"". I believe this has been a long overdue effort that simply works because these charactors needed to come alive properly in a full length movie. It's always great for these guys to fight Nazi's and aliens, how deep do you want to analyze it.

  Watch this with the home theatre system turned up nice(especially the Hulk fight).You'd be surprised what good audio can do. I'm looking foward to seeing some of Marvels best wrestling around with each other in whats to come. Nuff said.",1140739200,2,1275,4.644444444444445

After seeing a few clips of this I was totally disappointed.  The animation is sub par, the voice overs are on par with an average Saturday morning cartoon. There is nothing in here that even resembles the Ultimates from the book. I have the feeling that Marvel did it this way so they could market this to a preteen audience and sell the heck out of toys. Maybe even put in syndication on the Kids WB. I guess I can not fault Marvel for wanting to make a dollar or two but they will not be getting any of my dollars.

This is not a professional product at all. I have to agree with people who say to save your money and watch Justice League for free. This movie is not even up to Justice League standards, and isn't even up to ""done by a fan-boy"" standards. This film is the skunk of superhero movies in how bad it stinks up the joint. Normally, I would rather gnaw off my own arm than admit that since I am a Marvel comics collector from way back (Make Mine Marvel!).

If there is any justice is the world, Avi Arad will be smited - yea and verily - by Mjolnir and given a gamma-powered, Hulk-sized wedgie for allowing this abortion of a movie to ever see the light of day.

2461482,1,B000CEVC9W,"Any single Justice League animated TV episode makes this film look like the Superfriends from the 1970's, and there simply is no excuse.  Animation studios with amazing talent are everywhere, and Marvel certainly has enough cash after successes like the Spiderman and X-Men films.  Though they tried to put in elements from the brilliantly developed characters in the Ultimates comic series, each scene was rushed, giving no time for emotional involvement.  That, combined with chunky animation, leaves you with little ability to suspend your disbelief and really feel for these characters.

The animation of Giant Man's growth was unimpressive, when it should have been imposing and awe striking.  Wasp's growth, having her wings disappear into nothing only after she's fully grown shows a ridiculously poor understanding by the animators and directors of how her power is supposed to work.

Outside of the animation itself are the pacing, directing and editing of this film.  Each segue was hard and roughly paced.  Camera angles were sharp and characters badly proportioned within them-possibly in an attempt to be stylized.  Scenes were poorly framed.  Character dialogue was unrealistically fast and either emotionally shallow or over the top.  The best voice actor in the film was Andre Ware as Nick Fury, but he's had a lot of experience in the DC animated universe, and it's apparent that experience helped him here.

Marvel studios haven't shown an increase in technical or storytelling skill from the Spider Friends, Spiderwoman or original X-Men animated series in any way and it's unfortunate, because with Mark Millar's incredible storytelling and Bryan Hitch's innovative character design, this could have launched a whole new era for Marvel animation.

I even tried to give this a 2 star rating, just for seeing these characters on the screen, but I can't bring myself to do it.  JLU and the DC animated universe have raised the bar on both storytelling and animation quality.

If the goal was to attract children to comics, then maybe the choices to dumb down the material and save on the animation costs make sense.

Both of those cartoons,although not necessarilly adult in nature,proved that cartoons could handle more complex themes like discrimination and you could have conspiracies and audiences will watch and enjoy it. The producers who took on Batman and later Superman took it one step further with an even more adult take on the superhero genre with stories that weren't affraid to be dark,witty,intelligent and even funny.

  I'm not really sure what the Ultimate Avengers was trying to do. I can by the buy the basic premise that aliens are using the nazi's to take over the world. But after they are defeated they go into hiding. Since the only thing that can penetrate they're armor is a nuclear blast or the metal they're armor is made of I can't see why the three remaing ships just don't take over the earth. We are in the infiancy of nuclear technology and have no hope of backward engineering they're metal composition. Instead they wait until our technology advances to the point where we can detect them and then decided to wipe out SHIELD the possesor of this technology. As for the Avengers themselves there is poor to no exploration into the charcters motivations and drives.

I spent most of the 1970's and 80's with my nose in a comic book and the Avengers were always one of my favorites.

This DVD captured all of the key elements I loved as a kid and brought all of those old emotions back in a rush of nostalgia made all the more special because I shared the adventure with my own children.

Surprisingly the strength of the movie was character development. This has been a real problem in most of the movies and animated works based on Marvel characters, particularly the X-Men. Captain America provided the core subplot in this case and it really captured the essence of the character from the early Avengers comic books. The seeds were planted for further development of the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Giant Man and the Wasp. At it's heart the Avengers was always a superhero soap opera and there's plenty of that here.

The changes made to characters were fun for the most part. I liked the new SHIELD and Thor was a lot of fun. The exception was the bad guys here. The Avengers saving the world from an alien invasion seemed a little too Justice League for me. I was a little annoyed at the implication that the Nazis were aliens. That sort of revisionism denies the true horror of the Nazi era. Adolph Hitler and his crew were ""civilized"" people. That's what's scary. Blaming WWII on aliens was really weak.

Overall, the development of the heroes outweighs any complaints regarding the bad guys. I'm looking forward to the second DVD. I love the Black Panther!",1140652800,3,1546,4.586956521739131

The best part of the movie is the end where they fight the Hulk.  I purchased the DVD because I'm a comic book collector and fan of the series, but the DVD was really lacking anything of value besides the movie.  There could have been a lot of extras Marvel could have put on the DVD like digital versions of some of the comics, more interviews with authors and writers, background information on the characters in the movie, and more previews about what Marvel has in the works.  I was surprised to see Elektra on the DVD as a preview.  Marvel is headed in the right direction with straight to DVD movies, but they need to dig deeper into their chests for good stories.  I do think this is the best format for the Avengers, I think it would be very hard to make the Avengers into a real live action movie like the X-Men because there are too many dominant characters on the roster.  Iron Man could have  his own movie.  This is a good start, but Marvel should take notes from DC, their animated shows are much better in almost every way.

2461532,1,B000CEVC9W,"This movie was a TRAGEDY!  Admittedly, I've never read any of the alternate ""Ultimate"" universe comics.  I'm a fan of the old school, real Avengers and their characters.  Captain America, in particular, has been my hero since I was a child.  This little video slaughtered their stories, their backgrounds, and even the selfless team work that defined the Avengers as a true superhero team beyond even the X-Men (which I am also a fan of).

This movie let Political Correctness (the McCarthy-ism of our day) rip apart and desecrate one of Marvel's original cornerstone team titles, not to mention some of its marquee heroes (Cap, Thor, Iron Man).  Allow me to list some specifics:

1) Since when is Nick Fury a) African-America, b) young enough to be my best friend, c) a General, or d) one of the people to search for Captain America when he is still trapped in ice?  I'm amazed he got to keep his eye patch!  I have nothing against Black super heroes (Black Panther is one of the best of all time, as is Blade!), but I DO have a serious problem with revisionist history for the sake of cultural diversity.  Not to mention, for those of you not up on your comics history, Nick Fury was a hero of WWII himself (so he should be older) and he was only a Colonel!  He's Marvel's James Bond, not some stereotypical screaming General.

2) Bruce Banner is now a snivelling, whining, little baby with a serious inferiority complex, rather than a troubled genius with a terrible curse.  Watching him moan and complain his way across the screen and envy Captain America was nauseating.

3) Apparently, Thor just THINKS he's the Son of Odin?  AND he's a bleeding heart hippie with a mad-on for professional fishermen?  I won't insert here the obscenities I unleashed at the TV when I saw that bit.  And the mighty hammer Mjolnir, which can only be lifted by one pure of heart, is now some half-BATTLE AXE, AND it gets wielded against Thor by the Hulk mid-rage?!?!  WHAT?!

4) Janet Pym, a.k.a. the Wasp is suddenly a busty, scantily clad house wife with wings.  Instead of seeing a character who is destined to become one of the Avengers best leaders, I felt like I was watching Desperate Housewives animated when she came on the screen.

5) Her husband Henry Pym, rather than being a central figure to the original Avengers, a genius in his own right, and a loyal and heroic man, is treated as a bullying husband and unappreciated scientist, so shallow as to be jealous of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers for their looks and fame.

6) If all this wasn't enough, the ""filmmakers"" create some fictional race of squishy, undeveloped Nazi-aliens to play the bad guys.  These creatures are, other than the new source of Vibranium (a powerful metal that is only found in the Black Panther's African kingdom of Wakanda in the comics), a stereotypical shape-changing force of ""evil."" There was no logic, motivation, or backstory to these villians, as well as no consistency to the rules by which they could be defeated (example: they make a big deal about how the ships are made of Vibranium, a metal that absorbs all energy thrown at it, and then Thor summons lightning to destroy one.  HUH?!)  It was senseless!!

7) Rather than draw from some of comics greatest villains (Masters of Evil, Hydra, AIM, as a few suggestions) they ""create"" a bad copyright infringement of every C-rate sci-fi alien from the last 2 decades.  The only reason 20th Century Fox won't sue the film's producers over these Aliens for copyright violation is that Fox won't want their name anywhere near this train-wreck of a movie.

I could go on, but hopefully I've made my point.  This movie is ATROCIOUS.  If you're a comics fan, don't sully your collection with this drivel, no matter how much you want to see a good Avengers movie realized.  If you're new or un-initiated to the world of Marvel Comics, I recommed you go to your nearest comic store and buy a couple back issues, rather than laying down a horrible foundation of the classics with this unwatchable insult to Marvel's greatness.",1140652800,9,4050,4.677966101694915
2461533,4,B000CEVC9W,"How many times have you heard this comment. ""I liked it, but the book was better."" This is clearly the case for ""Ultimate Avengers."" and that's what I have been reading as of late.

I was going to pick it up regardless (as I did so yesterday) and I was satisfied. A nice little rendition of the mega selling comic ""The ultimates"" which I don't really read, but I hear its good from EVERYBODY.

This isn't a review of the movie, cuz everybody has already commented on it, so I will comment on thier comments. Follow.

-Anyone can pick up Thor's hammer ""IF HE BE WORTHY."" That's what the words say on the hammer. If the person wasn't worthy of picking up Mjonir (sp.) then it wouldn't budge. Hulk fighting shows 1 of two things.

1. He was getting madder, and madder, and Hulk has NO LIMIT to his strength. OR

2. The Banner part of his personality could of been worthy enough to handle the Hammer (which at a hammer, it's more like Beta Ray Bill's version, I believe it was Stormbreaker. I'm no Avengers person, Im an X-Fan through and through.)

-The movie clearly was showcasing Captain America as he signifies the embodiment of the Avengers in ANY incarnation, so Marvel had to get his persona right. The rest of them (Giant-Man, Iron Man etc) wasn't THAT far off for my tastes. Tony is a bachelor playboy alcoholic. Pym is a chauvinistic blow-hard. The little discrepanices are so minor in detail that it won't make you go ""BLASPHEMY!"" Unless you are a fanboy. and even then, you just ""meh.."" Black Widow's wrist-guns not being there isn't bad, not to mention this is the first movie. They are making another.

So to all the detractors to this movie, Shut up. It's good. The only thing I would say bad about it, is that it was short (71 minutes) They rushed through some things. Not plot holes, and nothing that will make you go, ""boy where did that come from?""

So just pick it up.",1140652800,4,1885,4.443478260869565
2461534,1,B000CEVC9W,"I rented this DVD and was glad I didn't buy it.  A bit of background: Marvel has two comicbook universes (1) their standard universe and (2) their Ultimate universe.  In the Ultimate universe, all their classic characters are reinterpreted for the modern day.  This movie was an attempt to bring the Ultimate universe equivalent of The Avengers (known as ""The Ultimates) to the screen.

One cannot equate the storyline and depth of character used in the comics to that which was shown onscreen, the movie was quite inferior in that respect.  I have read every issue of The Ultimates to date and did not expect the movie to be a direct translation of the comics, but it could at least have some of the passion and character development that the comics infuse.  The movie missed the mark completely.

The dialogue was poorly delivered and each sentence was not said but rather ""declared"".  The animation had very poor perspective; in many cases the angles were completely off.  Marvel Comics marketing hyped this DVD to the extremes, and yet the final result was a complete let-down.

The characters represented are Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Wasp, and Giant Man.  They poorly team up to fight an alien menace and later one of their own.  Everything felt very forced, and I could not care less for these characters after this movie.  I have no desire to purchase let-alone rent and view the upcoming sequel.

The only good part is the special extra portion where they put together a number of amusing fan-submissions for voice acting.  I laughed a lot at that section of video.",1140652800,7,1587,4.783088235294118
2461535,2,B000CEVC9W,"The First ever full-legth animated feature from the Mighty House of Marvel, the mind swims with possibilities. State of the art animation, a seamless blend of traditional cell animation and cutting edge CGI technology? Fantastic story-telling where characters I grew up with come to life on the small screen and rekindle the imaginations of my youth? Sorry, not this time.

Marvel never passes up an opportunity to ""fix"" something that was never broken, and Ultimate Avengers is no different. If you've sat through the multiple Marvel Comics film travesties of the past few years with your teeth grinding and your stomach churning, then you know what I mean (The Hulk and Fantastic Four LEAP to mind). Through the miracle of marketing genius, Marvel decided it would be a good idea to modernize the story lines of many of it's classic heroes through the Ultimates line.  Apparently the original stories were no longer good enough to support characters that have endured fourty some years or longer. Once they replaced the tragic, intelligent, scientific genius of Dr. Bruce Banner with a sniveling neurotic shell of a man, and the noble Norse Thunder God with a mead-swilling self-absorbed eco-zealot, the real fun begins. Remember when Heroes used to be Heroic?

I'm not going to get into spoilers or plot analysis here, but I will say that once again Marvel missed the boat. This is a company that once prided itself on superior product, boasting the industries best artists and writers. Given the current quality in animation available today, you would expect a company like Marvel to take full advantage, and release a mind-blowing film that could give Pixar, Disney, and even Japan a run for their money. What we have here, however, appears to be nothing more than a saturday morning cartoon series pilot that was abandoned by the networks, and finally released on DVD to cover production expenses.

If you're looking for a great example of the animated super-hero adventure, and want to see characters of the genre come to life, purchase a copy of Warner Brothers animated Justice League on DVD. If you want superior animation then pick up Appleseed. Ultimate Avengers is ultimately uninspiring.",1140652800,7,2201,5.038461538461538
2461536,5,B000CEVC9W,"Wow!!!! Marvel gets it right with this new animated feature. The Justice League animated series is enjoyable, but doe's not hold a candle to Ultimate Avengers. Great Story and top notch action. Captain America steals the show. Highly recommended for comic book fans and action fans alike.",1140652800,4,288,5.148936170212766
2461537,3,B000CEVC9W,"First of all I am an avid reader of THE AVENGERS (since 1979)as well as THE ULTIMATES maxi-series. I loved this series because of its humanity and heroicness. That being said, I am going to review this dvd first, as a fan and then as an audience.

 AS A FAN: The story is the summary of the ULTIMATES vol. 1, #'S 1-12. The movie starts with CAPTAIN AMERICA in combat with the nazis in WW2. Steve Rogers discovers that the Nazis are backed by a group of aliens who plan to destroy humanity. This threat is even abundant in the 20th century that is why the U.S. has developed a super-soldier program headed by Bruce Banner(HULK).

Banner has his own agenda and is using the funds to find a way to control the Hulk. In the comic, he uses the Hulk to combat the ULTIMATES so the team can justify its existence. However, as in the comic, they did unleash the brute to combat the aliens.

ULTIMATES # 6- nominated for WIZARD'S GREATEST COMIC MOMENT:CAPTAIN AMERICA TAKES DOWN THE HULK. If you will compare the THE ULTIMATES COMIC, THE MOVIE would be ROTTEN. The comic is dark with all their realistic and probable conspiracies that relate to politics. The dvd is a lighter tone of the Ultimates.

 Characterization was poor. Hank Pym brash and overconfident in the film?! What's up with that?! Hulk able to lift the enchanted Hammer of Thor? Granted that the Ultimates version of Thor is weaker, but this is stupid!! Recently, in ULTIMATES 2 # 6 it wasrevealed that THOR is the actual Norse God of Thunder. All in all I think the studios must be preparing to make another Hulk movie to allow this. As a fan, I am very disappointed.

 As an Audience: The film was well animated. It tried to take the time for character development. The film is kid-friendly which makes the action good but not violent and the script is a bit cheesy at times because they producers know kids will be watching it. I only wish they made it in the same style as JUSTICE LEAGUE and BATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM.

 In spite of all its inaccuracies, the movie was ok. If you are a comic book veteran, you will be disappointed. Just take as it is, A KID FRIENDLY family movie. The effort I spent to buy it wasn't worth it since I had to go to 3 stores to find it. They were sold out at Virgin Megastore and Rasputins, got the last copy at Borders. Should have just ordered it at Amazon.",1140566400,4,2354,4.378440366972477
2461538,4,B000CEVC9W,"Let me start by saying that if you are looking for a literal translation of Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch's work than you will most likely be disappointed.  The film is loosely based on the Ultimates series but there are enough changes to infuriate a purist.

If you watch the movie as a seperate entity from the comic book then you may find that you enjoy it.  It's still the Avengers and it has a decent storyline.  The animation is good (though not great) and for the most part the voices are really well done.  In fact the only disappointment I had was in Captain America but that's only because he was soo gruff in the comic book version but once again if this film is viewed apart from that medium than it becomes quite enjoyable.

As many people have pointed out the fight scenes are well thought out.  It's hard to watch the hulk fight and not be entertained.

If you watch the film and find yourself disappointed, watch it again not trying to judge it by the Ultimates and you'll probably find that you like it.",1140566400,7,1018,4.377659574468085
2461569,2,B000CEVC9W,"It dragged a bit, not a whole lot of action.  More Nick Fury than anything else.  Cap was OK, Iron Man was mediocre, but that was about it.  Thor was majorly disappointing.  Thor came off as some beer drinking wierdo with very little presense in the film.  And what's up with Hulk picking up Mjollnir and using it against Thor??  WRONG!!!!  NO ONE ELSE CAN PICK UP HIS HAMMER!!!!!!! Thor should have been kicking major butt, but not here.  Thor is the GOD OF THUNDER, show him that way!",1140566400,6,486,4.382022471910112
2461570,4,B000CEVC9W,"I held off writing a review until I had actually watched the movie. It's mostly traditional style animation, but there are a few jarring bits of over-processed CGI generated animation that never looks good when integrated with 2D artwork.

To the purists, no, it's not ""really the Ultimates"", but lets be real... You aren't going to see Hank Pym beating his wife Janet in an American animated feature. It just won't happen.

I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of the character development from the comic. There's a nice bit with Cap and Bucky, there's a scene between Black Widow and Tony Stark. The relationship between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross shows a decent level of complication for an animated feature.

The weakest point is the voice-acting which is really lacking. It's like what a committee might think Thor or Nick Fury sound like.",1140480000,7,848,4.834482758620689
2461571,4,B000CEVC9W,"Ultimate Avengers: The Movie is the first animated movie from Marvel Comic's animated features division. This new animated feature is adapted from the Ultimates Avenger comic book series as it details a modern retelling of the origins of the original Avengers team. Instead of Captain America being found in stasis during the 60's he is now found frozen in a glacier after successfully destroying a Nazi superweapon at the tail end of World War II. We then skip ahead 60 years to the present where General Nick Fury and Dr. Betty Ross discovery of a preserved Captain America puts new life into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s super-soldier project. But Captain America may not be enough to stop the growing threat from a hostile alien species whom Captain America had fought during WW2 and who have suddenly reappeared in the present. From here on in Nick Fury is ordered by his superiors to begin Project Avengers and ends up recruiting an eclectic band of new superpowered heroes for Captain America to lead. There's husband and wife team of Hank and Janet Pym aka Giant-Man and The Wasp. Billionaire industrialist playboy Tony Stark as Iron-Man. Natalia Romanoff as the secret-agent Black Widow. Rounding out this team are the two heavy-hitters in the group: an unstable Hulk and an individual who calls himself Thor, the Asgard God of Thunder.

The story is pretty basic and simple as its really just an introductory tale to get all the cast of characters together to fight a looming threat. Like most stories that deal with introduction there's not much meat to the Ultimate Avengers movie, but its does handle the team's assembling, rough first mission and its triumphant teamwork in beating their enemies in the end. The film's running time of just over an hour also hinders giving the characters much time to grow. But with an Ultimate Avengers II already set for a July 2006 release date then this little flaw can be overlooked. The fight scenes from both the WW2 intro sequence and the fights in the present are drawn well with minimal CGI-animations. When CGI is used its seamlessly put together with the traditional animation work that its hard to pick them out. The main fight in the end with a surprising opponent is well choreographed and shows just how powerful and primal the Hulk can be. It's not yet on the same level as the big fight scenes in DC's Justice League Unlimited series, but I think in time it'll reach that highly set bar.

For a first try at feature animations, Marvel did well in making sure Ultimate Avengers: The Movie is worthy of the cast of characters beloved by legions of comic book fans. While it's not perfect and probably will be nitpicked to death by the uber-elitist comic book fanatics, as a starting point for the rest of the fans out there it's a very good start. All I can say is that I hope there'll be more calls of ""Avengers Assemble!"" for a long time to come.",1140480000,13,2897,4.723320158102767
2461572,4,B000CEVC9W,"The DVD for the first Marvel animated film [straight to DVD] comes out next week [Feb 26th] and it is called The Ultimate Avengers. Obviously it is a story about the Avengers. Who are the Avengers? They are a group of super heroes lead by Captain American. The members are mostly loans who now must work together to save the world. Besides Captain American the Avengers are comprised of The Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, Wasp and Giant Man.

Since this is a first for the Avenger films we get loaded down with lots of back story, especially Captain America [but then again he is the main guy in the series]. I had a chance to see this film last week [lucky me got it before street date]. And it really is not a bad film, liked the animation, it reminded me of the good old days of cartoons on TV --- Spider-man and the X-men shows. Looking forward to having the chance to see more Marvel animated films in the future. So everyone head out and pick this up next week when it comes out and show your support....the further away from character introductions we get the better the stories will be.

When you do get it check out the special features, the interviews with the different writers and artists is well worth watching and it will fill you in on the history of the Avengers, if, like me, you know very little about them.",1140307200,10,1316,4.36734693877551

2461574,5,B000CEVC9W,"Let me give you a perspective before you read this review.  I've been collecting comics for 15 years.  I enjoy a wide variety of books and I am deeply familiar with both The Avengers of the normal Marvel universe as well as The Ultimates.  With that, let me tell you what a pleasure it was to see an animated Marvel feature brought to the screen with such clarity.  For those only briefly familiar with The Avengers (in either universe)you'll get a nice into to the heroes of this world.  We get a nice look into the history of Captain America, and a brief overview of all the other characters so we're expected to believe this world is already familiar with them all.  With certain liberties taken from the 1st 12 issues of The Ultimates, Marvel does a nice job of putting a few stories into their one feature film.  And now that we know who all the characters are, we can enjoy them in Ultimate Avengers II, coming out in June '06, which will be an entirely new story not taken from the original Marvel universe, nor the Ultimate universe.  This DVD is to be watched again and again and enjoyed every time.  A must for a fan of any versions of The Avengers.",1140307200,9,1159,4.378504672897196
2461575,5,B000CEVC9W,"For years now, post-childhood animation fans have complained that most, if not all, comic-book-based action series have been thematically hobbled by the demands of TV network executives, which rarely allow for a series to adapt the parent comic books' content `as is'.  Ultimate Avengers, produced independently of a TV network, seeks to redeem comic-book action in animated form.

This movie is loosely based on the Ultimates comic book series, by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch.  The comic book offers a revisionist take on Marvel Comics' venerable superheroes such as Captain America, the Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Mighty Thor, and more.  Opening during Captain America's World War II origins, the film finds him flash-frozen in Arctic waters after diverting a nuclear bomb from USA shores.  Thought to be killed in action, he is accidentally discovered and revived in today's world.  General Nick Fury of SHIELD (a quasi-military US intelligence agency) recruits `Cap' to be one of his new team of `Avengers', super-powered champions who will fight against threats that the traditional authorities (including the military) can't handle.

The main threat that now faces them is an alien invasion of shape-changers.  The Avengers team also includes Hank Pym, aka Giant-Man, whose super-power is self-explanatory; his girl Jan, who becomes the fairy-like Wasp;  daredevil billionaire Tony Stark, aka Iron Man;  the vainglorious Thor, who claims to be a mythological deity; and brooding scientist Bruce Banner, aka the Hulk.  Also in the mix is the mysterious Russian expatriate called the Black Widow.

The main conflict involves the team's formation with their conflicting personalities, which they must somehow get over in order to repel the alien threat; however, there is another threat bubbling underneath the surface-Bruce Banner.  Currently, his mental control over his brutish alter ego the Hulk is assured-but for how long?

The specter of 90's animation pioneer Bruce Timm looms large over all comic-book related productions that have come together in his wake.  In defense of Ultimate Avengers, there are several animation veterans involved in this production, including Curt Geda and Greg Johnson, who have both worked on DC/Warner cartoons in the 90's.  The look of the characters is closely modeled after Hitch's original comics drawings, but adapted to be more fluid in animation. Produced in association with prominent indie studio Lion's Gate, Ultimate Avengers clearly makes the most of what was likely a modest budget, mostly involving cel animation combined with some CGI.  Hopefully, animation buffs aren't totally spoiled by the CGI revolution to appreciate cel productions (outside of Japanese anime'); and hopefully `toon aficionados won't be relentlessly jaded against non-Timm superhero productions.

This is the first in a planned series of straight-to-dvd animated productions by Marvel & Lion's Gate.  The next planned feature is The Ultimates Vol. 2, followed by an Iron Man solo feature and finally Dr. Strange.  If the producers can maintain the quality, then hopefully this should prove that there is a market for animated superhero fantasy outside of Disney-Pixar satire.",1140048000,17,3204,5.460446247464503
2461576,1,B000CEVC9W,"All I'm gonna say is thanks again Lions Gate for totally butchering something that I truely love.  Now maybe you'll call me a fangirl picking the movie apart.  Well whatever, if you accept this as a good movie you need to go back and re-read the book cause obviously you missed something.  ""The Ultimates"" is about alot more than just re-introducing the Avngers to the younger generation.  This movie completely miss's that.  Oh and as far as all you Amazonian's out there giving this a good review and telling others to ignore the bad ones, you're exactly the people Lions Gate is banking on rushing right out to buy this without first reading reviews.  This movie might maybe be worth renting on the Avengers name alone, however anyone looking for The Ultimates here should go back and re-read the books, because there's nothing Ultimate about this movie(aside from Ultimate Marvel Sell-Out)at all.",1139875200,12,900,4.8881578947368425

8098337,4,B000CEVC9W,"The animated Ultimate Avengers is based on the Ultimates which is a version of the Avengers in an alternate reality.  The Ultimates was supposed to be a darker, more grounded, and supposedly adult take on what it would look like for seriously flawed superhumans to come together as a team and perform a governments bidding.  Everyone in that series had some dirt deeply imbedded underneath their fingernails, and they all had red in their ledger as the Black Widow put it so nicely in the theatrical Avengers movie.  Ultimate Avengers in the animated version certainly plays up the character flaws of Hank Pym, Bruce Banner, Thor, and Nick Fury but its tamed down quite a bit from the comics.  It might not be safe for kids (some of whom may be startled at the addled Bruce Banner and the marauding, ferocious Hulk) but it could certainly appeal to teenage boys in particular.  There is a lot of political philosophy that gets tied into the moral conundrums of our heroes.  Captain America of course still comes out looking the shiniest out of all of the heroes; he is still a soldier and a government lackey but he is willing to question and willing to lead with his heart, and he is willing to sacrifice himself so others are more prone to follow him despite his portrayal as someone who suffers from serious self-doubt.  While Chitauri alien spies are the obvious villains here perhaps the real villain is Banners Hulk who practically dismantles the team in a matter of minutes and proves himself to be an immense threat.  The quandary of controlling him as a guided missile or killing him (if even possible) is traipsed around and gives this movie a decidedly different and adult tone.  It could be a good movie to discuss with a teenager the different ideas that are imbedded within it, and in some ways its very politically relevant to todays headlines.",1513987200,,1859,4.712962962962963
