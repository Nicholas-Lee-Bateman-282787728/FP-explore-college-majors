8222062,5,B000WBJCO2,"I just received this DVD in the mail today & it's playing now. I may be up late in the evening to watch it to the end.  I saw Daniel last fall in Minot, ND at the HostFest - fulfilling a many year wish to see & hear him in person.  He is indeed wonderful & was well worth the wait.  This DVD is from 1994 & I feel he is improving with age.  I love his shows on PBS & have his latest on my TV-DVR & have watched it many times already.",1426464000,,433,3.574468085106383
