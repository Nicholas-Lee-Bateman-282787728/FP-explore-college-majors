808384,4,6304168659,"TONI WHITNEY HAD IT ALL, A FAMILY LOVE NO OTHER KID WOULD EVER DREAM ON HAVING ONLY TO HAVE IT INTERRUPTED BY A BABY SEAL LATER NAMED ANDRE.

THIS SEAL CHANGE THE LIVES OF THE WHOLE FAMILY, EVEN MANAGE TO CONFRONT JELOUSY AMONG THE FAMILY MEMEBER AND NEIGHBORS.

BUT IT ALSO MANAGE TO GIVE TONI THE UNDSTANDING ON HOW AN ANIMAL AS A SEAL COULD GIVE AND RECIVE LOVE FROM HUMAN AND NOT BE AFRAID ANY HUMAN MIGHT HURT THEM.

THIS IS A NICE MOVIE, ACTUALLY A FAMILY MOVIE AND IT ALSO TEACH US A MESSAGE. EVEN THE ENDING IS BREATH TAKING. DONT MISS YOU I KNOW I WONT.",1126483200,,562,4.137614678899083
808385,3,6304168659,"Toni Whitney (Tina Majorino) and her family rescue an injured baby seal and name him Andre (a sea lion plays the title character, as seals are too unreliable to train). You'd think the fine flippered friend would blend right in with the Whitney menagerie - they share their seaside home with everything from frogs to dogs - but he's a mischievous mammal who wins one enemy too many in the person of a drunken fisherman (played by Keith Szarabajka) who believes that Andre is the culprit that tore his net. Watch for original 16 mm films of the real Andre during the credits. Not a bad kid-flick.

This film is reminiscient of Free Willy, but made for a younger audience.  However, as a family film, if you watch it pass the kleenex, as the last third of the movie rolls. I like this movie, and so do my kids.",1085788800,16,390,4.5285714285714285

yes i realize these are parts from twister, air bud, and ghandi
but when rolled into one you get this movie, Andre, i would rather jump off of the grand canyon than watch this one.  my recomendation----NO WAY",1083283200,3,409,4.217948717948718
808388,4,6304168659,"The movie is captivating, and the acting is good, but nobody seems to be able to imitate the coastal Maine accent right, and Andre was a wild Harbor seal, not a trained sea lion.  I lived near Boston in the 70s, and Andre was quite the celebrity every October when he arrived at the New England Aquarium, and every TV news station tracked his progress when he left in the spring, based on eyewitness reports.  He was a real charmer who knew how to work a crowd.  He was a wild seal, but his heart belonged to Harry, and his love for Harry always took him back to Rockport year after year.  I saw Andre perform 3 times, including his last performance, when he half-heartedly did a few tricks then raced out to sea for the last time.  For me, the movie wasn't as good as the real thing.  But if you never saw Andre, and you want a well-done, funny, heartwarming family movie, this is it.  Enjoy!",1078444800,35,893,4.279761904761905

SHE BRINGS OUT THE BEST IN THIS MOVIE AND SHE MAKES IT TOTALLY REAL, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. I HAVE PURCHASED MANY COPIES OF THE FILM AND HAVE GIVEN THEM AS GIFTS TO FRIENDS WITH CHILDREN.

She made me promise to buy this movie for  her for her birthday which is coming up in two weeks.  When I told her that  the movie was based on a true story she was amazed.  We had to get online  and print out pictures of the real Andre so she could show her mom.  I  think this is one of those movies that you could just watch over and over  again.

This is an enjoyable and well-acted story ... almost in spite of itself.  The concept may have been based on a  true story but who would know after Hollywood finished with it?  The  formula ""crisis"" had me yawning but the acting of Chelsea Field  as the young girl, Keith Szarabajka as the disgruntled Billy Baker along  with the totally enchanting seal, saved the day.

There were certain parts that I didn't remember would be inappropriate for their age. They were quick to point out to NaNa that there was bad language. Also the dating g portion of the movie was a bit mature for them. I realize that a lot of children nowadays are exposed to these things at an early age.

Tina Majorino is absolutely precious -- what a gifted actress she was already back in 1994.  (She's all grown up now and has acted in multiple roles -- remember Dr. Heather Brooks in ""Gray's Anatomy""?)

This follows a family of five going through their normal everyday life when their dad brings home a seal to nurse back to health. Or at least what he thought it was only going to be. It continues on an emotional and hilarious roller coaster. The seal that plays Andre in this movie is amazing himself. The tricks he did in this movie are hysterical. The bond between animals and humans is such an important part of this movie and the main reason I connected to it.

The sadness and love shown in this movie is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. It's just the perfect classic family movie all around!",1447718400,3,879,4.321212121212121

809647,5,6304168659,"Hi, I'm Camille Bajema reporting for KIDS FIRST! and today I'm reviewing the 1994 film ""Andre,"" based on the book ""A Seal Called Andre"" which is based on a true story. I like this film because I'm an animal lover and this film is filled with animals.

""Andre"" is about a little girl, Toni Whitney, played by Tina Majorina, who lives with her parents Harry and Thalice, played by Shane Meier and Chelsea Field; her sister, Paula, played by Aidan Pendleton; and her brother Steve, played by Keith Carradine. They have an assortment of animals, and decide to adopt an orphaned, baby seal that that they name Andre. Andre lives with the Whitney's for a few years, until a man from the health department shows up and wants to take Andre away!

My favorite character in this film is Toni's mother, Thalice. I like Thalice because she is very loving toward her kids, yet also knows how to discipline them.

My favorite scene in this movie is when Andre learns funny tricks and performs them for people on the pier. I like this scene because Andre is so cute and funn. An interesting fact is that Andre is played by a sea lion, not a seal, in the movie.

""Andre"" is directed by George Miller and produced by Annette Handley. The music in this film sets the mood. The movie is filmed in a beautiful harbor in Rockport, Maine and I especially love the cinematography when the seasons change.

This movie is a tear-jerker and Toni learns that despite how much she loves Andre she may have to let him go. This is a family-friendly movie and I recommend it to people of all ages. I give this film five-out-of-five stars because I thought that the movie was really well-done overall and had a great plot. I am pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this movie so much because the picture on the cover made me think that it would appeal to a younger audience.",1351468800,,1841,4.5

809741,5,6304168659,"Andre is an amazing story about an incredibly smart seal who becomes close to his new family (people).  While most people will probably look at the film as just a regular family movie, I actually got something else out of it.  While watching the movie I learned to appreciate seals.  You know it's always been a mystery just how smart some of the sea animals really are, such as dolphins and seals.

Well, watching the way Andre communicates with the people in the movie, you can sense he's a highly intelligent animal.  Some of his mannerisms such as sticking his tongue out in front of the people he didn't like, and being able to do a variety of tricks without missing a beat shows just how well a seal can understand humans.  I was sitting there totally amazed how smart Andre was.  I was also amazed that an animal that came from the ocean was able to fit in so well with humans.

Dogs are also really smart animals, and some of Andre's facial expressions reminded me of my dad's girlfriend's basset hound.  I believe after you finish watching the movie, you too will be amazed at the level of intelligence seals have.  I simply didn't know how smart they are, but this movie really opened my eyes.  Highly recommended.",1188259200,,1224,4.5181818181818185
809742,3,6304168659,"If you are looking for wholesome family entertainment for young kids, you might be glad to know a few things about this movie.  A fisherman repeatedly threatens to shoot Andre, he gets drunk, attacks Andre with a pitchfork, and gets into a fistfight with the dad.  Later on there is a scary struggle with a shotgun.  There is swearing.  There are two scenes with dead seals.  The dad is likable but has problems understanding his kids which adds stress to the movie.

I'm not saying all these things are bad.  You just might like to know as  you decide.

There are some funny scenes and the dad mostly is able to solve his family problems. However, based on feedback from my kids age 6 and 9, the negatives had more of an impact than the positives.",1170028800,26,748,4.4411764705882355
