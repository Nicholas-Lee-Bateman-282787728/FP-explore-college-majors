8105671,4,B000E48NWY,"Obviously any documentary produced within just a few years of an event is going to suffer a bit as a result. But THE IRAQ WAR: ONE YEAR LATER does a fine job of history, analysis, and detachment. It covers the pre-war period as well as the war itself. Good commentary, interviews, and great footage give a good overall account of events. As with most documentaries it is a bit shy on maps.  It of course lacks some of the deeper analysis of events we are only just now beginning to see. It does not really cover post-war events. Overall it is a great documentary that should hold up for years to come.",1148169600,6,601,4.366071428571429
