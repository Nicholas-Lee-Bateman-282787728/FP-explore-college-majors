My sides hurt from laughing so much.  no, Bob and Tom are not the ones doing the show, it is other commedians, and they are well picked.  You will not be dissappointed!",1364601600,,269,4.115384615384615
8201293,3,B000RL6G96,"As a Bob and Tom listener on the radio, this was not the best of their comedians (except for Greg Warren-but still dated and over done. Think Fluteman Greg). I had seen this years ago and should have let it as a good memory.",1352505600,,224,4.113636363636363

8201295,4,B000RL6G96,"The Bob and Tom Show was my favorite radio program, till it disappeared off the airwaves here in Austin Texas. So when I ran across this Bob and Tom DVD recently, I immediately ordered it. I hate to say it, but I was really a bit disappointed with it after it came. What disappointed me was that there is very little of Bob and Tom featured on this DVD, they come out at them beginning and announce the first comedian and again at the end to say ""bye!"" - total time combined probably less than 5 minutes. There is a brief, behind-the-scenes feature - but even in that they just appear in the background. The picture of the two of them on the cover of the case pretty much sums up the whole of their performance.

Aside from that disappointment, I'm happy to say that the five comedians featured are pretty funny. Since this is just a 70 minute video, they each perform for around 10~15 minutes - but most manage to pack in some pretty funny bits.

I'm giving this 4-Stars, just for the comedians.",1193184000,5,996,4.349462365591398
