8108095,3,B000EBFJS8,"Somewhat overhyped. The rare footage of pre and post earthquake San Fransisco is great. However, the quake depiction is very weak. I don't know what other reviewers are raving about here. All they show is the actual seismograph reading in front of a hilly landscape that looks like we are under water. The earthquake depiction in Damndest Finest Ruins is much better. I was expecting something on par with the 1936 San Fransisco movie that had a way better sequence  as well. I don't see what one reviewer said about watching it first before letting kids see it?? The earthquake scenes in the 1974 and 1990 movies are way more scary, graphic and engaging than this! Other than this disappointment, the footage alone makes it worth adding to the documentary shelf.",1521590400,,763,4.824427480916031
8108096,5,B000EBFJS8,"The first time I watched this, I was astounded at how deeply moved I was for the people and the city of San Francisco.  This documentary cuts right to the heart of where the people lived, and what it was like to have your world wiped out in a matter of minutes.  The camera work, editing, writing and music are superb.  Thankfully director Ken Joy had the good taste to bypass the melodramatics of the politic hijinx in the city, and instead create a film that captures the pathos of the plight of a city where two-thirds of it's citizens are suddenly homeless and destitute.  This is a MUST-SEE, and MUST-OWN title if you're interested in the best documentation of this horrible calamity.  I'm a collector of all things ""SF quake"" and this is one of my favorite items in this collection.  I've watched it six or seven times now.",1153699200,5,829,4.493333333333333
8108097,4,B000EBFJS8,"First I want to start by saying I'm a third generation San Francisican. My family lived through the Earthquake.

I have seen most of the DVDs and videos on the subject and this is by far the best. Both the film making/editing and the opportunity to see photos and film seen nowhere else make this disk a must for any interested in the subject. (Please take seriously the warning regarding the intensity of this film and view it yourself before sharing with your children.)

The only reason I'm giving it four stars (and I'd give four and a half if I could) is because of the misinformation on the packaging. The disk is identified as running 75 minutes and it runs just under 65. It is also labeled as 5.1 sound but it is only dolby digital. (By the way crank up your base as the earthquake can get your room vibrating.

So in spite of the four star rating, if you are only buy one disk on the 06 Earthquake this is the one to buy.",1152576000,8,931,4.248587570621469
8108098,5,B000EBFJS8,"I was moved to tears by this story of tragedy and triumph surrounding the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.  This documentary goes to the heart of the story and tells you what life was like for the PEOPLE who lived before, during, and after the quake.  This story is told with great heart and love through wonderful narration by Cochran Keating, and incredible writing and direction by Ken Joy.  Amazingly, the plight of the Chinese, who were displaced by the destruction of Chinatown, is uncovered here to show how cruelly they were treated during the entire ordeal. The photos and the footage of the city, before and after, are simply astounding.  I'm a junior high school teacher, and I'm going to make sure this title is in our library and will recommend it to our school district as a must-have title that chronicles the true story of the San Francisco quake and what it was like to survive it.  Kudos to writer/director Ken Joy for an incredible contribution to the documentation of American History.  I can't wait to see what he does next.",1152316800,8,1043,4.7032967032967035
8108099,5,B000EBFJS8,"I bought both this title (at Borders), and the National Geographic's DVD about the quake, and this title is hands down the best.  The narration, writing and editing are all top notch, with an original full-orchestra score to boot!  The earthquake sequence is incredible, but the real heart of this DVD is, well, it's heart.  It takes an in-depth look the city San Francisco was BEFORE the quake, how it's citizens coped and rebuilt.  This is my favorite kind of documentary without the talking heads and the cheesy recreations.  It focuses on the information of the disaster itself, as well as the ""heart"" of how tragic this was for all those people.  If you want an ""inside"" look at the 1906 quake and fire, this is the DVD you should get.  My hat is off to director Ken Joy, who is also credited as the writer/producer.  He uses real footage of the quake and aftermath, not some cheesy camera shaking at bad actors, and some of the most incredible photos you've ever seen of the devastation of the city.  Watch out Ken Burns.  Another Ken is moving in on your territory.  I plan to keep a look out for other documentaries of his.",1147651200,11,1131,4.522167487684729
