8577743,3,B00C6MXB42,"The original segments always started out with an ""old Indy"" in his nineties in a doctor's office, park or wherever and someone would say something and the ""old Indy"" would remark; ""That reminds me of the time"". Then there would be a flashback. At the end of the segment it would go back to the ""old Indy"". It's not in this collection, I am very disappointed. I like that sort of thing.",1440201600,,385,4.361111111111111

8577747,5,B00C6MXB42,"We had the set on VHS Tapes and were sadden when we upgraded to DVD.  Fortunately, we found then on DVD and now enjoy a great series with historical information as well as being entertaining.  This is a hidden favorite for those Indiana Jones Fans.",1374537600,7,248,4.488888888888889
8577748,5,B00C6MXB42,"Filmed with a small crew all over the world, this usually very well written show took full advantage of foreign locations - even hiring local talent.
Other reviewers have done well describing it, so I'll skip the synopsis.
Highly recommended and VERY re-watchable!
The educational extras are nice, but the reason to get this is the show itself.",1367539200,5,344,4.948275862068965
