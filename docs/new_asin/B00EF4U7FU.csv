5911264,5,B00EF4U7FU,"Accel world is an awesome show, I'll start with that. This is part 1 of 2 and if you read my reviews of both youll see something funny with the scores. Anyways, Accel world takes place in the time of SAO so fans of that will want to check this out. Story wise our main hero is a fat short midget who is getting bullied and constantly harassed. One day though a beautiful girl tells him he can gain a power that few have, the catch, he must fight in various battles or forever lose that power and his memories of it. The plot, again in part 1, is excellent and it hits the right epic pacing you will want. There's very little down time and when there is it's needed to cool down and take in the story. Animation is wicked, the battles look stunning and the characters outside of combat are very unique. Sound is hit or miss dub and music wise but it's still fitting for the show. Overall if highly advise picking this up but I'd also advise looking for my review of part 2 as well. Part 1 however is awesome.",1434240000,,1007,4.142857142857143
5911265,4,B00EF4U7FU,"I have not really been into anime,  Watching Spirited Away is about my extent of experience with this genre!  I had a room mate a couple years ago who was watching this and after half paying attention while reading my book I started to get sucked in, but he moved away before we finished volume 2 and I forgot about it.  Recently I came across this and out of nostalgia decided to pick it up.

Visually it is very appealing to watch, the avatar landscapes are very imaginative and interesting! While the story focuses on junior high students, the content is surprisingly funny, and has enough plot, charachter development, and emotional depth that adults can also enjoy it. I do have to say that I enjoy watching it in Japanese with the English subtitles.  The translation in the subtitles is more mature and deeper,  the American dub translation can be a little on the  immature side, you definitely feel like you are watching a teen show with it,  and while the voices they chose are not bad, I feel that especially with Kuryokiheme the vocal quality and the translation give more depth and are more true to the character.  Also, there are several instances of the F word in the English dub that are not present in the English subtitles so if you are watching with younger children it is a safer choice!

Whichever you prefer it is great that you have the option of what language and subtitles you prefer!  The story has a lot of great moments about friendship and choosing the higher road without shoving your nose in it like a cheezy after school special.  I was able to genuinely care about and connect with each character, and the fight sequences are mixed in with enough personal development to have a good mix that can appeal to a wider range of viewers.",1430265600,,1762,4.5587301587301585
5911266,4,B00EF4U7FU,"I stumbled upon this anime at my local library in the teen section, and was shocked by how much I enjoyed it. It's not perfect, but it is pretty fun.

The premise is nifty and you can see the similar thinking from the creator of Sword Art Online with fateful dramatic moments decided by high speed combat with lots of yelling. Unfortunately this is the only aspect of the show that is merely mediocre instead of excellent. The fights are imaginative, but the pacing isn't quite perfect and the CGI doesn't have the same impact as the computer assisted animation of say... Angelic Layer or Sword Art Online. And unlike that show, rather than feeling like a natural progression of story, the fights seem like clich&eacute;s as the hero's health drops to nothing and then he makes a miraculous comeback over and over, and people work out the emotional hang-ups of their life through combat.

Thankfully the rest of the show is EXCELLENT. The main character is a fat, lonely loser and it's refreshing to see a hero who isn't a normal guy/average Joe but actually has a real-world reason for low self-esteem, loneliness, and being bullied. His transformation and salvation due to a mysterious benefactor and a strange digital world is great because it's actually fairly unconventional. His senpai is not a total ice queen, or a harsh demanding master, though she does have these tendencies. His friends are a girl who feels sorry for him and guy who feels jealous of him, and their reasons for what they do are actually quite interesting and complex.

The English dub is fantastic, with the hero's new confidant/guardian doing a particularly great job with her role. The writing for the real world segments is wonderful, and you really believe that this beautiful girl would like this guy who thinks he is just a fat loser due to her intelligence, sincerity, and loyalty.

All that said, this is definitely an unusual show. The Mecha action is okay, but the idea of accelerated digital time/space is kind of out there. The real-world implications could have resulted in some really interesting things, but mostly this is a show about battles in a virtual game world. If you like that sort of thing give it a try. Just be aware that while the dub is rated TV-14, it contains language that would not be shown on regular television (surprising).",1430179200,,2337,4.7772277227722775

5911270,5,B00EF4U7FU,One of the best anime out there. Too bad it's underrated and overshadowed by it's brother anime Sword Art Online :/ Both series are very good but I feel that Accel World is much better. If you watch both than the two of them will be even more interesting,1407283200,,254,4.204081632653061
5911271,5,B00EF4U7FU,"A lot to say here, compressed into whatever comes to mind at the moment. I decided pretty suddenly and randomly to try this. A long time ago I thought I remembered some things being said about this show I could barely remember now. My early impression going to episodes instead of trailers and comment was something like ""This guy turns into a pig, surrounded by other strange and tiny creatures. Is this some chibi creature show like Pokemon?"" That was early on, and right up to the moment of a smashed lunch and the pig playing sports, the first 12 or so minutes will give you a very different idea of what this show is. If you take a last step and go beyond the 12 minutes, you are introduced to the real point of the series. So I was very impressed with everything that followed. As of this writing I completed the series once to see if I liked it, bought the DVD, and now as far as the discs are concerned, I have finished disc 1. What this show really is is an action show with events that take place in different states of reality. The main character, who does have a ""pig form"" actually only uses this in a kind of casual online game play avatar. Something very typical, but here in the online world even a tiny body can be the fastest, strongest, and the best in games. He created this form for himself, but when he gets to try a little known fighting game, his inner personality and wishes create a body that is his ideal self in the fighting world. He becomes the Silver Crow, a metallic hero styled fighter with a lot of potential.

If I haven't made the point, after my early impressions of the show, this is very, very good! I got to thinking quickly I was wrong about the show, and it was actually great! I went through the series so fast the first time, Hoping that it would not drop in quality at some point later, But it is great! When I finished it I ordered DVDs on the spot! One catch for me, a language learner only comes from subtitles locked on if you buy the blu ray edition. So to cover my need for the show with the subtitle off option I bought the DVD version. I needed that, I wanted that, it would have been nice with the quality of blu ray, but I grabbed the DVDs for that. All around good show. Try it!",1395964800,,2234,4.207459207459207
5911272,5,B00EF4U7FU,"This first set is amazing despite being a sub-par Blu-ray release I was thoroughly impressed with the animation and story, and most of all the fights.  The characters are developed very nicely in the first part as well im very eager to see what will become of them in part 2.

Alot of people seem to dislike this show due to the pathetic and obese main character, but thats what makes him so special.  Obviously there aren't many heroes like this one but that isn't the point.  Due to the insecurities with his physical appearence and his meek nature the avatar he creates is that much stronger to make up for it.  In the real world he is pathetic but in the cyber universe of Brain Burst he fully utilizes his creative urges.

I don't know why people don't like this series but please just ignore them and give it a shot! (also I bought this for $33, I recommend you put it on the wish list and wait for the price to go down)",1392768000,,926,4.2628571428571425
5911273,5,B00EF4U7FU,"I caught onto Accel World one day as I was browsing Newgrounds, and looked into a few episodes.

One thing I can say right up front, is as with it's cousin series, Sword Art Online, much of the series is devoted into building the Universe that the series is housed in.  I did not notice it until my second viewing, but the first 4 episodes are almost pure exposition and background information on the world that Haru and Princess Snow Black Inhabit.  (Sorry, but I am not going to try and spell the Japanese names)

One of the standouts I have to pint out, that drew me to the series, were the ways in which it differed form the vast majority of other Anime I have seen (mirrored in some ways in SAO).

Firstly, is the main character.  This was the first time I have ever seen a little fat kid in the staring roll.  It was great, as the seeing him jump from awkward and shy in most situations, to how confident he becomes when dealing with the Virtual World is a great dynamic, and is very rarely used as an easy joke, and when it is, it feels honest.

The Second, is the Female lead, who, at the time, was the first actual strong female lead I had ever seen in an Anime.  Unlike so many others, it isn't good until the male shows up, and then is suddenly weak and in need.  Her motivations and scars are always evident, and while interacting with the male lead does change her, it is a smooth personal growth curve, rather then a complete personality shift.  (I would harken it to Remy's growth in Black Lagoon)

If you like techy type jargon, fun, mostly interesting characters, some good jokes, and genuinely funny moments, along with a feel heartwarming moments, this is a fairly well rounded offering.",1390262400,10,1706,4.380952380952381
5911274,2,B00EF4U7FU,"I was really looking forward to this one as the battle animation looked unique and the nerdy awkward-around-girls character was finally a fat kid.  This series created a really interesting gaming world.  The characters have computer access in their brains (like Ghost in the Shell), and playing a fighting game for points allows them to freeze time, or more accurately, speed up their brain so that they can make extremely articulate decisions in difficult situations and come out on top.  Winning lunchroom fights, excelling in sports and taking test are made easy.  If you lose all your points in the fighting game though, you are exiled from using the ability for life.

Great premise.  Her comes the clich' anime crutches to decapitate a great world.

- The main character is surrounded by different girl archetypes.  The cool girl, the friend next door, the nerd, and the cute enemy.  They are all there to keep him confused and terrified, and what a shocker, they all play the game.

- The first male combatant he faces is defeated and rightfully takes an allies place assuming the Vegeta/Piccolo role.

- Every battle reduces his life gauge to nothing before a single attack is mustered with underdog courage and executed with the war cry, ""I must protect something!""

- New rules to the game only surface right when their useful to character and diminish any problem solving or intensity from a fight.

- Every outside character is a girl that our hero could potentially have a crush on.  With all these girls, the viewer has to connect with one of them, right!?

- One hit victories are the end to every fight because the hero has the right attitude.

All in all, this has a great world that's made foolishly predictable by placid writing, character clones, and painful prepubescent fan service.  It is also one sad voice in a huge chorus of ""video games are real"" anime that have saturated the market recently.  Future Diary, C: Control, Sword Art Online, Btooom!  There are a ton of better versions of this genre out there.  Next to these, the Accelerated World slows to a crawl and reminds you that your money is better spent elsewhere.  A good effort, but not good enough.  There's just too much better material out there.",1387670400,3,2235,4.765625
5911275,2,B00EF4U7FU,"So the basis premise is that you have this fat kid....and when I say fat I mean morbidly obese, who gets the hottest girl at school because he is good at computer games.  So it ticks all the fanboy boxes but said couch slug makes Shinji Ikari as self confident and erudite as George Clooney.  Without doubt one of the most annoying characters to every stumble over its own untied shoe laces and land with a quivering splat.",1387584000,,423,4.410256410256411
5911276,3,B00EF4U7FU,"How could people review this months before it's released? I pre-ordered this and just received it the day after Thanksgiving.

Finally, Accel World sees official US blu-ray release. Viz sure did take their sweet time in releasing this. Volume one of the Japanese blu-ray was released back in July 2012, and the final volume, volume 8, was released at the end of February 2013. The joke is, the Japanese release already contain English subtitle. Viz actually subbed the show and simulcasted it during the original Japanese TV broadcast. Instead of releasing the blu-ray quickly to ride on the popularity of the show and Sword Art Online, they decided to wait this long.

Anyway, to the set itself. This is set number one, containing episode 1 through 12 spanning 2 discs. English dub is included. In comparison, the same 12 episodes spanned 4 blu-ray volumes in Japan. So what's missing? The parody specials Akucheru waarudo are missing. Also missing are the commentaries by the original Japanese voice actors. I guess Viz think they are not important. Also, the Japanese blu-rays include bonuses like soundtrack and short stories from the author. Obviously none of these made it. Having only one set also means we are missing the great box arts of the different volumes from the original.

The upside, we don't have to buy 4 different volumes.

You can read synopsis about Accel World in many places, including here, so I won't belabor too much about the story. It is based on a light novel by the same name. I think Accel World is great, having a refreshingly non-traditional protagonist. In turn, it allows great character development in the story. The anime follows the novel pretty closely, but it is unfortunate that there are some of the character backgrounds and details skipped in the anime. It is still a great adaptation and I am grateful that Sunrise did it.

Before we go further, the episodes in this blu-ray are uncensored. I don't know if the dub in Neon Alley are uncensored, but Viz' simulcast of the anime was censored as they used the censored Japanese TV broadcast.

Voice actor wise, Accel World has many well known ones. Haruyuki is voiced by Yuuki Kaji. He is an excellent voice actor, voicing many great characters, including Hope in FF13 and Eren Yeager in Attack on Titan. His performance here is excellent too. Kuroyukihime is voiced by Sachika Misawa. She is a fairly new voice actress. One of her most recent work is Arisa in Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki. She also sings the second ending, and many image songs of Kuroyukihime. Takumu is voiced by Shintarou Asanuma. I'm mostly familiar with him as Kaito Daimon in Phi Brain. Chiyuri is voiced by Aki Toyosaki. I was surprised since she also voiced Medaka in Medaka Box. Niko is voiced by RIna Hidaka, the same voice actress as Silica from SAO. Again, it is extremely unfortunate that Viz decided to ditch their commentaries as they are very entertaining.

I had doubts on the English dub. Anime English dubs nowadays usually have decent voice actors too. However, they are usually hampered by the director, script, and the highly annoying thing called localization. Accel World fell halfway into the same trap. It's one thing to translate the dialogues with some minor adjustment to fit the mouth movements, but I find it insulting for a dub to change the original dialogues and details for no reason, and/or remove/minimize the culture of the original language.

So what has Viz done? Eliminating honorifics. Honorifics are part of the Japanese culture, and their use is personafied in Accel World to illustrate Haru's character and his behavior towards Kuroyukihime. I'm talking about the word ""senpai,"" which is what Haru uses to call Kuroyukihime. Now, in other anime, the dub can usually get away with this by using the characters' names since the names of the characters are known. Problem is, nobody knows Kuroyukihime's real name other than the original author. So by eliminating the honorific senpai, the dialogues in Accel World can feel weird and awkward. Luckily, looks like Viz realized that it didn't work so they allowed Haru to say senpai in later episodes. There are other minor annoyances, like the elimination of -kun, and -chan (Taku calling Chiyu as ""Chi"" instead of ""Chi-chan"" felt extremely awkward). The few early episodes of the dubbed Accel World were very painful to watch, but the pain subsides along the way. In the end, with Viz allowing the use of ""senpai,"" the dub becomes increasingly acceptable, even more than the subtitle itself as the subtitle is completely void of honorifics.

Another thing I dislike is changing the details of the original work. Viz had the Neuro Linker and other devices (like Aqua Current's tablet) voiced. Why? They are not voiced in the original. Sunrise did such a great job on the UI design, with many dialog boxes having English on them so they are self explanatory. But no, I guess Viz thought the audience are not that bright so they have to put voice in to explain what's going on. Problem is, this created inconsistencies. One can start wondering why the neuro linker has voice in this situation but not the other. It's a mess, and betrayed the original work.

Don't get me started on the changes in some of the dialogues. They are few, but I still don't understand the reasoning behind those changes

The English voice actors themselves are generally okay. I like Taku's voice when he's evil. Yellow Radio is okay too. Kuroyukihime's voice feels too artificial. Haruyuki is okay in some situations, but feels too overdone in others. I don't like Niko's though. Of course, I can argue that the script and the direction are more of the issue. The VAs can only do so much.

I like Viz effort on the OP, making the credits appear pretty much the same as the original. They also did not reuse the same OP for all episodes as Takumu is seen wearing his glasses in the OP after the first arc (a neat thing that Sunrise did). However, they got lazy on the ED by just doing a scrolling credit.

For extras, there are only character gallery, clean OP and ED, the English dub trailer, and other anime trailers. Pretty poor. Clearly Viz did not put too much effort here, ditching the Japanese commentaries and the specials. The least they could've done was put the original Japanese trailers, or put some info about the light novel and/or the original author, Reki Kawahara.

5 stars for the anime, but 3 stars for this blu-ray release. The exclusions of the specials and commentaries are just lazy on Viz' part, considering they have waited this long to release this.

Considering the unlikelihood of a second season, I guess I should just be grateful that we finally have an official release of Accel World. Accel World has 24 episodes total. There is no release date yet for the second set. I hope that Aniplex' release of SAO will boost interest again on the franchise, and in the extremely slim likelihood, encourage Sunrise to do season 2.",1385683200,5,6996,4.8134887593671944

It has great action, is dramatic at the right times, has the perfect element of suspense from episode to episode, and has a bit of romance to complete the masterpiece.  The characters are all unique and don't get annoying.

This series was made by the same person that made Sword Art Online and have similar characteristics, but in my opinion this show is better.

5911279,4,B00EF4U7FU,"Accel World was created by the author of Sword Art Online, and features many of the same concepts seen in the series. Characters in this series wear a Neuro linker device that aids them with their day to day lives, including school work, and gaming.

Haruyuki Arita is the main character of this series, he's a somewhat chubby teenager who is low on confidence due to being bullied at school, until one day he meets a girl called Kuroyukihime.

Contains: Episodes 1-12
Languages: English, Japanese
Subtitles: English
Blu Ray Region: A

Upon meeting Kuroyukihime, she takes a strong interest in him, and after linking with his neuro linker installs a program called 'Brain Burst' onto it, and teaches him about the Accelerated world. Without getting into the science of the idea, the neuro linker can basically accelerate the users perception of time. And while minutes, if not hours can pass in the accelerated world, not a great deal of time passes in the real world.

Brain Burst is like a Virtual Reality fighting game, after having a strange dream, and Harayuki awakens his new avatar 'Silver Crow', this is what he uses to fight in Brain Burst. All Burst Linkers are linked to a local network, so while the characters are at school, or generally walking around the city they can see who is in their area and challenge them to battles if they wish.

During Battles, a Virtual Reality field appears over the real world, and characters do battle on the gaming field, while their real bodies stay motionless in the real world.

As with any game, Haruyuki slowly but surely gets to grips with the Brain Burst program, while at the same time gets closer to Kuroyukihime.

This volume introduces the characters, explains the Brain Burst program, and features some decent battles. Most of these episodes are based around the school area, and the city where the characters live. The series does a good job introducing new characters and giving them some depth.

The dub in this series is decent enough, the Japanese is too. The animation is consistently decent throughout and I found this series to be very likable.

I thought this series was quite well done.",1380067200,17,2155,4.802702702702702

Don't watch the dub. It is filled with f-words, I was shocked to hear it! It kind of just made me laugh at first, then it went away for a while, but later on the series it will be back with a vengeance and becomes annoying.

The show has an interesting story and great animation. I don't generally find the characters appealing to look at, but rather it's the robots that I prefer to have on the screen. There are different styles of robots from different designers. It's refreshing that they are not giant robots as in most Sunrise productions. The characters play a video game where they are the robots. I like Scarlet Rain and Lime Bell.

There is too much focus on bullying for my taste. It was fine to introduce the story with that, but move on to something else already. Not every bad guy needs to be a school bully. When I play video games online I don't bully others, I just beat them.",1472601600,,1201,4.258771929824562
