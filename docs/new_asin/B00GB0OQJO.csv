8621777,3,B00GB0OQJO,"Again, as I wrote for season 1, the overall series is great, but due to the lack of English subtitles on the songs of a musicial type of series I have to dock off 2 stars for having to guess what's being said for most of an episode sometimes. I paid for English subtitles and I get them on dialog only, very disappointed at the English subtitle company. The anime itself is excellent 5 stars though.",1417910400,,399,4.2631578947368425

8621780,5,B00GB0OQJO,"I wrote a review of the blu-ray for the first season of this series, and I must say, I really did enjoy watching through this second season as well.

Of course, as a warning, this second season does leave quite a bit left to be desired, but is still a pretty great watch.

As usual, the shipping was really nice, ordered for prime 2-day delivery and got it on the scheduled day.

Performance-wise, as well, I have had no issues having run through it entirely in both English and Japanese, so that's another plus.

Basically, if you enjoyed the first season, you're most likely going to really enjoy this second season as well. And of course, if you're as much of a fan of this series as I am, then it's definitely worth the money to show some support to the creators/developers.",1396224000,,778,4.457746478873239

8621782,5,B00GB0OQJO,"Yeah there are some sappy parts in this season, but my favorite part was the last episode where it looks like moe anime girls are overpowering the guys in halo costumes. Personally I've never liked halo or those other crappy games and it's funny because the AKB0048 girls make the guys in halo costumes look pathetically weak. Yep a good anime.",1390867200,,344,4.655737704918033
