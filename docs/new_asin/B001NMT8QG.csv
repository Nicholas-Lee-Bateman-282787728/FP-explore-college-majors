8327387,2,B001NMT8QG,"I have taken an interest in some of the experts that are casting doubt on the governments version of 911
This was the fifth film I have watched on the topic. This film was horribly edited which made it almost impossible to watch; I had to turn it off about 2/3's into it. It was made up of dozens of film clips of
 Rupperts  speeches and testimony. I think he is a credible guy but the film was just a bunch of clips jammed together with little or no narration to guide you through it. If you are interested in knowing more about 911 there are much better films on amazon, don't start with this one.",1408579200,,599,4.155172413793103

8327389,2,B001NMT8QG,"Lot's of good information, but some part are repeated 5 and 6 times. Would have been much better if it was about half as long.",1395014400,,126,4.08
8327390,5,B001NMT8QG,"If you want to learn about Peak Oil, 9-11, and future trends that you should be ready for, this is the man to go to. I also recommend his DVD ""The Truth and Lies of 9-11"" and an earlier DVD ""Collapse"" about peak oil. I have ordered his latest DVD ""Anima Mundi"", released in 2011 with Noam Chomsky and will write a review of that one when I receive it.",1379548800,,351,4.0285714285714285
8327391,5,B001NMT8QG,Ruppert is one of the best investigators the world has ever known....that's why he had to go into exile. The info on this DVD is worth a lot more than the price you will pay...do yourself a favor and get it.,1297209600,3,207,4.073170731707317
8327392,3,B001NMT8QG,"I found the information on this DVD invaluable, and well researched.  Unfortunately, the bad editing/piecing together of multiple speeches made it difficult to watch.  (reading his book, ""Crossing the Rubicon"" would be a good idea.)  That being said, i highly recommend Michael Ruppert's material... He's dedicated to his (our) cause, and should be heard by more people.  Also see the trailer for his movie: ""Collapse"" @ [...].",1266624000,4,427,5.3283582089552235
8327393,1,B001NMT8QG,"This is dated material and put together in a hodge podge fashion.  It leads off with a series of introducers all telling us what a brillian man Mr. Ruppert is.  In my mind I kept saying ""Well, let's hear what he has to say. You have already sold me.  I have bought the DVD.""  It is jarring to see Mr Ruppert speak one sentence in a suit jacket from one location and the next sentence in a different outfit from another location, and continue putting sentences together from mulitiple locations and dates.  It was irritating and the sentences don't always make the point because some are from a different context. In one case he speaking in 2006 about his forecast of energy of the future, predicting that in 2010 New Zealand and Australia will be having rolling blackouts due to energy shortage.  Well, this is 2010 and why haven't I heard of these event.  It weakens his credibility.  His DVD menu didn't work for me but maybe that was my DVD player.",1265155200,,951,4.488372093023256
8327394,2,B001NMT8QG,The information was pretty well dated and the DVD was of poor quality.  The information is good and scary but I was disappointed in the quality of the presentation.,1264982400,4,164,4.655172413793103
8327395,5,B001NMT8QG,"I had to watch this, after watching Mike Ruppert's excellent dvd Truth & Lies of 9/11 which should be watched by everyone who wants to know what really is going off.

This dvd combines several of his talks to make one continuous film, it is edited well and runs smoothly.

Its sad that Mike Ruppert has recently been very ill, which has put a stop to his public appearances, and put an end to his website(from the wilderness), I guess the people who he is trying to expose have got their way.

There are very few better speakers than Mike, the knowledge he has makes him a threat to the establishment, and I applaud his bravery for attempting to get the truth out for so many years.

Any one interested in 9/11 Truth, Peak Oil, CIA drug activity and other corruption within the US, should watch his DVDs and book ""Crossing the Rubicon"" If you need convincing where we are really heading this will do it.

While there are people like this we still have a chance of getting the truth, its just a shame that it has cost him so much.

Wishing you all the best for the future, I salute you !",1256083200,20,1086,4.299019607843137
