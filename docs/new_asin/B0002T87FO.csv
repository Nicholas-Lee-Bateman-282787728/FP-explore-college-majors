8031612,5,B0002T87FO,There is such a vast array of musicians discussing what the song means to them.  The documentary provides great insight of the song and the musicians they interview.,1372809600,,165,4.892857142857143
8031613,5,B0002T87FO,It's a well produced show that puts a whole new perspective on an old familiar song / ballad.  Lots of history involved here. It's very intersting as to how different artists put different interpretations on the same song.  IMO NPR should replay this every few years as a historical narrative.,1355184000,2,293,4.84
8031614,5,B0002T87FO,"I purchased this for my husband who recorded it when it was on tv years and years ago but lost the tape he had it on. My husband enjoyed the story, it is an old tape so the quality is a throw back but a great story of the song Danny boy and the relevance it has to them. There are tears shed I. The film and tears were shed while watching it. Great gift for someone who has a special place in their heart for Danny boy.",1353888000,,419,3.772727272727273
8031615,4,B0002T87FO,"I own this on VHS tape. I purchased it from PBS over 10 years ago. It probably cost thirty bucks then! LOL Looks like this is still the only way to see it (no DVD release yet). I posted a photo here on amazon, and if it helps, the PBS item # is DBSS-901.

Danny Boy provides a historical context for the song and its importance in music as well as significance for Ireland. Many musicians, both popular and unknown, put their own mark on Danny Boy.

A nice video, although I found the repeated cuts to the pretty girl playing a harp in the field a bit much. Conversely, Shane MacGowan can sing but boy is he tough to look at!

40 minutes.",1253491200,4,638,4.129032258064516
8031616,5,B0002T87FO,"It is one of the greatest musical videos ever!  The numerous performers finally do this great song justice.  Eric Clapton (instrumetal), MerriAnne Faithful (singing in a smoky bar), a young boxer's father singing about Danny, his dead son... and many others are just out of this world.  Impossible to find this video so far... but if you find it, get it!",1206057600,6,354,4.770491803278689
