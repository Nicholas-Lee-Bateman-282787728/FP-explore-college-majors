8597944,5,B00DUIFAQI,"I highly recommend purchasing and viewing the Unusual DVD which consists of six Louie Giglio teachings.  Father God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are the focus of all the teachings. God is always working for His glory and for our good - our hope is in the Creator.  God's almighty power, the power of the Cross, His grace and love is shown in the redemptive work of God.  Our God is extraordinary and He wants his people to live extraordinary lives that others may see Him in us.  Louie uses both the Old and New Testament Scriptures as he tells Bible stories about Daniel; Jacob, his son including Joseph, and their families; and the birth of Jesus.  Louie has the ability to make all of the stories interesting and skillfully weaves them together to demonstrate God's sovereignty, power and purpose.  I appreciate and enjoy Louie's presentation of God's Word.  He is never boring.  His pace is fast moving but he makes certain to carefully and clearly explains the purpose and meaning of the Scriptures.  The Unusual DVD is one that I will watch over and over again.  Nearly six hours of excellent teaching, this DVD is a bargain.",1411689600,3,1129,4.656565656565657
