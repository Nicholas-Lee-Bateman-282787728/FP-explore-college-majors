3668244,5,B001KPEB9K,"Before watching this movie I could not imagine how a film-maker could make moving a house interesting or rise above the technical.  However Moving Midway has plot, plot twists, drama, forward movement -- all of the elements that make for a good drama.  The focus is on the human element, on a South that was and what the South has become.  The film-makers intermix the moving of an historic structure from one site to to another with history, sociology, and discovery.  This is a very interesting effort.  The technical quality of this film is very good.",1279756800,,554,4.729166666666667
3668245,4,B001KPEB9K,"I don't remember how I came upon this film, where I learned of the title. Must have been a little bit of serendipity.

Though this is the story of one family's experiences, the themes are universal. Native southern myself, I recognized a lot of my heritage - some of it positive, and some not so much. Both the good and the bad were included in ""Moving Midway,"" nothing hidden, nothing swept under the rug.

The way the past was woven in with the present may be the documentary's best quality. As such it works well for those of us who are familiar with the themes, yet it would also be of interest to those without a direct southern lineage. Historians and genealogists could glean much from this one family's experience, one which is not at all uncommon. Even someone with only a passing interest in the South and its history would come away with a greater understanding of this difficult chapter in our country's history.

Highly recommended.",1273104000,2,945,4.6467065868263475

3668247,4,B001KPEB9K,I heard an interview of the creator of this DVD. His story was fasinating and I wanted to know more.  Meeting via DVD his family and the families of former slaves of his family was amazing--like seeing history unfold before you.  It made history come alive.  Can't wait to view it with my grandsons.,1245974400,,299,4.5

3668250,5,B001KPEB9K,"This is an excellent documentary that touches on issues of heredity and family, blacks and whites, southerners and Yankees, myths versus reality, and the can do spirit of preservation.  Urbanization is encroaching upon Midway, a southern plantation home; so the owners, descendants of the family who built the home during slavery, decide to relocate the house and a number of out buildings.  The house has much character (as do the collateral family members) and a resident ghost.  My only disappointment in the documentary is the lack of reference to the archeological activity that took place preliminary to the move.
I highly recommend this film to anyone who wishes to get a taste of current day sentiments for the romaticized southern plantation.",1241308800,,751,5.190082644628099
3668251,5,B001KPEB9K,"This is a very interesting movie whether you know the people or plantation house involved.  It shows the connection between the white and african american side of a family meeting and sharing their histories around the moving of the planation house that their mutual ancestors built and lived in.  It tells how yesterday is being preserved for today.
Not many homes nearly 200 years old have the original family still living in it and maintaining it so beautifully.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moving-Midway/dp/B001KPEB9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moving Midway</a>",1238976000,,613,6.463414634146342
3668252,4,B001KPEB9K,"Film critic Godfrey Cheshire goes behind the camera to capture an important chapter in his family history. It begins in 2004 when his cousin announces that their ancestral home, a plantation house in North Carolina, is going to be moved to a new location and the land sold to a shopping mall developer.

The massive effort that goes into separating a 150-year-old house from the land is just one of many interesting facets to this personal story that touches on the hot-button social issues of race and slavery that this country still grapples with, especially in the South. During the course of the film project documenting the move of the house, Cheshire reaches out to the African-American roots of his family tree, notably Dr. Robert Hinton, a professor at NYU whose grandfather was born into slavery at Midway Plantation. Hinton expresses very different feelings about the plantation house, the land it sits on, and what it means to separate the two.

Moving Midway successfully blends American social history, architecture and a thought-provoking musing on the mythology of the Southern plantation. Threaded throughout is the engaging story of Cheshire's discovery of his unexpected extended family.",1235174400,8,1205,5.206185567010309

3668256,5,B001KPEB9K,"I happened to see a review of this documentary when I was out of town, and purchased a local newspaper. I could hardly wait to return home to see if this was available. This story connects the past with the present in an engaging manner. Developers have no appreciation for history; how this family endured, by physically moving their home, and came to terms with a personal story of race relations is a wonderful testament to American perserverance.",1448150400,,450,4.782051282051282
3668257,5,B001KPEB9K,"This is an excellent documentary.  New York film critic Godfrey Cheshire chronicles the moving (literally, the moving) of his familys plantation home in North Carolina.  The home now finds itself on a highway, surrounded by traffic and big box stores.  The family seeks a quieter location for the home and moves it, very, very slowly, across the landscape, not along the highway.

In the course of the narrative we learn about the family history and the matriarch who traces her familys genealogy back to French and English aristocrats.  What is overlooked in this process is the fact that one of her ancestors coupled with one of their slaves.  Godfrey Cheshire and his relatives have African-American cousins.  Thus, the story is one of social change as well as architectural change.  The town in which the manse has been sited is now presided over by a black mayor.

Godfrey Cheshires doppelganger in this search is Dr. Robert Hinton, a black professor at NYU and, as it turns out, a family relative.  Together they talk about the house, the family, the past, our society, and themselves.  The result is both sweet and informative, but while this is GCs first film he is careful to insure that it is neither maudlin nor preachy.  It is, first and foremost, a documentary with charming, irascible, honest and funny people.  There is just the right distribution of emphasison history, on the family, on the engineering challenges of moving the house, and on our culture and society.

This is a sleeper film that deserves attention.",1429228800,,1532,4.910505836575876

3668260,4,B001KPEB9K,"This is a great look into Southern life as it was a 100 years ago and where that history has taken us.  It's real and documents the moving of a Southern plantation - each and every building.  Plus, it reveals new friendships/relationships along the way.  So tired of reading about racism in the South; this gave me hope for people to mingle, marry, mix, and most of all care about one another, being real and sharing our fears about interracial relationships.",1375315200,,459,4.6419753086419755
3668261,5,B001KPEB9K,"Seems like these days, directors think documentaries are boring, so they give you a talking head but then swirl around him so the viewer gets motion sickness.

This is not like that. Old style... and a great story...

a house on a back road that became a major highway

a family who thought they knew each other but got introduced to 100 relatives who were ignored due to racism and illigitimancy

and frankly the mechanisms and engineering and logistics planning it takes to move a big structure across back roads

Great story, good music, great use of helicopter footage as needed be, great use of shots to depict just how close the highway now was to the house, great history as to the entire mythology of the old southern plantation, good and bad

Most up, for me, seeing the joy of multiple races coming together and realizing they were kin by blood, wanting to hate each other ahead of time, but did not in person, were simply enthralled with the whole history of the place.

Producers suger coated nothing, don't misunderstand me.

It was complicated and messy and confused; they don't neglect that for a second.

An excellent film. I most liked that the director could afford a tripod. I get seasick from this handheld crap on TV all the time. Especially directors who can't abide a talking head on film for 10 seconds, who has to zoom in or out or something because it might be dull. Some of us old farts (I'm late 40s), actually are not strung out on ADD or ADHD drugs. We can handle it. Meantime, this incesant moving of the camera crap other guys pull off makes us nauseated.

I've watched this documentary 4 times now with assorted friends. All have loved it.
