7980654,5,B0000897E0,One of the most underrated never heard of semi lo-brow semi mob flick and funny AF movie I found this years back in a bargain bin and have enjoyed it time and time again since (it has Michael Bolton from office space in it),1487289600,,223,4.090909090909091

7980657,1,B0000897E0,"When our previous reviewer states that ""all involved have a good time along the way,"" we must assume that she is referring to the cast and crew.  I certainly wouldn't expect the viewers of this ""salad of subplots"" to be too thrilled with how this all gets tossed about.  It isn't so much that it all goes so wrong, as that, rather, it doesn't go anywhere at all.  We start off with a diverse group of ""friends""  --  allowing for enough stock characters to keep several ""back story"" balls in the air at once;  we keep the balls spinning in air for a while;  but then when it comes time to serve up an ending -- any ending -- we are left still wanting.  There are often good reasons why productions such as this go straight to video.  Surely you can find something a bit tastier than this to chew on.",1395619200,,798,4.231788079470198
7980658,4,B0000897E0,"Four men, displeased with the overcrowded, underlit and noisy night club where they gather, decide to pool their funds in order to open a bar and grill, taking with them from their old hangout two favoured employees, bartender Freddie (Kohl Suddeth) and doorman Xavier (Luis Guzmn), but the entrepreneurs soon learn that the success toward which they look forward is elusive. Because their original seed funding - $100,000 - is insufficient, Freddie persuades a family member, mobster Frankie ""Chips"" (Bert Young), to contribute a matching amount, but after a successful opening night, the business suffers a sharp dip in receipts.  The quartet is then forced to yield to a suggestion from Frankie that their type of operation be changed to an adult cabaret featuring topless dancers and, despite the vigourous objections from one of the original partners, played by a rather hammy David Herman, the new operation becomes an immediate hit, although there are expected comedic complications. The actors are well cast for the texture established by first time director Michael Bregman and the film is shot in great part at the Lucerne Hotel and its Wilson's Grill and Bar in New York City's upper West Side, while Kohl, Michael Rooker, and Guzmn give notably strong performances, the latter smoothly handling a voiceover track.  Bregman's background in television is plainly apparent throughout the piece, particularly pertinent to editing.  A highly episodic work, it is smoothly constructed and it is obvious that all involved have a good time along the way, with the salad of subplots blended into a film having about it a feeling of good nature.",1123632000,5,1647,5.1610486891385765
