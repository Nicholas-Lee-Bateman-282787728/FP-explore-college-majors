7900018,5,779912685X,"I love this series, I came across an episode of it by accident, at first I wasn't sure how to take in what I was looking at but a couple minutes into it, I ended up laughing my butt off when the wolf couldn't catch Xiyangyang then his wife ended up shooting lightning out of her eyes and going after him with the frying pan out of frustration because he was clearly capable of coming up with some seriously high tech inventions so she couldn't figure out what kept going wrong with actually bringing home a goat.  Very easy to follow even if you only know the bare basics of Mandarin or no Mandarin at all, yet not so simple that it frustrates the viewers like many cartoons out there these days are prone to doing.",1459123200,,715,4.257352941176471

7900020,4,779912685X,"When we adopted our daughter (5 Years old) from China we wanted something familiar to her to be available.  You cannot help but notice all of the Pleasant Goat merchandise while you are in country so this was a natural fit.

I really think this helped her out a lot and made her feel even more at home.",1374883200,,302,4.189655172413793
7900021,5,779912685X,"This is the Tom and Jerry of China and kids love it. My kids watch this for hours rather than mainstream Disney productions. The animation is very simple and the stories are easy to understand even when one speaks no Mandarin, so kids do not lose interest. Kids also get an idea of the intonation and structure of the Chinese language while watching. I would say this works for kids 3-6 years old, perhaps even older. The movie versions of this series are much slicker and with beautiful animation and would interest older kids.",1362182400,3,528,4.627659574468085
