6808874,3,B00PIVKBLE,This was a bit disappointing to say the least.. I was expecting the upbeat fun dance music for my 2 year old but most the songs are just.... bland!,1425081600,,147,4.103448275862069
6808875,5,B00PIVKBLE,"My nearly 2 yr old son loves the Wiggles and this latest entry is top notch. Emma seems to be featured a bit more than others but I may be biased. It runs for about 80 minutes which is a good amount of time for me to unwind before going back to being a parent. The only problem is I wish the Wiggles would release more content of this caliber faster.

BTW - where's the new series of Ready Steady Wiggle? The reruns on Sprout are getting long in the tooth.",1424908800,,456,4.010989010989011

6808877,5,B00PIVKBLE,"This was the very first Wiggles dvd my son has ever watched, and he loved it! I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting it to be that great, but it was actually very cute and I enjoyed watching it with my son. I'd recommend it and plan on getting him more dvds from The Wiggles.",1423612800,,271,4.037037037037037
6808878,3,B00PIVKBLE,"The Wiggles ""Wiggles House"" is a view of war and devastation

--specifically, of Vietnam`s Tet Offensive--from the perspective of deep space. The film has undeniable power, but it`s an unusual and unsettling power, a product of a collision between red-hot material and the cool serenity with which the Wiggles observe and accepts it. Nothing can be read into the movie but a monumental indifference, an indifference seemingly erected in reaction to the horrors of the world.

With this new film, the Wiggles  pick up where their ``Wiggly Halloween`` left off, seven years ago. As in the earlier movie, obscure formal concerns--with structure, symmetry and point of view--take precedence over dramatic values. There`s no suspense and very few surprises in the story`s unfolding. The characters are perceived distantly and obliquely, in ways that seem deliberately designed to frustrate audience identification.

And yet, this cold, perverse film works in a way the cold, perverse ``Wiggly Halloween`` did not. Applying their abstraction to the already extreme stylizations of the horror genre, the Wiggles in ``Wiggly Halloween`` seemed to be piling sterility upon sterility. It was a film as immaculately empty as the hotel in which it took place.

But ``Wiggle House`` belongs to another genre, one that is, if anything, overloaded with explicit content--the antiwar war movie. It`s a genre dedicated to messages, to heavy ironies and impassioned speeches, and the Wiggles provide all of those. It`s also a genre dedicated to spectacular action and violence, and the Wiggles supplies that, too.

What they don't `t supply is the emotional involvement, the immediate sense of horror, outrage and moral passion, that has traditionally given the genre its impact. In its place is an impassivity so extreme that the filmmaker sometimes appears to have lost all sight of his subject.",1423526400,,1879,5.331081081081081
6808879,5,B00PIVKBLE,"My one and a half year old son LOVES this DVD! We have a few of the Wiggles DVDs and he watches one every night before bed. When I mention this DVD he lights up with happiness!! He finds such comfort in watching it that I could never say no!
I do limit him to once a day because he would watch it all day if I let him.
Definitely purchase this! We also have the take off DVD. Both are great! The kids just love them! :)
Not many shows or movies keep my sons attention for more than 20-30 mins. But he will watch the Wiggles until the very end!

He loves to sing(or babble really) dance and clap along and it's the cutest thing ever. Fair warning: these songs are incredibly catchy. You WILL catch yourself singing them out of the blue...my husband's caught himself belting out a few lyrics at work inadvertently.,1469318400,,390,4.75
6808920,5,B00PIVKBLE,"My children love this show. It has plenty of songs they can get entertained with. After the show gets downloaded, I love that we can take our table and having Amazon Video downloaded and the movie in it, we can have them watch it anywhere we go without having them use our data from our phones.

6808922,5,B00PIVKBLE,"We watched many of the current Wiggles videos on Hulu with our daughter before deciding to buy our first video to take to Grammy and Pap's. I picked this one to start because it features a variety of traditional children's songs and original tunes that feature each of the vocalists in turn. It's a hodgepodge, in a good way, full of silly songs and guest appearances.

The nice thing about the Wiggles is that they have creative control over what they record and release, which means they experiment. Songs like ""Roll the Acrobats"", ""Talking Cow"", and ""Shock the World"" would never make it past focus group testing, but they're goofy and enjoyable to listen to. The mini-play, ""There Was A Princess,"" is exuberantly silly. The take home message is that music is fun, it can be about whatever you like, you can perform it with whomever you like, and a song doesn't have to be a masterpiece to be delightful.

I might not suggest this as a first Wiggles video simply because it does bounce around a lot and there are a lot of special guests. I'd start with ""Furry Tales"", ""Taking Off!"", or ""Apples and Bananas"", especially with younger kids. If you're a fan, though, this is definitely worth a look and will keep your child jumping, dancing, and singing.",1464048000,7,1253,4.665158371040724

Originally we happened upon this DVD as a rental from our local library after another mom friend recommended the Wiggles to my almost toddler son. HE LOVED IT! The Singing! The Dancing! The Bright Colors! He requested is quite often. And honestly, I didn't mind. The singing is good, the songs are cute and the characters are pretty neat. I even find myself singing along.
I don't think you can go wrong with the Wiggles.

Most importantly, they understand what is happening on the screen but are not overwhelmed by it.  I've noticed that a lot of programs for the toddler age range either over-stimulate the kids or bore them half to death... or have weird gender roles in them.

6808944,3,B00PIVKBLE,"There are a few good songs, but many seem out of place and totally random. There is no theme, and the little bits with them talking seem more awkward and hurt the flow and pacing more than usual. It seems like they threw in a bunch of songs that didn't fit in on their other DVDs. The song about rugby is insanely stupid.
