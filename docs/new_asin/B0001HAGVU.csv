2002672,4,B0001HAGVU,"If you're considering purchasing this set, I only ask you to recall the old adage ""you get what you pay for"". First a note about the packaging, each disc is double-sided and in a cardboard slipcase with a brief summary of the plot. There are no extras, though each film has a limited amount of scene selections.

Of course, these films were not at all cleaned up (not picture-wise nor audio-wise) for the transfer to DVD. However, if they were, you would be paying three to four times as much. Keep in mind there *will* be some moments where a few lines of dialogue are inaudible or the picture contorts briefly. Even so, I've watched twelve selections so far and enjoyed them immensely.

Granted, most of the films here could be classified as ""b-movies"". But if you're a fan of the golden age of cinema and have already seen all the classics (Casablanca, Joan of Arc, Citizen Kane, etc) - this set introduces you to some long forgotten hard-to-find gems.",1095465600,100,955,4.6117647058823525
2002673,1,B0001HAGVU,"When buying a product, you expect a little bang for your buck. Unlike its counterpart Family Classics, Action Classics leaves far short of its mark.  Although these movies are old, you expect quality. Unfortunately, the sound is barely audible and the movies grainy. You'd think that because they're on DVD, the quality would be better. The movies shown are low budget (B movies)with unknown actors and limited action. Need I continue ??

INACTION in this case would be best served.

Save your money for better things... Like a hot fudge sundae !!!",1095292800,24,548,4.934782608695652
2002684,2,B0001HAGVU,"Okay, it's 50 movies...some very old, some very foreign, some good and some bad. That's what I expected. However, I did find more reasons to criticize than praise on this collection. Two of the movies would not play. They would start and freeze, sometimes moving a frame or two and freezing again. The one Tarzan's Revenge only played about three minutes and that was it. I tried three different DVD players and could not skip to a different scene or start at the back and use reverse to get into the movie. Also, Manhunt was a Rome release, not a movie with Don Murray. Bloody Friday was also nothing like the description and did not have the listed stars. Cheap is cheap, but come on, how hard is it to list the right movie? Are these things out-sourced to non-English reading or speaking countries? To sum up, there are some worthwhile shows in this collection, but I'm glad I waited until they were on sale. Had I paid full asking price, I would have felt cheated.",1209081600,4,968,4.505681818181818
2002685,3,B0001HAGVU,"The majority of films in the ACTION CLASSICS 50 MOVIE PACK are American made.

2002687,2,B0001HAGVU,"Classics is less applicable here than in most of the other entries in this 50 movie pack series. However, the quality of sound and pictures is adequate,equal to what one expected to see in the early days of television when studios were still withholding their films from the competitive medium. For one interested in the history of film, the Doug Fairbanks (Sr) films are both enjoyable and neceesary viewing, as would be the Brix Tarzan,the Margaret Lockwood/Boris Karloff, British Intelligence,  and a few others.

Probably the Sacco-Vanzetti case does not resonate with younger viewers but for those still moved by it, the film version of Maxwell Anderson's, Winterset, is a nostalgic classic, starring Burgess Meredith and Margo, from the original stage production.

For those with relatively limited funds, I would advise steering clear of this oneand spending your money on some of the other 50 packs which offer more meat and less filler. For those whose budget is not stringent, there are a sufficent number of films worth viewing to justify the expenditure if one can get it at the discounted price available from some of the Amazon associated sellers. I paid $12.59, including shipping charges, which makes me comfortable with the inadequacies of the set.",1167091200,7,1265,5.131067961165049

Despite the fact the product says this is the movie on the DVD, it is in fact not.  There is some goofy C grade movie in its place with no explanation.

I would not recommed this product.",1165881600,12,328,4.344262295081967

2002690,3,B0001HAGVU,"The movie titled ""Manhunt"" in this set is not as described (a 1958 Western with Don Murray, also known as ""From Hell to Texas""). It is instead a one-star 1972 Italian gangster movie with Henry Silva and Woody Strode, originally titled ""La Mala ordina,"" shown full-screen in uncorrected CinemaScope. But at less than 35 cents per movie, does it matter? There are enough gems in this set (e.g., the 1920 silent ""Last of the Mohicans"" with Wallace Beery) to make it well worth buying.",1152921600,27,481,4.738095238095238

  the movies collected here are of the grade b thru z movies and action is the one thing that is in short supply in the set. some are so bad that they are funny but most are just plain bad. and for once i have to say that i found the transfers to be very poor as some of the movies are almost unwatchable. while most of these sets are very much worth the price this set isn't worth even half the price that they are asking for.",1145491200,41,554,3.8421052631578947

2002693,2,B0001HAGVU,"This is not ""50 Action Movies"" as much as it is ""50 Old Mostly Bad Movies We Had Laying Around and Thought We Could Package and Sell Somehow"".

Still, many of these movies are unintentionally funny and make good MST3K fodder.

Some are unbelieveably surreal. Like ""Funeral for an Assassin"""" which is a South African movie in which we are expected to root for the Apartheid govt. I found myself hoping that the assassin would wipe out the entire South African Apatheid govt, but alas.......

Some are just plain awful. Like ""Submarine Alert"".

But there's an Ed Wood classic included...""Jail Bait"". Always good for a laugh.

I'd say the 50 movies are worth the money but just keep in mind that a good half of this set are unforgiveably bad movies and not even enjoyable for the laughs. They should have included ""Gigli"". It would have fit right into this set.",1123113600,19,858,4.655629139072848

This set of fifty actions movies provides another bargain collection. You will probably enjoy at least thirty of these films. Those made before 1930 are usually ""silents"", music and titles explain the events on the screen. This lists the movies by their location on the numbered DVD. You may find the description on the paper sleeve is not entirely accurate. The quality of their video and story varies. They are like the TV movies you may see today. But you may not be able to find a better copy elsewhere. [The movie ""Manhunt"" is quite sleazy in its sex and violence.]

I believe all of the movies are in the public domain and have not been re mastered but the dubs they made are ok. The audio may be scratchy and don't be looking for dolby surround. The video sometimes crackles and jumps but for the price they are well with in the range of viewable.  If you like nostalgia you will love these collections.  I do not think there are any ringers in this collection though some have silents tossed in but not many and in some there may be  a few duplications and in one of the newer compilation releases there is wholesale duplication so do read the provided info. all of them have full identification of exactly what is in the box you might buy. Some even have some general ratings next to the title.
