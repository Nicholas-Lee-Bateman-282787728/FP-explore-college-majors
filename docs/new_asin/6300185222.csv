7804781,4,6300185222,"EArly arrogant johnny depp character, early badass Eric Roberts and that actress from christmas vacation plays the mixed up girlfriend in this one. Plot line is a little boring and dragging at times but if it weren't for the famous stars i wouldnt watch it.",1399075200,,257,4.733333333333333
7804782,3,6300185222,"Bought the vhs out of curiosity of Depp's earlier work, but this was an occasionally racy  typical detective story.  I got a laugh from the decoration on the door of the Depp character's room; maybe he's always been a pirate at heart.  My copy is for sale now that I've seen it, but it was worth watching at the time.",1387152000,,317,4.25

7804784,5,6300185222,"I am a big fan of Johnny Depp and this video was not dissapointing.  It was funny and sexy to watch. If you are a Depp fan i would recommend getting this movie.
It is one that Johnny does not list on his resume however.",1287100800,5,219,3.8666666666666667
7804785,5,6300185222,"This is a movie with lots of plot twists. The acting is really good, especially Beverly D'Angelo as a ""put-upon acting manipulator"" & Johnny Depp in one of his first roles. The father character is very believable. I like the way everything speeds up as we learn all the deaths are being caused by the actions and manueverings of the woman, one by one, until by the end, we see her for what she is -- at the same time that Mr. Ash does. This was a made for TV movie that Netflix doesn't even have. Well worth the money for this film that is only found in VHS format. Maybe someone will see fit to put it on DVD and remarket it for the great film that it is.",1249776000,9,656,4.053846153846154
