2014919,3,B0001MDPRM,"I have 2 sons - 2 years 4 months, and 9 months old. I bought this, and ""Go Potty Go"" for my 2 year old. He (and us, his parents) much prefer ""Go Potty Go."" I reviewed that product and say more about it in that review, giving it 5 stars. I think this one is less successful for us for a few reasons - one, it focuses only on potty chairs, and we use the potty seat on the toilet. That's significant because they provide a ""map"" which gives instructions on what you need to do to use the potty. The map is wordless - pictures only of the steps you must take when you want to use the potty. At least one step on the map is not applicable, then, for my kid - which is to get the parent to dump out the waste from the chair into the toilet. And this is significant because I think the map was my kid's favorite thing. He followed the map along with the movie - without help - the very first time he saw the movie. I think he would use the map all on its own if it were more applicable to his situation. I don't think that my son was so great on the snails, nor on the British accents of the voices in the film, but of course, I cannot tell that for sure because my son didn't tell me this. (But he was singing the songs from ""Go Potty Go"" immediately after seeing that film once.) Some reviews here said that Potty Adventure worked well with older toddlers resistant to potty training - perhaps it's because my son is working on this at a younger age that he is not so into this film. I would more strongly recommend ""Go Potty Go"" if you're getting started with potty training with a two year old.",1205539200,3,1592,3.993730407523511
2014920,4,B0001MDPRM,"My son (2 1/2) has been watching this repeatedly and opens the ""potty steps map"" and follows along when they refer to it during the video.  This video is a great step for beginners because it identifies everything during the potty-training process and offers encouragement and explains that it will take time to learn.  They also go over the steps repeatedly, so at the end when they ask what you do at each step, my son can identify the correct picture at the bottom before they give the answer.  It gives the usual names of ""pee and poop"" but offers other names and suggests that your family may use a different name for them.

The one thing I did not like about the video (the reason for 4 stars and not 5) is that they show diapers at the end!  Even though they are saying ""good-bye diapers"" and ""you're a big kid"" my son pointed to the television and said he wanted a diaper on.  I had to explain to him that we are saying goodbye to the diapers (which eventually disappear) but it was still a bit confusing.  He's a pretty sharp kid, like most 2 1/2 year old kids are so it wasn't a matter of not understanding the concept of saying good-bye to diapers.  Even though I didn't like this part at the end, I would recommend this video to parents who want to introduce potty training to their toddler.",1204502400,,1303,4.333333333333333
2014921,2,B0001MDPRM,"Interesting the first few times, but boring after that. Too slow paced for the average active child. And hard to understand the British accent.",1181001600,,143,5.0
2014922,5,B0001MDPRM,"My two children were given this DVD as a gift from their grandparents.  I just thought it looked like a cute video and didn't really expect much from it.  How wrong I was!  After having put the DVD in the player and getting on with some chores I returned to find my children standing in front of the tv laughing, pointing at the snail characters (they're SOOOOO cute!!) and singing ABC songs!  They are constantly asking for this DVD and I have no hesitation in playing it.  Although I found the animation simple, my children love it.  My older child (who is in kindergarten) already knew her alphabet but that hasn't stop her watching one bit.  Her younger brother has COMPLETELY learned all his letters from this DVD.  He is COMPLETELY captivated with it and carries the DVD box round the house, out on walks, to the mall..  everywhere!  I've been recommending this DVD to other moms.  It's awesome!",1152489600,,901,4.60377358490566
2014923,5,B0001MDPRM,"I hadn't heard of Pocket Snails before and was recommended this video by a mom's club friend. Now I go around recommending it to other friends! This is a GREAT educational product that really works. The letters are presented during the 'Letter Adventure' in groups of 5 or so, and this keeps the video from becoming too repetitive. The letter groups are interspersed with other action such as humorous breaks or letter recaps, which are quite imaginative. For instance, one of the snails refers to a map to remind himself of the letters just visited. All this is done in such a way as to not make the story disjointed or hard to follow, and it all fits together nicely -- especially with the ever-so catchy music that runs throughout. Add in the adorable cartoon snails and you end up with a winning formula that captivates the kids. Our preschooler was hooked from the very first viewing, and now knows her letters inside out! The other moms I've spoken with have had similar success and share my enthusiasm for this video! We originally had the VHS version but ordered the DVD since I was worried the VHS might wear out from being watched so many times! The DVD actually has some extras that reinforce the learning and a few new songs. I whole heartedly recommend this video/DVD.",1085529600,2,1281,4.647577092511013
2014924,5,B0001MDPRM,"My almost 2 year old son loves this video!  He requests it often, and has begun singing along with the snails.  After seeing it only 3 times he picked up the case, pointed at the letter ""c"", and said ""C!""
We have been focusing on his numbers, shapes and colors, and not doing anything with letters, so I was very surprised to hear his correctly label a letter.
Very catchy tune, and cute, simple story.  Even my 6 year old hums along.",1083715200,2,434,4.2682926829268295
2014925,5,B0001MDPRM,"Both my children, aged 4 and 2, took to the pocket snails right away. They're very simple but extremely effective. The music is excellent and runs all the way through, which captivates the little ones. Both my boys now know the ABC's not only in upper case but lower case too. You should see the faces when my 2 year old starts reading letters from labels in the supermarket!",1079913600,,375,4.449275362318841

8014590,5,B0001MDPRM,"This video and the map that diagrams the whole potty sequence for learners is the only thing that worked for my daughter. We tried books, videos, and our own ideas and none of them worked till we got these pocket snails to actually illustrate in cartoon form in a very educational but inoffensive way the sequence of using the potty for both boys and girls. A good training video or book is really hard to find, even Elmo skirts around it without actually explaining much. If its time for your little one to go from diapers to underpants then this is the best we've found, and believe me we've looked.",1431648000,,601,4.472727272727273
8014591,5,B0001MDPRM,"This is what did the trick for potty training my 2 year old.  He loved this video, sang the songs all the time, and in just a few short days, he was trained.  Highly recommend.",1387238400,,176,4.0
8014592,5,B0001MDPRM,"Out of all the potty training dvds that I have bought and I believe I've bought at least ten from Amazon, this is the first one that my two and a half year old asked to be shown again four times in a row. He loved the music! I loved how it showed taking your pants down and pulling them up. This is definitely a five star dvd!",1349827200,,326,3.8088235294117645
8014593,4,B0001MDPRM,"Got this from our local library.  Very nice DVD for kids still perfecting the alphabet.  My 5 year old was very excited to watch, and the 6 enjoyed it as well.  It was a nice change from the LEAP FROG DVD's, which I still enjoy.

The man's voice on the DVD was a nice change from the young high pitched voices of other DVDs.  I wouldn't mind listening to this over and over again.  Which we may be doing)",1318896000,,404,4.050632911392405
8014594,5,B0001MDPRM,This video got the job done.  My son was potty trained within a week from watching it.,1287273600,,86,4.0588235294117645
8014595,4,B0001MDPRM,"I have checked out every potty video our library has (I think about 12 or 13) and this is the best one I have seen so far.  It's British which threw me a little at first, but it was the most straightforward approach I have seen which was refreshing.  It's a little cheesily animated, but its tone is friendly and repetitive without getting boring. So many of the movies we have seen are just loaded with endless songs about being a big kid; potty instruction is either secondary or practically subliminal.  This one gives you the basics and then goes over them in different ways.  And my daughter liked it; she kept asking to watch the snails.",1286668800,2,643,4.47008547008547
8014596,4,B0001MDPRM,"We were borrowing this movie from the library. My 2 year old daughter loved it so much I decided to buy a copy so she would have the map. The steps are simple, easy to follow. The music is catchy but not annoying. I think it is a great tool for getting kids interested in using the potty.",1285027200,2,288,3.9827586206896552
8014597,5,B0001MDPRM,"Very well done video and helpful for those parents and grandparents who want to convey the specific issues in potty training.  The snails are cute, the songs really cute and it clearly has been a hit with my grandchild. She loves to watch it and it truly was helpful in teaching her how to use the potty!",1267488000,,304,4.333333333333333
8014598,1,B0001MDPRM,"This is a stupid video, very low budget.  My daughter got nothing out of of and is just board watching it.  Please do not waste your money",1206662400,,138,4.074074074074074
