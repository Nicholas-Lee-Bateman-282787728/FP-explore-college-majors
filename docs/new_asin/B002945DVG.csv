3876375,4,B002945DVG,"I first saw this film at the US Information Service in NZ in 1973, when the US was providing ""information"" to allies during Vietnam.
I sat engrossed watching a 16mm version. I seem to remember a sequence where Ford discussed briefly his use of music, and this is no longer in the version now available. Apart from that, it is still an absorbing evaluation of the man's work, made more relevant by the contributions of the next generation. A modern retrospective of the influence of Ford could be more appropriately titled ""Stolen from John Ford"", so great is his influence. ""Superman Returns"" reminds me of Ford, particularly the Man Alone, and also the use of doors barring Superman from the world of the family.
Spielberg,as he acknowledges, is a Ford disciple, as anyone watching ""ET"" will quickly see. Tarantino is another.
Ford's influence on other 1950s moviegoers must have been similarly profound, and I recall watching many examples in the local ""fleapit"" as a child. The impact was both direct (cap guns and cowboy games) and indirect (the morality tale)
John Wayne, Henry Fonda, James Stewart et al all come across as likeable guys, grown to full promise under the sometimes harsh light of Ford. Watching this again was like meeting old friends, met first as a child, then again as an adult, and finally as ""elder statesmen""
Finally, I was left with a feeling of nostalgic sadness. I miss the depth, the passion, and the universality of Ford. Johhny, we hardly knew you.",1277424000,4,1481,4.834645669291339
3876376,5,B002945DVG,"...director John Ford's body of work in perspective, providing a context and thread of continuity for his amazing career spanning five decades. John Ford was a difficult and secretive artist who made films which covered the entire American experience and then some. Providing a patriotic vision of America, Ford's work is uplifting and accepting of the history of the country despite its faults.

Bogdanovich provides revealing interviews with Ford intimates, John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Henry Fonda, James Stewart, and Harry Carey Jr. He also, somewhat later in time, collected the thoughts of directors influenced by Ford, such as Martin Scorcese, Steven Spielberg, Clint Eastwood and Walter Hill. Bogdanovich is able to paint a portrait of an artist with a clear vision of what he wants to say and how, as well as a temperamental and maddening man who had many sides to his personality. If you are a Ford fan, or just a movie buff, don't miss this gem. You'll want to see all of Ford's films for yourself.",1274400000,4,1008,4.964497041420119
3876377,5,B002945DVG,"Peter Bogdanovich originally made this documentary over three decades ago.  i copied it and treasured it, hoping that it would be released on video. It wasn't - primarily because Bogdanovich never got clearances for the clips he used. Obviously now that he has, he has taken the old footage and combined the interviews with the now deceased Wayne, Fonda, and Stewart with newly shot ones (including Harry Carey Jr.) and created perhaps the best documentary on an American director ever made, eclipsing Richard Schickel's excellent documentary on Hitchcock, which was part of the outstanding series, ""The Men Who Made the Movies.""",1269993600,4,629,5.227722772277228
3876378,5,B002945DVG,"WOW...
what a great job they have done updating this documentary. Most documentaries from several years back ,  much less 30 feature ""talking heads"" hopelessly faded and poorly lit and in general dating the project. Well...this documentary ..or this version opens with current day interviews with Clint Eastwood and Spielberg and Walter Hill and when it moves to the interviews with Henry Fonda,  James Stewart and John Wayne....there is NO drop off in the image quality in fact the older interviews appear to be on film, lit by a pro cinematographer and are a revelation for the open and frank  discussions  these folks engage  in  with Mr  Bogdonavich. Most  all of the footage from  the films  discussed seems to be  current re-mastered digital  prints so I'd say this is the singular best  example of  updating a classic documentary I've ever enjoyed  and  I love  documentaries.  Mr Bogdonavich knows the territory and is a brilliant director himself...as well as author and actor. This is a couple of hours I will watch over and over and over. ANY film  fan, or  fan of John  Ford (pretty much the same  thing) absolutely MUST own this startlingly wonderful DVD!

PS..the footage of John  Ford himself...I have seen but as the rest its presented for the first time in brilliantly saturated color and clarity...this is my favorite of the John Ford docs and a perfect partner for the more linear and career spanning historical ""Becoming John Ford"" which I also recommend.",1252972800,10,1475,4.902439024390244
3876379,5,B002945DVG,"I last saw this film 30 years ago, and it left such an impression on me, it has been at the top of my ""Why isn't this on video?"" list ever since.  In a way, I'm glad I missed seeing it on TCM--on DVD, the re-edit of the original plus the improved quality of the clips makes it like meeting an old love and finding her more beautiful than ever.

The interview material added since 1971 (particularly Maureen O'Hara's 1992 contribution) really helps to explain why Ford was so hilariously contrarian in his original contact with Bogdonovich.  There is a much fuller sense of John Ford as a person than in the original film.  Spielberg, Eastwood, Scorsese and others help place his work in an artistic context.

But the real thrill of the film is in the clips themselves.  Bogdonovich had just done his first feature, a B-movie starring Boris Karloff, and would go on to make three masterpieces in a row.  DIRECTED BY JOHN FORD, falling in the midst of this progression, is really like a piece of found art, in which he lovingly assembles pieces of Ford's films to make something entirely his own.  The talking head portions are beautifully shot on 35mm, and fit seamlessly into the material of the clips.  Also, to listen to Fonda, Stewart, and Wayne is to appreciate how skilled they all are as raconteurs.

DIRECTED BY JOHN FORD calls attention to the irony that is so easily overlooked in Ford's films, and makes a point of showing Ford to be not so much a chronicler of American History as an archivist of the myths and rituals of American History.

Even for those not fully convinced of Ford's genius, this documentary is a valuable primer on how to understand film art.  It is also a gorgeous example of film art in its own right.",1252886400,32,1734,4.540192926045016
3876380,5,B002945DVG,"Anyone who loves feature films, especially Ford films, should see this documentary.  Although made in the early 70's, it has been updated.  Bogdanovich managed to befriend many of the greats of Hollywood's Golden Era, and thankfully has put on record his conversations and rememberances.  In this film there are many priceless moments; the one that comes to mind first is John Wayne's telling of his first encounter with Ford.  Duke appears very relaxed in his interview, which Bogdanovich conducted on John Wayne's patio overlooking Newport Beach. The film is narrated by Orson Welles, another friend of Bogdanovich, who called Ford ""the old master.""  Great stuff is found within; get it now!",1248048000,24,693,5.207207207207207

8357538,2,B002945DVG,"""Directed by John Ford"", is the tedious account by aficionado actors and a few others, about the ""greatness"" of director John Ford.  After about ten minutes, the obsequious fawning becomes entirely tedious.  The whole time is taken up by an exaggerated flattery or affection.  Not one critique is mentioned, only a few funny anecdotal stories about how John Ford controlled everyone.  Apparently, by the expressed opinion of those involved, he is the sole and only director that invented all film techniques.  Clint Eastwood even has a part where he says, ""John Ford lived in a time before political correctness.""  By that, I think he means that John Ford was allowed carte blanche, to denigrate anyone he wished to, especially the Native Americans in his tepid Westerns.

Then they mention what a great spiritualist John Ford seemed to be, neglecting his rabid anti-Native American portrayal.  His films have so much spiritually, I guess that works if you are Irish or Welsh, but if you are an Apache, then it's to the ""cannon fodder"" with you in his films.  Frankly, I didn't think much of his films, they were bloated, self-indulgent pieces of utter sentimentally.  There's a few here or there that one can sit through without wanting to vomit, but for the most part, they are unapologetic exercises in insipidness.

I would have appreciated a more objective balance added to the rabid sycophantic display put together by Peter Bogdanovich.",1459728000,,1443,5.0210084033613445
8357539,5,B002945DVG,More great film history! A very good documentary on the man.,1410048000,,60,4.545454545454546
8357540,4,B002945DVG,"The background of this documentary is interesting.  Director Peter Bogdanovich put it together some thirty-odd years ago, narrated by Orson Welles, then later did a re-edit, inserting additional interview footage featuring the likes of Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese.

I--and probably thousands of others--am happy he did the update. It's important, because Ford films and what they represent are still relevant, and this updating helps introduce the man and his movies to a younger generation. This possible objective is, I suspect, the reason Bogdanovich dwells repeatedly on some movies at the cost of including others.  The two most obvious remain, today, the most popular and well-known works in the man's canon: The Searchers and How Green Was My Valley, movies that would be at least vaguely familiar to those under 40. They serve as good touchstones, as introduced--in part--by three well-known movie-makers still creating excellent cinema: Eastwood, Scorsese and Walter Hill, still active as producer(Prometheus)and director (TV mini-series, Broken Trail.)

Bogdanovich's interview with Ford is a classic in its own right, and his interview with John Wayne reveals as much about Duke as Ford. Here, Wayne is an articulate man of some charm, wit and insight. Learn, too, how Ford's clever ploys goaded actors to produce some of their best work. Watch, especially, the long single, one-camera take recording the spirited dialogue exchange between veterans Jimmy Stewart and Richard Widmark.  Fabulous.

It helps, too, if you've read something about the man, his methods and madness (yeah, like most creative people, Ford had his demons.)  If you do, you will be intrigued by what this documentary does NOT include.  You won't hear anything about how hard it was to be Ford's production-assistant son, Patrick (not interviewed.)  Two legendary movie stars and Ford favourites--Henry Fonda and Maureen O'Hara--ARE interviewed, but neither reveals Ford's physical violence. He slugged them both in the face at different times; O'Hara's abuse occurred publicly, in front of dozens of film people.  You won't hear a word about that, or, how others risked coming to John Wayne's defence when Ford continually and viciously harassed and belittled him. Wayne's usual retort: ""Awww, Pappy...""

So, as Bogdanovich claims, while Ford may have ""printed the truth NOT the legend,"" through his movies, the same isn't entirely true of this documentary, which is, in the end, a good-natured reminiscence on the legendary film director.",1393286400,,2530,5.428571428571429

8357542,5,B002945DVG,"Bigger than Life

Fifty-six years ago as a high school student, one of my instructors invited me to attend a John Ford get together in Chicago. Ford was giving a talk on his impression of the Old West and movies. I liked the idea of going to Chicago and scoring some points with my teacher, but I had no idea of who John Ford was and it sounded kind of interesting at the time. Well, I learned fast; this man was someone like I have never met before, he was bigger than life.

 Wow! His demeanor and voice projection captured the audience immediately. He had no notes and this was supposedly a give and take with the audience in a hotel parlor setting. Obviously, Ford gave and everyone listened. If anyone made a comment or asked a question - he buried them!

Thanks to him, and after I graduated from college, I jumped in my sports car and I went West and settled inTucson. I wanted to see what he saw and I have never looked back.

8357544,4,B002945DVG,"Directed by John Ford is a very good documentary  that featured the comments and insights from actors like John Wayne and James  Stewart . The film was directed by Peter Bogdonavich in the 1960s. Before Bogdonavich was a director, he was a well respected.film historian. This film is newly edited version of the original ffilm. Bogdonavich has added  some new commentaries from Clint Eastwood and other contemporary actors. Ford himself is on screen but his comments are limited.

This new version was shown on TCM a few years back. I give this version 4 stars because at times the film seems disjointed and uneven. The additional footage is interesting but does not flow with the older interviews.

If you like John Ford, give this documentary a look.",1345075200,,752,4.889763779527559
8357545,5,B002945DVG,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. Before watching this I only remembered John Ford movies as the westerns my dad always watched. After this documentary, I have gone back to re-enjoy many of his films as an adult and a working film maker. He was an amazing artist who inspired directors from Kurosawa to Spielberg. His films are amazingly deep and symbolic, and he had a way of getting the best out of his entire cast and crew. Thanks to this documentary you can see how!",1324684800,,475,4.6
