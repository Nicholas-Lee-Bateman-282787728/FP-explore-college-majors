Now that is one horrible movie when your 7 and 8 year old would rather go to bed then watch a movie. They asked me if I could fast forward after they couldn't get into this slow moving story after 30 full minutes. No kid movie should take that long to become interesting to any children. They were not impressed and I felt bad for them.

First the characters, Ivan's dad is such a jerk to Ivan and everyone else, I hated even listening to the father talk. Ivan isn't really a very likeable kid, he's just odd and not a whole lot else. Ivan gets his miracle, is great at everything and then goes back to normal it wasn't like he learned anything; he just goes back to being nothing but being okay with that. None of the characters learn or grow in the movie. The graphics are bad. I hate the way they make the women look (everyone's boobs are hanging out all over - it's gross and unnecessary). Save your money, save your time and find something else to watch. The movie ened and my kids said ""Mom you're taking this back right?"" ""We don't want this movie.""",1374105600,27,845,4.2875

5721272,1,B00CFB6PI8,"Having read a few reviews I'll agree with one main point: it's not for everyone. I dislike it because it's really really weird. The humor it attempts is very dry, bland and weird. For example, he finds a crazy woman in the forest drinking, he takes off his clothes in front of her and wears some of hers. Then she mixes a strange potion and offers it to him. In American culture, we don't consider that an innocent situation. The plot is very circular, and leaves the main character right where he started being bullied. In movies like this, you usually like the main character and feel for him. I felt bad that his dad abused him, but I didn't really like him.",1454457600,3,661,4.382113821138211

5721276,3,B00CFB6PI8,"I can understand why people find this to be an offensive and upsetting film, but it does have its' merits. It is a Danish film, and as we know, foreign films don't always hang together as well when translated to English, so that is a one possible reason for some of the film's issues.  The story about avoiding trying to be something you are not and accepting yourself as you are is a premise that has been beaten to death in kids movies, but if you can overlook the film's shortcomings here, it actually presents the morals better than some more major release level kids movies. The problem with the film lies in how long it takes to get to the point where Ivan gets his wish, to be incredible at everything. They could have told that part of the story in half the time. With some simple editing, this could have been a much better film. Another thing is that it looks like its at a 4th stage of a 5 stage animation process; it seems unfinished. That's an annoyance at times but it too can be overlooked. Overall, an ok movie that just needs to be polished up a bit more.",1451433600,,1072,4.280788177339901

5721290,3,B00CFB6PI8,"I'm just glad I was not the only one who questioned the animation in the movie....everyone looked weird and gross.  I guess that might have been the point the creators were going for. The ones who were doing the bullying were not perfect either and had their flaws and misgivings.  It was a really sucky movie, I will agree, but Ivan did realize that bullying the bullies was not okay.  In the end, he still got bullied, but he had one friend who quite happily accepted him exactly the way he was, without a single change.  I also liked the scene where Ivan is in class and is asked to read aloud but the letters mix up and run away from him. He can't make sense heads or tails about what it says, but desperately tries to ""catch"" the letters and deciper some meaning out of them.  I immediately recognized him as a child with a learning disability.  This is exactly what many kids with ""invisible"" disabilities (meaning a disability that is not easily identified, unlike a physical disability that is easily seen and recognized as such) experience on a daily basis, especially if they have not been identified as such and receive services in school.  The bullying for being different and not ""quite like the others"" is also very common and familiar to kids with ""invisible"" disabilities.  Sadly, the bullying comes from other kids, teachers and parents as well, who simply do not always understand that there is a real, meaningful and valid reason for the kid's shortcomings that can't be wished away or magically potioned away (think of any ADHD kid who is given medication in the hopes that it will make them ""normal."" No magic potion there either). They are told to just ""try harder"" or ""you can do it if you want to"", pegged as dumb, lazy, stupid, defiant, angry, disobedient, unmotivated, apathetic, etc. The list goes on.  For these kids, they will never be like every one else and thank God for that.  They must learn to adapt and cope by learning new skills and strategies that help them be successful despite the faulty wiring in their brain that they were either born with or acquired at some point in life (think of your traumatic brain injuries, other health impairments, etc). I think this movie was not intended to be a happily ever after nor a movie with a poignant message, unless you can take away the fact that happily ever after is in the eye of the beholder, and that for many, it doesn't get better. I always tell my students (yes I am a special education educator) that we can't control the actions of other people, but we can control our response to them, even our choice to respond.  That is where you will find your power, not in controlling them but in controlling your reaction.",1430956800,2,2706,4.581780538302278

5721296,1,B00CFB6PI8,"Lifeless. Humdrum. Stale.

I have my thesaurus open so that I can list words synonymous with ""boring."" Boring is what I'm trying to get across here. It's really boring.

Uninteresting. Drab. Tiresome.

In all honesty, there's really nothing horrifying about this movie.  It's not like it has a bad overall message or anything like that.  The animation's not even that bad. The voice-actors aren't even that bad. There's nothing to fear, here. It's not the end of the world or anything.

Insipid.

It's just that the story itself is not very well-made.  For the first forty minutes of the movie, nothing really happens. And even during the last forty minutes (when Ivan becomes super-strong) nothing happens then; he just picks up couches for a while. Yeah, that's accurate. For the first half of the movie, the kid gets bullied and for the last half of the movie he picks up heavy things. And it's not funny or anything; you'd think that watching a kid pick up a couch would be funny, but somehow it's not even funny to watch.

And then the movie ends.

Unexciting. Flat. Draining.

The movie is just incredibly slow... and dull. It would have made a decent 5-minute internet short. But as an 80-minute film, it's really... well... boring.

Irksome. Spiritless. Bland.

So I'd recommend against this one. Not that the movie deserves hate, or anything, because it doesn't. It's not even bad enough to be interesting (you know how some movies are so bad that they're kind of fun? This one isn't even like that). It's just boring and there are more interesting movies out there. If you own a deck of cards, you could break those out and play a game or something. Cards are pretty fun.

Dragging. Arid.

I'm just saying that of all the things that are fun, the movie is not one of them.

The main character is a really nice kid, who endures a lot of nonsense from his single father who has great aspirations of becoming a ""coach"", although it is clearly obvious that he has no coaching skills whatsoever.  Even though the boy is small and weak, does poorly in school, and has no apparent talents - the pretty girl likes him!  The preppy jerk who hangs out with her simply does not compare to sweet Ivan who is secretly more playful and talented than most people realize.  With the help of a gypsy ""witch"", Ivan is allowed one wish through which he becomes Ivan the Incredible.  He picks on the bullies who picked on him - disappointing his sweet girlfriend who wants nothing to do with his shennanigans - she liked the old Ivan!  The father capitalizes on his son's new found strength and abilities, taking the credit as if he had coached him to success, which leads to fame and fortune and Ivan's eventual breakdown and desire to return to normal.  It's not all bad as he and his father have a ""break through"" in their relationship, Ivan does return to normal, and he gets the girl back who loved him for who he really was.

There are numerous redeeming values in this movie, interesting characters worthy of discussion with children - like the teacher, the principle, the absentee mother, the butcher (one of my favorites - especially when he demonstrates that he can't be ""bought"") and yes - the bullies!

I wish I had read the reviews before renting it.",1380326400,8,420,4.635135135135135
5721317,1,B00CFB6PI8,"I am typically not motivated to write about movies, kids animation especially because my two (9 and 7) are pretty easily entertained by bright moving pictures and potty humor.  This was a horrible waste of time and I found myself asking the kids three times in the first twenty minutes if they ACTUALLY liked what they were watching. The father is a sad mean man and the ""richys"" are overly written. Everyone in the film just kinda sucked. Nothing redeeming about it, and I'm getting more satisfaction in the hope that I keep at least one other person from subjecting their kids to this level of crap, than from shutting if off before the miracle even happens.
Please don't waste the time or money.",1378512000,15,698,4.629032258064516

8581238,2,B00CFB6PI8,"This was so disappointing.  With the music and the characters, I expected there would be some redeeming value to the story.  Maybe some sort of life lesson for Ivan that he can not only be responsible for his own powers, but he can ask for help to make a difference in his life and that of others.

The only redeeming thing was that his father at least realized his brutality to his son was just a perpetuation of his own lack of confidence and belief, telling the truth about the lies he made up about himself.  But the kids just started up with the bullying again, not learning a thing.  The whole bullying thing just went on for far too long, it just got depressing, and no one was showing the kids a better example.

So what's the moral of the story?  That it's ok to be bullied and not speak up for yourself or someone else??  That you'll just be a bully yourself if you have any abilities?

I would have liked to have seen what the father does to help Ivan once he learned the error of his ways - accepting Ivan's dyslexia and getting help for him to learn to read, how to deal with bullies, how to ask for help when you don't know what to do.",1527724800,,1149,4.16289592760181

But I absolutely had to turn the movie off when I heard Ivan's hateful father tell Ivan he needed to ""eat lots of meat to be strong because women love strong men"".  Are we seriously including dialogue like that in children's animation movies in this day and age?  The whole movie is full of hatefulness and misogynistic undertones.
