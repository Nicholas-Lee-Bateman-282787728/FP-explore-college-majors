8170998,1,B000MR99NK,"Perhaps, when this was originally made, the techniques shown on the dvd were considered standard molding and casting, however I took absolutely nothing from this video, as today's molding and casting techniques are VERY far beyond what they show in the program. My hope was to learn at least one or two tricks or tips that I hadn't known and sadly, I learned nothing, except not to purchase another Mark Alfrey Dvd.

Even if I were just starting out as a mold maker, this dvd shows methods that not only waste time, but also money and product used. I honestly feel as though this dvd should be taken off of shelves and remade with more modern materials and techniques. To say I was disappointed, is an understatement. For $25, I wish I had simply rented it from Smartflix for $9, rather than purchasing it as I feel it was a total waste of money.

There should possibly be a disclaimer on the products description stating the the material covered is outdated, obsolete and is for nostalgic purposes only.

I've seen better videos, that are far more informative, with newer products, even for beginners, for free on youtube. I have been molding and castings for many years now and, as I said, was just hoping this Dvd might have even just one little tip that I didn't know, but that didn't happen. I wouldn't even recommend this to a novice. I'd send them to YouTube first...

Sorry for the rant, but I just need you to know.",1398988800,4,1424,4.55078125
8170999,5,B000MR99NK,"This is a great DVD for a new person as myself. I never knew the process and it lays it out perfect so that anyone can do it. I am not at this level yet but
I will keep this DVD and watch it often when I do. TY",1367798400,,210,3.306122448979592
8171000,5,B000MR99NK,I bought this for my husband who is a an artist in many mediums... This is an excellent DVD for learning the molds and castings for sculpture. My husband was very pleased with it as was I. I recommend this DVD to the serious artist/sculptor. Thank you Mark Alfrey and AMAZON.,1318032000,,275,4.411764705882353
8171001,4,B000MR99NK,"Like most art education DVDs, ""Mark Alfrey's Standard Molds And Casting"" has a title that exaggerates its scope.  Mold maker Pedro Valdez creates a pair of two-piece molds that are roughly the same size and uses them for ""slush"" casting.  One is a plaster mold of a life sized head that is used to cast a latex rubber mask of the entire head.  The other is a two piece silicone rubber mold enclosed by a plaster ""case mold"".  This is used to cast a portrait bust of the head of a fantasy creature about 3/4 the size of a human head.  The cast is a resin shell whose interior is filled with plaster.  If those projects fit your definition of ""Standard"" then this is the DVD for you.  If you think ""Standard"" includes topics like making alginate molds, making molds for small military figures, making solid casts instead of ""slush"" casts, casting foams or casting metals then don't expect to be informed.

Making the molds involves building temporary clay structures that surround the original object.  Pieces of the mold are built up over these structures with plaster and strips of burlap.  It will please hobbyists that this work is accomplished with simple hand tools and a hot melt glue gun.  It may not please them to see the impressive volumes of clay and plaster required for mold making.  The volume of clay used during the process of making a mold for a head exceeds the volume of clay used to sculpt the head.  The plaster (Ultracal 30) is not a type commonly available in hardware stores.

The DVD is narrated by Shannon Prescott, who speaks clearly.  She narrates smoothly,  speaking from a script.  There is background music.  Some of it is lively.  We get to hear ""Little Bitty Pretty One"".  You can't hear the sounds of the work; the narration was apparently done in a sound studio.

This DVD has excellent coverage of building the temporary clay structures and applying the plaster.  It has good camera angles and many close ups.  You may read in books that you should ""smooth the surface"" or ""press the clay tightly against the master"", but if you watch the DVD then you will be able to see exactly what  degree of smoothness  and tightness required.  ( I think the average person cannot  hope to work as quickly as Pedro Valdez.  He confidently and rapidly uses tools like scrapers in situations where a careless slip might damage the mold. )

The DVD has several weak points.

Materials are mentioned in the narration, but not explained in detail.  In most cases there is no text to show you how their names are spelled.  A person already familiar with products used by sculptors will have no problem.  A novice will have to do research.  (At least the packages of some of the products are shown on the video.)

Some examples of this problem are:

1. Is the head of the fantasy creature made of water based clay or waxed based clay?  Shannon only says that it is ""roma"".  A person familiar with modeling clays will know this means the brand name ""Roma Plastilina"" , which is a series of wax based clays.

2. The clay used to build the temporary structures is described as ""white clay"" from ""Laguna Clay Company"".  Is it water based or wax based?  You can look up the website of Laguna Clay company. It appears they sell only water based clays.  They sell several whitish colored clays.  Does it matter which one is used?  Is it important that the clay is white?  Those questions aren't answered.

3. For the plaster mold, Shannon says the separation agent is Krylon Crystal Clear followed by a coat of ""dulling spray"".  Web research shows that Krylon actually makes a product called ""Dulling Spray"".

4. Shannon says that if a clay sculpture is over three years old or made with clay containing sulfur then Krylon Crystal Clear should not be used as a separating agent.  Instead, one should use ""gel medium"".  She doesn't explain what ""gel medium"" is.  Is it the ""acrylic gel medium"" used by painters?

5. The latex mask is cast with ""liquid latex"".  The viewer needs to know that there are several types of liquid latex.  Some types are for making molds; other types are for making casts.

6. Talc is used to keep  the silicone mold from sticking to itself.  The viewer must know that ""talc"" and ""talcum power"" are no longer synonymous with ""baby power"".  Most baby powers are now made of corn starch.

The DVD does not deal with the recycling of clay.  This will be an important issue for hobbyists.  Clay used in mold making will become contaminated with separation agents, bits of plaster, and ordinary dust and dirt.  Is there a simple way to reprocess and recycle it?  Or must you buy new clay every time?  There is no information on this.

The DVD does not explain how to repair small defects in molds or casts.  Surely even Pedro Valdez gets a few minor imperfections when casting sculptures that have fine detail.

The focus of the DVD is on the ""how"" of making molds, not the ""why"".  Shannon does not explain that the surface of the plaster mold for the latex mask must be kept porous since the casting process depends on the plaster absorbing water from the latex.  At one point she says to put Vaseline on on the lip of the plaster mold half that has already hardened.  A person who does not understand how the casting process operates might be tempted to smear Vaseline on the sculpture too ""for good measure"".  That would contaminate the surface of the other half of the mold.  (Shannon uses the word ""stone"" to mean the hardened plaster of the mold.  At the point in the video when she says to put Vaseline ""on the stone"", she means the lip of the plaster mold half.  )

The best trick on the video is when Pedro Valdez pours the silicone rubber.  He puts the mold on the floor.  While standing, he holds the container of silicone near the level of his head and pours the silicone so it drips down into the mold in a long thin strand.  This helps eliminate bubbles.  (He doesn't use vacuum chambers, vibration equipment or other de-bubbling methods.  Many small holes are drilled into the case mold. and the funnel he pours into acts as a reservoir.  When he sees silicone seeping out of a hole, he knows the air had been released and he plugs the hole with a wood screw. )

I rate this DVD as four out of five stars to indicate it is an above average explanation of how to make two types of molds and casts.  The structure of molds is clearly explained.  Figuring out other aspects is up to the viewer.",1276128000,9,6436,4.529155787641427
8171002,5,B000MR99NK,"This is a great DVD for all those who want to know how to do molds from their sculptures and cast copies of them. Molds are done by Valdez who has done molds for a great number of films.

DVD is divided in four parts:

1: Making a direct mold from the figure.
2: Making a silicon filled mold.
3: Casting a figure from the silicon mold.
4: Casting a latex mask from the first mold.

Excellent.",1255219200,,392,4.064935064935065
