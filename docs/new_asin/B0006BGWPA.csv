2181829,3,B0006BGWPA,"I really don't think pauly's that bad a guy, he can be funny at moments, and this film definitly had a few laugh out loud moments. one of the major criticisms i have for this movie is it's poor production value, but it was created on a shoestring budget, and i give him credit for doing it. the next thing is some of the actors in this movie were really horrible, i mean vomit inducing, fred durst for example. the concept of the movie is pretty cool, and pauly's pretty good in it, but a director he is not, a good director would not have let alot of the flubbed dialoge into the final cut. Although i think if a major studio decideds to remake this movie with pauly it would be a major hit.",1112313600,2,692,4.133333333333334
2181830,5,B0006BGWPA,"This movie is very difficult to understand, as it contains many different deep aspects. Basically it is about this guy Pauly Shore, who many people used to think was funny, and about his personal struggle to feel loved, wanted, and redeemed. With basically no budget, Pauly set out with a hi-def digital camera and made a movie that had a funny idea about faking his own death. But really, the faking of his death is just an entertaining medium for some more serious and deep questions. Pauly shore has one scene where he is praying to God in the form of a famous comedian; and while people may think its funny because pauly is crying and kneeling down, he is quite serious and quite convincing as a dramatic actor. Pauly goes further by acknowleging that he really is somewhat of a wiesel, and that part of him will never go away. In the begining we get to see Pauly rubbing one out..... He could have left that out but hey! Its reality man. I loved how pauly showed his change in prison, and the idea of another inmate teaching him to act using classic standards such as shakespere. Of course, he probably did not change in this manner, but it is a brillant way of presenting his desire to act in a low-budget manner. Basically I love this movie and i feel anyone who wants to laugh at pauly should just go and try and make a touching movie with no-budget. I have felt just like pauly, when your all alone in the world when you used to be on top and you can't understand what you did wrong. Whenever i feel like that i feel very redeemed when i watch this movie. I used to idealize pauly shore when i was like 10, and watching how someone you used to look up to could be so sad just ten years later was a real mind-bender. Just give this movie a chance and keep this in mind.",1110067200,7,1777,4.275964391691395
2181831,4,B0006BGWPA,"Pauly Shore really knew what he was doing this time around, and worked pretty damned hard making his real self out to be a baffoon. His self-deprecating flick took five years to finally assemble and getting permission from all those other artists couldn't have been easy.  But it shows that Pauly put some effort into this thing and that's why I enjoyed it, plus some of the jokes and one-liners from other famous people were hysterical.  Some of the direction needed to be cleaned up a little but so what.  Pauly wasn't trying to be Kubrick or Speilberg.  When I found this movie on Amazon I said ""I've got to have it"" and usually I'll watch a DVD once or twice then sell it on e-bay for half what I bought it for.  This DVD is staying in my collection to be viewed several more times still.  I take half a star away for the ""director's commentary"" because Pauly seemed to be pretty baked and directionless when he spoke over the film and didn't add a whole lot other than constant thank-yous to the respected artists he had to go around and take 15 minutes away from to film a short piece.  The work by Carrot-Top and Charlie Sheen in the beginning of the movie by itself garnered three stars, the flick got its other 1 and a half for consistently being funny even after the first several gags.",1108771200,2,1296,4.397489539748954
2181832,1,B0006BGWPA,"Pauly Shore is a singularly untalented man.  Should I feel sympathy for him because of that, or should I loathe and detest the mere fact that he has been able to get movies made?  Of the two choices, I'm going with the latter.

This movie is a lame attempt by Shore to reinvent himself as a misunderstood genius, but to do it by poking fun at the mere fact that he could ever consider himself to be a misunderstood genius.  Wow, how very ironic and clever.  It's not a terrible idea.  Charlie Kaufman might have been able to make something genius of it.  However, in the hands of Pauly Shore, you get garbage.  The wittiest thing tht happens is that people confuse Tom Sizemore for Michael Madsen, and vice versa.  If that's you're idea of hilarity, then you deserve this movie.

Seriously, this is a TERRIBLE movie.  I wish Pauly Shore no ill will, but the money spent on this movie is gone forever.  Please, don't reward the fools who spent it.",1108598400,6,946,4.436046511627907

Pauly Shore is Alive and Well!

And not because I think P.M.S. is such a talented actor/comedian because, quite frankly, I think he sux. I'm not saying that to be mean or rude; I'm just not impressed with him -- at all! I question his talent as a stand-up comedian and as an actor.

But as a commentator / pseudo-documentarian, however....

Here, clearly, is Pauly Shore's absolute finest hour (at least until he pulls something else out of the hat at a later date). His faux ""semi-autobiographical"" film ""PAULY SHORE IS DEAD"" (aka ""YOU'LL NEVER WIEZ IN THIS TOWN AGAIN"") is such an indictment against the ""Hollywood System"" it ain't even funny -- even though Pauly presents it in a funny way.

He shows just how typical, hypocritical, backbiting and fickle the masters of the entertainment system and the arse-kissing entertainment media truly are -- how they can, at a whim, make or break a person's career in the industry, which, as Pauly shows, is committed mostly through typecasting and stereotyping.

Pauly's independently financed movie (of course! -- you think the H-Town execs would want to be compliant in their own asswhippin'?) shows the entertainment world's ""two faces."" Though he focuses on the ""movie"" & ""music"" industry, his expose could just as easily apply to professional sports. He uses the ""celebrity wing"" of a prison to show just how the pressures & politics of the industry can lead to your downfall. He lays out before us how easily we can be manipulated into following on the bogus coattails of the entertainment industry's propaganda arm (for instance, in the film Pauly becomes beloved as a 'comic genius' who dies before his time, while all we ever saw of his 'genius' was rather shallow & limited, and he matches this up with ""casting"" the late Sam Kinneson as his 'guardian angel' -- an entertainer who truly did die and who really was hailed as a 'comic genius who died before his time,' even though the entire scope of Kinneson's ""comedic genius"" was that he was just some fat guy who screamed a lot).

In his movie, Pauly is basically telling his audience that he learned too late what many others-- like Tom Hanks, Michael Keaton, Jamie Foxx, Robin Williams --either learned before him or began figuring out soon enough: that to be 'pigeonholed' is to be condemned to a slow rotting death, as it were. But, in relation to this, he also showed that ""Hollywood"" is not always so willing for their ""product"" (as they think of the people they sign on) to change its formula (which is no wonder why we get inexhaustible remakes, rehashes and sequels coming from 'Tinseltown').

I believe Pauly has real talent deep down somewhere, and could definitely express it if only given a chance to break out of the mold of the ""Weasel"" (which was not always meant as a term of endearment). He has clearly shown some of that talent with this movie as a writer and director -- perhaps this is his ""true"" calling, I don't know, but it gives me hope that he, like those mentioned above, and others like Sam Raimi, can ascend to greater & more respectable heights.",1107475200,23,3085,4.721189591078067
2181835,5,B0006BGWPA,"This is a great Pauly Shore is awesome! He couldn't have done a better job with this movie. It took him 5 years to make it, so he deffinatly put some time into it. This is a great movie for all Pauly Shore fans, even for non-Pauly Shore fans. This movie is a true eye-opener. It shows the reactions of people after somebody dies. Either they're happy, or they're sad. It's more of an anti-suicide film than anything else. It teaches you really how people will react to your death.

2181838,2,B0006BGWPA,"I know that there are many of us who have been waiting many years for a new Pauly Shore movie to be released, well, now is the time.  Now that I have the sarcasm out of my system, I can continue with my review.  Many of you may be asking yourselves, I wonder if Pauly Shore is still as annoying as he used to be?  Well, the answer to that is a resounding yes.  A movie written and directed by Pauly Shore with himself as the star, what more could you ask for out of a movie?  The man has not matured a bit and is still clinging desperately to his A.D.D inspired antics, hoping that someone will laugh at him.  Shore also decides to throw a few stereotypes into the mix, making me have even less respect for him than I already did.

Ok, so initially I got the wrong impression of this movie, which lead me to have high expectations.  I thought that this was just going to be a lot of celebrities making cameos and talking about how bad of an actor Pauly was.  Personally, I think that that would have made for an excellent movie.  Seeing as how that was not the case, I was absurdly disappointed with this film.  The only reason I could stand to give it 2 stars were for the scenes where there WERE celebrities making fun of Pauly Shore.  For all four of you Pauly Shore fans out there, go ahead and purchase this movie, but for everyone else, STAY AWAY!  The movie hopes to capture something of an audience with its plethora of celebrity appearances but the fact is, Pauly Shore is indeed dead.",1106352000,4,1494,4.21830985915493

Contributing celebs include Charlie Sheen, Sean Penn, Bill Maher, Pamela Anderson, Ellen DeGeneres, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dog, Nicky and Paris Hilton, Clint Howard, Chris Rock, Ja Rule, Michael Madsen, Tom Sizemore, Jerry Springer, Britney Spears, Whoopi Goldberg, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller and the voice of Adam Sandler.

Another has-been, Todd Bridges, has a significant supporting role. He and Pauly share a prison cell. Bridges gives acting advice and shares his religious beliefs.

The most unique celebrity here is back from the dead. Shore combines archive footage of Sam Kinison's silhouette with an excellent voice imitation. Sam materializes in an eerie mist to offer a despondent Pauly some advice. He explains that guys like himself and John Belushi are more famous now because they're dead. Sam's ghost poses the question: would you rather be a dead legend or a live loser?

Pauly, who's lost his house and is reduced to parking cars at his mom's club, THE COMEDY STORE, chooses being a dead legend, but he doesn't kill himself. Instead, he simulates a suicide with a corpse stolen from the morgue. This ruse actually works. Pauly's sudden demise becomes big news. He's the topic of TV talk shows and the cover boy on many magazines.

But everything falls apart when it's discovered that Shore isn't dead, He's arrested, tried and imprisoned, and it's while behind bars that the resurrection of Pauly Shore truly begins.

2181851,3,B0006BGWPA,"For those who care about Pauly Shore flicks, there are SPOILERS here:

It begins with Charlie Sheen consoling Paulie Shore over Paulie's down-spiraled career. The next day finds the maid encountering Paulie's corpse, apparently a death by suicide. Then, through roughly a half hour of flashbacks, Paulie's voice-over narrates the sequential rise and demise of his television and film career, from being a top MTV personality and starring in fan-favorites Encino Man and Son-in-Law to, sadly, having to fire his staff and crew (who promptly celebrate), having to vacate his nice crib, and being berated by incoming new crib owner Carrottop: ""It still smells like Pauly in here!"" One night, Pauly is visited by Sam Kinison's ghost who advises him to fake his death because people are more appreciated when they die. The flashbacks are capped with Paulie staging his own demise. Then, cut to the present, as the film unveils the repercussions of the Weasel's passing: Pauly Shore is now hailed as a comic genius, he is on every magazine cover, his fans are holding vigils, MTV has a 48 hour salute to Pauly, there is a ""girls who slept with Pauly"" segment on Jerry Springer, Dr. Dre is reminiscing of when he used to blaze with him...ahh, good times for the postmortem great man. Then, his current un-dead status is nosed out by a precocious little girl and, soon, the police are busting down the door of his hideaway and clapping cuffs on his protesting person. He is incarcerated in the prison's celebrity wing and, bolstered with the support and hard-earned wisdom of the cons, including his Koran-reading cellmate Todd Bridges, becomes a wiser, better man. He is soon released and now can be seen filming with co-star Sean Penn. Run end credits.

Pauly Shore's farcical mockumentary, while scathingly funny, also doubles as an incisive look into the underbelly of Tinseltown. The backbiting, the double-dealing, the jealousies, the paranoia, the constant need to be on top and in the public consciousness...these Hollywood demons are all present and are given proper satirical consideration. Pauly dragoons his Hollywood bud-dies (some of 'em A-listers) into making hilarious spoofy cameos, and some are very funny indeed with their commentary about the dearly departed Mr. Shore, particularly the two very catty phone pals Ben Stiller and Bill Maher.

There are so many funny bits strewn throughout this film: Britney Spears, on wondering who Pauly Shore is, declares, ""Oh, yeah, he's that guy that used to be on MTV before I was born.""; Tom Sizemore hits on a honey, who accuses him of being ""that creepy guy from the movies!"" Tom's instant response: ""No, that's Michael Madsen."" The viewer also becomes privy to Pauly's encounter with Fred Durtz (Limp Bizkit) before the band became famous and we also learn what befell Rico Suave.

I've never been a fan of Pauly Shore and I never did get his weird humor. The only film of his I really enjoyed was Son-in-Law. The rest of his pictures alternately sucks and blows. But, for one semi-shiny moment, Pauly has found his ideal niche - mockumentaries!! It's a bit sad that his best cinematic effort had to involve his true-to-life Tinseltown career inadequacies.

He had hit movies, Son-In-Law, Encino Man, In The Army Now, Bio-Dome and Jury Duty. He had a failed Fox TV show and no one liked him anymore. He keeps bugging fellow actors to ask the director for a spot in their movie. Anyway, Shore gets a visit from the ""Ghost of Sam Kinison"" and Kinison tells him you'll be famous if you're dead. So, Pauly Shore fakes his own death and everyone mourns him, even his # 1 fan Bucky (W. Earl Brown) but soon everyone finds out that he faked his death, so he goes to Celebrity Prison, everyone hates him.

This film has a moronic plot, contrived dialog, horrific production values (the voice over during the establishing scenes is horribly recorded, and there are several times during the film where the overdubbed dialog doesn't even come close to matching what's happening on the screen), and ham handed direction.  Throw in bad acting and the Hilton sisters, and you essentially get a porno film without the sex... and that's just plain frustrating for everyone involved.

Besides, I NEVER needed to see Pauly Shore waxing his dolphin, in reality or simulation.  It seemed to me that the 'wiez' was hoping that people would find his somewhat fictionalized life to be either funny or touching, but I only found it to be moronic and insulting.
