8362592,4,B002BZTP0S,"This is a story of 2-siblings, Sohail and Nasima Wahid.  Second generation, British born/Pakistani/Muslims.
Both are students, Sohail studying law in and Nasima studying medicine in Leeds. With new government anti-terrorism legislation being used against Muslims in the UK in the wake of the September 11 attacks in New York, Sohail and Nasima are drawn in radically different directions. Without telling any of his family or friends, Sohail becomes a member of MI5.  He subsequently learns that a number of his neighbors and childhood friends are politically militant. While attending medical school, Nasima is dates an African blooded man. Her family freaks and they send her back to Pakistan for a forced arranged marriage. The boyfriend follows her, he is beaten severely and imprisoned by Nasima's Pakistani male cousins and is only saved by Sohail's intervention.

This is a 2-part mini-series with part 1 of the story told from Sohail's point of view and part-2 Nasima's.
I don't want to give up any more of the story and/or the dramatic conclusion.  However, what is truly thought provoking is how seemingly well acclimated 2nd generation citizen can be transformed into a terrorist.  Is it the increase in profiling done by the government?  Is it the family holding on to traditions that simply don't translate?

Entertaining and thought provoking.",1335916800,,1357,5.225806451612903
