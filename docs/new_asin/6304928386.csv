8215622,5,6304928386,"I will watch anything with Joe Lando in it. If you want to get down to basics, just watch minutes 41 to 45 and that's all you'll need. You're welcome.",1516579200,,150,4.033333333333333
8215623,1,6304928386,"Cookie-cutter all the way.  I was hoping for a unique spin & it never happened.  If you can get by the onslaught of obvious questions like where is the guy's attorney through all of this?  Why was he at hope after serving 4 years for a crime he didn't commit instead of going out getting hammered and why would a woman who suspects him of committing more murders spend so much 'alone time with him'?. If you can ignore all of the stupidity, monotonous story-line & horrible acting (except for Peter C., of course) you might find something or substance here- I sure couldn't.",1509840000,,574,4.5
8215624,3,6304928386,"did anyone else notice, at about 5:19, that the sign on the door to the police department read 'homocide?'",1509235200,,106,4.631578947368421
8215625,1,6304928386,"I should have known better..not even up to made for t.v. quality.  I can be a sucker for crime shows though and stories of wrongful conviction.  I have to say that the acting and everything else about this movie was so bad that after a few minutes I thought to myself, ""wait a second, I didn't realize that this was going to be a really big dumb comedy!""  Sadly, I don't think that was the intention..",1508544000,,401,4.25
8215626,1,6304928386,A teen-scream for the middle-aged crowd.,1507075200,,40,5.833333333333333
8215627,4,6304928386,"The movie has a few cheesy moments, but it's pretty good over all. The cast is amazing. Alberta Watson and Joe Lando work very well together, making a wonderful duo as partners and lovers. The movie also has its fair share of twists and turns that will make you go, Ohhh. Peter Coyote gives a wonderful performance as well. Over all, I'd recommend this film.",1201996800,4,358,4.523076923076923
