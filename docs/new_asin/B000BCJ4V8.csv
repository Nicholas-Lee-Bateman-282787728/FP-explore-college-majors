2413886,4,B000BCJ4V8,"Probably not for someone wanting to learn the total basics of massage but for a person with some knowledge of the art then this will be a useful learning tool towards offering a relaxing massage. The tape was well paced and flows well.  I am a registered therapist in England  (  ITEC ) and found some new techniques that I will use in my routines .
The beautiful Santa Barbara location where this video was filmed and the excellent musculature of the client may bare little resemblence to the average clinic and client that most therapists experience , especially in a cold , wet England, yet it didn't detract from the excellent script delivered in an authorative , non patronising way by Donna .
Donna doesn't forget the therapist and includes useful tips for preventing injury and strain to the masseur.
The NTSC format of this tape works fine on dual format VCR's in the UK ( most modern machines have this facility ) but remember that HM customs will sting you for an extra few 's for VAT on delivery.",1056931200,,1007,4.552486187845304

8085167,5,B000BCJ4V8,"I first saw this video at McCann School for Business and Technology where I am taking classes in order to become a professional massage therapist. We have watched quite a few, but this one really hit home for me, explaining in detail where and how you massage ""each"" part of the body, not just telling you or implying, but having you be able to see it made a lot of the techniques easier to understand.

I would recommend this dvd for anyone interested in therapudic massage, or any other modality, just very helpful in so many aspects, a great buy.",1272585600,,549,4.49
8085168,5,B000BCJ4V8,anyone wanting to learn about massage will enjoy. It explan how it is helping your body as well. Good for anyone going to be a massage student,1234828800,,142,4.296296296296297
8085169,1,B000BCJ4V8,"I thought that the three sequences in the DVD would be instructing the viewer on how each session progresses but instead this DVD was more about showing different techniques and not a breakdown of how each session progresses.

If I wanted to buy a product that only showed techniques then I would have purchased one of the many books out there with pictures of the various strokes/techniques.

I wish this DVD would have taken the route of the Chair Massage DVD which showed the techniques and later how a session progresses step by step.

I was very disappointed with this purchase.",1234396800,2,583,4.752475247524752
