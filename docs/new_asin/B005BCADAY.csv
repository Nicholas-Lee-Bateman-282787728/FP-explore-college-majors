4643630,5,B005BCADAY,"I have been following Neil Peart since the first time I saw RUSH in concert in 1975 and since then I have always enjoyed his style of playing. I own EVERY DVD ( RUSH and SOLO ) and I was shocked to see him play on the LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN because he NEVER does anything like that on TV. This new DVD will showcase his talents to a YOUNGER GENERATION ( my girlfriends daughter is 15 and saw the LETTERMAN show and said "" wow, that guy really knows how to play "" ) I also love how he includes JAZZ ( buddy rich ) in his drum solos. I can ONLY WISH that someday he will record a JAZZ FUSION CD ( billy cobham, Return to forever ) and the circle will be complete. For now, I can't wait till this DVD is released. NEIL PEART , THE MASTER OF DRUMS :)",1316217600,9,754,3.870967741935484
4643631,5,B005BCADAY,"To get a chance to see a breakdown of Neil Peart's work is an awesome opportunity no new or old drummer should miss out on. Five Stars!

Oh what I would give to be a student of Neil Peart's, but because he is such a great, I would assume the price of such lessons would run very high, and rightfully so. Like he even has the time to do such a thing anyhow. Next best thing is his DVD's explaining the method to the madness which is his fantastic drumming technique, and style. He is a master, but admits himself there is never a point we stop learning his/our craft. He knows there is always something to be gained by watching, learning, and practicing what someone else can/has shown us.

I'll be counting down the days for this to arrive!",1316131200,8,740,4.2785714285714285

4643635,5,B005BCADAY,"If you're interested in learning about these songs and what went into the drum compositions, the interviews are great.  Also, to be able to watch the live performances in just the drum view and with the mix set so that the drums are in the foreground is awesome.  Whether you enjoy just watching Neil play and talk drums or you're trying to learn to play some of these songs, this is an awesome video.",1462406400,,401,4.405405405405405
4643636,5,B005BCADAY,My husband was thrilled when I gave this to him for his birthdat,1460160000,,64,4.0
4643637,5,B005BCADAY,"This is a drumming Rush fan's dream. For less than $30 you get about 8 hours of personal time with Neil Peart. The main reason for drummer fans to buy this is that Neil explains and demonstrates the drum parts on all the songs from the Time Machine Tour. For each song, you get Neil discussing, then  demonstrating (at tempo), then the part played in slow motion, then you get the full concert version with cameras on Neil only so you can watch him play the entire song. 33 songs are covered, including the entire Moving Pictures album. Everything is well filmed, including a separate camera on Neil's bass drum foot. Think about it, a drummer buying this DVD would be paying about $1 per song for private drum lessons with Neil! What an incredible bargain this is!

Neil is a deep thinker who looks at things from every angle possible. As such, his answers are very thorough and at times it feels as though he's talking too much and it can get boring if you don't relate to what he's discussing - but you can always skip ahead, so it's better to have it than not have it. Besides covering the songs, Neil discusses everything from getting ready to tour, choosing a set list, composing a new solo, set up, sound check, warm up, etc.

This would make a great gift for any young drummer fan of Rush.",1458864000,,1297,4.418410041841004

4643639,5,B005BCADAY,Finally you get the sound what Neil's drum sound like in a proper mix. Yes I understand it's too much but it clearly shows how poorly Time Machine was mixed as they really muffled neils drums to a point of no return.,1449273600,,216,4.166666666666667
4643640,5,B005BCADAY,Amazing.,1444435200,,8,8.0
4643641,5,B005BCADAY,Purchase this if you want to see Niel breakdown and explain how he crafts percussion sequences for his songs.  Excellent.,1442016000,,121,5.05
4643642,5,B005BCADAY,"Neil Peart,  probably the best drummer of all time, incredible dvd,  you see Neil performing the songs of a Rush show,  but with the camera 100% of the time on Neil Peart only,  if you are a fan of drums like me,  you will love this dvd. You really can appreciate all his talent!",1432166400,,279,4.092592592592593

4643647,5,B005BCADAY,"This really a great DVD set for any serious Neil Peart fan. The interviews are very insightful and interesting. Neil breaks down the main drum parts of many of Rush's well known songs and that alone is worth the price of admission. However, you also get a behind the scenes look at Neil during sound check with the band, as well as his practice and warm up routine before a show. I'm a drummer and have been a huge Neil Peart fan for decades. I highly recommend this DVD not only to other drummers, but I think non drummers will also find the nearly 8 hours of material very entertaining!",1424390400,,588,4.3545454545454545
4643648,5,B005BCADAY,What can you say? He is the greatest percussionist. A perfectionist at his trade.,1424390400,,81,4.857142857142857
4643649,5,B005BCADAY,"Big Neil Peart fan since 1974.  I have always just wanted to sit down and listen to what he has to say.  He is so talented.  My 7 year old grandson enjoyed it as well, especially the fast riffs put in slow motion.  Wow!  We listened/watched while we put out my Christmas decorations.  May become a new tradition!",1420934400,,312,4.293103448275862

4643655,5,B005BCADAY,"Got this for my husband for Christmas and it was a big hit. We both love RUSH. Neil Peart is a very fascinating and deep person. His writing is the fuel behind RUSH. This dvd does not disappoint!!! We've watched it many times. And if you have a budding songwriter or band member in your family, I'd recommend this. Probably has some language in it, but lots of pearls of wisdom around and among great performances.",1406332800,,414,4.4605263157894735

4643658,5,B005BCADAY,Neil is surely a master at his craft.  He doesnt just beat the skins he is a composer and very methodical in his writing and composition of his percussion.  Every beat and every strike of the drums is well thought out and not just some maniac with arms flying all over the place.  I could watch him for hours and listening to him explain his craft is also something that is captivating and awe inspiring.,1399680000,,404,4.36
4643659,5,B005BCADAY,Just what you would anticipate from a in depth analysis of the method behind Neil Perts process when preparing for live performance.,1399248000,,132,5.045454545454546
4643660,5,B005BCADAY,Cant believe how much I learned from these DVD's. It has help change my approach to music. I hope he continues to put out more stuff like this!,1397174400,,143,4.142857142857143
4643661,5,B005BCADAY,I love Neil. He's a genius and a great drummer. One of my favorites. I love the way he thinks and break everything down so far,1392681600,,126,3.8846153846153846
4643662,5,B005BCADAY,"Excellent showcase of Neil's techniques, thought processes for musical innovations and general in-depth exposure to how his mind works while composing and performing. RUSH music lovers will wish there was MORE music, but true Peart fans will appreciate so much conversation from a man who is generally not interviewed much. Beautifully done.",1390780800,,341,5.576923076923077
4643663,5,B005BCADAY,"If you are a Rush fan,or even just a percussion enthusiast, this is an excellent addition to your collection.  Neil Peart.....enough said.",1390435200,,138,5.2727272727272725
4643664,5,B005BCADAY,"Purchased for my ""little drummer boy"" for Christmas.  He is almost 13.  Absolutely went crazy over it.  Didn't know Granny knew who Neal Peart was!  He honored me with the Best Grandma Award! .......and a BIG hug!  8-)",1390089600,,218,4.631578947368421
4643665,5,B005BCADAY,"Not only is Neil the exact percussionist I always thought he would be. He is a Teacher, a Shaman, a spiritual guide. His excitement about his approach to kit drumming, is quite evident. He doesn't want you to bend to his style. He wants you to take the music where it leads you. He encourages individuality. Neil takes you through all the aspects of being a modern-day arena act. He puts in the time to perfect his craft, because he respects his mode of expression. I am not a trained musician. I play drums as a hobbyist. I didn't start with rudimentary lessons, and learn counting and time sense. I picked it up by doing what I liked, and going to the next level. Neil even speaks to the beginner, which I consider myself. Any skill level, any knowledge, any technical proficiency or ability will be able to take something away from this video. His drum tech even shows you how he assembles, and mics his performance kit. There are specific key fills and ride patterns that are broken down, and then played in slow motion. As far as musicianship, and creativity, I would recommend this video to musicians playing any instrument. His views on practice, warm up and performance, in a work/life balance are essential tools for any gigging musician. All this from a very humble personality. If you are, or want to be a professional musician, this video is a must own!",1386979200,,1365,4.598360655737705
4643666,5,B005BCADAY,"If Neil Peart is on your top ten list of drummers, you need this. It is like a series of private lessons; a revelation into the inner workings of these intricate and jaw-dropping drum parts. What a guy! Many great musicians wouldn't share all this ""secret info"".",1385510400,,262,4.595744680851064
4643667,5,B005BCADAY,"If you're a Neil Peart fan, like I am, or just a drummer looking to imitate Neil's style, then this is a DVD you should buy.  He dissects each Rush song by playing along with the music, then percussion only.",1385251200,,207,4.175
4643668,5,B005BCADAY,Great fun.  If you like Rush or Neil Peart you will love spending 6 hours with him.  Listening to Rush does not truly reflect how hard this drummer works!,1384905600,,154,4.275862068965517
4643669,5,B005BCADAY,"I've been a Rush fan for more than three decades, and am also a recreational musician (mostly guitar and drums, dabbling with the bass), so it made sense for me to check out this DVD.  Many reviews have already been written, so I'll just highlight the things that stood out for me:

- Neil is a very articulate guy.  At first, he might come across as pretentious, but no, he just possesses a serious intellect so this is how he normally is.  Once you get used to it, it's quite refreshing!

- It was interesting to learn how Neil does what he does, but I have to admit that I was also slightly saddened to see his magic 'demystified'.  Of course, that doesn't mean that now I can even remotely do what Neil does, it's just that there's a certain pleasure in basking in the music without thinking about or knowing about how it's created.

- I would have preferred seeing Alex and Geddy here and there, but I guess this DVD is Neil's gig.

- I was a little surprised that Neil's physical posture doesn't seem all that relaxed - too me, he looks a bit tense.  Maybe it's a reflection of age, how hard he hits, and having to navigate a rather large drum kit?

- OK, this comment will draw criticism, but I have to be honest: I sometimes felt that Neil's timing was a bit 'off', i.e. tending to be slightly on the sluggish side.  I can't explain it, and maybe it's just me, but I've never perceived this when listening to the albums.

Not wanting to end on a negative note, let me conclude by saying that I really enjoyed this rather long DVD, in fact enjoying it more and more as I got further into it.  It was like listening to a kind, humble, intelligent, and wise friend, so I was sad when we reached the end and it was time to part company, at least for a while.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who appreciates Rush, drumming, and/or the effort involved in achieving artistic expression at a very high level.",1384560000,,1915,4.298050139275766
4643670,5,B005BCADAY,"OK, to be honest I haven't seen it.  I'm posting a five-star review to offset the 1-star review by Robert W, who *also* hasn't seen it and was just whining about wanting a Blu-Ray version (which this one clearly isn't.

I hate idiot reviewers.",1381190400,,243,4.5
4643671,5,B005BCADAY,Neil Peart say no more it's very long but you have to understand when where and why so it's more like a bio teach sort of thing but really cool tho,1380758400,,147,3.774193548387097
4643674,5,B005BCADAY,There is no better drummer than Neil Peart! I've seen him in concert several times and this is an awesome video!!!!!,1377216000,,116,4.571428571428571
4643675,3,B005BCADAY,This would be great for someone learning to play drums.  More instructional and drawn out than for entertainment value.  Not bad by any means.  Huge Neil Peart fan!,1374278400,,164,4.785714285714286
4643676,5,B005BCADAY,It's Neil Peart.  No further comment necessary.  Insert applause here to show your appropriate appreciation.  The masters make it look so easy.,1372204800,,143,5.409090909090909

4643680,5,B005BCADAY,I highly recommend this video to all musicians and Rush Fans. It is like 7 hours of material but very entertaining. La Villa Strangiato says it all.,1364601600,,148,4.518518518518518
4643681,5,B005BCADAY,"I was a drum player in a past life for sure. I never got around learning to play drums, but I love the instrument. Neal Peart is one of the most talented ones in the world. If you are a fan or a drummer, this 3 disc dvd is great. You will enjoy the interviews as well as the playing footage. It is in your face drumming experience.",1363305600,,331,3.8823529411764706

4643683,5,B005BCADAY,"Peart definitely is amazing, both intellectually and in his craft of drumming.  It's a great DVD, finally making clear how many of the beats and riffs I've had trouble over the years figuring out, are done.  Only wish the tutorial was more complete as it does not cover the entirety of the songs.",1360627200,,296,4.566037735849057

4643686,5,B005BCADAY,It Neil Peart. Enough said. How his mind works is amazing and his work ethic is astonishing. You would think that someone with his background would just sit on the laurels. Not Neil.,1359072000,,182,4.545454545454546
4643687,5,B005BCADAY,"I'm only part way through the first of the 3 discs and am impressed with not only the video (close-ups, multiple camera angles, various settings, etc.) but the dialog Neil Peart has with the audience is great - like you're sitting next to the drum kit with him.  I never knew he spoke so much!",1357171200,,293,4.327272727272727
4643688,5,B005BCADAY,"Wonderful clinic for young drummers.

4643690,4,B005BCADAY,"I am not a musician, but I find Neal inspirational in the dedication he commits to his art. This DVD is esoteric to the drumming community, but also a fascinating view for others too.",1355875200,,183,4.411764705882353
4643691,5,B005BCADAY,"Got to love the way Neil Peart plays.  This video give you the inside of some of the best songs in contemporary drumming rock history.  Wish only I could have had it 10 years ago!!! ( much to ask?) It would saved me a lot of time.  The pdf book is great, but the companion book is better.  For a Rush fan, to watch the inside history behind the making of the drum kit, the practicing room and the people involved with Mr Peart performance is amazing among other things.  Beautifull scenery, love it!",1355529600,,499,4.26595744680851

4643697,3,B005BCADAY,Very good video.  However it is very long (3 DVDs) and Neil is long winded.  I got bored with some of the interviews.  This could have been cut down into one DVD in my opinion.,1341360000,,176,3.9714285714285715
4643698,5,B005BCADAY,"I'm a Peart and Rush fan, so of course I bought this. My goodness, I'm so glad i did. Peart is great, for me he is a very wise man, the kind of person I would probably enjoy having a conversation with about lots of things, and I'm sure the subjects would get highly advanced and profound, not just about drums and drumming. Peart has a HUGE mind, the man is wise, almost like a master.

There is so much material here, I'd advise you to watch about 1 hour at a time, tops. This is because you will of course rewind and watch some sections again several times. The interviewer presents good questions, and several of those I would probably have asked Peart myself. So kudos for not being an interview with stupid questions, those we see being made by people in the media that know absolutely nothing about Rush or Neil.

So, I don't know if Neil lurks around here reading reviews on his own materials, but if you do Mr. Peart, all I can say is THANK YOU very much for making these DVDs available, I've been learning a lot with them, not only about drumming but also on many other aspects of music and life,  and your insights are of the highest value.",1339286400,2,1150,4.290322580645161
4643699,5,B005BCADAY,"This is an outstanding learning tool. Mr. Peart takes you behind the scenes of the Time Machine tour, where you can experience EVERYTHING. From his own rehearsals and warm-ups before the tour starts, song selection and how he creates his solo piece. The best part is actually breaking down the set, song by song with explanations, and video analysis of the best parts of the songs, these are shown in regular speed and slowed down, then you see the song played live with the mix of the song in full focus on the drums and the cameras just focusing on Neil.",1333929600,4,556,4.514851485148514
4643700,5,B005BCADAY,"This DVD is sensational, yes, Neil is my favorite drummer, I've been hearing Rush for over 30 years, seen them  alive and well, now I have the opportunity to see him teaching. I know there are 2 other dvd's of him, that I will buy soon, but this is too much. I am an amauter drummer and I value this dvd very much. This is a must for every Neil's fan and for every drummer also.",1331683200,3,378,3.973684210526316

4643706,5,B005BCADAY,"Even if you don't like Rush you have to respect Neil. It includes drum cam footage from Saratoga Springs, NY 2010 from Neil on the Time Machine Tour. It has the soundcheck only Neil footage no Geddy or Alex On Disc 3 it has bonus features, a interview with  Neil's drum tech and a rehearsal version of Bravado which was supposed to be on the Time Machine setlist but didn't make it, thank god Time Stand Still made it though! Every song that was on the setlist is on here, tips on how to play it and stories about the drum solo, etc. A must buy!",1325894400,2,545,4.1415094339622645
4643707,5,B005BCADAY,"This is by far the most personal and enlightening of any Neil Peart title so far, but it is focused and centered on him and not the band so keep that in mind!",1325116800,2,158,3.8181818181818183
4643708,5,B005BCADAY,"This was quite enjoyable for Neil fans who know how private Neil is.  This was insightful and everyone I know who is a rush fan wants to borrow my DVD, guess what they will be getting for Christmas - lol.",1323820800,,204,4.1
4643709,4,B005BCADAY,"Neil Peart is a GREAT drummer/percussionist.  I like to watch him perform with RUSH and I like the drumming dvds he's put out, including, ""Taking Center Stage: Lifetime of Live Performances.""  Any fan of RUSH will LOVE the dvd.  The only problem I had with the dvd is that Neil talks too much.  I'm just saying.  GREAT drummer/percussionist though!",1323820800,4,348,4.830508474576271
4643710,3,B005BCADAY,"Being a huge Neil fan, I pre-ordered this on Amazon and was happy when it arrived earlier than first expected.  However, it was advertised as having ""behind the scenes concert footage"" so I guess I expected to see how the band (as a whole, not just Niel) prepared for a concert, what there routines were etc. and was disappointed to see that other than Neil warming up on a small kit, this type of footage is not included.  However, the rest of the content was just as advertised and the interviews are very well done and moderated by someone who definitely knows music (especially Rush music!), and drumming.  They also shot most of the footage in some interesting locations that I recognize from reading his motorcycle touring books.  I find it quite interesting that growing up, Neil was the ""ultra private one"" in the band who never granted interviews or tended to not show up at the ""Meet and Greet"" events, and now is coming out with dvds, books, etc.  every year.",1323302400,8,970,4.616279069767442
4643711,5,B005BCADAY,"Neil peart has been at the top of his profession for decades, whenever there is a conversation about great drummers His name always comes up. He continues to refine his craft and serve the drumming community as a statesmen for the art. His gifts with words and lyrics are remarkable and a tribute to the Man. This DVD is a must for rush fans and musicians alike or anyone who is interested in what it takes to perform at this level.",1322956800,,432,4.345679012345679
4643712,5,B005BCADAY,"I have been drumming nearly as long as Neil has been with Rush.  Neil is one of my early influences and for all intents and purposes I have tried to emulate him more than most other drummers.  After watching this [instructional] DVD I found that a lot of the Rush songs that I've played for years, while they sounded right in my head, I have been playing ""almost"" right.  The filmmaker does a great job of breaking down some of the more complex ""Neil"" parts in such a way to give the viewer a very detailed account of the notes played and the thought process that Neil put into creating the parts.  Now, when I play pieces such as Tom Sawyer, LaVilla Strangiato, Stick It Out, Leave That Thing Alone, etc., parts that I used to say to myself, ""How the heck is he doing that with only 2 hands and 2 feet"", I find myself playing them easier and with a greater understanding of the mechanics involved.

I strongly recommend this DVD to drummers, Rush fans, and musicians alike.  Even if you are not a drummer it will give you a unique perspective on how a drummer interracts with the other members of the band.

Enjoy.",1322870400,3,1115,4.357487922705314
4643713,5,B005BCADAY,"If you're a drummer, with a little experience and a few chops under your belt, and you want to rekindle the fire...get inspired....you should buy this. The Amazon price is amazing, not that your local drum shop won't meet it; it's just that I don't know retail prices except for what I see here.
Okay, chest-beating time: I've reviewed this on my website [...] but I feel that it's my responsibility to put my mouth where my money is (ie Amazon, which always gives me a fair shake) and recommend highly this 3-DVD video package. The order of the day is objectivity. I mean no disrespect when I tell you I've never been a fan of Neil Peart or Rush to any great degree. In the 1970s, when they were fledgling I was into the stirring Phil Collins drumming performance on ""Cinema Show"" and sought to cop his odd ""odd time"" fluid bar crossing. To me, Peart and band were inhabiting a place I wasn't rushing to visit. But of late, thanks to a surprise path crossing with Neil Peart at the summer drummers' camp KoSA, and to the current Peart Center Stage DVD set, I am gaining respect so rapidly it seems I'm bound and determined to make up for lost time. With this DVD set, I get (and you will get) at bargain basement prices, superb videography that is eminently drummer-friendly, smooth pacing, provocative content, and the main event (not the selling feature for me but undoubtedly for you....)unimpeachable analysis of all those lauded Peart parts for drums. Even Peart naysayers will be stirred by the man's sincere, passionate, uncontrived account of his journey to the essence of drumming. To be honest, at a couple of points along the way, the journey was wearing on my patience: ""are we there yet?"" I'm sure,however, that you will relish every single utterance, tweak of his drum key (his roadie's), and every single powerful, articulate roundhouse tom fills. You may well ask, and get answers to, the question, How does he strike so firmly and still coax a full, blossoming drum tone out of those toms?

If that sounds heady, consider that for a case of 24 beers and a bag of chips/crisps you get fully 3 DVDs chock full of original material, not rehashed newsreels, you'll be nursing long after the beer and treats have come and gone. And maybe you will appreciate that at least one drummer out there means something other than an apology when he claims, ""I play for the song"". Peart clearly stakes his life on it. For me, the money shot is the section in which he admits to the seemingly contradicting demands....composing drum parts vs improvising them. I want to stress I have no vested interest, get no points on sale of this item. It's simply a rare, quality glimpse of a drummer I believe worthy of note....and with a 30+ years track record of writing for MD and other print mags, I have a fair idea of what's sheet and shinola, pardon my boldness.

Rob and Paul at Hudson Music have outdone themselves with N. Peart/Center Stage. It's a pathway for drummers seeking to enhance the credibility of their mission. It's evidence of the dignity of their calling. And, hey, there's a whole slew of entertaining drumming that sits well with beer and potato chips. Five out of five? Definitely.

4643714,5,B005BCADAY,"Any Rush fan will surely enjoy Neil's new DVD.
Neil is the Greatest Drumer Ever. It is amazing
To see him play, and rehearse. He is truly a master
Of his trade. Thanks Neil!",1321747200,,173,4.117647058823529
4643715,2,B005BCADAY,"I'm a nearly lifelong Rush fan, and I was ecstatic to see the product description here at Amazon that said ""transcriptions of Neil's parts included"" in a PDF...be warned, however...the actual material included is just ""excerpts"" and not the full charts.  I nearly burst several blood vessels until I read the note at the end of the eBook that says ""a forthcoming companion book will contain note-for-note transcriptions of Neil's performances from the Saratoga Time
Machine concert (also included on the DVD).""  We'll see.",1320883200,3,522,5.2023809523809526
4643716,5,B005BCADAY,"Peart is nothing short of a genius, and to see this iconic MASTER sit and talk eloquently in perfect paragraph after perfect paragraph about HOW MUCH HE HAS LEFT TO LEARN is...well.  It's Zen.  It's sitting at the feet of the master.

Now, I've banged around on drums for about 35 years and I can do some passable percussion in really banal situations--had a great time last fall playing udu at a folk sing-a-long.  I have a small electronic trap set I take my frustrations out on many evenings.  But I don't have the slightest chance of being able to play anything like Peart, ever, no matter how hard I might be able to try.

So why do I find this--what amounts to an instructional video--so mesmerizing?  The same thing that makes me watch Adrian Peterson play even when the Vikings are having a terrible season.  Just watching someone at the top of his game, knowing that I belong to the same species as the one that produced this...wonder...is uplifting.  Even if I can never do what these other people do, I can thrill vicariously at the accomplishment.

And Peart is so well-read and well-spoken that little bits of philosophy often slip out even as he holds forth on the vagaries of rock drumming.  Among my favorites on this set, he said that if you make a mistake, make it again.  Presumably to make it appear more intentional.

To underline my implied point: Even if you're not a drummer, just a fan of drumming, or of rock music, or hell, just excellence...this is a collection worth owning.  And if there's a young person in your life, someone you wish to encourage in any endeavor, she could do a lot worse than to have the humble and hard-working Neil Peart as a role model.

I know Peart is uncomfortable being lionized, and I don't want to put him up too high on a pedestal.  That sort of thing is never good for the idol, and not much good for the idolater, either.  But I think it's good for humans to have examples of what we can become, given the proper virtues of patience, hard work, inquisitiveness, creativity, humility, and wisdom.  When we see such virtues personified, as they too seldom seem to be, I don't think it goes far amiss for those of us who notice to call it out.",1320796800,159,2202,4.476190476190476
4643717,4,B005BCADAY,"Short and sweet...if you are pondering between this package, A Work in Progress, and Anamoty of a Drum Solo...pick this one. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because he didn't bring out the old set up to do a true time machine and perform the songs as originally played and not with the cutting corners.

Otherwise a great product.",1320451200,4,336,4.508196721311475

But....a DVD? At 1:33 aspect ratio? With low rez audio? DUDE....WTF?! It's almost 2012. The last 3 or 4 concert tours have all been shot in high def but you go low tech on this? What's the matter? The last few 10's of millions of gross tour $$$ wasn't enough to spring for a better camera? You can buy a good high def camera and a couple of microphones for a lot less than a decent helmet, dingus or doofus.

Seriously flawed marketing decision Mr. Peart.",1319241600,22,562,4.242990654205608

Great footage from the tour.  At 500 minutes, it's more than even this die-hard fan can handle in a single sitting, but it's just so good.  After all the previous books and videos, I was wondering what else he could possibly cover and how could it be interesting.  As usual, Neil is fascinating and goes beyond the mortal realm.  Any Rush fan, even the non-drummers will be well entertained by this.  Did I mention the sound?",1319068800,30,580,4.617647058823529

I'm not sure why they got an early realase of the DVD other than they're a major musical equipment retailer.
