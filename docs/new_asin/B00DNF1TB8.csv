The best hitter on the team is autistic and actually the star of the team and the movie. He is teased and made fun of by opposing players and some of his own teammates.

5834931,1,B00DNF1TB8,"Annoying, arid, arrhythmic, awkward. A Season of Miracles is a story about a Little League baseball team called the Robins, but, unfortunately, these Robins are never able to get this story off the ground. Its a worthy story, but amateurish acting, choppy directing, flat dialogue and fake-looking baseball scenes make for earth-bound storytelling. The only scene that looked natural was the Sunday picnic scene with the bucket of chicken, but one scene is far from enough. Good intentions and a worthy story don't necessarily equal a good movie.",1422835200,,546,5.215909090909091

However, the a mix of the cinematography, poor editing, and lacking acting that make this movie not so great. I really don't desire to write an in-depth review, so I will leave it said that way. One positive in the movie are the actors who play Rafer and Little Richard. Other than this, I honestly cannot recommend this movie to anyone.

5834961,1,B00DNF1TB8,"One star is probably too generous for this one. I feel like the people who rated this 5 stars owe me an hour and a half of my life back. To say the acting is poor would be politely stating it. It is truly shameful that a story with so much potential was simply butchered into an practically unwatchable mess -- it was only through sheer willpower that I made it to the end. I'm not sure which was worse, the horrendously bad acting or the choppy, fast forward style editing that never fully developed any scene before jumping to the next poorly set up one. The very few moments with any level of respectable acting were overwhelmed by the rest of the amateurish production.",1395014400,2,673,4.392

5834965,2,B00DNF1TB8,"This movie was really just ok. My mom bought it because of all the 5-star ratings, but we didn't think that it was that good. Besides John Schneider and Grayson Russell, the acting was not very good, and the production wasn't professional. The humor was good in places, and it was a good story, but not one that I would want to watch again and again. It could have been a great movie, but this version of the story was rather painful to watch at parts.",1385683200,3,452,4.267441860465116

These fun-loving kids teach us all how to be witnesses of our faith through simply being kind to one another!  This story also addresses the issue of bullying today as the kids on the Robins baseball team invite a boy with autism to join their team and find out the lessons he teaches them become enduring ones. This makes a great choice for family movie night, for church youth groups or kids' Sunday School classes. I highly recommend you get it today!!",1380758400,,616,4.651376146788991

All you have to have is a well written story and actors who are sincere in their parts.  This is a coming of age movie about a little league baseball team set in the 70's in Alabama.  When the team is ready to start practicing for a new season they notice a boy sitting alone under a tree.  This boy changes not only the way they play baseball but also has a profound effect on each of their lives.

5835054,5,B00DNF1TB8,"I've seen this film during previews (in both small settings as well as large theaters) and it has done extremely well presenting a good family story about faith and friendship. Set in the early 70s, a small town's boy's baseball team embrace an autistic player. The discoveries that summer about relationships and the journey these young men go through as their team not only plays ballgames, but also deals with the hardships of life. This film was well received by adults and children. The music is nostalgic and cinematography is beautiful. Great for small and large groups, and will create interesting discussions afterwards about individuals with disabilities, and ""Hope.""",1380499200,,677,5.220183486238532
5835055,5,B00DNF1TB8,"People who buy from Amazon and read reviews may know that ever since the beginning of this company I have reviewed books, films and merchandise.  Seldom have I ever been so happy to have an opportunity to review a product like this.  It is a film that will certainly be deemed a classic.  This is a beautiful film that has all the charm and grace associated with the time period and location where it takes place.  The deep South in the '70s.  Don't let the location and decade put you off as Season of Miracles is a film that will appeal to all ages and in all parts of the nation.  Especially if you like faith films and enjoy sports of any kind.  The sport in this case is little league baseball and whatever you think of the game today, the sweet innocence of what we once considered The American Game is there.  I don't want to be a spoiler, as too often happens with reviewers, however I have to say that redemption is a major theme.  There is a great emphasis on that as well as family, justice and love.  The topic of autism is also very much involved.  The kids are all superb in acting, however I will just mention four adults in particular.  Rusty Whitener wrote both the original book and screenplay and in this film proves himself to be a first rate actor.  Also excellent jobs are turned in by Nancy Stafford, Sandra Williams Van Natta and John Schneider who may be most familiar for his work in Smallville and Dukes of Hazzard.  These four serve as a backbone for the kids involved and add greatly to the film.  One further proof I can give is that I have seen the film five times in special screenings.  It was as enjoyable the last time as it was the first.  I have to add that I last saw it in a special presentation in a jam packed theater and for the first time ever saw a standing ovation at the conclusion of the movie.  You will definitely want to buy this.  And there is good news that must be added.  Rusty Whitener has written a sequel, Season of Mysteries, and this too has the makings of a great motion picture.",1379980800,,2039,4.274151436031332
5835056,5,B00DNF1TB8,I can't wait to see the rest of this movie.  I read the book which was wonderful.  This is a movie you can recommend to families without any reservations.

8594822,1,B00DNF1TB8,"What is ADR?
By Benjamin Craig, filmmaking.net

Comments (2)
ADR stands for ""Additional Dialogue Recording"", the term used to describe the process of re-recording actors' dialogue in a controlled environment (i.e. a sound studio) during post-production. During the ADR process, actors are called back to the studio to lip-sync lines recording during principle photography in time with a projection of scenes and/or a rough cut of the film. The main reason for re-recording lines is to obtain clean sound, however ADR is also sometimes used to subtly adjust an actor's performance in a scene (by having them deliver the same line with slightly different inflection). It can also be used to add new non-sync dialogue to aid the story (i.e. record a line which is then ""delivered"" while the actor has their back to camera).

ADR is used extensively on big budget films, since it is almost impossible to get clean sound on a set where several hundred people may be working, but is also extremely valuable for independent films where you don't have full control of the location (and therefore may end up with unwanted background noise in your sound).
