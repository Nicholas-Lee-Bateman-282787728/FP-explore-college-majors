If you have any kind of interest in the history of women's spirituality and where it's going that takes in the big picture of all that's gone on in Ireland since Saint Brigitte this video is for you.
It's great for watching with others, especially if you are a professor or a student of philosophy and religion. This video, not only uses statements from the nuns but actual history that the Catholic church doesn't deny. Some pointers in the video that I hope will leave you hankering for more: This video reveals how for the longest time, women were bishops in Ireland; how if it wasn't for one lone Irish bishop women officially wouldn't have had souls for who knows how long; and why women weren't allowed in European universities for over 800 years.
The background on Saint Brigitte is wonderful, and the artwork and the re-enactments from the past. Once women held important positions in the church and were able to confess to other women. With Ireland as the pristine backdrop for scenery, one feels transported to the experience of this time in a walk in the other person's shoes way which I think Christ himself would definitley approve. This is a completely, historically accurate masterpiece.
If you appreciate the Anam Cara and all that is medievel this video is definitley for you. The video also talks about Hildegarde of Bingen being stiffed by the University of Paris purely because she was a woman, and how they refused to publish her writings. The artwork is so beautiful; if you love the book of Kells you will love this also.
With important videos like this, where nuns come forward and talk, wether people like it or not, these things happened and if you want to be awake and alert it's important to be educated about all of these important events. We watched this in my Women's Philosophy class and many people's eyes were opened. Growing up here in San Diego, a very conservative city and a city with many decidedly Catholic roots, in a state renowned for it's liberalism, this video hit home for me. The one thing this video doesn't talk about that suprised me was any sort of sexual abuse by the priests towards the nuns. If it any sordid matter along those lines was in there, I don't know when I missed it, since the entire class was incredibly rapt and silent while we watched the video. That is the only thing I was curious about that was not included.
Behind the Veil: Nuns, is definitely for a person of any religious background who has a deep interest in archaelogy, the recent controversies surrounding mother goddess religions. If you like this, I also reccommmend Terry Jones' (of Monty Python fame -- they all attended and had degrees from the highest universities before Python) great series, ""Crusades,"" an intelligent, witty and incredibly accurate documentary of the Crusades. In parting, I cannot recommend the educational value and beauty and historical importance of this ""Behind the Veil: Nuns,"" video enough.",1041465600,14,3131,4.8

Unfortunately, the documentary quickly degenerates into one long complaint about the Catholic Church and how sexist it seems to be.  There  is no attempt at an unbiased view of the Church and her history here.",953596800,13,283,4.403846153846154
