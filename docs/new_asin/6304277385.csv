852051,5,6304277385,"I first saw this movie when I was 12, and the scene that stayed with me the most was of the swirling dead leaves in the empty backyard playground. I couldn't remember the name of the movie, and so I hunted for it for years  (literally) until I just recently found it through the book it was made  for, I Am Legend. I love this movie for its faithfulness to the book, but  do agree that it had some bad acting (not by Vincent Price, however).
I  think that Vincent Price did a great job as Morgan, and hardly think anyone  could duplicate his desperation and melancholy. I would recommend this  movie to anyone who enjoys more of a psychological thriller. I am a huge  vampire fan, but if what you want is blood and gore, this is not the movie  for you. It's more of an emotional and thinking movie.",949708800,11,798,4.23841059602649

The black and white screen, the graininess of the film and the feeling  that ""this could really happen"" all affected me.  I would scare  my younger brother just by saying, ""Morgan, Morgan, come out  Morgan!"" He would run and cry and I would run after him and laugh.  I  think every kid in the neighborhood went to see this movie after our  chilling review and theatrics. My brother and I are now 43 and 47 years  old.

Movies are never as good as you remember them (especially if you were only 4). But even though that is the case with this one, the fact that it was one of the first (if not THE first ) movies about zombies threatening the world, and that  it appears to be an early version of ""World War Z"", makes it a bit more entertaining.

852144,1,6304277385,"The Last Man on Earth, 1964 film

It begins with a view of a European city; no people are seen. Then we see bodies on a street. Has the end come? An alarm clock wakes up a man. He is the lone survivor. [No other forms of life?] He has electricity. His shortwave radio receives nothing. There is garlic on a door; he needs more. He must find where they hide during the day. He sharpens wooden stakes. He picks up two bodies and puts them n the trunk of his station wagon and goes for gas. Then he drops the bodies into a large pit. Next to a grocery store for fresh supplies of garlic, then a store for mirrors. His search continues. At dusk he returns to his home to spend the night. Figures appear before his home and bang on the door with clubs. The next morning he goes to a chapel and falls asleep.

The Undead arise in the night! They attack but Morgan gets to his home. He views old home movies and laughs until he cries. Three years. He recalls earlier times. Can a plague be carried on the wind? Bob remembers the past. He worked in Chemical Research to study a germ. People tell stories about vampires. Then his little girl sickens and dies! Few people at work. Will everybody die? Bodies are thrown into a flaming pit. Bobs wife is next! Can she return from the dead? Outside the walking dead call for Morgan. Sunlight brings peace and quiet. As his car was destroyed Bob gets a Ford station wagon. He sees a dog run away and tries to find it. Later he finds it by his door. Everything is going to be all right he says. But theres a problem!

He sees a young woman, she runs away but he catches her. She returns to his home. Ruth Collins was married. She is afraid of garlic, a sign of infection. Bob was bitten by a bat years ago and believes he has immunity to the disease. Is Ruth one of them? She has a vaccine for it; there are others. They want to start all over again. Ruth was sent to keep Bob there so they can get him tonight. Bob treats her, she looks into a mirror and is not afraid of garlic now. Two trucks roll up, men get out to attack! Bob runs away but is pursued; he enters the Armory. The pursuers shoot at him. Bob explodes gas grenades. Bob goes to a chapel but is wounded. A spear is thrown - he is the last man on earth! They didn't know says Ruth.

This is a very low budget drama that seems meant as a symbol for the after effects of nuclear war, where radioactive fallout wipes out people by radiation sickness. Or some other plague that wipes out most people who do not have resistance to the disease. Global cooling in the 14th century caused food shortages and migrations. The Black Death wiped out about 30% of the European population. In time they recovered; the economic effect was the end of feudalism.",1497744000,,2746,4.204933586337761

Most adults are somewhat familiar with the book I Am Legend or one of its movie ""Children"" Omega Man.  This is much better but a little one dimensional with Price's monologs.

852321,3,6304277385,"Much of the impact of this movie (visually & emotionally) is because it was done in black and white --  colorizing this vintage movie destroys a lot of that.  Below is my review of the black and white version that I rated 5 stars.

The tag-line read 'By night they leave their graves, crawling, shambling, through empty streets, whimpering, pleading, begging for his blood' if that doesn't grab you as a horror fan, nothing will. Remade many times since as The Omega Man (1971), I am Legend (2007) to name a few, Richard Matheson novel I am Legend has been a wealthy piece of source material.

This gem of a movie is without a shadow of doubt the best of the three movies based on ""I am Legend"" the book by Richard Matheson from 1954. Starring the master of terror, Vincent Price, trying to stay alive and kill as many vampires as he can before they kill him.

Despite Matheson feeling that Vincent Price was miscast in the lead role, Price gives a sterling performance as Dr. Robert Morgan who is the survivor of a devastating world-wide plague. Vincent Price is one of my favorite actors, and this is one of his best movies.
This, alongside ""House on Haunted Hill,"" his minimal work in ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and a few of his Edgar Allan Poe pictures, is by far his best work. Morgan is tortured by his dreams and his solitary existence trying to find another human still alive. Price's distinguished voice and acting really gets the viewer hooked and caring for his character who is harassed by vampire zombies seeking his blood every night.

Here's a demonstration of what you can do when you don't have money but you've got good ideas and a great sense of narration. The movie has a good premise, though by today's standards seems overdone. It is a bleak and depressing story as should be for someone living alone and lost in memories of what was, and getting up to do the same things every single day.

The whole picture looks like the end of the world from beginning to end.....Price roams the empty streets filled with abandoned cars and the walking dead who have been caught out in the sunlight. The sparse landscape and abandoned cities contrasted nicely to Price's living quarters which were piled up with supplies and generators and wooden stakes.

While not a faithful version of the novel it is well crafted by Ubaldo Ragona, who incidentally only directed a handful of films. Ragona's work clearly influenced Romero's set up of the horror classic Night of the living Dead (1968).

Admittedly The Last Man on Earth is slow in places and the music by Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter is bland and of it's time. The movie itself was a bit anticlimactic for the first half hour, but I think that was intentionally supposed to convey Price's character's boredom and the degradation of one's psyche without the stimulation of normal human interaction.
Nevertheless, the locations are great featuring, bleak backdrops and curious architecture which leaves the viewer disconcerted.

As a horror movie, it isn't remarkably gory or anything, so you may be disappointed. Price, however, does a great job as a man struggling to maintain his sanity under the intense pressures of a post-apocalyptic world. From a psychological standpoint, there is a lot to dissect here, and if you view it under that context, it is an intelligent statement on the tribulations of human loneliness. There's no hope for Morgan or humanity and it is this mood that makes the film. Corpses litter deserted streets. Morgan is allowed one laugh in the film and that turns into mania as he starts crying! And mankind gets the apocalypse it probably deserves, reduced to the instinctive animal-like creatures afraid of light we were in the stone age. And there's no place for Robert Morgan in a world like that......

This is a great movie for those who love to use their imagination over special effects.
This film has an atmosphere you just don't see in todays movies. Black and white definitely enhances the feel to the feeling of hopelessness and just shear creepy factor. What this unsung chiller gem demonstrates best is that The Last Man on Earth shows what a fascinating and captivating actor Vincent Price was.

It is just sad, they couldn't stick with the book 100%, as it is one of the best books ever written along with Ayn Rands books. But sadly, that is how the film industry is. The movie would have gotten a 5 if it wasn't based on the book, as it would have been a kick-ass stand-alone movie with no ties to the book. But, when we know it is based on a book... especially a book that is this great... The movie can't help but fade into the background, compared to the exceptional story the book offered.

A must for all old sci-fi/horror fans. Brilliant....far better than its reputation

If this sounds interesting to you, you can check out (a fairly poor quality) copy of the movie before you buy it.

If you enjoy these kinds of movies, I suggest you check out ""Svengooli"" (previously called Son of Svengooli) Svengooli is a hosted horror movie show. The show's title is taken from the name of the character host. The show is a long-running local program in the Chicago area and in recent years expanded nationally, airing Saturday nights on Me-TV. To make it even better: ""Svengooli"" (Rich Koz) is truly a nice & decent person in real life.

SPOILER ALERT
In the year 1968, every day is the same for Dr. Robert Morgan (Price):is the last man on earth, as far as he can tell. he wakes up, gathers his weapons, and then goes hunting for vampires. Morgan lives in a world where everyone else has been infected by a plague several years ago that has turned them into undead, vampiric creatures that cannot stand sunlight, fear mirrors, and are repelled by garlic. They would kill Morgan if they could, but fortunately, they are weak and unintelligent. At night, Morgan locks himself inside his house; during the day, he kills as many vampires as he can, burning the bodies. Vampires that were formerly human attack Morgan's home every night

Morgan's days are spent shoring up his home against the vampire hordes, picking up supplies in the abandoned city, and eliminating his enemies by searching out and destroying the bloodsuckers while they sleep. He maintains mirrors and garlic strands around his house and fashions stakes on his lathe to use on the walking dead. He also conducts experiments on the bacteria that caused this plague in an effort to find a cure. He remembers the early days of the plague, when his former friend and lab partner, Ben Cortman (Giacomo Rossi Stuart) tried to warn Morgan of what was to come. Morgan dismissed his fears and continued life as usual.

A flashback sequence explains that, three years before, Morgan's wife and daughter had succumbed to the plague, before it was widely known by the public that the dead would return to life. Instead of taking his wife to the same public burn pit used to dispose of his daughter's corpse, Morgan buried her without the knowledge of the authorities. When his wife returned to his home and attacked him, Morgan became aware of the need to kill the plague victims with a wooden stake. Morgan hypothesizes that he is immune to the bacteria because he was bitten by an infected vampire bat when he was stationed in Panama, which introduced a diluted form of the plague into his blood.

His solitary existence is painful. He gets on the radio every day, calling out on different frequencies, trying to find another human still alive. In his tortured dreams, he remembers when his wife returned from the dead to seek his blood, after she succumbed to the plague. Because he couldn't bear to throw her body in the cremation pit where others were taken, he buried her himself--and when she came back from the dead as a vampire, he had to drive a stake through her heart.

One day, to his amazement, he finds a dog. He is so excited to have a companion for the first time in several years, that he overlooks several signs that all is not right with the animal.
Eventually, he realizes that the dog is also infected and that he must kill it. Morgan is later seen burying the dog, which he has impaled with a wooden stake.

After burying the dog, Morgan spots a woman in the distance. The woman, Ruth, is terrified of Morgan at first sight, and runs from him. Morgan convinces her to return to his home, but is suspicious of her true nature. Ruth becomes ill when Morgan waves garlic in her face, but claims that she has a weak stomach. Morgan catches her injecting herself with something, and she's forced to admit that she too is infected but that she and others like her have developed a serum that lets them control the disease. By regular injections, they keep the disease in check: they are able to live in the daylight and do not turn to vampirism. Ruth also warns Morgan that her people are coming for him because, in his zeal to kill vampires, he has been killing people like her who have the disease under control. Morgan injects Ruth with some of his own blood and cures her of the disease completely. His blood is the permanent cure that Ruth and others like her have been searching to find.

While Ruth is asleep, Morgan transfuses his own blood into her. She is immediately cured, and Morgan sees hope that, together, they can cure the rest of her people. Moments later, however, Ruth's people attack. Morgan takes the gun and flees his home while the attackers kill the vampires gathered around Morgan's home.

Ruth's people spot Morgan and chase him. He exchanges gunfire with them, and picks up tear gas grenades from a police station armory along the way. While the tear gas delays his pursuers somewhat, Morgan is wounded by gunfire and retreats into a church. Despite Ruth's protests to let Morgan live, his pursuers finally impale him on the altar with a spear. With his dying breaths, Morgan denounces his pursuers as ""freaks"", and declares that he is the last true man on earth.",1444176000,,9963,4.674086757990867

His solitary existence is painful. He gets on the radio every day, calling out on different frequencies, trying to find another human still alive. In his tortured dreams, he remembers when his wife returned from the dead to seek his blood, after she succumbed to the plague. Because he couldn't bear to throw her body in the cremation pit where others were taken, he buried her himself--and when she came back from the dead as a vampire, he had to drive a stake through her heart.

One day, to his amazement, he finds a dog. He is so excited to have a companion for the first time in several years, that he overlooks several signs that all is not right with the animal.
Eventually, he realizes that the dog is also infected and that he must kill it.  Morgan is later seen burying the dog, which he has impaled with a wooden stake.

After burying the dog, Morgan spots a woman in the distance. The woman, Ruth, is terrified of Morgan at first sight, and runs from him. Morgan convinces her to return to his home, but is suspicious of her true nature. Ruth becomes ill when Morgan waves garlic in her face, but claims that she has a weak stomach. Morgan catches her injecting herself with something, and she's forced to admit that she too is infected but that she and others like her have developed a serum that lets them control the disease. By regular injections, they keep the disease in check: they are able to live in the daylight and do not turn to vampirism. Ruth also warns Morgan that her people are coming for him because, in his zeal to kill vampires, he has been killing people like her who have the disease under control. Morgan injects Ruth with some of his own blood and cures her of the disease completely. His blood is the permanent cure that Ruth and others like her have been searching to find.

While Ruth is asleep, Morgan transfuses his own blood into her. She is immediately cured, and Morgan sees hope that, together, they can cure the rest of her people. Moments later, however, Ruth's people attack. Morgan takes the gun and flees his home while the attackers kill the vampires gathered around Morgan's home.

Ruth's people spot Morgan and chase him. He exchanges gunfire with them, and picks up tear gas grenades from a police station armory along the way. While the tear gas delays his pursuers somewhat, Morgan is wounded by gunfire and retreats into a church. Despite Ruth's protests to let Morgan live, his pursuers finally impale him on the altar with a spear. With his dying breaths, Morgan denounces his pursuers as ""freaks"", and declares that he is the last true man on earth.",1444176000,,9740,4.686182669789227

852515,5,6304277385,"Vincent Price stands right up there with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing when it comes to horror movies. I first saw ""The Last Man On Earth"" on T.V. sometime in the sixties. While not a fan of any Italian movie made in the 60's and 70's, this movie was and is a standout. The movie is in glorious black and white and completely lends to the spookiness of the movie. I have a copy of the movie in my library but unfortunately its a public domain copy of poor quality. I wish that the movie will be restored and available on DVD/Bluray.
The movie has twice been remade. In the 70's it was remade as ""The Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston and more recently as ""I Am Legend"" with Will Smith. Both remakes are in color and both movies are excellent. I recommend that every movie library should have copies of all three versions",1421798400,,822,4.3441558441558445
852516,4,6304277385,"Having read the ""I Am Legend"" book, this first film adaptation remains, in my opinion, the closest of the three official film versions to its source material.

This is not to say that there are not changes between book and film, but there almost always are with most movie versions anyways...  Vincent Price in the lead role (named Morgan instead of Neville for some unknown reason to me) delivers a fine performance although he seems somewhat miscast with the lead character as portrayed in the book.  However, he was the only big name at American International Pictures at the time who made the film so that probably accounts for his selection more than anything else.  However, Price's narration throughout the film with that terrific voice is a real plus.

This first film version of the book definitely suffers at times from its low-budget production values (a hallmark of American International Pictures) but that is not to say that it prevents one from truly enjoying the film overall.  Again, if you are a fan of movies when they mostly stick to the original concept rather than playing too much with the basic story, then this version (as opposed to ""Omega Man"" and the most recent ""I Am Legend"") is probably the best one for you.  The flashback scenes (pre-leading up to the apocalptic events that end in nearly total world depopulation) also occupy a decent chunk of the movie so as to give overall context and understanding.

The film also provides Price the opportunity to provide a fairly straight-forward, non-""over the top"" horror character which he did not have much of an opportunity to do in the mid-sixties period otherwise. (This film came out in 1964)  There are also really no gore scenes of any kind in the film and instead such actions are more implied and left to your own imagination.  As this movie has officially been made three times now (not counting ""I am Omega"") it is interesting to compare and contrast it to the other versions.  For the reasons I have stated, I think it holds its own against the other versions on its own merits although it is not my favorite version (that would be ""The Omega Man"" which I wrote a separate review for)

If you are a Vincent Price fan or a fan of post-apocalyptic films in general, this one should be fairly satisfying.",1421712000,4,2289,4.709273182957394

852519,1,6304277385,"I'm exploring the zombie film genre by starting with movies based on Richard Matheson's 1950s book ""I am Legend.""

It was eye-opening to see a rather average old film.  ""The Last Man On Earth"" wasn't a big-budget affair.  The special effects were not very special, and the supporting cast is tiny.  The movie wasn't a commercial smash and wasn't critically acclaimed upon release.  Wikipedia says ""I am Legend"" author Richard Matheson wrote the script, but was so disappointed in the finished product that he withdrew his name from the credits.  I'll say this for it...it gave me a deeper appreciation of how far movie making has come!

Price has been praised for his acting in other reviews here.  I thought he some good scenes.  His eyebrows alone can be SO expressive!  But, there were at least as many awkwardly delivered lines and examples of distractingly strange timing or emphasis errors.  Today's movie directors would have insisted on re-doing some of these scenes.  I guess that's part of why modern movies take longer and cost more to make.

Low production values I can tolerate if the story's good and the characters are compelling, but that just wasn't the case here.  So many core decisions and plot twists in this film made no sense, rendering the story more irritating than entertaining.  Characters act irrationally without any discernible motivation.  These flaws confuse the viewer and ensure the characters' ultimate doom.  Irrational decisions that HAVE BEEN set up by described character flaws or history make for great stories.  Unbridled, uncharacteristic stupidity simply does not.

At one point mid-movie, I thought things were looking up.  During the flashbacks to the viral outbreak, there was an opportunity to shape Price's character and let us understand his path.  It just didn't ever develop.  Not for me, at least.  Felt like a missed opportunity.

Even to the end, I held out hope that the last scenes would tie things together and save the film.  It simply didn't happen.  The ending whiffed on any semblance of clever irony or insightful closure.  It just seemed pointless and left me wishing I could get my hour and a half back.",1416009600,,2167,4.963788300835654

Both of those movies were 'reinterpreted' from the story I Am Legend into something more exciting and barely recognizable from the source material. They were entertaining to be sure, and both used a similiar formula, but if you're looking for an adaptation of the book, this is it.

The story isn't an action-packed shoot em' up of man vs vampire. It's a very quiet tale of the last human left in a world that's gone over to vampirism, and his personal quest for answers and survival. Whereas both Will Smith and Charlton Heston played characters that were former army officers and biologists, physically robust and combat ready, the actual character of Robert Neville is just an ordinary guy. In the book he teaches himself biology in an attempt to understand what's going on, and every night he contends with the masses of undead who surround his home and endlessly taunt him to come out.

I enjoyed this movie for what it is, an honest attempt to adapt adecent story to film without all the bells and whisles of Hollywood. Vincent Price pulls it off as only Vincent Price can and we're left with a movie that does credit to the story it's based on.",1407283200,3,1269,4.660714285714286

852589,3,6304277385,"An aging Vincent Price takes the lead in this early interpretation of Richard Matheson's dystopian source material, recently mined by Will Smith in I Am Legend. It's a dark, troubling picture that's far more bleak and unflinching than its contemporaries. I don't consider the '60s to be a terribly fertile period for such eerie, subdued science fiction / horror mashups, but despite a few off-putting slips this holds up admirably. Price is miscast in the lead, awkwardly overplaying the emotionless, hollow aspects of the central character, even in flashbacks where it's completely inappropriate. He feels out of place as a doting, caring father - often speaking around his daughter like she isn't even in the room - and that tears away some of the natural sympathy of his plight later in the picture. The creatures that constantly plague him are effectively spooky, so long as they keep their mouths closed. A certain ambiance is lost when the shuffling human monster outside the barricaded window knows your name and encourages you to ""c'mon out"" in the wee hours of the morning. This was a lesson well-learned by George A. Romero, who's admitted the monsters' portrayal in this film directly influenced his beasts in the seminal Night of the Living Dead a few years later. As an exercise in world-building, this is a broad success. It's tangible, vivid and realistic. The plot flails around absurdly at times, though, and the finale is a mish-mashed mess that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

Let's get this much out of the way: Vincent Price is the man. He was great at what he did, he's a legend among horror fans (if not moviegoers at large), and he possesses what might be the most maniacal laugh of all time (which he utilizes in The Last Man On Earth). So what's the problem? The issue with this film is that Price isn't at his best, and I would even argue he was miscast in his role as Robert Morton. He never gives the viewer the impression that he is capable of having survived for three years in a vampire-ridden world where everyone has seemingly died or turned into monsters. The disappointingly anti-climactic climax of the film is proof enough of this, though Robert is portrayed in numerous other scenes as nave, silly, or downright stupid.

Exacerbating this problem are the vampires themselves. I get that this movie was made in the 1960s, but come on- they're goofy as can be! The vampires are both un-scary and unthreatening. Not once are we, as viewers, really concerned that they pose any danger to Robert- and their presence is supposed to be the central source of conflict for the entire film! Incredible.

Fans of Richard Matheson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/0765357151/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>&nbsp;(the novella on which The Last Man On Earth is based) will note that the film stays fairly true to the book, even to a fault. Indeed, some scenes (the one with the dog comes to mind) don't mesh that well and could have been removed or replaced with little consequence to the viewer. The drama of Matheson's story is just not captured.

All in all, The Last Man On Earth is worth viewing for Price alone even though it isn't one of his best films. That said, it is not nearly as good as I remember it being when I first saw it. Sadly, it has moments where it gets just as hokey as other cult horror films of the 50s and 60s. I mean, the last man on earth still dresses like a professor and tucks in his shirt! Smoke billows from a chimney of an ""abandoned"" building in the opening scene! ""New York"" certainly does not look anything like New York. And Price just doesn't fit the role. The Last Man On Earth is a mediocre classic best suited for fans of black-and-white horror.",1388275200,,2529,4.638392857142857

Vincent Price reminds us that he had been a ranked star before becoming a horror film specialist. I saw him in live performances twice when he replaced Charles Laughton, who directed, in a superb stage production of Shaw's, Don Juan in Hell Scene, from Man and Superman, which toured extensively in the fifties. It starred three Masters and a Mistress of Acting, Cedric Hardwicke, Charles Boyer, Agnes Moorehead and, originally, Laughton, sitting on stools, ""reading"" scripts, and emoting by turning their head toward one or another side as they spoke to the three others in the row. It was a School for Actors, an evening to remember. My point is, that was the League in which Price once played. In this role, he shows his stuff, with none of the exaggerations forced upon him by many a director of horror films. There are elements of weakness, of course,  some because of a script not always what it should have been (as the author of the book properly pointed out) and a supporting cast not on the A list, even, I imagine, for the Italian Company that produced it. Still and all, it is a film to be watched; think of it as a TV movie in the early days of almost no rehearsal and most of the acting budget going to the star- if there was a Star. (George Burns reported that he and Gracie took a major cut in salary when they shifted from radio to television because George thought it was the medium of the future worth taking the reduction to get in early.)

It really is just an average zombie movie and I got bored and did not even finish watching the movie.

852733,3,6304277385,"I am a huge fan of the original novel I am Legend by Richard Matheson, on which this film was based. The book and film are about the last man on earth after a worldwide catastrophe. The main character is played by Vincent Price. Dr. Robert Morgan (Neville in the book) counts down the days, talks to himself and tries to cope with the fact the world is ending.  As a fan of Vincent Price perhaps my expectations were too high because Price is very understated here. I wouldn't consider it his best film performance. This movie was released in 1964 so it can drag in certain parts. It was originally filmed in black and white but there are colorized versions available. The pacing is slow compared to modern standards. Psycho was released 4 years earlier and I'd say it moves at a faster clip.

Since there are so many versions of the film available with the original black & white, colorized version, enhanced b&w and others here is the lowdown. The film itself is average and you are better off checking out I Am Legend (starring Will Smith) or The Omega Man (starring Charlton Heston) which were also based on Richard Matheson's novel. The Omega Man is my personal favorite but it is very dated too (70s music and wardrobe). This film is for purists only. Even this version deviates from the source material so it doesn't satisfy everyone (the remake with Will Smith is probably the closest to the source). Obviously the wardrobe, acting and effects may seem dated by modern standards (almost 50 years later). If you want to own the film check the version before you buy and do your own research to make sure you get the right one. Despite its flaws, I prefer the original black and white film.",1376697600,,1696,4.557377049180328

852735,5,6304277385,"The Last Man on Earth is a film adaptation of the book I Am Legend.  In it, Vincent Price plays the sole survivor of a plague that has turned the rest of humanity into blood-thirsty vampires.  The last man on Earth- Dr. Robert Morgan-lives in a boarded up suburban house with supplies of liquor, mirrors, crosses, garlic, and records of classical music.

His days are a series of repeating scenes of vampire hunting, & research on the plague.  His evenings are spent besieged by vampires, some of whom he knew very well prior to their becoming undead.  How the plague came about, and how it so deeply affected him is explained in flashbacks.

One day, Dr. Robert Morgan meets a woman who is also not affected by the vampirism that has so destroyed humanity.  He takes her in, but becomes suspicious of her when she gets sick after smelling garlic.  It turns out she is a spy for a group of humanity that have become vampires, but are not undead.  They are reducing the effects of the plague through medicine and are re-building civilization.

Dr. Morgan is therefore a monster-he lives by day and murders the living vampires while they rest.  Dr. Morgan is a legend, a horrifying, solitary creature that plagues a struggling community.

This movie very much moves within the current of the Spiritual Awakening of the 1960s.  It has a lonely idealist man pitted against an up and coming community.  Through its story, the film asks 'what, exactly is normal?'  The black and white film greatly portrays a post-plague earth of empty buildings, empty streets, and hiding vampires.  Vincent Price carries the film with his powerful performance-in the final scene we see that Dr. Morgan can save humanity by his blood, but instead his blood is spilled.

I wish to emphasze that my review focuses on the original black & white version-such a version enhances the story and I'm not so sure about colorizing the film.",1375747200,,1908,4.750759878419453

And if twenty years or so ago you'd posited that the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air would outshine Vincent Price and Charlton Heston in what essentially is the same role, I would've thrown my ""Parents Just Don't Understand"" 12"" vinyl in your face. And yet the first hour of I AM LEGEND just grips you, with Will Smith submitting a haunting performance as Earth's last remaining survivor. But we're not here to talk about Will Smith.

THE LAST MAN ON EARTH features one of Vincent Price's more restrained stints on the silver screen, and it suits him. He plays scientist Robert Morgan, last survivor in a post-apocalyptic world in which a plague has wiped out mankind, has mutated the living into vampires. It's been three years since humanity perished. Today Robert Morgan roams the empty cityscape, going about the dreary business of living but also doing his due diligence. By day he hunts the vampires in their nests. By night he holes up in his boarded-up home, mirrors strategically placed, cloves of gralic festooning his door, sharpened wooden stakes always at hand. He drinks heavily and plays loud music to drown out the nosferatu's entreaties for him to come out. Robert Morgan, three years after doomsday, is half out of his mind.

Those suffering from germaphobia - which isn't at all a fear of folks from Berlin - should steer clear of the film. The plot does adopt Matheson's deconstruction of the vampire mythos, applies Matheson's scientific approach. Vampirism here doesn't arise from the supernatural but from germs. THE LAST MAN ON EARTH impressed me years ago when I was a kid. But I must say that, seeing it now, the fear factor doesn't quite hold up. And that's something to do with the vampires themselves who shamble like zombies and aren't at all menacing. The gem in the film is in Price's performance. But I wonder how much of that is the titillation achieved by watching Vincent Price's dispensing with the hammy theatrics? He adeptly conveys the loneliness, exhaustion, anddesensitization of a man left by himself too long and trapped in the ultimate untenable situation, his humanity eroding in increments. Most of us are privy by now of Matheson's Indian giver third act, of how our guy glimpses the possiblity of hope but then is deprived of it. It's a morbid, nihilistic ending, and it depressed me when I was a kid. Even the folks from OLD YELLER said it was too much of a downer ending.",1353196800,,2965,5.429501084598699

As a result of a then new airbourne virus three years earlier, civilization has all but become entirely extinct, leaving those infected to become a form of vampire. Our protagonist goes about what has become his normal routine: making stakes for daytime hunts of the nocturnal beasts, finding fresh garlic and mirrored glass to protect his battered home, and pondering ever more what his purpose is in continuing to live in such a desolate environment. This early film adaptation of Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"" could easily be described in three acts: What Is, What Was, and the Change of Events. The What Was (a flashback giving a better idea of what happened) is, thankfully, in one solid piece, as I was concerned multiple flashbacks throughout the film would occur. This allows the ""present"" time to establish itself and set the isolated tone needed to feel for our ""hero"". Price was the only one that could pull off such responsibily as often being the only actor onscreen for a genre film during this time period. However, much of the potential that Price easily could've ascertained if allowed does not happen, leaving his performance subdued and limited. The vampires themselves seem to act more along the lines as a precursor to the zombie mannerisms in George Romero's Night of the Living Dead years later. And by the time we discover the ultimate of ironies, it doesn't seem to be fully presented enough to garner the level of emotion the viewer could've reached.

(1964)
---------------------------------------
An excellent adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel, ""I Am Legend,"" about a vampire/zombie plague that has swept the entire planet. Vincent Price stars as the lone human survivor, who has adapted himself after three years of numbing isolation and horror into an efficient, remorseless monster killer. Some critics complain that Price was too stiff and unathletic an actor for this role; I don't think it matters much... What is important is the feel of the film, particularly the embedded social commentary and paranoid ambiance, which were the essence of this kind of film at the time. There is some great black-and-white cinematography (the colorized version is bogus; thank goodness they include the original B&W version as well...) with powerful imagery that amplifies the social messages of the film. Is it dramatically clumsy?  Yes, but horror movies generally were, back then... This is an outstanding movie for the genre at the time, well crafted and thoughtful.  You'll dig it.  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1280102400,,1097,5.4035087719298245
852915,4,6304277385,"There were a lot of horror films that deeply affected me as a child. One of my earliest film-going remembrances was the time my father took me to see the original Planet of the Apes (1968) on its first theatrical release. The problem was is that we arrived a bit too early, and we caught the film's big  shock ending ... Charlton Heston rides up on the beach with his cave woman girlfriend to see the remnants of the Statue of Liberty and we learn that this so-called ""alien planet"" is in fact the planet Earth after some unspecified holocaust. As a child of eight, I was only vaguely aware of the nuclear threat at this time, and I was suitably unnerved by this final image. Chuck Heston's histrionics notwithstanding (""He's screaming and wailing - just like your mother!"" my dad pointed out, laughing), I begged out of watching Planet and we departed after seeing the considerably milder second feature, The Watermelon Man (1968).

The fact that the world could go up in particulate matter with the press of a button would be explored further in the Planet of the Apes sequel, Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1969), educating countless school kids about the insecure status of humanity in the postwar world in a succession of G-rated installments.

One other film that clued me in to the haunting finality of death, nuclear or otherwise, was the first adaptation of Richard Matheson's I  Am Legend, The Last Man on Earth (1964). Vincent Price is seemingly the only human being left on the planet after a mysterious plague sweeps the world, transforming other survivors into vampires. Price barricades himself in his suburban home (supposed to be in Los Angeles, but shot in Rome - giving the film an even more off-kilter flavor), while at night the undead hordes call out to him to join them - stark shots of black-and-white terror that could be dropped wholesale into George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968) without the slightest trace of continuity error.

Two scenes in Last Man chilled me to the bone, and continue to do so - those who denigrated this film, which included Vincent Price and Richard Matheson, fail to grasp the power this strange film still wields. Price loses his young daughter to the plague, and bodies are tossed into a giant fiery pit at the edge of town in an effort to control the pestilence. Price tries to spare his daughter an anonymous burial (remember, the Holocaust was still very recent when this was filmed, and filmed in Europe), he is pushed aside by an impatient government worker who says, ""There are a lot of daughters down there - including mine!"" Never had the Apocalypse been rendered with such blunt, unsympathetic words to my then-tender ears.

The second scene has Vincent Price discovering a bedraggled poodle and he is momentarily cheered with the prospect of a companion to ride out his lonely solitude with - until, of course, he examines the dog's blood to see that the poodle has the vampire virus, and he collapses in mirthless, bitter laughter.  The next scene has Price burying the poodle, stake through the heart in his back yard, which should be hysterically funny - but just isn't.

The message to my young mind was absolutely clear. Death, the ultimate monster, strikes little girls and poodles just as cold and merciless as anyone else, including grown-ups. Furthermore, adults had all the cards in their favor - they could push a button and wipe out humanity, draft young men to fight in foreign wars to die in battle or consign their own children to fiery, bottomnless pits with a brisk, bureaucratic efficiency.

I wish there was a heartwarming or reassuring thing to share about this monster kid memory, but there isn't any. This horror film had fulfilled its obligation of engaging me, thrilling me and introducing me to certain truths that my own parents, at that time, were themselves too terrified to tell.",1278547200,2,3887,4.772321428571429

I have two DVDs of this film, this one and a cheap one I bought which was put out by Silver Screams, and oh boy, please avoid the latter as it was such a terrible print with blank lines through the picture, contrast completely washed out, constant black squiggles and the sound was horrendous.

The plot can be summed up in a few sentences and the hour and a half of actual film time was way too long. It should have been condensed into a 22 minute Twilight Zone episode. The ending is a little bit of a let down after the buildup. There is way too much left on the plate to explain when the credits roll. Also the zombies themselves aren't very scary. The can't even run, and are kept at bay by a few boards in a window. The new ""I am Legend"" film is better. It's still isn't perfect, but it's a big improvement over this film. At least Will Smith has a reason to be scared in the movie unlike Vincent Price in this film that can simply push the zombies away.

When weighing what I'm saying against what others have written, it's important to note the release date of the DVD, December 4th, 2007.  Some of the reviews below were written prior to that date, and they're discussing a very different, very inferior edition, probably made from the faded, fullscreen, public domain copy which you can download for free at Internet Archive.  MGM released this edition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Man-on-Earth/dp/B000WC3A0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Man on Earth</a>&nbsp;to meet the interest generated by the Will Smith remake.  It bears the MGM logo on the spine of the case, the lion's roar before the DVD menu comes up, and it's a pristine print in widescreen format.  It is not marred with scratches, and it upconverted beautifully from my Sony Blu-ray player to my HDTV, which is a concern for me these days.

And as a special feature, we get a 7-minute interview with Richard Matheson, author of the now classic novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/B001FOR5XU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>&nbsp;that the movie was based on.  It's a simple interview, sprinkled with insights and ideas, how he thought of the book, and so on; not much to it, but nice just the same.  Mainly it's the picture quality of the movie itself that's the real attraction on this disc.  This is the edition you want to get if a good clean copy is what you're after.

Price does a remarkable job interacting with practically nothing --- He's alone throughout the majority of the film --- His performance largely carries this low budget film from director Ubaldo Ragona --- When you watch the movie alone, you really feel where his character is coming from and a sense of hopelessness is established --- The Last Man on Earth is really a thought provoking classic --- I recommend it be watched with Charlton Heston's The Omega Man to see another take on the same story (both were based on Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"").

Story line and plot, Dr. Robert Morgan (Vincent Price) as the sole and devastated survivor of a deadly plague that exterminated the entire human race, including his own wife and daughter --- Price due to his immunity to the lethal germs, he's the only one to fight victims who return in the shape of vampire/zombie like creatures --- Even though it has already been 3 years, Morgan desperately continues his search for other survivor --- This is one of the most impressive performances Price ever brought to the screen, and a lot more difficult than his usual roles of villains and madmen --- Judging by today's standards, I guess the film looks very dated and you can't really refer to the tame 'vamp zombies' as threatening anymore --- But the empty streets and depressing cities still are the ultimate in eeriness! --- this also was an immensely influential film --- You can't watch 'Last man on Earth' without being reminded of George A. Romero's milestone genre film 'Night of the Living Dead'. If you then realize this movie was made 4 years before Romero's classic, you can't but reckon the underrated brilliance of this film --- The same hopelessness aspect that made Romero's film so tense features HERE first, in 'Last Man on Earth'! --- This production offers an ideal proportion of frights and sentiments, luckily without too many tedious scientific speeches or faked drama. 'Last Man on Earth' has to be seen by every SF/horror fan on this planet --- For some reason this is one of the most underrated genre efforts ever, and that urgently has to change --- Legend Films has made that change.

853075,5,6304277385,"Talented an actor as Will Smith is, he's no Vincent Price, not yet anyway.  Price is a name, face and voice that we instantly associate with the best in horror films.  So it goes without saying that his version of I Am Legend--now available in full color for the first time through this Amazon VOD service--is far superior to the modern incarnations of the same story.  Without providing spoilers, let me just say that Price's performance and the script in general are much more subtle, reliant on audience participation and psychology as opposed to the mindless action bloodbath of Smith's recent version.  For that reason, and because for the first time, this classic film has been re-mastered to the image quality standards demanded by today's high resolution computer monitors, as you can tell from the preview video, I highly recommend it to the potential downloader.",1228435200,6,872,4.993103448275862
853076,5,6304277385,"Vincent Price, the master of horror himself, stars in the original (and, in my opinion, far superior) 1964 adaptation of the acclaimed science fiction novel, I Am Legend.  What ensues is both a fantastic film exploring the human psyche and an opportunity for Price to spend the entire runtime demonstrating his considerable acting talent to enthralled audiences.  Any fan of Price will be captivated by his emotion-laden and occasionally campy performance.

The colorization process applied to this DVD by Legend Films is as flawless as I am able to discern.  In fact, without knowing beforehand that the film was colorized decades after the fact, it would be nearly impossible to tell that this was originally a black and white film (though, as is their standard for all colorized releases, Legend includes the black and white version on the same disc).  Nostalgic value aside, I would venture that few of you will actually choose to watch the black and white after seeing it side by side with the color version.

And, to the adulation of Price fans such as myself, the disc contains a special featurette hosted by the man himself, entitled It Happened in Hollywood.  It appears this was an old television show where Price would analyze and explain what elements composed various film genres.  In the included episode, Price takes a look at Westerns & looks quite dashing himself in a cowboy getup.",1227571200,4,1399,4.948717948717949
853077,5,6304277385,"""The Last Man on Earth"" is an early example of how fantastic, even on a minimal budget, a movie set in a post-apocalyptic world can be. This movie starts with Vincent Price, who plays the role of Morgan, waking up to another day of being the lone survivor of a vicious worldwide plague, disposing of bodies, stocking up on mirrors and garlic, crying over his lost loved ones, and battling the undead. There are lots of silly parts in this movie, but there are also lots of really cool innovative aspects. The movie tends to drag after the first 15 minutes or so, but it really picks up from the middle on. Definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys zombie movies.",1227225600,,664,4.541666666666667
853078,3,6304277385,"If you're looking for the best B/W version of this film on DVD, then either of the two MGM DVD's, is the way to go, but if you want it in colour, then the Legend Films disc is sufficiently colorized for your viewing pleasure.

I have both of the MGM DVD's, and just got in the Legend Film one to do a comparison, seeing as no one else had done one, and I was stupidly enticed by the, ""includes restored original black & white version"" that was written on the top of the rather badly done DVD cover (the MGM, The Last Man on Earth movie only edition, has a better cover, still not the greatest, but better than this cover),

Here's the lowdown, it looks like the exact same print was used for all three DVD's, with the exception that the Legend Films picture has a couple of incidental dirt specs removed at the very beginning of the film (like 3 or 4 in a 5 minute span) but in return, the picture is just a touch softer then the MGM image (where as the MGM image quality is very crisp over all) and a slightly tighter frame around the widescreen.

Yes, and erroneously, the DVD cover states the film is full screen, but it's actually the widescreen version in both the B/W and colour versions.

Another problem with the Legend version, is that even though they seem to make a big stink on the cover about the B/W version, in actuality, the B/W movie has a play only option, with no chapter stop menu (although you can skip forward using your remote, at what looks to be around 5 minute increments) and I was unable to use the, ""goto"" feature on my remote to jump to a specific time point in the B/W film (the scene select in the DVD menu, only allow you to jump to scenes in the colorized version).

As for the colorized version, the colours are dark pastels, as per most colorized drivel, kind of reminding me of the early 2 strip Technicolor process, used before the 3 strip process was invented, which gave skin tones a tanned, orange/brown look, and muted all of the other colours.

So, the MGM DVD is the way to go for serious lovers of this film, but for novices who might want the novelty of the colorized version, then the Legend DVD is an okay second choice.

Hope this helps :)",1225411200,75,2188,4.283292978208232

something different.
The acting was horrible at best and I feel this could've been a great movie.
I am a lover of classic movies, but this was a real let down.

Were they Zombies or vampires and the freakin surviving humans were more

853142,5,6304277385,"The Last Man on Earth - a classical tour de force by Vincent Price.  There have been many immitators and updates over the years but none can beat the ""Master"".  While Charleton Heston and Will Smith are good actors, they aren't in the same league with the classically trained and experienced Vincent Price.  The pain and suffering in his eyes and body when his young daughter and then his wife succumb to the disease as well as the absolute horror in his expression when his vampire zombie-like wife returns to their house is absolutely riveting.  The sorrow expressed when he is betrayed at the end is almost a physical weight for the audience.  Altogether, another fine performance by a real professional actor.",1219363200,2,713,4.811475409836065

The movie with Will Smith uses only the name and concept. The Last Man on Earth shows us the Robert Morgan's (Neville in the novel) fight to maintain his reason, in a boring world, alone, except for mindless vampires. It is a Hate It or Love It type movie. If you want to see a history close to the Novel in a movie were the actor performance need to compensate the lack of special effects and were the point is the Psychological pressing in the last man on Earth, ok, you will like it. If you want gunshots, high-speed cars, fights, explosions, special effects ever if far from the original story, you will hate it.",1210896000,3,758,4.3076923076923075

You still have the wearying feeling of what life is like in this new world.  The different chores you have to do everyday just to stay alive. I thought Vincent Price did a pretty good job and I loved the inclusion of Ben pounding on the walls.  Very enjoyable.",1210204800,2,431,4.35
853146,2,6304277385,"I saw this film for the first time back in the late seventies,it was good then and it was good now with the exception of the print. The one I initially saw on TV in the seventies was far superior to this one believe it or not and it makes no sense as to why. I gave this film a two star due to the bad print only,Considering this was the most expensive of all the prints that Amazon sells and its a Black and White version so there's no excuse for this putrid print. The picture is practically whited out,pixelized and it jumps,shame on you REELCLASSICFILMS,why restore such a cruddy version? Do yourself a favor and look for another print of this film,Amazon offers five or six other prints. This version of""I Am Legend""was closer to the original story in my opinion than any of the other two movies,""The Omega Man""and""I Am Legend""with a few exceptions. The backdrop of the story was supposed to be in San Francisco but here it was filmed in Italy,a very different overall look and feel that even author Richard Matheson himself expressed dismay at when it was first released. Secondly,the vampires themselves carry on a bit like zombies,but in all the other versions,none of them addressed the fact that there were two types of leftovers from the plague. Those who died and became vampires and those that got the plague and did",1208822400,,1329,4.564853556485356
853147,4,6304277385,"Marvellous early version of the movie that was to be remade as ""The Omega Man"" and later under the original book title ""I Am Legend"". Dark & well made, sticks quite closely to Richard Matheson's book.

Black & white filming augments the early special effects/makeup.

A must see for all who saw ""I Am Legend"", also for fans of Stephen King, as Richard Matheson is King's biggest influence.",1208736000,2,389,4.705882352941177
853148,3,6304277385,"This is really a fun zombie movie (even though some refer to them as vampires, they are really not).  You're not going to find yourself on the edge of your seat, worried that zombies are going to attack and kill the stars of the movie.  Instead, These creatures are mellow and lethargic.  In fact, they are not even all that scary.

The movie opens as Price seems to be the only ""man"" left on Earth.  He searches out zombies by day and returns to his fortified home at night.  He has a flashback that brings us up to date on how things became they way they are.  A strange virus seems to infected everyone and the world's population is quickly dying.  If the bodies are not burned, then the dead come back as zombies.

I won't give away the ending but there seems to be an interesting idea brewing that leaves us something to think about.  If there is more of them then there are of us, does that switch the roles of good and evil?

While I wouldn't consider this a classic horror movie, it is still a fun movie to watch.  Run time is about 90 minutes.  Price's maniacal laugh is worth the price of the movie alone.",1207526400,,1115,4.252380952380952
853239,2,6304277385,"This badly dated film is the most faithful adaptation of ""I Am Legend"", a short novel written by Richard Matheson.

But, sadly, that does not make it the best.  It does, however, make it more worthwhile than the waste of time with Will Smith, ""I Am Legend"" from 2007.  That movie basically trashed everything good about Matheson's original story in favor of 'been there/done that' zombie nonsense.

""The Last Man On Earth"" features a poorly cast Vincent Price (in a downright woeful performance) as the only survivor of a plague that has either killed everyone or turned them into vampires.  Price is terrible in this film.  He portrays Robert Morgan (Neville in the book) in the most one-dimensional way possible.

In case you are wondering which adaptation is the best, it is ""The Omega Man"" starring the late great Charlton Heston.",1207526400,2,834,4.872340425531915
853240,5,6304277385,"So,I AM LEGEND has finally come out, with its big name star and its big budget and its big computer generated special effects, but when the smoke and hype cleared the fact remains that THE LAST MAN ON EARTH with Vincent Price filmed back in the 1960's in black and white with no virtually no budget and no special effects at all is still the best available adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic Horror/SciFi novel. THE LAST MAN ON EARTH is the story of a single human being and his day to day struggle to survive in a world devasted by a plague that has turned all other living creatures into vampires, while at the same time he tries to understand the nature of virus that caused the plague and perhaps bring about a cure. Its far deeper and more complex than the newer film, but like the newer film it deviates from Matheson's novel in its ending by giving us a Christian interpretation of Morgan/Neville's attempts to save the world with his blood.

Matheson disapproved of LAST MAN. He felt that Vincent Price was wrong for the role, that it called for a more rugged man someone along the lines of Charlton Heston who later did play the role in THE OMEGA MAN which was the second (and extremely ill-fated) attempt to bring Matheson's novel to the big screen. I'm sure he also disapproved of the endings of both films which took on a decidedly Christian tone as Morgan/Neville try in vain to save the vampires with his own blood. Both LAST MAN and OMEGA MAN end in scenes blatantly re-enacting the crucifixion of Christ. In Heston's case its almost impossible for the modern audience to stifle a laugh considering his public personna. The last film version ends in a manner not dissimular when you think about it. Sure there isn't any actual crucifixion per se but Neville is still offering up his own life and his own blood so that the world may live. This ending too is absolutely at odds with the Matheson's book. It simply has nothing at all to do with it.

We may never see a perfect adaptation of this landmark novel which is a brilliant blend of both horror and science fiction. Why, because Matheson has written an ending that is cinematically unsatisfying--virtually unfilmable. So do yourself a favor and see THE LAST MAN ON EARTH and then read I AM LEGEND then you can decide for yourself.",1206230400,8,2306,4.567632850241546

The version I have is a DVD with the title Last Man on Earth at the top in white capitals and Price carrying a body at the bottom, coloured light brown and the top an odd blue. The picture is as good as new, the audio is listenable and very sharp and in all my years of seeing different versions of this film, this is by far the best. It could as well be a collector's edition. Every copy I'vce seen, Price mouths something and half a second later words start being projected, not with this one though.

So, in quality and value for money, get this version of the last man on earth, no other cheap, unrestored or value double or triple pack. This is the one to have. Released by MGM Video/DVD entertainment.",1204848000,10,922,4.2988505747126435

Taken from Richard Matheson's novel ""I am legend""- Richard Matheson was the screenwriter for many Roger Corman movies starring Vincent Price too, like The Crow, The Haunted Castle and other ones inspired to Edgar Allan Poe's stories. In this movie, Vincent Price is the last survivor in a world of vampires; his relatives, now vampires too, call him at night and stand outside his house to drink his blood. He is lonely, gloomy, jaded, in his macabre daily routine- waking up, killing vampires in their sleep, burning their corpses.  But still he doesnt lose hope and fights, and maybe he will find other survivors.
It's a shame they did such a crappy remake of this masterpiece, and it's a shame that everybody saw ""I am legend"" and nobody knows the original.",1204416000,,804,4.826086956521739

I watched this film on a HD channel and it probably looked better than it ever has. I am aware of the book 'I Am Legend' which this and 'The Omega Man' were taken from but, I have never read it. I know this film follows the book closer than 'The Omega Man' but, I think that film edges this one out. The biggest problem with this film is the Vampire/Zombies are so slow and weak they pose no threat to anyone. In one scene Price is covered with these creatures and he pushes them off of himself like they were a bunch of blankets. I know, I know, in the old days ""zombies were slow"" but, in this film it is truly ridiculous and hurts the overall tension.  Another problem is Price is held up in his house which couldn't keep a gaggle of geese out let alone a horde of zombies who's only motivation is to kill him! ....all they would have to do is drop a match and this little chicken coup would have been a blaze. On the plus side, Price is terrific as usual and the film does have some atmosphere. I don't know how the DVD transfer is on this edition but, I have this film on another release with 'Panic In The Year Zero' and the transfer in very good. I'm sure part of the reason I like 'The Omega Man' over this film is that I saw it in theaters as a kid age 9 and it was just too cool to believe in those days.",1203984000,,1463,4.010273972602739

I compare this movie's campiness to ""Space Hunter"" Adventures in the Forbidden Zone in belevablilty, so sue me!  But that is what makes it so fun, it's so funny at times.  A disease of some kind effects the entire populace and only Pryce's character remains to clean up the mess(""It's his duty"").  The only lame part is the bit about his cohort who goes from being a nice guy to a zombee who is constantly trying to get in to Morgan's house.  Why not give it up for a bit? It's hilarious anyway.  Zombees who speak must have a bit more intelligence than that.(Zombees don't talk!) The story takes place over a three year period,and it's ""The Future"" as in 1965-8 or something.  The haunting scenes of a neighborhood with algea growing about the houses, buildings ect is very well done(in the 1960's) and illustrates a derelict city, much like even NYC would become if no one were there.  The Twilight Zone did an episode called ""Last Man on Earth"" yet the plot was completely different.  From the crumbling city and the failing infrastructure(very well done indeed!) from lack of maintainence, to Pryce's performance(though not anyone else) this was a fun movie, yet not the most memorable Pryce film, the plot is basicaly a repetitive narrative of traversing about in an old convertable dumping bodies and recounting the sad town an how it came to be that way.  Pryce whines a lot as Morgan and the woman who he befreinds is pathetic.  However, if you want a good memorable Pryce film, try ""House of Usher"" or ""Pit and the Pendulumn"" very good performance and supporting actors too!  Don't add this to your ""colletion"" unless you just like it for laughs, it is Space Hunter quality for 1965.  Just a fun watch, nothing to be taken serious!",1202169600,,1818,4.608695652173913

853248,5,6304277385,"I don't understand why Richard Matheson was so unhappy with this first film version of his novella I AM LEGEND.  I just read the book for the first time, then re-watched the movie, and I must say, this is as faithful a cinematic treatment of a novel as I have ever seen.  Sure, some things are changed, but that's always necessary when adapting a literary work to the screen, and one would think Matheson would know that.

Placing the flashbacks to the protagonist's earlier life all together as a ""second act""--rather than scattering them throughout the story as the book does--works very well.  Okay, the Price character is not a scientist in the book, but so what?  Everything else from the book is there, except for the hero's research into the medical cause of vampirism; that made the book quite interesting, but would have been deathly dull in a film.  The movie does insert a new bit about the hero making a vaccine from his blood (something that was carried over into THE OMEGA MAN), but it only makes the ending all the more bleak, because with his death the vaccine can never be made.  Yes, the movie does hype up the action in the final scene, probably because the film needed a bigger payoff than the quiet suicide scene in the book.  But it works very well.

In short--Matheson wrote a downer of a book, and it was translated faithfully into a downer of a film.  I think Price did a great job, and I rate this film very highly.  The photography and atmosphere are superb.  Don't miss it!",1198713600,3,1501,4.518518518518518

853317,4,6304277385,"Horror legend Vincent Price plays Dr. Robert Morgan, the only man on Earth not affected by a strange new plague that has infected the rest of humanity turning them into vampire-like creatures.  By day, Morgan drives through the city, collecting food and supplies and staking as many of the creatures as possible. At night, he locks himself in his home, listening to jazz and the sound of his former friend calling out his name.

Price's portrayal of Morgan as a tragic figure is perfect. As a doctor, he tried valiantly to create a serum for the disease but failed. Heartbreakingly, he watched as both his wife and young daughter were taken by the plague. His once beautiful home is now just a shadow of its former elegance.

Desolate shots of the city coincide with Morgan's mundane existence. He doesn't enjoy killing, it's just something that he must do on the shopping list of survival. In between fighting for his survival, Morgan grieves for the life he once had. A particularly poignant scene involves Morgan watching old home videos. His jubilant laughter degrades into a mad crying spree.

Convinced that he is truly alone, Morgan is surprised to see a young woman, Ruth (Franca Bettoia), walking the streets during the day. He chases her and finally convinces her to come back to his home. At first he is ecstatic by her presence but it isn't long before he is questioning whether she is truly one of ""them"", his paranoia getting the better of him.  While Ruth appears to be normal on the outside, she holds a secret greater than he could ever suspect.

The Last Man on Earth makes for great late night entertainment. Grab a bag of popcorn and settle in for a classic of sci-fi/horror.",1198022400,3,1695,4.70945945945946
853318,5,6304277385,"This review is for the 2007 MGM release only.

I have now owned three different versions of The Last Man on Earth.  Being a huge horror/sci-fi fan, this has always been one of my favorite films.

I first fished out a public domain copy in some department store bin for $1.00 a couple of years ago and was quite thrilled in getting to see this movie again (it had been 15 years or so since I'd last viewed it).  The quality of this copy however was......  let's just say it was watchable and not much else.

The second copy of this film I owned was a St. Clair Vision video which was a bit cleaner, sounded better and contained a matted form of widescreen.  Okay, we're getting better, but still not there!

Still not happy with the product owned, I thought what the heck and purchased this latest effort; MGM's 12-4-07, 2.35-1 ratio widescreen release.  This movie has been re-released obviously to capitalize on the upcoming remake of ""I Am Legend"" starring Will Smith.  (Side Note: This version may have appeared earlier on an MGM Midnight Movie doubleheader along with ""Panic in the Year Zero"" but that DVD is now hard to locate.)

My one word review boils down to: WOW!!!

The restoration and transfer for this version is awesome.  It really is like watching this movie for the first time ever.  The images are crisp and vivid and the sound is much cleaner than previous versions.  There is also included a short interview with Richard Matheson about his writing of the novel, ""I Am Legend"" on which this film is based.

So in conclusion, if you want the definitive version of this film on DVD, this is the copy to get.  I'm glad I did.",1196985600,11,1640,4.486486486486487
853319,4,6304277385,"My first & only viewing of this movie was at a 50 cent matinee at the 1 theater in town. We watched dozens of vincent price movies in the 60's & this was one of the best. I had thought about watching this again for years and then saw that the remake was coming out. I look forward to watching it again with my kids and comparing to the remakes. I never really thought about the history of it relative to george romero's zombie movies & the omega man. The movie in black & white, vincent price's anguish, and the low budget sets give a certain campiness to it but it gives a great sense of bleakness & desperation to the whole idea. It was a twist on the end of the world but something surviving in a different way",1196985600,2,713,4.1
853320,4,6304277385,"I haven't seen this film on DVD - bought a cheap version and it was badly copied and unwatchable.  Anyway, the first time I saw this movie was back in the early 1970s (before cable) - around Halloween and on the local independent channel, WCIX, I believe. This is one film that has always stayed with me.  I finally read the story upon which this film is based and I think it is a pretty good adaption.  As one commenter wrote, the book dwells on the dog and the movie less so, but still a heartbreaking part of the story/movie.  For the time when the movie was made, I thought it a rather sophisticated piece, unlike the Hammer/Lee vampire, et al flicks.  What is haunting about the movie and the story is the whole underlying theme of being the last man on earth.  I get annoyed when critics mention The Omega Man and never this movie.  Mr. Matheson may have had some heartburn with this movie adaption, but really, it was years before The Omega Man.  It will be interesting to see how the upcoming Dec 2007 release of I Am Legend does with respect to the original story. One aspect of the story and this version is that it is timeless, raceless, etc.  Dr. Neville (in the book) could be any man or woman anywhere in the world...",1195948800,2,1231,4.3406113537117905
853321,4,6304277385,"THE LAST MAN ON EARTH is one of those end-of-the-world sagas that posits the notion of what it would be like to live in a largely dead world after some ghastly war or plague with nobody else left.  The twist here, taking its basis from Richard Matheson's classic 1954 novel ""I Am Legend"", is that you do have one human protagonist left alive, and a world full of things that want to kill him.

Vincent Price stars as Robert Morgan (though he is Robert Neville in both the book and the latter film THE OMEGA MAN [and the 2007 version with Will Smith, under the author's original title]), the only survivor of a terrible plague that decimated Earth, and turned everyone into vampires.  By day, Price goes out into the city to stake and burn as many vampires as he can.  And at night, he must barricade himself against the hordes that prowl around his isolated fortress each night, including his ex-friend Ben Cortman (Giacomo Rossi-Stuart), wanting to get at him.  Price tries to find a logical and scientific explanation for the vampire plague (explained in flashbacks to when the plague began); and in due time, he happens upon another survivor, a woman (Franca Bettoia) who seems to be normal.  But there is a fairly diabolical twist that Bettoia turns out to have in store, for both Price and the vampires.

Often seen as a precursor to George Romero's 1968 horror classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and Danny Boyle's more recent 28 DAYS LATER, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, though very flawed in many aspects due to its rather low budget and its being filmed in Rome (Matheson's original novel is set in post-plague Los Angeles, as is THE OMEGA MAN), does have an extremely high creepiness factor that is very difficult for a lot of horror/sci-fi hybrids to come by, especially today.  Price may not have necessarily been the ideal one to play Robert Morgan (one of the many reasons Matheson disavowed the film and used his pen name Logan Swanson for the screenplay credits), but he does a fairly good job all the same.  The direction of Sidney Salkow and Ubaldo Ragona is fairly perfunctory for the most part, but certain scenes do stand out, including Price being caught outdoors at dusk after visiting his wife's grave; and Price having to see his wife come back from the dead as a vampire.

Matheson's novel remains one of the high points of both horror and science fiction literature (and without much doubt the greatest vampire story since ""Dracula""), and ironically it has proven to be a fairly tough one to adapt and still fit Hollywood (THE OMEGA MAN differed wildly from the letter of the novel but retained the basic spirit of it; the Will Smith version has done likewise).  But if one ignores the inherent flaws of this near-Poverty Row production, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH can easily be seen as a fairly good cult film of ""legend.""",1186704000,,2836,4.640718562874252
853322,4,6304277385,Not the best screen quality...but still a fun watch. Plus I enjoyed the added bonus short movie.,1176336000,,96,4.705882352941177
853323,3,6304277385,"I received this movie in a very timely manner and it was in great condition. The DVD looked like it was transferred directly from the film itself. It was grainy and had that old theater quality,which at first I was a little annoyed by, but as the movie continued, it sort of made everything a little more authentic, like listening to a record on vinyl.

The movie itself was a mixed bag. Anything with Vincent Price is at least worth a look, and this movie served as not only a very close adaptation of a well known story(I am Legend by Richard Matheson) now under production at a major studio, but as a direct inspiration for one of the best horror films ever-Night of the Living Dead. All those facts about the movie peaked my interest and I was very excited to be able to see it. I came away from the experience satisfied, if a tad underwhelmed.

The plot of the movie revolves around a plague that has devastated the world population. All the victims of the disease die, then return as a weak strain of vammpire. We're not talking abuot typical vampires though, they have all the weaknesses but none of the strengths. They're physically weak, and their brains function at minimal capacity. Vincent Price plays a man who is apparently the only surviving member of humanity. By day he wanders the streets collecting supplies and finding the vampires resting places and killing them. By night he holes up in his barricaded house and waits out the inevitable attempts to break in by an ever growing grouop of the undead, one of which was an old friend. In the last quarter of the movie, he stumbles upon another survivor who is not what she appears.

The pluses of the movie are several, Vincent Price being one as his performance oozes a quiet desperation and his excitement at finding someone else alive is palpable. He has the weight of carrying the film and does so wonderfully. The night attacks have a great creepiness about them and you can definatly see a direct link to NOTLD in these scenes. The biggest difference being the fact that these living dead creatures talk. One of them(Vincents characters friend) pounds away endlessly at the barred window calling his name over and over in a dry, monotone wail. Its a great spooky moment. The scenes during the day are well done too. Showing the monotony of having his set routine planned out every day and there  are several striking images, most namely a giant fire pit that burns constantly giving him a place to dispose of bodies.  The shortcomings of the movie however almost balance out the good stuff. the movie is a little dated and the acting of most of the secondary characters(primarily introdcued in flashback) verge on cheesy in that old Hollywood Melodramatic vain. Scenes of Mr Price and his family(who contacted the disease) vary from forced to heartbraking as Mr Price has to deal with watching his daughter die. For the most part though these scenes are a little overexplanatory and sometimes unnecessary. These scenes provide some of the main frustration with the movie, portraying the bleakness and hopelessness of the story but done with clunky overbearing acting, along with that old hollywood opinion that audiences can't figure things out for themselves, so explain,explain,explain. Mr Price has several voiceovers at the beginning of the movie as well that seem extraneous. His voiceovers when used as a tool to set up the story and portray his lonliness work very nicely, but when used to illustrate very simple points the really don't need verbalization, become very frustrating very quickly.

All in all though,if you like classic horror and if you want to see an old school end of the world flick that has the guts to tack on a bleak ending that most movies of that era wouldn't, you could do alot worse.",1170374400,,3789,4.733333333333333
853324,5,6304277385,"""The Last Man on Earth"" is the 1964 adaption of the book ""I Am Legend"" by Richard Matheson. It's a little on the low-budget side, but it's got a strange atmosphere to it that I found very interesting.

Vincent Price plays Robert Morgan, the last man on Earth, after a mysterious, mutanting virus wipes out the worlds population and replaces it with vampires. Robert is immune, perhaps due to a bat-bite he got in Panama. To pass the time Robert will listen to records, watch old home movies, and even visit the church, but most of the time he's gathering garlic, staking sleeping vampires and dropping off dead plagued bodies into a pit for burning. He is haunted by how the world got this way, how he lost his wife, his daughter and his best friend to the disease, and though immune to the plague is plagued by loneliness. That is, until the day he encounters a woman still alive...

The soundtrack (and silences between) are what really propel things along, I think, adding the mood to the sparse black and white imagery. Vincent Price does a pretty good job as Robert Morgan, he's as strange as his situation, and can be emotional when he has to be. Some of the scenes in the film are actually pretty creepy, like the flashback of Robert's wife as a vampire, rattling the door handle, and then staring wild eyed at her former husband once the door is opened.

It's worth a look for sci-fi fans, though I think it helps if you're into the b-movie side of things with this one. I'll have to check out and compare it with ""The Omega Man"", which is a 1971 remake of sorts starring Charlton Heston.",1162857600,,1596,4.47766323024055
853395,5,6304277385,"""The Last Man On Earth"" is, bar none, one of the best vampire films ever made.  By extension, it also makes some very concise and at times remorseless comments on the human condition.  While I wouldn't characterize it as being nearly as powerful as Matheson's ""I Am Legend"" (the low budget and actors I think they just grabbed at random in Italy make that an impossibility), at times it comes very close.  The mood is unrelentingly dark, hopeless, with only a few false steps here and there.  At times we feel such pity for Price's Robert Morgan that we are tempted to stop watching the film.

What makes this exceptional despite the obvious flaws is the sheer realism of a situation seemingly so unrealistic: one man survives as the human race takes its last breath (presumably) under the pressure of a pernicious disease that either leaves them dead or swaggering, repulsive corpses who prey on those still living.  He is a doctor, and he is fortunate enough--or unfortunate enough, depending on your perspective--to be immune to this ungodly virus.  In an attempt to keep himself alive long enough to understand the complexities of whatever it is that took not only civilization but his own wife and child away from him, he is forced to to exterminate these half-beings by day and board his house up at night as they campaign for his blood, attacking his fortified house with sticks, stones, and whatever else they can get their decomposed hands on.  You really have to admire the director's attention to detail: he even meticulously documents Price's trips to the local abandoned supermarket.

Perhaps the most gut wrenching scene in the film is when Morgan's wife returns to him in a state of absolute degeneracy, trying to excite his emotions for the living woman he has lost forever while what stands in front of him is a pile of mangled flesh moaning his name.  The scene is not shown in its entirety, but that only adds to the power.  Unlike ""The Omega Man"" (which is, admittedly, a guilty favorite) ""The Last Man On Earth"" does not back off one inch from Matheson's unflinching portrait of a doomed cosmos and a man with a responsibility that would crush, or at least drive mad, the average human being.

I don't understand why Matheson was so displeased with the results that he changed his name (in the credits) to ""Logan Swanson"" (wow, isn't that really believable?)  This is religiously faithful to the text and Vincent Price's performance is stunning.  Having fallen into complete obscurity, I became aware of it's existence years ago from a real Price film-buff who sent me a VHS copy and then I discovered it on DVD.  Time has not changed my perception of this beautifully dark film.",1156118400,4,2700,4.763948497854077
853396,5,6304277385,"I was once watching the Sci Fi Channel and there is was, The Last Man On Earth, with Vincent Price.  It had just started and the scenes, so quiet it was almost like watching a silent movie, with him getting gas for his car, hunting for garlic and collecting mirrors were very powerful.  I realized it was a vampire movie but not just any vampire movie.  So I was trapped, sitting in my chair, watching it all the way to the end.

Based on the story, I Am Legend, by Richard Matheson (one of the greatest authors ever) it really uses the empty settings and natural background noises to pull you into the reality of a world that has died.  It seems longer than the 87 minutes length than it really is and being in black and white adds to the feeling that the movie is nothing but a great story with great actors.  No special effects, no flashy gun fights, no chase scenes...well, OK, a few chase scenes.

The film really shows a man doing anything to survive.  The canned goods, the need to keep track of time, the gas generator, the house turned into a fortress.  And the need to fight back anger, the need to find hope and the need to stay human.

If you are a vampire fan you NEED this movie or your collection is flawed.",1146096000,43,1222,4.251082251082251
853397,3,6304277385,"'I Am Legend' is probably my favorite horror novel, and perhaps my favorite novel of any sort.  When I heard about 'The Last Man on Earth' I was intrigued, if not terribly optimistic.  Vincent Price and Robert Neville? (now renamed Robert Morgan) You've gotta be kiddin' me.  Nothing against Vincent or anything, but he's just not appropriate for the role at all.  Still, I was kinda interested and my brother eventually came across a copy of it selling for like 1 buck, so we gave it a look.  Not too bad really.  Price indeed doesn't really work as Morgan, as he should be a fairly normal, if tougher than average guy which doesn't describe Price at all no matter how you look at him.  Still, he worked better than I had anticipated, all things considered, though his voice overs tended to be on the melodramatic side.  It's actually a pretty decent looking film, nicely shot in widescreen,(though it is often abundantly obvious that it wasn't shot in America) and it has a reasonably desolate feel, and it can occasionally generate a shade of the sort of sadness that filled the novel. Performances tend to be rather too flat or too affected, but this is pretty much par the course for this sorta film.  It actually follows the novel fairly closely.  It still deviates in a lot of ways, but it's a helluva lot closer than 'The Omega Man' was.  Occasionally, however, they try and condense some things so much that it probably would've been better simply not to try them at all. (I'm particularly thinking of the episode with the dog.)

Really, this film turned out a lot better than I'd have anticipated it would've.  Before watching this I wouldn't have thought that 'I Am Legend' could be filmed well, but now I suspect that it can.  Again, this version is far from perfect, but they probably did as muc with it as they could've hoped considering the various constraints they had.

A super-plague has wiped out the world's population, leaving only meandering vampire-zombies to roam the streets by night.

853401,5,6304277385,"This movie shreds virtually every rule of moviemaking and screenwriting and still succeeds.  Act 1 is Vincent Price by himself, with limited voiceovers, going about his day-to-day life after the world has been overrun by vampire zombies.  Act 2 is an extended flashback.  And Act 3 introduces a whole new character.  The scriptwriting software packages would seize up and go blue-screen if you tried to write this.  And yet, this unconventional structure holds this excellent film together.

Unlike other horror movies of the time, the mood of this movie is unrelentingly grim and serious.  Indeed, the mood, content and cinematography foreshadow ""Night of the Living Dead,"" another movie that was ahead of its time.  No rubber-suited monsters or cheesy villians here; instead, the bad guy is a bacteria that just can't be stopped.  In this respect, ""Last Man on Earth"" is a precursor of films like ""28 Days Later,"" where zombification is the result of a physical process like disease, rather than some supernatural mumbo-jumbo.  The bacterial basis of the vampire-zombie phenomenon adds to the realism of the film and therefore its effectiveness.

Price really shows off his vastly-underrated acting talents in what is essentially a one-man show, the most difficult of environments for an actor to shine.  If you never realized how good an actor he was, you'll understand after you see this.

Of course, as a low-budget movie, there are a couple of flaws, but none of them are fatal or even particularly damaging to the film.  First, the supporting players are generally terrible actors, to the point of causing me to groan ""nice read!"" after some of their wooden delivery.  However, this is Price's film, and if some of the other cast is not up to par, you only see them for a short while before they're gone.  Second, some of the bits and pieces near the ending don't quite add up.  However, they still manage to add up enough to create a very effective end to the film.

This film must have fallen into the public domain, given the number of different companies that offer it, and its widespread availability in the dollar bin at various retailers.

This movie gives a different take on the whole zombie genre(probably because it was created before Night of the Living Dead was capable of tatooing the typical zombie into our minds).

Anyway, Vincent Price plays Morgan, who literally is The Last Man on Earth.  The rest of the human population has been taken ill with a virus that slowly kills them and brings them back to life as blood-thirsty zombies.  But they really only move like Zombies.  They share the same qualities that a vampire would(afraid of their reflection, afraid of garlic and crosses, etc...)  We are given a good walk-thru of what the average day in the life of Morgan is like and then the movie takes a spin to his life before the virus spread.  This is my favorite part of the movie, because you can really see the influenece this movie had on George Romero.  There are news casts, trying to explain what is going on, there are people who are afraid oftheir bestfriends..it really is excellent.

853404,3,6304277385,"I recently picked up this movie on a whim for $1. It's an early zombie film similar to the omega man where the people are sickened by a virus that wipes out most of the planet leaving only a few survivors - only it's not actually a zombie film at all, but a vampire film based on Richard Matheson's 'I am legend'. But anyway, I prefer to see it as a zombie film. More interesting is that vincent price's character seems to by the ONLY person who survives without getting sick - all the others are kept alive by some mysterious treatment.

anyway, that's all details. the important thing is that this movie starts better than it ends, but that's OK, it's still fun. i think that this is the only zombie movie i can think of that presents zombification as non-to those who are attacked. (i can't remember if this is the case in the omega man.)
they're also slow and weak and don't seem to have the typical hunger for human brains. interestingly they do foreshadow bub's memory of their past lives, and they even taunt price as they clamour at his door at night.

853504,2,6304277385,"The movie ""The Last Man on Earth"" is one of those movies that at this point in time people may laugh at or leave the theater. Usually when people hear that it's a black and white film they turn it away immediately. There is much more to this movie then viewers may think. Sure, it has its moments where a person can't help not to laugh at, but it also has great points that most people look past. The main reason most viewers look past the entire movie is because they are so used to the films that are out today. There are movies like ""Lord of the Rings"" that have so much action and awesome special effects that blow older movies away. The technology is so advanced that the directors are competing for the most complex scripts and scenes.
What makes a great movie? Movies are supposed to leave some things to the viewer's imagination or they'll never use their brains. ""The Last Man on Earth"" leaves so much out, that it really makes a person think. The new releases that are out are quite similar to this film are movies like ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Resident Evil"", and ""28 Days Later"". They all deal with some kind of virus getting out and killing almost every person on earth and only a few are still alive. Some people would say that these are run-offs of ""The Last Man on Earth"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" which are both old movies. The only thing missing in ""The Last Man on Earth"" from movies today is blood, humor, and nudity. Do those characteristics really make a movie? It's ridiculous to add comedy to a scary movie or horror flick. That will just confuse the viewer to either laugh or to be scared. One of the main things that are seen in films today is nudity. It's like a movie is not good enough unless some kind of body part is exposed. Plus, a viewer will barely ever see a naked male, but almost always see a naked female. That doesn't really satisfy both genders. Most movies are sexist and view women as incredibly weak, unstable, sex objects.
This movie has its downsides because of the lack of realistic situations. One thing to think about is that Morgan couldn't get the disease because a bat bit him, so there has to be more people or animals out there that has the same anti-venom. There are millions of people out there. If there were no more people alive except Morgan after three years, how is the electricity still working? It was ironic that a lady would appear out of nowhere and then run away. The movie viewed women as uneducated, unsuccessful, house wives. The wife of Morgan was the first person to transform into a vampire or zombie. The viewer gets to decide if the dead are actually zombies or vampires. Throughout the movie it gives hints that the creatures are vampires but it also gives hints that they could be zombies. They only come out at night, they hate to see themselves in the mirror, they're allergic to garlic, and they bite at the neck. On the other hand, they look like zombies, they seem retarded and dumb, and they come back to life after they are dead. So it's anyone's assumption on which creature they really are.
There is so much imagery in this movie. It makes a person look at life in another perspective and to not take simple things like going outside at night to see the stars and going to the grocery store for granted. In this movie Morgan couldn't go out at night time and during the day he spent all of his time filling up his gas tank, getting just enough can food to last him, new mirrors and fresh garlic to protect himself. He would wood up his house and have crosses all around to keep them out. This showed how a person can protect themselves in their own home and to believe in god. A scene that was a little ironic was when Morgan ended up dieing in a church. That is symbolic since he was the last real man on earth. When Morgan cures the infected woman with his blood, it shows that people can actually cure each other, and we have our own medicine within us. Since the people who were infected but found a semi-cure killed Morgan, it states that we kill what could keep us alive. He was the last human alive and they killed him out of stupidity.
For the most part this movie is well written and great for the horror lovers. ""The Last Man on Earth"" has meaning behind the scenes and actually makes people think deeper then what's handed to them. The viewer gets to create or add on to the film. A famous novelist, Wolfgang Iser believes ""texts leave great portions unexplained to the reader, whether as gaps in the narrative or as structural limits of the text's representation of the world. This basic indeterminacy ""implies"" the reader and begs her participation in synthesizing, and indeed living, events of meaning throughout the process of reading."" This means that if you replace text and reading for script and viewing it would make since that this is what the producer and writer of this movie wants to capture with his/her audience.",1083196800,8,4925,4.443093922651934
853505,4,6304277385,"I watched this movie in my composition II class at USF and I really enjoyed. I wrote the following paper regarding the underlying religious symbolism throughout the movie. It was very well done for its time and I would definitely recommend it.
Robert Morgan, who is the main character and in fact ""the last man on earth,"" survives a certain plague-type epidemic that engulfs almost everyone on the face of the planet. Morgan lives day by day throughout the movie in fear for his life and preparing for the sun to set and the defense to go up. The virus affects humans by turning them into zombie-like vampires that only emerge at night to feed on fresh blood and spread the disease into the healthy population. Morgan just so happens to be the last man untouched by the sickness which has a symbol in itself. The writer intends to portray Morgan as Jesus, the Jewish savior for which Christianity is based on. Jesus was thought of as a threat to the Jews during his time. His religious beliefs that he was the son of God angered the Jewish people greatly. They looked at him, as what would be equivalent to in this day and age, a cult leader. Morgan is by no means portrayed as a cult leader but he is in fact the only man left who is healthy and in the right state of mind. Everyone is after to kill him because they looked at him as dangerous and a threat to their existence. This resemblance could be built upon the writer's intentions on comparing Jews to zombies who are out to eliminate anyone that doesn't conform to their beliefs.
Morgan holds a cure to the virus, his blood. It's yet another symbolic approach to the pro-Christian ideology intended by the writer. Morgan's blood is ""pure,"" immune to the virus and the key to saving human existence. Robert Morgan developed immunity to the virus during a fever he obtained which made his blood very valuable to the infected. The zombies did not see this and continued to pursue his extermination. According the Bible, Jesus had the power to heal the sick and helpless. The correlation between Jesus' special ability and Morgan's unique blood draws a holy characteristic in Morgan. He is very much portrayed as a modern day Jesus in this fashion.
As the movie progresses towards the end, the religious affiliation is very evident. Morgan learns of the infected people that have been taking an injection to help house the virus from fully affecting them, turning them into blood thirsty zombies. These infected people now see him as a threat since he has been eliminating them, not knowing that they have found a way to sustain the virus. Morgan's actions at this point are much like that of Jesus'. Morgan was only trying to eliminate the zombies, not innocent people. He didn't understand that his actions were being shunned upon by the ""healthy"" infected group. He even goes about transfusing his blood to the infected woman he meets, making her immune. The correlation with Jesus here is that Jesus was only doing what he believed. He didn't mean to harm anyone, but the majority of the population looked down on his beliefs and actions and still persecuted him. The infected party didn't want to give him a chance, or even explain to him that they found a way to control the virus. This similarity may not be very clear on the surface but the facts between these two ideas are strikingly similar.
The religious symbolism even expands out past the portrayal of Robert Morgan as Jesus. As Ruth enters the picture, so do the symbols of Jesus' once loyal friend turned betrayer, Judas. Ruth, who is part of the ""healthy"" infected population, runs into Morgan out during the bright hours of the day. Morgan is shocked by the sight of a healthy woman. It's no coincidence that she just happens to run into him as she makes it appear because we soon learn of her deadly role. Ruth is acting as a spy for the infected population hoping to find some information on Robert Morgan to eliminate him. Morgan takes the woman into his home and cares for her. He even goes about transfusing his blood to her body to destroy the virus in her. Ruth realizes Morgan's value and good intentions and this specific detail is very symbolic of religion. According to the bible, Jesus cared for Judas as did Morgan cared for Ruth. Judas then turns his back on Jesus to collect an award for information on Jesus. After Judas does this he then realizes what he has done and tries to stop the Jews from arresting Jesus. Ruth in turn, tries to save Morgan as Judas did. She tries to explain the good to the people against him but no one will listen. Jesus and Morgan both suffer death because of the betrayal of a friend and misunderstanding of a population.
The death of Robert Morgan is the most powerful and religious attribute throughout the entire movie. Any doubt of the presence of religion will sure be over ruled by these scenes. Moments before he is executed by the infected group, he is seen fleeing from them, trying to escape. He tries to seek refuge in the closest, safest building which just so happens to be a church. However, this church was not able to bring help to him. He was already marked for death and the infected followed him right into the church and up to the altar. There he stands, facing the group, above them all on the alter. This scene is the most religious symbol present in this movie. He is about to be executed like Jesus, above the enemies, just as if he were on a cross. He is then hit with a spear in the chest and collapses at the foot of the altar.",1083110400,4,5523,4.551758793969849
853506,2,6304277385,"The film The Last Man on Earth and its contemporaries, Brides of Dracula, Blood and Roses, Black Sunday, and Dracula, Prince of Darkness, each portray vampires in a slightly different way, yet there is a common thread in each film. These films are variations, to some extent, of the original Dracula movie that was released in 1931. This film has greatly influenced the portrayal of vampires on the big screen in its predecessors, then and today.
In the original Dracula film, the unblinking Count Dracula is, at first glance, a dark, debonair and dashing gentleman. Unlike the vampires in The Last Man on Earth, he appears to be a normal person in that there is no indication that he is deceased. As the movie progresses, his disturbingly inhuman qualities surface, making him a truly frightening individual. He bites his victims on the neck to drain their blood. At various times during the film, he changes from a human to a bat. He has to sleep in a coffin containing dirt from his homeland. He retreats from garlic and crosses. In order for him to enter a home, he must be invited in. He has no reflection in a mirror and is killed by being impaled with a wooden stake through the heart. There is also the stereotypical plot of the hero and his love interest, usually his fiance, whom Dracula seems bent on adding to his harem of the dead. The hero has rescue his love and this usually leads to a showdown between man and monster, with the monster losing.
In the film Brides of Dracula, the depiction of vampires is similar in nature. The vampire bites his victims on the neck, and he is terminated by a wooden stake through the heart. Blood and Roses, released in 1961, has a slightly different theme. It is an adaptation of the novel Carmilla. In this film, the vampire is female. Her spirit inhabits the body of one of her relatives and in that way, she is reborn. Black Sunday runs along the same lines with the lead vampire being female, but it has a little twist. In addition to being a vampire, she is also a witch. Princess Asa (the vampire) is sentenced to be burned at the stake by her own brother. As her body is consumed by the flames, Asa brandishes her future relatives with a curse. After she is killed, her body is buried in a crypt, with her coffin guarded by a cross to keep her from rising again. 200 years later, the cross is damaged and she rises from the dead. Much like in Blood and Roses, she takes a female victim, who is a relative, and tries to take over her body. In Blood and Roses, the victim was willing and accepted the take over. In Black Sunday, the victim is taken forcefully and will be killed to renew Asa's life force. She is found out, and stopped before her victim is killed.
Dracula, Prince of Darkness has all of the clichs common to vampire movies of this period: the dashing gentleman, the coffins, the transformation from man to bat, etc. Even the plot has a similar theme. Hero, his fiance, and friends stay in a foreboding castle-like home, against the warnings of the townspeople. Come to find out, the home is the final resting place of Dracula. He is resurrected and the chaos begins. Of course, Dracula captures the hero's fiance with the plans of making her one of his own. A showdown ensues with Dracula once again being put to death. In this film, however, it is not by the stake. Dracula meets his demise in a frozen river when the local clergy realizes that the water flowing under the ice is fatal to vampires.
The portrayal of vampires in The Last Man on Earth is much different from any other vampire movie produced at this time. The characters become vampires through a disease rather than getting bit; though those that do not already have the virus can become a vampire if bitten by an infected person. They are more like zombies than vampires. The viewer can tell by their appearance, walk and speech that they are dead. Unlike the other vampire movies, the vampires remain in their human form (if you care to call it that) rather than transforming into bats. They are allergic to garlic rather than afraid of it. They are averse to mirrors, though they can see (as can the viewer) their reflections. The main character, Morgan, uses the garlic, mirrors, and crucifixes more like a shield. In Dracula, these same items almost seem to frighten the Count. A select group of those that have contracted the disease find a way to curb the affects of the illness in that they do not appear as the others do. They are able to function normally and are only mildly allergic to garlic.  The affect of crosses on this group obvious in the last scene of the movie where they are all gathered in a church in that they are not affected. None of those infected with the virus are required to sleep in coffins to regenerate, as do vampires in the other films, though they do sleep during the day and are very adverse to daylight. They are put down with a stake through the heart just like in the other films.
The differences in these movies are what made them appealing to movie audiences years ago. But there also needs to be an element of continuity to the characteristics of the monster. Constant changes and inconsistent distinctive qualities make the monster less believable. The different variations in each film kept the viewers interested and coming back for more. Dracula had the dashing gentleman who ""vanted to suck your blood."" The Last Man on Earth had vampire zombies who stalked the streets at night, calling for the only person left that was not already a member of their horde.",1083110400,,5547,4.547
853507,4,6304277385,"Well, let me start by saying that I don't own this exact DVD edition of the film.  I bought a set of movies called ""Horror Classics,"" and the back of the box said that it contained the Last Man on Earth, which it said was an old cheesy silent film from 1924.  When I put the disc in, much to my surprise, there was Vincent Price.
Upon watching this film I was very very pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere was extremely creepy, and the dialogue (even though most of it was Price's character, Robert Morgan, talking to himself) was amazing.  This film reminded me a lot of Night of the Living Dead, even though it was released 4 years earlier.  I love horror films about apocalyptic visions of earth, and this was one.  Props to Vincent Price for successfully carrying a large portion of this movie as the only character (for at least 20-ish minutes).
Don't let the apparent budgetary problems deter you from this film.  It was incredible and a very pleasant surprise.",1080691200,4,969,4.566473988439307
853508,5,6304277385,"So great, an ""OWN IT"" rating. The scenes, the mood, the story, the living dead..younger fans-dont let the name Vincent Price steer you clear from this movie, he is brilliant as the last surviving man after a world wide plague kills everyone. Now, so you will always trust my reviews, here is the only caveat, the ending...no matter how many times I watch it, I always get let-down with the ending..I always think it will change...now that's a good movie!!!!",1068854400,,457,4.725
853509,5,6304277385,"For $...- this film is an absolute steal for horror fans - and also for those who are fond of film symbolism.
The Bad
Obvious budget problems, some hooky dubbing voices, continuity errors such as having night and day appear in the same scene and some questionable acting. - But not by Vincent! Due to the flaws the film might elicit laughs by indiscriminate viewers. Just avoid watching the film with these types - we all know who they are.
The Good
The film has many noire elements: the despairing, unstable, confused loner, deserted streets, a voice over narration describing the inner world of the protagonist and a fem-fatale. The film takes place in a modern post apocatalypitc Las Angeles but there are abundant elusions to the dark ages of medieval Europe: spears as weapons, paranoia, fear of the supernatural, plague victims, wrong headed crusaders, and vehicles carrying the dead to be consumed by fiery pits. The story has all the plot points of a religious allegory and on top of all this it's a horror movie. There is an outstanding - one man show - performance by Price - Price plays his character as if he were a 120 year old man in a forty year old body- tired worn out frustrated, angry, depressed, moping, hunched shouldered and dug deeply into the worst nightmarish rut imaginable. His only activities are to go out by day and destroy former victims of the plague now turned into goulash vampires - By night he boards up his house and drinks himself into a stupor. The original story by ""I am Legend"" Richard Matheson was very good to begin with but the Last Man on Earth screenplay adds more symbolism, which gives the film additional depth. Much of the film is told in flash backs which reveal all the hero's errors in judgment. Last Man On Earth is a moody, dark, compelling nightmare.
This DVD version is from very good film stock My only complaint is that it apears as if the DVD may have been dubbed form a very good VHS print Other then this the film stock is almost flawless for an old movie- but know the film always had an appropriate gritty, documentary, black and white, look and sound.

Maybe the DVD does not deserve 5 stars but- but because of the films depth in story, Prices performance, pathos, intelligence and symbolism along with being a very good horror film ...! I cannot give this DVD anything but 5 starts. Absolutely no one who loves Vincent Price or, horror films should pass this up!",1067040000,7,2430,4.599078341013825
853510,4,6304277385,"Since so many others have already commented on this surprisingly good version of Richard Matheson's 'I Am Legend,' a few words on Madacy's DVD release. Madacy aren't exactly a byword for quality, and the low price had me expecting the worst, but the DVD transfer is surprisingly good - a clean 2.35:1 b&w transfer with few edge enhancement problems that you would expect to pay a lot more for. The only extras are a poster image, a few 50s schlock sci-fi trailers and an 'interactive quiz' that gets most of the answers completely wrong, but this is worth buying for the film alone, which is much better than its reputation would have you believe.
It also makes a fascinating comparison with Chuck's insanely enjoyable 'The Omega Man': 'The Last Man on Earth' may have less action, a much lower budget, a score considerably less funky than Ron Grainer's, and what looks like the suburbs around Rome's Cinecitta Studios standing in for the USA, but it offers a much more disturbing account of civilisation gradually breaking down around its powerless hero. And for anyone familiar with the remake, the even bleaker ending here is a real surprise. Recommended - it's not an all-time great, but it's well worth [money] of any sci-fi or horror fan's money.",1063670400,8,1252,4.8279069767441865
853511,4,6304277385,"Based on Richard Matheson's novel I AM LEGEND; LAST MAN ON EARTH is a sci-fi/horror/morality play starring the inimitable Vincent Price.
Price plays Dr. Robert Morgan; who as you'd guess by the title becomes the last man on Earth after the remainder of the World's population is wiped out by a virus he helped create. Wait, did I say last man? I actually mean last NORMAL man, because Morgan is hiding in isolation with ""vampires"" outside pining for his blood, because Morgan's own blood contains a special antibody that makes him immune to the virus. To keep from going mad; Morgan lives the past through his home movies and lives with the guilt that among the victims claimed by the virus were his wife and daughter.
This low budget US/Italian co-production predates George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD by four years, but doesn't get the full respect it deserves. In fact; I think LAST MAN ON EARTH is far superior, more intelligent and scarier than NOTLD. Bet you won't guess the twist in the tale.
This was later remade as THE OMEGA MAN with Charlton Heston (which I haven't seen yet) and several years back Arnie Schwarzenegger was to have starred in a remake which never saw the light of day. Despite being made four decades ago, LAST MAN ON EARTH can stand alongside other SF/horror classics like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL as one of the best genre movies of its era.",1057536000,4,1417,4.649402390438247
853582,5,6304277385,"The Last Man on Earth is based on Richard Matheson's incredible novel I Am Legend, in my opinion the second best vampire novel ever written.  Vincent Price does not really fit the image I had in mind from the novel, but there can be no doubt that he gives a remarkable performance here and makes the role his own.  It's a rather somber tale.  Price plays Morgan, a man left completely alone in the world by a plague that wiped out the rest of the population, including his wife and young daughter, three years earlier.  The virus behind the plague was a vampiric bacillus, so all of the people who died and were not destroyed by fire have come back as vampires.  Luckily for Morgan, the vampires are quite weak and simple-minded, for they attack his fortified home every night in an effort to get in and kill him.  By day, Morgan goes out hunting the walking nightmares and driving stakes through their hearts, but there are so many that the project seems almost futile.  Midway through the movie, we are treated to a pretty extended set of flashbacks to the early days of the virus and the deaths of Morgan's wife and daughter.  Toward the end, Morgan is shocked to find a woman wandering outside during the day, the first human being he has seen in three years.  He takes her home with him and thus sets the stage for the movie's memorable climax.
Obviously, Vincent Price carries this movie on his own back, given the fact that the vast majority of the action takes place around him and no one else.  He plays things rather subtly for the most part, which I found quite effective.  His memories make him laugh sometimes, but Price's signature laugh evolves quite effectively into sobs of anger and frustration.  The most poignant moments of the film, in my opinion, come when Morgan finds a dog outside his house, the first living creature he has seen in three years.  The dog initially runs away from him in fear, but the suffering creature eventually comes back.  Morgan cleans him and fixes up his wounds, but the new friendship he exults over soon becomes just another tragedy.  The movie doesn't dwell on the dog episode nearly so much as Matheson does in his novel, and for this I am grateful because I find it rather heartbreaking.  The little dog gives an incredible performance, but as is so often the case the canine actor does not even merit a mention in the credits.
The Last Man on Earth really is a remarkably good movie and really showcases the immense acting abilities of Vincent Price.  I wish it would have delved into the science of the virus much more intensely than it did; the scientific aspects of Matheson's story are what make it such a phenomenally good vampire novel.  The inner turmoil and chaotic nature of Morgan's thoughts cannot really be presented effectively on film, nor can the actions and motives of some of the other players in the drama be thoroughly understood.  The script writers did take some liberties with the concluding scenes, but it is really for the best because the novel's conclusion would not have worked in this medium without the audience being given a much more penetrating look into the minds and motives of the characters involved.  Some might find the movie creepy, but there is really nothing here that will disturb the timid viewer-the camera never actually shows any of the gruesome acts that tend to be committed by human beings against vampires and vice versa.  Somber and depressing as it can be, The Last Man on Earth is the type of distinguished horror movie that appeals in some way to just about everyone.",1043107200,60,3576,4.635499207606973
853583,5,6304277385,"Vincent Price gives his best performance as the last man on Earth. And what a bleak earth it is, one overcome by plague, death, and cold, and overrun by zombie-like vampires. The middle of the story goes back in time, as we see how he once was a happy family man, until the plague came about. Then he was a hardworking scientist desperatley trying to stop it. And finally he was a survivor, slowly being driven to madness by both his lonliness, and the fact that the undead creatures are outside his house every night, calling his name, and trying to get him. The viewer puts himself in Morgan's shoes, imagining what it would be like to live in such a bleak, cold world. The film is very depressing, as we see him slowly lose his family to the plague. His everyday routine is maddening in itself. He sharpens stakes, seeks out sleeping vampires, stakes them, and takes them to a horrible burning pit, reminicent of the ones dug during WW2 for the executed Jews. It was shot 3 years before Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"", and one can certainly see where Romero drew his inspiration, from the grainy black and white cinemotography, to the bleak storyline of the world coming to an end and being taken over by the dead. The vampires trying to break in Morgan's home at night are nearly identical to Romero's zombies, trying to get into the farmhouse. It contains many scary and disturbing images. The film is way ahead of its time, and on a shoestring budget, manages to be much scarier than any of the multimillion dollar so called ""horror"" that we are subject to today....highly recommended.",1036454400,4,1596,4.603508771929825
853584,4,6304277385,"Out of all the movies that show civilization in collapse, only a few stick to the brainpaths the way THE LAST MAN ON EARTH does. It was not a high budget movie, nor was it in color, and it had only one bankable star, Vincent Price, who played Morgan, the last man on earth.  What made this movie special was the often underrated acting of Vincent Price, a man who could inject pizzazz into any script better than anyone else.  In all of his dozens of film credits, Price manages to make you feel the pain that he does.  Even in his major lemons, he drags you out of your chair in your living room to grab your face and rub it in the slime that so often covered his writhing body.  In TLMOE, as he sees that his friends and family are dying en masse, he makes you see that too.  You learn to care about even his horribly bleak world.  Price plays Morgan, a scientist who somehow survives a superplague that wipes out the living, only to see some of them revive as the walking dead, vampires who exist only to bring him into their fold.  Director Sidney Salkow shot TLMOE in grainy black and white, a style that would later be copied in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  The vampires walk about only at night, seeking to bull their way into Morgan's heavily barricaded house.  During the day, he returns the favor by driving a stake through their respective hearts.  This is a perfectly ghastly, yet gripping tug of war.  Morgan, of course, cannot win.  The vampires vastly outnumber him.  At the end, he is cornered, shouting at them that he is human and they are not, and that is what gave him the right to play the reverse vampire with them.  He dies, believing in the nobility of his cause.  And it is precisely here, at the ending, that the movie's subtext speaks loud and clear: the 'rightness' of killing others only because of their differences has a variable definition based on who outnumbers whom.  Who would have thought that each time Morgan drove a stake through a sleeping vampire's heart, he was making a universal statement about human rights?",1026345600,4,2079,4.445910290237467

The show was a combination of bad movies (usually punctuated with our hero's overdubbed comments, dialog, and belches), TV show parodies, and blowing up models or his nemesis Froggy with M-80's or cherry bombs.  Vincent Price's ""Last Man On Earth"" was one of the films that received The Ghoul treatment but really was several cuts above most of the cinematic dreck featured on the show.  Based on the novel ""I Am Legend,"" the film ultimately went on to influence both ""The Omega Man"" and George Romero's ""Night Of The Living Dead.""  No self-respecting horror fan should be unfamiliar with the plot, which centers around the dead coming back to life to battle the living, in this case Price.

It was probably three or four years later that I saw the movie in its entirety.  Based pretty closely on Richard Matheson's novella ""I am Legend"" which is also a highly recommended read.  But again, it was the atmosphere, the loneliness, moodiness, and part plausibility of being a survivor of a horrible plague that has kept this movie forever imprinted in my mind.  Another scene, from the movie that stuck with me, was Morgan looking out his living room window onto a suburban street and seeing soldiers loading onto a truck a body with a crying woman beside them with the wind blowing and leaves flying around.

There are not any really frightening moments, but the film's slow, haunting, melancholic atmosphere more than makes up for that.  The dubbing and acting are sometimes awkward, and the direction is, at  best, uninspired. However, we plunge far deeper into the psychological  elements of being the last man on earth than 'The Omega Man' ever did. In  that film, the tragedy of the protaginist losing his wife and daughter to  the plague was completely omitted, a big mistake which did not help a movie  that was already tacky and ill-conceived. The premise of man being alone  against the new race of humans is also preserved in 'Last Man', whilst in  'Omega Man' we had an insane cult of hippie mutants.  Overall, 'Last Man'  is a flawed but fascinating flick, worth seeing for Vincent Price's one-man  performance and it's disturbing final scene.",953337600,14,943,4.980769230769231

7868885,1,6304277385,"Never liked Vincent Price in anything and still don't.  Weak adaptation of the book.  Will Smith movie ""I am Legend"" was much better.  Even Omega Man was better acted with Charlton Heston as the overly dramatic slayer come slayed. Just because a movie is 50+ years old and has a famous star in it does not mean it will be engaging.  VP should have stuck to Poe stories.",1525564800,,369,4.382352941176471
7868886,5,6304277385,"Yup.  That is what a movie should be.  Real acting.  Real plot.  Good ending.  And not endless blasphemy and F bombs, no senseless gore that
doesn't advance the plot, no silly secondary plots that conflict with the main plot, no flashing of breasts and nipples that do nothing except show
that the actress is mammalian (as if we couldn't guess that), and all supported by decent photography and direction.

Watching one of these old
gems it makes one sad to realize what has been lost and replaced with flashy explosions, car chases, frontal nudity, gun battles and splashing blood, and rehashed vengeance plots so common they have to be numbered.",1525305600,2,647,4.836363636363636
7868887,1,6304277385,"This is the first film adaptation of Richard Matheson's original (rather weak) 1954 novel, ""I Am Legend,"" about the last uncontaminated human being in a plague/vampire/mutant-ridden world.

""The Last Man On Earth,"" while pretty weak in its own right, is still the adaptation closest to the plot and characters of the Matheson novel.  It's far closer than later adaptations, such as 1971's ""The Omega Man"" and 2007's ""I Am Legend,"" and it has a similar vibe to 1968's ""Night of the Living Dead"" (which was also inspired by the Matheson novel).

Like the book, ""The Last Man on Earth"" is a slow, grim, plodding affair with flashbacks of happier times in the pre-plague era.  While its adherence to Matheson's original, lethargic story may be admirable, in a sense, that's also the film's greatest pitfall.

Vincent Price plays a softer, more human character in this movie than in any of his other movies, but it's still the famously-sinister Vincent Price...which is a good thing on the one hand and not such a good thing on the other.  A less-stereotyped actor may have been a better choice for the lead role.

The original film was shot in black & white, colorized only much later, and that's another weak point...all the color looks like muted duotone, kind of a sickly bluish pink.

Beyond all that, the action is incredibly lame.  Vincent Price fighting for his life against zombie hoardes and ""new society"" mutants looks more like an protracted girlscout pillow fight.  Price wasn't known for his action sequences; in this film, he simply just shoves the zombies away, three and four at a time, throwing fake punches that plainly never connect.  When he needs to throw tear-gas bombs at his pursuers, he basically just drops the bombs on the ground at his own feet and then runs.  Quite pathetic.

It would be accurate to say that ""The Last Man on Earth"" is the truest adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel, which is THE source of the entire zombie-apocalypse genre that we're still enduring today.  So, if you ever get your hands on a time machine, go back to 1954 and convince Matheson NOT to write this story, which should erase this film and all the subsequent zombie nonsense from the pages of history.  Do us all a favor.",1520294400,4,2232,4.776041666666667
