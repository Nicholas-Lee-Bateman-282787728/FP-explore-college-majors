2117987,5,B0002SPPYQ,The Boys are rocking on this DVD. I've watched it so many times and I'm still not tired of it. I'm a big fan of Stevie Ray Vaughn and its good to see somebody else coming up to take over where Stevie Ray left off. Excellent DVD!!,1096761600,,229,3.893617021276596
2117988,5,B0002SPPYQ,"Excellent new band. This is a keeper. The song ""Heaven"" is the leading song here.",1095984000,6,81,4.466666666666667
2117989,5,B0002SPPYQ,"This is a great performence done by the Los Lonely Boys live from Austin Texas-texican style. Their are a collection of songs from The Los Lonely Boy's debut album including Senorita, Crazy Dream, Dime Mi Amor, Nobody Else, and many more. The Los Lonely Boys also perform some songs that where not included on their album like Supper Time, and End Of A New Begginning with a excellent performence. This whole DVD runs 96 mins and includes some bonus features as well. The bonus features include Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, Photo Gallery, and a Behind The Scences Bonus Documentaries. Yes...they do perform their hit single Heaven as well as Onda, Hollywood, and Velvet Sky. I recomend this to all of the Los Lonely Boy fans, as well as the early listener's. Enjoy!!!!",1095552000,12,773,4.819548872180451
2117990,5,B0002SPPYQ,"For those of you who have never seen or heard Los Lonely Boys (is there anyone in that group?), you are going to be impressed, amazed, and entertained as you've not been for a long, long time.

For the rest of us, whether live concert goers or radio or CD listeners, this DVD will hold the surprises of songs that we've not had ready access to.  'I Am The Man To Beat' is a scorcher, with Henry adding his harp (harmonica) skills to the song.  'Supper Time' is a hoot - with Henry and Ringo kazoo-ing while Jojo plays Henry's guitar.  And while the ECD includes 'End Of A New Beginning', it is so much better here.  The rest of the tracks are on the ECD, but these live versions, with slight variations, will allow you to connect with these three artists as you watch them play.  I was lucky enough to be at Auditorium Shores that night - but my view of the boys was nowhere near as good as what you get on the DVD.

And if that was not enough, the extras will let you see these young men up close.  Take a tour of San Angelo, Texas, guided by Jojo and Ringo.  See shots from the tour (Hollywood) as well as a photo gallery.

Get ready to have a great time!",1095465600,7,1157,4.102222222222222
2117991,5,B0002SPPYQ,"You know, Los Lonely Boys's self-titled platinum debut is a great album, one that harkens back to the days of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Duane Allman. But as great as that album is, this is where LLB does their best: in front of their loyal and rapid Loopies and Lonlies. Here, we find the boys playing in front of 25,000 people in their musical hometown, Austin, Texas, during the SXSW festival. They play a great set, and are full of energy. Even on the slower songs, it makes you nod your head. This shows that they are truly one of the best bands to come out in the new millenium. Also, the bonus features are really hilarious and interesting. From Henry's Sean Connery impression to Ringo's meeting of his third-grade teacher, they continue to entertain, even without the instruments. This band is going to be a band that is around for a long time to come. (...)",1095379200,8,863,4.503184713375796
2117992,5,B0002SPPYQ,"I've had the Los Lonely Boys debut CD since it came out. I was excited to see that they were releasing a live DVD.  I knew that they were good musicians from listening to the CD, but I was blown away by the vocal harmony and musicianship on this DVD.  They are much more that just the band that sings the song ""Heaven"".  I have a feeling that these guys are gonna be around for a long long time.",1095206400,4,395,3.9746835443037973
2118003,2,B0002SPPYQ,"...and it's a BIG problem. Who in their right mind is still making DVDs in which the picture is matted to fit a 4x3 screen? What this means for those of you with 16x9 televisions is that the concert is presented as a ""box within a box."" It is NOT anamorphic widescreen. Sure, you can tweak your TV's settings to force it to appear anamorphic, but you will lose a lot of resolution in doing so, and the image will look fuzzy and pixelated.

I should have read the fine print. But then again, 16x9 TVs have been in the market for over 15 years, and anamorphic widescreen DVDs have been available since s the introduction of DVD technology in the late 90s, so I've been conditioned to believe that most DVD authoring was done properly...

The most memorable moment on this DVD is when the bass and guitarist swap and play each others instruments while holding thier own guitars... Well worth the purchase... In fact, my musician buddies stole my DVD, so I had to purchase this one to replace it... lol",1305158400,,476,4.534883720930233
2118024,5,B0002SPPYQ,"This is a fantastic concert by Grammy Award winning, Los Lonely Boys. This is a band of brothers: Henry Garza, Jojo Garza, & Ringo Garza. This concert was filmed live at Auditorium Shores, Austin, Texas, U.S.A., on March 20, 2004. It has an approximate running time of 96 minutes.

Henry Garza, the lead electric,guitar player must have been influenced by the late/great Stevie Ray Vaughan. This guitar playing style sounds kinda like Stevie Ray, plus, he performs ""tricks"" with his guitar, like Stevie Ray did, like playing it behind his back. Plus, he and one of his brothers, Jo Jo, both play the guitar together like Stevie Ray & his brother Jimmy Vaughan did. Jo Jo sings most, but not all of the lead vocals.

Overall, you get Henry on lead electric guitar,  another brother, Jo Jo on electric bass guitar, (and he has some ""tricks"" of his own with his bass guitar, he sings most of the vocals), and then you get the other brother, Ringo on drums. So, you get a ""Power Trio"". These guys play their hearts out!!!

There are times when they just improvise, and jam on and on, spontaneously. The crowd loves it!!!!

Also, the packed crowd is really, really into this one. These guys played on the last day of the New Orleans Jazz Fest back in 2005, but I missed their performance.
However, this concert dvd certainly makes up for it. This concert is totally ""awesome"", just look at all the 5 stars ratings they have recreived.

The song set:
1. Intro of the Los Lonely Boys
2. Crazy Dream
3. Dime Mi Amor
4. Nobody Else
5. Velvet Sky
6. Man to Beat
7. Onda
8. Supper Time
9. Hollywood
10. Real Emotions
11. Senorita
12. Heaven (This was their biggest hit, Henry sings this one, their live performace of it, is totally awesome, it sounds like the studio version, & the version that was played extensively on CMT, back when it was a hit, and in this live concert, it sounds even better, you get an extended version of it. Henry's electric guitar playing is phenonmenal.)

Encore Performance: (The Crowd just won't let them leave.)
13. An Outstanding Extended Instrumental, with all kinds of guitar ""tricks"", bass guitar ""tricks"", spontaneous improvisions, Henry plays the guitar behind his back, like the late/great Stevie Ray did. It's totally awesome!!!! Words just don't do it justice.

Bonus Material: Behind the Scences & Documentaries.

This is a Great One, and I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!!",1275004800,,2402,4.7
2118025,5,B0002SPPYQ,"This is the most amazing DVD. After seeing them in concert recently and reading other reviews, I just had to try this DVD. Reminded me all over again how incredible these guys are live. In fact, we are having a party tonight with friends who are fans that want to see this DVD. We are not DVD buyers, we usually rent, but the few we have are concert DVDs and this one lives up to its reputation.",1216166400,,395,4.142857142857143
2118026,5,B0002SPPYQ,"Discovered by Willie Nelson, these amazing brothers were all under the age of 26 when this video was shot. They won numerous awards during SXSW including band of the year. The video was shot the last day of SXSW when the band of the year traditionally plays the concluding concert on Saturday.

They are without a doubt my favorite band and Henry's incredible talent has helped smooth over the early loss of my all time hero Stevie Ray Vaughan. It's almost like SRV is being channeled through him.

Their new CD 'Unforgiven' will be out in July. Henry, the oldest is only 29 now so these brothers have a lot of 'blues' left to pump out. Jo Jo is an amazing (6 string) bass player and plays an incredible guitar as well.
Get everything they have on CD or Video and most importantly go see them live. They have fun on stage and leave you yearning for more. They have an amazing fan club 'La Onda' with a huge following. They're humble, spiritual and family oriented.

Be sure and check out some of the Austin area bands that warm up for them, like Del Castillo and The Tex Mex Experience. Also check out Vallejo, another Austin favorite. You won't be disappointed! They all have MySpace Pages, including Los Lonely Boys!",1212537600,,1218,4.527272727272727
2118027,5,B0002SPPYQ,I thought this was a great all around DVD concert. Excellent music and picture. If you like these guys you cant go wrong with this DVD.,1198454400,,135,4.230769230769231

another.  I love this DVD.",1171584000,,96,4.277777777777778
2118029,5,B0002SPPYQ,Los Lonely Boys have what it takes to go from rock band to rock legend. Their vocal harmonies are captivating and they can play! I would recomend buying everything they have done.,1168732800,,179,4.625
2118030,5,B0002SPPYQ,"I was introduced to LLB by a family member who knew I played some guitar. They actually bought me this DVD before I'd even heard of them - knowing that I'd like it.  I watched this DVD and was blown away. These guys are first and foremost great musicians and almost as importantly...they are great entertainers.  Since then, I've bought their debut album, Live at the Fillmore and Sacred. I also saw them live in the summer 2005. That summer, I saw the Eagles, Eric Clapton and LLB...the first three real concerts I'd ever been to.  Me and my wife say hands down that LLB was by far the best concert of the three.  These guys get the crowd going with their musicianship, honesty and energy.  They don't rely on who they are, they are there to play great music and to entertain and they seem to have a lot of fun doing it.

This DVD captures their live show pretty well. It's pretty much the same set that they played when I saw them.  It's amazing how ""full"" they sound with only three guys. Crazy Dream is an attention-getting intro. Of course Heaven is in there. Watch these guys bring down the house as they end the show with End of a New Beginning...this set rocks.  If you have surround sound, turn it up full blast and prepare to dance on your living room floor. Henry can play the Strat like he was born with it. You can hear the Stevie Ray Vaughn influences (they are from Texas) in his playing.  JoJo is an awesome bassist,  very technical but he also has a ton of fun improvising up there. Ringo is the glue that holds it all together and he is just as good of a drummer as his brothers are on their axes.  And all three can SING...their harmonies are tight. Their harmonies set them apart from other groups of today. This is not an MTV generation band, this is real music...Everyone from my grandparents to my children can listen to them and enjoy.  You even have Willie Nelson proclaiming them as his favorite band.

The Tex/Mex Rock/Blues of LLB is an awesome sound.  Buy the DVD to really see what they are about. I have several concert DVD's (Eagles, Clapton, Johnny Cash) and this one tops them as far as entertainment value. Their albums are great but seeing them live is the only thing that does them justice.  And they are ten times better in person.

P.S...some people have mentioned the editing. I didn't even notice it until I read the reviews here.  I don't think the cuts are excessive and I think they actually add to the feel of the DVD. Think of the camera as focusing in on what you would be concentrating on in the concert.",1163894400,3,2552,4.372881355932203
2118031,5,B0002SPPYQ,"Since I am a great fan of Los Lobos and everything Pacheco, I can't believe that no one ever recommended this DVD to me!  Being three brothers certainly has helped them forge together a very tight band.

Maybe not so much in this performance but on later songs, I even hear a strong influence of Man&aacute;, my favorite Puerto Rican rock group.  (I hear the Police coming through Man&aacute;.)

Even though you can hear influences, they manage to form their own distinctive performance style.  I especially love the way JoJo and Henry dance together while playing.",1155513600,,565,4.84375
2118032,5,B0002SPPYQ,"Take the spirit and styles of Los Lobos, Carlos Santana, and Stevie Ray, boil them down and put thiem into the bodies of three talented, and very energetic young brothers, and you have Los Lonely Boys. These crown princes of Southern rock look like they have been playing together for 20 years, and don't let their youthful apperances fool you, they are serious musicians. The above-mentioned mentors should be proud of their creation...",1128556800,5,437,5.0
2118043,5,B0002SPPYQ,"These three young men from Texas are the link between great music of the past and the best of today and tomorrow.  Extremely capable on their guitars and drums, they can also sing. Their lyrics also indacte that they have given thought to the purpose of life and realize that life is a journey which everyone undertakes.",1124409600,3,320,4.614035087719298
2118044,4,B0002SPPYQ,"This is the first concert DVD from LLB, one that will probably be the first among many to come. Keep your eye on this band 'cause I think these west Texas boys are going to go a long way.

The concert, as concert DVDs are concerned, was a good solid rock/blues concert. Yes, as others have said there are some editing problems, but I do not think the poor editing takes away from the overall quality of the show.

All their songs from their first debut album are present, and there are a few jams sessions between certain songs, and some different arrangements on several tunes. The sound quality is not the best compared to other concert DVDs I've reviewed or seen, but the show was fantastic. These guys have a great quality about their song writing, and these songs are their first real big efforts. I can't even imagine how much better their skills will be after two or three albums from now.

If you have never heard Los Lonely Boys but you like Stevie Ray Vaughan, Carlos Santana, or Ritchie Valens/Buddy Holly type music, then you will really like LLB. In many of their tunes they pay tribute to their musical heroes.

This DVD contains extra footage of the band, their families, where they grew up (San Angelo Texas - just south of where I grew up) and a few fun home videos and pics of the band. While this is not the best quality DVD, it is still well worth the money paid. I proudly recommend this DVD, and their debut CD as well.",1120435200,11,1441,4.385767790262173
2118045,4,B0002SPPYQ,"I'm a big LLB fan, but too bad this was shot on film and not video. This really detracts from the feel of a real live show, and way too many overdubs. They cleaned up the sound a little too much in the studio. In the first song Crazy Dream, what's up with that ""effect"" when Henry's soloing, what are they trying to mask or hide? That's just one example of what I'm talking about, the scenes are truly dizzying as other reviewers' have noted. Maybe they'll get it right next time. BTW, I'll take an old fashioned unedited bootleg shot on video any day over this.",1117756800,5,562,4.261682242990654
2118046,5,B0002SPPYQ,"Music is great but the video editing has made it a lot less personal than it could have been.  Some concerts are theatrical like David Bowie's and quick pace editing with full use of lights, colors camera techniques and angles are appropriate but these guys would have come off a LOT better had this DVD been done at Austin City Limits.  Instead, its a very inappropriate MTV style video that detacts from their rich harmonies and fantastic musicianship.  They would come across much better in a smaller setting with the cameras capturing more of them as personalities rather than flash images.  Still its very enjoyable and I wouldn't think of taking away a star because of the MTV nonsense even though this would be a staggeringly good DVD if done in a warmer more personal way.",1104710400,6,780,4.713235294117647
2118047,5,B0002SPPYQ,"If you can tolerate the rapid fire editing (197 cuts in the first song alone), you'll love this DVD.  I understand the need to make things visually interesting, but this is getting ridiculous.  Can't we just watch the band play for more than 2 seconds?  This DVD may end up being one of the ones I enjoy more with the TV off. Even with the distracting visuals, it still rates 5 stars on the strength of the music alone.",1103932800,6,419,4.2784810126582276
2118048,5,B0002SPPYQ,"Drop it into E flat and bang that wood hard brother; there is nothing more beautiful then the sound of a well played Stratocaster.  This is a fine performance in front of a home crowd featuring three talented brothers calling themselves Los Lonely Boys.  Not a weak tune in the bunch, this is a nice set of varied music ranging from hard Texas blues to Mexican rockers to playful ditties spanning about 90 minutes or so.  Oh, and ya, the pop-blues rocker ""Heaven"" is included.  While there is really no standout solo vocalist, the Garza brothers blend their Texas and Mexican heritage in fine order and offer up some great harmonies in the process.  Comparisons to SRV are not surprising as Henry has clearly spent more then a few hours with an SRV CD or two.  However, unlike myriad of SRV wannabes out there, Henry is a talented guitar player with a style and tone all his own.  All three brothers are fine musicians and play off each other as if they have been playing together their whole life ;-)  Excellent sound and picture quality.

Since SRVs premature passing, Texas blues has been in wanting of some new blood.  Henry, Jojo, and Ringo are the real deal.",1100822400,23,1164,4.579710144927536
2118049,5,B0002SPPYQ,"Live from Austin, TX, the best concert I've seen in at least 10 years. Solid, Fun, Rock. I have been hooked on their music since I got the CD. When I saw this DVD at the store I immediately grabbed it. It is better than I could have even hoped.

I had heard that they were better live, but Wow, I had no idea I would be so impressed. Henry's guitar solos blew me away! My husband thinks the spirit of Jimi Hendrix has returned. He is the best I've seen since SRV. I love the songs that aren't on the CD. On ""Man to Beat"" Henry plays a little harmonica, it is excellent. Then on ""Suppertime"" you get to see JoJo play guitar while Henry and Ringo sing and play kazoo.  The group is tight and their harmonies are excellent. One of my favorite parts on the DVD is when Henry and JoJo both play Henry's guitar at the same time. There are no pyrotechnics or flashy special effects because simply put, LLB doesn't need them. Austin Music Awards Band of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Rock Band, and Bass Player of the Year.

I have introduced almost 30 of my friends to LLB music and they all love it, you probably will too. You have got to see these boys play. They will amaze you.",1100044800,10,1196,4.124463519313305
2118050,5,B0002SPPYQ,"The above quote is from a music critic who attended LLB's concert at the 2004 SXSW annual MusicFest, where the band swept the awards given.  The quote has become the unofficial anthem of Texans, who've known about LLB for a long time and are now thrilled to share this unique sound with the world. This sound is from 3 brothes in their 20's.  They seem much older and more mature than their ages, undoubtedly from being on the road doing gigs with their family since they were 8 yrs. old.  You will be convinced that you are hearing 10+ musicians! They aptly proclaim their sound as ""Texican Rock 'n Roll.""

Several  CD's of their music are out now, all available at Amazon, which showcases this Band's talents.  The DVD is icing on the cake, because it's like a viewer is right there on the front row of an LLB concert. In fact, I have been on the front row of their live concerts. Once you are there, you will want to attend again and again!  The crowds are massive, always, so be sure to get there very early for good viewing. It is well worth the wait!

Los Lonely Boys have the combined sound of the really great ones we've heard and bought records by for many years: Buddy Holly, Richie Valens, Santana, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Jimi Hendrix, ZZ Top, War, the Beatles, Elvis, the Stones, Waylon and Willie, plus some soul, R&B, Texas blues, hard rock, new country, and old-fashioned rock and roll mixed in--all the sounds which made musical history because there was simply no one else that good at the time.  And of course, LLB adds the Latino sound just so we know they'll never forget their roots and original fan base.  LLB has named this delicious salad of sounds ""the Musical Burrito Theory.""  So accurate!  In their own words, they've taken the sounds of the greats they were raised on all their lives, mixed those sounds together with their own style, and have created a Musical Burrito.  One they hope the world will hear, enjoy and want more of.

If you can attend a concert anywhere in the US, do it! You will never regret or forget it.  Until then, buy this DVD and their other CD's to learn about and know their sound whenever you hear it, even if you can't see their faces.  Like Elvis, Buddy, Richie, Stevie Ray, Hendrix, the Beatles, and all the other greats, LLB has the ""IT"" factor.  You know they're the music of the Melinnium we've been waiting for, and there is no one else that good.",1098576000,15,2405,4.454337899543379
2118051,5,B0002SPPYQ,"South by SW is an annual happening in Austin Texas. The concluding Saturday of every SXSW festival has a free concert lakeside in downtown Austin. This year the headliners were Los Lonely boys from nearby San Angelo, Texas.

I actually had no idea they had national renown until I turned on the Latin Grammy's and saw them with Santana. This has most of their songs from the debut album and some excellent muscianship. Fans of the album will not be disappointed at all.

I especially like Hollywood, Nobody Else, and Heaven is great. There are a number of extended guitar solos, drumming, jamming, and a few drum solos. Even some harmonica and gazoo playing.

The extras are nice if not that long. The best by far is the look at their hometown of San Angelo and going back to their old schools and homes. Anyone who likes their music will be pleased to have this in their collection. And unlike movie videos this can be viewed and enjoyed over and over and over with no lose of enjoyment. Those of you elsewhere go and see them if you get a chance. I was out of town for this concert so it is nice that I get to see what I missed that night.",1097107200,26,1141,4.347417840375587

The band are as tight as anything, the crowd are loving every second and you've got to give it up for the actual shooting of the video itself.
