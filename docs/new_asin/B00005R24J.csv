1654345,4,B00005R24J,"Another 70's cannibal flick, this is much better than expected.  You've got the hot, scantily-clad Ursula Andress and her crew on a quest through the jungles of New Guinea.  They get ambushed by some blood thirsty savages of course.  This tribe looks extremely heinous.  Their masks are what really stood out for me in this movie--some dirty, potato sack looking bags with holes cut out for the eyes.  Freaky!  When the maniacal tribe leader sees Ursula, he might develop a different kind of hunger.
You've got all your basic cannibal flick essentials--blood, gore, decapitations, nudity, violence with animals.  The acting and dialogue are good enough not to hamper the story.  It may not be extremely original, but hey, if it ain't broke...",1209859200,12,742,5.024590163934426

1654347,4,B00005R24J,"Like many Italian directors, Sergio Martino was a genre jumper, having directed such multi Oscar winning films like Torso, Mannaja, Your Vice Is A Locked Room And Only I Have The key, 2019: After the Fall of New York and The Big Alligator River.  Tis only natural he'd take a crack at the popular cannibal movie craze.  Mountain of the Cannibal God isn't the best the subgenre has to offer, but it isn't the worst, and like Judas Priest, it delivers the goods.  It follows a small group roaming around an island on a search for a supposedly cursed mountain.  Stacy Keach, Claudio Cassinelli, Ursula Andress, Andress' snooty brother and a few natives are the victims...er...explorers.  Each has their own reasons for wanting to find the mountain, but the whole expedition begins when Ursula  lands in New Guinea and requests Keach's help to find her husband who has been missing in the jungle for the past few months.  But is she really on the up and up?  Of course she isn't, or else I wouldn't have asked that dumb question.  Much of the film is spent trekking and trudging through the jungle and overcoming various perils which include bickering, snakes, alligators, stock footage, waterfalls, cannibal attacks and booby traps(of all kinds, if you catch my drift).  There's little bits of gore sprinkled throughout, but the real cannibal carnage doesn't actually begin until the last half hour or so of the film.  Some might find this kinda boring and disappointing, but honestly I was never bored.  Once we get to the mountain and meet the feared tribe, things do get pretty messed up.  Not on a Cannibal Holocaust level or anything, but enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen.  There's one shot during a kind of mini orgy that is definitely original and will probably stick in your mind for awhile.  Believe me, you'll know it when you see it, and damn if it's not funny!  Really, it's not a bad film at all if you're into this sort of thing.  It is viewed by many fans as one of the lesser films in the genre, but I've definitely seen much worse.  I like it quite a bit actually.  One thing you shouldn't miss out on is the 13 minute interview with Sergio Martino.  Talk about funny!  Most of it is straightforward talk of the film, but the documentary catches him in not one, but two blatant lies!  The first involves a scene of animal snuff(prevalent to Italian jungle movies of the time).  The scene was of a snake with a monkey in it's mouth(a rather sad image when you see it in the film).  Martino makes it sound as though it was just an unfortunate accident and coincidence that that particular shot was filmed.  However, the documentary shows you how a bad optical trick was used to cover up the shot of a person shoving the monkey into the snake's mouth!!  Martino also mentions how there were no erotic images in the film, and that statement is immediately followed by a rapid fire montage of all of the nude/sex scenes in the film.  This is really funny and makes Martino look either like a man who's lost his memory or a really bad liar.  If you like the cannibal stuff, then you should have a good time with Mountain Of The Cannibal God.",1202601600,6,3161,4.546902654867257
1654348,4,B00005R24J,"A woman (Ursula Andress) and her doctor friend (Stacy Keach) with a crew head into the jungles of New Guiena in search of her missing husband. While they explore the jungle, they discover a tribe of wild cannibals that want them all for dinner at the mysterious mountain of Ra-Rami to appease the cannibal god.

Violent and sleazy Italian horror adventure movie in the tradition of ""Indiana Jones"" but pre-dates that and from the director of ""Torso"" Sergio Martino. The acting is above average and the storyline is a bit paperthin but this is a shocking movie about cannibalism especially with gory scenes like castration, flesh-eating and of course scenes of animals actually getting killed such as a lizard getting gutted while it's alive and a Monkey being devoured as it screams in a Anaconda's mouth, definitely not stuff for animal lovers. Ms. Andress whom you might know from some James Bond movies and a few issues of 70's Playboy magazines is quite attractive in this movie, this isn't a film for the squeamish but it's very enjoyable.

The DVD here from Anchor Bay which Blue Underground is re-issuing this november contains a very good widescreen transfer with good sound and some nice extras like an interview with the director, trailer, bios and Poster-and-still gallery.

1654349,3,B00005R24J,"Sergio Martino's ""Slave of the Cannibal God"" is this director's entry in what ranks as one of the most fascinating horror sub-genres to ever grace the screen: the Italian cannibal craze. Starting in the early 1970s and peaking towards the end of the decade, a slew of depraved, ultragory shockers emerged from the minds of such Italian filmmakers as Ruggero Deodato and Umberto Lenzi. ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" Deodato's grindhouse shocker and a film still considered to be one of the sickest ever made, marked the apogee of the cannibal film, but other directors continued to churn out more product. I could, and probably am, wrong in saying this, but by the time Umberto Lenzi released ""Eaten Alive"" in 1980, the cannibal genre was declining. Watching these films proves one immutable truth about the 1970s: this decade truly was a time when filmmakers would try anything to shake audiences up. It's impossible to even conceive of a film like this being made today unless you take into consideration the plethora of super cheap shot on video junk, which I don't. These are films shot on film, and they are definitely something to see. If you like horror pictures, be sure to check a few of these gutmunchers out. Especially since most of them have gone to DVD in the past couple of years.

Martino's film stars Ursula Andress (!) as Susan Stevenson, the wife of an intrepid explorer who went in search of a tribe of cannibals and never returned. Stevenson, concerned for the safety of her husband, begins to organize a search party. She hires Doctor Edward Foster (Stacy Keach!) to guide the expedition into the jungles of New Guinea. Susan brings along her shady brother Arthur (Antonio Marsina) to help in the search, and the group sets off with the requisite number of local guides. What follows is, sadly, a rather boring series of scenes consisting of the group endlessly tramping their way through the foliage. In true cannibal movie fashion, we do get to see several scenes of real life animal death spliced into the film stock, but we must wait awhile to see the human characters perish under nasty circumstances. Between the snake attacks on monkeys and other such useless rubbish, Foster and Stevenson stumble over a village in the interior where the group meets a European priest running a mission, and learns about a dangerous tribe of cannibals called the Puka or Puki. Keach has a run in with a couple of these guys, so the party heads back into the jungle for another interminable jaunt until they arrive at the cannibal mountain.

Stevenson gets what she wants when her expedition runs smack dab into a tribe of masked cannibals atop this mountain. We see that her husband is here too, although he's quite dead and covered in some sort of weird jelly substance. It turns out that the tribe worships this corpse as a deity, probably due to the fact that he carried a Geiger counter when he stumbled over the cannibals. This tribe is so impressed with the machine that they mounted it in his chest, where it still clicks and clacks away all these months later. Since Susan's hubby carried a picture of her in his wallet, the cannibals think she's a god too. They strip her clothes off and tie her up just as they did her husband. Finally, we see a bit of the violence that are these films' stock and trade: one of the tribal members attempts to have his way with Goddess Ursula and pays an extreme price for his insolence. A dwarf has his brains dashed out on a rock, the cannibals sit around for some good old-fashioned eating, and startling revelations about Stevenson's reasons for coming to the mountain emerge before the film glides to a watery end.

""Slave of the Cannibal God"" is bound to disappoint hardcore followers of the cannibal sub-genre due simply to the fact that Martino restrained himself in the gore department. If you've seen ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""Eaten Alive,"" you won't believe how tame this film is by comparison. Nothing much happens except for animal violence and the flurry of activity at the end. Sure, we see a couple of native guys buy the farm during a leg of the trek, and dinnertime at the mountain took on decidedly queasy dimensions, but it's not enough to keep us gorehounds interested. I suspect with a cast including Andress and Keach, Martino felt he should throttle back on the extreme gore. Too bad and too sad. I did take pleasure in seeing Ursula bare her heart and soul in preparation for her deification ceremony, and I enjoyed seeing Keach turn in a solid performance. I also liked the beautiful shots of the jungle and that waterfall the expedition had to climb to get to the cannibal lair. ""Slave of the Cannibal God"" succeeded in one central element common to this sub-genre, namely that Europeans in the jungle are only there to engage in evil acts. I thought Martino pulled off this plot point--revealed in full at the end--quite nicely. But I must doggedly return to the central premise of an Italian cannibal picture: it should contain over the top gore, and Martino's effort failed in that area big time.

Surprisingly, the DVD edition of the film contained a thirteen-minute interview with Sergio Martino. The other extra was a poster and stills gallery. Picture and audio quality were sharp for a film this old. Ultimately, I must recommend that ""Slave of the Cannibal God"" is a film best suited for newcomers who wish to understand the general themes involved in these movies. Then move on to Deodato's and Lenzi's pukers. Since I already saw ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" ""Cannibal Ferox,"" and ""Eaten Alive"" before Martino's effort, this film left me wanting more.",1097107200,8,5629,4.776180698151951
1654350,4,B00005R24J,"Mountain of the Cannibal God, is basic, exploitation/sexploitation cannibal fare. It is an interesting story of sexy Ursula Andress, looking for her lost husband, and a trip she takes into the Amazon to find him, and the Uranium he was originally looking for. The safari party is eventually captured on the mountain (more like a cavern) by said cannibals, and Ursula is turned into a goddess, while the cannibals feast on human and reptile flesh. In this uncut version, there is a scene of sexual depravity on the first night of Ursula's capture that must be seen to be believed. First, Ursula is stripped, tied up, and sensuously painted by two native girls. Then we cut to a scene of a woman mastrubating while a native rapes a pig? Okay, I didn't write this stuff, I am only reviewing the film. Not exactly my cup of tea, I would have rather seen a love scene between Ursula and the male lead, but thats just me. Still, with a title like MOTCG, one cannot expect the memoirs of Emily Post.",1035158400,5,992,4.5474860335195535

1654381,5,B00005R24J,"After various scenes of wildlife, and a disclaimer, MOUNTAIN OF THE CANNIBAL GOD (aka: SLAVE OF THE CANNIBAL GOD- 1978) begins. Susan Stevenson (Ursula Andress) arrives in New Guinea, in search of her husband, Henry, who vanished during an expedition. Accompanied by her brother, Arthur Weisser (Antonio Marsina), Susan seeks the help of Professor Edward Foster (Stacy Keach), who agrees to assemble a native team and get them to the mysterious island where Henry disappeared. This takes them deep into the jungle, through treacherous waters, to the legendary mountain of the title. Along the way, several animals are slaughtered by several methods for several reasons. Mostly though, it's for the sake of pure exploitation! This unnecessary, all-too-real carnage, of course, was all the rage in such films as this during the late 70's / early 80's, becoming quite ""trendy"". Bizarre, almost pornographic in nature, I never get used to it. Anyway, over time, the group realizes that they're being pursued, especially when they start being killed off one by one. Assisted by a man named Manolo (Claudio Cassinelli), Foster, Susan, and Arthur are able to rest at a nearby village. Unfortunately, the tribe that's on their trail are cannibals, and have special plans for Susan! Forced to leave the village, the adventure kicks into high gear as the four trek on. Death and skulduggery occur, as they get ever closer to the the film's incredible, insane finale. In spite of its flaws, I prefer MOTCG to similar films, including CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, which it predates. Ms. Andress is unforgettable!

Stacy Keach does all right but for the most part the only reason to continue watching was for Ursula. iShe is always watchable especially for the male population.  The video and audio weren't up to the standards of most of the movies I have bought through Amazon.",1389398400,,395,4.628571428571429

It is hard to defend a film such as this--there is actually a scene of bestiality that I pray was simulated--but overall, it's not anymore gross or hard to take than the mainstream Hollywood idiot-themed mess. I suppose there's something to say for the filmmakers's chutzpah--but for God's sake, do we need that awful, wretched, wigged out music to accompany our depravity watching? The extra on the disc includes an interview with the director in which he explains movies such as this as being ""counter-educational""--now what that means in a movie where native weirdos are flaying open an alligator only to make a quick repast out of him is repulsive enough to educate one against skinning and eating alligators from there after, so I suppose that's educational enough. I should hate this movie because of its savagery, its endangerment of animals, and its overlong running time...but it's so weird, and the X-rated cut is collectible, so it's hard to get too enraged. And also, I'm a fan of Stacy Keach, so while this isn't ""The Ninth Configuration"" it's at least a rare film in the Keach catalogue (he probably regrets being in it now, since he's recording audio versions of the Bible!).",1389225600,7,1271,4.916279069767442

This film is not for weak-stomachs or queasy tendencies. It's one boring adventure after another and has Absolutely no intense, or suspenseful moments. It's very problematic but Ursula Andress' beauty is stunning.

I did not enjoy the many drudging obstacles the characters encountered in the jungle and thought the Andress' role was very unconvincing. She was so irksome amongst the dangers of the jungle and looked like a dull diamond, although she had been captured by the wearisome Cannibals. A key scene, I might add, where she is stripped down and forced to participate in cannibal acts, is hot.

Just a word of warning: There is some pretty severe animal torture and death in the film. One scene where they rip a live iguana open, and another close up of the face of a monkey slowly dying in the jaws of a croc - it was on-and-on and the monkey was tossed into the jaws of a croc by the Italian film crew.

The new Anchor Bay DVD has some inserted new scenes, most notably a cannibal raping a pig, and it is VERY graphic and offensive.

Live lizards being cut apart piece by piece, a snake gorging on a live monkey with the poor monkeys eyes bulging out, tribal men having sex with hogs, tribal girls masturbating....the list goes on.

Stacy Keach and stock animal footage are employed along the way. The government doesn't allow expeditions in this area. They take a helicopter to a mountain, then walk to a beach (a nice wide one where a helicopter could land) then take a boat to an island. Plot continuity was not part of the plan. The plan was to get Ursala Andress stripped naked, tied up and greased down similar to what Bo Derek would later do in ""Tarzan"". We now know John Derek's fetish. Bo er ah Ursala doesn't encounter the cannibals until the last 20 minutes of the film.

Also another problem with this movie,Ursala Andress was way too over the top with it,made the whole thing just look...fake. Its NOT a horror movie. Its more like an adventure (if you can call it that) movie. Through in random shots of  ugly dirty looking cannibal chicks masturbating and you've got the worst film of the year!! Story is very hard to follow,and pretty boring. Its offensive that this movie is rated the same as Cannibal Holocaust,I guess this director was just trying to give us another pathectic attempt at one-upping the masterpiece?

But to get to that point, you have to sit through at least an hour of tedious nonsense, and anyway it's all downhill from there.

This is the movie.  Ursula Andress's husband has gone missing on an expedition in New Guinea.  A search party is formed, and Andress joins them.  Bad music.  She slips and is threatened by a spider, but is saved.  A member of the party gets trapped and dies.  More bad music.  Ursula Andress is threatened by a snake, but is saved.  More people get trapped die.  In the meantime, we see some extended shots of predators like pythons devouring prey.  With bad music.  Eventually the remnants of the search party get to their destination; Andress gets tied to that stake, but her companion figures out a way for them to escape.  They escape.

The so-called ""deviant sexuality"" consists of a ten-second sequence in which one of the natives (and they don't even look Papuan) simulates copulation with some kind of large pig.  Those of you who keep saying things like ""This movie is not for the faint of heart!"" please, stop misleading everybody.  Put it this way.

On their trip they take along several natives that are loyal to Keach. As they get deeper into the jungle they are harassed by members of a tribe of cannibals, the Puka and one by one members of the search party are killed off. Then they meet another English-speaking adventurer named Manolo in the jungle who leads them to a settlement where they spend the night only to be attacked once more by the cannibals. The next morning they set off once more for the mountain but Keach dies along the way and then the brother gets speared in the chest. Andress and Manolo are captured by the cannibals and led to the remains of Andress's husband which they have placed in a place of reverence.

Ursula Andress is indeed beautiful and has a few nude scenes in this movie so if you're interested fast forward to those scenes and forget watching the rest of this slab of waste material. This movie is incredibly dull. The plot sounds exciting but its not. Lots of scenes of walking through the jungle or riding a raft or climbing rocks but no actual action or advancement of the meager plot. Stacy Keach overacts, Ursula underacts and the guy who played her brother can't act. They're in the jungle because Andress is determined to find her husband but only one day after meeting Manolo their making out. The editing is terrible with scenes ending abruptly with no explanation and then there are the scenes of jungle animals that do not blend with the rest of the movie and a few that are not only disturbing but pointless to the plot. One scene shows the natives cutting open a live lizard and another is a monkey being killed by a python that goes on for at least 2 minutes and has nothing to do with anything.

First the quality of the print was a BIG surprise for what I assumed was going to be another no budget exploitation film. The print and transfer were amazing. I cant believe the exotic beautifully shot scenics. Without an actual movie or plot this would be amazing as a travelog...lol.
The movie itself has pretty decent acting, plot, dialog. The shock value is there as well which is expected of such a film. Well done, not overly cheesy.
Ursula Andress is naked and hot. Not a teenager any more it still works. Very erotic rub down by native girls scene.
The extras were pretty good including an interview with the driector and a video frame by frame that seems to indicate he's delusional or a liar but that too is kinda funny and rated several replays. I won't give it away, but I replayed it several times to the amusement of everyone watching the film with me.  Not as gory or in your face as most of the similar films in this genre it played a bit more elievably and was overall mor enjoyable.

The plot is simple.  Susan Stevenson, played by Ursula Andress the first Bond Girl, needs to find her husband who has disappeared into the deep jungles of New Guinea.  They run into problems on many fronts.  Native tribes, a government trying to stop them, and even the wild jungles seem to fight them every step of the way.  Will she find her husband?  Or is there more here happening than meets the eye?  There is, to be honest, a very interesting plot twist near the end.
For fans of Ursula Andress there is one brief scene where is she changing, so she is topless.  Nothing really you would not find in most European films.  But you began to understand why PlayBoy once offered her thousands to pose nude in 2000.  She had posed for them, nude, in 1965.  Also stars Stacy Keach before he really became known to American viewers as Mike Hammer and the father in Titus.
Uncut, this really holds nothing back,  and I would suggest it only for the strong of heart and stomach.  103 minutes, in color, and unrated.

1654446,2,B00005R24J,"If you have seen Cannibal Holocaust or Cannibal Ferox, this film
plays like a milder version of those bad boys. Not as gory and not as
much animal cruelty/deaths. Of course the main thing that makes
'Mountain...' stand out from the other Cannibal films and be of
increased interest to fans of this type of stuff is no doubt screen
goddess Ursula Andress appearing nude towards the end of the film.

However I have to say this film is toss.

It sucks.

I won't go into the plot, but despite it moving along rapidly the film
takes forever to get going. It's not long before Ursula and her cohorts
are hiking through the jungle on their mission to find her lost husband
but their expedition is largely tiresome to watch. Occasionally bizarre
animal conflicts (alligator vs turtle) are interspersed with the boring
storyline.

I'm pretty sure when we see an alligator and a turtle square off it
was set up so the animals would fight by dropping them next to each
other.

The main animal cruelty that takes place is a monkey getting eaten by
a huge snake which looks like it was set up by the animal handlers.
It is what it is. Personally I think the animal deaths in these
exploitation films are lame. It's quite brief and you don't really
see that much. The director refutes the idea of the monkey vs snake
scene being set up in the mini documentary on the disc in an attempt
to shed some responsibility. Amusingly, he also claims there is
nothing erotic about the film.

The last 30 minutes or so is all that's worth watching.
During this time we see-

-The main characters get captured by the cannibals.
-One of the main characters gets cut open and his insides are
consumed, (not as gory as it sounds unfortunately)
-The corpse of Ursula's character's husband displayed on a wooden scaffold.
Chilling to see, but it does not seem to distress Ursula's character one bit.
-Ursula gets stripped naked, tied up and slathered with orange mud.
Again, this scenario does not seem to cause her any distress. Her
character sure was one cool cookie! Ursula was 41 at the time
and still totally gorgeous, unfortunately there are no beaver shots and the scene is all too brief.
-One of the cannibal girls briefly pleasing herself, quite hot.
-One of the cannibal guys doing something unmentionable with a pig, Hilarious!

The bottom line is- unless you are a hardcore Cannibal film freak, or big Ursula Andress
fan this film is not worth purchasing. I rate it 2 stars for the last
half hour.",1253145600,5,2479,4.605442176870748

They along with her brother trek deep into the jungle, and come face to face with a cannibal tribe.

Andress was topless in one scene and totally nude in another. Her nudity is worth the price of this film alone. There are alos a cxouple scenes here that were edited out of previous copies of this film, includined here for the first time the scene with a tribalman having sex with a giant hog, while the hog continues to eat. A midly graphic masterbation scence from a tribal girl... It also contains a rather gruesome death scene of a monkey being eaten alive by a python. Director Martino claims that this scene with the monkey was an accident, but it seems that a frame by frame shot says that the monkey was perhaps pushed into the scene and filmed being eaten alive, this according to a 13 minute interview footage with Martino.

This film is great for anyone who likes the adventure/survival genre where an expedition is slowly killed off by native in cruel, unusual ways and then finally captured and subjected ot barbarous rituals. Think the classic Naked Prey with Cornel Wilde or more recently Tarzan the Ape man with Bo Derek. A bow to the unforgettable scene of Fay Wray being offered up to King Kong would be in order. It provides everything one would want in the genre: relentless, cruel natives, animal fights to the death, sacrificial rituals, naked natives, native sex, and a naked Ursula. Sadly the animal fights appear to have been staged by throwing them together and filming what happens. The biggest flaw is that the sound was done in the Italian manner. That is, no sound recording was done on set during the scene. It was all added later.
