8754066,5,B01CS4Z78K,I wish there were tv shows like this on tv now. newton minnow was right. these days tv is a vast waste land. and radio also needs to be cleaned up as well. radio isn't much better these days. I plan to buy this show because I have always liked garry moore. he was a class act.,1515801600,,276,3.8596491228070176

8754072,4,B01CS4Z78K,"I purchased this because I love Garry Moore on I've Got A Secret, and I'm also a Carol Burnett fan. The highlights for me, however, were the bits with Dick Van Dyke.  It's also fun to see Marion Lorne in something other than Bewitched and Strangers On A Train.

The packaging does not indicate which episodes are included, but having watched it I will list them here:
1) January 17, 1961.  Guests: Dick Van Dyke & Jo Stafford. Regulars: Carol Burnett, Durward Kirby, & Marion Lorne.
2) September 26, 1961.  Guests: Julie Andrews & Alan King.  Regulars: Carol Burnett, Durward Kirby, & Marion Lorne.",1466553600,6,598,4.711538461538462
