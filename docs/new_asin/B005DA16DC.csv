4657588,3,B005DA16DC,Typical high school drama. Taking everything way too seriously. As if high school is the last meaningful stop in life.,1363219200,,118,4.95
4657589,4,B005DA16DC,"It may not be produced by one of the major Hollywood companies, but it has all the trimmings of a big budget movie: good story, excellent comedy to accompany the light drama, and a cool cast. As a fan of Ezra Miller, I was interested in his performance and was then pleasantly surprised by the rest of the cast. This was a fun movie that is designed well and well worth your time. Don't miss it.",1334793600,,395,4.2105263157894735
8466453,4,B005DA16DC,"This movie is hilarious in a lot of ways. While the writing lacks somewhat, everyone's performance makes it fun to watch.",1484438400,,121,4.809523809523809
8466454,3,B005DA16DC,"Let me begin by saying 2 things, the first is that I seem to be on some kind of teen bullies of the school theme these days and honestly they leave me cold. The second is that I love Ezra Miller, this kid has tons of talent and just wait and see, he'll be huge. The antagonist in this movie is Jesse McCartney and we also get the talents of Zoe Kravitz and Amy Sedaris. Very talented young cast but when ezra (the Gonzo) gets kicked off the school newspaper by the popular guy he creates his own underground school paper and well it is a big hit but then all the back stabbing and falsehoods come bubbling to the surface. I'm not saying it is a bad movie or a great one either. I am saying that this is a so-so movie. Been there seen that kind of movie. If you have some time to kill, sure go ahead an watch it but not much is fresh or original.",1484006400,,845,3.976470588235294
8466455,3,B005DA16DC,"I will start off by saying that I went into this film as a HUGE Ezra Miler fan and admittedly I had a neutral approach to it because I've noticed that sometimes an actor's earliest works tend to be hit or miss in my experience. I will describe this movie as something that won't be for everybody. Especially for those that have seen more films in their lifetime than I have. It does have that cliche concept of the underdogs v.s the big bad establishment that are the higher ups in the school. Although I confess to say that I have not seen too many of these kind of movies due to that storyline being overdone and I wouldn't want to waste my time on them unless if told otherwise.

On a side note: I thought it was hilarious when Ezra's character Gonzo starts shouting ""No justice! No peace!"" mainly because of the current affairs that have been reported on the news in the United States that I won't get into. Anyway, I personally enjoyed this film a lot because it reminds me so much of how I was in high school. Maybe not to the extreme that this film portrays, but in a lot of aspects, I'd say that this is pretty accurate representation of me at that time (OK maybe I still am like that to an extent, but that's besides the point). Overall I'd say that if you are somebody who's an Ezra Miller fan or someone who's in the mood to watch some teenage comedy and drama, I'd say that this film is definitely worth checking out. It's far from perfect, but if you all want to go to a trip down memory lane, you won't be too disappointed.",1483574400,,1537,4.2457337883959045
8466456,3,B005DA16DC,"I enjoyed Ezra Miller and Jesse Mcartney's performances, though I found the other acting to be bland and a bit over-done. I liked the concept behind the minority trying to overcome the cliche majority. The main thing I didn't enjoy how Evie's motivations seemed to completely revolve around the males at her school and as a female high school student, I found this to be a but demeaning. I would prefer if she had made a stand on her own instead of following Gonzo around like a lap dog. I also didn't like how her only reason to stand up against the pig boys at her school was that she was basically sexually assaulted by Gavin and the other boys. Overall, the movie was a bit cliche and the acting was okay, but it was quirky and expressed it's own kind of charm. I enjoyed the plot, though it was a bit mediocre. Ezra Miller was the shining star in this flim.",1453420800,,862,4.327160493827161

8466458,5,B005DA16DC,"Ezra Miller reminds me of a young johnny depp. It's worth watching just to see his awesome acting. I predict him becomming a huge star. He is so multi talented, he sang opera, he models and he's a fabulous actor.",1433462400,,212,4.325
8466459,5,B005DA16DC,"This movies was really good. Ezra Miller is amazing, and Kloe did a great job as well.",1420588800,,86,4.117647058823529
8466460,1,B005DA16DC,"The low budget fact didn't bother me, what did was for a prep school, a school full of high schoolers, all the actors were college age. I hated that. Maybe that is why I didn't like the story but. I could not watch all of it. I have to see a little realism a accept a movie and this one was lacking.",1383177600,,299,3.838709677419355
8466461,4,B005DA16DC,"It's the first week of Senior year and already, Gonzo Gilman has been kicked off the school paper and his friends are being bullied. Gonzo is a smart kid and he knows better than anyone that the pen is mightier than the sword. With the help of his loser buddies, Gonzo comes up with a plan to create the anti-newspaper of his High School, a publication that focuses on the negatives of the school and it's students. Most of these High School themed movies are about the popular kids drama or the unknown student who becomes a legend, but how often do you see the losers rise up against the popular kids, in a non-violent way? This story was written by Bryan Goluboff, who also wrote the screen play for one of my favorite movies, The Basketball Diaries. Much like that film, this one is as clever as it is funny. Ezra Miller stars as Gonzo, and gives the best performance I've seen him give. Yes, he was great in Perks of Being a Wallflower, but he has a whole different energy here, and I think it might have something to do with Miller's personal life. Miller is openly gay and has often talked about how difficult it's been for him. The character he's playing here, Gonzo Gilman, is a cult hero for every kid that's ever been bullied and didn't know what to do about it, and in a way I think this role was Miller's way of fighting back against what happened to him. He's opposed by Jesse McCartney, the most popular kid in school. I think McCartney is a tremendous talent and he's a good looking kid. For that reason, he's always portrayed as this sweet, loveable guy, and it was really great to see him in a different type of role. Sometimes the best way to rejuvenate your career is by trying something new and it works here. Beware The Gonzo is a refreshingly unique, independent film, with a great young cast, and an amazing writer, who is very particular about what he does. Everything comes together to create something terrific that we really haven't seen before. I can honestly say I loved every minute of this film and for that it's receives the label of must see movie!",1382227200,,2082,4.438642297650131
8466462,5,B005DA16DC,"I loved this movie. It was quirky funny and had a great ensemble of actors. I was surprised when I saw Jesse McCartney. He did a great job, really committed to the jerk role. Oh Ezra! Such a great actor and paired with Zoe Kravitz! This movie was great and I'm surprised that I never heard of it before. Watch it ya won't regret it. :p",1379808000,,335,4.090909090909091
