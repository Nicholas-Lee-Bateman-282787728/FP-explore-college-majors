8344273,3,B001ULDK1O,Many other Scenic Christmas dvds rank higher than this one.  I would recommend A Stained Glass Christmas DVD or Christmas in New York DVD for exceptional scenery and Christmas music.,1388707200,3,182,5.066666666666666
8344274,5,B001ULDK1O,"My family and I are great fans of Randy Parthe's DVD programs.  Christmas in the Country transports us to our beloved Montana when we are home in our southern California digs.  I don't understand the overly critical remarks in some of the other reviews of this DVD, but as always, to each his own. The photography of so many familiar locales in Montana is breathtaking and we love the musical accompaniment which adds so much to our holiday season.  Mr Parthe has several other films that are available here on Amazon, but he has additional titles as well as fine art prints and greeting cards available on his Persona Recordings website. My own all-time favorite is ""Spring Fever"" filmed in Stillwater County, Montana. I take out one of these wonderful DVD's a couple of times each month just to relax and center mind.  My family will walk into the room and tease me saying, ""Dad's in Montana again..."" But, 90 percent of the time they sit down and join me in my Montana journey.  That is the highest compliment I can pay to this video program.",1358553600,2,1045,4.596774193548387
8344275,5,B001ULDK1O,"You can't go wrong with the winter / Christmas DVDs. The music in these along with the pictures just add to the spirit of the season. They are great to play when you want to unwind, or when company is present and you want to create a nice atmosphere.  I have played this for our grand daughter who never saw snow until a year ago so she could vision what we were taking her to.  She now can watch the DVD to revist her own fun memories of playing in the snow!",1333929600,,459,3.9782608695652173
8344276,1,B001ULDK1O,"The visuals are very lovely and calming. However, I had to have a replacement for the first one I received because the sound quality was so bad...the second one is the same way. Too bad because it really would be wonderful if the sound quality wasn't so absolutely awful.",1279324800,,271,4.551020408163265
8344277,3,B001ULDK1O,"I ordered 3 of these, 1 for myself and 2 as gifts for my sisters. Had I watched it before I would not have ordered any. The music is ok but why it is called ""Christmas"" is beyond me. A few of the scenes have an a Christmas overlay [similar to a sticker] in the corner. It is very clear that this is digitally inserted and that the video is simply winter scenes [and not even pretty snow filled scenes] with an overlay. I will keep it simply because of the expense of returning it and for the few wildlife scenes in it. If you want a good snow filled Christmas video to turn down low while entertaining try A Winter Snowfall or any of the Winter Serinity series",1265155200,,660,4.124031007751938
8344278,1,B001ULDK1O,"I bought this DVD thinking that it would be full of country scenes, adding to my Xmas spirit, like beautiful snow in the forests, barns with animals , etc. Instead,I got a bunch of depressing pictures that could be taken by any amateur photographer, with scenes totally unrelated to Xmas. Just a bunch of dirty snow banks, broken down, rusty dwellings, always set in this overcast coloring that could make anyone viewing it totally depressed. I could take such pictures myself with my old digital camera and play some unrelated music in the background.
The thing is, I would like to return this DVD but learned that Amazon wants it in an un-opened condition, meaning it must be still in its plastic wrapper. Now how can anybody test the condition of a CD or a DVD without examining its content???!!! So I will have to bite the bullet and throw this DVD into the trash can.
So my advice is: DO NOT BUY THIS MEDIOCRE DVD!",1263513600,,919,4.542168674698795
8344279,4,B001ULDK1O,"First, this is not a truly professional product, but its flaws made it believable and the subject matter (quiet, beautiful nature scenes) more enjoyable than something slickly produced.  Second, it is perfect to enjoy when baking, wrapping presents, writing Christmas cards; anything that is labor-intensive and does not demand your full attention.  The music and scenery contribute to the overall peaceful background that is so difficult to prolong during this hectic season.  It will be a holiday tradition for me (the worker bee) in the future.  Thanks to its creator!",1261353600,4,571,5.311111111111111
8344280,1,B001ULDK1O,"Some of the video footage real lame videography...looks like any amatuer could've taken not impressed at all..Christmas in the country..what about all the town and city scenes and just plain ugly stuff....Just thought it would have more images of country scenes like barns in the snow and at night and old stone farmhouses ans cottages..it would have been nicer if the scenes would've been just shot better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I mean really, who wants to see development homes, etc.  can see them everyday.. wish i didn't buy!",1260403200,,523,5.141176470588236
8344281,1,B001ULDK1O,Photography is novice...music and photo selection is elementary...I would not recommend this DVD for its price.,1259020800,2,111,6.0
8344282,5,B001ULDK1O,"What an enjoyable experience.  It's great fun for the entire family.  Can't wait to watch it again, especially during the Holiday season. It'll be perfect to pop in the DVD while decorating the house, preparing Holiday treats, and during family gatherings.  I love the music and the scenery is awesome.  It makes for a very pleasant, relaxing experience.  I purchased a few extra to give as gifts.  Trust me, it does not disappoint.",1237939200,7,432,4.8493150684931505
