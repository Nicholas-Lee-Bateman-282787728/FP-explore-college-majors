1619660,5,B00005KA71,"This is truly amazing. A spiritual journey in to a great man who was a real leader. Marley was a talent with guts to stand up for what he believed in and changed cultures, politics and the way we listen to grooves around the planet! What sets this video apart from others on Marley is its detailed analysis of Jamaica - its culture and context in the time of Marley's beautiful music which swept accross the world and revolutionising its consciousness. Marley has left his mark, and no video or album could ever give what the king did any sort of justice. Let's just hope that people can connect with the material in such a way that effects the way we carry out our practical lives, and live Marley's gospel of love and spirituality, with a mix of political and social ambition, pushing our consciousness to a new level of maturity and civilisation.
Good work on this video!",1009929600,7,874,4.537974683544304
1619661,5,B00005KA71,"As a 30 Year old Man, Sadly, I only discovered Bob Marley when I was in College at ages 18-22. Life in College was difficult and It was the lyrics of the Marley music that brought me through. Having never seen any footage of the reasons and inspiration behind his songs... I only speculated, until this video... This video was awsome... and has inspired me find and buy ever footage of bob I can afford. Be aware however that this is a ""tear jerker"" so if you think you are the macho type ... don't watch it with the wife or girlfriend... cause it will blow your cover.. This DVD was very well produced...OSCAR material. By the way his children..Ziggy, Jr Gong, Kymani, Julian, Ragga, all have excellent voices and music exspecially Kymani...

The DVD includes both studio and live clips of Marley's most popular music, including some rare footage too.  At times it is emotional; taking a look at a musical genius who was able to touch thousands around the world before his premature death.",991612800,14,367,4.53030303030303

1619668,5,B00005KA71,"What more can be said about the king of the reggae genre Bob Marley..this documentary traces Bob career from his early recording including the assassination attempts up until his death at the age of 36.

His wife Rita plays a major role in the film but telling her side of the story as wee as the side that Bob couldn't tell because of his early death.

It contains lots of footage of his early recordings with Bunny and Peter which alone are worthy of  a watch.

Bob was an artiste who not only had something to say , but something that made sense.

I recommend this.",1141862400,5,568,4.320754716981132
1619669,4,B00005KA71,"Bob Marley is a giant in the world of music. He and his band, the Wailers, helped to introduce a new style of music to the world. His lyrics spoke volumes about what he experienced in his native land of Jamaica and his short life was mired by controversy. This documentary explores the late reggae singer's tenure on this planet, with lots of interviews and plenty of music.

Marley's life is laid out before the screen on this documentary with many of his friends, family, and associates speaking to the camera about the reggae legend. Former Wailers Bunny Livingstone and Peter Tosh talk about Bob Marley as a musician and friend. Chris Blackwell from Island Records, shares his feelings on Marley.  Rita Marley, Bob's widow, talks more than anyone else and she provides some insight into Marley's personal life and family relations. It is known that Bob Marley had affairs with many different women and Rita talks about this on the documentary. She seems to have accepted husband Bob's infidelity- both then and now- even though she was obviously a little uneasy with the situation.

Marley himself speaks a few times in this documentary, but he only says a few words and what he says is often difficult to understand. His Jamaican accent is heavy and you have to listen close to decipher his words. When he sings, the words are easier to understand. It was nice to hear Marley speak, but he really doesn't get a chance to say much. As soon as he starts to answer a question, the camera switches to a different scene. This was a little frustrating. I would have liked to hear more words of wisdom directly from the man himself. I also would have liked to hear some comments from Marley's children, like Ziggy and the others. This would have added some more insight into Bob Marley's character.

Musical clips can be seen throughout this documentary. Some of the featured songs are well- known tunes, but there are some rarities too. And as an added feature on the DVD, you get a selection of musical tunes to listen to along with a discography of Marley's albums, including those issued after his death.

Bob Marley is a larger than life figure in his native land of Jamaica and he is a musical icon to many people around the world who gained inspiration from his music. This documentary has a few flaws, but it is still a very good one for fans of the late reggae singer. It includes plenty of interviews, rare photos, and lots of great reggae tunes from this musical genius.",1122422400,13,2479,4.637813211845103
1619670,4,B00005KA71,"Bob Marley is still greatly missed. He died in 1981 at the age of 36 from melanoma. He had reached international fame and had arguably produced some of the most inspirational and original music of the century. At the height of his power he apparently couldn't imagine himself being sick and sadly did nothing about his melanoma for three years until it caught up with him. This DVD is a fine documentary about a great artist whose music lives on from generation to generation. My son, who is 11, loves Bob Marley, as do all of his friends. The documentary would have been better if it contained more performance footage of complete songs instead of relatively quick cuts as it moves on to more historical material. But it is well worth owning for anyone who loves Marley and his brilliant music.",1101081600,5,795,4.6453900709219855
1619671,3,B00005KA71,"This is a good bio of Bob Marley but it still lacks real insight into his life and career...it doesn't break any new ground and the story is told better by Bob himself on the video ""Time Will Tell"" and by people who knew him on ""Caribbean Nights: The Bob Marley Story"" Hopefully, these will get re-issued on DVD as I think they are far superior. As one previous reviewer noted, there is virtually no Bunny and no Tosh. I did find the interviews with the former CIA Agent interesting. All in all, not bad but not the best.",1042761600,21,521,4.2727272727272725
1619672,3,B00005KA71,"It starts out really good then peters out midway on. Why is it that whenever Bob is about to go in depth about a particular subject, the filmmakers cut to him performing? How could they not address the Wailers break up? I mean they literally ignore it. Isn't the break up as significant as them getting together in the first place? Did Marley's music regress, progress or stagnate after Bunny and Peter left? How did Bob feel about Bunny and Tosh leaving? And what happened to Bunny anyway? You see him early on and then you don't see him again. Since he's the only one alive of the three, doesn't his opinion have more weight than most. All I'm saying is the audience would have gotten an even better understanding of Marley with more Bunny and more Tosh.",1039046400,36,756,4.4855072463768115

7943098,4,B00005KA71,"The life of Bob Marley is told by the people that lived in and were a part of his life.
The video and narration further establishes the fact of his love and hope for his fellow Jamaicans and his country.
My son (16) and I watched and we both came to the same conclusion of how disappointed we are, we would never witness a Marley concert or feel the passion of his live voice singing his message to his family.
After visiting the country of Bob Marley, the amazing island of Jamaica for the third time, it is easy to see and understand why his passion and prophetic ways absorbed these people.
The country has the most authentic and open personalities of any nation we have been to in our travels.
This DVD gives a small but in depth look at a man that tried to keep his country unified and moving forward with music and song, he did it!
One Love is a total overveiw of what Bob was and is trying to say.",1298073600,,904,4.171428571428572

He will not be forgotten.  He is a hero not only to Jamaica but to the world.  This video is a dedication to the man and his music which I believe will always keep him and his message to the world alive.  It is amazing that a man who was on earth such a short time-gave us so much.,1283040000,,439,3.8333333333333335
7943100,5,B00005KA71,"I first saw this documentary back in 2003 on the Sundance channel,
then in 2005 on VH-1...I enjoyed it both times because it goes all the way
back to the beginnings of the legendary Bob Marley's life in the rural
outlying countryside of Kingston, Jamaica; born the product of a white british
father and a black mother who worked as a domestic & cook in 1945.
It covers his growing up in humble circumstances but making the best of what he
and his mother had and finding laughter, wisdom & pride within the pain and
harsh realities of growing up in dire poverty.
His father disappeared from his life early on, so never was really an influence.
By his teen years, they had relocated to Kingston's concrete jungle called ""Trenchtown"".
There he became a ""rude boy"" for awhile, but that never really stuck because the thug life
wasn't for the high-spirited, good-natured and serious-minded young Bob, who had began to
take a liking to music and playing guitar.
He left Jamaica a few times during these years and lived and work menial jobs throughout
the northeastern & southeastern U.S., which was then in the throws of the
civil rights struggle and the social upheaval of the 1960's.
This, accompanied by the music of artists like Curtis Mayfield & The Impressions, Motown,
Bob Dylan, and the messages in the music of those times, all spoke to his soul and
inspired him to no end! He then knew what it was he wanted to do with his life,
and upon his return to his native Jamaica, he hooked up with a band of rag tags
from around trenchtown and surrounding Kingston and a band was born!

Influenced by the local sounds of ""ska"" music and the folk-like primitive rhythms
of the island chants, as well as a new spiritual awakening through the outcast
rastafari religion and philosophy, all the elements began to come together!
With plenty of practice and trial and error, The Wailers first, and later,
Bob Marley & The Wailers emerged on the world music scene in the early 70's
with a new, urgent, passionate sound with a different beat and profound message
called ""Reggae"" and the rest is history!
This documentary goes on to cover Bob Marley's incredible story in intimate detail
with interviews from Bob's mother Cecilia, his first and principle wife, Rita Marley,
members of the Wailers including early recorded interviews with the late great Peter Tosh,
Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, and many more who freely recant their stories.
There is also great concert footage as well as interviews with Bob Marley and
home video footage of his homelife and lighter moments.
His darker moments: the assassination attempt, his cancer diagnosis in 1978,
and his eventual decline in health, subsequent death in May of 1981,
and funeral are all covered as well within the context of this film.
This is defintely a worthwhile purchase for fans of Bob Marley's music and legend.",1257811200,2,2870,4.786290322580645
