3101750,3,B00133KFKS,"OK, it this a 1 star because it is so bad or a 5 star because it is so bad it's fun?  I'm averaging the two and calling it a 3.  If you rent this, you will be losing 1:40 of your life that will never be replaced.  You will feel the need to watch and learn the proper application of a lobotomy to remove the damage watching this movie will do to your mind!  Will you be entertained?  That depends on how twisted your sense of humor really is.  Is there a plot?  Is there anything about this film that justifies the bandwidth used to transmit it to you?  Again it depends on just how unstable you are mentally.  If I was back at a college frat party, I guess I would enjoy it, now I just sit and wonder how I feel about it.  Thank goodness for Amazon video credits so I didn't pay for it!",1325635200,,786,3.9177215189873418
3101751,1,B00133KFKS,"The movie warns the viewer at the beginning that the movie is offensive.  What they fail to tell the viewer is that the most offensive thing about the movie is that being offensive is not just result or part of the movie - but it the purpose.  Yep, the sole purpose of the movie is to be offensive.  The writes obviously hate religion and proceed to bore the audience to tears trying childishly to offend anyone who believes in anything.  Don't get me wrong, I was not so offend that I wrote this review - no, I was so bored at the overt attempt to offend me that I wanted to warn others that this is not the worst horror movie ever because really bad horror movies are fun.  Instead, this movie is simply the worst ""movie"" if one can honestly call it that; a movie.  It is more like a bunch dirt bags with a high definition camcorder trying to show just how clever they are.  Well, they failed miserably at being clever and at being entertaining.  However, they do offend but in not a funny or clever way so much as an obnoxious way; but that seems to be the entire point.  In summary, just think of a bunch of drunk college guys who never grew out of a 5th grade mindset belching and farting their way through ant-religion, anti-American, anti-women, yes, anti-anything jokes (and I use the word ""jokes"" lightly here).  Finally, I think that the writers are so childish in their mindset that would relish my review.  Pantheistic isn't it?",1318032000,23,1440,4.416666666666667

3101753,5,B00133KFKS,"This movie lives up to its title.. The worst horror movie ever.... lol  There's some good looking women that are topless and more.  Some good simulated sex symbols.

A few close ups of the goods...  It was worth the money for the skin.  Any movie by Bill Zebub is worth the money.",1310601600,6,280,4.3076923076923075
3101754,5,B00133KFKS,"Good movie with extreme close ups of the female GENETALIA if thats what your into. And the women are gorgeous. Movie has multiple storylines including, rape, monsters, history, jesus, abortions, hillbillies, arabs, body changing, need i say more? IT HAS IT ALL",1299715200,27,260,5.214285714285714
3101755,1,B00133KFKS,"This is by the moviemakers' accounts a remake of a movie that was worse. If that is to be believed, the original was for sure the worst movie ever made of any genre. This movie is so awful with disjointed scenes, incomprhensible plot and pretty much the worst acting imaginable, there is no excuse for watching it to the end.
The movie appears to be made by adults but has the earmarks of juvenile minds that never got past potty jokes and sexual curiosity.  The movie is gross, stupid, occasionally boring and probably drug-induced.  Those are its best features.  Oh yeah, the credits both opening and closing are creditable.  It's just everything between the credits is so bloody useless that whatever it cost me was a rip-off.  And it wasn't cheap.  For whatever reasons, it's an expensive movie as cheap trash goes. I suppose it's because most people who had it probably threw it away and those who think they want it are forced to pay for its scarcity.  Enough said.",1297814400,10,971,4.643274853801169

3101757,5,B00133KFKS,"I bought this movie on a recommendation from a friend who said that it was a movie that has to be seen in order to be believed.  I begged him to borrow it before I bought it, but he refused.  She said she lent her first copy to someone and never got it back, and that she loved it so much that she bought a replacement.  That's all I had to hear.

This is like Homer's ""Odyssey"" -that is, if Homer was even more crazy and didn't care about nostos.  Well, there is nostos in this movie, but you will probably be too distracted by the unbelievable amount of nudty, absurdity, wit, and offensiveness.  the plot is so complex that even MY head reeled.  But the boobs softened every blow.  The sheer amount of genius material so densely compacted ensures that each time you watch the movie you will hear or see something new.  Even if it didn't, you MUST watch the movie again when you subject narrow-minded people to it.  Trust me, it's priceless.

I can't recommend this movie enough!  Sure, some movie-makers claim to be politically-incorrect and offensive, but this movie is the one that the dictionary should use as an example of those terms.",1268265600,20,1142,4.463768115942029

I am a film student, and I can tell you, it is almost impossible to find such low quality digital camera today. Even if you are looking for just nudity (which I was looking for), it is going to be a complete rip off. Some reviewers said they were satisfied by the nudity. I guess, those were the makers of this ""movie"". You can watch more explicit nudity in youtube for free, I did last night. And you or your kid can make a better movie yourself, any day, by your smart cell phone camera. Just get some guys sit and stand in a room, and ask them talk, and shoot. And then watch your own movie instead of this one. I guaranty, you will enjoy that more.

Yes there is a lot of nudity, but this has to be the cheapest made movie I have ever seen. We watched a few minutes of it and then turned it right off.

You can't take this movie at face value because it dose not have any face value.  What it it has is a silly scrip with bad acting.

Why Amazon would even let something like this on thier website is simply amazing to me.  Anyone could have made a better video.  There is nothing here that could possibly appeal to anyone.

That said, it reminds me of early student super 8 films by people like Peter Jackson (Dead Alive comes to mind) If you like to collect 'C' films, its worth having as a groaner.",1330732800,3,335,4.694915254237288
3336308,5,B00133KFKS,"I bought this movie on a recommendation from a friend who said that it was a movie that has to be seen in order to be believed. I begged him to borrow it before I bought it, but he refused. She said she lent her first copy to someone and never got it back, and that she loved it so much that she bought a replacement. That's all I had to hear.

This is like Homer's ""Odyssey"" -that is, if Homer was even more crazy and didn't care about nostos. Well, there is nostos in this movie, but you will probably be too distracted by the unbelievable amount of nudty, absurdity, wit, and offensiveness. the plot is so complex that even MY head reeled. But the boobs softened every blow. The sheer amount of genius material so densely compacted ensures that each time you watch the movie you will hear or see something new. Even if it didn't, you MUST watch the movie again when you subject narrow-minded people to it. Trust me, it's priceless.

I can't recommend this movie enough! Sure, some movie-makers claim to be politically-incorrect and offensive, but this movie is the one that the dictionary should use as an example of those terms.",1326758400,,1132,4.463768115942029
