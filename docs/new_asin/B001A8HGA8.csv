8276386,5,B001A8HGA8,"I recommend the 8 DVD of the collection of this encyclopedia of BJJ carried out by D. Marcus Vinicius DI Luca.
All the information is perfectly structured, in a such way that, the teaching is very simple for the logic of the teaching method.
The explanations understand all the necessary details to understand all the explained movements perfectly.
In my modest opinion, the initial formation in JUDO of the Teacher Marcus Vinicius facilitates the teaching methodology a lot and it simplifies the understanding of its teaching a lot.
I believe that ALL the DVD of the encyclopedia is basic for all the people that already begin in BJJ, and a very good tool of consultation for people initiate.
For everything it, I recommend the complete purchase of the 8 DVD.",1414195200,,760,4.8538461538461535
8276387,3,B001A8HGA8,"You will find this info on any Judo takedown dvd.  It is easy to follow, and I have learned a few new things",1363478400,,108,3.6956521739130435
8276388,4,B001A8HGA8,"As a recently minted White Belt in BJJ, having a background in Judo, I was surprised when I was told that takedowns and throws are not taught. Inquiries directed to my Instructor, and further questions posted in various appropriate places on the net, turned up a general consensus that it is not taught until students reach higher ranks, and the primary reason is because of the possibilities of injuries are high. I got the same reaction when I asked about foot locks.

This DVD bridges the gap in instruction, and does it well. You may not be allowed to use it in your school, but it may save you in a self defense situation.",1348531200,,627,4.5
8276389,5,B001A8HGA8,"To be honest, I have trained with Marcus at BHJJC for 5 years now.

As will all of his DVDs, this series is based on the technical details of solid, basic Jiu Jitsu and Judo.  As I mentioned in my other reviews, this is not a DVD of the hottest Judo or Jiu Jitsu craze of the week.  Marcus has a black belt in Judo, to go along with his 5th degree black belt in Jiu Jitsu, so he knows these moves inside and out.  He walks through each of the throws and shows how each step of the throw should be done.  The DVD does have some wrestling but if you are looking for a pure wrestling or takedown DVD, you'd probably be more interested in something like Dan Gable's Wrestling Essentials.  These takedowns are great for Jiu Jitsu competitions and will help you build a base in Judo.  A lot of Jiu Jitsu schools don't train standup and takedowns as often as they train ground techniques so this DVD has been really helpful to continue to refresh my mind about what I need to do to be successful with my throws.",1329091200,,1004,4.170984455958549
