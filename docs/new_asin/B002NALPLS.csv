3959172,5,B002NALPLS,"Fabulous DVD.  We are big fans of SNL and have rarely missed a show for many years.  We have most of the ""Best of SNL"" DVD's and this is a great one, perhaps the best!  Amy Poehler is so talented and has such a range of great characters.  Big loss for SNL when she moved on.  ""Best of SNL"" DVD's are fabulous - no commercials and only terrific sketches.",1262822400,,353,4.057971014492754
3959173,5,B002NALPLS,"This is even better than the rest of the SNL DVDs where very often you get the typical New York aloof druggy self-indulgent drivel sometimes. This is a very good DVD, almost 2 hours long of some of the best bits by a very talented comedienne. It starts off on a very strong note by the skit with Tina Fey as Sarah Palin and Poehler as Hillary Clinton. There is not almost one bas skit. Fantastic also is the one about teh couple that should be divorced. Poehler is very funny and extremely talented and this comes well across in a long section of short character skits that is simply splendid. It is very cheap and if you have missed these things it is worth the price. Justin timberlake and Hillary Clinton herself even appear.",1257465600,18,728,4.4
3959174,5,B002NALPLS,"I had watched her best of special when it recently was aired shortly after her leaving SNL. I found it to be absolutely hilarious! She was my favorite member on SNL besides Tina Fey. There wasn't a sketch she did that wasn't hilarious. To see her in films, this I believe is the next best thing and waiting for her to do more movies, because she is just a natural at what she does. I can't wait for this best of collection to be released!!",1254009600,,439,4.176470588235294
3959175,5,B002NALPLS,"It's about time we got another Best of from the more recent cast.  The last great one was Jimmy Fallon's!  This was an awesome collection on TV and should be even better on DVD as it will have some extra features from Amy's years on SNL.  I can't wait for the release!  Hopefully more 'SNL Best of's will be forthcoming, such as Tina Fey!  That one is much needed as well!",1253318400,,372,4.183098591549296

3959185,5,B002NALPLS,This was a birthday gift for my friend who's obsessed with Amy Poehler and she loved this gift. It shipped on time just in time for her birthday. We watched it the night of her birthday and were both laughing hysterically. This is a great compilation of some of Amy Poehler's best work at SNL.,1424304000,2,293,4.345454545454546

3959197,5,B002NALPLS,"I bought this for my 16 year old who thinks Amy Poehler is the funniest woman alive. She has watched this video so many times, constantly re-playing parts, and laughing so hard she cries. It's a great video, classic SNL laughs.",1397088000,,227,4.560975609756097

3959199,5,B002NALPLS,"Amy is hilarious.  She has always been one of my favorite SNL cast members.  Her character of Caitlin (very energized preteen) will always be one of my favorites.  ""RICK! RICK! RICK!""",1392595200,,183,4.838709677419355
3959200,5,B002NALPLS,"I love Amy Poehler, so I knew I would love this mix. It really does have the best sketches on it, with the exception of the ""Down and Out Dollar"" which I'm guessing many like but I personally don't care for. But what really makes this DVD worth it (besides the fact that Netflix no longer has SNL 2000s) is the commentary between her and Seth Myers- seriously worth a listen!",1390953600,,375,4.295774647887324
3959201,5,B002NALPLS,"Received this yesterday and have already played it twice. Classic Poehler with many moments from Weekend Update with Seth Meyers and Tina Fey and other moments with Fey including the Bush twins.

Odd insert threw me for a loop when her ""last show"" Weekend Update segment was in the middle of the disc.

Of course, the ""Palin Rap"" (too funny) is included.

There were a couple dress rehearsal sketches and some Update outakes and I haven't watched the DVD with the commentary on.

Overall, the DVD left me wishing for more Poehler, but happy I ordered this one!",1373155200,,560,4.683673469387755
3959202,5,B002NALPLS,"So fun to watch such a talented comedian.  Love Tina Fey more, but Poehler a close 2nd.  Great price and value.",1372464000,,111,4.238095238095238
3959203,5,B002NALPLS,"Amy Poehler is such a great comedian. She has a way of just taking a skit and expanding it . I rank up there with Burnett, and Ball.",1371168000,,132,3.75
3959204,5,B002NALPLS,It was great to look back at Amy's career and laugh at all of the different characters she has played.  If you like Amy Poehler or just like to laugh you won't be disappointed.,1366675200,,176,4.176470588235294
3959205,5,B002NALPLS,"I love just about everything Amy Poeler did on SNL.  There are so few SNL DVDs of their female comedians./actresses.  So I had to get this.  It has many favorites of mine.  I absolutely love her impersonation of Christopher Walkin.  Now where's Laraine Newman's & Jane Cutain, Tina Fey, Nora Dunn, Jan Hooks, Maya Rudolph, Ana Gasteyer, & a second Gilda Radner. I'm sure there's gonna be a Kristen Wiig SNL DVD.  Not a lady but so funny is the many time host & surprise guest is Justin Timberlake. Where's his?",1365465600,,510,4.549450549450549
3959206,5,B002NALPLS,I love Amy Poehler and this was the best product if you like her too.  The only thing that I wanted more would be a Tina Fey best of compilation.,1363219200,,145,3.8333333333333335
3959207,3,B002NALPLS,seems to be made from intercutting 3 episodes of SNL. running time is not as long as we expected and quality of the video transfer is not great.,1356739200,,144,4.178571428571429
3959208,5,B002NALPLS,"If you love Amy Poehler you will love this SNL special. It highlights some of her best moments, from Hilary Clinton to Dakota Fanning it never fails to keep you laughing. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is or isn't a fan.",1355184000,,230,4.5
3959209,5,B002NALPLS,What more can I say? It's the BEST of amy poehler.. had me laughing! and it was well priced too!,1341273600,,96,3.85
3959210,5,B002NALPLS,"I loved the Best of Amy Poehler.  Some of the sketches they chose in her Best of, I frowned at, however the commentary between Poehler and Seth Meyers and the highlight reel of her Weekend Update made up for the more questionable sketches they chose.  (You should definitely listen to the commentary if you like commentaries, if not you'll probably be bored and think that you wasted an hour and a half of your life for no reason.)  Highly recommended for fans of Poehler and fans of SNL, this DVD mostly doesn't disappoint.",1331337600,2,524,4.612903225806452
3959211,5,B002NALPLS,"This DVD is good. I'd say 4 stars good. Amy is one of my favorite people and she had some great SNL characters. I was disappointed with the choice of the some of the sketches (for example, Tom Brady or Lindsay Lohan eps would have been funnier choices for Kaitlin...) but the commercials alone really make this a strong compilation.

What brings it to 5 stars for me are the extra features.  If you liked Weekend Update with Seth and Amy, you should watch the DVD again with the commentary. JUST DO IT. It is just Amy and Seth talking about (although usually just over) the sketches. They give some background info (Emily Spivey wrote most of Amy's character sketches with her and then went on to create Up All Night), and mainly a BUNCH of extra laughs.

Highly recommended for a fan of SNL in the 2000's.",1317340800,5,806,4.4324324324324325
3959212,5,B002NALPLS,"Amy Poehler at her best!  Just like the other SNL dvd's, a great collection of her skits.  If you are a fan, you will not be disappointed.",1316476800,,138,4.074074074074074
3959213,4,B002NALPLS,"Poehler had some great moments on SNL and many are here, especially the opener, featuring her very crisp Hillary in full flight. One thing noticeable on this collection is that Amy does tend to use the same lynchpin for many of her funniest impressions: nervous laughter. She's really good at it, but seeing so many of her characters use it takes away some of the magic.

But the lady is funny in general and while never hitting the heights of Hartman, Ferrell or Carvey at their peaks, Poehler's best-of dvd is full of laughs, most of them much kinder than the average acerbic fare on SNL; she's clearly got a truly good heart. The dollar bill skit is a real classic and gets truer every year, sadly (thanks to GS and QE46 for that!). The dvd extras include a commentary of the whole dvd with Amy and Seth Myers, which is a rarity for this series and a treat for any fan of the show. Other extras are two cut skits and five minutes of Weekend Update outtakes, some of which are very funny.

Poehler's is not the best of the SNL star series by a long shot, but like the rest it's well worth watching for the laughs.",1313107200,,1115,4.330143540669856
3959214,5,B002NALPLS,"By far one of the funniest BEST OF SNLs out there.  I have 2 Will Ferrells, 1 Jimmy Fallon, 06/07 and 09/10 and only Jimmy Fallon comes close to be as good as Amy Poehler's!!!  Seriously!!!  All the sketches are great and the out takes are like getting a bonus DVD in itself(Contained on the same disc!)",1297296000,6,303,4.280701754385965
3959215,5,B002NALPLS,"This video is extremely hilarious, although I wish it was longer.  Amy is the best impersonator and can play any character. SNL just isn't the same without her. She's my idol!",1290470400,5,175,4.645161290322581
3959216,1,B002NALPLS,"Amy Poehler in general is quite funny, much of this is related to her keen ability to understand people, allowing her to portray completely off the wall characters in a way that seems all too real- thereby putting her in the female comedy big wigs.  Unfortuantely, this DVD doesn't show that.  The montages in which clips of skecthes are shown are often times funnier than the complete sketches that are.  Often times the ones selected were clearly chosen due to political reasons as if NBC is attempting to make a negative statement about politicians like former president George W. Bush and former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin.  While this is clearly what has happened, after all MSNBC's political bend is very clear the simple truth is that while these skecthes are funny for a brief period of time, after a while they wear on you, and one just skips to the next skecth wondering why another wasn't selected.  Now, I admit that I haven't been impressed and continually let down by SNL for about the last ten years, it's clearly just being phoned in at this point.  But Amy Poehler was one of the few bright spots of the show within the last ten years so I was looking forward to this compilation only to be let down yet once again by ""the new Saturday Night Live.""  I do reccomend to everyone though: watch Amy on Parks and Rec on NBC and just leave this one on the shelf.",1279756800,5,1386,4.564516129032258

8374901,5,B002NALPLS,Super funny. Loved the commentary with Seth Meyers.,1498694400,,51,5.5
8374902,5,B002NALPLS,"A great selection if you love Amy Poehler. Glad to own it at the price I paid, which was about $12 I think. For more than that, I'd want more sketches--but the price point and length were well-chosen, in my opinion. This is the best stuff that I remember, and a few greats that I'd never seen before.",1493337600,,300,4.189655172413793
8374903,5,B002NALPLS,The quality seemed a bit lacking but it's the real Best of Amy Poehler,1482451200,,70,4.071428571428571
8374904,5,B002NALPLS,"A must for lovers of Amy Poehler.  It has a lot of Amy's best characters and sketches, although I agree there could have been a better Kaitlin sketch posted.  The DVD commentary is an absolute must. It has both Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers in a sound booth with the microphone running and it's as great as it sounds.  The DVD extras really make this DVD a 5 star one for me, with the commentary and the blooper reel it's a really neat behind the scenes look at SNL and Amy Poehler.  There are two never before seen sketches (again with commentary) including a great one with Lebron James. Amy was such a great part of SNL history that they easily could have made sequels (hint, hint Lorne) but this one knocks it out of the park.",1472688000,,728,4.291970802919708
