8503723,5,B006S6ERIG,"I have been fortunate during my pregnancy to have Erica as my Pilates instructor, so I wasn't really sure how I was going to motivate to work out when we were recently on vacation with me being on my own. To keep me moving, I bought this video. The video comes with an exercise band and I happened to have weights and an exercise ball, so I was prepared for the workouts. The video is broken down into different segments so I could have chosen to focus on a certain body part if I wanted a more targeted workout. I went through the entire video and found it to be challenging, but effective. A newcomer to Pilates could do this video, or at least do the modified versions. I also loved how Erica herself is pregnant and doing the exercises - it made me feel reassured that her workouts were safe. I would definitely recommend this video to anyone that wants to stay in shape during their pregnancy. I'm 35 weeks and my doctor just told me that my pregnancy is probably going so well in part due to Pilates and that my labor and recovery might be easier as a result of it.",1359158400,2,1071,4.254901960784314
