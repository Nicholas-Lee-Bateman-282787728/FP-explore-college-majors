If something can go wrong, it has or will...Not wanting to spoil it, but we can say that retirement in Spain is NOT going quite the way he & his sister, Dorothy (the great Pat Coombs)...The run time is appx 325 minutes & goes 12 episodes on 2 discs - it makes for a fun day of great comedy...
As with all of my BritComs, this comes from Magic of Movies - top of the line folks here...",1516579200,,513,3.9902912621359223
