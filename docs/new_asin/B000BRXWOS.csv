8455859,3,B000BRXWOS,"I love all of his made for TV/AIP movies. Curse of the Swamp Creature is 2nd only to Zontar the Thing from Venus. Francine York is one of the best looking women ever on film. You might have seen her in the Catwoman costume on an episode of ""Lost in Space"". John Agar lands his plane in the middle of the street (!). And goes to a local bar. He hooks-up with some....won't give away ""the plot"". This version isn't as dark as some other cheap dvd's. Let's hope RetroMedia issues this in better form like they did with Zontar/Eye Creatures. Still,if you find this in a dollar store like I did,Pick it up.",1137628800,7,601,4.280701754385965
