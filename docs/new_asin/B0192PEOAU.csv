7561016,5,B0192PEOAU,"Musicians who had taught their instruments and music to their sons for many, many, generations were silenced by the Taliban.  For 30 years...Lahore, a city that had been the Mecca for music all around the world was silent, its musicians taking menial jobs and reduced to a low caste.
They played in rooms that were soundproofed...they knew the youth that was now used to Western music would not want to hear the traditional sounds, so they brought in jazz to modernize it.
Their rendition of Brubeck's Take5 was heard....They performed with a jazz orchestra in NY...and music is alive again for them.

DO NOT MISS this film.  You will see what we don't see in our films here...I walked out of the theater  with joy and music in my heart...and tears in my eyes.",1468195200,,760,4.649253731343284
7561017,5,B0192PEOAU,"inspired me to listen to more indian music especially the sitar , would watch it again - you cant help
but root for this band of misfit musicians - they are very professional and took something mainstream and made it into their own music .
I was very impressed - and would love to see these guys live ... TERRIFIC BEST DOCUMENTARY OF THE YEAR",1467417600,,342,4.276923076923077
7561018,5,B0192PEOAU,I bought this after reading an article in the newspaper. Lahore in Pakistan used to be a vibrant reknowned centre of the arts. But with the Islamisization of Pakistan the arts were steadily discouraged. Today it is a dwarf of its former self. But there are pockets of resistance. You cannot extinguish art completely. It is what makes us human. You cannot ban music from the human condition. This is the story of how music persists under the most difficult of conditions. Life affirming. Watch it!,1466467200,,497,4.790697674418604

7561021,5,B0192PEOAU,"It's unfair to compare the New York visit of the Sachel Jazz Ensemble to that of Buena Vista Club. Each group comes out of quite different circumstances. The music of Buena Visa Social Club wasn't reviled in Cuba. The classical music of the Sachel Studio musicians certainly was, to the point that they had to reinvent themselves with jazz just to get an audience. They decided to seek listeners from the world outside Pakistan and from those abroad who'll appreciate them. Their conversion is a remarkable process and one that required courage.

Invited by none other than Wynton Marsalis to perform in NYC and the Lincoln Center, they leap into the unknown. My heart went out to them. After the long flight and with only four days to pull it together, they're on the stage before thousands along side veteran, seasoned American jazz musicians. We get a documentarian's view.  I held my breath. The ensemble members were worried as well, but in the end they pull it off.
A rather painful moment comes when Marsalis gently decrees that their sitar player isn't up to the performance. He's replaced by a New York based sitar player. We never learn if this replacement musician is Indian or not, but if he was, insult may have been added to injury.

The film concisely provides the historical and present-day context for what the ensemble is up against. We're given a good glimpse of Lahore. (Note the absence of women. Note Lahore's architecture. Note Pakistan's sectarian violence.)

Thanks to BBC coverage and this Song of Lahore, these very worthy musicians appear to have a real chance at recognition, something tragically lacking in their own home country. This is a group to follow, as it gains momentum and refines its jazz and South Asian fusion.",1464480000,4,1753,4.852842809364549
7561022,3,B0192PEOAU,Interesting but not as good as the Buena Vista Social Club!,1464048000,,59,4.454545454545454
7561023,5,B0192PEOAU,"A beautiful, moving film that is so much more than a music documentary.  Filled with funny, touching moments, and a populated by entertaining band  of musicians, SONG OF LAHORE shows you Pakistan through a different lens while building to a dramatic and cheer-inducing final musical performance.  I highly recommend this documentary.",1463875200,,333,5.490196078431373
7561024,5,B0192PEOAU,"Entertaining and thought provoking documentary that weaves political unrest, musical preservation, and just some great guys.

8743582,5,B0192PEOAU,"This is a daring and brilliant window into the lives of musicians trying to keep their traditions alive in an Islamic society that thinks music distracts people from religion. I thought the makers of the film did a terrific job taking the viewer into the lives of the people in the movie so that we could learn about their culture. Wynton Marsalis was fabulous, a kind and generous man. Excellent work.",1517184000,,402,4.676056338028169
8743583,5,B0192PEOAU,I love the music.  This film shows how musicians can speak a language of their own and communicate through it no matter where they are from and what musical training they have had.,1508889600,,180,4.454545454545454
