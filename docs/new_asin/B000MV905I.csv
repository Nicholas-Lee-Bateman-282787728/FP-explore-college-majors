2750513,4,B000MV905I,"In this video, instructor Mindy Mylrea offers four intermediate-to-advanced toning/strengthening options for the lower body.  Instead of working this area traditionally with heavy weights, she incorporates a different piece of fitness equipment into each segment, thereby working the muscles in unique ways.  I have broken down the four segments of this DVD below.

Medicine Ball, 14 minutes.  Holding a weighted ball, Mindy utilizes a combination of more traditional toning exercises (eg, squats, lunges) with jumps/plyometric moves, producing a strong cardio effect.  Many of the movements are functional in nature, including a one-legged squat with dead lift, lunges performed at various angles (called ""pinwheel"" here), and a twisting jump with the ball between your knees.

Stability Ball, 18.5 minutes.  This segment was performed half in a standing position, half on the floor.  The standing work included squats holding the ball, one-legged squats with one foot on the ball (in various directions), and an inner thigh squeeze.  There was some seated bridge work on the ball and then additional lying bridge work with your feet on the ball--this was so tough that I was unable to complete all of the repetitions.  Some brief seated stretches conclude this segment.

Tubing and Step, 13.5 minutes.  Most of this segment could be performed without the step or substituting another short platform.  Using long handled tubing, Mindy begins standing on the step with the tubing under her feet for squats, eventually addition side-to-side movement and abductions; she drops the tubing for leg swings off either side of the step.  Placing one foot on the step with the tubing under that foot, she does lunges, adding a knee up, leg extension, and then a one-legged dead lift to a back dip.  The final moves involve securing the tubing under the step and then placing the handle over one foot for adduction and extensions; the segment finishes with additional leg swings and standing stretches.

Gliding, 13.5 minutes.  This segment uses Mindy's gliding disks, but you can substitute rags (on smooth flooring) or paper plates (on carpet).  The first 8 minutes is standing work and is very similar to Mindy's previous gliding videos, mainly consisting of squats and lunges.  There are a couple of unique moves here, including a one-legged squat to pick up the disk/raise it overhead and alternate lunges with the heel (rather than the ball of the foot) on the disk.  The floor segment includes bridge work and a front/back slide on your side with final stretches on the floor to finish.

Overall, this video provides some excellent alternate toning options for the lower body.  While some of these exercises may seem easy at first in comparison to heavy weight training, they will target and challenge your muscles in unique ways.  Definitely recommended for anyone who is looking for a change from their usual lower body work.",1178496000,8,2925,5.16348195329087
2750514,4,B000MV905I,"This isn't one of my absolute favourite workouts - I've definately done and seen better, but it's ok and worth trying at least once or twice.

There are three segments all with their own warmups, so you can do only one workout, two or all of them.  In the first segment, you use a medicine ball, and it includes jumps etc.  The second workout uses a stability ball and there are your usual squats and hamstring curls.  In the third, you use an X-ertube (which I don't have but you can do this without) and a step.  This is the harder of the three segments and you concentrate on your glutes.

It's very average and for some reason I just don't find this as motivating or quite as fun as other workouts I've done, and while it's definately worth giving a go, I prefer a Cathe Friedriche workout for lower body.  She pushes you a bit harder.",1151193600,,839,4.305732484076433

8173027,4,B000MV905I,"Being a drummer who focuses more on creating good sound and groove instead of flashy fills, I'm very glad that he has come up with this DVD which discusses how to achieve clean consistent sound and style. I have always wondered how he does his doubles and grooves so clean, now all this are answered in his DVD. He shares how each of his limb executes any required motion to achieve good consistent sound. All of which are rarely shared by drummers out there.

Certainly, what he shares (for eg, his grip) is not THEE WAY, and in fact creates some 'confusion' if you have been following what other well-known drummers have taught. But to me, because I want to achieve that kind of clean consistent sound like he does. So I follow what he teaches.

Overall, it fine-tunes your technique to achieve good clean consistent sound. So if this is what you're looking for, I highly recommend this DVD.",1422748800,2,893,4.575
8173028,5,B000MV905I,"This is a very personal approach to the delivery/instruction, less wooden than Latham's earlier material. Even though a very experience drummer, I still got a lot out of the sections reviewing the basics. The more advanced material is great and a real workout for my brain. Riveting stuff.",1403654400,2,289,5.041666666666667
8173029,5,B000MV905I,"Tons of footage, great ideas about hands, feet and different groove concepts.
Some very cool funk/linear groove concepts, some new orleans and shuffle ideas.
The totally excellent part of the book is the fact that all of the excercise nuggets that
Rick presents in the video are transcribed in a pdf!!! And there are 20 or so drumless playalong
tracks (with ricks take from the video also transcribed!).
Several of Rick's concepts resonated with me, such as ARC (Articulation, Relationship, Consistency).  Very
great ideas.  This DVD has already affected my playing and practice in a positive way!",1368662400,2,597,5.144329896907217

It's beautifully filmed, yet narrated for children.  They wanted to watch it over and over, but unfortunately we had to move on to math!",1326412800,,274,4.666666666666667
8173031,4,B000MV905I,"Very good work from an old cat , no flash licks but simple and effective
and very groovy play...Inspiring...BUT a bad packaging destroyed my second
DVD...it's very easy to happen to anyone. Given that Amazon has been very
demanding now in replacing my item (want to take money  from my card and then refund again !!!!)i advice every one to be careful in multidisc packages.
If you order it anyway and you are fortunate enough to get 3 intact DVDs
you will have a great time watching Mr Latham.",1299196800,3,493,4.53932584269663
8173032,5,B000MV905I,"Rick Latham's DVD as the title suggests, has a great groove & sound from his kit. He explains & demonstrates all grooves very clearly. With the 16 bonus play along tracks you get a chance to jam along after learning the grooves yourself, which is good fun. Also the PDF files are very good.",1283126400,5,290,4.388888888888889
8173033,4,B000MV905I,"Mindy is one instructor I seek for high energy & creative DVD workouts.  She's also the type to make your workout fun as she is very perky and can be chatty.  ALL ABOUT LEGS is all about dynamic moves and suitable for intermediate-advanced levels because the pace is fast, you're working with many types of equipment and the transitions don't waste a second, and her exercises are relatively challenging/advanced.

The four workouts are: Med ball, Stability ball, Tubing & step, and Gliding discs.  Each of these run about 15 minutes, so you can mix and match.  MED BALL section focuses on strength & power with lunges, squats, and jumping.  Modifier is there if you don't want to jump.  The choreography is easy to follow and athletically based.  The challenge move for me was placing the med ball between your knees while twisting side to side.  STABILITY BALL section focuses on balance & coordination. For a challenge: watch out for the bridge series--thank you for the modifier for this!  Her back-ups couldn't even maintain all reps in perfect-Mindy form.  TUBING & STEP, I thought was the most fun, working each leg individually in creative ways calls for balance & stability, while standing on the step.  Lastly, GLIDING DISCS was quite the elegant section , mainly to the music, but was all about elongation and control.  This is the best section for feeling and controlling your stability or else you'll be sliding everywhere.  The pace is slower and you'll work one leg at a time, for the most part.  You'll work standing & supine.  You can substitute paper plates or cloth towels.",1274140800,,1592,4.840740740740741
8173034,3,B000MV905I,"This is my first and will be the only Mindy Mylrea workout. I didn't like her cuing, all seemed rushed,improvised, and I just got too annoyed by all the ""Oh My Gosh!"" she said during the whole workout. It didn't look professional, as if she didn't take it seriously. For an advanced workout I expected more instructions, reminders of posture, breathing, instead she giggles and says OMG all the time.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mindy-Mylrea-All-About-Legs/dp/B000MV905I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mindy Mylrea: All About Legs</a>",1220227200,,577,6.5064935064935066
