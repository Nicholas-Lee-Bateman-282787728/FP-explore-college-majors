7815757,3,6301802802,"This is a made for TV movie done in the era of ""Love Canal."" The film stars Lynda Carter who is a country and western singer. She tortures her child Abbey (Louanne) by making her wear a bad Dutch Boy haircut. Her husband Mike (Dale Robinette) is a private investigator who gets caught investigating the evil chemical company hiding a secret about the waste under the town of Landry, Texas.

When Mike drops out of the picture, Lynda Carter goes Erin Brockovich all over them!

The film quality is not good. I watched the film because it had Lyda Carter bound on the kitchen floor and a certain amount of era camp value from haircuts to cassette tapes. Lynda appears to lip syncs her songs, although she can actually sing. The corporation is clumsy and cliche in its operation, as is the film which made me shake my head at the stuff I used to watch and like. What really caught me off guard was that the mommy and daddy in this film were not divorced, separated, or had outside love interests. A real throw back. In one scene Ronny Cox coerces Lynda Carter to remove her sun glasses so he can see her eyes. Not exactly the way I would have written the scene. I had to laugh.

Most people today will not enjoy this dated film which has not stood the test of time. BTW this cover photo doesn't appear in the film.",1363910400,3,1311,4.3428571428571425

7815760,1,6301802802,"Advertised, this trio of films sounded great.  When in my hands (after purchasing it) the trio turned out to be only the Linda Carter flick.  The vendor refunded the money I paid and apologized. Oh well...",1255478400,,205,4.666666666666667
7815761,5,6301802802,"The Last Song was Lynda's first starring role immediately following her successful portrayal of Wonder Woman.  While she no longer has super powers in this film, she still plays a very strong character who is willing to sacrifice her own safety to find the people responsible for her husband's untimely death and to stop them before thousands of other innocent people are hurt or killed.

Lynda skillfully plays her role and also treats the viewer to 2 songs that were also released simultaneously with the movie.  The title song, ""The Last Song"", shows Lynda's adept ability to sing a slow and haunting melody.  We are also treated to the very upbeat county/western tune, ""What's A Little Love Between Friends"".

This video is a winner, especially for the Lynda Carter fan.  You can also find this movie from time to time on DVD.",1114905600,,830,4.809859154929577
7815762,5,6301802802,"this one one of my favourite Lynda Carter works, it has a story very ahead of its time, very ""Erin Brokovich', eerily so,even. It also has 2 incredible singing performances by Lynda Carter, the most touching being a free and sincere rendering of the title song. This film is a must for Lynda Carter fans.",1016409600,4,304,4.545454545454546
