8425161,5,B004DCATNO,I bought the series as a gift for my teenage cousins who LOVE the show.  Now that they own the DVDs I've been told they watch the seasons on repeat!,1401926400,,148,3.933333333333333
8425162,5,B004DCATNO,"I'm a believer. Here's what I believe: Vampires would not tolerate the destruction of their planet. So there are no vampires, of course. The proof is the dangerously large overpopulation of a planet that can only SUSTAIN 500 million to 1 billion ""productive"" human beings. But don't worry. It's not the END of the WORLD...just us...and soon. Meanwhile I remain a believer in Amazon. At least SOMEONE did something right. Bruce C",1378684800,,428,4.958333333333333
8425163,3,B004DCATNO,"my Sister told me that she wanted me to get into it which i did , I'm a guy who's not usually attracted to romance and horror but they did a decent job with combining the two. I have to say this show is incredible cheesy and i will not watch past season 2 just not interested in the show i would say the show is geared toward teen girls so if your a girl you would probably like this more then a guy would , But remember not everyone is the same this is just not for me.",1377388800,,470,3.757575757575758
8425164,5,B004DCATNO,If you are a fan of this series than this is the place to buy them. So much cheaper than any where else. Very happy with mine. 8),1376438400,,129,3.642857142857143
8425165,2,B004DCATNO,Like the above guy said don't pay $63 for both season of this packaged in blu ray. When you can purchase season 1-3 blu ray also and region free get the extra season and still save money of amazon. Also if you just wanted season 1-2 blu ray I would not pay the $63 considering I already purchased season 1-2 blu ray and only paid $46 and this was back in January.,1369612800,,363,4.055555555555555

8425167,5,B004DCATNO,"Both seasons 1 & 2 collected together, great idea, I don't know what the other guy's complaining about.  Good show for vampire fans.",1353974400,,132,4.739130434782608
8425168,2,B004DCATNO,"My rating is for Amazon's genius idea to buy these together for that outrageous price when you can buy them separately for 20 bucks each...
The show is great on the otherhand. Lots of action and what's not to love about Ian Somerhalder?
Seriously though, save your money and buy them separately...",1347753600,8,297,4.730769230769231
