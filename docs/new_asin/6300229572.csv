7806994,4,6300229572,"An influential (in it's time), inventive 30 minute black and white
short that examined an 'Ed TV' like idea way before others did. A woman
has her life secretly filmed, edited and shown to a laughing audience
each week. Far more surreal and stylized than the features and TV shows
that later used this concept, it's stylish, a lot of fun and effectively
creepy. On the other hand, the acting is amateurish, production values
nonexistent, and the post dubbed sound is pretty awful. But somehow,
that homemade quality sort of works with the story. Worth seeing if you
have any interest in the semi-experimental late 60s cinema that
combined what would have been sleaze with far more artistic aspirations
(Brian DePalma, Bartel, Jonathan Demme and many others were part of this
art/exploitation film trend).",1328918400,,804,5.007462686567164
7806995,4,6300229572,"This short feature hits paranoid adolescent insecurities with manic humor.  Similar plots have been filmed since, but I think the sentiment was best done in this concise manner.  Of the 30+ films I saw in a college film class in 1973, this was the one that still comes to mind most often.  The only possible negative is that the low-technology (it is old and low-budget) may make it harder to engage currently young viewers.  Also, I would recommend skipping the introductory interview with the director.
For this price though, it's definitely worth sharing.",999388800,2,558,4.967741935483871
7806996,4,6300229572,Now get this: After some very strange incidents happened to her a young girl is convinced that her life is being filmed and seperated into various chapters (!) and after some further accidents the young woman's paranoia is proofed to be true (Thomas Pynchon eat your heart out !). This little known underground classic from Paul Bartel (my he rest in peace !)contains some very odd perfomances and really bizarre ideas (I won't tell you more !). It is one of the few films were the viewer is so much involved into the story that one cannot tell anymore what's real or just imagination. So along with the main character we explore this fantastic and almost surreal world together. A real sleeper and definitely worth a look !,998265600,2,724,4.6640625
