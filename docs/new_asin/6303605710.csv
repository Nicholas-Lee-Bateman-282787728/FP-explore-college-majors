687344,1,6303605710,"i was at first excited to see the movie because it looked semi-promising, but i absolutely hated it. i don't dislike alicia, but i'm not a big fan of her and she had absolutely no personality in this movie whatsoever. i know  what the director was trying for, and they did not accomplish it at all.  there was no background, no plot, and too much of a depressing setting. the  thing that annoys me is it could have been good and the idea behind it was  good, but the carry-out totally missed the target. the ending was not built  up enough, and there was no reason for what happened. it also never  explained why alicia didn't want to see her b/f (the football kid with the  glasses)or why she was mad at him, which was an ridiculously underdeveloped  side plot. no offense to any fans of it, but i do not recommend this movie  at all, unless you like underdeveloped themes and characters, or unless you  are a HARDCORE alicia fan (which i am not, so it made the movie that much  worse).",963187200,7,987,4.33879781420765

Occurring at first with momentary confusion are spliced mental moments, imaginings of a character, intertwined with images about a given scene. By using this technique, the imagination of each character serves an important storytelling element highlighting the subsequent parallel action. In a scene, always, what a character imagines contrasts what actually happens. What is imagined would culminate in wish fulfillment if what is imagined occurs. This narrative technique reveals secreted elements of the characters psyche. In this way, authentic aspects of a character's nature are revealed. Thus, you are shown important psychological complication making both the character and scene complex.

687558,3,6303605710,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Believe it or not long ago there was no Lifetime network not to mention Lifetime Movies Network. Back in the day if you wanted to watch a movie that involved somewhat psycho spouses or troubled teens attempting to murder someone you did like most people did when it came to movies, you waited for one of those films to hit the local theater. That was the case with this film.

The movie stars then hot commodity Alicia Silverstone just off of the success of the film CLUELESS. Here she plays Jennifer, the babysitter for the Tucker family. On her way to sit for the Tuckers shes approached by Mark (Nicky Katt), an old boyfriend who still has the hots for her even though they parted some time back and shes seeing someone new. She tells him to buzz off and heads for the Tuckers.

Jennifer gets to the Tuckers and starts to play with the kids while Dolly Tucker (Lee Garlington) finishes getting ready and telling her husband Harry (J.T. Walsh) to hurry up. Harry comes downstairs sans pants looking for them and gets a disapproving look from Dolly. It seems that Harry has the hots for the babysitter just like Mark does. Eventually the couple finish dressing and head out to a party.

Next we find Mark at the local diner where he comes across Jack (Jeremy London), Jennifers new boyfriend. Unfortunately for Jack he and Jennifer have recently had a fight and hes looking for a way to spend time with her. With a little encouragement from Mark (as well as a few beers) he talks him into calling and asking her if he can come over. She turns him down and Mark offers to drive him over anyway.

Cut to the party the Tuckers went to hosted by none other than Marks father Bill (George Segal). As the night progresses Harry begins to have fantasies about what he would do with Jennifer given the opportunity, everything from catching her with her boyfriend to finding her in the bathtub. The more he drinks, the more he insists he needs to go home for whatever reason. At the same time Dolly is drinking fast and furious as well and having her own fantasies about Bill.

Eventually all of these stories come to across one another and in the end a tragic event occurs. But until that time the movie is played more for minor giggles and teases in the various fantasies that almost all involved seem to have non-stop. Even the young pre-teen Tucker boy being babysat has thoughts of Jennifer in the bathtub.

Chances are when this film was released the anticipation of young teens hoping to catch a glimpse of Silverstone undressed were what drove them to theaters. Not enough did so to have this movie become a money-maker and thats probably because word got out she was never seen nude. A quick glimpse of a waitress with Mark in a fantasy offered the only nudity and it was brief.

If this is the sort of movie you like, if you're a big Lifetime network fan then youll have fun with this one as well. Its not really a bad movie at all but its nothing spectacular either. Fans of Silverstone will want to pick it up to have a blu-ray copy on hand. The rise of her career petered out shortly after this and she went on to relatively smaller films before becoming an animal rights activist. So pick up a copy, have a beer or two and then share your own Silverstone fantasies if you like. They may be as amusing as this movie.",1441065600,2,3377,4.444264943457189

687674,3,6303605710,"Perhaps the movie writers wanted to put a spin on the classic ""babysitter gets into trouble"" storyline, but then again, maybe it's all just a trick by the writers to get teens to watch what more often than not morphs into strong sexual content.

It's about Alicia Silverstone's character playing the role of a babysitter.  Well... what happens next caught me by surprise, and not in a positive way either.

From here, we're introduced to 3 different men who obviously want in Alicia's pants VERY badly.

The first one is apparently her nerdy boyfriend who isn't on the best terms with Alicia at the moment (hence the reason she needs time away from him), a greasy-haired arrogant punk who hangs around the nerdy boyfriend and attempts to befriend him ONLY because he too wants in Alicia's pants, and the father of the kids Alicia is babysitting who goes to a party and fantasizes about Alicia while drunk.

The ENTIRE MOVIE is nothing but a HUGE sexual fantasy involving the 3 characters I mention above and the many different ways they'd like to have sex with the poor, vulnerable babysitter.  Everything from making out with Alicia in the bathtub, to thinking about Alicia getting caught making out with another man and having her be punished as a result, to... *anything* that involves sex or making out.  It's honestly quite disturbing, not to mention doesn't exactly make for quality storytelling, hence the 3 stars out of 5 I'm giving the film.

If that's not bad enough, later on even MORE characters fantasize about Alicia!  Yes she's an attractive girl but come on, this is borderline pathetic.  Of course the BIGGEST problem here is that it's hard to tell the difference between what is fantasy and what is really occuring.  Many times it's confusing figuring out the difference between the two.

Overall, it's not much of a movie to be perfectly honest, because one sexual fantasy leading into another is not really compelling enough to recommend, however I suppose we can look at it from another perspective and realize that the movie writers were probably going for a slight spin on the typical babysitter storyline so... still, the final result is a mediocre movie.",1325116800,,2179,4.84366576819407

687736,2,6303605710,"Every movie has it's strengths and its weaknesses, whether it be the plot, special effects etc. in this film we have a semi- interesting plot about a young babysitter named Jennifer (played by Alicia Silverstone) she begins her day by going to school and of course end's it by babysitting at night. That is pretty much the initial plot; the rest is bunch of fantasies from different men who want to be with her. As mentioned earlier every movie has its strength and weakens and in this case it's weakness is plot development. The story never really reaches its point it just simply jumps from a scenario in which Jennifer is babysitting and answering calls to ludicrous dream world where her seductive look captivates them. Sure enough the movie does have some good moments such as the baby sitter's boyfriend being convinced by a wrong source that she is cheating on him. This of course leads him to investigate and stock our fellow protagonist ""the babysitter"". But ultimately the good moments are once again ruined by the painfully boring and simply stupid fantasy scenes. i only recommend it if you're a fan of Alicia Silverstone's work other than that pass it.

687739,1,6303605710,"Watching this movie is similar to reading a term paper with no thesis statement.  After the ending, you begin to understand what the writers were (maybe) trying to accomplish, but choppy editing throughout the movie only makes the viewer think that the several fantasy sequences revolving around Silverstone's character are only planted in the film to obscure the writers lack of imagination with regard to character development.
In retrospect, the Babysitter (Silverstone) is supposed to be like Helen of Troy.  Men will risk thier families, jobs and freedom to sleep with her.  Among the people who want Alicia are her ex (?) boyfriend and a manipulative wanna-be-a-gangster suburban rich boy, who drunkenly conspire a plan to spy on her.  The manipulative rich kid dupes the ex into breaking and entering the house where Silverstone is babysitting then tries to rape her. Nuff said about the plot.
Two things make the plot unbelievable.  First of all, Silverstone, taken as THE sole motive for a host of fantasies (some related and some utterly unrelated to the ending) and a rape attempt is not buyable.  In reality, Silvertone is no Helen of Troy, but yet another link of good-looking hollywood sausage.  More importantly, in the movie, her character is unexciting, bland and (ahem) clueless.
Secondly, the antagonist rich hood's rape attempt is paradoxical.  He has sense enough to manipulate the Babysitter's boyfriend like an expert (a la Cruel Intentions), yet the during the last scene of the movie he smashes lamps on peoples heads and tries to rape Alicia in front of 2 small children.  Any criminologist could tell you that most psychotics are usually not silver-tounged manipulators and vice versa.
On a final note, the writers could have used some of the time they spent on the fantasy sequences to develop the characters' backgrounds and motives.  At least then the film might not have been such a pile of garbage.",1088380800,4,1930,5.040880503144654

687742,3,6303605710,"Robert Coover's 1969 short story ""The Babysitter"" (included in his ground-breaking collection ""Pricksongs and Descants"") is a masterpiece of postmodern short fiction.  The beauty of the story was its ambiguity and the way truth and fantasy seamlessly blended into each other until the reader is left completely unable to discern between reality and fantasy.
While this film adaptation blends the characters' fantasies with reality, it ultimately settles on a solid reality for its ending.
The other problem that many viewers may have is that there really isn't a whole lot that happens in the film, and while this is directly from the story, it doesn't make for much of a cinematic experience.
Ultimately, this is probably for two groups of people: hardcore Alicia Silverstone fans (her performance in the film is decent) and hardcore Robert Coover fans (there have to be some others out there).  Other than that, this film doesn't have much to offer.",1017878400,25,951,5.129032258064516

7851168,4,6303605710,"this is a good movie on psychological mind games among teens. Also what both teens(and a pre-teen) and adults fantasize about teen girls. while this did not per say go into 1st degree pedophila  with the pre-teen it sort of went 2nd degree with the adults. also this one of the more sexualized Alicia Silverstone movies out there. although not unheard of but rare to see this although the scenes are brief.

 the ending is somewhat confusing.",1483920000,,442,4.714285714285714
