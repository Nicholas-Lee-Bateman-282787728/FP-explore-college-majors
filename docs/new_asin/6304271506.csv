818590,5,6304271506,"This is the hysterical and darkly comical odyssey of two Londoners who ""go on holiday by mistake."" They meet outrageous and believable characters, get into all sorts of bizarre and believable situations. Many great one liners in the film. The kind of movie you want to keep going.  Remarkable, dramatic ending reveals the continuity of the plot. Has a good beginning, middle and end--just what Aristotle required of drama. Great soundtrack too--Hendrix, Procol Harum, more. I've seen it countless times and have nearly memorized the dialogue I think. Strong Brit accent required me to rewind some parts a couple of times to get the point.

818713,4,6304271506,"Another Amazon reviewer called this an 'R-rated English version of 'The Odd Couple'. That works, but I tend to think of it as a postmodernist nod to the most enduring brotherhood of mismatched flatmates in all of literature: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson--if Holmes and Watson were, instead of Victorian gentlemen, a couple of unemployed, rigorously unhygienic, alcoholic wanna-be actors residing (one is hesitant to call it 'living) in Camden Town, London, circa 1969. Our narrator (only known as 'I') has been marginally more successful in their shared occupation: he's got an audition. Withnail has an agent, whom he regularly screams abuse at down the phone over this personage's threats to quit, since 10% of nothing is *really* nothing.

Our story such as it is opens on a very typical morning in our duo's squalid flat. Both are nursing monstrous hangovers and a pathological fear of what appears to be growing in the kitchen sink, buried under a mountain of dirty dishes. Withnail moans that he might actually have died in the night, while with the same breath bemoaning the lack of any more alcohol in the house. The pile of past-due notices has grown too threatening to comfortably ignore any longer. So our lads do what any self-respecting pair of blokes who had attended top schools to absolutely no avail would do: Flee the premises to further procrastinate on the dual housekeeping/bills conundrum. Convinced that a sojourn in the bucolic countryside will be just the thing to 'rejuvenate' them and get their artistic juices flowing, Withnail drags I to see Uncle Monty (short for Montague) (Griffiths), who owns a rustic cottage in Penwith, Cornwall. Uncle Monty is very fond of the lads, and seems particularly taken with his nephew's flatmate. Key in hand, the boys hit the road, open bottle in hand and only one headlight actually functioning and drive down to the cottage.

They arrive with neither food nor money for provisions and during the deluge of the century. It seems to rain constantly in this part of the country and neither has thought to bring their wellies (or, in fact, own any wellies) necessitating that they tramp around the muddy fields wearing plastic food wrappers tied to their feet. Their neighbors are not inclined to be at all welcoming or helpful, despite their best efforts to assure everyone that they are decidedly *not from London!*

Life in the country is not so idyllic after all, when there's no heat and one is forced to kill and pluck one's own supper (extremely badly). Then Uncle Monty turns up, and there is a shortage of bedrooms, oh, my . . .

Bruce Robinson's semi-autobiographical sketch of his own salad days as a young and struggling show business type in the London of the '60s made an instant star of Richard E. Grant, in his first movie role, and has become a cult favorite. The flamboyantly self-assured/narcissistic yet charismatic Withnail evokes a prototype of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock with his effusive-bordering-on manic manner, long signature coat, scarf, penchant for substance abuse and, of course, the Hair. Paul McGann (who would go on to become the Eighth Doctor) is the soulful, hapless accomplice and narrator of these picaresque events . . a man who was well-brought up and often at uncomfortable internal odds over how they are living, but nevertheless inexorably drawn to the magnetic, self-destructive force that is his flatmate, despite his better judgment.

Our boys return to London, having survived their adventure in rusticity but otherwise having pretty much learned nothing. And that's pretty much how life goes, innit?

I first watched this film 30 years ago, at a little arthouse theatre in Chautauqua, NY. I was 21 years old, and most definitely a neophyte at this sort of off-kilter British cinema, a milieu I have certainly become more familiar and comfortable with in the intervening years. I was a sheltered suburban girl attending a Presbyterian college at the time, and my initial reaction to this movie was that it was one of the more debauched and disturbing things I had seen. I did not Get It--I couldn't look past the squalor (intentional) and the copious drinking (also intentional--Withnail drinks what appears to be lighter fluid at one point, with no ill effects), to see the comedy and the rank charm of the piece. Viewing it now, 30 years on, its excesses seem very mild. I'm significantly further along in my drinking than I was back then, too, and while Withnail and his buddy certainly consume copious amounts of alcohol, still, it is no more than is generally consumed in one episode of 'Mad Men'. No hard drugs are on the scene either. The boys do receive a visit from their spliff dealer at the beginning, but seeing as they have no money to pay him and he threatens them with violence over it, no actual dope is smoked in the course of this film. Many, many cigarettes, though. As for the state of the boys' flat and in particular the kitchen, which grossed me out so majorly--I have now seen worse. My own flat qualifies as worse at this point. And now that I am 20+ years older than our actors were at the time (both 29), they have ceased to look like dangerous, worldly older types and now just look incredibly young. This is what the passage of 30 years will do to one's movie criticism.

If you are nostalgic for the swingin' '60s, you will get a bit of that here, but mostly I think of 'Withnail & I' as a paeon to its own time, the mid-1980s, that New Wave age when if young men were Angry, it is most likely because they were coked up and their hair was too big. It will make you smile at the absurdity of the human condition, and that's something we all need to do now and then.",1480896000,2,5717,4.768686868686869

818793,3,6304271506,"Withnail and I is one of my favorite films, easily five stars. I love the dark comedic undertone that broods under this decidedly English tale of two lost actors living a life of poverty and drug abuse in London.

The Blu-ray, however, appears to be an upscale of the original DVD source and provides nothing more over the DVD release, other than slightly richer color palette and richer soundtrack. The picture quality is blurry and noisy. The noise in particular is very disheartening as it is not film grain, but rather a muddy upscale of shifting encoding blocks. The noise is especially pronounced in blacks and mid tones and is readily apparent that they did not get a fresh transfer, but instead used their aging transfer they which they upscaled from their DVD release.

Lastly, after rubbing my eyes and thinking that this must be some mistake, I took a look at the Blu-ray media folder on my computer, which confirmed my fears, the entire BD disc is 15.8GB. While size does not always denote quality, in this case it does. The picture is so soft that the film fits will within one layer of a Blu-ray disc.

Personally, I'm going to sell my copy and wait for a Criterion release with a newer transfer. This simply does not cut it for my eyes.

Two unemployed actors in a decaying flat in a decaying part of London talk a wealthy relative into letting them use his rustic cottage for the weekend. I won't say hilarity ensues, even though much of the movie is outrageously funny, because there is an edge of desperation throughout this character-driven story. Withnail (Richard E. Grant in his screen debut) is a laser-eyed, somewhat ghoulish borderline genius whose bad habits are starting to get the better of him; Marwood (Paul McGann), his sidekick and sometime patsy, may be the less talented of the two, but he's more grounded and nowhere near as close to the edge as Withnail, Richard Griffiths (later to earn fame as Harry Potter's nasty uncle) has some savory scenes as Withnail's orotund (and rotund) Uncle Monty.",1404950400,2,873,4.945578231292517

818983,5,6304271506,"There are few films that manage to deliver consistent, hearty laughs, be eternally quotable, but also be driven by an emotional core that is honest and sincere in a way that few movies can be. The film stars Paul McGann (Alien 3) and Richard E. Grant (Hudson Hawk) in the roles that would begin their film careers. Set in 1969, Withnail (Grant) and Marwood (McGann) are two struggling actors living in squalor in a London flat. Desperate to escape their dreary environment, the two set out to the English countryside for a bit of a holiday, only to immediately discover that they will fare no better in the cottage of Withnail's Uncle Monty (Harry Potter's Richard Griffiths). There is very little here in the way of an overall plot, instead Bruce Robinson's film aims more to serve as a sort of tribute to an old friend. The script (also penned by Robinson) and the character of Withnail was very much inspired by Robinson's flighty, alcoholic friend Vivian. The love and admiration Robinson holds for his (now deceased) friend is very much evident throughout, even though Withnail is mostly around to consume ghastly amounts of alcohol and otherwise act like an booze-addled twit.

And therein lies the remarkable achievement of Withnail & I. It's a film that could have been quite surface-level indeed, little more than a silly romp as two drunks flounder about in the countryside out of their element. And yet thanks to the heartfelt work by Robinson and the astounding performance by Grant, we have a film that has a heart and energy that is unique unto itself.

Incredible to think it more than thirty years old, Withnail and I is many things, not least a permanent tribute to George Harrison's perspicacity and financial generosity.

819246,4,6304271506,"""Withnail & I"" is the kind of droll British comedy that is loved by some and goes completely over the heads of most others. With that said, I'm sure you already know just which group you belong to. I find myself in the former, and yet, I will also admit that ""Withnail & I"" can be very trying even to me, it's also very, very funny. The movie's biggest draw back is in it's main characters, who I would never for a moment refer to as heroes, they are not particularly likable, in fact, often they are down right unlikable.

The story is set in the 1960's, and follows the misadventures of two struggling actors, Withnail (Richard E. Grant) & I (Paul McGann), who as the movies begins are in a state of major despair over their lack of employment, lack of booze and more lack of booze. Fleeing their flat, possibly because their dirty dishes have backed up to the point that McGann's ""& I"" believes that they have taken on a life of their own, or at least are harboring some sort of life form. Withnail convinces his Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths) into lending them his cottage in the countryside, once their they discover things to be no better, perhaps even a different kind of worst.

The movie works in no small part thanks to director Bruce Robinson's dryly witty script, I almost think it would read better than it plays out as a film, in fact I could imagine a continuing series of novels or stories about the adventures of withnail & I. The performances, though, are the real key to this film's success. Richard E. Grant is the ideal actor to portray Withnail, he's arrogant, obnoxious, cynical, manipulative and completely unapologetic about it, it's in his manner of bringing Withnail to life that's make it work so well, he's a jerk and I sure wouldn't to be his friend, but god help me, their is something loveable and wonderful about him. The other great performance in the movie belongs to Richard Griffiths, a great British character actor perhaps best known today for his role as Uncle Vernon in the Harry Potter franchise, here he plays the lovable, eccentric and flamboyantly gay Uncle Monty. Griffith infuses his character with great humor and tenderness, even when threatening to bugger McGann. Paul McGann, the least remember actor to portray Doctor Who, has the thankless role portraying the most likable character in the film, thus being the dullest and least interesting.

Some people swear by this film, some people I respect very much do so, but I am not one of them. I laughed a lot, I like the actors and the script, but I just couldn't ever work up enough kind feeling for these people. Much of the movie is filmed in medium shots as if to keep the viewer at a distance, but I'm not sure I really would have wanted to be any closer to these two.",1334275200,2,2774,4.544

819393,4,6304271506,"This British cult classic is adapted from writer Bruce Robinson's unpublished novel where the script takes on a somewhat autobiographical role detailing Robinson's life in London during the the 1960's.

  Meet Withnail, (Richard E Grant) and his friend ""I"" (Paul McGann) ; two struggling unemployed actors living in a horrid flat in London during the 1960's. Withnail is a loud, cowardly, deeply pessimistic, obnoxious and selfish alcoholic, but highly entertaining no less. Meanwhile, I is completely tolerant, reticent and reasonable not only with Withnail but most of the other fellow Londoners too. Like Withnail, he also likes his dose of the bottle but does exercise a little more forbearance. Upon realizing their horrible living conditions and need for employment they decide to visit Uncle Monty; a raging intellectual homosexual with a fine taste for the bottle too and a fine appreciation of the liberal arts as well. Withnail uses his skillful persuasion to convince Uncle Monty to lend him his key to his beautiful cottage in the countryside.  When Withnail secures the key, he and his friend delve off into the countryside but soon find out how little prepared they are for the getaway, well, at least for I anyway; a desolate cottage with a few nearby farm animals and a strange rural neighbor is quite a change indeed. As food and alcohol prove to be a difficult task to fulfill their high demands, the savior Uncle Monty makes an unexpected appearance during the middle of the night only to frighten the day lights out of Withnail while he quivers in I's bed. (A very funny scene) It is here where Withnail takes a complete enjoyment of Uncle Monty's company so long as the fine wine and food is replenished daily; however, I is left with Uncle Monty's homosexual advances that are quite amusing. Witnail is aware of this and misleads Monty into believing I is a repressed homosexual that cannot face society's ridicule. This subsequence confrontation is hilarious and worth many viewings. Unfortunately, for I, his brief stay in the countryside is just as miserable as it was in London. The confrontation between I and Monty is the last straw. Withnail and I leave at once and return to London where I discovers he has been called for an audition.

The film is worth multiple viewings (No diminishing returns I can rest assure you) and the film is definitely a keeper in anyones film library. Although the film is entertaining and quite likable, I do agree with a reviewer's opinion of the conflicting comparison between Withnail and the real life character he is based on (Vivian McKerrell). If one were to read the supplement notes carefully in the Criterion booklet one will realize how the real life person portrayed on screen are at complete odds with each other. Bruce Robinson paints a very different portrait of Vivian who seems very charismatic and likable, or as he states in the notes, "" His company alone was worth any crime"". Unlike Vivian, Withnail is anything but charismatic or socially likable but very selfish and cowardly, but still highly entertaining. Like the other reviewer posted, Bruce Robinson seemed to take one aspect of Vivian, (Borderline Alcoholism) and render this flaw as the main entertaining force through Wihnail's character in the entire film. Don't get me wrong, the character is still highly entertaining and it didn't strike me as a detraction from the film's humor. But what I think maybe an issue is the fact that Vivian's character may have been potentially short changed on screen. I still think Richard E Grant did a fantastic job and the film holds up in my view.",1324598400,3,3627,4.92962356792144

Richard Grant is ""Withnail"" and ""I"" is Paul McGann. This was Grant's first film and helped launch his successful career. The movie is mostly an autobilographical story about Bruce Robinson's own life. Robinson was an actor himself, and played the role of Benvolio in Zeffirelli's film ""Romeo and Juliet""(1968).

Despite the obviously autobiographical character, the film reflects the vicissitudes, and adventures viscitudes two young actors who live unemployed waiting for a call to realize their dreams.

The British humor could not miss, rainy weather and cloudy in every exterior shot is another player more in this devastating story.

The novelty of the film is not only wanders through the inner psyche of both protagonists, but it lurks, inquiries and searches to various sectors of society. It ranges from the big city to a village of farmers and the result is the same. But it also looks back on Withnail's uncle, a solitary man, homosexual, who lives surrounded by a nostalgic grandeur that no longer exists.

Finally, in the final sequence after returning to London is fraught with a strong existentialist. return to his room and found the other youth sector, drunk and haunted by chemical devices where evasion is preferable to action.

At turns pathetic, hilarious, witty, and disturbing, the two actors are truly wonderful.  In a masterful performance, Richard Grant established his reputation as an eccentric Englishman with this film.  While this is a black comedy, it is also completely believable.

Frazzled with the city life, they decide they need to take a vacation in the wintry countryside, securing the permission of Withnail's obese, lascivious uncle, who has designs on the young Marwood (who serves as narrator).  Once they arrive without food or fuel, they are shocked at the primitive conditions they find; the countryfolk are taciturn and unreceptive to their antics, but this doesn't stop them from getting loudly drunk in local pubs and insulting anyone more straight-laced than them.  Upon the arrival of the uncle, Marwood is relentlessly accosted until he lies (or so I think) his way out of his clutches.  They return to the chaos in London and finally part.

Grant as the besotted Withnail but not enough to get it over the hump.  I admire the film for it's ambition but ultimately it falls short in execution.",1297468800,2,663,4.483333333333333
819501,3,6304271506,"With the suspicion of rodents in the sink, Withnail surrenders to the magical powers of booze to warm himself in his disturbingly chaotic apartment. If proper care was to be taken of Withnail and his friend, simply called I, they would be best placed in quarantine out of safety for other Londoners; for their sloppiness has lead to unbearable, depressing conditions which demands that they leave London and venture to the countryside for a short holiday.

Withnail & I treads along by displaying Withnail's gay, eccentric Uncle Monty and the trouble that the two have to encounter to get his country cottage-though much of the trouble has yet to hit them. With much turbulence, such as bad weather, they reach their destination safely, thinking their vacation is bound to take a turn for the best. However, as they become familiar with their whereabouts, they find that they have chosen the wrong location to alleviate all their inner-city turmoil. From hunger and fear of death, the men encounter variant other issues that make this as unpleasant a vacation as it possibly could have become. Only a visit from a familiar face could have turned this vacation to the travesty it should have been. Not only is this granted, but includes hilarious episodes of mischief that makes I's planned vacation as distressing as life was in his crummy apartment.

Withnail & I is off-beat even for an English comedy, rarely offering jokes and rather reaping the benefits of its comedy from the two diverse characters, and the talented actors portraying them. The characters are similar in their interests and their profession, but much different in their temperament. I is a mild-mannered, shy actor while Withnail is an out-of-control, capricious, emotional, drunk persona who unlike I has completely been unsuccessful in his acting career as of late. With such characters, Bruce Robinson can easily profit from their back and forth dialogue and not be forced to resort to cheap gags to produce a few laughs. As funny as the dynamic between Withnail and I may be, it is limited when compared to the physical comedy of Uncle Monty in regards to I which is among one of the most amazingly, laughter-inducing conversations between straight and gay men in films in recent memory. There also a few gags that still seem both creative and funny, such as the one involved in the cooking of a rooster which is horrifyingly cruel and audaciously realistic.

Writer/Director Bruce Robinson has said that I is based on himself while Withnail is based on Vivian MackKerrell whom he shared a house with. In the supplemental booklets, included in the Criterion Edition, Robinson states that even though as an actor or writer the real Withnail ( MackKerrell) did not have the passion or interest to be successful, ""Vivian was brilliant at being Vivian. That was his genius, and everyone who ever met him was overwhelmed by it...his company was worth the price."" And in these few sentences lies the entire folly of the film. Vivian MackKerrell's charm can be understood or granted, but Withnail's cannot. It is wise of Robinson to admit that ""there isn't a line of Viv's in the Withnail & I, but his horrible wine-stained tongue may as well have spoken every word. Without Viv, this story could never have been written."" The issue with Bruce Robinson film is that he has Vivian's drunken and infatuation with alcohol deeply rooted in Withnail, but has been unable to translate Vivian's charm on screen. It is unseemly why anyone would want to even remotely tolerate Withnail's drunken tantrums and tirades, his pessimism, disregard for the emotions and wishes of others, and basically buffoonery in all the serious aspects of adulthood. Of course, there are people who have such characteristics, but with a certain appeal that makes them intriguing to be around. Unfortunately, Withnail lacks that quality and it seems odd that I has tolerated him for so long-and still continues to do so-even after the events during and after the holiday. Many alcoholics are interesting people to be around because besides drinking they seem to have other interests and insights, but Withnail is in the purest sense of the word an alcoholic without any redeeming qualities.

This entertaining film treads along nicely, never tiring or boring its audience, but after some time it becomes a realization that this is no coming-of-age film nor is it attempting to blossom gracefully or offer any additional insight about relationships, alcoholism, and English culture of the late 60. No, the film is simply Robinson's template for testing his writing chops and paying a tribute to one of his dear friends. Withnail & I has often been cited as one of the best British films of the last twenty five years which, if true, would seem proof of England's demising film Industry in the face of usually more apt American films. An overrated classic as it may be, Richard E Grant's breakout performance as Withnail, and Robinson's problematic but effective screenplay make Withnail & I a heartfelt effort.

It was a bit murky and I could barely understand the dialect.  But after almost 24 years, and several trips to London, I love the film now more than ever.

I had returned from a trip to London in '03, and became reacquainted with the film during a few cold rainy days of repeats on some cable channel as I was recovering from my trip, and the depression that often follows. I'm really not sure why I like the films plot other than it's a snapshot in the life of two out of work actors, and the soggy adventure they have over a weekend spent at a country cottage owned by Withnail's Uncle Monty.  A couple of other interesting characters lend interest and humour at the end of the film, and serve to underscore the last year of the 1960's.  It is a very nostalgic and funny look into that period when England was suffering economically, and the drugs movement was still so predominant.  The dialogue is classic, and the music is perfect for the somber and yet humorous tone, especially the score.  The ending is perfect, and I'm not sure what Richard Grant's character is quoting, but it does the job.  However, if one isn't accustomed to British English, he or she might have to put on the closed caption and curl up sometime with a book of British slang and expressions.

Beneath the delirium inspired banter and gorgeous photography lies the insatiable need for direction in a world outfitted with trivial forks in the road.  Mainly written as an auto-biographical response to his days as a struggling actor, Bruce Davison condenses that untapped sense of frightful wonderment into a non-linear epic that converts even the most irrational Holiday into an unmistakable need for order, security, fulfillment.

Feeling trapped in your apartment.  Fishing with guns.  Demanding animal flesh for dinner.  Roaming around the green fields of Cumbria.  Demanding to know why onions have been poisoned.  Throwing yourself into the road.  Walking through the zoo in the rain to say goodbye.

From the outside, an initial reaction may be to change gears... but all of this chaos culminates in an amazing journey where you're left wondering ""what really happened to Withnail and Marwood (I)?""

An absolute gem.",1284854400,,1461,5.3464912280701755

[1] Richard E Grant's autobiography shows his life was not entirely unlike this film, though he was luckier than Withnail - this film had the same effect LOTR had on Elijah Wood. Grant did the filmic version of dining out on it forever after.

The plot barely exists: 'resting' actor gets a part, his friend doesn't. Grant got the part presumably because of his ability to act a sort of decayed English aristocrat - actor's voice, piercing blue eyes, tall upright posture - with good manners if he wants to switch them on. His indignation on being slighted - ""how DARE you!"" - is made absurd by his lack of power. ""I've only had a few ales!"" - ""Look here, my cousin's a QC!"" Faced with a difficult situation, paralysing fear floods up inside him.

[2] The other characters are minor, and in their way reflect decline: his friend, 'I', seems to me utterly uninteresting as an actor. Richard Griffiths as the queer uncle - books, cat, stuffed settee, Schubert, token theatricals, and 'the Dane' - lives on money of unspecified source, possessor of capital with no aim in life - unless you count trying to bugger young men without checking whether they're interested. The Camberwell carrot chap reflects a part of that era - the silly business ideas, the weird UFO style ideas such as razor blades sharpened by pyramids, the drugs. The pointless rural types have lifestyles which are 'irrelevant' to everything - no wonder the word 'irrelevant' became intransitive. The absurd immigrant, black Jamaican I think, courtesy of Heathrow, makes inappropriate chants of ""rama"" (possibly to save money contractually). The alcoholic pub owner with no doubt fake quarter-century old second world war memories. All are at sea while the political and economic vultures circle. They have no interest in the external world. Angus Wilson's novels showed 1950s British intellectuals saying nothing much, and this was acute observation. Certainly it applies here.

[3] The film has a claustral feeling, of money saved by maximising interior shots. The built environment where it's shown is universally decrepit. The lincrusta in the hall below the dado rail looks absurd. A wrecking ball scene shows Victorian brick houses being demolished. The pubs are seedy; the greasy spoon is seedy; the people if possible seedier. The 'Mother Red Cap' must presumably have been genuine, though I don't recall it, its IRA graffiti the only political reference in the entire film, unless you count the junk news headlines. Compendium Books isn't shown - pity. The Penrith tea room I think is genuine, though the staff in the film could not have been. Incidentally the more or less derelict farm is Sleddale Hall, near Shap, Cumbria; apparently it's still more or less derelict.

[4] I noticed George Harrison's mate Richard Starkey MBE had some input, as did Steadman - the Withnail logo, no doubt. I thought the sound track was surprisingly weak given the possibilities from 1969. I couldn't help noticing there's a footstep editor, and someone called 'Shaun, the wardrobe mistress'. I know nothing about Paul Heller. The film could be regarded as a vignette showing an American or perhaps Jewish view of an England laid low.

[5] The caricature element is the only way the film gets its effects. Drunk driving and variations on the theme of an almost unusable car with fake tyre squeals. Inability to make food. ""Young people take drugs without understanding what harm they can do"" - a doctor told me, commenting on the incredible stupidity of taking dangerous stuff. Non-stop drugs, booze, and lack of food are shown as having little physical effect. Withnail down lighter fuel at one point - in fact, it was vinegar, secretly substituted for water to elicit a realistic choking performance. Could this be a deliberate propaganda effort? Fascinating to watch this film and try to disinter the motives behind it. I don't regard it as a comedy. It's not a tragedy - the characters were living at a time of world upheaval, US genocides and so on - but they are entirely self-absorbed. They're not the stuff of tragedy, any more than guinea pigs running in their wheels can be.",1278806400,4,4169,4.948571428571428

819509,5,6304271506,"Unlike so many comedies that are merely a collection stock characters and increasingly outlandish incidents - like the recent buddy flick ""The Hangover"" - this is a movie with a brilliantly funny script and a compelling story. Like the aforementioned flick, though, this movie does involve significant alcohol consumption and a wild, lost weekend.

I love how the movie starts. The two lads of the title (""I"" is not named in the film) are two out-of-work actors in a serious rut. One morning ""I"" leaves the squalid apartment he shares with Withnail to seek sustenance (he's suffering the effects of booze and pills) at a nearby dive, but he's appalled by the disgusting food, the downtrodden patrons and the lurid tabloid headlines he glimpses from a neighbor's newspaper. He bolts from the place and heads back home, eager to discuss his insights into the miserable human condition with Withnail. But his pal's only concern is the lack of booze in the apartment. Meanwhile, the deteriorating state of this humble abode can no longer be ignored -- rats seem to have taken up residence amid the dirty dishes and rotting food in the kitchen, and basic necessities like heat are lacking. After a futile attempt to clean the kitchen, the two venture outside for some fresh air. Oh, but it is not the most pleasant of seasons in London. The clammy, drizzly weather further deflates their spirits. The local pub provides a brief respite until a thug threatens to beat them up, sending them scurrying out the door.

But there is hope! Withnail's eccentric Uncle Monty loans them the key to his country house. A brief vacation in the country will surely get them out of the doldrums and help them forget that they haven't landed jobs in quite some time. Of course the holiday isn't as peaceful as planned. It's actually a nightmare, and the locals they meet up with are a tad eccentric.

The script of this film (originally released in 1986) by writer-director Bruce Robinson keeps the funny lines coming one after another. Indeed, as other reviewers have noted, this is one of the most quotable movies ever, and I've managed to avoid mentioning a single one of them! You really must see this movie if you're a fan of acerbic British wit.

Richard Grant is the bitter and always overly dramatic Withnail; Paul McGann is the saner counterpart to Withnail and provides the often humorous (but not overused) narration; and who could forget Richard Griffiths' great turn as Uncle Monty. Robinson says in the commentary that the film is badly shot, but I respectfully disagree. Despite the meager budget, Robinson does a fine job capturing the time and place (late 1960s England) and setting the mood for this film in various shots(the grimy apartment, the dreary streets of London, dark pubs, brief glimpses of beauty in the countryside, etc.).

As funny as this movie is, there's an undercurrent of sadness. The two lead characters are struggling to find their way, and it becomes apparent that they're headed in opposite directions. The film ends with Withnail bidding farewell to his friend (who has finally landed a lead role in a play) in a downpour and quoting Hamlet, something you know he'll never be doing on the stage. Robinson says that he considered a far darker ending, which you can find out by watching the commentary of this great movie.",1266278400,4,3341,4.844133099824869
819630,5,6304271506,"A recent addition to Roger Ebert's ongoing Great Movies list, Withnail and I is a quirky, low-budget, buddy-comedy of sorts that has none of the characteristics of a typical cinematic masterpiece but is still one of the best films I've seen in some time.

Richard E. Grant plays Withnail, with Paul McGann playing Marwood (who's never actually called that in the film and is credited as ""& I""). Withnail and Marwood are two out of work actors living in squalor in Camden Town, London circa 1969. Constantly drunk, the two decide to escape to the English countryside for a while, by staying at Withnail's gay Uncle Monty's cottage. Things get very interesting when Monty (Richard Griffiths) arrives and shows them his love for life...And his interest for Marwood.

Withnail and I is filled with wry, British humor. Not all of it is laugh-out-loud funny, but all of it is amusing. The performances are all delightful, with McGann perfect as Marwood. Grant however is particularly impressive as Withnail. The character is rarely seen sober or without a cigarette dangling from his lip. Grant plays this character with a certain wide-eyed eccentricity that makes him both loveable and incredibly memorable.
It's a brilliant piece of character acting.

One of the things that make Withnail and I so enduring is the scenes. The film admittedly doesn't have much of a plot to speak of but has more great scenes than even the most complicated film. Not a single scene feels too long or unnecessary and scenes like Marwood confronting a bull or Withnail ""making time"" to a soundtrack of Hendrix's ""Voodoo Chile"" will remain in your memory.

The film is filled with grin-inducing dialogue and hilarious situations, notably when Monty attempts to convince Marwood that Marwood is gay and to avoid an unpleasant situation, Marwood must convince Monty he actually is.

Beneath all the drugs, alcohol, and cursing; Withnail and I also manages to touch on universal themes, like friendship. And, let it be known, this is a great movie about friendship. Withnail and Marwood are a sort of alcoholic, witty, British Butch and Sundance.

Despite its low budget and nothing stand-out by way of cinematography, set-design, or anything like that, Withnail and I is a brilliantly scripted and acted film that deserves a large audience. Entertaining, funny, and brilliant.

819631,4,6304271506,"Some humor doesn't really transcend the culture that spawned it, and such is sometimes the case with the extremely English WITHNAIL AND I, an extremely witty, highly quoteable, and exceptionally toxic tale of two alcohol-swilling, drug popping, and out-of-work young actors who go an extremely ill-advised weekend vacation in 1969 England.  Often labled as a ""black comedy,"" it is very black indeed, asking us to be amused by a series of highly unsympathetic characters who really have no one to blame for their misfortunes except themselves.

The film is more character portrait than plot, and the portrait upon which it hinges is Withnail (Richard E. Grant), a clearly talented but completely unrestrained entity who is going to hell with a bottle in hand and taking his friend Marwood (Paul McGann) along for the ride.  Both are coming off a sixty-hour spree, find themselves depressed by their wildly sordid quarters and the vulgarities of London, and at Marwood's prompting decide to take a break.

They impose upon Withnail's uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths), described as a ""raving homosexual,"" for the use of his country place--but once there find it isolated, decayed, without provisions, and surrounded by an extremely unattractive assortment of rural locals.  Unbeknownst to Marwood, Withnail has actually secured use of the country place by telling Uncle Monty that Marwood is gay; not surprisingly, Uncle Monty eventually shows up with food, drink, and lust in his heart.  Needless to say, one awful incident leads to another before Withnail and Marwood return to London, where a twist of fate leads them to a final parting of the ways.

The actors are truly the thing here.  Grant is a knock-out as Withnail, spewing arrogance and viciousness, and making outrageous use of everyone who comes his way in brilliant comic fashion; McGann holds his own as the more sensible but easily led Marwood.  Griffiths is quite clever in his deeply ironic role of a profoundly silly homosexual who unexpectedly proves the only person in the cast to have any sense of integrity, and Ralph Brown scores in the role of ultra-dense yet oddly intelligent drug dealer Danny.  But the whole film is so remarkably poisonous that it becomes increasingly difficult to relate, much less sympathize, with the various characters.  The conclusion is uniquely bitter, a portent of an alcoholic hell yet to come.

On the whole, I do recommend the film, and the Criterion Edition is quite fine, with a handsome making-of documentary that traces the history of the film.  But it is worth pointing out that a cult film is one that provokes an unexpectedly positive response in a MINORITY of viewers--and you may or may not be among them.

819635,5,6304271506,"In the UK, Withnail and I is a seminal cult classic. A pean to 60s romanticism, alcoholism, individuality and talent sordidly and tragically pissed up the wall. Withnail and Marwood are two 'resting' actors living in magnificent squalor in Camden Town in the late 1960s. Frustrated and depressed with their existence, a pile of fetid washing up in the sink and Withnail with a recklessly unstable antifreeze drinking habit (the film has spawned its own drinking game), they manage to escape to a Lake District cottage for a weekend courtesy of Withnail's obese pederast uncle Monty, who legend has it is based on a real life tutor at Oxford University (still teaching - many people know who he is!)

The weekend turns sour as the dysfunctional duo face pouring rain, hostile locals and an awareness that their practical survival skills are about as effective as, well, as you imagine they would be from dissolute actors. They struggle to find food and wood, and hunker down for a grim weekend when Monty himself appears. They settle down to a classic roast lunch and liberal amounts of claret, but come the evening Monty reveals his intentions towards Marwood. The film gets funnier and funnier as social relations breakdown, and the final scene with Richard E. Grant unleashing a Hamlet soliloquy in the pouring rain is a poignant testament to the deep and noble frustration of the thwarted creative personality.

Yes, it is very very funnny and yes, it is the most quotable film I know (I know practically the whole script by heart - does that make me a nerd?), but surely it is much more than that? If Withnail was 'just' a funny quotable film, I don't think it would A) have achieved such cult status and B) would have touched so many people (well me at least) in such a profound way. Withnail is funny but it is also a very moving film about friendship. It's about growing up. It's about coming of age. It'S about those people who never 'quite' make it. The scene in which Marwood and Withnail say goodbye, you know the 'chin chin' scene, is one of the most moving moments of film I have ever seen. I always get an overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Withnail at that moment and his final solioquy from Hamlet is simply breath-taking. The only film I can think of that does roughly the same thing is 'One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'. Jack Nicolson is brilliant. Richard. E. Grant is brilliant. ONe flew is very very funny and very quotable ('At least I tried Goddamn it, at least I did that.'). Withnail is even more quotable ('We want the finest wines available to humanity.....'). RP McMurphy is the classic loser-joker, like Withnail. And, like in Withnail, One flew twists us around at the end and chokes the laughter in our throats with the final scene. It is the mark of a genius to do that. The 'CHief' runs off into the distance. Withnail walks off into the distance.

Withnal wants to act in something worth while, 'I' wants to do the same but has much more class and is not locked into a decaying and fluid so called post modern world, represented by collapsing buildings they both visit and live in, decayed old pubs inhabited by violent drunken louts who want to hurt and maim in their pain of loss. Then there is their old Jaguar one eye one window wiper and two very drunk survivors. This is a meditation on the qualities of past values and modern chaos. The end leaves one sad and uncomfortable as Withnal speaks from Shakespeare 'what a piece of work is man', the irony is almost too hard to bear as Withnal speaks to a wolf behind the zoo bars and as rain upon rain washes away the old world. This a film everyone should watch and is for anyone who wonders about the old, the nostalgia for the past and the new modern and careless world of today. The wolf pacing in front of the zoo bars mirrors the human pacing outside the fence, both are locked into their worlds. Withnal is beautiful in his aloneness and 'I' works to represent those that can make transitions from old values to new worlds, but does he lose something in the process? The musis is also fantastic and I wish I could buy and album of the music, the initial saxaphone rendition of a whiter shade of pale is beyond beautiful.

819688,4,6304271506,"Back in the late 80s, when I was in university, watching this low budget British film (on a gradually deteriorating videotape) was almost a weekly ritual for my friends and I. On the rare occasions it would be shown at one of the 2nd run theatres in town we'd be sure to catch it on the big screen. Later we'd obnoxiously try to outdo each other quoting its hilarious dialogue, while each of our girlfriends rolled their eyes and probably questioned themselves about whether their boyfriend was really the kind of man they'd want to father their children. I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that during those years I probably saw this film about thirty times. In the following decades I read the screenplay, Richard E. Grant's film diaries (he's the actor who plays Withnail) and Bruce Robinson's unrelated novel along with a very enjoyable collection of interviews with him. A documentary accompanying the film on this disk shows that my behavior was typical of the film's legion of fans. It can inspire that kind of devotion.

Watching Criterion's edition of ""Withnail and I"" recently was like running into an old buddy after many years. The film's mordant charm hasn't dated at all. It's a film about two perpetually intoxicated, unemployed actors and the gradual disintegration of their tenuous friendship as one starts to outgrow the other.  The film has the thinnest of plots but is presented with such wit and intelligence that, if it speaks to you, will seem nothing short of brilliant.  The DVD release has the added bonus of a nostalgic documentary about the making of the film and the cult that surrounds it.  The addition of a commentary track to the film would have improved this release. If you're already a fan of the film, you owe it to yourself to see the Criterion edition, even if you end up owning some other version. What makes this film great is the dialogue and acting. Even a pan and scan version will suffice for the repeated viewings you're bound to subject it to.

Note my rating is of this particular edition of the film, not the movie.  The movie is 5 stars.

Update: February 2016
I recently rewatched my copy of this Criterion edition on a widescreen TV (for the first time) and discovered that the film is not an anamorphic transfer and shows in a way where the image has black bars on both the sides and top and bottom, meaning it doesn't take full advantage of the television's screen size.  The picture quality is also not as great as I remember it being.  Apparently the best available version of the film that has been remastered is only available as a region B blu-ray put out by Arrow Video in the UK.  Unless you have a region-free player though, you'll have to turn to the second best option which is an Image Entertainment blu-ray released in 2010.  The aspect ratio on the latter disc is off from the original but the image quality is much better than the Criterion disc.

In hindsight the Criterion disc was not quite the gem I thought it to be.  For it's time it had some nice extras but later releases have significantly improved on the film presentation.  I've changed my original 5 star rating to 4 stars to reflect this realization.

Incidentally, there's an enjoyable audio commentary by Paul McGann and Ralph Brown, who play I/Marwood and Danny, respectively in the film, on Youtube.  This commentary is apparently on the Arrow Video release but not on the Criterion version.  It's worth checking out.",1174089600,6,3451,4.705980066445183

The drug dealer and uncle monty were the only good actors in the film.  Sadly there time on screen was about a total of 15 minutes.

If they release it, I'll at least want to see it, if not buy it, and their track record, in my mind, has them holding only one terrible movie; Walkabout, but other than that everything else they've dished out has been fantastic, Whitnail and I taking it's place on the list.

The description on the back was oddly misleading, I had no clue what to expect from the film, was it going to be more funny than scary, they make it seem as if the two are going to go at each other's throats, when this isn't really the case at all.

The story of two 20, Whitnail being almost 30, something guys sitting around doing absolutely nothing with their lives is, for the most part, a fairly common idea in film, but when done with the great wit and cleverness that W&I was given it makes it seem fresh and wholely entertaining.

I mention ""creepy"" in my title review because the cabin encounters between Uncle Monty and I were absolutely unsettling, I couldn't sit still while watching them, they made me that uncomfortable, as I imagined ""I"" was feeling as well.

The two main characters truly are the best of friends; they fight, they bicker, but in the long run they're there for each other, to help each other out.  So, when, near the end, ""I"" actually begins to gain some momentum to make something of his life, we're left with a rainsoaked melancholy Whitnail quoting Hamlet and walking off, leaving us with an open ending ripe with interpretation.  I for one thinks he kills himself, as was the original ending in the script, but, again, it's an open ending, anything could have happened.

819691,5,6304271506,"This is Robinson's masterpiece, the 'semi-autobiographical' (or at least based-on-aspects-of-his-life) tour-de-force which passed the critics by but which garnered itself a well-deserved cult following.

It follows the paths of two struggling out-of-work actors at the end of the sixties - penniless, bitter and nurturing a nasty fear that a great decade has just passed them by. It's like a wonderful stage play but without the confines of the stage. The adventures move off into the countryside and back to London. There are no special effects to distract you, just the tools needed to take the plot along to it's inevitable conclusion.

Withnail and Marwood (whose name is never actually used in the film) curse and whine their way through life, blaming everybody and everything for their failure.  ""No fridge, no TV, nothing that ordinary people take for granted..! I'm a trained actor.. ..reduced to the status of a bum!""

I believe that this movie 'hits the nail on the head"" (oh, sorry) with at least four classes of audience:

1) those in the theature business. The theatircal references are a scream, even to the rehearsal-type line repetition when Witnail is under threat. The great sweeping statements. ""I don't want to understudy that greasy pimp, I want to PLAY the part. Anyway, I hate all those Russian plays - full of women staring out of the window and watching ducks flying to moscow.""

2) those who have ever likewise looked into the mirror and come face-to-face  with failure, and decided that the only thing to do is to go down kicking and screaming. Everybody is to blame for Withnail's lack of success - except himself of course.

3) those firmly in the closet with the door bolted from the inside. (This is possibly the greatest ""staying in"" movie, but I would have to leave that to your own charactor asessment).

4) The boozers - those attempting to put a force-shield of alcohol between them and life's unpleasant truths. Every time our two heros enter a pub they become very businesslike in their attepts to blot out reality ""OK, two pints of bitter, two pints of larger - ice in the larger - and two double vodkas...""

The characterization is fantastic, Withnail and Marwood are wonderfully convincing (although larger-than-life), and they have a life that seems to extend beyond the ending credits - I can (and have) daydreamed about them a year later, a decade later, perhaps meeting by chance at some backstage party thrown by mutual friends, Withnail coming up to Marwood and saying bitterly ""Congatulations,you were wonderful.."" and then dissapearing out of the stage door to try to scrape together some hopeless project for next year's fringe with a talentless little starlet he's met an audition.

Not only that, but it seems as though every line in the film is quoteable. Marwood especially is likely to deliver something in a way that makes it sound like it might have come from Shakespeare or Bernard Shaw ""A coward you ARE, Withnail! An expert on bulls you are NOT!""

Grant and McGann are excellent in their roles, my only complaint being that they are so realistic in their renditions that you have to strain to catch some of their hilarious mutterings throughout the movie.

There is quite a bit of London vernacular (slang to you, mate) which might pass some audiences by. I have heard a US version of the movie, and they appear to have deleted one scene which refrences the conflict in Northern Ireland in an insensitive way but to have left all the dialogue relatively unchanged. There is also a deal of foul language, but as it fits so well with the characters it feels entirely justified, even required.

Much recommended if you happen to like well played theatre which don't fit the standard film genres, or if you fit into one of the above catagories. Most people will either love it or hate it within the first few frames.",1156032000,13,3872,4.838124054462935
819692,5,6304271506,"as some commentators have mentioned above this film works on several levels.

at the simplest it is a marvellous evocation of a very specific time in london life after 1968 and before 1973 when disillusionment with the 60s was setting in yet one could still live relatively cheaply in a grey area somewhere outside ""proper employment""

secondly it is a very funny ""road movie"" of sorts using the comedy basic of taking very unsuitable people into the country and seeing their hilarious failure to cope

but thirdly and i think most importantly it is a poignant meditation on growing up (not child to man, but man to adult).. ultimately one is either ""withnail"" or ""i""... there is either ""always time for a drink"" or there isn't..

most of us will stop being withnail after a time, but wish they hadn't..

Two highly educated actors, obviously descended from a wealthier class, wallow in an amazing amount of squalor in the early 1970's. This is more than an incredibly funny story about loveable losers, the original (and far more hilarious) Dumb and Dumber. This is about opportunities, about real talent, and about just wasting it away.

Danny, the ultimate loser, describes the spiral of waste and despair perfectly: ""If you are holding onto a rising balloon you are presented with a difficult political decision - let go while you've still got the chance or hold onto the rope and continue getting higher.""

But one of the two, Marwood, seems to sense on a basic level the need to let go of the balloon, to let go of drug-induced wretchedness. He is the one who gets them out of London, and ultimately confronts the choice of moving on.

As I look around me at the moral wasteland of modern American conservatism, riddled with corruption, scandal, incredible wasteful spending, mounting debts, senseless foreign wars and nation building, I have to wonder if many on the right will look at the days after 9/11 and wonder if we have, once again, seen an opportunity to make something truly memorable, and failed to paint it black.

Very amusing and touching portrayal of late sixties drug era london.

Grant is hysterical and reminded us all of our good friend, Kerry.
While his favorite thing about the movie was how dirty the main characters were.
Probably the best use of a Hendrix song in any soundtrack - as a wrecking ball destroys a building at the opening chords of ""all along the watchtower"".
Brilliant.

819697,3,6304271506,"Written and Directed by Bruce Robinson (who would later go on to make the Uma Thurman movie JENNIFER 8) WITHNAIL & I is a semi-autobiographical black comedy about two struggling actors in Camdenton London during the last months of the 60s.  The future is looking rather bleak for Withnail (Richard E. Grant) and I (Paul McGann). Both are out of work and in the midst of drug and alcohol problems.  After hitting rock bottom the pair decide to take a peaceful vacation in the country and plan on how to re-establish some direction in their lives before the new decade begins.
However their stay in the country turns out to be anything but tranquil when the boorish, self absorbed Withnail manages to bring out the hostilities of the locals.  Both reduced to the status of village pariahs, the unwelcome duo find themselves confined to the tiny cottage where they are forced to burn their own furniture to stay warm, and literally shooting fish in order to survive.
Though the movie is a bit plodding and self-important at times; WITHNAIL & I is nonetheless an absorbing and well-acted low key cult item that is worth a look for curiosity's sake. (Not something I'll have to point out to those people have seen the movie more than a dozen times! I've only seen it once.) The highlight of the movie for me is the scene in which Withnail concocts a novel way to get let off a drink driving charge.

Writer-director Bruce Robinson captures the zeitgeist surrounding the ""death"" of the 1960's with his story of two impoverished actors who slog through ""swinging"" 1969 London with high hopes and low squalor. Richard E. Grant's turn as the decadently wasted Withnail is unforgettable, ably supported by the ""I"" of the title, Paul McGann. Reminiscent of ""Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas"", but with a more wry British approach to substance-fueled paranoia. The two flatmates, desperate for a break from thier cramped, heatless apartment, take a road trip to the ""country"" (remember the ""locals"" in ""Straw Dogs""?), and harrowing hilarity ensues. There are so many great lines, you might as well put quotation marks at the beginning and end of the script! Despite what some whiney reviewers have said, the Criterion edition is the best print I've ever seen of this movie. Even director Bruce Robinson candidly admits that it was ""badly filmed""-that's just the way the movie looks and sounds, folks, deal with it! By the way, Bruce Robinson can be seen in a rare acting role in the excellent 1999 film ""Still Crazy"", playing a mysterious Syd Barrett type guitarist (I didn't realize it was him until I saw the interview segment included on the ""Withnail"" DVD and recognized him right away as the founder of ""Strange Froot""!).",1072656000,9,1456,4.995884773662551

The film follows these two as they confront their horror at the ending of the 70s and decide to get out of London and head ""to the country"". Two less-suited country dwellers than these could not be found in all of England, and their misadventures and eventual return to the city make up the plot.
Plot isn't where the genius of this film lies, however. The best moments come from the caustic tongue of Withnail, along with the befuddled willingness of Marwood, and the rampant campiness of Uncle Monty. All three have their weaknesses and peccadilloes, and these are revealed through some of the most wondrously amusing, creative scenes and lines of dialogue ever recorded. Quotes from the film stick in the mind as moments of sadness, illumination, hippy-wonder and humour. No ""Three best lines from Withnail & I"" lists would contain the same line.

820027,4,6304271506,"Withnail and I is the kind of movie that has a huge cult following over here in Britain, although surprisingly there are still many people who haven't seen it.  It concerns two out-of-work actors, Withnail (Richard E. Grant) and I (Paul McGann), who take a weekend break in a cottage on loan from Withnail's uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths).  Whilst there everything that could go wrong does, leading to a peculiarly fitting conclusion.
The humour is undoubtedly caustic as well as being undeniably British in its sharp take on situation comedy.  This is probably best summed up by saying that you don't know whether you should be sympathetic for the characters or laugh at them.  Despite this biting humour though, which in itself makes it worth a watch, the excellent acting is obviously of note.  Richard E. Grant is one of the those actors that everyone has seen in one or two films but can't really figure out why he's so famous.  Well this is it.  His performance as Withnail is the kind of career-defining performance that is all too hard to come by.  He manages to express comedy, self-loathing, bitterness and humanity in what is perhaps one of the most realistic performances of the 80's.  Of course, Paul McGann's performance never really launched him into the stratosphere, although on many counts it's hard to see why: although in a much less showy role than Grant, he is just as good in the role that he plays as the more sympathetic 'I' of the title.
All in all this is a movie that once seen will not be forgotten.  In addition to being completely original, very very funny in an unconventional way, it comes complete with heart (particularly in the end) and is a genuine cult film that thoroughly deserves its status.",1038182400,5,1733,4.7275747508305646

The film is mostly a series of vignettes between the alcoholic, acerbic Withnail and the softer Marlowe.  Withnail is the sort of person who is intelligent and talented enough to be anything he wanted to if he'd crawl out of a scotch bottle long enough.  Marlowe is alternately exasperated by and in awe of Withnail.  These are early roles for both McGann and Grant, and they show remarkable talent that would be exploited in later roles.
Though touted as a dark comedy, I found more ""dark"" than ""comedy"".  There were long periods between laughs while watching this film (mostly mundane things like driving cars, watching them walk to town, and chase a farmer down to buy firewood) and it never quite felt that the film was actually building towards anything until Uncle Monty shows up to the cottage to put the moves on Marlowe.  Watching McGann squirm his way out of this was definitely worth watching, but took too long to get to.

I'm not a squeamish viewer in any sense of the word, in fact I gravitate toward movies that don't pull any punches, but I could not take either of these guys, could not stomach the squallor, the discolored tongues, the mess in the kitchen and the dripping egg sandwich. ""Awful,"" I said of the movie. ""overrated and disgusting. Not funny!""
Later that night, I became violently ill, a condition that lasted for two days and left me sweaty, feverish and delirious, unable and unwilling to consume any solid food at all. When I finally emerged from the haze, after promising myself to never take decent health for granted again, I wondered whether my impending illness had affected my opinion of ""Withnail,"" or -- on the contrary -- whether the film itself had somehow infected me with stomach flu.
When I watched it again the next day, carefully sipping ginger ale, I realized that whatever had happened, I was seeing a movie that would become one of my favorites ever.
Plenty of reviewers have pointed out the highlights of this film better and more faithfully than I ever could.

It's a shame there's no commentary on the DVD. I would've loved to have heard Bruce Robinson, Richard Grant, Paul McGann, Ralph Brown... with individual cast and crew channels. Fortunately, they at least appear in the making-of supplement that appears in the special features section (which, as ""look backs"" go is not nearly as depressing, or as schmaltzy, as the title ""Withnail & Us"" had me to believe).
I think the reason that I like this movie is because I've been there. Not the English countryside in the late 60's, but i've experienced the same circumstances and i know variations of those characters, and you probably have too if you've had any wild years... i've even acted like those people once or twice.

820035,5,6304271506,"The quintissential British comedy. Set in the fag end (that's cigarrette end) of the 60's in the squalid bedsits of London, Withnail and I is a tale of two aspiring young actors; the pompous and deranged Withnail (Richard E. Grant) and the quietly reserved ""I"" (Paul McGann). The film follows their increasingly debauched downward spiral as they try to live with no money, no food, no heating, a hideously filthy kitchen infested with rats and, more importantly, no booze! Add to this their frequently unwanted house guest, drug dealing hippy Danny (A scene stealing turn by Ralph Brown), and a near fight with a stocky Irish homophobe who believes them, wrongly, to be gay, they decide that a trip to the country is in order to help revitalise themselves. And so they stay with Witnail's Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths) which leads to a second act full of crossed wires, fish out of water exploits and unwanted sexual advances. To give too much away would spoil this wonderful film.
 The film is funny without relying on jokes. The humour comes from the situations, the immensly quotable dialogue: ""We want cake, and the finest wines available to humanity... and we want them here and we want them now,"" blathers a drunken Withnail as he and ""I"" frequent a quaint english tea and cake shop, upsetting the locals.
 The magic is in the details. Writer/Director Bruce Robinson, who almost didn't make the film after the success, and subsequent Oscar win, for his ""The Killing Fields"" screenplay, recreates an era which he knows all to well. The film is loosely based on his experiences, with ""I"", the films narrator (originally referred to in the script as Marwood) being his alter ego. Withnail is very muched based on his flatmate Vivien, who, yes it's true, did drink lighter fuel and went blind for days. Michael Elphick, another flat mate of Robinson's, even makes an appearance as a poacher.
 Withnail and I is as poignant as it is funny, capturing a period where so many young artists fell by the wayside. Watching the finale in London zoo, you can only assume the worst will happen to Withnail. It was a decade of so much unfullfilled promise, as summed up by Danny: ""We are reaching the end of the greatest decade in the history of mankind, and as my friend Presuming Ed consistently points out... we have failed to paint it black!""",1003104000,6,2339,4.770370370370371

The funniest films mine this trove of despairing exigencies in an urgent, played-for-real mode. And none do it better than WITHNAIL & I, now available in a superb uncut version on DVD.

Bruce Robinson, the sometime actor and screenwriter (""The Killing Fields""), made his 1986 directorial debut with his semi-autobiographical screenplay that is widely considered the greatest neglected comedy of all time. The slender plot is simple. Flatmates Richard E. Grant (Withnail) and Paul McGann (& I) are two stoned, hungry, broke, and out-of-work actors wallowing in self-made squalor. When they get an opportunity to spend a weekend in the country cottage of Withnail's three hundred pound Uncle Montague, they go, hoping to ""rejuvenate."" What ensues is an extraordinarily deranged weekend of drunken delusion and distraught discovery that you will never forget. To reveal any more story details would be a gross disservice to those who have not yet found this wonderfully twisted, honest and perfect film.

Richard Griffiths is unsettling as the campy, dissolute predator cousin Montague and Ralph Brown is spot-on as Danny, the slow-talking, menacing but philosophical dope dealer. Hard to believe this was Richard E. Grant's first film. Even harder to believe is that he is a non-drinker who doesn't smoke.

Perfectly cast, nearly every spoken line is unfiltered emotional truth and most are quotable -- especially the caustic diatribes of drunken, acerbic Grant. And the scenes themselves are brilliant set-pieces that unfold like diamonds in the rough being cut to gem-stone perfection.

After experiencing this unblinking look back at the end of the 60s in a London suburb where a tenuous friendship, high expectations and unfulfilled dreams collide during a disastrous weekend getaway, you too will laugh when you next hear the opening riffs of Jimmy Hendrix's ""Voodoo Child."" And you will understand when someone blurts out in a restaurant, ""We want the finest wines available to humanity. We want them here and we want them NOW!. And cake.""

This new Criterion widescreen version is clean and sharp and there's a too-short bonus interview with Robinson, Brown, Grant and McGann.

820120,4,6304271506,"Another cult movie has just entered the Criterion collection : british writer-director Bruce Robinson's 1986 WITHNAIL AND I starring Richard E. Grant and Paul McGann, both excellent. Richard Griffith as the cousin Montague and Ralph Brown as "" The Hippie Philosopher "" are hilarious. This film is a valuable addition to your library if you like english comedies, the sixties or simply a smart movie.
WITHNAIL AND I is greatly autobiographical. Bruce Robinson's 25 minutes interview featuring home movies and photographies shot in London in the mid-sixties is very instructive ; one understands soon that Withnail and (""I"") Peter's life pictured in the movie has been the normal life of a large number of the english teenagers of the sixties. The character of ""Withnail"" played by an hallucinated Richard E. Grant, who in the real life doesn't drink alcoholic beverages, will certainly stay in the annals of Movie History.
If WITHNAIL AND I moves us so much, it's because this nostalgic movie is about lost hopes, about the green pastures of our youth when the world was ready to be conquered and waiting for us. Withnail is a pathetic character who could have been a genius in any artistic domain but who didn't create anything because, after all, it wasn't so important.
Apart of the Bruce Robinson interview ( look carefully at the level of the red wine in his glass... ), one will also find in this Criterion presentation a limited-edition of a poster, a theatrical trailer, liner notes by Robinson, various pre-production photos and english subtitles.
A DVD zone nostalgy.",995673600,18,1576,5.019083969465649
820121,5,6304271506,"Criterion has done a wonderful job with this DVD release of WITHNAIL & I.  The picture looks sharp, the sound is clear, and the extras are a lot of fun.  The biggest difference for me was that the only video version of this film I owned was the full-screen version that contains numerous edits.  Watching this film uncut for the first time in years really pointed out how much I had been missing with the video version.  Getting this DVD is definitely worth the money.
The film itself is a joy to experience.  While the plot cannot be accused of being overcomplicated, this simplicity is more than made up for in the wonderful characters and brilliant dialogue (virtually none of which can be quoted in an all-ages forum such as this).  Loosely narrated by Paul McGann's ""I"" character, this film depicts a brief period in the life of two struggling actors as they attempt to find booze, drugs and jobs in the dying days of the 1960s.  The movie covers a wide spectrum from some scenes featuring the funniest lines that you'll ever hear to small touching moments that are surprisingly moving.  This is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys good moviemaking.
Every character in the picture is superbly acted and written for.  It's a testament to Bruce Robinson's directing skills that the characters compliment each other so well instead of clashing and overbearing the others as could so easily have happened.  The secondary characters work as well as the leads and each one adds their unique flavour to the mixture.  Robinson doesn't make the mistake of giving the smaller parts too much on-screen time and having them overstay their welcome.  Each character says and does no more than they need to and leaves everyone wanting more.
Richard E. Grant and Paul McGann are perfectly cast in their roles.  Each bile-covered insult roles off of Grant's tongue as if he'd been swearing at McGann all his life.  It's amazing that Grant is a teetotaler in real life and was relying on pure skill for most of his inspiration.  Excellent acting.
The documentary that is included on the DVD is 30 minutes long and quite excellent.  There are interviews with Richard E. Grant (Withnail), Paul McGann (...& I), Bruce Robinson (writer/director), Ralph Brown (Danny) and a host of other people related to the production.  It's a funny and enthralling look at the people and ideas behind the film.  Just fast-forward through the trainspotters.",995500800,40,2429,4.854368932038835
820122,5,6304271506,"This film is simply superb and is one of the few films you can and will watch again and again with it getting funnier each time.

Anyway, unlike most of the Americans in the reviews I've read, I can't laugh while I'm watching it because I'm utterly captivated by the use of the English language in the acting and the slang that is used (brilliant is right).  I fear that I might miss something if I start to laugh (ok, I laughed at the cat).  Monty Python are schoolboys compared to this.  I can just watch it over and over, like it's a captivating, exotic woman.  You can't stop listening, nor can you look away.  You never get tired of it.

One has to be somewhat familiar with the period totruly appreciate the backdrop, but everyone should recognize the quality of the performance.  Set in London and the English countryside, the movie portrays a moment in the life of two out-of-work actors during the end of the hippie-culture, or the British equivalent thereof. The film is basically a collection of character sketches with some exceedingly well acted roles. Although filled with outrageous and mordant wit, the underlying story is sad - portraying the eventual success of the less outgoing, but better adapted Marwood (Paul McGann), while the disgraceful Withnail (Richard Grant) is left in his self-made misery. Richard Griffiths, gives a truly outstanding portrayal of Monty, Withnail's affluent, overweight and gay uncle. And often overlooked, is the immensely talented portrayal of Danny, the drug dealer, by Ralph Brown - who makes one wonder if the scenes were acted, or real. This is the genuine article.

820336,5,6304271506,"...is over. And as presuming Ed here has so consistently pointed out, we are foul to paint it black.""
So says ""Danny,"" the Delphic Oracle of the film, and this is the nut. For anyone who has ever looked  back at the demise of the counter-cultural movements of the 1960's and felt  sadness at their disintegration and subsumption by the forces of corporate  marketing mass mind-control, this movie is for you. Yes, it's a comedy, and  like all great comedies, it's drama works best because the humor of the  story throws the drama into such sharp relief.
If you've ever chased  after your dreams with drugs, and found yourself tattered and broken at the  end of a long road of pain and loss, this movie will reach you. If you've  never used your food money for the week to buy booze or drugs for the day,  if you've never been afraid of the multilayered quagmire of standing water,  dishes and unidentifiable matter in your sink, then you will miss a lot of  what this movie has to offer. If you've ever had a dream, and had to watch  it die knowing that it was your own bungling that killed it, then this  movie will reach your heart. And if you've ever gotten so stoned with your  friends that you all searched your apartment for twenty minutes for the  keys that were in your hand the whole time, you will find a lot to laugh at  in this movie.
Once again, Richard E. Grant scores a bullseye. His  Withnail is every drowning loser left at the end of a voyage undertaken  with high hopes, caught in a storm watching the waters close over his head,  ""making an enemy of (his) own future,"" ""drifting into the  arena of the unwell.""
If you've ever looked at life, with its wages  and cubicles and sports, its schedules and its rules, no place to hang your  hat and be let alone but that you must pay someone rent, and felt like  something was wrong, something must be missing, you will understand  Withnail's terrible, desperate compulsion to stand on the throttle and  blast through one disaster after another.
I never ""got""  Shakespear until I watched this movie. If you don't get anything else from  Withnail & I, at least try to embrace the Hamlet soliloquy at the  movie's end. Maybe you've never been troubled by a feeling that life is  empty and tedious. And maybe you've seen those people who do seem to see  life that way, and not understood why. The answer for you is in that speech  at the movie's end.
Danny says, ""When you're hanging on to a rising  balloon, you're presented with two choices; either let go or hang on which  brings up the question of how long you can keep your grip on the  rope?"" How terrible it must be to have been involved in the hippie  subculture in the sixties, and to have to watch it die in the  seventies.
In his able and compelling epitaph of the 1960's, Hunter S.  Thompson put it best when he said, ""San Francisco in the middle  sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. But no  explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of  knowing that you were there, and alive, in that corner of time in the  world. Whatever it meant.
There was madness in any direction, at any  hour. You could strike sparks anywhere.
There was a fantastic universal  sense that whatever we were doing was right--that we were winning. And  that, I think, was the handle. That sense of inevitable victory over the  forces of old and evil. Not in any mean or military sense--we didn't need  that. Our energy would simply prevail. We had all the momentum. We were  riding the crest of a high, and beautiful wave.
So now, less than five  years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look west. And  with the right kind of eyes, you can almost see the highwater mark--that  place where the wave finally broke, and rolled back.""
