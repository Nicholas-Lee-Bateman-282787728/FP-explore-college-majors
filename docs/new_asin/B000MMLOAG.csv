2737015,5,B000MMLOAG,"The photographic documentary, MANUFACTURED LANDSCAPES, shows China's ever-changing landscape.  The images that are presented in the film will conjure thoughts of China's past as an agrarian society, and blueprints the country's imminent future as an urbanized metropolis and industrial mecca.  Photographer Edward Burtynsky points his lens and creates a portfolio of art with a conscience.

Burtynsky uses his camera and produces instant panoramic shots capturing China's changing landscape.  The beginning of the film takes place in a massive warehouse where an assembly line of production is taking place.  Burtynsky artfully depicts the large number of uniformed workers intricately assembling indistinguishable products.  Later in the film, there are scenes of shanty buildings in Shanghai and brief moments taken off the coast of India's Bangladesh where there are remnants of man-made creations that may have once sailed the world and homes that housed each respective population, which are now scraps of metal and rubble that are painstakingly and carefully dismantled -- old ships and electronic transmitters, which are dangerously toxic, and villages along the river that are demolished in order to make room for a colossal dam.

The film is about 90 minutes and includes exceptional photographs and commentary.  Two observations arise while watching the film that may be shocking.  Burtynsky comments that under Mao's rule, China was 80 percent agrarian and 20 percent, but now intends to be 70 percent urban and 30 percent agrarian.  And for a country that once was amassed with bicycles, seldom is there a scene where one sees one, except when Burtynsky shows two individuals, possibly heading home from work, riding their bikes amidst a barren construction site as the sun goes down, which paints an ominous picture of China's past and future.

MANUFACTURED LANDSCAPES is a thought provoking film that photographically documents a changed society.  Burtynsky cleverly and beautifully reflects  upon the China of yesterday and today.  He may have created the film and photographs as art, but his images may convey thoughts to ponder.",1191196800,2,2145,5.460606060606061
2737016,5,B000MMLOAG,"Jennifer Baichwal's documentary is a companion to renowned artist Edward Burtynsky's large-scale photographs depicting man's violent alteration of natural environments. Burtynsky achieved notoriety when he documented mine tailings, rail cuts, quarries and oil refineries, mostly located in North America. Baichwal shows Burtynsky at a lecture and exhibition of this material then travels to Asia with him to document the process of creating art based on China's industrial revolution. Manufactured Landscapes opens with an amazing tracking shot from the sidelines of a factory so enormous that the shot lasts eight minutes. There are stunning views of recycling yards and mountains of electronic refuse. Manufactured Landscapes takes us to the site of the Three Gorges Dam, 50% bigger than any previous such project, and to the ruins of the eleven cities that had to be demolished to make its construction possible. In Bangladesh, we witness an area that's become the final resting place for old oil tankers, which are being scrubbed clean of oil by teenagers. The central theme of Manufactured Landscapes is that the things we've come to regard as indicative of progress and human advancement have created a huge dependence on the extraction of natural resources that undermines the health of our planet and consequently our own. Beinchwal's documentary doesn't need to lecture because the visual evidence is so compelling and, ironically, so beautiful.",1185580800,22,1454,5.495535714285714
2737017,2,B000MMLOAG,"I am quite simply not a visual learner. If you pay attention to the reviews I write you would notice that I am one of those misguided critics who find it Ok to really only review screenplays. So this film which uses images to explore the cataclysmic effects that industrialization and urbanization in China is having on the environment was already starting off behind the eight ball. At the center of the film is photographer Edward Burtynsky who has worked on the topic for a long time. I saw his exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum and was impressed with the way that he could take the ugly process of destroying Planet Earth and turn it into art that is often times beautiful. Many of his photos are used in the movie and some are astounding. The superhighways muscling their way across the Chinese countryside, the used tires that stretch for as far as the eye can see, the poor oil workers laboring their way to an early grave. Behind all of these images is a dark political message that people like me can really sink their teeth into. As Al Gore pointed out last summer, this Earth is all we have and our habits have a profound affect on it. And it is not just that we drive cars and use air conditioners. It is that we are vastly over populated. And it is that we find it OK that we take this mass of humanity and turn them into indentured servants all in the name of the Great March Forward. But what good is a picturesque city if civil and workers rights have all vanished in the process. Or more importantly if there is no Earth to house this city. And on top of it all is the point that the most significant environmental damage being done in the world is being perpetrated by the capitalistic drive of a Communist country.

That said, this film did not win me over despite its important political message. It is a stew without spice. After opening with a decent tracking shot through a Chinese factory nothing that follows is as inspired. We see photos that Burtynsky has taken and then we see live action shots of the same. At times I even felt like Lars Von Trier's computer was editing this movie. There is one scene where two people are having a fairly interesting conversation and we get a shot of some random biker peddling by. There are, of course, good things to be found. I enjoyed our trip down Three Gorges Dam; you know the one that is so large it is throwing off the rotation of the Earth. I also liked the none too subtle contrast between the slums of Shanghai and the life of a wealthy Chinese woman who can afford two gardeners. But still the film doesn't do enough and the end result is exhaustion. There is a hypnotic quality which at times can be good, but for the most part I just felt like I was dozing when I should have been considering the larger implications of Burtynsky's work. **1/4",1183507200,15,2818,4.388145315487572

Yes, I was aware it was SD when I purchased it, and as far as I know this film has never been offered in HD in any format. But Edward Burtynsky's  medium is large format photography which has stunning depth and resolution to it - all of which is totally lost in a SD video stream. I mean - it's entirely pointless to try to appreciate this guy's work in this format.  Look instead for his other film Watermark, which is available in HD - or better yet, purchase his books.

It provides an excellent visual to go with many things that we often read about environmental concerns in China, but the way it is put together is a little too raw/artsy for my liking. However, because of its almost unedited style, the film does give some insight into the on-the-ground production work that goes into photographing/filming work like this. This is particularly true in the cases of photographs that you can hear being staged, rather than being captured in a ""real-life"" situation.

Overall the video is definitely worth a watch, but I would have been happier to have checked it out from the library than to have purchased my own copy.",1336089600,2,751,4.9603174603174605
2737045,5,B000MMLOAG,"""Manufactured Landscapes"" is a magnificent and frightening movie, directed by Jennifer Baichwal (2006), documenting the work of photographer and artist Edward Burtynsky. With impressive images that go deep into viewers' brains, it shows where all the stuff is coming from, the stuff that we find in our warehouses, department stores, supermarkets, and computer stores.

Starting with a seemingly endless Chinese factory, all in an unsettling Ikea yellow, the film juxtaposes the weird beauty of resource extraction places to the hectic bustle of production as China is becoming the world's biggest manufacturer. The most depressing images are not even the whips who tell the workers that they are not fast enough, but the hypnotic repetitive motions of the women workers. One is continuously wrapping wires around identical parts and cutting them quickly, only to complete the same senseless course of movements again with the next part. Another worker is testing thousands of nozzles with a small water hose, over and over again; yet another one is mounting circuit breakers, piece by piece, 400 of them per day. That is 50 per hour, or about 4 of them in 5 minutes.

However, the products quickly turn into waste, which is yet another resource for the ever hungry production of new commodities. Scrap metal, plastic parts, and electronic waste come to China from the countries that first imported the products and now send them back as useless debris. The waste must be sorted and separated, often under terribly toxic conditions. The waste is brought to China via ship, just as much as the new products are being distributed over the world through ships. The shipyard industry that has long disappeared from the Western World is thriving in China and part of the large manufacturing machine that this country has become.

But the ships, too, turn into debris at some point. The most lasting images in the movie are those of stranded ships at the coast of Bangladesh. The shipwrecks are valuable resources that get quickly dismantled and turned into scrap metal, waiting to be turned into new commodities. These images give an eery premonition of Hieronymus Bosch's apocalyptic paintings, seen through the lens of the Breugel Brothers (specifically the Tower of Babel). If you ever had the pleasure of reading Edmund Burke's or Imanuel Kant's thoughts on the sublime (""das Erhabene""), you will quickly make the connection.

Manufactured Landscapes is the story of an unheard of transformation, caused by the human race and the unrestrained forces of globalized capitalism. Using the grammar of images established by classic movies Koyaanisqatsi  (Godfrey Reggio, 1982) and The Assault of the Present on the Rest of Time (Alexander Kluge, 1985), the film shows that the landscapes of modern civilization are intentional landscapes, the result of purposeful destruction.

These landscapes are a direct consequence of the unleashed Instrumental Reason (Horkheimer/Adorno), as exemplified with the endless sprawl of Shanghai and the gigantic Three Gorges dam project, which led to the relocation of more than one million people and the purposeful, carefully executed demolition of thirteen cities and many villages.

The movie includes beautiful and disturbing still photography by Edward Burtynsky, underscoring the sophisticated and painstaking pictorial language of this extraordinary documentary.",1335916800,3,3398,5.37593984962406

beautiful work to more people is worthwhile.

That said, for me the documentary itself, while very interesting and well made, simply
can not compete with the enormous power of Burtynsky's own images. Indeed the
best moments in the film are when we see the photos themselves.

While some of what we see of the photographer""s process is interesting, and there is
some provocative gentle implied questioning of the distance and lack of humanity in
Burtynsky""s photographs, I did not learn much more about the man and his work then
when I first happened upon his seeing his photos at a gallery, and then immediately
bought several books of his images.

A very solid documentary, but not as amazing one.

On the other hand, the extras, particularly the lengthy photo gallery where Brutynsky
himself talks in detail about many of his great images from the film is far more powerful
and interesting, and it's absolutely worth getting the DVD for that feature.

2737048,2,B000MMLOAG,"The director and the still photographer amble their elevated path among the poor, and use stills, cine, and dystopian tone music to sneer at industrial landscapes that they deem beneath their sensitivities.

Then suddenly we are granted entry to a private gallery viewing of Burtysnky's work, moving quietly among the art-consuming elite of North America's university-educated privileged classes, while they goggle (but with such empathy, my dear!) at his condescending photographs.

Then the director claims he was avoiding overt political labelling, when he is using exactly the medium and style that his contemporaries will recognize as cool political comment.

And why is a large factory a BAD THING, and why does he construct his pictures --- and Jennifer Baichwal her video --- to paint large groups of workers as somehow less than human, even ant-like?  After all, those are the people and the factories that made Burtynsky's and Baichwal's cameras, clothes, and cars, and they did it at a bargain price.

2737049,5,B000MMLOAG,"This is a stunning, often depressing, but undeniably powerful documentary that explores the physical & psychological landscapes created by the consumerist worldview. This is what ""progress"" looks like behind the cheap, shiny, glittering facade of endless things manufactured for profit & convenience ... and the need for them is manufactured as well, to ensure that millions of human beings will work away their lives to make & possess them.

There's no overt preaching here, as the images speak for themselves. No doubt there are some who'll watch this film & think it a glorious tribute to production & wealth, which are the only things that matter to the current powers that be today. Yes, I know that I'm preaching myself now, our of sheer frustration & anger & despair. But to see both the natural world & the human spirit destroyed for the sake of -- what? -- success? status? dying with the most toys & winning ... something? How can we not be appalled?

Certainly there's convenience in some of these things, in that they make immediate life easier & more comfortable in the short run. The question few want to address is this: what's the long-term cost of that convenience, both in environmental & human terms? How much is irretrievably lost for the sake of an unsustainable & superficial lifestyle?

For me, this is the real dilemma. What is true quality of life? What is a genuinely meaningful life? Is it a life of things, measured in bank accounts & public recognition? I'm not pretending that we don't need certain basic necessities; nor am I ignoring the allure of many modern pleasures. I'm not so pure & noble & austere that I don't want some of them myself.

But why do I want them? I wasn't born craving them. I was taught to want them, as we're all taught to buy & consume & not think about any of it. The physical damage is hidden from sight on the other side of the world; the psychological damage is smoothed over with pills & digital distractions.

And the thing is, it can't last. The population continues to grow, even as resources dwindle. It's the perfect recipe for war, increased selfishness, and profound despair. What this film demands is not merely a change in lifestyle, an emphasis on environment, but an entirely new, modest, humble worldview. The tragedy is that most people won't even consider it until it's far too late for them.

Will the future of humanity be a slag heap? I'd like to think we can still escape that fate ... but Agent Smith's bitter speech in ""The Matrix"" about humanity being a virus that destroys its environment sounds more chillingly accurate with each passing day. The dull faces of the factory workers in this film reflect that barren truth all too clearly.

The images themselves are stunning, and in my opinion the best medium for their display would be a gallery followed by a slide show. As a film it was incredibly dull. There is essentially no narration, little music, and any interviews with locals are not subtitled. In the end it felt like pure narcissism on the part of the photographer. We don't really need to see you taking the pictures, they should speak for themselves. If he didn't have anything important to add, I'm not sure why he felt the need to make the film. Maybe it was to give us plenty of footage of himself. I knew it was going to be bad when at the beginning of the film the audience was subjected to several minutes of background conversation about setting up a shot (comments on the lighting, etc.) that was not even directed to us.

2737062,5,B000MMLOAG,"I have actually followed Edward Burtynsky's photographic work for quite some time now. In fact he has been quite an inspiration for my own photographic work. I have now seen 5 of his exhibitions including the Manufactured Landscapes show at the Brooklyn Museum of Art back in 2005 and the updated Manufacturing Landscapes show at the Boston Museum of Science back in May of this year (2009). His work is outstanding and when I found out he was making a Manufactured Landscapes film....well lets just say I watched it the first chance I got and it certainly doesn't disappoint.

The opening scene for this documentary by itself is enough to outright stun most people. It honestly left me speechless and changed my entire outlook on China and the concept of mass production. You see the human mind has problems dealing with large numbers. for example we understand that the Sun is 93,000,000 miles away from earth yet our minds just cant grasp just how far that really is. We have no experience to compare it too. We understand how far a mile is and we can even picture how far a mile is in our heads as we have traveled a mile many times in our lives and its that experience that allows us to visualize and really understand such distances and numbers. That just isn't the case with larger numbers and our ability to really grasp just how big they really are simply breaks down. Why am I bringing this up? Because the world has reached a level of mass production that is simply beyond our comprehension and the opening scene in this film really shows this in a very simply yet creative way. A single shot that pans across the floor of one of the so called ""Mega factories"" in China. This one scene shows you that your not in Kansas anymore as what your looking at is a whole different level of manufacturing that many of us simply have never seen before.

Sure we have all heard about China's ability to mass produce but because of our brains inability to cope with such large numbers, we simply haven't been able to fully comprehend just how massive the scale of production really is. This one scene really helps put things in perspective and it will leave most people absolutely stunned. I won't go into anymore detail as it would ruin the scene for people who have yet to see it. It simply must be seen to be fully understood and even after seeing it you will still be unable to fully comprehend the overall level of production that exists today.

This documentary isn't just about China and it isn't just about mass production, its about mass production and the effect such production has had on the environment. Its an incredibly powerful film even if were literally unable to comprehend just how big of a problem this is. I have actually heard the argument that mankind is simply too insignificant to cause any serious damage to the planet, in fact there were a couple people in my environmental engineering program that literally believed this was true. While I believe that this was once true, when population was down in the million or hundreds of millions instead of billions, its just a whole different ballgame with 6+ billion people now living on the planet and again this film really begins to show people the scale of which mass production has risen to over the last 40 years and the trouble were now beginning to face because of it.

One of the more interesting aspects to this documentary, and the still photographs as well, is the romanticizing nature some of his pictures take on. For example the cover picture of the red flowing water isn't just scary as hell from an environmental perspective, its also quite beautiful from a photographic perspective especially if your unaware of the details of the picture. It almost appears to be a lava flow. There are many of these types of images throughout the film and throughout the still photography show. These are not just documentary pictures as he clearly was looking for the best way to photograph a lot of this subject matter. It gives many of his pictures a duality that is rich in both destruction and beauty.

Bottom line - An amazing body of work that simply should not be missed. Its worth seeing just for the 8 minutes long scene in the beginning of the film. Stunning, simply stunning work by one of my favorite photographers currently working.

2737063,5,B000MMLOAG,I concur with the other reviewers: this documentary is very well shot and would stand on its own as an object of aesthetic contemplation (like the photographs of Burtinksy themselves). The social commentary and the relationship between Burtinsky own views and his work are also explored in a subtle yet effective fashion. Highly recommended as an example of what a non-formulaic documentary can be,1259020800,,397,5.21875

The movie is sometimes a little slow but maybe you want it to finish faster so that you can go back to your way of consumming as usual. It will be hard to discard your cellphone without a thought, or turn on your engine to go and buy bread, the images will hover above your shoulder and haunt you like a gardian angel warning you ""do not do it!"".

2737066,4,B000MMLOAG,"Edward Burtynsky is a Canadian photographer who makes art out of the least ""artful"" objects imaginable.  Everyday items such as crates, boxes, metal containers, etc. - items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects d`art by Burtynsky`s camera.  He achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them, that is.  Even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through Burtynsky's lens (but didn`t we already know that from ""Wall-E""?).  He is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where Man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures (i.e. the workers in those places), with their uniform clothing and robotic movements, become part of the industrial landscape.

""Manufactured Landscapes,"" a documentary about Burtynsky's work, has much of the feel of a ""Koyaanisqatsi"" about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns.  Indeed, director Jennifer Baichwal and cinematographer Peter Mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms, as their own camera records Burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in China, a dockyard in Bangladesh, and the construction site at the massive Three Rivers Gorge Dam project in China.  With their fluid camerawork, the filmmakers match point-for-point the beauty of Burtynsky's images.  In fact, the movie opens with a stunning eight-minute-long tracking shot of a Chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows.

The movie does less well when Burtynsky gets around to articulating the ""themes"" of his work, which, quite frankly, come out sounding confused, contradictory and decidedly half-baked at best.  But it is as a purely aesthetic experience, highlighting image and form, that ""Manufactured Landscapes"" resonates most.  In the case of Burtynsky, perhaps, a picture really IS worth a thousand words.",1246579200,2,2261,5.468390804597701

2737071,5,B000MMLOAG,"I was deeply moved by Jennifer Baichwal's documentary on Edward Burtynsky's photography in China -- then was surprised to find the range of online reviews.

First, to think of this film as ""about China"" misses the point that Burtynsky and Baichwal make throughout the documentary about the close global interrelationships that are reshaping vast swaths of the Earth's surface. Yes, we visit enormous centers of e-recycling in which computer components are torn apart pretty much by hand in dangerous, depressing regions of China -- but the film makes the point that the e-waste is ours as Americans. Yes, we see the oil and energy industry disrupting the Chinese landscape like gargantuan hammers and swords -- but the film makes the point that these efforts are shaped by the worldwide thirst for oil and energy in the current era of manufacturing.

The film's point is that we are fundamentally interrelated. Also, its ""slow"" style is intended as meditative. I agree with the strategy. This film does not preach -- just as Burtynsky's photographs are noted for their refusal to overtly preach at us. Both filmmaker and photographer are inviting us to ponder these images -- sometimes stunningly beautiful and sometimes terrifying. Sometimes we find that the truth is both beautiful and terrifying at the same time. Sometimes the images seem as distant as Mars -- and sometimes they seem so close to home that they are stunning, for example, when we suddenly notice that a mountain of gray waste includes parts of a common household steam iron.

I come to this film as a journalist who has spent decades covering the impact of faith and spirituality on contemporary life. If you're familiar with films like ""Into Great Silence,"" about monastic life, or even ""The Undertaking,"" a PBS documentary on poet-essayist (and undertaker) Thomas Lynch -- then you know that this is a very creative era in which filmmakers are experimenting with new spiritual vocabularies.

I would recommend this film especially for discussion groups. There's a whole lot you'll be eager to discuss in this film -- especially if your group is able to watch some of the extras on the DVD as well.",1204070400,,2170,4.986187845303867
2737072,2,B000MMLOAG,"This movie is created mostly based on slides and photos. It is incredibly slow with very little commentary. From the very beginning, it shows a huge Chinese factory floor for six to seven minutes with no comment nor music. The camera just walked through the entire floor from one end to the other. You can actually fast forward through the entire movie without missing much.

The deleted scenes and comments were more interesting than the movie itself. If you are interested in environmental photos, this may be for you. I would not recommend this to friends.",1201132800,14,559,4.822916666666667
2737073,5,B000MMLOAG,"The camera is at the end of a long row of workers. It starts tracking to the next row, and the next, and the next. The camera operator's in no hurry, and as the rows continued, I became agitated. I wanted it to be over. To do something, anything, I began to count the rows. Seven minutes later --- this was surely the longest tracking shot in the history of film --- we were at the end of an enormous factory in China.

You want to see this movie --- you need to see this movie --- for many reasons, and scale is the first. We talk about global warming and environmental degradation and maybe we see a picture of an ice cap and a polar bear or a giant landfill, but we rarely see how big these things can be.

Edward Burtynsky is all about big.

He started, decades ago, by wondering what happened to the quarries that produced giant slabs of stone. What he found were excavated masterpieces --- inverted monuments, exactingly carved, extending hundreds of feet into the earth. In their way, they're gorgeous.

In the last few years, Burtynsky has moved on to China, an agrarian country transforming itself, at warp speed, into an industrial powerhouse. That means: a factory that produces 20 million flat-irons a year. The third largest aluminum recycling yard in the world. A dam so big --- the largest ever conceived, by 50% --- that 1.1 million people had to disassemble their homes and evacuate 13 villages so the thing could be built.

Many of these images show factories and apartments that are new and shiny, light years from what we think of as sweatshop workplaces and workers' housing. But don't be fooled. Much of the labor we see is so repetitive that none of us would last an hour. And a lot of the processes in these plants throw off waste in such volume that residents of the Pacific Northwest and Canada are its beneficiaries.

But don't jump to the conclusion that this is a film Al Gore could have made. Mass production is not without beauty --- the photographs of Andreas Gursky prove that by making us think twice about supermarkets and lobbies. But Gursky digitally manipulates his images. Burtynsky just sets up his 4x5 or 8x10 camera, takes an insane number of shots, edits ruthlessly, then prints on giant sheets of paper. What we see is what he got.

And what is that?

You look at this film --- at women putting caps on wires thirty times a minute, at people scrounging through mountains of discarded computers in search of tiny pieces of value, at gleaners harvesting scrap in a stream of chemical waste --- and you think you will never buy anything in Wal-Mart again. And that's just for openers. The computer you're using right now --- how much did you pay for it? How much would it cost if the people who labored over its components were Americans, in a union and paid a salary that reflected their expertise? And then consider the true cost of your microwave, your iPod, your flat screen, and....

But that way of thinking is too narrow; this time, it's not all about us. Burtynsky is fascinated with China because it's creating new ""landscapes"" on a scale that dwarfs all other nations --- in a matter of a decade, it's recreating the process of industrialization that took a century to transform America. In China, we can see our past, projected at warp speed. And in China, we can also see our future. China, China, China --- for the first time, you get what a vast impersonal force resides there, and how it works in silent, compliant efficiency, and the connection between anonymous workers and sophisticated consumers.

As Jennifer Baichwal follows Burtynsky around, she shows how he works and what he chooses to photograph, but not what he thinks. That's deliberate. Although Burtynsky should be a zealot --- his father, who worked in a GM factory, died young from a cancer allegedly caused by lubricating oil --- he takes no position on the environmental changes he photographs.

If he presents his work as a political statement, he says, it's a take it or leave it offering: You agree with him, or not. And on you go to the next exhibit, the next movie. His aim is to invite you to think about desire and repulsion, about your attraction to products and your fear of what lies beneath their shiny surfaces. After all, he points out, ""We are consciously or unconsciously aware that the world is suffering for our success.""

Burtynsky's conclusion --- not shared in the documentary --- may come to be yours: ''I feel like I'm living in contradiction with myself. But I don't know any other alternative to how I live.... It's a dilemma of our times, in that there's no easy prescription for our ailment.""

His solution, however tentative, is to ""look at the world straight on, in a way that won't let us immediately turn our eyes away.'' Good thought. So don't just watch this movie. Share it with friends and family. And then pass it on. It's that important.",1201046400,14,4897,4.60849598163031
2737074,5,B000MMLOAG,"""Manufactured Landscape,"" the DVD and and film by Jennifer Baichwall, a retrospective and introspective documentary on Edward Burtynsky's work is a master piece in itself. The director took esthetic risks that allowed her to actual sign the work so that it is not just about the now world-famous environmental photographer. The film itself is worth watching for its form, and, obviously content. Even the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, Al Gore, enthusiastically endorsed it.

At the core of the film is, of course, Burtynsky's phenomenal work. For anyone who has not yet heard of Burtynsky's aeuvre, this DVD is the best introduction to it that they will ever find. For those who already know his astounding photographs for having seen gallery shows, his touring retrospective exhibition (2003-2005), or read his books, ""Manufactured Landscapes"" (2003, a catalogue to the retrospective), ""China"" (2005), and ""Quarries"" (2007), it is a key-document for the understanding of the philosophy, the esthetics, and the warm and thoughtful humanism of their author.

The documentary works, I think, like an artist statement. The viewer gets a strong sense of what inspired the artist, and how he understands his works' relevance to society.

The artist, if not obvious from the amazon description is primarily concerned with post industrial landscapes. This means functioning and abandoned factories, gravel pits, computer waste sites. The most savory image in the documentary is, I think, a small Chinese village where a group of older citizens stand hunched over gigantic mounds of computer waste.

2737077,5,B000MMLOAG,"I didn't know what to expect after the opening 8-minute tracking shot spanned a Chinese factory's considerable length. ""Manufactured Landscapes"" is about the work of Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky, but this film is unlike any other I've seen on the subject of an artist and his work. Burtynsky has made a name -and many beautiful photographs- in ""industrial landscapes"". Struck by the ways in which modern humanity has transformed Earth's landscape, he seeks out ""the largest industrial incursions"" he can find. His photographs are fascinating and surprisingly beautiful representations of the heart of modernization and globalization.

Director Jennifer Baichwal accompanied Burtynsky on several trips to Asia, observing the artist at work and allowing a movie camera to see the industrial landscape as he does. This gives the photographs context that they don't normally have, and Burtynsky takes the opportunity to comment in a spare narration. Baichwal wisely subscribes to the same philosophy as Burtynsky in never interpreting or demystifying the photos. I was pleasantly surprised to see how many of Burtynsky's photographs are presented in the film and amazed at how well the movie footage supports and directs the viewer into them.

After photographing extraction industries for 10 years, Burtynsky turned his attention to China, where all those materials coalesce and are turned into products we consume. We go with him as he documents the rapidly changing landscapes at a factory, a village that recycles ""e-waste"", a shipyard, coal mine, the incredible Three Gorges Dam, and China's fastest-growing city, Shanghai. A short trip to a shipwrecking beach in Bangladesh is particularly astonishing. ""Manufactured Landscapes"" showed me things I had never seen before. And it is content just to show them without judgment.

The DVD (Zeitgeist 2007): Bonus features include 5 additional scenes, a theatrical trailer, and 3 featurettes. ""Discussion with the Director and Edward Burtynsky"" (19 min) is very worthwhile. Richard Goddard interviews Baichwal and Burtynsky about questions of authorship, perspective, what the film brings to the photos, and touches on the controversial aspects of the Burtynsky's photos. ""Al Gore at the Nashville Film Festival"" (9 min) records the former Vice President's speech as he presents Baichwal with an award. ""Mini-Interview with the Cinematographer/Collaborator"" (5 min) talks with Peter Mettler about working with both a photographer and a director. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH.",1196726400,35,2554,5.577319587628866
2737078,5,B000MMLOAG,"Edward Burtynsky is a photographer out of Toronto that I first discovered three years ago. His subjects are the places where industry has most altered the land. He began with the trailings from mines. His tendency (for better or worse) is to embellish the beauty of these sites. The places that he's documented have grown to include the cross-cutting of the earth for train tracks, ship-wrecking of old oil tankers in India and now the amazing mass-production of commodities and the accompanying changes that embody China.
Although I have always admired Burtynsky's work, his reluctance to take a forward stance on his subjects, and his decision to rely upon expensive, clean, gallery prints of these embellished locations seems to me a mixed blessing. He seeks out and hence brings awareness of the sites, but then so refuses to give any hint at judgement- some could think it is fine just to sit back and buy the book. I find myself frustrated.
This film however, made by Jennifer Baichwal, encompasses all of the amazing strengths of Burtynsky's work, and then goes one fine step further. By simply interviewing the people who live in and around these landscapes, by documenting their work and their lives, the tenor is no longer neutral and clean. One cannot help but form their own opinion when faced with women heating up our discarded mother-boards outside of their homes, or seeing children (who most probably have never been in a car) standing barefoot in the oil that was stuck to the bottom of an outdated oil-tanker, scooping it up with a 5-gallon bucket. The director does not narrate, like the sometimes painful Michael Moore or even Al Gore- instead she quietly, beautifully shows us and lets us see, lets us understand. In the best sense, this film is educational.
(Ironically enough) I would like to buy this movie for everyone I know. It has changed the way I shop, the way I live. It has raised my consciousness and my understanding of the world. Try it, it is good.",1196640000,,1985,4.807017543859649
2737079,3,B000MMLOAG,"After viewing Canadian documentary filmmaker Jennifer Baichwal's ""Manufactured Landscapes"", you may not be able to ever look at a ""Made in China"" product label again without flashing on the film's unforgettable opening scene.

In a tracking shot that would make Orson Welles proud, Baichwal's camera dollies along the factory floor of a surrealistically huge Chinese manufacturing plant, passing endless rows of work benches, manned by thousands of employees. The shot dissolves into a striking, beautifully composed photograph of the entire milieu. The spectacle of this myriad of factory drones in their bright yellow uniforms, as captured in the photo, resembles a ""human beehive"" in every sense of the word. This is how we are introduced to the photography of Edward Burtynsky, who is the subject of this documentary.

Baichwal follows Burtynsky as he travels through China photographing devastating impact of that country's current industrial revolution upon its environment. Through Burtynsky's lens, it quickly becomes apparent that there is a substantial price to pay for such frenetically paced ""progress"" (especially after a visit to the Three Gorges Dam project, which has required the dismantlement and obliteration of 13 cities, brick by brick).

Burtynsky's eye discerns a sort of terrible beauty in the wake of the profound and irreversible human imprint incurred by such frenetic and accelerated ""modernization"". As captured by Burtynsky's camera, strip-mined vistas recall the stark desolation of NASA photos sent from the Martian surface; mountains of ""e-waste"" dumped in a vast Chinese landfill take on a kind of almost gothic, cyber-punk dreamscape. The photographs begin to play like a scroll through Google Earth images as reinterpreted by Jackson Pollock or M.C. Escher.

It is quite serendipitous that the DVD version is being released at a time when more and more of the negative global fallout from China's largely unregulated manufacturing boom is dominating the evening news.
