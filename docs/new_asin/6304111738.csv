779194,5,6304111738,"This is a great children/family movie that I grew up watching.  This film has a wide variety of aspects that children love to watch.  The main character, Robin McCallister (Devon Sawa), becomes an unlikely hero when he uses his computer savy skills to annonomously finance the surgery bills for a young boy yopu was injured in a fire.  Of course he can't pay for the bill out of his own pocket so he ""borrows"" the money from the rich father of a bully at his school.  the movie has many twists and turns and is very enjoyable to watch.  I could definitly recommend this movie for anyone.",1057276800,4,587,4.4485981308411215

Robin (Sawa) is a computer wiz and archery  champ, and steals money from large corperations and deposits it into  accounts for the poor on his computer. There is some archery rivelry with  classmate Jackson and romance between Robin and Marion(Chalke). With a  beautiful setting(Seattle, WA), there is also the fact that Robin's family  live on a horse farm, for all you horse lovers!

779198,5,6304111738,"This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. i started watching it during the middle of the show while it was on tv and have been looking for it ever since. devon sawa was really cute in this movie in a boyish way.  it's a retelling of robin hood, instead of actually stealing, Robin  McCallister does it over the computer. he has two close friends, John  Little and Will Scarlett. his girlfriends name is Marion and his enemies  are John Prince and Sergeant Nottinghamm. i think this movie was REALLY  good, and i suggest that you buy it and see for yourself",946166400,8,562,4.314285714285714

7861576,4,6304111738,"I remember watching this movie when I was a kid and spur of the moment thought I'd look for it.  You people that are selling it are crazy to be asking what you are and the person buying it for what they are asking is clinically insane.  Good classic movie but wow, guess I won't be buying it.",1397174400,,292,4.017241379310345

7861578,3,6304111738,"If you're a fan of Devon Sawa, you'll be pleased with this simple, non-complex re-telling of Robin Hood.

Devon's character plays a middle income kid from the corn belt whose parents strike it rich in the lottery, so everything changes--the parents buy a thoroughbred horse farm and spend all their time in a self-indulgent pursuit of their dream to raise and sell horses, leaving Devon's character to fend for himself in a new town, new surroundings and new prep school where, expectantly, he's the underdog/outsider.

Archery plays a big part, as you'd expect, and the love story between the teens is just as expected.

There are a number of humorous moments too, mostly from the bungling FBI agent, making it a good family film as well.",1363305600,,739,4.849206349206349
