7543881,4,B018AXRJYS,"I haven't watched this set yet, but I've seen it in its original release when it was still owned by Geneon.  Both the English dub and the Japanese version are fantastic, so you can't really go wrong either way.  I've heard from friends that some of the characters' English voices don't sound sincere enough, but to be perfectly honest, neither are many of the characters themselves, which becomes more and more apparent as the series progresses.  This series is a murder mystery for a reason, after all.  My assumption at this point is that anyone who is buying this series right now has known about it for quite some time, but I'll do a more complete review of the Sentai DVD release in a few days when I've seen some of it.

The packaging is excellent.  Rena, the most iconic character of the series, takes the lead on the cover, and each disc (four of which are shown in this review) is adorned with one or two members of the main cast.  These discs, as you can see, have fantastic art, and I was particularly impressed with the quality and the colors on disc 3.  Unfortunately, the art on each disc is also misleading, especially on disc three, which is about Keiichi and Satoko, and four, which is about Rika and Akasaka.  I also was not fond of the art of disc five, which is pure fanservice, with two partially undressed girls.

My primary grievances (and the reasons I dropped a star from this release) are that there are mild spoilers in the cover art (particularly on the spine), and that despite the compact package, there is absolutely no insert in with the discs.  You can clearly see where disc one and two are in my picture that there are prongs for holding some kind of paper insert, but it didn't come with any.  Even a single page insert with a little bit of art that mentioned how many episodes are on each disc would be so much better than including prongs but excluding the insert.

Fortunately, the discs themselves do tell you which episodes are on them, indirectly.  The series is divided up into six different story arcs, and each disc contains all episodes from that arc, allowing viewers to watch them as sort of self-contained ""movies"".  It's a bit strange that Sentai decided to do this, as the Time-Wasting chapter is only two episodes long, while the following arc, Eye-Opening, is six.

This is mostly a review about Sentai's release and not about the anime itself, so I will update it once I have rewatched this series in its entirety.",1458086400,9,2468,4.549773755656108

7543884,5,B018AXRJYS,"I'm relatively confident that this is the best horror anime by far. I've seen roughly 170 anime all the way through, and I can say this is definitely my favorite. Previously the blu-ray for this (season one) was released in Japan without english subtitles for $400. I didn't speak Japanese when it came out, but I really wanted to watch it in HD so... I learned the Japanese language. That's how amazing this show is.

On to a review. I have NOT watched the English dubbed version of this, so if you only watch dubbed anime, then I'm not sure how well all this will apply to you. I'm not great at reviews so I'll just hit the key points.

Plot: 10/10
It would be very difficult to say much about the plot without giving any spoilers, so I'll be as generic as possible. The show takes place in a rural village called Hinamizawa. It's a peaceful village save for the night of the annual cotton drifting festival during which one person dies and anther person disappears. Is a person the culprit? Is it the 'ogres' Hinamizawa is rumored to keep hidden? Or is it the curse of a God known as Oyashiro-sama? The answer is that there is much more going on behind the scenes than one might think, and it's up to the protagonists to figure out the mystery and save their village.

The show is essentially a series of arcs that all begin at roughly the same point in time. Once an arc is completed (they are on average five or so episodes each), time is reset and another arc begins. If you were to watch the show without understanding this structure, I'm sure it would be very confusing. Despite this structure, there is very little repetition between events shown in the arcs, because each arc heavily focuses on a different character. The arcs don't necessarily end in cliffhangers, but they do leave questions to be answered. It isn't until we reach the final arc that everything begins to click and (as long as the viewer was paying attention) the truth can be fully understood.

It's my understanding that the follow up season (Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kai) will be released a  few months after this one. That season is where the answers are really expanded upon. If you like this show, I'd recommend that you find a way to get your hands on the sequel as well.

Music: 10/10
Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni (this show's actual title) has, in my opinion, one of the best if not the best opening songs in anime history. The background musical scores are also superb. The voice acting is excellent, and each character's voice complements their personality perfectly. Like I said, though, I've only watched it in Japanese, so I can't vouch for the english voice actors.

Characters: 10/10
Character development in this show is exceptional. They are all highly believable and most of them are likable and relatable to in some way. Honestly I'd find it difficult to root against any of them. Four of the five main characters are female, but the group dynamics never devolve into a stereotypical harem. None of them are mere archetypes i.e. the tsundere, the childhood best friend etc. They're all distinct right down to their speech patterns. I refuse to include any spoilers, so that's all I'll say on the matter.

Art: .../10
If there is any weakness to Higurashi it would be the artwork. It's a relatively old show, and the artwork is similar to others created around the same time. Artwork preferences vary from person to person, so I'm sure it wouldn't be off-putting to everyone. If you do dislike it, you'll get over it quickly, because the content is so engrossing. If what you want is a show with lots of pretty, colorful explosions, watch the FATE series, because unfortunately you won't find those here. As a side note, there IS gore in this anime. It's not shown frequently, but it is there, and it's drawn to be anatomically realistic (I.E. not just a bunch of mono-color blood squirting everywhere).

Overall: 10/10
If you like horror/mystery anime, then you'll love it. It's as simple as that.",1452816000,19,3994,4.622002820874471
7543885,5,B018AXRJYS,I would so buy this...if it weren't for the fact that season 2 has never been licensed in the US and is therefore never going to get a blu-ray release. So disappointing. But I'm going to rate this 5 stars anyway because the show is amazing and absolutely deserving of a 5/5.,1452729600,,274,4.288461538461538
7543886,5,B018AXRJYS,I love this show. It's not the greatest animation but that plot and the story is just fantastic. Plus the animation improves a lot in the next seasons so you have a lot to look forward to. It's just a great series. The first season is a question arc  and the next season is the answer. The characters are really fun and the conflicts they deal with are intense!,1452729600,3,361,4.231884057971015
7543887,5,B018AXRJYS,"Overall you will not be disappointed with this show. I could tell you a boat of details about this show, but why spoiled the fun for you. I just hope that they will dubbed the rest of this series. Season 2 helps fill in the details, very much",1451606400,2,242,4.0625

7543889,5,B018AXRJYS,"Allow me to say I bought a copy of this treasure for 60 bucks on ebay last month and considered myself lucky. Well, muck my luck, because I have just been royally screwed. No matter...this here is a boon to society, an anime whose company dropped out without dispersing rights returning from limbo. It gives us hope for renewal of past shows, and makes me worry that $104 spent on Evangelion might have been wasted. But, I digress, because this review is about, arguably, the greatest horror anime ever made. Let's get started with Higurashi: When They Cry.

PLOT: Based off of a visual novel about people slowly going insane, told from a different timeline and character perspective each time. I beg you to hold out, not knowing what's going on, because it's worth waiting to see the second season. When will that see a release? Anywho, basically each arc lasts 4 episodes around the time of the Cotton Picking Festival, and something called ""Oyoshiro's Curse"" causes one of the main characters to lose their marbles and kill soneone or die themselves. That's it. Pretty clear cut, when you think about.

CHARACTERS: Some of the quirkiest cliched characters from recent memory. You've seen them all before, but they're just so darn likeable. The members of the main batch are all enjoyable to watch, and their friend dynamic is unparalleled (at least in the beginning). Besides the detective, the doctor, and the photographer, the rest of the characters come off as...irksome. Especially Mion's grandmother and the old yakuza-knockoffs. You'll like these characters, and you'll feel bad for their misfortune.

MUSIC: Mostly cicada's chirping, hence the title. Music is not the strong suite of this show, save the opening. The opening sets the perfect tone for a summer of concealed evil awakening, especially the opening chant. If you have not seen it yet, check it out WHEN YOU WATCH THE SHOW. Part of the enjoyment of anime is being surprised with a really great opening, doncha know?

ANIMATION: Pretty bad. The designs are nice concepts, but they do not translate to the screen well. They at least move fluidly for the most part, but these characters always seemed awfully flat to me compared with other animation styles. The backgrounds are very tonal, pretty, yet foreboding settings, even if they aren't always drawn well. However...

HORROR: This is a horror/mystery anime. The animation really pulls through in conveying the characters' slow descent into madness, and offers quite a few jump-scares or lasting chills. The atmosphere of the town and its curse is the greatest asset, playing off to an extent, but not as well as, Hope's Peak Academy in ""Corpse Party."" I visited Shirakawa-go, the Japanese town this anime was based off of (there were even Higurashi tablets at the shrine), and let me tell you from first-hand experience that it is a beautiful place. That is essential, because the horror behind Higurashi is the beating and maiming of that beauty into an ominous desert that becomes more isolated and haunting the more ""possessed"" its inhabitants become. Everything is hunky-dory one moment, then BAM: the system starts to tumble and crumble down the hill of chaos. There isn't that much gore here (though you might still get queasy) but the added mystery creates a worthy tone of discord that adds to the horror.

This anime is worth every penny, and I am sad that I might miss out on special features by nabbing the old Geneon release. It is a staple in the classic anime fan's collection. Heck, you can't bring up horror in anime without Higurashi at the helm. However, don't expect a satisfying conclusion: this season only poses questions. You will not see any of them answered, or be satisfied with outcomes, until season two rolls around. Nonetheless, questions are good: they keep you engaged. I will not be buying this copy, since I already own the original release, but I urge you to experience this thrill ride for yourself. It is worth the buck if you've got it (even if it probably won't look much better on Blu-Ray), and who knows just how long it may last on the market? This may be the start of a new resale trend. Take my word as you see fit.",1449100800,14,4184,4.828451882845188

7543894,5,B018AXRJYS,This show is just brilliant in every aspect. It's subtle nuances are perfectly in tune with the pacing of the show. The plot has many twists and turns which makes the viewer practically chomp at the bit for answers. The soundtrack is so eerie and desolate that it engrossed myself and even my younger sister enjoyed the series for the amazing work that had been put into it. To really sum it up the show is something that you must see to really enjoy for yourself. Definitely worth the money.,1480032000,,492,4.477777777777778

7543900,3,B018AXRJYS,This video series plays like a game. It rewinds every 5 episodes and presents a new slant on events that end in tragedy.,1470009600,,120,4.260869565217392
7543901,5,B018AXRJYS,"First, a review of the series itself. The basic story is told in a series of arcs. In each arc, something happens that causes a certain character to snap and go insane, ending the arc in the deaths of several characters. That's the basic structure, but what gives Higurashi character is its cast. The first couple episodes of each arc are dedicated to showing the characters interacting with each other, giving us clues to their normal personalities. When the arc inevitably goes downhill, this makes it more heartrending to see. Watching it, you'll soon pick up the cues that tell when a character is losing sanity, and you'll fear for them. Amazingly well done storytelling. The animation isn't bad, either. The character designs are rather cutesy at first glance, and this helps in the bonding scenes with the main cast. But Studio DEEN knew what they were doing. Their character designs still work when the horror and violence ramp up. Despite all of the horror in the series, it ends on a truly amazing, heartwarming note.

That's all I'll say for the series itself. I would rather not spoil it. Now for Sentai's release. This is basically a rerelease of the version FUNimation got from Geneon, Bang Zoom!'s original English dub included. The English isn't too bad. My preference for the Japanese is mainly for the fact that I'm more attached to those voices (especially the always-amazing Tamura Yukari as Furude Rika). There aren't any extras to speak of, but that doesn't hurt at all. The series itself is amazing and worth the money. I would suggest getting the Blu-Ray. In 2006, when this series originally aired, HD wasn't exactly popular for Japanese TV series, and the overall quality reflects that. It still looks good, just don't expect something amazingly sharp like more recent releases.

Seriously, if you're a fan of horror or just want to see something that influenced anime to today, buy this series. Do note that you won't get the full story unless you get the second season as well. Thankfully, Sentai has released that, too, for the first time in the US. Lastly, to any parents reading this, if your kids are young, don't let the cute designs fool you. This series is full of violence and very disturbing situations. An example: the most famous scene is of a very young girl stabbing herself in the head while an older one looks on and laughs. If you don't want them seeing scenes like that, you shouldn't let them see this.",1468022400,3,2448,4.77122641509434
7543902,5,B018AXRJYS,It's higurashi of course it's amazing,1464912000,,37,5.333333333333333
7543903,2,B018AXRJYS,"This is a review of the video quality,  not the actual show itself. Higurashi is one of my favorite anime of all time but the quality of the DVD is terrible! I own other DVDs from Sentai Filmworks and other studios that do not have this terrible of video quality. I'm not sure what they used as their source for the video but when you play the video all of the edges of the lines and colors are very pixelated and it's not just slightly; it's very, very noticeable to the point that it's annoying. (See image I took from my tv) My Sailor Moon DVDs have better video quality then this DVD does and that anime was made back in the early 90s.  I am honestly afraid to purchase the Blu-ray for the show because if the DVD quality is so bad I have to wonder if the Blu-ray quality will be just as terrible.  If you're a huge fan of the show I would recommend buying it but to do so at your own risk if you are a stickler for video quality because this one definitely missed the mark. Hopefully the next DVD set will not look as terrible but I'm not very hopeful.",1464825600,7,1057,4.096618357487923

7543905,5,B018AXRJYS,"When They Cry (Also known as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni or When the Cicadas Cry) is one of those horror/thriller/mystery animes that really sticks with you.  There are questions raised, and eventually answered (though you may have to wait for season 2 for some) and mysteries abound, and the story is absolutely amazing.  There are plenty of cheesy, and almost satire-like comedic moments from time to time, but it only makes the serious ones more jarring when they happen.

It's one of my favorites of the genre, and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good mystery.  Be sure to get season 2 as well when it's released!",1464220800,,625,4.654545454545454
7543906,5,B018AXRJYS,"Finally, Higurashi has been released in America at an affordable price! It is one my favorite anime series ever and the best horror series.",1463788800,,139,4.833333333333333
7543907,3,B018AXRJYS,"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, When the Cicadas Cry, is an excellent mystery anime. The story has characters that start out rather generic, but over time they become fleshed out.

The tone of the show is much more melancholic rather than horror; The story starts off with one of our main characters moving from the city into a small town. This town is so small that all the residents know one another and all the students from all grades share the same class room. The town's new resident makes friends with a group of girls of different grade who play games as a part of their ""club activities"". This group is the main focus of the show.

The first season of Higurashi is split into 6 question arcs. Each arc is a seemingly self contained, they happen over the same timespan as there is a time loop. Each loop tells the story of one of the characters, answering questions from the previous arc and presenting more questions in turn. By the end of the story, you should have an idea on what is happening, but you should be confused on why. The second season has the answers to all questions and is known as the answer arcs.

One of the greatest things Higurashi does right is the contrast between the normal lives of the students and the brutal murders that take place involving them. Each arc has one or two episodes that highlight the happy and rather silly club activities. The rest is a downward spiral of despair for the characters. Sometimes they are betrayed, driven insane, or killed by an unknown source.

Overall Higurashi as a story deserves a full score. The problem lays in this release. The packaging is rather poor, the videos are far below DVD resolution, and the video is interlaced (480i). This is no problem on a CRT TV, but on a computer or modern TV things look bad. The subtitles are sub par; They are yellow and the translation is not as good as some subgroups out there. It is sad that one can download a product off a reputable site and get better quality than if they by said product.

That being said, it is great that Higurashi made it to the U.S. and wist it is a sub par version, it is still a good show. I recommend this to anyone who wants a physical copy of it. If you have never seen Higurashi before and are looking for a mature anime that requires some thinking on your part, defiantly check it out.",1463702400,,2331,4.39907192575406
7543908,5,B018AXRJYS,"This is the first time I've seen this series.  I've been for a good while contemplating buying the Vita Version but since it hasn't been translated yet into English I decided to wait.  And now the anime has finally come to blu-ray!

Like an anime version of American Horror Stories.  After ever few episodes something horrible happens that concludes the arch and then it restarts with the same cast of characters going about getting cursed in all new exciting ways completely obvious of their past doings.  A part of me feel like that statement might be seen as sarcastic, but it really not.  Each sections is genuinely creepy and the characters all change ever so slightly through each version so no one person stays the good guy, bad guy or in one instance the two buddies became indifferent towards each other simply cause of different choices made.

Now apart of that is due to the anime origins in a visual novel (pick your adventure game)  With the main character choosing to follow along different characters, most likely a dating sim mechanic gone horrible wrong (or right if death and mayhem is your goal.)  But this isn't Corpse Party, not gory beyond approach, not saying it cute and fluffy Happy Tree Friends either, there's a good few parts that made me cringe from some truly disgusting imagery. but the overwhelming messed up feeling of Corpse Party isn't present, and in many ways its welcome considering the series is 24 episodes long.

So the reason i gave this 4 stars or possibly wanted to give 4 but could convince myself to is the animation is borderline terrible.  incredibly low budget with some simply strange looking drawings. that said the audio in Japanese at least is spot on.  the creepy kids transform from cute lovable characters to possessed monsters incredibly fluidly without it feeling forced or contrived.

Also the story since it's broken up into almost completely unrelated arches it easy to get lost or wonder why things happen.  I've heard that in season two answers actually come forth... as for season one answers don't ever come, its more of an experience of cute lovable town, turned to (bad word) over and over again.

If your a horror fan of any kind, and willing to explore a world that simply isn't fully explained but more experienced then I'd say its a total worth while watch.  As for horror anime there aren't many out there that are actually scary, most simply muster creep imagery but never actually tap into what makes horror terrifying.",1463443200,,2493,4.776223776223776
7543909,5,B018AXRJYS,"I was able to binge watch this on Blu-ray. It is a must-watch for horror fans.

I love how the series is full of mystery and intrigue, banal-seeming interactions among big-headed, cutesy characters . . . and sprinkled throughout are moments of unbelievably sinister tension. There's a great deal of build-up. When I showed the first episode to my boyfriend, he wanted to turn it off, but then he was shocked by what came next.

7543919,3,B018AXRJYS,"While this was a fairly interesting murder mystery, I can't really jump on the bandwagon
and recommend it. The series isn't a little gory, it's video-game gruesome. Definitely not
for children, or adults unless they have a very strong stomach.
The story is told in six chapters, each of which apparently occurs in a different timeline,
as people who die in one chapter appear alive and well in the next. Very confusing. And
the town should be called Bipolarville. as every character has at least two separate
personalities, one sweet and innocent, the other Amityville evil.
The English dub is beyond horrible. Keiichi's voice is okay, but the girls are terrible. I
found the illustration very cartoony as well, as though the artists were all hungover. Don't
let the beautiful cover art fool you.
In the end, a murder mystery must have a resolution, and this fails in that regard, too.
After setting things up nicely: Is it a demonic presence, a human conspiracy, or simply
a serial killer at work, the question is never answered, and I for one won't waste my money
in the hopes that season two will unravel things.",1462060800,,1115,4.782383419689119

7543922,5,B018AXRJYS,"This is one of my most favorite animes, and its sad how underrated it is. It's a mix of gore, murder mystery, suspense and even legit drama. Keichi moves to the small village Hinamizawa.

There he befriends Rena, Mion, Satoko and Rika. Four girls who welcome him into their gaming club. The anime starts out very cutesy and chibi like, but much sooner rather than later, it jumps right into the horror/gore parts.

It REALLY does not screw around or drag out. At first it seems like it's going too, but it doesn't. One of the best parts of this anime, is that it keeps you wanting to figure things out.

You feel like a detective watching it, trying to figure it all out. I should warn you though, it is NOT for people who can't handle gore. This anime is filled with it, and even one specific scene is VERY gritty and gruesome, with Shion having to tear off three of her fingernails.

So if you can't handle gore, its not for you. But if you can handle it, and like an anime that keeps you figuring and guessing, then it is for you. However, its crucial you also buy/watch Season 2. Season 2 has ALL the answers.

I also LOVE the beautiful cover art, and all six arcs are on each of the six discs. I do have one complaint though, and its not about the anime.

For some weird reason, on the side of the case, under the title, we see the twin sisters Mion and Shion....kinda making out. I really do not get why they put that on the case, since the sisters are not at all incest/romantically involved and never once show anything like this in the anime.

I'm not sure if the people who designed the cover art just watching the opening and simply assumed...? In fact, ironically, in this season Shion and Mion hate each other. So yea, I don't get why they they put that on the cover.

Otherwise, AWESOME set! Worth the price! A MUST for an anime collector!",1460592000,11,1853,4.304597701149425
7543923,3,B018AXRJYS,"Each arc could've been a self-contained story. It's like a story where the key characters keep trying until they get it right, over and over. It finally makes sense at the end. However, it kind of leaves you hanging, since the story isn't over. Maybe it's just my personal taste, but I was expecting more from a horror anime. I don't feel I got my money's worth. I can't give it more than 3 stars, even though it was well done. There is a 2nd season, but before I buy it, I'd rather watch it on Anime Network when it's out. I'd recommend checking this out online before buying.",1458950400,,577,4.302752293577981
7543924,5,B018AXRJYS,"This is horror anime done right. Higurashi deftly creates a sense of sustained dread, using scenes of shocking and extreme violence to create maximum impact, all while never losing sight of the greater story it is slowly weaving together.

I am not going to do a plot recap, because there is way too much plot to go over. Just know that Higurashi is constructed out of several separate, but connected arcs. How they are connected will be revealed in the second set. Each arc focuses on one of the main female characters, using their experiences to slowly peel back the complex layers of mythology and superstition that controls the small town of Hinamizawa.

The story telling in this series is top notch, using the arcs to tell complete, interesting tales, while also building a greater mystery at the same time. With each arc focusing in on one central character, the show manages to avoid cast bloat. Each of the main female characters is wonderfully realized, and the entire cast evolves as the show continues on. This show is extremely and brutally violent, but these scenes are spaced out enough where they work as a story building tool instead of a crutch. Also, the degree of violence escalates as the series moves on, ratcheting up the horror with each passing arc.

The art is the only aspect where Higurashi falters, although it sometimes works in the show's favor. First, the character designs themselves are awkward, with stick thin legs and arms, tiny waists, and giant heads for most of the main cast. The characters are made to look even more bizarre once they are actually animated, as the designs rarely stay on model, making some characters bend and warp as if they had liquid spines, and their faces contorting into odd, horrific exaggerated facial expressions. Proportions are also regularly off, with heads either shrinking or enlarging randomly. The animation can be crude and dirty, and there are times when things go completely off the rails, and the show takes on an odd, unfinished feel. This is most evident in the later two arcs, which are both more animation heavy. Still, it all somehow works. It shouldn't work, but it does. It gives the show a acid trip nightmare feel, especially in the second to last arc. The art and animation seem to deteriorate at the same rate as one of the character's sanity. I can't say if this is intentional or not, but it works. A perfect example would be the big fight in the last episode. None of the characters stay on model for more than a few frames. The movements are too fluid, and the bodies move in odd angles, but it just adds to the over all insanity of what is happening on screen. So, even though the art and animation are extremely low budget, it still somehow works with helping the show create its mood and tension.

Higurashi, or When They Cry, is a truly awesome series, and for those who can stomach some truly horrific violence, I highly recommend it.",1458518400,3,2933,4.700389105058366
7543925,5,B018AXRJYS,"I just wanna say first and foremost, I've waited YEARS to finally own this series. DVD or Blu-Ray, it didn't matter. I was introduced to Higurashi No Naku Koro (as it was called before today where it seems to be titled simply, ""When They Cry"") back in my freshman year at college in my anime club. I was mystified and captivated from the moment I lay eyes on it. When I found out there was a manga adaptation of the series, I immediately had to go out and purchase every volume I could get my hands on. It took me from 2009 to 2015 to finally gather all the volumes, but it was a mission well worth it. The art, the dialogue, the story and the characters, it's all so perfect. The manga version was simply horrifying with turn-the-page to jump scares when you least expected them, visceral blood and gore filled imagery and a chilling story all hidden beneath a seemingly sweet and colorful world of a small Japanese country side town filled with an endearing cast of characters. The anime is more or less the same with a few changes here and there, but overall, the same experience. An experience that you'll want to dive in to of course, no matter how terrified you might be to take that leap.

Higurashi owns a special place in my heart as I'm a self-published author (my book available right here on Amazon as a matter a fact). I was writing a novel since 2005 and went through draft after draft, write after write and nothing seemed to click. I felt like I was lacking inspiration and drive. Well, come an autumn day in 2010, I stumbled on a trailer for Higurashi and when it was over, my passion for writing and horror was re-inspired. Fast forward to 2013 and I finally finished and published my book. I cite Higurashi as one of my the inspirations for my own story and I will always treasure the series and the story it told, the characters that moved it all along and the horror that chilled me to my bones.

Now I'm not going to give any spoilers if your new to this series, but I'll tell you as much as I can. Higurashi is a tale that's driven mostly by the characters. There's Keiichi Maebara, the new resident to the quiet, peaceful town of Hinamizawa and it's mostly through his eyes which we see the tale of Higurashi unfold. Accompaning him is Rena Ryuguu, a sweet, endearing girl who has a love for everything cute with something seemingly ""off"" about her, green haired, sassy and older gal Mion Sonozaki who runs something of an after-school club for games and the leader of the clique, and two younger classmates, the aloof, but adorable Rika and the braty and trickster blonde Satoko. We follow these five kids as they go about their seemingly normal lives all leading up to a traditional, summer event called the Cotton Drifting Festival. Long story short, following this event, everything goes to hell and nothing is quite the same afterwards. That's as much as I'll say so you'll have to watch to find out yourself.

Highly recommend.",1458345600,7,2957,4.492565055762082
7543926,5,B018AXRJYS,"This anime never got the publicity it needed for such a wonderful story go tell! The art itself is nothing to gawk at being quite simple and plain at times, however for when it came out, it was considered good! If you can get passed the art and enjoy the story arcs it tells that are filled with mystery, suspense and murder (there is gore, but it does not dominate the series despite its sometimes highly graphic scenes), then you might just love this anime! Many would get confused at each arc, but the first season is merely the question arc. The second season which will FINALLY be getting its first American release in May, is the answer arc to the first season and ties everything in to make sense to the viewers, and overall ending an amazingly well done story!! As one of my top favorite animes out there, I highly recommend this anime to mystery/horror lovers that can stomach this series and enjoy a deep plot!",1458259200,,920,4.482142857142857
7543927,5,B018AXRJYS,"So far so good! Will update later about the quality of the whole set and the subtitles. One of the best psychological thrillers out there. It is a highly confusing and controversial anime, but the fact the blu ray developers broke it down into the four episode arcs really helps, and the quality is great. Yay sadistic violence!

You really need the second season to understand why this show is broken down into four episode arcs and why they are so similar but so different each time.

As far as the blu ray packaging and whatnot goes, it's fine - nothing to write home about. Much like other current blu ray releases it's simple economical packaging, no booklets or inserts, and nothing fancy or collector worthy. Also, I think the subs are burned into it, I haven't checked if I can force them off through the blu ray player menu options, but as far as disc options go, subs are burned in. This is also becoming an industry standard, sadly. Oh well. The quality so far is great - no visible upscaling side-effects.",1458172800,5,1017,4.551912568306011

8741891,5,B018AXRJYS,"This Higurashi DVD boxset came in perfect condition and was delivered much earlier than expected, which is a huge plus. The visual quality of all the DVDs is clear and decent, and the audio is great quality. The DVDs come with both the English and Japanese dubs, with English subtitles provided for non-Japanese speakers. There are six discs in the boxset; one for each of the six arcs in the first season of the Higurashi anime.

The anime itself is a classic drama / mystery / psychological-horror series, and is a must-watch for any mystery / horror anime fan. The anime adaptation may not be as well-developed as the original visual novels or the manga series, but it still definitely holds its own within the overall Higurashi canon, and is still remembered as being one of the most disturbing horror anime of the last decade.",1511568000,,831,4.731034482758621
8741892,5,B018AXRJYS,"There aren't many shows, particularly anime, that I can truly say kept me invested the entire time I was watching. When They Cry however (or as I prefer to call it by it's Japanese name, Higurashi) hooked me from the very beginning and didn't let go until the final episode of season 2. (which also has a release of the same quality as season 1) Without a doubt one of, if not my favorite anime of all time

Being able to own this series on Blu-Ray is fantastic and the release itself is pretty great. I'm not particularly fond of the rather risqu image of the twins on the third disk, but that's really the only problem I can think of with this collection and it's really just questionable. Everything I say here also applies to season 2, so if you have any interest I highly recommend picking both sets up. You are in for a ride",1507161600,2,830,4.286624203821656
