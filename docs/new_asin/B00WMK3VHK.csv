8713793,3,B00WMK3VHK,"I expected to see the fare well concert. Disappointed!. Bits and pieces of the same songs and interview segments. There should be a WTF choice for a rating. Only because of the Eric Clapton guitar lesson did I give it three stars, this is one of the scenes they repeat, with is ok because I did not pick it up the first time and probably never will. Still a great piece of history.",1492128000,,381,4.232876712328767
8713794,3,B00WMK3VHK,"Visuals and sound have been improved. The only problem is as another customer pointed out. They left in too little. The previous release had an extended version that included Steppin out, Sitting on top of the world, and Crossroads . This film needs more respect, TLC, and attention. Enough with the voice talking over perfomances. The only true concert of one of the greatest rock bands ever and it's long over due to bring it up to what it should be. A great final performance with a cleaner video and sound experience. 5.1 surround and all the improvements as done to Hendrix, The Who, Zeppelin, etc. please someone heed this fans advice and give this film the true and best restoration it deserves",1485993600,,701,4.7073170731707314
8713795,2,B00WMK3VHK,The audio and visual have been improved but they keep chopping off the length of the songs.  The 1975 EC solo version of Layla was stuck at the end does not belong here.,1478649600,2,169,4.121212121212121
