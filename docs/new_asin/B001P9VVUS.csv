8332744,2,B001P9VVUS,"I love Kafka and remember really enjoying this film (it's an adaptation of Kafka's ""Le Metamorphosis""). This will be going in my trash as soon as I'm done, it's an avant-garde interpretation film about Kafka's Metamorphosis. An amalgam of everything Kafka ever did and he wasn't one to object to revealing what his life was about.

In order to tell the story Gregor's life in film format, ground had to be broken and they had to try to sell the film so as to be understandable to the non-psychotic mind.

Naturally, the bug is the focus of the story, and the result is a marvelous looking picture, with a wonderful score, but it lacks any (with the exception of Kafka's story) dramatic punch.",1384300800,,692,4.617886178861789

8332746,1,B001P9VVUS,This is an extremely poorly made and badly acted black-and-white amateur film that is not worth a second look.  There is no discernible plot that makes any sense and little or no connectioon with the Kafka story.  The names of some of the people involved are clearly pseudonyms which sound more like the names porno actors take.  Is the whole thing a put-on?  That would be the most charitable view.,1260662400,,399,4.6571428571428575
8332747,4,B001P9VVUS,"I can't get this film out of my head, and I don't want to.  If you want something that makes you think, see this, then see it again, and then think about it.",1235260800,,157,3.757575757575758
8332748,3,B001P9VVUS,This film is so odd! Worth checking out. It's one that could be a Rocky Horror type cult classic.,1235001600,,97,4.157894736842105
8332749,5,B001P9VVUS,"I saw this movie, errr... maybe 10 or 15 years ago at a film festival. That was a LONG time ago, but I haven't been able to forget it.

I'm so glad other people will now be able to enjoy this cinematic experience (this movie is an adaptation of Kalfka's story ""Metamorphosis"" and a film Kalfka fans will especially get a kick out of).",1234742400,,334,4.21875
8332750,5,B001P9VVUS,I saw this creepy movie at a midnight screening. I'm glad it's finally coming out and I can add to my collection!,1234310400,,113,4.181818181818182
