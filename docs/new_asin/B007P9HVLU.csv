5102828,5,B007P9HVLU,"Okay, maybe my opinion is biased, as I attended the premiere of the film at MoMA last March. I met Patty, Eric, Courtney, Melissa, Patty's wife Christina, and P. David Ebersole after the film. It's totally worth seeing for any fans of Hole or the general music scene surrounding the band. So many other musicians are mentioned and shown that it's a great film even for those without much knowledge of Patty or the band. Now that it's finally been released on DVD, I'll be purchasing it. Ebersole did a fantastic job at tying in past footage with current interviews and commentary, and the film shows classic moments. Get it.",1346716800,,624,4.681818181818182
5102829,5,B007P9HVLU,EVERYTHING'S FINE thank you very much! I've seen the movie in theaters and I wanted to show it to my friends who didn't have the chance to see it.,1341964800,,146,4.068965517241379
5102830,5,B007P9HVLU,"For some time now, I have been reviewing movies from Well Go USA, and all of them have been either about martial arts or Asian history - great films, I must say. However, what was my surprise when I saw ""Hit So Hard,"" a movie that significantly departs from anything that I have seen previously from this entertainment company. This is one of the best rock & roll documentaries that I have had the pleasure to watch, and a great acquisition for the folks at Well Go USA.

Right from the beginning, we are told that ""Hit So Hard"" was not meant to be, and that it was the result of a fortunate accident. You see, Patty Schemel, drummer for the iconic rock band Hole, was given a video camera before they went on the road for their ""Live Through This"" tour. Consequently, she began to film anything that had to do with the band and its members. Under the leadership of Courtney Love, Hole is one of the female-driven rock bands of all time (that is, with the exception of Eric Erlandson, the guitarist). As a result of all the filming, Schemel compiled a lot of footage to generate not only a documentary about the band, but also about, as the subtitle of the film says, ""The life and near death of Patty Schemel.""

In regards to the band, we watch portions of videos from Hole's history and their tours in Nagoya, Japan; Lollapaloozas in Vancouver and Detroit; Brixton Academy, in London; Le Bataclan, in Paris, Pukkelpop Festival, in Belgium; and more. We also see Courtney Love with the late Kurt Cobain (of Nirvana), playing with Frances Bean, their daughter; the effect of Cobain's death and fellow Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff; and much more. Of course, Schemel also talks about her musical history, as well as her homosexuality and that of other lesbian musicians. She goes into excruciating detail about her drug addiction, which almost sent her to a ""Saturn Return,"" name given to musicians that die when they are 27 years old, such a Robert Johnson, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Kristen Pfaff, Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse, and others. She also explains how she felt after the producer of Hole's ""Celebrity Skin"" (1998) dumped her from the production, and replaced her by another drummer. This event, it seems, marked the beginning of her auto-destruction, and when her ex Hole partners talk about the making of that album, it makes you sad, as you realize that the music business can be cruel, as your friends apparently and allegedly don't fight for you.

""Hit So Hard"" is also full of interviews, including Courtney Love, who is always candid; actress Drew Barrymore; Gina Schock, drummer of the Go-gos; author Sarah Vowell; Debbie Peterson, drummer of the Bangles; and more. There are also revealing interviews with Hole's members, such as bassist Melissa Auf der Maur and guitarist Eric Erlandson, as well as Patty's mother and brother. It is also important to stress that the home movies footage of Love and Cobain are shown here for the first time.

Ably directed by P. David Ebersole, ""Hit So Hard"" is a very well-made documentary, with great narrative, and near perfect sequencing. The editing, done also by Ebersole, is superb, especially when we watch the split screen, as Patty talks about the making of ""Celebrity Screen"" - just awesome. The Blu-ray edition includes audio commentary by Patty and the director, an hour of additional homemade footage, reunion of the classic Hole lineup, and more. (USA, 2011, color, 103 min plus additional material).

5102831,5,B007P9HVLU,"Amazing rare footage, revealing the raw truth, the Cobains were not drug ravaged monsters all the time, and they loved their daughter quite a lot. The bonding of the couple with Patty was a magical time for all three, but once the dominos fell, they fell hard and harshly.

Hole has NEVER received the credit it is being the musical genuis band that they arem musically and lyrically.  And YES Patty, after hearing the story, you can tell quite well that you are not the drummer on Celebrity Skin. That douchebag producer wanted Courtney at the forefront, but in the end, even though I love that CD too, the passion is missing, it is polished up for the masses.

I am happy Patty has come to terms with her exciting life, and is happy where she is these days. One of the very best rock and roll docs I have ever seen.",1339113600,14,817,4.3618421052631575

5102843,5,B007P9HVLU,"As a fan of both Hole and Patty's i watched this with great excitement, if your a Nirvana fan you will love the never before home footage of a happy Curt and Courtney and the interviews with countless rockers from the early 90s period but this is all  back drop to a much more important and interesting story of a woman who caught all the odds to become a hugely respected hard hitting drummer. Respected by her pears as well as the press Patty while fighting a long history of drug and alcohol addiction pushed through and became one of the 90s more polarizing musicians on the scene. All to just get blown away with the now over powering drug addiction that at the hight of her fane found her homeless, living on the streets and panhandling for money for a little crack. How far a person can fall and how amazing a person can climb back to reclaim her rightful place as one of Rock and Rolls best drummers. This documentary has it all an amazing story with great never before footage of the Courtney and curt, you will learn allot about Patty and her world , which just happened to be one with the days biggest stars all of whom seem to not care at all.

5102845,5,B007P9HVLU,"Besides that Patty Schemel has always been one of my favorite drummers, this documentary is well done in terms of capturing her struggle with drugs and alcohol amidst the music and challenging events of the early 90s (death of Kurt Cobain, etc.).

It's so sad what she went threw, drugs can  really take over and addiction is no joke. I teared up a bit watching the video clips of Kurt Cobain holding his newborn daughter and other personal clips. I'm a big Nirvana and Hole fan and it was such a treat getting up close and personal. I felt like a fly on the wall, this documentary is like an all access, backstage pass. It's really worth a watch, especially if you are a fan. I'm happy that Pattty completely turned her life around and is doing so well right now.",1374105600,,611,4.177966101694915

5102852,4,B007P9HVLU,"To be fair, I wasn't a huge Hole fan.  I was a teen when all this great music came out in the 90's, so that was my main introduction to music.  So it's only fitting that I liked the Hole songs I heard.  And of course who didn't know who Courtney Love was and all that came along with her.  Had a time where I just didn't like her and it was hard to really like Hole.  Still those songs were good regardless.  This doc is very informative about that time and of this band that Patty was in.  Love the rare footage of the Cobain's and their home life.  Really makes it real and honest, we see how they lived and what their lives might have been like outside the public.  Sorry, off track, this doc is about Patty and her struggle.  Love how honest she was through the whole thing and letting us see the real her.  She was a really great drummer.  You hear another songs by Hole without her drumming, you can tell it's not her!

8520243,3,B007P9HVLU,"An interesting film about the origins of Hole. Great nostalgic footage and biographical details but it goes a little too much into Courtney's opinions and gets off topic at times.

8520244,1,B007P9HVLU,"Kurt Cobain left a drug rehab center in Marina Del Rey California on April 1, 1994 and was later reported missing. As you probably know, he was found dead just seven days later.

My name is Tom Grant. I am a retired private investigator and former detective with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

On April 3, 1994 (while conducting business as a California State licensed private investigator), I was hired by Courtney Love (who was in Los Angeles at the time), to locate her husband after he left a drug rehab center in Marina Del Rey, California. Ms. Love stayed in Los Angeles while I flew to Seattle to search for Cobain with his best friend Dylan Carlson. In fact, Carlson and I had been in the Cobain residence the night before Kurt's body was discovered in the room above the garage.

The police immediately concluded ""suicide."" I wasn't so sure. Neither was Rosemary Carroll, Courtney Love's own entertainment attorney. Ms. Carroll was also a close friend to both Courtney and Kurt. We both knew something was terribly wrong here.

After several months of intensive investigation, including dozens of taped interviews with Cobain's closest friends and family members, I reached the conclusion that Courtney Love and Michael Dewitt, (the male nanny who lived at the Cobain residence), were involved in a conspiracy that resulted in the murder of Kurt Cobain.

It appears this was not the first attempt on Cobain's life by Courtney Love, however, it was obviously the first to succeed.

In December of 1994, I began speaking publicly about the suspicious circumstances surrounding Cobain's death.

Facing the potential consequences of exposure, Courtney Love, her wealthy and powerful friends, her attorney's and the symbiotic ""rock press"" have engaged in an effort to keep the public from learning the true facts about Kurt's death.

These are people who are motivated by profit rather than truth. Courtney's attorneys have consistently threatened those in various media outlets with ""potential lawsuits"" if these journalists were to give me a platform from which to discuss my investigation of the Cobain Case.

As I predicted when I first began telling the public about the details of my investigation more than 21 years ago, no legal, criminal or civil, action has ever been taken against myself or anyone in the media who has covered this story.

In spite of the hot air they've been blowing all these years, this investigation has received coverage in hundreds of major newspapers, magazines, television and radio talk shows around the globe.

The pathetic cowards of this world can only blow smoke. Once they've been exposed, they run and hide

The events surrounding the death of Kurt Cobain are filled with lies, contradictions in logic, and countless inconsistencies.

Here is just some of...
What You Were Never Told:

Courtney Love was facing a divorce.

Kurt was in the process of leaving Seattle and his wife Courtney, when he was found dead.

Courtney knew Kurt wanted out of the marriage. Just weeks prior to his death, she asked one of her attorneys to get the ""meanest, most vicious divorce lawyer"" she could find.

Someone was using Kurt's credit card.

One of Kurt's credit cards was missing when his body was discovered.

Someone was attempting to use the missing credit card after Cobain died, but the attempts stopped when his body was discovered.

Cobain was in fear of his life.

The shotgun found at the scene was purchased BEFORE Cobain left for rehab in Los Angeles, NOT AFTER he fled the rehab as reported by misinformed media sources.

The shotgun was fully loaded with three shells. It was purchased and loaded for protection, not suicide.

The police claim there were no legible fingerprints on this shotgun!

The truth is, the shotgun wasn't even checked for fingerprints until May 6th, nearly one month after Cobain's body was found.

There was no ""suicide"" note!

The note found at the scene by the police was immediately labeled as a ""suicide note."" The police report states it was ""apparently written by Cobain to his wife and daughter, explaining why he had killed himself.""

But this note was not addressed to Kurt's wife and daughter and it says nothing about ""killing himself!"" This note was clearly written to Cobain's fans telling them he was quitting the music business. There was only a short footnote to Courtney and Frances and the handwriting contained in those lines has been questioned by several handwriting experts.

Courtney had another note she kept in secret.

Courtney was in possession of a second note after Kurt's body was found! SHE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE about this second note until several months later when information about it slipped out during an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine.

The second note, the one that Courtney kept in secret, clearly defines the first note which was found at the scene of Cobain's death. The ""second note"" from Kurt plainly states he was leaving Courtney and he was leaving Seattle. He was NOT leaving the planet.

Cobain was injected with 3 times a lethal dose of heroin!

Cobain's heroin, (morphine), blood level was 1.52 mgs per liter. This would require a minimum injection of 225 mgs of heroin, three times a lethal dose, even for a hardcore heroin addict. The drug Diazepam, was also found in Cobain's blood system.

The obvious questions:

1. IF Cobain injected three times a lethal dose of heroin, COULD he then pick up a shotgun and shoot himself? Wouldn't he have been immediately incapacitated?

Based on the heroin, (morphine), blood levels found in Cobain's body, preliminary research indicates Kurt Cobain would have been almost immediately incapacitated. He could not have picked up that shotgun. He could not have pulled that trigger!

2. If Cobain injected himself with a deliberate heroin overdose, why would he ALSO shoot himself in the head with a shotgun, leaving his baby daughter - the love of his life - with horrific visual images to remember him by? Why not just ""go to sleep"" on the overdose and never wake up?

In Addition...

Cobain was not barricaded inside the room as reported by misinformed media sources.

The stool which was supposedly wedged"" against the door was actually just sitting in front of the two unlocked doors that only led out to a balcony.

Cobain did not leave his Driver's License out for identification as reported by misinformed media sources.

The first police officer on the scene found Cobain's closed wallet, opened it to remove Kurt's driver's license, and displayed it in order to take a photograph.

The fact is - the police and the Medical Examiner have no forensic evidence that proves Cobain's death was a suicide. On the other hand, there's a substantial amount of evidence for murder.

The official verdict of ""suicide"" was simply a rush to judgement which eventually painted the authorities into a corner as reports of so-called ""copy-cat"" suicides began making the news.

As you examine this case carefully, you're going to discover there's much more to the events surrounding Cobain's death than what you've been told.

""Conspiracy""
The term, ""conspiracy,"" is merely a legal term describing the planning or plotting of a crime by two or more persons.

If I had reached the conclusion that only one person was involved in planning and carrying out the murder of Kurt Cobain, we would be discussing a ""Murder Theory,"" not a ""Conspiracy Theory"".

My job is to call it as I see it. I don't change legal terminology simply to avoid criticism in order to make my conclusions easier for the reading or viewing public to swallow.

It is what it is.

Defined:
Criminal conspiracy is defined as an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime or to perpetrate an illegal act.

Conspiracy crimes that are federal can include conspiracy to engage in criminal activity such as money laundering, conspiracy to violate federal laws, or conspiracy to manufacture drugs or weapons.

Conspiracy charges in state court are very similar, but there are many more crimes that will give rise to state conspiracy charges. While intent is key in any federal conspiracy case, only general intent to violate the law is necessary. Proof of the defendant's specific intent to violate the law is not needed, only an agreement to engage in an illegal act.

So according to the legal definition described above, there are literally thousands of true ""conspiracies"" committed every single day of every single year across the United States alone, plus many more thousands around the world.

""Conspiracies"" are very real.
Ask any police officer or prosecuting attorney.",1449705600,5,8627,4.971448467966574

8520246,4,B007P9HVLU,"I was prepared not to like this because of the other reviews, but it's actually pretty great.  Patty is a great person and her story is relevant.  I also think she is really courageous and has great humor.  The footage is fine--despite what other reviewers say, if not low-budget.  Who cares! There are two kinds of people in the music scene: those who are in it for the music, and those who are not.  Patty was and is in it for the music.  Her drumming on Live Through This was raw, hard hitting, and driven, the way all good drumming should be. This doc. showcases her life, her passion her coping with being gay, and her falls into addiction very well.  It's really a far reaching look at a lot of timely issues, told through the perspective mostly of her time with Hole, and it would therefore appeal to a broad audience.

The rougher part of watching this was seeing how vapid the scene was, and much of the people in it.  Patty and Kristin were a really tight rhythm section and I think when Kristin died, things gradually went downhill for Hole.  I was sad watching this for Patty, watching her being set up to be ousted from the band, for really stupid reasons, and the utter passivity and lack of loyalty by the other band members and the cling-ons.  It didn't just happen.  I'm really glad she managed to get sober after that. Her family are the ones who seem to really care about her.

This is a happy ending, which did not happen that often in the 90's.  It was so great to see her get her dog business going, find music again, and get married and have a child!  She deserves it!  Rock on Patty.  You're a great drummer and Hole sucks now!",1432080000,,1651,4.3257328990228014

And a warning to all musicians: don't ever let some low-life douche bag hired-gun label producer abuse you. Do your takes until YOU like them and tell the producer to piss off.  And whether you're in a band or a solo performer, you NEED a good manager (no, not the band's manager, your manager) to run interference and make sure you always get your fair share of credit, royalties, publishing, touring & merchandising revenue, etc., whether or not sick bastards like the producer who f'd over Patty come around.",1422057600,3,687,4.677685950413223
