7869430,5,6304380143,"This appears to be a satire on police approaches to domestic situations, but it is a true story!
However, despite the comedic aspects of the film (and reality), the fact that one sensible police officer acts like a human being raises the story above mere entertainment.
This film should be compulsory viewing for our, currently, heavily armed law enforcement agencies: some humanity can be an extremely powerful strategy for solving human issues.",1430611200,,446,5.208333333333333

Have now converted it to DVD format and can't express enough telling people how delightful and wonderful this movie is!",1351468800,,200,4.4324324324324325
7869432,4,6304380143,"I saw this video recently and loved it!  It's an amusing story  (supposedly true) of a young man just released from a jail term in Australia, and his desire to live a decent and normal life with a girl from his school days.  It has some scenes reminiscent (for Americans) of the hippie days in the late '60's here, and much good humor.  It manages to be funny without being slapstick or rude.  Very Aussie.",969408000,7,406,4.36
