7961145,3,B000065RTS,"An advent and birth of way too many teams to allow great rivalries and dynasties emerges and the game has not been the same since. I do not know what happened to season one's narrator, but season two's is a different person, and it has a detrimental effect on the overall presentation in such a pronounced fashion, it disappoints me so much I can not even watch it.",1390262400,,365,4.382352941176471
7961146,5,B000065RTS,"If you love hockey, you will love this set. Gump Worsley, Emile Francis, Serge Savard, Bob Gainey, Phil Esposito, Mario Lemieux, Wayne Gretzky, and a whole host of all the former greats talk about the game and their experiences. Highlights and clips are interspersed to underscore each player's account of how much they love the game, and how grateful they are. I've been a hockey fan since the eighties and have since learned a little bit about previous generations, but this really helps connect today's game to the past. One gets a sense for the culture and development of the game, while feeling the connection between the players over the course of its history. The players' insights really put the game in a greater perspective.",1364342400,,734,4.88

7961148,5,B000065RTS,"In addition to the first Legends of Hockey...this follow up is just as great.  Whomever put this series together, has a perfect score.  You don't have to be a hockey fan to really enjoy this short lived series.",1325030400,,210,4.5
7961149,5,B000065RTS,"The second DVD in this series is produced in exactly the same format as the first one is.  Very engaging stories and historical tidbits of a variety of players through the different eras in the evolution of the NHL.  The first DVD set in this series is definitely the one to buy, but by all means, this set is by far NOT a disappointment.  While some of the players contained in this series are truly all stars, I still have to vent that Bernie Parent was a horrible OMISSION!!  Not to take anything away from the Russian goalie Tretiak (who is profiled in this series), but to NOT have Bernie Parent in either of the DVD's is a mistake.  However, that aside, it is a wonderful DVD set that a person can watch over and over and not get bored with.",1256256000,,747,4.2695035460992905
7961150,5,B000065RTS,Great DVD I was really impressed with the total quality of the product in general. This was even better than I thought that it would be. If you are serious about Hockey buy this and Legends of Hockey Season 1. You will not be sorry.,1219795200,2,232,4.177777777777778
