2070845,4,B00029NMH2,"This is one of the best hero's journey themes in Anime.  Things start off ominous and then progress to an outright slugfest.

2070846,4,B00029NMH2,"For how old the series is, it's actually pretty well made. If you like Go Nagai, a guesser to the end, or even just plain anime gore, you'll want to get your hands on this classic.

The story line is excellent. Getting a model that is absolutely afraid of her devil side is very unique. Also, this particular plotline has so many twists that you don't know what to do with yourself. And it never gets too overdramatic. There is always space for light comedy. There are some parts in the show that get a little dragged on, but have patience with it.

The worst part of the series is the voice-acting, which was usually the case in the early days of anime. Dubbing was never great in the 20th Century, and I am glad that it has gotten better. It isn't the absolute worst dubbing, but DeviL Lady characters may tend to annoy you because of it.

If you are a big fan of Go Nagai animation, try this one out. Even if you are not, it can still be entertaining.",1252195200,,954,4.230769230769231
2070847,5,B00029NMH2,"One of the most obscure anime out there, a lot of people have forgotten how sci-fi anime is supposed to be. This is a perfect blenf ohorror, sci-fi, and action anime that chils the bones and keeps you wanting more. Also, it has a very interesting story-line. Where else would you find an anime featuring a supermodel who turns into a night valkyrie battling her own breed for the survival of mankind. The question remains, who is the good guy and who is the bad guy? The answer is obvious by the end of the series and is well worth watching all the way through. I remember renting this from a video store whe I was younger, now I'm proud to say that it's part of my own personal anime collection!",1237680000,,696,4.320610687022901
2070848,4,B00029NMH2,"In modern day Tokyo, a beautiful but fragile young supermodel, Jun Fudou, finds her ordinary life turned upside-down when she is visited by Asuka Lan, a shady and mysterious woman with a secret agenda of her own.  Soon Jun discovers that she can, when provoked, transform into a demonic giant, hence the title of the series.  Under Asuka's command, Jun is forced to track down monsters--some of who may actually be her close colleagues in disguise.  All the while, Jun's relationship with her best friend Kazumi begins to slide.

Created by Go Nagai, this dark, gothic-horror 26-episode series is most definitely not for young children.  In addition to having a complex, sometimes nail-biting plot, THE DEVIL LADY also has its lion's share of gory violence and nudity.  The battle sequences between the devilish Jun and the monsters are as bloody as you'd expect, and there are also scenes where several characters are nude.  Still some other episodes feature somewhat sexual situations; for example, at one point, Jun is tied to a bed while a character (changed into a demonic cat), draws her claw against Jun's chest and slurps blood from the wound.  Later, another character--Jason Bates--who, like our heroine, has the ability to transform into a devil beast, attempts to rape Jun.

To THE DEVIL LADY's credit, however, the show handles the above in a supernatural manner, so it's not so disturbing.  And while some may bemoan that the production values are on par with an old-school Anime--uneven cel count, and somewhat limited backgrounds, in many ways it makes it easier to stomach a show like this.

However, there were two things that ultimately made THE DEVIL LADY for me.  The first is its ominous musical score, provided by Toshiyuki Watanabe.  Sparingly used, yet memorable, it adds to the show's creepy atmosphere.  The main theme, in particular, a choral chant reminiscent of Carl Orff's ""Carmina Burana"" as well as Jerry Goldsmith's score for THE OMEN, is a knock-out.  The other quality that struck me about THE DEVIL LADY was the compelling portrayal of Jun as a character.  In between periods of killing, we see her overcome with remorse and shame for having committed such acts, and the very real pain we feel from this makes it all the more sad when she starts to become more monstrous and lose touch with her normal self.  This issue of duality adds a human aspect and credibility to what could otherwise have been just another throwaway horror Anime flick.

Although episodic in nature, THE DEVIL LADY manages to find a plot of its own.  While it does build to the typical apocalyptic conclusion and some episodes don't really move the story along, there are very rare moments when THE DEVIL LADY is not engrossing.  As a story about a person's downward spiral, it's hard to pull away from every minute of it, but the only episodes that truly succeed in maintaining a thriller/horror feel are the opening three.  Every one after that borders on predictable, but in all fairness, there are unexpected twists and just about enough intelligence to make the overall show not only an ideal choice for Halloween, but as a subject for discussion.  Actually, I found out that this show is a reworking of another series by Go Nagai; THE DEVIL MAN, only with a man in the lead.  To further compliment this show, it never even feels like a spin-off, so you wouldn't think otherwise.

Other kudos should be given to the folks at ADV for their handling of this series.  The visual quality on the discs is very good, and the audio comes across very well on both the Japanese and English language tracks.  The English dub is produced by the now defunct Monster Island Studios from Austin, Texas, whose track record has been mixed.  Their English track for NADIA was wonderful, but SAMURAI X, their previous project, was too stiff, acting-wise, and loose, script-wise.  THE DEVIL LADY's dub is somewhere in between.  The principal trio of Jun, Asuka, and Kazumi are all excellently voiced and well acted by Shawn Sides, Sin Rees-Cleland, and especially Camille Chen (the latter's screaming scenes, in particular, are phenomenal; you'd swear that she was in the situation for real!).  The supporting cast is hit or miss, but most of them verge on good; J. Shannon Weaver, in particular, is disturbingly creepy as the kid-devil Satoru.  The ADR script by Elena Carrillo is probably the problem I have with the dub; although faithful in spirit, sometimes it's a little too loose, omitting and/or altering some important lines.  This flaw, however, is toned down after the first volume and isn't all that bothersome after awhile.  Purists probably won't give the dub a chance due to the aforementioned scripting issues, but for patient dub fans, this one might be worth checking out for the performances I described.

On a final note, THE DEVIL LADY also exists as a manga series, and has some even more horrifying violence and some sexual scenes.  This Anime is tamer by comparison, although as mentioned, it's not for the kiddies.",1186185600,7,5036,4.884705882352941
2070849,4,B00029NMH2,"I was pleasantly surprised with Devil Lady. Though I don't have much of a care for Go Nagai (the only series if ever enjoyed that he made was New Cutey Honey), I do know something about him, and one of the things he's known for his constant fan-service and more humor-based stories. But occasionally he takes a dip into horror, and when he does he does a good job with it. Devil Lady, though, is probably his best, I think, because it sets an atmosphere and never gets away from that. In other words, it stays dark and tense throughout, with characters that have a lot of emotion.

The story in the Devil Lady series follows Jun Fudo, a beautiful fashion model who seems a little bored with life, and more than just a bit depressed. But one night, she is captured and forced to face a monstrosity that nearly kills her. That's when her powers come out, and she changes into the Devil Lady, a super-powered fighting creature with no mercy. Now, her life revolves around a new career, of hunting and killing demons and devils in the night. What follows is episode after episode of confrontations, usually with a lot of emotional or thematic undertones, adding a little bit of depth to what is essentially a blood-and-guts anime.

As for the negatives, though there are few, there was one that caught my attention: dated animation. And the surprising thing is that this is not an old anime. It was made in the late 90s yet it looks as if it came from the early to mid 90s. It seems washed, and at times it's darker than it needs to be, so much so that you'll be adjusting the brightness on your TV just to see what it is that's happening to the Devil Lady. Another thing that bothered me was the goofy Go Nagai trademarks, and the one that really had me saying ""huh?"" was the Power-Rangers-growth of the monsters and Devil Lady, so that they can battle among the skyscrapers. For me, this was enough to take a point away from this collection.

Still, though, the overall value of this collection, as well the quality of the story and horror in Devil Lady, makes up for all that and I was very willing to give this DVD an easy four. Though it's no masterpiece, it certainly is one of Go Nagai's best. If you like darkly themed horror with a lot of violence, then Devil Lady is something for you.",1145059200,2,2291,4.411347517730497
2070850,3,B00029NMH2,"After seeing several of Mr Nagai's previous works(Getter Robo/Black Lion/Devil Man/Cutey Honey/Iron Virgin Jun) my hopes weren't too high. I was nicely surprised.

 The story is entertaing enough and not hard to follow. The animation was ok but nothing great. It was too dark sometimes to see the action clearly.

 The human character designs were allright but the monsters designs have an 80s to early 90s style that I wasn't too fond off.

 The dubbing is the only thing that irked me. I prefer to listen to the english dubs on most shows, but these performances started to get annoying rather quickly. It's as if this show was made in the early to mid 90's with the style of dubs that were everywhere in anime back then. Surprising because ADV has had some really fine actors/actresses working for them for some time now and none of them appear here or at least have a major role.  After the 2nd or 3rd episode I switched to the Japanese track.

 Another irk was that (after the 2nd disk I think) the extras were exactly the same thing with a clean opening and ending and some ADV previews.",1100476800,5,1093,4.564102564102564
2070851,5,B00029NMH2,"In 1972, manga creator Go Nagai was approached by a Japanese TV network about the possibility of a series based on one of his comics. Nagai suggested that a new series of his, 'Devilman' might be just what they were looking for. This marked the beginning of a 38-episode run that was not only a success, but also set an indelible stamp on Japanese horror for some time to come. Twenty-five years later, in 1997, Go Nagai's dark, twisted, and polymorphously perverse images were reborn in a different guise. This time as 'Devilwoman.'

Jun Fudou is a successful fashion model, lushly attractive and in demand. Her best friend is young Kazumi Takiura, another model who, for a younger generation. Into this happy-go-lucky life-style intrudes Lan Asuka a member of the mysterious 'human alliance.' Asuka tricks Jun into a confrontation with a demonic creature, and the model discovers that she also has demonic powers, and perhaps, relishes the killing. At least until she returns to human form. As the episodes progress, Asuka explains that Jun is 'neotenic' - progressing toward devil-hood, but still retaining her human soul.

From this point on the story continues to develop unexpected complexities.  At first a 'use a monster to skill monsters' story it quickly becomes clear that Jun is more than a little horrified by her own transformation.  Her encounters with Jason Bates, who shares her heritage makes it ever clearer that she cannot leave her humanity behind any more than Jun can now relinquish the power of her new form.  And Asuka's cold use of Jun's powers make it clear that what appears to be human agendas are no better than the demonic agendas that oppose them.

The struggle within Jun will be replicated in the world about her as the demonic comes into direct conflict with the human.  But nothing is as it seems, and the viewer must be careful not to leap to too many judgments.  A war is being fought over the future of the world, and everyone is suspect.  Jun and Asuka represent opposites in a struggle for power where good and evil seem alarmingly similar.

Go Nagai's style is a bit rough hewn, but the strength of the story quickly transcends the simplistic, somewhat retro artwork.  Nagai uses the contrast between the beautiful and the horrific to generate tension, and does not hesitate to use sensuality and violence.  This is a series for a mature viewer.  The questions it asks are sometimes confusing, and the answers are often ambivalent, but the overall effect is of a compelling story of a dark and heroic struggle.

Two technical issues keep this from being an enthusiastic recommendation. First, the art and animation are completely retro in look. It seems a shame that 1997 technology should be used to recreate a 25-year-old 'low-fi' look. So much of the action is put in the shadows that it is almost impossible to make out what is happening, occasioning much fiddling with the contrast and brightness settings. The worst sin, though, is the English dubbing. I have seen plenty of anime where the dubbing is weak or clumsy, but this is the first time that I felt the English script was completely misleading. Stick to the Japanese with subtitles for a much more enjoyable and sensible experience.",1091577600,20,3238,4.852994555353902
2070852,4,B00029NMH2,"I love the Devil Lady!  I started out watching Devil Man and eventually moved on to Devil Lady.  It starts out with the story over a model who becomes the devil lady.  You see her transformation from quite reserved woman to the demon woman as the series progresses.  I paid around $30 bucks for each DVD in the 6 DVD.  I wish that I would have known that the price was going to be so cheap for the whole series.  I say go for it, you have nothing to lose.

8024531,5,B00029NMH2,"Never judge an anime by its cover art. I avoided ""Devil Lady"" for years on the assumption that it was just another gory splatterpunk anime, a genre that tends to be strong on creative transformation sequences but pretty abysmal otherwise. However, I found that I underestimated this show. ""The Devil Lady"" has heart and a fascinatingly gray moral core.

""The Devil Lady"" is a horror story, but looking below the surface, you could also describe it as equal parts&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellsing/dp/B008YRL6WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellsing</a>, X-Files, and X-Men.  It tells the story of Jun Fudou, a beautiful but timid fashion model who finds herself drawn into a battle for humanitys survival. She has a strange gene that allows her to change into a demonic monster, but unlike most of these ""devil beasts,"" she retains her sanity and conscience while transformed. Jun is drafted against her will to fight other devil beasts by an ice-cold blonde named Lan Asuka who commands a secret, government-sanctioned paramilitary organization (Hellsing  but note that ""Devil Lady"" predates it by several years). This is a shadow war  kept out of the media, to end the threat of monsters who often look like ordinary people at first, and fought against the backdrop of a gradually unfolding conspiracy (X-Files). Finally, the shows gray morality centers around Jun herself, a mutant of sorts who is fighting to save a world that hates and fears her, even as other, more violent mutants call her a traitor and mark her for death (X-Men). Get the idea?

Its a weird mix that could have ended disastrously, but ""The Devil Lady"" pulls off its formula with aplomb. For starters, this anime is wonderful about taking its time when appropriate. It will slowly set up a creepy scene with music that makes your skin crawl. At other times, quiet, sad scenes with similarly apt music will break your heart. (If you haven't noticed, Im a fan of the score.) It also features a manageable-sized cast of characters who almost all develop as the anime progresses. You may be alternately impressed or shocked by people you thought would be background characters, and part of this series cruel appeal is that youll want a lot of happy endings that often won't materialize.

The writing is very sharp, and its plot twists pass the litmus test of making even more sense after a second viewing. There are some phenomena that are never completely explained, but I feel its acceptably ambiguous; a ton of weird stuff *is* going on, and you're provided all you need to make sense of the story. The rouges gallery of monsters is awesome  sometimes a bit weird, even considering the wild premise, but always creative and grotesque. The action sequences are well-done  not usually flashy or impressive from an animation standpoint, but their quality is consistent and does the job, and the character artwork itself during battle is top-notch.

""Devil Lady"" does have a few possible turn-offs despite its quality, though. For one, the animation style looks very dated for a turn-of-the-millennium series, and the artwork can sometimes be noticeably dark in the literal sense. Youll encounter quite a few scenes with dark-brown figures walking down a dark blue corridor in dim light, and the whole thing can literally be hard to see. (I think a good remaster on Blu-Ray could mitigate this through sharper clarity and contrasts.) Theres also a lot of light nudity, but it makes sense in context (to heighten the animal nature of the transformed devil beasts), and it isn't there for fanservice: you won't find a single jiggle animation or gratuitous upskirt shot in the entire series. The English dub voicing is apparently a matter of some contention. I personally *loved* the dub, but some other reviewers who seem friendly to dubs did not, so you may have to try it yourself to judge. Lastly, this anime shouldnt be attempted by people who are easily depressed, because it can be a humongous downer. Once the engineers start shoveling coal in the main character misery train, its full steam ahead until episode 26, and the sheer volume of unhappiness can become draining after a while.

One quick, last note: despite his heavy billing, this iteration of ""Devil Lady"" really isn't mangaka Go Nagais baby. Nagai did create the character, and his original manga introduced Jun Fudou and Lan Asuka, but the similarities end there. The anime adaptation completely reworked the story and even much of the basic concept, so, love it or hate it, most of the credit for this TV series rightfully goes to Chiaki Konaka (series creator / screenplay) and Toshiki Hirano (director).

As of the writing of this review (2015), ADVs release of ""The Devil Lady"" is out of print, but its not impossibly expensive or hard to find if you get it used. I would *love* for another anime licensor to pick this one up and give it the Blu-Ray treatment. Its honestly one of the best-thought-out and most compelling anime Ive ever watched, to say nothing of being a great tale of dark suspense. The Devil Lady deserves better than to be cast into out-of-print hell, and if we're lucky, someday she'll claw her way out.",1448755200,,5214,4.98849252013809

8024534,4,B00029NMH2,"Jun Fudou, a pretty but inconspicuous and reserved young woman working as a model in Tokyo, one day is torn out of her well-ordered life: a mysterious, ruthless woman named Lan Asuka tells her that mankind is being haunted by genetically mutated monsters and that only she, Jun, has the power to fight against them. As she is being attacked by one of these monsters, the unbelievable happens: Jun turns into the Devil Lady (a kind of primordial woman or goddess) a wild, demoniacal woman with formidable powers who will in future give a hard time to the attacking fiends.

What seems like a typical Japanese fight and monster story turns out to be, if you look at it closer, a study about human subconsciousness: the monsters are nothing but humans who do not manage to cope with their inner drives, instincts, secret wishes and obsessions, which, if the individual is under a great deal of stress, break out and turn them into dangerous beasts. Jun's nature is very similar to the monsters', but she turns into the Devil Lady only in order to defend herself and others, which explains why in this form she still wears human traits and does not forego the capacity to be compassionate. Although this exasperates Lan Asuka and the Human Alliance which she belongs to and who understands herself as an institution to save mankind, Jun refuses tenaciously to give up her humanness and to simply butcher off the monsters; instead, she still sees the human being in them and gives them the chance to go back to their humanness, as she, too, after every fight becomes Jun Fudou again and takes up her everyday life.

The fights of course do not leave Jun unchanged - she is confronted over and over with her own fears, insecurities and complexes, most of all with her incapacity to love herself; but also with her motherly instinct and her sexuality, which shows her incapacity to bring love and desire together, and also has a lesbian note. The more Jun manages to integrate the Devil Lady with her human self the stronger and more self-assured she becomes, but little by little she must realize that Asuka is following her very own plan in this whole scenario, and fate takes its course...

A very moving and at times very cruel story, confronting the viewer over and over with the question where the limits between human, godlike and devilish lie; whether the contrary of ""good"" is perhaps not actually ""evil""; whether a human being who believes to be godlike is not perhaps by far worse than someone who manages to accept his own inner demons.

The dark pictures (most scenes are set at night, during storms or in darkened rooms), the ingenious art direction and the hypnotic music play their own part in taking the viewer into the story's spell. Very interesting from its psychological depth, although many will probably simply see it as an action story with horror elements. But be warned - it is not recommendable if you have weak nerves.",1394582400,5,2939,4.723196881091618

8024537,5,B00029NMH2,"Written and created by Chiaki J Konaka, the show-runner of Air Gear, Armitage III, Digimon Tamers and Serial Experiment Lain, this adaptation of the Devilman Lady series - Go Nagai's remake/sequel to his Devilman masterpiece - shows what would have happened if Akira Fudo and Ryo Asuka had been women instead of men as in the original Devilman. Though it doesn't have the same explicitness like in the original manga, this series' becomes a clever metaphor on social appearances, intolerance, bigotry, and prejudice as a fashion model comes to term with a genetic condition that turns her into a Devilman, a creature that, instead of becoming a heartless monster, manages to keep her human consciousness.

What I loved in this series is that Chiaki J Konaka knew where he wanted to go with his story. In fact, I loved the mood he set in the first episode whose tension reveals - but not in a verbal way - that Jun Fudo senses someone stalking her. Also, the composition, camera angles, and colors in the episodes foreshadows what will soon happen between Lan Asuka and Jun Fudo, whose relationship takes a masochistic turn as Asuka forces Fudo to participate in a war that hides other motives. As such, this series tries to tell its story in a cinematographic way instead of using more conventional rules, though I feel this movie strategy is more present in the episodes that Chiaki J Konaka wrote. And right till the end of the twenty-sixth episode, one can see how the plot's twists were there all along.

Another aspect I loved in this version is how the writers kept the Miki Makimura character from the Original Devilman and turned her into Kasumi, a high school kid whose friendship with Jun evolves and contrasts with Asuka's, who is the real antagonist of this story.

For the soundtrack, I thought Toshiyuki Watanabe's music was excellent, that it nourished the series tragic and tense mood, and the tunes used for the Opening and Ending credits were great choices. As for the animation, it keeps a consistent quality over the episodes, but as it is done for a television budget, don't expect it to be top notch for there are some episodes where the animation is more restrained than in others.

Nevertheless, this series shows how one can do an excellent version of a popular Japanese manga series, but still make it a personal interpretation through its underlying themes.",1354233600,,2384,4.821515892420538
