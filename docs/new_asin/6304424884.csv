8486808,4,6304424884,"For the professional film/music critic my four star opinion might seem rediculous, but the low budgit, down to earth, no gloss approach is what Link Wray's music has always been about. The real stuff, however it comes  out is what you get. Not some orchestrated, dubed over version. The  interviewer was a little obnoxious, trying to interject and finish Link's  sentences. But hey, you could tell he was just excited to have the job of  leading Link through the interview. But, Link didn't need leading. He has a  fantastic recollection of the chronological order the music evolved and  he's very enjoyable to listen to. He has one of the greatest attitudes  around. You can tell that he has thoroughly enjoyed his life and career. He  has none of the bitterness some musicians acquire over the years. And the  best part of course is the concert footage. Yes it's simple and raw, and  that is the magic. It's so simple yet the music moves you at the inner most  core of the soul. To quote Link, it's a spiritual thing.",943920000,4,1019,4.636871508379889
8486809,1,6304424884,"I suppose one has to weigh up between having an actual video of this much underrated genius of the guitar as being a real bonus, and the disappointment of the amateur camera work and poor sound quality which is  on it!  (The video was shot at two of Link's concert venues in the 90's in  England, and, to be fair to the product, it would appear that recording  opportunity at both was probably very limited for the technicians.) If  there is any consolation, the interviewing with Link throughout the video  gives a fascinating insight into the real person, and provides a wonderful  verbal account by Link of the people with whom he has worked in the halcyon  days of Rock'n'Roll ! It's a great shame that there doesn't appear to be  any available footage of Link's earlier days.",927763200,3,780,4.594202898550725
