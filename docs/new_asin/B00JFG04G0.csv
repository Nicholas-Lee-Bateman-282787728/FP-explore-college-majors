8650540,3,B00JFG04G0,"As a person wanting to learn Chinese pole, this is proably the best thing out there however it's one of the few things out there. As much as I loved the tricks performed in this video, I felt it was not fully explained. Basically in the video, he would talk and show the trick and then demonstrate, which can work for some people. But he does not ease into the techniques gently, in fact this video seems rushed. I would also like to state this video is thirty minutes long and I think the price needs to be lowered, or the DVD redone to make it an hour long.  I'm somewhat disappointed, I was hoping for a full hour, excellently explained video but only received half of that, as I mentioned before he rushes the acts in the video. He proably spends less than three minutes on one of the ""moves"" at most five.  I wish he went into more detail, instead of ""just do what I do."" I have only seen one other video from the complete pole series and loved it. It talks, and it doesn't rush into it. They'll show the hand movements befor getting into the pole lesson. Maybe you have to watch the others, in order to do this one? I don't know.  I would still say get it, because it does teach you, and does sometimes explains the ""moves"" well.  I just hope the second Chinese pole will be better, and the other dvd's as well.  I would also like for this price to be lowered to at least eight dollars or ten because that how much I feel it is worth.",1486944000,,1440,4.16546762589928
