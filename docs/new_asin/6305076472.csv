7883108,5,6305076472,This is now out on DVD but it is also available in Netflix.  If you like very light comedy with a lot of slap stick you will enjoy this series.  British humor is usually fun and this one is almost G rated I think.  Mr. Faulty is a real goof ball and his wife who runs the hotel with him would probably drive any man bonkers.  I would suggest you check with the seller to be sure it is VHS if that is what you desire.,1363996800,,416,3.802325581395349
7883109,5,6305076472,"John Cleese once remarked that he did as much with ""Fawlty Towers"" in 12 episodes than Lucille Ball did in several years of ""I Love Lucy"". When I first heard that, I thought Cleese was being as crass as Basil Fawlty. But you know something? He came darn close.
This volume of ""Fawlty Towers"" contains three of the best episodes, and it is the one tape out of the four-tape collection that I play the most. ""Hotel Inspectors"" shows Basil at his most fawning, his most insincere. Ditto for ""A Touch Of Class"". But the real show-stealer is ""Germans"", perhaps the single most funny half-hour in sitcom history. Most people speak about the famous scene where Basil goose-steps around his German patrons, after he's repeatedly admonished the help not to mention the war. But everything in this episode is pure comic genius: Basil's griping with Sybil and the orderlies at the hospital; the exasperating attempts at hanging up the moose's head; and the Major's senile non-sequitors are hilarious. As the Germans ponder how the British ever won the war, the obvious answer is: If every English soldier was John Cleese, the Third Reich would have laughed to death.",1087862400,2,1155,4.838383838383838
7883110,4,6305076472,"The Germans contains the episodes The Hotel Inspectors, The Germans, and the very first episode of the show, A Touch Of Class.
The Hotel  Inspectors is a classic. Really hilarious confusions develop - above all  because of Basil Fawlty's prejudice and total lack of common sense,  increased by his unbearable wife Sybil's well-meant 'encouragement'. A good  laugh! One of the best episodes of Fawlty Towers ever!
The Germans is  a somewhat overrated episode which does not come up to its reputation. All  in all it's not particularly funny - things go a little TOO exaggeratedly  chaotic and crazy in the end.
A Touch Of Class, however, is good fun.  On the usual humouristic level of this show.
This video certainly is  worth the money. Only regret: The bits of the interesting interview with  John Cleese are placed BETWEEN the episodes which is a bit annoying, since  you probably don't want to watch the interview every time you feel like  laughing over Fawlty Towers!",967075200,3,972,4.895705521472393

7883113,5,6305076472,"This is the one episode that EVERYONE remembers from thetwoseries of Fawlty Towers - it features a very ill Basil Fawlty who is running around trying to keep all his guests at the hotel happy. Only to forget that he has some German's staying. Not wanting to offend them he states to all his staff, ""Don't mention the war!"" It's amazing to see Basil walk up to the German guests and talk about the war non-stop, to such an extend that he makes one cry, to cheer her up he begins marching hilariously backwards-and-forwards giving the Nazi sign and pretending to be Adolf Hitler.
Classic brit-com that you must see...",967075200,3,615,4.6
7883114,5,6305076472,"Fawlty Towers managed to be the funniest comedy series in the history of the world, thanks to its excellent writing and the glorious comic talents of the amazing John Cleese. Second to him is the clueless Manuel, a waiter from Barcelona who only understands SOME English and whose head is Basil Fawlty's squeezie ball. Also present are the shrewish Sybil Fawlty and the brainy waittress Polly.
""Hotel Inspectors"" send Basil into a frenzy when the news comes that the inspectors are in town. He quickly licks the boots of the man he thinks is the inspector and verbally pounds everybody else.
""Germans"" is possibly the peak of funniness that is only reached elsewhere in ""Kippers and Corpse"". While Sybil is hospitalized with an ingrown toenail, Basil is preparing for some Germans, a stuffed moosehead and a fire drill, the latter sending him into a perfectionist shriekfest.  Watch for Cleese's weird imitation of Hitler.
The first episode has quite ""A Touch of Class."" Basil's determination to attract a better class of guest leads him to lick the boots Lord Melbury and snub a Cockney man. Needless to say, things go awry.
Seinfeld never got this good. Neither did Boy Meets World, or Sabrina, or anything else. Fawlty Towers takes the gold medal for comedy.",964051200,,1261,4.92018779342723
