7983377,5,B00008G8YI,"Beautiful version of the film in a cool case. The VHS i received was perfect. I love the format. It's much warmer looking and sounding than DVD. The music is full and organic. The color has a rich and satchurated, artistic look to it. The movie feels natural and the pace and pitch are slightly lower and slower than DVD which I feel is too sped up. The VHS version feels alive compared to the cold DVD version. This is a great representation of a great film.",1440115200,,459,4.287356321839081
7983378,5,B00008G8YI,"This is a creepy horror thriller that reminds me of the orginal Night Of The Living Dead. The performances are solid and despite its low budget, the film moves at a very fast pace. It has a wonderful gothic atmosphere while being set in the suburbs. Don Dohler was an unappreciated genius and this is a fine example of that. And the creepy title sequence is unforgettable.",1351728000,3,372,4.567164179104478
7983379,4,B00008G8YI,"I love Don Dohler movies .... the ones that are all in good fun, bad B-movies that you can laugh at (but in a good way). This is a departure from that. This still fits the B-movie category, but this had a real plot, was more on the dark side, actually pretty good. More in the horror category than alien/ufo type stuff. Without spoiling it, I enjoyed the cemetery scene where the husband puts 2+2 together and figures out what's going on. While I enjoy Dohler's other films more (The Alien Factor, The Galaxy Invader), I really enjoyed this too. It's a perfect late night movie.",1338681600,2,578,4.462264150943396
7983380,3,B00008G8YI,"Don Leifert, aka Mr. Longfellow, was my English and Theater teacher in high school.  I picked up Fiend on DVD as a tribute to him, after his passing in October.  He wore his B-movie roots and heritage on his sleeve, and spoke fondly of his collaborations with Don Dohler.

He was a discerning critic, despite his work with Dohler - and often engaged his students, friends, and family in robust discussions about their favorite films.

I awarded Fiend 3 stars out of respect for a great friend and teacher, and to remind people that humanity and passion exist behind any project.

In the end, Eric Longfellow is nowhere near as interesting as the man who portrayed him.",1290297600,5,668,4.6752136752136755
7983381,3,B00008G8YI,"Its 1979 so won't you come on down to the Don Dohler school for independent shoe string budgeted schlock found here in Baltimore, Maryland! All I can attest to is that there might not be great effects or a real good storyline to this turkey but I enjoyed it. I killed some time and sat down to view this gem and was quite surprised despite its rep that its not that horribly unentertaining. I had a laugh and viewed it for its worth. You have to respect that these people had a blast making this film. Don was recooping from a jilted SNAFU on the ""Nightbeast"" film he would later complete around 1982 and some money was leftover. I personaly enjoyed 1978's ""Alien Factor"" which he made with almost the same cast better.

Cheers",1169337600,4,727,4.425373134328358
