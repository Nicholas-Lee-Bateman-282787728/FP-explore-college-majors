8181419,4,B000NTPFMG,"This is an innovative and entertaining approach to an interesting story.  Even better, it did not subject viewers to Shania Twain's non-country ""country"" music.  Although not as non-country as Taylor Swift, Shania's musical offerings do not fit the country genre.  If not for Megan Follows' name on the bill I'd have passed altogether, but thanks to the magnetism of the stellar Ms. Follows I took a chance that resulted in an informative and worthwhile viewing experience.",1387929600,,473,5.197368421052632
8181420,4,B000NTPFMG,"This movie might not be ""it"" for the absolute Shania Twain fan, but for sombody who is interested in musical stories and backgrounds I think it is worth while watching. I loved the indian background on it especially with Gordon Tootoosis and Eric Schweig.",1375488000,,255,4.818181818181818
8181421,2,B000NTPFMG,Historically inaccurate movie. I was hoping to see more from the Mutt Lange era. Does anybody know what song was played in the club just before the Longshot performance?,1371081600,3,169,4.862068965517241
8181422,1,B000NTPFMG,"I found this movie on another streaming site. I had to review it because of its gross inaccuracies and total disregard for Shania's siblings. First off, the movie does not have one original song of Shania Twain in it. That should be the first clue on how bad it is. Unbelievably it was nominated for two Gemini awards. The Gemini is the Canadian version of the American Golden Globe awards for television. The acting is okay but the plot is horrible. After the death of Shania's parents she had to raise her younger siblings and this is what formed her into woman she became not the Hank Williams Sr. song ""I'm so lonesome I could cry.""  This movie is no where near historically accurate. It should be avoided at all costs.",1365897600,,723,4.519083969465649
8181423,1,B000NTPFMG,"telling the story of a celebrity's life is always a difficult task and this attempt failed big time. It's uninspired, lacks pace and the cast is completely wrong. For me - as a huge Shania fan - it was a massive disappointment.",1281830400,3,227,4.428571428571429
8181424,1,B000NTPFMG,"A low budget movie with miserable acting, repeating ""generic"" songs.
Certainly does not do justice to Shania Twain's musical quality.
Don't waste your time & money.
This DVD is a total garbage.

8181425,5,B000NTPFMG,I thought this movie was GREAT!!!! This movie was perfect for telling the story about Shania Twain. Megan Follows was GREAT playing her mother. I thought she did a GREAT job. Thank you SO MUCH for selling this GREAT product. Chassity_Crow2007.,1205193600,3,243,4.951219512195122
8181426,1,B000NTPFMG,"Having been a Shania fan since 1993, and having visited the Shania Twain Centre in Timmins and having read the excellent biography by Robin Eggar, this movie just doesn't cut it. They didn't even make the effort to film the movie in her hometown. The movie is filled with stereotypes and does a very poor job of tranlating some of the events in the Eggar book to the small screen.

If you are a fan of Shania Twain, save time and just read the biography, or better yet visit the Shania Twain Centre in her hometown where you can see history for yourself.",1197676800,7,554,4.378640776699029
