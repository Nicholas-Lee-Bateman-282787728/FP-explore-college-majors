7841648,3,6303248993,"This is part of Mill Creek's 20-pack Spaghetti Western set.  It is a full-frame, non-pan&scan English dub with grainy but acceptable picture quality.  The onscreen title is SUNDANCE CASSIDY AND BUTCH THE KID; the DVD packaging lists the title as SUNDANCE AND THE KID.  Runtime is approx. 79 minutes.

It's a very lightweight and easy-to-digest show.  To call it a comedy would be technically accurate, since everything that happens in the story is played for a laugh.  However, there is also quite a bit of very accomplished stunt and fighting activity thrown into the mix as well.  If this came out today, it would be called an ""action comedy"".

Giuliano Gemma, as Monty the city slicker, has more of a straight-man role to Nino Benvenuti's Ted, a straight-up hillbilly.  Antonio Casas is on hand as a hustler who keeps popping up to aid and abet (or does he have another motive?) the boys' schemes.  Pretty and likable Sydne Rome is the rich banker's daughter who ends in our heroes' camp after a botched kidnapping.
Things proceed toward a rousing conclusion aboard a moving train which is transporting a cache of the banker's gold.  (Or is it? - our boys are in the dark about a few things in the film, for sure).

This picture will not make anyone forget Hill and Spencer.  But for what it is, I was pleasantly surprised at the level of enjoyment I got from it.  A special nod to the great acrobatic and hand-to-hand combat setpieces featuring the two leads.  Each man is spry and lively, and the film really comes alive during their fights in a bathhouse and on a muddy hill.  Also, the train climax is funny and action-packed, with mayhem aplenty.

Runtimes are listed elsewhere at up to 103 minutes, meaning the version I saw has been trimmed considerably.  As noted, the print is acceptable but less than stellar, so completists might want to seek out a continental version for the full ""Monty"", pun intended.

7841649,3,6303248993,"The Italian title translates as ""Alive or Preferable Dead"" and the leading men are Giuliano Gemma and ex-Olympic-boxer Nino Benvenuti. For American audiences, however, the actors become ""John Wade"" and ""Robert Neuman"" and the shamelessly-contrived title is now ""Sundance Cassidy and Butch the Kid."" Don't let any of this deter you. The movie is an amiable, turn-of-the-century western which mixes action with comedy in a manner which, though hardly original or memorable, still qualifies as likeable. The blonde heroine shows refreshing spunk but the real relationship is between the two leading men playing long-separated brothers who must live toghether peacefully for six months in order to collect a $300,000 inheritance. (This arrangement has little to do with the actual story-line.) Both men are handsome and well-built and opportunities are found to get their shirts off. Gemma is shown taking a bubble bath and Benvenuti sweats up a sheen as he chops wood. Both men, who actually look like brothers, are also bare-chested as they're tortured with burning sticks but, alas, most of this sequence has been cut from American prints. The two men have such chemistry, in fact, that when they ride off together at the fade-out, one understandably wonders if the heroine hasn't been thrown into the story simply to trick audiences into believing that the two men are really ""straight.""",1116028800,,1387,5.252252252252252
