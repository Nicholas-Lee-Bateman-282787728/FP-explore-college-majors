8475460,5,B000MGB9CA,"Many people could not see the horrors of what we inflicted on detainees, detainees who were not only innocent, but in some cases, women, children, or men who were well on in their golden years. I'm not one of those many people. I have to look constantly and repeatedly as if it is some sort of defiance of my fears or disgust, as if it is the only way of purging my soul of my sins or the pride I once had being called American. Looking at this story kept me glued and transfixed with both, a number of times over.

The only light in this constant nightmare is the story that CBS' ""60 Minutes"" presented to us of one man who exemplified the personal courage required of the motto, duty, honor, country.

Specialist (SPC. the pay grade of a corporal) Darby, US Army, didn't look to become a hero, or seek medals. The overweight and bald man gives the impression of being the classic push-over, the anyone-but-a-hero type of man.

Character and the way we are in life might sometimes pivot on a single incident that will define us for the rest of our lives, as it did for Darby as he recounts receiving the DVD's. Some will follow the crowd without qualm, some will follow the same with regret, some will go against the grain for the pleasure of being different, but for some, they will go against the crowd when they have much to lose and know they have to do it anyway. The first three, are people of compromise, the last is a man of principle.

Consequence and coincidence came very fast for SPC. Darby who was on the verge of leaving Iraq when SPC. Graner gave him some DVD's so he could remember the experience of his tour. What Darby saw on the second one shocked him, then a nation, and then the world. Darby knew what army regulation, common decency, and articles of the Geneva Convention demanded he do. He left the items with the army's detectives, the Criminal Investigation Division, or C.I.D. These were our pictures of our inhumanity as a nation, to people who were made to crawl, forced to form a naked human pyramid, forced to masturbate in front of female American soldiers or officers, or remain still as dogs barked and snarled inches away from their genitals. (These weren't interrogation techniques).

But Darby's troubles were just beginning. As the arrogant and ever-vindictive Donald Rumsfeld testifies before Congress about the scandal, he commends Darby by name. Darby is in the messhall as the testimony is broadcast on the TV monitor to the troops throughout Iraq, the base, and the messhall. A friend whispers to him that he better scatter. The soldier packs his duffle, and is whisked away by CID, to one of the four sets of orders created for him.

So, SPC. Darby is hometown hero, right? Nope! Truth and conscience at any price wasn't as important to his hometown crowd that, like the local American Legion, placed a greater premium on image rather than integrity. He and his wife get death threats and are shunned by the community. Darby goes into hiding.

This is a powerful segment of ""60 Minutes."" It is a picture of a man who struggled with the decision that cost him a career and the community in which he grew up. It is the story of one man who remembered what it meant to be American, who acted for truth, justice, and the American way. Well, at least for truth and justice.

This is worth having, if you are inclined to see the same story over and over. If not, it would be overpriced as many DVD's are, at $17.50. It is an important story about who we are, and about a man and a soldier who followed his principles and served his country.

Joseph Darby is truly an Army of One.

Update: January 21st. All military tribunals are suspended. Policies of treatment of detainees are under review.",1231718400,2,3731,4.530460624071322
