8237059,5,B00103M0K4,"With regard to the previous reviews, I am in complete agreement that this is an opera well worth having and watching....with pleasure. My only criticism is minor, the ending is rather abrupt and arbitrary, without leaving me with the sense that the good guys really won the day through anything more than the writers need to wind things up neatly. A minor letdown after an evening of excellent singing.
As a matter of personal reflection with regard to castrati and countertenors. In either case, although I would hope we had none of the former performing during the age of recording, I find it quite difficult to accept them in a male part...that is not what we have done in the works created in the recent century plus. I feel the same of females playing male parts. It is a jarring note in this era except, I suppose, for those who are better at 'let's pretend' than I am.
In all events, while the book has its lapses, the  performers more than justify watching the piece...and then watching again  periodically.",1449187200,,1015,4.664804469273743
8237060,5,B00103M0K4,I like any opera by Meyerbeer but I particularly like countertenors . Someone else said this part should be sung by a woman. I dislike women with paste on mustashes and beards playing roles originally written for castratos,1417132800,,222,4.868421052631579
8237061,4,B00103M0K4,"A very nice production at La Fenice in Venice where this early Meyerbeer opera had its premiere in March1824. The production is quite stunning with its beautiful costumes and sets.

This was Meyerbeer's last and most successful opera for Italy before he moved on to Paris and great fame in the French capital. This music style is quite different from Meyerbeer's later French works such as Robert le Diable, Les Huguenots or Le Prophete all composed for Paris.

Despite the decline of the Castrato in opera many years before this opera premiered,  Meyerbeer composed an important part in the opera for the famous male soprano (Castrato) singer, Giovanni Velluti (1780-1861) who also sang in the local premiere of the opera in London in 1825 opposite Maria Malibran.  The soloists in this performance are all very good.

For those interested in the operatic works of the early 19th century this is a must since it was such an important and successful work by this great composer.",1396483200,4,978,4.903030303030303
8237062,5,B00103M0K4,I am a Meyerbeer lover and Crociato is the best of his Italian operas.  I like it as much as his French masterpieces.  I have Maniaci's CD and I enjoyed his performance.,1393113600,2,169,4.25
8237063,5,B00103M0K4,"Thank God for the Dynamic label, and thank God there is a new astonishing voice in the operatic world: Michael Maniaci.  First, Dynamic has made available a series of current performances of the cradle of opera: Italy's regional opera houses. This production from la Fenice blends an austere setting with colorful costumes, allowing the viewer to concentrate in the music and the performance.  Maniaci is a wonder, and i hope he gets his wish to retrieve all the pants roles now assigned to mezzos and sopranos but originally sung by castrati.  In his case, nature allowed him maturity as a male, but not the consequent voice change.  So, he is a mature male with a choirboy's vocal purity.  I admit one has to get used to it--mainly because the visuals simply do not correspond to the vocals.  Patricia Ciofi is another discovery.  We are so used to the Superstar system fostered by the Met and other major opera houses, that we never get to hear rare operas if there are no stars to sing them, and we never get to hear new voices that do not choose super stardom. The only disappointment is Fernando Portari, whose nasal, ugly tenor voice shows that is not really suited to bel canto. Pasini, Vinco, Polverelli, Zennaro are all quite up to the job as well.  I'm not an opera bedbug, but an opera fan.  and my DVD came with a Dynamic catalog, which I have already used to add more unfamiliar operas to my collection.  After all, who needs another Carmen?",1382486400,3,1455,4.604651162790698
8237064,5,B00103M0K4,"With all respect to ""Go for Baroque"".  I disagree with his vibrato premise.  Not all operas using castrati were baroque.  Mozart used them as did Rossini in the early part of his career.  Meyerbeer was following the style of the day and not harkening back 60 years to the baroque era.  This opera, written around 1824 (not sure of the exact date) is written far more under the influence of Rossini and bel canto singing that as a baroque opera.  Vibrato is much more acceptable and in tune (no pun intended) with the prevalent style of the 1820's and the vibrato is not out of place at all.  In any event Maniaci sings beautifully and is well worth the price of admission.  His acting isn't bad either and he's a cutie to boot!  His voice is not that of a counter tenor in that he apparently is singing in his natural voice and you can just hear how he has more lung power behind his voice than a counter tenor who often sings in falsetto.  I believe his voice comes most closely to what the castrati must have sounded like.  It saddens me he has not made more of an impact on the operatic world. He does have one beautiful solo album of Mozart tunes.  Patricia Ciofi, an experienced singer of baroque, classical and bel canto roles also sings beautifully.  My only objection is that the chorus, while singing fine, does not seem to put much effort into their acting and often appears to be just going through the motions.  Perhaps they weren't that familiar with the storyline.",1378252800,6,1478,4.4664179104477615
8237065,4,B00103M0K4,"Review of Performance of Meyerbeer's Opera Il Crociato in Egitto with Male Soprano Michael Maniaci.

The male soprano voice in today's world  (not sopranist or countertenor) is one voice in a billion people.  For this reason alone, this DVD (or the CD soundtrack) is well worth having and accounts for as many stars as I have given it.  The last castrato to sing the primo uomo role in the waning days of the great castrati was Giovanni Battista Valluti.

80% of operas were written before the year 1800, and 70% of the roles were for alto and soprano castrati, who were produced artificially to the tune of 4,000 - 5,000 per year during the golden age of the Baroque.  As the style of opera changed and the need for castrati diminished outside of church choirs,  Meyerbeer's opera faded from the stage and only rarely was attempted with substitute voices until male soprano Michael Maniaci was called in with little notice to replace the female singer originally cast in the lead male role.  Being able to hear a man singing the primo uomo role, therefore, is a treat.  This is even more so when viewing Michael on stage.

The one problem with the performance, of course, is the sound of Michael's voice, which has a very heavy vibrato, especially when he sings loudly and/or sings higher notes.  For listeners less informed about Baroque opera and more used to 19th-century / 20th-century opera performance, this difficulty may have gone unnoticed, especially considering the fact that all the female singers also had exceptionally heavy vibrato.  The preferred style and required technique of the Baroque age was to sing with very focused voices, required not just for the vocal beauty but also in order to be able to sing the often very acrobatic lines.

I never have obtained information that would indicate whether Michael's vibrato is the nature of his voice and/or the result of modern vocal coaching.  It is said that Julliard was not sure what to do with him, and I am not clear as to his coaching at Cincinnati.

This DVD along with the offered subtitles, therefore, provides the listener with an interesting experience, and seeing Michael Maniaci on stage may be satisfying to many listeners.",1292630400,3,2204,4.84
8237066,1,B00103M0K4,"I was filled with enthusiasm for getting my hands on this opera when I heard an earlier CD version on 1.fm Otto's Opera.  Maybe I googled inexpertly but this CD was the only version I found first time round and so headlong in my enthusiasm I rushed to submit my order.  And so the DVD arrived.

As far as I'm concerned, I did my dough.  The voices are of really mediocre quality.  The general production is lacklustre in the extreme.  When the curtain rose, there was a sheet bearing a cross as a sort of backdrop.  With its sagging folds, it looked a pretty amateurish job to me, a sort of far provincial repertory group production, and immediately I feared what might follow if this was the best that the stage crew could come up with.  And I was right.  What followed was of the same amateurish standard.

But I must be honest.  I've only played one disk.  I just can't bring myself to inflict the second disk upon myself.

I just wish now that I'd found the more expensive CD in my first google search.  From my reaction to it when I heard it on 1.fm, it would have been worth the extra money.  This DVD set, I'm afraid, is money down the drain.

I'd not seen anything from the Teatro La Fenice before - but from its reputation, I expected more.  Maybe its fame comes more from its architecture and its location than the quality of its productions.",1258243200,,1352,4.344
8237067,2,B00103M0K4,"Knowing the story behind Maniaci's brutal experience of having to learn this entire work in about two weeks before performing it, I honestly wanted to like it much, much more than I did.  The only reason this has any stars at all is because of the reason I bought it: Maniaci, who was head and shoulders above the other performers.  I can't really single out any of them for special mention, even in terms of how little they left me moved.  (Well, that's not entirely true; I understand that opera is not exactly an actor's medium and that singing ability must take precedence over acting, but nevertheless, I don't care for that much spasticity in my leading ladies.  There really isn't any excuse for that.)

Maniaci however was delightful, even given how frustrating the storyline was (I kept wanting Palmide and Felicia to run off together and leave Armando in the lurch) and how uninspiring the other performers were, and it's saying a great deal that the person who was the most engaging on stage in all ways was the one who had less than two weeks to come up to speed.

The staging was interesting -- a bit spartan as I believe La Fenice has been walking on its heels for some time.  I think I would have been far more accepting of it and even liked it had the rest of the opera been able to convince me to suspend my disbelief, but as it was, it never came close.  It may just be a matter of taste; others who like things a bit more stylized and artistically self-aware might like this performance.  For me, I prefer a little less strike-a-pose in my theater.

Honest to God, I really wanted to like this, especially given that I've been waiting on tenterhooks for MM to actually put out a CD or two of work.  His voice is light, nimble, and airy with a nice, dark stripe of richness underneath, like a good shoo-fly pie with a meringue shell.  There are some lovely hints of what's possible with a good coloratura and male soprano singing together, but sadly that promise wasn't realized here.  Buy this for Maniaci's work, and just keep crossing your fingers and hope he'll be getting a blasted CD out soon.",1225411200,2,2117,4.481770833333333
