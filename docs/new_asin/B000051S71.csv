7929383,4,B000051S71,"This video is nothing more than the women's all-around final from the 1996 u.s. national championships. The video is one hour in length, and does have highlights from the men's competition, but that's it. There is no gymnasts from other countries, just the women's final from the '96 u.s. championships. Gymnasts include: D. Dawes, S. Miller, D. Moceanu, J. Phellps, A. Bordon, and some others. Mary Lou Retton is NOT in this video, in case you were wondering.",1047081600,16,460,4.910256410256411
