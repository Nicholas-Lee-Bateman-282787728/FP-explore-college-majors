8656646,5,B00K7P6XHM,"LEVERAGE is the kind of twenty-first century high quality T.V. show (premier date was December 7, 2008) that should of stayed on television it only lasted for five seasons, the character cast consisted of PARKER- the expert grade A burglar and thief, SOPHIE-the professional grifter, ELLIOT-the strong man and muscle, HARDISON-the high tech computer hacking genius, and last  but not least NATE-team leader whose seven year old son died due to lack of medical insurance. In my review title if you add the numbers 1+4=5 which is the number of people who make up this TEAM OF JUSTICE and retribution for those common everyday people who have been swindled, tricked, cheated, and lied to by corrupt corporations, foundations, and government officials, I only wish a group of people like this existed in real life. LEVERAGE should be placed back on television, until then I will watch the episodes on my DVD set, by the way my favorite episode is SNOW JOB.",1422489600,20,952,4.913043478260869
