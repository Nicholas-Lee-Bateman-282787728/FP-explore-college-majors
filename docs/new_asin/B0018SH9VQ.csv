3420804,5,B0018SH9VQ,"I highly reccomend this DVD. Liz Chandler is an inspiring teacher and the workout is extremely effective. She talks very clearly in a friendly manner and explains everything so you understand why you are doing it. Firstly she explains the principles behind Pilates then she goes on to lead you gently through a series of standing and mat exercises.

Although the DVD is aimed at over 50's it works equally well as an introduction for anyone. The clients she uses are older people and actual clients of hers rather than models and at the end there is a section where they are each interviewed and they give their thoughts on their physical background, how they got into Pilates and how it has benefited them.",1212710400,38,707,4.701612903225806
3420805,4,B0018SH9VQ,"This instructional CD is perfect for beginners like me. It is also gentle on your body, particularly if you have back issues.
I use it several times a week.",1393718400,,156,4.413793103448276
3420806,5,B0018SH9VQ,Very good video.  Too slow paced for me and I am 70.  I enjoyed doing it.  It works if you can memorize the positions you don't have to listen to the dialogue over and over again..,1385510400,,180,3.9444444444444446
3420807,3,B0018SH9VQ,"The DVD didn't have enough pilates!
I do pilates, I need something kinda in the
middle, of what this DVD is.",1383091200,,108,4.190476190476191
3420808,3,B0018SH9VQ,"I think it presents a very safe routine but even with my age and arthritis problems, it was a bit too slow and cautious.",1375747200,8,120,4.041666666666667
3420809,5,B0018SH9VQ,"my grandmother, who is 56, needed something to keep her active and energized, without being too worn out for the remainder of the day, so I got her this. She really seems to enjoy it, and has been using it a few times a week.",1371340800,5,225,4.022222222222222
3420810,4,B0018SH9VQ,Really easy moves.  It's pretty short. All lying and standing still exercises. Mostly it;s about breathing correctly and neutral spine positions. It's great for someone in need of e recovery program.,1371081600,6,199,5.419354838709677
3420811,2,B0018SH9VQ,"This is not a bad video, but it is not really directed at the over fifties. I'm 55 and really not that fit but I found this too easy and somewhat boring.  The participants are all in their sixties or seventies and the content is more appropriate for them I suspect, and even then some fit sixty pluses might not find it enough of a challenge.
Not much content either.
Have also bought Pilates for Inflexible People which is much more satisfying and will keep me on my toes for a while!",1335139200,15,485,4.271739130434782
3420812,5,B0018SH9VQ,Really good for those of us recovering from a surgery that prohibits us from doing a more aerobic type exercise.,1274572800,12,112,4.65
3420813,1,B0018SH9VQ,"I was expecting a lot more from this video than i got.  I would think anyone age 80 could do the simplistic routines taught here.  This DVD was instructional but very basic.  If you have done any Pilates, it is not for you.",1240185600,10,223,4.1395348837209305
3420814,5,B0018SH9VQ,"An excellent DVD which has helped me with back pain and created an awareness of the importance of deep breathing and maintaining correct posture. Liz provides a understandable explanation of the basics of Pilates. In addition, there is an excellent selection of floor and vertical exercises to observe and then follow.  In following the clear and concise instructions that Liz gives for these exercises, I am more confident I am doing them correctly.

Watching Janet, Syliva & Derek, people in my age range, doing the exercise with such ease is very encouraging.  I also found the interviews to be reassuring and enjoyable.

I have strengthen my core muscles which in turn helps the back pain and maintaining correct posture. The practice of deep breathing is helpful with pain, stress and provides an overall feeling of wellness.  In addition to doing regular work sessions, doing deep breathing with a few exercises will alliviate pain experienced after sitting or standing for an extended time.  Pilates & deep breathing has changed my life and I look forward to a sequel.  Try it!",1229904000,14,1084,5.022346368715084
8270921,1,B0018SH9VQ,"This video started out great, but only a few minutes in it went back to the beginning and started over.  I tried to fast forward, but still got the same results.",1517443200,,161,4.193548387096774

8270923,2,B0018SH9VQ,"Waaayyy too basic. People in their 50s, 60s, and most even in their 70s are able to perform more advanced motions. I need a pilates a bit more relaxed than the usual ones for people in their 20s, but this one was way too far the other way.",1491436800,,239,4.0
