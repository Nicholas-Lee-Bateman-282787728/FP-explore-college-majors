8148762,5,B000J2FPZE,"What happened here is some old Native American and American Indian 16mm films that have been collected onto DVD.
A mixture of films made for public viewing and others that were made by tourists, you have a wonderful view into history. First is the The Pueblo Heritage, 1950, where we learn about Indian jewelry, pottery, weavings and other crafts being produced.  No doubt trying to get us to buy stuff when we visit the Indians. There is Navajo Canyon Country, 1954, ""glorious footage"" of New Mexico and Arizona, including daily life of the Native Americans.  Than we have the OLD West, Cowboys and Indians, 1920's, which seems to be amateur film shot sometime around the 1920s or 1930s that shows the Native American culture in the Southwest USA. It feels like a mixture of art and public relations.  Enjoy!",1323388800,,809,4.805755395683454
