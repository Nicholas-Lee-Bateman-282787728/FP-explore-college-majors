2168756,5,B00065EB04,"We have several of these Baby Genius CD's. She really likes them, they are fun gigles; she tries to sing along and has learned many common nursery rhymes.",1356652800,,154,4.535714285714286
2168757,1,B00065EB04,"What world does the writer of this childrens video live in?  This video lacks each and every minority child known.  There is nothing but, white children throughout!  I can't believe a person would make a film that doesn't represent atleast a couple of minorities in it.  However, almost every animal is featured.  I would never purchase anymore of these dvds.  Something that doesn't view God's world in it - doesn't belong in my home and isn't worth my dollar.",1346630400,,461,4.772151898734177
2168758,5,B00065EB04,"My 16 month old son loves this DVD and CD.  I play the CD while he is in the playroom, just quietly playing in the background and he likes hearing it.  By the way, the DVD/CD can be very useful for a sleepy child to lull them to sleep.  For the price, this is a great deal!  Very nice music set!",1345593600,,295,3.7868852459016393
2168759,4,B00065EB04,"Ordered this as it was a good deal and my babies love the Baby Genius favorite nursery rhymes dvd that we have. But this somehow did not impress them. I personally think it is nice and relaxing but it's not made for me, the adult,so it defeats the purpose. May be I will give it another try at some point in the future but for now, we will stick to the Baby Genius Nursery Rhymes DVD.

Update:

I am reviewing this again after several months and my twins have begun to enjoy this dvd. They are 2 yrs old now and the music calms them after a long day. The visuals are also more in keeping with their knowledge of the surroundings and what they see in books etc. So all in all we are happy with this DVD.",1321315200,3,702,4.043165467625899
2168760,4,B00065EB04,If you are looking for something a little quieter for bedtime or naptime this is a great choice. The music and images are very calming and it has become part of my daughter's daily routine after lunch. Within a few minutes she's snuggled up to her stuffed animal on the floor and snoozing. I can't say it has any actual educational value but for chilling a bay out it is excellent!,1252713600,4,381,4.380281690140845
2168761,2,B00065EB04,"unlike the ""Children's Favorite Songs"" one, which my bb loves, this one bores her...picture and animation are not as good as CFS...a disappointment...",1247270400,,150,5.565217391304348
2168762,5,B00065EB04,"we love these videos. so cute, fun and educational. keeps my kids attention for the whole video.",1203724800,,96,4.705882352941177
2168763,3,B00065EB04,"This one is ok but it seems to not be able to keep their attention for long, I much prefer the interactive Baby Genius videos that the kids are all involved with singing and dancing, like Childrens Favorite Songs, and Childrens Favorite Nursery Rhymes.",1172361600,2,252,4.75
2168764,2,B00065EB04,"I was disappointed in this DVD.  I really didn't want to compare it to the Baby Einstein Baby Mozart DVD, but it's impossible not to.  The images on this Baby Genius DVD stay on the screen for longer periods of time and they tend to be more pastel rather than primary.  Also, on the Genius DVD, there are images of animals (a brown squirrel running around on brown grass - which makes no sense to me since babies are stimulated by bright colors) and children who really aren't doing anything that entertaining or interesting.  I really prefer the Baby Einstein Baby Mozart DVD because the images are brighter, they rotate in shorter periods of time (keeping my son's interest piqued), and the hand puppets and toys shown are just generally better and more interesting than the Baby Genius DVD.  If you're looking to get a DVD and can't decide between Baby Genius and Baby Einstein, go with the Einstein.",1103760000,9,903,4.654088050314465

8038861,1,B00065EB04,This title used to be on Netflix instant streaming but then it was removed. My daughter loved it so I wanted to buy it for her.  This DVD from Amazon is NOT the same even though it is the same title. It would have been fine except this DVD is just awful. It was so boring and looked thrown together. I don't think all the music is Mozart either.,1435017600,,345,4.0
8038862,5,B00065EB04,Great,1431302400,,5,5.0
8038863,3,B00065EB04,FYI: This is not the same as the Baby Genius Mozart and Friends that was on N*tflix. They removed it from there and our son loves it! So I ordered this on Amazon and it is not the same!! -Crying baby and crying mom,1428019200,,214,3.8863636363636362
8038864,5,B00065EB04,"Of all the ""smart baby"" shows out there, our kiddo loves this the best.  The music is classical throughout, with a couple of times where a goofy note dude is counting numbers and doing ABCs.

While it's not a babysitter, he calms down every time we play this.  I give it five stars for us.  I'm sure other babies have other shows/activities as their favorite.",1427932800,,359,4.476923076923077
8038865,5,B00065EB04,my kid loves this movie - only thing he will watch from age 4mo. to 11 mo.,1424217600,,74,3.411764705882353

The classical music is a great break from the other DVDs. Also great for nap time!",1406505600,,109,4.5
8038868,1,B00065EB04,"Terrible. Who are they kidding when they say its for 0-48 months? I bought this for my 2 year old thinking that it would work since it would be appropriate for a child twice are age. Wrong. My daughter won't sit through this for more than a couple seconds. The cast of characters make minimum appearance. The graphics made with a cell phone from a decade ago. And the animation is reminiscent of a 1990's computer screensaver. There is no dialogue or interaction at all. Shapes, numbers and numbers are shown on the screen without any prompting or explanation as to what it is. To a child who does not know the names of shapes, colors, letters, or numbers, it is pretty much useless. I guess we have a new beverage coaster or mini frisbee.",1375315200,,739,4.481481481481482
8038869,1,B00065EB04,Not worth the money. Very boring video. My son doesnt seem to be entertained by it. He prefers the sing a long videos.,1367280000,,118,4.173913043478261
