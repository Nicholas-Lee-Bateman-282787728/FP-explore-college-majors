3113364,5,B0013K2ZDQ,"Rev. Billy and his traveling gospel choir from the Church of Stop Shopping bring up a lot of questions which they cannot necessarily answer, but the point is to allow us to ponder those questions and decide how we might change our ways.

With his loud, outrageous and daring antics, Billy invades Disney store, Starbucks, Disneyland and various American cities and malls as he crusades for an end to the shopping frenzies and consumerism that have taken over the lives of too many Americans--especially during the Christmas season.  It's not possible to know how many people he has influenced or if they are really thinking about what he's saying, but perhaps he will simply need to do this every year until more people start listening.

The questions are:  why do we think we must shop till we drop for Christmas?  Why do we go into debt this way?  What makes us think our kids will love us only if we bombard them with toys and the latest electronics?  Who really believes that if we don't shop and spend, the terrorists will win?  Why do we buy products that we know were made in third world sweatshops by kids?  Why are we so obsessed with brand names and designer labels?

And what would Jesus buy?  I don't think he would buy anything.  He would give of himself, sacrifice, spend time with others, and not be concerned at all with any selfish desires.

This is worth a viewing and some pondering.",1213747200,7,1402,4.582329317269076
3113365,5,B0013K2ZDQ,"""X-box 360.""
""Definitely X-box 360.""
""A Wii, or an X-box 360 if the store's out of Wii's.""
""Probably not much. I don't think he would buy shoes, but it's pretty cold outside right now, so he might buy a pair of socks.""

These answers provide a pretty good representation of our society's attitude toward Christmas, and, in a very real sense, toward our role as consumers in general. An attitude that some people might say is unhealthy: specifically, the people attending the worship service/show of a New York City based church/performance group.

Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping Gospel Choir hold a weekly service, and witness in the streets of Manhattan singing, proclaiming, and acting out their message: ""Slow down your consumption, America!"" But they do more than just nit-pick at passing shoppers; these people can put on quite a show. Combining the language of anti-consumerism with that of evangelic preaching (i.e. ""Shopocalypse"") Reverend Billy goes about warning shoppers of the danger at hand and exorcising the credit cards of those will listen.

As fun as it is to watch the antics and musical abilities of Reverend Billy and his Choir, what sustains our interest is the well-timed documentary moments interviewing teenagers about their shopping habits and informing us about the real needs felt by those who work in third-world factories to make many of the products we buy. Particularly moving to me was the comment of an elderly lady remembering how special Christmas used to feel and how much it meant when her father would supply enough peaches for everyone for the family's Christmas dinner. Now Christmas is primarily an excuse for everyone to feel good about their dependence to acquiring and giving out a bunch of 'things' that no one has a real need for.

The message of ending our addiction to constant stimulation is one our society can truly benefit from. Corporate interests drive our country's decision making in everything from politics to elementary education (who do you think is behind all the standardized tests?). Consumerism distracts us from being the creative individuals that, as Reverend Billy so wonderfully reminds us, we are meant to be.",1212969600,,2195,5.07202216066482
3113366,5,B0013K2ZDQ,"Last Fall, when this movie was in the theaters, I asked my 18-year-old daughter to join me, as a special favor. She went to please her mother, not because she really thought it would be good. After all, it had ""Jesus"" in the title, and my Sunday-school-raised child had long since decided that church and Jesus wasn't really for her. Well, she (and I) laughed heartily at this movie, many times, as it also seriously convicted us, challenged us to evaluate our spending. My daughter is now looking forward to sharing this film with friends. She wants to have friends over to the house to view it. It's been 6 months since we watched it, and thoughts of seeing it again brings forth laughter and reminders to be aware of our spending habits, our wants and our perceived ""needs."" This film touches on all ages -- children, teens and adults, challenging everyone to take a serious look at their motivations.

3113367,3,B0013K2ZDQ,"Produced by Morgan ""Super Size Me"" Spurlock (who I like to refer to as ""Michael Moore Lite"") and directed by Rob VanAlkemade, this film documents the public antics of improv performer/anti-consumerism activist Bill Talen, better-known as his alter-ego, Reverend Billy, the ""spiritual"" leader of the ""Church of Stop Shopping"".

Talen honed his act in San Francisco, originally creating the Reverend Billy as a sketch character, who dresses like a flashy, big-haired TV evangelist and performs with the fearless, in-your-face conviction of a sidewalk preacher. The Reverend doesn't preach the traditional gospel, however. His ""mission"" is to rail against the evils of the corporate retail giants. Talen calls attention to corporate sanctioned sweat shops, abused and underpaid store employees, and the cradle-to-grave brainwashing of American consumers by the advertising media-to anyone who will listen. His favorite targets include Disney (Rev. Billy considers Mickey Mouse ""the Antichrist""), Starbucks and Wal-Mart.

Back in 2005, Talen and his troupe of musicians and ""choir"" members left their New York City home base to embark on a nationwide bus tour to spread the good word: ""Stop shopping!"" VanAlkemade and his film crew tagged along, as the Reverend and his troupe executed their blend of street theatre and social activism. The traveling church members stake out malls and retail chain stores, treating unsuspecting shoppers to impromptu sermons and Weird Al-style rewordings of well-known hymns and Christmas carols. They also rent local public halls for ""revivals"".

As the group treks across the fruited plains, they make stops at the likes of the behemoth Mall of America. We watch the performers repeat the same drill several times: Billy, armed with a megaphone and backed by his choir, plants himself in center court and proceeds to call for an immediate cessation to mindless spending. Groups of shoppers eventually begin to gather, some ""getting"" it, but most registering a ""WTF?"" expression. Next comes the arrival of the beer-gutted, walkie-talkie wielding mall security personnel, who unceremoniously escort the group from the premises.

The final whistle stop is Anaheim, where the reverend and his flock descend on Disneyland. Just before he is (inevitably) escorted out by the Disney brown shirts (seriously-they are disturbingly fascistic in dress and demeanor), Billy delivers the best line in the film through his megaphone: ""People! Main Street, U.S.A. is made in China!""

Mission accomplished? Hardly, but you do find yourself admiring Talen's conviction and dedication to his activist principles, despite the fact that his message is apparently falling on deaf ears. As I watched the film, I realized that Talen is the heir apparent to the tradition of guerilla theatre, as practiced by the likes of the San Francisco Mime Troupe and the Diggers back in the 1960s, with a pinch of Abbie Hoffman.

This film may not necessarily teach us anything new; the ""Stop the presses! Christmas is crassly commercial!"" revelation is at least as hoary as ""Miracle on 34th Street"" or ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"". Also, there have already been several documentaries produced that do a better job covering the ""corporate exploitation of workers"" issues (""Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price"" and ""The Big One"" come to mind); but this is still an entertaining documentary with a worthwhile message.",1208736000,8,3412,5.380149812734082
3113368,5,B0013K2ZDQ,"I was able to see this film already and it is a hilarious yet serious take on overconsumption in America.  Reverend Billy and his choir stop at shopping malls across the country from New York to California to sing songs and confront consumerism with a feel reminiscent to the Borat movie.  It's a quasi-documentary and should be viewed by everyone in this country.  There are only a few interviews with experts on consumerism but this movie is a good starting point for further research on consumerism.  It is light enough to be enjoyed by children yet enlightening for adults as well.  Hopefull the DVD will feature heavier bonus content that adds to the issue at hand.

3113371,4,B0013K2ZDQ,"The Reverend Billy is clearly a man on a mission: namely, to convince American consumers to tear up their credit cards and stop shopping.  Since the Bible tells us that the love of money is the root of all evil, the right good reverend has taken it upon himself to preach the gospel of No Shopping to a world drowning in a sea of Madison Avenue marketing and debt.  His congregation even calls itself the Church of Stop Shopping, and every Christmas season, his devoted flock fans out to local malls and shopping centers to preach against the evils of consumerism and to lead exhausted and beleaguered shoppers to redemption.

Rob VanAlkemade's ""What Would Jesus Buy?"" is a lively and colorful documentary that follows the CCS and its leader as they travel around the country spreading the word to the masses.  In the prologue, we're informed that, whereas America ""used to be a nation of producers, now we're a nation of consumers.""  Our savings rate stands at zero, as we groan under mounds of ever-increasing personal debt.  Psychologists, in fact, estimate that 15 million Americans may be ""clinically addicted"" to shopping, and we're told that the nation's citizens spend five times more time shopping in stores (and now on the internet) than praying in church.

This is the situation that Reverend Billy is hell-bent on rectifying.  Part religious zealot and part crowd-pleasing showman, Revered Billy is in the time-honored tradition of all those big-haired, fire-and-brimstone preachers who stand on street corners or in the pulpits of churches thunderously decrying the evils of the world and offering personal salvation - only, in his case, it's salvation from the demonic forces of wanton spending.  Combining a social message with street-theater and performance art antics like singing anti-commercial Christmas carols to bemused and befuddled audiences, Reverend Billy and his minions have been arrested numerous times for invading retail stores in an attempt to bring a halt to the commerce taking place within them.  At one point, they even mount an assault on the nation's ultimate shoppers' Mecca, the Mall of America, where countless pilgrims go every year to bow down and worship the almighty god of consumerism.  But Reverend Billy saves his greatest opprobrium for the Walt Disney Corporation, which he sees as a false god - even going so far as refer to Mickey Mouse as his own personal antichrist - dedicated to making money at any cost, including exploiting underpaid workers in Third World countries.  The movie also slams what has come to be known as the ""Walmart-ization"" of America, as more and more mom-and-pop retailers are driven out of business by massive corporations whose sole concern is the bottom line and, thus, have no qualms about shipping many of their jobs overseas.

This affectionate, humor-filled movie makes us complicit in the group's actions, which means we also get to be present for those rare moments of quiet reflection when the participants question just how many people they are actually converting to their creed.  But far more often, we see how nothing - not overzealous security forces, not unresponsive crowd, not even a serious bus accident (at which we are present) - can dampen their commitment to their cause.

Of course, the movie, in its passion and zeal for Reverend Billy and what he is advocating, neglects to address the rather obvious counterargument that if people were to stop shopping entirely - especially at Christmas - the economy might come to a screeching halt, resulting in far-reaching harmful consequences for the nation as a whole.

Still, it's hard not to buy at least some of what ""What Would Jesus Buy?"" is selling.",1288828800,2,3699,5.029459901800327

I've done little shopping for Christmas over the past few years and quit wrapping things. This year I've ordered a set of ""Found Magazine"" and plan to have adult children choose one of them.  Got a few books from Costco for my 3 year old grandchild and that's it for this year. I try to buy what's made here, shop locally so money stays in my community but it's getting more and more difficult to do that.  All corporations care about is enriching the folks at the top and nothing else.  They should be held to a much higher standard when they try to get chartered.  They should be incentivized to keep jobs here through tax policy.  There are ways to force them to be better citizens and people should refuse to support them.",1260835200,,1052,4.654054054054054
3113374,4,B0013K2ZDQ,"What Would Jesus Buy? is a funny film about the impact of materialism on Christmas and on U.S. society in general. The film follows Reverend Billy and his followers as they cross the U.S. and engage in performance art as a way of bringing attention to the ""Shopocalypse.""

WWJB? is very funny. My wife and I laughed out loud many times. Reverend Billy and his followers have the moxie to stage ""guerilla"" raids on American's biggest corporations. Two of the best scenes, in my opinion, were uninvited appearances at The Mall of America and Disneyland's Main Street. During the performances, the looks on the faces of the patrons are priceless.

The only negative in this film is when the filmmakers strayed a bit too far from their main topic and  discuss at length the labor practices of large corporations. While this is an important issue, I suspect that most viewers will think that they cannot change the world economy; viewers can, on the other hand, change the way that their families celebrate the holidays.

What Would Jesus Buy? is a funny, thought-provoking look at America's out-of-control spending for Christmas. I highly recommend it.",1260576000,,1148,4.932642487046632

3113376,5,B0013K2ZDQ,"You don't have to be a Marxist to see something wrong with the degree to which we have embraced consumerism. As they note early in this superb documentary, even Christians today focus more on shopping than they do on religious activities. If you go onto the parking lot of a megachurch, you will be blown away by the number of expensive automobiles and astonished by the jewelry worn by the men and women inside. Even Christians, who follow the One who said to the Rich Young Man that if he was going to follow Him he needed to give away all that he had. I honestly don't have a problem with people buying stuff. I think we buy stuff that we don't need and that we haven't given much thought about. And we have fetishized the buying of things to such a degree that in America those who don't buy are considered weird.

This documentary focuses on the Reverend Billy and his Church of Stop Shopping Gospel Choir's attempt to protect Christmas from the Shopocalypse. Reverend Billy frankly comes across as something of a charlatan. He is more an entertainer than spiritual leader and the whole affair comes across more like performance art than anything. I think it is really important because the film helps raise consciousness of the dangers of focusing our lives on spending. Reverend Billy is an actor, like when he is filling up the church's bus with diesel fuel and he starts shouting that he feels like Jimmy Swaggart was caught with a prostitute. This quickly gave way to shock when their bus was hit by an 18-wheeler, causing 13 people to be taken to the hospital and threatening their tour.

Personally, I have tried to opt out of the entire system. I must be among the few Americans anywhere who has refused to get a credit card. I'm terrified of running up debt. I do not buy cards for any holidays. I don't buy Christmas cards, Valentine cards, birthday cards, or anything else. I buy Christmas presents for my daughter, but that is it. To the greatest extent possible, I'm tried to be less and less of a consumer. I do buy books and DVDs, but i don't think I have many physical items that I don't really need. I do think that we would be better as a society if we focused our spending on things that we truly need.

Whether or not you agree with their message of anti-consumerism -- and even Christians, who have become increasingly focused on buying things (there are some mega churches with fast food chains inside and the larger churches even give generous clothing allowances to their ministers, who are expected to dress in the finest possible style), should agree with a message of decreasing the amoung of consumerism -- this is a hugely enjoyable film. Rarely has any film been both so moralistic and funny at the same time.

3113378,5,B0013K2ZDQ,"What Would Jesus Buy? is an outstanding documentary of the very creative--and confrontational--tactics of ""Reverend"" Billy (Bill Talen). He organizes a gospel-style singing choir called the Church of Stop Shopping; and they perform songs and go on a major cross country bus tour to challenge people to re-think their attitudes about shopping in general--and especially to reevaluate the value of frenzied holiday shopping which pushes aside the real meaning of Christmas. The documentary flows at a very good pace; and I was never bored--their story is remarkable, true and rather dramatic. The cinematography is very professional and I felt that I was with them and knew what their experiences were like as I watched this DVD.

For the better part of the film the focus is on two subjects. To a lesser degree, we meet several people who have spent so much that one of them can max out a new credit card in just one day and not show very real concern about it; and we meet a woman who has incredible amounts of clothing--for her Chihuahua. There are teens confessing that they'll be ostracized in school if they don't wear the latest fashion trends; and one woman uses Reverend Billy's mobile ""confessional"" booth to tell him how she had to destroy an article of clothing in a store dressing room because once she tried so hard to fit into it she couldn't get it off! She goes on to say that she couldn't go back into the store--where she shopped every day--unless she hid the fact that she couldn't fit into a dress, and having to destroy the dress just to remove it wasn't too much fun for her, either.

However, the principle focus of the film is the group's one month cross country journey to go into shopping malls and ring people's doorbells to alert them to the ""Shopocalypse."" For Reverend Billy and his followers the ""Shopocalypse"" comes when there's so much spending just before Christmastime that the rate of spending is irresponsible and threatens to destroy the true meaning of Christmas. Reverend Billy and the chorus hit the road in a rather old bus; and it is indeed ironic that the one road accident that befalls them happens when a truck rushing to get Christmas merchandise to stores rams into the back of their bus. Fortunately, no one gets hurt too badly and after a day or two they go on their way.

But the culmination of the one month tour (which ends on Christmas Day in Disneyland) may have some consequences. In fact, just making it to their destination may have some problems for them. While they get some calm conversation time with a local merchant whose business has been ruined by Walmart, the group's appearances at several Walmart stores, a number of Starbucks franchises and The Mall of America are not exactly welcome. No spoilers here--watch and find out what happens!

The DVD comes with some nice extras. We see footage of their ""send-off"" concert in Saint Mark's Church in Manhattan; there's a public access revival television spot made by Reverend Billy; and we learn the pitiful story of how China jailed a young woman for two years--all for the crime of being Christian. I also like the footage from their stop at a post office in Pennsylvania, too.

What Would Jesus Buy may have been produced, shown in theaters and put on DVD before this huge recession started and spending did slow down, but the concept of getting people to shop less and be more fiscally responsible is timeless. For example, younger people on college campuses are easily lured into credit cards with high interest rates if they don't pay their bills in full right away; many of these people don't understand the real responsibilities of having a credit card--it creates a bill that you DO have to pay. In addition, I strongly agree with Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping that people have become so enamored with shopping that the true meaning of Christmas is in very real danger of being forgotten. I highly recommend this film.",1246665600,2,3957,4.754002911208151
3113379,4,B0013K2ZDQ,"This movie is about a very serious and important subject and it treats the subject seriously at times and in what I consider a silly way at others. At the beginning of the movie I almost decided to give up on it - this was not hilarious to me. I'm glad I didn't! I did smile a couple of times later on (e.g. at their version of two Christmas carols), but I did not laugh as I had expected to do when I read that it was ""hilarious"". What I didn't expect, was to be so moved! I did cry at two points - once during the movie and once while watching the bonus material about the ten commandments, made in China.

Obviously, what I consider silly, many people consider funny. Also, I am the sensitive type and many people may not feel sad or moved. What I do hope is that this movie makes people think about the results of our  over-consumerism - the exploitation by large companies of workers in developing countries and the negative effects on the quality of our lives when we lose sight of what gives us real satisfaction (hint: it's not the next name-brand piece of clothing we find, when our closet is already over-flowing).

I do recommend the movie, though most of its humor is not my cup of tea. It did something more important than make me laugh, it made me re-think the way I live.",1245888000,,1286,4.262295081967213

The director finds a way to engage everyone, which is ESSENTIAL to any movement away from consumer culture. (Accessibility seems to be Spurlock's signature as a producer.) At the same time, ""What Would Jesus Buy"" asks questions engaging enough for any mental ruminator. I am considering whether to show this in my university class.

Billy is funny and the theatrics are entertaining, but the vignettes of Third World sweat shops similar to those used by Walmart and Disney Corporation made it hard to enjoy. It makes you stop and think.

For years we have been shown starving children on late night TV and have been asked to contribute pennies a day to feed them. Unfortunately we never addressed their governments failure to take care of their own. I guess they didn't have weapons of mass destruction...other than hunger..so why bother?? Our American corporations, on the other hand, appear to have taken careful notes on these countries. They saw $$$ on swollen bellies and drawn faces, an untapped labor market in a country that had few expectations of them. These once hungry children aren't much better off today. Yes they eat, but they still have no health care and work 16 hours days for pennies. Their work was once our work. They have taken manufacturing jobs that once fed American families. Those same families, many now struggling, go to Walmart and other discount houses to purchase the things they once made.

I liked this movie, though.

It offers a humorous and yet terrifying perspective on American consumerism, especially as it relates to Christmas.  The hollowness of materialism rings like a gong throughout the film, as it follows ""Reverend Billy"" and his Stop Shop[ping crew around the country.  (The cost to send the troupe around the USA was not cheap, and someone laid out lots of dough for this.)

The movie does meander a bit in anti Wal*Mart and anti-Disney diatribes in particular.

""What Would Jesus Buy?"" (WWJB) is a rhetorical question to spur us to reconsider the true meaning of Christmas and - beyond that - the sickness of materialism that grips our lives.

It is easier to tell what the movie and Rev. Billy are against than what they are for.  Is Rev. Billy really a Christian?  Aside from closeness with family, what is the true meaning of Christmas?  Does he find it in Gospels?  Does it involve mission, outreach or evangelizing?  We are left to wonder.

WWJB is better at excoriating materialism but it isn't clear - at least to this reviewer - as to its true spiritual leanings, roots and beliefs.

Withal, though, WWJB is at once a funny and horrifying expose oo the gripping and sickening role of shopaholism during the yuletide season, with broader troubling implications on our modern spiritual wasteland.",1217635200,2,1489,4.830039525691699

You can imagine the sacred shrines they visit on this anti-pilgrimage, including the Mall of America, the headquarters of Wal-Mart, the Las Vegas strip, and the ultimate virtual reality on Christmas Day -- Disneyland, home of the antichrist, Mickey Mouse. The film interviews shopoholics and cultural critics alike (Jim Wallis, Bill McKibben, Andrew Young).

3347861,5,B0013K2ZDQ,"Rev. Billy and his traveling gospel choir from the Church of Stop Shopping bring up a lot of questions which they cannot necessarily answer, but the point is to allow us to ponder those questions and decide how we might change our ways.

With his loud, outrageous and daring antics, Billy invades Disney store, Starbucks, Disneyland and various American cities and malls as he crusades for an end to the shopping frenzies and consumerism that have taken over the lives of too many Americans--especially during the Christmas season.  It's not possible to know how many people he has influenced or if they are really thinking about what he's saying, but perhaps he will simply need to do this every year until more people start listening.

The questions are:  why do we think we must shop till we drop for Christmas?  Why do we go into debt this way?  What makes us think our kids will love us only if we bombard them with toys and the latest electronics?  Who really believes that if we don't shop and spend, the terrorists will win?  Why do we buy products that we know were made in third world sweatshops by kids?  Why are we so obsessed with brand names and designer labels?

And what would Jesus buy?  I don't think he would buy anything.  He would give of himself, sacrifice, spend time with others, and not be concerned at all with any selfish desires.

This is worth a viewing and some pondering.",1213747200,7,1402,4.582329317269076

""Definitely X-box 360.""
""A Wii, or an X-box 360 if the store's out of Wii's.""
""Probably not much. I don't think he would buy shoes, but it's pretty cold outside right now, so he might buy a pair of socks.""

These answers provide a pretty good representation of our society's attitude toward Christmas, and, in a very real sense, toward our role as consumers in general. An attitude that some people might say is unhealthy: specifically, the people attending the worship service/show of a New York City based church/performance group.

Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping Gospel Choir hold a weekly service, and witness in the streets of Manhattan singing, proclaiming, and acting out their message: ""Slow down your consumption, America!"" But they do more than just nit-pick at passing shoppers; these people can put on quite a show. Combining the language of anti-consumerism with that of evangelic preaching (i.e. ""Shopocalypse"") Reverend Billy goes about warning shoppers of the danger at hand and exorcising the credit cards of those will listen.

As fun as it is to watch the antics and musical abilities of Reverend Billy and his Choir, what sustains our interest is the well-timed documentary moments interviewing teenagers about their shopping habits and informing us about the real needs felt by those who work in third-world factories to make many of the products we buy. Particularly moving to me was the comment of an elderly lady remembering how special Christmas used to feel and how much it meant when her father would supply enough peaches for everyone for the family's Christmas dinner. Now Christmas is primarily an excuse for everyone to feel good about their dependence to acquiring and giving out a bunch of 'things' that no one has a real need for.

The message of ending our addiction to constant stimulation is one our society can truly benefit from. Corporate interests drive our country's decision making in everything from politics to elementary education (who do you think is behind all the standardized tests?). Consumerism distracts us from being the creative individuals that, as Reverend Billy so wonderfully reminds us, we are meant to be.",1212969600,,2195,5.07202216066482

3347864,3,B0013K2ZDQ,"Produced by Morgan ""Super Size Me"" Spurlock (who I like to refer to as ""Michael Moore Lite"") and directed by Rob VanAlkemade, this film documents the public antics of improv performer/anti-consumerism activist Bill Talen, better-known as his alter-ego, Reverend Billy, the ""spiritual"" leader of the ""Church of Stop Shopping"".

Talen honed his act in San Francisco, originally creating the Reverend Billy as a sketch character, who dresses like a flashy, big-haired TV evangelist and performs with the fearless, in-your-face conviction of a sidewalk preacher. The Reverend doesn't preach the traditional gospel, however. His ""mission"" is to rail against the evils of the corporate retail giants. Talen calls attention to corporate sanctioned sweat shops, abused and underpaid store employees, and the cradle-to-grave brainwashing of American consumers by the advertising media-to anyone who will listen. His favorite targets include Disney (Rev. Billy considers Mickey Mouse ""the Antichrist""), Starbucks and Wal-Mart.

Back in 2005, Talen and his troupe of musicians and ""choir"" members left their New York City home base to embark on a nationwide bus tour to spread the good word: ""Stop shopping!"" VanAlkemade and his film crew tagged along, as the Reverend and his troupe executed their blend of street theatre and social activism. The traveling church members stake out malls and retail chain stores, treating unsuspecting shoppers to impromptu sermons and Weird Al-style rewordings of well-known hymns and Christmas carols. They also rent local public halls for ""revivals"".

As the group treks across the fruited plains, they make stops at the likes of the behemoth Mall of America. We watch the performers repeat the same drill several times: Billy, armed with a megaphone and backed by his choir, plants himself in center court and proceeds to call for an immediate cessation to mindless spending. Groups of shoppers eventually begin to gather, some ""getting"" it, but most registering a ""WTF?"" expression. Next comes the arrival of the beer-gutted, walkie-talkie wielding mall security personnel, who unceremoniously escort the group from the premises.

The final whistle stop is Anaheim, where the reverend and his flock descend on Disneyland. Just before he is (inevitably) escorted out by the Disney brown shirts (seriously-they are disturbingly fascistic in dress and demeanor), Billy delivers the best line in the film through his megaphone: ""People! Main Street, U.S.A. is made in China!""

Mission accomplished? Hardly, but you do find yourself admiring Talen's conviction and dedication to his activist principles, despite the fact that his message is apparently falling on deaf ears. As I watched the film, I realized that Talen is the heir apparent to the tradition of guerilla theatre, as practiced by the likes of the San Francisco Mime Troupe and the Diggers back in the 1960s, with a pinch of Abbie Hoffman.

This film may not necessarily teach us anything new; the ""Stop the presses! Christmas is crassly commercial!"" revelation is at least as hoary as ""Miracle on 34th Street"" or ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"". Also, there have already been several documentaries produced that do a better job covering the ""corporate exploitation of workers"" issues (""Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price"" and ""The Big One"" come to mind); but this is still an entertaining documentary with a worthwhile message.",1208736000,8,3412,5.380149812734082

3347868,4,B0013K2ZDQ,"The Reverend Billy is clearly a man on a mission: namely, to convince American consumers to tear up their credit cards and stop shopping.  Since the Bible tells us that the love of money is the root of all evil, the right good reverend has taken it upon himself to preach the gospel of No Shopping to a world drowning in a sea of Madison Avenue marketing and debt.  His congregation even calls itself the Church of Stop Shopping, and every Christmas season, his devoted flock fans out to local malls and shopping centers to preach against the evils of consumerism and to lead exhausted and beleaguered shoppers to redemption.

Rob VanAlkemade's ""What Would Jesus Buy?"" is a lively and colorful documentary that follows the CCS and its leader as they travel around the country spreading the word to the masses.  In the prologue, we're informed that, whereas America ""used to be a nation of producers, now we're a nation of consumers.""  Our savings rate stands at zero, as we groan under mounds of ever-increasing personal debt.  Psychologists, in fact, estimate that 15 million Americans may be ""clinically addicted"" to shopping, and we're told that the nation's citizens spend five times more time shopping in stores (and now on the internet) than praying in church.

This is the situation that Reverend Billy is hell-bent on rectifying.  Part religious zealot and part crowd-pleasing showman, Revered Billy is in the time-honored tradition of all those big-haired, fire-and-brimstone preachers who stand on street corners or in the pulpits of churches thunderously decrying the evils of the world and offering personal salvation - only, in his case, it's salvation from the demonic forces of wanton spending.  Combining a social message with street-theater and performance art antics like singing anti-commercial Christmas carols to bemused and befuddled audiences, Reverend Billy and his minions have been arrested numerous times for invading retail stores in an attempt to bring a halt to the commerce taking place within them.  At one point, they even mount an assault on the nation's ultimate shoppers' Mecca, the Mall of America, where countless pilgrims go every year to bow down and worship the almighty god of consumerism.  But Reverend Billy saves his greatest opprobrium for the Walt Disney Corporation, which he sees as a false god - even going so far as refer to Mickey Mouse as his own personal antichrist - dedicated to making money at any cost, including exploiting underpaid workers in Third World countries.  The movie also slams what has come to be known as the ""Walmart-ization"" of America, as more and more mom-and-pop retailers are driven out of business by massive corporations whose sole concern is the bottom line and, thus, have no qualms about shipping many of their jobs overseas.

This affectionate, humor-filled movie makes us complicit in the group's actions, which means we also get to be present for those rare moments of quiet reflection when the participants question just how many people they are actually converting to their creed.  But far more often, we see how nothing - not overzealous security forces, not unresponsive crowd, not even a serious bus accident (at which we are present) - can dampen their commitment to their cause.

Of course, the movie, in its passion and zeal for Reverend Billy and what he is advocating, neglects to address the rather obvious counterargument that if people were to stop shopping entirely - especially at Christmas - the economy might come to a screeching halt, resulting in far-reaching harmful consequences for the nation as a whole.

Still, it's hard not to buy at least some of what ""What Would Jesus Buy?"" is selling.",1288828800,2,3699,5.029459901800327

WWJB? is very funny. My wife and I laughed out loud many times. Reverend Billy and his followers have the moxie to stage ""guerilla"" raids on American's biggest corporations. Two of the best scenes, in my opinion, were uninvited appearances at The Mall of America and Disneyland's Main Street. During the performances, the looks on the faces of the patrons are priceless.

The only negative in this film is when the filmmakers strayed a bit too far from their main topic and  discuss at length the labor practices of large corporations. While this is an important issue, I suspect that most viewers will think that they cannot change the world economy; viewers can, on the other hand, change the way that their families celebrate the holidays.

3347873,5,B0013K2ZDQ,"You don't have to be a Marxist to see something wrong with the degree to which we have embraced consumerism. As they note early in this superb documentary, even Christians today focus more on shopping than they do on religious activities. If you go onto the parking lot of a megachurch, you will be blown away by the number of expensive automobiles and astonished by the jewelry worn by the men and women inside. Even Christians, who follow the One who said to the Rich Young Man that if he was going to follow Him he needed to give away all that he had. I honestly don't have a problem with people buying stuff. I think we buy stuff that we don't need and that we haven't given much thought about. And we have fetishized the buying of things to such a degree that in America those who don't buy are considered weird.

This documentary focuses on the Reverend Billy and his Church of Stop Shopping Gospel Choir's attempt to protect Christmas from the Shopocalypse. Reverend Billy frankly comes across as something of a charlatan. He is more an entertainer than spiritual leader and the whole affair comes across more like performance art than anything. I think it is really important because the film helps raise consciousness of the dangers of focusing our lives on spending. Reverend Billy is an actor, like when he is filling up the church's bus with diesel fuel and he starts shouting that he feels like Jimmy Swaggart was caught with a prostitute. This quickly gave way to shock when their bus was hit by an 18-wheeler, causing 13 people to be taken to the hospital and threatening their tour.

Personally, I have tried to opt out of the entire system. I must be among the few Americans anywhere who has refused to get a credit card. I'm terrified of running up debt. I do not buy cards for any holidays. I don't buy Christmas cards, Valentine cards, birthday cards, or anything else. I buy Christmas presents for my daughter, but that is it. To the greatest extent possible, I'm tried to be less and less of a consumer. I do buy books and DVDs, but i don't think I have many physical items that I don't really need. I do think that we would be better as a society if we focused our spending on things that we truly need.

Whether or not you agree with their message of anti-consumerism -- and even Christians, who have become increasingly focused on buying things (there are some mega churches with fast food chains inside and the larger churches even give generous clothing allowances to their ministers, who are expected to dress in the finest possible style), should agree with a message of decreasing the amoung of consumerism -- this is a hugely enjoyable film.

3347875,5,B0013K2ZDQ,"What Would Jesus Buy? is an outstanding documentary of the very creative--and confrontational--tactics of ""Reverend"" Billy (Bill Talen). He organizes a gospel-style singing choir called the Church of Stop Shopping; and they perform songs and go on a major cross country bus tour to challenge people to re-think their attitudes about shopping in general--and especially to reevaluate the value of frenzied holiday shopping which pushes aside the real meaning of Christmas. The documentary flows at a very good pace; and I was never bored--their story is remarkable, true and rather dramatic. The cinematography is very professional and I felt that I was with them and knew what their experiences were like as I watched this DVD.

For the better part of the film the focus is on two subjects. To a lesser degree, we meet several people who have spent so much that one of them can max out a new credit card in just one day and not show very real concern about it; and we meet a woman who has incredible amounts of clothing--for her Chihuahua. There are teens confessing that they'll be ostracized in school if they don't wear the latest fashion trends; and one woman uses Reverend Billy's mobile ""confessional"" booth to tell him how she had to destroy an article of clothing in a store dressing room because once she tried so hard to fit into it she couldn't get it off! She goes on to say that she couldn't go back into the store--where she shopped every day--unless she hid the fact that she couldn't fit into a dress, and having to destroy the dress just to remove it wasn't too much fun for her, either.

However, the principle focus of the film is the group's one month cross country journey to go into shopping malls and ring people's doorbells to alert them to the ""Shopocalypse."" For Reverend Billy and his followers the ""Shopocalypse"" comes when there's so much spending just before Christmastime that the rate of spending is irresponsible and threatens to destroy the true meaning of Christmas. Reverend Billy and the chorus hit the road in a rather old bus; and it is indeed ironic that the one road accident that befalls them happens when a truck rushing to get Christmas merchandise to stores rams into the back of their bus. Fortunately, no one gets hurt too badly and after a day or two they go on their way.

But the culmination of the one month tour (which ends on Christmas Day in Disneyland) may have some consequences. In fact, just making it to their destination may have some problems for them. While they get some calm conversation time with a local merchant whose business has been ruined by Walmart, the group's appearances at several Walmart stores, a number of Starbucks franchises and The Mall of America are not exactly welcome. No spoilers here--watch and find out what happens!

The DVD comes with some nice extras. We see footage of their ""send-off"" concert in Saint Mark's Church in Manhattan; there's a public access revival television spot made by Reverend Billy; and we learn the pitiful story of how China jailed a young woman for two years--all for the crime of being Christian. I also like the footage from their stop at a post office in Pennsylvania, too.

What Would Jesus Buy may have been produced, shown in theaters and put on DVD before this huge recession started and spending did slow down, but the concept of getting people to shop less and be more fiscally responsible is timeless. For example, younger people on college campuses are easily lured into credit cards with high interest rates if they don't pay their bills in full right away; many of these people don't understand the real responsibilities of having a credit card--it creates a bill that you DO have to pay. In addition, I strongly agree with Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping that people have become so enamored with shopping that the true meaning of Christmas is in very real danger of being forgotten. I highly recommend this film.",1246665600,2,3957,4.754002911208151
3347876,4,B0013K2ZDQ,"This movie is about a very serious and important subject and it treats the subject seriously at times and in what I consider a silly way at others. At the beginning of the movie I almost decided to give up on it - this was not hilarious to me. I'm glad I didn't! I did smile a couple of times later on (e.g. at their version of two Christmas carols), but I did not laugh as I had expected to do when I read that it was ""hilarious"". What I didn't expect, was to be so moved! I did cry at two points - once during the movie and once while watching the bonus material about the ten commandments, made in China.

Obviously, what I consider silly, many people consider funny. Also, I am the sensitive type and many people may not feel sad or moved. What I do hope is that this movie makes people think about the results of our  over-consumerism - the exploitation by large companies of workers in developing countries and the negative effects on the quality of our lives when we lose sight of what gives us real satisfaction (hint: it's not the next name-brand piece of clothing we find, when our closet is already over-flowing).

At the same time, ""What Would Jesus Buy"" asks questions engaging enough for any mental ruminator. I am considering whether to show this in my university class.

It makes you stop and think.

For years we have been shown starving children on late night TV and have been asked to contribute pennies a day to feed them. Unfortunately we never addressed their governments failure to take care of their own. I guess they didn't have weapons of mass destruction...other than hunger..so why bother?? Our American corporations, on the other hand, appear to have taken careful notes on these countries. They saw $$$ on swollen bellies and drawn faces, an untapped labor market in a country that had few expectations of them. These once hungry children aren't much better off today. Yes they eat, but they still have no health care and work 16 hours days for pennies. Their work was once our work. They have taken manufacturing jobs that once fed American families. Those same families, many now struggling, go to Walmart and other discount houses to purchase the things they once made.

I liked this movie, though.

It offers a humorous and yet terrifying perspective on American consumerism, especially as it relates to Christmas.  The hollowness of materialism rings like a gong throughout the film, as it follows ""Reverend Billy"" and his Stop Shop[ping crew around the country.  (The cost to send the troupe around the USA was not cheap, and someone laid out lots of dough for this.)

The movie does meander a bit in anti Wal*Mart and anti-Disney diatribes in particular.

""What Would Jesus Buy?"" (WWJB) is a rhetorical question to spur us to reconsider the true meaning of Christmas and - beyond that - the sickness of materialism that grips our lives.

It is easier to tell what the movie and Rev. Billy are against than what they are for.  Is Rev. Billy really a Christian?  Aside from closeness with family, what is the true meaning of Christmas?  Does he find it in Gospels?  Does it involve mission, outreach or evangelizing?  We are left to wonder.

WWJB is better at excoriating materialism but it isn't clear - at least to this reviewer - as to its true spiritual leanings, roots and beliefs.

Withal, though, WWJB is at once a funny and horrifying expose oo the gripping and sickening role of shopaholism during the yuletide season, with broader troubling implications on our modern spiritual wasteland.",1217635200,2,1489,4.830039525691699
3347885,4,B0013K2ZDQ,"Join Reverend Billy and his Church of Stop Shopping Gospel Choir as they exorcise the spiritual powers of compulsive consumption. Bill Talen left San Francisco where he was a talented actor and found his true calling when he landed in New York City's Time Square. There he began his warnings about the ""shopocalypse"" that pedals endless credit and lands us in eternal debt. Reverend Billy dons a white tux and a faux clerical collar for his street theater -- preaching in Starbucks or prophesying against billion dollar corporate profits built on the backs of Bangladeshi children who sew our clothes for seven cents an hour. Most of this documentary follows the Reverend and his choir as they tour America in two junker buses the month before Christmas 2005. You can imagine the sacred shrines they visit on this anti-pilgrimage, including the Mall of America, the headquarters of Wal-Mart, the Las Vegas strip, and the ultimate virtual reality on Christmas Day -- Disneyland, home of the antichrist, Mickey Mouse. The film interviews shopoholics and cultural critics alike (Jim Wallis, Bill McKibben, Andrew Young). Produced by Morgan Spurlock (Super Size Me), this creative social satire would be great for family viewing.",1216684800,3,1225,5.160804020100502

8251416,5,B0013K2ZDQ,"I bought this film in 2010, and now it is a tradition in our family to watch it on black Friday, which is the day after Thanksgiving, a day which we celebrate as ""buy nothing day.""  Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping Gospel choir set off in biodiesel buses on a cross-country trip to stop the Shopocalypse by warning as many people as they can.  Their final stop is Disneyland, and an amazing series of events there.  (By the way, this gospel choir is terrific!!!!!)

Many of the other reviews here provide a good synopsis of this documentary, so I'll add only that  even though Reverend Billy is a performance artist, not an ordained minister,  his ""preaching"" rings truer to me than sermons in my church ever have.  Reverend Billy actually ""walks the walk,"" as well as ""talking the talk,"" something that is very rare in our world today.  And somehow, though  we're absorbing lots of sobering information about how our addiction to material stuff is destroying lives all around the world, including our own lives, Reverend Billy keeps us engaged, surprised, and very entertained.

You can watch ""What Would Jesus Buy?"" for free, here: [...]  I think after you see it, you'll want to buy the DVD, too.",1387324800,,1213,4.701421800947867

8251419,3,B0013K2ZDQ,"I thought the decumentary parts were very thought-provoking. Ie., in Banledesh, workers are forced to work 19 hour days seven days a week for seven cents an hour making clothes for Wal -Mart.  They suffer beatings and hot glue scars and burns, which believe me, REALLY hurt. Forced to work every other day til 3 am. No wonder so many countries hate America. We don't HAVE to hurt other people to survive. ASK QUESTIONS. Today, in a very nice area, I got mad because they had the audacity to put a 250.00 price tag on a shirt made in China, which is of course made with slave labor. I had no problems telling them that it was wrong.

However, the reverend is quite frankly ANNOYING and contradictory of himself. Who does he THINK made the Sure SM 58 microphones he's using? The Chinese! Who made his robes? Who made his bus? The Mexicans? Where did his lovely Apple computer come from? In the movie they show his very nice house with expensive furniture. Try buying shoes that aren't slave made. Try buying a TV or a computer. A new sneaky trick is for example Bose to IMPLY their VERY expensive but very nice noise-cancelling headphones are US-made, but DEEP in the box, IN the PACKAGING, it says, ""oh, BTW, this very expensive product is made with the blood and on the backs of people who can't fight back in China."" For 299.99 they SHOULD be able to make IT HERE. It's ALL PROFIT. We're Americans. We started this country with our very big mouths, and yelling VERY loudly when things are WRONG. and this is WRONG! Read labels. Complain loudly. DEMAND that US law states that they MUST TELL US on the FRONT of the package in READABLE print WHERE the product is made. THEN we have to NOT BUY things that aren't made under fair labor laws. PERIOD. We need to DEMAND to know WHERE in the US this or that is made, or else they will just force the Mexican day workers to do the job under similar conditions. I DON'T have any issue with any people, BUT I do have one with poor Chinese women making Disney princess books and getting their fingers or hands crushed in a printing press. How ironic. I have an issue, with our intentional ignorance and PURPOSELY not bothering to KNOW anything.

How do we go around this? Buy at resale shops. Get TVs refurbished or from the trash like I did. Disney workers in Sri Lanka tried to organize a union and they took the leader outside and broke his kneecaps. How can ANY positive energy come from that transaction for ANYONE? Answer? it can't. This movie is FULL of very informative stuff along the lines of the film The Corporation. Which I could not finish because I heard too many of these stories and cried too hard to finish it. I wish Michael Moore would do a film like this. He's extremely good at getting people to listen with a lot of humor. That is an extremely valuable gift we can use to incorporate a lot of change. it's very difficult to listen otherwise. Ignore Christmas. Send money you'd just spend on pointless junk to worthy charities, such as heifer international, the smile train or PAWS. The first teaches people to care for animals they give them and make an independent living from them. When the animals breed, they pass on the offspring to their neighbors. The smile train fixes cleft palates in children. Paws gives homeless animals a home.

You can make a very concentrated effort to buy from amazon USED but in good shape. The economy has made it such that many people up here have to sell here to pay bills. Make it your business to buy from the little guy. Stay OUT of malls and OUT of corporate greed. stay out of warehouse clubs and big box stores. Many deaths have occurred in poor inpoverished people to supply us with garbage WE DON'T need! Buy the refurbished off brand tablet, and send the other 300.00 to one of the worthy charities and I guarantee you, you will suddenly find yourself with more money! ""Those with much will have more, and those with less will have less so."" This non-verbatim quote means that if you do your part to help the poor and don't be selfish and greedy, and TAKE CARE of those that need help over buying more soon-outdated garbage, you WILL have more.

Good movie, BUY LOCAL when possible. Buy used. HELP others! ASK QUESTIONS! No one needs a ten thousand dollar wedding dress worn for 12 hours and made by forced slavery overseas. No one NEEDS a ring that costs as much as a very decent used car--ten thousand. Of course, made with African slaves, how else?

If you can't pack all you need onto a big motorcycle and live that way for a month, you have too much junk! Give away your junk. Sell it here! Be free from the idolatry of money worship. It's not the cash that's evil, it's the WORSHIP of it, the not caring how you got that new toy. Thank you for reading, and I hope my message was clear. ABOLISH SLAVERY once and for all! How much stuff do you have that you don't use with tags still on it? See? Give yourself a chance to be free and truly happy when you don't NEED anything else that CANNOT make you happy to begin with.
