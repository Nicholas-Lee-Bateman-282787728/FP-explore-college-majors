I love the way the DVD is divided into four major sections.  It makes it convenient if I don't have a lot of time and just want to work out one or two body parts.  The upper, lower, and total body workouts run about 15-20 minutes each and the core workout is around 25-30 minutes.

This is great for those who need a challenging workout but don't want to invest a lot of money in expensive equipment.  All that is required is hand weights (I use 3, 5, and 8 lbs) and a stability ball which you can pick up at any sports store.  You need a floor mat if you are working out on a hard floor.  Most of the exercises rely on your own body weight which is more difficult than you think!

I like the way Lawrence is continuously motivating throughout the entire workout.  It is definitely fast paced, but Lawrence always reminds you to either take a break or lower your weights if necessary.  He also makes reference to how beginners should do the exercises throughout the video and he reminds you to breathe.  Conversely, he encourages you to increase your reps or weight and challenge yourself if it is too easy.  The girls he uses in his video are different shapes and sizes which is motivating in itself.  There are ""tips"" dispersed throughout the DVD and it comes with a useful guide to exercise and nutrition.

If you can keep up with Lawrence and his girls this is definitely a cardio workout - so you build strength and endurance and burn fat all at the same time.  I would highly recommend this DVD.  It's not your everyday cookie-cutter workout and is definitely effective.  Plus, Lawrence has this great accent that keeps you going!",1208736000,,1808,4.424242424242424
8550728,5,B0017W54XI,"Wow, I love this DVD and the exercise and nutritional booklet included in the packet it's really informative, I'd recommend the optimum workout to anyone who is seriously trying to lose weight, build muscle and endurance. The workouts are really effective, unique, they focus on every part of the body and are never boring. I like how the trainer, Lawrence doesn't talk annoyingly too much and how he used regular clients and not your typical paid models in most workout DVDs.",1208476800,,476,4.888888888888889
