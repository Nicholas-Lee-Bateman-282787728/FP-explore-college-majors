7869345,5,6304353456,after a week you start getting results.  the exercises are simple and easy at the first half of the week and just alittle bit harder at the second half.  you feel them working after the week is over and its just 10 minutes a day.,1373500800,,229,4.066666666666666
7869346,3,6304353456,I was nervous when the introduction said you must be fit to do these ab exercises but they were not too difficult for me. I only had to modify twice. I look forward to using this video on a daily basis.,1288828800,,202,3.951219512195122
7869347,5,6304353456,I love that there are 5 different workouts and that it takes on a few minutes a day.  I do this every night before bed and the results are amazing.  At 37 I have better abs than most women in their 20s that I see!,1096502400,2,213,3.7111111111111112
7869348,5,6304353456,"This video is excellent!  I'm only 16 years old and i play volleyball, so it is essential that i work out my abs for spiking and serving.  Kathy has a 5-day workout plan that helps target every area on your stomach that you  know and some you don't.  If you have 10 minutes a day, I recommend that  you buy this video and within weeks, you will start to see results!  I  think this would be excellent, not only for teenagers that need to  strengthen  their stomach area, but adults who just want to lose inches.  This just targets the abs and is fairly hard for me to keep up with.  I do  not recommend this for beginners.  Guys don't hesitate to buy this either.  There are guys working out on this video also and they look like they are  having a time keeping up, so it's not as easy as you might think.",944265600,20,805,4.136363636363637
