8331582,5,B001OTZOX4,"Very effective. Pure Lovecraft. Simple story but that is how it is in some Lovecraft stories. Open a book, or see something strange and that's enough to set off nightmarish events. And its sometimes the things we can't see IE: the Darkness, Imagination, what we think is real but not or visa versa, that are the scariest things.",1465516800,,328,4.672413793103448

8331584,4,B001OTZOX4,"This is a very unique movie! Don't condemn it because of the bad reviews.
First, I should point out the film is only about 20 minutes long. It's a little campy, with low-average to decent acting and very few special effects. Sort of like something a college film student would make as his/her final project. However, it's the concept that wins me over.
This is what genuine horror movies should be more like. There are no cheap jump-scares, no expensive CGI monsters. The audience never sees the supposed monster. It's creepy entirely as a result of the atmosphere. If this was a real high-budget 2-hour movie, it would be amazing.
Definitely put it on the Halloween playlist, or anytime you feel like being a bit creeped out. It's worth 20 minutes of your time.

Also a little note: this doesn't have a rating, so you may not know exactly what to expect at first. I would put it at a PG or PG-13 rating. Probably a bit too scary for your 6-year-old.",1314403200,2,950,4.523255813953488
8331585,5,B001OTZOX4,"What the other reviewer's were smoking when they wrote their reviews is entirely up to debate. Oh alright, that's not quite fair. I suppose, for the sake of argument, if you approach this short film expecting a Hollywood blockbuster, with over the top action scenes, and towering CG monsters.... then yes, you will be disappointed. It is also a very short movie, which might have also been a disappointment to some people if they had not bothered to discover this fact before ordering. However, what this film lacks in big CG monsters, and overall length, it more than makes up for with quality and atmosphere. This is a perfect addition to your must-watch-on-Halloween collection. I will happily stick this right beside Trick 'R Treat, Halloween, and Halloween III: Season of The Witch.",1308528000,,787,4.96969696969697
8331586,1,B001OTZOX4,"This movie was a total waist of time.  The actors need to do more work on their skills.  You will never see them in a major motion film. The story was weak an lame.  Can someone tell me can you give no stars, I gave one because I thought that was the lowest.  Amazon should refund everyones money back that paid for this.",1298678400,,321,4.0476190476190474
8331587,2,B001OTZOX4,"This movie had a nice idea: never show the monster. It also has a few nice visual effects, decent cinematography, and overall decent acting. The boys felt a little uncomfortable around eachother (maybe they needed more practice to better portray a group of friends?) but this wasn't too bad. I think the big problem here was time; this movie had only 16 minutes to introduce the characters, unleash the monster, and kill the characters, and that's just not enough time to effectively build the sort of presence that an unseen monster really needs to be scary. This probably would have played better with just two characters fighting to survive as the evil darkness slowly, but surely closes in for the kill.

As it is, the movie is not scary, not very intersting, and really only worth watching if you're a horror writer looking to learn more about what does and doesn't work in a horror film. Anybody else: steer clear - this movie is 16 minutes of life you cannot get back.",1298332800,,975,4.6686046511627906
8331588,1,B001OTZOX4,"There's good news and bad news. The good news is that it only takes ~16 minutes for this piece of garbage to be over. The bad news is that those 16 minutes will be the most excruciatingly awful minutes of your life.

The premise of the film would have been great if only the acting/directing/sound/cinematography weren't all completely horrible.

I don't know exactly which film festivals handed out the rewards for this video but I can't fathom a world where anything could get worse than this.

In summation, I want my $1.99 and 16 minutes back.",1295136000,,547,4.677083333333333
