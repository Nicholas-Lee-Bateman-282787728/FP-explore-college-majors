I was disappointed that the classic match from 1981, Andre The Giant et al was cut off right in the middle of the action because of the time limit imposed by television at the time. I can't believe television was still so amateurish in the 80s! The presenter looks apologetic when he tells us before the match that it has been chopped.",1389830400,,1146,4.748743718592965
