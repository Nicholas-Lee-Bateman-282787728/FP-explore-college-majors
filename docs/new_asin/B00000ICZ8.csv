1222027,2,B00000ICZ8,its about a young boy(Meyers) who falls prey to his older brother(Modine) and he enters into a life of crime. boring to say the least but Modine sorta is good as always and Meyers is sorta  alittle pretty boy fanstasy for the ladies but whats the point really. its intersting but never quite adds up and I fell alseep at some point,1068076800,,331,4.338709677419355
1222028,5,B00000ICZ8,"Okay, let's set the record straight. This movie was in concept and script a very awesome choice for the average viewer, but some scenes were elegantly pulled off, and some were just pulled off. The lead character ""Josh"" was a convincing complicated teenager (except if you read into it, you can tell that JRM is originally irish)and Matthew Modine is a beautifully acted older brother. Now the I already told you that the actors were great and so was the script, but the scenes were jumpy and sometimes hard to catch. Seeing the movie a second time is highly recommended, not only because the movie was wonderful, but to laugh at some pretty funny scenes (aka josh being pulled over by the chick cop).Overall? Highly recommended.",994809600,9,729,4.7936507936507935
1222029,5,B00000ICZ8,i like this movie a lot and an happy to own it. there are certian priceless scenes (when josh gets pulled over by the chick cop) that provide endless amusement and private jokes. it's a good flick you want something that's fun and not too intense. i highly reccommend this movie to anyone who wants a cool action flick in their collection that hasn't been seen by everyone and their dog already. ...and if you're a JRM fan (as i am) then it simply becomes a nessicity to own for a complete collection.,991094400,,501,4.397849462365591

7910504,4,B00000ICZ8,"I am a recent fan of Mr. Rhys Meyers so I have been watching a lot of his movies lately.  This was one of his early films and I think he was very convincing and did a good job as an American teenager, considering he is Irish.  This film would not receive an Academy Award; however, I find most films that do are boring and not worthy.  I found The Maker very entertaining, and that's what I look for in a film.......to be entertained.  However, not the best script when it came to things like all the criminal activity and they never wore gloves, etc.  (I worked in a police department so I notice things like that in films.)  Anyway, I would recommend it if you want to invest twenty some dollars to purchase it.  (I have no idea why it is so expensive to buy.)",1399248000,3,762,4.178082191780822

7910507,3,B00000ICZ8,"Well I bought this movies because I have a thing for Michael Madsen (even though alot of his movies aren't that great,)I've been really into the show Weeds and I couldn't remember any movies I had seen Mary Louise Parker in, and I love Fairuza Balk. Sadly to say this movies sucked, the story line is just stupid to me. As I watched I remembered that I had seen the movie on channel 20 (houston channel formerly UPN, now MY NETWORK TV or my20) where they play alot of B movies on the weekends, every now and then I might catch something not to bad, but I remembered turning this movie after the brother gets pulled while having to pee real bad. Don't waste your money, I'm sure it with will come on regular t.v. again someday and only watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or watch. I only gave it three stars because it arrived promptly and in good condition.",1272585600,,870,4.310975609756097
