7657341,5,B01BIZRJNQ,great product,1470787200,,13,6.0
7657342,5,B01BIZRJNQ,now have to wait for the second part to be released.  I know i could have bought the whole season for more money.  Just couldn't bring myself to do it.,1461369600,,151,4.0
7657343,5,B01BIZRJNQ,I have been begging BBC and Warner Home Video do this. Finally Matt Smith's first Season gets the Part 1 and Part 2 format. I know a lot of people prefer Getting the box sets but I like this method better. I unfortunately got a bootleg Series 5 box set and have wanted to replace it for a long time. If you want Matt Smith's first run at a cheaper more affordable way. buy this set instead of spending 30-60 dollars.,1455840000,5,416,4.148148148148148

8750353,4,B01BIZRJNQ,"These were some great episodes!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that a small piece of the inside of the box was broken, so that one of the parts that holds the DVDs moves around a bit. It still works and the DVDs are fine.",1528502400,,241,3.7254901960784315
8750354,4,B01BIZRJNQ,"It's very simple why I bought this disk, I love the guy in all his13 incarnations.  Each ""regeneration"" has a unique personality.  Each actor has left a bit of himself in the role.  Matt Smith made me laugh out loud with his comic abilities and made me cry.  The copy I just bought is to replace the one I wore out.",1494201600,,315,4.114754098360656

8750358,5,B01BIZRJNQ,"While I do enjoy these episodes, I feel an amazon product review is not the place to discuss them.
The product itself, however, was great. Fun special features, the disks operated flawlessly, and the packaged arrived entirely unscathed.
Overall, very impressed with quality of the product and the quality of the delivery service. Will definitely buy dvds from amazon again.",1475971200,2,373,5.233333333333333
