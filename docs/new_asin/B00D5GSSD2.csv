What can I say, you get funny dialogue, odd direction, hilarious dubbing, and that special flavor of so bad it's good.  The movie itself is also cleaned up and looks great.  Cinema Epoch has re-released a wonderful lost gem.  B-movie heads must own this.",1398297600,3,363,4.609375
5774983,5,B00D5GSSD2,"Bear in mind with this 5-star review, I'm an MST3K/Rifftrax junkie who seeks out bad movies like the gems that they are. Having said that, this is yet another brilliant movie chock full of 1980s goodness and the always amazing Robert Z'dar - this time he's sporting a Joe Elliot from Def Leppard type hairdo. Don't check this out expecting any Oscar-worthy performances...but by all means, if you're a fan of schlocky movies with bad soundtracks and a whole lotta pseudo-martial arts...your movie awaits you.",1467158400,,508,4.988235294117647
5774984,5,B00D5GSSD2,"This movie did everything perfectly. The plot is amazing, and the ending left me speechless. The acting was exquisite, and I don't think any movie tops this one in special effects. Everything was just perfect. On a scale from 99 to 999.3, I would give it a 10 out of 10.

(And the romance really enthralled me)",1465603200,3,310,4.43859649122807

5774987,4,B00D5GSSD2,"For those of you (like myself) who like their action films that seem to come from some alternate universe, where everyone knows martial arts, the cops are about as helpful as a tick on a deer, guns never seem to run out of bullets and the bad guys somehow multiply out of thin air, then there is no one better at that than director/screenwriter Amir Shervan. He previously gave us the WTF?!? action film HOLLYWOOD COP (1986) and would just a mere year later after this film deliver his cinematic masterpiece called SAMURAI COP. Shervan (who passed away in 2006) was independently wealthy and made films his own way (and it shows), but there seems to be no gray area when it comes to his films. Either you love 'em or hate 'em. Me? I love them with all my heart just because we get to see one man make films his way and not by committee and he had a stable of actors who would follow him to the ends of the Earth. They knew they weren't making anything classic, but since each film took about 30 days to shoot, these people had good-paying jobs with a person who treated them and their ideas like gold. Everyone I have heard speak about Amir Shervan speaks about him as a man who just wanted to make films (at one time, he owned about 70% of all theaters in Iran, before he moved to the U.S.) and was willing to take chances with unknown actors and give well-established actors parts in his films, too. True, the well-established actors were at the low-ebb of their careers, but at least he gave them jobs. And he simply loved the late Robert Z'Dar, who appeared in every film he made (there are still two more Shervan films out there still waiting to be seen: The elusive GYPSY [1991) and YOUNG REBELS [1992], which should be available on DVD a short time after you read this). Yes, I know, Shervan was Iranian, but his heart was pure American cheese, and we should all be happy about that and put our prejudices aside and just go along for the weird trip. The film starts out with scumbag crook Lynch (John Lynch) ""interviewing"" five young female dancers for one opening he has in his club. The first two fail, but the third one hits his zone (he must be a breast man because she has the biggest ones) and he takes her to a dressing room for her ""interview"". Head bad guy Tony Stone (the late Robert Z'Dar; it still hurts my heart to say ""late"") comes walking into Lynch's club and he knocks on the dressing room door, saying, ""I have a big job. Zip it up!"" Lynch tells his new dancer to ""keep it warm"" for him (which she does by pinching her n***les!), as Tony, his brother Jessie (G. Alexander Virdon, Virden or Verdan, depending what film he was in), Lynch and Loony (Co-Procucer and Production Designer Jimmy Williams), who is a little slow in his head, rob what looks like a graveyard for old ice cream trucks with the help of a guard working for them on the inside. Turns out today is the day all the employees get paid and Tony and his mob rob the joint of a bagful of money (employees get paid with cash?) after killing three guards and leaving the premises. The head of the business (Will someone please tell me what kind of business it is?) notices that the crooked guard is shooting into the air rather than at Tony and his gang, so Tony and Lynch get pinched by the police thanks to testimony from the guard. We then see them all on a bus being driven to a maximum security prison, when the bus driver notices what is obvious to the viewer to be a staged accident and stops the bus. Loony (dressed as a woman) and Jessie (playing a man pinned under a pickup truck) then begin to kill all the guards and free Tony and Lynch, but Jessie gets shot and seriously hurt in the process. Tony decides that they will use the first house they find as a place to patch-up Jessie and not leave until he is ready to be moved. It is then that the movie turns into a perverse take on THE DESPERATE HOURS (the 1955 Bogey version, since the 1990 Mickey Rourke version wasn't even made yet), but with the usual Shervan twist. Tony just happens to pick the house of musclehead John Morgan (Harold Diamond, who made three films with Shervan), a horse farmer by trade who has a beautiful wife and sister-in-law and a son who just wants to be like his father, so Dad takes him to martial arts school. While Tony and his gang kill horse trainer Jose (Jessus Quebus) and threaten the sunbathing bikini-clad sisters by the pool. John and his son are at martial arts class, where a boy pushes around John's son, but John reminds him of his training. It's when the kid's father starts pushing around John that they take the battle to the ring and John beats the snot out of him. Remember, do what Daddy says, not what he does. John's wife Doris (Veronica Paul) tells John that she is a nurse (what are the chances?) and she will do her best to patch up Jessie as long as they promise to leave as soon as possible. John and his son arrive home to all this mess (John gets a little beat-down from Tony and Lynch). When Doris decides she doesn't have enough training to fix Jessie, she calls Dr. Fuji (regular Shervan player Joselito C Rescobar; also an Executive Producer; he's about as Japanese as I'm Korean!) to have John drive over to pick him up so he can take care of Jessie's wounds and to make sure he doesn't tell anyone where he is heading. Tony then calls his stepmother (Sandy Palms; also Production Manager) to go to a motel to pick up his bag of money (Wait a second, how did it get hidden there? That room must have been rented out plenty of times after Tony was convicted! My head hurts!) Stepmom makes some kind on boneheaded remark that it may not be best to give him all the money at once (Greedy little b***h!). John and Dr. Fuji are chased by the police, but John manages to lose them in a really bad car chase (I would have stopped for a second, explained my situation to the officers and had the cops surround the place, but that's just me.). Meanwhile, Lt. Sunset (a bored-looking Jim Brown, but you could never tell when Brown was bored or excited) starts his own investigation and ends up at a house of ill repute that Tony's stepmother worked at, but is told she hasn't been there for days (Lt. Sunset thanks a working girl for putting her tongue in his ear before he leaves!). John takes a chance and tries to kill Tony, but Lynch knocks him out and later assaults Doris doggie-style in their own bedroom while she is taking a bath and John is unconscious on the bed (Wait a second. A bedroom with it's own bathtub? Has anyone ever seen that? Anyone have a Tylenol?). John's son manages to steal a gun from a sleeping Loony and he tries to give it to his still groggy father (some hero he is!), so he gives it to his mother, but Tony and the gang get the gun back when they threaten to blow the boy's head off. (Loony goes off on Tony by asking, ""Why do you keep calling me Loony? You know my name is Charles!"" We then find out that Loony is Tony's Uncle and he nicknamed him ""Loony"" because he's not all there in the head.). Not trusting his stepmother, Tony sends John to pick up the bag of money at the motel, which Lt. Sunset and his squad already have staked out. They are keeping a close eye on Tony's stepmother when John enters the scene and all the cops become so confused, they make the Three Stooges look like MENSA members. John collects the money (along with a handgun) and, after kicking a couple of cops in the butt, manages to get away. Lt. Sunset (probably named that because that is where his career is headed) and his Keystone Kops look through the area for John, when Lt. Sunset finally hits on a good idea. Find the house closest to the bus disaster. When John gets home, he sees that Jose is dead. John hides the money and throws the gun on the roof. When he gets into the house, he tells Tony and his gang that stepmom screwed them over and took off with all the money. While the gang tries to figure out what to do next, John has his son climb on the roof to get the gun and Lynch calls in for enforcements. His son gives John the gun and Loony is the first to die (Doris now has Loony's shotgun). Lynch is the next to die while he tries to circle around and ambush John, but John is too smart for that and puts a slug in his chest (Doris finishes him off with a shotgun blast to the balls for raping her). Dr. Fuji calls the police (who still couldn't find John's farm!) and gives them all the information, while Tony and Jessie (who is such a bad actor, he makes Tara Reid look like a pro. He has an interview on the DVD, so you can judge for yourself) try to get away. John begins to kill all the backup Lynch called for (usually by gunshot, but there is some bad hand-to-hand combat in there, too, as well as a fire gag). Tony grabs the dead Jose's young son Fernando (Played by Jessus Quebus Jr., the real-life son of the actor who played Jose) and uses him as a hostage. He will give John the kid if he gives him the keys to his car. Before this can happen, the police sirens rapidly get louder and John shoots and kills Jessie. Lt. Sunset finally arrives and Tony uses Fernando as a human shield. For some reason only known to Shervan, Tony throws away his gun and Fernando and decides he would rather go hand-to-hand with John. After a short fight, it ends with John and Lt. Sunset shooting and killing Tony. John gives the bag of money to Jose's widow and kids. Forget murder and rape, money solves everything, especially money that is not yours to give away!  Yes, this is as goofy as it sounds, but there is so much more dialogue I haven't written down that will make your head spin. One example is when Tony points a gun at Fuji's head and says, ""Apologize to me gook or I'll blow your head off!"" or when one of Lt. Sunset's cops takes a look at John and says, ""Who's that bear?"" While not nearly as bat-shit crazy as Shervan's other two previously released films, it is still a mess of a film that will have you in stitches. Nearly everyone either wears suits or sleeveless shirts and parachute pants, which makes it totally 80's and 100% insane (just take a look at the martial arts fight in the ring). Just enjoy it for what it is. If you can tell me exactly what it is, you are a better person than I am. In any case, I would recommend that you make Amir Shervan's films a permanent part of your film library. Also known as AMERICAN MURDER. Also starring Bret Johnston, Lareine, Buck Striker, Keith Rosary, Don Jean Brown, Terry Amos, Allen Perada, Sam Travino, Raymond Soto and David Kinder.

5774992,4,B00D5GSSD2,"In recent years there has been growing momentum for cult action flicks from the 80s that are so awful its unbelievable. Deadly Prey, Miami Connection, and Samurai Cop are some of the genre favs right now and I can honestly say I love all three. They make great party movies to sit around and laugh at. They are highly violent with lots of stunts, shooting, and general mayhem. They also feature highly quotable dialogue that gets better every time you see it. The director of Samurai Cop, Amir Shervan directed 5 films in the late 80s/early 90s and never lived to see the revival of Samurai Cop as a new favorite for the MST3k crowd. When I found out another one of his films had been unearthed I knew I had to check it out immediately and thanks to the folks at Cinema Epoch we can all now enjoy another Shervan classic, Killing American Style.

Fans of Samurai Cop will notice a few familiar faces in Killing American Style, most notably the face of Robert Zdar (Maniac Cop, Tango and Cash). The film is about a group of crooks lead by Zdar that knock over an ice cream truck depot and go out on the lam. They get caught by the cops but break free, seeking refuge in a remote house owned by John Morgan (long haired ass kicker by trade). They take the family hostage while they wait for Zdars mom to bring them the loot they have hidden. Its up to Morgan to come up with a plan to kill these thugs, American style!

Let me begin by saying that Killing American Style isn't the howlingly bad film I was hoping for. It does have some great bad dialogue but the film is much more adept at being a real film. Its got action, tension, scenery chewing bad guys, more action, and then after that more action. Samurai Cop his hilarious but its also badly paced and stalls out towards the end. KAS does not. Its thoroughly fun for the entire run time and honestly kept me engaged. Its a fun action flick and it was meant to be. Samurai Cop tires to be serious while also being silly ala Lethal Weapon and fails at both. KAS is more like other direct to video actioners from the time and is for the most part pretty competent. Dont let the dissuade you though. It really is a big bucket of fun. Jim Brown plays the lead detective hunting down the thugs and though he arguably has the most experience acting in films hes probably the worst player here. Hes stiff, awkward, and has the charisma of a wooden board. Which is pretty damn funny. Zdar hams it up plenty, laying down his requisite 110% effort which is much appreciated as well. I really wish he could have been bigger. I love watching him play bad guys. Hes got that great whispery voice and those intense eyes. Hes just so much fun to watch. We also get to see him in a sex scene which is prettyawkward. Its clear that the main players try really hard here to make the best film they could with what they had, well except the check cashing Jim Brown that is.

Killing American Style is a fun, action packed, direct to video cheapie that delivers the goods. No it isn't as iconic and hilarious as Samurai Cop but it doesnt suffer from the dead spots Samurai Cop has either. Everyone is bringing their best to the film and I really enjoyed watching it. Films like KAS often fall into the inept and boring category but that is not the case here. Its silly, fun, and has a handful of awful lines to satisfy Samurai Cop fans. The dvd features an interview with a smaller character in the film but it was great to get some insight on how the film was made and what Zdar and Shervan were like at the time. The picture quality is great too. Its clear Cinema Epoch put great care in putting this out and is no way a cheap cash grab. Cinema Epoch also released Samurai Cop on dvd so heres hoping they put out Hollywood Cop, Gypsy and Young Rebels too!",1400544000,7,3793,4.309523809523809
