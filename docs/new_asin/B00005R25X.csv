7951818,5,B00005R25X,This is a great movie for children My grand daughter loves it!  I would have to say (and warn you) I don't think they had much money to make this movie. Some of the actors were kinda bad.,1439596800,,187,3.9210526315789473

7951820,3,B00005R25X,"Ok, I am biased.  Scoot was my moms dog- purchased only because I had gotten married and moved out of the house and took my dalmatian with me.  Her name was Ansel, she passed away just a few months ago (3/2012).  We all had fun making the movie that summer and she got great training from a top notch trainer for free.  But most importantly she and the other dogs got to know each other AND since the movie was shot at the local humane society and ASPCA they got free press.  Additionally, the last scene was a fund raiser for the humane society.
The movie itself, well I now have kids, and it is definitely a kid movie.  Somedays I think it is worse than others.  Today it was a good day- kids asked for it AND it held their attention.  Other days, not so much.
Again, I am biased because now that Ansel has passed we have this great memento.  Even my dog Hopkins appears at the end during the fair.",1339545600,,900,4.15606936416185

I repeat, Calling all animal lovers...Calling all animal lovers.

I repeat for a second time, Calling all animal lovers...Calling all animal lovers.

Okay, now that everyone is together, let me congratulation Scoot on his recent accomplishment!

Congratulations, Scoot, on helping to save the animal shelter! Your dalmatian mommy would be very proud if she hadn't been put down because of hip displacement due to severe inbreeding!

Sometimes in life its easy to forget about the important things, like Deke, the dead German Shepherd, and that saving animals is a nobler cause than making money from hot dog sales (although the ""dogs for dogs"" program now contributes money from the sale of hotdogs toward saving dogs). This movie teaches children and adults of all ages that not all animals have families, and that animals can talk to each other, even without vocal chords or moving lips, or lips at all. Let us listen to the children, and the animals, and the inner voice inside each of us that the world may become a better place for animals and children, and even our own selves.",1218931200,,1139,4.973684210526316
7951822,3,B00005R25X,"The reviewer, Michael, must have judged these movies by adult standards.  However, these are good movies for the pre-school set.  They are great when Mommy has to fix dinner and wants the tiny ones out of her hair!  It probably should be five stars for pre-schoolers; I gave it three because parents would find it to be a quite slow and juvenile story if they wish to watch them with the toddlers!",1134691200,,397,4.486111111111111
7951823,1,B00005R25X,"Part of a two disc collection, this one is really a dog!  It's as though a local little theater group got together and decided to film a movie, perhaps given the money by a local millionaire.  The results are pretty tepid; even kids will find this one a howler.  With a script that seems written by a pink slipped author, PAWS AND CLAWS tries to make up for its human inadequacies by giving the animals ""thought"" dialogue, but even the cuteness of the critters can't save this one.  The ""Let's Save the Animal Shelter"" plotline is so shoddily concocted, one can only hope the shelter shuts down and all the animals are let loose.  I'm usually a sucker for cute animal movies, but PAWS AND CLAWS RESCUERS is just a big mess.",1134172800,,723,4.446969696969697
