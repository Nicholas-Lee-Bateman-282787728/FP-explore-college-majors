1246036,5,B00001TZ6P,"I first saw ""Going My Way"" when I was stayed home sick from school for two days when I was about 10 years old. I fell in love instantly and have seen this movie over and over again. I love the characters. Barry Fitzgerald is so adorable as the old-school Father who does a lot of head shaking about Bing's new, relaxed clerical manner. ""Holiday Inn"" is wonderful too with so many songs that we all know. One of my favorite parts of this movie is when Fred Astaire is dancing and throwing the fire crackers down on the stage in the 4th of July performance. This one is not as good as ""White Christmas"", in my humble opinion but it's definately worth watching a few times.",976579200,9,670,4.283464566929134
1246037,5,B00001TZ6P,"Absolutely the best holiday movie ever. Beautifully cast, amazing set design, and so reminiscent of true Hollywood Christmas you'll wish the century was turing back to 1900.",945907200,3,173,5.444444444444445
1246038,5,B00001TZ6P,The movie Going my Way is a breath of freash air and a wonderful escape from the modern movies.  This movie is both funny and innocent.  A movie that both young and old can watch together.  The characters in the movie  are both warm and different in their own way.  A must see during the  holidays and beyond.,945129600,,309,4.241379310344827
1246039,4,B00001TZ6P,"Bing Crosby in one of his better roles, sans any of the ""Road"" pictures he did with Bob Hope. Set in Connecticutt in the 1930's, Bing along with Fred Astaire sing, dance and romance their way through this  Irving Berlin orchestrated film. Don't take anything in this movie too  seriously, as this is a light hearted romp through the holidays. Although a  tad dated now (there's a reference in one part showing Thanksgiving  bouncing from the 3rd Thursday of the month of November, to the last  Thursday and back, and photos of old bi-wing airplanes), this movie does  touch on some really nice moments that today in our hurried state of mind,  we seem to forget. The best song of course is ""White Christmas""  which was release originally in this film. Bing gets the lady in the end  (altough Fred Astaire does also), and the supporting cast had a flair for  comedy and timing long before today's artists were even thought of. This  film does make you wish for the simpler days of large ballrooms, radio  shows, and true ""Holiday Inns"". This one is a definate Christmas  favorite in our house, especially after the kids have gone to bed on  Thanksgiving night. You can't go wrong with this one for the Holidays.",943142400,30,1210,4.64622641509434

1246054,5,B00001TZ6P,"LOVED IT!!!!  There is a reason despite all the big screen competition in its day this won the Oscar for Best Picture (Going My Way).  It is a truly poignant, life changing story which harkens back to a more innocent era (or was it?) when goodness mattered above all.  The music and Title Song will stay with you long after watching and the surprise ending will bring tears of joy just to think about.  It is a remarkable tale of one courageous Priest's positive faith and unfailing, loving charm in a challenging world.  Will blow you away!  Holiday Inn is a great bonus, also uplifting film at Christmas with two iconic actors and stellar cast.  .... and yes, the happy ending we all need right now.",1490400000,,701,4.515873015873016

Love these movies! perennial faves... NO, they don't have any chase scenes', no sex, or violence,  just some sweet corny Bing songs, and some incredible dance numbers from Fred Astaire.

Famous for introducing ""White Christmas,"" the best-selling single of all time and an instant favorite with troops overseas, ""Inn"" is consistently tuneful and entertaining with a sublime Berlin score that covers not just Christmas, but all major holidays. Watch for the July 4th rave-up ""Let's Say It With Firecrackers,"" one of many musical highlights.",1182470400,,534,5.6875
1246198,5,B00001TZ6P,"Going My Way deservedly won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Original Story. It is such a warm story written and directed by Leo McCarey (who also wrote Love Affair, Bells of St. Mary's and An Affair to Remember as well as directed the latter two).

The movie's warmth owed much to the wonderful performance of Barry Fitzgerald (Best Actor in a Supporting Role), as the lovable and respectable elderly Father Fitzgibbon, despite his old school of strict rules and hardships expected of a clergyman. And Bing Crosby(Best Actor), as Father O'Malley, came to rescue the old church with utmost regard of Father Fitzgibbon's delicate feeling. Bing Crosby's portrayal of a sensible, upright Father who enjoyed a close relationship with the younger generation was most impressive. The joyful and buoyant Father O'Dowd (Frank McHugh) provided the optimistic mood often needed to uplift the morale of the other two Fathers. The personal sacrifice made by Fitzgibbon, his longing to see his mother far away, the subplots of a radiant contralto of Metropolitan Opera Association (Rise Stevens) with a gold heart, the father and son money lenders, a nave run away 18-year old (Jean Heather) all make a wonderful story.

In addition, there is much good music performed by Bing Crosby (Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra, Silent Night, Swinging on a star - Best Original Music) and Rise Stevens (Ave Maria, Habanera of Carmen)with the Robert Mitchell Boychoir. There is just a right balance between the good Christmas spirit and delightful Christmas music. It leaves you adoring the kindness and integrity of these good characters while humming the beautful tones.

For a different kind of light and highly entertaining holiday treat, Holiday Inn must be the one. White Christmas sung by Bing Crosby, first solo followed by duet with Marjorie Reynolds, in the first half hour of the movie alone is a classic number not to be missed. However, the movie offers much more than meets the eye.

The idea of having a holiday inn which opened for 15 holidays throughout the year is ingenious. In no more natural setting can numbers be inserted at Christmas, Lincoln's birthday, Valentine's Day, Washington's birthday, Easter Parade, Independence Day as in this movie. The elegant and radiant Marjorie Reynolds sang beautifully with Bing Crosby and danced gracefully with Fred Astaire, so was Virginia Dale. Added to it the lively performance of the trio's agent (Walter Abel) and Bing Crosby's cook Mamie(Louise Beavers) with two cute child actors. This is such a warm and delightful holiday movie that one can enjoy all 100 minutes of singing and dancing.",1167091200,,2662,5.140877598152425
1246199,4,B00001TZ6P,"(GOING MY WAY reviewed as a single feature on videocassette.)

We are in an entertainment age of rampant violence, language, and sexuality.  On a recent Monday, I watched two tapes worth of HBO shows.  I could actually feel my soul corroding from violence in the admittedly well acted THE SOPRANOS, very strong language in the beautifully designed DEADWOOD, and sex scenes with full nudity in the new BIG LOVE.  They make me want to cancel my subscription to HBO and go back to bygone Hollywood on Turner Classic Movies.

Producer/director/co-writer Leo McCarey's GOING MY WAY (1944) won a whopping seven Oscars the same year as such powerhouses as DOUBLE INDEMNITY, LAURA, MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, and SINCE YOU WENT AWAY.  It is a sweet and likeable movie.  Not great art, but very pleasant and soul-restoring.  We have Oscar winners Bing Crosby as progressive young Father O'Malley and Barry Fitzgerald as the aging conservative Father Fitzgibbon interacting at venerable St. Dominick's.

GOING MY WAY runs an overlong 126 minutes and is constructed as a series of interacting plot strands.  G-rated juvenile delinquents become members of the church choir and (off-screen) go with Father O'Malley to a baseball game.  They later sing a song for Rise Stevens (of the Metropolitan Opera) as Genevieve Linden.  Father O'Malley was the first person to praise Genevieve, who in turn gives encouragement to the boys, who subsequently sing the lovely and Oscar-winning ""Swinging on a Star.""

Fitzgerald's Father Fitzgibbon is an endearing character who has a bottle of whiskey hilariously hidden inside a bookcase music box that plays ""Toora, Loora, Loora"" all the time.  The same lovely, sentimental song figures prominently in the very poignant final scene.  Watch Father Fitzgibbon's expression when he realizes he has eaten a stolen turkey (by two of the boys) at Thanksgiving.  And watch him play golf with Father O'Malley and mistakenly, happily think he has gotten a really good score.

Then there is Carol (pretty Jean Heather), a runaway teenager who eventually marries a World War Two (1944 movie) soldier named Ted, whose father (Gene Lockhart) holds the mortgage on St. Dominick's.  Lockhart does something nice with that mortage at Christmas time in the final reel.  Ted asks dad to ""look after Carol while [he is] away.  She'll grow on you.""  On the sidelines is Frank McHugh, always fun, as Father O'Dowd.

I like GOING MY WAY quite a lot.  It is very sentimental, but (to rewrite the final line of Preston Sturges' great 1941 SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS) there is a lot to be said for sentimentality and old-fashioned virtues in our frenzied and cynical computer age.",1142640000,9,2667,5.052631578947368

1246205,4,B00001TZ6P,"Oscar-winning director Leo McCarey delivers a heartwarming and touching film that only has a very few weak spots.  Although the film neither revolves around Christmas, nor even includes it until near the end, it has become a perennial holiday must-see.

Even more than a half-century later, audiences still enjoy Bing Crosby as Father O'Malley (same role he plays in the not-nearly-so-good Bells of St. Mary's), a laid-back but innovative young priest out to rescue a failing parish in a tough New York neighborhood.  There are other impressive performances but the finest is that of Barry Fitzgerald (The Quiet Man, How Green was My Valley)as a crotchety but good-hearted old Irish priest.

Bing must deal with wayward youth, a runaway young lady, and financial problems.  Most of all, he must deal with the entrenched ways of Fitzgerald and some of his congregants.

It's a gentle, innocent, and touching story.  Although the songs might seem a bit corny today, they are still enjoyable and Bing's honeyed voice is always worth listening to.

This film is a good addition to most any film library, not just to your holiday films.",1132531200,,1131,5.010695187165775
1246206,5,B00001TZ6P,"If you're looking for a nostalgic movie of a bygone American era to watch with your family, ""Going My Way"" is one of those great classics to see. While some viewers may identify with the Irish-American ethnicity and culture of the Catholic Church in this film, the movie is actually quite universal in theme. It deals more with how we should respect the aged and the young; and how we can lend a helping hand to them in a non-intrusive and innovative way.

The teacher? Enter Father O'Malley (Bing Crosby), the good Samaritan sent by the Bishop to help the aged Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald). His mission is to rid St. Dominic of its debts and at the same time provide pastoral care to the inner-city youth and their families. Through his wit, musical talent and baseball gab, he is successful in turning it all around. Okay, so it sounds a bit too simplistic to believe by today's standards. Nevertheless, it's still a valuable moral lesson that's well worth emulating.

On the comedic side, look for the scenes involving Crosby and Fitzgerald. The chemistry between these two is undeniably magical. Among the scenes to watch are the ones involving the hot turkey, hedgerow, rain-drenched Fr. Fitzgibbon and golf game. Particularly touching is Fr. O'Malley arranging to have Fr. Fitzgibbon's 90 year old mother brought from Ireland to visit her son. Again, some might find this sort of thing a tad schmaltzy, but that's what makes this such a wonderful film.

I suppose this is why it won seven academy awards, including Best Actor (Bing Crosby), Best Supporting Actor (Barry Fitzgerald) and Best Song (""Singing On A Star"").

Bundled on this DVD is another classic, ""Holiday Inn"", starring Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, Virgina Dale and Majorie Reynolds. It's one of those old-time Hollywood song-and-dance films with the legendary crooner and hoofer. And sing and dance they do while winning over the girls at a bed-and-breakfast type inn called the Holiday Inn. No, this isn't the renowned hotel chain, Holiday Inn. But the movie title was the inspiration for this establishment.

In this movie, Fred Astaire's former partner Bing Crosby retires to the country life on a farm, but soon learns he's not cut out to be a farmer. So he decides to supplement his income by staging shows only and during the holidays in his country estate, hence the name Holiday Inn. Fred Astaire choreographs some rather ingenious scenes while feigning inebriation on New Year's Eve and tapping to the rhythm of firecrackers on Independence Day. While Bing sings 15 Irving Berlin songs, including his hit ""White Christmas"". It's a clever premise and a delightful result at that!

For an evening of nostalgia to gladden the heart, these two Crosby films will do nicely. Best of all, you will get two truly enjoyable movies for the price of one.",1123632000,11,2829,4.907949790794979
1246207,4,B00001TZ6P,"This DVD features two movies that played very important roles in the extraordinary career of Bing Crosby.  ""Going My Way"" won him an Oscar for Best Actor and provided one of his biggest hits, ""Swinging on a Star.""  ""Holiday Inn"" gave Bing his signature song and one of the largest selling singles of all time - ""White Christmas.""  Just based on these two criteria, these movies are must sees.  They also both happen to be pretty good films.

In ""Going My Way"" (1944), Bing plays Father Chuck O'Malley, a somewhat suave priest sent to a new parish.  The current priest, Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald), is rather old-fashioned and the powers that be hope that Bing can save the church.  Of course, Bing and Fitzgibbon clash, but all ends well.  The movie was a huge success and won a boatload of Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor for Fitzgerald, and Best Song for ""Swinging on a Star.""  The movie's success led to the inevitable sequel, ""The Bells of St. Mary's,"" with Ingrid Bergman serving as Bing's foil.  Oscar history was also when Fitzgerald was nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor due to a loophole.  The movie is quite enjoyable, although more than a bit schmaltz; sure to leave you feeling toasty.

""Holiday Inn"" (1942) is a musical built around songs by Irving Berlin.  The set-up is genius: Bing runs an inn that is open only on holidays, replete with the kids putting on a big song and dance number.  A love triangle between Bing, Marjorie Reynolds, and Fred Astaire, serves at the ostensible plot, but it's really jerry-rigged around the Berlin songs.  Foremost among these songs are two Christmas classics - ""White Christmas"" and ""Happy Holidays.""  Some of the other songs are quite clever, especially the ones written for Abraham Lincoln and George Washington's birthdays (the former is spoiled, though, by a black-face routine).  Of course, almost any song sounds great when crooned by the ultra-smooth Bing or Astaire.  The movie is great fun, and won an Oscar for Best Song (""White Christmas"").

Overall, these are two fine Bing Crosby movies, albeit a bit overly sentimental.  The DVD transfer is fairly good, although there are no extras.  Fortunately, subtitles are included, enabling the viewer to pick up every word of the amusing Berlin songs in ""Holiday Inn.""  This package is a great deal - Highly Recommended.",1120867200,12,2416,4.928217821782178
1246208,5,B00001TZ6P,"""Going My Way"" is a must see movie for any Bing Crosby fan.  It is here, with this effort, that he won his one and only acedemy award.  It should be noted, however, that Bing had some stiff competition for the award ... from Barry Fitzgerald, his co-star in this movie.  Barry was nominated in both the Best Actor and the Best Supporting Actor categories (with him winning the latter) and it is he, Barry Fitzgerald, not Bing Crosby who makes ""Going My Way"" a classic.

As the young priest sent to help a struggling parish, Bing is in good form here, but he is simply out-classed by Fitzgerald (who plays the old priest who runs the parish).  Bing sings some memorable songs, including ""Would You Like To Swing On A Star"" and a very lovely and touching rendition of the old Irish lullaby ""Too Rah Loo"".  And though he never sings, Mr. Fitzgerald takes full advantage of every line he's given to speak ... injecting them with much wry humor, and using them to project ""the old country"" sensabilities.

This might be the best example:

(When being brought back to the rectory after a failed attempt to ""run away"")

Cop: ""Why don't you just go in there, say that you were a bad boy, and tell them that you're sorry.""

Fitzgerald: ""Why don't you go to church this Sunday, say that you haven't been to mass in ten years, and tell them that YOU'RE sorry.""

There are a couple of short-comings in this picture.  The opera singer Rise Stevens is used as an old high school friend of Bing's, and she is forced into the story and then is used too much.  If her presence had been eased in, it would have worked nicely, I think, but her celebrity status (in real life) seems to have dictated this clumsy handling of her character.  Also, the banker's son, played by James Brown, has an affair, gets married, joins the military service, is whisked off to the war, and comes home as a wounded soldier (in time for the final scene) all in what seems to be a short period of time.  I think the essential idea was to get the patriotic sentiment working for this picture, but, there again, it is forced in, and the final product is kind-of hard to buy.

It is, however, the ending of ""Going My Way"" that certifies it as a classic.  This scene pulls the heart right out of your chest (and the tears right out of your eyes).  I have read it described as a ""privilege"" for us to see ... and I agree whole-heartedly with that assessment.  It is just a great great ending for a pretty good movie that has an outstanding performance by Barry Fitzgerald.",1108425600,,2529,4.4
1246209,5,B00001TZ6P,"These two classics belong in everyone's home dvd library.

With ""Holiday Inn"", you get Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire in TOP form, and it simply doesn't get any better than that. Mix in a plethora of Irving Berlin songs, and the result is pure musical gold. Not only is the all time classic ""White Christmas"" introduced for the first time -- when Bing had most of his vocal range -- but Bing's interpretation of ""Easter Parade"" is hardly ""chopped liver""! Fred Astaire's dancing is sublime, as usual, especially his very annimated ""Firecracker"" number. A movie you will watch OVER and OVER AGAIN!

""Going My Way"" established Bing Crosby as the truly fine actor he really was. Bing was reluctant to play a priest because of his theretofore image as a male romantic musical lead. However, his warm, understated and deft playing of the Father O'Malley role won him the Oscar for Best Leading Actor of 1944. With an excellent supporting cast -- including Barry Fitzgerald who almost steals the pictute -- ""GMW"" is an all time family classic. An often overlooked piece of movie trivia is that Bing Crosby was nominated again for Best Actor in 1945 for playing his ""Father O'Malley"" role in ""Bells Of Saint Mary's""! This may be the only time any one was nominated for Best Actor in successive years for playing the same role, which proves that Bing's reluctance to play a priest was severly misplaced! Incidentially, ""GMW"" won SEVEN Oscars, including Best Picture of 1944.",1104710400,,1463,4.824701195219124
1246210,4,B00001TZ6P,"Every now and then you need a silly, no-brainer Bing movie to lift your spirits; it just makes you think everything is going to be OK and that people do really do things for the right reasons.  Holiday Inn, if I'm not mistaken, was the first movie that he sang ""White Christmas"" in -- not as good a flick as ""White Christmas"" with Danny Kaye and Rosemary Clooney, of course, but no slouch, none the less.",1104537600,3,404,4.315789473684211
1246211,5,B00001TZ6P,"This amazing film, which few people know, won eight Academy Awards in its debut in 1943.  At that time, America was embroiled in WWII and facing the prospect of a world dominated by fascism and Tyranny.  This movie shows the heart of the American People whom the Axis powers thought would never fight back after Pearl Harbor.  It demonstrates the soul of a Nation immersed in the peaceful pursuit of individual kindess, compassion and personal commitments to make the World a better place.

This was the world of ""The Great Generation.""  It shows the individual character of the people of the generation which shepherded us through the Great Depression and World War II.

The movie shows that in any generation, in any world we make for ourselves, it is the individual's commitment to decency, honor and hope which brings us through the most difficult times in life.  It shows us the value of ""a helping hand.""  It shows us the need for each of us to strive to be something more than what the world would try to force us to become with its challenges and adversities.

When Hemingway wrote ""The Sun Also Rises"" he was describing the moral bankruptcy of ""The Lost Generation"" (in the words of Gertrude Stein).  The title of the book ""The Sun Also Rises"" comes from Ecclesiastes: "" . . . the sun sets, but, the sun also rises.""  This message in Ecclesiastes is meant to give hope that even in the darkness we can remain confident that the sun will come again and things will get better.

This movie represents the Sun rising and lighting the way with  a new generation in America after WWI and the Great Depression.

Those of all generations might view it.  America is in dark times and heading towards times that may be darker.  We need to know, from movies such as this, that there is hope in the darkness if we light the candle within.",1104192000,3,1836,4.568807339449541
1246212,5,B00001TZ6P,"On the surface you would not think these two films would complement one another.  On the contrary, they do contain a unifying theme: They are heartwarmers, just the anecdote the country needed during the strife that was the World War II.

""Going My Way"": A tuneful film that just tugs at your heartstrings.  The role of Father O'Malley, the progressive priest that is sent to straighten out the troubled New York parish, fits the easy-going Bing Crosby like a fine suit.  Barry Fitzgerald as the curmudgeonly Father Fitzgibbon is not only one of the most indelible characters in film history but also one of the most lovable.  This film just floats on good vibes.  Five stars.

""Holiday Inn"":  Thoroughly engaging musical about a jilted singer (Crosby) who opens an inn that only caters to the holiday crowd.  Good comic rivalry between Crosby and his former partner(Fred Astaire).  Astaire's dance routines are poetry in motion and it doesn't even look like he's trying.  I'd like to re-iterate what a previous reviewer said about Marjorie Reynolds being effervescent here as the girl that the boys battle over.  I've never seen Reynolds in anything else that I can recall and I'd like to know why.  Needless to say, classic score by Irving Berlin.  One thing that would give pause to a modern audience is a production number commemmorating Lincoln's birthday done in blackface.  Five Stars.",1103500800,4,1392,4.939655172413793
1246213,5,B00001TZ6P,"This DVD release of GOING MY WAY and HOLIDAY INN is purely OUTSTANDING!  As both of these films have been perennial favorites for sixty years, I need not comment on their merits.  I will say that these are some of the best DVD transfers of older films I have ever seen.  The pictures for both films (in black and white) are crisp and clear, black levels are solid and well defined, and there is no graininess to speak of.  Age-related artifacts are virtually non existent.  The soundtracks of both films are beginning to show their age, but still sound beautiful and clear.  Other than theatrical trailers for both films, there are no other extras, but we get two great films in outstanding transfers for less than the price of one, so we have absolutely no right to gripe.
In my opinion, these two films aren't the obvious choices to pair together (Holiday Inn paired with White Christmas, and Going My Way put on the same disc as The Bells of St. Mary's would have been the most obvious choice), but I digress.  Hats off to Universal Home Video for this EXCELLENT release.  The DVD is a MUST HAVE in any collection.  RUN to buy a copy.

NOTE: The cover art shown is not the same as the current, most recent DVD release from Universal Home Video, the one which you see at most retailers during the holidays.",1103155200,96,1308,4.481012658227848
1246214,5,B00001TZ6P,"In Holiday Inn it isn't Bing Crosby or Fred Astair that makes the movie outstanding, but rather the relatively unknown ""B"" movie star of the time, Marjorie Reynolds. As you watch this movie you can ""feel"" the mood that Marjorie is portraying at the time, just by the look on her face. For example, during the the ""Easter"" scene, her eyes and smiles say it all, you can see she is in love, and as she sings ""White Christmas"" at the end you can feel the tears building p in your eyes - thoughout the entire movie she says more with her facial expressions then the most popular movie stars do today in their entire careers... If you love truly good acting, Holiday Inn will make you smile and make you cry, you will love Marjorie Reynolds  and it will bring back memories of a time when ladies could truly dance in high heel shoes, we don't see that type of dancing in many movies these days. Picture quality, sound and special effects are not of primary importance in these kinds of films, these are the kind that rely on your own imagination and feelings, much in the way you do when you read a good book.

Going my way is also a good old movie which may bring tears to your eyes at the end and is generally a ""feel good"" movie. It really does a nice portrayal of the good side of the catholic church. However, it won't make  you fall in love with the lead woman as you do with Ingmar Bergman in ""The Bell's of Saint Mary's""

Having these movies to watch over and over again to stir up your emotions and forget your toubles is like having a prescription drug to ease you through those tough times in life. However, you must be able to look past the lack of color, the lack of fancy graphics, sounds or special effects and just appreciate the true acting involved.",1100908800,5,1762,4.298192771084337
1246215,5,B00001TZ6P,"I think that ""Holiday Inn"" paired with ""The Bells of St. Mary's"" or ""White Christmas"" would have made more sense. Oh well, these are still two GREAT 40's classics. It surprised me that they were both on one DVD! The B&W picture and sound quality are excellent! None of the old ""pops & skips"" of the really old films. Tom Keogh did a great review (above) so I won't repeat his words. If you're like me you'll be amazed at how the 2 hours FLY by on both of these movies because the stories captivate you with their ""old B&W movie"" charm. The camera doesn't switch scenes 3 times a second like the movies of today do. The only parts of ""Going my way"" that I didn't like was the 3 minute ""Opera"" song and then the same lady singing ""Going my Way"" later. I hate Opera! But that's me. A real ""tear jerker"" at the end, however! Get the tissues ready. Holiday Inn is similar to White Christmas, just as the Bells of St. Mary's is similar to Going my Way, but I still watch them all. Bing's voice & Fred's dancing should never be missed! They should be shown in schools to show kids what real movies & good songs were like. I wish Amazon would somehow allow us to preview parts of these movies(like a movie trailer). I'm now starting to collect them since they've come out on DVD. Turnerclassicmovies.com shows trailers from some movies but not all. I view them there and buy them here. Hope this helps someone.",1100044800,10,1402,4.334600760456274
1246216,5,B00001TZ6P,"A movie that is forgotten by most that is really worth seeing.  This movie should be added to the classic Christmas list. This movie makes me laugh and cry, especially because Bing Crosby actually had Barry Fitzgeralds' mother brought over from Ireland and be filmed in the last minutes of the movie. Warm, wonderful and lighthearted.",1073606400,2,334,4.964285714285714
1246217,4,B00001TZ6P,"On the face of it, HOLIDAY INN and GOING MY WAY, despite both being Bing Crosby films from the early 40s, were not exacltly an obvious pairing for a DVD ""twofer"" package.  You might think it more likely to pair the former with WHITE CHRISTMAS, say, and the latter with its actual sequel THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S.  But this coupling works precisely because it's not so obvious.
Mixing pious Crosby with show-biz Crosby works because, in the last analysis, he's still the same old Bing, affable, low key and agreeable.  His priest is still a mensch.  His show biz vet is a regular guy looking for a way OUT of the limelight and into a sane and stable way of life.  In other words, he's a mensch too.
If you were raised Catholic in the last century, you know that among the clergy, you had your staid, old-school, well, OLD-COUNTRY types, who struck fear in the hearts of children and adults in the parish.  Then you had your spirited, fun-loving priests (and nuns), who weren't above playing a few innings of baseball or running a sack race.
GOING MY WAY touches, very lightly, upon the clash of those two strains among the clergy of the era.  Actually, the more traditional Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald) is more irascible than truly terrifying.  And young Father O'Malley is as all business behind the charm and easy going manner.  He just knows that you win more flies with honey than vinegar.  And he knows how to get things done.  He also knows that he can loosen up the older priest with a few rounds of golf and some fresh air.
The plot amounts to little more than ""Let's put on a show to save the parish church.""  Almost absurdly, a famous opera star (played by famous opera star Rise Stevens) shows up to help out, and high power music publishers rush to buy the young priest's original composition ""Swinging On a Star"" after hearing Bing and his choir of former street kids sing it as a lark.  It's hokum, of course, but it's almost guaranteed to make viewers nostalgic for a more innocent era--even if it's one before their own time.
HOLIDAY INN is a reminder that self-reflexive musicals were almost an established sub-genre from the early 40s on.  It's a show-biz tale which turns into your definitive movie-within-a-movie by the end of the film.  The show biz format is a little bow to realism (no bursting into song while walking down the street, or scaling a mountain).  It's also a tacit admission of Hollywood's self-involvement (the assumption that everyone finds show biz tales utterly fascinating) and, simultaneously, a reaffirmation of mainstream (non-showbiz) values.  Distancing themselves from Hollywood and Broadway phoniness is the only way that Bing and his lady love Marjorie Reynolds can find true happiness--of course they still get to stage elaborate floor shows in their Holiday Inn, so ultimately, it's the best of both worlds.
Both movies have plenty of charm, and, as I say, reflect an innocence we seem to have longsince lost.  It's no wonder that Bing Crosby films, even when they're not explicitly holiday-themed, have become standard holiday fare for many viewers.",1068768000,15,3108,4.777570093457944

First, Holiday Inn... It's been decades since I saw it, so my memory was very foggy. The Kidlet had never seen the movie at all and was a bit, um, well, surprised to see Fred Astaire in that sort of role -- we're used to seeing him as the hero.  Royal Wedding comes to mind as a show were he's just a genuine good-guy. In Holiday Inn he's giving Bing a horrible time what with a pretty girl, and trying to steal her away.  The car scene is a classic -- you'll enjoy it.  All in all, the movie is a nice one, a good story, with WONDERFUL songs.  We enjoyed it.
Going My Way was the one that caused me concern. Other reviewers had mentioned tears, and, well, I just wasn't in the mood for a tear-jerker movie.  WOW, was I ever wrong. It's the most heart-warming, wonderful, nice and terrific show I've seen in practically forever. I'm so glad I got to see it.

1246222,5,B00001TZ6P,"This film is good in so many ways.  The song and dance numbers were all great.  Teaming Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire was a great idea.  These two played off each other so well that I can't imagine two other actors doing so well.  Even Crosby and Hope wouldn't have done as well here.  Marjorie Reynolds was a treat to look at but also had good chemistry with both Crosby and Astaire.  The support cast was equally as good, Walter Abel as Danny Reed, Virginia Dale as Lila Dixon and Louise Beavers as Mamie gave solid performances.
The set was also beautiful.  Obviously the Hollywood set of Holiday Inn at the end of the film that was supposed to be a reproduction of the real Holiday Inn in Connecticut is the same set used for both scenes.  However it is such a realistic set that the viewer never suspects that the Connecticut scenes were filmed indoors.  I think the fact that the film was in black and white helps in that respect.  A color film may have actually looked more phoney.
The story is a simple one but well put together.  I think many viewers can relate to guys trying to steal girls from one another, its a common enough practice today.  The ending is a bit fairy tale like but then that is why so many probably like it.  We get enough ""reality"" in our every day lives.  It is nice to escape reality with a film like this.
Lastly, the black face scene during the Lincoln Day performance is offensive but it does not ruin the film.  Of course a minstrel show today using black face would be unacceptable in today's environment but you can't hold a 1940's film to the same standards.  I know some would like to have that scene removed from the film but I disagree.  I am of African American decent and while I could view this film as a disgrace I accept it for what it is.  Rather than try and obliterate scenes such as this from our film history I think they should be viewed as stepping stones to where African Americans are in film today.  There may still be barriers that need to be broken through in the film world but considering where African Americans started we as a society should also take time to appreciate the accomplishments that have been achieved.  Black face is out.  Demeaning ""yesum"" roles are for the most part gone and now leading roles that portray African Americans in well to do positions in society are becoming more and more frequent.  So while some of the film history regarding African Americans portrays them in a negative manner it is because of those actors and actresses were able to work in those roles and under those conditions that the modern day African American actors and actresses are able be seen in a more positive light.  Ignoring the past roles ignores the actors and actresses that struggled through those times.",1039132800,12,2773,4.4800796812749
