6760816,4,B00OU27QSS,The DVD set arrived quickly in the mail and is easy to use and follow.  I like the way the lessons are taught...clear and easy to understand.  We just need more practice!,1417305600,,170,4.28125
6760817,5,B00OU27QSS,"This DVD set claims that it is ""Designed for beginners, no dance experience is required."" I've never learned how to dance before and I thought that this would something fun to learn. This is a 7 DVD set for Beginner's to learn all the major social ballroom dances. It's quiet easy enough to follow because the instructors tell you step by step each move and dance steps to take. What's great about it is that you can pause and reply any steps you do not get at first. I especially like that you can learn how to dance all different types of dances at your very home which is the most comfortable if you ask me. This is great for anyone who wants to learn ballroom dances on their own without having to go to classes.",1417305600,,716,4.272058823529412

My husband and I found that this system was very easy to use and the directions were also very easy to follow..

6760820,5,B00OU27QSS,"This has been so much fun for my husband and I!  We wanted to take some dance classes before our wedding and like so many things it got pushed to the back burner and never done.  Fast forward and we have a 4 month old baby 2 dogs and a whole lot of no weekly babysitter to cover for dance classes.  Enter the Ballroom Dancing Mastery System,  we have been able to spend time together at home after the baby is asleep learning to dance together and it has been such a joy.  The DVD's are very easy to follow for both of us even though neither of us have a dancing background.  I don't know if we will be winning any competitions any time soon but we will definitely have some moves to show off at some of the weddings we have upcoming in 2015!",1417132800,,742,4.0479452054794525

6760822,5,B00OU27QSS,The Ballroom Dancing Mastery system has been super fun! I received the product a few weeks ago and me and my family started using it together. It has gave us more time and fun as a family and it is super easy to learn. It is actually a good work out as well so you can get fit while you are learning to dance. I never thought learning ballroom dancing would be fun or something i would want to learn but now im thrilled that i received this DVD set.,1416787200,,449,4.0

6760829,5,B00OU27QSS,"My wife and I have been taking private ballroom dance lessons on a once a week (one hour per) since the 2nd week of February.  Those lessons include: waltz, rumba, east coast swing, foxtrot and night club slow dance. I purchased these so we had an easy way to review, refresh and reinforce what we've learned so that we could take greater advantage of those private lessons.  I just received this set of CDs 3 days ago and watched the two waltz CDs yesterday.  I was thrilled, the first CD covered everything we've learned to date and will be extraordinarily helpful.  The second CD looks as though it will cover what we are taught next.  I highly recommend these and will in fact purchase additional CDs from the DanceCrazy series.",1468886400,,732,4.6

6760832,5,B00OU27QSS,"Six basic ballroom dances are explained, demonstrated, broken down into simple manageable steps. Approximately 2-3 hours progressive instruction in each dance is given. Being unable attending beyond one dance class each week renders remembering dance steps virtually unworkable, especially when dance steps become increasingly difficult. Mark Short and Jaimee Simon  produced video provides high quality supplemental dance instruction. This video purchaser is now feeling confident attending dance classes and dance parties, having begun utilizing this dance program video. I can review steps learned in class by examining Jaimee and Mark  video; I feel confident when attending dances because I am not continually requesting dance partners cueing me.  There are some  video spots where audio is momentarily lost. These spots are in video section beginnings.  Momentary lost audio effect is negligible.  Thank you for producing this informative, inspiring, entertaining product.",1467936000,8,978,6.0
6760833,5,B00OU27QSS,I really love this program.  My husband got this for my birthday and we have not been disappointed.  The teachers break down the dances into very basic steps and do alot of repeating.  It is very easy to learn to dance with these DVDs.,1462665600,,235,4.295454545454546

6760838,1,B00OU27QSS,The woman teaching wore a dress so long that when they explained the moves you could not see any of the moves for the ladies. It was ridiculous. The man was better dressed for teaching. I don't think I will buy their dvds again. Bad experience!,1452297600,5,244,4.326086956521739
6760839,5,B00OU27QSS,"Within an hour of following along with one of the DVD's, my partner and I looked like we were pretty good at doing the rumba. Neither of us had any previous dance experience, and are not super coordinated!! It truly is a great experience, and we loved that we were receiving such quality and ""professional"" lessons from our own home. You can't beat the price!",1452297600,2,359,4.538461538461538
6760840,4,B00OU27QSS,"Want to know a secret? I don't like dancing. I'm a Computer Engineer in every sense of the word and lazy on top of it all. That being said; if your wife wants to learn ballroom dancing with you this is a great way to do it.

With 12 hours of instruction we've only skimmed the surface so far but even if we were done I wouldn't be able to judge the accuracy of instruction as the whole reason this works for me is that I'm a beginner. I can comment however on the quality of the instructors and how it is presented. Overall my wife and I liked it. We were interested in the swing portion so I'm speaking from that point of view.

Instruction wise I couldn't ask for anything more. There is a man and woman who start every part out making full use of a skill ad showing what you are working for. They are dancing at full speed too so don't expect to pick this stuff up right from the beginning. They then slow it down so you can better see what each instructor is doing but even here isn't what you should be focusing on. The best part is that each person then shows their steps individually. For instance in the case of Swing the man will show his part and while they are very similar for basic Swing, the woman then shows what amounts to her mirror image steps. Both start out very slow and work you up to full speed before joining again and working up to the end result you saw at the beginning. When we ""Mastered""(need a lot of practice) basic Swing we then moved on to East Coast Swing which is just a modified version of the steps. They use the exact same process here but if you've completed the basics it's easier because it's very similar to what you already learned.

Our only complaint was that what you're watching feels outdated in that the set is in full-screen so if you're watching on any modern wide-screen TV you'll have big black bars on either side. Certainly not HD either. It's not a huge deal because it's still perfectly watchable; as I said the instruction itself was great, but these days you come to expect a certain picture quality and it's the one thing that could be improved. If you just want good instructors to walk you through dance steps at a perfectly reasonable pace(and if for some reason too fast, just pause it) then there is no reason I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. I'm sure my wife will be asking me to take it further and try the other discs now too. I received this product free in exchange for nothing more than my honest opinion.",1451779200,,2481,4.285714285714286

6760852,5,B00OU27QSS,"*I received a copy for review*

DanceCrazys Ballroom Dance Mastery System DVD set provides step-by-step progressive dance lessons, as professional instructors demonstrate detailed instructions. If youd like to emulate the dancers on Dancing with the Stars, this is a fun DVD set to try out. The DVD set covers a variety of ballroom dance styles: featuring 2 Waltz DVDs, 2 Swing DVDs, 2 Rumba DVDs, and 1 Foxtrot DVD. The discs cover over 12 hours of dance instruction. It is currently priced at $47, which doesnt seem bad, considering private ballroom dance lessons aren't cheap. In the past, I have looked for some swing dance lessons on YouTube, but the ones on the DVD were easier to learn from than any I found online. I thought the DVDs were very helpful, and it was easy to follow along the dancers instructions and copy their moves. This is definitely a DVD set that I will be hanging onto!",1448064000,,897,4.713375796178344
6760853,5,B00OU27QSS,perfect for that date night that is kept in the house. This is so fun! me and my husband received this to review for free for exchange for a honest opinion. this is so easy step-by step lesson. i am in love with this. i am now wanting to just use this to spend more time with my husband and to learn something new. thanks so much for such a wonderful experience and fun filled night with my husband.,1447632000,,399,4.063291139240507
6760854,5,B00OU27QSS,"We have been a huge fan of dancing shows in the past but I have never really danced or learned to dance myself. This set gave my wife and I the perfect opportunity to try and learn some steps myself. While we knew that it would not be too easy, we wanted to give it a try for ourselves to see.

This DVD set was great because it had a bit of everything in it. It covered a little of everything and the instruction was easy to understand and even for my wife and I with no dancing instruction we were easily able to follow this.

As mentioned this program has a bit of everything. The set includes:

Beginners Foxtrot - (80 minutes)
Beginners Waltz Vol. 1 - (63 minutes)
Beginners Walts Vol. 2 - (52 minutes)
Beginners Swing Vol. 1 - (111 minutes)
Beginners Swing Vol. 2 - (54 minutes)
Beginners Rumba Vol. 1 - (68 minutes)
Beginners Rumba Vol. 2 - (54 minutes)

As mentioned we have been trying to use this for the past week or so and while I cannot say that we are masters at it yet, we are getting better. Each dance is broken down for you and let me tell you they are truly a workout too!

These disks have been a ton of fun thus far, and my wife and I are looking forward to continuing learning even more as we move forward!

6760855,5,B00OU27QSS,"My husband has two left feet when it comes to dancing.
I have tried my hardest to teach him things but he just don't want to learn
until now! I showed him these dvds and he is all excited to give these a go!

While dancing has always been popular, it has become more mainstream thanks to reality shows like Dancing With The Stars and You Can Think You Can Dance. Now it seems everyone wants to learn to dance like the pros, which isn't easy if you have two left feet.
This is a 7-DVD set totaling 12 hours of dance instruction and covering a wide range of dance styles. The retro styling of the set graphics is a nice light touch that gives you a feel for the 'mood' of the entire set.

Disclosure: This item was sent to me  complimentary for review purposes. However, the opinions expressed are honest and my own.",1447459200,,814,4.2387096774193544
6760856,5,B00OU27QSS,"I got to try these Ballroom Dancing Mastery System (7 DVD Set) and I was excited because I've always wanted to learn, but didn't want to have to go through awkwardness of going to an actual class. The videos are fun to watch and they really break down the steps and make it easy to learn. This 7 disc set teaches you how to do the waltz, swing, rumba, and the foxtrot dances. I used these in my own home and my husband or my son would dance with me. It was a lot of fun. The videos were very clear and high quality and the dancers were obviously professionals and I feel like these really helped. Now I have the confidence to go out and try these dances in public.

6760862,3,B00OU27QSS,"The easy to follow and look at instructors are great combining dance etiquette, technical guidance, and stylish nuance as you learn to dance; however, the sound quality and editing are found greatly wanting.  I didn't understand all the breaks between instruction with repetitive music; the ""close-up"" of feet in lower right-hand corner that showed feet smaller than the main frame was a waste of screen shot; and, having finished watching the first DVD, I felt like I was there as they were filming every take as I saw them saying the same things over and over again.  Again, poorly edited.

The steps are labeled individually & the man & woman's part are shown individually, then shown dancing together & then dancing to music.  There are even some dance sequences shown to let you know how to link the steps together on the dance floor.  I believe you could learn to dance from these without taking classes.

From time to time we would review the DVD's given to us by the instructor, but ultimately, these along with our entire DVD collection was stolen and we have missed them so much. Now, with the help of these new lessons, we are well on our way. I can't imagine a better way to learn than through these amazing DVD's! They are so well made, so thorough and professional. The Foxtrot DVD, for example is broken down into so many specific lessons that it makes learning and practicing easy. There are steps for men as well as women demonstrated by certified teachers. They demonstrate the basic step first and then move slowly to demonstrate variations. I appreciate that the dancers are obviously focused on instructing and not on showing off or performing. Their attitudes and even their dress reflect dedication to the teaching process. There are 7 disks in this set, each one is two hours in length, and each focuses on a different dance technique: Foxtrot, Waltz, Swing, and Rumba.

6760918,4,B00OU27QSS,"My husband and I, senior citizens who never had any dance lessons, purchased these to supplement private and group ballroom dance lessons at the local studio. We haven't been through the entire set, but have found the lessons very helpful.

The instructors are knowledgeable and the instructions are clear. It is useful that each dance step is shown for the leader (male) and follower (female) as well as showing the instructors together and then with music.

The menu lets you choose the dance step and the specific portion of the instruction that you want.

This was a wonderful purchase. Together with the in-person lessons, we are learning. But these DVDs are helping us learn faster. It also allows us to practice correctly--it is not good to practice doing something incorrectly.

I don't think I could learn as much just from the DVDs, but they do go a long way in teaching. If you are someone who catches on quickly, you might learn just from the DVDs.",1431216000,7,960,4.765060240963855

6760923,5,B00OU27QSS,"Jim and I won't be appearing on so you think you can dance anytime soon, or doing any competitive ballroom dancing, but with the dance master set we can clear off the floor, put in a DVD and we are off, suddenly we are Fred and Ginger, okay, more like fred flinstone and ginger rogers horse, but still, this system is a blast! The instruction is well done, easy to follow, and it's really great exercise. It's also a lot of fun and romantic va va voom, holding your partner, maybe these dancers were on to something!

There are 7 DVDs in the set, and the set covers the waltz, rumba, swing dance, and foxtrot! Oh the foxtrot, could be called the sweat trot, while we're having fun, and learning to dance, this is a great workout.

The dances are broken down into steps, we just follow along. No one who isn't a dancer is going to be perfect right away, but a few times and it becomes easier, and while we are stumbling around and rewinding and starting over, it's not intimidating or frustrating because it's fun and fabulous.

The music is great, it doesn't get tiresome with repetition. I wouldn't go to a class and this is perfect for those like me, who want to learn but want to do it in the comfort of home. You do need some space so clear out the middle of the living room or any other room and give it a whirl, literally.

6760930,5,B00OU27QSS,"When I accepted a review sample of this set I was more interested in learning how to better support dancers as a musician than how to dance. What surprised me was how I got drawn into the instruction and had I had a willing partner I would have explored these lessons as a dancer as well.

Since others and the product description over the contents I am going to bypass that and give my own perspective through the lens of a musician.

What I love is how thoroughly the instructors dissect each dance. You are shown each step and movement (and the dance itself) from the lead partners perspective, the following partner, and also with and without music. Moreover, the dances are discussed from the context of social and competitive dancing, and each is vastly different.

The music used was my main interest. It is not strong dance music with a heavy beat, but orchestra fare with a more subtle groove (pulse would be a better word.) For me as a musician (and especially a drummer) this aspect was illuminating. I was able to understand where to place beats and accents to support various dance styles. Especially 3/4 time where the waltz lessons proved to be the most valuable from the entire set.

Basically, I am confident that I can learn some basic moves from this DVD (I was tempted a few times to find a victim, er, volunteer). However, as a musician who normally plays for listening audiences and occasionally for dance groups this set has proven invaluable.",1422662400,,1466,4.648648648648648
6760931,5,B00OU27QSS,"This is a 7-DVD set totaling 12 hours of dance instruction and covering a wide range of dance styles. The retro styling of the set graphics is a nice light touch that gives you a feel for the 'mood' of the entire set.

The two hosts (a man and woman) bring a fun, enjoyable energy, a nice mutual chemistry and very likable personalities to the DVDs...which is important, since you're going to be spending a lot of time with these two people. A lot more time than 12 hours, once you include all the Slow-Motion, Pause and Replay that you'll want to do to fully 'get' the steps.

And that's my best advice for getting maximum benefit from these DVDs...have your DVD player remote control handy. You'll want to Pause, and Replay, a lot. Not because the photography isn't well planned, or because they're going too fast (they're not), but because that's just the easiest way to absorb this material.

My cousin, a former professional dance instructor, borrowed these to give her opinion and she agrees they are excellent. She says it's much harder than people think to demonstrate dance steps on video, and here the dancers, their camera people and the editor/s are all on the same page. My cousin says these are the best dance DVDs she's seen. She likes them so much she plans to borrow them again to help teach her children when they're a bit older.

I like the wide range of styles that are covered, and if you're interested in Latin dance this covers Latin moves especially well.

Sample sent for impartial review. I genuinely like this DVD set...I've viewed other publisher's dance instruction videos in the past and not found those not very user-friendly, but this set is just excellent. I'm not someone for whom structured dance moves come easily, yet I really have learned from this set.
At the current price of $35 for 7 DVDs/12 hours, I think this set is a good value. And if you are planning to take formal classes, viewing these DVDs beforehand will give you a huge head start (and you may find you don't need live classes after all).

The publisher (Ballroom Dancers) offers a number of other dance videos, including a Waltz set, which look interesting as well ( you can see them all by clicking the link at the top of this listing).
I hope this review is helpful as you comparison shop Dance DVD sets online. Happy dancing, everybody.",1422057600,13,2344,4.609112709832134
6760932,5,B00OU27QSS,"I received the Ballroom Dancing Mastery System DVD set in exchange for an honest review.

Dancing is definitely out of my comfort zone. I enjoy it, of course -- that's why I keep doing it. But it can also be intimidating for me whenever I'm in a class setting. I always feel like such an awkward duckling. What this DVD set does for me is help me build up my confidence as I work with the material at my own pace in the privacy and comfort of my own home. The 7-DVD set contains dance lessons for Foxtrot (1 DVD), Waltz (2 DVDs), Swing (2 DVDs), and Rumba (2 DVDs).

The female and male dance instructors/presenters, both nationally certified dance instructors, are very good dancers. They move with such grace and they make the dances look so simple. The general format of the lessons is as follows: 1) breakdown of the footwork of both partners, 2) breakdown of the footwork for the male dancer, 3) breakdown of the footwork for the female dancer, 4) both female and male counterparts performing the dance (set to music).

The DVD lessons are well organized and the ""chapters"" are well delineated. The lessons are easy to follow since each dance step is broken down to very digestible bits. Here are some tips for using this DVD set: Have your TV remote ready as you will almost certainly need to rewind and/or pause parts of the video. Additionally, consider recording your own dance on video so you can play it back to assess your own dance moves.

---
If you're a complete beginner to ballroom dancing, this DVD set will help you build a firm foundation in your footwork. If you're taking dance lessons in a class setting, it will help you overcome the intimidation factor and help you make more profitable use of class time. You'll be better able to follow the dance instructor and feel more at ease. With that newfound confidence, you'll enjoy the class a great deal more than you would otherwise. I know this DVD set has helped me immensely, and I'd highly recommend it for beginners like myself.",1421539200,,2004,4.573816155988858
6760933,5,B00OU27QSS,"This ballroom dancing set is perfect for people like me that have two left feet.

Do not be alarmed if you are not the best dancer, this is the beginner lessons. Be sure not do use this in front of you wife like I did. She is a great dancer, and was I the laugh of the week.

There are four dances to choose from, that will make you a well rounded dancer. The Waltz and Foxtrot are more formal and great for any event. While the Rumba and Swing have more flavor and perfect when you want to add some pizzazz.

After mastering these dance moves, you will become the life of the party. Also, this ballroom dancing cured my two left feet.

I feel like I am very dance challenged so I was very excited to try this set. I started with trying the Waltz vol 1 dvd first. I went to the menu-then scene selection and picked one movement at a time. Once you pick a movement (like The Box Step for example), then you have the options to learn the step with the demo, mens breakdown, womens breakdown, dance men/women together, and dance together with music. The instructors are VERY clear and easy to follow. They show you the steps from a couple angles, as well as the different breakdowns mentioned above.

I even begged my spouse to do it with me. Alas, once it arrived he showed zero interest so I haven't had a partner to work with. :(

BUT, if I did I am 100% certain we'd be kicking these dances into a passable approximation in no time. I've been watching them and learning what I can alone and I'm so impressed with how detailed each lesson is. Whether you want to Waltz or Rumba, Foxtrot or Swing you are sure to learn all of the basics and more. For the price you absolutely cannot beat this set and as long as you've got a willing partner, a bit of space, and a way to play these this is an excellent way to learn.

6761003,5,B00OU27QSS,"I have reviewed a couple other items from DanceCrazy and SalsaCrazy and was glad when I was sent this one to review. I think this is my favorite Dance Crazy instructional set  so far. I gave their Salsa Dance Mastery System and Pilates for Dancers 4 stars as I really enjoyed them but had some small technical, production issues with them. I have no such issues with the Ballroom Dance Mastery System.

The Ballroom Dance Mastery System is a 7 DVD instructional set that teaches fundamentals of Waltz, Swing, Rumba and Foxtrot. The set is well lit and it is easy to see the dancer's movement. I enjoyed the music and costuming of the instructors as well. It works together to give the impression of a lesson in a dancehall. The instruction is clear and detailed. The instructors teach both the lead and follow techniques and roles for each dance style. I think this is an excellent learning resource, practice companion or refresher course. The DVDs are well chaptered and each disk is labelled beginner or intermediate and the type of dance. This makes it easy to find the a section for review and practice.

I highly recommend Ballroom Dance Mastery for anyone who is looking for a ballroom dance instructional DVD series.",1418947200,10,1224,4.737089201877934

6761005,5,B00OU27QSS,"I have always wanted to learn how to dance especially ballroom dance!! I never got the chance to learn when I was younger so I jumped at the chance to review the Ballroom Dance Mastery System DVD Set. Thankfully, my husband was supportive of my desire to ballroom dance so we could do this DVD together. We wanted to take dance lessons but find it hard to do with our schedules.

I decided it would be fun to learn how to Waltz first so I starting watching the Waltz DVD. All I have to say is how well the Waltz DVD (and the other ballroom dance DVDs) are made. They really are made for beginners. The instructors will first show you a basic dance step. Then to make sure you understand how the dance step is done, they show it at different angles. The instructors even take time to show the woman's and the man's steps with different angles. I found it extremely helpful to have segments of the DVD devoted to my dance steps.

The pace of the DVD is nice and slow in order to allow you to fully grasp each dance move. The instructors are excellent, and I found their directions easy to follow. All I can say is how much fun it is to be able to learn how to dance! These DVDs would be a great gift for anyone because they truly can teach anyone how to dance!

This comes with multiple discs to cover various types of dances. I wanted to review this item because my kids are interested in various kinds of dances, but who teaches this any more. If you do find someone who does it's not cheap and they don't usually teach kids. I'm not sure how long my 10 year old will want to sit through one of these, but it is definitely keeping the interest of his 14 year old sister who will use them to learn and then she can help teach him with or without the DVDs.

I myself am no go at dance, but I'm almost understanding it enough that I might jump in and learn with the kids just for fun. I don't know when any of us would ever use the dances as we don't ever go anywhere fancy but it will be an interesting and fun skill for the kids to know!",1418947200,,884,4.017045454545454

6761065,5,B00OU27QSS,"While dancing has always been popular, it has become more mainstream thanks to reality shows like Dancing With The Stars and You Can Think You Can Dance. Now it seems everyone wants to learn to dance like the pros, which isn't easy if you have two left feet (like myself).

Studios have been taking advantage of the dancing popularity by releasing dancing cardio workouts. These programs are great for people that are already fit and have some sort dancing experience, but if you are like me, then you're going to need a program that starts with the basics, so you can learn each move step-by-step.

For the past few weeks, I have been reviewing several ""learn to dance"" DVDs from DanceCrazy.com, including the Ballroom Dance Mastery System 7-disc set. The set includes:

Beginners Foxtrot  - (80 minutes)

Beginners Waltz Vol. 1 - (63 minutes)

Beginners Walts Vol. 2 - (52 minutes)

Beginners Swing Vol. 1 - (111 minutes)

Beginners Swing Vol. 2 - (54 minutes)

Beginners Rumba Vol. 1 - (68 minutes)

Beginners Rumba Vol. 2 - (54 minutes)

You don't need any dancing background before you jump into the Ballroom Dance Mastery System. There are two instructors (a man and a woman) throughout each DVD. Each dance sequence is broke down into steps, which you'll learn each one individually and eventually you'll combine all the steps together. Though it is probably best to have a dancing partner for each dance workout, you can easily do the dancing moves by yourself, which is what I did. Overall, The Ballroom Dance Mastery System is a great way to learn how to dance.

6761082,5,B00OU27QSS,"I was one of the lucky ones that got the offer from Facebook to purchase for $1.00. I thought it couldn't be that great a deal but for $1.00 what did I have to lose. I was pleasantly surprised when I received my Ballroom Dancing Mastery System. It arrived in just a few days. There are 7 DVD's and each one is 2hrs. long. They demonstrate footwork, holds and lots of different steps. It is a really good package for the beginning ballroom dancer. Thank you Dance Crazy for making such a wonderful DVD package.",1418083200,,509,4.368421052631579
6761083,5,B00OU27QSS,"This is the season for giving gifts, and for making new resolutions in your life. I found that this product is a great gift, a great activity, and a great way to work out. So on my holiday list this year is Ballroom Dancing Mastery System from DanceCrazy.

  Ballroom Dancing Mastery System is a step by step progressive dance lesson program. It comes as a seven disc set and each dvd disc is two hours in length. It offers picture in picture so you can see up close the dancers' feet. It helps beginners understand the fundamental concepts of timing and footwork. The Ballroom Dancing Mastery System is over twelve hours of private dance lessons. In this set is two discs of four dances. The four dances in the Ballroom Dancing Mastery System are the Waltz, Swing, Rumba and Foxtrot. DanceCrazy does offer many other dance sets, some just as a single DVD and others as sets.

  We tried out all of these dvds, and by tried out I mean at least watched them, and attempted to do the dance moves. My husband and I come from two completely different dance backgrounds. I have been dancing since the age of three, majored in theater in college, and was a professional ballerina for a dance company. My husband knows music, has rhythm and enthusiasm, but no formal dance training at all, nor not much interest in learning  ballroom dancing. He ended up intrigued to try it out at least.

  Overall we liked the Ballroom Dancing Mastery System (7 DVD Set). I think it is a great value, for only $24.95 you learn four different ballroom dances. Before starting a new dance they give you some brief information about it and I found that interesting, and it helped me to keep in mind what I would look like if I were dancing the dance in the way it was intended.

  The video is very instructional and not flashy at all. It does really make you feel like you are in a private dance class. They even take the time and show you different angles of each step, which both my husband and I found very helpful. They also do each step individually for the man and for the woman. Each DVD has a scene selection which is basically one new step, so you can go at your own pace and learn one step a week if you wanted. As mainly a ballet dancer, I am not the best at ballroom dancing, so learning some of the steps was a little difficult, but they made it very easy to understand which both my husband and I really enjoyed.

  We only found a couple down sides to the videos, mainly the outfits. The Ballroom Mastery System is taught as if it is a serious, private dance class. In a serious, private dance class you would be in a leotard type outfit. Our problem is, in a couple of the dances, they wore very covering and distracting clothing. You could not see their legs or their body form. The man and woman were both guilty of faulty costumes, a simple outfit would have worked fine.

  As a dancer I thought it was fun and a great workout. You have to love dance or want to learn ballroom dancing or you will not like this DVD set. However, both my husband and I did find it fun, informative and a great workout. Our favorite was the Rumba. They had perfectly fit outfits and really explained everything from how to hold your ribcage and hips down to your finger tips.

  Ballroom Dancing Mastery System (7 DVD set) is a great gift for anyone who loves dance or wants to learn to dance. Also, it is great if you are getting married and want to learn to dance at your wedding or a special occasion. It is a fun way to lose weight with your partner in the privacy of your home and at your convenience. It is a great price of $24.95 for all 7 DVDS of Waltz, Swing, Rumba and Foxtrot. Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives Ballroom Dancing Mastery System (7 DVD set) 5 stars!",1418083200,,3757,4.329529243937232
