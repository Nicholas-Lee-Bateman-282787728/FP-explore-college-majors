8450971,5,B00508W3G6,An absolutely wonderful film about a more innocent age Robert Walker was one of our most charming and tragic actors due to the betrayal of his wife Jennifer Jones who left him in order to become a superstar by marrying David O Selznick-  A much older and very powerful producer.  Robert Walker never got over Jennifer Jones Betrayal and it in the end destroyed his life yet he left us with many wonderful performances as for Jennifer Jones one can only say she had to live with herself knowing she married an old man simply to better her career and destroyed Robert Walker for her own selfish gains.  A truly terrible woman,1505606400,,623,4.544642857142857

8450974,5,B00508W3G6,"NEED TO PUT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE?  ROBERT WALKER'S GIFT FOR COMEDY, MOSTLY UNTAPPED BY MGM, SHINES BRILLIANTLY IN THIS WONDERFUL ADAPTION OF MARION HARGROVE'S BOOK COVERING HIS WEEKS OF BOOT CAMP AT FORT BRAGG.  WALKER'S PORTRAYAL IS AS NEAR PERFECT AS YOU CAN GET!  DONNA REED IS HIS LOVE INTEREST, AND IS SWEETER THAN YOU HAVE EVER SEEN HER -- EVEN IN CAPRA'S IAWL CLASSIC.  NEVER CARED MUCH FOR KEENAN WYNN, BUT HE IS PRETTY DARNED GOOD IN THIS EARLY ROLE.  MGM DID A GREAT JOB WITH THIS ONE -- YOU'LL NEVER CATCH IT ON TV, BUT GET YOUR HANDS ON THE DVD, IF YOU CAN -- IT'S A KEEPER!  THIS ONE SHOULD BE IN WIDER DISTRIBUTION!",1369526400,4,629,4.243697478991597
8450975,3,B00508W3G6,"I have always liked Robert Walker's acting.  This movie fell short and did not meet my expectations.  It was definitely not one of his better films.  It reminded me of his character in Since You Went Away, although I did like him in that movie.",1363392000,,244,4.377777777777778
8450976,5,B00508W3G6,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my father who kept asking me if I could find this film on Netflix or at the library for him.  I never could but one day I did find it on Amazon and was so excited.  If My 85 year old dad kept asking for it, it had to hold good memories for him and I was very happy that I was able to find it for him.  The gift really moved him and he's enjoyed watching the film a few times since then.",1355961600,4,421,3.5543478260869565
8450977,5,B00508W3G6,"This is a great movie. I bought it because my dad was in a scene in the movie, and when I bought it I couldn't image how much of a great comedy it is.

Thanks for having this product and for such a great fast service. Will do business with again,",1354320000,4,246,3.823529411764706
