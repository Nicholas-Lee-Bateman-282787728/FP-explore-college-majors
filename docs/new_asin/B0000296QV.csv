7915441,5,B0000296QV,"This would be good for the martial arts fans.
The story is fine but the action is better here.
The combat here is fast and furious.
There is also humor here as well which makes it better.",1355961600,,187,4.081081081081081
7915442,2,B0000296QV,Lots of fighting and explosions here but everything moves a little too fast (undercranking) and the story is nothing special. The DVD is also pretty weak. Donnie Yen fans will probably dig it.,1054684800,,192,4.848484848484849
7915443,3,B0000296QV,"Crystal Hunt was a fairly poor film, perhaps due to lack of budget, but it was none the less an average film that you wouldn't mind renting, which is what I did.
Donnie Yen makes this film and his fights against regulars such as Micheal Woods( whom was the muscular fighter that fought against Donnie Yen on the top of the building at the end of 'In Line of Duty 4') makes this film fairly watchable and merely a collection filler rather than a centre piece of a film collection.",1015286400,2,479,4.333333333333333
7915444,2,B0000296QV,I didn't like this movie much...it has a predictable story to it and bad portrayed fightscenes.....a shame the talented Donnie Yen is in this one......Because his talent is not being showed.....and this movie makes  him look bad,964137600,,228,5.162162162162162

7915446,2,B0000296QV,"3 stars for action, 1 star for everything else. I had a hard time getting into this movie at any point. From the start you can tell that it is a substandard prodution. From the poorest excuse for a plot to the bad voice  overs the entire movie just has a very low budget air about it. Normaly I  don't pay much attention to plot. I've enjoyed many martial arts movies  with less plot, but there something about the way this one is delivered  that makes it less forgiveble here. Maby its the bad background music. Now  if you can get past all that(not to difficult for big martial arts fans)  you can get the important part, the fighting. In this Crystal Hunt does  alright. There are a lot of people fighting in this movie. This kinda'  gives the fighing a bit of uneveness, ranging from WOW to Eh, depending on  who is involved. Donnie Yen is realy an amazing talent and does get a  couple of good fights, but is better seen in the ""Iron Monkey"".  In the end my advice is ,unless you seen everything else out there or have  some special interest in it, you can find something better.",949104000,2,1084,4.311881188118812
