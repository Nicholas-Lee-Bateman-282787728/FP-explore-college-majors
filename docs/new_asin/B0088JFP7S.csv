8526147,3,B0088JFP7S,I feel cheated with this product. When ordering I saw no where it said it was used and the product is defiantly used. The box looks like it had be drug across the ground and then put on a shelf. A number of the discs have at least one scratch on them and one appears to have what looks like a booger stuck to it. If some of the reviews are correct because of the scratches some of the movies will not play because of the quality of the discs. I was really looking forward to owning another 100 movie pack I have 2 other ones. So disappointed.,1488240000,,542,4.027777777777778

8526149,5,B0088JFP7S,"Mill Creek Entertainment Packaged the two 50 packs, Horror Classics & Legends Of Horror, into a ""100 Pack"".  Both of these 50 multi packs contain films ranging from bad to good.  It is well worth the buy though for any movie buff.",1448668800,,230,4.4523809523809526
8526150,5,B0088JFP7S,"Just received my copy and couldn't be happier. As a fan of 30's to 60's B-grade films, I knew this collection was just what I  was looking for. Ahh... the terrible acting, Ahh... the cheap sets & Ahh.. the laughable special effects. I'm in heaven!!! Admittedly, I won't re watch half of them, but hey, at about 20c per movie, I'm still happy as a giant leech (buy it and see). Thanks Amazon",1443484800,,390,4.342465753424658

8526153,5,B0088JFP7S,"this is the greatest collection of classic horror movies. if your a true horror fan and appreciate the genre you will love this collection. bella, price, boris, hitchcock need i say more. these movies set the ground work for the modern horror movies",1378512000,2,249,4.813953488372093
8526154,1,B0088JFP7S,"I received this set as a well-intentioned gift no doubt because it is well-known that I have long been a fan of classic horror films.  The cover boasts pictures of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi and lists Lon Chaney Jr. and other horror pros.  However, before you buy this boxed set, read the fine print - and I mean that literally since the print on the box is close to unreadable it is so tiny.  There is not a single Karloff Frankenstein movie here.  There is not a single Bela Lugosi Dracula movie here.  There is not a single Lon Chaney Jr. Werewolf movie here.  Mostly these are very old, very poorly made and very poorly, if at all, reviewed films from the 30's and 40's which you will never see anywhere because they are so bad, so close to un-watchable, and because NO ONE EVER WATCHES THESE MOVIES!  I guess they call them ""Classics"" just because they are old.  No dice.  In my opinion this is very deceptive.  Yes, there are some Bela Lugosi movies - but ones you have never heard of and will never hear of.  Likewise with Karloff and Chaney.

Hitchcock is renowned less for horror than suspense and mystery, other than maybe Psycho, but Psycho is not here.  For example, the sound quality of Jamaica Inn (1939) - Hitchcock's last film in England before heading to Hollywood - is so bad in parts that I had no idea what was being said.  Besides, this is a horror film?  Pirates and scoundrels luring cargo ships onto rocks, looting the ships and killing the crew?  Oooooh...that is so scary!!!  How Horror-ble!

Hey, if these films appeal to you, be my guest. But I suggest you get a magnifying glass and first read what movies are actually included as ""Classics"" BEFORE you buy.  Perhaps some day they will come in handy in a trivia contest.  But please, just don't call them the GREATEST HORROR CLASSICS because they are not.

Disclaimer:  Notable exceptions to the foregoing are the silents, Nosferatu (with the great Max Schreck) and Phantom of the Opera (Lon Chaney (Sr.).",1368835200,7,1987,4.553672316384181
8526155,2,B0088JFP7S,"The movies are enjoyable, at least the ones I've been able to finish. Some (too many) of them will just stop playing before you can finish watching them. It's just too bad Mill Creek use such cheap discs for these sets! The tiniest scratch could ruin an entire movie. Most of the discs already have tiny scratches due to the packaging they use. I don't know why they use these horrible double sided discs. They don't do it with their 'Fabulous Forties' or 'Nifty Fifties' sets and I haven't had problems with those. It's only these double sided discs that have caused problems. I know you get what you pay for, but I expect the DVDs to at least play properly. I can live with the occasional skip, but not being able to finish a movie is unacceptable!

Edit: I should mention that only one half of this set (the 'Horror Classics' set) is on double-sided discs. The other half ('Legends of Horror') is on single-sided discs, thank heavens!",1358553600,8,937,4.544378698224852
