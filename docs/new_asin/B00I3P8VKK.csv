6248411,1,B00I3P8VKK,"The disk content is enjoyable as were the other two seasons of House of Anubis.
The quality of the video is lacking.
Disks 1 & 4 played fine, but disks 2 & 3 have a record error and play back at a slow frame rate.
This makes some episodes unwatchable. It will literally make you nauseous.
I returned the disks and the replacement disks did the same thing.
Be prepared to skip over some episodes.",1418688000,,395,4.28
6248412,5,B00I3P8VKK,One of the best shows ever! Exciting plot and completely clean. No swearing or inappropriate situations to worry about kids seeing. Addictive. Wish there were more than three seasons.,1415750400,,183,5.344827586206897
6248413,5,B00I3P8VKK,This series is great for children and adults!,1409702400,,45,4.75
6248414,3,B00I3P8VKK,"Sigh... I would have given 5 stars instead of 3 cos of the absences of Nina :(
Thou storyline remains interesting, but it's not the same anymore..Hopefully Fabian still remains in this HOA series. Cos Nina & Fabian are the key actors in this tv series.",1408492800,,252,4.5

8638745,1,B00I3P8VKK,My package arrived damaged.,1491350400,,27,6.0
8638746,3,B00I3P8VKK,"Initially the back of the package says ""Full Screen"" so I was a little worried. However, the worries went away as IT IS actually Widescreen. The quality is amazing as well, almost HD like. However, I noticed on some of the disks, the frame rate is messed up so it looks stutter like. Kind of a shame and Amazon should fix this. But if you are still looking to buy, go ahead if it's cheaper than digital downloads.",1490832000,,413,4.3076923076923075
8638747,5,B00I3P8VKK,"Great series, full of suspense, mystery, intrigue.  Well developed characters you love to root for, and others, love to despise.  Some themes and action may be too scary for young kids.  It is more of a series for anyone over say, eleven years old.",1488326400,,248,4.590909090909091
8638748,5,B00I3P8VKK,"They can make an awesome series even without the main character. But yeah, House of Anubis is not the same without Nina.",1481587200,,120,4.5

8638750,5,B00I3P8VKK,"I bought this whole series for my niece.  I gave her a couple for Christmas, A couple for birthday and then another special occasion completed the set.  She was excited!  She had got into the series when she started watching them on You Tube.  She was happy that she was able to see them on her tv and finally had closure.  My niece is 13 now and she is very happy with this and the rest of the set!  I would probably even watch these myself!  As far as a review of the actual show, it all depends upon your own taste.",1464220800,,518,4.019607843137255
8638751,4,B00I3P8VKK,I only give it 4 stars because I'm mad Nina and Amber left the show this season. But my kids and I LOVE this series. It's fascinating and keeps you dying to know what's going to happen.,1455321600,,185,4.027027027027027
