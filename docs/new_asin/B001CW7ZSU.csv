3520394,4,B001CW7ZSU,"This gallic oeuvre policier it's a universe of its own. The viewer dives in an ocean where space-time is determined by risk and decision making. Cities and places are eclipsed by the presence of Gu, Manouche & company. They live in a story of crime and revenge created by Jose Giovanni via the atmospheric world of masculinity and camaraderie that has been given shape by the visual mind of Melville. Lino Ventura larger than life, powerful, existential.",1238371200,2,454,4.909090909090909
3520395,5,B001CW7ZSU,"This film is another brilliant chapter in one of the most unique, fascinating filmmakers that the country of France ever produced.  It's a very leisurely film, running 2 1/2 hours, yet it's never boring, and that isn't one wasted frame in the whole thing.  It's a very exciting film, because unlike most Hollywood films, you usually can guess who's going to live and who's going to die (the stars in Hollywood films rarely ever die, and if they do, they choreograph it so you know ahead of time).  The film has excellent characterisations that feel like real people, not just gangsters (in reality, the characters here are thieves, not the modern ""gangster"").  The performances are brilliantly understated and very memorable (Melville, for all his visual style, was a great director of actors).  When you watch this film, you see the homages (or rip offs) that many modern films take from Melville.  The final shootout is reminiscent of the shootout in Reservoir Dogs, and the loyalty and moral codes of the thieves is reminiscent of John Woo's work (Woo has acknowledged Melville as a huge influence).  But Woo (and especially Tarantino, whose work can be fun but is very shallow) doesn't capture the milleu of these men that Melville does, they don't have his style, and they don't write the great dialogue that Melville does.  Woo does action sequences much more elaborate than Melville does (Woo is a master at action sequences), but he misses a lot underneath the surface, whereas Melville is all under the surface.  Le Deuxieme Souffle is a sad, haunting, cynical, yet tender film, a film that is downbeat but doesn't enjoy showing you its sadness and cynicism (like a lot of modern day filmmakers do).

I have seen many Melville films (this one, Le Cercle Rouge, Army of Shadows, Le Samourai), and they are all amazing.  This is one of his most memorable works.",1236816000,2,1868,4.8427672955974845
3520396,5,B001CW7ZSU,"One of the chief merits of this film is having Lino Ventura as star instead of the more glamorous Belmondo or Delon (Melville's typical choices). Ventura has no veneer. His hangdog face and stocky body give an authenticity and grittiness to it -- even in the midst of the usual Melville iconography of trenchcoats, American cars, and jazz. And, unlike the other two actors, he naturally embodies the fatalism that's a vital part to this story.

This is probably my favorite of Melville's gangster films. It's a study of loyalties (based on a novel by Jos Giovanni) and it has more depth than his other gangster films. Best of all, it has characters that are intelligent and capable -- forcing them to engage in battles of wits before they can engage in gunplay.

There's Blot, the Police Inspector (personified by Paul Meurisse), who possesses a Sherlock Holmesian cleverness. There's the mysterious Orloff (Pierre Zimmer) whose quiet skill seems to be a precursor to Alain Delon's role in Melville's next movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LE-SAMOURA/dp/B000AQKUG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LE SAMOURA</a>. And even Manouche (Christine Fabrega) is proactive altho her primary purpose is to provide an emotional center for the film.

There are many tense, engrossing episodes in this 2 hr 10 min film which make the slow spots that bridge them seem less like slow spots.

My thanks to Criterion for making this fine film available. That makes 11 Jean-Pierre Melville films that I've seen. 3 to go.

The Criterion DVD has a detailed film commentary by Melville expert Ginette Vincendeau and British film critic Geoff Andrew. Bertrand Tavernier speaks in English of his experiences with Melville. And there's a short piece made on Melville at the time of this film's production.",1225584000,12,1824,5.363636363636363
3520397,5,B001CW7ZSU,"Film noir master Jean-Pierre Melville's 1966 2 hr. and 24 min. mob epic has everything you want to see in a Melville film: a prison escape sequence, gangland violence, cool jazz clubs with leggy blondes, Colt .45's, fedoras, crime bosses putting together crews to pull off big jobs (in this case 1 billion in platinum bars), an intricately planned and executed heist sequence, stakeouts, hideouts, double-crosses, betrayals, brutal interrogations involving torture, revenge, and, most importantly, memorable characters (on both sides of the law) who live by their own private codes.

Its very hard to imagine what the careers of Coppola, Scorsese, Friedkin, Woo, and Tarantino (to name just a handful of Melville's progeny) would be were it not for the hard-hitting but cool film noirs of Melville who provided the archetypes and templates for virtually every mob film to follow. But the pleasures of Melville's films are many and no single filmaker that followed Melville into this genre (that he didn't invent but that he certainly elevated) exercises his craft with as sure a hand and with as much integrity as Melville himself. This is due to the fact that Melville brought to the highly formulaic genre of film noir his experience as a resistance fighter in WWII and so when he puts together a murder sequence, an interrogation sequence, or any number of sequences involving men doing battle with their conscience and with each other there is a realism (albeit a highly stylized realism) and an authenticity that is anything but formulaic. His imitators have made great films which can be appreciated and celebrated for their own specific merits, but no other filmaker seems to own this genre and the characters that inhabit it the way Melville does.

 In the opening sequence Gustave ""Gu"" Minda (Lino Ventura: who looks like a cross between Fellini at 65 & DeNiro at 45) breaks out of prison with the help of two accomplices. Though a mere 46, ""Gu"" seems old like an old man who can barely muster the energy or will to scale the last wall. The stark austerity of the prison with its formidable concrete walls that stretch high into the sky is like a huge and dehumanizing labyrinth of stone and living within these walls for so many years seems to have taken the life out of him and aged him well beyond his years. One of the younger men dies when he falls from one of the walls. Once freed, the other two flee into the woods and jump on to a moving train. Its a thrilling beginning, and we are holding our breath the whole way. Throughout the sequence all we hear are the sounds of the men busily working to accomplish each task necessary to free themselves, and then, once outside the prison, all we hear are the sounds of their newly liberated feet crunching leaves on the forest floor. We feel their exhileration. The entire sequence is like a highly condensed version of Bresson's A Man Escaped. And all before the opening credits roll.

With this first masterful sequence we know immediately that we have been delivered into the hands of a master cinematic craftsman. At 2 and a half hours we know its going to be a long ride but we also know that there's no better director to spend 2 and half hours with.

I bought this film along with Le Doulos. I watched Le Doulos first, and, although enjoyable, it was fairly slight. Le Doulos is an appealing jazz duet featuring two thinly-imagined players for the most part and a clever  and well-executed plot but overall the film didn't pack much of a punch compared to the one delivered by this fully realized jazz symphony which features a cast of twelve fully realized players who are all given considerable screen attention and a labyrinthine plot that puts these lives into contact with each other in extremely compelling, and, more often than not, deadly ways.

The fate of the other escapee eventually does figure into the story and in a profound way, but this is Gu's story. Once he finds his way back to Paris he immediately seeks out his sister Sophie Manouche. In our first glimpse of Manouche we learn that she runs a club and while shes talking to her business partner, Jacques the Lawyer, at the clubs bar three thugs rush in and start shooting up the place. Manouche's bodyguard, Alban, squeezes off a few expertly placed shots to fend them off but not before Jacques takes a bellyful of lead. This brings Inspector Bloc (Paul Meurisse, who will later appear in Melville's masterpiece Army of Shadows) onto the scene. When Bloc begins asking questions no one's talking, but Bloc is a cool inspector who knows how to read men as well as evidence and he knows exactly what happened, who did it, and why.

Bloc knows everyone, and he understands the code of silence that governs the underworld. He also knows how these characters operate, their signature moves, as well as what they will do before they do it. Gu may be the most notorious underworld criminal of his day and his name may command immediate respect, but Bloc's name is equally respected and equally feared. We know that it is only a matter of time until these two face off. That is unless the unscrupulous Inspector Fardiano (who is not so respectful of the thieves'--or any other--code of honor) doesn't catch up with Gu first.

Meanwhile, Paul Ricci is busy putting together a team in order to pull off a major heist. Paul Ricci is acting on a tip from ""Nevada"" (an old-timer who wears dark shades and a stetson and drives a huge black cadillac, all Melville signatures) who has the inside scoop on exactly when and where an armored truck will be moving 1 billion in platinum. Paul belongs to the higher class of gangster (the kind who live by an unspoken code of honor) but Paul's brother Jo belongs to the lower class of gangster (the kind who don't). Paul recruits Antoine the Gypsy and Pascal and for a fourth he attempts to hire a cool blonde pro named Orloff who is the very model of the independent consummate professional that Melville would focus on in his next film, Le Samourai. When Orloff hears that two motorcycle cops must be dispatched he decides the job is too risky. Knowing that Gu needs a big score quick so that he can elude the everpresent Bloc and disappear once and for all to Miami, Orloff passes the job on to him. Neither Orloff nor Gu trust Paul or his crew but Gu has no choice but to take the job.

As you would expect, the heist sequence, which takes place high in the mountains, is exquisitely choreographed and exquisitely shot by Melville. But, as masterful as this sequence is, its only one of several exquisite scenes in this impressive film.

Highly recommended.

DVD extras: Includes archival footage of Jean-Pierre Melville (wearing dark shades) flanked by Lino Ventura and Paul Meurisse sitting at a bar together and answering questions about Le Deuxieme Souffle for a French television program. The interview lasts a mere three minutes but its very cool to see and hear Melville speak about the crime genre not getting the respect it deserves from the French and to hear Ventura and Meurisse discuss their parts.",1223510400,26,7086,4.710250201775626
8290209,5,B001CW7ZSU,"Arrived well-packaged and ahead of time.  Great vendor.

This is Lino Ventura at his very best, a complicated, nuanced tough guy. Excellent screenplay.  Suspenseful story line. A print worth owning.",1480982400,,198,5.533333333333333
8290210,5,B001CW7ZSU,"This a great crime film. I bought and watched this after viewing Le Samourai, and like it equally well. I would also like to own The Red Circle but the price is prohibitive.",1461110400,,173,4.2727272727272725
8290211,5,B001CW7ZSU,"This is easily one on Jean Pierre Melville's best movies. The tension between Gu and his accomplices, as well as his love interest and the clever detectives makes this very enjoyable to watch and reminds us that we sometimes only need to go to the origins of things to enjoy them. French crime drama/thrillers are amazing as an entire genre, but this and Le Samourai take the cake.",1438300800,,381,4.617647058823529
8290212,5,B001CW7ZSU,"An elegant gangster classic.  Tough, enigmatic, beautifully observed.  Crime films, foreign or otherwise, don't get much better.  The story is even more poignant when one considers Melville's own history, including his time in the French resistance, where loyalty and one's reputation thereof meant everything.",1428278400,,310,6.0
8290213,4,B001CW7ZSU,"This movie is a film noir character study about Gu, a master heist thief, who escapes from prison and works his way back into the business so he can support himself and his lover. Lino Ventura, the great introspective Italian actor, plays Gu.

Gu is being chased by a brilliant police detective, (played by Paul Meurisse, who shows great range here,) The two men will stop at nothing to achieve their ends: Gu, to clear his name when a heist goes wrong, and the Inspector, who must catch his man at all costs.

This movie is multi-layered and features a large amount of supporting characters. At nearly 2 and a half hours, it drags a little bit in spots. I would have liked Melville to develop the relationship between the inspector and Gu more. However, the heist scene is really well-shot, as are the gunplay scenes.",1400112000,,818,4.595890410958904
8290214,5,B001CW7ZSU,"If you have not seen any of Jean- Pierre Melville's films, you are likely to find out quickly whether you enjoy them. His gangster related films are not quickly paced and the story often unfolds in a leisurely way. I find this a welcome antidote to the modern way of making most films we see. I have most of his films on DVD now - BOB LE FLAMBEUR, LE CERCLE ROUGE, LE SAMOURAI, UN FLIC, LE DOULOS and now the above title. I enjoy all of them for the actors, the characterisations and also the settings and overall signature tone of the films.

I recommend this film in particular as it has a commentary from one of the foremost Melville experts, so once you have watched the film you can enjoy it again from another perspective.

I hope you discover and enjoy it as I have.",1285113600,3,773,4.287671232876712

8290216,5,B001CW7ZSU,"This is another classic French film noire starring Lino Ventura.  Being a film noire, things end badly.",1258416000,,103,5.0588235294117645
8290217,3,B001CW7ZSU,"Jean-Pierre Melville's adaptation of Jos Giovanni's Deuxieme Souffle is a classic example of a good story badly told. Running two-and-a-half hours and feeling even longer at times, this story of Lino Ventura's escaped convict getting disastrously mixed up in the proverbial one last job to set him up with enough money to escape to Sicily is not exactly a model of narrative economy as the exposition heavy first two hours are filled with characters speculating at length on scenes we've just seen without ever shining any new light on them. Initially this works surprisingly well as Paul Meurisse's casually brilliant been-there, done-that cop, the real star of the show, explains exactly the story various witnesses will tell at a crime scene for them to save the trouble of interrogating them, but increasingly it just becomes repetitive and slows the picture down to a surprisingly dull crawl. It's not until the last quarter that the film finally threatens to kick start into life as Ventura is tricked into revealing the identity of one of his cohorts and tries desperately to prove that he's no stoolpigeon with both the cops and the gang after his blood. His obsession proving that he's not a collaborator certainly may have had some wartime resonance for a French audience, but more up to date references were left on the cutting from floor thanks to the notorious French censor cuts that saw a police torture scene cut to almost incomprehensibility to remove shots of a suspect being force fed water, a favorite torture technique of the French paratroops and police in Algeria.

That the film's most notorious scene isn't actually in the picture any more is telling for a film that plays better in the memory than while you're actually watching it. While there are occasional hints of Melville's better pictures - those omnipresent trenchcoats and hats, the opening prison break played out in silence, a railway station shot anticipating one in L'Armee des Ombres - it's a distinctly minor film padded out to an epic length it never justifies. There are the odd moments that intrigue, such as one character rehearsing the ways a meeting can go wrong to know where to stash hidden weapons only for one of the hoods he's meeting to do exactly the same thing, but they rarely pay off, while the characters on the wrong side of the law are never quite iconic enough to carry the film over the rough patches. Only Pierre Zimmer's Orloff is particularly admirable, but he's more a facilitator than a protagonist, accurately described by one character, as ""all style, no action."" While the line might seem a suitable description for Melville, the film isn't that stylish either: with no Henri Decae or Nicholas Hayer behind the lens this time (Marcel Combes was the cinematographer) it often looks no better than the average French polar of the era. It's the kind of film that could certainly benefit from a good remake with a tighter script, though whether the recent Daniel Auteuil version is an improvement remains to be seen.

Criterion's Region 1 NTSC DVD offers a fine transfer with a good selection of extras.",1255219200,4,3119,4.90530303030303
8290218,3,B001CW7ZSU,"I'm a big fan of Melville's work but this is not his best.  It's dragged down by too many wasted frames where nothing happens cinematographically or thematically and by the poor acting of his leading lady, Christine Fabrga.  Le Circle Rouge and Le Samourai are much better.",1249689600,3,273,4.787234042553192
