7986406,1,B00008RCOT,My delivery was in the middle of the street two blocks away from my address. A friend brought it to me,1403740800,,102,3.9047619047619047
7986407,3,B00008RCOT,"I bought this DVD thinking it was a cartoonish type lesson for my 4 year old daughter. I based that assumption purely by viewing the cover art. I set out to find a cartoonish video because my daughter keeps her attention better to those.
I was wrong. Its a man and child showing how to play the guitar. Overall, its not a bad instructional video but for my 4 year old its just too confusing.
I bought a piano DVD along the same lines and its wonderful. I wish I could find one that teaches guitar like that.",1231372800,4,507,4.183673469387755
