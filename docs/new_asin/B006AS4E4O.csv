8495832,5,B006AS4E4O,"It seems like the majority of Amazon UK reviewers have made the connection between This is Jinsy and any number of British Comedy predecessors.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-League-Of-Gentlemen/dp/B00083D4G6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The League Of Gentlemen</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monty-Python/dp/B008H120CU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monty Python</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spike-Milligan/dp/B0001MIQ8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spike Milligan</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Britain/dp/B000IJ7GWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Britain</a>. It hardly seems fair that this piece of surrealist comedy gold should only be defined by the legendary exponents who have preceded it. But, on the other hand, it is inescapable that Jinsy should be compared in that way. It follows a long tradition of British silliness, complex, madcap, whimsical, surreal and, quite probably, incomprehensible to Johnny Foreigner. You'll also find a liberal dose of Wodehouse (whom I've never read, but TiJ just /feels/ Wodehousian), Reeves & Mortimer (ditto),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fast-Show/dp/B000VA3JAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fast Show</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Train/dp/B0001MIQ80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Train</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Look-Around-You/dp/B0000AISIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Look Around You</a>... and I could go on.

If any of those shows appeal to you, then the strange lives of Arbiter Maven, his long suffering (and strangely normal) assistant Sporral and of the catastrophically inbred islanders that they administer will tickle your fancy. The tesselator-delivered entertainment that quiets the masses (all 571 of them) will set you chuckling (it had me crying with laughter in places) such as; Sandy's Choice (a sort of Jinsy's Got Talent, but with a dog, instead of Simon Cowell - a huge improvement if you ask me), PamEric (a Regency Melodrama that would have set Jane Austen weeping with despair), and Punisment Roundup (in which a disturbingly attractive dragged-up Harry Hill administers ""mild electricals"" to the island's recidivists - ""So that's not good..."") and The Wedding Lottery (whereby Jinsy's porridge-like gene pool is stirred).

Like so many good shows, comedy or otherwise, much value is added by the weekly celebrity cameo, so look for David Tennent, Catherine Tate, Jane Horrocks, Simon Callow, Kevin Eldon, Don Warrington, Nigel Planer, Peter Serafinowicz and Brian Murphy.

This is inspired stuff. Inspired by the genius of others, as has been noted, but truly inspired nonetheless. I would like to think that, one day, it will sit alongside them rather than beneath them, It also has the taste of Marmite as another reviewer has pointed out, so take a look on YouTube before you buy.",1393545600,2,3087,7.383152173913044
8495833,5,B006AS4E4O,"This is Jinsy is the most creative, unique and inventive show ever seen on tv -- in Britain or America!  Everything about the show is entertaining:  the surreal, witty banter, the funny songs, the throwback fashions and the off-beat comedy.  I can't wait for a Region 1 DVD to be issued... and for Series 2, also!",1392422400,,313,4.553571428571429
