8229153,4,B000XPZSAO,"Natalie (Chase Masterson) buys a photograph at a yard sale under somewhat unusual circumstances. The woman hosting the yard sale is only selling the photograph for a friend and is willing to part with it for a dollar. Natalie eagerly snaps up the bargain and takes the picture--of a woman partially behind a tree--home. Something about the picture clearly captivates her. Before long, it terrifies her.

After getting the picture home, Natalie realizes that the woman in the photograph seems to have moved. Moreover, Natalie begins to hear voices and has a vivid dream about the woman.

""Eye of the Beholder"" is a very nicely made independent film that does quite a bit with its twelve minutes. The acting is generally good, and the story is involving. One problem, though, was that the picture shook frequently. I'd have thought that perhaps the problem was in my particular DVD copy, but I noticed that the shaking of the picture seemed to correlate highly with actual camera movement. Still, as the movie is only twelve minutes long, the shaking does not really become too annoying, and the story itself is sufficiently involving to make me, at least, overlook the technical difficulties.",1198368000,2,1191,4.9798994974874375
