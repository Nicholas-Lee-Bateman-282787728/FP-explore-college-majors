3714480,5,6304098162,"Intriguing plot with enough suspense and action to keep you immersed into the story. It's an old film but I think it is done right with good acting from actors and actress, good directing and cinematography as well. Very well recommended!",1369180800,2,238,4.829268292682927

3714486,3,6304098162,"It was interesting. It was like an American James Bond with a lower budget, but not as good looking and built babes as Bond had.",1461196800,,128,4.16
3714487,4,6304098162,"i loved the plane flying scenes to elude capture close to the groung through canyons, the acting was good too",1446336000,,109,4.5
3714488,3,6304098162,Robert Davi action hero?  Bad guy roles work better for him.,1444867200,,60,4.454545454545454
3714489,1,6304098162,it starts out badly and gets worse. Robert Davi is a competent actor but with no script there's nothing can be done. Disjointed and the flying scenes are ludicrous. It was about 88 minutes too long.,1430956800,,198,4.527777777777778

8324120,3,6304098162,"They have changed the name.  Apparently they do not know Shakespeare ... or do not realize that the opposite of ""A rose by any other name ..."" is also applicable.

Alexander Godunov, the bad guy of ""Die Hard"" and a Russian defector(1979), must have died before the final scenes of this movie could be completed so along with the switching planes in the middle of 'dogfights', the overly obvious manakin used as a burning prop, contradictory scenes and incomplete dialogues one gets to watch some other actor complete the film.

Notably the flight scenes at the beginning are all (bad) edits from the Iron Eagle movie which is about the same class movie. People familiar with jets, especially the F-16, will enjoy some parts but do double-takes when the plane switches to another jet(note the lack of vertical fins). The small amount of gratuitous nudity and the strangeness of it(it does not fit) does not help the movie ...perhaps it was shot after the film was completed.

It's a grade C for me, and not one I would want to watch again.  If one truly has nothing else to do, it is tolerable... once.",1490400000,,1101,4.654639175257732
8324121,2,6304098162,Okay B movie if you really want to watch something in action genre. Runs out of steam after the opening plane chase. Ho hum plot and cinematography after opening.,1484697600,,162,4.620689655172414
8324122,1,6304098162,I could make a better story line. The acting was not professionally done.,1482710400,,73,4.6923076923076925

8324126,3,6304098162,Good acting saved this tired meme. Since all the actors have enjoyed great careers as character actors it felt like something of an actor's studio to me. I think a true A-lister would not have made this a better film.,1475712000,,217,4.45
