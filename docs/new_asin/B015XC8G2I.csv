7453338,3,B015XC8G2I,"Growing Pains: The Complete Sixth Season contains all 24 episodes of the shows 1990-1991 season. Mike (Kirk Cameron) and Carol (Tracey Gold) move to New York City to be roommates, an arrangement that doesnt go very well. Ben (Jeremy Miller) struggles with life lessons about the true rewards of high school vanities, and Chrissy (Ashley Johnson) has all she can do just to get noticed by her busy family.

Growing Pains was one of most successful family sit-coms of the 80s-90s era. The father, Dr. Jason Seaver (Alan Thicke), was a psychiatrist who had moved his office into his suburban New York home when wife Maggie (Joanna Kerns) went back to work, in order to keep an eye on the kids. When the show began. Mike was a young teenager more interested in having a good time than in responsibility. Carol was his brainy sister, and Ben their young brother who had a knack for getting into innocent trouble. From time to time, the show dealt with serious issues, such as drunk driving, teen suicide, racism, and peer pressure on Mike to use cocaine. Parents Jason and Maggie, like Jim and Margaret Anderson (Father Knows Best) before them, saw their kids through crises large and small.

As the series progressed and the characters developed, Mike graduated from high school, enrolled in a local college, worked odd jobs, tried acting for a while, and had one attractive girlfriend after another. He later taught remedial education, for college credit, at an inner-city school. For a time, Cameron was a teen heartthrob, his picture on the covers of countless teen magazines, who received 10,000 letters a month.

The unrated, color Season 6 episodes are available in a 3-DVD set.",1450224000,,1680,4.8671328671328675

7453342,5,B015XC8G2I,"No idea why the reviews aren't 100 percent across the board. This set is packed with 3 discs that have all of the very memorable episodes of the sixth season. The quality of the episodes is not half bad. It's definitely not high definition but that's the point-it's an 80s sitcom. Too good! Only one more season needs to be released and then every season is out on DVD. To make sure that happens, please by the DVD set through Amazon and not the independent sellers!",1447200000,3,466,4.430232558139535
