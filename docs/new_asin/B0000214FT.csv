7915273,5,B0000214FT,"Movies like this, which don't fall into the big budget release category, are a genre unto themselves.  This is not your typical, slick buckets-of-blood Hollywood horror thriller.  There's a wonderful sense of intimacy and as one reviewer has noted, real craftsmanship about this rather scarey movie.  It has a charm of its own.  It also has a memorable film score by John Massari, a wonderful composer who deserves much more critical acclaim.  The score is understated and subtle, rather than a lot of overdone, in-your-face movie soundtracks.  It draws you in and keeps you riveted; it complements this little gem of a film.",1127001600,,625,5.019417475728155
7915274,4,B0000214FT,"No gore here! It's largely bloodless -  but I'm a huge fan of this horror series and I enjoyed Retro Puppet Master. It's ""quaint"" and I know many Puppet fans and gore-hounds won't like it but the ""fairy tale"" quality of this one won me over. Guy Rolfe tells the tale of how once upon a time the young Toulon was granted the magic to bring his puppets to life. This is such a charming little movie that some horror fans will love it and others will hate it. I love all types of horror movies (including the bloodier early Puppet Masters) and I *loved* this one.",1101168000,,560,4.233644859813084
7915275,1,B0000214FT,"I remember fondly renting the originals in the Puppet Master series when I was younger--now, years later available on DVD I was intrigued by this ""new"" entry in the series. Wow...what a major dissapointment! This movie is terrible...let me qualify myself by saying that I enjoy bad films, Plan 9, Astro Zombies, bad horror, etc. but his movie is BORING! They spent all their time on a boring melodrama about Toulon as a young guy. The actor who plays him is a boring, ""pretty-boy"" whose french accent makes you want to string him up and make him dance! The only good thing about this movie is the hot chick.... The puppets look awesome but no CGI or stop-motion from David Alan just boring real puppet action which is fine for a 5-year old but these things are supposed to be alive. Please don't waste one dime on this one, if you're curious like I was simply rent the VHS.  Be warned!",997056000,4,885,4.496894409937888
7915276,3,B0000214FT,"I'd agree with one of the previous reviews that says this film has an old-style (read 1930s Universal) horror movie feel to it. (Though I think ""Retro Puppet Master"" is a stupid title)  There is really no blood and gore and little violence, but still the movie manages to be quite atmospheric, thanks in large part to the Rumanian filming location.  The puppet designs are very interesting and creepy and fit the time period well.
The big flaw here is the lack of stop-motion animation.  The effects are sometimes laughably bad (look for Retro Pinhead ""running""), as the puppets are obviously being moved around like marionettes, or being manipulated as rod puppets.  The animators even admit that they didn't have the budget to do stop motion in the behind-the-scenes featurette.  The ""effects"" seen in this movie could be done at home by anyone with a puppet, some strings, and a few sticks...
Stop motion, even when done badly, gives an otherworldly and disturbing feel that this film needed.  It would have been 100% better with stop motion.  I hope Full Moon uses these ""Retro"" puppets again, but I sincerely hope they hire some stop motion animators next time around to do their quirky material justice.",975369600,,1209,4.868292682926829
7915277,5,B0000214FT,"It's not very easy to do a prequel movie,(ask George Lucas), so I was very surprised that Full Moon was able to pull this off.  I tip my hat to Charles Band.  This movie delivers.  As for the DVD itself, no surprise  that Full Moon gives you your money's worth.  The behind the scenes  features in the Video Zone make all these DVDs so much better.  The major  studios need to wake up and realize movie fans desire these  ""little"" extras.  Finally, these new retro puppets are cool!",959558400,,482,4.375
7915278,1,B0000214FT,"I HAVE SEEN ALL THE PUPPET MASTER MOVIES AND LOVED EVERYONE OF THEM, BUT I HAVE TO SAY RETRO PUPPET MASTER WAS HORRIBLE. I WAITED 4 MONTHS TO SEE THIS MOVIE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE. SURE THEY GET THE STORY  ACROSS, BUT I LIKE TO SEE SOME KILLING AND ACTION. THIS MOVIE SUCKED. RENT  IT, DONT BUY IT.",955843200,,313,4.032258064516129
7915279,3,B0000214FT,"If you love the traditional Puppet Master movies and their adventures. You will love Retro Puppet Master, as you explore the history of the puppets and discover how it all began. However if you have never seen a Puppet  Master movie, Retro Puppet Master will give you a reason to, as you see the  history you will feel a need to explore the great adventures the puppets  have in their other movies.",952041600,,398,4.5
