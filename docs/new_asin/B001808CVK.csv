It is more about the happenings of Lord Ashram and Lady Pirotessa searching for a new beginning with the Marmo people. I for one, was always fascinated by their relationship and was happy to know that the main focus of the story was about Lord Ashram and Pirotessa's a quest to save him from the evil God King Barbas, and his diabolical pact to take possession over his body. Another interesting note was how the neutral gods sealed their souls inside the bodies of animals to escape the war between the goddesses Marfa and Kardis (was glad to know that there we other gods besides them). Since each god is represented in animal form, their people also have the ability to turn into that type of creature as well: cool.  No, the animation style as nothing to do with the Record of Loddoss War look but it didn't matter to me, I enjoyed this style very much being it was more dark and gritty. I also enjoyed the acting, Raydon's voice was very emotional and showed how much he cared for his friends; well played I say. Obier was too cool for school with his smokey demeanor and I loved Lady Adirecia for her subtleness. As for the rest of the character voices? I enjoyed them as well.

I believe Crystania was meant to break away from the whole Record series in a very abrupt way and I am thankful for that. I always liked Ashram and Pirotessa a little more than I did Deelit and Parn anyway. Ashram and Piro's relationship always seemed on the edge of being romantic yet always kept a distance because of their reputations. I am happy to know that Crystania allowed the relationship to finally break free from that restraint due to Pirotessa's undying love for him and Ashram's affection toward her faithfulness.

The only negative of the anime were the gaps in the story and the ending.

*SPOLIER*

I was a little disappointed when Pirotessa was finally able to free Lord Ashram form the Chaos Realm (and Barbas's hold) and he didn't even wake up. That made me a little sad as she had been waiting for him for 300 years! C'mon, at least let the guy awaken and allow them to embrace. They have been in love for centuries and yet the writers weren't proficient enough to allow a little affection between one of the most important characters of Lodoss War/Crystania? That was a bit of a let down. He should have awoken and finally ruled the people alongside Pirotessa as his queen with a couple of children on the side. *Sigh*

Also, what is with the cover of the movie/OVA series and the guy with white hair???? I tried to look for information on this cover art and only found it on a French and German anime fan blog but with no luck from any of sites giving me a scratch of information (Eh, I don't speak either language anyway!)

So, to sum things up, I truly enjoyed and loved this anime. I wish I could have given it 5/5 but there were too many gaps in the story. Yes, I am a die-hard fan of the both Lodoss War and Record of Lodoss War but I am completely aware that this was a different story with different characters who had different struggles so PLEASE, I beg you, don't make the mistake of comparing or judging it the way you would the prior franchise. Just appreciate it for what it is; a new beginning. :)",1408060800,3,3305,4.381729200652528

If you like Record of Lodoss War, then buy this.  its reminiscent of that",1395964800,,247,4.4222222222222225
8267981,4,B001808CVK,"Okay, maybe if you are about 15 years old you might get caught up in the drama and the magic of the story. But incase you feel to smart or cynical for that do consider this a ""so bad its good"" experience.

Just remember (SPOILERS), a majority of this story was not written, it was played out. This is a Not-a-sequal version of Record of Loddoss wars that basically transcribes a DnD game between a few friends. It shows in the first movie in the set as we get this large collection of characters gathered together for a big backstory opening that has nothing to do with the rest of the film. Roughly, it is on par with having Batman Begins and at the moment Bruce wayne puts on the mask he is sucked up by a twister and taken to the land of OZ. Nothing he did had anything to do with what is going to happen, he is both underqualified and overqualified for the story ahead, and it is up to a side character who gets almost no screentime to save they day..........which only makes sense if you watch record of lodoss wars.

The rest of the OVA series is a MUST SEE fan-fictiony parade of every character doing everything out of character. Even characters who spontaneously combust in the movie just poof back into existence.......literally. Its goofy, its emo, and the art runs from pretty to obnoxious. But that is just my perspective looking back with love on this. Again, if you are young this will not so much be confusing but wondrous. If you are old then you finally have an anime worth riffing on.

Show your love and get a copy.",1372896000,,1535,4.36013986013986
