2638914,1,B000HLDFH2,"I bought this DVD because it is one of my favorite animated versions of A Christmas Carol but the DVD I received was defective. When the DVD gets to scene 6 or 7, the picture reverts back to scene 1 while the dialogue for scene 6 or 7 plays. I returned the DVD and asked for a replacement, same thing as the first. Amazon needs a new shipment.",1226620800,11,343,4.0588235294117645
2638915,1,B000HLDFH2,"I have advised Liberation and Amazon of this. Unfortunately there is a scene in the DVD when Mr. Scrooge visits Fezzywig and the video suddenly shows the opening sequence of the movie while the audio continues to play the scene with Scrooge and Fezzywig. Most of that sequence is lost visually. This is not a defect in the material of the DVD but the actual production of the DVD transfer itself.

It is a cute version and once it is fixed I wouldn't mind purchasing it again but until it is fixed I would not buy as you will have to return it.",1165449600,28,544,4.281553398058253

8140298,1,B000HLDFH2,"This is version is one of my least favorite versions.  The artists should never have been hired in the first place.

I own more than sixty film versions of A Christmas Carol.  There are several film versions of this classic tale which I cannot stand, simply because of the poor quality of the art and how lame the dialogue sounds.  This is one of those versions.",1480809600,,362,4.4393939393939394

8140303,4,B000HLDFH2,"The first copy I got of this was defective, but the seller reimbersed mt money quickly and the second copy I got works perfectly, they main draw back is that it is not subtitled or has closed captioning which is important for me as I suffer hearing damage.",1359331200,,256,4.354166666666667
8140304,2,B000HLDFH2,"The DVD has a defect in it. I didn't realize it when i bought it online, but then I saw a lot of people had the same complaint. The seller did refund me though.",1358121600,,160,3.735294117647059
8140305,1,B000HLDFH2,"I purchased this video not trusting the other reviews that existed - shame on me.  There is the segment as described by others where they replay the opening video segment but the audio is for another part.  Then at toward the end of the segment with the third ghost, the is a very big, and important segment that is entirely cut out.  I have the VHS version of this classic which is one of the best adaptations of the book that I've ever seen.  It's too bad the DVD version is such a hack job.  DO NOT BUY this DVD!",1325203200,,515,4.11
8140306,1,B000HLDFH2,I too had the same problem described by other reviewers.  It is unfortunate because this version of A Christmas Carol is the closest I have found to the actual book.,1285027200,2,165,4.5
