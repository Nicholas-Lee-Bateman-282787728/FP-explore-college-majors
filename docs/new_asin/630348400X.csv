7849763,5,630348400X,"Worth any price just to see Jack read on the Steve Allen show.  As Jack reads, ""I wrote the book 'cuz we're all gonna die.""  You can't be more succinct than that.  Put this together with ""The Source"" and ""The Life and Times of Allen Ginsberg"" and you have a fairly complete history of the Beats.  Excellent!",973641600,11,307,4.333333333333333
7849764,5,630348400X,"I bought this video when it first came out, and it's been one of my 'treasures' since.  The 'dramatisation' footage may seem odd, but, if you've seen E! True Hollywood Story, it really isn't.  They might have  chosen an actor with more charisma, but it's really not that big of a deal.  Because the documentary talks to many of his friends and fellow writers,  and the best part: when Kerouac himself, in his prime, reads from the then  just-published book, ""On The Road"" (a clip from the 1950s Steve  Allen tv show; but high quality video; it could be from today).  Pure magic  there.  He's so shy and polite and yet so charismatic !  The film is worth  it just for that one scene.  Steve Allen plays piano improv accompaniment  as Kerouac reads.  It's really neat. Oh, and in color I might add !  I  recommend this video highly if you are a fan of Kerouac (or Steve Allen !)  or the Beats-- or both.  The scenes of his home town add a nice context,  too.  I like this one also because it does not slam him or focus on the  downside of fame, embarrassing moments etc.  It really shows him at his  best.",948240000,16,1103,4.294117647058823
