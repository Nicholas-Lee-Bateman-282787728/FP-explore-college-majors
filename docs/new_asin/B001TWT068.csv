This is actually a very good independent flick full of some great talent and names that all should recognize. Most films with a topic such as this almost always fail on the independent level mainly because they try too many corny jokes and such. Thankfully this one actually has a story behind it and is very funny and entertaining. Of course with a cast like this how could it not be, and guess who made this flick. We will get to that later but this film was formerly known as ""Nice Guys"" from what I can tell. I don't know why they changed the name maybe because this name fits the story a little better or something.

The story follows a group of friends who want nothing more in life than to get their script developed into a full blown movie. Their only hope of accomplishing this goal or at least they think is through one of their girl friends whose star is getting brighter as she is a leading lady now. But now that she is a leading lady she dumps her poor boyfriend and moves on forcing them to look else were for the funding to get it done. Enter a drug deal gone badly and a get rich quick plan that involves said drugs. From this point on any thing can happen and not necessarily in their favor.

A Danny Trejo produced film who also appears in the film was extremely well done by director Joe Eckardt who brings us this great independent film. Written by Cecily Gambrell and Colby Kane this film is full of clever one liner and very funny moments.  The cast is superb and do great jobs like the one and only Ted Raimi who is a cop in this and yes he is one of the stars. Jason Mewes as always is excellent even with out the great Kevin Smith. Andy Dick is just as good in this movie as is Edward Furlong of ""American History X"", and David Faustino who you may know from ""Married with Children"" is just as good. Robert Rodriguez, former wrestler Diamond Dallas Page, and basically every one in this film are excellent.

To be honest I am very surprised that this film has not been more successful or advertised more because it is full of star power and is actually very good. I recommend this flick to any and all because it does not go the way you would think and isn't the type of comedy you may think when looking at the title. Is it about ""High Hopes"" as in drug related comedy, yes but not in a pothead kinda way. Well maybe a little bit but not as much as you would think. The film is much more clever than I thought it would be and really fun.",1248739200,8,2476,4.19327731092437
