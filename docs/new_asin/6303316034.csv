A wealthy land owner Geravase Gurney wills his land to the abbey in exchange for a small home and to have the Abby supply the meals. His stepson is cut out of his inheritance this way. The mother is caught in-between and tries to reconcile them both. Before the deal is done he is poisoned. Yep too many people had access to the meal so it is up to Cadfael (Derek Jacobi) to figure out who did it and why. If you have a pre3ty good idea you are wrong.

Of occurs to add a little spice the toe story when Cadfael discovers a little something of his past that makes it imperative he find the answer.

This is the time that Abbot Herribert (Peter Copley) is replaced by Abbot Radulfus (Terrence Hardiman) see him in a different light as Walter Fane in ""Miss Marple: Sleeping Murder""",1504310400,,864,4.224242424242425

I'm not usually into mysteries, esp. murder mysteries; but the acting and cinematography is awesome.
Now that I own the entire BBS production of Ellis Peters' stories; I'm going to have to read the books.
Anything that translates this well to a television format must be a great read.
It doesn't matter if you like murder mysteries or not; this series is well worth watching.",1360540800,,433,4.636363636363637
7843548,5,6303316034,"Ordered 3 dvd Cadfael episodes for my Mother as birthday presents as she and I both watch PBS.  Mom had never seen Cadfael so it was a treat to introduce her to it as she lives in a different state from myself.  She received all DVDs timely and in good condition.  She has enjoyed watching each one.  I even ordered a set for myself as this show no longer comes on TV and I miss it.  Cadfael is a Benedictine Monk living in England in the 12th century.  He is a scientist/herbalist who is often called upon by the Abbey or village to help solve some crime mystery usually involving murder.  He is very curious and inquisitive fellow and the town's medical examiner, doctor, and detective all rolled into one.  He entered the monastery in his 40's after being both a soldier and sailor amongst other professions.  I know little about this era in history but I find this series authentic in costumes and settings even the monks haircuts!  Worth watching - two thumbs up.  Thank you.",1348099200,,980,4.480225988700565
7843549,4,6303316034,"Brother Cadfael (Derek Jacobi) is drawn into a dysfunctional family's melodrama when the patriarch, a nasty SOB, is poisoned with monk's hood that came from Cadfael's own supply. Edwin, the step-son of the deceased, is accused and flees for his life.

Several factors complicate the mystery. First, the abbot has been called away to a conference, and the prior who was left in charge of the abbey is decidedly hostile to Cadfael. He specifically orders Cadfael to keep out of the investigation. Also, the widow of the deceased, the accused's mother, is Cadfael's old lover. She waited eight years for him to return from the Crusades, then married another. When her husband died, she did not expect to marry again. But when the childless lord of a grand estate, Mallilee, offered to name her son as his heir, she married him.

So how does Cadfael manage to carry on his investigation, and protect Edwin from the over-eager sheriff's deputy until Hugh Berenger returns? He's not to leave the abbey, and he's already in trouble with the prior for his disobedience.

You know Cadfael will manage.",1336780800,,1092,4.891891891891892
7843550,4,6303316034,"This is a very good adaptation of Ellis Peter's Monks Hood. If you have read the book, then you will not be disappointed. The acting was brilliant, Derek Jacobi as cadfael and Mary Miller as Richildis were wonderful. Julian Firth as brother Jerome is brilliantly sycophantic, and also quite funny. The plot is well crafted, Gervase Bonel in a fit of pique disinheirits his stepson Eedwin Gurney, and gifts his land to the Abbey. Bonel then dies violently, and his stepson appears to be the only one with the motive and oppertunity to kill, or was he? Cadfael is drawn in to this because his medicine has been the cause of death. Bonel's wife just happens to be Cadfael's former fiancee...",970617600,,688,4.694214876033058
7843551,4,6303316034,"Brother Cadfael, having fought in the Crusades and seen the world, now lives contentedly in the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul.  He takes pleasure in healing the sick with his herbs and tending his garden.  But  life becomes thorny when Richildis, whom Cadfael loved as a teenager, comes  to dwell within the abbey's confines.  Her second husband Gervase Bonel  deeds his property to the Benedictines and soon afterward is murdered.  Edmund Gurney, Richildis' son, may very well be the killer as he and his  step-father fought bitterly.  The boy prefers the company of commonfolk and  tradespeople, disdaining the lord's more leisurely life.  Gervase has  disinherited Edmund, leaving Mannerly manor and its lands to the  Benedictines in Shrewsbury.
There are others who may have used Cadfael's  curative unction Monk's Hood to kill Master Bonel.  For Richildis' sake,  Cadfael untangles the web in which Edmund has been caught.  The boy's guilt  or innocence must be proven or Cadfael will again have abandoned Richildis.  Also, more than one man's freedom is at stake. With diligence and care  Cadfael manages to separate truth from lies.
Sir Derek Jacob is  brilliantly convincing.  Wistful best describes the look on Cadfael's face  when he learns that Richildis, whom he left for the Holy Land but promised  to wed when he came back, has returned.  There is a gentle innocence in the  scenes between the two, pulling not only at their heartstrings but the  viewer's as well.  The one-time bold crusader must meekly accept his  superior's bidding when ordered to discontinue the investigation.  Cadfael  is still as strong-willed as he was in his youth, but he is a principled  man and having taken vows, one of which is obedience, he acquiesces.  Sir  Derek's wide palette of emotions paints a portrait of Cadfael which is  clearly defined, brightly hued, and of great depth and insight.  He is,  indeed, a master.
Sean Pertwee (Hugh Beringar) is solid as the shire's  undersheriff.  Michael Culver (Prior Robert) may be dislikeable but that's  only his character; Culver is a skilled actor.  The same can be said of  Julian Firth whose Brother Jerome is perhaps the most irritating and  exasperating a man to ever walk the face of the earth.  He is the bane of  Cadfael's life and Cadfael deserves instant sainthood for putting up with  Jerome without resorting to some old crusader's cure for pests - say,  thwacking the heck out of the twitty little monk!
Mary Miller (Richildis)  is exactly the kind of woman with whom Cadfael would have fallen in love as  a youth.  She is warm, caring, faithful, down to earth.  Ms. Miller's  beauty and strength comes from within, yet it is also visible.
Jonny Lee  Miller (Edmund) plays his role of the disinherited youth well.  Huw Garmon  (Meurig) and Thomas Craig (Aelfric) give performances which are to be  respected for their clarity.
Russell Lewis adapted Ellis Peters' book for  the screen.  Graham Theakston directed and Stephen Smallwood produced.  This is an early Cadfael chronicle, as the series of books is called.  It  is also one of the early episodes filmed in the PBS-shown series.  Later  Cadfaels are more cryptic and perhaps more exciting than this episode, but  it is well worth watching more than once.  The Medieval monk is a mystery  himself.  ""Monk's Hood"" provides clues that answer how Cadfael  came to be an Benedictine in the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul.",924739200,9,3435,4.940035273368607
7843552,2,6303316034,"Not enough energy, not enough mystery-solving, not enough romance, not enough humor, not enough wisdom, not enough action (although that's usually not needed in Cadfael stories)- not enough anything.  Very flat.  Had I  seen this prior to purchasing it, I would not have purchased it.",921801600,,284,5.266666666666667
