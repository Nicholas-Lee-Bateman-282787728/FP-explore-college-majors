1919203,5,B0000CGCYT,"Tracey Gold plays Beth, a small town girl who desperately wants to get out and see the world. Her boyfriend Kevin (played by TV's ""Commander in Chief"" Kyle Secor), is a dairy farmer who is just the opposite -- he has no desire to ever leave their small town. Courtney Thorne-Smith plays Cheryl the town's beauty queen, who takes a shine to Kevin. She decides that she and Kevin belong together and she'll do whatever it takes to get Beth out of the picture. Even murder.

Tracey Gold is always a pleasure to watch in these made-for-TV movies (e.g. ""Face of Evil,"" ""For the Love of Nancy"") and she does a great job portraying Beth as being torn between the man she loves and her desire to see what's beyond her small town. But the true star of this movie is Courtney Thorne-Smith, who tackles her role as the psycho Dairy Queen with gusto. One of my favorite TV movies -- my VHS copy is like gold to me until they finally release this great film on DVD. :)",1149206400,3,955,4.335195530726257
1919212,3,B0000CGCYT,"Courtney Thorne-Smith is over the top as Cheryl (oddly, also the name of her character on According to Jim), the Dairy Princess who has decided that, after he has come to her rescue from the unwanted attentions of her date, Kevin will be her husband. Kevin has a girlfriend of two years, Beth. This doesn't bother Cheryl, because as long as they aren't married, Kevin can be ""worked for"" and gotten. They are perfect together, as they both love dairy farming, want to live on a farm and have a family. Cheryl even wears cow earrings and has cow stuffed animals and pillows on her bed. She never shows affection toward a cow in the film, however.

May contain spoilers:
Cheryl is completely, embarrassingly obvious in her endeavors.  And Kevin is completely oblivious. He's slow.  Not so Beth, who catches on right away. Kevin teases Beth that she is jealous of Cheryl. They break up (Cheryl helps this along), and Cheryl is right there to step in, which of course, Kevin allows. He already knows that Cheryl is extremely unstable, having stopped her from jumping off a water tower (I would have let her, in fact, no way would I follow her up that ladder). She also, for some reason, got into someone's Camaro at the bar when she was leaving, took off the emergency brake, and pushed the car into some brush and trees. It wasn't Beth's car. What was up with that?

There is no subtlety in Cheryl's moves. And it's hard to go unnoticed in a huge pepto bismol pink convertible with black and white cow seat covers. Kevin is dumb, as these guys always are. And Beth is not very bright either. When a woman who has stalked you into a barn loft, screamed crazy nonsensical accusations at you, and tried to attack you with a pitchfork, says she wants to talk to you late at night (and she's wearing the same black outfit and cap as she was in the barn), you don't say ""Is my car okay?"" (To talk in.)  And then, when the nutjob actually gets out of your car when you ask her to, you don't just sit there and breath a sigh of relief. You lock all your doors and get the heck out of there as fast as you can! Or else get out of your car and run screaming back into your workplace, because you know your co-worker is still there.

The thing about Cheryl is, any idiot can just look at her and tell that's she's a lunatic and would stay far away from her. She acts very nervous, insecure and on edge. She tells Kevin that she will be whatever he wants her to be. She's worked to get him, so she deserves him, although the whole relationship is of under two months duration. I'm surprised Kevin didn't wreck his truck as he stared out the window at Cheryl looking at wedding dresses in a store window. He kept his head turned practically the whole length of the street.

Cheryl pretends that her father is overprotective and wants to know where she is every minute. Instead he mopes around in the dimness looking at photos of his wife, who died when Cheryl was twelve. He never tells Cheryl that he loves her.  So because of that, she becomes this psycho?

This was based on the story of Lori Esker and Lisa Chiaski. Lori was in FFA and the 4H Club. Lisa was Homecoming Queen in high school. Lisa dated Bill Buss for several years, then they broke up. He and Lori dated on and off for a year and a half. Then he broke up with Lori, and got back with Lisa. After the break-up, Lori became Dairy Princess. Hearing that Lisa was pregnant, and that she and Bill were about to become engaged, on September 21, 1989, Lori drove 150 miles from her college (some reports say she rented a car, some say she could not rent a car, so she drove her own) to ""confront"" Lisa, who happened to have a belt handy (said Lori) in the backseat. Lori strangled her, took the belt and a ring (not the engagement ring, because he was going to propose on Lisa's birthday in October), and later threw both of them away.

Lori's keen advice: ""I was young and I basically threw my whole life away for nothing,"" she said.
""If I can help somebody else, my time is not wasted. If you make a bad enough
mistake, you can realize it the next day, and you still have to sit (in prison).
You have to think about what you're doing before you do it.""",1393804800,3,4200,4.325285895806862
1919213,5,B0000CGCYT,This is based on a true story Courtney Thorne-Smith is exceptional at playing the role of a very sick and disturbed personality that is determined to win the love of a man whose heart belongs to someone else. The very nature of what she does will leave you astounded that such cruelty and cunning could reside in the heart of someone that had everything to live for but could not let go and move on.,1390003200,,399,4.333333333333333

1919219,3,B0000CGCYT,"Courtney Thorne-Smith portrays the dairy princess from hell who'll do anything to gain the love and affections of local farmer Kyle Secor, even if it means eliminating her main rival, his plain Jane fiancee (played by Tracey Gold). Unfortunately his love for his fiance is more than she bargained for and he's a tough man to land.

Based on a true story, Courtney is completely believable as the deadly beauty queen who is at one time earnest and eager to please and within seconds turns psychotic. It would be too easy to turn this role into something campy, but Courtney displays great restraint. You can occasionally find it playing on Lifetime or LMN, but at this price, it's worth the purchase.",1187654400,17,699,4.776859504132231

The book based on a tragic true story also made me fall in love with Tracy Gold.  It's a wonderful terrible murder story, if you know what I mean.  And they wouldn't keep making them if we didn't watch them, and ladies, it is a love triangle thing, which makes it extra compelling.",1182211200,10,447,4.493827160493828
