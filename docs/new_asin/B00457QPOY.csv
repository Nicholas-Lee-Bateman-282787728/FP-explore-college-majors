This video discussion package is generally excellent for production values and intelligent engagement with a significant lightning rod issue. Craig Spinks does consistently excellent videography and edits well. This particular package could perhaps work well with an adult discussion group or class, and I would plan on the discussion becoming lively if not hot at points because at least two of the talking heads are quite provocative, viz. the woman who switched her position and the guy who switched his orientation/lifestyle from homosexual to heterosexual. She seems a bit glib and gullible as she gives the standard rationalizations of the biblical texts to support a ""gay is version B of normal"" position, and he seems impassioned to the point of belligerence at times. Both challenges are legitimate and necessary to the discussion--especially the guy, because we must deal with the conundrum that God evidently can and DOES change sexual orientation--and yet both frankly made me mad because of how they came across. Much of what I detest about this whole debate is how very uncharitable and polarizing it gets.",1290988800,,1185,5.308510638297872
