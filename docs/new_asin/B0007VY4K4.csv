8052319,5,B0007VY4K4,"if i saw this movie when it came out, it was almost 30 years ago. that would be 4 years after high school for me. i only remember being in a hotel room. i think i went to an electronics seminar for a job i had. i don't remember the setting years later, but i do remember how i was touched by this movie. i remember seeing MJW's distraught face on the beach.

fast forward years and years later, after much change, i find myself married with 2 kids, working as a teacher, and for no reason, about a month or two ago, thinking about this movie. the memory haunted me. i couldn't remember any details except the distraught face of MJW on the beach. i knew it was a story about suicide. i put together that a friend of MJW committed suicide in the movie. he spent the movie trying to make sense of it. i remember a lot of self reflecting by Malcom's character. then a smile. did he figure out why his friend killed himself? was he able to let go, forgive, say goodbye on the beach? the feeling of how this movie touched me haunted me. i had to find this movie. it didn't take long, thank you google. i typed in ""Malcolm Jamal Warner after school special"". (how did i remember it was an after school special? i have no idea how. but the memory and words ""after school special"" hit me with warmth like a fresh batch of home made chocolate chip cookies and playing outside in the autumn. it turns out the movie was based on a book by eve bunting, an author i have used in many lessons for my students. a few checks on netflix, hulu, no luck. the movie apparently didn't touch others like it did me. it fell into obscurity. i gave up.

for the next several weeks, every now and again, i'd think of the movie. how it stuck with me. i had to try again. and yesterday i searched on youtube with fingers crossed. it was there. four parts, each ten minutes long, staring at me like a discovered treasure that seemed to say i've been here all along.

i had it backwards. MJW's character committed suicide in the movie (no spoiler, the movie opens with this news) and his best friend spends the movie trying to figure out why. why? it consumed him like an unsolved mystery. he loved his best friend and he couldn't understand why he wouldn't tell him his problems, how he let it come to the point of killing himself. in the end he puts it all together and manages to say goodbye. goodbye to his friend that promised ""together forever"", roommates when we go to college, always friends. and there on the beach he said goodbye.

so i watched it again. the acting was terrible, clearly an after school special, not an oscar contender. but the emotion was there and i think i understood why it stuck with me. they didn't all live happily ever after. it was real. aren't we used to seeing the happy ending? the boy committed suicide but his presence was so strong that he never left his best friend or me. you always saw his face. you felt him. the memory was painful. he was never coming back, never. the best friend cried harder and harder but volume didn't matter. he had no choice but to say goodbye. and there on the beach he said goodbye, alone.",1392681600,3,3130,4.291032148900169
8052320,5,B0007VY4K4,I like old shows better than current shows so I decide to collect those shows from 70s and 80s.  I also get others like this.,1368230400,2,125,4.0

I'm a bit stuck in an 80s time warp is what it is. cookieman108 pretty much covered the content spot on so I'll just tell my personal experience of the product.

Packaging - DVDs come in a case inside of a box doctored to look like the pages of a yearbook. The outer arwork is designed to look like a high school yearbook  so this theme is carried all the way through - on the inside front cover are the student (teen actors) and faculty (adult actors) pictures, the 'first page' contain still shots of each of the four movies, and the 'last page' and inside back cover contains ""Autographs"" which are a brief synopsis of each of the movies and comments made about them eg. by the New York Post/L.A. Times etc. A vey well constructed design overall.

Audio - The 'Settings' option allows you to listen in either Dolby Stereo or Dolby 5.1. The sound is not too bad in either setting. But nothing like ""theatre experience"" if you know what I mean.

Video - The film is not exactly crisp and clear like you'd get on a new DVD. There is the 'fuzz' element (sort of a grainy picture) of the 80s and the colours are a bit muted. If you want a clearer picture of what this DVD looks like, have a look at Chips or Magnum P.I. on network TV and it looks pretty much like that.

DVD Content - Disc 1 contains 'Two Loves for Jenny' originally aired 27.10.82 with a runtime of 44 mins and 44 secs - about a girl who has to choose between what's best for her or what's best for her boyfriend. What choice will she make?; and 'Andrea's Story: A Hitchhiking Tragedy' which was based on the book 'Did You Hear What Happened to Andrea?', so it's also known as 'Did You Hear What Happened to Andrea?' on the DVD, originally aired 7.12.83 with a runtime of 44 mins and 26 secs about a girl who hitches a ride home with unforeseen consequences. Disc 2 contains 'Ace Hits the Big Time' originally aired 2.4.85 with a runtime of 42 mins and 51 secs about mild mannered Horace who, through a comedy of errors, gets mistaken for a big, bad, gang member; and 'A Desperate Exit' also known as 'Face at the Edge of the World' after the book from which it was taken, originally aired 17.9.86 with a runtime of 41 mins and 11 secs about a popular teen who commits suicide and no-one could figure out why. On both discs you may view scenes from each movie (here called Chapters) but they are limited to 4 scenes from each and Photo Gallery which are still shots from the movies themselves. There are some cool graphics integrated into the menu with the school theme taking precedence of course. The menu is backed by a notebook page, a pencil scribbles out the information and an eraser rubs out the information when you move on to the next movie for which the pencil scribbles in the new information.

The movies - I liked each of them very well. I thought they were wholesome family TV with morals in each one of course. The only one I thought was a bit odd and couldn't get the point of was 'Ace hits the big time'. I'm guessing the moral was that if you just be yourself, everything will turn out OK in the end but this was a bit confusing 'cuz it didn't work out BECAUSE he was himself, but IN SPITE of that. Maybe it just seemed weird because I found the whole thing incredibly funny whereas all of the other After School Specials dealt with really serious heavy topics - teen suicide, teenage pregnancy, rape etc.

Would recommend this as good clean pre-teen/teen family viewing or adult trips down Memory Lane.",1201219200,10,3869,4.550287356321839
8052323,5,B0007VY4K4,"The early to mid 80s...the groovy 70s were over, and we were unceremoniously dumped into the gimme gimme greed is good era, rife with yuppies, Iran/Contra hearings, and jellybeans (President Reagan's favorite treat), and we all laughed at the antics of a diminutive (in size, but not in heart), adopted, African American boy named Arnold Jackson as he posed the question we all wanted to know the answer to in 'What choo talkin' bout, Willis?' Yes, what were you talking about, Willis? Anyway, After School Specials, dramatic, sometimes comedic, programs designed especially entertain and teach pre-teens about life and issues they could have very well faced, in terms they could understand in an hour-long format (approximately 45 minutes, without the commercials), were now a television staple. Networks, seeing the potential in reaching a younger audience, began airing primetime sitcoms, that, while they were still comedies, often included more serious tones like drug and alcohol abuse, teen age pregnancy, and so forth in shows like Diff'rent Strokes (1978), The Facts of Life (1979), Family Ties (1982), and so on...this set comes with two DVDs, each containing 2 episodes, or 4 episodes per set. The series (I believe there were something like 26 episodes) was created and produced by Martin Tahse, and won a slew of awards, was really unique in that it was programming for young people that wasn't created to tie into products or sell merchandise, but to speak to them about situations difficult to understand or comprehend, treating its' audience with the respect and intelligence not often seen, not talking down to them but relating to them on a level they understood and appreciated.

The episodes featured on After School Specials 82-86 Vol 6 are as follows;

Two Loves for Jenny (Originally aired 10/27/1982) aka Between Two Loves stars Robert Reed (`The Brady Bunch'), Karlene Crockett (Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story), and Lance Guest (The Last Starfighter).  Reed is an widowed architect with three boys who marries a widowed woman with three girls...er, wait, wrong show...Reed is a high school music teacher who, after plucking a potential promising student (Crockett)  from the manure pile that is the general student population, seeing promise in her ability with a violin, eventually coaxes her to participate in a contest where the prize is a scholarship to a hoity toity music school.  The catch is the girl's boyfriend (Guest) also plans to enter the competition, so now she's torn `between two loves', as she so covets the music scholarship, but is afraid the competition will torpedo her relationship (hey baby, boyfriends are a dime a dozen)...an added bonus, looks for an appearance by Doors guitarist Robby Krieger (no foolin').

Did You Hear What Happened to Andrea? (Originally aired 12/27/1983) aka Andrea's Story: A Hitchhiking Tragedy features Michele Greene (Abby Perkins on the TV show `L.A. Law'), Carrie Snodgress (The Attic), Matt Clark (Brubaker), Moosie Drier (Oh, God!), and an especially young Kirk Cameron.  Andrea (Greene) and her boyfriend David (Drier) thumb a ride with an innocent looking man.  After dropping David off first (good idea, Dave), Andrea arrives home much later, avoiding contact with her family (as you can guess, she ended up paying for the ride...you know the old saying `Cash, grass, or ash, no one rides for free).  Anyway, the truth finally comes out and her parents are torn...Pops (Clark) is understandably angry and Mom (Snodgrass), living in the realm of Neverland, wants to pretend it never happened.  Meanwhile, David decides to take matters into his own hands ala Charles Bronson in Death Wish, by hunting the man down and gutting him like a fish...er, wait, no, that's not right...what he actually does is track the man down by getting his license plate number and reporting it to the police, who subsequently catch and arrest him, but now Andrea isn't sure if she can deal with facing him in court...all joking aside, this was probably one of the more serious episodes, dealing with a particularly difficult issue...

Ace Hits the Big Time (Originally aired 10/28/1981) features Rob Stone (Kevin Owens on the TV show `Mr. Belvedere') as Horace 'Ace' Hobart (you can see why he went with the nickname Ace).  After moving to New York with his family, Ace is warned by his annoying sister that school gang, `The Purple Falcons', will kill him, figuratively speaking.  Anyway, Ace shows up to school with an eye patch (a touch of the pink eye) wearing a garage sale jacket, looking just generally weird.  The gang, who are actually a bunch of whiffs, decide Ace would fit right in with them, so he joins up and makes time with the only girl member who ends up getting kidnapped by a rival gang because they're jealous about, get this, the fact that Ace and his got picked to appear in a low budget movie and they didn't (no foolin')...sort of a low rent West Side Story, this episode features music, dancing, and even a love ballad (no foolin' again)...actually this one is pretty lively...

Face at the Edge of the World (Originally aired 9/17/1986) aka A Desperate Exit features Malcolm-Jamal `Don't call me Theo!' Warner (`The Cosby Show') and Rob Stone (Kevin Owens on the TV show `Mr. Belvedere').  Jed (Stone) Charlie (Warner) were life-long friends, that is until Jed finds out Charlie decided to check out early, if you get my drift...anyway, Jed, who is obviously crushed by not only the loss of his best friend, but also the fact that he had no fore warning of what his friend was going to do, or why he even did what he did.  This drives Jed to delve into Charlie's life, with a little help from some others, to understand the things they never really talked about, things that directly contributed to Charlie's choice to shuck off his mortal coil...

The quality of the video on these DVDs is not the best, but it is as how it was when originally presented, and given these were teleplays made to be presented on television in the 70's, you really can't compare it to today's standards. The packaging is really cool, as the DVDs, enclosed in a regular DVD case, come in a detailed reproduction of a school yearbook. Printed on the inside and the back is a brief synopsis and airdate for each episode, along with the key talent, and the name of the original author for each story.
