6788954,5,B00P826P86,"The film is beautifully shot on the banks of the Tennessee River.  If you enjoy gospel music, you will love this film.  I recommend this film to anyone who needs to find a little inspiration.  Great Message.",1422662400,3,207,4.54054054054054
6788955,4,B00P826P86,"My wife & I wanted to get a ""date-night"" movie that wasn't too guy-oriented (with guns blazing and explosions happening every 5 minutes) or wasn't too chick-flick (with romance as the main topic and will the girl get the guy moments).  I had heard of Welcome To Inspiration from a friend and decided to get it for our date-night.  We wanted a movie that had a feel-good storyline attached to a good message that neither offended nor caused an uproar if we shared it with the rest of our family.  Our grandson wouldn't like it since he's in the slam-bang mode of childhood, but for young adults (10 on up) to us grandparents, the movie was a great attention-getter and had great lessons for all of us!  The story-line has several sub-plots which is great since the young adults want to know what happens to Johnny and Ariel, the married couples want to know what happens to Austin and Marnie as well as Lee and Laura Ann; and everybody else wants to know what happens to the young runaway, the widow grieving over the loss of her daughter, and who really is that street sweeper!  It's very family-friendly and there's some great music that comes along with the story.  Dillon Keith who plays Johnny is a great singer and actor.  The DVD has 2 music videos by Dillon that are not to be missed.  Another music video on the DVD by Delilah Corpodo and the Lee University Singers is excellent!  Larry Gatlin comes in for an all-too-brief appearance midway through the movie with a song and Jason Crabb drops in close to the end of the film.  Both performers did an outstanding job as their songs are key to the message of the movie.  I was surprised that Christy Sutherland and Regina McCrary were not used to the full extent of their vocal talents as both are accomplished singers and award winners in their own rights.  Christy plays Laura Ann and she did her character justice as a woman who holds a secret and finds that the truth really does set you free.  With all the great music that was filtered throughout the movie, one wonders if there will ever be a soundtrack to Welcome To Inspiration.  I hope so!  Now that I've praised this movie to the hilt, you might wonder why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  This bothered me and my wife and I'm almost sure it will bother others, too.  Technically, the movie needs to be cleaned up:  the audio for the movie is low (however the special features were just fine).  The Closed Caption did not work when I played it on my Blu Ray, however when I switched to my older DVD player, the Closed Caption worked.  The final problem was the color process for the movie was washed out..  In other words, the color wasn't vibrant or it didn't stand out.  All of the characters were washed out giving them hardly any color.  If you compare the music videos to the actual movie, you'll find a huge difference in sound, volume, and color!  This could've been a poor technical process when the DVD was mass-produced.  So, with all of that being said, I'm still giving it 4 stars, and I look forward to them making a sequel because the best is yet to come!",1422057600,4,3087,4.440497335701599

6788958,5,B00P826P86,"Based on a friend's recommendation we bought the film and loved it! It is so refreshing to see a movie that has a positive message. The subplots all involve characters in a small town with real, painful, and personal problems that we have all dealt with at one time or another or that we know of people who have. Other characters weave in and out of the film with words of wisdom, hope, and compassion. The overall theme is love and the redemptive power of love. One of the characters introduced early was the Streetsweeper who gently quotes the Good Book. As a lapsed Christian, I was especially moved by the power of his words and the universal wisdom behind them. The setting is gorgeous, the message positive and the ending very satisfying. No violence, wars, or political debates, just a very human drama focused on a small town. We need more films like this.",1426464000,2,864,4.580645161290323

6788963,5,B00P826P86,"This movie is a MUST SEE movie. I was so exited to finally receive my copy. The movie makes life in a small town seem like it use to be. I usually don't buy movies because I don't watch them more than once, but this movie will be viewed again and again. The music was fantastic. I would have liked to have heard a few more Jadon Crabb songs.",1423008000,2,341,3.9565217391304346

8686774,5,B00P826P86,"Welcome to Inspiration is an uplifting, deeply Christian story that takes its inspiration from all of the renowned Hallmark films and the masterpieces of the $5 movie bin. With a diverse cast made up of entitled and clueless white people, one very nosy-I mean *involved* street sweeper (who may just be God himself and/or Gramps,) and a host of Magical Black People, these crazy characters face down enough tropes to make a darned good drinking game.

I am, in fact, writing this review from Heaven, as I played the drinking game. I WON - Jesus himself gives the movie two thumbs up. He sees not trusting your audience enough to let them pick up on subtext, and instead explaining every ""subtlety"" to them, as a very Christian thing to do. So is photographing grieveing people and small children without their consent or knowledge. He also approves of nothing post-2005 existing in the movie, save for the Mini Cooper, even though this film came out in 2015. Jesus digs bellbottom jeans and Dolly Parton hairdos.

May there be a day on God's green earth where a music cafe can stay open while only playing Christian music and musicians. God bless, keep, and save this movie.",1515801600,,1174,4.75
8686775,5,B00P826P86,"The movie "" Welcome to Inspiration""  was a pretty good ""feel-good"" flick. Several, local towns people were actors from where this film was made. So, no they are not ""professional"" actors. But, I enjoyed the movie very much. The movie was ""inspirational"" to me.  Also, at the end of the credits or in special features they young man Dillon Keith has real good music video you all  might enjoy as well.  God is GOOD!, AMEN!",1503619200,,421,4.573333333333333

8686782,4,B00P826P86,"I thought it was charming. The acting was pretty good. I would like to see movies that carry the message of God's word, to do it with confidence and not be wish washy and evasive. Give God credit where credit is due. God's word is powerful and after all isn't that what we, as Christians, are supposed to do, is bring all glory to God? Isn't that what should drive us as Christians? I gave it a 4 star because I thought it was weak in that area.",1446508800,,445,4.068181818181818
