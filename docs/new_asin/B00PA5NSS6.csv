6791497,4,B00PA5NSS6,The acting was not great but the cute bulldog and great storyline made up for it. This is a movie the family can enjoy together no bad language or sex. It was a little silly but in a good way watch it you may enjoy it.,1478563200,2,218,3.760869565217391
6791498,5,B00PA5NSS6,I never thought a talking-dog movie could be so heart-warming... And hilarious. It's going into my holiday-tradition films list ;),1445212800,,130,5.55
6791499,4,B00PA5NSS6,"As a young twenty-something who often uses Tumblr, I found the protagonist very relatable.  Her cynicism towards the modern world is understandable: in a world full of triple homicides, human trafficking, and Denny's restaurants, it is difficult to maintain a positive attitude.  Her workaholic father manages to break through her hard exterior, but the awkward tension between her bubbly, far more sociable sister is palpable.  As someone with an Italian father, I can relate to familial issues.

Of course, Christmas, the only Holiday, is about family.  The struggle to build the Christmas tree is a metaphor for the traditional family struggling to stand up in this modern society so close to the Rapture.  Furthermore, this film uses the protagonist's uncle as a metaphor for the evils of capitalism.  The uncle wishes to sell the family home while the other family members, or the ""people"", wish to keep it.  The home is a metaphor for a nation's capital, and the family's desire to keep it for everyone is an homage to Marxist values.

All in all, this film manages to sneak a lot meaning in a tightly-wrapped Christmas romp.  I hope you all will be able to enjoy as much as myself and my life-partner (a beagle, not a bulldog, hence only four stars) have.",1440806400,,1262,4.855140186915888
6791500,5,B00PA5NSS6,Bought this movie several months ago from director Henrique Couto. It has an excellent story line enjoyed it very much. Overall a nice feel good movie for all ages. Would highly recommend this movie to anybody or any of Henrique Coutos movies. His movies seem to have depth and meaning although some of his other movies are not recommended for all ages they are still worth watching.,1437177600,,383,4.731343283582089
6791501,5,B00PA5NSS6,"Truly a delightful romp with tons of christmas cheer. A Bulldog for Christmas is the sort of film that ought to be part of any family's christmas tradition. Take a brwak from watching Christmas Story 8 times and give A Bulldog for Christmas a chance, won't you?",1436918400,,261,4.574468085106383
6791502,5,B00PA5NSS6,"This is a great family movie. Such cute dogs and a great storyline for all ages, young and old.",1436832000,,95,4.052631578947368
6791503,5,B00PA5NSS6,"Loads of family fun with this one! Everyone knows a relative that is grumpy around the holiday, go ahead and show them this to lighten up their mood!",1436832000,,149,4.357142857142857
6791504,5,B00PA5NSS6,I've been a fan of Henrique Cuoto's for a while now.  I was very excited to see this film.  It is a great family movie my youngest(7yrs old) absolutely loves this movie!!! The cast is great especially Erin R. Ryan & Mary Lee Osborune.  I highly recommend this film.,1436832000,,265,4.36734693877551
6791505,3,B00PA5NSS6,I love English Bulldogs. We have one. This movie is ok but it is a poor made movie.,1423872000,,83,3.6666666666666665
6791506,1,B00PA5NSS6,"Oh my, I can't even express how bad, very bad this movie is. I think the good reviews are friends making joke reviews or something. I watch a LOT of free prime that reviewers call poor, but this is the worst of the worst.
When my kids were growing up they would do corny skits in costumes with the family camcorder, even for junior high projects for school, and it truly is on that level.
NOTHING professional about it. And I watch a LOT of crappy movies for the sake of Christmas cheese, but this was so so so bad. Take it off the offerings, please. Would like the option of less than one star
And I love bulldogs too...

6791507,4,B00PA5NSS6,This is a good movie but some of it does not make sense. Anyways its still a good movie.,1482624000,,88,3.6842105263157894
6791508,2,B00PA5NSS6,This movie has acute theme but the acting is very amateurish and the scenes inconsistent.,1482192000,,89,5.0
6791509,1,B00PA5NSS6,Horrid acting. Horrid story.,1481760000,,28,6.25
6791510,5,B00PA5NSS6,"This magical film made me believe in both bulldogs and Christmas miracles. I now understand the complexities of love and marriage proposals. Next year, I hope that I receive (or become) a bulldog for Christmas. I am ready for the sequel. Henrique Couto is the real hero of this film. He's my (bull)dawg (for Christmas).",1481241600,3,319,4.818181818181818
6791511,1,B00PA5NSS6,"I watched it for the bulldog, but it really was not a good flick at all.",1480809600,2,72,3.5625
6791512,1,B00PA5NSS6,This movie had me feeling like there was going to be a soft porn skinamax scene at any moment the acting was so bad. Unfortunately no cheesy s x scene.  I mean if your working with a computer make sure the screen is on in the scene..  The car rides are priceless in a epically bad way.  I do have to say the best actor/actress in the movie was the bulldog because he just sat there and slobbered the whole movie.,1480464000,2,412,4.061728395061729
6791513,1,B00PA5NSS6,"This ""movie"" was an atrocity. The acting can be described as high school play hopefuls who don't make the cut. The scenery in the airport was literally just a single couch and a plain white background. The terrible overacting and dramatic hand gestures had me laughing so hard at the idiocy I was crying. The scenes with the ""moving"" car (which was reminiscent of the swaying rides for kids that used to be in front of grocery stores) had me gasping for air in between bouts of laughter. If you are forced to watch this movie, I would recommended plenty of libations and anti-nausea medications.",1480464000,3,595,4.6761904761904765
6791514,1,B00PA5NSS6,"I could've recorded my boyfriend's reaction to this movie and it would've been of better quality. Horrific acting, absolutely horrific. I would also say the set quality was as bad but I don't think there was really even a ""set""....they literally rocked the car back and forth to imitate movement.

I'm nearly certain the positive reviews are from the actors or someone who financially benefits from this movie.",1480464000,,410,5.029411764705882
6791515,1,B00PA5NSS6,"Worst acting ever... worst directing ever... worst story and screenplay ever... it truly is the worst of everything wrapped up with a big, drooling, wrinkled, red bow.  Watching this movie is as painful as the affixing the hardware to the lead actress face must have been.  Why would anyone subject themselves to the pain of this movie? Perhaps out of self guilt for past transgressions - anything else would be no excuse for such abject torture.",1479340800,,446,4.855263157894737
8687169,4,B00PA5NSS6,"A goofy, awkward family comedy that is told in a sincere, Hallmark style. An odd duck, but just so awkward and silly, I couldn't help but have some fun with this one. Visit my site for a full review.",1532995200,,199,4.128205128205129
8687170,1,B00PA5NSS6,Awful. Acting was terrible. Don't waste your time. The Bulldog was the only good part of the movie,1530489600,,98,4.5

8687172,1,B00PA5NSS6,"One star is really stretching it,  I would have given it less if I could have. I love bulldogs so was drawn to this movie but couldn't make it even 5 minutes into it.  Horrible acting,  super amateur movie.  Wouldn't waste your time.",1512432000,,233,4.348837209302325
8687173,3,B00PA5NSS6,"The movie was special, we have a few questions,
1. Why is the mom 80 and the dad is 40? And how did the 80 year old mother have a 4 year old daughter.
2. When Sally becomes the bulldog she turns into a bulldog that did not yet exist, but at the end she leave the bulldogs body the bulldog is still there...there is no logical explanation other then she just left behind a dead bulldog corpse with no soul or life at all.",1498348800,2,420,3.9529411764705884
8687174,1,B00PA5NSS6,"Why did they even bother to make this toilet of a movie.  Amateur all the way.  Bad acting, bad movie, bad directing, bad everything.  They should he ashamed of having wasted the monies to make this horrific junk. And wasting the viewers time. Shame on them.  It wasn't an A movie, or B, not even C and to say it was a D movie is giving it too much credit.  It rated F minus,minus.

Just a complete waste.  I couldn't see it to the end.  I would think few could.",1496966400,,462,4.055555555555555

There were a few spots that would have benefited from some finessing, but the humorous and meaningful moments made up for them.  The ending was GREAT!  My son wants to watch it again at Christmas-time.",1491350400,,302,4.730769230769231
