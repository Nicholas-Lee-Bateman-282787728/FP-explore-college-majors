8014581,1,B0001M2CB2,"I just couldn't get into this documentary...perhaps I am spoiled by the mini-series ""Planet Earth"" or Michael Palin's travelogues.  The sound alternated between too soft and too loud...the background music did not seem to fit the atmosphere and tone of the film at all.  In fact, it put me right to sleep.  Normally, this is a subject I would be very interested in, but I couldn't even focus on it for more than a minute at a time.  I would recommend something from the History Channel rather than this.",1209427200,,503,4.617977528089888
