4489094,5,B004WSA4E8,"I've been playing King of fighters since the fatal fury days, and even art of fighting. A while back SNK released an anime series entitled King of fighters another day, a very short series, but very enjoyable. Now in 2010, Gordon Chan released a feature length live action movie, did it succeed?

Story: Rugal has stolen 3 of the relics, so that he can become King of fighters. Iori is being controlled by the orochi, and refuses to fight after what happened in the past. Because of what happened, Saisyu Kusanagi is in a rehab center. Kyo kusanagi has the kusanagi sword, which is the only way to stop Rugal. Mai is working for Terry Bogard, as a CIA agent to stop Rugal from murdering people. Oh yeah, and Mr. Big from the art of fighting has a cameo in the beginning. Chizuru is also trying to stop Rugal, Rugal takes control of Vice and Mature. This all leads up to interesting character development.

Casting: Great casting by all actors. Ray park plays Rugal, you all may know him as darth maul, snake eyes, chuck norris etc. Rugal plays the villain in this film very well, and does his best to mimic the role of Rugal from the game. Iori does not have red hair, but still has the outfit, and looks like him. Kyo is done very well, he has the outfit, good job. Mai has a new outfit, and looks as beautiful as ever. Terry bogard has his blonde hair and blue eyes, he gets his outfit in the end of the film. Mr. big wears his fur coat. Vice and Mature definitley looked the best, in relation to the game. Chizuru and Saisyu are well casting. All the actors know how to fight, especially the actor playin Iori. No complaints there.

Acting: Really good video game type of acting. The actors do their best in the film. Rugal plays a great villain, I like movies with good bad guys, and Ray Park pulled of the role as one of the greatest video game villians of all time! As the actors develop deep emotion within their character, the use their persona and eventually become the characters from the game. With good humor, and good acting, this is a film that entertains you in every way.

Special effects/CGI: The cgi work is really good, when a character performs a special move you'll notice the effects are really cool.

Costumes: The costumes are terrific, each character had the same costume from the game, Mai's outfit was switched, but I still like it!

Sexuality: There is a lesbian scene between Vice and Mature, so get ready!

Sets: Alot of these were real sets, you'll notice this in the making of the film. Good sets equals a good budget quality

Fight scenes: Some of the best fight scenes I have ever seen, the tag team match with vice and mature against rugal was choreographed very well. The final fight scene was done really well, especially Iori, the actor who plays Iori himself is a martial arts champion. The actor playing terry bogard is actually a stunt man, good choice! Same for all the other actors, I was literally sucked in on all the great choreography. As we all know the KOF series has some of the best fighting styles in any fighting game, so Gordon Chan does a great job on fulfilling that.

Final Word: Gordon chan uses elements of the king of fighters to engage the viewers and fans of the game. Right away I noticed the great soundtrack in the end credits. Within the first fight scene, Mai vs mr. Big, you are sucked in, being trapped in with enjoyment. I have been a KOF fan for as long as I can remember, and when I heard they were doing a live action movie, I just had to see it. And I had no regrets at all. I dug deep in this film and what I liked about it the most. This is a KOF fan must have! Please make a sequel, I am waiting for it to happen. Movies like this deserve a sequel. I have no regrets on this, I reccommend this to all those who love the KOF series.",1358121600,4,3808,4.337078651685394
4489095,2,B004WSA4E8,"Ok. Let me go on record as saying the movie is ok. Maggie Q delivers a good performance, but she is no Mai. Ray Park is supposed to be Rugal and the Rugal i know never skateboarded. I give the movie credit in the creation of a virtual world tournament and the attempt at a story line. deviation from the source is not a good thing. No video game based movie that deviates from the source is great. The reason for the success of Mortal Kombat and Tekken is that they stay mostly true to their source. KOF is a tournament not a showcase for ok acting. If you a fan of King of Fighters do not take this movie seriously. If you are a fan of Maggie Q please watch Preist or Nakita before juding her fighting and acting potential. If you are looking to kill two hours while not playing the game then this is ok. Better than watching grass grow and on par with Street Fighter the movie. It falls just short of Legend of Chun-Li and that is saying quite a bit.",1349222400,,952,4.123655913978495
4489096,1,B004WSA4E8,"I've always been a big fan of KOF, played it since the first installment The King of Fighters '94 way back in the days.  I guess considering how horrendous video game movies that have been released in the past, like mario and double dragon I had no expecations on this one.  The plot was weak and really cheesy, fighting scenes were dull and not even interesting.

What I especially did not like was the actors they cast for the movie and in no way were even close to the characters of the game.  If you are a fan of the games and familiar with all of the characters then you'll know what I'm talking about and since everyone brought up how Kyo and Terry were portrayed I'll describe the other less known characters.  In this film Rugal is this really short scrawny not so intimidating looking man whereas in the game hes over seven foot tall and scary looking, Vice and Mature are portrayed as your typical lipstick lesbian lovers just to turn guys on and in the game they are these ruthless, foulmouthed bad asses with the most bitchin personalities ever.  Mai is portrayed as this serious and really dull woman with a blue outfit and no fans and in the game she's this happy, bouncy, funny girl.  Chizuru Kagura (A personal favorite character of mine) was portrayed as this old woman who acts as a mentor to Mai and helps them on their quest, in the game she's a young pretty girl who sort of acts as a love interest to the main character Kyo, but nope none of that is found here.  It seems like the director and producers made no effort to do any research or even took the time to play the games before making this film.

The fight scenes take place in a virtual reality world and like the nightmare on elm street films Rugal torments everyone in this vr world as soon as they put the device on their ears and the bland fighting begins.

Overall this is the first film I can proudly say I would not recommend you go out and watch even if your a fan of KOF.  If you must watch it, just rent it or keep playing the games and pray they release a totally cool anime based on it.",1345248000,2,2078,4.275510204081633
4489097,3,B004WSA4E8,"The movie hits you with a bunch of stuff that normal people won't follow. There is a mirror,a shield, a necklace, a sword, and the real sword. These are all related in a story with too much information to follow. But don't worry. You don't have to. The story line is simpler than the complex explanation: Good guys fight bad guys.

People fight in games in an alternate dimension, that is made virtual with ear pieces. It combines magical ancient oriental artifacts with Bluetooth technology. There is also an evil spirit that can be let loose which will make the games real. Maggie Q fights in a short skirt with stockings. She dates a man who was a former champion. But is really not her boyfriend...

While the fighters are having a meeting, a man (Rugal, Ray Park) decides to bring a gun to a fist fight, runs off with the artifacts, and physically goes into that other dimension. The CIA is monitoring the activity. Maggie Q is instructed to go find a man who is in a mental institution, one where all you have to do is go up to the front desk and ask to speak to a patient and they unlock the door for you.

Rugal has taken control of the games and issued a challenge to all the remaining reality fighters, except they don't know they will be fighting with their own lives!

Once he beats up all the fighters, he gets the title ""King of Fighters"" for what it is worth. (What is that? Like a level 72 in WOW?) At this point, unless Rugal (I would have named Nigel) wins and rules the world, the plot is predictable. Maggie is not much of an old world traditionalist. She likes the ""R"" word: reason. Sean Faris plays the son of a former fighter (the man in the mental institution). He is into Zen and motorcycle maintenance. (Oh! How did the writers ever come up with that! They should have made him a minor league baseball player and have him use his skills later on, a nice tie-in.)

On the plus side, women fight in short skirts. On the negative side: They needed to add a little humor. The movie had some funny lines except they were delivered in a stiff manner. David Leitch who played investigator Terry Bogard absolutely stank. He had the best lines in the movie and screwed them up. They really needed a funny Bruce Willis. The story line was fine, it could use a few tweaks, but the poor dry dialouge dragged the movie down. If you like girls fighting in short skirts in an alternate reality, try ""Sucker Punch.""

No sex, no nudity, no f-bombs. Near lesbian scene. Excessive amount of CG style fighting. 2 1/2 stars",1344556800,2,2528,4.402569593147752
4489098,2,B004WSA4E8,"I normally wouldn't take my time to write a review for something like this, but here I go. First off, I've probably seen every fighting game movie they've made, with the last 15 or so years at least (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Dead Or Alive, Tekken).

Story: You're going to have to remember that the story for any video game movie is never going to be excellent, partially because the games themselves lack a solid story. The story of this is your basic bad guy steals powerful relics to release and evil power in order to take over the world. Cue the good guys have to find another relic in which they need to enlist the aid of a typical hero who doesn't think he's good enough.

Characters: I don't really think the movie made that much of an effort to stay the least bit truthful to the actual characters in the game. Terry is middle-aged, and they ""try"" to dress him like the Terry in the game towards then end, but he looks so way off. He's a guy in his 40's dressing like someone in his 20s. Plus there are only a handful of charcters in the movie. They talk about the tournament and all that, but it's the same 6 people fighting. Where's the tournament?! Oh, and since when does Mai start using lightning? Doesn't she use fire from her also missing fan?

Fighting: This is where, for me at least, most fighting games make up for everything else they lack. Sadly, this one fails on that aspect as well.  It's as if they filmed the fight sequences with a hand-held camera. It's that shaky. You can't appreciate any of them because you get a headache just watching.

The only reason why I didn't give this movie 1 star is because I like some of the people in it. This is the first fighting movie, however, where I actually had to complete it in two spearate sessions because I got bored part way through.",1331856000,11,1813,4.367952522255193
4489099,4,B004WSA4E8,"This movie really isn't bad, and is quite enjoyable. Definitely a must see for any King of Fighters fan. The story is creative, the action and special effects are well done. Most importantly, the film is faithful to the characters, and attempt to make them appear like their video game counterparts. It's not as bad as the other reviewers state. Definitely better than any Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat film to date.",1330128000,3,418,4.819444444444445
4489100,1,B004WSA4E8,"Where did I see this... premium movie channel?(now cancelled after free time was up) Or ""SyFy"", that seems like it makes more sense.

First off, if you know the title by the video games, really really don't bother with this movie.
To begin with, 3 animated features have already been made from the series, by the name of ""Fatal Fury"" (under movies and TV).
Anyway just to the movie, not quite typical B movie, in that the story is incoherent, I still don't know what the hell was going on. I mean really, if you haven't played the game, what story there is will just through some incredible amount of ""magic"" and special power stuff that is made nonsense here even if you were aware of the universe it comes from.

Under no circumstances could I say this movie is worth watching.",1326931200,3,779,4.47887323943662

4489102,1,B004WSA4E8,"Yet another live-action version of long-running fighting game series, ""King of Fighters"" spends so much time telling us the back stories of the characters most uninitiated viewers including me do not care. What we (and avid fans of the original game) need is thrilling actions, but sadly the film fails to deliver them.

The film is about the ""tournament"" in an alternate dimension, where participants including Mai Shiranui (Maggie Q) battle with another fighter. It was supposed to be just fun, but not so any more when Rugal Bernstein (Ray Park) steals the relics - three treasures based on a Japanese myth - in order to use the powers of ""Orochi."" Battles of the fighters to stop Rugal begin.

Director Gordon Chan (Jackie Chan's enjoyable ""Thunderbolt"" and not-so-enjoyable ""The Medallion"") makes no attempt to bring any style or pace into the film. The film's mid-section is painfully boring with characters who keep talking about ""Orochi"" and things we don't really care. In the terribly choreographed fight sequences such talented players as Maggie Q and Ray Park are wasted because of the too quick cuts and the camera that refuses to stay still.

""King of Fighters"" suffers from sluggish pace and bland actions. Martial arts combat scenes lack power and originality, worse than those in ""Tekken."" Bad acting doesn't help, and neither do cheap effects and production designs.",1317772800,6,1384,5.0881057268722465
4489103,2,B004WSA4E8,"I can't help but imagine that had ""King of Fighters"" been released fifteen years ago, it would have generated more interest. Since the days of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-Bros/dp/B00008979N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario Bros.</a>, unfaithful filmmakers have buried video game-inspired movies so deep under the ground that nowadays a potential blockbuster like this is forced to be released direct-to-video. I can't help but think that most viewers just don't get too excited about these movies anymore, even when they're based on as cool a franchise as this.

The story: when a virtual fighting tournament is hijacked by the evil Rugal (Ray Park,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Phantom-Menace/dp/B00003CX5P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Phantom Menace</a>), it's up to the undercover operative Mai (Maggie Q,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Free-or-Die-Hard/dp/B000VNMMR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live Free or Die Hard</a>), clan torchbearer Iori Yagami (Will Yun Lee,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elektra/dp/B0007P0Y7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elektra</a>), unwilling hero Kyo Kusanagi (Sean Faris,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Never-Back-Down/dp/B0014DZ2WS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Never Back Down</a>), and CIA agent Terry Bogard (David Leitch, Brad Pitt's official stunt double) to stop him from fulfilling an ancient prophecy and sealing the fate of the world.

""King of Fighters"" is a pretty bad adaptation. Virtually none of the performers come very close to their animated counterparts in appearance or personality. Even performers whom I like by default, like Maggie Q and Ray Park, can't hope to make their parts work for them. The casting of Sean Faris as Kyo Kusanagi is right up there with having Justin Chatwin play Goku in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragonball-Evolution/dp/B00260HH3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragonball: Evolution</a>&nbsp;or Kristin Kreuk star in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Chun-Li/dp/B00260HH30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Chun Li</a>. Other performers like Francoise ""Chizuru"" Yip (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mask/dp/B00005OOQ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mask</a>) and TV veteran Hiro ""Saisyu"" Kanagawa at least seem like good choices for their roles but are then either promptly taken out of commission or die. Great.

Seventeen years ago, director Gordon Chan helmed one of the greatest martial arts films ever made,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fist-of-Legend/dp/B001AR0D1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fist of Legend</a>, but now he's clearly following western studio standards by assuming that it's okay to fill a fight scene with uptight camera angles and unnecessary cutting so long as everything moves erratically enough to *seem* like it's impressive. C'mon, Gordon - you can do better. There are eleven fights to be seen and practically none of them are good. The opening one between Mai and Terry caught my attention for its obvious lack of doubles and long, uninterrupted camera shots, but nevertheless featured a complete lack of rhythm and poor pacing. All future fights drop that one's strong points, however, and we're left with little more than run-of-the-mill fights. Major disappointment.

The only things keeping this film from a 1-star rating are its production values, which show that director Chan at least knows how to make $12 million look like more than it is. Also, the acting isn't a total waste, but this ain't enough to save the movie. Count it as another loss, game fans, and know that you're not missing out on anything by leaving this one to collect dust on the shelf.",1316995200,,4024,7.206122448979592
4489104,1,B004WSA4E8,"This movie totally sucked. The story is terrible. The acting is terrible. The fight scenes are terrible.

The story is bad because it's not even close to the video game. Maybe some video game based movies could do that, but it still has to make sense! The story doesn't make any sense at all. The movie seemed to have no direction to it and wasn't planned. The story in question, actually had a lot of background story to it, but it needed to be explained much better. They could had started the movie explaining there were two group of Japanese clans fighting in a war with each other, and then, explained the story's special weapons they used too. But they didn't do that. Instead, they introduced each new fighter and will told you a little bit more about the background story slowly. Then, you are slowly learning more about the background, but keep on asking yourself, what's going? You are pilling up the questions and getting few answers as the movie continues to go on. See that is pretty boring and frusting to me.

The acting in this movie is very cheesy and not good. They don't make me believe what's really going on and didn't draw me into the movie. Then, their fighting scenes aren't good. They didn't do that much fighting, but use a lot of cheap special effects, which is supposed to make it look more interesting. It didn't work for me. Also the way they shot their fight scenes are bad. They like to cut in and out of almost every punch, kick, or whatever they are doing. So, you see a punch, then a shot of the wall, then a shot for a another punch for the actual hit. Also, when you look at them fight closely, you see them punch or kick air most of the time and the other person pretends to get hit even though you can tell it wasn't even close to connecting. Terrible! WWE does it much better!

I really question the reviews for 5 stars on here. If you read them, they don't sound like reviews. One review said, he didn't watch it yet, and he/she still gave it 5 stars??? Another review had one sentence and it said it was great because it wasn't like the video game. To me, I think why? What made it so great? I could had basically said this movie sucked. Put down 1 star and submitted it. Not many people would like that. But, I actually explained and give the reasons why. That's how a proper review should be done.

If you really want to watch a better fighting game based movie, then check out ""Tekken"" the live action movie. That movie is just amazing well done. The story does match the game's story, per se, and wasn't butcher like this movie was. Check that out.",1315958400,8,2594,4.353305785123967

The storyline was taken from the videogame but if the director had stuck to the videogame itself the real story would've just focused on the tournament. Yet in its place we've got to suffer through some wack nonsense about alternate dimensions and joining them together! Maggie Q should be ashamed of herself and clearly she did this for the money! You know this garbage is some crap whenever Ray Park is overly acting the part of the bad guy terribly! Coupled with special effects so horrible that they could've been improved with a stop motion camera and photoshop! Keep the spirit of the videogame alive by playing the game! Kill the memory of the game by watching this $#!t!",1411776000,,1024,4.890804597701149
8445648,3,B004WSA4E8,This was okay in some parts but overall it was a b movie for martial arts. had some CGI energy blasts and whatnot but overall cheap sets. some of it was good but i wouldnt care if I lost it. wouldnt really recommend it and I'm not usually one of those people who writes  harsh reviews on movies. i generally like most movies. the trailer for this makes it seem better than it is,1381881600,,378,4.108108108108108
