The sound is a little odd and the video isn't a first-rate production, but the workout is really good.  She works the upper body with weights, and then she works the entire body with weights incorporating squats.  She also does the calves and the abs and offers a warm-up and cool-down.  You can't ask for more from a video.",1199923200,2,466,4.372093023255814
8020880,4,B00022I9EU,"I bought this video not really expecting much--it's hard to take a workout coach seriously when she calls herself ""Sunshine"" and looks like an airheaded blonde beach bunny--but recently, after coming off an involuntary lay-off due to some back problems, I needed a short resistance workout to put some tone back into my muscles, and preferably get some cardio effect as well. I decided to give this video a try and it was just what the doctor ordered (metaphorically). To avoid re-aggravating my back, I had to modify the deadlifts and brace my head against a piece of furniture during the bent-over rows, but other than that the workout was simple and fast, which is what I wanted. You get a cardio effect from the rapid pace (she moves from exercise to exercise with very little rest) and from three sets of a special compound exercise she puts in at the end. I'm an experienced exerciser, and by the end I've worked up a slight sweat even in cool weather. You can always increase the weights if you need more of a challenge.  I would have changed the order of exercise to start with legs and get the bigger muscles working and the blood pumping, but other than that I am pretty satisfied.",1167868800,15,1191,4.591549295774648
8020881,5,B00022I9EU,"I got the combination of the Fun Circuit training exercises  and the Funcercise workout with resistance bands and in the beginning of march this year after giving birth, and I am very happy that I got this combination, I use them to alternate my workout routine and I don't get bored.

This circuit training has a non stop full body workout routine and has about 20 different exercises that Sunshine first demonstrates and then dose the exercise, making it easy to follow. I use 5 Lb weights. The routine is nicely done in a very simple basic manner with exercises starting for the upper body and moving to the lower body and abdominal exercises, giving me a full complete workout in 30 minutes.

I am fully satisfied with the results, I have lost nearly 3 dress sizes and 15 Lbs in just 6 weeks since I started exercising with both these workout routines and using the Progress chart with the 1200 calorie diet in the first 2 weeks. After that I started using the Free interactive menu planner in the Funcercise web site, which allows me to chose the foods that I like to eat, like this I do not feel hungry and that that I'm dieting.

These are 2 good fitness workouts that I recommend to all who want to lose weight get fit and  firm.",1147824000,23,1237,4.431718061674009
8020882,5,B00022I9EU,"I have the dvd and wanted to share this with you all.

I am an intermediary exerciser.  I wanted a more challenging workout routine, which this workout exactly gives me. It has a complete exercise routine with weights that I do for a full body workout in 30 minutes, with no bells or frills.

The workout is done nicely on the beach and there are many cameras showing the exercise from many angles unlike many other DVDs that I have that are filmed in a gym mainly.

I have also started using different weights for different exercises making it a more intense workout routine.

Each exercise is explained and shown first in a simple way. Sunshine is in great shape and always smiling. I exercise early in the morning and seeing the Beautiful Sunny Beach makes me feel good working out.

I like this workout because the way the exercises flow seamlessly from one to another non stop giving me a total full body routine this has it all. Including a 5 minute relaxation segment after the cool down, that gives me a very good feeling at the end of the workout.

This workout is not for someone that wants to do body building it is more for firmness, endurance and strength which is what I wanted to add to my training.

I like this circuit & weights workout routine a lot.",1134777600,8,1268,4.435344827586207
8020883,5,B00022I9EU,"I was looking for a video to use at home to train with light weights. This video is simple to follow and works all the major body parts in sequence to give a full body workout in about 30 minutes. I like the fact that you can alter the intensity of the workout by using lighter or heavier dumbbells (3-5# for beginners)and by doing 1, 2, or 3 sets of each exercise. Usually, sets 1 and 2 are the same exercise and the third set is a slightly different exercise working the same body part. I did the first run through of the video without any weights, just to get familiar with the exercises and to warm up my muscles.

The audio is a little monotonous and not done by Sunshine the exerciser, but Sunshine is in great shape and the video shows an example of each exercise before the first set so it's easy to follow.

I think this video is very helpful and well worth the money.",1133654400,37,877,4.183431952662722
8020884,5,B00022I9EU,"I am overweight and wanted an effective workout to lose weight and get fit at home without machines & gyms because I do not have 3 hours to travel to gyms and pay the fees, I read the reviews here and I got this Circuit Trainging DVD toghther with the Funcercise Resistance Bands DVD to Rotate my workouts.

In just 4 Weeks, I lost 8 LB and 2 dress sizes which makes me feel Good. This Dvd has a full body workout and a beautiful Relaxation segment after the cool down.

The Dvd is done very professionally and Sunshine demonstrates and explains the exercises clearly making it Simple and Easy for me to do. I also like the music that suits this workout.

I started doing the workout routine slowly as advised in the DVD, and  I did only 1 set for  the first 2 weeks, and 2 sets for the 3rd and 4th week. Now in just 4 weeks I am doing the Entire circuit weight trianing routine Non-stop.

I recommend this Circuit Training Dvd and the Funcercise resistance bands Dvd to anyone that wants to get fit, stay firm and lose weight in minimal time without the whistles & bells of Gyms & Machines.

I have Greatly benifited from these exercise DVDs and will be using them for a Long Time.

8020885,5,B00022I9EU,"The Circuit Weight Training Exercises on this video gives me an Awesome Workout. The Exercises are very Good & Effective. In just 30 minutes I do an incredible intense Workout with dumbbells & to Energizing Instrumental Rock Music, which I happen to love.

I bought my first Funcercise video about 8 months ago and I was really amazed at how easy and effective these exercises were.

I am a stay-at-home Mom with a 3 year old, so going to the gym everyday is very hard for me. But with the Funcercise Resistance, I can do the same exercises at home and even my son joins in sometimes. This is my 3rd Funcercise Video. I Also have the Fun-Beginners video, & rotate to get different workouts and not get bored.

In the few months that I have these videos I gained Strength & Endurance and decided to get the Fun-Circuit video to add another level of strength training & cardio workout to my routine.

This video has given me more Endurance & Strength. My family & friends are noticing what I have achieved in losing Sizes & Weight.

The video is filmed on the beach giving a beautiful backdrop. I also love it that the narration is very minimal because of how Sunshine demonstrates each Exercise & then the set starts, which makes it very easy to follow & do, and makes it so simple that sometimes I use my own music CDs. I finish my full body work out routine without even noticing how fast its over.

I recommend this video to anyone who wants to get fast results in minimal time. This is a killer workout video, especially the Triple Whammy set in the end of the exhausting workout routine, the cool down & stretching, and then the relaxation in the end of the video is a definite plus, which has great affirmations & breathing exercises. When I finish the relaxation part in the end after the intense workout, I have a very Positive, Happier Upbeat Feeling.

I certainly recommend this video to anyone that wants an effective workout + get fast results.",1107216000,33,1955,4.505649717514125
8020886,5,B00022I9EU,"A Great Fun Circuit Weight Training video,

I enjoy working out with this Fun Circuit Video. It has good  explanation & demonstration of each exercise before the exercise  begins, which makes it very easy to follow.

The Exercises are Very Well Done and Very Effective, The Narration is minimal, with motivating  Rock Music that suits the timing & workout.

The video is pleasant to view and workout with and has a nice ocean background, with Sunshine motivating and giving proper  instructions.

I do this Circuit training video 3 times a week, and I have gained strength & endurance and can now do the full Circuit workout non stop.

I recommended this video to all my family and friends. And I  can whole hearthledly say that this is the Best Circuit Weight Training Video.",1107216000,12,776,4.7669172932330826
