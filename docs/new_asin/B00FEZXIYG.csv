8615053,1,B00FEZXIYG,Stay away from this movie. Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time. The worst movie ever! Save your money and stay away.,1391817600,,130,4.458333333333333
8615054,1,B00FEZXIYG,"Creepy, strange, cheap, unwatchable.  Save yourself and your children and steer clear of this one.  The plot is incomprehensible and the characters are unlikeable.  The pirate tie-in is vague at best as most of the story revolves around defeating the giant monkey robot casino.  And I'm not joking.",1390521600,4,298,5.145833333333333
