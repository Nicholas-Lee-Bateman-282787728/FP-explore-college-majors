7878749,1,6304880200,The views were interesting but the focus not on the castles and we found the quality of video was poor,1365033600,,102,4.15
7878750,4,6304880200,"Plenty of travel videos might as well be written by the local chamber of commerce, with no depth and way too many superlatives. This video, put together by The Learning Channel, is quite different. It doesn't simply show the castles, but explains the historical context in which they were important. There's also plenty of anecdotes, such as the minor ""miracle"" that caused the Marksburg on the Rhine to be so named.
If you're planning a trip to any of these areas, watching this video will both show you the region and give you some background with which to appreciate it.",1072396800,,573,4.74
7878751,3,6304880200,"I watched this video a short back while after selecting from a stack of five videos I had collected to begin planning a trip to Italy in 2001. I  selected this one to watch first, as I wanted to see a Bertalucci film the  same evening and this one was relatively brief. I'd give it points for  covering some of the lesser known areas of Tuscany and showing a map along  the route as the ""journey"" through Tuscany progresses. The  photography is nice, but not very exciting,(how can you miss with that  countryside?), and some topics are almost too briefly touched on. But, if  you haven't traveled to Tuscany before, or just want to get a better feel  for some of the less known and not as frequently mentioned villages and  towns this is a very good start. That's why they call the series ""The  Back Roads"". It is not as slick or informative as Fodor's videos, but  it is also not as expensive, I'm relatively sure. It is also more of a  succint, but educational, thumbnail sketch of lesser known locations from a  cultural, historical and geographic perspective. I did not purchase this  video because I was able to check it out of my local library, but it has  obviously been well-used and I do not think that the Amazon purchase price  is at all unreasonable.",964742400,7,1263,4.497797356828194
7878752,2,6304880200,"Your editorial review said: ""Then, on Wallachia [...] better known as Transylvania"". That's like saying: Nevada, better known as California. Romania had three major provinces: Moldavia was the third one. Vlad Tepes/  Vlad The Impaler/ Dracula ruled in Wallachia. However, he was born in  Transylvania.",952732800,12,301,5.666666666666667
