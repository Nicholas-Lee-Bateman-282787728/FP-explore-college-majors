8037043,3,B00062IXD8,"Being a fan of John Michell's books, I eagerly anticipated this video and was mildly disappointed. First off, it's way too short with a running time of 45 minutes or so. 90 minutes would have done the job and provided much more information reagarding the 'sacred sites' and their relationship with the stars. In spite of the beautiful footage of Stonehenge, Glastonbury Tor and the landscapes surrounding them, Michell is often hard to understand due to background noise (his interviews are conducted outside) though he does have some insightful commentary.
As far as the 'Atlantis Connection' is concerned, that is indeed misleading as the lost continent is only addressed in a sentence or two.

I would recommend this DVD if only because nothing else like it exists. Fans of John Michell would find it worthwhile but I would recommend reading some of his books (ie. Secrets of the Stones) and then acquriing this DVD as visual supplement if you're so inclined.",1207353600,3,962,4.975155279503106
8037044,1,B00062IXD8,"Goodness what a terrible film. I waited patiently for a point to rise above the chatter, but alas, no point was to be found. The title is a misnomer: Atlantis is mentioned in only two sentences in the entire film, so the promotional copy's promise that ""powerful evidence"" will link the sacred sites with Atlantis is misleading at best. Dowsing and crop circles are mentioned tangentially, but I'm not exactly sure why. The film makes a good case that something freaking is taking place in southern England, but fails to put forth any cohesive argument or any satisfying description of what said freaky thing might be.

Only two sources are cited and they are frequently difficult to understand. Factual errors abound (There are 14 stations of the cross, not 12 as stated in the film) and grand pronouncements are made without any coherent argument. I write this not as a skeptic. I am a firm believer in what I'm pretty sure are pronounced ""lay"" lines (not ""lee"" lines). I write this as a believer who wished the producers could have made more sense of their subject.

The previous reviewer is correct; the original music is good. Buy the soundtrack.",1157241600,9,1151,4.778894472361809
8037045,3,B00062IXD8,This DVD is literally 40 minutes long.  The sound quality is not too good but the New Age background music is pleasant.  The most interesting parts were the diagram of what Stonehenge would have looked like originally and the Ley lines the sacred sites are lined up on.,1148860800,3,269,4.583333333333333
