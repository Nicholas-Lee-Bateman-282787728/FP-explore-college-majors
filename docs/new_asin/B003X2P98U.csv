We watched it on TV two years ago and never remembered the name of it.  A really good holiday movie, so we bought the DVD.

Linda Hamilton's character is a dedicated wife/mother living in a typical neighborhood with her man and sixteen-year-old daughter.
When she discovers that her husband is cheating on her, with a pending-divorce (her husband's assets hidden) she's left with nothing but her
daughter; a car; and a low, monthly, support check. She (Julia) moves into a crappy apartment, and gets a minimum-wage job.
Her daughter hates it, and abandons her for her father [and his new girlfriend]'s new place.
Jullia finally hits the rocks, and finds herself living in a car.
Julia decides to climb back from the pits of hell---and finds what's really important.",1449187200,2,784,4.99236641221374

He tells he wants a divorce she gets the car and child support and then stupidly gives up the house. Dumb, Dumb, Dumb. One night Julie gets mugged and ends up in the hospital. When she gets out of hospital finds an eviction notice on her door. She finds herself sleeping in her car but Julie still hasn't figured out the trouble she's in yet. She hasn't taken the Reality Pill yet. Anyway, another homeless person, a homeless African-American ex-bank manager sees fit to give Julie a heaping helping dose of Reality. Julie meets a single doctor who is instantly smitten with her. Julie studies for her Real Estate License and also get into the best shape of her life.
Julie goes to dinner with the doctor and then they go to the Christmas Dance she put together. Julie runs into her slimy ex-husband and his bimbo.  Ex-husband looks like he's been hit with a 2 by 4 because Julie looks so good and have a new man in her life. Julie is staying at a  white elephant of a house that's overpriced and no one can sell, when her  boss stops by with a couple looking for a new house and decides to buy the house because, Michael decorated the house while she was at the airport waiting for her spoiled daughter. Julie is offered a job and commissions for decorating houses for her boss. Julie and her black friend start Home Sweet Home. All well ends well. Ladies If your husband leave you for a much younger bimbo do this: Get yourself an experienced Woman Lawyer and take his butt to the cleaners. Make sure she gets you the house, car, child support for your kids and make sure she finds all the hidden assets. Cause you know ladies there's always hidden assets. Don't be stupid like Julie Bedford. One last thing I must mention, I'm so proud of Linda Hamilton. She didn't ruin her face with tens of thousands of dollars of plastic surgery. I think Linda Hamilton's ex-husband, Director, James Cameron ended up with a much younger woman too.",1420156800,,2050,4.505376344086022

A spoiled upper class woman gets shocked when her husband (who has piles of money hidden) announced to her that he is leaving her for a younger woman.  She gets only $20,000 for her share of the house and left without a home.  She finds an apartment for her and her daughter only to have the daughter not wanting to give up her friends and life style going back to live with Dad.  Dad had told the daughter he gave her loads of money.  With no experience she gets a small job and then gets mugged coming home and ends up in the hospital for several days.  In the mean time the thieves emptied her bank account, ran up her charge cards and she is locked out of her apartment for failure to pay the rent.  Now living out of her car she turns to a new friend, who also lives out of her car, to help her try and turn her life around.

4215438,4,B003X2P98U,"I like these kinds of Christmas movies -- they have a good feeling to them.  Yes, they are to some extent formulaic -- they use the same basic ideas (in this case someone having a really bad time as Christmas approaches), but I find that the details are always interesting and many times very creative.  And I like watching the actors at work.
  In this movie Julia Bedford has been left out in the cold literally and, after several nasty setbacks (ones that are not her fault), is in a very bad way.  But, with the help of a few new friends, she turns her life around.
  Corny?  I hope so.  It has heart and is a nice movie to spend some time with. I've watched it every holiday season for the past 4 years.  Overall it was a wonderful movie, but, in the spirit of being a critic, I was a little put off by the bit about selling an $800,000 house for a million and a half dollars. I think sometimes the directors lose their nerve and try to make something more important.  Honestly, I thought it was doing fine already.  But it's a minor quibble and I do recommend the movie.",1416009600,,1076,4.220588235294118

I like the movie because it's about starting over when you hit rock bottom. Sometimes you have to lose everything to realize what it is in you that is worth fighting for. People in the same situation as you seem to be the only ones you can lift you out of your depressed state. In the end, you both help each other.

The not-so-young heroine has been left in the lurch by her cheating husband, her teenage daughter has no sympathy for her mother's penniless situation, her purse is stolen, and her only friend in the world is a homeless woman who shows her how to get along. I love their idea of a free ""gym membership,"" and the conversations about previously-donated clothing, ""How deja vu for you."" People helping one another; personal interaction, church, and charity. An upbeat ending after the heart-rending beginning and the friendships, work and successes in-between.

The filmmakers spent so much time setting it up as a heavy handed tragedy complete with a mugging followed by homelessness, that when they arbitrarily decided to switch gears and slap in some comic bits I was left wondering just what their intentions were in the first place; fun adventure or sad state of affairs?  They also seemed to celebrate accomplished liars, denial, and a convenient plot point in the guise of the knight in shining armor.  If they had unflinchingly dealt with the plight of the homeless that would have been something in their favor, but they didn't go that route.  Instead, they gave us a fragmented look at marriage, thankless daughters, and a quick recovery.  That all of this was stuck in a Christmas setting only added to the confusion.",1356739200,2,825,4.741258741258742

It is about a woman who finds herself divorced and living on her own with a teen that doesn't quite understand what happened and thinks more about how the separation between Mom and Dad affects her with little thought about how her Dad has left her Mom alone and fending for herself after years of being a homemaker.  But Linda Hamilton's character doesn't let her circumstances get her down for long; after meeting another woman in similar circumstances, Hamilton's character realizes that she can either feel sorry for herself and wallow in her self-pity or she can raise herself up by her bootstraps and turn her life around...which she does very cleverly.  Together, she and the other homeless woman work to help each other out of their doldrums and by the end of the movie, they have turned their lives around and have started a business of their own together, making other people's dreams come true!

The story and Linda Hamilton's performance quickly win over your empathy, and you root for her all the way.  There are other nice characters, and a situation you want to see any good person overcome.  Frankly the idea that a person over 40 can start over and still reach a comfortable position that allows them to make a living from something they enjoy and have a talent for, is something I really hope is true.

I know, I know, it is somewhat corny and the daughter needs some lessons in humility and appreciation, the ex-husband deserves his childish new wife, but it is still worth watching.  Linda Hamilton's character is somewhat naive and weak, but grows in determination and ability to survive some of the tough issues that come her way.

Linda Hamilton does an excellent job portraying the devastation that is the reality of an unexpected divorce.  However, she also conveys well that good consequences follow good decisions if paired with determination and a refusal to give up.

4215657,4,B003X2P98U,"At one time, women were financially taken care of by their husbands. After rearing the children, they had time to volunteer for charities. Too many criticisms seem to fall into the category of Julie being dense and incapable of recovering on her own. This movie reminds me of how many women in real circumstances get dumped or abused.
Can you imagine the shock of being suddenly abandoned, by a spouse who arranged everything in advance to cripple you from fighting back? Shock and disbelief slows anyone. I thought it was obvious that this was what he planned. This movie is an example of what happens to many women, who suddenly find themselves without a spouse, without an income, without true friends or close family. Facing all this while trying to hang on to some scrap of dignity is hard. For some women it's unthinkable to receive charity when they were the ones who proudly gave to charity.
Can you imagine trying to sneak a quick wash up in a Wal-Mart restroom, lingering in a public building just to keep warm? Or, going from grocery to grocery to eat sample food? There are women who absolutely would refuse welfare, or help from judgemental family in desperate hope to rise above their situation.
While surviving, Julie does meet a man, and yes, he looks to be a decent person for her in the future, but in her abrupt change of circumstances, and with her own grit and determination, she survives.
Toward the end of the movie, I saw her future as looking more secure, using her untapped talents and gaining employment. She began to live again, without wallowing in self pity and seeking revenge.",1325030400,13,1608,4.705673758865248

That was not the worst part, I couldn't remember the name of the movie to order it from Amazon.  So, I went through all of the Christmas movies, one-by-one, reading, sorting, eliminating until somewhere near the end of the list when ""Home By Christmas"" showed up.

4215660,3,B003X2P98U,"Why is it that a woman is expected to suspend reality and become completely brain dead to watch a romance movie? Maybe I just answered my own question when I added in the term romance movie.

Linda Hamilton plays Julie a woman who has just realized that her husband is seeing a much younger woman. Now this is where the viewer is expected to become dumb. Julie lives in an upper income community and only accepts $25,000 as her half equity in the home and asks for no alimony. Moves into a questionable neighborhood, gets behind on her bills (where is the money). Gets mugged, goes to the hospital and has no medical insurance, loses her checkbook and credit cards, is evicted from her apartment for being one week late with the rent, bank takes an unprecedented amount of time in refunding the stolen funds. Sleeps in a car. Squats in an unoccupied open house. Orthopedic surgeon rides in and saves the day. The End.

Really?

Who believes this stuff and feels good after a movie like this? Now look around, whom do you know that has had their life fall out from underneath them and a knight rides in and saves the day?

This is why I cannot watch movies like this. I guess I need a bit more reality and a lot less fluff to set the example that a woman can pick herself up by her proverbial bootstraps and make it on her own.",1324166400,8,1326,4.3562753036437245

After a series of unfortunate events, she becomes homeless.  She makes some new friends and with their help she is able to pull herself up by her bootstraps, so to speak, and begins a new life.  Some elements of the story may be somewhat far fetched, but it is just that, a story.  When my wife and I watch the film, it makes us feel good.  I mean, come on, who doesn't love a happy ending?

We generally screen what we watch because the profanity and nudity in today's media is clearly overdone. It was nice to watch a movie that was a little more family friendly yet still entertaining.

Lastly, we found it realistic when the bank and the hospital were less than helpful during her times of need. Sadly, we once endured similar circumstances. This movie was a reminder about how successful we've now become. It creates a sense of gratefulness.

4215668,5,B003X2P98U,Another wonderfully clean family movie.  Clean language and very sweet story.  Enjoy with all your family and friends.  Watch with your church youth group.  It's that good.  Thanks amazon.com,1297296000,3,191,5.448275862068965
4215669,5,B003X2P98U,"Although not in the class of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO(my all time favorite survivor story) and HATCHET by Gary Paulson, Home By Christmas is a great story of two affluent, intelligent, if slightly naive, women suddenly forced to live on the street and sleep in their cars. By putting their oh-poor-me attitudes aside and their brains in gear, they use readily available free resources to remake themselves and climb out of their situation.  That it has a love story attached to it only makes it more fun for me.  This video is more than a Christmas Romance it's a naive, but thoughtful survival story.",1296604800,21,602,4.723809523809524
4215670,4,B003X2P98U,"If you've ever gone through some trial in your life that let you know beyond a shadow of a doubt who your real friends are and what is ultimately important in life, Home By Christmas is certainly a movie you should not miss.  Any one of us could be faced by a sudden reduction of our circumstances, but it's how we learn to handle these circumstances that really counts.

I generally love Christmas movies any time of year, because of the theme of hope and renewal. Home By Christmas  may not be the best one ever made, but the story will give you a sense that you can survive, no matter what comes your way.",1296259200,6,608,4.269565217391304
4215671,5,B003X2P98U,"This movie showed that each one of us could be a smalls step away from homelessness and financial ruin.  But it is motivational in what you can do to change your circumstances.  It is sweet, funny, and has a wonderfully happy ending!",1295481600,7,233,4.523809523809524
4215672,5,B003X2P98U,"First watched this on tv........between commercials.......!

It's much better without the advertising breaking up the progression of the story.

Very believable, and real........it could happen to anyone, although, we hope it never does,and the outcome easy to believe.

Linda Hamilton does a very good job in relaying this message.",1295049600,8,332,5.73469387755102
4215683,5,B003X2P98U,This is a wonderful movie about a woman having to start over and who are your real friends when your marriage ends and you no longer have a lot of money. Linda Hamilton is wonderful as the wife who has to start over and what she learns along the way is great. Really enjoyed this movie and was happy to be able to get it so quickly and cheaply.,1293926400,6,344,4.0
4215684,5,B003X2P98U,"Of all my Christmas movies, this was my favorite ~ A delight and as usual, Linda Hamilton gives a great performance. This was filmed in Langley, BC and it was nice to point out some areas I was used to seeing. She also stars in ""Silent Night"" another keeper. Very clean, family oriented viewing and a great message. Way to go Lifetime--no agendas, nothing thrown-in for shock value, just a very well-acted, well directed feel-good movie.",1293840000,4,437,4.7631578947368425
4215685,1,B003X2P98U,"It is hard to imagine why such a talented actress would agree to make such a bad movie.  Particularly just a year after making ""Silent Night"" - an extraordinary film by every measure possible.

The idea of going from rich to homeless to successful is interesting but the execution of the concept was terrible.  No one living a comfortable life would consider $25,000 ""a small fortune"" and accept so little as a divorce settlement.  Linda Hamilton's hair and clothing were so bad that they were a distraction throughout the movie.  The ex-husband's new girlfriend was so unbelievable that the relationship was laughable and totally lacking in chemistry.  Nothing in the movie had a base in reality.  Time and time again, my wife and I would look at each other and say ""NO way!""  We have had many bad experiences and struggled financially but nothing in this movie touched a nerve.  We were bored to tears and greatly disappointed.",1293580800,5,929,4.829113924050633

4215688,4,B003X2P98U,"We had seen this movie several times before.  But we decided to get it on DVD so it can become part of our family Christmas traditions.
We really enjoy having special movies that we watch each year and this is now one of them.  It is the story of a woman who truly hits bottom just
before Christmas.  But with help from a new friend, her new friend's church and some dedication on her part, she comes up a winner - just in time for Christmas
and a visit with her daughter. She even finds a new love through her down time and by helping his father.",1292630400,5,547,4.093457943925234
4215689,2,B003X2P98U,"What was believable in this movie was how fast the divorce took this woman down.  She didn't seem to come with any common sense -- which would have her hire a great lawyer in the first place, not to mention keep money in a secret account.  But what wasn't believable even for a Christmas movie, was that people kept saying how pretty she was when in fact she looked terrible.  What was that hairdo supposed to do?  Also, were we to believe she didn't know how to wash and style her own hair??  Also what wasn't believable was that she had no resources of friends, and didn't use the one (the old man) she had.  It was a shame that she had to play Cinderella instead of a person who finds their own strength.  I much preferred her homeless friend, but don't believe that she wouldn't have just taken menial work and be done with it.  Oh well, back to Scrouge and the ghosts, all believable.",1292371200,5,889,4.313253012048193

I also wondered how homeless women who slept in their cars could look so clean and well groomed. Where did they take a shower at, and how did Julie put gas in her car? If she could buy gas, she could have bought a blanket.",1499558400,,385,4.012987012987013
8407724,5,B003X2P98U,I really like this movie. The beginning is kind of corny and the first quarter of an hour is really depressing but if you can get past the first 15-20 minutes or so it is TOTALLY worth it. This is one of my fav movies for Christmas and really for any time. I'd call it a bit of a Cinderella story. Touching and well acted. Linda Hamilton is really good in this role.,1496793600,2,366,4.027397260273973
