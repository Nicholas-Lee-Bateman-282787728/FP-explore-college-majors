8325615,4,B000PUB5AE,"As a Henry B. Walthall fan, I had to have this 1932 gem and got it on video years ago.  I still had to pick up this DVD mostly because of the colorful packaging.  In addition to the handsome cover artwork, there is a photo of Walthall on the back, on the spine, and on the disc!  Great packaging!  The quality of the film-viewing is fair as sometimes faces are washed out but the price you can get it for with just a little shopping around is incredible.  I don't know how they make anything on it.

This film offers one of the few leading roles for Walthall, the leading man in D.W. Griffith's epoch ""Birth of a Nation,"" in the Talkies era. Boy is it a good one! Walthall plays Nat Barry, once a great actor who finds himself in a Police Court charged with being an ""habitual drunkard."" The judge is about to lower the boom until Barry's devoted son (played with ""gee that's swell"" sappiness by Leon Janney) rushes in and successfully pleads for the court to give the former star a second chance. The son takes care of Nat, finding work for him (Nat ends up playing Lincoln and General Lee at a sleazy carnival), even giving him a shave. The boy remains convinced that his father will rise to the top of the acting profession again.

The scenes where Nat breaks down, especially his last scene, are very well-done. The emotion and passion in his face and voice reveals his character's unrelenting anguish. Definitely one of Walthall's best performance of the Talkies. Nat's final scene is also a little spooky, considering that Walthall would collapse and later die in real life during the filming of ""China Clipper.""

I have a publicity paper for this film.  It is interesting the ways the film company proposed theatres promote this picture.  Because of Janney's character, they thought it was ideal for Boy Scouts (I guess every boy scout should know how to shave an unconscious man).  They tried to have it endorsed by women's clubs because the film demonstrated parental devotion as well as the evils of drink.  Other ""exploitation tips"" encouraged inviting the local police department to the opening matinee, or having a guy wear a sandwich sign outside the theatre that read ""You Are Wanted At Police Court."" Find out what all the hubbub was about and check out ""Police Court.""",1230681600,,2285,4.614814814814815
8325616,5,B000PUB5AE,"This film gets five stars from me for a very specific reason--because it features, in a strong supporting role, the silent movie star KING BAGGOT, whose name is lost to time, but who, in his heyday, was as well-known around the globe as George Clooney, and viewed with similar regard--Baggot excelled in both romantic and comedic roles.

Unfortunately, much of his work is lost to time.  I've only seen two of his silent pictures, which are available through the FILMMUSEUM of the Netherlands--two short efforts (one incomplete) made at Independent Motion Pictures (IMP) around 1911.  These examples also feature Baggot's good friend William Robert Daly, another superb yet underappreciated silent film actor whose many film contributions have gone up in flames.

  I bought this film specifically because I wanted to see how well King Baggot transitioned to talkies, and I must say, he acquitted himself brilliantly.  He didn't ""overact"" as a silent film star, and he doesn't overact in this talkie, either.  His voice transitions well, too. He's the most ""normal"" looking fellow on the screen--a believable character.

As for this film, it is what it is.  It's hokey, it's old fashioned, it's schlocky.  Iit's got the earnest, ""too mature,"" and excessively adorable young lad, the drunken father-actor who cannot hold a job, the kindly yet firm judge (a pre-code prostitute is featured briefly as a defendant in court at the start of the picture), and regrettably, in a small role, the almost obligato, shuffling black defendant (Fred ""Snowflake"" Toones--I hope they paid him well, at least) who speaks in the most stereotypical manner imaginable (his purpose is comedic effect) and a formulaic story line.

 Drunken dad is a continual disappointment, an embarrassment, and oh, what a shame-- he used to be SUCH a great actor.  How can he possibly redeem himself in the eyes of his adorable blond son and society at large?  The film answers that very question.

The quality of the copy is ""iffy,"" but entirely viewable.  I got it secondhand and found it to be a great value at that price.  I've loaned it out to others who come back with the assessment ""Surprisingly enjoyable--for what it is.""

Don't expect ""Gone With The Wind"" or any high drama.  It's a schlocky little black and white, early (1932) talkie,  ""B"" movie with a melodramatic script, a touch of overacting here and there, but a great feature role by King Baggot, his characteristic shock of white hair that he sported even in his younger years plainly visible,  still working as a talkie actor, though no longer a romantic lead.  For that, alone, it's a gem!",1217289600,,2626,4.9588100686498855
