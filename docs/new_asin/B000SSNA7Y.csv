8206654,5,B000SSNA7Y,"I just saw the Martin Scorsese's 2016 movie entitled ""Silence"" starring Andrew Garfield,Adam Driver and Liam Neeson after this review is being written. I did not realize that there was an original Japanese film entitled ""Chinmoku"",also known as ""Silence"" that was released back in 1971. I was fortunate to see it on a website that has Asian movies. Luckily was able to see it a couple of times to make a review and compare it with the Hollywood version.

""Chimoku""(a.k.a Silence) is a Japanese film that was one based on the 1966 novel written by Shsaku End with the same title. It stars David Lampson,Don Kenny,Tetsur Tamba and Shima Iwashita. Few scenes have dialogues that were English. It tells the story of two 17th century Portuguese priests,Fathers Sebastian Rodrigo and Francisco Garrpe,who went to Japan to search for their mentor Fr. Cristvo Ferreira,who has never contacted them for the last five years. Added to that,they also intend to evangelize and spread Christianity particularly Roman Catholicism.

Before going any further,I would like to say that Scorsese made a remake of this film just like when he did ""The Departed"" which was basically a remake of the Chinese film,""The Infernal Affairs"" instead of saying that he made a film based on novel by End. Evidently,this was a little known film. Added to that,there was very little difference made as far as majority of the scenes and the dialogues are concerned. Only a few changes in the conclusion particularly the final scene was made and possibly the running time considering that Scorsese's film is 30 minutes longer.

Director Masahiro Shinoda did a wonderful job in exploring various themes in this little known film that includes the possibility of Christianity in Japan which up to now remains a religion of the minority;cultural difference between Asians and Europeans;faith in the face of oppression as well as the conflict between human needs as well as emotional needs against divine nature;human weaknesses and suffering; psychological make-up and emotional content.

We get to see the cultural difference between the Europeans and the Japanese and was taken into consideration especially when the Portuguese priests arrived into a village where there are many Japanese Christians. This was also taken into consideration in the complex character Kichijiro,who continues to do what the Japanese soldiers would want him to do particularly in degrading Christian statues and carvings as well as trying to pinpoint at Christians whether they are priests or Japanese villagers but deep inside has probably maintained a Christian. Added to that,we also realize the Japanese intense love for their culture,pride and nationalism which remains true today. This was evident among Japanese villagers who became martyrs and gave up their life instead of abandoning their Christian faith as well as the Japanese persecutors who would not want their culture to get influenced from the outside particularly the West.

There were also a lot of interesting scenes between Fr. Ferreira and Fr. Rodrigo with the former confirming that he has apparently apostatized from his Catholic faith and the latter going through intense suffering after undergoing torture from the Japanese soldiers to convince him into renouncing his faith. The needs of divine nature and human nature was clearly explored including the nature of God particularly His silence and make His presence felt.

Finally,it was also worthy to note the changes that both priest have undergone with Fr. Ferreira embracing Japanese culture and Fr. Rodrigo's dark psychological make-up when he finally decided to apostatize when he possibly knew that what he did was not just a formality to save his life but a conversion was indeed going to take place whether he likes it or not. It was clearly seen that there is lack of content and happiness on their part.

Overall,this was a great film. I even it consider a lot better than the Scorsese's 2016 version. All themes were clearly explored unlike the 2016 version wherein there were some themes that weren't explored very well. Screenwriters - author Shsaku End and director Masahiro Shinoda - did a wonderful job of writing the screenplay. Definitely, the viewers will be divided upon seeing this film particularly Christians. But I sincerely believe that the themes were presented fairly whether one dies rather than abandoning one's faith or one apostatizes in order to save one's life. The pros and cons were clearly explored.",1488758400,3,4505,5.188445667125172

8206656,1,B000SSNA7Y,"I love some of this directors films: Pale Flower, Samauri spy, and Double Suicide all are facinating and inovative. ""Silence"" is horrible. It has alwful production values, worse acting, and seems to be purely a piece of third rate christian propaganda. Avoid Avoid Avoid.",1393977600,2,271,5.181818181818182
8206657,5,B000SSNA7Y,Criterion needs to bring this film to a USA format. I just read the excellent book. I note that Martin Scorsese will release his film version of the novel in 2015.,1377302400,3,163,4.290322580645161
