3964206,5,B002PCVLWW,"This is a great movie! I was able to catch it during DC's Reel Affirmations and I laughed my back side off thru the movie, well except for one scene where I was crying like a school girl. The movie is very straight friendly which is nice as I can recommend the movie to many of my friends. The music is incrediable. Big bear hugz to the cast, crew, writers and everyone else who was a part of the movie!!",1257811200,8,404,4.0625
3964207,5,B002PCVLWW,"The college dorm's resident ""out and proud"" gay couple, Olaf (""Gunn"") and Nathan, are going home to spend Christmas with their respective families, and those families couldn't be more different. Whereas ""trust fund baby"" Nathan's parents are rather cold, status-seeking yuppies, Olaf's parents are a couple of former hippies who start decorating their home for the holidays months before.  When Nathan's parents stand him up to go on a holiday cruise, he decides to surprise Olaf by joining him at his parents, only to find out that his parents have no clue that he is gay.  Nathan immediately tries to ""butch it up"" a bit, but is disappointed and hurt that Olaf is unable - more like unwilling - to introduce him as his boyfriend.

A sweet and engaging, though somewhat corny, story about honesty, self-acceptance and - ultimately - the meaning of love.  Newcomer Keith Jordan does a first-rate job as the emotionally conflicted Olaf, and is surrounded by an excellent cast of veteran character actors, including Derek Long (""3-Day Weekend"" and several other gay films) as Olaf's stoner dad, actress/voiceover artist Kelly Keaton as his jolly mother, Hallee Hirsh (who played Dr. Greene's daughter on ""ER"") as Olaf's supposed girlfriend Abby, Alison Arngrin (best know as Nellie Olsen on ""Little House on the Prairie"") as Abby's mom, Gates McFadden (Dr. Beverly Crusher on ""Star Trek: TNG"") as Nathan's mom, and Adamo Ruggiero (Marco for five seasons on ""Degrassi: The Next Generation"") as Nathan. The direction and technical aspects seem flawless, and there are even a half dozen or so original songs on the soundtrack. DVD isn't rated, but would likely be PG; definitely a film you could (and should) share with your parents and younger siblings.  Popular at several gay film festivals, and in a limited theatrical run, this just might become a timeless gay holiday classic.  Watch out for the mistletoe over the doorway, and I give ""Yuletide"" a full five stars out of five.",1257552000,39,1977,5.012195121951219
3964218,5,B002PCVLWW,"This movie is most humorous in its use of 'American English' idioms with definitions pertaining to sex.  The plot is complete with comical twists and turns that surprise the viewer.  The film brilliantly illustrates how a ""family member's sexual orientation being a secret"" can place unnecessary hardships on individuals, even in 2017, during a major Holiday family gathering.  Allow this film to entertain you with somewhat slapstick comedic use dialogue -- the movie can be a refreshing break from films that address topics through dark humor, horror or violence.  There's a time and place for films of every intensity. :-)",1510099200,,625,5.22

3964260,5,B002PCVLWW,"Extremely well written gay romantic comedy.  It would be wonderful if everyone's parents were like those in this movie.  College son returns home for Christmas holiday, planning on finally coming out to his parents.  His partners parents bail on him for the holidays, so he decides to join the family celebration, unannounced.  A few twists and turns, and many laughing points.  This would be a good ""educating"" movie for GLTBQA Christmas issues.  My only complaint is that the audio track for most of the movie is very quiet, so you have to crank it up to hear.  The menu loop is very loud, movie starts OK, very loud song at the 7 minute mark, when that concludes, it gets pretty low.  Just remember at the end of the movie to turn the volume down, 'cause the menu will blast you out.",1469318400,2,786,4.524822695035461

3964272,1,B002PCVLWW,"They try really hard, and their heart is in the right place, but this isn't even an average movie.

First, the positives. The two lead actors (Keith Jordan and Adamo Ruggiero) are cute and do a good job. Alison Arngrim is great as the slutty housewife neighbour (yes, there's one of those). And for a low budget feature, the production values are good - there aren't the usual problems of poor sound etc.

That's it. There isn't a lot else to cheer about. This isn't a funny movie. I love innuendo, and there's plenty of it here, but everything is agonisingly laboured, the timing always off. You can see every ""joke"" coming from a mile off.

The film isn't even sure if it wants to be a comedy. Tonally, it's all over the place. The main story is a tortuous coming out story. Note to the writer: it isn't the '90s anymore. This story - or, at least, this telling of it - is hopelessly out of date, something some nice, middle aged suburban queens have put together on weekends. What was the pitch - nice white college boy has to face the agony of coming out to his nice white parents (who aren't even written as conservative or Christian). Really?

At just one hour and twenty-four minutes, Make The Yuletide Gay still felt overlong. I was desperate for something unexpected to happen, and when it was clear that wasn't going to happen, I was just desperate for it to end... Like that boring relative who overstays their welcome, or that gift that makes you go ""meh""...",1451174400,,1470,4.49438202247191

But I still enjoyed the movie a lot and laughed quite often. I liked the main lead's female friend from home especially. It had charm and was a little off kilter which I like. So if you want a somewhat funny, pretty charming movie that follows the story but veers interestingly here and there then buy it. And the two male leads are cute which never hurts.",1431907200,2,512,4.13

3964295,5,B002PCVLWW,One of my all-time favorite Christmas movies.,1424649600,,45,5.571428571428571
3964296,4,B002PCVLWW,"I was pleasantly surprised at this movie; it was silly, touching, and oddly very satisfying. Oh, by the way, it's funny. Sometimes acidly funny, sometimes screamingly funny, and sometimes just surprisingly funny. Moreover, it's a love story. A Christmas love story. A Gay Christmas love story that, in my opinion, crosses orientation boundaries and could well become a classic. The plot is pretty simple; a gay couple of college students, Gunn and Nathan, are heading home for the holidays. Gunn is going back to his middle-class suburban, albeit slightly off-center, family where he's still solidly in the closet. Nathan's parents are wealthy, socially prominent, and have made holiday plans that do not include their gay son whom they know about, but it just isn't discussed. Faced with being stranded alone over Christmas, Nathan turns up at Gunn's house. That's when the fun starts. Gunn and Nathan try to maintain the ""just roommates"" faade, while trying to maintain and accept their own relationship and reality. This comedy is a farce, yet it's also quite tender and serious. Gunn faces having to out himself to his family and friends. Nathan learns that ""family"" is also a matter of choice not just biology. The pace is rapid, but not too fast. The dialogue ranges from groan-inducing innuendo to laugh-out-loud exchanges. And the ending -- well, it's a Christmas Love story. By the time you get to the end, you're engaged with all the characters on their own terms, and it's satisfying, touching, and fit without being saccharine. It's a great movie for the holidays, or to make any day a celebration of life, of choice, and of love.",1424044800,5,1642,4.974545454545455

The characters are so real and remind me of friends I have had the joy of knowing.( I used to live in Northern Minnesota ) the film gently expresses the fear and concern of losing the love of one's family. We all are aware of the importance of family, and for some the thought of losing that  love is overwhelming. It is truly unfortunate that when we do not fit  the mold/characteristics our parents/family expect, we are often abused and removed from those we love most. This film is happy, a little sad, and embodies the real meaning of Christmas. The music is absolutely fabulous written and performed by Jake Monaco.",1393977600,2,641,4.565217391304348

3964390,4,B002PCVLWW,"Overall, I found this to be a very entertaining film about a cute young couple, 'Nathan' and 'Gunn', that made me smile.

I was delighted by the festive holiday music, much of it original, as well as the decorations and celebratory activities in which the characters were engaged. It was also a treat to see Alison Arngrim who played ""Nellie Oleson"" on the legendary series ""Little House on the Prairie"".

I would give this movie 5 stars except for one problem.  To be totally honest, the comments and demeanor of Gunn's parents, Anya and Sven (played by Kelly Keaton and Derek Long) are rather nauseating throughout the film.  Anya is an airhead whose incessant giggling and verbal diarrhea are extremely irritating, and Sven is a burnt out pothead whose moronic utterances render his character virtually insufferable.

Nevertheless, they are harmless characters with a zest for life, especially in contrast to Nathan's parents who seem so cold and distant towards him, and I found them much more redeeming by the end of the film.

Watching this film along with ""Scrooge and Marley"" and ""Regarding Billy"" will be new annual holiday treat at my house.",1358294400,,1151,4.937823834196891

Well, surprise! It was a story that included lame innuendos and puns, really stupid character acting (the main character's ""Swedish"" parents were true simpletons) and the ""Oops, I forgot to tell you I wasn't out with my parents"" scene between the boyfriends when the flamer pays a surprise visit to his closeted bf was ridiculous. The ONLY saving grace was the fact the boys you see on the DVD cover are both cute (though I'm pretty sure one is straight, playing gay) and their acting abilities fair. Do NOT buy this film. Instead if you are curious at all, rent it or look for it at my summer yard sale. It'll be the DVD priced 5 cents.",1356480000,2,808,4.357615894039735

I did skip the previews on the DVD as they seemed more racy. The movie itself is great. I won't go into details too much because you can watch the trailer on amazon instant video. However, I will say it is about a young guy who needs to come out of the closet to his parents and ends up doing so in a movie with a great deal of tact, humor and ultimately love involved. It is not something I thought I would be interested in, truly but I watched the trailer and ended up buying the instant movie last year and purchasing the DVD this year because I just LOVE it.

When it comes to coming out movies, I don't expect much.
When it comes to Xmas movies, I don't expect much either.
When it comes to both genres, they are pretty predictable and corny.

But ""Make the Yuletide Gay"" is a pretty good.  The premise wasn't that original, but it was not boring, and it was it entertaining.  And if a movie can be entertaining, it met one of the main requirements.  This isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it's a fun gay Xmas movie.
The parents are hoot with their mock Minnesotan and Wisconsinite accents, and there are some fun scenes.  Gun makes his reluctance to not come out to his parents known, and for any gay person they understand the motivation and fear to stay quiet.

As long as you aren't expecting phenomenal acting performances and can handle a good dose of cheese-comedy, you're sure to be satisfied. The soundtrack is incredibly good and the whole experience is a jolly, funloving good time - everything you could possibly want from a Christmas movie.

As for the blu ray, I consider myself pretty particular about my screen presentation and wasn't too upset. It doesn't look incredibly HD, and probably isn't much better than the DVD, but I don't think the transfer actually hurt the experience. But again, this isn't a movie to take seriously. It's just really, really cute and feel-good. I recommend it.",1342569600,,817,4.877697841726619
3964411,4,B002PCVLWW,"A sweet or really fabulous film on coming out; not in the world which is college for the two boys (That was done a long time ago and everyone knows about it), but in their families. On one side Olaf has to reveal his parents he is gay, on the other side Nathan has to reveal his family he has a boy friend. Both are hard, both situations and probably both boys too. One has to be done face to face. The other has to be done on an answering machine that will only be listened to three weeks later.

But the film is not only fabulous because of these last five minutes but because all along it is innuendo upon innuendo and it never ends. We believe up to those last five minutes that it is pure innocence if not simple-mindedness on Olaf's parents' side, but it is true there is some humour when people who play straight 100% start telling you that ""If you put enough meat in a man's mouth, he is happy"". And there is also some humour when the two boys confronted with sharing the same room and bunk beds the one like the other both pretend that they both like to be on top, and the poor mother does not seem to catch the very direct meaning.

The best part is not about the film. It is about the quotes from this film given by cinema sites: I have not found one single of these funny remarks that are funny because of their double-entendre. Why on earth are some people shy about it, even when it does not concern them directly? I wonder. That is not modesty at all but guilt somewhere, and probably rejection.

The film is probably not going to revolutionize our way of looking at gay people coming out of the famous closet, and it is probably not that simple and easy to do. But it is a funny film that reveals how two men can really love each other just because they love each other and there is no explanation for love. It is just beautiful and hot, indeed, burning hot. ""All you need is love!"" Quoted in the film.

And even if it is true we are always amazed how well most people are able to accept love, no matter what kind of love it is because there are always a few who will become brutal and aggressive just for the fun and the anger of blowing up a gay man.

I cannot understand why so many people can only see that love can only be straight, whereas love can be mental, artistic, musical, sentimental, passionate, gay, straight or LGBT. And there is no obligation for that love to be hormonal at all. We can, we must, we should love many people for all types of reason and in all types of way, each form of love reinforcing all other forms. Just loving another person is the most beautiful thing in the world and the phenomenal transformation it operates in one's mind and way of looking at the world is a good enough reason to accept and even worship every and any form of love.

And a love affair can always be carried out to its acme between two sheets of paper in a book, or two prints from the 18th century or two blankets of silky thinking on the latest physical discovery about how protons, neutrinos, electrons, and so many other photons can spend their whole life chasing one another and yet never meeting and having any kind of a direct physical encounter.

3964415,5,B002PCVLWW,"First let me say, this is another GUEST HOUSE FILMS production, which means it is perfect in my opinion.  I have yet to see a bad movie made by them.  Anyway, I kind of hate to admit the fact that I loved this movie so much, I watched it at least 2 maybe 3 times a day since Thanksgiving.
In fact I had to just order another copy, because mine is starting to wear out.
The acting is excellent, Derek Long is great, he made this right after 3 Day Weekend, and to see the contrast between the two parts shows what a great actor he is, And he is H.O.T.  Kelly Keaton is a laugh a minute, although she does tend to step on others lines and she is not that old, but she is silly.  Alison Arngrim is great as the bitchy neighbor, but she can be a bit of a Nellie.
Gates Mcfadden and Ian Buchanan are wonderful as the wealthy parents who go on a Christmas Cruise without their son, because there just weren't any other cabins available.  Halee Hirsh shows what a fine young actress she is going from Miss Prim and Proper to Gay boy's best friend, air kisses.
Adamo Ruggiero and Keith Jordan really have chemistry.  They actually look as if they are in love.
What I do like, which some didn't is all the double inuendos.  The film is filled with them and they are really funny.  And I like the fact that Gunn and Nathan are two guys that will probably be together for life.",1325808000,,1365,4.143939393939394
3964416,4,B002PCVLWW,"The writing of the movie was pretty interesting. I say interesting instead of good or great since there was clearly a certain amount of intelligence and wit involved in a lot of the lines (e.g. ""So you're friends of Dorothy"" - but in reference to a local girl named Dorothy) but delivery was weird and flat. I surmise it was an attempt at more deadpan delivery so the jokes weren't too campy. But they happened so often throughout everyone's dialog (especially the parents) that that in itself became campy.

Beyond the jokes, I liked how the story wasn't overly predictable. Sure, it had a number of the tropes that we can associate with either LGBT movies or holiday movies, but it all still worked together. The relationship between Olaf and Nathan felt real enough plus the added complications of the differences in their social classes relative to their families's wealth was an interesting addition that didn't feel too forced or preachy. And that's not exactly an easy balance to strike.

I appreciate how the movie avoided a lot of the dumber tropes of queer films like relying too much on casting really beautiful / attractive people who really can't act all that well. Sure, I can appreciate a hot body as much as the next guy but I'd rather have a good story instead of a lot of shirtless posing here and there. And this movie did its best to deliver more substance that polish, although I wouldn't immediately say that this movie is the type that can become a TV special to air during the holidays.",1324771200,2,1510,4.651685393258427

I own over 200 Blu Ray discs and this is the single worst I have ever seen.  The DVD is better image quality than this disc.  I didn't know it was possible to take such a high quality format to such a low performance level.

The movie has been grotesquely over corrected with noise reduction and edge enhancements.  Portions of it look almost like a comic book due to lack of detail in darker areas. Didn't anybody actually watch this before approving its release?  I would return it except that it is not the sellers fault that the studio released such poor quality.

The sound quality is excellent.

I really like this movie; I think it is one of Mr. Williams best.  I was really looking forward to the Blu Ray but will now stick to the DVD for any future viewings.",1323561600,5,830,4.235668789808917
3964419,4,B002PCVLWW,"Main actor Keith Jordan is talented and attractive too, reminding me of a younger Jake Gyllenhaal, probably not a coincidence.  His co-star and love interest in the movie, Adamo Ruggiero, is convicing enough and cute.  Hallee Hirsh plays the nice-girl-gone-wild/confidant next-door neighbor very well.  I don't know these three but will watch for them going forward.  Sets are OK after the beginning, sound is good, lighting good, editing good, but script and especially directing and/or acting on the part of the parents leaves us often in disbelief.  The central character's mom, played by Kelly Keaton, is supposed to be over the top, but it's often too much and distracts from the movie.  The dad, played by Derek Long, is even worse, with inconsistent character behavior that again goes well beyond the intended fragmented behavior the dad is supposed to exhibit (case in point:  dad can't open his eyes in his first scene without the use of eyeglasses, but later is walking downtown streets and looking at people with normal vision sans eyeglasses)  Oh, it was really great to see Gates McFadden, but too bad she had such very quick and rather minor cameo appearances.  In the version I bought, however, she had the closing scene.
OK, enough of the criticism.  This is still a touching film and if you can handle the slightly less than Grade A, I recommend it.
Ah, interesting, I see IMDB mentions a sequel coming out in 2012.  Same main three actors, set one year later.  Gotta check it out!",1323216000,3,1498,4.854330708661418

My mistake was purchasing this DVD for my collection. It is painful to watch. The characters are not believable. The chemistry between the gay boyfriends is very weak. The protagonist's mother punctuates most every one of her lines with a nauseating laugh/ giggle that may be cute the first or second time but quickly grated on this viewer not unlike the sound of fingernails being dragged across a chalk board. Near the end of the film the reaction of parents to their son coming out is so absurd it lowers the film to rock bottom. For those of you unfortunate enough to suffer through viewing this trainwreck I will not reveal any of the ""surprises"" it contains. However, your time might be better spent viewing ""Ishtar""  or George Lucas' ""Howard The Duck"" both considered among the worst films of the 20th century.",1308355200,3,963,4.631578947368421

3964438,5,B002PCVLWW,"This movie is very reminiscent of ""Meet the Parents"" and ""Guess Who.""  The story centers around Olaf ""Gun"" Gununderson.  He's a gay college student who's out on campus, but not at home.  When Christmas break lets out, Gun and his boyfriend Nathan (played by Degrassi's Adamo Ruggiero) say goodbye thinking they won't see each other for the break and thus keeping Gun's secret.  However, hilarity ensues as Nathan has a change of plans and ends up on the Gununderson's doorway a few days before Christmas.  This movie is not a deep, emotional, change the world type film, but it is very entertaining and funny with moments of pure honesty and emotion spread throughout.  This film is definitely a feel good movie with the power to make you laugh and at the same time become emotionally invested.  Ruggiero puts on a great performance that seems effortless and Keith Jordan (Gun) brings to light the frustrations and fear of coming out to one's family while at the same time portraying a very out and proud gay activist on campus.  This film is definitely worth a watch and the characters will make you fall in love with them.",1297209600,10,1124,4.728205128205128

I am so glad I bought this movie and got it before christmas.  As soon as I watched it, brought a smile to my face and brightened my whole night.  Watched it at least twice so far and plan to watch it again tomorrow.

This movies a pure joy to see two young man really fall in love and see it blossom throughout.  Gay movies are finally having more meaning and its great to see, FINALLY.

Kind of fluffy at moments, and the characters mother is bubbly.  But, I loved all of them.  Thanks to the actors and producers, you brightened my holidays!!",1292544000,4,707,4.4186046511627906

3964441,5,B002PCVLWW,I stumbled upon this movie quite by accident just browsing gay movies here on amazon thought it sounded like a cute premise for a movie. I decided to give it a shot and buy it. I'm so glad I did. This has quickly become one of my very favorite movies. It was one of the most engaging movies I've seen in along time. This is one of those very few movies that when it's over you don't want this movie to end because you are so invested in these characters. The story is beautiful and about love and really learning the meaning of love and loving yourself. I was quite surprised that there was no sex scene in this movie and that is part of what adds to this movies charm it focuses less on the sexual and more on the love story. Frankly there need to be more movies like this one my entire family is in love with it. I really hope this movie gets a sequel I really want to revisit these characters again and again wither they be more holiday movies or  just more movies with these characters. I highly recommend this movie to everyone you won't be disapointed,1292025600,4,1057,4.206896551724138

There is one good thing:  Alison Arngrim (Little House on the Prairie's Nellie Oleson)steals the show as a sassy, sarcastic next door neighbor.  The best line in the whole film is when the mother tells Alison's character...""Oh, don't be such a NELLIE""!!!

You have quite a cast of characters, from the two young men to the stoner father, the giggly, hilariously clueless mother, the next door Cougar (played by Alison Arngrim aka Nellie Oleson!) Alison's appearance is worth the price of this movie alone. Whenever I feel down, I watch this movie to brighten up my day. Pure, fun entertainment with some corny gay humor & puns thrown in for good measure. It's a nice change from the formulaic Christmas movies (which I love BTW). This one is somewhat formulaic but the gay theme makes it different and delightfully quirky.

3964445,4,B002PCVLWW,"Sometimes sweetness and innocence are enough.  A movie doesn't have to be the best, the most technically assured, when the characters that inhabit it are filled with genuine goodness.  Among the dreck of most gay cinema, it's an unexpected surprise to find a movie that rests on the laurels of simple affection and succeeds.

The premise is simple enough: Olaf is a college senior.  While he's freely out on campus, things are different at the Gunnunderson (yes, Gunnunderson) household.  Olaf goes home to visit his wacky parents, and is shocked when his boyfriend, Nathan, having been ditched by his cold-hearted parents, shows up on the doorstep.  Olaf isn't out, of course, so he introduces Nathan as his ""roommate.""  The film follows Olaf as he struggles to tell his parents who he truly is, and Nathan, who isn't at all comfortable being shoved back in the closet.

I've read some reviews criticizing the film's over-the-top characters and sometimes awkward dialogue.  But you know what?  ""Make the Yuletide Gay"" has such a joyous spirit that none of those things matter.  Cynicism isn't wanted here.  Olaf and Nathan (played charmingly by Keith Jordan and Adamo Ruggiero) have true, genuine affection for one another.  Olaf's parents, while not necessarily realistic, are filled with love and, knowing that Nathan has been dumped by his parents, take him and treat him like one of their own.  And the most miraculous part of the film?  It's practically devoid of negative gay stereotypes.  No drugs.  No random sex (save for one hilariously interrupted intimate moment).  And when the drama comes, it isn't born of archetypes, but of two characters, deeply in love, who can't bear to watch each other suffer.

This is a sweet movie, a hidden gem.",1281139200,17,1753,4.982758620689655
3964446,2,B002PCVLWW,"Some have described this as a 'feel good' movie, which in my opinion amounts to nothing more than accepting the average. Look it is not terrible, but is far from the hype afforded to it in both promotional material and these reviews. Gunn whilst convincing in his portrayal of a closeted 'jock' is a little stoic and at times seemed removed from what is happening around him. Whilst unsure of his parents reaction to him being gay, and somewhat terrified at the thought of loosing them should they react badly, he seems somewhat unaffected emotionally. In fact, the only time he shows any real emotion is when his boyfriend Nathan arrives unexpected at his childhood home to celebrate Christmas with him. I found the very nature of his reaction (being closeted) to be arbitrary, particularly in the face of Nathan's open flamboyance. Any reasonable person would have certainly raised eyebrows and been a little suspicious. In short the acting was okay, but the script (more accurately dialogue between characters) was trivial as if they were not entirely sure of what they had to portray. The actors did not seem to fit, but for the rather eccentric parents.

What I did like was the alter story, between Nathan and his 'girlfriend' aka the girl next door. Ultimately both characters, one straight and one gay, both portrayed ulterior versions of themselves to both society and their parents. The perverse irony being that 'closeted' personalities or sexuality what ever that may be, is not unique to the gay community. This could have been explored better, as I found the humour to be witty, dynamic and new. This was also true of the scathing sarcasm that existed between her and his mother, which at times had me replaying the conversation so that I did not miss the 'furious' exchanges.

In summary, the movie was painfully average. At times it was badly acted, with serious scenes feeling staged, and the more humorous scenes mechanical. I found Nathan to be entirely inappropriate, and his overstated sense of drama unnecessary to the story. Gunn was better, although marginally so.

Ultimately this movie is one that could! It could have been so much better. The casting could have been better. The script could have been better. The acting could have been better. So why settle for average?",1278028800,,2298,4.902313624678663

3964448,3,B002PCVLWW,"I have read the other reviews, and I need to disagree with a lot of the negative comments.

First, this movie is not meant to be one of the greatest works of film ever made.  It is obvious that this movie ws meant to be more light-hearted vs. the mainstream ignorance and negativity we're usually subjected to.

I actually enjoyed this movie.  I loved that some of the characters were over the top.  The characters were like-able, the storyline somewhat believable.

The one thing I did not particularly like was that Olaf's parents made a bet as to whether or not he was gay.  The coming out process is difficult enough to have a bet thrown into the mix.  I'm not sure how that scenario would play out in real life.

Otherwise, it's a fun, no-need-to-think movies that would be a good add to your holiday pile.

3964449,5,B002PCVLWW,"""Making the Yuletide Gay"" is a movie purchase that you will not be disappointed with. This movie is funny, heart warming, and a homerun from director Rob Williams. I walked away from this film with absolutely no suggestions on how it could have been better. From casting, the set, to the story line this film could not have been better made or written by any means. The characters are infectious and their delivery helps make the movie appealing and relatable to any audience. Keith Jordan, ""Gunn"", takes the lead role as a gay college student who has yet to come out to his family and friends back home but is openly gay and in a serious relationship at college. Adamo Ruggiero(Degrassi: The Next Generation), ""Nathan"", plays Jordan's roommate and boyfriend at college who is open and out about his sexuality and is unaware of Jordan's closeted life back home until he unexpectedly comes to spend the Christmas holiday with Jordan & his family. That fact ignites the plot and theme of the film in where we see the struggles and fears that Jordan faces in coming out to his family and friends & announcing that Ruggiero is not only his roommate but his boyfriend. Other unforgettable characters include Jordan's parents played by Kelly Keaton and Derek Long. Keaton plays the oblivious bubbly Mother who is so infatuated with her only son and the Christmas holiday. Her laugh and performance are worth the purchase of this film alone! I dare anyone not to fall in love and laugh along with her stellar performance. She deserves a Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy or Drama Award no questions asked! Derek Long plays the stoner father who is always too high to remember where his is going and why which will no doubtedly bring you laughter throughout the film as well. Although most of the actors in this film will not be recognized as mainstream players, you will see several supporting actor roles from mainstream television series like the Brady Bunch, E.R., and Star Trek. Whether you are gay, you have a family member or friend who is gay, or you are straight you will enjoy this holiday movie which explores the heartaches, difficulties, and fears of coming out as well as relationships through drama and humor. Making the Yuletide Gay is a must see film for every Christmas holiday season or anytime throughout the year!",1264636800,4,2326,4.774193548387097
3964450,5,B002PCVLWW,"I was really bored one evening and browsing Netflix online movies and ended up choosing this movie without expecting very much. I was very pleasantly surprised. I laughed and laughed. Yeah, some of the jokes are corny and tired, but they seemed fresh in this movie. Production values are decent considering that this is only the fourth movie to be produced by Guest House films. The acting is equal to that in many mainstream comedies.  Although the actor, Keith Jordan, is straight in real life, there appeared to be real chemistry between his gay character, Olaf, and Adamo Ruggiero's character, Nathan. Jordan and Ruggiero both did a magnificent job. The casting for the other characters was also very good. I was impressed enough to purchase my own copy for my movie collection. It's a good story with a good message and has a great, original soundtrack to boot. I hope that the hint of a sequel is not just a tease.",1264204800,2,920,4.714285714285714
3964451,4,B002PCVLWW,"This was an amusing movie, if rather predictable.  Two cute actors play gay college lovers at the Christmas holidays.  One has to go home to his parents from Minnesota (with great accents, don'cha know!) who don't know he's gay and are trying to fix him up with the girl next door.  The other, the son of cold, rich and distant parents, is suddenly on his own for Christmas as his parents decided to go abroad for the holidays without him and didn't tell him until he was on his way home.
  So he shows up unexpectedly at his lover's for the holidays.  Complications ensue which threaten to part the lovers but a happy ending saves the day (and Christmas.)  The closet case comes out to his parents (who suspected anyway and are fine with it), and the lonely lad starts to re-develop a relationship with his mother at least.
  This isn't deathless cinema history--our lead actors are not exactly thespians and the production values are limited--but I don't understand the really negative reviews.  It was worth the price and it makes a fun addition to the stack of holiday movies.",1263686400,4,1080,4.636842105263158

However, the more I watched, the more I actually started to buy into the plot. The young protagonist tries too hard to appear straight, his boyfriend grudgingly goes along, and his parents appear so oblivious to the obvious: the boy doesn't like girls. By halfway in the movie, I was curled up beside my boyfriend, engrossed in the mother's several ""you betcha's"" and the double entendres spoken in each scene.

Overall, it's a cute film and best enjoyed in the company of many people with a sense of humor.",1262563200,6,642,4.582608695652174

3964456,1,B002PCVLWW,"Warning: this commentary containers spoilers.

Okay this is supposed to be a comedy which means that we laugh at the funny bits of which there were a few, mainly tired one liners and a few sight gags and, supposedly, aren't to focus on the rest. But to only focus on the comedy means not looking at the rest of the story which may have been funny 40 years ago but (I'd have thought) we are more informed now than to produce stuff like this. I'll not repeat the synopsis. Although I disagree with comments that paint the wealthy parents out to be the 'bad parents'. NOTE: From this point there are spoliers. By the end of the movie, due to some coincidences Olaf comes out. There is the appropriate dramatic pause where we wait for the parent's reaction (which we know will be positive as it's the end of the movie and a negative reaction would need more time to resolve that). But what sickened me was that we find that the parents, essentially, knew that had a gay son for many years yet stil tormented and teased him by trying to connect him with the 'preety girl next door'. They literally made a bet on his sexuality. Suicide amongst gay teens is, we are told, high, and apparently part of the reason is that they don't feel accepted by their family or friends. The scenario painted here ended with hugs because it's a feelgood: in real life it's just as likely to end with suicide. We really don't need members of the gay community depicting kids being teased for our entertainment: the straight community does that well enough.",1261958400,13,1533,4.494623655913978

3964463,5,B002PCVLWW,"From the first time I watched ""Make the Yuletide Gay"", it became an instant Holiday favorite (or is that Holi-gay??) for me. Writer-director Rob Williams has concocted a confection that's sweet & funny, and as irresistible as the smell of Christmas cookies wafting through the house. Telling a straightforward story of two college-age lovers spending Holiday break apart from one another to visit their respective families, Williams reminds us of why relatives can be harrowing...yet, there's no place like home.
The casting is another factor that really makes this film work. Sweet-natured ""Olaf"" Gunn (Keith Jordan) & good-hearted Nathan (Adamo Ruggiero from ""DeGrassi: The Next Generation"") as the young lovers should win Cutest Gay Couple of the Year. The chemistry between their characters is pitch perfect without being forced; they're absolutely adorable. And the two sets of parents could not have been so different: There's Gunn's loopy, jolly Mom (who bakes TONS of goodies during the movie), a transplanted Wisconsin who says ""Don'tcha Know"" a lot; Sven, the absent-minded, pot-smoking Dad who accidentally flashes Nathan by leaving his robe open; and familiar faces Ian Buchanan (daytime's ""General Hospital"") & Gates McFadden (of ""Star Trek: TNG"" fame) as Nathan's cold & self-centered parents. Viewers might be disappointed that the latter parents are absent through most of the film (which is logical, since they leave their own son in a lurch to travel to Jerusalem at the last minute). Thus, Nathan surprises Gunn at his doorstep when his own family plans fall through. This is where the story might have turned into an ""Afterschool Special"" of melodrama, as Gunn has not told his parents of his true sexuality, let alone that Nathan is more than a roommate. But Williams handles the subplot deftly, and doesn't overplay it, even during a front lawn argument between the two. He keeps the film light & airy while slyly tossing out snickering double entendres that either startle its characters or fly right over their heads.
Also of note is ""Little House on the Prairie's"" Alison Arngrim (remember nasty little Nellie?) as a trampy, abrasive neighbor who is the nemesis of Gunn's Mom.
In short, whether you're gay or straight, you'll most likely enjoy this small Holiday goodie. It's a real crowd pleaser!",1260748800,4,2322,5.178191489361702
