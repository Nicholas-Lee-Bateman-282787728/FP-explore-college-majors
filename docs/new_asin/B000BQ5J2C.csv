2436710,3,B000BQ5J2C,"It's an strange movie. Wendy is a small gun. The main character Dick brought it for a birthday gift for a peer but decides to keep it. Later, he finds out it's a real gun by a co-worker and together get into shooting guns. Then they form a club with the other young people like themselves, timid and introverted. They call themselves the Dandies. All of them see themselves non-violent but get confidence from their guns. The Dandies relate to their guns as if they had a soul or personality. As you can guess, this movie doesn't have a happy ending.

If you are looking for something different, you might like this. It will get you pondering about America's relationship with guns and the culture around it. There was something about this film that got me thinking about the Columbine killers.",1155427200,,794,4.631205673758865
2436711,4,B000BQ5J2C,"I think DEAR WENDY requires different point of views and offers several interpretations. I guess we all share some kinda fascination for fire arms. It doesn't mean we disklike the existence of fire arms and their destructive power. Lars von Trier loves guns, he's a fire arm fanatic (I was told) and it becomes a bit obvious when you watch the interview on the DVD. So the film is a bit like a personal investigation, examining the fascination for fire arms in context to naturally disliking the use of it.

When compared to Moore's quasi-Documentation BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE you could say that it's not the fear that drives people to have fire arms but rather lack of self-confidence. The weapon literally becomes your friend and as with a good friend it's easier to walk along strangers and look them in their eyes. That's the result for the hero in this film. Only to carry the gun unseen by the others serves enough to make him able to walk straight and not feel like a complete loser. An experience that he begins to share with a friend. When they sorta think they have the proof that this simple thing actually works, they don't want to keep it to themselves as it would be ""a shame not to share it with others"". So next thing they do is builing a little group of so-called ""Dandies"" who worship their guns by the restriction not to use it and show it elsewhere but in their hideout.

It's very confusing later on, as I didn't quiet ""get"" what the thing about Sebastian was. He's black, and his grandmother used to serve in the hero's house years ago. As soon as Sebastian is part of the show, his grandmother is as well, triggering a really unpredictable plot point that, as a consequence, seems to force the dandies to break the roules and awaken their guns. Is there a message behind this? I know some people who think black people have more violant potential, and those would clap their hands at the end of the film. I see a bit of a risk there. Additionally, I don't see why it is the killer's grandma who gets them into the real trouble. It's interesting and entertaining, and confusing.

Maybe the movie wants to tell us that a fire weapon cannot be misused for anything else but destruction. In the context of the actual world situation (Iraq etc.), it seems plausible. But generally, it's not really true.

However, I thought the film was very interesting. Maybe I should give it less stars as some critical points are very unclear to me. But nah, It's a recommondation for sure.",1154995200,7,2493,4.5456570155902005
2436712,4,B000BQ5J2C,"This is a good film about guns and the STRONG drawing power they have for a punch of teens who are self proclaimed pacifist.

One thing becomes another and next thing there is a big shootout with guns blazing, these youngsters eventually becoming victims of one form or another to the volence which they advocate against.

Good film which could be shown in classrooms",1142899200,5,367,4.71875
2436713,2,B000BQ5J2C,"Though Thomas Vinterberg says in his interview with one Japanese paper that the film is ""not solely aimed at America,"" ""Dear Wendy"" would evoke various responses from the audiences with one central topic in it. It is a very controversial one - guns in America, and the script is written by Lars von Trier, Danish director who did `Dogville' and `Dancer in the Dark.' Lars von Trier gave this script to Thomas Vinterberg (`Celebration'), another Danish director, and one of the founders of `Dogme 95,' experimental method of making films. (But here he discarded most of its rules. Yes, you can hear soudtrack music.)

The film is shot in Denmark and Germany, but the story is set in America. The time is not specified, but the characters are living in a small coal-mining town. Though the many scenes are shot outdoors, the town is represented by a small-scale set with a square and rows of houses, which reminds us of the minimalist approach of `Dogville.'

In this town we meet young teenage Americans - Dick (Jamie Bell), Stevie (Mark Webber), Susan (Alison Pill), Huey (Chris Owen), and Freddie (Michael Angarano). They are kind of `outsiders' of the community, but when Dick finds a gun at Susan's toyshop, things start to change because, as it turns out, the old-fashioned gun is a real one.

Naming his gun Wendy, Dick forms a group with other four. It is called The Dandies, `pacifists with guns,' spending their time in a disused factory to cement the bond, learning and practicing the weapons in Three Musketeers-Meets-Young Guns costumes. After brief peaceful period, however, troubles occur. First, a slight one, and then, a much bigger and serious one.

[PARABLE ON GUNS] It might be pointless to criticize on the grounds that the film's story is unrealistic. Neither is it fair to point out that Lars von Trier has never visited America. `Dear Wendy' is a parable, and should be seen as such. When Bill Pullman appears as a sheriff who speaks with a heavy accent, his character represents one type. Some scenes (like descriptions of a ricocheting bullet) look cartoon-ish, but they are intentional.

But director Vinterberg, it seems, is not equal to the ambitious idea in the script. The events depicted in `Dear Wendy' especially in the second half looks rather silly, and its argument is confused. Look how the Dandies get into troubles, and you know what I mean. Twice black people appear - Sebastian (Danso Gordon) and Clarabelle (Novella Nelson), and twice they bring disorder to the group and the town. And we see no other black people. What does this mean? Is there any meaning behind that casting, or just coincidence (or should I call it clueless)? Or how about the first mission of The Dandies? Their self-appointed business is to `escort' the old lady Clarabelle who is so afraid of the world outside that she cannot even cross the square while the town itself always looks very sleepy? Does this mean fear comes from inside? But what does that have to do with the young protagonist Dick's monologues about his love for Wendy, his gun?

If Lars von Trier had directed the film with his highly (and meticulously) stylish touch, which is seen in such films as `Zentropa,' things might have been different. Vinterberg has surely his own styles, and the photography is good, but they are neither experimental nor orthodox enough. He introduces us brief nudity (yes, Ms. Pill's) while we don't need it (do we?), knowing that the film is about something else; the film uses many pop songs of the 60s British group The Zombies (the music is great) while an American sheriff casually uses cell phone. And Dick declares he is an `American Boy' while, you know, Jamie Bell is born in England.

The film is well-acted, and some insightful moments and tension at gunfight, but they are buried among the confusion caused by the weak and uncertain direction. If only Lars von Trier himself did the job.",1138924800,10,3913,4.822652757078987
2436714,5,B000BQ5J2C,"I'm in film school and after watching this movie I've decided not to become a screenwriter.

The script is perfectly connected. Great story and an amazing imagination of Lars Von Trier! And needless to speak about Thomas' direction! The movie is intelligently directed.

I'm a huge fan of Lars Von Trier. And Lars and Thomas deserves all my compliments and reverence for this movie.

I watched it at the movie theater during Rio International Film Festival and I left the theater crying, proud and happy.

It's incredible when a movie makes you feel like this.",1135814400,15,560,4.863157894736842

For me, an american. It is important to identify with guns. Fully and completely comes to term with insanity our country has taken it. Dear Wendy does put that into a decent and most accurate light.

8090970,4,B000BQ5J2C,"As the third movie made by Jamie Bell it exemplifies his early attraction to playing quirky characters. Of course one of his biggest concerns, even at the early age of 15, was not falling into the trap of ""child actors"". He wanted to insure that he carefully chose future roles that would help him transition into a still relevant adult actor.

I became a fan of Bell's back in 2003 when I first saw ""Billy Elliot"" and was mesmerized by his spunky, confident personality and oddly ordinary, ""working class"" look. I followed his career avidly from that point on. Is it his best work? No, but it's a part of his body of work that show his progression from a child into an adult actor.

If you like Jamie Bell's work you may want to get this one. It's very inexpensive so give it a shot. Otherwise you may not be so interested in it as the story is odd, his character quirky and the ending is not of your typical Hollywood ""feel good"" sort.",1400284800,2,937,4.348571428571429
8090971,1,B000BQ5J2C,"If one possible interpretation is complex allegory of WWII, the script does a lousy job of identifying Germany.  If it was an indictment of America's obsession with handguns, it had the opposite effect upon me.  It proves each of these teens should have been target practicing or hunting with their dads years earlier to learn respect and awe for guns.  This would have innoculated them against the silly and foolish romanticism of guns they build up between each other.  What they needed was supervision and discipline far more than any new gun laws.  I see no evidence this filmmaker intended for anyone to walk away even more pro-gun, so I consider his script a failure.",1382918400,,673,4.817391304347826
8090972,5,B000BQ5J2C,Dear Wendy is a very interesting movie with good acting and a plot that has you fixed on the screen. The acting is authentic and believable. I enjoyed the story line and all in all it's a good movie for something different.,1327449600,,223,4.333333333333333
8090973,5,B000BQ5J2C,"Quirky, weird and with a odd westernish feel this is not the normal teen movie. It is weird and has this strange detached feel to it but as far as a work of art goes, I couldn't be happier with it. For a movie with action, drama or romance go elsewhere. It is more art and entertainment and is essentially a look through a european spy glass into the american obsession with guns and maybe even the american spirit at large.",1315872000,,424,4.246913580246914
8090974,3,B000BQ5J2C,"Jamie Bell stars in ""Dear Wendy"" an intriguing treatise on America's fascination with guns that was written by Lars Von Trier and directed by Thomas Vinterberg.  Bell plays Dickey, a timid young man who lives in a small mining town called Electric Park.  Dickey considers himself a pacifist, and he and his group of misfit friends feel threatened in their rough-and-tumble town.  So they seek ""moral support"" from carrying guns, with the understanding that they never use their guns except within the confines of the ramshackle meeting house, which is replete with an underground shooting range.  The teens become lost in a fantasy world where they become old-fashioned ""dandies"" with their own code and theme song.  Or something along those lines in this very offbeat and at times plain odd film.

Lars Von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg are two of the developers of Dogme 95 - a school of filmmaking that eschews artifice in favor of naturalism.  Vinterberg directed the first film in this genre, the acclaimed ""The Celebration,"" although his work since then has been largely criticized.  Von Trier loves writing films that are critical of American violence and culture, such as ""Dogville"" and its sequel ""Manderlay.""  His writing with ""Dear Wendy"" is typically pretentious and likely to turn off some viewers and perhaps make some angry.  We Americans prefer our cultural criticism to be homebred and bristle when it comes from pasty-skinned Scandinavian socialists.

I don't usually enjoy pretentious indie films, but ""Dear Wendy"" and indeed much of Von Trier's work appeals to me because of its sheer audaciousness.  I am, for example, a big fan of ""Dogville"" and ""Dancer in the Dark.""  However, ""Dear Wendy"" could have benefitted from being even more grandiose and over-the-top; instead, it ends up being a bit tepid for this genre.  Nevertheless, I did enjoy it on some level, and Jamie Bell is very good here, in yet another very offbeat role for the Brit.",1257120000,,1961,5.030959752321982

8090976,1,B000BQ5J2C,"In general I do not write reviews of bad films but this one is so sick and evil I feel I need to warn people about it. Basically it describes how a group of misfit teenagers form a gang centered around their love affairs with firearms. I'm not using the word ""love affair"" here metaphorically either. Maybe it was intended as some sort of parable but its moral values are so confused and corrupted it is difficult to see any good coming of it. I couldn't watch the final predictable bloodbath, I just felt too nauseous. Do not watch this pretentious, awful film. Above all do not let any children see it.",1197331200,,604,4.401785714285714
