7814507,4,6301736370,"As a boy, Kevin Dornwinkle (Kris Russell) is caught peeping on his disrobing neighbor by his cranky mum. Years later, adult Kevin (Noel Peters) is a brilliant scientist. He's been busy developing an invisibility serum. During a demonstration, Dornwinkle injects himself, and... nothing happens. Then, rather than turn invisible, he goes berserk and kills a room full of fellow scientists! Committed to a mental hospital, Dornwinkle quickly escapes, and assumes the identity of ""Dr. Smith"", a mild-mannered high school physics teacher. Alas, poor Smith / Dornwinkle suddenly realizes that his interest in the beautiful girls of the school is beyond the purely academic. When not following his new voyeuristic pursuits, Dornwinkle continues working on his invisibility serum (remember that?). One night he re-injects himself w/ it, and... it works! Oh no! He is now THE INVISIBLE MANIAC! Dornwinkle notices hideous side effects, including an addiction to the serum itself, along w/ an intense state of... um, arousal! The rest is fairly... er, straight-forward. Sort of like THE NUTTY PROFESSOR meets PORKY'S , this movie has a bit more story than other such films. It's also a lot more fun! Dornwinkles final, insane rampage is hysterical! Of course, these facts crumble when set against the many obligatory shower scenes. Simply relax and enjoy the fiesta...",1404604800,2,1358,5.350467289719626

7814510,5,6301736370,"This is advertised as a DVD-R but it looks as good as any regular DVD as far as I can tell.  This is a low budget sex thriller but the girls are gorgeous and the lead maniac is pretty funny as the sex-mad scientist.  Previously only available on VHS, this was totally worth the wait.",1360368000,,283,4.127272727272727
7814511,1,6301736370,"I own an old VHS copy of this movie.  As a fan, I have been waiting for the DVD of this movie for a long time. When I saw that there was finally a DVD release of this movie, I purchased it--- But the purchase turned out to be a mistake.  The image and audio quality of this DVD-R are horrible.  The video is blurry, the movie bounces around the screen, and the audio track sounds awful.  My old VHS tape actually looks and sounds better.  Do not purchase this DVD-R.",1358294400,4,466,4.076923076923077

7814514,2,6301736370,"Ok.  I can't tell whether the Invisble Maniac is intentionally cheesy or not.  It is clear the film makers are poking fun at themselves and other ""B"" films, namely slasher movies, but this film is funny either way, simply because of the overacting and horrible special effects.  But if you are looking into renting or purchasing this movie, overacting and horrible special effects should be exactly what you expect.
  If you're a fan of Troma films then you know what to expect.  Rent it if you can.",1043107200,,499,4.67816091954023
