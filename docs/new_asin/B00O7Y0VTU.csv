Evan Money did a great job bringing together some of the greatest minds of our time and getting their insights on the true meaning of the power of our words. You will be inspired. From Joel Osteen to one of my favorite youth speakers Josh Shipp, you get to hear from people who use their words to impact people everyday.

Definitely put this film on your 'Must Watch' list!",1416441600,2,407,4.355263157894737
6728629,5,B00O7Y0VTU,"As a parent of 6, I spent thousands of hours coaching my children on how to talk nice to each other, how to solve conflict with diplomacy, how to express themselves in an appropriate manner, and how to speak life over themselves and those in their circle of influence. WHY?? Because ""sticks and stones MAY break our bones"" but words WILL have the power to hurt us or inspire us---- even those words that remain unspoken in our heads.

WORDS OF ART is an excellent reminder of the power of our words.  I recommend this for anyone tween and above, for families and groups.",1416441600,3,570,4.471153846153846

6728637,5,B00O7Y0VTU,"I am not the most sentimental person and I am not easily impressed. This film wowed me. It is not just ""Words of Art."" The message woven through this film has the power to change lives. ""Words of Art"" answers the questions that people today are asking. Its not just a ""feel good"" message, its about finding meaningful hope, and really becoming a better person. Its about time we heard a positive message with real meaning in a world filled with so much negativity.",1417996800,,464,4.535714285714286
6728638,5,B00O7Y0VTU,"I was at the premiere of this movie earlier in the year, invited by Steve Thompson of Ambit Energy, and the whole experience was something I will never forget. The movie sheds light on how important the words we speak can alter our lives and the lives of many others around us. I imagine that every word I speak is like a tattoo on my skin or on the wall for everyone to see, I ask myself if I would still be beautiful if all the words I spoke were plastered over me and the walls of my home . This thought process will put things in perspective very quickly ! Thank you Evan Money for this incredible journey you share with us! And to all the guest speakers around the world who could join in !",1417305600,3,695,4.08029197080292
6728639,5,B00O7Y0VTU,"I thought this documentary was well researched and everyone that was on this film provided key insight as to the power of words as it applies to different areas (i.e., religion, politics, spoken word, entertainment, etc.) of where we may find ourselves.  I also appreciated his incorporating Zig Ziglar with insight from his son.  This will have you think twice the next time you open your mouth.",1416960000,2,396,4.895522388059701

6728644,5,B00O7Y0VTU,"What a powerful movie and message that sticks and stones can break your bones and words do matter. The art of words could be a lost art, especially with the increase use of emails and texting, however the Producer Evan Money and Director Jeff Roldan captures the language quite captivating in the movie Words of Art.

6728651,5,B00O7Y0VTU,"I highly recommend this inspiring film featuring the one who understands the power of words and masterfully uses them every week, Joel Osteen.

8682371,5,B00O7Y0VTU,"Personally, I'd rather get root canal than watch a documentary.  Ugh.  So when my husband asked me to watch Words of Art with him, let's just say I was less than enthusiastic about it.  But, reluctantly, I agreed and decided to humor him.  I am so glad I did!  I actually liked this movie, and for me, that is saying a lot.  I thought Evan Money did a great job putting it together, and I was moved and inspired, especially by the young woman poet who was featured in the film.  Good job, Mr. Money!  I would recommend this film to anyone.",1527206400,,539,4.215686274509804

8682377,5,B00O7Y0VTU,Evan Money does a great job at interviewing many different expressors of words. His questions regarding the power and artistry of words elicit interesting and varied responses from the film's equally interesting and varied subjects.,1445644800,,232,5.6571428571428575

8682379,2,B00O7Y0VTU,"I like the main premise of the film, the idea that words are powerful; I just think it could have been compiled in a better way to make that message more powerful and clear to the audience.  Instead of showing clips from moving speeches, and discussing the way these speakers in these clips used different techniques and wording to move people, this film maker decided to interview the people who make these speeches or to interview people who are experts on the people who make these speeches.  Unfortunately, these interviews do not posses any qualities that show off the power of words.  Instead they are rather dull.  The film's creator makes this even worse by asking each person in the interview what words moved them the most, and for most people it wasn't some great powerful speech with rhetoric, it was the simple I love you from a loved one and while this is touching and revealing into human nature, it did not really fit in with the main points he was trying to make in the movie.  I think this film could have been much better if it was structured in a more meaningful way.",1438041600,,1087,4.525510204081633
