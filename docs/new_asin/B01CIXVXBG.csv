7683879,2,B01CIXVXBG,"""Suspects"" is a faux-realism police procedural set in London. Each episode involves a violent crime, but the focus of the show is the suspects. Lots of suspects. There is what amounts to a single script for the entire series, repeated over and over ad nauseam: A crime is committed and three detectives haul in one suspect after another. The suspects lie, even if they are innocent, because - of course - they have secrets to hide, making them look guilty. There is a lot of blathering, babbling, stammering and overlapping dialogue by the cast, including the actors playing the detectives. I suppose this gives the show its ""naturalism."" It never, ever varies. Except for the crime, every episode is exactly like every other episode. Obviously, one of the suspects is the guilty party. Unhappily, one has to endure the seemingly endless questioning before discovering which one it is. And there aren't any clues really, that allow the viewer to try to figure it out. Lots of CCTV, however, which allows the detectives to track everyone. Kind of creepy. I found this show to be really tedious. All the other reviewers seem to love it. Perhaps it is because I've been binge-watching that the sameness of the episodes becomes apparent.",1468022400,9,1233,4.904306220095694
7683880,4,B01CIXVXBG,"As I post the review of this British TV series (which aired on the COMMERCIAL Channel 5 Network) I see two reviews with a LARGE range of stars. I have to honestly say that, while I found the nine 48-minute episodes (which over Seasons 1 and 2  were BOTH filmed in 2014) interesting from an acting point (the main actors improvised most of their dialogue from a script outline) the episodes had a lot of similarity to each other. For Season one, each covered one crime with multiple suspects. Each was  brought into one of the police interview rooms and questioned (interestingly not one of the defendents attorneys every opens their mouth to object to or advise their client.) The viewer is never provided with any clues to help them guess the real killer. Its just revealed at the end. They detectives  the three main lead characters  use a lot (and I mean a LOT) of CCTV footage to determine who dunnit?

Those who have read my other reviews know I hate spoilers or detailed descriptions of episode plot outlines. (After all these are called mysteries for a reason. And so you won't find any spoilers here.

In the second season the cases evolve over more than a single episode. But, at least based on these two seasons, we know nothing about the personal lives of the police team. We only see them at work  not even at play  during they work day (and many of the cases seem to show they work at night.)
As I pointed out earlier, this uniqueness to this series is the improvisational acting and this interested me. But, sparingly, this is one of the few British TV series DVD releases with no making of featurette (or any bonuses). I, for one would have liked to have seen how an episode was filmed and hear about the experience from the actors.

There have been five series filmed so far (series 3 and 4 in 2015 and series 6 in 2016). Im glad that Acorn is making this little-known show available on home video though and hoping that maybe such a background featurette will be added to the next release.

I did enjoy series 2 better than series one, and since they come packaged together, Im giving this four stars.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7683881,1,B01CIXVXBG,"I watched the first two seasons and most of the third before I gave up.  The plotlines are extremely formulaic and the main characters have fallen into caricature.  Clearly the interrogation scenes are supposed to be a central feature, but they are all the same.  The three team members follow the same (now pretty tired) approaches to interviewing the suspects.  But frankly what really got to me in the end was the solicitors that were supposed to be there representing the people being interrogated....  In three seasons I have never heard one of them utter a single word, nor do they consult with their clients.  One of them might occasionally look at his or her client but mostly the solicitors just sit and take notes and when the police say the interview is over the solicitor closes his or her notebook.  What is it?  Are the producers trying to save money by hiring actors to don't speak?  Having watched a LOT of British procedurals, in almost every one of them, the solicitors opposing the police are almost always extremely vocal in representing their clients...  Challenging the questions and the treatment of their clients, demanding they be released for lack of evidence, etc.  Even the ""appropriate adults"" who are occasionally seen with a minor or a mentally ill person on Suspects say nothing and do not intervene, no matter how abusive the police get with the witness or suspect.  After a while, the total non-action of these characters in Suspects becomes ridiculous.  Besides, i've gotten tired of watching the detective who always flies off the handle do his little act.  With so many outstanding British police dramas and mysteries, is it too much to expect a show to give us something a little more akin to reality?",1467676800,12,1739,4.831081081081081
7683882,5,B01CIXVXBG,"Suspects, Series 1 and 2, Fay Ripley. This British mystery television entertainment, a gritty police procedural, is currently in production on its fifth series.  The crime drama is set in contemporary London, where three detectives with the Metropolitan Force (the Met) work together to solve a variety of brutal chilling crimes. Detective Inspector Martha Bellamy (Fay Ripley, COLD FEET) leads her team with calm, fierce determination to get the job done, find justice for her crime victims. Detective Sergeant  Jack Weston (Damien Molony, BEING HUMAN) runs on  emotion, instinct. Young Detective Constable  Charlie Steele (Clare-Hope Ashitey, CHILDREN OF MEN)  is fueled by sharp intellect , prodigious work ethic. From murders to drug crimes to missing person cases, SUSPECTS shows the rigors of police work, the complicated rapport among investigators.  The TV series has been filmed using techniques and directorial approach usually associated with factual programming, allows its stars to  improvise their dialogue:  has been hailed as a fresh, very different, and absolutely cracking drama (Daily Mail, UK).  The episodes are:

Series 1, Episode 1. Two-year-old Hope Wilkins is abducted from her home; detectives Martha, Jack, and Charlie race to find her. The toddler's father, his estranged wife, their son all come under suspicion, then a convicted child killer is connected to the case.
Episode 2. Charlie and Jack investigate an assault on nightclub owner Kirk Hawthorne, find Kirk's sister, Ziggy, unconscious in the cellar. The hospital reports that Ziggy suffered  brain hemorrhage , drug overdose.  A 19-year-old student dies from an overdose of the same drug.
Episode 3. Martha and the team investigate a rape while  looking into two similar attacks that occurred in the area. Jack questions a serial rapist recently released from prison; Charlie must steel herself to investigate the most recent victim's husband: the station's chief superintendent.
Episode 4. Terence Holland, terminally ill founder of Euthanasia Action UK, is discovered unconscious in his home with deadly levels of morphine, sleeping pills in his bloodstream. Terence may have attempted  assisted suicide  or someone with more sinister motive may have attempted murder.
Episode 5. A young girl is stabbed, manages to flag down a taxi to the hospital. The detectives, suspicious that the driver didn't call the police, bring  him in for questioning. Martha and Charlie later uncover nude pictures of the girl on her computer.

Series 2, Episode 1. Martha's neighbor Jonathan Moxton is found in his home bound and gagged, with serious head injuries. The prime suspect appears to be the man who found him, Saul Hammond, a paranoid schizophrenic. But as the team uncovers more about Jonathan's complicated life, the case becomes too personal for Jack, clouding his judgment.
Episode 2. The body of a student turns up with injuries similar to Moxtons. Charlie notices that the student's sister is on edge during questioning.  Jack continues his hot-blooded pursuit of Saul, who begins doubting his own innocence as his mental illness worsens.
Episode 3.  Amateur pedophile hunter Scott Freeman is attacked. Martha and team think one of his targets may be the culprit. Jack remembers Freeman and his daughter, Rose, a meth user who was raped eight years earlier. The detectives dig deeper into the investigation,  notice potential connections between the crimes.
Episode 4.  Edward Shaffer dies a violent death; the detectives turn their attention to Tamsin, his widow. Could she have been ignorant of her husband's activities?  Charlie finds a thumb drive showing several men abusing an abducted young boy. The team races to identify and find him.

The location filming shows London in all its current elegant glory and in its more sinister, shabby, untouristed neighborhoods.  The ensemble acting is fine: the frequent police  interview scenes, which smarter minds than mine have called the heart of any police procedural, are  gripping.  In fact, the series achieves great power through its unprecedented documentary style and improvised dialog.  Which I find surprising, as you have actors, not cops, improvising cops dialog.  Nevertheless, the effect is thoroughly convincing. The box set, which I received  in contemplation of an honest and unbiased review, consists of nine episodes on three discs, running approximately 416 minutes.  Thank goodness, its got subtitles; that quick cross cutting London dialect /slang is a bit hard on anyone not born to it.  It contains violence, coarse language, nudity, sexual situations: probably not for the sensitive or family viewing.  But wow!",1465516800,6,4673,5.392561983471074

7683886,4,B01CIXVXBG,"This series, 'Suspects' took me a couple of episodes to understand the concept. It takes place in East London, in a dingy old building next to a train station. This is reality television. Suspects is a police procedural that was set up for an hour case of the week television. What is the most amazing is that this series has no script. There is a summary of the case delivered by the director, and from then in it is all improvised. Each character develops their role, and delivers the kind of discussion a real police team would have. This takes a lot of intelligence, bravery and the ability to think on your feet. This is a real reality show.

Fay Ripley, plays DI Martha Bellamy, she keeps this ship afloat. She is an attractive woman, married and with a child. Damien Molony, plays DS Jack Weston. He is the most irritating character of the series. He really plays by the seat of his pants, breaking the law and any ethical morals he might have to garner clues and squeeze his suspects. He should have been kicked off the squad and out of the police long ago. The problem is, he is almost always right, and he has a quick mind. Clare-Hope Ashitey, plays the junior DC Charlie Steele. She is the most intelligent of the squad, high moral and ethical values. She follows Jack, but rightfully questions his decisions.

There are six episodes, one hour a piece, all following the same case, putting clues together, piece by piece. The other characters in the series may be actors you recognize, who also improvise all their lines. This is really fabulous, but takes awhile to fully understand what is going on.

7683888,2,B01CIXVXBG,"What I love about the BBC is how it pretends nothing has changed in Britain in the last 30 years.  All the villians are white guys, every time.  Nevermind real life where the whole social services behemoth failed 1400 white girls in Rotherham who were groomed and prostituted by Pakistani rape gangs.  And that's still going on and going on all over.

This show, in particular, sticks with that Pretend Britain narrative and has other problems besides.  Confusing, hard to understand the dialog, everything smeared together, main characters impossible to get to know or have an opinion about.  We made it through 3 episodes so it gets 2 stars.

The other thing about British procedurals in general and this show in particular is that no one, absolutely no one, is likable.  And everything is grim and miserable.  Everything without exception.  Why do I watch these things?  I may be hitting my limit.",1477094400,,900,4.855263157894737

7683890,4,B01CIXVXBG,"What I've always disliked about most Christian congregations, is that the main reason people seem to attend church is because of how much they like or dislike the minister, priest or rabbi. Somehow the message of why they are going in the first place gets second hand billing to the charisma of the minister ,and if he/she leaves the congregation for some reason, people tend to leave the church in search of a minister that they like better.

And interesting thing is the fact that in so many of today's crime dramas, the reason people like them is because of the charisma of the officers and how much they like them, rather than the actual police work and how a case is cracked. Much like the problem with the churches, where the crime investigations seem to get second billing to how much people like the officers.

What's kind of wonderful about the series Suspects is that the crime gets top billing ,.
and the personal stories of the officers who solve the crimes and not even mentioned much. The series plays much like an actual documentary drama, and its is really interesting about how the cases get solved ,and how the criminals are sometimes not at all who we think, and the stories are more complex than you would think to begin.

This series really refreshing and different than the typical crime drama and I'm happy they have commissioned a 6th series.",1471824000,,1366,4.636363636363637
