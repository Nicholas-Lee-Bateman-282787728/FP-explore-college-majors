6876452,5,B00QMKHM3A,"* I received a review copy of this series in exchange for an honest review

One of the most horrifying concepts any parent can consider is the abduction of their child.  This reprehensible act is one of the most terrifying and gut-wrenching things a human being can endure.  As such, it makes the perfect concept for a thrilling TV show.  The fine folks at Starz recognized this when they signed on for THE MISSING, a BBC limited series that hits store shelves tomorrow.  And let me tell you: although the basis for this show might sound familiar, I can almost guarantee you've never seen the likes of this before.  If you are a fan of shows like TRUE DETECTIVE, then you'll definitely want to check out THE MISSING.

I wasn't sure what to expect going into this one.  I knew the premise, but I wasn't sure if the intensity would be there.  I'm very happy to report it is...and then some!  Filled with twists and turns, this series is a definite keeper in the Starz lineup!

THE MISSING is shot well and looks to have a high production value.  It is filmed overseas, which makes the locations and backdrops all exotic, in a sense.  This adds a whole different level of interest to the show, and it even adds to the tension in the storyline.  The 'stranger in a strange land' concept goes far in lending stress to the plot.

The acting is top notch as well, with several big names headlining the cast.  James Nesbitt portrays the distraught father, Tony.  Nesbitt does a mesmerizing job with his role and is supported by an excellent team that includes Frances O'Connor, who plays Tony's wife; Tcheky Karyo as Detective Julien Baptiste; Jason Flemyng; Said Taghmaoui; and several others.

There's not many special effects in THE MISSING, but the show does not need them.  The plot is what drives the show, and it's filled with tension and mystery.  Each episode brings about startling revelations that leave the viewer frothing at the mouth for more.  I daresay this is one of the best series the BBC has come out with in a while.  I can't wait to see where it goes from here.

THE MISSING is a superb show, and I highly recommend it.  This first season is only eight episodes long, but they are crammed full of drama and suspense.  This is one series to watch out for.  It releases tomorrow, so make a note.",1428883200,,2307,4.52542372881356
6876453,2,B00QMKHM3A,"Saw this on Starz. Overly long and James Nesbitt had only one expression -- scowling over and over and over. Don't bother. I was annoyed at having spent so much time on this. The detective (Tchky Karyo ) was the best actor in the series, but couldn't carry the whole thing.",1426118400,,273,4.372549019607843
6876454,5,B00QMKHM3A,"This powerful and gripping but emotionally wrenching BBC series recounts the abduction, and its aftermath, of a five year old boy, Oliver Hughes (Oliver Hunt), whilst on holiday in northern France with his mother, Emily (Frances OConnor) and father, Tony (James Nesbitt). Ostensibly, the focus is on the devastating effect this event has on the childs parents and their marriage but, rather like the pattern made in a pond from a dropped stone, the spreading ripples encompass all of the surrounding characters from potential suspects to the police team carrying out the investigation.

Initially the couple are the subject of wide-spread sympathy and everyone, from the proprietors of the hotel in which they are staying to the towns mayor, seems keen to help. However, they are soon subject to the ravenous attentions of the media and the pressure takes its toll on their relationship.

The narrative occurs in the present day, 2014, and through flashback to 2006, the year in which the abduction occurs so, over the course of each episode, we see, gradually, the corrosive effects of this hideous crime on all concerned. In the process, the story examines various familial but principally parent-child relationship scenarios from the Hughes own with their missing child, Oliver, and that of Emilys with her parents - who travel to France to support their daughter - through lead investigator, Julien Baptistes (Tcheky Karyo) with his drug addicted daughter, to thoroughly odious investigative reporter, Malik Suris (Arsher Ali) with his toddler son.

I was at first slightly irritated by James Nesbitts performance but was gradually won over and by the end thoroughly convinced by it. All the performances were top-notch but one that, unexpectedly, especially moved me was that of Titus de Voogdt, who played one of the prime suspects, Vincent Bourg.",1425945600,7,1853,5.2114093959731544

These words sung slowly with a haunting tune open each of eight episodes of this British drama television series that recently ended its Season One. THE MISSING premiered in October 2014 on BBC One in the UK, and in the US on Starz in November 2014. It was spectacularly filmed in Huy and Brussels, Belgium, and was nominated for two Golden Globes: best television mini-series or movie and a nod to Frances O'Connor for best actress in a mini-series or movie.  The series has a remarkable international cast:

...James Nesbitt, an actor born in Northern Ireland, is Tony Hughes. father of the missing boy, Oliver Hughes. The story is told mostly from the father's viewpoint who devotes eight years (2006-2014) searching for his son.
...Frances O'Connor, an Australian actress, is Emily Hughes, mother of Oliver and wife of Tony in 2006. Emily is devastated by the disappearance of her son. Her marriage breaks down, and she starts a relationship with detective Mark Walsh.
...Tchky Karyo. a Turkish-born French actor, is Julien Baptiste, lead detective on Oliver's case. Julien rejoins Tony when they find further evidence in 2014, but he is still scarred by past events.
...Jason Flemyng, an English actor, is Mark Walsh, a British detective holidaying in Chalons De Bois in 2006. He becomes translator and general supporter for the Hughes family.
...Ken Stott, a Scottish actor known for his television work, is Ian Garrett, a property developer constructing a holiday home near Chalons De Bois. Ian becomes a benefactor for the Hughes but harbors dark secrets that could be linked to Oliver's disappearance.
...Arsher Ali, a British Shakespearian actor, is Malik Suri, an English journalist who is determined to make his big break. He bribes a corrupt detective and obtains evidence that could lead to Oliver's abductor.
...Titus De Voogdt, a Belgian actor, is Vincent Bourg, who is living near Chalons De Bois in 2006. He is a reputed pedophile and is the police's first suspect.

THE MISSING follows Tony Hughes, a man devastated by the abduction of his five-year-old son during a family vacation in France. Ollie disappears at a busy courtyard bar in Chalons De Bois filled with people watching the 2006 World Cup.  Tony's exhaustive search for his child fractures his marriage to Emily, Ollie's mother. Julien Baptiste, the French police detective first assigned to the case, launches the initial search for the child. Even though he is retired in present day, he too cannot shake the small belief that the child may still be alive.  With flashbacks in time between Ollie's abduction in 2006 and Tony's return to the small French town in 2014, this gripping thriller creates a fascinating narrative puzzle. As Jiilo Kim states in his excellent summary on Imdb, the series explores the impact of a child's abduction, the emotional cost of obsession, of hope, and of finding when to let go.

BBC One has confirmed that its abduction thriller THE MISSING will return for a second series. It will keep its overall structure - a story told over two time frames - but with a fresh case, new characters and a new location.  The second outing will have the same core creative team of screenwriters Harry and Jack Williams and director Tom Shankland.",1422748800,15,3314,4.947841726618705
6876456,4,B00QMKHM3A,"This is an extremely well-acted drama centering around the disappearance of a young boy from a busy poolside bar in France in 2006. The story of the investigation unfolds through a series of flashbacks from current day (2014) to 2006 and some in 2009.
There are many twists and turns and interesting characters who are not all they seem to be.

Nesbit does a wonderful job as the distraught father who life is shattered, as does Tchky Karyo as the investigating detective.

To be honest, at 480 minutes the series had the potential to drag but there is a real turning point on episode 5 that rejuvenates the story line.

Spoiler alert: It appears there is a second series being planned",1421452800,,685,4.644628099173554
6876457,4,B00QMKHM3A,"A couple portrayed by James Nesbitt and Frances McDormand, along with their five-year-old son, experience car trouble while vacationing in France, and spend the night at an inn while the car is being fixed.  Nesbitt and his son wander off, and before long Nesbitt loses track of his son in a crowd gathered to watch a televised soccer match.  What ensues is a frantic search for the missing boy, flashing between 2006 when the disappearance takes place, and the present, in which new clues are unearthed and pursued, as played out in eight distinct episodes. (There is also a brief investigation into another child disappearance in 2009 that gives Tony, the Nesbitt character, false hope of a link, which quickly fades.) The shift between present and past, although usually announced on the screen by title cards, can too often become confusing and disruptive.  The journey to discover the truth of what happened to the boy leads Nesbitt and a wise French detective -- most of the series is given over to their dogged side by side pursuit of clues, mostly in the present -- down more than a few blind alleys involving a suspected pedophile link to the boy's disappearance.  Although the acting and direction here are wonderful, the writing is superficial.  There is the usual invented troubled backstory -- the detective's daughter is fraught with addiction problems, Tony himself has at least a partial history of violence, one of the benefactors has a dark past (although this is never fully fleshed out), a journalist with his own set of problems suppresses a key clue in the case for no apparent reason other than to prolong the story -- but none of this really contributes to the most important issue at stake -- the depth of Nesbitt and McDormand's despair.  It's never explored in any real depth, and there is not much chemistry to speak of between McDormand and Nesbitt themselves.  We get no more than a fleeting picture of their missing child, and nothing more than a perfunctory sort of attachment to him (think generic kid in car with mom and dad), before the boy goes missing.  We're not emotionally invested in what happens to the boy because the Nesbitt and McDormand characters, for all of Nesbitt's frantic protestations, don't seem invested.  Don't get me wrong -- they are wonderful actors and give it their best, but what should have been a wrenching story of emotional suffering over a lost child comes across more as a gratuitous detour into the dark underworld of pedophilia and political corruption, and this only in a superficial way.  When the details of what actually took place finally emerge, you may find it hard to swallow what is supposed to come across as believable motivation.  I know I did.  And there is a sort of coda at the very end involving Nesbitt that just seems silly and is wildly over the top. Still, if only for the actor who portrays the wonderful French detective, the always engaging and delightful Irish actor James Nesbitt, and a reasonably engaging detective yarn, you will find yourself entertained.",1419552000,5,3053,4.85

6876459,3,B00QMKHM3A,"I had  high hopes for this series which started out strong but as it progressed became tedious.  The best actors were the French detective and the young man who was a pedophile, both were great.  As for James Nesbit and Francis O'Connor, I found them both to be rather flat and boring, and definitely miscast.  Better actors would have made this series riveting.  There's some good suspense sprinkled throughout the series but the ongoing dialog between the two main characters was too repetitive and in the end oddly we had more sympathy for the pedophile struggling to deal with his addiction than the main characters.",1440892800,,620,4.866666666666666

8691924,4,B00QMKHM3A,"Most of the action takes place in France but it concerns an English family, father and mother plus child, going on vacation to France. The child disappears in Chlons du Bois one evening when everyone is watching some football competition outdoors since we are in July and television screens can be moved. We are in 2006. It will take eight years for the truth to finally surface and justice  more or less  be satisfied with the official death declaration of the child in 2014. The child was at that time under the responsibility of the father who took him into a crowd of football supporters and let him go. Within minutes he had disappeared and the assumption was that he had been abducted by some human traffickers.

The series is then very surprising in the amateurish way of dealing with things. The disappearance of the child is classified as an unsolved case soon after the abduction and will only be revived in 2014 when some new elements appear.

But the film is in many ways a debunking  and yet not exactly unbiased  of all kinds of absurd preconceived ideas. Abducted you said, then it has to be by the Romanians who are more or less getting some kind of a living by trafficking in the region, and more generally in France. Two girls are drug-addicts, the daughter of the main French detective and the sister of one of the Romanian traffickers. When you add to this the wife of an architect who more or less encouraged his pedophilia for her own comfort, the wife of the hotel manager who tries to keep his alcoholism under control but does not put him on a leash, a real detox treatment, the film is definitely not very woman-friendly. The only positive woman among these few women is the Romanian who manages to detox herself with some help from the French detective and to get a job as an English teacher: a European benefit in a way since she must have had a Romanian diploma of some kind that was automatically accepted in France.

The mother on the other hand is seen as volatile. She is nearly, and she says so later on, relieved by the decision to stop the investigation. She is not really supportive and in spite of all she says that the child will always be present in her mind, she pushed him aside rather fast. Mourning can be quite different for many people. The result is that the film is dominated by some men, which is slightly sexist. The juge dinstruction (District Attorney) is a man, the father is hyper dominant, the main detective is a man. The Moroccan junior detective is a man. The main journalist, a Moroccan, is a man too. The architect who is a serial pedophile is a man. The local pedophile who will move to England to escape France after his stint in prison for possession of indecent and inappropriate pictures on his laptop is a man of course. To expand on this point, I should say pedophilia is depicted in the most repulsive way with the architect more or less supported by his wife and the local isolated one ending up hanging himself in England because he cannot get rid of his disease, as he called it, with some good old medical treatment that after a while make him vomit when he sees a boy and the boys eyes connect with him. And of course he writes a note to his mother. Those are clichs and they are NOT SO TRUE.

But the main actor is also very good and he impersonates a father who is unstable, resolute to the point of following his first impression, violent every single time he meets with something that blocks his way. He is not at all reluctant at killing someone if he so decides he has to. His first impression has to be the good one and if he thinks this or that man, always men, is the culprit he will by accident kill him or try to kill him. He can hardly be kept under control by the main detective in 2006, and later on retired detective entrusted with the reopening of the case in 2014. What is surprising is that the police seems to be good as for their field work, though they will not get an essential piece of evidence because the Moroccan junior detective will leak it to the Moroccan journalist who is blackmailing him. That piece of evidence will only be recuperated in 2014 and after the Moroccan junior detective has been killed in prison just before he could and would tell the retired detective, his own son who accepted to see his father, and the parents of the abducted child. Rats are not liked in prison (and of course the wardens just plainly closed their eyes. One more clich that is slightly worn out.

The French police is shown in the most unfavorable way and through the eyes of an Englishman who is able to commit the worst crimes without any real evidence, just from the knack of the moment, from the very start this father has an anti-pedophile stance and conviction that is nearly nothing but fundamentalist bigotry. The series does not exploit this element at the psychological level concerning the father himself. Such a level of hostility could and should make people think he is at least a closet pedophile with his own son and wants to keep him for himself. Any extreme position like this one reveals the person concerned is suffering from what he or she exposes. We have known that since Shakespeare: The lady protests too much. And too much this father does protest against pedophiles. And of course his sons abduction had nothing to do with pedophiles.

Still about the French police, it is obviously shown as incompetent, unable to widen the palette of solutions under the violent, vehement attitude of the father they are not able to keep in his place. He should have been kept under constant police protection that would have also been police surveillance because in such cases one hypothesis is that the father who was responsible for the child at the time and was the last person to have seen him alive without any alibi might be the culprit and should be treated as a suspect if not number one suspect. This hypothesis is only hinted at once a long way after the beginning of the story with the parallel with another case in the same place in 2009 in which the boy this time is abducted by his own father. They jump too fast on Romanians and slavery of some kind. They jump too fast too on pedophiles (under the pressure of the father) instead of looking at all the possibilities and one of them was that the father should have been treated as a suspect, which would have kept him in place a lot more. But they did canvass the area and the incriminating element was found but not transmitted to the French police by the Moroccan detective who found it, but given to the Moroccan journalist. Sorry folks but Moroccans in France and particularly in the police are rotten and the piece of evidence will be hijacked for eight years. This anti-Romanian and anti-Moroccan stance is frankly nothing but racist and that is absolutely irritating in the anti-immigrant stance it reveals, including European immigrants.

The last point has to do with the opening and closing scenes of the last episode that drag Russia into the business. Thats a cliff hanger that assimilates Romanian mafia and Russian mafia, in fact Romanian mafia and some connection with the Russian police, hence state, as if the Romanian mafia was working for the Russian state to destabilize Europe. This cliff hanger is unacceptable and you can be sure I will not get the sequel that goes along such a line, or may go along such a line. It is a ridiculous Brexit stance that has nothing to do in this real situation that connects in the end the abduction neither with the Romanian mafia and their possible human trafficking, nor with the pedophiles in the area, but with some deep local rot that turned a banal though unacceptable accident into the sign that rot travels deep among local politicians and maybe not only local. And that is not typically French: The Interpol agent from London taking advantage of the situation to conquer the mother to be his own wife is also ethically not exactly sunny bright nor crystal clear, not to speak of the conflict of interest in associating a friend of the victims family to the investigation.

But one thing is sure: you will enjoy the various English accents, including a Romanian one (reading Alice in Wonderland) and some French ones though vastly improved on what it is in reality (very poor, I can tell you). The main French detective is obviously a justified exception since he is by origin Greek, Turkish and Jewish, maybe some more, and as such has the flexibility to learn a foreign language properly.
