7361931,5,B013C6OW1Q,"The Gift is a psychological thriller that tells the story about Simon and Robyn, a married couple who move into their new home in Chicago to start a new life. One day, Simon runs into Gordon, an old acquaintance from Simon's past. Things get strange when Gordon constantly leaves gifts by Simon's front door only to eventually reveal a dark secret from their past. The Gift was a movie that kept me on edge constantly because of the way the movie sets up its story and characters. The characters are incredibly well-written and very realistic. The mystery aspect of the movie was one thing that kept me entertained throughout the movie because it keeps you guessing what will happen between the characters and how their connection will be affected. It was surprising to see Jason Bateman take on a more serious role as opposed to comedic roles that he is vastly more known for but his performance as Simon was solid, same with Rebecca Hall as Robyn and Joel Edgerton as Gordon. The movie definitely has a compelling message to it once the movie is over. If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out on a solid psychological thriller.",1440633600,104,1140,4.676616915422885
7361932,4,B013C6OW1Q,"Indeed. A surprising, in many ways, tale of sins coming back to haunt. Good acting. Much of the early movie, the viewer is wondering, who is the bad guy? There must be one, right? Oh, the joy of writing for an adult audience that doesn't need everything explained. A nice present.",1440460800,18,280,4.509803921568627
7361933,4,B013C6OW1Q,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.  Joel Edgerton, makes his feature film directorial debut in this taut thriller.  Based on his own script, he stars as Gordo, a slightly off-kilter loner who runs into a former high school classmate in a retail store.  Simon (Jason Bateman) has just relocated to L. A. along with his wife, Robyn (Rebecca Hall) who is still recovering from a miscarriage.  Simon, while polite, doesn't remember Gordo.  They speak briefly then go their separate ways.

Simon and Robyn are surprised when Gordo leaves a welcoming gift on their doorstep.  Robyn insists that they all get together.  They do, but Gordo clearly wants to further the budding friendship.  Simon, seemingly busy at his new job and trying to score a big promotion, suggests he's too busy.  Robyn, somewhat lonely, feels sorry for the socially awkward Gordo.  At about the halfway point in the film, we have a pretty good idea where this is all going...but like a good Hitchcock film, maybe we don't.  Edgerton keeps the surprises coming and the audience guessing.

The 3 leads turn in some excellent performances.  I was especially taken with Ms. Hall, who puts aside her British accent and delivers a smart, nuanced take on a women wanting more than being a dutiful wife.  There are a couple ""jump"" scare scenes that are unnecessary and out of place in a sophisticated psychological thriller like this.  Aside from that, Edgerton and his crew have given the viewer a surprising good film which would seem to bode well for his future behind the camera.  Recommended.",1440115200,13,1565,4.908396946564886
7361934,3,B013C6OW1Q,"This movie was good, but I was expecting something totally different based off the trailers.  Jason Bateman does a really good job in his role, he plays a good jerk.  The movie starts out with a married couple that have  moved to back to the husbands home town in California from Chicago.  I felt like we needed some more backstory of what if anything happened while the couple was in Chicago.",1439683200,4,393,4.492957746478873
7361935,5,B013C6OW1Q,"In the mood for an edge of your seat thriller in a nice air conditioned theatre this summer? If so you MUST try The Gift.  It's a terrific psychological thriller that we both enjoyed a lot. Jason Bateman (Simon), Joel Edgerton (Gordo) and Rebecca Hall (Robyn). Joel Edgerton, wrote, directed and starred in the movie and he was terrific.

In this movie Simon and Robyn are a young married couple who just moved from Chicago to California,  One day soon after purchasing their new home, the couple is out shopping when an old classmate of Simon's from high school recognizes him and takes the time to stop and reintroduce himself. Simon says he does not remember him, but Gordo is persistent, and it isn't the last the couple will see of him.

This movie has it all: great cast, terrific story and unexpected twists. It kept us guessing and on the edge of our seats throughout. It's one of those stories that will make you wonder about how well we know the people we think we know.

SEE IT!!",1439596800,,990,4.5083798882681565
7361936,4,B013C6OW1Q,"I just got back from seeing this amazing film in theaters and I have to say, I did NOT expect more than half of the twists and turns this movie threw at me. The trailers made it look like a conventional stalker thriller with Joel Edgerton as the villain and Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall as the mostly innocent victims. I say mostly innocent because even from the trailers you knew there was something not quite right with Bateman's character Simon, but you weren't exactly sure how deep it was. Boy, was I thrilled, and disturbed, and terrified on numerous occasions. What I liked most is that it definitely played with the audience's expectations, whereas you think you know what's going to happen next, you might even all have it all planned out in your head, but Edgerton has other plans in mind, and he lets you know that fairly early in the film. This film gave me a very self-aware vibe in that he wasn't just playing mind games with the two main characters, but he was also playing mind games with us, in that he kept screwing with our expectations, blurring the line between reality and falsehood, and making a character you thought was the bad guy, the potential good guy, and making the hapless victim, most notably Simon, the potential bad guy. I say potential because there are no clear villains and heroes in this film, like with Hard Candy and Death Note, two equally good films I might add, the true villain, if there is one, is the human potential for cruelty and malice towards our fellow man, and how it effects different people in different ways.

Everyone has SOMETHING in their past, something they want to hide or forget, but as this film shows, sometimes that can't be as easy as we would hope. Kudos for Jason Bateman and Joel Edgerton for their portrayals of disturbed and at times loathsome men, who at the same time are very different. Bateman had depth and development as Simon, but he was also fairly predictable in many of his actions and responses, whereas with Edgerton, throughout the entire film I was simply unable to guess what might have been going on in his head, what he might have been planning, and just what he was capable of, in this regard he was a much more frightening and unpredictable character because he clearly wasn't completely there, he came off as incredibly disturbed and that aura permeated the entire film, as the suspense and tension kept growing to the point even before the climax that you could tell something horrible was going to happen very soon. And of course, caught in between these two men was the innocent kind-hearted Robin, portrayed exquisitely by British actress Rebecca Hall, who had some of her own demons and things in her past which she was struggling to move past, although not nearly to the degree of Simon and Gordo. As for why it doesn't have five stars, well, it felt strangely incomplete to me, as there were plot threads which went nowhere or were seemingly completely random (Apocalypse Now, Helicopters, Monkey Phobia), if you've seen the film you know what I'm talking about. And the ending also could have been better, it felt as though there might have been a sequel in development so maybe that's why. Anyway, first class thriller, definitely expect to see more from Joel Edgerton in the future. Highly recommend this film. Peace.",1439510400,2,3322,4.688356164383562
7361937,5,B013C6OW1Q,"One of the best feelings you can have while sitting in a movie theater, having chosen something you weren't necessarily looking forward to, is to have your expectations greatly exceeded. This was the sort of situation I was in with The Gift. By no means was I anxiously awaiting its release, nor did I expect to enjoy it all that much as I paid and took my seat. But low and behold, I was thoroughly entertained and thrilled for the extent of its runtime. Once the first eerie frames flashed onto the screen and I got a glimpse of the kind-of experience I might have, I was in.

In a sense, the film seems almost plucked out of the 90s. Its one of those well-executed thrillers that you might expect would star someone like Michael Douglas in his prime. It focuses on a newly-married couple who, after an encounter with an old high school buddy of the husbands, begin receiving mysterious gifts and run-ins with this same peculiar man. Simon and Robyn (played by Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall) - the pair in question - try their best to handle the bizarre events as they begin to get weirder and weirder. But as the film unfolds, and the truth comes out, these strange occurrences take on a whole new meaning.

Its definitely one of the most entertaining movies Ive seen all summer, and the performances are downright fantastic. Joel Edgerton, who also wrote and directed the film, gets some massive screen-time of his own as the mystifying acquaintance that shakes everything up. Its a wonder that hes able to be so present and immersed in this character while also seeing that his own material is fully realized on-screen. Hes created a movie that will get inside the viewers head and, in my case, even make them jump out of their seat a few times. Its one of those extremely satisfying movie experiences that sneaks up on you, proving that a compelling story is really all you need to make an engrossing film.",1439164800,76,1913,4.590643274853801
7361938,5,B013C6OW1Q,"Moving from Chicago to his home state of California so he can assume a prestigious position at a cyber-security firm, Simon and Robyn (Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall) purchase a chic, modern suburban home and plan to start a family.  There is a sense of anger and melancholy left behind in Illinoisshe lost a baby and could not cope for a whilebut their new home is spacious and tranquil, and the couple tries to embrace the fresh start it represents.  One afternoon, however, they run into Gordon (Joel Edgerton), a high-school acquaintance Simon knew as ""Gordo the Weirdo.""  In a friendly, yet quietly menacing way, Gordon inserts himself into their life.  There are gifts, including expensive wine and fish for an empty pond on their property.  There are also frequent visits during the day when Robyn is home alone, as well as self-invitations to dinner.  Robyn is sympathetic toward their nervous, overeager new friend, but Simon regards him with disdain and suspicion and plans to end the one-sided relationship.

The Gift is the directorial debut of Edgerton, a gifted Australian actor audiences know from, among other films, Animal Kingdom, Warrior, and The Great Gatsby, and it is a wonderful suspense story of capitalist drive, domestic secrecy, and danger only thinly obscured by the customs of polite society.  The film expertly toys with and subverts viewers' expectations throughout, savoring almost every chance to veer left when we expect it to turn right.  It starts with a recognizable, tried-and-true, even generic genre scenario in which a Perfect Couple must contend with a Troubled Outsider (see:  Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights), but soon collapses the protagonist/antagonist gap, forcing us to consider again and again which male character we trust, if either, and why.

The photography is crisp and elegantthe camera glides and surveys every reflective or shadow-enshrouded space, often allowing a sign of peril to enter the frame without a hand-holding musical joltand the trio of central performances are perfectly calibrated.  Bateman plays Simon as an outwardly attentive husband who we only slowly notice transforms into a terse and even cruel creature when pushed beyond his comfort zone.  Edgerton cuts an eerie, peculiar figure as ""Gordo"" without sacrificing a certain plaintive quality, refusing to let the character become a conventional or predictable heavy.  And Hall, an often undervalued performer in general, is simply tremendous in the most complicated role.  The story is revealed through her eyes, and she ushers us into the resourceful, yet fragile Robyn's mindan evolving whirlwind of despair, displacement, empathy, fear, and intriguewith an intelligence and poise reminiscent of, say, Ingrid Bergman in Gaslight or Deborah Kerr in The Innocents.",1439164800,10,2795,5.334851936218679

7361947,5,B013C6OW1Q,"I consider this movie one of my top three favorite movies of all time.  It also changed my life.  The idea that you can be married to someone and not see them for who they really are, not understand who you're really dealing with.  The wife did something incredibly brave at the end of the movie and this is what in significant part spurred me to take the same action in my own life.  I am really grateful that I saw this movie at the time that I did.

It's like in the movie when Gordon says he believes that bad things in life can be a gift.  That has always been the case in my own life - the bad things happening are what has woken me up and given me the motivation and/or necessity to change my situation.  Had these ""bad things"" not happened, I would not have gotten something/somewhere which is so much better.

From the trailer, it looks like some sort of generic thriller.  This couldn't be further from the truth. In reality, the movie is so much deeper than that and goes in a completely different direction than one is expecting.  The movie is incredibly thought provoking and, at least in my case, life changing.

7361953,5,B013C6OW1Q,"Bravo, Joel Edgerton. Not your standard run of the mill thriller here. Well done.

Ill try to keep this strictly to commentary about the film and try to avoid any plot.

I have to say, Joel Edgerton knocked it out of the park with this tense thriller, The Gift. There is definitely a shift that takes place that separates this psychological thriller apart from others. And, one of the best assets to this film is the slowly and effectively building tension that reveals some surprises and twists. We see this in the characters and their personal conflicts.

I think what the film achieves, from a viewers standpoint, is making you uncomfortable for the entirety of the film. There are times when, as viewer, you think you have figured things out and then, there is something that changes and takes you off guard.

Also, I think that so often with psychological thrillers there is time wasted. I would say that there is seldom a wasted scene in this film. Every scene is important to the development of the plot and/or character. There is a building, either scene or conflict wise, to a final conclusion, which is an attribute to the fine directing and pacing of the film.

Additionally there are several layers to the plot and conflict, and ultimately, the ending. We really get in into each of the characters as the film progresses, and, at points, we are surprised in the direction that we are heading.

I was genuinely surprised with this film. This is a really smart thriller that doesnt go the conventional route, which is quite refreshing.  There is an undefined tension in many of the scenes.

In another sense, I think the best selling point for this film is that is so atypical in the sense that each of the three main characters all have depth and dimension to them in various ways, and I attribute this to fine performances by all three leads (Edgerton, Bateman, Hall). This may come in secrets in the past, or how they interact with characters. The acting from all three leading actors in this film is amazing and quite believable to the story.

The Gift is an intense and sometimes uncomfortable ride, but well worth it if you like anything like it in the genre. Probably one of the best Ive seen in quite some time.",1515024000,2,2229,4.622784810126582

Acting is solid, complex, believable.  The pace is appropriate, not too brief nor underdeveloped, not overly drawn out.  Plus, it's good fun to see Justin Bateman in a dramatic role.

My Beef ( and spoiler, of sorts ):  It kind of defeats the purpose of a certain partner's misbehavior being solidly confronted if the other partner, filled with indignation, strikes the other and it is assumed as appropriate.  Given today's climate of social justice and extreme feminism in our culture, it is not a surprise. But I found it amazingly hypocritical, and since the film did not appear to have any reflection upon such a double-standard, I think a blindspot in political ideology surfaced, or worse, deliberate injustice  The weakspot in an otherwise 4-Star film, but a solid flaw at that.

The refrigerator door closing, the foggy shower, the house with about a thousand glass walls, the dog. He takes the cliches and uses them to his advantage time and time again so your never sure exactly where you sit. He not the first to do this, obviously, but  this is the best I've seen it done in recent memory. If your looking for a horror movie this isn't it. It's a true psychological thriller.

7361993,3,B013C6OW1Q,"Jason Bateman, although not one of my favorite actors, does a good job playing against type in this film. He appears to be the loving husband and all-around good guy in the beginning, but as the story goes on, we discover that is a facade that hides his true nature. Rebecca Hall does a good job also, although her hairstyle was certainly not flattering and every time I looked at her I kept thinking ""Olive Oyl."" Joel Edgerton's acting was not nearly on par with the two leads. This is what happens when people get too invested in a project and they think they can do everything - write, produce, star, whatever.

I really had no sympathy for ""Gordo the Weirdo."" I understand that being the target of bullies and particularly being abused by a parent can cause permanent psychological damage. So get therapy already. Don't spend your life trying to get revenge on those who harmed you. In doing so, you are still allowing them to control your life rather than taking charge of your own destiny.

I gave the film three stars simply because the two lead actors were good, but I did not like the story at all. It's not a film I would watch twice, and I'm glad I didn't pay to watch it because I would want my money back.",1498780800,,1218,4.408888888888889

7362001,5,B013C6OW1Q,"What can I say, I sympathized with and rooted for Gordo the Weirdo.  Great psychological thriller.  Great revenge movie for any of us who've ever been bullied and/or abused (physical, psychological,...).  One thing I hate is characters like Jason Bateman's who use a mask of extroversion, confidence, charisma, and ""likeability"" to disguise inner cruelty and ugliness.  Seemed so sad that Rebecca Hall's character had to be married to someone such as him.  Thought she and Gordo would have made a much better fit.  Their ""plastic"" friends didn't seem much better - I've known a lot of people like them in my time, especially where I've lived and worked.  Can't stand ""Type A"" people like that.  They tend to just use you, so I don't trust them.  Seemed Gordo just wanted a little closure from those early wounds, or at least a friend or two.  We're all only human and flawed, after all, desiring connection.

I won't spoil the ending, but I'll just say sometimes subtle endings make for the best revenge and maybe I'm biased, but I'm ALWAYS a fan when bullies get their comeuppance.  At the end of the movie I had a great big ol' smile on my mug.  Even felt like dancing to the (out of place?) upbeat pop-ish song that played during the closing credits :)  I know it doesn't happen often in real life, sadly, but I wish all bullies and ""plastic"" people met such a fate.

Anyway, if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :) If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494547200,,1704,4.577557755775578

By chance, they run into Simon's former schoolmate, Gordo (Joel Edgerton).  Gordo proceeds to go out of his way to interact with the couple, odd given that Simon seems to barely remember him.  These gifts and get-togethers become increasingly creepy until Simon finally tells Gordo to stop.  But it's obviously just begun and the fallout destabilizes Simon's carefully crafted life and his attempts to set things straight ultimately reveal the truth about him.  High production values, coupled with excellent acting and careful directing, make up for some minor leaps in the story's logic.  Overshadowed by two raging narcissists, Robyn emerges as the only likable character in the bunch.

7362022,4,B013C6OW1Q,"The Gift is about a man played by Joel Edgerton who happens to meet up with Jason Bateman and his wife (played by Rebecca Hall) at a store.  Joel and Jason went to school together, and even though Jason can't remember who he is, Joel introduces himself.  It seems Joel wants to catch up on old times.  Jason doesn't seem interested and brushes him off.  We find out why later.  They invite the man over for dinner.

It's hard not to notice how snotty Jason's character is acting.  Instead of accepting Joel with open arms so a friendship can develop, Jason gets irritated by Joel's behavior.  Joel is only looking for a friendship and maybe even forgiveness (more on that below).  He often drops by to feed Jason and Rebecca's outdoor fish, fix the television and even chat with Rebecca over a cup of tea.  But Jason's character insists there's something not quite right with Joel and is bothered by the way he frequently drops by.

When Jason and Rebecca drop by Joel's house for dinner, Joel tries to entertain the two by making helicopter sounds as a means to describe the sound of his audio system.  Rebecca and Jason just look at each other confused.  Most people would at least let out a pretend laugh in this situation but not Jason or Rebecca.  Jason apparently has become snot nosed around his wife and is too good for such childish humor.

Turns out there's more to Jason besides being a snob.  We soon learn he used to be a bully.  I figured something was wrong with Jason.  He tries to brush off Joel too many times like he's trying to forget about something.  Rebecca, now concerned for her safety thinking something might be wrong with Joel due to him visiting her and Jason so often, had to find out the hard way by asking old classmates and friends what really happened one day a long time ago when Joel and another kid were in a car together.  Jason being the bully he is took it upon himself to accuse Joel of being raped by this kid, and heartlessly even took it a step further by accusing Joel of being in love with the guy.  This rumor spread around school and humiliated poor Joel.  It's a miracle Joel is being the nice guy he is and helping out around their house.  Now it's time for Jason to man up and be the better person by apologizing, but does he?

When Rebecca confronts Jason later that night about the incident, he gets VERY upset, which to me is a clear indication he's guilty of something that happened when he and Joel were younger.  Guilty of spreading false rumors and being a bully.  Wow.  And what usually happens when someone is guilty of something?  They get defensive and upset when confronted by it.  And guess what- Jason does just that.  He completely tears Rebecca apart, says he shouldn't have to apologize because the world isn't fair, and eventually gets slapped across the face by Rebecca when he brings up the girls who used to pick on her back at school.  Granted it was a light slap, but he deserved it.  Oh and Jason has mental problems too, because apparently he completely made up the whole story with Joel and that other guy in the car.

And that's not all.  Jason is totally crazy.  Even after maning up, locating Joel and apologizing several months after Joel has finally moved on with his life, the conversation turns sour and Joel soon finds himself pushed to the ground.  Jason just can't stop being a bully.  And Joel isn't the only one ticked off at Jason either.  In another scene shortly after during a party suddenly a rock is thrown through a window.  While some might think it's Joel who threw the rock, guess what?  It's actually someone *else* Jason ticked off.  This man goes ballistic that Jason cost him his job.  He was there for revenge and cusses out Jason using every word in the book!  I didn't think it was Joel who threw the rock anyway.  He was probably too shaken up and/or scared after the conversation with Jason to have revenge on his mind.

This movie proves bullies are the worst.  They cause long term damage.  Jason couldn't even sincerely apologize to Joel that night.  Joel knew Jason only showed up because Rebecca made him do it.  He's not a fool.  He knows you can't trust a bully.  I won't spoil the ending but Joel gets his revenge.  Early on in the movie there's a scene where Rebecca passes out, and something crazy happens here.  Finally, justice for Joel's character.  Chew on that one Jason!

However I think Jason already got enough of a terrible surprise when Rebecca reveals she wants to leave him *right after* giving birth to their new baby at the hospital.  She says she didn't want to go home with Jason.  Hey I wouldn't want to go home with a bully either.  Not with a baby in the house.  That's just... wow.  The timing of it.  Right after giving birth!  Goes to show how crazy Jason has become.

The only confusing moment is a scene that happens earlier.  It's when Jason shows up to Joel's ""house"" the next day to confront him about the constant visits... a woman and a man open the door.  It's like Joel was never there.  Maybe Jason was so consumed with anger he couldn't even find the right home.  Who knows.  Even then, what nerve Jason has to question Joel coming around their home so much.  When Joel admits it's because his wife and kids left him and he still has control of the home but doesn't know what will happen next, Jason acts heartless and doesn't even care not only that night, but heartless *again* for extra mental punishment when arriving to Joel's ""house"" the next day to confront Joel.  This proves an apology was the last thing on his mind.  Jason was thinking ""Oh, your wife and kids left you huh?  Let me humiliate you even more by flat out telling you not to come around my house no more!  I'll even tell you this again the next day so the message is clear!""

Perhaps anger is the reason for this more than the bullying.  During the fight with Rebecca earlier resulting in the slap across the face, it seems logical to assume Jason has severe anger issues along with the bullying problem.  He did admit his father didn't treat him well and that's how bullying usually happens- when the father treats the son bad, the son grows up to treat his family bad.  And the crazy part about all this is imagining Jason as a bully.  He's so small and scrawny.  Don't get me wrong I love him as an actor.  He's starred in several funny comedies over the years, but a bully just seems so hard to believe.  But we see it here, in the Gift.",1487462400,,6465,4.43404255319149

He can play any kind of character and after watching ""The Gift"", his talent solidifies it even more. Wow. Rebecca Hall is a revelation as Simon's unassuming wife, Robyn. I've seen Hall in other films (""Everything Must Go"" and ""A Bag of Hammers"") and I always thought she had something special. I'm glad she's getting more recognition now.

7362056,4,B013C6OW1Q,"Darn good thriller.  Enjoyed the film very much.  Even managed to get me to jump out of my seat at one point.

In short, the story of a couple  (Jason Bateman/Rebecca Hall) who after moving into their new home, meets a mysterious ""acquaintance"" (Joel Edgerton) who begins sending them gifts and trailing their moves.  The story has some great twists to it, though the ending leaves quite a few things unexplained.

This is a tough title to recommend blindly.  Not so much for the film itself,  but the Blu-ray presentation.  It's nothing really special as the film was lensed in a very dreary color palette.

I can't really explain the plot without giving anything away, suffice it to say, this film is so original, just when you thought you had something figured out...forget about it, something totally unexpected and incredibly shocking is thrown at you. The director, Joel Edgerton, has thrown away every cliche ever used in a psychological thriller and turned them on their head. The two male leads, Jason Bateman and Joel Edgerton, give incredibly strong performances, always walking on the razor's edge, not revealing what's boiling just below the surface, until the writer/director lets you in on their shocking secrets. Yes, Joel Edgerton pulls down triple duty here as actor, writer, and director, taking on tasks which would overwhelm most people attempting the same feat. Yet, there's never a hint that Edgerton has taken on more than he can juggle, never once dropping the ball. If you're looking for a psychological thriller which throws all the old, tired and predictable cliches and formulas out the window, The Gift is a present you won't want to return.",1476662400,,1214,4.985221674876847

Yes there was a mystery and you slowly learned the darker truth of both the past and the true character of those involved.  The issue is that the way the characters responded to the things that happened was not very realistic and the character of the people were cliche.  I did not walk away from this movie feeling like I had learned anything about life.  And when all secrets were revealed it felt anti climactic and at best, mildly disturbing.  Yet even the disturbing parts seemed a little odd and not believable enough to really leave an impact on the viewer.

The best part about this movie was the viewer was given enough clues to guess what was really going on.  So it was fun to try to figure things out before secrets were revealed.

Overall this movie was just okay.  Good if you like movies about relationships and/or mysteries.",1475798400,,1037,4.457446808510638

What I like about The Gift, however, are the performances. Whenever Ive seen Jason Bateman, hes played a likable guy. Maybe Ive missed edgier performances, but in The Gift he plays a total a-hole so convincingly that I cant believe hes ever played anything but an a-hole. Its a subtle, completely believable performance.

The other actors are also quite good, and I like the movies look. So maybe not the greatest story, but still a movie worth watching for some strong performances.",1475798400,,729,4.967213114754099

The menace starts from the first scene: couple buys a nice new home that is literally a glass house - glass walls, anyone can see in, and does - Including an old high school acquaintance of the husband, whom he doesn't remember...or does he? The old chum becomes intrusive, at first subtly, then less subtly, and then to the point of harassment. The police can do nothing; he's broken no laws, he's just ""weird."" But his behavior brings about changes in the husband that trigger dark, old secrets - which make his wife suspect that she's never really known him. This story is a masterpiece of mind manipulation, shifting identities, unraveling relationships. Life explodes.

7362228,5,B013C6OW1Q,"This is one fine thriller made by a new commer director/ actor Joel Edgerton. He was mostely acted for movies and suddenly he made this feature debut and the result was a fine gift for all the audiences.
 The story is all predictable and the reason this movie is a fine one is becuase of the great actors acting well and how the director created the tention and each moments not the whole story's sake.
 I myslf was a prey when I was a elememtary school student as a loner and to get rid of that tag, I marked another boy and began to harass him.
 So I know pretty much about this story and how the Joel Edgerton felt.
 The story is about Jason Bateman when he was a student, he oppressed Joel Edgerton and even spread words about him that is not true which eventually almost killed him. That small action, for him it was but for Joel Edgerton it was everything, caused his entire life. It ruled his entire life and even after he grew up, he stil suffered from being lonely and depressed, not being confident. and some strange behavior always follows.
 When he appears again in Jason's family where him and his wife are happliy living, Jason first even didn't remembered him. But when he did rememberd, Jason wanted to get rid of him. 1. Because he had guilty feeling 2. He acted strange somehow.
 Eventually Jason was beging rude to him and his lovely wife didn't liked it. Also his wife Rebecca Hall found out the relationship between him and Joel Edgerton and felt really bad about it and asked strongly to his husband to say sorry to his friend because otherwise he might act really ugly later. He've got nothing to loose after all.
 But, Jason's old habbit is not gone and he went to see Joel Edgerton and almost destryed him.
 Being really angry, Joel came to Jason's home, he put some drugs into Rebecca Hall's sports drink and she was fainted.
 Now the thing is did he raped her or not? I bet he didn't. but Joel sent Jason a bunch of dvds to show the small clue that he might did something to her which drove Jason crazy.
 The movie ends up that way.
 The main story of this movie is don't break othere people's heart! Otherwise, someday your heart will be broken too.
 Very simple and clear.
 After what I've done to that poor boy when I was young, I never did anything bad to other people in my life. I know what it is to do bad things to people.
 One of my family did bad things to me for 20 years and that still effects my life. That is another example. One small thing can kill other people even if you think it is just nothing.
 Jason said to her wife that it was just a kid stuff. It was not. It was everything to Joel Edgerton.

Talk about something else, sometimes it is good for the director to act for his own movie if it is not the main roll. Joel did a fine job for the supporting roll.
 I myself made only one feature so far but made 10 shorts and during grad school, we all had to do more then 20 theater plays acted in front of all the school friends and faculties as a directing class students. I myself also acted for one feature as an assistant director at the same time for a mid budget feature as well. It was fun. If it doesn't interrupt your directing, it is good to act in your feature since it is you who knows better then anyone who can act for any roll.

Ending, this is a fine thriller you shouldn't miss.",1460160000,,3342,4.21978021978022

Well the Gift takes that one step further when Bateman's character Simon is in a check out line and the guy behind him is ecstatic to have run into him telling him they went to school together. Simon introduces his wife to the man, and needs to ask him his as he has no idea who he was, he then tells Gordo they've got somewhere to be and asks Gordo for his number but clearly has no intention of ever ringing it. Soon a bottle of wine with a bow and a card show up on the doorstep of Simon and his wife's new house. Gordo clearly wants to pick up where his high school days left off, but Simon doesn't want a thing to do with the guy he and his friends named Gordo Weirdo but his wife doesn't want him to be rude to the man.  Gordo's quest for friendship becomes heavier and creepier, with more gifts and pop ins.

7362286,5,B013C6OW1Q,You see what happens when you poison other peoples minds with ideas. The story itself is a simple one.  A young married couple move from Chicago to LA and run into someone the husband went to high school with.  The man begins to leave gifts at the couples home and the wife believes he is stalking them but the husband keeps assuring her that nothing is wrong and he took care of it.  However the more she learns of the man and her husband's past the more she realizes she doesn't know the man she married.  The story itself is about how the past effects the present.  It is about bullying and the effects it has on both the bully and the bullied. The movie is slow and very dark but then most good thrillers are. They take time to set up the pieces but once they do they knock them down. How easy it is to poison a mind.....how easy it is to have your mind poisoned by the an idea even if it is untrue....especially if it is untrue.,1455062400,,933,4.132596685082873

I liked it (nice thriller, not gory) and decided to go ahead and get it from Amazon along with a few other new movies.  The only thing that disappoints me upon receiving the DVD is the cover!  It's a minor thing, but it hacks me off!  Almost in the center of the cover is a bright yellow and red ""badge"", if you will, that reads, ""CERTIFIED FRESH ROTTEN TOMATOES.COM"".  WTH IS THAT?  Still like the movie, glad to have it in my film library, but that cover does anger me!  Wasn't on the cover when I ordered the DVD!",1454889600,3,599,4.112068965517241

And the story is pretty cool, although you will find a few spots where you wish things would've been written differently and more imaginatively. But, ignore that, because Jason Bateman and Joel Edgerton do such a good job with their characters. Definitely not what you think Jason Bateman would do, and so that's a very nice surprise. I won't ruin it for you, which makes this hard to review, but there are many twists and turns in this film. Definitely recommend.",1454630400,,546,4.639175257731959

7362381,3,B013C6OW1Q,"This movie is an okay suspense movie starring Jason Bateman.  It's got some drama that he caused from his past coming to the present to haunt him.  At first you root for him to succeed and for him and his wife to make it through together to the end, but the more you learn about Bateman's character, the more you realize he is a douche and deserves what is coming to him.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

The movie lags a little at the beginning and in the middle, but it does start to pick up toward the end of the film where everything comes to a head.  We find out that Bateman did horrible things to the Gordo character and made his life a living hell when they were in high school.  So you slowly start rooting for the Gordo character because you want to see him get his revenge on his old high school bully.  The ending has a really good twist and will make you gasp when you figure it out, so make sure you keep watching!

The movie loses a star because it does drag for a while and it's boring until act 3.  Also there is a part where their dog goes missing and they think Gordo is responsible, then the dog shows up perfectly fine.  They are confused but are happy to have the dog back and they move on.  But I want to know where the dog went and what happened to him while he was gone.  Those 2 things cost the movie 2 stars in my opinion.

After relocating back to his hometown a husband with his wife bump into an old schoolmate and this begins a roller coaster ride of a movie that never stops until the very shocking ending.
So many twists and turns here as the old school mate makes the married couple begin to question their marriage and their friends and even the job security that has brought them to where they are.
This movie has it all 3 superb performances and all the shocking plot twist that weave in and out leaving the viewer with one good and shocking ending.",1452384000,3,705,4.293233082706767

It was one of those movies that looks really good in the commercials, but after you watch it, you're scratching your head wondering why you wasted money and time on it.

The entire movie, especially the ending, was very unrealistic.  It's an ok movie to watch if it's free on Netflix or you get it from the library, but I personally wouldn't spend any money on it.",1452384000,,541,4.316831683168317

7362386,4,B013C6OW1Q,I really enjoyed the twists and unexpected turns in this movie. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. If you're in the mood for a popcorn thriller this is a great movie to watch. More intelligent than is typical for this genre.,1452297600,,231,4.2727272727272725
7362387,4,B013C6OW1Q,"Time will tell whether Joel Edgerton joins the exclusive club of the famous actors turned talented and successful film directors or sticks to the acting career but his directorial debut, ""The Gift"", was a nice gift to the fans of the psychological thrillers in the Alfred Hitchcock's fashion or, rather, their new variety, ""marriage thrillers"" that follow the success of David Fincher's provocative Gone Girl. Edgerton, who gave a bravura performance in the fellow Aussie's, Buz Luhrmann's adaptation of Great Gatsby, hit the trifecta with writing the screenplay, directing, and producing The Gift, and also playing one of the three main characters.

Edgerton undoubtedly loves the good thriller and proves to know how to make one. The Gift starts with a married couple, Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn Callen (Rebecca Hall), relocated from Chicago to a suburban Los Angeles neighborhood after Simon finds a new job outside the city that should propel him to the corporate heights. While out buying supplies for their new picture-perfect home, they run into Gordon ""Gordo"" Moseley (Joel Edgerton), a former high school classmate of Simon's who Simon claims to have completely forgotten about. Soon after, Gordo begins dropping in unannounced, usually when Simon is at work. He sends thoughtful housewarming gifts for the couple, neatly wrapped in the bright paper, with the bow attached, accompanied with nice handwritten card in the red envelope.

Without giving too much away, it should be said that whatever started as yet another retelling of the ""Fatal Attraction"" type story, turned out as the dissections of such ugly but persisting realities of life as bullying, human cruelty, unconscious desire for dominating that would start in someone's past and would cover all aspects and spheres of human communicating, including school, family, the workplace, and neighborhood. Main idea of Edgerton's film as shared by director himself during an interview is acknowledgment of one's past, admitting to the wrong doings in order to be able to build the future. But it brings a question: do we change as time goes by? Are we able to admit the guilt that went unpunished and to face the consequences? Can we predict to what extend will our words and deeds affect someone's life? Someone whom we won't even recognize if run across accidentally after many years?

Edgerton plays with the viewers' expectations and takes them to the unpredictable directions adding to the plot more layers and depths. The way he tells the story while building up the suspense and creating disturbing atmosphere is remarkable. He almost convinces the viewers that they could guess easily what would happen next yet when they expect it the least, he pulls the rug from under their feet. As a director, his use of the multiple glass surfaces is masterful. The heavily windowed houses in the nice South California area, Hollywood Hills, are as important to the plot as three main characters. Huge windows and glass doors seem to bring people closer but, at the same time, they stand as the walls of alienation and estrangement. Massive glass elements soon become gloomy threatening messengers of impending psychological horror which comes from the sins of the past that have not been acknowledged. Danger may lurk behind the misted glass door while you take a shower in the safety of your house. There is a silhouette disappearing in the air in the manner of Keyser Sze behind the thick matt glass doors in the hospital. The movie keeps surprising us by changing the viewpoints, by showing that what we see is not always what actually goes on in front of us. It makes us ask themselves, do we really know these closest to us, someone whom we think we share the intimate knowledge of ultimate closeness with.

One of the delicious surprises the movie provides is the characters development that drives the story and moves it in the different directions. Both, Rebecca Hall and Jason Bateman play real people, complex and alive, not just two-dimensional carton figures. Jason Bateman, especially, impresses by bringing out dark sides of Simon's confident, successful, charismatic persona. But the best gift Edgerton keeps to the very end. For the movie which important and repeated over and over image are nice wrapped gift boxes of the different sizes and shapes, the writer/director refuses to wrap up the ending and attach the colorful bow to it. The Gift's conclusion is open but strangely satisfying. What goes around comes around, and bygones don't want to be bygones.",1452211200,,4546,5.081659973226238

Yet, the story contains two major plot points that didn't resonate with me. The whole ending can only work if one particular thing happened. If it didnt, then it makes no sense at all and relies too much on coincidence. When your ultimate twist does not make sense, then your whole movie is ruined. Plus, one of the major plot point about Jason Batemans hidden action which destroys him at the end is, again, too coincidental. Its the kind of situation where everything just magically falls into place at the right time for the sake of the two big movie twists. While its still is a semi-good start from a debutant director, this particular first film relies too much on coincidences for its twists.

The difference is that in the Spanish film we see things from Cesar's perspective, and the boyfriend of the heroine is a secondary character.  In this film, we see things from the heroine and her husband's perspective, with Gordo being a secondary character.

The only difference in this story was that the main character continued to vilify people to get ahead.

Jason Bateman was great- he reminds us that he can do funny and serious and evil.

With this movie, though, the plot was so obvious, I had it figured out within the first 20 minutes,  Maybe the high ratings were based upon Bateman's acting.  I hope so because otherwise, the script was so predictable- I sat through 3/4 of it already knowing the gist of what was to come (not the details, but they didn't really matter).  The ending was not really as dramatic as it lead up to be.  I wasn't worried- it was all based on games already, so there was no reason to expect the unexpected.",1449187200,,1097,4.354679802955665

Well, I just wasn't as shocked as I wanted to be once the unanswered questions were answered. Jason Bateman's character was not as bad of a guy as I thought he would be, he didn't do as horrible of a thing in the past that you would think to make someone react the way Joel Edgerton's character reacted some twenty years later. And even when Bateman's adult bully came out, he still wasn't so bad. Still, I liked his performance. He worked with what he got. Joel Edgerton on the other hand just wasn't creepy enough. And the big reveal seemed kind of anticlimactic. The ending is always the hardest part and this movie proved that notion, even before the ending. Not a bad movie though, but not as good as I hoped.",1449100800,,817,4.381578947368421

7362497,1,B013C6OW1Q,I was unfortunately suckered in by the positive reviews that other Amazon users gave. Most of the scenes in this film occur in places that I don't have the privilege to live near or visit (ultra expensive modern houses or high rise corporate offices). Maybe that should be enough to make me feel like I got some sort of escape from the hum drum ordinary life that I live. The husband and wife come off as being too stupid to occupy the socioeconomic status that they appear in. This movie's plot is very disturbing plot and never should have been made into a movie.

Jason Bateman and Joel Edgerton play their parts very well.

Story is a very good lesson on how we can be deceived by first impressions.  A person who initially comes off as level-headed and responsible, is often a detached, cold-hearted jerk.  The oddball is often a normal human being that is struggling with past trauma.  This movie is thought provoking and enjoyable.

I've seen J B in the Change up and Horrible Bosses, just the first one (for the record).

It's just that these type of movies....the guy who is weird.....seems to always do predictable things to scare the hell out of someone....then chase them around wielding a deadly weapon. This movie was really different, with more than one twist. There is a happily married couple, whose life is interrupted when supposedly an old school chum shows up. You are watching, and think this guy is a jerk and very odd. But it doesn't end there. Many things involved in the plot, and rather than go into spoilers, give this movie a try.

The film generally lacks any urgency or stakes, so though things get generally darker, the situations are never particularly thrilling or mysterious. Some of its tricks are poorly telegraphed and ruined.

But while theres one decent twist towards the end, the grand finale is nicely over-the-top and insane. One can see how this film was designed from its big finish, then pieced together backwards. It wouldve been better if there was something more interesting in the first 95% of the film. So two stars for the meat of the film, with a 4.5 finish.",1448409600,,704,4.966101694915254

It's not going to win any awards but kept me entertained which is more then I can say to some bigger name movies I recently viewed.

7362636,5,B013C6OW1Q,"Australian Joel Edgerton is an exceptionally talented man  he is highly regarded as an actor, a writer, and director  and he brings all three of those talents to the screen in this psychological thriller THE GIFT. The dialogue is exceptionally fine, the pacing is excellent and the manner in which the story unfolds holds many surprises as well as a number of fine lessons in interpersonal responses.

Simon (Jason Bateman  so fine to see him step away from the line of brainless comedies in which he was type cast!), and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) are a young married couple whose life is going just as planned until a chance encounter with an acquaintance from Simon's high school sends their world into a harrowing tailspin. Simon doesn't recognize Gordo (Joel Edgerton) at first, but after a series of uninvited encounters and mysterious gifts prove troubling, a horrifying secret from the past is uncovered after more than 20 years. As Robyn learns the unsettling truth about what happened between Simon and Gordo, she starts to question: how well do we really know the people closest to us, and are past bygones ever really bygones?

This is a smart, sophisticated film, beautifully photographed by Eduard Grau and with a musical score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans that maintains the suspense. The cast  the three leads as well as the supporting roles  - is outstanding. This is a movie that is far better than the usual thriller. Highly Recommended.

7362637,3,B013C6OW1Q,"I don't feel like I wasted money renting this....good acting. You keep wondering where this is going. I thought they could have justified the stalker's actions with a more compelling reason. Even though the reasoning behind his anger is understandable, I would have felt more satisfied by a bigger slight than what was revealed....because if the guy had been that torn up, wouldn't he have tracked down JB's character when they were out of state, rather than when he moved back this hometown? Unlike what the trailer suggests, this movie didn't have me in awe days later. If you are on top of your psych-thriller game, you probably could predict the outcome. Still worth watching even to see how hot Jason Bateman looks after all these years.  O.o",1448150400,,747,4.8359375

Many plot twists kept it from being predictable, yet also made it a bit too confusing; it leaves too many loose ends, sinking to the level of putting it to the viewer to fill in the blanks, and a few plot holes, which doesn't work well here. Too much of the plot is explained second hand, and hearsay (especially from two decades ago) is not convincing.

I love movies with a twist. Especially movies that leave me thinking about them after they have ended. This movie is one of those movies. The twist is not a huge shocking twist, but it is a very interesting one. One that leaves you wondering. I've seen the movie, and I'm still not 100% certain of the facts, and I find that very thought provoking. I may need to re-watch this one before I can make any conclusions.

The acting is good. I was able to form attachments to the characters that made me concerned for what was happening to them. Jason Bateman especially impressed me with his ability to step outside of the typical role types that he usually plays. I had previously only seen him in comedy roles (which he is very good at). In this movie he plays in a more serious role, and he does so exceptionally well. He is a more versatile actor than I had previously thought.

It doesnt depend on approaching jump-scares to keep you on the edge of your seat  although there might be a few of those. Rather, most of the suspense comes from its characters unsettled looks. They sense something that is going to send their lives tilt. They know something intuitively that they cant quite articulate, can't quite admit. Even the family dogs prolonged, doleful look will send chills down your spine.

The plot evolves in the direction of a classic tale of revenge. However, who is going to get revenge on whom  or who deserves to get revenge on whom  and the why and how of it  will keep you guessing. This is an intelligent, engrossing film.",1447200000,,729,4.708661417322834

7362851,3,B013C6OW1Q,Good but not what I was expecting. Spoiler alert.....stop reading if you plan to watch this movie. Based on the previews I thought Jason Bateman was going to be the victim but this movie was basically about him being a bully. The ending was completely unexpected which was refreshing but it just didn't seem real. I would recommend this movie but very glad I didn't see it in the theater. I would like to point out that I couldn't like one character in the movie. They made the lead female role very weak. You ask yourself how she could feel sorry for Gordo who is completely weird and not a likeable character I mean come on give her a little backbone. Even after the whole pretending they went to Gordo's house she still felt sorry for him and wanted Jasons character to apologize. At that point I wanted to turn it off because it was offending to my gender. If anything I think the women would have noticed the creepy factor first. Typically a movie will give you one character to like or at least root for. I found myself at the end thinking they all deserved whatever happened.,1447027200,,1082,4.442211055276382

7362861,5,B013C6OW1Q,"First, I loved this movie. 2nd, this movie was released to theaters on the day of my 20 year Highschool Reunion. I was picked on, by many. I grew strong, smart, and then... I out grew those small little mites that scrape by in the ratchet little town I was raised in.  I took my lessons learned by bullies, and used it to serve our country in the Army. (Just like the guy in the movie.)
Except I was Ranger qualified...and an excellent specimen. I later became an RN, worked for Hospice, specializing in pediatric hospice. Then I bought and managed a group home in PHX, AZ. with my super hot super smart wife- raised our daughter, who makes me so proud, and sold it and retired to a little beach town here in Southern Oregon.
  At the reunion, I felt pity for most of those who were mean and cruel to me and many others. I forgave them- but I do enjoy my great life, blessed in so many ways...I barely noticed the missing Lung/breathing capacity that happened during the war. I spent so many days working to get back to the old me...I forgot what it was even like to have been bullied. I thank Him, , and my wonderful wife. Also the VA for therapy and care that was pretty good at times.
This movie made me so thankful.

Jason Bateman is Brilliant, surprising us once again with ability to pull us in- then fire us up! Excellent movie with great ending!",1447027200,,1353,4.294117647058823

7362946,2,B013C6OW1Q,"I wish I had read more reviews before choosing to rent this movie- It's nearly 2 hours I will never get back, and I don't think it deserved my money.  The acting was fine, the first 45 minutes held my interest and I appreciated the pacing and plot.  It starts with a sort of yuppy-ish couple moving to CA and bumping into an ""old friend"" from the husband's high school. There's tension as the old friend seems to come on too strong in a creepy attempt at friendship, meanwhile the couple is having their own issues. Around the hour mark I started wondering how long it was going to take to get to the ""AHA"" moment.  I generally do well with slower paced movies, but this really started to drag. The main characters make some dumb decisions which I found irritating and made no sense except to force a means to an end. I found the marriage of the main characters unrealistic and irksome.  But what really was ridiculous was the ending or final ""surprise"". It was just crass and dumb.  ENDING SPOILER ALERT: The ""bad guy"" gives the impression that he secretly raped the wife and their newborn baby is his, not the husband's. This is retribution for the husband bullying him in high school. I thought this was ridiculous and couldn't understand it at all.  Umm, if you are that worried, wouldn't you just get a paternity test? It seemed obvious he didn't really rape the wife because that would be an easily convicted crime.  The baby was suppose to look like the creepy guy? It didn't make sense at all. The whole thing just seemed pointless at the end. It was a long draw out to a crass and dumb ending that could've been avoided, and the husband was loathsome (as he was suppose to be I guess, good acting by Justin Bateman) and the wife was a moron to marry him in the first place and a numb-nuts for trusting high-school creepy guy.

The villain ran the gamut from nutzoid sociopath in his secret life to obnoxious unloveable  egotist in his public life.  Some spectrum!  What possible basis was there for anyone to like him, ever?  Yet his likeability was a critical element to the plot and to the motivation of the principal character whom we cared about.  Not everything can or needs to be plausible in this kind of thriller but some emotional human coherence is needed if we are to care about what happens.  Here we are given no reason or basis for someone to care about or love him.

And the ""justice"" exacted at the end is utterly repellant.

Overall, it was worth a watch and Gordo is genuinely creepy, so that part was nailed. The story had too many holes in it for my taste though personally, and kept wondering why the movie and story was told as such. That killed some of the suspense and the husband/wife interaction by the main characters wasn't very good either, and not all the believable.

7363029,5,B013C6OW1Q,"This movie is not a cheap teen thriller. It is much more of an adult thriller, a psychological thriller. It is not too edgy, rather just enough so as to give enough of a thrill for thrill-seekers, some drama, and a story about a marriage that at first glance appears to be pretty perfect, but unravels quickly.
I thoroughly enjoyed Jason Bateman in this film. His performance was so raw and real. He allows you to forget he is a comedian. His dramatic scenes are very dramatic. Perhaps his character is meant to be disliked, maybe some would feel that he deserves what he gets. But he was so compelling and down to earth that I couldn't help but root for him.
This might be a propoganda for bullying, however, nothing gives a victim an excuse to be a criminal himself. The victim in this movie is meant to be both hated and sympathlzed with. Watch it, and see for yourself why there are so many gray areas in this movie. And they only add go the suspense.
This will not satisfy those seeking gore and blood--there was almost none of that. This movie takes the high road, and relies on psychological tensions rather than gimmicks.
Excellent, well-done movie that deserves five stars!",1446508800,,1182,4.553990610328638

The mystery comes from the story, and the subtle manner in which the movie plays them out. the movie takes it's time to devolep the circumstanes,and build on the uncertainty of these characters.. so some patience by the viewer is required. The actors which include Jason Bateman ,Rebbeca Hall,and Joel Edgerton- ( Gordo) who directed the actual film,are absolutely perfect. They prefer to play there roles as if your actually in the room with them. As if to ground this very tired genre with some genuine believability for a change. The score is only used when necessary, and provides a tone rather then  the usual bombastic intrusiveness that tells you to jump. However predictability does insue  in this film eventually, but you don't care. You're absolutely invested by the story and characters you just need to see these events play out.

Story goes Simon (Jason Bateman) and his gal Robyn (Rebecca Hall) have just moved to Los Angeles and are mundanely gathering nesting supplies when an old acquaintance of Simons stops to reacquaint himself. This old chum, Gordon (Joel Edgerton) aka Gordo, seems nice enough

Then slowly the film simmers to a wild bunny-boiling roll, as things go from, Hmm, thats a tad off, to down right skin-crawlingly frightening. See, after the no-big-whoop casual Hello from the past, Gordo leaves a gift upon their doorstep, and then ever so oddly, insinuates himself on the scene; semi-stalker-esque style.

You can often cut the tension with a six foot tall bronze egret sculpture. And, as you discover Simon may not be such a swell guy he play in his real life, you also discover, this meek-seeming Gordo is turning out to be more a heat-seeking drone of revenge; albeit hes got a pretty good reason to hold that decades old grudge.

Which brings us to the glorious, Take a look inside yourself, point of the film: are you okay with your past deeds? You know, back when you were but some cliche-label in say, high school. Or were you that bully who left a wake of hurt souls in your cowardice? The Gift is gonna scare the bejesus out of you  either way actually. Its scenes are conducted artfully for maximum gottchas. And the music (Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriann) and perfectly effectual frequent lack of it, helps glue you to the screen.

The cast is perfectly placed upon their celluloid Chess board. Jason Batman can always be relied upon to deliver. Jasons swell on the eyes - thats a given - hes the everyday proverbial manly-man gift if you will. But, director Joel Edgertons gonna ruin your rosy, ""Bet he even cooks great too, viewjust warning you.

And Joel Edgerton plays the somethings-just-off Gordo too. Its a super on-the-edge-of-madness start that crescendos into one of films most memorable creeps; theres even subtle (usually) nods to some other super psycho films enthusiasts are sure to notice.

Meanwhile, it is the lovely Rebecca Hall who is our POV and it works. She is a perfect host for our journey into the obscene.

Finally, huge kudos to The Gifts superb knowing editing (Luke Doolan). The way a film is sliced and formed can make or break a scenes power. And, here he shimmied many of The Gifts greatest dibby-dabs of horror to start as quiet as three-week-old purring kittens gleefully bunny-hopping down a hall. As we gleefully follow, blissfully unaware, they lead us right smack into a gaggle of rabid Rhesus monkeys that spring from behind that perfectly ordinary, yet deceptively designed, mid-century door; terror.

Get this, see this, and share this. If you're an inspiring filmmaker, watch the commentary after viewing the first time; great tips on how to let things go in the name of a better film. Admittedly, younger viewers may not 'dig' this = nothing goes boom, and short attention-span Theater-goers be warned ;) <- Not insulting, just that this film requires a bit of letting it develop...",1446422400,,3258,4.833034111310592

After a chance encounter with Simon's former high school classmate, ""Gordo"" (Edgerton) a ""gift"" appears & the story unfolds.  Although, this starts out reminiscence of the stylish 90's ""yuppie"" psycho dramas, it turns into something unique & unexpected of what's implied by the movie's trailer.

Unlike ""Insidious,"" the sense of dread and tension isn't centered around a ""paranormal"" evil. Rather, it centers around a tale of deceit & secrecy, a mixture of the past and present with some surprising twists along the way.  A genuine dread is created from all the unwanted thoughts we all share  about who we are and who we want to be.

Bateman and Hall give strong performances. Edgerton not only gives a strong performance as ""Gordo"" but directs the film as well. Admittedly, the final twist caught me completely by surprise. However, the rather abrupt ending was my only complaint.",1446249600,3,1040,5.203592814371257

Subtle, methodical, clever story about bullying with a psychological thriller edge. Not for those with short attention spans or who prefer obvious and blatant thrills and immediate gratification and predictable story lines.  Will personally affect those who have been bullied, with a cautionary tale of how school-age bullies can grow up into adult bullies and how some victims of bullying may turn into bullies themselves.  Such lessons woven into intelligent twists and turns thanks to superb writing.
Jason Bateman tends to pick solid screenplays and he did that again here.  Not as good as his comedies, but still worth a rental and you've got your ""what should I/we watch"" dilemma solved with 2 hours well spent with some good conversation on a social issue when the credits roll.",1446163200,38,866,5.041958041958042

The story centers around married couple Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall, who have just moved from Chicago to Los Angeles, Batemans home town, where he is to start a new executive job.  While shopping for furniture, the couple encounters Edgerton, who knew Bateman in high school.

Suddenly, Edgerton begins stalking the couple with gifts left on their doorstep and unannounced visits that make Rebecca uneasy.

And, thats all Im going to tell you about the plot, because I don't want to spoil this Hitchcock-like thriller and the message it delivers.

The cast, which includes Allison Tolman is uniformly excellent.

The Blu-ray Combo Pack from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, which includes DVD and Digital HD editions of the movie, has many several extras: an alternate ending, deleted scenes, two brief making of featurettes and audio commentary by Edgerton.

7363170,4,B013C6OW1Q,"The Gift is definitely worth a watch.  I noticed other reviews had complained about the the pace of this film.  Saying it was too slow an the plot didn't move along quick enough.  I disagree.  In order to have the proper effect and make the ending reach its full potential, I think the set up had to be carefully constructed and methodically planned out.  To appreciate the concept of the film you have to go through the events and the development of the characters with meticulous planning.  Jason Bateman was outstanding.  He played the role perfectly and had you teetering on how you really felt about him. It's a film that makes you think and really evaluate how your actions can effect others.  Not for everyone, but definitely worth a view for those you enjoy a good psychological yarn",1446163200,,791,4.640287769784172
7363171,5,B013C6OW1Q,"""The Gift"" is great! This is how the story goes: Simon and Robyn are a young married couple whose life is going just as planned until a chance encounter with an acquaintance from Simon's high school sends their world into a harrowing tailspin. Simon doesn't recognize Gordo at first, but after a series of uninvited encounters and mysterious gifts prove troubling, a horrifying secret from the past is uncovered after more than 20 years. As Robyn learns the unsettling truth about what happened between Simon and Gordo, she starts to question: how well do we really know the people closest to us, and are past bygones ever really bygones?

The cast led by Jason Bateman (as Simon), Rebecca Hall (as Robyn) & Joel Edgerton (also wrote, produced and directed the film) (as Gordo) is great. The directing, story & screenplay by Edgerton is great.

The music by Danny Bensi & Saunder Jurriaans is great. The cinematography by Eduard Grau is great. The film editing by Luke Doolan is great. The casting by Terri Taylor is great. The production design by Richard Sherman is great. The art direction by Lorin Flemming is great. The set decoration by Matthew Flood Ferguson, set dressings by Casey Van Maanen & Brandon Conner is great. The costume design by Terry Anderson is great. The stunts coordinated by Nash Edgerton (brother of Joel) is great. The special effects coordinated by John Hartigan is great. The prosthetic make-up design by Debbie Zoller is great. The visual effects coordinated by Matthew Noren & supervised by James David Hattin is great.

This is a great, well-made and well-crafted suspense psychological thriller that is entertaining and well-done. Joel Edgerton has made a solidly, well-crafted directorial debut and he is also solid as usual as Gordo, as is the story & screenplay. Jason Bateman & Rebecca Hall is just as solid as well as Simon & Robyn. This is one of the best thrillers of the year, so far and also was (or is) one of the best movies of the summer season, as well, too.",1446163200,,2005,4.805797101449276

7363176,3,B013C6OW1Q,"I don't think it was ever explained how Gordon knew where Simon lived as to where he could send wine to Simon's house. (if it was explained, then I missed it.)  As for the fake molestation story, they should've KEPT that as being fact, and made Simon out to be the molester. That way, his wife taking the baby and leaving him would've made more sense.  I know...I know...too easy, right? People would've figured that out immediately after Simon's sister began telling the story of the unknown molester in a car, so they had to throw us a, ""curve ball."" However, that curve ball would've made for a better story than the whole nonsense about lying about Gordon's sexuality and being a victim of molestation. To me, this movie came off as an anti-bullying PSA. ""Don't bully kids because they'll grow up to be annoying pests who'll send gifts to your house."" Give me a break! I also didn't care for Simon's wife and how dense she was. She investigates her husband, but kept brushing off Gordon's weird behavior as him just being a nice guy. We have Gordo popping up at their home while she was there alone. Not to mention, how he invited the couple to someone else's home but lied and said it was his, along with being the main suspect in killing the fish he gave them as a gift and kidnapping their dog. Yet, this idiot of a wife kept giving Gordon the benefit of the doubt but was ready to separate from her husband after finding out he was a high school bully and doing background checks on people? Not condoning Simon's behavior, but Gordo's behavior was just as horrible if not worse! I really hated how we never got to see Simon tell his wife that she may have been raped and their son may not be his.

7363181,4,B013C6OW1Q,"Married couple, Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall), move from Chicago to California to start a new life, no looking back. Gordon -aka Gordo (Joel Edgerton) is still holding on to what happened in the past.

I don't go to the theater as much as I used to, but when I saw the trailer, I knew I'd watch this movie when it was available to rent from home. What does bygones be bygones mean? What exactly happened twenty-five years ago? I wanted the answers to these questions.

In the beginning, everything seemed so good between Simon and Robyn that a person would think they had very few marital problems. And maybe that was true back in Chicago, but it became clear in California that Robyn didn't really know her husband.

Jason Bateman's performance was impressive. I liked Simon, then I didn't, then I felt bad for the man. Joel Edgerton's performance got me to view this movie twice. I watched on my own, and then I watched with my husband. He thought Gordo was a  weirdo, but I saw a man who was still hurting after so many years have gone by and I could understand why. Rebecca Hall did very well as the kind-hearted, ""too nice"" woman.

I didn't know until after I saw the movie that Joel Edgerton wrote and directed. He did good.

I like all sorts of movies and psychological terror is certainly something I could get down with, but this was just so unnecessary I can't even put words to it. I don't get it. I will not be giving any spoilers away.

7363184,5,B013C6OW1Q,"I had very little knowledge of the THE GIFT before watching it, but since it was said to be a ""drama, thriller, action and mystery"",I had to give it a closer look and I am so glad that I did! This film is outstanding in many ways. One was definitely, the multi-talented Joel Edgerton who not only starred in the movie, but also wrote and directed it;he plays the character known as ""Gordo"". The other two talented actors in their own right's were Rebecca Hall, who played ""Robin"" and Jason Bateman, who played ""Simon"", Robin's husband. It starts out with Simon and Robin running into Gordo at a department store. It's all too obvious that Simon doesn't remember Gordo until a few remarks are made about High School and then Simon realizes who this guy is and he quickly tries to make introductions while walking out of the department store. Simon and his wife have moved from Chicago back to Simon's childhood town, near a big city where he has accepted a high salaried, status symbol type of job and is on the track to ""making it big"". BTW: This is all revealed in the first 15-20 minutes of the film.

But, one of the things that drew me in immediately was the tension filled, cut-it-with-a-knife scene in the store at the very beginning of the film. It definitely sets the pace as the story evolves and reveals more and more as the film is played out. At first glance, it looks as if Robin and Simon are starting over after what looked like a miscarriage and that they're not too much different than any young couple trying to make their dreams come true, but then Gordo comes to their house, uninvited, with a bottle of wine and a card, kind of saying ""let's let be bygones be bygones"" which Robin clearly doesn't get and Simon acts like he has no idea what Gordo means, so they reluctantly let him in and talk about the old ""High School days when Simon was BMOC"" and after a short while, Gordo leaves. But, one can sense there is a lot more to this story as one watches it unfold from Robin's POV to Simon's POV to Gordo's POV.

I don't want to give any more of the plot away, but this film does deliver lots of drama, plenty of suspense, action and nail-biting mystery! The characters are all extremely well developed, drawing the viewer in closer and closer, bu to what? It seems as the plot develops, we are drawn into behavior in a few of the characters that defy any reasonable explanation, as each one is exposed in ways they never would have been, if not for the meeting in the store.

It's a slow burn, but is never boring as the plot gets deeper and deeper and Robin is especially questioning if she even knows THIS Simon she's with in California, what ploy or deception may Gordo be up to or is he just taking advantage of a situation from long ago and what is Simon truly capable of? We are seeing he's very controlling, but how controlling? Would he be able to create such an enigma? THIS is a brilliant and creative script and it pulls one in from the beginning and does not let go. Unpredictable, mysterious, suspenseful ? ALL of that and more.",1445990400,5,3063,4.408127208480566

What I thought was going to be another formulaic horror/thriller turned out to be one of my all-time favorite films

The preview for this film must have been put together from a write-up from another film provided to the editor along with some random segments from this film. It doesn't seem to capture anything about the movie, except maybe the foreboding-terror tone present at points.

This is an incredible story, beautiful acted and directed with such a natural feel that it comes across as voyeuristic.
The characters have such charisma, and develop so smoothly, that every moment is edge-of-your-seat. The film-making is cinematic and professional, with gorgeous lighting and engaging framing.

7363200,4,B013C6OW1Q,"In our world, Jason Bateman has generally played our decent self, even our better angel.  In such roles he has always been clean-shaven.  Thus each twitch at the corner of his mouth has revealed humor, wit, and ironic acceptance of being done wrong by the goofiness and foibles of others.

In The Gift, Bateman wears the scruffiest beard conceivable.  It covers and so hints at motives darksomething that does know bounds but still is deeper or more sinister than we might  imagine or like.

An intriguing effect in TG is that while we witness a series of sly hints and suggestions, we seem to suppress our own awareness: we are complicit in ignoring telling details that are subtly presented but which we sort out at very near the movies end.  The performances are nuanced; the plot is dead on believable, surprising, and beautifully crafted.

TGs mystery is not just what happened but also what might yet unfold. What will eventually befall our characters is clearly as complex as the characters we have followed in the movie.

The wife, Robyn played by Rebecca Hall, is personally flawed, glimpses her husbands true nature and urges him to make amends.  She seems like Nora from Doll's House, a woman who gains a troubling understanding of her husband and takes on  uncertainty for herself.

The husband, Simon  played by Bateman, seems to have both concealed his true nature and to have carried that flaw of a high school teen into his adult world and his profession. Bateman reveals his flaw in a set of dramatic beats that keep unfolding in a near seamless manner.

Gordon, as played by Joel Edgerton, who also wrote and directed the film, begins appearing a bit awkward, then certainly needy, but later is revealed as damaged and perhaps terrifying as Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction or Jessica Walter in Play Misty for Me.  He embodies an archetypal figure of the one wronged. We most often expect this role to be played by a woman (for every dozen Medeas there is one Philoctetes).

Edgerton's decision on gender changes the dynamics of TG.  Yes we feel the threat, we do not know how far Gordon might go, so we experience a thrill but we also experience a thoughtful psychological drama.

The result is a movie where the tension born of action never flags and where insight into the characters just goes deeper and deeper.",1444176000,3,2332,4.744416873449132
7363201,1,B013C6OW1Q,"Went to see this in the theater...both me and my husband regret it.
The movie moves slow to try to build tension, and in some scenes it's successful, but only to be let down with a cheap jump scare.
This movie was so predictable that me and my husband made a game out of it, we would whisper to each other exactly what was happening in a scene, only to be vindicated in the climax scene(s).

The stupid monkey mask was just thrown in as a cheap gimmick for ""scare"" factor, never elaborating WHY the main character was scared of monkeys, just that he was.

This movie is a revenge story with very bad dialogue,  ""gordo the weirdo"" and ""you thought you were done with the past, but the past is not done with you"" are some of the lines they actually try to pass off as being clever.",1444089600,6,779,4.214765100671141

This is fatal attraction thriller that dwells on the attraction for the male, as the less than successful guy friend from the past resurfaces to obsess over his accomplished partner from the past, and to share a secret that threatens to cast a gloom on the future.
Although this is not a horror film, there are a few jolts along the way. The best part of the movie is that relies on events from the past, and actions that can change the course of the future.

7363203,4,B013C6OW1Q,"I was incredibly surprised by this movie. I have a newfound respect for Joel Edgerton (writer, director, 2nd male lead)

Jason Bateman movies tend to be hit or misses and he is often cast as the same type of character as of late. However, I think he was expertly casted in this role. He is definitely one of those love-to-hate characters and the role plays to his strengths.

If you've seen the trailer and are thinking it is a basic thriller with no substance, I would like to point out the trailer is a bit misleading in the way it presents some of the events. There are definitely enough twists and subplots to get you through the end.

My only gripe would be the up-in-the-air ending, which I still enjoyed because of its ambiguity. I've discussed it with plenty of people and it falls in line with that of INCEPTION, but still presents a fantastic message. Others have found the pacing to be a little slow and off-putting, but I was completely plugged in by my curiosity as to where the story was going. I sat back and enjoyed the ride.

7363204,4,B013C6OW1Q,"""The Gift"" (2015 release; 108 min.) brings the story of a thirty-something married couple Simon and Robyn (played by Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall). As the movie opens, we see them then looking at a beautiful house in Hollywood Hills. They decide to buy it and movie in. The very next day at the store, Simon runs into Gordon, or more accurately Gordon comes up to Simon but Simon doesn't recognize him. Gordon refreshes Simon's memory that they went to high school together. The next day Gordon leaves a welcome gift (bottle of wine) at their door. The day after that, Gordon shows up at the house while Simon is at work. At this point we are maybe 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the Joel Edgerton show all the way: not only does he make a very impressive directing debut here, but he also also wrote the script and stars as Gordon a/k/a/ Gordo the Weirdo. Second, if you are simply expecting a 'scary' movie, yes there is some of that but let's be clear: this is not a 'slash and gore' movie by any means. It is far more like a psychological drama, examining the long legacy of something that may or may not have happened a long time ago, and how that taxes the marriage of Simon and Robyn. During dinner early on in the movie, Gordon comments to Simon that ""bad things, they can be a gift"", and this movie certainly turns them into a gift for us, the viewers. We are a good hour into the movie when the Big Reveal comes, and you had better strap on a seat belt for the wild ride that is the last 45 min. The acting performances are solid throughout, even with Rebecca Hall looking at her most 'mousey-est' as the tormented house wife. Last, UK indie band Temples' excellent single ""Keep In The Dark"" plays over the movie's closing titles.

Bottom line: were it not for a recommendation from a friend whose movie judgment I respect, I doubt that I would have gone to see this. So glad I did! The matinee screening where I saw this at recently was attended okay but not great. Then again, this has been in the theaters for well over a month now. Given its minuscule production budget, ""The Gift"" can be considered a modest but most unexpected summer hit. ""The Gift"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1441929600,4,2335,4.4153132250580045

7363206,4,B013C6OW1Q,"Jason Bateman is best known for playing one type of role, that of the douchebag. Sure, more often than not he's kind of a lovable douchebag, and he's honed that kind of character to a fine point. Even in a harmless movie like This is Where I Leave You where his character is pretty nice, he's still totally punchable. But what if everybody around him didn't ""love"" that guy Bateman so often plays; what if that guy's smarmy attitude and cutting insults really hurt people? That's what Joel Edgerton is looking to explore in his gripping and utterly fascinating thriller, The Gift.

Edgerton's film is a suspenseful masterpiece, and the amazing thing is how it evolves subtly throughout. What begins in the shape of a home invasion piece sheds its skin to become something much greater; a creepy and unforgettable examination of class, marital pressure, and how the past forever impacts one's future. The film stakes its territory out from the beginning as well-off married couple Simon (Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) peruse the swanky new home they're about to purchase. Quite literally living in a glass house separated from the rabble beneath them, they appear to be a happy, but maybe not perfectly so. He's a bit smug and demanding, she's non-confrontational perhaps because of something in her past. He's a great talker, able to use words to disarming effect. It's served him well throughout his career and helped land a great job in L.A. All is well, until they encounter the ""socially awkward"" Gordo (Edgerton) during a routine shopping trip. Gordo and Simon knew one another in school, and they exchange the kind of clumsy pleasantries old acquaintances often do. When Simon casually invites Gordo to call him some time, he opens a door that he'll wish had never been cracked to begin with. Gordo quickly takes advantage of the offer, showing up at the house frequently, often when Robyn is home alone. He turns up at gatherings he wasn't invited to; he invites them to his house for dinner under false pretenses. But strangest of all are the numerous gifts he leaves on their doorstep; perfectly wrapped and always with a meaningful message attached. They seem harmless, and Gordo isn't really doing anything. Robyn doesn't mind it but Simon takes offense and demands he leave them alone.

Without giving too much away from such a taut, rewarding potboiler, Edgerton skillfully re-positions the motivations of everyone we thought we knew. There are dark secrets to be revealed and past wrongs demanding to be set right, but who is the one in need of justice? Edgerton constantly moves the ground beneath our feet, keeping us off-balance. As strange things begin occurring around the home, a revelation from Robyn's past throws everything she's experiencing into question. Gordo, while not overtly threatening, is just creepy enough to merit concern he's some kind of undercover serial killer. And Simon, who can seem like the perfect husband one minute, can be a callous jerk the next.  While there are the makings of a typical ""stalker"" movie, Edgerton doesn't settle for common tropes of the genre, instead digging deeper into what makes these characters tick. Through skillful use of lighting and ambient noise he creates enough tension that audiences may literally jump out of their seats with shock. It certainly happened at the screening I attended during one memorable scene. The screenplay is trimmed down and sharp until the unnecessarily heavy-handed finale that tries so hard for a big ""twist"" that everything gets telegraphed from a mile away.

It's strange to see Edgerton, who looked like an all-pro linebacker in The Great Gatsby and Warrior, curl himself up into the cowering Gordo. He moves and stutters with believable timidity, giving an accomplished performance that matches his confident direction. Bateman knows this character all too well; he fits into it easily and takes to its darker contours like a pro. Hall is typically sensitive and reserved in her portrayal, but it fits with Robyn's passive nature. Edgerton is most deserving of recognition, though. His debut feature shows a ton of promise. The real gift of The Gift is how it tingles our spines and plays with our expectations. While Edgerton clearly owes a lot to the works of Alfred Hitchcock and Michael Haneke, he's not content to merely pay homage to them, but to live up to their high standard.",1441584000,31,4397,4.978231292517007
