Powerful, education, spiritual, awesome are just a few words to describe the information contained in this two DVD set.  I read the book, but I wanted a DVD to add to my TDJ collection and after searching the internet, I could only find the DVD at Amazon.  A must have if you work in a stressful or non-stressful job.
