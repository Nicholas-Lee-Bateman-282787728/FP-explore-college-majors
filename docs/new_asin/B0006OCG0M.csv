8042019,5,B0006OCG0M,All I have to say is everybody should be ordering this and watching it and sharing it with friends and family.  This way hopefully more people begin to wake up and see what Sharia law is about & more.  This is a very real documentary that shows the truth!,1376524800,,255,4.183673469387755
8042020,4,B0006OCG0M,"This was an awesome eyewitness account of the mass graves in Iraq. I could not help but be moved by this DVD. Saddam's use of chemical weapons against the Iranians and against the Kurds is the treacherous thing I have ever witnessed in this kind of format. This documentary belongs on PBS; every American should watch it. It really does invoke emotions that require the viewer to seek justice. When America went to topple the Saddam rgime in 2003 this is exactly what they did. Kurdistan has an opportunity for their own democratic processes, which we were in support of in the first Gulf War. Furth more, our return although late, was another example of America telling the truth and keeping its promises. They needed our help and the mass graves in Iraq are a horrible testimony to the villainous nature of Saddam Hussein's Iraq.

Citizens of the Middle East should thank the United States and its allies for what they did in Iraq. His tyranny is no more and while they American press tries to present the minutest tactical setback as a major battle being lost the fact is, Saddam lost the war and we won. The ba'athists left in Iraq cannot even wage an effective campaign against the Americans. They have lost too and it is evidenced by the fact that they only can take small pot shots here and there against our troops and the newly formed Iraqi government.

The war on terror is being won and this video further provides mountains of evidence of many people who suffered under Saddam. The Iraqi's have a saying that Saddam Hussein was the biggest WMD. This movie proves that point.",1152057600,5,1586,4.640569395017794
8042021,3,B0006OCG0M,"This documentary has three major interrelated episodes.  First, there is the section that deals with the horrifying actions of the Iraqi Ba'athist regime.  The second section deals with 9-11 and the development of the Bush doctrine.  The final section deals with the consequences of the war in Iraq by highlighting one solders death and listing some of the gains in Iraq.

The most significant part of this video is the section that deals with the cruelty and abuse of Saddam Hussein's regime against its own people.  It is impossible for anyone to watch this documentary and retain the misguided opinion that the war in Iraq was unjustified, illegal, or immoral.  It is a fundamental American, in my opinion human, value that governments derive their sovereignty from the consent of their people.  When governments use power to oppress the people, they lose all basis for sovereignty.

The section of the video dealing with 9-11 will be described by some as simple emotional manipulation.  If so, it is highly effective emotional manipulation.  Watching those scenes again brought back all of the emotions that I felt when that attack occurred.  However, believe this section was included to show the development of the Bush Doctrine and how that led to the invasion of Iraq.

Critics of this documentary will also say that the section highlighting the loss of one solder is cheap emotionalism.  However, think that it is relevant to the topic at hand.  Additionally, it shows that the American people are willing to make sacrifices for causes that are just and right.

The list of accomplishments in Iraq is significant and reflects that individuals with freedom - even in the midst of a brutal war - are far more productive and creative than those who live under repressive regimes.  More importantly, it shows that even with the ongoing security issues, most Iraqis are living a better life now and have hope for a better life in the years to come.

The most amusing part of the documentary is the start with the ""ambush"" interview of Michael Moore in which he admits that his documentaries are mostly opinion.  To paraphrase, they are ""...like opeds..."" that reflect what he thinks.  The closer of the interview is when Mr Moore tells his interlocutor to make his own documentary since democracy is best served when there are more voices competing in the market place of ideas.

My only critique of this documentary is that it tries to do too much.  The three major themes do not necessarily tie together well.  This would be much stronger if it were broken into three separate documentaries of 30 to 45 minutes each vice 90 minutes with a little bit of everything mixed in.",1142208000,5,2679,4.867549668874172
8042022,5,B0006OCG0M,"This video opened my eyes wider than they were before. Where was the Human Rights Coalition, and the U.N. during this murderous, brutal regime? This is a can't-watch, but must-watch video, and will give you every bit of information you need to k now about why Saddam had to be taken out.

Interesting to note, the ambush interview of Michael Moore at the beginning of the DVD, apparently was prior to the release of Fahrenheit 911... Moore says ""well, yeah.. this is my opinion.. everything I do is very subjective.. not objective at all...it's just my opinion."" Hmmm.. if that's the case, why did he afterwards claim his film as a ""documentary?""

One of the greatest TRUE documentaries I've ever seen.",1135987200,8,702,4.793388429752066
