Then we get introduced to Olympic ice skater, Dian Wilson (Barbara Wilson) who occupies a lot of screen time going around in circles.

By now you have heard many times that a meteorite skidded in for a landing and what it implies.

There are lots of stay in the car scenes O.K. tractors and planes. but she still does not stay in. Hold on it is not time to kibitz yet.

They borrow the sound effects from War of the Worlds.

It is a furry interesting creature. Erik is about to be creature-chow.
Will Dian meet Leni Riefenstahl?
Even worse Bengt Ekerot (death) from The Seventh Seal (1957)?

Oh no the villagers must have watched old Frankenstein movies a dozen times  they are coming with torches to do the dead. Will there be Steak Dian in the process?

The night is long and lonely
When there is only one
There should be two in love to view

8059964,5,B0009F4Z02,1950s horror films always borrowed plot lines and concepts from each other and this one is  no exception. It draws heavily from the original The Thing. The plot starts out the same with a meteor wreckage turning out to be a space ship. What elevates it is that once the scientists arrive at the scene they see things that are far weirder and scarier than The Thing. This is a chilling film that you don't want to watch alone after dark. Good production values for the era as well.,1148256000,8,480,4.393258426966292
8059965,5,B0009F4Z02,"""'Terror in the Midnight Sun' is a genuinely creepy movie and far head of its time. I found the plot and action extremely engrossing, and the leading pair (Barbara Wilson and Stan Gester) are accomplished and charming. This classic movie from A2ZCDS is a must-see for science fiction buffs in search of their roots.""",1146528000,7,316,4.87037037037037
