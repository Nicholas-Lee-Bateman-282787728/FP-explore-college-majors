The images are too horrific and the explanations too fast for instruction, I believe.  The DVD did teach me a lot, which I can use to inform my planning, but I will not show this to my students.",1454112000,,352,4.072463768115942

8300470,4,B001F114R6,"For a research project, The Armenian Genocide, I watched the entire series.  Which, truly helped my understanding of the causes of Man's inhumanity towards man.",1432944000,,160,5.4
8300471,3,B001F114R6,The series makes up a very sad tale on how low the human can go in pursuit of power/revenge. How people throughout history have sunk to such levels of depravity is almost impossible to get your head around. Even more disquieting is the fact that every country/religion/leadership has been guilty of genocide. Sad.,1396656000,,313,4.9245283018867925
8300472,4,B001F114R6,"This presentation of genocide is well narrated and informative. The evidence presented is simplified and reasonably accurate. Original footage is well organized with validated documentation. How to classify genocide as opposed to mass killings or political/military actions is addressed. This series is intended to be educational, not sensational. There needs to be a way for individuals and the international community to recognize the symptoms before the killing become so ruthless that they cannot be contained. It has been said that 'absolute power corrupts absolutely' and these incidents, by what ever name, are an example of power. Political power that intends to defeat all opposition by whatever means possible. Easy enough to blame a given people and create an environment that encourages violence. When ideas are passed on through generations it isn't difficult to create that spark that becomes an all consuming conflagration. Individuals see each other in a way that says, 'kill or be killed.'  The intent of the definition of genocide by the UN has been almost forgotten. There is no system of diagnosis or  enforcement in place. If that power isn't condemned then history will continue to be repeated. Indonesia, several countries in Africa, Afghanistan, and the Middle East continue without any resolution. Never again?
Would you choose to be a bystander?

Education offers an answer but can this lesson be learned? There is no definitive answer. This series is definitely recommended!

8300474,4,B001F114R6,"There has been much written since the Holocaust but little about the fact that terror remains.  This film tells stories from china, vietnam and other informing us that we need to pay more attention to what is going on in our world.  I can't say I enjoyed this film but it is a real eye opener.",1363824000,,293,4.214285714285714
