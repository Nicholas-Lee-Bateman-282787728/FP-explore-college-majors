7820276,2,6302048761,"The title is a bit of false advertising here...there is only one match featuring Andre.  This is a 30-minute tape of Mid-South Wrestling matches from 1982, all from the TV show by the look of it.

There is some blowdried loudmouth who announces the match from an editing booth, then mercifully speaks only one more time.  The matches are just butted together one after the other, and most have only interest for hardcore and old-school fans.

The Andre match is somewhat interesting, he's teamed with Dusty Rhodes and Junkyard Dog against Ernie Ladd and the Samoans.  The match doesn't last too long and has a predictable ending.  Not bad, but predictable.

The other matches:

Bob Orton Jr. defending the Mississippi State Championship against Jim Garvin--Before the Cowboy and the Gorgeous one.  These two have a quick match with a few good wrestling moves.  Orton wins, but you know it's for TV, so there has to be a quick finish.

Paul Orndorff vs. Tony Charles--This would have been a really good match if they'd let them go for more than the five minutes they had.  Orndorff shows he can wrestle a bit, and Charles was a great mat man.  Orndoff wins, pretty obvious.

Iron Sheik vs. King Cobra--Squash match.  Not much to it.

These previous matches also have Bob Roop running his mouth about how much he hates Ted DiBiase and while he has some worthwhile examinations of each match, he's boring.

Mr. Olympia vs. Zapata--Squash match, with Bill Watts rambling on about what I don't know.  He barely pays attention to the match.

If there's anything I missed, well, it was worth missing.",1127779200,4,1593,4.769230769230769
