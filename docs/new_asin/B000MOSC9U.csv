8170429,1,B000MOSC9U,Too bad they don't have negative star ratings.  This came with two of the discs that were supposed to be in the set.  The other two disks were China Beach seasons 2 and 3.  Somehow I don't think those will be appropriate for my Sunday School lesson.,1504137600,,249,4.25531914893617

8170431,3,B000MOSC9U,"I guess I didn't read the description well enough, but many of the movies on this DVD were made in the seventies and before.  The resolution is terrible and I had seen them as a kid.  There are a few more modern clips, but most of them are very old.",1400630400,,249,3.96
8170432,5,B000MOSC9U,Excellent set of videos on Mormon Church History. Well worth the cost. Is also hard to find since the Church no longer produces this set any longer.,1382745600,,148,4.518518518518518

8170434,5,B000MOSC9U,Fast shipping.  Wonderful DVD.  We used this when we went on a Church history tour.  It was a great prelude for the kids prior to seeing those sites.,1372809600,,149,4.25
8170435,5,B000MOSC9U,"It doesn't matter, what religion you are the video gives you the faith
in God in the stories that are presented. Each story is how the people
got through their ups and downs in life. They show how people would help
each other in a time of need. Yes, there were disagreements as are in so
many friends and families, but they would talk it through. I'm not a Morman,
but I have enjoyed theres videos.",1370304000,2,398,4.25
