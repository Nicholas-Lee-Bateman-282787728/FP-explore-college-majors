8323632,5,B0017I31W8,This documentary tells of the rise and fall of Mobutu. It is ironic and sad. His name will always be connected to betrayal of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba. Who knows what the economic and social conditions would be like in that country if Mobutu had worked for the best interests of the country and not himself!,1387152000,2,313,4.607142857142857
