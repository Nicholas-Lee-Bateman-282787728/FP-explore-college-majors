All I can say is SPECTACULAR,  Derek and the whole cast are stellar in their performances.  God I love British television, and this show really hits your emotions. So keep a tissue nearby as you laugh and cry your way through 24 minutes.",1401840000,2,326,4.491525423728813
5708947,5,B00CA59OJ6,"Always been a fan of Ricky Gervais - and lucky enough to have met him in person while waiting for a flight to NY from Vancouver (he was ever so nice and accommodating) This series showcases his many talents and is full of wonderful moments of comedy and tugs at your heart. I work at a retirement home and find this show accurate in it's portrayal of the life of seniors who are often forgotten by society and their own family.  All I can say is that the supporting cast is also brilliant and I can't believe the seniors are actors-they are incredible!
Thank you Mr. Gervais for putting together an excellent series!",1398988800,,616,4.451327433628318
5708948,5,B00CA59OJ6,"From the mind of Ricky Gervais, DEREK is a show about a mentally challenged man named Derek who works at elderly home center. Derek is a little quirky, but extremely lovable and goes out of his way to befriend the residents of the place he works and make them feel comfortable. The show is filmed in a mockumentary style.

When I watched the first episode of DEREK, I wasn't sure what to think. Gervais shows are known for making fun of his characters and placing them in the most awkward positions possible. In the first episode of DEREK, there are some moments that appear that way. However, as I continued watching the series it became clear that DEREK isn't about making fun of people who work in nursing homes or with the elderly. Instead, its simply showing the struggles that those people deal with in their lives. There are comical bits, but the comedy is based in a more real blue collar existence than some of Gervais other shows, e.g. THE OFFICE or EXTRAS. Theres a huge amount of heart and respect in DEREK and despite the humorous bits, the character Derek is never the punch line or butt of any jokes. Season 1 of the show has seven episodes. They are as follows.

Episode 1  Pilot  this episode introduces us to the workers at Broadhill Retirement Home. These include Derek, Hannah (she runs the facility), and Dereks friends Dougie (Broadhills maintenance worker) and Kev. The episode ends on a bittersweetly.

Episode 2  A council official visits Broadhill. Cuts have to be made to the staff an changes made otherwise the facility will lose its public funding.

Episode 3  A young girl named Vicky is sent to Broadhill to do community service. At first she hates working there, but over time begins to like her work and sees Broadhill as the family she never had. Also, Derek celebrates his 50th Birthday.

Episode 4  Dougie arranges for a rumble sale to be held to raise money for Broadhill. One of the long term residents daughter comes to visit and which causes issues.

Episode 5  the residents go on a day trip at the beach while Hannah stays behind to greet a new resident, Gill. Gill is accompanied by her daughter Rebecca who attended school with Hannah.

Episode 6  a young rap artist is sent to work at Broadhill for community service. Broadhill holds a talent night where Kev debuts his play about Duran Duran.

Episode 7  another long term resident dies and it affect Derek greatly. Also, Dereks dad attempts to make contact with him. The last 10 minutes of this episode are some of the best tv I have ever watched (second, in my opinion only to the finale of EXTRAS).

Overall, I really enjoyed watching DEREK and cant wait to see Season 2 when it becomes available. Fans of Gervais previous shows might be surprised by Derek because its a bit different from what hes done before. Also, DEREK is a show that people who have never seen a Ricky Gervais show might actually enjoy and not be offended by.",1396396800,6,2930,4.593090211132438
5708949,5,B00CA59OJ6,"I really can't believe the tenderness and warmth of this series.  I always respected Ricky Gervais' talent, but this is amazing.  I was moved to tears, joyful tears.  I hope others will enjoy this unique television series.",1396224000,,222,4.945945945945946
5708950,5,B00CA59OJ6,"I do not have much to add to the other reviews. I just want to add another 5 star rating, because people need to watch this show. I recommended this show to my friends on Facebook [which a)I never log on to anymore, and b) I have never recommended a show to Facebook friends/family before]. I had to add the caveat that this show may not be suitable for children. While the overall message, what the show is about, is definitely something children should see, the show contains some adult humor and adult language that is likely not appropriate for younger viewers. This is a truly beautiful show, and much like the other reviews say, it had me laughing, and it also made me a little teary eyed. Even though it is only 7(I think)episodes, you become very attached to these characters.

I was already a fan of Ricky Gervais and Karl Pilkington. Ricky Gervais is absolutely amazing in this show. If you know Karl Pilkington from the podcasts, or An Idiot Abroad, you will probably laugh every time you see him. He, for the most part, is playing a caricature of himself.

Netflix offers a free trial, and it is worth signing up for the trial just to see this show. I will be purchasing this when it becomes available in the US on DVD or blu-ray.

That was more than I intended to write, but I really feel this show deserves to be seen by as many people as possible.",1389657600,5,1362,4.396825396825397
5708951,5,B00CA59OJ6,"I watch a lot of TV. I really do. Derek isn't like other shows. Other shows master in drama or comedy and often attempt to mix the two, but none do it to the level of perfection that Derek does. Derek is hilarious, but it's also heart wrenching and heartbreaking. It's the perfect mix of comedy and drama. There is no other show like it, and everyone should give this show a try.",1387152000,7,379,4.205479452054795
5708952,5,B00CA59OJ6,"I watched this entire season in one evening on Netflix. Absolutely beautiful!!

At times I laughed out loud, and at other times I broke down in sobs. As someone who had to see my great-grandmother go from a strong, independent woman to a feeble, aging woman who came to live with my family, and then see her at the hospital after she had a bad fall from which she never recovered properly, to her passing at age 96, this show brought back a lot of thoughts and emotions from that period of my life. I think this show is incredibly relevant to the difficult decisions people have to make today about aging loved ones, and I pray to God that I can find a facility with as much character as Broadhill when I have to make those difficult life decisions. And since more and more of the population is aging, it will be so applicable to so many. Gervais has hit on gold.

It does take a few moments to get used to the heavier accents if you don't watch a lot of British media (my spouse pointed this out). And there are some moments that seem a bit slower, but often it is to give you a moment's reprise to recover from the amazing moments that bring out so much emotion. Derek (as played by Gervais) is a super sweet character that sees all things good, except for when one of his friends passes. And then his narrations are just so breathtakingly beautiful and sincere.

The other characters are great as well, from the random quotes from the residents of Broadhill to the homeless man that management allows to come around to the juvenile delinquents assigned to the Home for community service and learn to respect their elders... Really. Just watch it. It is amazing. As soon as this is a DVD, I plan on ordering it from Amazon-- until then, I'll just keep watching it on Netflix.",1386115200,15,1777,4.395136778115502
5708953,5,B00CA59OJ6,"This show is a marvel.  Ricky Gervais is Derek, an eccentric and often misunderstood caregiver at Broad Hill nursing home.  With help from Hannah (Kerry Godliman) and Dougie (Karl Pilkington) and even Kev (David Earl), he administers affection and understanding at a place where most people simply go to die, many times abandoned by their own families.  And that's the marvel of this show ... that a place where many spend just the last remaining moments of their lives could prove comic gold for all the actors and characters involved.  Each episode is simply about a few things going on at Broad Hill and how the workers deal with those things, often dealing with them in he context of their own lives.  And with each episode, you won't only have the best laugh you've had in years.  You'll also have the best cry.  It's amazing how in the space of 24 minutes you can find yourself wiping away tears of both laughter and sadness.  And it's all because Ricky Gervais does an incredible job with a show that he has written, starred in and directed.  And the rest of the cast have to be given their propers as well ... characters that, in less able hands, could simply be two-dimensional, turn into people you care about and root for and laugh with and cry for.  All in 7 episodes.  By the time this series ends, you'll feel like 'you've been through it.'  And it's all very good.  This show is a marvel.  If you want life, death and everything in between, get this.  Highly recommended.",1384905600,30,1486,4.554716981132075

5708957,5,B00CA59OJ6,"11/24/14 UPDATE: I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS BLU RAY. WHEN I FIRST SAW IT, IT WAS CODED FOR THE USA. THEY SENT ME ANOTHER ONE AND I JUST NOTICED THEY HAVE CHANGED THE CODE ON ONE AREA ON HERE FOR NO USA, BUT IN THE OTHER AREA ON HERE IT STILL SHOWS FOR REGIONS A/B/C! IT ALSO SAYS ON THE BLU RAY THAT IT IS REGION FREE! THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. THE LABELING NEEDS TO BE CHANGED LIKE THE REGULAR DVD THAT THIS IS NOT CODED FOR USA!

OMG!! I have been waiting for this to come out since watching it on Netflix. I have watched both seasons on there a few times and watching it again with a friend. Last night we laughed and cried. This show has it all, laughs, love, death, family. It's one of the best shows I have ever seen. I am praying they keep making more seasons. I'm so glad the first season is available for US now.

5708963,5,B00CA59OJ6,"Heartwarming, funny, crude... All words to describe this show. Derek is set in an old person's home with Derek being a ""Helper"". Does he belong there or does he work there? You decide. These shows are great in that one minute you will be staring at the screen with your mouth open because you can't believe what they say, and the next minute you will be wiping tears from your eyes. His portrayal is so spot in that you forget you are watching ""David Brent"" and you begin to empathize with his character. A+ I hope they make years and years of this and don't stop it after 2 seasons and a special like they usually do. GO DEREK!!!!",1402185600,,631,4.310924369747899
