4432180,3,B004MOY97U,"This is a totally 'modernized' telling of the Ben-Hur story.

a. It is not, in any appreciable way, ""A Tale of the Christ"".
b. It is not spectacular in any sense, as was the 1959 version in so many ways.
c. Its production values are consistent with those of other contemporary television entertainment - technically excellent, but lacking in many of the artistic elements that make for anything more than mediocre storytelling.

Those who love the story of Ben-Hur as told in the William Wyler / Charlton Heston version of 1959, as I do, will probably be left cold, as I was. Viewers not having that standard of comparison will likely find it ok.",1367280000,16,646,4.657894736842105
4432181,4,B004MOY97U,"This TV mini-series version of Ben Hur was a good rendition based on the novel by Lew Wallace.  It stars The Vampire Diaries' Joseph Morgan as the title character Judah Ben Hur.  His performance was more acceptable than the more well known Hollywood epic version with Charlton Heston in that role.  What it lacked in big budget and overall production value it made up for in character development because since it was in a mini-series format it had more time to bring in a bit more detail than any of the previous big screen versions and was better able to fill in some of the blanks left missing, particularly in the Heston film.  Overall it was a valiant effort to bring the story afresh and consider it worth a viewing.",1363392000,13,722,4.530769230769231
4432182,5,B004MOY97U,You quit watching to soon.  The movie is strictly about Judah Ben Hur life. Christ is only in the movie twice. However he influenced Judah's life by his words to him.  This movie does not have a lot of special effects. It relies solely on the actors shoulders.  The movie starts with Judah as a boy and ends with him becoming a man. This is a story of revenge and forgiveness.  The acting was just incredible. I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did.,1363392000,9,454,4.183908045977011
4432183,2,B004MOY97U,Did not think i would like the movie but became interested in the characters and the updated view of Roman culture.  I quit watching when Esther's father was taken down from the cross while still alive because of Passover.  I found that impossible to believe and saw it as a snub toward Christian Theology by its inference that Jesus was also taken down while still alive.  Lew Wallace probably rolled in his grave.,1363305600,11,415,4.657534246575342

4432195,5,B004MOY97U,"Beware that many reviews here refer to a recent, senseless remake. The 1959 classic (as depicted above) is one of the very greatest movies ever made, albeit perhaps a bit too rich in characterizations for modern short attention spans. Taking about four years to bring to the very wide screen (2:76), it was made without computer assistance in an era of epic film-making and ""Roadshow"" presentation long gone. It grossed $67 million worldwide at a time when five or six million was considered good and saved the failing M-G-M studio for a number of years. It's a perfect illustration of good story-telling where we follow an interesting character's journey through events that profoundly change his or her life. The backdrop is the time of Jesus, but the story is more about personal conflicts than religious ones. The movie is described elsewhere, so I'm adding details about the contents of the marvelous, deluxe Blu-ray 3-disc box set:
-A meticulous restoration of the Oscar-winning 1959 film, with 5.1 stereo sound (222 minutes);
-The 1925 silent version starring Ramon Navarro, also restored, with stereo score by Carl Davis (142 mins. b/w with color sequences)  this earlier landmark troubled production helped establish the M-G-M studios;
-A 1994 and a 2005 ""Making of..."" interesting documentaries;
-""Charlton Heston & Ben-Hur: A Personal Journey"" documentary, including home movies;
-Audio commentary with Heston and historian T. Gene Hatcher;
-Isolated music-only track of Miklos Rozsa's great score;
-64-page hard-cover photo book, plus a book of Heston's journal;
-Trailers, Screen Tests, Newsreels, excerpts of the 1960 Academy-Awards telecast, Photo Gallery.

M-G-M had a huge success in 1951 with the Roman epic QUO VADIS (also on a beautiful Blu-ray). Followed by the 20th Century Fox  introduction of widescreen Cinemascope in 1953 via THE ROBE, ponderous Biblical (and Ancient World) spectaculars became a trend that lasted into the 1960s, with the disastrous THE BIBLE (1966) putting one of the final nails on that cross. The terrific JESUS CHRIST, SUPERSTAR rock opera grew out of that era.",1491523200,2,2109,5.308383233532934

4432238,2,B004MOY97U,"Why adapt a book that is Christ-centered ( the title of the book is BEN-HUR : A TALE OF THE CHRIST) and secularize it?  If you ever read the book, which starts with the 3 Wise Men and ends with Judah Ben-Hur heading off to Rome to give aid to the persecuted Christians, you know that the whole epic tale (nearly 700 pages long) tells how the numerous characters are affected and motivated by the birth, ministry and crucifixion of JESUS CHRIST.  With this lackluster miniseries, the direction the story is taking comes off as unclear.
Major characters are replaced or omitted altogether. The 2 major set pieces of the 1920's and 1959 film versions - the Sea Battle and, of course, the Chariot Race , are underwhelming (and in the case of the chariot race - really tiresome and hard to follow ) in this lame production. The actor playing Massala is all wrong for the part. Ben-Hur, who is supposed to be a good Jewish boy and respectful of his people, faith and traditions is sleeping around with the whore that belongs to Massala's father, a Roman senator. Ben-Hur's mother and sister are supposed to be stricken with leprosy, but they don't look so bad that a little Clearasil couldn't make as good as new. And as for the actor playing Jesus - he comes off like a college student protestor. Even his walk along the  via Delarosa is nothing special.  I can't understand why they even bothered to make this-putting aside the original story, this miniseries doesn't even succeed as a good historical saga of Rome.",1439337600,9,1511,4.605947955390334

4432251,3,B004MOY97U,"I've seen all three versions of BEN HUR now.  The 1925 version is by far the liveliest of the three (as well as being the shortest, which is always a plus with me).  The 1959 remake, starring the ever-wooden Charlton Heston, is bloated, pretentious and slow by comparison.  This miniseries version is somewhere between the two.  On the plus side, it has the most fully-realized script of the three.  The characters are fleshed out much more satisfyingly, their relationships are better defined and their motivations more sharply in focus.

But that's strictly the screenplay; the acting and direction are something else again.  Joseph Morgan, in the title role, is a bit too much of a brooding male model (and a blond, blue-eyed male model, at that) to be convincing as a 1st-century Jewish prince.  He does pout nicely, though, and his very brief nude scene is pleasant to see.  The best that can be said is that he's more expressive than Heston, but then what actor isn't?  Stephen Campbell Moore has given some good performances in the ""callow young man"" vein; as the villainous Messala in this series, he's a lot less than satisfying.  Only James Faulkner, as Moore's villainous father, makes much of an impression.

As for Steve Shill's direction...meh.  It's workmanlike, nothing special one way or the other.  He certainly hasn't done much to coax good performances out of his cast.  And his direction of the chariot race, which should be the dramatic high point, is notably poor; it consists of lots of seemingly random quick cuts, with no sense of the characters' interactions or even relative positions, and no sense of the flow of the action.  Compared with both of the earlier versions of the race (directed by action specialists B. Reeves Eason and Yakima Cabutt, respectively) it is downright pathetic.  The TV budget is everywhere apparent, but that, at least, isn't Shill's fault.

In sum, this is a lot easier to enjoy that the Heston version, not as much fun as the '25 silent version, worth a few bucks if you enjoy this kind of thing.  But I'd strongly advise that no one should spend too much for it.",1417132800,,2121,4.793388429752066

4432261,3,B004MOY97U,"To start out, I have seen this miniseries, and I have read some of the reviews.  A lot of people are comparing this miniseries to the Charlton Heston 1956 version.  I have seen both the 1956 version and the silent Ben Hur (in fact I own both on DVD), and one cannot compare this to either of those movies on any level, and in my opinion, for obvious reasons.  Not to be tedious and repetitive of other reviewers, I still feel the need to clarify some things, in the defense of this miniseries.  First, it is not ""A Tale of the Christ"", as is lauded in the 1956 version. Quite frankly, the 1956 version is not ""a tale of the Christ"" either.  It is a tale about the relationship of two boys of different ethnicities, who grow apart as they become adults because of the life paths that they have taken, and because of their times and social situations. Jesus Christ is kind of a sub plot if you will.  Basically, Judah and Messalla's story is set in the first century during the time and happenings of Jesus Christ.  That's it. Neither has anything to do with Jesus Christ necessarily, other than how Judah and Jesus' paths happen to cross.  Therefore, telling the public not to watch this for Easter, or for the holiday's is kind of silly, since neither movie is really a ""holiday"" movie. The networks run these films during the holiday's for ratings and such.

Second, this Ben Hur is a miniseries and it is clear that it was made on a small budget, therefore comparing it to a Hollywood epic block buster is unfair. The 1956 movie won a record 11 Academy Awards and is one of the best movies ever made in Hollywood. But also, in fairness to this miniseries, these young actors did the best they could with the experience that they have.  I don't think their acting is all that bad.  Again, one cannot compare these young actors to Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd. By the time of the 1956 Ben Hur, Heston and Boyd were veteran actors with a pantheon of experience and credit to their credentials.  They were part of the MGM studio system where they were groomed and nurtured and coached to be the very best. Hollywood is not like that today, in 2014. The studio system and the glory days of Hollywood are long gone, and so is some of the quality. These young actors need time to gain some experience, do more projects, and maybe in time they will develop into actors like Heston and Boyd. Liz Taylor didn't start out as an amazing actress. She was in some flops. However, she evolved into the legendary actress that she later became.

Third, I must have missed something but I didn't see a whole lot of sex and nudity as some of the reviewers claim there to be in this miniseries. If the scene's containing nudity that I saw where that offensive to some viewers, then all I can say is that those reviewers haven't seen much TV lately. This miniseries is nothing in the nudity or sex department compared to Starz's SPARTACUS series. All of them. Or HBO's ROME, or SHOWTIME'S THE TUDORS, or THE BORGIA'S. Not to impugn the opinion of other reviewers, but those miniseries that I just mentioned above has 10x's the nudity, sex, blood and gore that the 2010 Ben Hur has .... and the SPARTACUS series is thought by some, to be soft porn.  Therefore, I'd say that some reviewers are over reacting concerning the nudity in this miniseries, unless I totally missed those scenes all together.

I'll end by recalling what I liked about this miniseries.  I liked how it portrayed their youth and friendship.  This one tells you ""what happened"" in their youth that played a part in the tensions that were present when they reunited years later. The 1956 version does not set one up that way.  In the 1956 version, the prologue is the birth of Christ ( which I view as the authors way of setting up the time frame) and then the movie starts.  They are adults already when the film starts, and we as an audience must surmise what their friendship as children were like.",1400716800,,3955,4.475660639777469

It has scenes of pure pornography. It virtually side steps Judah Ben Hur's conversion and redemption. It also almost eliminates the healing of his mother and sister. Although it waters down the healing, the 1959 version gives a visual suggestion that the healing was by Jesus Christ. This new version only shows a bright light with no explanation. In the book, Jesus is riding into Jerusalem on a donkey. He sees Judah, Judah's mother, and sister. Jesus stops and lays His hand on the women thus healing them. The book is subtitled ""A Tale of the Christ."" It deals with a deeply wronged man who vows revenge, hears the gospel message taught by Jesus Christ, repents, and becomes a born again Christian. This movie's representation of Jesus Christ is totally distorted. Do not waste your money.",1392768000,4,942,4.820987654320987

The shoestring budget is clearly visible in the action scenes.

On Amazon, it looks like there are 3 different movies of Ben Hur. They are The Epic Miniseries Event (2010), Ben Hur (imports), and Ben Hur (starring Charlton Heston, 1959). However the first two are are the same film in different package. They both star Joseph Morgan. The strange thing is Amazon does not reveal this information. That makes some people wrongly believe they are 2 different pictures.",1392595200,,667,4.773913043478261

4432290,4,B004MOY97U,"I belong to FSM (Film Score Monthly), a soundtrack discussion group, and we had been discussing this 2-part remake of ""Ben-Hur,"" and I just posted the following there:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today I watched the 3 1/4 hour ""Ben-Hur,"" the 2010 remake with Joseph Morgan and Stephen Campbell Moore and Emily VanCamp, which I wrote about a month or so ago on another thread, probably about script adaptations, and this was the first time I had ever watched it WITHOUT commercials, and while I liked it back when I first saw it on cable, it has gained considerably in my estimation. I hadn't intended to watch it all, but couldn't turn it off. And it brought me to tears at least 3 times. I believe it was re-edited to lengthen some scenes over what was originally shown on American TV (it's, I believe, a Canadian/German/Moroccan co-production) and there's some slight male nudity as well as some above the waist female nudity that I don't remember seeing when it was broadcast in the U.S. I had picked it up (here) at Amazon for $1 plus shipping and it's one of the best deals I've found in quite some time. HIGHLY recommended.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree with some reviewers who bemoan the absence of a Blu-ray version of this, but the DVD is excellent, although I want to advise any who buy this to skip the lengthy flashbacks at the beginning of part 2, which is about as close to a quibble as I can get.

Ben-Hur is portrayed as a sort of Everyman and NOT as the burly superhero as played by Charlton Heston in the remake. And I'm a big fan of that version, having bought it on low fi VHS, then hi fi stereo VHS, then the first edition on DVD, then the special edition DVD, and finally the big and elaborate Blu-ray set. But, as I wrote above, I was quite taken with this version and feel that it stands on its own. And judging by the low prices one can get it here, a real bargain! As I wrote in my title, I couldn't believe how much I like this!",1388361600,14,2113,4.858333333333333

This 2010 miniseries didn't disappoint in the least. The story of Judah Ben-Hur is told with an edginess and sensuality one would expect in a modern version of a classic.  I found the actors talented and believable in their roles, most especially Joseph Morgan in the title role. I enjoyed this retelling of Ben Hur enough to purchase the DVD.",1378598400,2,528,4.557894736842106

Nothing against Heston, but he just didn't do it for me in the movie.  Overall, a good action flick that doesn't get bogged down in religiosity although the scenes featuring Jesus are there - after all, the original book was called something like ""A Tale Of The Christ.""  But, it is called ""Ben Hur"" not ""Ben Hur Meets Jesus"" so the emphasis should be on the title character.  If you're looking for a Charlton Heston clone, this isn't it - this is distinctly different, and because it's  a contemporary re-make, it's more realistic.  It all depends upon what you're looking for as to whether you'll like this version or not.",1375574400,3,792,4.654676258992806

4432314,5,B004MOY97U,"Unlike the Heston epic,  Christ makes just three cameo appearances. However, this is not a story of religious faith.  When present, religion is subordinated in the plot by the movie director to create an intriguing modern tale. This is not a for children-recommended epic, but it is a mature, detailed-filled, contemporary interpretation of the Lew Wallace classic.

At times taking great historical license, this is the story of the Hur family: Their suffering, survival, and triumph over Roman political oppression in 1st Century C.E. Jerusalem.  Deeper, this is also a tale of two individuals: one Jewish (Judah) and  one Roman (Messala) and their interpersonal bonding as children and their adult psycho-political conflicts. Ultimately, this is an story of power: The Conquerors (Rome personified in the Agrippas, Arias, Pilate, and Tiberias) and The Conquered (namely, the Hur Family, Greeks, Jews, slaves, and other residents of 1 Century C.E. Jerusalem). .

As adult-level drama, the principal actors (the Agrippas, Arias, and Hur) present a tale of an aristocratic member of the Jewish upper class, Judah ben Hur,  who painstakingly overcomes great obstacles (unjust imprisonment and slavery at the hands of Roman Military Tribune Messala Agrippa) and who in the end emerges victorious over his Roman oppressors (namely, the Agrippas, Pilate, Tiberias, and, by extension, Rome)..

In the end, ""truth"" seemingly does win out over ""evil"": The good does triumph over the bad. The oppressed win, at least for the moment, against the Tiberian imposed Pax Romana. As a bonus, the details of the Wallace book are more finely etched in our consciousness than those presented in the former movie version.

While not recommended for children because of several scenes of the sexual intercourse and of the graphic cruelty and violence, Ben Hur (2010) is, nonetheless, well worth watching.

Thank you.

4432315,3,B004MOY97U,"I have seen both versions of Ben Hur, its earlier black and white version and the 1959 version starring Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd, so the comparison between the 1955 version and this one is still fresh in my mind. I had recently watched the DeMille version before watching this miniseries and the differences are monumental.

I doubt that director, Stephen Shill, set out to make an epic adventure and in that he succeeded. Shill's Ben Hur is a little movie with the emphasis on sex and as much nudity as he could get on the screen to spice up what needs no spice, rather like adding a cup full of jalapenos to an already spicy chili.

Shill's Ben Hur is earthy with a very young cast, most of whom give credible performances, but in whom there is little of gravitas or depth. Joseph Morgan broods well and purses his full lips as often as possible but fails to give more than brooding life to the character of Judah ben Hur. Kristin Kreuk is wasted as Tirzah and Alex Kingston's full blown charms fail to enliven Ruth, Judah's mother, or give her actions any heft or reality. Stephen Campbell Moore as Messala is feckless and rash without the depth of villainy that characterized Stephen Boyd's portrayal of Messala. Morgan and Moore are at best pretty boys playing at being men writ large and end up scribbled small in the sand, 2-dimensional at best, but not 3-dimensional or noteworthy. Jimenez as Athene was by far more interesting, although lacking in definable motives.

Shills' Ben Hur is a low budget bit of fluff with plenty of skin, sex, and nudity that pales in comparison to the 1955 epic saga. An actor with a little more mileage and a better understanding of the times and characters would have lifted this average film from mediocrity.

The scenery is, however, earthy and realistic and small, matching the smallness of the endeavor. In short, there is very little style or complexity in this version of Ben Hur with few standout performances.",1369612800,52,1966,4.689855072463768
4432316,4,B004MOY97U,This version was a realistic portrait of life during this period of time in history and characters who would have lived during this era.,1369612800,3,136,4.708333333333333
4432317,5,B004MOY97U,This was more realistic than the Chariton Heston version. This got more of a storyline of people involved with the time period.,1369267200,2,127,4.818181818181818
4432318,3,B004MOY97U,"I am a huge fan of Wallace's book, and the 1959 film is amongst my favorites. Yes, it had problems (the middle third of the book and several sub-plots were cut and Heston was at least 20 years too old for the part), but the parts that were there were faithful to the source. Not so with this loose adaptation. A number of other reviews have already discussed the changes made in this version; I will add some of my comments to the ongoing discussion.

The one thing they got right was the age of the actor playing Judah; he is both the correct age, and his acting is considerably better than the over-acting of Heston. But that's where it stops.

The number of abridgements, alterations, and fabrications not found in Wallace are far too numerous to list, but a few of the most aggregious are as follows. (1) Judah's motivation; Judah's motivation in the original is to find his family - it is his sole reason for surviving the gallies, the numerous adventures not included in the film, and ultimately the chariot race. In this version, it is reduced to simple revenge, and being reunited with his family becomes an afterthought. (2) Judah is betrothed to Ester before he is taken as a slave; in the book this doess not happen until the very end. (3) Once again, the middle third of the book is missing. (4) An extended subplot involving Agrippa nd Athene that intertwines itself throughout the entire film is introduced that in no was is rooted in Wallace's book.

The issues with the script aside, the acting is quite good throughout, as is the production design and filming. This is certainly a much ""smaller"" production than the 1959 film (the chariot race is reduced to a street race vice an arena race), but it is self-consistant throughout. It is for these reasons that I have given this 3 stars. Based on writing alone, it would have been 1 or maybe 2 stars.

I could go on and on, but I will stop here. If someone has neither read the book, nor seen the 1959 film, they might find this an interesting film to watch, but if you come to it with any preexisting frame of reference, you will only be disappointed",1369094400,7,2117,4.490909090909091
4432319,5,B004MOY97U,Well done. Excellent acting.  Nicely portrayed modern version of the epic original fictional tale of the historical events and times.,1368489600,,133,5.65
4432320,4,B004MOY97U,"I did like this movie.  It has wonderfully well drawn characters, and the actors, Joseph Morgan particularly, are more than up to their challenges.
The problem, as mentioned in another review, is that this is Ben-Hur, and not Ben-Hur, A tale of the Christ.
The book spends nearly a hundred pages with the three kings before we even meet Ben-Hur.  They don't even appear in this version.  And Jesus, in this version, is reduced to one line that he says several times.  It's not unimportant, but it isn't all there is to him!

This version seem like it is based on the 1960 movie.  The primary female character (Athena) is well acted, but one suspects, since the book's closest character is quite distant from this one, that she was added so Ben-Hur could have a sex scene.

The story (in all movies) gets worked around so the race comes nearer the end of the book.  But in the book, Messala, who survives but is crippled (like Simonides) is just as duplicitous after the race as he was before.  His actions against the Hur family were greed on his part and on the part of Gratus.  If Ben-Hur survives, he can try to get it back.  The imprisonment of Ben-Hur's family is not at all specific in this movie - or very even in 1960.  Messala is also dishonored after the race because he bet heavily and then refused to pay.

While the subplot between Messala and his father is very interesting, it does not stem at all from the book. Imagination seems better to me when it stems from General Lew Wallace.  It's a good movie, I just wish it had a little more to do with the original book.

BTW, in the ""Making of"" they refer to the ""original movie"" but, in that they mean 1959-60, not the earlier one, which still holds up, even if it's silent.",1368403200,,1737,4.401253918495298
