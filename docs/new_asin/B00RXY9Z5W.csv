I thought the video needed an introduction setting the stage for who the main leaders were, where they settled, why they settled.  The video starts us on the journey to Germany where there are interesting side trips to towns, down rivers and interviews with archivists. There is also interesting footage in present day America.  (I thought there could have been more information on the actual settlement in America).  Fortunately for me I had already done some research on Germans in Missouri so I could follow the video.  I think for the first timer the  narrative would be confusing.
I was interested in the video because I am doing research on German ancestors.  I did feel, however, that more solid information was needed.  I recommend for family historians who are doing research on German families in St Louis and southeast of St. Louis.",1437004800,,956,4.8580246913580245
