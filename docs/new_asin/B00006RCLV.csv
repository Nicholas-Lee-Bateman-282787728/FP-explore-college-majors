7972445,2,B00006RCLV,"A rather poor review of Abbott & Costello films.  Some interesting bloopers, but mostly trailers that have been ruined with superimposed info.  Would have been passable if not for that damn ""GT"" logo throughout.",1358121600,,211,5.176470588235294
7972446,3,B00006RCLV,"This chronologically arranged career study consisting of theatrical trailers (coming attractions), film clips, and outtakes plays like a Special Features disc for a special collection rather than a stand-alone offering. So if you don't own any of their films, none of this will make much sense to you. However, Abbott and Costello completists will have fun watching a lot of footage not currently available elsewhere (not even on Universal's Franchise Collections), especially the ""blooper"" reels. (If you've been dying to hear Lou Costello swear, here's your opportunity.)",1133136000,2,573,5.597701149425287
7972447,2,B00006RCLV,"I have this title on VHS, so replacing it with a DVD had been on my TODO list along with quite a number of films. The reason I bought this budget title on VHS in the first place is the inclusion of all those trailers, but the tape was low-quality, and worst of all, the letters GT (for Good Times) was bugged in the bottom corner of the screen, which is a personal pet peeve. Lo and behold, that annoyance has been digitally remastered and is a constant on the DVD version. Major letdown, but typical. Additionally, new (sub) titles have been added on each trailer, listing the title and date of the film at hand. In other words, if you are a fan of the novelty value of trailers, like me, then don't waste your money on this, since they get demolished on this collection. Otherwise, it's just a promo reel for their back catalog.",1109376000,6,830,4.326923076923077
7972448,2,B00006RCLV,"I love Abbott and Costello.  I always have.  Well, sure they were retired, if not dead, when I started seeing their films as a kid, but I loved them nonetheless.  I tell you this because if you are contemplating this DVD you must be a lover of Abbott & Costello.  I caution you now, this is no documentary, and a very sad attempt at a highlights reel.  It simply amounts to being trailors for several of their films.  I enjoyed it because I saw many of them on Saturday morning television with my grandfather, and only a small fraction of them seem to be available on DVD.  But, if you are not a big fan, this DVD may be a big disappointment.",1040947200,23,642,4.213114754098361
