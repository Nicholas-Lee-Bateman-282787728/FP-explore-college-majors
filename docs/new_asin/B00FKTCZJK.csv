5996845,4,B00FKTCZJK,"I was so excited to get this workout. It seemed that it would fit great into a busy schedule. On getting the CD I was so disappointed to find that it will only play on newer DVD players, unlike the ""6 Week Cardio Crush"". I have a older DVD player in my workout room but it plays the other CD's just fine. Other than that I will enjoy the CD, but it is a pain to either buy a new DVD player or move to another location to do this workout. It would be nice if that were listed on the information.",1393804800,,494,3.8529411764705883
5996846,4,B00FKTCZJK,"Split this DVD up into 3 days of workouts (I know, I should have done more) due to limited time;).  I enjoyed each day.  Could feel it a little next day.  I would recommend this workout.",1393545600,3,186,4.111111111111111
5996847,5,B00FKTCZJK,As a biggest loser fan I like most of the work outs. this one is quick but yet you can really feel the result. Dolvet is a great trainer on tv and the work out videos with him are just as great. I would highly recommend this to some one who is busy on the go and little time for work outs. about 10 mins and you are good to go,1393286400,6,326,3.6056338028169015

5996849,5,B00FKTCZJK,Great workout!  Love that you can do one quick workout or put 2 or more together for a longer workout.  Even just one alone is a great workout!,1392249600,7,143,4.071428571428571
5996850,5,B00FKTCZJK,This is great when you don't have a lot of time... I highly recommend this for those who are extremely busy.,1391817600,,108,4.190476190476191
5996851,3,B00FKTCZJK,"It might be that I bought the Amazon Instant video version , but there is no menu or directions in the beginning of how to start or how many segments to do.  There wash;t even a note saying what order the segments are shown in.

I am using it but it wash;t up to their usual quality.  ALso what would be really helpful it to have a clock on the screen counting down the 8 minute segments.",1390694400,6,388,4.012987012987013
5996852,3,B00FKTCZJK,"Be careful this is an online download only through Amazon video. I thought that if I purchased the download I would be able to download onto a DVD so my wife could workout to it, by playing it on the DVD player. No such luck. You can only stream it through Amazon Video. Bad Deal. And instead of having someone in the video doing the easier version, why not make a video where u can choose a workout according to your fitness level. They say there is a 30second rest between sets, but it goes from one exercise to the next. Should have been more rest between sets. This is not for someone looking to begin a workout regimen, it's more for people with some fitness background, more intermediate level. If u workout and are looking for another wrkout video for your collection I think it would work for u, if u don't mind watching it on your tablet or PC in your workout area. I was hooked by the star trainers, but the workouts are not that great. I would pass on this.",1389916800,9,968,4.266304347826087
5996853,5,B00FKTCZJK,"No more excuses that I do not have time to work out. This reminds me of Taebo 8 minute workout that I used to do on VHS. However, this is great for overweight or obese people, even the modified move is included in the workout and to go at your own pace. But doesn't mean don't move and do it either!

When I first got it, I would do the warm up, one workout of choice, and then cool down. Then after 5 days, I moved up to two workouts plus the warmup and cool down. Now I can do the entire DVD up to 60 minutes. I also shared this with my ""Release the Weight"" Facebook group too.

I'm over 200 lbs (5 foot 3, female) but know this DVD will help me strengthen my muscles, tone my body, and see the weight results I am seeking. I do it at least 3 days a week and another DVD or routine as well. I like to change it up and not get bored, or body to go through its plateau. I used to be an athlete in high school, and would love to be back my ideal weight of 130. So at 39 years old, I will shoot for at least 40 lbs by May 1, a day before 40th birthday. This DVD makes things possible even in the busiest schedule (at least do the warm up and cool down of 16 minutes).

I did some of the other biggest loser DVDs and so far this is the best!

5996864,2,B00FKTCZJK,Do not get the steaming version. All the segments run together and there are no menu options. Had I known I would have ordered the DVDs because I like the workouts.,1460678400,,164,4.32258064516129

5996866,5,B00FKTCZJK,"great video, but lets get real.  you need more than 8 minutes in a workout. This is a great pre-routine.",1450656000,,104,4.2
5996867,5,B00FKTCZJK,Good little fast workout! Love bob Harper and I originally bought it because the front looks like tae-Bo which I loved when I was younger.,1443571200,,138,4.56
5996868,5,B00FKTCZJK,"Does what it says its going to do, though I'm not sure I would call the ""warmup"" a warmup - but more of a lighter 8 minute full body workout.  The 8 minute workouts do make you sweat and are great when you want to focus on one or two areas or just a need a quick ""filler"" general workout.",1441670400,,288,3.8
5996869,3,B00FKTCZJK,"Nothing new under the sun with this DVD.  I have several of the Biggest Loser DVD's and this is pretty much the same stuff just repackaged into 8 minute segments.

For those with knee or shoulder problems, I believe these workouts are difficult.  There are a lot of lunges, squats and floor type exercises which require balancing your weight with your arm/arms.",1438732800,4,361,4.790322580645161
5996870,5,B00FKTCZJK,Good workout and customizable to all fitness levels.  Dolvett and Bob are encouraging and easy on the eyes too!,1436659200,,111,4.842105263157895

5996873,5,B00FKTCZJK,"Great segmented workout that you can expand or contract to fit your fitness and time constraints. Dolvett is engaged and motivating, and the crew shows different levels so you can modify as you improve. I prefer this style to Jillian Michaels, more friendly but still intense, and makes use of small and large muscle groups. Also, you don't need any equipment except 2 dumbbells.",1433808000,,379,4.9375

5996877,5,B00FKTCZJK,"It is really nice to work out with people of my shape and exercise abilities! Some of them were even sweating as early as I was!  Lol  I also appreciate that they have modified versions with each of the exercises. Most I could do the regular way, but some I did do it the modified way. It was especially exciting with a couple that I did the modified way when I was able to do the regular version it felt like I was getting somewhere and that even though I couldn't see a change in my body I knew it was on it's way and I was doing good for myself  :) I love the Biggest Loser show and highly recommend their exercise videos! Also, even though many of the 8 minute workouts would hurt while doing them I knew it was only for 8 minutes and even I could do it for that long! For 8 minutes the light is always at the end of the tunnel  :)",1429660800,,835,3.923076923076923

5996880,4,B00FKTCZJK,"I would give this more stars but I don't quite like the 8 min time because both the warmup and cool down are 8 min each, so that adds on a lot of time that could be spent exercising. I'm Typically pressed for time so 30 minutes is all I have so if I do the warmup, two segments, and the cool down then my time's up without feeling like I've done much since the actual exercise time is only 16 minutes .  Overall I like the workouts, they're very fat paced so you have to be ready to move quickly from move to move, they pack every minute full. Need weights and enough room for lunges and a mat for floor work if you have a hard floor.  Not boring at all because of the fast pace and diversity of moves. Intermediate level with a bit of a challenge. All people in video are ""real"" instead of exercise fanatics so it makes the workout very motivating. I like the video but wish the timing fit into my schedule better. I'll still keep it around for some variety when I have a little extra time (40 plus minutes).",1423612800,,1009,4.090909090909091
5996881,1,B00FKTCZJK,Ok. Not one that I will use very often.,1423180800,,39,3.4444444444444446
5996882,5,B00FKTCZJK,"This is a terrific DVD!  I have always been a fan of Bob's and I think Dolvett is great as well.  DVD has a good warm up, 5 quick routines, and a nice yoga cool down.  Thirty seconds of intense (as intense as you want to make it) exercise and a 10 second break between exercises.  I have been doing a PACE aerobic routine( highly recommended also), and a couple of the routines on this DVD  for my workout.  But I discovered, when I am pressed for time, these routines give you a good aerobic workout while you build and tone muscle.  One more point,  I especially appreciate the way BL lets you build a custom routine from the DVD, pick and choose what you want to do that day and away you go!

5996894,5,B00FKTCZJK,This video is very good. You can do as many of the workouts as time allows.  You feel like you did something even only completing one of them.  The runner in the family loves the workouts for off day training and core work.  There are modified workouts if the featured ones are too challenging.  Good for multiple fitness levels and attention spans.,1421193600,5,349,4.580645161290323

5996918,5,B00FKTCZJK,I love this because it is broken down into 8 minute segments by body part.  I mix and match what I want to do with other activities in my home gym. They are challenging segments but not over the top.  This a great option for the time restricted individual or if you are looking to mix things up a bit.,1396656000,11,301,4.0

The instructors could do a better job timing each set, and I find the participants' various paces distracting. However the video has an option to do the workout with the music only - no instructor talking, or comments from the participants - which is a plus.",1490313600,,519,4.350515463917525
