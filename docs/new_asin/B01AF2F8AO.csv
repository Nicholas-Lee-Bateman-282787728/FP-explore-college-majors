The product when purchased (and still was last time I checked) advertised as DVDs. However Alpha seems to have taken to the practice of burning their product onto DVD-R. This may have been acceptable if I had purchased  material from Warner Archive or Sony MOD for example, but in the case of a company which generally uses very poor quality source material and dodgy watermarked transfers it is just one more reason not to buy them.
