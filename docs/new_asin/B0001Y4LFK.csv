8018246,5,B0001Y4LFK,This was fabulous I really enjoyed it. The dvd includes two 50 min episodes which is wonderful. Both episodes are awesome. Without giving anything away- just know that Dr. Black jack is one awesome hero/anithero in anime. In fact this set has my tow most favorite Black jack episodes ever. One is about a young man who gets wounds which appear then disappear and Black jack must help him trace the sounce of his disease. The next is my favorite about the princess who lies dying and Black jack efforts to save her. great anime!!!!,1477612800,,530,4.589473684210526
8018247,5,B0001Y4LFK,"These are among my favorite Black Jack stories. The first is set in the village of San Merida, and tangles Black Jack up with an insurrection, its brutal suppression by the army, and a British army officer who starts having violent and bloody flashbacks to it even though he could only have been a baby at the time. The second is a story about the way that karma from bad behavior can live and continue for literally centuries. This is Tezuka the storyteller at his best, as well as excellent animation directed by Tezuka colleague Osamu Dezaki.",1475539200,,545,4.628865979381444
8018248,5,B0001Y4LFK,"Anime and surgery does not sound like a good mix, does it? However, Black Jack is certainly one of the best anime from the 1990's and the mix totally works. The series was created much earlier by the revered manga artist, Osamu Tezuka, the author of Astro Boy, Kimba, Metropolis, and literally 100's of other titles. If you have seen the other Black Jack episodes or the movie, then you know what to expect from this title; you know that Black Jack, the famous unlicensed doctor, will be thrust into some crazy situation.

The first episode features the doctor encountering a young man who has reoccurring visions of being shot multiple times in the back. When the man regains his composure, he realizes his vision is real, and he is bleeding profusely from wounds in his back, but before he can bleed to death, the wounds disappear, and has the good doctor baffled. He decides to discover the cause of this phenomenon by locating an elusive doctor. This episode is more interesting than the second one included on the disc, which is the most unusual of the 10 episodes of this series. On his way to assist a patient, Black Jack's car is covered by a blizzard. He leaves and it would appear that his is in Feudal era Japan. He agrees to help a woman with an unusual condition. One could assume that the director wanted to put Black Jack in a samurai-style movie.

Speaking of the director, Osamu Dezaki, is utterly brilliant. This is not the only anime I have seen of his. He also directed the Golgo 13 movie, The Professional, Air the movie, Clannad the movie, as well as others. His style of freeze frames and split screens are really innovative and always seem to make the scenes more memorable and epic.

This DVD comes from Central Park Media (CPM), which may not be an anime distributor that a lot of people recognize anymore. However, the Black Jack series is probably the best series that they have worked on. The English dub is different than the usual CPM dub, and by different I mean it is much better. The DVD case is a reversible clear case that is very common for Funimation nowadays. There are no problems with this DVD title at all. I just wish this title would be rereleased so more people could appreciate it.",1380758400,2,2227,4.548628428927681
8018249,5,B0001Y4LFK,"Because I've purchased all of the Black Jack anime that one can get their hands on I cannot write a review for all of them.  Overall I am very pleased with every title; all of them arrived well packaged, no scratches or shipping problems, exactly as described.  The stories I've watched several times an love them each time.  The impact of multiple genres inside the Black Jack titles is a great mix of horror, drama, comedy, suspense and more - each with their own storyline, well followed and ending perfectly.  Not a lot of ""left in the dark"" from the ""BJ"" series / OVAs, etc.  Highly recommended to any anime watcher, though most I believe should be over 13 at least.",1370563200,,671,4.512396694214876
