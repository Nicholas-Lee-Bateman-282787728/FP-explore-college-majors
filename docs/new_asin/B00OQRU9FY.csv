6759564,5,B00OQRU9FY,"This an excellent anime. I wouldn't judge until after I finish watching a couple more episodes of it.  It's a good new look at the anime, and I love it. Plus, it's uncut, so it shows us things that we didn't see in the original Cloverway/DiC dub, and the new voices are amazing!  Can't wait to see/hear who they'll pick for Ail, An, ChibiUsa, Sailor Pluto, and the Black Moon clan.",1417996800,7,381,4.352112676056338
6759565,5,B00OQRU9FY,"The Sailor Moon part 1 box set was great and I am sure this one will be just as good. No it wasn't perfect by any means but the original source materials were only SD and I think they did the best they could with what the had for an HD upscale. It was clean, crisp and it looks pretty good on an HDTV. The people complaining about this box set are looking at every frame under a microscope and complaining about how it wasn't everything they wanted it to be. You have to realize that alot of anime, and cartoons for that matter produced in the 1990's were only produced in quality good enough to look acceptable on an analog SDTV. And I for that matter think they did a pretty good job scaling and cleaning it up for HDTV's. I'm sorry that it doesn't please everyone but still I applaud Viz for their efforts on bringing this series to bluray. The nitpickers don't have to buy it but should realize that they are only hurting the industry and the rest of us for their nitpicking.",1417996800,32,979,4.240641711229946
6759566,1,B00OQRU9FY,"You shouldn't be allowed to rate dvds until they come out.  I'm also adding a negative vote based on the first set.  When they address the rerelease problems I will rate according.  The show itself is a 5, the DVD set  is a 1. It's not remastered at all and is god awful on a regular player. As a die hard fan, the fact that I'm not rushing to buy should say something.  The show looks much better in online format from a popular streaming service.  Not worth the money.",1417737600,17,470,4.166666666666667
6759567,1,B00OQRU9FY,"I saw this release had two five star reviews already and had to warn anyone looking to buy this...BEWARE! The first part of season 1 is already out and it is absolutely horrendous. There are a ton of issues with the video quality of the remaster and Viz has said they will not be doing a replacement program, leaving many fans disappointed and angry. I doubt they will get their act together for this release or any of the releases to come because all they want is money. They pretend to care about the quality, but anyone who can see can tell that this is one of the worst remasters in anime history.

Buying it is your decision, but I would advise to read the reviews on the first half of season 1 so you know what you're getting yourself into:

6759568,5,B00OQRU9FY,Yes Looking Forward To The Next  Release. Notice The Price for The Blueray Is higher Than The First Release.  Now That They Have Us They Will Continue To Raise The Future Releases. True Fans Will Have To Get It All. So They No They Can Do It. Its The Greed That Burns Me Up.

6759585,3,B00OQRU9FY,Not as Bad as Sailor Moon Super release. I have both sets and they both have the same problems. Season 1 part 2 is barely above the quality of a bootleg. The Japanese audio dips in volume or is clipped. At least it isn't out of sync. The images are rather grainy. The image quality is better than Sailor Moon Season 3 boxsets. Viz Media please do better. I wouldn't mind paying $40 for DVD Season sets if they were of high quality audio and images. I bet I could find old VHS tapes of higher quality than these subpar disc sets.,1510617600,,528,4.186274509803922

6759631,5,B00OQRU9FY,"Some scenes were choppy during scene changes. Also the set doesn't play the English version of the opening song, the opening song that played when Sailor Moon aired on Carttoon Network. Instead, the Japanese version of the opening song plays. I didn't mind the Japanese version. It was just unexpected. The voices all speak English, so no worry there (English and Japanese dialogue to choose from)",1478563200,,397,5.03030303030303

6759639,4,B00OQRU9FY,So happy this series is finally being given a proper release.  I'm still not sure how I feel about this new dub but it's still leagues better than the old dub.  Though I think I might have like Luna's original voice a bit better.  Taking off one star because the DVD shipped without the outer slip case.,1465430400,,303,4.280701754385965

6759641,5,B00OQRU9FY,Love the DVD set. bought it in Feb. for a late b-day gift for me. though now it seems i'm going to have to get a new set since there is a disc that seems to have a dent in it and keeps freezing up my dvd player and laptop.,1464912000,,222,3.46
6759642,5,B00OQRU9FY,"I have been an avid fan of Sailor Moon for nearly two decades. I have waited so long for an uncut version that is faithful to the Japanese original and here it is! I love everything about it: the pictures, the sounds, and even the English dub sounds great (though I am more interested in watching it in Japanese with subtitles). I am so happy! This release does NOT deserve any of these negative reviews.

As for the picture complaints: I have not noticed anything wrong with the picture. I am not a film expert though, so maybe I am just not seeing it, but I honestly think it looks great.

Now, as for the new dub complainers: The hard truth is: Get over it. Plain and simple. If you gave it a one star because you ""want the old dub"", you are truely missing the point and laying blame on the wrong people.

1. The rights to the old dub are forever in limbo and can never again be aquired because of copyright law. No way around that. Not Viz's fault they could not aquire the rights.

2. The old dub slaughtered the original context and words of the true Japanese version. I was heartbroken when I found this out and have been hoping for a ""true to the original"" cut. They didn't even dub all the episodes. Even if rights could be attained, there would be full episodes that would need new voice actors to dub the episodes and it would sound very strange to have different voices for different episodes.

3. ""Well, they could've just brought the old cast back"". No, they couldn't. For one, union labor laws would have made it complicated and costly. And for two, those women and men are in their mid-40s to maybe even early 50s now. They would not sound the same.

I have fond memories of the DiC dub, it's how I was introduced to Sailor Moon. I do think fondly on the former English dub voices. Honestly, going back and listening to the old dub after watching it subtitled in Japanese, I thought it sounded weird because I got used to the Japanese voices. If so many others can give it a chance and get used to the new voices, so can everyone else. Giving this amazing release a 1 star because you won't let go of the past is not fair. Laying blame on Viz is not fair. You are allowed to be mad, but put your anger toward who's to blame, and it's not Viz, it's copyright laws.

Okay, rant over. Bottom line, great release. It's 100% worth the purchase. It's a dream come true! Thank you Viz!",1463097600,6,2394,4.29490022172949

6759644,5,B00OQRU9FY,"I have been a HUGE fan of sailor moon since it first came to the U.S. back in 1995 & I'm very happy to see it back after a long hiatus from the U.S. & all other countries besides than Japan of course. This set consist of 3 Blu-ray disc & 3 DVDs (23 episodes total so episodes 24-46 of the series, which is the end of the 1st season). At first I wasn't really sure about the new voice actors since I was sooo use to the original ones but they really did grow on me especially sailor moons VA! Now I'm sure people have heard about the picture quality problems & ect, but to be honest I mostly didn't notice anything at all (maybe a tiny bit here & there but nothing that ruins the watching experience for me plus you'd have to be looking for it to find it) People have to remember this show came out in 1992 & is almost 25yrs old now (MY HOW TIME FLIES!!! >.<) as far as Sailor Moon goes in the U.S. this is the best quality release we have gotten yet, TRUST me when I say the picture quality is miles beyond the original DVDs/VHS that came out over 10yrs ago here in the U.S. I own all the DVDs/box-sets that were released by ADV & Pioneer/Geneon in the early 2000's. Well, I watched a DVD from the S series by pioneer (released in 2003 I think?) right after watching an episode of the new VIZ version & instantly noticed how fuzzy/grainy the Pioneer versions picture quality was compared to the newer release (not sure if it was just my tv or not but it looked pretty bad...) I will still keep my original DVDs of course since it has the old original English dub & its nostalgic to me but I'm definitely getting the entire series in the new VIZ dub as well! I especially can't wait to get Sailor Stars in English finally! Also I hope Sailor Moon S & Crystal come out on DVD sometime soon because everyone has been waiting FOREVER for them!!!

Even the voices are better than the original 90s version.  It really should be 2 stars because the show itself sucks.  For some reason I enjoyed this show better when I was 10 years old.  It does not age well.
The other issue with this it has six discs, yay! but when you look closely three are blu-ray three are standard DVD.  Ugg!!!! So it's only like 27 episodes.  DBZ blu-rays have like 40 episodes and are priced much cheaper.
There was no need t break this up as part 1 and part 2 except for a pure money grab.  They you're trick with them saying it's six discs because you think it's going to have tons of content because blu-ray holds more space.

Might seem like a stupid reason to leave a low review but I've got season 1 part one and season 2 both parts, all have the little dust protector sleeve and this one just doesn't because of what I would assume is a bad shipment.

I just couldn't look at it on the shelf with the others that had it, out of all them why would it be the one in the middle that I needed that doesn't have the sleeve?

6759684,1,B00OQRU9FY,"Purchased from Rightstuf; review of the Blu-Ray

Video-0.5/5
As expected from Viz, we once again get an abysmal ""HD"" remaster courtesy of Subatomic Digital. While the ghosting
issues from the last two sets appear to be non-existent, the video quality has taken an even poorer turn and has had a
ridiculous amount of DNR applied to it, causing it to appear even blotchier and pixelated than before. It also appears that Subatomic
Digital STILL have no idea how to properly deinterlace footage. Check out the ""clean"" opening and ending videos on the
third disc; THAT is how the image should look, but instead Viz have decided to remove fine detail and pretend that it is High
Definition.

Audio 4/5
The audio quality is great. The Japanese track isn't as powerful as the newly recorded English dub, but it is still the best
quality that we have been treated to.

Features-2/5
Some behind the scenes stuff, art galleries, and the mentioned creditless opening and ending sequences.

If you are a fan who just wants to own this for the sake of legally owning Sailor Moon, just buy the standalone DVD sets;
You get the same video quality for a much better price.",1441324800,,1156,4.736318407960199

6759686,5,B00OQRU9FY,Love how this fits right into my Part One box case. I grew up with the original English dub and while I sometimes feel nostalgic and miss it this cast is way better! Translation is better as it acting ability. Only issue I have is that Rei and Usagi's voices sometimes sound so similar I can't figure out who's speaking. I much prefer reading Eng. subtitles and listening to the original Japanese track.,1440288000,,403,4.534246575342466

6759691,5,B00OQRU9FY,"I got into Sailor Moon after becoming a fan of Momoiro Clover Z, and I can definitely say it is one of the best anime series I have ever seen - I see why it is so popular.  Since I didn't grow up with Sailor Moon, I have no knowledge of or have seen the original dubs.  So, for anyone who is a bit of an anime purist, you should be glad to know that these are the original, uncut episodes with Japanese dialog and english subs!

I feel the complaints regarding picture quality are a little infair as Viz was forthcoming about the quality of the masters.  Sure, there is some pixelation, but overall the picture quality looks great in my opinion - especially on bluray!  The colors really pop too.  To any newcomers to Sailor Moon, you won't be disappointed.  The writing is really top-notch with witty humor and the Japanese voice actors are seriously some of the best I have ever heard.  The show is (as the Japanese call ""Kawaii"") cute, but there is also a very serious, dark tone to the show as well.  Buy it - you won't be sorry!",1439337600,7,1033,4.256410256410256

6759712,4,B00OQRU9FY,"It's part 2 of season 1 of the Sailor Moon re-release! This set fits into the box for Season 1 Part 1 where the empty box labeled ""Season 1 Part 2 Goes Here"" fits, which is handy, although doing so will probably hurt your set's collector's value. If you even care about that. With these disks, you will have all of season 1. Season 2/Sailor Moon R/Sailor Moon Returns is available for pre-order now if you end up liking it.

As with the first installment, this set features new English dialog to accommodate the unedited footage, as well as medium-high def video of the full episodes. Why medium-high? Well, the BDs were mastered from an editing reel that was sharper than standard def but sub 1080p. To compensate, the set has been subjected to significant DNR. It's not as sloppy in this edition as in the first installment, but purists will still mourn the absence of gritty video that, properly upscaled, would probably look better.

If you haven't seen the Japanese show or the first part of this installment, then the big differences you will notice from the US 90s release are more humor, some very minor swears, and some Japanese cultural stuff that got cut for time and clarity. There's nothing too adult, although this half of the season is darker than the first (and consequentially a bit more interesting). Still solidly PG, I'd say.

The bottom line is that if you liked the first half of this season, this set will continue to impress, and if you didn't then it won't much change your mind. Although more of the episodes in this set made it into the US show, they were also more heavily edited, so if you're a fan just coming to this edition, you'll see a lot of new stuff.",1431993600,3,1687,4.542763157894737

6759725,4,B00OQRU9FY,"My only complaints is that number one: I REALLY miss the songs from the 90s dub. The episode where Usagi is revealed as the princess just wasn't the same without the My Only Love song. It was still beautiful but My Only Love really makes your heart pound so without it, it felt a little off to me. Of course I KNEW that those old songs weren`t going to be included when I bought it so it obviously wasn't a deal-breaker for me.
The other thing that kind of put me off was the dialogue in the episode when they visit the moon and meet Queen Serenity. It just wasn't as dramatic as the old dub. In the old dub you really felt Queen Serenity`s heartbreak when the Moon Kingdom was destroyed and she sent them all to earth, in this one not so much. In the new dub theres a lot of unnecessary explanation going on by the Queen unlike in the old dub where the story kind of just told itself leaving you to focus on the heart of the story and the pain of that tragedy. So that was upsetting because its one of my favorite Sailor Moon episodes.
Other than that I`m enjoying the new dub and the actors are doing a wonderful job!",1430697600,13,1119,4.137614678899083

6759733,2,B00OQRU9FY,"While I've found the picture and audio quality of the Viz releases to be acceptable unlike other fans, the one thing about this release that annoyed me was that the aspect ratio was tampered with. The black bars on the sides of the screen have been removed (they were present on Part One) and the picture now fills the screen having been blown up which now makes the picture grainy. Other than that, the video quality is fine. I just hope that future releases of the series restore return to presenting the show in its true original aspect ratio.",1427673600,4,546,4.525252525252525

The restoration is done mostly very well but some scenes have a pink glow!!! I don't know why but I have the feeling its been done on purpose to make it more girly. I don't think the show is only for girls so viz there is no need to make everything pink!!!!

+ good restoration
+ the sound and music is more clear
+ also an english spoken version
+ includes japanese

- the pink glow in some scenes
- the girly package... and 6 discs in one blu-ray box why?
- sometimes the screen jumps a little

Overall this is a great set and the screen quality is very good just like the sound and the music is very clear.
don't expect the screen quality of an animation from these days but a well restored show from the 90's.

6759759,5,B00OQRU9FY,"Okay, so I have yet to start on Episode 36, but I'll tell you what I can without spoiling it for those new to the anime: If you left off at episode 23 on the first half of the season, episode 24 ends the arc started on the first half and episode 25 is where it starts to get serious in the pursuit of the Silver Crystal. The Moon Princess is awakened and an ally in battle is forced onto the side of evil villainy. The Devil is in the details.

Again, like the previous half, don't expect miracles beyond a clear picture for DVD and clear sound for DVD as well. The black bars are present as is the animation quality for a 1992 anime. Other than that, it retains the translation that truly hardcore fans enjoy.

In fact, the Sailor Moon anime was what got me started in learning Japanese culture as I found Japan intriguing for a country a couple thousand years old and it always shown one foot in the door of tradition and the other in the door of innovation.

I can only say that if you enjoy this show uncut and dubbed with the right names for every noun, you will enjoy this conclusion to the first season.

EDIT (April 21, 2015) I had watched it to its fullest and there are a few spoilers that I will use to make sense. Episode 42 is an episode that shows the only time Sailor V was in any action and deals with being selfless in love, something that Disney-owned DiC cut out. Episode 43 restores the reason Rei had the Moon Stick from the Japanese version, so you fans keen on the idea of Rei being more than a hotheaded stereotype and that Usagi is a dear friend, this is a relief to hear. Episode 45 & 46 are the two part finale that was edited into one episode in the First Dub's days. You will be glad to see a more touching and much more grave example of commitment to the call of duty as warriors.",1425945600,3,1810,4.1335227272727275
6759760,5,B00OQRU9FY,"I use to own ADV release of the first two seasons. I find VIZ's release to be heads and tails above what ADV put out. Picture and sound quality are great. I actually love the new dub. The voice acting is great and suites the character perfectly! I like the English scripting too.

I only watch the bluray version though. I can't speak for the DVD version of the series. I've heard there's some quality issues with the first batch of DVDs released.

Will you like this? Well, that depends. If you want a nice quality release of an anime that's over 20 years old, then you'll like this. If you're expecting perfection, you'll wanna pass.

6759775,4,B00OQRU9FY,"When the first set came out there were countless reviews addressing the picture quality, color distortion as well as the aspect ratio of the release. I was therefore rather surprised to find little to no mention of these things in the reviews for the second set. This could either mean two things; consumers dropped their support after the disappointing quality of the first set or they didn't find much problem with the second set and therefore moved on to critique other aspect of the release.

When my set arrived earlier this week, I waited in suspense for the opening credits to roll by to see if any improvements has been made. To my relief, the color distortion which made the first set unwatchable for me (I was watching in Japanese with English subtitles hence the unnaturally bright colors made the subtitles illegible) was corrected. In addition, the aspect ratio is no longer embedded into the formatting therefore you can actually program your player to stretch the picture if you prefer to have it filled up your screen. By doing so, it too addressed the issue of black bars for those not watching on a wide screen television. By simply correcting the color distortion, it addressed the problem of minor picture details that were disappearing into the background in the first set. I included a side by side picture comparison in my review so you can see exactly what Im talking about.

This therefore confirmed what I was initially thinking. With the picture issue now resolved consumers therefore moved on to nitpicking other aspect of the release with majority of the focus on the new DUB. I cant comment on this as I only watch it in Japanese and therefore isn't an issue for me.

With that said, I am now a satisfied consumer again and would therefore continue supporting VIZs release for the other four seasons as well as crystal. Why the four star then? By not going back to correcting the first set, it remains unwatchable for me and this inconsistency does not sit well with me. Also, by fixing the color distortion there isn't much difference between the picture quality of DVD and Blu-ray so why is VIZ still insisting on putting it on Blu-ray and charging us so much more just for the nicer looking packaging? These are the only things that is preventing me from giving this second set five stars.",1424995200,49,2322,4.728395061728395

6759780,2,B00OQRU9FY,"One of the reasons I fell in love with this show was the animation and the artwork. All that has been marred with sub par video in VIZ's release. On anything bigger than a computer monitor, pixelization is rampant, there is terrible ghosting, and on certain scenes, the characters appear to strobe! The episode where Makoto and Motoki walk in the rain, is a prime example of this! You can hardly tell it's raining other than some vague blurry white movement going on around them. This has nothing to do with what other people think is ""90's animation"", etc.. Look at VIZ's Ranma release and you'll see that even though that animation is older, the restoration is WAY better! This Sailor Moon is terrible. As many people as are raving about this release do all fans a disservice. This is terrible video quality on every front and should not even be on a blu ray disc.
There is one saving grace, and it's probably the biggest reason if not the only one to support it, and that is, the dub is so much more faithful to the source material. Either way, we're doom(tree'd -hehe!)ed with this version until VIZ's license runs out and we hopefully get the real release a show of this caliber demands.",1424563200,6,1192,4.5488372093023255

Unfortunately, I don't like the Dub from Viz Media and prefer the dub from Dic, but I'd rather watch it with Japanese with subtitles anyway. Anyway thanks to this, it's more affordable than buying the other sets on amazon. I found set 1 to be a tad boring but set 2 kept my eye glued on the screen. I'm glad Viz Media decided to release all of Sailor moon, I'll be able to collect the whole series!",1424131200,,554,4.4411764705882355
6759786,4,B00OQRU9FY,"More inconsistencies from Viz mark a return to widescreen format changing the whole look of the series again. In the last release, the black lines on the side of the screen preserved the original broadcast ration on 4:3 screens. Some fans were upset although I though it looked better overall. Aperantly, enough fans were upset because this set is now widescreen and looks less sharp overall. The pictures looks more blurry and some of the episodes with lower quality animation look bad.
That said, the show is still excellent and presented in vibrant yet not as sharp details as the first set. The remaster is pretty good for an old show with no digitization or color bleeding. The sound is mono and the voice talent for the English dub is better at delivering their lines this time around. The best part is still the uncut release and the true to source material dialog that is inappropriate for american televison and brilliant for fans of anime and the culture clashes of Japan and American values.
I gave it 4 stars as before because the widescreen is easy to get used to and the overall package is very good. Looking foward to continuing the series.",1424131200,2,1155,4.694581280788177

It's absolutely great! The quality is great as well and I'm OCD when It comes to such things. I think people just don't understand you can't bring such an old anime to the ""HD"" standards of today. Things are going to change slightly, that's a given.

I love this release and HIGHLY recommend it for old fans and new fans alike. Can't wait for the rest of the series to come out!!

6759795,3,B00OQRU9FY,"I own every uncut DVD box set for Pretty Solider Sailor Moon released in North America. ADV's seasons 1 and 2 box sets (which had beautiful packaging as well), Geneon's complete S & SuperS box sets, the movie Dream Box set, and all 14 ADV DVDs for the DiC dub. In other words, I have a very good collection to base this review on.

When Viz announced they'd be releasing the series including Stars, I was thrilled! Not only was it Sailor Moon but it was Sailor Moon in high-def! I have bought both parts for season 1 so far from RightStuf and I can honestly say, Viz you messed up big time. Very disappointing! While the new fun is fantastic and very faithful to the original story, their treatment of the video is atrocious!

Colors have been oversaturated and off (Umino's hair is green!) ghosting is present in both releases, and there is an incredible loss of detail. What's really sad is that I watch the DiC dub and for not even being HD, the quality is way better! And what really gets me is that Viz just keeps pumping out lies about the failures in their release, a cherished anime that they made us feel they were incredibly devoted to. I have rips of the Japanese restored DVDs and those are also better than this foobar'd release. You had a chance to do something really great, Viz; at least admit your failure instead of making us Moonie's look like it's all in our heads!

Packaging is beautiful, that's definitely it's plus side. Menus are also beautiful. If you're gonna charge is $60 for each half season, at least do it right and make it look half decent!",1423008000,17,1573,4.43598615916955
6759796,2,B00OQRU9FY,"UPDATE:  So apparently Toei has just announced their own HD remaster and released a GORGEOUS image that puts Viz's remaster to shame. Viz is probably better off following the example of the Australian release and not even touching the original masters and release the SD DVD, cause there is zero point in investing money in the blu-rays at this point.  What a mess.

Let's get the bad out of the way: the image quality is really ugly.  It's pretty much beating a dead horse at this point, but after watching the first set of this remaster, the problems began to really stand out after a while.  I actually was a defender of Set 1 at first; I was surprised by all the negative feedback and thought everyone was overreacting; the picture quality seemed bright and vibrant, and was miles ahead of the ADV releases from years ago.  But, after a few episodes, the ghosting and the oversaturated colors become really noticeable.  It may not be quite as bad as the ADV sets, but it's far from being without its own problems.

On the plus side, the dub is still fantastic and it's a joy to listen to the new voice actors get comfortable in their roles and to hear a more faithful adaption.  The packaging is really beautiful too and I love the art that they have chosen.

So I guess it really does boil down to if you can see past the bad picture quality.  I'm no videophile by any means, but its pretty obvious that this remaster just isn't very well done.  It's kinda disappointing that VIZ wouldn't address the image issues on this set but I guess at least it's consistent with the first one.
As far as buying future releases, I'm not sure at this point.  If anything I might just buy the DVD sets, but if the PQ continues to be this terrible I might just save my money instead and watch it on hulu.  The first half of R released on Hulu was also pretty low quality, but it looks like theres been a big jump on the more recent episodes, so maybe they've gotten their act together or hired a new remastering company. I haven't noticed any ghosting and the picture doesn't look so saturated.

So far there haven't been any announcements on a release date for Part 1 of R, and many people are speculating that it's probably been delayed.  If so, I'm hoping that Viz is seriously addressing the PQ.  I'll gladly wait a little longer if it means we'll get the best Sailor Moon release possible that the fans deserve.",1422921600,11,2406,4.431818181818182
6759797,5,B00OQRU9FY,"I still have my old VHS tapes of the old 90's dub and I've gotta say I like this version better. Granted, it's just my opinion, but I think this feels closer to the original Japanese voice acting then the weird valley-girl version of the 90's. The music is better, it looks a lot better then my old beat up videos, and I can watch the original version with English subtitles. The booklet is a little episode guide and I think it's a nice touch to the box-set. Having the Blu-ray and DVD in the same batch is great. Now I can watch it in any player in my house. I'm very excited about this release. I can't wait to watch the rest of the series!",1422921600,8,643,4.111111111111111

Only complaint, is that Fansubs explain a lot of things with footnotes at the end, rather then shifting it, just a little

but this thankfully, shifts things a very little, rather then outright rewriting the story, like the Dic Dub.

The original music, Kami willing we'll soon hear it on public Television.

This Blu ray has no trace of the Stench of localization about it.

it is unsullied. this is Sailor moon targeted at the niche

A warning to Dic Dubbies, this is not for you, unless you are considering redemption. this is sailor moon aimed at the niche",1422662400,5,640,4.619469026548672
6759800,2,B00OQRU9FY,"Before people start jumping at my throats in the comments, this is not a review of the series, just the technical aspects of the release. Before people jump on me defending the quality of the series as being a product of the 90s, look at the fantastic remasters of Ranma 1/2 (Released by Viz, but the video itself was handled by the original company.) And before people jump at me for reviewing a product that technically isn't out yet, I got my copy in 12 days early thanks to the miraclemakers over at RightStuf.

As I'm sure many people have seen with the previous Sailor Moon sets, the series first-ever uncut release in the US is not without its issues, while the dub itself is spectacular, they continue to allow an incompetent company (Subatomic Digital) to (mis)handle the video content. Its telling that the first thing you'll notice is again the rampant ghosting, while maybe not as bad as it was in the first set, still exists (And again, its not consistent, but its worst with darker objects in front of light backgrounds). The artifacting around lines, still prevalent. The gross muddiness and oversaturated colors, still present. I will give them this though, there are less issues in this set from what I've seen, but whether that's from them dialing back on the excessive video editing or the masters improving is yet to actually be known (And chances are we won't know until the set officially releases).

I will point out that the DVDs still use the same ""Remaster"" as the Blu-Rays, though this time they had the good sense to remove the extraneous pillarboxing so the show will appear in its proper aspect ratio when played on a 4:3 TV.

At this point I'd recommend if you have a region-free DVD player and some extra cash lying around to just forget about Viz's half-hearted attempt at Sailor Moon and consider picking up the Madman release which will include the English dub and feature a non-butchered video source to go with it. Or just pick up the DVDs from this point onward unless you absolutely need the special features or the artboxes, the video quality's about the same as the DVD and its considerably less expensive.

Of course, if the video quality thing just absolutely doesn't bug you, then go ahead and buy it. The dub is great and while the first season isn't my favorite this set does contain some really good episodes (Such as the first appearances of Makoto and Minako, AKA Sailors Jupiter and Venus respectively). The packaging is also nice and shiny, though if you're putting set 2 into the set 1 LE Box then you might want to consider removing the slipcover, while it does fit in there it seems to jut out a small bit, nothing excessive but it looks far more uniform without. Also unlike the last set the sticker used to advertise the extras is directly on the slipcover itself instead of in shrinkwrap (Which is just over the case itself presumably to prevent damaging the edges of the slipcover) which is sort of a dumb move considering you'll most likely end up with sticky residue from trying to remove it which dulls the shininess of the slipcover.

I really hope starting with the next sets they contract a company that hires people instead of trained otters to do their video authoring. The goodwill they garnered on licensing the series and releasing it after so long can only bring them so far.",1422489600,11,3345,4.66271186440678

And it is uncut as there are several episodes in the first volume that never made it to American TV as well as certain parts of the episodes edited to be ""appropriate"" for children's television.  Some things to remember though is this show was produced and aired in Japan in 1992 so it's going to have the appearance quality of a remastered cartoon of that time period.  It's not going to be as crisp and clean as Sailor Moon Crystal is.  I can't wait for this to come out as well as the next four seasons (R, Super, SuperS, and Stars).

Picking up right where we left off in Part 1, villains Zoisite and Kunzite of the Dark Kingdom are introduced and are off to complete one task: collect all of the Rainbow Crystals. However, their quest is interrupted by not only the Sailor Guardians, but Tuxedo Mask as well. In addition, two new Guardians are introduced: Sailor Jupiter (Makoto Kino) and Sailor Venus (Minako Aino). In Part 2, we also are treated with many surprising revelations and events, including the fact that Usagi's rival Mamoru Chiba is actually Tuxedo Mask (the mysterious figure who has aided Sailor Moon in many battles) and that Usagi is actually Princess Serenity, the Moon Princess that the Sailor Guardians have been searching for since the beginning of their journey! After the death of Zoisite, Tuxedo Mask gets kidnapped by the Dark Kingdom and transformed into an evil crony to assist Kunzite in further battles. The final battle against Queen Beryl is also quite captivating, with every Sailor Guardian except for Sailor Moon being killed by Beryl's monsters, leaving Sailor Moon to face the evil Queen and Tuxedo Mask by herself. I'm ambivalent about the ending where Usagi wishes for a completely normal life and wiping her and everyone else's memories clean of the events that had taken place, but other that, I certainly enjoyed watching the second half of season one!",1525046400,,1431,4.99163179916318

Beyond being a fan of the series, this is rather sub-par release of the anime as far as quality goes.
As others have already said, what Toei provided was bad quality for Viz to work with.
Viz did what they could and besides some inconsistency, it's okay. But Toei is to blame here for the bad quality. The image quality sometimes dips to abysmal levels. Toei really is a horrible company. Not only are they lazy with the properties they on, I feel this was bordering on sabotage, giving these masters to work with when we know there are better quality releases out there.

I wasn't a fan of the new dub in the first half, but it seems to be a lot better here.
Maybe that's because of the excellent voice acting for Zoisite and Jupiter.

As far as extras, it's bare bones with some random cosplay stuff and the slip covers are gone now.
It may seem strange rating it a 5 after all the complaining, but the show itself (and the dub this time around) is excellent and deserves it. Just know this is the best English version release in North America, but better quality exists in other countries.",1518566400,,1211,4.330396475770925
