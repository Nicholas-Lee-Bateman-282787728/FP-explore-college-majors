health care provider with my patient in her home, we were both on the
edge of our seat waiting for the true killer to be seen, for the 2nnd time, we had to leave for an appointment, we have yet to see the last
45 minutes of this movie, we're keeping a watchful eye for when it comes
out on dvd, u will love this movie, it has all the elements of a great
film and cast, talk about the right people bring the characters to life
the nail was hit on the head, check it out , u will not be sorry that u
did.",1228262400,13,570,3.7983193277310923
