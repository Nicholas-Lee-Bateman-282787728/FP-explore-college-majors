5932991,3,B00EPH8T6Q,"I have many of Jennifer Galardi's workouts. I'm always sweaty afterwards, but never feel too taxed. They are perfect for days when I don't want to exercise but know I should. This one is, eh, okay.  The third routine is not much of a workout at all; it's like a cool-down. But, as always, fun booty-shaking in my living room.",1393200000,,325,4.416666666666667
5932992,5,B00EPH8T6Q,This Dance Off workout video is updated and fun. Jennifer has all new moves that don't repeat from previous videos. I am  loving it.,1390694400,2,132,4.5
5932993,5,B00EPH8T6Q,"Others have given more details, so I'll just say, these are all the dances I remember doing on the playground at recess and over at my friends' houses after school. That made it really fun, even though I'm not a great dancer.",1390003200,,225,4.380952380952381
5932994,4,B00EPH8T6Q,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; you can read a more detailed version of my review on that site.

""Cardio Hip Hop Party"" provides three routines which, according to the DVD case, feature ""hot dance styles.""  Jennifer Galardi instructs this 41-minute workout live and is accompanied by two background exercisers, Dawn and Jenny.  No modifications are shown for the choreography, which is moderately complex and with moderate impact.  However, Galardi teaches a separate 26-minute ""Step Guide"" segment which breaks down some (not all) of the dance steps featured in the DVD.  The guide includes instruction on the following ten moves:  1) Cabbage Patch, 2) Old School Shuffle, 3) Roger Rabbit, 4) House Hop, 5) Glide, 6) Sweep, 7) Slide, 8) Push, 9) Dig & Snake, and 10) Swivel Step.

The Main Menu of the DVD has options for Play--Chapters--Step Guide.  Selecting Chapters brings up a submenu that lists the Warm-Up, Cool-Down, and each of the three dance segments separately.  I have broken down each of these chapters in greater detail below.

WARM UP (5 minutes)
Galardi begins with an out-out in-in step.  She then stands in place for isolations of various parts of the body, including neck, shoulders, chest, waist, and hips.  Returning to the out-out in-in, she adds a heel-knee step and a few dynamic stretches to finish.

OLD SCHOOL (10.5 minutes)
This segment brings the heart rate up.  Apparently, many of the moves--such as ""Cabbage Patch,"" sort of wide march with triple step, and ""Roger Rabbit,"" a backward step--are supposed to be familiar dance steps.  However, I graduated from high school in the 80s and went to dance clubs in the 90s, and nothing Galardi did here looked familiar to me.  What was a big odd about this section was that after running through the moves several times, Galardi adds an entirely new sequence.  It seemed like she was starting a completely new routine (with small side kicks), but eventually, she does add this to the first series, taking it from the top.

HIP HOP HOUSE (10.5 minutes)
This was the highest energy segment, but also the one with the most impact.  The ""House Hop"" is a relatively simple heel-side knee move, but the energy continues with the Glide, Sweep, and Slide.  The final two combinations were a lot of fun:  a high knee with opposite arm punch and a standing crunch with heel push.

VIDEO JAM (10 minutes)
This last routine is performed at a slower pace; in fact, I found it difficult to keep my heart rate elevated (one move is actually called ""Stroll""!).  The other issue I had with this section is that many of the moves (such as the opening ""Push"") required twisting your foot on the ground, which is difficult to execute on carpet--definitely not ideal for many home exercisers.  This was my least-favorite section.

COOL-DOWN (5 minutes)
Galardi begins the cool-down with reaching side stretches, moving through pli.  She also performs pelvic scoops, upper body circles, shoulder stretch, triceps stretch, and chest stretch.  For the lower body, she moves through a forward bend and lunge to stretch the hip flexors.

As an instructor, Jennifer Galardi does an excellent job:  her mirrored cueing is clear, and her instructions are easy-to-follow.  Personally, however, I do not like dance workouts which are so complex as to require a separate tutorial to teach the moves.  Most home exercisers like myself have limited time for our workouts, and so we certainly do NOT want to spend half as much time learning the moves as it takes to complete the actual workout!  That being said, I did not watch the Step Guide prior to trying the dance routines, and I was mostly able to follow along, although it required a good deal of concentration.  As noted above, some of the moves on this DVD are quite fun, and for those who easily learn new choreography, DOTI ""Cardio Hip Hop Party"" may be a good choice.",1386115200,4,3940,4.840059790732436
5932995,5,B00EPH8T6Q,"This was a DVD my Granddaughter couldn't wait to get her hands on.  She was loving that Jennifer taught her some new dance moves.  After the initial step training they really got into some good moves that she totally loved.  If you like and want a high energy workout, this one is for you.",1385078400,7,289,4.314814814814815
5932996,5,B00EPH8T6Q,"I am a huge Jennifer Galardi fan so this might be a bias review however, I love the old school style in this dance video.  Roger Rabbit, Cabbage Patch, come on those were all the dances I did when I was a teenager so this video fit me to a tee!  High energy as well so this workout is great.",1384214400,5,291,3.8333333333333335
5933007,3,B00EPH8T6Q,"I really wanted to love this as much as the other Dance off the Inches Hip Hop DVD but I just don't. The last DVD was fun, and I found that the step guide in that DVD wasn't necessary (for me, at least). So I skipped the step guide for this one, and I was lost. I should note I grew up in the 1990's when 'The Roger Rabbit' and 'The Cabbage Patch Kid' were cool, so it isn't like I didn't know what I was doing.

This DVD just had a different vibe to it, if that makes sense. But that's not to say that someone else would not love it. It just felt a bit forced, for me. I can still see someone else finding it fun and benefiting from it.",1440633600,2,637,3.789473684210526

5933010,5,B00EPH8T6Q,"At first I thought ""Oh lord, I'm never going to get these moves"", but I've found that this 60 year old can actually do these dance steps. It's a fun routine. Some of the moves are more strenuous than those in ""Dance Off the Inches Hip Hop Party"", and I wish I didn't have to adjust my direction because my living room isn't as large as a dance space, but it's totally do-able and really gets one sweating. Galardi's cuing is excellent and the introductory section demonstrating the moves are a big help, but doing the actual routines are just as effective in getting you to do the moves correctly.",1430611200,,597,4.4363636363636365
