4232905,4,B003Z8ZC2A,"I was left not knowing which of four possible interpretations to rest my thoughts upon (i.e. to whom do we fix the blame for Jolene's revolving relationships) in this Shakespearean tragedy as follows:
First, that it was Jolene's own undoing through her selfish misuse of her attractiveness.
Second, that it was Jolene's misfortune to be attractive in a culture that manipulates that attractiveness i.e. societal values.
Third, that males for the most part are manipulative for their own ends irrespective of the harm it would inflict upon Jolene (or whomever the object of attention is).
Fourth, that it's the gods (or fate, whatever) that map out our destinies, Jolene's in this case, and she and her males (well, partners) were just pawns in a predestined fate.

Anyway, good script, directing, acting, pace, tone and cinematography. As for how the movie ends, one interpretation is that you just need to continue the pattern she finds herself in. Or, another is ...",1316563200,,968,5.05
4232906,3,B003Z8ZC2A,"Jolene is a somewhat interesting but flawed film with problems regarding plot and casting which undercut its believability. It's a coming-of-age story of a supposedly beautiful young woman from a broken family who grows up from age 15 to her mid-twenties who has numerous relationships with men -- one or two in each venue -- and keeps moving on. It's a sort of hybrid between a road movie and mini-relationship stories. The men along the way, generally, are invariably extremely handsome schmoozer types who say the right things and make the right promises, and who have hidden flaws, but they pay huge prices for their encounters with Cinderella-as-semi-slut Jolene. The basic mini-structure is this: a man comes on to Jolene; Jolene accepts; problems ensue; man suffers; Jolene moves on.

In the beginning, Jolene marries an earnest but naive teenaged boy who commits suicide after learning of her affair with his uncle. The uncle, as a result, (since Jolene is only 16) spends almost two years in jail for statutory rape. Next, Jolene has an affair with a female lesbian social worker at the psychiatric facility who helps her escape the institution, but Jolene leaves her. (Nothing bad befalls the social worker other than Jolene leaving, although she had risked her job to spring Jolene.) Next, Jolene marries a tattoo-artist who turns out to be a drug dealer with another wife; he probably goes to jail as a result of Jolene's phone call to 911 before she departs. Next, she becomes a nude Vegas dancer, and a mobster falls for her, promises her a life of no worries, but he gets shot without much of a fight (almost suicidal -- why didn't he run when he knew he was about to be assassinated?). Next, a devout Christian -- perhaps the richest and most eligible bachelor in Tulsa -- falls instantly in love with her, marries her without much investigation, but later he swings sharply into a brutal wife-beater upon learning of Jolene's past.

My basic problem with most of the mini-relationship stories is believing that these lovers of Jolene -- various men and one lesbian -- people who had a lot going for them in terms of looks, jobs, style, wealth, power (although each admittedly had a serious flaw or flaws) -- would form such rapid sexual attachments with a young woman who was basically uneducated and who came from a sketchy family background without much nurturing or love, with predispositions towards prostitution and nude dancing. How did they get so infatuated so fast? And how could Jolene miss seeing their rather serious flaws each time until it was too late? So I have a basic problem with the characters here, specifically the portrayals of men as sex-starved prone-to-lying wife-beater types without much character or brains.

The only way, perhaps, that I might have believed the romantic motivations is if Jolene had been drop-dead gorgeous and the men had been less pretty. But she's not gorgeous. And the men are. So it's unfortunate casting. To be fair, the lead actress who played Jolene had a refreshing tomboy-like innocence with smooth skin and a svelte body but I would not characterize her as being so beautiful that it enticed men into making choices which landed them broken on the rocks below a high bridge, in jail, or shot by mobsters. She's good-looking but not a drop-dead knockout. Further, I was perplexed by the choice not to have Jolene wear much makeup during the film, so her face seemed rather bland (although real) in contrast to the heavily made-up men (eye makeup, etc). Make-up would have heightened her appeal (there was some makeup in the middle of the movie.) The overall effect of the poor script and mismatched casting was confused character motivations. I had trouble believing that most characters were real, including Jolene. And the ending seemed unresolved and inconsistent with the rest of the story.

4232907,3,B003Z8ZC2A,"I have very mixed but intense feelings about ""Jolene."" On the one hand, it features a magnetic lead performance by Jessica Chastain. I've never seen her before, so I can't say for sure whether she's a fantastic actor or just one of those people who outshine everyone around them (I suspect both), but either way, I'll see anything else that she's in. But the film itself, which cruises along for 3/4 of the way with a fairly light tone (considering the subject matter), takes a very unpleasant turn towards the end that left me feeling duped. I don't have a problem with movies that are dark or depressing, but there has to be an authenticity to it. This one seemed senselessly cruel, not in the way life can be, but in a way that sets the viewer up for one experience and then swaps in a horrifying, unjustified alternative. The heroine makes a decision that seems to makes no sense and completely invalidates everything she has gone through to that point, leading to terrible consequences. I haven't read the Doctorow story it's based on, but if it provides an explanation for this decision, it gets lost in translation (some vague voice-over rationalization is attempted but fails to convince). I'm left with a very bitter taste that diminishes the enjoyment I had experienced up until that point.

Even so, this film is worth watching for Chastain's performance. She's going to be huge.",1306540800,29,1390,4.767634854771784
4232908,5,B003Z8ZC2A,"When do you know for sure you are in love?  After a failed marriage at a young age, Jolene (Chastain) deals with getting over the past and finding herself.  She sets off on a journey across the country looking for what is missing in her life.  This is a very, very good coming-of-age story, also kind of inspiring in a way, no matter what happens to her she never gets down and keeps pushing forward.  On the other hand it is also pretty depressing to watch what this girl goes through.  This movie does a great job of showing what a girl, who was raised as an orphan and spent her youth between the home and foster parents, acts like.  Though it's not her first movie the woman who plays Jolene (Jessica Chastain) is fantastic in this.  It's not an easy role, especially with as much sex and nudity involved (nothing gratuitous, it actually helps define the character), along with the ranges of emotion she must portray.  I'm really surprised she didn't get any recognition for this. I don't want to give too much away, but I really, really enjoyed this movie.  I give it an A.

Would I watch it again? - I did already.",1303862400,35,1120,4.393203883495145
4232909,5,B003Z8ZC2A,"Judging from the large volume of films Jessica Chastain has coming out in the next two years, people will inevitably want to see her early work (and in this case the film that she explodes into the movie making world with - as I had really only seen her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stolen-Blu-ray/dp/B003CJXJ5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stolen [Blu-ray</a>] before). After watching the lengthy interview included on this BD and being mesmerized by her screen presence throughout this beautiful film, she is proving herself as one of the most natural and articulate ladies in the industry.

The story follows a young lady through ten years in her difficult teen and early adult life, traveling from state to state as she looks for love, expressing her amazing artistic skills, and a better life than what keeps getting thrown her way. The supporting performances around her are believable and professionally played, but Jessica was beyond captivating and managed to convey a heartfelt and solid lead performance that carried the title character perfectly.

The BD quality is clear throughout with no real falterings. Her fair skin never appears to bleed into the frame, and even in the Arizona scenes the contrasts are subtle yet still vibrant. The DTS is competently mixed and the special features include:

* Bloopers, 3:33 minutes. Not funny and could have easily been excluded and the quality is below lodef.
* Interview with Dan Ireland & Jessica Chastain, 20:54 minutes. A sit-down interview with the two of them talking film and career. The film was made four years prior to this talk and she has definitely come into her own. Worth the watch if you become a fan of hers (a dry setting in a room).
* Interview with Theresa Russel, 3:00 minutes. Only talks about her character (library setting - dull), skipper.
* Interview with Dermot Mulroney, 4:21 minutes. Funny and informative about indy film making (outdoor panoramic forest setting - beautiful).
* Interview with Michael Vartan, 6:04 minutes. Having watched his whole set here one should be a huge fan of his to sit through it.

4232910,2,B003Z8ZC2A,"Terrible movie. I think the five star reviews are due fans confusing their feelings about Jessica Chastain with the film quality.

While it is true that if all youve ever known is rejection and abuse, you're likely to have a string of abusive relationships. You cant think you deserve more if from day one, youve been told you are worthless. in Jolenes case, shes an orphan with dead parents or her parents just gave her upboth ideas are entertained in the filmwho is then sexually molested by foster fathers and beaten by her foster mothers.  Its not hard to imagine that such a person would continue to have abusive relationships. In Jolenes case, her lovers, boyfriends, and husbands become wealthier and more controlling. Jolene never catches on. So in that respect, the movie is very uncomfortable. Its clear to the audience that each of these people are problematic, that they don't hear or even see Jolene.

Jolene seems to see the problems in some, like Bradley Benton, but she deludes herself, I guess, and goes along with it. Others are innocuous to Jolene, like her Vegas mafia boyfriend, who collects things and Jolene certainly decides to ignore the things that don't add up.

I think this movie would have been more realistic if Jolene didn't keep getting rescued by wealthy men or men with access to cash. If Jolene stayed middle class or working class, exploring her exploited life would have been a lot more interesting.  Domestic violence certainly does happen in all social classes but Hollywood always makes movies about prostitutes rescued by weathy men (Pretty Woman) and little orphan girls who meet attractive wealthy men.  Why cant movies show the poor and working class every day women who experience abuse and exploitation? Oh, cause you cant show stunning night scenes from rooftops in Vegas and...Tulsa???

Through in a bunch of caricature roles and there you go...",1524787200,,1894,4.937106918238993

Unfortunately, it trots out all the stereotyped characters and dumps them all in one movie. Love Jesus? Man, you will look like the devil made flesh in this saga. Italian? Count on the Mafia being your 'business.' Family taking you in with your new husband? This is the South - count on being molested. And, of course, a tendency to dress like and look like Johnny Depp means you're a drug dealer.

Still: it's a pleasant way to pass the time, watching Jessica Chastain convincingly age from a 15 year old to someone in her mid-twenties. That's worth the price of admission because she does this so well.

The protagonist shows strength and perseverance through some horrible and all too common stuff. American men may not want to see what they look like, so they might not like this film, but American women will relate to the challenges here. The acting, casting, and directing are superb, but some of the camera shots could use some improvement. Unlike most films, the sex scenes in this movie were used to tell the story, not just plastered on the screen for shock or selling factors. Girls should be protected from abuse, but in America, they are only met with more abuse and attacks from every side - men, women, the system, Christians, you name it; everyone they SHOULD be able to rely on. Those people would never watch this film and acknowledge their shame; they would only attack the protagonist to deflect it away from themselves. Instead of focusing on the failure of our society, this film tells a story of hope. It is very well done. I am adding this to my permanent collection.",1516060800,2,1121,4.63819095477387

Do they read the rating, or synopsis before hand?

Do not watch movies that say there is sex and violence, and then give them a bad review because they have sex or violence. There was nothing gratuitious in this movie. It tells a story. A phenomenal story of survival, a rough journey packed with colorful yet dark charactors.

 And Jessica chastain is stunning. She put incredible beauty out there and makes watching the journey she is on worth watching. I think her charactor is heroic as she goes through what she does over a 10 year period between age 15 and 25. Brava!!

4232972,5,B003Z8ZC2A,"Director Dan Ireland (""Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont,"" co-founder of Seattle International Film Festival) uses a story by E. L. Doctorow (""Ragtime"") to bring us a fifteen-year-old girl who marries a boy to get away from an abusive foster home. Problem is, she jumps from the frying pan into the fire.

Over the next ten years, we encounter:
  * Jessica Chastain (Winner of 2008 Golden Space Needle for Best Actress, SIFF) as our eponymous heroine. This actress ages from age 15 to 25 and plays everything from a high school student to a pole dancer in a strip joint; from a Tulsa housewife to a glamorous redhead kept by a Vegas kingpin. This is a dream role for any actress and Chastain is amazing.
  * Zeb Newman (lots of TV) is her gawky first husband; he is the frying pan...
  * Dermot Mulroney (""The Wedding Date"") is Uncle Phil; he is the fire (see above).
  * Frances Fisher (Lots of TV) works in a mental hospital (don't ask!).
  * Rupert Friend (""Pride and Prejudice"" - 2005) is another husband, a randy musician with a tattoo parlor.
  * Chazz Palminteri (""Modern Family"") lives in a Las Vegas penthouse.
  * Michael Vartan (""Rogue"") is her wealthy Tulsa husband. He doesn't want to know a thing about her past....until he does....
This is an R-rated study of a resilient little gal who is the epitome of grit and determination, AND she washes up nice! This film was made in 2008, so even though I saw it at a theatrical press screening this week, it is already in on-line catalogs, and might be available on Netflix or in your local library.

4232989,4,B003Z8ZC2A,"Some people have led interesting lives. ""Interesting"" usually comes in both flavors (elation and tragedy) for everyone, as is the case here: Jolene experiences some joy, but more than her fair share of heartbreak. Having first viewed this upon its release in 2008, I am ordering it now on Blu-ray for a rescreening and the extras, since good films bear watching more than once.

The vivacious and resilient protagonist (Jolene, of course) is thrust into a world where men are not the only predators who a beautiful girl needs to worry about, although men do make up the bulk of seedy characters in this instance (look at the cover). For those of us who have been in a string of flammable relationships (I am saying this as a man, and one who's hitchhiked many kilometers), the events in Jolene are not too outrageous to be beyond belief, but are just flamboyant enough to keep the audience engaged. The ""caricatures"" will offend some viewers, but there is more truth to ""Jolene"" than many people are willing to acknowledge, as many are fairly ignorant of what the United States is actually like under the faade (having only lived in their own little bubbles).

Life certainly doesn't have an overabundance of happy endings, but at least you get a hopeful ending in the last minute of this film. Bravo to the writers, the director, and the actors for a unique experience.",1430524800,,1370,4.7521008403361344

4233002,4,B003Z8ZC2A,"Jolene is a film that stars Jessica Chastain as the titular character. E.L. Doctorow's acclaimed short story Jolene: A Life gets the big screen treatment. It follows the course of Jolene's life over the course of ten years, as an abused 15-year-old foster child up until her life as a 25- year-old woman. She is a red-haired wanderer who isn't content to call one place home for any expended stretch of time. Setting off to explore the outside world at age fifteen, the free-spirited teen embarks on a decade-long cross-country of adventure which finds her crossing the paths of everyone from a firebrand Texan that steals her heart and destroys her marriage to his wealthy fundamentalist nephew, to an ex- mobster attempting to make good in Las Vegas.

Watch this film for the wonderful performance of Chastain alone. She proves near heroic embodying Jolene's innate strength and incremental wisdom. Yet she also makes us understand how the heroine's wobbly resistance to manipulative characters is overwhelmed time and again. Also,it is an engaging road movie that charts the adventures of an orphan teenager as she experiments with sexuality, marriage, and adultery. While its lumpy story drags long before its running time is up, the film serves as the perfect showcase for new star Jessica Chastain, a dazzling redhead whose talent and radiance keeps its many parts watchable.

4233013,3,B003Z8ZC2A,"This movie had great potential to be phenomenal; however, it falls very short.

Jessica Chastain is amazing and this is my first exposure to her in a substantive role.  Where Jolene went right is, as I mentioned, is the story itself (by E.L. Doctorow) as one that has begged to be told.  When the story begins, Jolene is a child, a product of the foster care system, who is virtually abandoned by her birth parents.  Survival is the main theme of the film, and we follow Jolene in her journey to emotionally and physically survive.

In her search for love (familial love and acceptance that humans instinctively need; certainly not romantic love or affection) and for a place to lay her head, we watch Jolene desperately maneuver from place to place, partner to partner.  And we also see predators in action, as it's extremely common for sexual, emotional, and physical abusers to choose their victims based on vulnerability, ability to isolate, and ability to manipulate.

We get to observe Jolene make choices based on mere survival throughout the film, watching her grow and evolve, *almost* able to trust her ability to rely on herself and her own instincts--until the predators pull her back in, in a cycle of abuse and reliance.  Jolene is used and abused, but with each instance, she evolves and survives--as we all do.  And incredibly enough, through the most horrifying circumstances, Chastain never tells Jolene's story as a victim.

While the story itself is extremely brilliant and a raw insight in how domestic violence often starts, the transition from paper to screen seems to be a rocky transition:

There are far too many cliches in this movie.  I don't know where it's written that any movie based in the South or that has Southerns in it must be a caricature with over-the-top melodrama. Chastain holds her own, but most of the rest of the cast does not, unfortunately.  The character Coco Leget (Rupert Friend), for instance, is an English actor who must have learned to mock a New Orleanean accent from Hee Haw.

The acting is ""sub-par""-ingly distracting.  Again, Chastain shines, but the acting takes away from the heart of the story.

Overall, it's definitely worth a watch, if not for the commanding presence of Jessica Chastain and the survivor's story.",1391990400,3,2278,4.8779220779220775

There's a pole dance in Las Vegas that will win the hearts of men all over the world, I expect.  Unfortunately the film is dreadful.  It starts out somewhat promising as we see a pretty, naive, young girl being taken advantage of, and who manages to get out of the situation...well, by taking advantage of someone else. The film follows her from one misadventure to another. In each case we hope that something good will come out of it, but it never does.  We hope that, at least she will learn something from her mistakes, but she never does.  Each scene is the same; some guy sees her, falls instantly in love with her beauty and she succumbs to their ""love.""  Each one takes her to some high vista and together they plan for the rest of their life, happily together ever after.  And each one proves to be big trouble.  There's no growth in her character, there's no ""arc"" of drama....it's just one bad scene after another, ending in a pitiful fantasy.  It's hard to believe that this script was adapted from a story by a renowned writer. Doctorow. The supporting cast is filled with offensive caricatures -- the ignorant Southern hillbilly, the oily haired Vegas mobster, the Lesbian attendant at the reformatory, the wacko drug-dealing tattoo artist, and probably the worst, the insanely cruel Born Again Christian.

4233021,3,B003Z8ZC2A,"This film is based on a short story by E.L. Doctorow and I can't claim familiarity with it, although I'd be curious to read it now. The only real reason to watch this film is for the lead, Jessica Chastain. She's gorgeous to look at, but that wouldn't sustain a film. What she has is the ability to look like she's not acting. Her presence comes across genuine no matter how peculiar the situations and characters around here are (and they ARE peculiar). That's the problem with the film. Specifically, the people around the lead come across as fictional, unbelievable characters, while Jolene, thanks to Chastain is sympathetic and somewhat more plausible. Pause the film anywhere and look at her expression, it'll be spot-on. True, it's a stretch even with her to believe, given the traumatic circumstances she's lived through - foster homes with sexual abuse, people of both genders preying on her or otherwise taking advantage seemingly at every turn - that Jolene would remain so sweet and oddly naive. At the end of the film, she's just 25 but has lived enough lifetimes for a couple people. You'd think she'd look a little more spent.

Theresa Russell has a small part early in the film, which brought to mind one of her earlier starring roles as the femme fatale in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Widow/dp/B00013RC66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Widow</a>&nbsp;(recommended!), where she constantly reinvented herself, dramatically changing up her look and persona to snare new men. Jolene does something similar, although it's the inverse; she complacently changes herself to suit whatever man of the moment has entered her life with the promise of a better life, love, a meal ticket, etc.

Jolene may not look spent by film's end, but you might. The end is unsatisfying and doesn't offer enough resolution to justify all the viewer has been through with this character.

EDIT 12/1/13 Well I made a point to track down the short story of the same name, Jolene: A Life. It's in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweet-Land-Stories/dp/0812971779/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweet Land Stories</a>.

Enjoy the train wreck, er.... the show!",1374969600,4,752,4.536764705882353
4233023,4,B003Z8ZC2A,Interesting movie good acting I enjoyed the movie especially Jessica Chastain It was interesting to see her act in an earlier role before she made major movies.,1372464000,,160,4.962962962962963
4233024,4,B003Z8ZC2A,"I love this movie. When I first saw this movie, I knew that Jessica Chastain was going to be a star. Not only that, I knew that she would win an Oscar someday. Fast forward to 2013 and her on the red carpet, nominated for ""Zero Dark Thirty"". She will win someday because she knows something that most actress never find out. She is fearless. In the span of the length of ""Jolene"", she grabbed every taboo that actresses face by the throat and strangled the bejesus out of it.

I don't really know why ""Jolene - The Director's Cut"" was released, but it isn't as good. There are many many cuts, most of them sexual and there are many scenes that are different. Ultimately though, ""Jolene"" is about the power of a woman and the strength of a woman, sexuality and all. So cutting these scenes made the movie less of what it originally was.

Bottom line, ""the director's cut"" is too much of a cut and the original is a better film.

Jessica Chastain tackles this character of ""Jolene"" and showed what probably was an Oscar-worthy performance before anybody knew who she was. The movie is about innocence and sex. No matter how much we want to deny it, it is what drives us, many times in the wrong direction. For some, it drives us in the wrong direction over and over. It is the nature of the beast and what we see from Jolene is the development of her inner-strength and maturity after a lifetime of taking the harsh road.

You want to see an actress bury herself in a role, check out the ORIGINAL CUT of ""Jolene"". Jessica Chastain went from a virtual unknown to an Oscar nominee and you can see why in this 120 minute movie from 2008.",1365465600,7,1632,4.358552631578948

This is a well written story of a few years in the life of Jolene, a girl who just can't seem a place for herself. It is just a great movie and its story stayed with me for days after I saw it. Highly recommend.",1365206400,2,383,4.1891891891891895

4233028,3,B003Z8ZC2A,"JOLENE is an adaptation of one of EL Doctorow's short stories from his collection `Sweet Land Stories'. That story was one of the few forgettable ones in that collection and makes one wonder why it was singled out for a screenplay by Dennis Yares. Doctorow is one of America's most important writers (Welcome to Hard Times, The Book of Daniel, Ragtime, Billy Bathgate, Loon Lake, The Water Works, The March, City of God, etc) and this is surely not one of his finest moments. Made in 2008, it did give Jessica Chastain an opportunity for exposure (as in ""total'!) so perhaps that is why it is making the rounds again - before Oscars....

Jolene is a 15 year old girl, at story's beginning, who knows nothing about her parents and who marries a geek boy (Zeb Newman) whose own parents are mysteriously dead and lives with relatives who are odd - the aunt (Theresa Russell) is angry with the world and uncle (Dermot Mulroney) is a pedophile: Jolene ruins her first relationship by having an affair at age 16 with the uncle , her `husband' commits suicide, and she ends up a juvenile delinquent in a `home' for wayward girls. There she is courted by staff member Cindy (Frances Farmer) who helps her new young lover escape. Jolene runs away to hit the road hitchhiking (selling favors along the way), and ends up in a desert drive-in where she meets and marries a tattoo artists Coco (Rupert Friend) who is a drug dealer on the side and Jolene steps out of another bad relationship. Making her way across the country she stops in to work as a stripper and is noticed by a rich man (Chaz Palminteri) from Las Vegas who shows Jolene wealth and love but is murdered by a rival gang from New York. Once again she hits the road to end up in Tulsa, OK where she is courted by a sicko right wing evangelistic wealthy boy (Michael Vartan) who marries her despite his wealthy parents concerns, gets her pregnant, then throws Jolene's past in her face, claiming their newborn child as his own - Jolene being a used and unfit mother. In desperation Jolene moves to Hollywood where she follows her one talent - art - and dreams of becoming a movie star.

Dan Ireland directs this bit of treacle and an outstanding cast makes the best of the script they're given.  Chastain shows evidence of the superb acting skills that now yearly are becoming more apparent. But as a movie, JOLENE Is a contrived little mess - and it makes us wonder how the powerful EL Doctorow could be so diluted. Grady Harp, February 13",1360368000,8,2493,4.535555555555556

She is an awsome actress, and pleasing to look at as well.  Shes one script away from the gold.  Jolene is a good movie ...bit of a tear jerker in places, and a very good storey line.  On a side note though, is it me or does she look alot like Bryce Dallas Howard...it also took me back when i found out her real last name is...Howard.  Perhaps Ron isn't telling us everything.  One big difference though...Jessica has talent",1355788800,3,593,4.385321100917431

The girl  Jolene  (Jessica Chastain ) passes through a lot of misshape  and hurdles, growing up through a pitiful marriage to retard country boy  with a sex maniac uncle through drugs and weirdo guy already married.
In whole this is a tough life for Jolene that does not lose her courage and will always go further to a better life ,not like her own without the memory nor the closeness to a mother and father an orphan out of nowhere..
Jolene  changes thousand faces all beautiful and heart touching.
The acting of Jessica is amazing out of this world ,not only she is amazingly beautiful her acting is superb.

This movie spans a decade of Jolene's journey to self-discovery and the people she meets along the way. Jolene encounters many men who exploit her and make her feel horrible about herself. It's funny how in life, we make the same mistakes over and over again and never really learn from them.

Two things I didn't understand: 1 - She was never legally married to the second guy, because he was already married, making the marriage to Jolene void. Therefore, the lawyer who said she married her 3rd husband while still married to her 2nd was totally wrong; 2 - The guy in Vegas told her she would be taken care of, even after he was gone, so why didn't she just go back to Vegas and cash in?  Well, maybe there were 3 things... I dunno why the hell she married that 3rd one, he was a real psycho. Anyway, it's not as bad as some of these reviews would have you believe.

the only guy who treated her well ends up getting murdered. I was straight up pissed at her when she decided to marry the last guy when he was obviously a psychotic piece of shit who told her she smelled like warm milk, illegally fired her, and was rude to everyone in the proximity as well.
