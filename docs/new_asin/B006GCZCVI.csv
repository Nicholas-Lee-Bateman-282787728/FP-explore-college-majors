8497496,4,B006GCZCVI,I bought this DVD for my adult daughter to use with her God children. It is one of a series which I chose because it was recommended to me as having suitable Christian ethics tailored for young viewers. It has several short stories involving the animated cars in child-level ethical dilemmas It does deal with ethics like sportsmanship and fair play yet the stories are fun too. 6- and 8-year old sisters enjoyed the story lines and animation. Their 2-year old brother just loved the cars. I think it would be suitable for children up to 8- or 9-years old and maybe slightly older.,1331942400,,581,4.596153846153846
