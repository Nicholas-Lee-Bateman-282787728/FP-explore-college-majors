1178187,5,B0000039D4,This is one of my all time favorite movies to television that John Ritter did including The Fling with Connie Sellecca. Both of them are great to watch.

1178202,5,B0000039D4,"This movie is a must for any die hard, John Ritter Fans.  Along of course with so many other movies he had been in during his short career.  He always reflected such diversity in his acting.  Romance!!!!!!",1376179200,,205,4.486486486486487

1178211,5,B0000039D4,"HI, THIS REVIEW IS FOR THOMAS OR FOR ANYONE ELSE IN THIS CONFUSING SITUATION. WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS THERE IS OR WAS A SHOW IN THE UK CALLED HEARTBEAT, CAUSING SOME CONFUSION WITH VIEWERS WHO THOUGHT WHEN THEY BOUGHT THIS MOVIE, THEY WERE GETTING THE DAILY SHOW THAT IS SHOWN IN THE UK. ""HEARTBEAT"" STARRING JOHN RITTER AND POLLY DRAPER WAS RELEASED IN THE EARLY 90'S, BASED ON A NOVEL WRITTEN BY DANIELLE STEEL, WITH THE SAME TITLE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SINCE THIS MOVIE IS ADVERTISED SPECIFICALLY AS DANIELLE STEEL'S HEARTBEAT, THAT SHOULD HAVE ELIMINATED ANY CONFUSION UP FRONT. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE DANIELLE STEEL DOESN'T HAVE A DAILY SERIES BASED ON ANY OF HER NOVELS. I DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ALL OF HER WORKINGS, BUT SO FAR I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. I'M A BIG FAN OF HERS, HOWEVER I DON'T LIKE ALL OF HER BOOKS OR MOVIES, THOUGH I DID/DO ENJOY HEARTBEAT, WHAT THE SELLERS ARE ASKING FOR IS RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE. SUPPLY AND DEMAND I SUPPOSE.",1316390400,3,970,4.61271676300578
1178212,1,B0000039D4,"I have twice notified Amazon that the picture included with this item is wrong - the response: No Change - stating nothing wrong - But the picture is of an UK actor named Nick Berry and it is from the British TV series Heartbeat which started in 1992. Now the actors listed for this product include John Ritter. John Ritter was never on the UK show - He may have made a movie or US TV show called Heartbeat, but to include a picture from a different show is misleading. I was hoping to find DVD's of the UK show - but at present I do not know exactly what they are selling or trying to sell.

If the seller reads this they need to clarify what it is they are trying to sell. And, I know what I am talking about - I watch this show, in England, daily. Nick Berry (pictured) played PC Nick Rowan from 1992 - 1998. Please make correction ASAP.

1178215,5,B0000039D4,"Love is lost and then found in an unexpected place in this movie.  I have loved this Danielle Steel movie from the first time I saw it.  John Ritter and Polly Draper are exceptional in this story.  As a happily married career women whose husband walks out after she refuses to abort their baby, Polly Draper plays the character of Adrienne just right, not to weepy but strong enough to stand on her own decision and go on with life.  John Ritter's character comes into her life and as the loving father of two sons from a previous marriage he knows exactly how to win her over and become the husband she deserves and the father her baby needs.",1196294400,8,643,4.378151260504202

pick a favorite.  Each one has strong women. I like that about Her stories. Women are simetimes portrayed as week,  Ms. Steels books make
women winners.",1188345600,,225,4.575
1178217,5,B0000039D4,"I just liked this touching story right from the start! John Ritter and Polly Draper displayed such a warm chemistry and you just rooted for them to find their way to eachother despite the many hurdles they faced. Eventhough I've seen this movie several times over the years, I would watch it everytime it would air on Lifetime. It's just the kind of movie you could kick back, relax and shed a few tears of happiness at the end!!! I'm so glad this movie has been released on dvd because it's another body of work I can collect on the late John Ritter, who I still miss very much.",1127520000,3,579,4.321100917431193
