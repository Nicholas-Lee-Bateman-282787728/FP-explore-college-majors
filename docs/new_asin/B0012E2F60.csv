Best actors and actresses from HK, UK, and US brought their best performance in this tv series. Pierce Brosnan was playing Ian Dunross, and he was at his best, really charming. He was surely the ""tai-pen"".
A must see for everyone.",1051315200,10,319,4.614035087719298
3086552,5,B0012E2F60,"The Noble House mini-series is one of the best screen adaptations of a multi-layered character driven story I have had the pleasure of viewing.  I currently own the series on VHS and await its release on DVD.  The screen adaptation varies slightly form the Clavell novel, by way of avoiding one or two subplots; nevertheless it does bring forward a vivid look into the world high stakes business and politics in modern day Hong Kong.  For the individual interested in Wall Street type epics and the world of power business, Noble House is a definite must see.  The series is lead by an excellent cast who seem like they were meant to play their roles, powerfully led by Pierce Brosnan as Ian Dunross the Tai Pan of the Noble House.",1046908800,14,731,4.6
3086553,5,B0012E2F60,"This is one of the best TV miniseries ever made! It is quite difficult to portray the essence of a GREAT book on TV, and perhaps the fact that James Clavell (author of the 2 Volume book) took an active roll when making this movie helped a lot in its success.
Since Shogun, James Clavell became known as one of the best writers of all time. It all started with Tai-Pan, in the 19th Century with the birth of a commercial company which later became known as ""The Noble House"". In this new episode, James Clavell takes back the story to the ""present day: 1980's(in the book is the 1960's) and portrays one of the most thrilling and vivid stories ever made.
Hong Kong serves as a scenery to this non-stop drama story where everything happens so fast, with the most realistic environment and characters...the Honor and survival of the Noble House is at a stake once again. The ""old"" friends, the enemies, China, even the most insignificant habitant of Hong Kong will affect the future of things to come in an unexpected way.
An excellent cast for an excellent film.

3086603,5,B0012E2F60,"This is one of the best books by James Clavel turned into an epic TV mini series.  That James Clavell is a master story teller is not in doubt, but his work, the Noble House must rank as the finest of his works, the pinnacle of his art. Noble house has to be the best of his six books on the Asian Saga - (others include - King Rat, Tai-Pan, Shogun, Gai-Jin and whirlwind)  The book was great and the mini-series did not disappoint

 A young Pierce Brosnan was convincing as the new Tai-Pan Ian Dunross. There are so many intricately woven story lines which beautifully come together in the end to enable you have a full picture of what is happening. Loyalties are tested to the hilt and the strength of will and character called to question. Although the mini-series did not cover everything in the book, it stayed faithful to the story line with very few changes, like changing the setting from 1963 to the 1980`s with technological update.

3086648,5,B0012E2F60,"When this aired back in 1988, I recorded it on the new-fangled VCR we had just gotten. The miniseries aired over four nights and was based on the novel by James Clavell, who also wrote Shogun and Tai Pan. Noble House starred a young, handsome Pierce Brosnan as Ian Dunross, the current ""Tai Pan"" (Supreme Leader) of Struan & Company, an old and storied Hong Kong-based firm also known at The Noble House.

There's a lot the current Tai Pan needs to deal with. He has a potential takeover on his plate at the hands of an American Company named Par-Con, he has to deal with granting ancient ""favors"" to the bearer of special coins, kidnapping, horse racing, business rivals, Chinese spies and on and on and on. The fun never seems to end.

For many years, I would, on occasion, pull out the VHS tapes and play the series, commercials and all (those were kind of fun to watch, honestly) and then in the 2000s, I was considering throwing out the deteriorating tapes but then someone gave me their old Magnavox VHS/DVD writer combo and I got the bright idea to finally transfer the tapes onto DVD. That was okay but the quality was as poor as the source tapes. About a year ago, I watched the DVD and knew it was time to let it go - into the rubbish it went. Then I looked on Amazon just on a lark and there it was. It had been out for a while, in fact, so of course I purchased it and I'm still doing the happy dance. I wish I had known about the DVD sooner.

Personally, I love the fact that it takes place in the 1980s as opposed to the 1960s backdrop in which the book was written. But since it was only a 20ish-year difference, it still worked.

The cast included other notable names such as John Houseman, John Rhys-Davies (I think he was in the Harry Potter films recently), Ben Masters, Deborah Raffin, Julia Nickson, Tia Carrere and my favorite villain actor of all time  Khigh Dhiegh  who played the evil Wo Fat in the original Hawaii Five-O series and Four Finger Wu in Noble House. But an even bigger villain than Four Finger Wu is Quillan Gornt (played excellently by John Rhys-Davies), the Tai Pan of the Rothwell-Gornt, the sworn enemy of the Noble House.

When I first viewed this in the 1980s, it was a drama. But when I view it now almost 30 years later, there's a campiness to it from perhaps the passage of time. There are some very funny scenes that feature Four Finger Wu and his young Mistress, Venus Poon (Tia Carrere), and her little rat dog. There are also some overly melodramatic scenes between Lincoln Bartlett (Ben Masters) and Orlanda Ramos (Julia Nickson) that make me cringe when I view them in modern times  seriously cringe-worthy from a female perspective. Thank heavens for Casey Tcholok (Debra Raffin) for portraying a woman with some power and a mind of her own.

The really interesting thing about this series is the portrayal of life in Hong Kong under British rule before it was turned back to the Chinese. That the country would return to Chinese rule in less than a decade is also mentioned a couple of times as it was paramount in the minds of business leaders from the U.K. and in the case of this series, the U.S. (Par-Con).

The series managed to balance the many converging story lines that were going on simultaneously (though they all were connected in multiple ways). James Clavell didn't write the script. The book was adapted by screenwriter, Eric Bercovici, who also wrote many episodes of the original Hawaii Five-O series, the miniseries, Shogun and one of my favorite films, A Change of Habit, starring Mary Tyler Moore and Elvis Presley.

Just remember, this originally aired in the ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" era and it has that feel to it in abundance. The main thing is that despite some goofy 80s moments, this film holds up over time. And that's good writing.",1447804800,2,3827,4.507936507936508

The mini-series seems complete to me - at least as well as I can remember.  The scenes that were mentioned in earlier reviews as cut - the horse race, the China visit - are all here.  There's a couple of scenes that I remember being slightly different, but that may be editing trims or just fading memory.  Either way, they didn't take away from the overall story.

3086725,5,B0012E2F60,"We have the VHS copy of Noble House as well as James Clavell's entire series of six books he wrote on this general subject beginning with Shogun.  It is outstanding in every way.

There are some details left out of the VHS, e.g. the episode with the doctor and the anti-biotics necessary because of the floating restaurant fire which required that they all dive into the harbor waters which were reportedly very polluted.  A tangential reference to this was made to this by a single line in the hotel scene but it passed almost too quickly to be understood, if one had not read the book.  There was also a section involving some thugs attacking them out on one of the harbor island beaches near Macao.  That was a gunfight scene which was exciting.  In the book Ian's wife is very much alive, though not a notable character.  The VHS indicates that she had passed away some eight years before Deborah Raffin came on the scene as part of PAR-CON.  As far as the VHS production is concerned, this alteration hurts nothing and in fact makes the entire relationship between Brosnan and Raffin much more effective.  And, too, there was a rather thorough investigation into the death of the jockey riding North Star, the Noble House's horse, in the big race scene.  That omission bypassed some important details.

One of the very strong points about this production is that all of the supporting roles are played by first-class actors and actresses.  One of those roles, Quillan Gornt, played by John Rhys-Davies, could almost qualify as a second principal role to Brosnan's Ian Dunross, since he plays it so well.

Some of the epic scenes of the book are really very well shot and depicted; and it is hard to see how they pulled off the cinematography before the advent of CGI.

Actors are well placed to matched the books characters; with the exception of the Casey character; the actress was older and not as strong of a character as what the book described. The Ian Dunross and Link Bartlett actors were very well depicted .",1415318400,,622,4.408695652173913

Of course, there is a bit of unbelievability in the 2 most powerful men in the business world scrabbling about in a fallen building, but when one realizes they're there only because an American power-broker may be in trouble & he's the key to a potential lock on the US market , one can see why they'd risk so much.

Great to see this excellent production in today's hi-def. Even better on DVD than on TV what with it lacking the every-9 minute show/3 min of commercials.

Just to show how bad TV has become, most nights, & esp for big events like the Superbowl, commercials out-air events. In the 2014 Winter Olympics. NBC had 5-6 min of 'action' followed by 5+ full min of commercials. We've learned.

A fascinating look at the ending years of British control of Hong Kong. I am sure it's no longer the same place under Red Chinese rule now. It must have been glorious. Well scripted and well acted and filmed (mostly) in the exotic Orient. My only complaint is how often Pierce Brosnan mumbles his script lines (not unlike many modern British actors who lack the training of an earlier generation of stage actors on screen. (Also a lot of location filmingnot just in this film seriesseems poorly miced to me with loud background sounds muffling the actors lines.)

3086831,4,B0012E2F60,"A classic but little remembered TV miniseries with the young Pierce Brosnan not yet a James Bond with a lot of actors from that time.

This miniseries adjacent with the movie with Brian Brown called Taipan if not having the same writer are almost historically interconnected putting the two together in my head the stories where interconnected within the history of both the movie and the miniseries but haven't seen either of them in a long time I went on a search for them every couple of years to see if they came out on DVD and they finally did I bought both of them and was not disappointed with either one.

But if you're going to get both of them which I do recommend you have to remember the TV miniseries was filmed in the style of the TV miniseries of the time where this movie is more of a grander an epic scale Movie that takes place 100 or so years before

So if you're a fan of the grand TV miniseries of the 70s 80s and 90s and into the gritty looks into past centuries type of movies this is a movie for you.

3086843,4,B0012E2F60,"I loved the book, and had the film on a poor quality  SLP video  tape with no close captions.  When I saw the opportunity to buy the DVD I was delighted and not disappointed.  Although some viewers thought Pierce Brosnan was miscast due to his youth, and others thought him rather wooden I disagree and thought he really nailed it with an arrogant air of privilege combined with the ability to run the trading empire.  The Hong Kong location was just beautiful, the stunning homes and gardens, and the spectacular events, such as the floating restaurant fire, the typhoon, and the landslide  gave it the look of a theater film rather than TV.  I particularly enjoyed the insight of the dealings with Communist China  where both sides needed each other.  I was not aware that there was any contact between the two until I read the book, let alone a representative and branch of the bank of China in Hong Kong.

The reason for not awarding five stars was my disappointment in the espionage story which wa a major part of the book being cut, and the awful monochromatic set design which gave such a bleached look.  At times Deborah Raffin and several of the men disappeared into the furniture.  Ms. Raffin in particular would have looked far better in stronger colored clothing rather than white and beige, especially when in rooms decorated in various shades of white. beige and cream.  In one scene where she was seated on an off white sofa, she and Piece Brosnan were wearing white, the walls were a very pale  green tint, the carpet was pale beige, and as Ms. Raffin's hair was a dyed blonde, all that stood out was Brosnan's brown hair.  I found it very distracting.  Nor did I like Ms. Raffin's  pushy all American girl demeanor which compared with the quieter gentler oriental ladies, came across as brash, loud, and vulgar.  Perhaps that was intentional.  The Tai Pan was married in the book, but in the film they made him a widower so he could fall for Casey (Raffin).  Someone born and raised in Hong Kong and bound by strong family traditions would not have fallen for Casey.  They had nothing in common.

The espionage story was barely touched on in the film, which should have been a couple of hours longer to accommodate it.  for those who have not read the book, it was a classic double agent/triple agent spy thriller which added spice to an exotic location.  No one what what they seemed.  I thought of those old films with Marlene Dietrich as Shanghai Lily, Gale Sondegard in Shanghai Gesture,  Bette Davis as Mother Gin Sling,  the Orient Express, Macao, Casablanca and other taut thrillers set in foreign parts where no one showed their true face, no one could be trusted,  and I felt that the omission of the full extent of the espionage was detrimental to the film.

I would still recommend it to those who want a few hours of escapism, a trip to Hong Kong without the tiring journey, or to flesh out the book.",1373068800,,2929,4.578846153846154

3086851,3,B0012E2F60,"I was feeling nostalgic and purchased this and decided it would be a family event.  While many portions hold up more have not withstood the test of time.  The original novel was set in 1963, the mini series 1987, and watching it in 2013 makes several of the story lines banal.

Seeing Hong Kong post repatriation to China, youngsters cannot understand how afraid so many countries, businesses were afraid that Hong Kong would lose it's uniqueness.  With the amount of tourism, products and diplomatic ties that China now has the youngsters cannot understand how isolated and forbidden China was in the 1980s and before.

While watching I found it interesting that the theme song seemed to remind me of the television serial ""Dallas"", even the clothes and speech after awhile seemed to feel more like a soap opera than something that came from a rich detailed book.  I found it interesting that at the opening of a scene which takes place on Four Finger Wu's boat, the music was so dated that the kids began to discuss the music.

I have to say the part that saddened me the most is the stiffness of Pierce Brosnan as Ian Dunross.  At the age of 35 he was still too young to play such a seasoned character.  Watching the back of his head with the brown, I assume permed, brown waves was distracting.

As for the several romances that take place during the series, none of the couples seemed truly passionate.

I can say we enjoyed the movie, but it is not the big pageantry, I thought I remembered. It is definitely a mini series of it's time.

The series came on two disks, each disk had two episodes of the mini series.  The print was clear and came with subtitles.  There were no special features of any kind..",1365984000,,1712,4.534201954397394

3086853,4,B0012E2F60,"Produced and aired at the end of the 1980s, Noble House would be one of the last in a line of lengthy and epic miniseries. Based on James Clavell's thousand plus page novel (and move forward two decades in time to the then present day), Noble House features a wealth of location filming, dozens of characters and multiple plot lines across four parts and more than six hours of screen time. So how does it hold up a quarter of a century later?

The performances hold up well. Pierce Brosnan is fascinating as Ian Dunross, Tai-Pan of the Hong Kong company Struan's, the Noble House of the title. Brosnan is convincing as the man in charge of a 150 year old company who struggles to deal not just with the crises of today but with the weight of legacy of the Noble House upon his shoulders as well. While Dunross is not above perhaps less than savory at times, Brosnan nevertheless makes clear that is a likeable man with a strong sense of honor and duty no matter the cost. It is Brosnan as Dunross that ultimately ties in the various diverse plots together and, if his performance was anything less than what it is, I'm not sure Noble House would work as well as it does.

Moving on from Brosnan, there's a strong cast behind him. There's John Rhys-Davies as Quillan Gornt, the head of Struan's biggest rival and a man who seems to live for nothing but bringing it down. There's Deborah Raffin and Ben Masters as the heads of the American company Par-Con whose motives and actions are questionable throughout the entire miniseries. From there the cast of characters ranges from police Superintendent Robert Armstrong (Gordon Jackson) to Struan employees such as John Van Dreelen as Jacques DeVille, Michael Siberry as Linbar Struan and fellow Hong Kong businessmen such as Damien Thomas as Lando Mata.  Rounding off the cast in two cameo roles are Denholm Elliott as outgoing Tai-Pan Alastair Struan in the first part and John Houseman as Hong Kong governor Sir Geoffrey Allison in the last part.

Where the cast, and indeed both the writing and the miniseries as a whole, runs into trouble is with its native characters. The writing (and as a result the performances) mean that they are often walking and talking clichs, especially Khigh Dhiegh as Four Finger Wu and Tia Carrere as Venus Poon as well as the less savory characters who figure in its first half. Even characters such as Burt Kwouk's Phillip Chen, the compradore of Struan's, fall into moments of cringe worthy dialogue that undermine them considerably. Somehow it seems a shame that the script couldn't treat these characters with the same respect, though how much of that is down to the original source material I'm not sure.

Despite that problem, Noble House otherwise makes excellent use of Hong Kong itself throughout. In fact the city and its surrounding areas (including Macao) are as much as a player in events as Brosnan's Dunross or anyone else. The large amount of location filming gives the various storylines a strong sense of verisimilitude.

The miniseries is also blessed both with a large amount of screen time and a script that makes the most use of it. Based on the massive novel by James Clavell, Noble House makes the most use of its six plus hours and four parts. There's everything from business dealings ranging from a deal between the Noble House and Par-Con to Gornt's trying bankrupt the Noble House, kidnapping, murder, romances, concerns over Hong Kong's return to China (which was still a few years off when the miniseries was made) and international intrigues as well. Behind all that is the characters and how they change and develop (or don't) as they face not just those events but disasters natural and manmade. As a result there's much going on as there are not only multiple plotlines but ones that intersect, often in the most unexpected ways. Whatever else can be said then, this miniseries is definitely not lacking in incident.

Across more than six hours, Noble House lays out a tale filled with business dealings, murder, romance, intrigues and much more. It is carried by its performances and a fascinating portrait of late 1980s Hong Kong and the people who inhabit it (despite some clichd writing and performances). If nothing else, Noble House is a sprawling epic that makes for fascinating viewing a quarter century on.",1364083200,4,4333,4.78475935828877

3086877,4,B0012E2F60,"I still remember looking forward anxiously to seeing this miniseries when it first aired -- I had considered ""Noble House"" James Clavell's masterpiece, even greater than ""Shogun."" I had come away from reading the book with the sense of knowing the characters as if they were real people, and missing them when the book was finished.

In some cases, the characterizations in the miniseries hit the mark. Pierce Brosnan does an excellent job as the supremely self-confident Ian Dunross, John Rhys-Davies gives a truly inspired performance of charming villainy as Quillan Gornt, Burt Kwouk is very convincing as the compradore of the Noble House, and Gordon Jackson did a fine turn as the committed, conflicted Superintendent Armstrong. I also thought Julia Nickson Soul really heated up the screen; she was much better than a young Tia Carrere (in her pre-""Wayne's World"" days).

Unfortunately, I thought the American performances were weak. Deborah Raffin was OK as K.C. Tcholok, but I would have preferred it if they had stuck to the story and not had her wind up romantically involved with Ian Dunross. The weakest in my opinion, though, was Ben Masters as Linc Bartlett. While Mr. Masters may be a good actor, I didn't think he carried this role off very well. In the book, Bartlett is a cool, calculating, and yet personable man who comes across as opportunistic but respectful of Hong Kong business and cultural traditions. Clavell wrote him as a friendly, likable man who moves easily into the circles of power in the Colony but who is an unknown, unpredictable quantity to all of the vying factions. I thought that Mr. Masters overplayed the part as too cocky, too brash, and too shallow to be a likable or sympathetic figure. In the novel, I thought Bartlett was an intriguing character on a par with Dunross. In the miniseries, I generally thought he was just a jerk.

That aside, while the miniseries has to trim a lot of the interesting sub-plots in the interest of time, it does a good job of remaining true to the spirit of Clavell's novel. I'd agree with the observation that you should watch the miniseries, then read the novel to see what the story was REALLY about.",1328832000,3,2181,4.82620320855615
3086878,4,B0012E2F60,"A mix of Rio, New York, London and Shanghai, plus much more, Hong Kong is intense, but it has a mystical side. I'll never forget the approach to Kai Tak airport after midnight. Flying perilously close to rooftops as skyscrapers, colored lights and Victoria Peak glanced off the darkness of Hong Kong harbor, I first met Colonial Hong Kong in the same era depicted in this show.

The milieu of late 1980s Hong Kong is beautifully captured in Noble House, a story that shaped my original perception of Hong Kong as much it reflected, and exaggerated, the actual city. How much of the story is based on fact is impossible for me to say, but the thinly veiled story of Jardine Matheson and the Keswick family rings true in many ways--the fragile state of British rule and business interests, Jardine's shadowy past, its vast connections and modern-era ethos--all thriving in a land where luck and fortune are seen as inseparable and fengshui is believed.

I remember it as a world very foreign to most Westerners, a place where an 80s corporate raider like Linc Bartlett (a part delightfully nailed by Ben Masters) would find himself both at home and awkwardly, sometimes hilariously lost. There are plenty of in-jokes of this kind, too. Pierce Brosnan plays a fine, steel-edged Ian Dunross, although I wish director Gary Nelson had asked for more spontaneity and sketched a less innocent agenda with Casey Tcholok, who had after all just tried to roll Ian Dunross for his empire before he professed his feelings. John Rhys-Davies plays a thoroughly sleazy, but at times sympathetic, Quillian Gornt, and kudos to him for it, while Julia Nickson-Soul sparkles as the Eurasian bombshell Orlanda. Of all the actors, Nickson-Soul explores the most transformation and depth.

Where the mini-series has less depth is in characters like Four Finger Wu, who is great fun but little more than an archetype, and stock henchmen who play the role of fool; the plot gets cheesy in some of these areas. The mini-series also falls short in a few details, such as moments when actors sounds as if they're reading lines--a line might stop in mid-sentence because it's written that way, but it comes off as awkward. Some of the music is discordant, too.

Overall, though? Noble House is a delightful romp through the culture of a unique city. It matches up with my own memories of Fragrant Harbor, so much so it's uncanny, even though with the benefit of experience and hindsight those memories seem more like dreams now.

3086881,5,B0012E2F60,"I recently reviewed Noble House, having remembered that I liked it the first go around. What a treat! This is a TV miniseries at it's very finest. Pierce Brosnan, very young pre-Bond but perhaps more mature then than now, plays Ian Dunross, Supreme Leader of Struan's, a company with a history in Hong Kong. Hong Kong in the eighties is an intersection of Mainland China and Britain, American Capitalism and Chinese Tradition.

This is the authentic Hong Kong. My father bought me this DVD after a trip to the city in question, and most of the outdoor scenes in this movie are filmed in places I visited after a long flight from America. In a way, it's part travel guide. NCIS states it's setting is Norfolk, but the settings look nowhere like Norfolk. It's refreshing to see a TV series that didn't chicken out in terms of filming in authentic areas. Hong Kong is quite a city, and it's impression on the plot is quite essential.  The authenticity comes in handy, to the point where my jaw simply dropped watching settings I had seen with my own eyes face disaster in the context of the movie. There's nothing low budget about any of the proceedings on this DVD, a landslide and a grease fire that eventually overtakes a floating barge are filmed with intensity and ingenuity.  Which is surprising, as most of this movie is an adult mercantile drama.

Brosnan is very refined here. You can tell he was having fun on his trip to Hong Kong, and the script demands a greater emotional range than you'd get in say Bond or Mrs. Doubtfire.  He shouts, he threatens, he mourns.  Some of it is not entirely convincing, especially in the movie's more intense moments, but he's smoother than Bond as he reclines in his yacht and explains the context of Hong Kong's traditions. It's very satisfying to watch Brosnan work in this movie.

Also standing out is John-Rhys Davies. What a heavy! As rival mogul, he's out to destroy Dunross' company, but in the face of disasters he ends up becoming more of an anti-hero. One character overtly explains that there's a sort of yin-yang balancing act of power going on between the two. Some may say that Davies' character gets off easy. He does some truly despicable things in the context of the movie, such as a (mock?) attempted rape, but Davies also plays him with some noble features as well. Watch how cool he is as a fire is consuming things around him. Watch how the pair's problems are resolved. I for one appreciated a fully realized antagonist, and a story well-bred enough to let him go a little bit worse for wear but alive and fighting in the end.

There are lots of themes flying around. One is Joss, that actions influence one's fate in the future. Part of the movie is an examination of how capitalism and chinese tradition have intersected in Hong Kong. There's almost a confucian message about discipline and benevolence in work. Most of the morally lacking characters end up dead or financially weakened, the hard workers with respect stay alive and make some money.  But there's also something of a Taoist message: Everyone has a place in the scheme of things, and very few things have changed in terms of the playing field by the end of the movie. In the light of the financial bailout in the US, here you have a story that is VERY sympathetic to a bail-out philosophy.

Having watched this a second time, I could not turn this series off. A trip to Hong Kong from where I live would cost about 1700$ when all was said and done, but here you have a 15 dollar DVD that can act as a sort of proxy trip to the orient. It's a trip well worth taking.",1319932800,3,3597,4.537037037037037

3086910,5,B0012E2F60,"Noble House by James Clavell

We are fans of James Clavell and have enjoyed reading and then seeing both Shogun and now Noble House. Born on October 10th, 1924 under the name of Charles Edmund Dumaresq Clavell, the writer has such eloquent style that reading his works is like living his adventures.

Clavell is the son of a British Royal Navy officer who was stationed in Australia. At the age of 16, he joined the Royal Artillery and was sent to Malaya to fight the Japanese, was captured and sent to a Japanese prisoner of war camp on Java, later transferred to Changi Prison in Singapore. Clavell went through great distress while a prisoner of war in the hands of the Japanese, therefore, when we read his works, we read from the perspective of a man that has lived experiences that have provided depth of humanity in ways unknown to most of us.
With Noble House, he achieves a rare look into the Hong Kong prior to China's regaining this financial power. It is the story of greed, of power plays, of market intervention similar to what we see today... great men playing games to forward their interests at the expense of the common investor who has no clue his / her money is being manipulated by market forces.

The cast of characters is superb, starting with Pierce Brosnan as Ian Dunross, Deborah Raffin as Casey Tcholok, the business woman who travels with Ben Masters as Linc Barlett to raid the Noble House and take over its power. She is magnificent and there is a scene where a restaurant is on fire, all about to perish and to save their lives they must jump into the water. Well, she does not jump but dives with such grace and elegance that the scene steals the show... and Ian Dunross's heart. As in Shogun, John Rhys Davies as Quillan Gornt, delivers a masterful performance, teaching us much about the orient. Denholm Elliott plays Alastair Struan, John Houseman as Sir Geoffrey Allison provides a superb cameo appearance. Tia Carrere as Venus Poon is beautiful as always, dresses with such style that we are left spell-bound. Nancy Kwan plays Claudia Chen. Remember Cato from the Pink Panther? Well, actor Burt Kwouk now plays Phillip Chen, who is part of the board of directors of Noble House but has a son who betrays the firm. Lisa Lu is Ah Tam, Dudley Sutton is Commissioner Crosse and a powerful performance as usual is delivered by Khigh Dhiegh as Four Finger Wu, a businessman who has made his fortune in the traffic of opium. The roles they play are well explained and you will go from one hour show to the next with great desire to see how the story develops. There is mystery, murder, abduction, ransom, sex, romance and great intrigue.

Pierce Brosnan delivers a great performance in the role of business tycoon Ian Dunross, who can be fierce and dispassionate, but has a heart and a passion that from the outset, he steals the show.

The series starts with Pierce Brosnan becoming the Tai-Pan or CEO of Noble House. The term is a Cantonese expression that signifies that who holds the title is supreme leader, a tradition that has been followed for over a century. Next we understand the importance of profitability, become aware of a kidnapped son of a member of the board of directors, meet Werewolf, and appreciate the meaning of broken coins that if matched, make the Tai-Pan have to grant whatever favor is asked for the return of the other half of each coin.

Quillan Gornt, played by Rhys Davies is the enemy of Noble House, wanting to take control of the company at all costs, even at the destruction of the firm and he agrees to sell the shares he holds to bring the market down, taking away the value of Noble House.

If you want to learn about Hong Kong, about how power games are played and love intrigue... this is the series for you. Too good to miss!!!",1231977600,2,3800,4.579411764705882

3086927,5,B0012E2F60,This is probably the best mini series ever produced.  It's a high budget movie that was divided into several weeks.  It's the story of high finance in pre-China Hong Kong and has some of everything from action to intrigue.,1213315200,,222,4.666666666666667
3086928,5,B0012E2F60,"The book has been condensed into a very worthwhile dvd.

Dunross always faced one issue, the melding of British Hong Kong and China, and this is the background for the struggle for who will control Struan's, the Noble House of British Hong Kong - their historical Hong Kong rival, Gornt, or an American raider who will try to play both ends against the middle - his middle.

The cinematography is tremendous, and the acting is always good, and usually better than people might expect.

Julia Nicksun played Orlanda Ramos, the Eurasian beauty who would have been the Angelina Jolie of Hong Kong 1963. She is picture perfect.

Brosnan, the Tai-Pan of the Noble House, wins, in part, because he thinks in terms of a broader picture than the Americans, one of whom is portrayed as a clownish upstart who only has money...

It isn't enough.

The people who rule Hong Kong focus on the transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997; this is a quiet reminder that countries that think, and act, in terms of centuries, tend to do better than those who don't.

Buy this, whether for the subtle conflicts between the beautiful Deborah Raffin and Julia Nicksun, or to see, in part, how the men who rule the world think about the world, and then act.",1213142400,,1231,4.593607305936073

about the series, it is a real good drama of politics in hong kong at the time and pierce does a real got job as taipan. the inital reels are a bit boring as it takes its on sweet time to develop but once you are through that phase it is a memorable series for keeps.",1210723200,,696,3.8402777777777777

3086933,4,B0012E2F60,"I learned a long time ago not to expect faithful adaptations of great books, but to hope instead for a solid script, casting, cinematography and scoring that stands on its own.  With Clavell's hand in this work I was pleasantly surprised at the outcome here.  I have read the book many times and looked forward to this DVD release, not having ever seen the original airing on network TV.  It would not be possible to capture the intricate story lines, complex character development, agendas, and side plots in a mini-series.  The creators instead gave us the essence of the story (with some twists) and captured an interesting time in the history of Hong Kong, on the eve of the transfer of ownership back to China.

It is dated only in that it is a Euro-centric perspective in the film, and misses out entirely on the perspective of many of the Chinese characters, which was articulated well in the book and resonates today.

Repeat readers of the book - keep an open mind, do not expect a replica of the book, enjoy the actors and the music score and you won't be disappointed.  If you haven't read the book, you will enjoy doing so after viewing this title.",1210032000,,1160,4.57487922705314

3086939,5,B0012E2F60,"A Wonderful Mini Series. From the opening sequence it had me hooked, the style and mystique of the Orient. Set in Hong Kong, where east meets west, ancient traditions collide with super wealth and power. Pierce Brosnan as Taipan of the Noble house. The Taipan, the leader of the great chouse and company, Stuans. Involved in shipping it seems, bit hard to workout what exactly they do apart from make money. And make money they do. Hand over fist it appears. Ian Dunross (Pierce Brosnan) is ripe to be raided by the ugly American from Parcom. Ad to the mix the evil rival magnate Quinlan Gornt (John Rhys-Davies) and we are plunged into the seedy world of counter espinonage and the criminal underworld. As The Tipan and Gornt fight it out over a tense week fighting each other on the stock exchange and forcing great sums of money to change hands, ruining small banks in the process. All just to save face. The Noble House is a grant romp through the 80's when greed and power were wonderful. It is full of wonderfully memorable catch phrases and cliches, The Noble House of Chen, Number One Son Chen, Taipan, Joss (luck), The Old Hag, and the list goes on. I would have liked to have seen a few extras on the DVD. The apartment building collapse towards the climax is great to see in clear slow motion. However the aftermarth is a bit far fetched, knowing what we do now, with the likes of Threadbo, and The Twin Towers. A grand story, well told and well made.",1209081600,2,1462,4.5
3086940,4,B0012E2F60,"There are a few issues here with Amazon and the DVD. I almost listened to someone who said it had scenes deleted, but I went back to look at the discs. Upon first glance, you might assume it is only 3 hours of 4.5 hours long, if you assumed one episode was on one disc and one was on another. The runtime is accurate within a few minutes. The VHS copies I have had all ran about 6 hours, save one version that missed the whole last two hours. This is close to the 376 minutes stated. WooHoo!
Everything seems to be here.
However, I need to look at my VHS versions. I got a little hinky when I saw that the 1988 movie was in 16x9. It may very well have been filmed in 35mm. Not sure there. If you look at the opening credits, you will see the stars in the coin, but the top of the coin looks lopped off. I am getting they cropped 1.33-1 down to 1.66-1, or something like that.

The runtime on IMDB is 355 minutes. Originally it showed 8 hours, but the people who input the data do not always take commercials into consideration, and on some DVD sets they do not think that the opening and closing credits might show up less often than after each episode.

I am not as happy with cropped 16x9, as my player can stretch the film to the proportions I want. That said, I still feel terribly happy this made it to DVD finally, having been pulled out of the maelstrom in the toilet of pre-DVD Age Mini-series.

Last thing, which has to do with Amazon. Like, guys! I have about a dozen movies that you were supposed to email me about when they were available. Dudes, take note. This is the third of the twelve that has come out and I received doodly squat from you in the way of a warning. I would have ordered this weeks ago if y'all were on your toes. Good thing I randomly check things out. I would hate to miss it and have to pay your marketplace scalpers 200 for a copy. Can you dig it, Amazon? I knew that you could.

3086963,4,B0012E2F60,"For some reason, the DVD producers have decided to make this into a ""widescreen"" presentation.  But this is not a widescreen film.  It is a t.v. movie made in 1988.  It was shot at an aspect ratio of 1.33 to 1 (a perfect fit for your standard t.v. screen).  The result of the modification is that you see LESS of the image.  They simply cropped off the top and bottoms of the picture.  You can see that this is NOT how ""Noble House"" was meant to be seen at the very beginning:  the credits feature medallions of the actors faces along with their names, and the tops of the medals (and the tops of the actors' heads) are CUT OFF.  Also, now, several shots look crowded.

That aside, everything else is great.  The image (what's left of it) is sharp and clear.  The story remains fascinating and the acting top notch.  It's a great tale of international intrigue and finance.  (And, oh, those 80s fashions!)",1207612800,3,905,4.412121212121212
3086964,5,B0012E2F60,"I would definitely suggest that ""Noble House"" certainly surpasses its
original literary text. It was a very long novel and at times it felt tiring to read through all of the subplots and to go into detail about minor characters. I started to read the novel first but kept postponing to
continue with it, yet when I finally saw the mini-series I was completely
captivated and watched the first five hours in one night.

Besides the additions and changes which enhanced the story to a
better level, I loved the cinematography of the scenes, particularly those
of Pierce (the use of panning and tracking shots in camera movement
seemed to gracefully glide with Ian which is symbolic of his character).
The musical themes were especially self-reflexive in the cinematic
medium; I loved how it depicted the grandeur of the role of Tai-pan of
the Noble House as well as the romance of the setting and the couples.

Love the cliffhangers at the end of each episode, they always leave you
wanting to know what will happen next.  In terms of storytelling, the
main and subplots keep twisting and turning; either truly satisfying or
better than you would expect.  The trick is that sometimes the acting as
well as the cinematography work together to deceive the audience  i.e.
when there is a high angle shot of Ian's car driving through traffic, the
camera pulls back to reveal it is from Gornt's point of view, he smirks
which may imply he is involved with John's kidnapping.

A rather brilliant restoration for such an epic mini-series!  The visual quality is nearly flawless, sharper and more stunning than I had anticipated (especially to see Pierce's blue eyes).  The sound is great:  I love the grand Tai-pan theme playing on the main menu as well as
Casey's romantic theme played during the scene selection
menus.  Otherwise, the clarity of sound effects, voices, and
instruments is wonderful.  Although I would've preferred
moving images from the film on the main menu.  Anyway, the
mini-series is divided up into four episodes, two on each disc.

This is such a personal reward to me--I've been looking forward
to viewing this on DVD ever since I wrote the film analysis
article a few months back in honor of the 20th anniversary of its
broadcast on NBC.  It was my very first critique intended for
publication since I graduated from Rider University.  Actually,
I decided to write the analysis right after I realized there were
plans for this official release.  Perhaps it was joss after all!",1206921600,4,2493,4.830588235294118
3086965,4,B0012E2F60,"The ""Noble House"" miniseries is a very cool adaptation of the James Clavell novel of the same name.  The novel is complex and convoluted, and this miniseries actually does a stellar job of telling essentially the same story as the novel in a more linear fashion, which is essential to the miniseries medium.

Pierce Brosnan, head of the Struan Clan and Tai-Pan of the Noble House, sets the standard for being suave and sophisticated--his portrayal of the Tai-Pan in my opinion is absolutely perfect.  John Rhys-Davies as Gornt, the descendant of Brock, the Struan Clan's ancient enemy, crude and barbaric but also sophisticated, makes a perfect contrast with the elegant Brosnan.  They seem like born adversaries.  (We all remember Davies as the Portuguese navigator in Shogun.)

This is a captivating miniseries.  Set in Hong Kong, it is the story of a Clan feud between two powerful British shipping firms there, both of which have been based in Hong Kong since its founding as a British Crown colony. In fact, ""Noble House"" is the sequel to ""Tai-Pan"" which is the story of the founding of Hong Kong and of the Noble House. The whole story is great fun, sort of a ""Dallas"" in a Hong Kong setting (this is not a put-down--I loved Dallas!)  The film manages to make the combat of high finance easy to follow and understand, and this is a fascinating story.

A 'super great' mini-series that once you begin to watch, you'll have a hard time walking away from it. When ever I go back to watch this over again, I'm there for the duration, all 6+ hours of it!

Although stating a 'widescreen' version in the description, I seriously hope that's not another 'typo' from amazon! One has to wonder, since this was originally a made for television mini-series, some years ago. It doesn't appear that any effort was made to remaster the sound, as the description only lists, 'English'. And not seeing any special features listed either, which would have been great!

Either way, it's still worth buying, even just to replace my VHS 3 tape collection, (which I will still keep anyway). It's just a really great movie, that's listed among my favorites.

And if you're going to get this great mini-series, for sure get Tai Pan as well! Although just a movie and not a series, it is actually the real beginning of Noble House. Tai Pan by itself is another great movie listing among my favorites!

I've got 'two' copies on order, and am anxious to find out if there really is a widescreen version available on the DVD's, if 'any' of the sound had been enhanced, or if it's in mono, then if 'any kind' of features were added. Guess I'll have to wait until I actually get them in my hand to find out.

UPDATE:

Well I finally received and watched my new DVD copy of Nobile House. I was surprised that it was in fact a widescreen version, even though it was originally a made for T.V. mini-series. However looking at the box, I noticed it stating `monaural', which greatly disappointed me!

Even kicking in the `Pro Logic' on my receiver, it didn't do anything for the sound quality. It was a deafening, distinct, straight from the center channel speaker, `mono'!

I switched my receiver over to the stereo mode, and it helped a bit... at least I had the sound coming out of my right and left surround speakers.

It's a shame that the studio didn't want to invest the money into enhancing the sound to a true 5:1. It would have made for the prefect all around DVD.

Curious about something... I'm going to have to dig out my VHS tapes, and see if the sound was stereo on those...

Of course I could have done without all the introductions at the beginning of each chapter, and the scrolling credits at the end of each chapter.

But for sure, still worth watching, as it's a great movie!",1205798400,4,2516,4.46943231441048
3086988,5,B0012E2F60,"I was born and raised in Hong Kong until I was 16 years old.  I didn't read the book by James Clavell but the mini-series certainly brought back nostalgia from my formative years.  The distinction rating given to this series is based on the accurate and uncompromising portray of Hong Kong during the last few years prior to 1997 -- the repatriation to China from being a British colony.  There is a write-up on Wikipedia [...] that detailed the story behind Noble House.  It is based on Jardine Matheson who founded the Jardine Matheson Trading Company which conducted trades between India, China, and the U.K..  As an amateur history enthusiast, I really appreciate how Clavell captures the sentiment of the natives as well as the foreign counterparts greed to financial gains under those convoluted political systems.
To most people who grew up in the West, Noble House gives you a realistic snapshot of the history of Hong Kong during the 1980s.  The entire production was shot in Hong Kong, Macau (Macao), and part of China.  My only regret is that the producer did not spend the time to teach the actors the proper Chinese dialect (Cantonese) which resulted in utter nonsense to those who spoke the language.  This particular lack of details has always been overlooked in most  American film productions in which I deem very disrespectful.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend this mini-saga to those who would enjoy an intriguing suspenseful drama situated in the Orient in the late 20th century.

3086990,5,B0012E2F60,"James Clavell was a WONDERFUL Writer (yes, with a capital W) and NOBLE HOUSE was a gift he left to us!

Through his eyes we visit Hong Kong in the 1970's. Clavell, a virtuoso connoisseur of the human condition, manages to interweave a multitude of stories into a continuous carpet of a city living fast, taking risks, winning and loosing but never giving up.
Heads of huge conglomerates on the verge of foundering - yet never letting go of their rival's throat; dirt-poor Chinese maids striking it rich by a sudden turn of their joss; photographer-Wo and his trophy collection; drug-running smugglers asking for favors-you-can't-refuse; cold war spy networks riddled with double and triple agents; an American stock-market runner trying his hand in raiding Hong Kong companies; ladies getting ""pillowed"", men getting wooed, fortunes made and lost in the 10 days these all take place. Will the Noble House survive?

To quote Balzac, behind every great fortune lies crime. To prove him right, Noble House is but a thinly veiled reference to Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd, a real company. Anticlimactically for an historic British company operating in China, it is nowadays incorporated in Bermuda - and trying to forget its opium-running past (like so many City of London companies respectable today yet founded on drugs, dead cockneys and destroyed natives).

All these stories were presented masterfully in the original novel, without ever loosing the reader's interest or dropping the ball of building tension. There were less than a dozen writers who could do this - starting with Homer. My copy was so worn I had to replace it.

Now, this is a 1988 TV mini series based on the book - of comparable merit. Until recently, the mini-series were available only on VHS. The major casting was excellent (having suave Pierce Brosnan and beastly John Rhys-Davies go head-to-head was a stroke of genius). The rest of the cast was a mix of hit-or-miss: a really young Tia Carrere as mealy-mouth Venus Poon was a hit; Julia Nickson-Soul as the Eurasian beauty Orlanda Ramos a miss.  All in all, a truly beautiful production, yet, although it run for 6 hours total, it barely painted a broad-stroke picture of the complex story-lines.

Thus, in order to fully appreciate this masterpiece, my advice is to first read the book and only THEN watch the TV mini series.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1205452800,4,2376,4.984848484848484
3086991,5,B0012E2F60,"I first saw this on VHS Video Tape in 1989-1990.
Absolutely first class production values, brilliant setting, fantastic lead cast - while Pierce Brosnan is as debonair as ever as Ian Dun Ross ( even if he is rather ruthless in this particular manifestation), John Rhys Davies is the perfect foil as the slightly crude Quillan Gornt!

As usual - fast paced business, jet setting action, classy and glamorous. The colonial backdrop,first class plot, exotic locales, great photoplay etc contribute along with the typical trappings of the International Business Tycoon, to make this an extremely watchable and enjoyable Series.

Indeed, while ""Remington Steele"" may have set the stage to catapult Pierce Brosnan into becoming James Bond, his cold, clinical character portrayal of Ian Dun Ross in Noble House, cemented it (in my opinion.)

Absolutely watch-able - Eminently collect-able and highly desirable as an addition to one's home DVD collection, which is why I ve just PRE-ORDERED it via Amazon! I cant wait to watch it again!!

3086992,5,B0012E2F60,"Having all of Clavell's books, I revel in the movies made from his writings. He earlier brought SHOGUN to the screen, and for 4 nights in February, 1988, he aired the last show he produced. Starting on Sunday February 21st through Wednesday, February 24th, NOBLE HOUSE fought for ratings against the 1988 Winter Olympics taking place on another TV channel. For true fans of the late Clavell we miss new books coming off the presses. I lived in Japan for 25 months so SHOGUN has to be my favorite, with NOBLE HOUSE and TAI-PAN only an eyelash close seconds.

Starting with TAI-PAN in 1841 this epic of the trading house Dirk Struan founded is brought up to date, 1963.  The entire action of the 1200+ novel takes place in little more than one week. As in TAI-PAN the struggle between the two trading houses of Struan and Brock continues.

The script of NOBLE HOUSE is well written, with the action moving swiftly along. The mix of characters provides a veteran group, and since a deal for Pierce Brosnan to star in a James Bond movie had fallen through, he was available for one of his last TV appearances. He stated at the time of filming of NOBLE HOUSE that he was going to move away from both stage and TV, wanting to make movies. He and John Rhys-Davies had worked together previously. With relaxed conditions on the sets, all went well with this production.

The TV movie has,however, come under some complaint from both viewers and critics alike, but for me the movies made from James Clavell's books are lasting gifts given us from the author. The reviewer from TV Guide at the time, Don Merrill, ""kicked the stuffings out of this miniseries"" saying NOBLE HOUSE ""furnished with just about everything a melodrama could possibly contain-except characters that come to life"". Obviously he was no fan of Clavell's writings and possibly he had not read TAI-PAN. It is quite possible to watch this movie without having read either of the two books, but what a knowledge gained from these two books will provide is not only an understanding of this long standing feud to the death between these two houses but also some understanding of just what drives the personalites themselves, persons always concerned with their families' tradition going back into the mid 1840's, love as well as hate. It's not so much money or greed driving these folks, but just plain cold hatred. They want to destroy each other.

In the second night's drama the fire aboard the floating restaurant happens, and even Don Merrill of TV Guide termed that ""a dilly of a fire'. So too the horse race, and many other activities of this movie as well.

What a great mini-series. Long live NOBLE HOUSE and TAI-PAN.

3086993,5,B0012E2F60,"Noble House is an eight-hour Classic TV Miniseries produced and broadcast in 1988 by NBC. Based on the fantastic and richly detailed novel of the same name by James Clavell, it features a large cast headlined by Pierce Brosnan, who portrays business tycoon Ian Dunross.

This was NBC's second Classic TV Miniseries adaptation of a Clavell novel, the first was 1980s Shogun. Both take place in the same fictional universe, Noble House even featuring connections to Shogun and yet another Clavell novel, Tai-Pan.

For this miniseries, the timeframe of the original novel was changed from the early 1960s to the 1980s.

Other actors include Denholm Elliott, Deborah Raffin, Tia Carrere, John Houseman, Julia Nickson-Soul, and John Rhys-Davies (who also appeared in Shogun.)

Noble House centers around big-business piracy in Hong Kong. The miniseries opens with Brosnan driving through the rain to meet Denholm Elliott, who plays the outgoing ""tai-pan"" in Hong Kong's oldest and leading trading firm: Struan & Company.

""Tai-pan,"" a Cantonese expression, means ""supreme leader,"" and at Struan & Company the title has been passed down at least 150 years

Dunross' arch rival and enemy, Quillan Gornt (Rhys-Davles), is tai-pan of the second leading trading company. Not only does Gornt wants to destroy Dunross and take over Noble House, the two men have racing horses that compete against each other as well.

Meanwhile, two American tycoons (Raffin and Ben Masters) have come to Hong Kong to make a financial deal with Dunross.

But in Clavell's Hong Kong there is no such thing as a single deal. Double-dealing and triple-crossing are more the style of the international wheeler-dealers here.

Diverse players here include bankers, government officials, police and a man called ""Four Finger Wu"" (Khigh Dhiegh), who runs an opium-smuggling syndicate from a junk boat in Aberdeen Harbor and has a mistress one-third his age named Venus Poon (Carrere).

The eight hours practically sizzle, thanks to Bercovici's articulate script (he also wrote the script for the Shogun miniseries).

Viewers a treated to a manipulated run on a bank, selling short on the stock market, the fixing of horse races, a kidnaping, seductions and murders. Running counterpoint are the burning and sinking of a floating restaurant and a catastrophic landslide.

Add to this a couple of juicy love stories, especially the one between Brosnan and Raffin (who brings a light comic element to her role as the tough wheeler-dealer), while everything is done in ravishing cars, speedboats, mansions and casinos.

But, the biggest and brightest star of the show is clearly Hong Kong, which is more like a video game than a city, filled with the exotica and intrigue that you used to find in old movies. Early in the show, a character who's just landed at the airport asks, ""What's that smell?"" His host answers, ""That's the smell of money.""

The $16-million-plus production included eight weeks of exteriors shot in Hong Kong and another eight for interiors in the De Laurentiis studio in Wilmington, N.C.

Hong Kong at this time was still British and ""business"" ruled the daily lives of the British and European company executives as well as the Chinese businessman and worker. One of my favorite movies, it tells the story of the ""Noble House"" and Ian Dunross. The Noble House is loosely based on the real trading company of Jardine Mathewson, one of the early trading companies that helped found Hong Kong. (who has since moved to Singapore when Hong Kong reverted back to the Chinese). Plot twists and fortunes made and lost plus romance and danger make this well worth watching.

For at least four years, we have been seeking the DVD version of Nobel House. Our VHS copy is old, fuzzy, and getting discolored. For a change of pace, there is nothing like being transported to the Orient on a designated Sunday and allowing yourself to be enchanted by Pierce Brosnan at his best.

The movie does perfect justice to the book - no corners are cut and the spirit and letter of the book are kept almost religiously. After all, Clavell himself took part in creating the series.

A young and talented Pierce Brosnan plays a quite real Dunross while being supported by a solid cast of experienced heavyweights showing off their superb acting in a romantic yet accurate Hong-Kong of the 60-70s.

3087009,5,B0012E2F60,"Having spent time in Hong Kong in the late 60's and early 70's, I found this mini-series to be extremely entertaining and accurate in the way the characters are developed. Hong Kong at this time was still British and ""business"" ruled the daily lives of the British and European company executives as well as the Chinese businessman and worker. One of my favorite movies, it tells the story of the ""Noble House"" and Ian Dunross. The Noble House is loosely based on the real trading company of Jardine Mathewson, one of the early trading companies that helped found Hong Kong. (who has since moved to Singapour when Hong Kong reverted back to the Chinese). Plot twists and fortunes made and lost plus romance and danger make this well worth watching.

3321050,5,B0012E2F60,"This is one of the best TV miniseries ever made! It is quite difficult to portray the essence of a GREAT book on TV, and perhaps the fact that James Clavell (author of the 2 Volume book) took an active roll when making this movie helped a lot in its success.
Since Shogun, James Clavell became known as one of the best writers of all time. It all started with Tai-Pan, in the 19th Century with the birth of a commercial company which later became known as ""The Noble House"". In this new episode, James Clavell takes back the story to the ""present day: 1980's(in the book is the 1960's) and portrays one of the most thrilling and vivid stories ever made.
Hong Kong serves as a scenery to this non-stop drama story where everything happens so fast, with the most realistic environment and characters...the Honor and survival of the Noble House is at a stake once again. The ""old"" friends, the enemies, China, even the most insignificant habitant of Hong Kong will affect the future of things to come in an unexpected way.
An excellent cast for an excellent film.

That James Clavell is a master story teller is not in doubt, but his work, the Noble House must rank as the finest of his works, the pinnacle of his art. Noble house has to be the best of his six books on the Asian Saga - (others include - King Rat, Tai-Pan, Shogun, Gai-Jin and whirlwind)  The book was great and the mini-series did not disappoint

 A young Pierce Brosnan was convincing as the new Tai-Pan Ian Dunross. There are so many intricately woven story lines which beautifully come together in the end to enable you have a full picture of what is happening. Loyalties are tested to the hilt and the strength of will and character called to question.

3321145,5,B0012E2F60,"When this aired back in 1988, I recorded it on the new-fangled VCR we had just gotten. The miniseries aired over four nights and was based on the novel by James Clavell, who also wrote Shogun and Tai Pan. Noble House starred a young, handsome Pierce Brosnan as Ian Dunross, the current ""Tai Pan"" (Supreme Leader) of Struan & Company, an old and storied Hong Kong-based firm also known at The Noble House.

There's a lot the current Tai Pan needs to deal with. He has a potential takeover on his plate at the hands of an American Company named Par-Con, he has to deal with granting ancient ""favors"" to the bearer of special coins, kidnapping, horse racing, business rivals, Chinese spies and on and on and on. The fun never seems to end.

For many years, I would, on occasion, pull out the VHS tapes and play the series, commercials and all (those were kind of fun to watch, honestly) and then in the 2000s, I was considering throwing out the deteriorating tapes but then someone gave me their old Magnavox VHS/DVD writer combo and I got the bright idea to finally transfer the tapes onto DVD. That was okay but the quality was as poor as the source tapes. About a year ago, I watched the DVD and knew it was time to let it go - into the rubbish it went. Then I looked on Amazon just on a lark and there it was. It had been out for a while, in fact, so of course I purchased it and I'm still doing the happy dance. I wish I had known about the DVD sooner.

Personally, I love the fact that it takes place in the 1980s as opposed to the 1960s backdrop in which the book was written. But since it was only a 20ish-year difference, it still worked.

The cast included other notable names such as John Houseman, John Rhys-Davies (I think he was in the Harry Potter films recently), Ben Masters, Deborah Raffin, Julia Nickson, Tia Carrere and my favorite villain actor of all time  Khigh Dhiegh  who played the evil Wo Fat in the original Hawaii Five-O series and Four Finger Wu in Noble House. But an even bigger villain than Four Finger Wu is Quillan Gornt (played excellently by John Rhys-Davies), the Tai Pan of the Rothwell-Gornt, the sworn enemy of the Noble House.

When I first viewed this in the 1980s, it was a drama. But when I view it now almost 30 years later, there's a campiness to it from perhaps the passage of time. There are some very funny scenes that feature Four Finger Wu and his young Mistress, Venus Poon (Tia Carrere), and her little rat dog. There are also some overly melodramatic scenes between Lincoln Bartlett (Ben Masters) and Orlanda Ramos (Julia Nickson) that make me cringe when I view them in modern times  seriously cringe-worthy from a female perspective. Thank heavens for Casey Tcholok (Debra Raffin) for portraying a woman with some power and a mind of her own.

The really interesting thing about this series is the portrayal of life in Hong Kong under British rule before it was turned back to the Chinese. That the country would return to Chinese rule in less than a decade is also mentioned a couple of times as it was paramount in the minds of business leaders from the U.K. and in the case of this series, the U.S. (Par-Con).

The series managed to balance the many converging story lines that were going on simultaneously (though they all were connected in multiple ways). James Clavell didn't write the script. The book was adapted by screenwriter, Eric Bercovici, who also wrote many episodes of the original Hawaii Five-O series, the miniseries, Shogun and one of my favorite films, A Change of Habit, starring Mary Tyler Moore and Elvis Presley.

Just remember, this originally aired in the ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"" era and it has that feel to it in abundance. The main thing is that despite some goofy 80s moments, this film holds up over time. And that's good writing.",1447804800,2,3827,4.507936507936508

There's a couple of scenes that I remember being slightly different, but that may be editing trims or just fading memory.  Either way, they didn't take away from the overall story.

3321222,5,B0012E2F60,"We have the VHS copy of Noble House as well as James Clavell's entire series of six books he wrote on this general subject beginning with Shogun.  It is outstanding in every way.

There are some details left out of the VHS, e.g. the episode with the doctor and the anti-biotics necessary because of the floating restaurant fire which required that they all dive into the harbor waters which were reportedly very polluted.  A tangential reference to this was made to this by a single line in the hotel scene but it passed almost too quickly to be understood, if one had not read the book.  There was also a section involving some thugs attacking them out on one of the harbor island beaches near Macao.  That was a gunfight scene which was exciting.  In the book Ian's wife is very much alive, though not a notable character.  The VHS indicates that she had passed away some eight years before Deborah Raffin came on the scene as part of PAR-CON.  As far as the VHS production is concerned, this alteration hurts nothing and in fact makes the entire relationship between Brosnan and Raffin much more effective.  And, too, there was a rather thorough investigation into the death of the jockey riding North Star, the Noble House's horse, in the big race scene.  That omission bypassed some important details.

One of the very strong points about this production is that all of the supporting roles are played by first-class actors and actresses.  One of those roles, Quillan Gornt, played by John Rhys-Davies, could almost qualify as a second principal role to Brosnan's Ian Dunross, since he plays it so well.  Be that as it may, the VHS is quite successful in all of its special effects, the collapse of the tall apartment building among others.  One wishes that the DVD might be produced which will include the complete miniseries, since there is no reason to truncate it as it apparently has been.",1431907200,,1899,4.697885196374623

Some of the epic scenes of the book are really very well shot and depicted; and it is hard to see how they pulled off the cinematography before the advent of CGI.

Actors are well placed to matched the books characters; with the exception of the Casey character; the actress was older and not as strong of a character as what the book described. The Ian Dunross and Link Bartlett actors were very well depicted .",1415318400,,622,4.408695652173913

Of course, there is a bit of unbelievability in the 2 most powerful men in the business world scrabbling about in a fallen building, but when one realizes they're there only because an American power-broker may be in trouble & he's the key to a potential lock on the US market , one can see why they'd risk so much.

Great to see this excellent production in today's hi-def. Even better on DVD than on TV what with it lacking the every-9 minute show/3 min of commercials.

Just to show how bad TV has become, most nights, & esp for big events like the Superbowl, commercials out-air events. In the 2014 Winter Olympics. NBC had 5-6 min of 'action' followed by 5+ full min of commercials. We've learned.

A fascinating look at the ending years of British control of Hong Kong. I am sure it's no longer the same place under Red Chinese rule now. It must have been glorious. Well scripted and well acted and filmed (mostly) in the exotic Orient. My only complaint is how often Pierce Brosnan mumbles his script lines (not unlike many modern British actors who lack the training of an earlier generation of stage actors on screen. (Also a lot of location filmingnot just in this film seriesseems poorly miced to me with loud background sounds muffling the actors lines.)

This miniseries adjacent with the movie with Brian Brown called Taipan if not having the same writer are almost historically interconnected putting the two together in my head the stories where interconnected within the history of both the movie and the miniseries but haven't seen either of them in a long time I went on a search for them every couple of years to see if they came out on DVD and they finally did I bought both of them and was not disappointed with either one.

But if you're going to get both of them which I do recommend you have to remember the TV miniseries was filmed in the style of the TV miniseries of the time where this movie is more of a grander an epic scale Movie that takes place 100 or so years before

So if you're a fan of the grand TV miniseries of the 70s 80s and 90s and into the gritty looks into past centuries type of movies this is a movie for you.

3321340,4,B0012E2F60,"I loved the book, and had the film on a poor quality  SLP video  tape with no close captions.  When I saw the opportunity to buy the DVD I was delighted and not disappointed.  Although some viewers thought Pierce Brosnan was miscast due to his youth, and others thought him rather wooden I disagree and thought he really nailed it with an arrogant air of privilege combined with the ability to run the trading empire.  The Hong Kong location was just beautiful, the stunning homes and gardens, and the spectacular events, such as the floating restaurant fire, the typhoon, and the landslide  gave it the look of a theater film rather than TV.  I particularly enjoyed the insight of the dealings with Communist China  where both sides needed each other.  I was not aware that there was any contact between the two until I read the book, let alone a representative and branch of the bank of China in Hong Kong.

The reason for not awarding five stars was my disappointment in the espionage story which wa a major part of the book being cut, and the awful monochromatic set design which gave such a bleached look.  At times Deborah Raffin and several of the men disappeared into the furniture.  Ms. Raffin in particular would have looked far better in stronger colored clothing rather than white and beige, especially when in rooms decorated in various shades of white. beige and cream.  In one scene where she was seated on an off white sofa, she and Piece Brosnan were wearing white, the walls were a very pale  green tint, the carpet was pale beige, and as Ms. Raffin's hair was a dyed blonde, all that stood out was Brosnan's brown hair.  I found it very distracting.  Nor did I like Ms. Raffin's  pushy all American girl demeanor which compared with the quieter gentler oriental ladies, came across as brash, loud, and vulgar.  Perhaps that was intentional.  The Tai Pan was married in the book, but in the film they made him a widower so he could fall for Casey (Raffin).  Someone born and raised in Hong Kong and bound by strong family traditions would not have fallen for Casey.  They had nothing in common.

The espionage story was barely touched on in the film, which should have been a couple of hours longer to accommodate it.  for those who have not read the book, it was a classic double agent/triple agent spy thriller which added spice to an exotic location.  No one what what they seemed.  I thought of those old films with Marlene Dietrich as Shanghai Lily, Gale Sondegard in Shanghai Gesture,  Bette Davis as Mother Gin Sling,  the Orient Express, Macao, Casablanca and other taut thrillers set in foreign parts where no one showed their true face, no one could be trusted,  and I felt that the omission of the full extent of the espionage was detrimental to the film.

I would still recommend it to those who want a few hours of escapism, a trip to Hong Kong without the tiring journey, or to flesh out the book.",1373068800,,2929,4.578846153846154

3321348,3,B0012E2F60,"I was feeling nostalgic and purchased this and decided it would be a family event.  While many portions hold up more have not withstood the test of time.  The original novel was set in 1963, the mini series 1987, and watching it in 2013 makes several of the story lines banal.

Seeing Hong Kong post repatriation to China, youngsters cannot understand how afraid so many countries, businesses were afraid that Hong Kong would lose it's uniqueness.  With the amount of tourism, products and diplomatic ties that China now has the youngsters cannot understand how isolated and forbidden China was in the 1980s and before.

While watching I found it interesting that the theme song seemed to remind me of the television serial ""Dallas"", even the clothes and speech after awhile seemed to feel more like a soap opera than something that came from a rich detailed book.  I found it interesting that at the opening of a scene which takes place on Four Finger Wu's boat, the music was so dated that the kids began to discuss the music.

I have to say the part that saddened me the most is the stiffness of Pierce Brosnan as Ian Dunross.  At the age of 35 he was still too young to play such a seasoned character.  Watching the back of his head with the brown, I assume permed, brown waves was distracting.

As for the several romances that take place during the series, none of the couples seemed truly passionate.

I can say we enjoyed the movie, but it is not the big pageantry, I thought I remembered. It is definitely a mini series of it's time.

The series came on two disks, each disk had two episodes of the mini series.  The print was clear and came with subtitles.  There were no special features of any kind..",1365984000,,1712,4.534201954397394

3321350,4,B0012E2F60,"Produced and aired at the end of the 1980s, Noble House would be one of the last in a line of lengthy and epic miniseries. Based on James Clavell's thousand plus page novel (and move forward two decades in time to the then present day), Noble House features a wealth of location filming, dozens of characters and multiple plot lines across four parts and more than six hours of screen time. So how does it hold up a quarter of a century later?

The performances hold up well. Pierce Brosnan is fascinating as Ian Dunross, Tai-Pan of the Hong Kong company Struan's, the Noble House of the title. Brosnan is convincing as the man in charge of a 150 year old company who struggles to deal not just with the crises of today but with the weight of legacy of the Noble House upon his shoulders as well. While Dunross is not above perhaps less than savory at times, Brosnan nevertheless makes clear that is a likeable man with a strong sense of honor and duty no matter the cost. It is Brosnan as Dunross that ultimately ties in the various diverse plots together and, if his performance was anything less than what it is, I'm not sure Noble House would work as well as it does.

Moving on from Brosnan, there's a strong cast behind him. There's John Rhys-Davies as Quillan Gornt, the head of Struan's biggest rival and a man who seems to live for nothing but bringing it down. There's Deborah Raffin and Ben Masters as the heads of the American company Par-Con whose motives and actions are questionable throughout the entire miniseries. From there the cast of characters ranges from police Superintendent Robert Armstrong (Gordon Jackson) to Struan employees such as John Van Dreelen as Jacques DeVille, Michael Siberry as Linbar Struan and fellow Hong Kong businessmen such as Damien Thomas as Lando Mata.  Rounding off the cast in two cameo roles are Denholm Elliott as outgoing Tai-Pan Alastair Struan in the first part and John Houseman as Hong Kong governor Sir Geoffrey Allison in the last part.

Where the cast, and indeed both the writing and the miniseries as a whole, runs into trouble is with its native characters. The writing (and as a result the performances) mean that they are often walking and talking clichs, especially Khigh Dhiegh as Four Finger Wu and Tia Carrere as Venus Poon as well as the less savory characters who figure in its first half. Even characters such as Burt Kwouk's Phillip Chen, the compradore of Struan's, fall into moments of cringe worthy dialogue that undermine them considerably. Somehow it seems a shame that the script couldn't treat these characters with the same respect, though how much of that is down to the original source material I'm not sure.

Despite that problem, Noble House otherwise makes excellent use of Hong Kong itself throughout. In fact the city and its surrounding areas (including Macao) are as much as a player in events as Brosnan's Dunross or anyone else. The large amount of location filming gives the various storylines a strong sense of verisimilitude.

The miniseries is also blessed both with a large amount of screen time and a script that makes the most use of it. Based on the massive novel by James Clavell, Noble House makes the most use of its six plus hours and four parts. There's everything from business dealings ranging from a deal between the Noble House and Par-Con to Gornt's trying bankrupt the Noble House, kidnapping, murder, romances, concerns over Hong Kong's return to China (which was still a few years off when the miniseries was made) and international intrigues as well. Behind all that is the characters and how they change and develop (or don't) as they face not just those events but disasters natural and manmade. As a result there's much going on as there are not only multiple plotlines but ones that intersect, often in the most unexpected ways. Whatever else can be said then, this miniseries is definitely not lacking in incident.

Across more than six hours, Noble House lays out a tale filled with business dealings, murder, romance, intrigues and much more. It is carried by its performances and a fascinating portrait of late 1980s Hong Kong and the people who inhabit it (despite some clichd writing and performances). If nothing else, Noble House is a sprawling epic that makes for fascinating viewing a quarter century on.",1364083200,4,4333,4.78475935828877

3321374,4,B0012E2F60,"I still remember looking forward anxiously to seeing this miniseries when it first aired -- I had considered ""Noble House"" James Clavell's masterpiece, even greater than ""Shogun."" I had come away from reading the book with the sense of knowing the characters as if they were real people, and missing them when the book was finished.

In some cases, the characterizations in the miniseries hit the mark. Pierce Brosnan does an excellent job as the supremely self-confident Ian Dunross, John Rhys-Davies gives a truly inspired performance of charming villainy as Quillan Gornt, Burt Kwouk is very convincing as the compradore of the Noble House, and Gordon Jackson did a fine turn as the committed, conflicted Superintendent Armstrong. I also thought Julia Nickson Soul really heated up the screen; she was much better than a young Tia Carrere (in her pre-""Wayne's World"" days).

Unfortunately, I thought the American performances were weak. Deborah Raffin was OK as K.C. Tcholok, but I would have preferred it if they had stuck to the story and not had her wind up romantically involved with Ian Dunross. The weakest in my opinion, though, was Ben Masters as Linc Bartlett. While Mr. Masters may be a good actor, I didn't think he carried this role off very well. In the book, Bartlett is a cool, calculating, and yet personable man who comes across as opportunistic but respectful of Hong Kong business and cultural traditions. Clavell wrote him as a friendly, likable man who moves easily into the circles of power in the Colony but who is an unknown, unpredictable quantity to all of the vying factions. I thought that Mr. Masters overplayed the part as too cocky, too brash, and too shallow to be a likable or sympathetic figure. In the novel, I thought Bartlett was an intriguing character on a par with Dunross. In the miniseries, I generally thought he was just a jerk.

That aside, while the miniseries has to trim a lot of the interesting sub-plots in the interest of time, it does a good job of remaining true to the spirit of Clavell's novel. I'd agree with the observation that you should watch the miniseries, then read the novel to see what the story was REALLY about.",1328832000,3,2181,4.82620320855615
3321375,4,B0012E2F60,"A mix of Rio, New York, London and Shanghai, plus much more, Hong Kong is intense, but it has a mystical side. I'll never forget the approach to Kai Tak airport after midnight. Flying perilously close to rooftops as skyscrapers, colored lights and Victoria Peak glanced off the darkness of Hong Kong harbor, I first met Colonial Hong Kong in the same era depicted in this show.

The milieu of late 1980s Hong Kong is beautifully captured in Noble House, a story that shaped my original perception of Hong Kong as much it reflected, and exaggerated, the actual city. How much of the story is based on fact is impossible for me to say, but the thinly veiled story of Jardine Matheson and the Keswick family rings true in many ways--the fragile state of British rule and business interests, Jardine's shadowy past, its vast connections and modern-era ethos--all thriving in a land where luck and fortune are seen as inseparable and fengshui is believed.

I remember it as a world very foreign to most Westerners, a place where an 80s corporate raider like Linc Bartlett (a part delightfully nailed by Ben Masters) would find himself both at home and awkwardly, sometimes hilariously lost. There are plenty of in-jokes of this kind, too. Pierce Brosnan plays a fine, steel-edged Ian Dunross, although I wish director Gary Nelson had asked for more spontaneity and sketched a less innocent agenda with Casey Tcholok, who had after all just tried to roll Ian Dunross for his empire before he professed his feelings. John Rhys-Davies plays a thoroughly sleazy, but at times sympathetic, Quillian Gornt, and kudos to him for it, while Julia Nickson-Soul sparkles as the Eurasian bombshell Orlanda. Of all the actors, Nickson-Soul explores the most transformation and depth.

Where the mini-series has less depth is in characters like Four Finger Wu, who is great fun but little more than an archetype, and stock henchmen who play the role of fool; the plot gets cheesy in some of these areas. The mini-series also falls short in a few details, such as moments when actors sounds as if they're reading lines--a line might stop in mid-sentence because it's written that way, but it comes off as awkward. Some of the music is discordant, too.

Overall, though? Noble House is a delightful romp through the culture of a unique city. It matches up with my own memories of Fragrant Harbor, so much so it's uncanny, even though with the benefit of experience and hindsight those memories seem more like dreams now.

3321378,5,B0012E2F60,"I recently reviewed Noble House, having remembered that I liked it the first go around. What a treat! This is a TV miniseries at it's very finest. Pierce Brosnan, very young pre-Bond but perhaps more mature then than now, plays Ian Dunross, Supreme Leader of Struan's, a company with a history in Hong Kong. Hong Kong in the eighties is an intersection of Mainland China and Britain, American Capitalism and Chinese Tradition.

This is the authentic Hong Kong. My father bought me this DVD after a trip to the city in question, and most of the outdoor scenes in this movie are filmed in places I visited after a long flight from America. In a way, it's part travel guide. NCIS states it's setting is Norfolk, but the settings look nowhere like Norfolk. It's refreshing to see a TV series that didn't chicken out in terms of filming in authentic areas. Hong Kong is quite a city, and it's impression on the plot is quite essential.  The authenticity comes in handy, to the point where my jaw simply dropped watching settings I had seen with my own eyes face disaster in the context of the movie. There's nothing low budget about any of the proceedings on this DVD, a landslide and a grease fire that eventually overtakes a floating barge are filmed with intensity and ingenuity.  Which is surprising, as most of this movie is an adult mercantile drama.

Brosnan is very refined here. You can tell he was having fun on his trip to Hong Kong, and the script demands a greater emotional range than you'd get in say Bond or Mrs. Doubtfire.  He shouts, he threatens, he mourns.  Some of it is not entirely convincing, especially in the movie's more intense moments, but he's smoother than Bond as he reclines in his yacht and explains the context of Hong Kong's traditions. It's very satisfying to watch Brosnan work in this movie.

Also standing out is John-Rhys Davies. What a heavy! As rival mogul, he's out to destroy Dunross' company, but in the face of disasters he ends up becoming more of an anti-hero. One character overtly explains that there's a sort of yin-yang balancing act of power going on between the two. Some may say that Davies' character gets off easy. He does some truly despicable things in the context of the movie, such as a (mock?) attempted rape, but Davies also plays him with some noble features as well. Watch how cool he is as a fire is consuming things around him. Watch how the pair's problems are resolved. I for one appreciated a fully realized antagonist, and a story well-bred enough to let him go a little bit worse for wear but alive and fighting in the end.

There are lots of themes flying around. One is Joss, that actions influence one's fate in the future. Part of the movie is an examination of how capitalism and chinese tradition have intersected in Hong Kong. There's almost a confucian message about discipline and benevolence in work. Most of the morally lacking characters end up dead or financially weakened, the hard workers with respect stay alive and make some money.  But there's also something of a Taoist message: Everyone has a place in the scheme of things, and very few things have changed in terms of the playing field by the end of the movie. In the light of the financial bailout in the US, here you have a story that is VERY sympathetic to a bail-out philosophy.

Having watched this a second time, I could not turn this series off. A trip to Hong Kong from where I live would cost about 1700$ when all was said and done, but here you have a 15 dollar DVD that can act as a sort of proxy trip to the orient. It's a trip well worth taking.",1319932800,3,3597,4.537037037037037

3321407,5,B0012E2F60,"Noble House by James Clavell

We are fans of James Clavell and have enjoyed reading and then seeing both Shogun and now Noble House. Born on October 10th, 1924 under the name of Charles Edmund Dumaresq Clavell, the writer has such eloquent style that reading his works is like living his adventures.

Clavell is the son of a British Royal Navy officer who was stationed in Australia. At the age of 16, he joined the Royal Artillery and was sent to Malaya to fight the Japanese, was captured and sent to a Japanese prisoner of war camp on Java, later transferred to Changi Prison in Singapore. Clavell went through great distress while a prisoner of war in the hands of the Japanese, therefore, when we read his works, we read from the perspective of a man that has lived experiences that have provided depth of humanity in ways unknown to most of us.
With Noble House, he achieves a rare look into the Hong Kong prior to China's regaining this financial power. It is the story of greed, of power plays, of market intervention similar to what we see today... great men playing games to forward their interests at the expense of the common investor who has no clue his / her money is being manipulated by market forces.

The cast of characters is superb, starting with Pierce Brosnan as Ian Dunross, Deborah Raffin as Casey Tcholok, the business woman who travels with Ben Masters as Linc Barlett to raid the Noble House and take over its power. She is magnificent and there is a scene where a restaurant is on fire, all about to perish and to save their lives they must jump into the water. Well, she does not jump but dives with such grace and elegance that the scene steals the show... and Ian Dunross's heart. As in Shogun, John Rhys Davies as Quillan Gornt, delivers a masterful performance, teaching us much about the orient. Denholm Elliott plays Alastair Struan, John Houseman as Sir Geoffrey Allison provides a superb cameo appearance. Tia Carrere as Venus Poon is beautiful as always, dresses with such style that we are left spell-bound. Nancy Kwan plays Claudia Chen. Remember Cato from the Pink Panther? Well, actor Burt Kwouk now plays Phillip Chen, who is part of the board of directors of Noble House but has a son who betrays the firm. Lisa Lu is Ah Tam, Dudley Sutton is Commissioner Crosse and a powerful performance as usual is delivered by Khigh Dhiegh as Four Finger Wu, a businessman who has made his fortune in the traffic of opium. The roles they play are well explained and you will go from one hour show to the next with great desire to see how the story develops. There is mystery, murder, abduction, ransom, sex, romance and great intrigue.

Pierce Brosnan delivers a great performance in the role of business tycoon Ian Dunross, who can be fierce and dispassionate, but has a heart and a passion that from the outset, he steals the show.

The series starts with Pierce Brosnan becoming the Tai-Pan or CEO of Noble House. The term is a Cantonese expression that signifies that who holds the title is supreme leader, a tradition that has been followed for over a century. Next we understand the importance of profitability, become aware of a kidnapped son of a member of the board of directors, meet Werewolf, and appreciate the meaning of broken coins that if matched, make the Tai-Pan have to grant whatever favor is asked for the return of the other half of each coin.

Quillan Gornt, played by Rhys Davies is the enemy of Noble House, wanting to take control of the company at all costs, even at the destruction of the firm and he agrees to sell the shares he holds to bring the market down, taking away the value of Noble House.

If you want to learn about Hong Kong, about how power games are played and love intrigue... this is the series for you. Too good to miss!!!",1231977600,2,3800,4.579411764705882

3321425,5,B0012E2F60,"The book has been condensed into a very worthwhile dvd.

Dunross always faced one issue, the melding of British Hong Kong and China, and this is the background for the struggle for who will control Struan's, the Noble House of British Hong Kong - their historical Hong Kong rival, Gornt, or an American raider who will try to play both ends against the middle - his middle.

The cinematography is tremendous, and the acting is always good, and usually better than people might expect.

Julia Nicksun played Orlanda Ramos, the Eurasian beauty who would have been the Angelina Jolie of Hong Kong 1963. She is picture perfect.

Brosnan, the Tai-Pan of the Noble House, wins, in part, because he thinks in terms of a broader picture than the Americans, one of whom is portrayed as a clownish upstart who only has money...

It isn't enough.

The people who rule Hong Kong focus on the transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997; this is a quiet reminder that countries that think, and act, in terms of centuries, tend to do better than those who don't.

Buy this, whether for the subtle conflicts between the beautiful Deborah Raffin and Julia Nicksun, or to see, in part, how the men who rule the world think about the world, and then act.",1213142400,,1231,4.593607305936073

3321430,4,B0012E2F60,"I learned a long time ago not to expect faithful adaptations of great books, but to hope instead for a solid script, casting, cinematography and scoring that stands on its own.  With Clavell's hand in this work I was pleasantly surprised at the outcome here.  I have read the book many times and looked forward to this DVD release, not having ever seen the original airing on network TV.  It would not be possible to capture the intricate story lines, complex character development, agendas, and side plots in a mini-series.  The creators instead gave us the essence of the story (with some twists) and captured an interesting time in the history of Hong Kong, on the eve of the transfer of ownership back to China.

It is dated only in that it is a Euro-centric perspective in the film, and misses out entirely on the perspective of many of the Chinese characters, which was articulated well in the book and resonates today.

Repeat readers of the book - keep an open mind, do not expect a replica of the book, enjoy the actors and the music score and you won't be disappointed.  If you haven't read the book, you will enjoy doing so after viewing this title.",1210032000,,1160,4.57487922705314

Set in Hong Kong, where east meets west, ancient traditions collide with super wealth and power. Pierce Brosnan as Taipan of the Noble house. The Taipan, the leader of the great chouse and company, Stuans. Involved in shipping it seems, bit hard to workout what exactly they do apart from make money. And make money they do. Hand over fist it appears. Ian Dunross (Pierce Brosnan) is ripe to be raided by the ugly American from Parcom. Ad to the mix the evil rival magnate Quinlan Gornt (John Rhys-Davies) and we are plunged into the seedy world of counter espinonage and the criminal underworld. As The Tipan and Gornt fight it out over a tense week fighting each other on the stock exchange and forcing great sums of money to change hands, ruining small banks in the process. All just to save face. The Noble House is a grant romp through the 80's when greed and power were wonderful. It is full of wonderfully memorable catch phrases and cliches, The Noble House of Chen, Number One Son Chen, Taipan, Joss (luck), The Old Hag, and the list goes on. I would have liked to have seen a few extras on the DVD. The apartment building collapse towards the climax is great to see in clear slow motion. However the aftermarth is a bit far fetched, knowing what we do now, with the likes of Threadbo, and The Twin Towers. A grand story, well told and well made.",1209081600,2,1462,4.5
3321437,4,B0012E2F60,"There are a few issues here with Amazon and the DVD. I almost listened to someone who said it had scenes deleted, but I went back to look at the discs. Upon first glance, you might assume it is only 3 hours of 4.5 hours long, if you assumed one episode was on one disc and one was on another. The runtime is accurate within a few minutes. The VHS copies I have had all ran about 6 hours, save one version that missed the whole last two hours. This is close to the 376 minutes stated. WooHoo!
Everything seems to be here.
However, I need to look at my VHS versions. I got a little hinky when I saw that the 1988 movie was in 16x9. It may very well have been filmed in 35mm. Not sure there. If you look at the opening credits, you will see the stars in the coin, but the top of the coin looks lopped off. I am getting they cropped 1.33-1 down to 1.66-1, or something like that.

The runtime on IMDB is 355 minutes. Originally it showed 8 hours, but the people who input the data do not always take commercials into consideration, and on some DVD sets they do not think that the opening and closing credits might show up less often than after each episode.

I am not as happy with cropped 16x9, as my player can stretch the film to the proportions I want. That said, I still feel terribly happy this made it to DVD finally, having been pulled out of the maelstrom in the toilet of pre-DVD Age Mini-series.

Last thing, which has to do with Amazon. Like, guys! I have about a dozen movies that you were supposed to email me about when they were available. Dudes, take note. This is the third of the twelve that has come out and I received doodly squat from you in the way of a warning. I would have ordered this weeks ago if y'all were on your toes. Good thing I randomly check things out. I would hate to miss it and have to pay your marketplace scalpers 200 for a copy. Can you dig it, Amazon? I knew that you could.

3321460,4,B0012E2F60,"For some reason, the DVD producers have decided to make this into a ""widescreen"" presentation.  But this is not a widescreen film.  It is a t.v. movie made in 1988.  It was shot at an aspect ratio of 1.33 to 1 (a perfect fit for your standard t.v. screen).  The result of the modification is that you see LESS of the image.  They simply cropped off the top and bottoms of the picture.  You can see that this is NOT how ""Noble House"" was meant to be seen at the very beginning:  the credits feature medallions of the actors faces along with their names, and the tops of the medals (and the tops of the actors' heads) are CUT OFF.  Also, now, several shots look crowded.

That aside, everything else is great.  The image (what's left of it) is sharp and clear.  The story remains fascinating and the acting top notch.  It's a great tale of international intrigue and finance.  (And, oh, those 80s fashions!)",1207612800,3,905,4.412121212121212
3321461,5,B0012E2F60,"I would definitely suggest that ""Noble House"" certainly surpasses its
original literary text. It was a very long novel and at times it felt tiring to read through all of the subplots and to go into detail about minor characters. I started to read the novel first but kept postponing to
continue with it, yet when I finally saw the mini-series I was completely
captivated and watched the first five hours in one night.

Besides the additions and changes which enhanced the story to a
better level, I loved the cinematography of the scenes, particularly those
of Pierce (the use of panning and tracking shots in camera movement
seemed to gracefully glide with Ian which is symbolic of his character).
The musical themes were especially self-reflexive in the cinematic
medium; I loved how it depicted the grandeur of the role of Tai-pan of
the Noble House as well as the romance of the setting and the couples.

Love the cliffhangers at the end of each episode, they always leave you
wanting to know what will happen next.  In terms of storytelling, the
main and subplots keep twisting and turning; either truly satisfying or
better than you would expect.  The trick is that sometimes the acting as
well as the cinematography work together to deceive the audience  i.e.
when there is a high angle shot of Ian's car driving through traffic, the
camera pulls back to reveal it is from Gornt's point of view, he smirks
which may imply he is involved with John's kidnapping.

A rather brilliant restoration for such an epic mini-series!  The visual quality is nearly flawless, sharper and more stunning than I had anticipated (especially to see Pierce's blue eyes).  The sound is great:  I love the grand Tai-pan theme playing on the main menu as well as
Casey's romantic theme played during the scene selection
menus.  Otherwise, the clarity of sound effects, voices, and
instruments is wonderful.  Although I would've preferred
moving images from the film on the main menu.  Anyway, the
mini-series is divided up into four episodes, two on each disc.

This is such a personal reward to me--I've been looking forward
to viewing this on DVD ever since I wrote the film analysis
article a few months back in honor of the 20th anniversary of its
broadcast on NBC.  It was my very first critique intended for
publication since I graduated from Rider University.  Actually,
I decided to write the analysis right after I realized there were
plans for this official release.  Perhaps it was joss after all!",1206921600,4,2493,4.830588235294118
3321462,4,B0012E2F60,"The ""Noble House"" miniseries is a very cool adaptation of the James Clavell novel of the same name.  The novel is complex and convoluted, and this miniseries actually does a stellar job of telling essentially the same story as the novel in a more linear fashion, which is essential to the miniseries medium.

Pierce Brosnan, head of the Struan Clan and Tai-Pan of the Noble House, sets the standard for being suave and sophisticated--his portrayal of the Tai-Pan in my opinion is absolutely perfect.  John Rhys-Davies as Gornt, the descendant of Brock, the Struan Clan's ancient enemy, crude and barbaric but also sophisticated, makes a perfect contrast with the elegant Brosnan.  They seem like born adversaries.  (We all remember Davies as the Portuguese navigator in Shogun.)

This is a captivating miniseries.  Set in Hong Kong, it is the story of a Clan feud between two powerful British shipping firms there, both of which have been based in Hong Kong since its founding as a British Crown colony. In fact, ""Noble House"" is the sequel to ""Tai-Pan"" which is the story of the founding of Hong Kong and of the Noble House. The whole story is great fun, sort of a ""Dallas"" in a Hong Kong setting (this is not a put-down--I loved Dallas!)  The film manages to make the combat of high finance easy to follow and understand, and this is a fascinating story.

A 'super great' mini-series that once you begin to watch, you'll have a hard time walking away from it. When ever I go back to watch this over again, I'm there for the duration, all 6+ hours of it!

Although stating a 'widescreen' version in the description, I seriously hope that's not another 'typo' from amazon! One has to wonder, since this was originally a made for television mini-series, some years ago. It doesn't appear that any effort was made to remaster the sound, as the description only lists, 'English'. And not seeing any special features listed either, which would have been great!

Either way, it's still worth buying, even just to replace my VHS 3 tape collection, (which I will still keep anyway). It's just a really great movie, that's listed among my favorites.

And if you're going to get this great mini-series, for sure get Tai Pan as well! Although just a movie and not a series, it is actually the real beginning of Noble House. Tai Pan by itself is another great movie listing among my favorites!

I've got 'two' copies on order, and am anxious to find out if there really is a widescreen version available on the DVD's, if 'any' of the sound had been enhanced, or if it's in mono, then if 'any kind' of features were added. Guess I'll have to wait until I actually get them in my hand to find out.

UPDATE:

Well I finally received and watched my new DVD copy of Nobile House. I was surprised that it was in fact a widescreen version, even though it was originally a made for T.V. mini-series. However looking at the box, I noticed it stating `monaural', which greatly disappointed me!

Even kicking in the `Pro Logic' on my receiver, it didn't do anything for the sound quality. It was a deafening, distinct, straight from the center channel speaker, `mono'!

I switched my receiver over to the stereo mode, and it helped a bit... at least I had the sound coming out of my right and left surround speakers.

It's a shame that the studio didn't want to invest the money into enhancing the sound to a true 5:1. It would have made for the prefect all around DVD.

Curious about something... I'm going to have to dig out my VHS tapes, and see if the sound was stereo on those...

Of course I could have done without all the introductions at the beginning of each chapter, and the scrolling credits at the end of each chapter.

3321485,5,B0012E2F60,"I was born and raised in Hong Kong until I was 16 years old.  I didn't read the book by James Clavell but the mini-series certainly brought back nostalgia from my formative years.  The distinction rating given to this series is based on the accurate and uncompromising portray of Hong Kong during the last few years prior to 1997 -- the repatriation to China from being a British colony.  There is a write-up on Wikipedia [...] that detailed the story behind Noble House.  It is based on Jardine Matheson who founded the Jardine Matheson Trading Company which conducted trades between India, China, and the U.K..  As an amateur history enthusiast, I really appreciate how Clavell captures the sentiment of the natives as well as the foreign counterparts greed to financial gains under those convoluted political systems.
To most people who grew up in the West, Noble House gives you a realistic snapshot of the history of Hong Kong during the 1980s.  The entire production was shot in Hong Kong, Macau (Macao), and part of China.  My only regret is that the producer did not spend the time to teach the actors the proper Chinese dialect (Cantonese) which resulted in utter nonsense to those who spoke the language.  This particular lack of details has always been overlooked in most  American film productions in which I deem very disrespectful.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend this mini-saga to those who would enjoy an intriguing suspenseful drama situated in the Orient in the late 20th century.

3321487,5,B0012E2F60,"James Clavell was a WONDERFUL Writer (yes, with a capital W) and NOBLE HOUSE was a gift he left to us!

Through his eyes we visit Hong Kong in the 1970's. Clavell, a virtuoso connoisseur of the human condition, manages to interweave a multitude of stories into a continuous carpet of a city living fast, taking risks, winning and loosing but never giving up.
Heads of huge conglomerates on the verge of foundering - yet never letting go of their rival's throat; dirt-poor Chinese maids striking it rich by a sudden turn of their joss; photographer-Wo and his trophy collection; drug-running smugglers asking for favors-you-can't-refuse; cold war spy networks riddled with double and triple agents; an American stock-market runner trying his hand in raiding Hong Kong companies; ladies getting ""pillowed"", men getting wooed, fortunes made and lost in the 10 days these all take place. Will the Noble House survive?

To quote Balzac, behind every great fortune lies crime. To prove him right, Noble House is but a thinly veiled reference to Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd, a real company. Anticlimactically for an historic British company operating in China, it is nowadays incorporated in Bermuda - and trying to forget its opium-running past (like so many City of London companies respectable today yet founded on drugs, dead cockneys and destroyed natives).

All these stories were presented masterfully in the original novel, without ever loosing the reader's interest or dropping the ball of building tension. There were less than a dozen writers who could do this - starting with Homer. My copy was so worn I had to replace it.

Now, this is a 1988 TV mini series based on the book - of comparable merit. Until recently, the mini-series were available only on VHS. The major casting was excellent (having suave Pierce Brosnan and beastly John Rhys-Davies go head-to-head was a stroke of genius). The rest of the cast was a mix of hit-or-miss: a really young Tia Carrere as mealy-mouth Venus Poon was a hit; Julia Nickson-Soul as the Eurasian beauty Orlanda Ramos a miss.  All in all, a truly beautiful production, yet, although it run for 6 hours total, it barely painted a broad-stroke picture of the complex story-lines.

Thus, in order to fully appreciate this masterpiece, my advice is to first read the book and only THEN watch the TV mini series.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1205452800,4,2376,4.984848484848484
3321488,5,B0012E2F60,"I first saw this on VHS Video Tape in 1989-1990.
Absolutely first class production values, brilliant setting, fantastic lead cast - while Pierce Brosnan is as debonair as ever as Ian Dun Ross ( even if he is rather ruthless in this particular manifestation), John Rhys Davies is the perfect foil as the slightly crude Quillan Gornt!

As usual - fast paced business, jet setting action, classy and glamorous. The colonial backdrop,first class plot, exotic locales, great photoplay etc contribute along with the typical trappings of the International Business Tycoon, to make this an extremely watchable and enjoyable Series.

Indeed, while ""Remington Steele"" may have set the stage to catapult Pierce Brosnan into becoming James Bond, his cold, clinical character portrayal of Ian Dun Ross in Noble House, cemented it (in my opinion.)

Absolutely watch-able - Eminently collect-able and highly desirable as an addition to one's home DVD collection, which is why I ve just PRE-ORDERED it via Amazon! I cant wait to watch it again!!

3321489,5,B0012E2F60,"Having all of Clavell's books, I revel in the movies made from his writings. He earlier brought SHOGUN to the screen, and for 4 nights in February, 1988, he aired the last show he produced. Starting on Sunday February 21st through Wednesday, February 24th, NOBLE HOUSE fought for ratings against the 1988 Winter Olympics taking place on another TV channel. For true fans of the late Clavell we miss new books coming off the presses. I lived in Japan for 25 months so SHOGUN has to be my favorite, with NOBLE HOUSE and TAI-PAN only an eyelash close seconds.

Starting with TAI-PAN in 1841 this epic of the trading house Dirk Struan founded is brought up to date, 1963.  The entire action of the 1200+ novel takes place in little more than one week. As in TAI-PAN the struggle between the two trading houses of Struan and Brock continues.

The script of NOBLE HOUSE is well written, with the action moving swiftly along. The mix of characters provides a veteran group, and since a deal for Pierce Brosnan to star in a James Bond movie had fallen through, he was available for one of his last TV appearances. He stated at the time of filming of NOBLE HOUSE that he was going to move away from both stage and TV, wanting to make movies. He and John Rhys-Davies had worked together previously. With relaxed conditions on the sets, all went well with this production.

The TV movie has,however, come under some complaint from both viewers and critics alike, but for me the movies made from James Clavell's books are lasting gifts given us from the author. The reviewer from TV Guide at the time, Don Merrill, ""kicked the stuffings out of this miniseries"" saying NOBLE HOUSE ""furnished with just about everything a melodrama could possibly contain-except characters that come to life"". Obviously he was no fan of Clavell's writings and possibly he had not read TAI-PAN. It is quite possible to watch this movie without having read either of the two books, but what a knowledge gained from these two books will provide is not only an understanding of this long standing feud to the death between these two houses but also some understanding of just what drives the personalites themselves, persons always concerned with their families' tradition going back into the mid 1840's, love as well as hate. It's not so much money or greed driving these folks, but just plain cold hatred. They want to destroy each other.

In the second night's drama the fire aboard the floating restaurant happens, and even Don Merrill of TV Guide termed that ""a dilly of a fire'. So too the horse race, and many other activities of this movie as well.

What a great mini-series. Long live NOBLE HOUSE and TAI-PAN.

3321490,5,B0012E2F60,"Noble House is an eight-hour Classic TV Miniseries produced and broadcast in 1988 by NBC. Based on the fantastic and richly detailed novel of the same name by James Clavell, it features a large cast headlined by Pierce Brosnan, who portrays business tycoon Ian Dunross.

This was NBC's second Classic TV Miniseries adaptation of a Clavell novel, the first was 1980s Shogun. Both take place in the same fictional universe, Noble House even featuring connections to Shogun and yet another Clavell novel, Tai-Pan.

For this miniseries, the timeframe of the original novel was changed from the early 1960s to the 1980s.

Other actors include Denholm Elliott, Deborah Raffin, Tia Carrere, John Houseman, Julia Nickson-Soul, and John Rhys-Davies (who also appeared in Shogun.)

Noble House centers around big-business piracy in Hong Kong. The miniseries opens with Brosnan driving through the rain to meet Denholm Elliott, who plays the outgoing ""tai-pan"" in Hong Kong's oldest and leading trading firm: Struan & Company.

""Tai-pan,"" a Cantonese expression, means ""supreme leader,"" and at Struan & Company the title has been passed down at least 150 years

Dunross' arch rival and enemy, Quillan Gornt (Rhys-Davles), is tai-pan of the second leading trading company. Not only does Gornt wants to destroy Dunross and take over Noble House, the two men have racing horses that compete against each other as well.

Meanwhile, two American tycoons (Raffin and Ben Masters) have come to Hong Kong to make a financial deal with Dunross.

But in Clavell's Hong Kong there is no such thing as a single deal. Double-dealing and triple-crossing are more the style of the international wheeler-dealers here.

Diverse players here include bankers, government officials, police and a man called ""Four Finger Wu"" (Khigh Dhiegh), who runs an opium-smuggling syndicate from a junk boat in Aberdeen Harbor and has a mistress one-third his age named Venus Poon (Carrere).

The eight hours practically sizzle, thanks to Bercovici's articulate script (he also wrote the script for the Shogun miniseries).

Viewers a treated to a manipulated run on a bank, selling short on the stock market, the fixing of horse races, a kidnaping, seductions and murders. Running counterpoint are the burning and sinking of a floating restaurant and a catastrophic landslide.

Add to this a couple of juicy love stories, especially the one between Brosnan and Raffin (who brings a light comic element to her role as the tough wheeler-dealer), while everything is done in ravishing cars, speedboats, mansions and casinos.

But, the biggest and brightest star of the show is clearly Hong Kong, which is more like a video game than a city, filled with the exotica and intrigue that you used to find in old movies. Early in the show, a character who's just landed at the airport asks, ""What's that smell?"" His host answers, ""That's the smell of money.""

The $16-million-plus production included eight weeks of exteriors shot in Hong Kong and another eight for interiors in the De Laurentiis studio in Wilmington, N.C.

One of my favorite movies, it tells the story of the ""Noble House"" and Ian Dunross. The Noble House is loosely based on the real trading company of Jardine Mathewson, one of the early trading companies that helped found Hong Kong. (who has since moved to Singapore when Hong Kong reverted back to the Chinese). Plot twists and fortunes made and lost plus romance and danger make this well worth watching. Lions Gate can be hit and miss on the print quality and at this price probably not restored...BUT......it will probable be better than my DVD-R copy off a VHS Tape.",1200096000,13,913,4.7125

Had to do with world money & hong cong china.",1199836800,,108,3.5416666666666665
3321503,5,B0012E2F60,"This film ranks a full five stars in my book. The storyline about family traditions (and secrets) completely capture you in the first 15 minutes. The desire to BE Tai Pan, keep the secrets (or not), the aura of the Orient in a time now gone and all that implies, the complexity of doing business in that culture, the splash of American money, power, and competition -- all make this a mini-series champion. If that's not enough, add the outstanding cast and filming location.

For at least four years, we have been seeking the DVD version of Nobel House. Our VHS copy is old, fuzzy, and getting discolored. For a change of pace, there is nothing like being transported to the Orient on a designated Sunday and allowing yourself to be enchanted by Pierce Brosnan at his best.

The scenery is beautiful (not New York or L.A.), the dialog is tight, the cast is great, and the story line can't be beat. Why, oh why is it taking so long to get this piece to DVD? When Nobel House finally arrives to its devoted U.S. fans on DVD, maybe we can get the Blu-ray version, or even HD DVD?? Please hurry!!!!",1186531200,3,1095,4.442786069651741
3321504,5,B0012E2F60,"I got the book and read it in two days (more than 800 pages). Clavell is a master of the art of captivating his readers' attention, intriguing them with suspense, delighting them with superb detail and surprising them with plot twists and wit.

The movie does perfect justice to the book - no corners are cut and the spirit and letter of the book are kept almost religiously. After all, Clavell himself took part in creating the series.

A young and talented Pierce Brosnan plays a quite real Dunross while being supported by a solid cast of experienced heavyweights showing off their superb acting in a romantic yet accurate Hong-Kong of the 60-70s.

I bought the tapes as soon as they were available and have been watching them once a year (so that the tape is 'exercised', yet not worn-out).

I plan to go to a studio and have them transferred to DVD so that I save them from oblivion.

I would kill for a full resolution, remastered DVD version with surround! I can't understand why a lot of trash is being re-released on DVD while creations like Noble House are still ignored.",1159660800,14,1081,4.580310880829016
3321505,1,B0012E2F60,"Unfortunately, the 3 Tape version of ""Noble House"" is incomplete and leaves out the entire climax of the Mini Series.

This is terribly disappointing.  Saw it on TV and was looking forward to seeing it again, only to find that it leaves you up in the air without an ending.",1155945600,18,273,4.44

3321507,5,B0012E2F60,I love this Mini-Series so much that I've worn out my VHS copy. I can't wait for it to be released on DVD. There is a lot of action in this series- multiple plots unfolding at the same time. Too bad there is no sequel. I'm still wondering who has the last coin.,1106006400,9,261,3.943396226415094

3321510,5,B0012E2F60,Pierce looks great and has the last laugh when his enemies plot to take over the Noble House from the Dunross family. Big Business is set in lavish and uncertain Hong Kong. Banking and other businesses scramble to to position themselves a few years before the return of Hong Kong to China. You follow all the players to the climatic conclusion when they all get what they deserve!!! I really want this on DVD do I don't have to deal with a two tape movie and all the rewinding!!,1090368000,14,478,4.382022471910112
3321511,5,B0012E2F60,"Noble House is an outstanding story about big business, Hong Kong
and politics laced with intrigue and romance.
Ian Dunross, played by Pierce Brosnan, is the powerful leader of the history laden Noble House.  His performance is nothing less than spectacular as it weaves through one exciting plot after another.
This story is so riveting that you'll watch it again and again.
I enjoy it so much that my VHS copy is no longer any good.  I sincerely hope it is reprduced on DVD very soon.",1053648000,47,486,4.6395348837209305
