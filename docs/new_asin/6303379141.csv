7844544,5,6303379141,You age to know what you are expecting. I paid for this knowing the quality was so poor it was comic. Stupendously comic.,1419724800,,121,4.304347826086956
7844545,1,6303379141,"There is so much wrong with this video I hardly know where to begin.  The character of Chillingworth is mispronounced and written ""ChillingSworth"".  The scenes depicted are not like the scenes in the text.  The velcro adds a nice comedic touch.  The ""scholars"" misplace the women's movement and the writing of this novel in history.  The acting could not have been worse.  And I never reached the end of it, it was so bad.  I actually show it to my sophomores to teach them to read things for themselves rather than have others interpret the text for them and as a comedic break during the reading of the novel.",1256774400,2,611,4.5504587155963305
7844546,1,6303379141,"Our English class had a hoot over this video. The flashing A in the sky, which looked like some sort of weird LSD trip (""Look, the A in the sky!"" *enter seizure-inducing flashing colors*), and Pearls funny little temper tantrum sent the students into torrents of laughter. Bad acting and effects. It sounded like Pearl was related to Shatner.

7844547,1,6303379141,"You know I was just thinking, about how much better a root canal would be than this ""movie."" This ""movie"" is terrible to say the least. I've seen better costumes in a 5th grade school play. Acting? What acting!!! This is absolutely terrible, and I should think that if MST3K ever get back together, this should be their first target. Absolutely terrible. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!",1073865600,2,375,4.7846153846153845
7844548,1,6303379141,"This movie is terrible! We watched it as a suppliment to the 2 tape video by PBS. We watched this movie again just for comic relief. The acting was absolutley horrid! The narrators named ""Roger Chillingworth"" as ""Roger Chillingsworth"" not only was this spoken, it appeared on the screen numerous times. The scene where Hester is to ""Let down her long brown hair"" the actress let down her almost shoulder length hair... the scene on the scaffold with the old man in the nylon jumpsuit looks like he was hired off a Mannhatten street corner... Don't get me started on the night scaffold scene where the huge ""meteor"" appears... great 10 cent special effects.... Hester's ""velcro"" ""A"" put a nice touch for a 1600s setting... With modern car noise, and disgusting acting, i bet Nathaniel Hawthorne is rollling in his grave!!
Don't buy, unless you want to introduce students with a classic (which many think is boring) novel, in a un-planned comedic way.
I chuckle when I think how bad this movie really is!",991267200,8,1002,4.764367816091954
7844549,1,6303379141,"Initially, this video seems like a skit from Saturday Night Live. The ""professors"" are paradies of themselves, and I've seen better acting from 2nd grade students.  The video is boring and dated. And if I was bored with it, I can only imagine how much my eighth-graders would have been turned off.  I would have given it ""no-stars"" but that wasn't an option.  Other than that, it was fine.",989712000,7,389,4.608695652173913
