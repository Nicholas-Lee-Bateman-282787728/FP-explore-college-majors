But it will NOT play laser discs. Laser disc players went in and out of fashioo with the speed of ....well a laser! Msny proplr still own VHS players....but Laser-Disc players? Even if one wanted one, they were out of production SO fast, people hardly had time to get to the local store to buy them!""

Your TV will play laserdiscs, guaranteed, as will all TVs.  Laserdisc players were around from 1978 to early 2010 (don't believe me?  Google it), hardly ""in and out of fashion with the speed of a laser.""  They did not go out of production ""so fast.""  You had a good 32 years to purchase one new at retail, and then there's always Amazon and eBay to purchase one.

And yes, this is a laserdisc.  It says so in the title.  Amazon doesn't have a laserdisc selling section, so it's been lumped in with DVD.",1372636800,2,960,4.324022346368715
8251335,4,B000WMWKYU,"I have hard a lot about the ""Ephemeral Films"" series.  A group of public service annoucements, and advertising, from the 1940s-1960s, they show a world full of hope, conformity, obedience to authority, close-knit families, and doing things the ""right"" way.  They are a true window into the past, and, more than that, they are  good examples of what often ridiculous propaganda looks like and sounds like -- so that people living today, (and in the future), may forever be on their guard against this sort of thing.  In these ""ephemeral films"", good is mixed with bad, in a degree that it's sometimes hard to separate the wheat, (good), from the chaff, (bad).  Entertaining, thoughtful stuff -- and you get to look at old cars, old kitche appliances, and old hairstyles and clothing styles, as well!

I TRULY would like to purchase this product.  But I am VERY confused as to the format it is in. The title of the item reads as follows: YOU CAN'T GET THERE FROM HERE : EPHEMERAL FILMS 1946- 1960 ( LASER DISC FORMAT ).  Below this title, however, ware written, in smaller letters: Format: DVD.  I happen to be fortunate enough to own a television that will play BOTH DVDS and VHS tapes.  But it will NOT play laser discs.  Laser disc players went in and out of fashioo with the speed of ....well a laser!  Msny proplr still own VHS players....but Laser-Disc players?  Even if one wanted one, they were out of production SO fast, people hardly had time to get to the local store to buy them!

My question thus remains: WHICH FORMAT IS THIS ALBUM IN???????  If it IS in laser-disc format, I implore the manufacturer to make a new edition in DVD.  And to sell it not only on Amazon, but on websites which attract people who want, and deeply believe in, the US Constitution and freedom itself.  Because -- from President Kennedy's assassination, through Watergate, through 9/11, and beyond -- brave people have been questioning their ""leaders"" intentions, and wondering if those intentions are not for the general good -- but, instead, mainly for these ""leaaders'"" own good.  As an entertaining tool to see through government and other ""smoke-screens"", the ""Ephemeral Films"" series is without peer!

So -- please clear this up, Amazon and producers of this video.  PLEASE answer my question: WHAT FORMAT IS THIS PROGRAM IN??????  \

If it can be verififed that it is DVD OR VHS format -- now or in the future, you've got one customer here!  (and probably a great many more customers, if it was in DVD format, only.)",1305676800,,2510,4.706422018348624
8251336,5,B000WMWKYU,"- from these 19 rarely-seen motion pictures clips from the Golden Age of American consumerism. Ever wonder why you just don't fit in? Ever wonder why on Saturday nights you're all alone in the basement with your G.I. Joes and a soldering iron playing ""Tell Me Where the Missile Bases Are"" while all the cool kids are down at the malt shop or out at the lake getting naked and fornicating? Well, buddy, it's probably because you never saw these any of these ""mental hygiene"" films. Produced in the fun loving '50s they're scientifically designed to help square pegs fit into round holes. And their message is more valid today than ever before. Conform! Fit in! And for God's sake, don't ever, ever be DIFFERENT. Look at all you get: ""Benefits of Looking Around"", ""Habit Patterns"", ""Shy Guy"" (with a young Dick York), ""Live and Learn"", ""What About Juvenile Delinquency?"", ""Molly Grows Up"", ""Dating: Do's and Don'ts"" and ""Narcotics: Pit of Despair."" Whether it's proper table manners, good grooming, your first period or how to avoid copping a habit the size of Utah everything you need to know is right here. Remember, it's almost never too late to become a good citizen so sit quiet, pay attention and order NOW.",1246924800,,1211,4.771428571428571
