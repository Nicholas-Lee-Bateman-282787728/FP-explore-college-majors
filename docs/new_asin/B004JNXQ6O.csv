8431962,1,B004JNXQ6O,"I viewed this movie in 1970. At that time I found it very amusing, and liked it very much.  But I bought it just this week, and by golly what a bad film this is. First the quality of the film is very lousy.  Secondly the script is very poor, and I was disappointed in having purchased it. I would not recommend it to anyone. When I viewed it the first time I was only 15 years old.",1379894400,,381,3.871794871794872
8431963,2,B004JNXQ6O,"Like Dan O. said...this is a COLOR film because I have an old copy from TV, IN COLOR.
Obviously this DVD will be in B&W (see images), while Horror Express will be in Color.
""Horror"" is now on BluRay and ""Uncle"" is on ""iOffer"" in COLOR. The print on this DVD doesn't look that great for ""Uncle""...but then, the ""iOffer""print is barely better.",1325030400,2,341,4.428571428571429
8431964,3,B004JNXQ6O,"As you can all check with IMDB the movie is in color, so check first if the dvd is BW or color or if it is just a description mistake.  Format 2:35.",1297036800,2,148,3.625
8431965,5,B004JNXQ6O,"Christopher Lee is always great, and has been playing a vampire for a very long time. The rarely seen, Uncle Was a Vampire is an Italian comedy dubbed into English in which Lee is, of course, the title vampire. He comes to his nephew's castle after his own is destroyed, seeking to rest in the family crypt. But his bumbling nephew has sold the castle to a hotel group due to financial difficulties, so Christopher Lee decides to end his curse by turning the nephew int a vampire. Soon the female guests are all in love with the nephew after he bites them, making the males at the hotel very upset and curious. It's a fun little movie. Horror Express, a straight horror movie, also with Chrisopher Lee, stars Peter Cushing and also a short appearance by Telly Savalas of Kojak fame. It's sort of like The Thing From Another World meets the Orient Express. Lee is a archeologist who finds a missing link and brings it on a passenger train. The link soon comes to like and the life force in the link is capable of jumping from host to host. Lee and Cushing try to figure out what's going on and why are people dying one by one. This is another overlooked horror film.",1296777600,5,1165,4.398148148148148
