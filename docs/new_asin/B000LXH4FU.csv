8164849,2,B000LXH4FU,"Basically clips of the most recent bulldog players (last 20-30 years)to make it into the NFL, and only those players to make it into the NFL. If you're looking for something that shows a couple  of clips of the older standouts like Bill Stanfill or Jake Scott, keep looking, Fran Tarkenton was the only older player included and his clips lasted only 1.5-2minutes. I personally found the presentation annoying in that it presents clips of players with their stats (like 40 time and number of yards rushed during the last season) scrolling constantly across the bottom of the screen. The most comparable thing to this dvd would be ESPN's coverage on draft day with short clips and commentary about a player's strengths. Also found it annoying that the announcer said ""hunker down bulldogs, hunker down"" at the start of every other set of clips and whenever a pro team was first mentioned there was a soundeffect to go along with it (like an eagle screetch when the Phil Eagles are mentioned). It gets two stars because the clips they show are pretty good. Only die hard fans should buy.",1345507200,,1085,4.7407407407407405
