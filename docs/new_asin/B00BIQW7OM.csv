After much frustration, I checked out Amazon.com. I found out there that I needed to pre-order this movie, which I did. It came to my post office box as promised and I have enjoyed it!

5623244,5,B00BIQW7OM,"Just got the new Blu Ray of ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" this week from Amazon.

Wow!  The picture is fantastic-- just beautiful.  With sharp, colorful, blu-ray video quality!  Extremely natural flesh tones and other colors, and indeed, a very natural picture in all respects. The sound is . . . even better.  It's so clear and perfect, coming out of just my HD TV's own speakers, that I didn't know those speakers could sound so good until now (especially noticeable when some of the wonderful music from this movie is playing!).

The extras are terrific! Richard Gere, David Keith, David Caruso, Oscar-winner Louis Gossett, Jr., Harold Sylvester, Lisa Eilbacher, Tony Plana, and really ALL the stars and secondary players (except Debra Winger, Lisa Blount, and Robert Loggia), plus the director (Taylor Hackford), producer, and writer are in a wonderful, informative, lengthy 2007 ""making of"" documentary.  As are the music writers and music producer for another feature about the Oscar-winning music (but neither Joe Cocker nor Jennifer Warnes participates in this feature).  Also there is another great piece where Louis Gossett returns to Port Townsend, Washington, where it was filmed, showing us the sites and speaking with several local people who were there for the filming in 1981 (some had performed as extras in the movie, too).  These Blu-ray extra features were all on the 2007 Special Edition DVD release, along with another extra about some military romances in real life.  All of the extras look excellent on my HD TV, by the way; not soft-focus as if only made for the non-HD DVD.

The movie itself is a modern classic, truly a great film in my opinion, which launched and accelerated a lot of young careers.  An honest, gritty portrayal of young naval aviators-in-training, all under the heel of their responsible, far wiser, far more worldly, and kick-ass tough drill instructor, played perfectly by Louis Gossett, Jr.  This film also deals with the reality of these same young people temporarily in love (in their spare time, & usually it lasts at most for the 13 weeks of boot camp), and the sexually charged nature of their relationships, complete with honest, raw language-- though explicit scenes are few in this film.  These elements are set against the best boot camp training scenes in a movie about military recruits that I have ever seen, with both Richard Gere and Louis Gossett, Jr. absolutely riveting in their portrayals of the hotshot recruit (who actually has ""no [other] place to go""), and the elite, yet streetwise, drill instructor, who is tasked with making these recruits into officer material while weeding out those who expose crucial weaknesses.

The dialog in the boot camp training scenes, particularly, is just fresh, often slick and clever, and outstanding overall. As is the acting from this wonderful ensemble of young actors. If you are a fan of Gere, Gossett, or Debra Winger, heck also Robert Loggia, you will never see them in better performances than in this film.  Nor in a better film.  (Loggia, with little screen time here, perhaps equaled his great performance of a much fuller role in 1983's ""Scarface."")

This Blu-ray gets an A+ from me.  It exceeded all expectations as to picture and sound quality, and I just loved the extras.  The movie is a classic, as fresh and sharp today as ever.  HIGHLY recommended!",1368144000,30,3371,4.973262032085562
5623245,4,B00BIQW7OM,I remember thinking how good both Richard Gere and Debra Winger are in this movie and was wondering why it was not on blu ray  sadly the female co-star in the film passed away unnoticed after a lengthy illness . It's a very good film I'm glad it's finally about to arrive as they say IT!'S BETTER LATE THAN NEVER . Thanks PARAMOUNT FOR REALIZING  THAT WE OF THE OLDER GENERATION GO FOR THE FILMS FROM THE LATE 1950s through the 80s ( BUT THEY HAVE TO BE DAMN GOOD MOVIES ) THANKS M T L,1361923200,2,485,4.041666666666667

This transfer is uneven. Some scenes have too much inky black look that appears like blotches.

Debra Winger is not in the special videos but many of the other actors are.  They go behind the scenes and explain how shots were composed and decided.  Debra Winger hasn't acted in a while but she is on a new series called The Ranch with Sam Elliott.  She hasn't lost her touch.

5623287,5,B00BIQW7OM,"When I think of Actress Debra Winger, two movies come to mind right away. URBAN COWBOY and AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN. I was a young teenager when both came out so I was not able to see them in the theater. However, when CABLE TV debuted in and around 1980 it didn't take long for it to show there. What a hit it is! I wouldn't recommend it for younger audiences below 13 however. It has adult themes, nudity and language. Richard Gere, Debra Winger and Louis Gossett, Jr. definitely give great performances. I'm sure just about everyone knows the story by now, but it centers on a man (Richard Gere) that is not satisfied with his current life. He decides to join the US NAVY and become a Naval Aviator. Easier said than done. While in bootcamp he meets many friends within his squadron, but ultimately falls for one woman (Debra Winger), a local paper mill employee that desperately wants a better life. They both go through the trials and tribulations of a relationship during his stay at the training camp. His good friend, however, doesn't have such a great and happy ending.
This movie is bittersweet to me. On one hand you have a rocky relationship that breaks through the good and rough spots, while a friend's ends in tragedy. I liked the overall feel of the movie and the music. I thought all the players did a great job and it is just beautiful on Blu-ray!
I just can't say that enough about this edition. If you have loved this movie since it debuted in the early '80s, I think you will love the new HD edition even more!
