2156804,3,B00061I294,"In spite of its derivativeness and lack of true cinematic flair, UNSTOPPABLE is enjoyable and has some good things to recommend it:

*Mark Sheppard and Kim Coates as an Abbott and Costello-style hit men duo, whose stone faced seriousness adds unintended camp;

*Jacqueline Obradors does well as a gritty cop who doesn't take guff from bad government agents;

*Wesley Snipes who will more than likely enter the aging action hero group of stars like Steven Seagal, Jean Claude van Damme and others, doesn't require much suspension of belief in his hallucinogenic stupor;

Stuart Wilson is fun in his ""Let's try and act like Rip Torn"" villain role.

It's all mindless froth but it kept me interested in spite of its flaws.",1116979200,5,719,4.909090909090909
2156805,4,B00061I294,"Dean Cage has so many problems -

He is trying to deal with the emotional trauma of causing his friends death.

He is mistakenly identified as a CIA agent at a set-up so the twit injects him with a revelutionary hallucinatory drug that ends up killing its victim.

Cage then explodes into action as he puts the make on the would-be kidnappers and goes on the run.

Hey, I still like that truck, especially those lights.  Even I was hanging on for dear life.

It took his friend, Scott's sister, a while to piece together the clues to Dean's new problem.  The fading in and out of his vision was a bit distracting but made for the realism of what he was seeing.

Oh yeah, his memories were helping to block the suggestions being made to him.  And confusing his tormentors.

Finally, an actress I could really like in her role, she was not overpowering, but feminine and persistent in pursueing Dean to help bring him in safely and determined to save his life.

Where is that dang antidote?

I greatly enjoyed all the actors' in their roles and will be watching it again to see what I missed the first time around.

Will recommend but it is still just a matter of taste.  I enjoyed it.",1110931200,,1183,4.391705069124424
2156806,2,B00061I294,"Below-average actioner 'Unstoppable' (formerly called 'Nine Lives' under which title the film is released in some countries) proves that Wesley Snipes, the star of 'Blade' trinity, awfully needs a film with a decent script.  I like him, but it is true that he might be heading for the straight-to-video land where many action film stars are gone, and never come back.

Snipes plays an ex-special agent Dean Cage who was in Bosnia, where his last mission went terribly wrong.  He managed to come back alive, but is feeling guilty of the past, and his relations with his girlfriend (and a local cop) Amy (Jacoueline Obradors, 'Six Days, Seven Nights') are far from smooth.  Sounds familiar?  It is, and you have to wait a while for the actions to start.

They start when Cage is mistaken for another man at a diner.  Some corrupt guys in suits (and hiding in Baltimore City ambulance ... don't ask me why), misidentifying the target, inject some substance into Cage's body -- making him dizzy and half-unconscious.  (Oh, and the film is set in Baltimore, and you see a diner with a big crab, but it was in fact shot in Bulgaria.)

Actions (all standard ones, like shoot-outs and explosions) are not bad, but all the scenes are shot at night, so you might dislike the continuing murky darkness.  But the filmmakers seem to have spent most of the budget in showing the so-so actions, for the other parts seem badly neglected, when they should have been more careful about them.  The strange, flashy cameraworks only reduce the tension, and in one scene, to express the nasty effects of the injected material, we are to share POV of the ex-agent Cage -- that means, we see the scenes quickly swtching between a hospital office and a military prison one after the other,  That is surely unusual, trying to give us the sense of hullcination.  But it's only irritating.

Director David Carson ('Star Trek: Generations' -- odd number entry!) throws in these gimmicks, but they cannot completely hide the familiar touch of the underdeveloped B film, or the sense of 'We have seen it before,' especially the last 20 minutes.  The baddies played by Stuart Wilson and Kim Coates are just ordinary -- a bad guy in charge of the whole situation, and another bad guy who does dirty business.  And as to Wesley Snipes, there is nothing that would remind us of the charisma of the vimpire slayer.

I still remember Wesley Snipes in Spike Lee films, and the entertaining 'Passanger 57' and 'Drop Zone.'  And I didn't hate 'Demolition Man.'  But watching him in 'Unstoppable' makes me think that he might (just, might for now, OK?) on the way to be the next Seagal.  And once that happens, it's really unstoppable.",1110067200,5,2694,4.728051391862955
2156807,2,B00061I294,"That Hollywood can afford to produce such rubbish and, talk quality Actors into submitting to the script, is amazing.  Both Snipes and Jacquelyn Obradores are very talented actors wasted on this foolishness.",1107561600,,207,5.46875
2156808,1,B00061I294,Really that sums it up.  So bad I had  hard time watching it.  And I usually greatly enjoy his movies.  So sad.,1104364800,,111,3.909090909090909
2156809,3,B00061I294,"UNSTOPPABLE is a disappointing exercise of how trying to cover a routine story with a lot of camera and time-lapse gimmicks simply cannot save a poor script. Though represented as a low budget film, the special effects crew seems to have blown the budget on the usual incendiary, explosive, blowing-up-fuel-truck-on bridge, burning clothing gimmicks that are by now tired at best.

Wesley Snipes tries to save this tale of a war veteran at odds with his conscience over duties performed while on duty who accidentally becomes involved in a caper involving bad guys and injectable drugs so evil that they threaten to be give the owner of the drug complete control over everyone's mind. Mistaken identity, good guy with guilt becoming a transient bad guy under drug influence under chase by the drug lords, CIA, FBI, and police (who just happen to be on Snipes' side for reasons less dramatic) - all of these are thrown into the blender and out comes soup.

The supporting cast has some familiar faces - Jacquelyn Obradores (NYPD Blues), Vincent Riotta ('Under the Tuscan Sun', 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin'), Adewale Akinnuoye-Abaje (remember Adebisi in 'OZ'?) and given the pedestrian script, these and others give good performances. The problems (and there are many) include out-of-focus camera work to make us 'feel' the effect of the drug injected into Snipes' character and the imagined vs real footage that intermingles at a maddening rate to clutter the progress of the action.

A film for those who love Wesley Snipes and for those who can buy into yet another mindless action flick. Grady Harp",1102291200,2,1600,5.030188679245283

2156811,4,B00061I294,"Snipes plays an ex spec ops officer trying to cope with the loss of one of his men (who happens to have been his best friend).  They were captured and Snipes was forced to make the ultimate decision - either let his friend die by being burned alive, or give him the order to step off a stool and hang himself.  Snipes was forced to give the order to step forward and has never forgiven himself since.

His love interest, his friend's sister, doesn't know the circumstances behind her brother's death, but insists that Snipes visit a focus group to try and deal with the loss.  Snipes tries, but he ends up calling her and asking her to meet him at a diner so he can finally tell her what really happened to her brother.

Snipes shows up at the restaurant early and is mistaken for another man.  CIA operatives shoot him up with an experimental hallucinogenic drug that kills the victim in 6 hours, but makes them highly succeptible to suggestion.

As it turns out the CIA made a big mistake and Snipes escapes from the facility.  The rest is a cat/mouse chase and a race to find the antidote before it's too late.

By today's standards this is a tame movie, but if you're a fan of Wesley Snipes you'll enjoy this film.  It's low budget, but it's a lot better than other offerings I've seen.  It's popcorn entertainment, but don't expect any big fights or a lot of action---something they could've elaborated on a bit.

He is injected with a powerful hallucinogenic drug which works off the power of suggestion.

Thank God he now has the The Blade Trilogy (Blade/ Blade II/ Blade: Trinity), otherwise we would be seeing him in a lot Movie-to-TV or DVD movies.

To be sure, there were some cool fights, but long, tedious scenes of the ""top bad guy"" yelling at his inept henchmen and plot over-development kept the fireworks from happening until the end and even that was a little weak and stunted.

The plot device that kept getting in the way was the hallucinagenic drug theme. Snipes' character, Dean Cage, is injected with a drug that makes him believe he's in a past combat situation and his friend is in danger. Any suggestion is automatically believed - at one point he's told ""You're on fire"" and immediately we see his legs burst into flame. That was sort of neat, but they bang on this drum and rely on the theme that Cage is a poor hapless dupe so much - so sad for a renter who expected to some serious ass-whooping.

8036397,3,B00061I294,"In a way, Wesley Snipes has both the best and worst luck when it comes his direct-to-video output, and ""Unstoppable"" is a good example: while it looks great from a technical standpoint, it's lacking in action. I have a feeling that Snipes was concerned about maintaining his image as an A-lister and wouldn't be caught dead in something that's blatantly low budget. Personally, I wish he had tried the reverse at some point - starring in a movie that's B-grade in appearance but excels in the action department (can you imagine him being directed by Florentine?). Still, I need to take what I can get, and all things considered, this flick isn't half-bad as a thriller.

The story: when deadly arms dealers misidentify ex-CIA agent Dean Cage (Snipes) as a threat who might endanger their upcoming transaction, they inject him with an experimental, weaponized hallucinogen. Drifting between reality and his traumatic past, Dean must put an end to his attackers' scheme if he hopes to lay hands on the antidote.

The plot is among the film's strongest points. The filmmakers do a great job of depicting the hero's disorientation and anxiety, with some surprisingly adept editing that weaves together the present and his memories as a POW. Snipes shows off his acting ability by layering the role and successfully infusing some believable humor into his performance. The screenplay unfolds respectably, with few surprises but with enough opportunity to get its characters across, particularly Jacqueline Obradors (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NYPD-Blue/dp/B00OAIHIQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NYPD Blue</a>) as Dean's surprisingly active ally. Disappointingly, it does not really do the same for lead villain Stuart Wilson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mask-of-Zorro/dp/B000ARXF96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mask of Zorro</a>), who performs well but is a fairly bland bad guy.

Production values are high, and there are next to none of those ugly DTV snafus to be seen - truly, the movie's just a step away from looking as good as any Hollywood production. But again, it has nowhere near the action output one of those would have. When it comes to substantial scenes, I counted one karate fight (a decent but one-sided bout), two or three shootouts, and one scene wherein Snipes hangs off the body of a fuel truck as it threatens to tip off of a bridge; the rest of the action is just a bit of odd gunfire, a rare stunt (check out that motorcycle crash), and occasionally Wesley will punch a guy when he's not too busy. If the movie were half as long as it is, this offering would be fine, but presently, it could definitely use a few more fights or other thrills.

I don't know whether Snipes will be able to recapture the quality of action he exuded in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade/dp/B0007WFX62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade</a>&nbsp;movies (in actuality, he released the third installment right after this one), but ""Unstoppable"" helped set the tone for his DTV films to come, and I'm still waiting for him to do better on a smaller budget. This film will probably satisfy fans and serve well enough for a slow Friday night, but consider it a rental and save your money for the day that Snipes fully lives up to his title of action hero again.",1420761600,2,3394,5.386064030131827
