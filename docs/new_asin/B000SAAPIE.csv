8204879,4,B000SAAPIE,"Quality was a bit disappointing , but story was good  Ending could have been better",1449014400,,83,4.533333333333333
8204880,5,B000SAAPIE,"Simple innocent story and with Mark Twain's writing, it's a winner.",1436918400,,67,5.181818181818182
8204881,2,B000SAAPIE,"This video was bad!  I was hoping to replace a VHS video I recorded many years ago with a higher quality DVD.
I can't believe this was from the film, it appeared to be a copied VHS tape and a bad copy at that!!
The overall contrast was poor, and the resolution was terrible; my old off the air version was much better!",1424131200,,318,4.0476190476190474
8204882,4,B000SAAPIE,"This is a lovely story. I specially enjoyed the images of the steamboat going along the river at sunset, beautiful views in colorful shades. It's a pity that the film is lacking in definition. But I enjoyed it. That's why I rated it FOUR STARS",1384473600,,243,4.4222222222222225
8204883,1,B000SAAPIE,I have used a version of this dvd many times in class.  Which is how I know that this is a TERRIBLE dub - fuzzy and the picture strobes at times.  I have played it on several different players and it is only a little less terrible if I put it in one with a filter and upgrade.  I am very disappointed and quite angry to have paid $22 for what looks like a cheap copy from an old vhs.,1374192000,,383,3.7625
8204884,1,B000SAAPIE,"this is a really bad copy of a VHS tape to DVD, i mean really bad.  the picture is horrible and there is no ENGLISH closed captions for the hearing impaired.  I bought this so long ago as a gift for my husband who loves this movie and now i am stuck with it.  This just sucks.",1313107200,2,276,3.807017543859649
8204885,4,B000SAAPIE,"This is indeed an excellent adaption of Mark Twain's classic story.  Certainly the print quality is lacking.  I was surprised it was even used for a dvd release until I read the back cover, ""use of this video dvd is limited to libraries and educational institutions,"" so apparently it wasn't meant for retail sale, which probably accounts for the disappointing print.  Perhaps someday a new print will be struck.  Until then, this will do.",1255305600,6,439,4.891891891891892
8204886,3,B000SAAPIE,"Four stars for the movie, two stars for the poor transfer to DVD.

I have this on VHS tape and liked it so much I thought I would give the new DVD release a try.  Unfortunately, the DVD transfer is no better than the VHS tape.  Robert Lansing and David Knell (the kid playing young Twain) are good.  The story is great and the production is good.  Too bad the transfer is so poor (low resolution, washed out faces).",1241740800,9,415,4.2025316455696204
