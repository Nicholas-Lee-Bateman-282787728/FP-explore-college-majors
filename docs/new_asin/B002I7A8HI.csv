8636526,5,B002I7A8HI,"Awesome music, used at our church's Bible School in 2012 and loved it so much we used it again in 2017.  The kids really like watching other kids on the DVD sing and dance to the music.  Some songs have a lot of words and moves but there are plenty of songs to choose from that have simple words to remember and simple moves that work for all ages.",1500768000,,348,4.028985507246377
