2653200,5,B000I5YCCY,"This movie is a bit different, giving laughs where you don't expect in a way you weren't looking for. Quality acting, beautiful location. A warm fuzzy movie with a gentle chuckle. I had seen it twice in the theater, and waited for it to come out on DVD. When it did, I purchased several for gifts, and have seen it three times now. I am already looking forward to seeing it again. The characters seem like real people and the story is certainly believable. The events in the movie could happen to anyone, but not in such an entertaining manner. I highly recommend this movie. Good for ""chicks"" or guys as well as a great family story. It presents a normal way of life for a group of present day Native Americans rather than some silly unrealistic representation. Not just for Christmas time, good year round. Excellent movie!",1168300800,6,825,4.581081081081081
2653201,5,B000I5YCCY,"This movie was beautifully made using everyday Native American people and a few great stars. The best parts were those with the young children, just regular kids. 'Christmas In the Clouds' brings back the true meaning of Christmas. Family & friends getting together, singing, music, sharing. (Not a mountain of presents for each kid that parents seem to put importance on these days.) It also was about healing of spirits, families, lives.  The rescue scene was filmed with real search and rescue folks too! All in all, a very warm and wonderful movie for all ages.",1167696000,,565,4.885416666666667
2653202,5,B000I5YCCY,"I've waited and am thrilled to see this available on DVD. The film is funny, charming , and all around good fun. It will be seen in our home for years. The soundtrack is great also. The cast is perfect !",1167436800,2,203,3.975609756097561
2653203,4,B000I5YCCY,"""Christmas in the Clouds"" was first featured at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. This film is light hearted comedy built in the tradition of Native American storytelling. The film had a limited release at the theatres, so I did get a chance to see it. After seeing the DVD rental, I definitely will add this to my collection.

  Ray Clouds on Fire (Tim Vahle) comes back to his Tribe's reservation after personal struggles off the reservation. He is hired as the General Manager of the Tribe's ski resort.  Joe (Sam Vlahos) is Ray's father who is exchanging letters with his pen pal Tina (Mariana Tosca) from New York.  When Tina comes for a visit at the same time as a well known travel guide (M. Emmet Walsh) a case of mistaken identity develops into hilarious scenarios.

  Ray tries to rally the troops to put on a good show for the travel guide so the resort can get a great review write-up. That's when the laughs start. But there is a relationship brewing on the horizon. And some tender moments are ahead. Not to be too serious though, funny characters are introduced throughout the film. Earl the vegetarian chef (Graham Greene) and Mary (Sheila Tousey) make a noticeable standout.

  Robert Redford's Sundance ranch is the beautiful backdrop for this film. The film captures the resort brilliantly and character is built smoothly. There are many Native American supporting actors that blend well in this film; Wes Studi (Himself), Shirley Cheechoo and Warrior Mouse. I have to make a special note for Inuit singer Karina Moeller of Pamyua who makes a special appearance that might make you shed a tear or more.

  This is great family holiday movie. It is not just a Native American movie but a movie that everyone can relate to.  The one thing that could have been developed better is the time lapses. But I still would like to see more films from writer/director Kate Montgomery. The DVD contains the Trailer, Reviews and Rewards and Photo Gallery.",1165449600,7,1960,4.757396449704142
2653204,5,B000I5YCCY,"This is a cross generational film, grandparents can take the grandkids and everyone will leave the theater revived and sore at the sides after seeing a good old romantic comedy with great twists. It was refreshing to see an uplifting Native American film for once. The leads Tim Vahle and MariAna Tosca were a pleasure to the eye and show great talent along  with old favorites Graham Greene and Shela Tousey . Our family looks forward to seeing more of Kate Montgomery's talent on the silver screen",1164758400,6,499,4.735632183908046
2653205,5,B000I5YCCY,I was lucky enough to see this movie in the theater. It was on a day that my best friend and I were both very sad. When we left the theater our cheeks and our stomachs hurt from laughing so hard. I don't understand why more movies like this one aren't made. It is amazingly funny and creative. It has a very talented cast and I would love to see a sequel.,1164585600,6,355,3.9444444444444446
2653206,5,B000I5YCCY,"I was lucky enough to see this film at a packed screening. It is a wonderful tale of romance and mistaken identities.  And unlike most modern romantic comedies the jokes don't seen forced or clichd. This film is absolutely beautiful in every aspect and i am very excited to add it to my DVD collection. Although this film is holiday themed, it is one that can be watched at any point of the year and loved over and over again. This film is a major success for newcomer Montgomery,  and I hope to see more of her work. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to smile and feel good about a movie and themselves.",1164499200,6,618,4.318965517241379
2653207,5,B000I5YCCY,"A standing ovation at the Santa Fe Film Festival -- I've been waiting for years to see it available on DVD. It got only limited release, perhaps because its cast is mostly Native American and exhibitors expected it to have a small draw. But in fact the story is a universal one, full of terrific characters and charming substories - my favorite is the chef who tries to talk diners out of eating meat dishes. The story is about a Native American-owned ski lodge crew that is praying for snow and publicity to keep them in business. When an attractive young woman is mistaken for a reviewer whose approval is essential, and she falls for the hunky lodge manager (and vice versa), things get romantic and funny. Even the last line of the movie is funny.",1162512000,48,751,4.529411764705882
2653208,5,B000I5YCCY,"A brilliantly funny independent movie filled with memorable characters who behave with the unpredictability of real people.  Filmed in late 2001, it won multiple awards at film festivals before being polished and released in 2005- again to positive critical reviews and very enthusiastic audience response.  (It was held over at many of the art theatres that screened it.)

The film's central conceit- a comedy of errors featuring a mostly Native American cast- establishes a familiar set of expectations that the characters then confound.  (The airport scene, for example, which seems about to land in cliche, veers off in a surprising manner.) The cultural setting (with Robert Redford's Sundance standing in for a reservation resort) provides an exotic yet specific context. Serious issues are handled lightly in which serious issues are handled lightly.

The obvious comparisons for the film are ""Local Hero,"" ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and, most recently ""Little Miss Sunshine.""  Like those films, CITC depends on an ensemble cast, lots of background detail, and most of all, at the center of everything, the often missing element that largest budget in the world can't buy: heart.",1159574400,26,1186,5.315508021390374
2653209,5,B000I5YCCY,"How many times can we all watch ""It's a Wonderful Life""?  I've probably hit my lifetime limit, which is why I was so excited to discover ""CHRISTMAS IN THE CLOUDS"" as a fresher ""feel-good"" holiday treat.  There is no way to not enjoy this film, which is probably why all of the USA's lead reviewers have given it glowing ""thumbs-up"" reviews.  Don't waste time with a rental, buy this DVD now because you will definitely want to watch it several times this year, and every holiday season from now on!!  Happy Holidays to those who have watched ""CHRISTMAS IN THE CLOUDS!""",1159142400,26,568,4.594059405940594

2653215,5,B000I5YCCY,"A case of mistaken identity almost ruins everyones Christmas when the manager of a resort (Tim Vahle as Ray Clouds on Fire) is expecting a Travel Guide to secretly register then rate their resort.  Since they need a good rating, everyone is anxious to give the critic the best service possible.  Unfortunately, no one was expecting a grubby boozer (M. Emmet Walsh as Stu OMalley) to be their man.  Instead, they latch onto a sophisticated young woman who shows up with a secret agenda of her own.  She wants to meet the pen pal shes been corresponding with.  Things get complicated immediately when she mistakenly believes the son of her pen pal is her pen pal.  Instead, he is the resort manager who thinks shes the critic they all need to impress.  With everyone working at cross-purposes, do they really need anymore complications?  Try dealing with a chef (Graham Greene) pushing vegetarian meals on the guests by telling them sob stories about the critters they're eating (the turkey was a pet, you're eating Kevin).  As if that wasn't enough, they need snow and it won't snow.  And then it snows and that causes an even greater catastrophe.  Its just one thing after another!

Hilarious.  Graham Greene and M. Emmet Walsh are perfectly cast in the funniest roles.  I watch this movie every Christmas.  It always cheers me up.",1450396800,4,1331,4.776315789473684
2653216,5,B000I5YCCY,"I love this movie and watched it twice yesterday while I was putting up our Christmas tree.  It is one of my mother's and my favorites so I ordered her a copy for a Christmas present since she won't be with me for the Christmas season this year..  It is HILARIOUS and touching without being mushy.  It's safe enough to have on while kids are in the room........no swearing, violence, etc,, just fun and humor.. (There is one suggestion of a sexual encounter, but there is nothing explicit or exposing.)  I stumbled on this movie a few years ago in a Family Dollar store's bin of movies and took a chance on it and am so glad I did. (And yes, I tried to find it at Family Dollar and every other store THIS year, but the only place I was able to find it was on amazon.)  If you have any questions about it. I'll be happy to answer if I can. I wouldn't call this a Christian Christmas movie, but I would consider it more Christian than ""Rudolf the Rednosed Reindeer""  or ""The Grinch"" or anything in that ilk.",1449273600,2,1005,4.2356020942408374

2653227,4,B000I5YCCY,this is geared more to native comedy so do not know if that translates well to non natives. I probably enjoyed because i like the actors and because my sister loves this at christmas time.,1392422400,,188,4.4
2653228,5,B000I5YCCY,Endearing characters.  Sweet story.  Just enough twists and turns.  Nice balance of comedy and romance without being mushy or dumb.  One of my favorite Christmas movies.  Graham Greene is hilarious!,1390435200,,198,5.466666666666667
2653229,5,B000I5YCCY,"The first third is a bit goofy in places, but overall this is a very nice Christmas-time movie to watch (especially with friends and family who are not Christian but who may want to share in the festivity of the season.)

The movie does not have a religious slant, however the gentle and loving spirit of the Holiday is very much alive throughout!

Can't make up my mind whether to give it 4 or 5 stars.  On the one hand, fun as it is, it is not a masterpiece; on the other hand, we really, really enjoyed watching it!  What the hay!  It was a very good movie and we're glad we bought it and can watch it for years to come.  5 stars!

Producers, writers, director, cast, and all of you who had a hand in filming it:  Thank you!  Job well-done!",1388966400,,743,4.13986013986014
2653230,5,B000I5YCCY,"This is one of my favorite movies.  The two standout characters are Mary, the main assistant to the hotel manager, and Phil, the handy man at the hotel.  Those two are a hoot.  And, as an avid romance book reader, I found it humorous to see how much of the hotel staff were into Indian romance novels.  Whoever wrote the script did a great job.  There were some poignant parts to it as well.  All in all, I loved the movie and it was a special treat to see Indian actors involved in the project.  It'd be nice to see more movies concerning native stories.  I highly recommend this as a Christmas movie or as a nice break from the hubbub of life.",1387670400,,645,4.186991869918699

Most romantic comedies are simply tepid romances- this one had genuine laugh out loud comedy. Plus the genuine romantic and poignant moments.  The characters were far more real than the standard formulaic Hollywood rom-com usually permits- we see here not just the main characters but how they relate to their families, friends, co-workers, etc.  Which is what makes the love story so much more genuine. In real life potential lovers are dealing with a lot more than each other- and this is certainly reflected in this story.",1279324800,,667,4.884955752212389

""Clouds"" has a mostly Native-American cast, while ""Eden"" has one pivotal Native-American character... so both films are noteworthy in that regard.  And both are very, very funny... and have people who you wish lived next door... or perhaps wish you could up and move to such spectacular scenic places to live and work in, and be around such nice folks!",1261699200,2,604,5.206185567010309
2653251,4,B000I5YCCY,"Yes, Christmas in the Clouds is set at a resort owned and operated by Native Americans, but as another reviewer noted, it's a universal story. (You will miss a wonderful treat if you let dated, stereotypical ideas about ""Indians"" put you off.) It also has the great good fortune to have been shot entirely in Utah, primarily in the gorgeous Wasatch Mountains at and around Redford's Sundance resort. (Locals and frequent visitors should get a kick out of seeing familiar venues.)

It's also a simple, formulaic story, but nevertheless, absolutely charming. The resort employees are all praying desperately for snow, and equally desperately for a good rating from the anonymous travel guide reviewer who is about to arrive unannounced for an evaluation visit.

From there on, if any plot aspect can be misunderstood, misrepresented, or misinterpreted by the characters, it is. If anything can possibly go wrong, it does. But the subtly funny characterizations transcend the predictable--yet not ridiculous--twists and turns of the plot, offerinig chuckles and even a laugh or two (the sub-plot of the romance novel is quietly hysterical).

The wonderful (and in my opinion, sadly underutilized) Graham Greene steals every scene that he is in, as the lugubrious chef forced to create, prepare, serve, and promote dishes that involve *shudder* dead animals.

My one quibble was the casting of Tim Vahle as Ray Clouds on Fire. He doesn't look like a Native American, nor was he believably cast as one. Although he was perfectly enjoyable as the beleaguered resort manager, valiantly juggling resort business and a personal life that's suddenly and (to him) inexplicably gone terribly wrong, I'd have prefered someone who is a Native American, or who at least is ""ethnic"" looking enough to pass for one.

All in all, I love this movie, and expect to enjoy it many more times in the future. If you're looking for broad, slapstick comedy, forget it. But if you love subtly funny, gem-like characterizations by even the smallest members of the cast, Christmas in the Clouds is for you!",1260057600,,2077,5.0791788856304985

The leading man and woman and the scenery rival each other in a contest to gain our focus. I'd call it a draw.  I love all holiday movies but this one was just different enough to make me want to watch it again. There were no slow parts and no graphic/sexual scenes so no one will be embarrassed if Grandma sits down to watch it with you. Kids might not like it due to the relatively mature subject matter (when compared to ""Rudolph...""), but there is nothing overtly  objectionable within.  I highly recommend this sleeper hit.

2653255,4,B000I5YCCY,"This is a nice little romantic comedy.  Nothing really over the top fantastic sticks out at me, a few very clever lines, and a warrior mouse, but it was a very nice story and it was enjoyable.  And thanks to Graham Greene very amusing.

Joe has a pen pal, Christina.  Ray is Joe's son, he runs the (Apache) tribe's resort and is expecting a hotel reviewer to come to the resort.  Christina - aka Tina decides to go incognito and meet Joe.  Joe is an elderly man, Christina is a young women, Tina thinks Ray is Joe, Ray thinks Tina is the Reviewer.  Graham Greene is the resort chef who is a vegetarian and thinks everyone else should be too.  His scenes are utterly delightful.

The movie has a number of other very memorable characters.  It was sweet, it was funny, and it was heartfelt and fairly realistic.  I did find myself tearing up - like most of the cast - when Silent Night was sung in a Native American language.  It is a very enjoyable movie to watch, a little of everything.",1225670400,,987,4.333333333333333
2653256,4,B000I5YCCY,"Who would have thought that Graham Greene could be that funny? (well, it was quite evident in Maverick with Mel Gibson or as Mr. Crabby Tree.)
But I really like this idea of Native people owning a resort like this.
This movie is just a feel good family movie as well as a romantic affair.",1213228800,3,288,4.254545454545455
2653257,5,B000I5YCCY,"This is an all-around charming holiday movie with a great cast and wonderful soundtrack.

The plot is not new, but the characters are interesting and make it fun to watch. All actors seem to enjoy their roles and there is good chemistry between them.

Overall a movie that makes me feel good every time I watch it.

Extra-points for Wes Studi's cameo appearance and Graham Greene as The Chef!",1203552000,,392,4.6521739130434785

2653259,3,B000I5YCCY,"My family and friends liked it. It was ok, not great. Thought it would have been more funny. Some of the funny parts were dull because of the characters. Anyway, it's one of the better Christmas movies out there.",1199318400,,212,4.461538461538462
2653260,5,B000I5YCCY,I really like this movie. So different from the hollywood junk released at Christmas. Very real and wonderful native american actors.,1198540800,,133,5.380952380952381
2653261,5,B000I5YCCY,"I was pleasantly surprised at this little clever movie that turned out to keep the attention of the whole family.  You feel as if you know the characters right off, and they are all a bit comical in a subtle way.
The setting of the breathtaking ski lodge in Utah is inspiring and uplifting.  The mix up of the identity of the real hotel magazine critic makes for some great action and dialogue.

I loved Graham Greene in this type of role as the Hotel chef.  The interaction of modern day Native Americans all pulling together to get the lodge up and running is so uplifting and heartwarming.  I like this movie especially at Christmas, but it is good all year round.",1196035200,,667,4.434426229508197

2653263,5,B000I5YCCY,"I love this movie and everyone I've shared it with were surprised to find themselves laughting at the humor in it. A silly film with a surprisingly wonderful plot.

It is especially good to see Graham Greene playing a fun part. I won't go into the plot because the whole movie comes together so well in the end, I don't want to spoil it. I just want to mention how refreshing it was to hear no bad language, see no violence and scenes left to your imagination like well written movies do.

I'm buying it again to have a backup - incase they run out like most movies do in this country that are written, directed and staring American Indians.
(use to be I'd find them on EBay from the U.K. but lately I've noticed more showing up on Amazon now - thank you Amazon)",1183680000,,762,4.248275862068965
2653264,4,B000I5YCCY,"This comedy is as gentle as a cloud, but has much more substance; mistaken identity,quirky characters, a bit of mayhem, and cute kids. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by a wide range of ages. It was great to see Native Americans portrayed in such positive and clever ways. Keep an eye out for the runaway mouse. He and the vegan chef provide some of the biggest laughts in this delightful comedy.",1171843200,4,400,4.418918918918919

2653267,5,B000I5YCCY,"Finally, a movie that isn't too much of anything--except for just completely enjoyable!  What this movie isn't:

Not too serious

Not too funny

Not too sexual

Not too hard to follow

Not too many special effects

Not too long

No hidden messages

No politcal agenda

...you get the idea.  If you want to sit back and watch a harmless holiday movie (not really what I would call a Christmas Classic, the holiday was more of a back drop and wasn't leaned on in any way for the story), and just be entertained without all the hub-bub then this is your movie!  The charaters are so easy to understand and follow and care about and the story moves along at a perfectly steady pace.  I never broke my spleen laughing but was happily amused throught the picture, which to me is a much greater feat for a movie!!!  Not sure what to compare this too, it really has an original feel to it and is definitely what I would call a hidden gem as far as movies go...it was SOOOOO nice to have watched a movie and been given that warm fuzzy afterwards. Thank you to the everyone that had anything to do with the production of this movie.",1168300800,14,1122,4.331730769230769
