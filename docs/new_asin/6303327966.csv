630261,4,6303327966,"Finally, a fun film without all of the sex, violence and profanity so common today. It a typical story of two people who find each other and work through their ups and downs to find their common ground and move forward. Albert Brooks plays AL Percolo, a baseball scout  with the New York Yankees who is sent to Mexico as a punishment for bringing poor players to the league. He is tired of seeing the non-teams play with women, children, goats.. and finally arrives in a small barrio where there is a King's entrance for ""Steve Nebraska - the greatest player that has ever lived....""

Steve Nebraska is played by Brendan Frasier in all of his boyish charm and innocence, or so it seems. As the story unfolds, we discover that Steve has some issues from his past and all of his power most likely lies in hidden rage and anger at an abusive father. Despite that, Steve gets a %55 million dollar contract with the condition that he begins to see a psychiatrist to assist with his issues. Played by the lovely Dianne Wiest, she is confused as to which of the two is more messed up! She is protective of Steve, yet understanding of Al, though she does not like that he only seems to be motivated by the money. This film was a light and funny story with some dramatic moments which in the end, leads to victory for both characters. It was a film that left me feeling happy!",1425427200,,1367,4.399209486166008

630326,1,6303327966,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The writing is horrible, the acting is horrible. Brendan Fraser is the greatest baseball player of all time. Every pitch is a bone breaking strike and every at bat is a home run. He is found by a down on his luck scout played by Albert Brooks. By the way, I believe that Fraser is intellectually disabled. For some reason, every woman he meets wants to bang him and nobody mentions the fact that he seems ""challenged"". The possibility that he could have sex does lead Brooks to tell him to use protection because sex is dangerous in New York, it isn't like Mexico. Wow.
The movie ends with horrible special effects and the worst baseball I have ever seen in a baseball movie. The way Fraser runs the bases looks like he is skipping while wearing a full diaper. He strikes everyone out with 100 mph pitches and hits the game winning home run. I really feel like this movie was written by either a 10 year old boy or someone who only exposure to baseball was the movie Ed.
If someone likes this movie, they are someone so innocent, they probably blush during NCIS.",1401667200,,1104,4.390243902439025

630334,2,6303327966,"Albert Brooks is a washed-up Yankee$ baseball scout who discovers a phenom (Brendan Fraser) in Mexico - a kid who pitches around 105 mph, but is also a Babe Ruth home run machine from either side of the plate.  I didn't expect a great movie.  Sadly, we didn't even get a decent one.  A movie with good acting, likeable characters, and so forth can make up for a bad plot.  But...

Acting and characters: I don't particularly care for Albert Brooks' twitching style.  Brendan Fraser was an annoying man-child whose tantrums got old.  Dianne Wiest was alternately understated and abrasive as the psychotherapist who has to certify that Fraser's character is mentally sound [which of course, he isn't].

And the real meat of my discontent: the plot.  First off - there isn't a plot so much as a sequence of scenes.  There's no payoff: Fraser doesn't experience a breakthrough; the therapy bit is dropped and never resolved.  Brooks doesn't evolve either.  The final sequence is a schoolboy fantasy of triumph but since there's no resolution, there's no emotional payoff either.

Now for the holes.  Brooks' scout has two kids go directly from recruitment (and one is a freshman in college) to major-league pitching in a couple months.  Sorry, they would start at A or AA at best, even if the club thinks they are fast-tracked.  They'd never throw an untried talent directly on the team.  The Yankee$ throw gobs of money at Fraser (George Steinbrenner in a vaguely amusing cameo says ""Pay whatever it takes"").  Why would they want a kid who pitches as well as hits?  In the American League, he can't do both.  The DH is expressly not allowed to be the pitcher.  Fraser keeps his mullet hairdo; Steinbrenner famously required his players to be clean-shaven with short hair, no exceptions.  Fraser also apparently never practices throwing, fielding, or batting, except in one five-minute scene where he throws one pitch.  In a parking garage and with Brooks, not with a team.

Then there's Fraser's debut in game one of the World Series at Yankee $tadium.  If he wasn't on the roster in the final month, he wouldn't be allowed to be on the team.  And how is he batting again, in ninth place?  See the DH comment.  The final at-bat is a Cardinal who ""hit five home runs in the playoffs""?  I doubt the manager would have played that hot a hitter in the 9-spot.  He isn't a substitution either; the commentator says he's 0-for-2 that night.

Skip this and watch any number of better-crafted baseball movies.",1313193600,3,2498,4.752913752913753

630426,4,6303327966,It starts out almost as a comedy but it turns dramatic halfway through. Definitely not on my top ten baseball movie lists but it is worth watching at least once. Brandon Frasier does a great job as does Albert brooks. Just seems like they switched writers in the middle of the show.,1173052800,2,282,4.4423076923076925
630427,4,6303327966,"This film was better than I expected. When I saw Albert Brooks in it I expected to see his usual self absorbed, neurotic, west coast Woddy Allen trip. No so. When I looked at the credits I noticed that for the first time (in recent memory) Brooks didn't write, direct, produce, in short forgo his usual Jerry Lewis routine of running the whole show. And in doing so he (excuse the pun here) hit's a home run! He's just great as baseball scout Al Percole who after failing to bring a winner to the Yankees is relegated to the Chili circuit as ""punishment"" from the Yankee general manager played wonderfully by Lane Smith. But instead of coming up with heartburn from eating the very questionable food (we see people down there chewing on animal legs at games) he discovers Steve Nebraska the greatest ball player since Babe Ruth played oustandingly by Brendan Fraser. Fraser matches Brooks laugh for laugh and in doing so the two make this a very entertaining movie. Not an easy thing to do considering there is not one love interest in either man's life. The movie rests squarely on the ""buddy"" formula which works very well here. In fact it's more of a father son relationship instead of a bonding buddy movie. So if you like quirky comedy's with the added benefit of a sports theme you're sure to like this one. So run out and rent.....no better make that buy The Scout. I'm sure you're going to want to ""catch"" this one again and again!",1122249600,,1439,4.538461538461538
630428,5,6303327966,"You don't have to love either Brendan Fraser or Baseball to love this movie! I should know, because I hate baseball, but love Brendan Fraser, and I may just be a tad bit prejudiced when it comes to him.

Although the scout is about Baseball, there isn't much involving the sport except for short blips of Albert Brook looking for his 'King Kong', and the ending sequince when Brendan shows us that he truly is the king of the field. Albert Brook is hilarous as the scout who is hunting for other new protege's for the Yankee's, and Brendan is the young man who he happens to find. In mexico that is. Why he's in Mexico, and  how he got there is never really explained. That and if the shrink is really his mom, or just a really concerned lady. Yeah, the story has its holes, but the comedy more than makes up for it.

I won't say anymore, more is less, and in this case its better just to see this movie than hear me explain it.

Let the game begin!",1114128000,2,949,4.197802197802198
630429,3,6303327966,"""The Scout"" starts out with tremendous promise and gradually loses steam as the plot loses focus and several loose ends are not tied up, but the movie's weakest element is its complete lack of authenticity with the baseball action scenes.  The project smacks of a Hollywood pitch that never got entirely thought through.

Imagine the filmmaker pitching the studio on this movie.  ""I've got Albert Brooks, and he's going to be a pompous blowhard of a Yankee baseball scout -- we've already got Steinbrenner on board, as long as he gets a cameo or two -- who uses his sarcasm to mask his underlying insecurity.  He snags a kid who he thinks is going to be the next big thing, so we get some classic Brooks wordplay, but the kid upchucks all over the pitcher's mound at Yankee stadium, so -- and get this! -- Brooks gets exiled to Mexico!  And after a while in Mexico, he meets the next great ballplayer -- this kid is Ruth meets Clemens! We've got Brendan Frazer -- he's the next big thing, too! -- to play the kid, with a great arm, but he's a loose cannon.  And he comes to New York to pitch for the Yankees!  So, it's Pygmalion meets Bull Durham meets Broadcast News, but it's got a heart.""

And that's as far as the story really goes.  The first half-hour of the movie is hilarious as Brooks rises and falls (one of the best lines of the movie, from the exec who exiles Brooks to Central-Southern Mexico), is, ""I thought about firing you -- this was better.""  And Brooks is probably the perfect actor to play an obnoxious New Yorker sitting next to a Mexican baseball fan who is eager to share his ballyard snack, a barbequed pig foot.

As long as Brooks is the focus of the story, ""The Scout"" works.  But unfortunately, the movie should have been called, ""The Scout and the Flake,"" 'cause Brendan Fraser's character, Steve Nebraska (what the heck kind of a name is that?), intrudes.  We never learn why he's playing in Mexico, or why he's such a flake, or why he alternates from clueless charm to near-murderous rage, or other similar things.  We also don't learn much about the appropriately-named Harriet Aaron, psychiatrist (Dianne Wiesst), whom we think could be Steve's long-lost mother after a couple of Harvard-related hints, but this goes nowhere.

But the movie is still working essentially in these scenes, if only through the strength of the actors -- this is a darn good cast.

The movie really falls apart during the actual baseball scenes.  Fraser is clearly an athlete (not everyone could pull off ""The Mummy"" the way he does), but he equally clearly not a baseball player.  His throwing motion is completely unbelievable for a guy who can supposedly throw 100+ miles per hour -- which the movie underscores by never showing a complete wind-up-to-catcher's mitt shot of Steve pitching.  Fraser's swing (he's also supposed to hit like Ruth) is also not up to par -- Kevin Costner, Robert Redford, Tom Berenger, and even Tom Selleck have all been much more believable at the plate.  The obviously-staged baseball scenes undercut the movie and wipe out whatever suspension of disbelief that you may have developed.

The movie also makes a strange decision at the end.  We get a long, drawn-out scene where Steve teeters on the brink of melt-down and Al Brooks tries to save him.  Ultimately, Steve ends up on the mound -- which should be the victory/climactic scene.  It's never been in question that Steve can throw and hit the ball with the best ever, so the victory was whether he could make it on the mound in the first place.  Instead, the movie extends the scene by showing (well, or nearly showing, since we never really see Steve pitch) Steve win the game in historic fashion.  This scene just jangled and reminded me that the action scenes are subpar.

Still, fans of Albert Brooks should enjoy this movie for what it is, and fans of young Mr. Fraser will not be disappointed.  Overall, a good acting effort with half of a film.",1095638400,,3952,4.631276901004304
630430,5,6303327966,"""The Scout"" is one of those movies that leaves you with a warm feeling in your soul after the video has been turned off. It is the story of a man who finds a friend and triumphs over his fears.
Al Percolo is a New York Yankees scout who is experiencing the worst luck of his life. When his boss sends him to Mexico on a grudge trip, Al discovers ""the greatest ballplayer that ever lived"": Steve Nebraska. Al manages to land a deal with Steve, but is fired while telling his boss about his great find. When the pair returns to the United States, Steve is promptly snapped up with a $55 million bid from the Yankees. Despite all his success, Steve's world is anything but the fairytale it appears to be. Steve has dangerous idiosyncrasies and an abusive past, which are uncovered as time goes on.
Brendan Fraser plays the part of the slightly eccentric, slightly insecure Steve Nebraska with astounding depth. Albert Brooks is perfect as the cheeky, unyielding scout.
However, Dianne Wiest is much too abrasive as Steve's psychologist, Doctor Aaron. She cannot decide who her character is. One minute she is speaking gently to Al, the next she is glaring and snapping at him. I'm afraid this psychologist might need a psychologist herself!
Despite the heavy subject material, the movie has its light moments. There are several comedic occasions provided by Steve's singing, and I must say, these points alone are reason enough to see the movie. Of course, there is also the inevitable victory, which makes everything beforehand worth it.
What is really refreshing about this movie is how clean it is. There are less than ten profanities in the entire film, and they are the only objectionable content.
""The Scout"" is simply a fine piece of work, and a wonderful trip to take from everyday life.",1057536000,6,1792,4.728434504792332
630431,1,6303327966,"Just so there is no mistake, this is THE worst movie I have ever seen. I have seen a lot of movies. I saw this when it came out. And still, 7 years later it holds this prestigious position.  I have to spoil a few parts of this film to make my point. Don't read on if you want to be ""surprised"" by it.
Lets start with the things that we know about the characters in the film by the end.
Albert Brooks is a washed up Baseball scout until he finds Brendan Fraser. He is really desperate to find his ""King Kong"" to bring back and show the world. Because of this he plays the mildly pathetic role of the pushy mentor. That's pretty much it for this textbook one dimensional character.
Diane Wiest is the psychiatrist that is introduced to help out Brendan Fraser's character since he has a few ""issues"". She cares for his well being, well, because she's a doctor. Oh and a woman, so of course she's motherly. Whatever. That's pretty much it for this ( also ) textbook one dimensional character. I think she has about 10 minutes of screen time. I think Steinbrenner had about 10 too.
There is a list of other curious characters that awkwardly stumble in and out of this story but I won't mention them here to save time.
Now lets get to Fraser's character. The things we know ( by the end of the film ) are that he is an inhuman pitcher. He knocks the catchers over with his awesome power. He hits every ball out of the park. He loves baseball. We figure out that he has abandonment issues mostly from the hints dropped early on. He avoids questions about his parents, he freaks out at the airport in New York when he loses sight of Brooks and begs ""don't leave me alone again"" or something equally obvious. And then of course because Diane Weist tells us this is so an hour into the movie. ""He has abandonment issues"" I think is her line. ""REALLY?"" was mine. She also informs us ( and Brooks ) that he had an abusive father with the deeply moving and poetic line ""I think he had an abusive father"".
Ok now to my biggest problem with the film. The questions that are NEVER answered about Fraser's character.
1. Brooks finds him in Mexico. We never find out why he is living there.
2. His parents are gone. We never find out where or why. No of course we never meet them. That would be to obvious.
3. He hates questions. He freaks out right from the start ""I don't like all these questions, I don't like answering questions"". We never find out why.
4. Woman walk by him and give him their phone number without ever meeting him. We don't know why. I guess cause he is cute. But this character point is never used again. With the exception of a woman that works for the Yankees who wants to take him home. No nothing ever comes of this. Well maybe it is so that Brooks can deliver the responsible social commentary ""You know you need to use protection?"". Kill me know.
5. Before he gets signed he says that he has no problem playing in front of people, big crowds or not. When he signs with the Yankees, he freaks out when asked if he is going to pitch this season. ""Oh... I .... I don't know about that"" he states. WHY?. You never find out. I guess its the abandonment issues. Whatever.
6. And now my favorite character trait. Oh god I love this one. He's really good at doing laundry. That's right. He knows all there is to know about doing laundry.
Laundry my friends.
You know this because he tells you so in one scene. How does he know so much? you ask. That's right, you never find out. Amazing.
This movie actually sucks the quality out of all other movies. It is the movie that I gage all other movies by. In that respect I suggest you see it too. Every thing you see after will at least be better than this one.
A final note, just so you know I'm not the only one that thought this movie stunk. This movie was actually made in 1988 and shelved by Fox. It only saw the light of day because of the baseball strike in 1994 to try to recoup loses.",982022400,12,3942,4.221192052980133
