The problem seems to lie in Buster's intake making the stage banter a bit self indulgent
and less witty than usual. If you want to take it as a document of Buster's basic stage show without visiting you tube it may be fairly close. If you want a brief,silly demo of a Godin Multiac guitar synth it's interesting enough. If you want confirmation that Buster was streets ahead of everyone else even when he was on the tear,look no further",1413244800,,696,4.760330578512397
8156908,5,B000KHX7QC,"Be warned; the sound quality is absolutely horrible. It was recorded in a Nashville bar, and I'm pretty sure they dragged a drunk in from the alley to run the sound equipment. It's muted, thumpy, washed-out and unclear. Coupled with ""Pearl's"" (Buster's Godin guitar) nasally piezo flatulance, he might as well have been playing bongos.

It's heartbreaking. I knew Buster well, and he HATED this tape/DVD (it was originally issued on VHS video). He was always his own worst critic, though, but I really enjoyed the performances. The best parts are the three duets with Thom Bresh, which are some of the very best guitar playing ever captured on film.",1361318400,,649,4.9
8156909,5,B000KHX7QC,This guy is fantastic! I've never heard finger style rag guitar played at this intensity before. Chet Atkins is right saying Buster is the best fingerpicker he's heard since jerry reed! Just Fantastic!!,1172361600,3,202,5.151515151515151
