4456313,2,B004QXJZXK,"We feel a little ripped off as only 5 episodes were new.

We had bought a Season 2 Disc 2 locally in Australia months ago and on receiving Season 3 found that the majority of the episodes were on that Disc 2.

So be careful when buying Season 3 if you also bought the separate Season 2 Disc 2.

In saying that, the 5 new episodes were very good. This is a series we particularly enjoy: good development of key characters and some compelling story lines.",1310169600,,453,4.244186046511628
4456314,1,B004QXJZXK,"I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. I love the series and eagerly anticipated receiving the third season.

When I received it I found too my dismay that season 3 contains episodes from season 2. And not the full list of season 3 episodes.",1309910400,5,250,4.681818181818182
4456315,5,B004QXJZXK,Have been hooked on this Show since watching for the very first time. Drama just keeps getting better! The actors do a splendid job for each and every character; you really care about them. Hope this Show goes on and on and on.,1308355200,,227,4.3023255813953485
4456316,3,B004QXJZXK,"I've been watching Flashpoint on Netflix because I wanted to get caught up and start watching season 4. I missed most of seasons 2 and 3 because I was attending band camp.  So after watching up to the episode ""Acceptable Risk"" on Netflix, I decided to buy all three season, because I absolutely LOVE this show!  So today, my DVDs come in the mail and I immediately go to the season 3 DVD so I can watch the next episode.  To my disappointment, the last episode in the season three DVD is ""Acceptable Risk.""  This greatly saddened me and now I have to go find another place to watch the last episodes of season three. :/  If you're looking to buy ALL the episodes from season three, look somewhere else.  Although, if you're content with just buying up to ""Acceptable Risk"", buy all three seasons from Amazon :)  Nevertheless, I'm glad I now have them on DVD so I don't have to wait for Netflix to load :D",1307664000,20,904,4.345238095238095
4456317,1,B004QXJZXK,"What a disappointment! I've been an avid follower of this drama and have series 1 & 2. When I saw that Series 3 was available I immediately purchased it. I started to view the DVD & thought that I must have unwittingly imbibed some hallucinogenic potion prior to viewing. Talk about dj vu! The 1st story titled ""One Wrong Move"" commenced and I thought ""I've already seen this!!?? WTF is going on?"". I then looked at the episode listings on Wikipedia & compared the episodes in Seasons 2 and 3 with what purports to be Season 3 on this DVD. It is, in fact, a mash-up of the episodes from the latter part of Season 2 with various episodes from part of Season 3 and not even in the sequence in which the episodes went to air. Briefly, this DVD is a complete dud and the ""Third Season"" labeling is an outrageous misrepresentation and is bound to be a bitter disappointment to those who have followed this series from its beginning.",1307145600,11,927,4.426900584795321
4456318,5,B004QXJZXK,"My whole family is a huge fan of this show. It offers much more than other tv dramas, in my opinion.
They keep it clean, unlike Grey's Anatomy and other sleazy shows like that.
Love, love, love this show! **The writers are wonderful**. Glad to have the 3rd season out now!
This show has a lot of humanity in it, which I think makes it special.",1305504000,17,343,4.212121212121212
4456319,5,B004QXJZXK,"Simply saying how great this show is is a tremendous understatement. From the end of the very first season I'm always left wondering if it'll return for another season and am always greatly pleased when it does. I became a ""fan"" of this show on Facebook, and there was a 5 minute clip previewing the upcoming season. At one point in it the cast and the producers explain what the word flashpoint means (I had always wondered why the show was called ""Flashpoint"" and never understood why). So when they said that it has to do with the moment in which the decision is made about what to do in a situation, it made perfect sense. It's that sort of thing that I think makes this show so great. The decisions this team has to make at the time of the ""flashpoint"". Some people might get caught up in the fact that this show is or should be all about taking down the ""bad guys"" but if those people looked more closely they'd see this show really has to do with how these calls affect the team and their own lives. The Season 4 premiere episode ""Collateral Damage"" is a great example. You've got a guy who has been accused of killing his 6 month old daughter and on the other side you've got SRU Ed Lane trying to deal with his wife and her pregnancy. By the end of the episode when you find out what really happened to the 6 month old baby, you also start to see the *possibility* of what Ed might have to go through with having a new baby and the positives and negatives that come with having a baby.

And, to the other customer who reviewed this show, as much you want to think everything is black and white when it comes to shows like this, nothing is EVER that simple. The world in general is not a black and white world and DOES have many shades of grey.",1304812800,32,1752,4.214285714285714
4456320,2,B004QXJZXK,"It's like a cheesy attempt at making a Canadian version of Southland. The show had such good potential, but instead it's turned to some whacked out Hollywood spin on how bad guys really aren't so bad and every situation can be handled with words. The producers need to take a good dose of reality; School shooters, gang bangers, and bank robbers aren't the good guys, there is rarely any mercy shown to bystanders, and certainly not to Police (especially SWAT, SRU, ect).

Secondly, what is with these guys and Afghanistan vets?! They must've killed off like five of them within the first three seasons alone! It portrayed Veterans as volatile human beings who would kill innocents because they were pushed into combat. If I were a Canadian veteran, I would be absolutely PISSED at the creators of the show; they receive enough bad publicity as it is, but now they get to be publicly shown to be a menace? come on.

 The majority of the episodes found the SRU doing jobs that normal police officers would handle in the US; domestic disputes, shots fired in a residential area, ect. and to be frank, it got old. Now, I'm American, and I see no reason to make a show about an elite group doing a job that an average joe could do. That being said, maybe the Canadians do it differently, however, it still makes for a lousy episode.  When the screenwriters actually came up with a good plot, it was botched by all the touchy-feely crap that plagues pacifists in the film industry.
 For example, the episode called ""Perfect Storm"" in season 2 (yes, i know this is season three, however the style never changed), a highschool student was being bullied and went over the edge. In the US, these situations bring up violent nightmares known only as ""Columbine"" or ""Virginia Tech"", and spark mental images of a psychopath gunning down waves of helpless innocents. Down in cowboy-land, we've learned through experience that psychopaths cannot be stopped by the pathetic whining of a child.  Apparently, the Canuks never got the memo; the antagonist isn't really a ""bad guy"" even though he's shooting unarmed kids in a school, and the Police don't really seem motivated to stop it right away. Instead, they talk it out with the kid and he ends up putting the gun down, right before getting shot by another cop who had a kid in the school. Really? I'm all for fiction, but there has to be even the SLIGHTEST bit of reality involved. Another comparable episode would be the season 3 ""Acceptable Risk"" with NCIS's Lauren Holly.

Lastly, do they really treat their COPS like criminals in Canada? You'd think they did something wrong by shooting the bad guy..

PS. I've seen it on netflix, so don't go nuts about me ""not purchasing it from amazon""",1304121600,6,2730,4.684759916492693
4456321,5,B004QXJZXK,"I truly agree, this show does not get the respect it deserves.  It should be a full time, prime time show. It is real and beliveable. It deals with what the individuals go through as police officers on the job and how it affects their home life. It shows them as caring human beings with feelings, who do make mistakes. The actors are fantastic, especially, Enrico and Hugh Dillon.

It's not phony in any way.  Most shows on TV are for 17 yrs. and under.  I can't understand why CBS or any other station will not pickup this show permanently. Is it because it's from Canada or are they aiming for the simple minded?

Who wants to watch all these mindless shows or reality shows.",1287446400,8,678,4.392

It is a shame that we can not have this kind of police units in the United states, I guess that we would rather have
the bad folks pampered at a cost of about 100 K a year.  Seems that Canada knows that a 50 cent bullit can
be the better for all than loking up the perps.

4456377,5,B004QXJZXK,"Flashpoint was a amazing TV Show.  Unlike other Law Enforcement Dramas, Flashpoint really looks to the psychological toll the job takes on officers, and delves into why these ""subjects"" do what they do.  It shows how a series of events leads up to someone commiting, or threatening to commit a violent act, that the Strategic Response Unit (SRU) to be called in.  Quotes said on several episodes include, ""He's a subject, not a perp,"" ""Easy, this all about finding a way home! We all want to go home!"" and ""Let's Keep the Peace.""  Perpetrators are treated like human beings who had something happen to them, not some evil person who is some lesser being.

My only gripe is that it portrays police work as a total downer with no success stories every occurring.  In the real world, sometimes the cops reflect on their day feeling good about saving a life, stopping a bad guy, or whatever.

Tense action, tight editing, fast moving, but also a lot of profiling and psychological intervention.

The show is about the police strategic response units (SRU) which are responsible for high-risk situations that can not be resolved by regular law enforcement. It not only shows what they do but it also shows the emotional toll this kind of work has on law enforcement when they need to use force to defend against evil & criminal actions & the guilt that comes with it. I found that this show to be grounded in moral motives & family values. Also, enjoyed 'The Unit' (also on CBS).",1458000000,2,580,4.471698113207547

4456737,4,B004QXJZXK,Admirable characters. Good guys risking life and limb to help people keep theirs. Esprit de corps among the elite. Nothing ambiguous about the good guys on the team. Old fashioned heroes but modernized a little with some personal woundings on various levels mostly as the price they paid to serve the community. There's something extra engaging about taking the moral high ground and putting your body on the line especially knowing that the world can bring danger anytime. They're the ones you would want to have within earshot when encountering bad situations. You will be taken where the action is in this show.,1441065600,,614,4.970873786407767

And Realistic
The Cast are all great , The scenarios real , and the Director has been doing a terrific job . They must have good advice from active Law Enforcenent to be so realistic , plus it takes you into the Mindset of an officer when unfortunately has to take someone's life which is Not mentally easy , even if it's justified and a bad guy . There are always second quessing yourself. But the Idea Of A Non Swatt Less lethal response unit is a Terrific idea ( Tactical Resonse Unit ) !

4456783,4,B004QXJZXK,"Flashpoint is very much a formula based drama in which an elite police unit tackles the really difficult situations.  Amazing how a show not even 10 years old shows how much technology has advanced yet given they use a lot of ""high tech"" gadgetry it is obvious when they don't have things like smartphones this was made during the previous generation of technology.  That aside it is entertaining and for a formula show does a fairly good job of keeping the stories diversified.  The surprising thing about the show is that as surface as it is in many ways, the episodes still have a way of getting to you as they write about some pretty raw emotional subjects.  In that way I think it is unique from all the shows I would put in the same category.  Not great, but definitely a unique twist on a tried and true show concept.",1434844800,,824,4.430463576158941

They deal with extremely high stress (flashpoint) situations but rate their effectiveness by how many lives are saved; the perpetrator, as well as the victim(s) and the team members.  It is the first police procedural show where I have seen such a consistent use of COMPASSION.  The drama & development of the team members is there as well as the action and tension required to keep your interest.

The only caveat is that a few of the characters you become enthralled with end up getting bumped off and replaced by dubious characters ... in the manner of the dimwit Bishop replacing Ziva on NCIS (can't bear to watch NCIS ever since ... but I digress).

4456940,5,B004QXJZXK,"I'm not sure why Canada seems to make the best television series, but they do  Flashpoint is a combination of good-old-fashioned blow 'em up police work coupled with a heart and soul.  The SRU's (Strategic Response Units) main goal is to neutralize a volatile situation.  By ""neutralize"" they mean talk first, when possible, take down their targets second.  This show highlights the human in all of us.  Maybe that's why it works so well...You're going to love the characters - Sam, Jules, Ed, Wordy, Spike, and ""Sarg.""  Their day-to-day work life coupled with the personal make for a well-rounded show.  I've watched this series from season 1, day 1...and it's definitely been time well spent watching the ""bood tube.""",1404604800,,719,4.991596638655462

It isn't about the action of some cool swat team, it's about the emotions they battle with and the emotions the ""criminals"" battle with. I put that in parentheses because what you find is the people in these crazy, wild hostage situations are regular joes just like you. Anyone can get pushed into irrational behavior.",1400803200,,632,4.807339449541284
4456949,5,B004QXJZXK,"Great storyline and amazing depth to characters! The show may be fiction but the true sacrifice made to protect and serve is very real, and exemplified through each character.

Emphasis is not made on the necessary violence, but more on the dilemma and decision-making that goes into situation.",1400803200,,294,5.125

Just a little repitition of scenarios, but overall a good mix..of course excluding Hollywood's aversion to radical Muslim terrorists.  They lost track of a new member of the team (Leah) who just disappeared with no explanation never to return...at least through most of season 4 at least.",1400025600,,405,5.029850746268656

The writing is very creative, the acting excellent, the realism good without sensationalism. The opportunities to see characters depicted who are both tough and vulnerable, effective but fully human, with strengths and vulnerabilities on display is very refreshing. Some of the episodes have been profoundly moving and heart-rending, catching people who are, well, at their flashpoints!",1398902400,,500,5.5064935064935066

4456957,5,B004QXJZXK,The characters are what makes the series interesting.  The leader has flaws as do all the members of the team.  Yet they manage to handle each crisis professionally.  They all have input into possible solutions for each situation and they show willingness to listen to all ideas.  I can watch each episode and enjoy the the friendships develop.,1398124800,,344,4.879310344827586

4456985,5,B004QXJZXK,"My wife and I decided that this show didn't do well because it hit people too close to home.  It dealt with real issues, not only in police work, but in regular folks' lives (just much more intensely because it had to do with police).  From death of a friend to divorce, family, love - it didn't water down the pain or the consequences of bad choices, yet had a great mix of entertainment.

4456992,4,B004QXJZXK,"I'd seen seasons 1 and 2 years ago on a Chicago station carried by my cable company.  My cable co changed their lineup and dropped the station so I never saw another episode.  I was delighted to see this series available on Amazon Prime.  The casting is great and the characters multi-dimensional and engaging.  Overall, the scripts are well-written and the plots interesting.  This series is a Canadian production and it is interesting to watch how their version of a SWAT team handles different types of crises.

I've rated this series a 4* because it can get a bit touchy-feely and preachy at times.  There are viewers who may choose not to watch because of this minor flaw.",1392163200,,677,4.686440677966102

Flashpoint, on the other hand, is very intense and fast-paced but not dark like many of the BBC mysteries. You are on the edge of your seat until the last couple of minutes of every broadcast. The show is backed by an excellent ensemble cast and the story lines are unique.

A great series.",1388275200,,427,4.77027027027027

4457016,5,B004QXJZXK,"I discovered ""Flashpoint"" after its final season (Season 5). It is unlike any police/swat program filmed in the United States. It is a strategic, but compassionate showing of men and women in law enforcement. The ""team"" is completely professional, and experts in their fields, and yet they are completely human and show it.

4457020,4,B004QXJZXK,"I enjoyed it immensely.  Character development progressed rapidly but well. Characters who were not perfect,human and flawed but extraordinary.  Real life issues were addressed and shown to be neither all black nor all white.  Victim and perpetrator roles were mixed at times and showed both sides of conflicts.

4457028,5,B004QXJZXK,"From the beginning to the end of Season 3 there were no bad episodes.  Watching the more news-worthy episodes makes a person realize that even though one, or several, of the characters (due to personal feelings or beliefs) may not agree with the orders issued, those orders are followed to the letter.

I highly recommend this show to anyone who is a huge fan of cop shows.  It's kind of a cross between Criminal Minds (profiling) and S.W.A.T. (tactical).  Even though this has nothing to do with the review....Spike is adorable!  The ladies will love him :)",1382400000,,558,4.711340206185567

This show has heart and ots easy to care about the characters. Just enough attention is paid to their lives outside of work to keep you involved and not every case ends in a sniper kill. In fact a good half the time they avoid killing all together. I'd watch this show with my kids, aside from a couple romantic scenes that might be a bit much for my youngest.",1378512000,,506,4.28125

The dialogue doesn't sound scripted. Even the guest actors are amazingly believable. The scripts are well-written with scenarios that are probable. In every episode, I get involved. The characters have become more than just people on the screen, which means they are good at what they do. There have been some cast changes, but all have been with equally competent cast members, with the exception of one. Anyway, I couldn't recommend this show any more highly.",1371945600,,606,4.950980392156863

This show was not given a good run in Australia. It was put on ""as a fill in"" during off peak viewing times and I caught a few of the earlier episodes and could not get enough of this show.
I was so pleased when I saw that 3 seasons were available to purchase from Amazon.

It can even be fun to watch for that one spot where the title of the episode is used in dialog.

As with any series, there are some episodes that are ""less favorite"" than others, but they get watched anyway. There's just a lot being offered.",1316217600,3,516,5.204819277108434

CBS not airing this anymore is probably one of the dumbest moves since ending Numb3rs.  For this reason I refuse to watch anymore shows on CBS even if I also enjoy Criminal Minds, CSI NY and Blue Bloods.  I will watch Criminal Minds with Flashpoint on ION.
Also again CBS messed up the order of the episodes, as this is the end part of season 2 and the begining of Season 3 as CTV has made it.",1315699200,2,668,4.1953125
