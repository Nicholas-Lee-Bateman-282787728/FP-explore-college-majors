8688249,2,B00PJ8QZI4,"I bought this as a public service. It's just EIGHT-minutes. Yup! It's pretty short. I'm not certain if it contains ANY bonus material.
I bought a similar title that was a CARTOON of about the same length; at about the same price... voiced by two of my friends.
I'm buying this ""blind"". I'll ammend this review as a public service.
All I can offer---now---is what I read:
>>>>> Imagine the classic monster characters - Frankenstein's Monster, Count Dracula, The Mummy, The Bride of Frankenstein,
and The Wolf Man - in their first day of school, being taught by a genuine horror hostess: Ivonna Cadaver.

It'll be in my screening-room in a few days. I'll either ADD, or subtract STARS.
I HAVE and CAN do better make up than the characters in this SHORT subject.
THE comedy included a rip-off of Abbott & Costello's WHO's on FIRST?!

By The Way: W=H=Y would these----adult monsters----need to attend school, anyway?

MY RECOMMENDATION===> Since all the makeup, etcetera, was completed and the
camera worked... maybe the BIGGEST problem was the SCRIPT!",1447718400,,1655,5.151515151515151
