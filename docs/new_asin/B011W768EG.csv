8725160,5,B011W768EG,This video is Wonderful!  It is animated enough to teach and entertain my toddler girls.  The video repeats common words and phrases and allows enough time for our kids to repeat the words and phrases in between other words.  This video just gives a basic knowledge of each language but opens their minds up to paying attention to the world around them and others who may not be speaking English.  Great Learning Tool!,1502409600,,418,4.684931506849315

8725162,4,B011W768EG,"My kids love this video. They watch it often to get learn the visuals are not that fast, but enough to get the point across. The only part I wish is that you can set it in a loop of various languages so that they can hear more then one without me having to select it.",1480118400,2,267,3.7857142857142856
