8556078,3,B00AQ590LY,"The movie Angie was wonderful (loved Geena Davis!), Scenes from a Mall was OK ((if you like Woody Allen, and it was very typical of his movies), and Boys was not to my liking at all!",1405555200,,182,4.083333333333333
8556079,4,B00AQ590LY,Another good collection of movies! The main reason I bought this was because of the movie Angie which I did not have. Scenes From A Mall is awesome but now I have two! Great price!,1367539200,,180,4.171428571428572
8556080,5,B00AQ590LY,"This is a triple pack with an odd collection of movies to put together as there is no common theme between them.  I bought it because I was one of the few people who actually enjoyed ""Scenes From a Mall"".  It's not a Woody Allen movie, but he does star in it with Bette Midler.  They both play a rich, tacky and funny couple who live in the Hollywood Hills.  There kids go off on vacation and they spend the day celebrating their big anniversary. They head to the Beverly Center Mall in love only to find that they each have had affairs and cheated on the other.  They argue.  They make up.  They threaten divorce.  They make up.  They argue again.  You get the picture.  This all takes place in a mall, but I found it enjoyable and entertaining.  ""Angie"" was another movie I had wanted.  Geena Davis is a super great actress and creates this bubbly, quirky New York girl who finds she is pregnant with her longtime boyfriend since High School.  This pregnancy ends up changing her and her perspective on life.  She wrestles with a Mother she's hardly known and whether or not she wants to marry her boyfriend or raise her child alone after its born.  ""Boys"" with Winona Ryder was okay and its the movie in the pack that failed to fully hold my attention.  I like Winona Ryder, but the pacing was on the slower end to me.  You might like it.  Regardless, this pack is cheap and you get three good movies or in my case 2 1/2.  You're basically paying about $2 or so per movie.  That's less than a rental.  It doesn't come with any special extras, just the movies and that's fine with me for these particular films.",1365033600,2,1613,4.3244147157190636
