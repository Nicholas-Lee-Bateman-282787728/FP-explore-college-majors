8496193,5,B006BZ8NVQ,I like the sequences in the videos. It is just the right amount of time and addresses a number of poses.,1403568000,,104,4.0
8496194,2,B006BZ8NVQ,No labeling on DVD as to which session is on which DVD.Loses sound and halts during sessions. Unfortunately I didn't get all the way through the DVD's in time to return these. Better DVD's are out there especially at this price.,1398729600,,228,4.585365853658536
8496195,1,B006BZ8NVQ,"Utterly useless; would give 0 stars if I could.

The layout of the disks is completely illogical (perhaps based on space requirements) with no relationship to the days of the 30 or 90 day programs.  Perhaps I'm unusual, but if there is a 30 and a 90 day program, I would expect to need consecutive disks (or the same disks) for each of the days within the 30 or 90 day program rather than having to check which disk or disks are needed (which are not consecutive when more than one disk is need for a day's program).

For example, why would I want to sit through a review of every pose when it might be days before I need to do those poses.  Why aren't the explanations of the pose part of or preceding the program one is supposed to do for a day (or days)?

The calendar is a joke -- just shows you how many disks you have to swap each day, and is physically unwieldy because of its size, and would rapidly become dogeared and ratty, although one can download a page size version.

The sets are completely uninspiring, in fact rather depressing, as are the people in the videos.

Bottom line, without swearing inappropriately, I am hard pressed to describe how rotten and useless I consider this product.

The only reason I have not returned this useless product is because I am so lazy that it has now gone beyond the return period.",1389312000,4,1334,4.350806451612903
8496196,5,B006BZ8NVQ,I know it's pricey but it's 10 DVDs and the content and the packaging is very well made.  I love YJ DVDs so I bought it and glad I did.  Ten full length DVDs and basically looks like a big book on my coffee table.  Really good value and I have not even used all the DVDs yet but I have a few favorites already that I did try!,1380067200,,325,3.681159420289855
8496197,4,B006BZ8NVQ,"I purchased this set because I wanted to begin a daily power/vinyasa yoga practice, but my form was not good enough to pursue rigorous yoga without risk of injury.  The Yoga Journal was a great way to ease into daily yoga, at a slow enough pace and with sufficient guidance to develop proper form.  Jason Crandall's segments are particularly good in this respect.  Having made it through the 10 discs, I am ready for a more rigorous practice.",1374192000,2,442,4.641025641025641
8496198,3,B006BZ8NVQ,"I have been practicing yoga for a long time -- almost 3 decades -- but my practice has slipped away from me in recent months since I've gone back to school. I bought this because I thought--knowing myself--that it would be good to follow a plan, put a yoga schedule in my daily schedule in a doable way. I'm only in my first week, but so far it's been great, doable, the instruction is good, and just challenging enough. I didn't buy it to follow an eating plan--but since I love to cook I was very happy that it came with a recipe ""book"" (pdf). I was somewhat surprised, or even horrified, to see how much meat there is in this ""yoga eating plan."" Really? Wouldn't you expect that a yoga eating plan would be vegetarian? Very surprised, very disappointed. Considering that the program also includes a yoga history lesson audio segment, you'd think that the people who put this together were presenting authentic yoga practice, which to my mind, includes the practice of causing no harm to any living being.",1357948800,4,1007,4.569060773480663
8496199,4,B006BZ8NVQ,"Purchased this dvd set from Yoga Journal directly.  Discs 2,3&4 worked fine.  All the others were defective.  Sent it back for replacement.  Just received replacement and the same thing happened.  So disappointing because the dvd's that did work were wonderful.  Make sure to test all dvd's when rec'd so you can exchange them before the 30 days!!  Am going to try ordering from Amazon....maybe there was a bad batch that YJ is selling.
****UPDATE*****Turns out that certain Sony dvd players cannot read the discs for some reason.  I had tried dvd's on 3 of our sony dvd players (all the same model) and didn't work.  Purchased a Panasonic dvd player, popped them in and they worked.  The dvd's well worth the effort.  Love them!!  Glad I kept trying.",1332720000,13,751,4.78125
8496200,5,B006BZ8NVQ,"I can not say enough about this set.  I took a chance and it's wonderful.  It's book sized not DVD sized, has 10 discs in it and charts...and I have been following their 30 day plan so far.  I really love it and they made it seem so easy.  A real value for what you are getting.  Wanted to write a review for others who may be on the fence on this one.  I'm glad I got it.",1326931200,13,372,3.7051282051282053
