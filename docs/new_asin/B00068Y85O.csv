8040487,1,B00068Y85O,"Bad cinema fans take note-this film is a real contender for worst picture ever! ""Terror in the Jungle"" has no stars you would recognize, but when you have watched it you will never forget little Jimmy Angle and his magic stuffed tiger! Is it an airplane disaster movie, jungle survival adventure or a Peruvian travelogue? It's all three!

  Little Jimmy is on a flight over the Amazon jungle, on a plane loaded with lame characters, including a ""rock band"" (three scrawny  guys from casual labor in bad wigs), a mysterious woman with a suitcase full of money, a wise nun and a dead nun. Don't trouble yourself though, because they'll all be dead soon!

  Watch in snickering disbelief as Jimmy floats down the Amazon in a coffin, clutching his stuffed tiger and indulging in the first of many crying jags. Watch his tiger change inexplicably into a lion, a leopard, then back; sometimes dirty then suddenly clean. He gets captured by polyester-wearing Mayans, one of whom looks like a pudgy Don Johnson! You say you want cute monkey reaction shots? They're here too!

  The single funniest scene is when a priest, aiding Jimmy's father on a rescue mission, has to give up his robe and cross to their guide-he kneels for a moment of quiet, resigned reflection. There is the sound of a bell, not the somber BONNNNGG of a church bell, but the ""ding"" you might hear at a boxing match! Hysterical!

  If you're a fan of bad cinema, this is money well spent, 85 minutes of utterly sincere miscalculation. Until the UNCUT, UNCENSORED version comes out on DVD, this is a gem. Enjoy!",1115510400,6,1574,4.68
