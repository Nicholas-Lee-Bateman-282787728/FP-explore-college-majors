8492364,1,B000NDFHUC,"I can't give an accurate review on this movie, because there were issues with the movie via Amazon Instant Video player on both Roku and on the computer via amazon. When playing the movie, the picture froze just over half way through and held for approximately  20 minutes while the audio continued. It made my viewing of the movie unbearable to watch.",1364860800,,352,4.67741935483871
8492365,4,B000NDFHUC,"I saw this movie at SlamDance (a neighbor to Sundance) in January of 2006.  It's hilarious, quirky, and all-around fun.  Okay, your grandma might not enjoy it that much, but if you have ever been stuck in a dead-end job and felt your life slipping by, this is the movie for you!",1189209600,,278,4.326923076923077
