1009627,5,6305320179,"""The Rescuers"" is one of those polished gems that fell between the Walt-era blockbusters like ""Snow White"" and the Eisner-era blockbusters like ""Lion King"".  It's often forgotten when people consider Disney's animated films.  However, the quality is as good as any other Disney film, and the overall entertainment of the film remains as good as any.  The dragonfly steals the show, and Bob Newhart's voice over adds a bit of humor.  Two thumbs up!",1045353600,7,447,5.0

A very realistic portrayal of probably the state of every orphange in the world right now. Children will love this movie and give them an escape from the pressures of the normal happy go lucky life. Everyone roots for the kid in this movie all the way to the end, Meddusa and her sidekicks get whats coming to them at the end too, and the Devils eye diamond, bigger than the hope diamond, is put in the Smithsonian institue where it rightfully belongs. I first saw this movie when I was 8, with my bother(7) and my sister(11). We loved it and have changed so much since then. The 70's were really a magical time for kids then, as Walt Disney was really tearing up the scene, this movie also reminds me of Escape from Witch Mountain and the sequel with Kim Richards! Kim is trying to make a comeback which is good and she has kids too, Penny reminds me of Cinderella as a kid, and I really recomend this film to the poor children of the world, and children in foster homes and orphanages, and anyone who has a cat named Rufus!-God bless the kids in this world!-Love PENNY(Garry Hixon)",1015545600,5,1198,4.300884955752212
1009629,4,6305320179,"The Rescuers is Disney's most underrated work! It was the last great feature film before what became a strings of forgettable works like The Black Cauldron, The Great Detective, Oliver and Company in which the Disney studio was trying to break into new ground but somehow was unable to find the right formula. It wasn't until The Little Mermaid that Disney Studio has reclaimed it's number one position as the world's greatest cartoon creator. Having said that, The Rescuers Down Under- produced after The Little Mermaid - is a thorough disappointment, both in its story and in its style of drawing. This always seems to be the curse of sequels! The Rescuers, however, has all of the Disney's magic! Medusa is possibly one of the greatest of Disney's villains, yet somehow she doesn't catch on as did the others. T he only criticism I would make is the opening of The Rescuers. It seemed that the studio had run out of money when they were doing the opening scene, for all we have is a collage of storybook sketches from an artist's impression.",1013385600,22,1044,4.7103825136612025

1009631,4,6305320179,"""The Rescuers"" is one of the better later Disney movies before ""The Little Mermaid"". I think it had more heart than the other two Disney movies before it, ""The Aristocats"" and ""Robin Hood"". It also had a better story to follow. Miss Bianca and Bernard are two of the most memorable Disney characters ever. Their voices [Eva Gabor and Bob Newhart] are distinguished and perfect. There are more memorable characters in this movie than most Disney movies made at that time [the 1970s]. They include the villianess Madame Medusa, Orville the albatross, Evinrude the dragonfly, and, best of all, an orphan girl named Penny. Of all the Disney animated children, Penny has the most personality. I recommend this movie to any Disney lover.

1009632,5,6305320179,"The first time I saw this movie I fell in love with it, it bacme my favorite Disney film of all time. The two main characters Bernard &  Bionca were the most likable of all Disney characters & Madam Medusa  though not the most evil Disney villin was pretty scary. The story starts  with the kidnapping of young orphaned Penny who was taken straight out of a  public orphanege. When the authorites give up on her search the Rescue-Aid  Society which is run entirely by rodents decide to send two agents to find  her pretty Bionca volunteers at once and her chosen parter is Bernard  basicly the custodian for the Rescue-Aid Society.
The two find that  Madam Medusa, a pawn shop owner kidnapped the girl and has hidden her in  her boat which is located in a desserted swamp. The two mice fly to the  swamp on a gull were they find a young Penny trying escape the evil Medusa  put is caught by Medusa's pet crocadiles. Bernard & Miss Bionca  befriend a group of rodents who help the mice get on board the boat. There  they over-hear that Medusa kidnapped Penny so that she could get her hands  on the largest un-cut diamond in the world, the Devil's Eye, and that Penny  is the only one who can fit in the cave. When the two help Penny get the  diamond they call upon their rodent friends to help them catch & turn  Medusa over to the police.
The movie was followed by a sequel in 1990  ""The Rescuers Down Under"" which was probally the only ever decent  Disney sequel.",966124800,12,1465,4.359259259259259
1009633,5,6305320179,"After all of these years, Madame Medusa is still the scariest Disney villian hands down. Aside from the fact this film is overall darker than it's modern counterparts, I've always thought she was purposefuly drawn to resemble one of her beloved crocodiles. Even her bumbling co-conspirtor Snoops is more humane, and he is no model of morals either.
Whenever this film came on as a little girl, I could not watch it because it gave me night mares. Even if there were real kids who were in horrible (but obviously not the same) experiences, I had no way to relate to it. Yet looking back, it was a perfect offering for the decade.
I largely developed my current hypothesis about this film from realizing (as sad as it seems) compared to the nightly broadcast of the vietnam war and other urban/social programs---this WAS very kid friendly for it's time. In a time when American social protest was still very visible, the children's fare Disney itself had previously produced seemed outdated and simplistic.
It's also worth noting that efforts in locating missing and exploited children really did not begin until this time, even if it certainly was not Disney's intention to bring issues to the forefront. Again, the somber screenplay and emphasis on social justice owes much to the day's politics where many social safeguards we are accustomed to were non-existent.
The fact that Penny was adopted from an orphanage with little or no safeguards and subjected to such intolerable conditions for so long without any human contact other than the two creeps is another really telling area of the movie. To some extent it was hollywood dramatization, but to another extent that was how things were back then. Thankfully, world governmental bodies (such as the rescue aid society) are around.
Many years later, I like this movie, but am convinced it is more adult oriented. I am now fancinated by this screenplay and see something new each time I am watching. While it might not work for somebody accustomed to the light hearted nature of today's Disney movies, anybody willing to open their mind would love this movie.",964051200,27,2112,4.902234636871508

Telling the tale of two mice from the Rescue Aid Society who set out to rescue little orphan Penny who has been held prisoner by evil Madame Medusa. Easily of the best Disney animations since 1967's The Jungle Book and not surpassed, in my opinion until 1989's The Little Mermaid. With some great comedy moments and touching moments too, especially the beautiful song 'Someone's Waiting For You' sung by Penny as she loses faith in ever being rescued. Watch out for the great character 'Evinrude' the dragonfly, brilliant. It's no wonder this was my late mother's favourite Disney movie.

1009990,4,6305320179,"Despite my life long love of all things Disney, I didn't see most of the animated movies until I was in college or older.  I don't remember seeing The Rescuers until I was out of college.  It has some dated animation, but I find it charming and think most families will as well.

The movie opens with a shot of a little girl throwing a bottle into the water in a bayou.  As the opening credits role, we follow the bottle as it journey's up to New York City, where it is found by the Rescue Aid Society.

Now the Rescue Aid Society is made up of mice from all over the world.  As the message is read, Miss Bianca (voiced by Eva Gabor) the delegate from Hungry, volunteers to go.  This causes a hubbub since no woman has ever gone on a mission before (the film was released in 1977 after all), so it is decided she needs a co-agent.  She picks Bernard, the janitor who is afraid of most things (Bob Newhart).

Following the few clues they do have, this duo track Penny (Michelle Stacy) down to the Devil's Bayou, where she is being held by Madame Medusa (Geraldine Page).  Medusa wants Penny to find a special diamond for her in a tidal cave.  Will Bernard and Miss Bianca and some friends they make along the way be able to help them find the diamond and free Penny?

This movie feels a bit dark for a Disney movie, and I'm not quite sure why.  One reason is the lack of humorous sidekicks.  There are a few of them and a few comedic scenes (the pipe organ scene is a classic) but these scenes are also filled with suspense.  Of course, Disney movies have always had their darker elements, and this one isn't quite as dark as some of them, so kids should be okay with it.

Another reason it feels dark is the color pallet.  Much of the movie takes place at night, and that infuses all the colors of the film.  It's a very effective move that makes us feel the danger our characters are facing.

During the 1970's, Disney animation took a turn toward two dimensional backgrounds and even some watercolor.  That's absolutely in display here.  Actually, some of the watercolor backgrounds are strikingly beautiful.  It's a style choice that dates the movie, but it's not one I mind.  It takes some getting used to when compared to the later hand drawn movies and is certainly different than the computer animated movies we're used to now, but give it a chance.  Fans of Don Bluth won't be surprised to learn he was heavily involved in this film before leaving Disney to start his own animation studio since the style is so similar.

Part of that dark tone to me is the lack of magic.  Yes, the animals talk, even to Penny, but it feels a tad on the ordinary side.  That's not to say the movie isn't fun, but it doesn't quite capture the imagination as some of the other animated movies do.

So let's start talking about what works, because there is much that does.  The story is good.  While we see Penny at the very beginning, we don't find out for sure where she is or why she is there until Bernard and Miss Bianca do, so the first half feels like a mystery as they piece things together.  Then it's pure adventure as these two mice and a little girl plot a daring escape.

As a bit of trivia, Cruella de Vil was originally going to be the villain.  Frankly, I still see quite a bit of that in Medusa.  There's her obsession with getting the diamond and her over the top personality.  But the clearest similarity is Medusa's lousy driving but on land and on her swamp mobile.

The film is filled with great characters.  Bernard's fear and superstition is quite cute, and Miss Bianca is charming.  It's easy to feel for Penny.  Along the way we meet Orville the Albatross, a dragonfly named Evinrude, and Madusa's pet alligators Brutus and Nero who are all fun.  And Medusa makes a great villain since she is easy to root against.  She's not too scary, but scary enough to be taken seriously.

Of course, the cast deserves credit for bringing these characters to life.  The voice talent is perfect, Eva Gabor and Bob Newhart especially as the leads.

And I haven't even mentioned the music.  Sadly, none of the songs here seem to have become popular.  The cast itself only sings ""Rescue Aid Society,"" but I am fond of ""Tomorrow is Another Day"" and the Oscar nominated ""Someone's Waiting for You.""

So despite the dated animation, the movie still has its charm.  If you have missed The Rescuers, do yourself a favor and watch it today.",1433635200,,4432,4.400246305418719

1010037,4,6305320179,"I hate to state the obvious, but the books were much better.

Disney had a hand in the development of this movie before his death in 1966.  Per usual, ""Disney disliked the idea of a faithful adaptation of Margery Sharp's book The Rescuers.""  Following Disney's death, the second book in Sharp's series became the inspiration for this unfaithful adaptation.  The Rescuers was Disney Studio's first major animated success since The Jungle Book in 1967.  It also has the distinction of being their last major success until The Little Mermaid in 1989.  The Rescuers was also the end of the studio's so-called ""sketchy"" animation of the 60s and 70s.  A song from The Rescuers was nominated for an Oscar (Someone's Waiting for You) but lost to You Light Up My Life.

This animated feature is a bit on the dark side (literally), as it takes place during rain storms and gloom of night.  The villainess Madame Medusa (voiced by Oscar winning actress Geraldine Page) is the best character in this movie.  She owes a lot to Cruella De Vil in attitude and lack of driving skills.  The rest of the characters, and plot, run the gauntlet from maudlin to downright silly.",1417564800,,1157,4.735

1010445,3,6305320179,"Okay, I'll just get it out of the way. There's a picture of a naked woman in this movie. Disney is full of pervs. There! Done!

Now, let's talk about the movie, The Rescuers. This is along the same lines as The Aristocats and 101 Dalmations, in that there's not much magic, not much stellar animation, and mostly just cutsy animals acting, well, cutsy. Though I don't think it's as bad as something like the Aristocats, there's a little bit more story and character to it, nothing much really stands out about it.

It centers around this little girl who has been kidnapped by this evil woman who wants her to go into this mie and get this incerdibly valuble diamond. Talk about child labor laws. Well, it turns out there's a big group of mice called the Rescue Aid Society that go in and try to help people in such circumstances. Definatly a creative idea, though, I guess, like most people, I wonder what a bunch of mice can do in rescueing a bunch of people, but I guess that's the point. There's no person to small. Yada, yada, yada.

So two mice, named Bernard and Mrs. Bianca, go out to rescue her, while also coming across a bunch of colorful characters. I guess, I remember a few things that stood out like some of the bad guys are actually entertaining, like this crazy lady who's holding the girl looks like something out of a 1940s French bordello. A really bad 1940s French bordello. Her reactions, alot of the time, a pretty fun to watch. She also has this blithering sidekick who once in a while gets a good line. And she also has these two aligators that are probably the funniest things in the movie. Aside from that, it's just more cutsyness.

The little girl is obnoxious, I can't stand her. She's like one of the Olson twins. She's just designed to look precious. And the rest of the movie is just filled with scenes that drag or are overly cutsy or don't seem to have much point to them.

I din't hate it I just don't remember it doing much for me. Even as a kid I remember being bored by it, with the exception of one or two comedic scenes. I'm not really a fan of it, I would probably say there are much better Disney films you can watch.

Want to know about the movie?

Its a great ""G"" rated disney movie about a couple of thrill seeking mice (I believe they are)who go to help friends. Great cast of voices.

What can two little mice possibly do to save an orphan girl who's fallen into evil hands? With a little cooperation and faith in oneself, anything is possible! As members of the mouse-run International Rescue Aid Society, Bernard and Miss Bianca respond to orphan Penny's call for help. The two mice search for clues and, with the help of an old cat named Rufus, track Penny to the clutches of the evil Madame Medusa in a dilapidated ship in Devil's Bayou. It turns out that Medusa is using Penny to locate and retrieve the Devil's Eye Diamond--a stone she'll stop at nothing to possess. With a cunning plan, courageous acts, cooperation from local animal life, and lots of faith, Bernard and Miss Bianca help Penny find the diamond and escape from Medusa. The result of their adventure is that Bernard and Miss Bianca become close friends and Penny gets adopted. This somewhat dark, classic 1977 animated Disney film is based on Margery Sharp's The Rescuers and Miss Bianca, and features the Academy Award-nominated song ""Someone's Waiting for You."" Voice talents include Eva Gabor as Miss Bianca, Bob Newhart as Bernard, Geraldine Page as Madame Medusa, and Jim Jordan (radio's Fibber McGee) as Orville Albatross. Followed by the sequel The Rescuers Down Under. (Ages 5 to 11)",1302912000,,1797,4.680379746835443

And this little girl sure does to some annoying value. She even has a plush toy which is the heart of her friendship. The mice characters are alright graced by headliner actors Bob Newhart & Eva Gabor. Its also a nice dvd package with some great extras, with one outstanding in ""The Water Birds"" which was one of Disney's True-life Adventures series.

I've always wanted to be able to talk to and understand animals and every time I see a Disney movie with humans and animals interacting, I wish it even more. Anyway, this movie about a little orphan girl who makes it to freedom with the help of her animal friends is really great and heart warming and whether you've never seen it or if you saw it when you were a kid, you should rent or buy it and watch it again.

1010551,5,6305320179,"The Rescuers is one hour and seventeen minutes and was released on June 22, 1977. The movie mainly deals with two mice named Bernard and Miss Bianca and a small girl named Penny. The movie opens up with Penny dropping a bottle with a note inside it into the swamp waters and out to sea. The bottle makes it way to shore and is brought to the Rescue Aid Society. There the society reads the letter and Miss Bianca decides she wants the assignment and enlists the help of Bernard. Bernard has a fear of the number thirteen which is reference through the movie and he hates to fly and rather takes the train. There first stop is at the Morningside Orphanage where they meet Rufus; an elderly cat. Rufus tells about his last meeting with Penny and where she might be. Bernard and Miss Bianca then head to Medusa's Pawn Shop. They find a first grade reader's book and the two come to the conclusion the Medusa had kidnapped the child. Bernard and Miss Bianca prove themselves correct when they overhear Medusa talking on the phone to Mr. Snoops about Penny throwing bottles with notes into the swamp. The two try to hide in Medusa's suitcase when she leaves for the Devil's Bayou; though it is never mentioned where Devil's Bayou is, it is assumed it is located in Florida or Louisiana. Medusa's suitcase flies out of the car and Miss Bianca and Bernard must find another way to get there. The two fly down to the Devil's Bayou on Albatross Airlines. Once the couple arrives at Devil's Bayou, the race is on to find Penny. Along with Evinrude, Miss Bianca and Bernard head to an abandon riverboat where Medusa and Mr. Snoops are holding Penny hostage. Penny, Miss Bianca, and Bernard come up with a plan so Penny can escape and send Evinrude to round up the team. Since Evinrude did not arrive in time Penny must go back to the cave and find the Devil's Eye. Penny, Miss Bianca, and Bernard are lowered down into the cove and the three begin the look for the diamond. The three find the diamond and are brought back to the surface. It is back on the surface that Medusa shows her true colors. She has planned all along to keep the diamond all to herself and not split it 50/50 with Mr. Snoops as they original agreed. Back at the riverboat, the swamp animals, Miss Bianca, and Bernard put their rescue plan into place. In the end Penny is rescued and is adopted. The Rescuers marked the end of the Silver Age of Disney films and the last one to be nominated for an Oscar; it would be another twelve years until the Little Mermaid that a Disney movie got an Oscar nomination. Also it was the last movie to feature Disney's ""nine old men"" team. The Rescuers was also the first Disney movie to have a sequel. The Rescuers gets an AAAAA+++++.

1010552,4,6305320179,"Within the walls of the United Nations Building lies the meeting chamber of the Rescue Aid Society, made up of mice from all over the globe, whose business is to help the unjustly imprisoned.  When a message in a bottle floats into New York Harbor, it ends up in their paws.  Its writer is Penny (Michelle Stacy), a former inmate of the Riverside Orphanage, who begs its finder for help.  To take the assignment the RAS Chairman (Bernard Fox) names the glamorous Hungarian delegate Miss Bianca (Eva Gabor), who, with the help of the Society's janitor, the somewhat superstitious and worry-prone Bernard (Bob Newhart), contrives to discover that Penny has been spirited off to the Devil's Bayou by flamboyant pawnshop owner Madame Medusa (Geraldine Page) and her henchman Snoops (Joe Flynn).  Making their way by Albatross Air (Jim Jordan as Orville the Albatross) to Louisiana, Bernard and Bianca discover that Medusa and Snoops need a small child who can fit down the throat of a cave in which they believe the legendary diamond, the Devil's Eye, was hidden by pirates centuries before.  With the assistance of the local animals, the mice craft a daring plan to free Penny from her captors and their two watch-alligators, Nero and Brutus.

Though Disney's version of the society isn't the same as that of its originator Margery Sharp (who called it the Prisoners' Relief Society), the adaptation is well done, with all the usual Disney elements of humor, action, suspense, and unforgettable characters.  It could also dovetail neatly into the earlier mouse society shown in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Mouse-Detective/dp/B00005T7H5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Mouse Detective</a>, and the two would make a good family double feature.",1271980800,,1800,5.4765342960288805
1010553,5,6305320179,"""The Rescuers"" is still a movie shown to animation students everywhere; the animation in it is simply that stupendous and magical. This 1977 animated movie still delivers. Strong characters and story help it to shine as brightly today as the diamond on which the whole story centres.

At the Rescue Aid Society in New York (beneath the UN Headquarters), a message in a bottle pleading for help is examined. Bianca, a foreign representative, takes the case and selects timid but moral janitor Bernard for the job. They set out to find the girl, Penny, and help her all they can. That the two are mice won't distract them from dealing with larger-than-life foes such as the incredible Medusa, her bumbling partner-in-crime Snoops and alligators Brutus and Nero. Penny, whom Medusa uses to search for the legendary diamond the Devil's Eye due to her small size, needs all the help she can get. But the Rescuers are up against formidable foes.

The Rescuers is a short movie, only about 75 minutes, but it packs its punch into its short time frame. The characters really make the movie shine. Bernard and Bianca work wonderfully together, as does the troupe of supporting characters such as the swamp rodents. The only character I don't like is Evinrude the dragonfly, who has a large part in the movie. Penny is adorable and we totally feel for her in the horrible situation she finds herself in.

However, the star of the movie is Medusa, the sort of character who only occurs once in cinema. Medusa is despicable and repulsive, yet beautifully so; she is fascinatingly and charismatically evil. Here is a person who has pet alligators and deals with rodents by shooting them with a shotgun. Geraldine Paige nails the voice role, but it's the animators who bring her so fantastically to life. Disney was using another sort of production style at the time, where they xeroxed their drawings, resulting in the rough pencil style also seen in the Aristocats and Robin Hood. Some reviewers here don't like it, and I couldn't disagree with them more. I personally love this style, as it draws out the true rawness and beauty of the animation; it isn't trying to hide the draftsmanship behind it all. As I stated above, The Rescuers is still noted for its animation. More than once, in my animation school, have my teachers liked to show us Medusa's first clip, on which you could model a whole animation class. Medusa's gestures, moves, looks and little mannerisms represent a level of animation that only a master can stout at possessing. What did you expect, from someone like Milt Kahl? All this makes Medusa not only a marvel in animation, but a timeless and electric character that will live on in our minds for a long, long time.

Interestingly, the villains in the movie attracted all the best animators. Not only Medusa but her ""sweetheart"" Snoops is fantastic. Pet alligators Brutus and Nero are then simply astounding, doing for animal animation what Medusa does for human animation. The scene where they're playing the organ is simply delicious to behold.

The Rescuers is an amazing animated movie for the ages. It's got something for everyone; great story, awesome characters, stupendous animation (which brings both of the aforementioned to life). This is one of those times when animation fully reveals its potential. Let it be forever heralded.",1269302400,2,3353,4.885764499121265

1010634,5,6305320179,"I agree with others that this underrated and ignored-by-the-studio effort was the last great Disney animated film for a long, long time.  Among other excellent elements are the songs--and has anyone mentioned the marvelous singing of Shelby Flint?  Her behind-the-credits rendition of ""The Journey"" sets up the story and makes for one of the most haunting openings of any Disney film, and of course, she helped propel ""Someone's Waiting For You"" to an Oscar nomination.  Predictably, there is no CD (unlike the forgettable Rescuers Down Under) and unless you are already a ""star,"" you don't get much billing at Disney.  Apparently destined to be the Marni Nixon of animation, Shelby Flint also sang in Snoopy Come Home (again, no CD) and some others.  Joni Mitchell has admitted imitating her at the start of her career, but apparently lacking Mitchell's chutzpa, Flint's name must be dug out of the small credits.  She, and the songs, help make this film exceptional.",1229385600,,968,5.056603773584905
1010635,4,6305320179,"This movie truly deserves a much better DVD release.  As a couple of reviewers have posted, it was speculated that Disney would reissue the DVD in 2007.  Well, that year has flown by, and 2008 is almost at an end, and still no sign of a new, improved ""Rescuers"" DVD.  Perhaps a 35th anniversary edition in 2012/13?
And kind of interesting that young actress Michelle Stacy, the voice of Penny, would a few years later star in the hit comedy ""Airplane!"" as the young girl, when, asked by the young boy if she'd like cream in her coffee, replies with the classic comeback, ""No thank you, I take it black, like my men.""

1010642,4,6305320179,"This movie is touching, charming and entertaining. It pulls at the heartstrings, too.

Scrappy orphan Penny is captured by the flamboyantly wicked Madame Medusa, voiced wonderfully by Geraldine Page. She is the evil redhead who will stop at nothing to get her hands on something valuable, even at the expense of putting poor Penny in grave danger.

This is a bit unusual for a Disney film, and that may be why I like it. I am not familiar with the literature upon which it's based, but I thoroughly enjoy the setting, story, and characters. Bianca and Bernard are a great duo, voiced to perfection by Eva Gabor and Bob Newhart. Madame Medusa could be Cruella DeVil's cousin, she's so bad and greedy and loud.
And I just love the old riverboat. What a unique setting.

But I think the true key to The Rescuers' charms lie in the fact that it's all about a little girl who is all alone in the world, and then in real jeopardy. Anyone can relate to loneliness and being wanted. You can't help but want Penny to overcome her obstacles, to escape her captors, maybe even find happiness.

This isn't a big Disney success like Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, or Beauty and the Beast, but it most definitely deserves at least a look. It's got that rough, sketchy Xeroxed animation style of Disney's 1960's and 1970's cartoon films (the same technique was used to animate 101 Dalmations, The Jungle Book, and The Aristocats, among others).",1199664000,4,1430,4.685258964143427

In fact, we talked a little about the little girl wanting a Mommy and Daddy - and that she wanted to be adopted.  So that was a good topic for us to talk about.

However, I didn't like the topic of other children being adopted because they were prettier or whatever...  it makes it sound like a child's worth is only based on their specific qualities, instead of an unconditional love that a parent has for a child.  And the orphanage topic could be disturbing for some children who did spend time in an orphanage.  But in the end, the little girl was adopted and got a Mommy and Daddy!  It made me want to cry.  :)

I didn't really remember the Rescuers that well, as I remembered the sequel Down Under, but as soon as it started, it all came back to me. I remember hating the opening credits when I was young too - the still paintings following the journey of a message in a bottle, is just too slow for a child to sit through.

The Rescuers had the scariest villain, next to Ursula from the Little Mermaid, that being Medusa. Wasn't she scary? It was originally going to be Cruella De Ville, and there are still many similarities beween the two characters, namely the reckless driving and mad hair.

Alongside Disney classics, like Cinderella, Snow White, Bambi etc, The Rescuers does get a little lost, and it's not the best known of the Disney movies. The reason why some people may not like this as much as the earlier or the later Disney movies is because a new bunch of Disney animators came in at this point, rather than the old lot who were nearing retirement. There are some differences in this movie to the rest of them, the one I noticed was there was a lot of use of still paintings for backgrounds, and it did look very unnatural.

If you've never seen The Rescuers it is one to be picked up, if you want to see something slightly different than normal. It'll never be considered a classic, but I'm proud to have it in my collection.",1168732800,6,1473,4.428044280442805

The other kids in the party had already seen this movie. One of them said her parents had bought her a copy too.  That wasn't much of a surprise as it's easy to buy Disney VCDs here -- and authentic ones too.  But I was surprised when my 38-year-old brother-in-law said, upon glancing at the TV screen, ""What's that, 'The Rescuers'?""  :D

His wife, my older sis, often recalls watching this in theaters back in the 70s.  I saw ""The Rescuers Down Under"" on VHS in the 80s/90s, unaware that there was a prequel.  It was sis who told me that there was such an older movie; it was far better; and its soundtrack included the wonderful ""Someone's Waiting For You"" song.

I've heard a little critizism saying that the film didn't follow Margery's work, which is true, but those who see beyond basic storyline will find Margery Sharp's work sparkle in this beautiful Disney Classic.  The elements that made Sharp's work so pure and memorable are all found here.  Simple charm, soft drama, simplicity and sophistication.

Charm is all over this little gem.  Most of these moments include the little girl Penny.  In specific a scene in which she is being remembered by Rufus the cat at Morningside Orphanage, when they look out the window and in the light of day can point out a simple shining star.  The little poem ""Faith is a Blue Bird"" is magical.  This is one of the most emotional scenes in the movie.  Another example of this is when Penny is getting ready for bed at the riverboat in which she is being held hostage and gets down on her knees to pray.  That whole scene was done beautifully, with soft music and lots and lots of emotion.  Simple charm like this was a huge part of Margery Sharp's works, and it is also a big part of this film.  This kind of magic is what Disney should aim for now-a-days.  You don't need masterful animation, or bright colors or powerful songs, The Rescuers was so magical even without the ""usual"" meaning of magic.

Drama!  After over 10 years of comedy after comedy, The Disney Studios finally returned to shape with this soft drama.  Drama is needed in every film to make it memorable and The Rescuers has that from its very opening.  You can cry just from watching the opening of the film, in which a little bottle (Yes!  A bottle!) desperately sings the beautiful ""The Journey"" as it tries to survive the raging oceanic waters.  Is that magic or is that pure magic?  Of course, you shouldn't just go with pure drama, which was Disney's mistake once this film was completed.  The '80s, sometimes called Disney's dark era saw way too much darkness, gloom and depression for audiences to be able to fully enjoy the film.  The movies need a balance between light and dark to fully work and that's what makes The Rescuers so great.  A good example is ""Someone's Waiting for You"", as Penny cries, hoping and waiting for help and then seeing the star of faith shine and brighten the bayou with beautiful purple light;  Or purple magic.

There was sophistication to this movie that isn't always seen in Disney movies nowadays.  The characters seemed so secure and proud.  From the wicked Madame Medusa, to sassy little girl Penny, not to mention the glamarous Miss Bianca.  Taken straight out of Sharp's novels right into the Disney film.  Another perfect Margery Sharp element beautifully added to the film.  I have my theory as to why this film is often viewed as the only ""good Disney animated film from the '70s and '80s"" and I think it was because it combined the trademark of both eras, keeping a balanced combination of both '70s comedy and '80s drama.  Not to mention, featuring the most Disney magic in years.  Recommended for anyone!  But I'd buy the VHS over the DVD, as the DVD quality is quite poor.  Hopefully Disney will be sure to re-release this classic gem in the future.",1140825600,7,3228,4.625

1010761,5,6305320179,"Disney's beloved animated classic, The Rescuers ranks among the most memorable and charming films of Disney's days of magic and glory.  It's one of those Disney movies that you remember all your life, to the point in which you have every scene and every piece of dialogue memorized.  The characters are fun and colorful, the storyline is sweet, charming and touching, the animation is lively and realistic but the DVD release doesn't do this film justice.

Picture lacks quality, it's blurry, the colors are washed out and outlinings are thicker than they should be, also colors are sometimes faded and not the ones the film was meant to have.  Sound is pretty good but could be improved.  Bonus features are lacking and few relate to the film.  The packaging is below standard, reused cover art, missing insert and rather mediocre, it hardly seems that this movie belongs to the great Disney Canon of animation.

The back of the DVD cover says that the film has received a ""snappy new remastering"" which is somewhat obvious, yet somehow the film needs and deserves so much more.  Unless you care about clean and sharp French and Spanish soundtracks, keep your VHS copy until Disney releases a more fit and proper DVD release.

1010764,5,6305320179,"The Rescuers is the first Disney film I watched in theaters, also the first film I watched in theaters with my children when it was re-released back in the 80's.  For these and for other reasons, The Rescuers remains my fondest Disney memory, it is one of the most kid-friendly, charming masterpieces the studio has ever created and everyone in my family loves it.

You can't help falling in love with the sweet, soft tale of a little orphaned girl, being kidnapped by a pair of ruthless treasure seekers.  Penny lives in the gloomy and dark Morningside Orphanage, with the company of the faithful cat Rufus (Who was probably my favorite character, his little rhyme about Faith being a blue bird was just soo sweet!) who keeps in Penny alive the hope that someday a pair of nice people will come and take her away into a happy life.

Unfortunately, before this happens, the wicked Madame Medusa and her henchman Mr. Snoops will take the girl away into a dangerous mission in a lost bayou, into a dark and scary cavern where she must search for the dreadful Devil's Eye, the world's largest diamond.  Of course, not all is lost for little Penny, her plea for help inside a bottle reaches the shores of New York City and eventually the Rescue Aid Society, an organization (run by mice!) which's purpose is to help those in need, soon, the Chairman of the RAS, announces the mission, sending Miss Bianca along with Mr. Bernard to take on the dangerous journey.  The two mice travel through air, waters and land in order to reach Penny and bring her safely home, meeting cute characters along the way, Orville the albatross, Evinrude the dragonfly (A great little character!), Ellie Mae and Luke the muskrats among others.

Animation is a bit off in some places, mainly due to the fact that the prints released throughout the years were of poor quality, a good cleaning would really help.  Still the animation is lively and realistic, the film features great fun moments like a personal favorite when Medusa's two pet crocodiles, Brutus and Nero are trying to capture the mice who've hidden themselves inside an organ.  The songs, ah the songs!  All are soo beautiful, I could never understand why a soundtrack to this was never released...  ""The Journey,"" ""Rescue Aid Society,"" ""Tomorrow is Another Day,"" ""Someone's Waiting for You,"" ""For Penny's a Jolly Good Fellow"" but my favorite is ""Faith is a Blue Bird"" even if it really is only a little poem, I thought it was very sweet.  (Highly recommended)

""Faith is a blue bird,

We see from afar,

It's for real,

And as sure as the first evening star.

You can't touch it,

Or buy it or wrap it up tight,

But it's there just the same,

Making things turn out right.

1010787,5,6305320179,"Disney's 23rd animated classic, The Rescuers, ranks high at the top in the list of my favorite Disney animated features, followed by other grand masterpieces like Bambi (1942) and Lady and the Tramp (1955).  I've owned ""The Rescuers"" on VHS since I was very little and as I grew up, I came to love the film, more and more, also, I was beginning to pay more attention to quality and details, that's why I was very disappointed with this highly anticipated DVD debut.  Right off the bat, I'll state that it is obvious that Disney spent less time on this film's release than that of one of their new animated sequels.  This DVD was an absolute disgrace to the classic and I know the film has more to give then what's here.

I'll start off describing the film.  Based on two children's novels by Margery Sharp, ""The Rescuers"" and ""Miss Bianca,""  Disney's The Rescuers is the story of a mouse organization called the Rescue Aid Society, in search for a lost little girl, who they find has been kidnapped by wicked treasure-seekers.  The black-hearted Madame Medusa has taken a young orphaned girl named Penny away from her home, Morningside Orphanage in order to keep her captive hoping that she will be able to find a large diamond in a dark cave by the shore.  After months of being forced into dangerous diamond-finding missions, Penny sends a plea for help which arrives in the shores of New York City.  The heartbreaking plea has beautiful mouse Miss Bianca begging to be assigned onto the mission and chosing for a partner, the shy janitor mouse, Bernard.  Meeting several characters along the way, Bernard and Miss Bianca think up an elaborate plan to rescue the little girl and have her safely back at the orphanage.

Besides a warm and soft storyline, memorable and colorful characters, The Rescuers also features a very beautiful soundtrack.  Dark and sinister music creates the scary mood of swamp waters, while soft, lullaby melodies caress the sometimes heart-breaking scenes including the lonely little girl and the reading of the embottled plea.  Although its hard to tell from this DVD, the film features sharp and believable animation, with lively movement.  The art in this film varies in quality, the film opens beautiful with an artistic song sequence (""The Journey"") which combines beautiful ocean-view paintings with a very moody song making a very breath-taking scene indeed.  While the backgrounds are very artistic in the swamp and cave scenes, they somehow seem to get kind of murky and sketchy in the ""modern scenes"" such as the visit to the airport or the New York streets.  Besides ""The Journey,"" The Rescuers includes 4 other pretty songs, ""Rescue Aid Society,"" ""Tomorrow is Another Day,"" ""Someone's Waiting for You"" and ""For Penny's a Jolly Good Fellow.""

Now, about the DVD release.  Absolute trash, one of the worst Disney DVD releases ever.  It really shows, as soon as you look at it, that there's nothing special in this DVD edition, and that is as soon as you look at the cover, which is a re-use of the previous VHS Masterpiece Collection cover with a few things changed.  The back of the DVD states the film received a ""snappy new remastering,"" a pretty embarrassing remark may I say, the 1992 video release looked better, and I mean it.  The DVD includes poor bonus features, one of them a short, 2 minute game that is sure to bore the lights out of the youngest of children.  Picture quality for the film looks absolutely terrible, the colors are washed out and the picture isn't too sharp, very blurry and shaky sometimes.  The darker scenes are the worst, the animation looks solid and bland and the backgrounds look pretty much black, without any life.  Of course, that isn't the way the film was meant to be, but sadly, that's the way it has grown to look like after almost 30 years.  A shame, when much older films like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs look like jewels even after 68 years.  Many other flaws make this DVD edition not worth your money.  Other reviews state, ""fans should be pleased,"" but I think:

Disney fans want more, film fans deserve more.",1119830400,6,4101,4.746121297602257
1010788,5,6305320179,"Disney's The Rescuers offers the high quality in entertainment that has been absent from Disney releases for over a decade.  Instead of being one of those '70s comedies, The Rescuers focused more on telling a heartwarming tale and believe me, it delivered one of the most charming Disney experiences ever.  The story is about an orphaned girl named Penny who sends an urgent call for help through an old bottle.  The bottle is picked up by the society of mice called the Rescue Aid Society.  Miss Bianca, a soft-spoken Hungarian mouse volunteers for this task and choses the brave but shy Bernard for a partner.  Soon, the companions take off in the wings of the fun albatross Orville who flies them off to the bayou where they find Penny.  The two mice learn that Penny has been taken captive by two evil treasure hunters, Madame Medusa and Mr. Snoops who keep the little girl under constant watch with their pet crocodiles, Brutus and Nero.  In their journey, Bernard and Bianca meet some fun and loving characters, Rufus the wise and friendly cat, Evinrude, the strong-willed non-talking dragonfly (Who is one of the greatest non-talking Disney characters other than Dumbo.) and Ellie Mae, a sort of Don Bluthish beaver, a very friendly character who offers help to the mice calling in the swamp folk.

""The Rescuers"" offers a grand and warming tale for both kids and adults to enjoy.  The movie offers lots of humor, fun, warmth and the very best of 1970s songs.  The musical numbers in the film are blended with the film rather than have the story stop in order for the characters to annoyingly perform one of their numbers like in say, ""Aladdin."" The five songs in the feature are trully wonderful, ""The Journey,"" ""Tomorrow is Another Day"" and ""Someone's Waiting for You"" are very touching and soft.  The first opens the film in a show of beautifully painted pieces of ocean view which softly displays the opening credits.  The second one is more lively and the very best song in the film and the third one is more depressing, yet it creates the most heartwarming and beautiful scene.  The other two ""Rescue Aid Society"" and ""For Penny's a Jolly Good Fellow"" are brillant additions also, since they set up the happier moments in the film, which has one of the sweetest endings.

The film is highly recommended and one of Disney's finest.  So, why isn't it more popular?  Well, it had the back luck to open at a time when Disney films were of lower quality and The Rescuers got pulled into the hole as well.  ""The Rescuers"" was a true highlight in the period and it clearly outdoes out any '60s, '70's, early '80s or late '90s Disney animated releases.  The Rescuers is a gem for the whole family and also the last true Disney classic.",1117065600,7,2740,4.661122661122661
1010789,5,6305320179,"Disney's version of Margery Sharp's timeless tale of little mice, The Rescuers, is really delightful, even if it doesn't contain the same plot or all of the characters from the original.  Disney did a wonderful job of bringing Sharp's world to the screen, there's something really appealing about the way Disney handled the film, a bunch of little mice using small human objects in order to create their little society meeting building, inside a lost luggage bag and using cadles for lighting and other small objects.  The opening is very nice, the film opens with a beautiful ballad with breathtaking paintings that capture a dramatic ocean view and slowly tells the journey of the little girl's bottle.  The animation is wonderful!  A little sketchy sometimes but the characters are very believable and realistic and everything is smooth.  It's easy to tell that the film is pretty old, there are a lot of artifacts present through the movie, but those don't really lower the value and fun the film offers.

The storyline is very appealing, also.  There's something so warm about the story of a sweet and lonely orphaned girl with only her Teddy as companion, being taken away by an evil and black-hearted treasure hunted into a dark bayou where she must do slave work in order to retrieve the diamond the evil woman has so long been wanting.  Another villains make you feel for the little girl, a mean warden, Mr. Snoops and a due of alligators, Brutus and Nero who play babysitter to the little girl.  However, the girl isn't alone, a bunch of small critters like Ellie Mae and Luke are there to make sure she is alright while real rescuers come and save the girl.  Sharp's beloved mice, Bernard and Bianca fly on wings to save the girl and with the help of Ellie Mae, Luke and others, they will achieve this.

This movie is wonderful for adults and children alike.  Margery Sharp's fans will be pleased with this beautiful film based on the timeless classic stories.  A sequel to this gem was done years later, ""The Rescuers Down Under"" which is a disgrace to both the original film and Sharp's work, taking her characters into a modern world and ruining the appeal of her stories.",1116028800,6,2186,4.721052631578948
1010790,5,6305320179,"When a little orphan girl falls into the hands of Madame Medusa and sends a message in a bottle, the Rescue Aid Society answers in the form of Bernard (Bob Newhart) and Miss Bianca (Eva Gabor).  What can two mice possible do to help the little girl?  It turns out they can do a lot.

The movie starts on a reasonably funny note, as the rodent duo hop aboard an albatross to head for the swamps.  Albatrosses are incredibly aerodynamic, but they are less then stellar at takeoffs and landings, and Orville the Albatross (Jim Jordan) proves no more adept than his brethren.  After a plummet off a building that thrills Miss Bianca and petrifies Bernard, the journey has begun.

In the swamps the duo marshals the other animals to take on Madame Medusa (Geraldine Page), who needs the little orphan Penny (Michelle Stacy) to fit into a hole that leads to a cave.  In the cave is located a quantity of jewels, but Madame Medusa is interested only in a huge diamond called the Devil's Eye.  The Rescue Society mice and their swampland friends must overcome Madame Medusa and her aids Mr. Snoops (Joe Flynn) and a pair of alligators, who also frequently play babysitter to Penny.

Madame Medusa never realizes that the mice and swamp animals are trying to rescue Penny, which makes this movie more interesting to watch.  As happens with many such movies, Madame Medusa's henchmen are cerebrally challenged and the animals are able to plan around them.

The ending of the movie contains a few surprises, and I found the end interesting.  This movie also nicely sets up the excellent sequel ""The Rescuers Down Under.""

The real star of this clever movie is Eva Gabor.  Bob Newhart gets top billing, but Eva was perfect for her role and seems to get the best lines in the movie.  She is clever, funny and fearless as compared to Bernard's timid character.  Only when Miss Bianca is in trouble does Bernard seem to rise to some measure of courage.  There were a variety of other notable characters.  Evinrude (James MacDonald) the dragonfly was cute and funny.  George Lindsey was classic as Deadeye the Rabbit.  Other supporting characters gave this movie depth and interest.

The art of this movie is also unusual in that the artist drew some of the characters in a rough style.  I am unsure of the reason, but I found the art style to initially be distracting.  I eventually became accustomed to the style and no longer noticed it as the movie went on.  The music was also notable.  A song from this movie was nominated for an Academy Award.

This movie is clever and funny.  In places the movie is tense and suspenseful.  There are a few places where the alligators are a little bit scary, but I believe this movie should be suitable for all family members in line with the movie's G rating.  I would recommend this movie for any collection of family-oriented movies and for those who collect animated movies.  Most families will want to see this movie more than once.",1112745600,34,2962,4.640384615384615
1010835,5,6305320179,"One of the most heartwarming films that I have ever had the pleasure to watch would have to be Disney's The Rescuers.  The storyline is somewhat depressing, which is why some would prefer to not watch this film and watch something a little happier.  I, for one, think that this aspect of the movie makes it original.  It's not your ordinary fairy tale where the princess is locked away in a high tower and Prince Charming comes to rescue her and they live happily ever after.

Instead, this movie follows a young orphan through her trials living with the unfair desperado, Madame Medusa.  Two mice from the Rescue Aid Society come to Penny's (the young orphan) rescue resulting in a very cute, heartwarming film.  The depressing moments in the film make the happy moments all the more cheerful and warm, making the viewer feel apart of the world instead of just watching a scene laid before them.

The art has a rough, ""sketchy"" feel to it.  While a lot of people would find this bothersome, and a sign of pure ""laziness"" from the artists, I kind of find it to add feeling to the film.  The ""sketchy"" feeling matches the mood of the entire movie, and really makes this movie stand out.

I also loved the songs from the movie.  ""The Journey"" was a great choice in song to open the movie, some would say that it was just thrown together because there is ""no animation"" involved.  I feel, however, that this isn't a sign of laziness, I think this was the plan.  It was beautiful, it added heart to the movie even before the characters were introduced.  Truly visually impressive, and the song was just beautiful and started off the story properly.

Along with that the other songs fit seamlessly into the movie.  Never was there a dull moment, the songs weren't too long, and weren't too short.  They never seemed out of place, and they were always beautiful songs and easy on the ear.  Truly wonderful music.

Wonderful story, intriguing plot, charming characters, beautiful music all combined together to make one masterpiece film.

1010865,4,6305320179,"I didn't know that Disney was planning are releasing this movie on dvd, until today. And I watched this movie tonight. I had a vhs copy of this movie around. And I think this was the first Disney movie to have a sequel, and this movie was out about 13 years, before the sequel to this movie was made. It tells a story about 2 mice, 1 a janitor and the other a lady on a mission  to save a young girl named Penny that was kidnapped from an orphanage. As the movie opened, Penny (Michelle Stacey) drops a bottle that is a cry for help, and the bottle finds its way to New York, where a couple of mice discovers it, and the Recure Aid Soceity calls to order, a meeting. A janitor mouse named Bernard (Bob Newhart) brings ladder (that is really a comb), cames the comb, and goes inside, manges to get the message out of the bottle, but keeps falling back to the bottom of the bottle. The message is all watered out, and a mouse named Miss Bianca (Eva Gabor) manges to make out some of the message, including Penny's name. Miss Bianca decides to ask to take the misiion, even though Bernarnd doesn't think it is a good idea for Miss Bianca to go alone. So the chairmouse, decides for Miss Bianca to selct a co-agent to go with her, and she has a lot of vanletters, which makes it hard for her to chose, and she picks Bertand.",1055808000,4,1320,4.176470588235294

We watched Down Under first, then when I told her about this one, she begged to see it.  She loves them both!  Ordered SD because, well, there's not much point to HD with these old films.  Still looked good!",1506902400,,356,4.101449275362318
