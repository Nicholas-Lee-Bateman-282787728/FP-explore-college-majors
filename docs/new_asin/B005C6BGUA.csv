4651575,5,B005C6BGUA,"I am a college-aged girl and my friends and I loved, ""Guys Gone Wild"".  Of course a lot of guys aren't going to like it because it turns around the whole idea of making girls the sex objects and making the guys the sex objects.  Those guys who can't hack the double standard are the ones may have the problem are sexist and want to believe only girls can be reduced to pieces of flesh for entertainment.  Guess again boys.  If you don't like it maybe that'll make you think twice about how you treat girls in the first place.  Get over yourselves.  The video is a lot of fun.",1092009600,24,575,4.181818181818182
4651576,3,B005C6BGUA,"Good Video, not as good as the girls gone wild additions. Choice of models is a 7/10 points.",1162684800,,92,4.166666666666667
4651577,4,B005C6BGUA,"i expected it to be a little more explicit but it's a nice dvd to own.

Some reviewers complain about being to soft ....... well then buy a porn , this is the kind of filme thet REALLY shoot real people and not actors pretending to be commom  people, it shows lots of nice guys and some of the talking ...... like the guys hiting on the female camera's .... thinking that they can score is so patetic that is funny .

This is the tipe of movie to watch on a ""barchelloret party"" with your friends and you will get ton of LAUGHTS

Well that's it buy this DVD having in mind that this is real people making a fool of thenselfs  and NOT a CHEAP and FAKE PORNO .",1132704000,6,658,3.9923664122137406
4651578,3,B005C6BGUA,"This movie is nothing more than a crew of babes going around key college vacation areas convincing drunk and otherwise innebriated college guys take off their clothes and do stupid things, including the bologna toss. Don't get me wrong, some of these guys are hot, but aside from the showers scenes this movie doesn't really do much, except maybe convince you to grab something a little raunchier out of the collection. 3 stars, at least the camera crew has some taste (sometimes.)",1130112000,5,481,4.878048780487805
4651579,3,B005C6BGUA,"Honestly I have to say that ultimately I was entertained. There were a couple of parts where they just lingered too long on one individual. Also, the editing was bad and in certain instances the lighting as well. However for an amateur production, it was good. This DVD is one of those ""off the wall"" purchases for sh*ts and giggles. It's comparable to Girls Gone Wild as it shows as much of the male anatomy as Girls Gone Wild did of the female anatomy. Watched it with 2 girls and a guy and we all agree that drunk guys are a lot funnier to look at.",1127088000,4,551,4.2075471698113205
4651580,1,B005C6BGUA,"I wasn't expecting much when I bought this DVD. Allot of my guy friends pop in ""Girls Gone Wild"" DVD's all excited and watch 15 minutes before you get bored so I expected about the same from this version. This first ""Guys Gone Wild"" DVD is even worse. A total waste of time and energy and not sexy at all come to mind. If buying this for a bachlorette party prepare for a boring awkward night, ladies. After fast forwarding through minutes and minutes of each guy being coaxed to show something you get only a few exciting moments so to speak and none of them are what I'd call ""must-see TV"" if you catch my drift. The longest scene in the film is also the most brutal. If watching fat naked guys in G-strings and cowboy hats running through hotel lobbies turns you on than this is for you. Ugh. The whole idea of ""guys gone wild"" was an interesting one, but the actual product was pretty awful. Objectafying women as sex objects has been a part of our culture forever and it was nice to see the tables turned... If only the end results had been more substantial.",1123027200,11,1063,4.32
4651581,1,B005C6BGUA,"Products late as usual.  One week late already. i order on 25 June 2005. People should not order anything from Amazon anymore.

I order a book published by Mcdona from here last year. It was Nearly two month late. Tragic. They never improve their service. Disa0pointing!!!!!!

I got ""200 American DVD"" last friday. This one only one day late. Where are other products? I order all dvd at the same date and get charge at the same date but they get delivery in differnt time???? Very unresonable!!!!",1122595200,,497,4.689655172413793
4651582,2,B005C6BGUA,"It wasn't that great of a DVD.  I didn't like the females in there.  It was ashame the girls didn't do much to entice the guys to really go wild.  That is my major complaint... the guy's weren't wild enough.  The only one in there I liked (sexually anyways) was the Lebanese-American guy, but he was the biggest (moreso where it counts) chicken of the group...",1121558400,3,360,4.409090909090909
4651583,3,B005C6BGUA,"While we wait for the sequel, SPRING BREAK EXPLOSION, here's my impressions of the first GUYS GONE WILD disc.  And maybe a lesson or two for the makers of the first one, because it let us down quite a bit and maybe with SPRING BREAK they will make some reparations.  First, the plusses.  For the most part the GGW guys are great looking, with a few duds sprinkled in here or there to keep us grounded.  It's true after awhile they all begin to look alike.  They have the same body type, the same haircut, the same goofy expressions frozen on their faces as their jaws try to speak in words after twelve tequilas, they shrug, they give up speaking, they concentrate hard on opening the drawstring to their pants.  The sound equipment the interviewers use is horrible, and this is one DVD that might be better viewed with the mute button completely off.  The interviewers can be heard screeching extremely loud, but the boys' answers are pretty mumbled, and it's not only the liquor that makes them sound underwater, it's the lack of attention placed on getting the audio right.  To a lesser degree the same is true of the video.  These girls can get a guy to strip off his boxers and get down to nothing at all in ten seconds flat, but they can't photograph him worth a darn.

Hire someone who can work both ends of a camera is what I say.  The camera's bobbing up and down like it's on a buoy out in a storm, it's like the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and when you can see anything, it's just for a flash.  The other problem is, the running time is under an hour.  I guess a fool and his money are soon parted but in this day of six-hour porn DVDS, who is going to be fooled twice with a 50 minute short?  Get some extra footage in there pronto.

I can't wait until these guys, who have all presumably signed releases, try to get work as adults.  Hopefully they won't be running as congressmen or anything that would require full disclosure.  Granted we all go a little crazy when we're juiced up, but doing it for video, that's a lapse in judgment--however it's one I'm glad they made.  It will give a picture of what American youth thought appropriate in the year of our Lord 2005.  Now let's just have more of it and I will rest happy.  Oh, and to really add a star, girls, get them to have sex with each other on camera.  How hard could that be?",1118361600,26,2341,4.299086757990867
4651584,4,B005C6BGUA,"Ok so this shows skin, a lot of it, There are too many of the girls' voices, and you can't mute it cause then you wouldn't hear the guys. The skin is nice! It's like, BABY! The one thing that sucks is that the girls make the guys undress from behind when all one really wants to see is the front. Other reviewers said that the girls are annoying. They were wrong. The girls are unbearable, more than annoying. The only good role they play is getting the guys naked, but really, if a guy is drunk,like these guys, they'd do anything for anyone. Hmmmm. :-)",1117497600,10,554,4.235849056603773
4651585,2,B005C6BGUA,"This video is a ""must have"" for any collection...but the vapid camera girls need to go away.  The girls ruined an otherwise great video.  I suggest that the producers still use girls to bait the obviously heterosexual hunks, but they need to hire some that can actually operate a camera.  Aditionally!  If the bait has to open her mouth, then please, please edit the sound!  I suggest watching this video with the sound ""off"".  Expect lots of poorly focused video, and worse editing.  This looks more like something produced by high school kids that had no affiliation to any AV club.",1115337600,12,584,4.7227722772277225
4651586,2,B005C6BGUA,This video came and we immedietly threw it into the DVD player....the first featured boy is the dude from NY and he was certainly blessed.  He was gorgeous and had the magic stick.  It was all downhill after him.,1113782400,14,212,4.410256410256411
4651587,1,B005C6BGUA,"There is a huge difference between guys gone wild and girls gone wild. Essentially, to show one's breasts means that you are not exposing your genitalia. If you have seen girls gone wild, all the videos mainly feature young women exposing the breasts. Hence, we women get to see topless men, left and right on a daily basis through TV, or by walking down the street, men are forbidden to see topless women or have to pay for it!

Breasts are not genitals and consequently women being featured in girls gone wild are simply exposing the same body part that men expose on a daily basis. When I looked at guys gone wild, well what can I say, other then men are showing more then women ever dare. Breasts are not genitals as we all know but women think that if a guy sees a woman's breasts, she is then entitled to see a man's genitals. Question here, are things equal and fair for men, or are they being cheated out of seeing the same body parts of the female body as women get to see on men's bodies more frequently and easily?

Essentially, girls gone wild is tame compared to guys gone wild? During the first 5 minutes of guys gone wild, you will see more penises (male genitalia) then you will see vulva's (female genitals) in the entire collection of girls gone wild.",1110585600,10,1269,4.395744680851064
4651588,1,B005C6BGUA,"When I saw ""Gone Wild"" I thought it was ""Girls Gone Wild."" The video was very boring and nothing much happened. I kept watching waiting for some girls to show up and about 20 minutes in I realized they weren't coming. The shower scenes were painful to watch. I doubt someone who wasn't gay would enjoy this movie much. Lots of muscular guys but not many shots of their genitals (thank God!) I found this video to be quite terrible indeed.",1110585600,5,438,4.419753086419753
4651589,5,B005C6BGUA,"WOW i was anticipating this release and when i finally got it via ups....i was THRILLED. this dvd has everything i always wanted in a video: hard pecs, nice buns and fun for all!!!! i recommened this dvd for all!!!! you won't be disappointed...chapter 8 rules!",1106092800,9,260,4.673913043478261
4651590,3,B005C6BGUA,"This video is what it is, a video of drunk, blurry eyed frat boys taking off their clothes after much cajoling (who thought they would be so shy) and intoxicated. Most of the guys are pieces of candy but it is amazing how none of the ""candy"" is or gets hard on film (I find that strange). The video becomes real tiring after about 30 minutes of sloshed speech and dazed faces as you realize the producers want to cash in on the desire of [...] men while trying to make it all pumped up and straight. The end result is like a poorly mixed drink that really doesn't satisfy.",1103155200,16,572,4.209090909090909
4651591,1,B005C6BGUA,"I thought when the title say ""gone wild"", I would see guys acting really wild as part of the event, like for example, getting drunk in a party and did an impromptu streaptease or other really wild things. But what I saw was more on robotic and stupid guys, many of whose facial expression were blank from lack of comprehension on what's going on. Some were trying their best to pull a stunt but drunkeness defeated them. What a loser! It is a recommended viewing for other guys who hadn't realized how they look when they run out of sanity under the influence of alcohol or drugs. I don't know what those guys would say when the see this movie of themselves under normal condition. I don't see any objective of this movie. Imitating MTV? If I wanted to see nudity, I'd rather rent a soft-core porno; at least there is action and maybe a little story plot. The movie made me dizzy trying to cope up with so much camera movements and poor lighting situations. Choice of sound is as boring and bad as a porno movie. While many of the guys can qualify to model for my photography, but still they cannot compensate for the zero value of the movie. Honestly, my 10-year-old nephew can make better movies than this, at least technically. Girls, come on. You can do much better next time.",1098835200,34,1280,4.451063829787234
4651592,4,B005C6BGUA,"Well, they can find tons of stupid, drunken & generally overexcited girls to leap naked in front a videocam, why not the same equal-exploitation for the boys ? Why, indeed ? I bought this as a gift for a friend but simply HAD to view it first. The cinematograhy(HA HA HA !)is non-existant. It's literally just a slapped together series of clips from guys they have videotaped who are on spring break & can't wait to show someone, anyone, their weiner. The camerawomen (they claim it's all women who have put this together) appears drunk also, or has never used a camera before cause a good portion of the material is underexposed, overexposed, out of focus or just of the ceiling. On the upside the boys are really good looking, well built & having tons of fun showing off. There is more than one failed attempt at a naked handstand here, and yes, a naked conga line thru the populated hotel lobby. The whole thing has a silly harmless yet intriging ""dirty"" feel to it. I am sure some will find this genuinely arousing to boot. I know several, both boys & girls, who are going to get this for Christmas. All, of course, from the ""naughty"" list. Enjoy.",1098662400,35,1151,4.511961722488039
4651593,3,B005C6BGUA,"I was really excited to get this DVD. After watching I was a little disappointed. I was expecting to see more guys and much more nudity. There are boring parts and there are a few good scenes. I happen to have the DVD version that has the bonus scenes, which are not much  but they are worth watching.

 I highly recommen that if you purchase this DVD,you use Amazon or any other type of outlet instead of the website for this company. They have terrible customer service and and a history of fraudulantly charging their customers with shipping and not following through on orders or returns. Check out the Better business bureau website and type in girls gone wild or mantra films if you want to see for yourself.",1097971200,112,714,4.51937984496124
4651594,5,B005C6BGUA,"I read R. Wahl ""PhantomAce""'s review and a few others.. and found them to be TOTALLY and I do mean TOTALLY without merit.  Who do they think they're fooling?  This video is H O T !!!!!  These guys are CUTE and HANDSOME and some of them are, shall I say, EXTREMELY WELL EQUIP'd.  :)  I give this one 10 stars in a 1 to 5 scale.  hehehehe.... if you like some nicely built handsome men, then this is your video.",1097798400,12,409,4.05
4651595,1,B005C6BGUA,"I was looking forward to this as a bit of fun voyeurism and titillation.  It was none of that.  It was stupid.  Period. The women who ""directed"" this mess were loud and obnoxious and seemed mostly interested in making these guys look like fools. If you're looking for something slightly sexy, go elsewhere. This video is bad.  BAD, BAD, BAD.",1095638400,41,341,4.633333333333334
4651596,3,B005C6BGUA,"To be honest...it was not what I thought it was gonna be. Yeah it was funny, and the guys were beautiful, but the editing was not that great, and like everyone else said, you can barely hear the guys. Will I order another version, sure.",1095379200,9,236,4.266666666666667
4651597,1,B005C6BGUA,"I eagerly waited for this DVD to be released and I finally got it this morning. I found it poorly directed, edited, lighting was a big problem, the audio (or the lack of it), I found it tedious and very disappointing. Avoid it, it's not worth the $24 I paid for it. Can I have a refund?",1095206400,5,286,4.035087719298246
4651598,5,B005C6BGUA,"This has to be the sexiest, funniest, most vivid dvd on guys I have seen so far.  My girlfriends and I LOVED IT!!!  We watched it for my bachlorette party and we were falling out of our chairs.  The guys were so hot and hillarious.  Trust me you don't want to miss out on this DVD.  It will not only have you laughing but on the flip side it will leave you wanting more. You will be left having to take a ""cold"" shower by the end of the film if you know what I mean.  It was a complete turn on and all of the girls that I know have seen it have said the same thing.  It is a must have to your collection.  TRUST ME!!!",1095120000,9,617,3.765625
4651599,5,B005C6BGUA,"I purchased Guys Gone Wild and I loved it!  I hoped for naked college aged guys acting stupid and having fun, and that's exactly what I got.  It's refreshing to see a movie that puts the guy on the viewing end of the camera, and doesn't shy away from frontal male nudity.  Quite a few of the guys were really hot, but all were cute, silly, and nekkid!  This is a really fun party flick!  I hope that it is just the beginning!!!",1095120000,11,427,4.096385542168675
4651600,3,B005C6BGUA,"Ok, I think that when your review this video you have to take into consideration that is what not made for gay men.  Sorry fellas.  Thus you can not expect to see the same quality men and type of activity you would see in a FALCON video.  If you do expect to go rent Falcon.

I expected to see fat, drunk, anglo-saxon's flashing the camera.  It was better than that but still needs work.  For a hetero amateur film it deserves about four stars.  For a homoerotic film I give it a two.

The cinematography and sound are marginal,but lets face it this is not a steven spielburg production and the Gone Wild serious never has been.  However, these technical aspects of this film could definitely improve.

There are some cute guys doing typical heterosexual drunk bumpling and fumbling to impress girls, little did they know men would be watching this.

I would like to have seen a guy who was showering actually lathering up a little suds in the crack and stroking of the package never hurt anyone.  Although we as gay men know better expecting homosexual encounters of straight men is a toughy while one video, even the girls tried sorry guys.

I would like to have seen some bigger packages.  I expected to see more obesity.  The guys were fit for the most part.

Overall I think you should view it.  I think straight sorority girls should buy it as it is a huge improvement.  Gay men should rent it as we usually hold higher standards on graphic materials.  Face it these aren't the kinds of guys you will see at a circuit party, not that hot, and they are young and stupid but its funny.",1095033600,28,1589,4.43598615916955
4651601,1,B005C6BGUA,"After seeing an editorial for this DVD in Out Magazine, I preordered it and was very much looking forward to hot naked frat boys caught on film. However when my copy arrived yesterday I was sorely disappointed...

Disappointment 1: Of the hour or so footage, there are only 3 or 4 hot guys.

Disappointment 2: The quality of the camera and audio work is exteremely poor. Frequently you can only hear the camera girl asking questions and not the guys response. Subtitles are not provided for low audio.

Disappointment 3: It's just stupid. While naked frat boys could be hot, they aren't when they are forced to act like monkeys do headstands and moon the camera on command (70% of the footage).

Disappointment 4: Male anatomy in a drunk flaccid state.

Shallow as it may seem, I was disappointed because there was nothing worth writing home about. Tons of chests and single butt cheeks. For ""wild"" guys, many were very tame. You would get the occassional frontal shots here and there and a shower, but ""Guys Gone Wild"" is not as ""Wild"" as one may have hoped. However, if you want a few good ""I can't believe this guy is that drunk or crazy"" laughs with friends, then the novelty is here.",1094774400,8,554,4.431372549019608

It is a themed vid guised as a revenge from the Girls Gone Wild fame. But in realization, it's a baby step for mainstream homo-ness. Don't get me wrong, i'm family so it's cool.

8464839,1,B005C6BGUA,"First of all, if you already own or are planning to own the ""Cream of the Crop"" DVD from this series, then that DVD already has anything worth viewing from this DVD.

As with other DVDs in this series, ""Bad Boys"" features different straight guys having a little fun with themselves after a night on the town. Unfortunately, a vast majority of the DVD is either random clips from parties or guys building up to the actual performance. All in all, there are maybe two guys on the whole DVD worth watching, and even then, only about five to ten minutes total of entertaining content.

My recommendation is that you skip buying this DVD and either get ""Cream of the Crop"" if you MUST have a ""Guys Gone Wild"" DVD, or simply spend your money elsewhere. You will be glad you did.",1268265600,,772,4.429577464788732

I don't know why they can't make more like that. I'm really dis-appointed by this latest release and am doubtful of ever buying anymore of these.
