4830314,5,B005LVEFQI,"Real D accomplishes its goal of presenting the Royal Opera House's stage Carmen in dramatic wide-depth 3D beautifully. The staging by the theatrical and by the film directors is enjoyable to watch; the dispersal of people is just in the right places, filling the stage with constant drama. There is a large cast of singers and dancers, singing and moving to George Bizet's music with full rhythmic voice and with gestures of appropriate excitement. There are animals on stage, a horse, donkey, and chickens. The acting is generally perfect. The 3D brings the front actors up close, as if they were no more than four feet away from us. We can make out more of their features because of the 3D presentation than in the usual movies. Unlike the usual films, where the people in the background are somewhat blurred or fuzzy, we can see background people as we would in real life. This is especially enjoyable when crowds are singing and moving boisterously. There is no apparent fabricated attempt to take advantage of 3D by having people stretch out articles to us inappropriately, just for the affect, but we see objects coming at us as we would expect them to be, as when dancers put out their arms and elbows or when Carmen moves forward to seduce a nave home sick corporal of the dragons or a macho bullfighter.",1326931200,,1312,4.708695652173913
4830315,5,B005LVEFQI,"WHAT A TREAT! This 3D movie is the best way to see a live stage performance! The 3D cameras put you in the best seat in the house with a view you could only dream you of. The 3D is not over done with objects in you face. It is natural, as if you're right on the stage watching. The camera work is so refreshing compared to Hollywood recent movies in that the camera is at a solid position, not bouncing around, and they don't cut-cut-cut every other second from camera to camera but rather let you take it all in with a wide view like the grand Fred Astaire dance movies of the 1930s. Also of note is how they managed to keep the foreground in focus and also background in good focus. This focus provides fantastic ""eye candy"" to just look around at the detail of the costumes or touch the stage floor to see if it is dusty! I can hardly wait for more stage shows to be produced in 3D. Quality stage shows in 3D will beat most of Hollywood's shallow movies. The sound was live and real! Bring it on!!",1325289600,2,1000,4.133333333333334
4830316,5,B005LVEFQI,"Christine Rice's performance as Carmen produces the most alluring, seductive and dangerous Carmen I've ever seen on stage or recording. This opera has been a favorite of mine for years and I thought it was all a little too familiar perhaps but this production of the opera opens new doors to the enjoyment of this famous classic opera.

All of the performers give the opera an energetic life that makes it sparkle with a newness waiting to be discovered. I hope it becomes available in 2D for those who may not have the setup for 3D; the musicality, the staging, and the acting place it in a special category that deserves as wide an audience as possible.

All four leads are well done as are the secondary roles so the overall impression is of a seasoned cast and crew who know their jobs perfectly.

This version is only viewable if one has the full 3D playback equipment so don't even think about it unless you do or are planning on jumping in soon.

The surround sound is Dolby Digital 5.1 and sounds excellent; I too wonder why the disc didn't include the Dolby True HD but the sound the way it is sounds great so there's no big loss there.

The 3D effect is some of the best I've seen and demonstrates the potential the technology has to offer. Some of the images seem to actually be a foot or two in front of the TV and the 3D depth of field is very good as well although it seems to move back into the TV rather than project out in front.

This performance was intended to break new ground and I believe it has; not only it the technology first class the performance of the opera was dramatic and powerful.

One of the interesting things about the subtitles is their 3D effect; they seem to be projecting into the room which makes them easy to see.

There are three short special features which are all worthwhile and entertaining.

I'm greatly encouraged by this disc and recommend it highly.",1324512000,16,1901,4.4240687679083095
4830317,5,B005LVEFQI,"This opera was very lively and sexy.

The 3D undoubtedly the best I have ever seen. It was so good. It was like a View Master Carmen.

Had problems with my Asus laptop due to weak sound. But eventually came up with a lame solution of reversing the audio jack plugs from my RadioShack speakers.

The 3D on my Asus  from amazon.com was sensational. Quad 2.90 GHZs, 16 GBs of Ram, discreet video card 3GBs, 1980 (1080p) 3D enabled with Nvidia shutter glasses, R/W/Blu-Ray, USB 3.0.

The 3D on my plasma LG 3D was wonderful/great/awesome with more than adequate sound. Of course the 50"" LG plasma 3D TV was from amazon.com.

If you have never been to the opera I recommend this Covent Garden production. Man, the 3d is astonishing. It is so in your face.
This 3D version is better than being in the opera house.

Glad I bought this 3d Blu-Ray version of Carmen.",1324425600,,857,4.455128205128205
4830318,5,B005LVEFQI,"This RealD production  of the opera ""Carmen"" is a great antidote to all the animated 3D Blu-rays.  Great production values at The Royal Opera House, amazing sound and thrilling 3D.  Shot in 3D HD video, it is almost better than being there for the performance! Buy it!",1324166400,4,268,4.659574468085107
4830319,5,B005LVEFQI,"November, 2011, marked the release of TWO 3-D Blu-rays with strong appeal to adults.  Both are great successes.  Cave of Forgotten Dreams is a fascinating documentary intended to be seen in 3-D.  And this Carmen is absolutely mind-blowingly stunning!!  The first (of many, I hope) stage productions in 3-D, it places the bar for future films EXTREMELY high.  These  discs make a strong case for owning 3-D equipment. The fortunate few already so-equipped will surely want them in their libraries.  I have strong hopes that these will sell well and ensure a future for other grown-up 3-D projects.

I completely agree with agent_odd's excellent review which praises the singing, production (designed for 3_D from the ground up), digital sound, and picture quality.  The ever-changing ""magic carpet"" perspectives that place you directly within the action rivet ones attention in a way that must be experienced to be believed.

Don't miss this one.  It's  thrilling and exhilarating, a revolution in opera dvd.",1323043200,14,1007,5.225
4830320,5,B005LVEFQI,"If there was ever going to be a first true 3D filming of an opera, why not make it the most popular opera in the world? That's right, Carmen is the first commercial high definition release filmed entirely in RealD-3D by Julian Napier. Before I get to the reasons why this one should be on your wish list, I should point out that you must have all the necessary 3D components to view this disc. There is no 2D alternative. If you don't have a full 3D HDTV, bluray3D player, active shutter glasses, and a fully compatible high speed HDMI cable, don't buy this product. However, if you're all set to view 3D imagery on your entertainment center, by all means, don't hesitate to pick this up. So, now to the good stuff. How's the picture? In one word, simply stunning. Smooth, lifelike, breathlessly three dimensional. The stage is deep and Napier takes full advantage by creating layers of dimensions between all the goings on. As extras and principles move across the stage, there is a real sense of depth dimension. When the credits begin and the camera pans across the theater, one can simply marvel at the ingenunity as rows of patrons sweep by the camera in full 3D. How's the sound? I was surprised that the sound format is only dolby digital and not true DTS HD master audio or the Dolby equivalent. However, the sound even still is magnificent in 5.1 channels when played back on a surround home theater system. All the tunefulness and orchestral coloring that Bizet wove into Carmen is sumptuous and realistic. How's the stage production? As I said, knowing the production would be filmed in 3D, there is plenty that pops out of the screen. The sets are relatively simple, but effective. There are real animals on stage as well. Don't expect Zeffireli extravagance, but you'll definitely get your money's worth. Francesca Zambello does a wonderful job polishing a production worthy of 3D. And, what of the performance itself. It's a memorable one. Christine Rice as Carmen is seductive and conniving, passionate and enflamed. Her voice is beautiful and she uses it to the hilt. How's her chemistry with Don Jose played by Bryan Hymel. It's potent. It has to be, right? For all this to work! Hymel is handsome and has a charming tenor with just the right desperation and agony in all the right places as he becomes ensnared in Carmen's wicked charm. Aris Argiris and Maija Kovalevska round out the principles and what a fine job they do. The whole cast is uniformly excellent. Have there been better Carmen's?...Don Jose's?...Escamillo's ect.? You could balk about this or that performance having this something or that something, but as a whole, I couldn't recommend this production more even if it were only in 2D. Constantinos Carydis conducts the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House and what a fresh and intuitive reading it is. It has a kind of flow and spontaneity about it that keeps the whole performance briskly moving along. So, my final verdict is: BUY THIS NOW! If you're looking to expand your 3D movie collection, what a great way to go about it. If you love opera, and just happen to have a 3DTV, this speaks for itself. I loved it, and definitely consider it a worthy purchase. I hope you do too. Peace!",1322265600,30,3223,4.696113074204947
4830321,3,B005LVEFQI,"I am a great fan of Bizet's Carmen, this rendition was just okay. The cinematography in 3 D was great and I enjoyed watching it. The vocal left a lot to be desired, the French was slaughtered. I would like to see this redone with a good French cast of opera singers. For the photography in 3D, I give it a 4 star, for the vocal I give it only 2 star - Thus the average of 3",1372291200,,373,3.7948717948717947

4830324,4,B005LVEFQI,"I was eager to experience an opera presentation on my new large screen high def 3D with surround sound. The technology provided a superlative experience. The use of close ups and behind the scenes preliminaries (singers warming up, putting on the makeup, etc) along with views of the opera house and the audience before the performance captured much of the ""being there"" experience at a price that is much less than the cost of a two good seats.

The performance itself was very fine but did not quite reach the level of the best that I've seen in terms of staging and performance, I would have rated it with 4 1/2 stars but that did not seem possible.",1352764800,,652,4.52542372881356
4830325,5,B005LVEFQI,"There are two ways to approach this disk.
1)  An opera in 3d?  Really?
2)  OK - so it's in 3D, but is it a good opera?

Let's get the 3d out of the way first.  When I bought a 3d-capable television, my only real disappointment was the lack of *good* 3d content.  Oh, there are literally hundreds of 3d cartoons out there.  But content for grown-ups has been in pretty short supply.  Hopefully, the people who produce 3d blu-ray disks are beginning to catch on that if they want 3d television to survive, they're going to have to start producing something that mom and dad can enjoy after the kids have gone to bed.  This disk goes a long way toward filling that void.

That being said, the 3d on this disk is spectacular - but not in a way that distracts from the opera itself.  Most 3d movies give in to the temptation to show-off the 3d technology by constantly throwing things at the audience.  But  the producers of this Carmen don't do that.  They use 3D in a way that doesn't call attention to itself so much as it simply enhances the realism of the image that you're watching.  After a while, you forget you're watching a 3D movie and begin to feel that you're 'simply there' with the singers.

But what about the performances and this production of Bizet's opera?  Carmen is a very popular opera, and consequently there have been a lot of productions released on DVD.  Some have been very good - some not-so-much.  Happily, this one is among the best.

Some have commented on the relatively simple sets and staging that Zambello used in this 3D production.  But for me, Carmen works best without the ""cast of thousands"" approach that so many opera companies feel they need to use.  Compare this version with the Zefirelli&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bizet-Carmen-Obraztsova-Domingo-Mazurok-Buchanan-Rydl-Zednik-Kleiber-Vienna-Opera/dp/B0006U6Q6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bizet - Carmen / Obraztsova, Domingo, Mazurok, Buchanan, Rydl, Zednik, Kleiber, Vienna Opera</a>&nbsp;in which there's so much happening on stage that the characters and the story get lost in the production.  Not so in this version, in which Christine Rice's performance captures the pure self-obsessed narcissism of Carmen, as she toys with Don Jose like a cat toying with a mouse.  From their first encounter, the viewer knows that this isn't going to end well.

A great performance of a great opera.  And in 3D to boot!",1345075200,9,2450,5.047381546134663
4830326,5,B005LVEFQI,"I began to develope a love for opera when my wife and I visited  Russia many years ago. Moving to the present, I have a 65"" 3-D tv with a Bose sound system.

4830327,1,B005LVEFQI,"My wife and I are very open-minded folks. But when I pay $40 to watch opera on blu-ray with my family, I don't need the surprise of being presented with pornography. Heads up skirts, fondling of genitalia, simulated sex: it's all here. Watching the opera somehow seems like watching a sex show in a dirty Eastern European back alley. Watching it just makes you feel dirty in a gritty, violated sort of way. Disgusting and disappointing.",1329523200,11,436,4.75
4830328,5,B005LVEFQI,"Coming to yet another version of this old favourite it was a pleasure to see it done well with a good cast who pushed all the right buttons. It is a very good performance and is an excellent introduction for anyone new to opera given the many interpretations which are available on CD and DVD. That is said in appreciation of the wide choice we have so to come to another version with many others in the background is the context for this review.
For me it is unfortunate that only a 3D version is available as it deserves wider distribution to those only able to see it in 2D.Given the time effort and technology involved the 3D experience is pleasurable but currently as flawed as it was in cinemas all those years ago when 3D movies were to be the next big thing so I wait with interest to see if it lasts.
Would I buy the equipment to watch this ? Not yet as international standards for 3D formats have yet to be settled so i would hold off for those and knowing that OLED screens are on the way.
SACD suffered in a format war and is now a niche market and perhaps 3D will go the same way-what is added to the catalogue will determine that so the tipping point has a long way to go.
So in the meantime pro : Adding spatiality on stage is a pleasing effect very well achieved.
All close-ups done sympathetically without unnecessary perspiration.
Camerawork is fluid clever and unobtrusive, costuming is excellent. Sets are apt and stagecraft overall is smooth.
Con : The limitations of the medium-having to watch with special glasses over one's spectacles is irritating as is the loss of picture brightness with active systems. (Roll on those which do away with them and I see they are on the technology horizon).
As for the performance- I'm more inclined to prefer Agnes Baltsa and Jose Carreras on dvd or add my own mind images listening to Victoria de Los Angeles and Nicolai Gedda with Sir Thomas Beecham on CD but that of course is just my preference.
Otherwise for those of us who have assembled the equipment with the caveats above this is an enjoyable experience of a good production. The sound is as good as others have said (even if not DTS which is odd- why would you not ?)
It's not my first choice but as a way of demonstrating the potential of good 3D effects it is worth having for that alone as an obvious labour of love in producing it. Hopefully more productions will pick up on this and I look forward to the first ballet performance in this format.",1329004800,,2471,4.409190371991247

8478632,5,B005LVEFQI,"Unfortunately, I do not have a Bluray 3D player or a 3D tv, so I wasn't able to watch my physical copy. However I did catch the film in theatres and I absolutely loved it. For those of you who have seen the Royal Opera House production with Anna Caterina Antonacci and Jonas Kaufman, this is the exact same production with different stars and a different conductor.

The main stars are very good, but they do seem a little bit camera shy and tend to make VERY small mistakes. This Carmen is conducted at a slower tempo than the performance with Anna Caterina. Christine Rice is a fantastic Carmen, she attacks it with her own style and flare, and she sings it with fervor and P-zaz which I don't say often. Bryan Hymel is a good Don Jose, not quite as good as Kaufman, but he gives his all for this role. Aris Argiris plays Escamillo, like Bryan Hymel, he is good but not fantastic and gives his all, but he is quite racy the moment you see him, there's this weird vibe that makes him attractive for some reason.

Francesca Zambello's production is pretty good too, I like her choreography and visual style, the production has Orange/Red as a main color and it has a very warm and passionate feel which works for the bold sensuality of the opera. The choreography in Act II is probably one of my favorites so far, next to The Met's 2010 choreography, during ""Les Tringles des sistres tintaient"" it's very fun to watch and it just draws you in. Fantastic!

All in all this production was very good, the only thing I would mark down was the make up which is hard to miss as it is caked on so everyone in the theatre can see it, I would've recommended film make up since it is filmed closer to the stage than others. I can overlook this though since the production is striking, and fantastic in many aspects. I think this version, along with the previous release with Anna Caterina Antonacci, is a must see! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1413849600,,1942,4.359116022099448
