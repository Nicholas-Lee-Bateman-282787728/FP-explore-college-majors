8271824,3,B0002IE43Y,"A passable French version of the Thousand and one Nights. The special effects are low tech but charming. It's a good movie, and it has the added interest of watching Catherine Zeta Jones (as Sheherazade) on one of her first film roles (she does look really young here). She has a couple of quite revealing nude scenes as well (so this may not really be for kids).",1198886400,8,363,4.432835820895522
