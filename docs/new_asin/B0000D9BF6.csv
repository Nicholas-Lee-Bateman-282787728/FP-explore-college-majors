So, on my copy it cost me nothing! You can't complain when this DVD won't cost you a cent. At no cost at all, you can forgive the flaws and just enjoy it for what it is. It is actually a resonable view on its own when you pay nothing to watch it!",1102464000,2,418,3.872093023255814
1921359,1,B0000D9BF6,"Let me start by saying that I loved the movies.  But this commentary uses supposed Tolkien experts that have never read the books!  In the movie Aragorn is a reluctant hero.  In the actual novel Aragorn has been preparing his entire life to claim, not reclaim, the throne of Gondor.  That is a huge discrepancy between the movies and the novel.  I am surprised that the ""experts"" did not notice.",1089244800,11,395,4.585714285714285
1921360,2,B0000D9BF6,"Where the original National Geographic Beyond the Movie - The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring was quite decent, providing an analogy of the creation of Middle Earth, and what personal events Tolkien probably inserted into his masterpiece, this one is the complete opposite.
While the concept basically is the same (interviews with the cast, experts, etc), the underlying theme is extremely poor. Basically the makers of this documentary start comparing characters in Lord of the Rings to real historical figures.
Wormtongue poisoned Theoden's mind with lies; Rasputin did the same. So Wormtongue might have been based on Rasputin. Aragorn dwelled in the wilderness for years, only to return and claim his throne. Theodore Roosevelt lost his wife and mother, and retreated to a ranch in Dakota; the wild. See the connection?
Characters in the Lord of the Rings most likely have not been based on any real persons. And if they were, I'm quite sure Professor Tolkien would have mentioned it somewhere. While even linking world events to Lord of the Rings was speculative, this is just stretching it.
Very poor.",1082246400,40,1122,5.037634408602151
1921361,1,B0000D9BF6,"""How LOTR is like real life"". Each segment attempts to explain why some historical figure is like a character in the movie, or vise versa. Terrible, bad - a middle school student could write a better script than this crap. Not even worth a rental.",1079913600,18,247,4.511111111111111
1921362,3,B0000D9BF6,"When I saw this I was happy for another show about Lord of the Rings because I love the books and the movies, but this is not really about the LOTR, is more about war and, really strange explanations about how is LOTR linked to history. I like History, I'm a historian myself but when I watched this I was expecting something really different :(, I give it 3 stars because I did had some spoilers about ROTK, but as a National Geographic work??, is not worth that much.",1073174400,22,469,4.280898876404494
1921363,5,B0000D9BF6,"I am an associate professor of English who has been living and teaching in Taiwan for thirty years and have recently added a course on Tolkien to the classes I teach. I have been delighted with this particular National Geographic program from the time I first purchased it through Amazon.com, but the ""English teacher"" in me feels that the point I tried to make in my initial review back in January could be made much more clearly in fewer words, so I am submitting this rewrite on July 30, 2004.
 First of all, I want to mention that it is no longer necessary to purchase this program by itself, as it is included as one of the extras in the DVD release of the theatrical version of The Return of the King.
 Secondly, I want to emphasize that this program is NOT trying to explain the factors and influences that led to Tolkien's creation of Middle-earth. That topic is covered very well for a one-hour program in a previous National Geographic release in connection with The Fellowship of the Ring.
 This program has to do with what Prof. Tolkien would call the ""applicability"" of his stories of Middle-earth. It is well known that Tolkien disliked people taking an allegorical or symbolic approach to his stories, for example, saying that the Ring represents the atomic bomb, Sauron represents Hitler, etc. He wanted people to see the ""applicability"" of his stories. This means that no matter whether we look back at history or around at current events or our own lives, we can find many, many examples of people and situations that are similar to those in the stories. Tolkien hoped that his stories would encourage us not to escape from reality but to think about it in all its complexity from new perspectives and in greater depth. And as his stories have become ever more widely read by readers in cultures and times different from Tolkien's own, these ""applications"" would, of course, include many that Tolkien himself hadn't thought of. This is one of the marks and benefits of great literature.
 The producers of this particular National Geographic program have presented us with what seem to them to be ""applications"" of the characters, situations, and themes in Tolkien's stories. These are certainly not the only possibilities; indeed, everyone who loves these stories probably has their own set of ""applications,"" some often quite personal. I found all of the examples provided here most interesting, especially the idea of Benjamin Franklin as an example of how Gandalf's outlook and values might look in the ""real world."" I quite understand, though, that not everyone would find all of these examples equally fascinating, but the program can still stimulate us to think more about our own ""applications.""
 Since the program is entitled ""Beyond the Movie,"" it does follow the film version of the story when that differs from the books. However, one can ask the question of why NG would bother to produce such a program? My own conjecture is that it had to do with the Oscar campaign for The Return of the King. Ever since The Lord of the Rings was published, some critics have dismissed it as ""escapist trash,"" and before the 2004 Oscar ceremony, no fantasy film had ever won the award for Best Picture, since such films had been perceived by Academy members as not ""serious"" enough. I believe that this program is trying to make the case for both Tolkien's creation and the films based on it, that this isn't ""escapist trash""! These stories have been so well loved for so many years not because everyone wants to escape reality but because the characters and their experiences speak very deeply to human struggles and aspirations. This program presents only a very small portion of all the possible ""applications,"" but I think it would be a very good program to share with those friends and family members who wonder why we Tolkien fans ""waste our time"" on Middle-earth! I still recommend this program very highly, whether you purchase it alone or as part of The Return of the King DVD package.",1073088000,12,4010,4.79739507959479
1921364,2,B0000D9BF6,"This has absolutly nothing to do with ""The Lord of the Ring"".  The title was just a poor excuse to use previously filmed stuff to tie into the movie as another meathod of that great Hollywood game HYPING.  I have seen some bad examples of the concept in my time but this one has got to be the worst.  I mean the movie does not even mention NEW ZELAND for God's sake shouldn't a movie supposidly showcasing where the movies were filmed at least attempt to do that.
Overall-Don't get suckered by the Lord of the Rings on the box, save your money.",1072828800,49,544,4.262135922330097
1921365,2,B0000D9BF6,"As being a huge fan of the books and the movies.
This was rather dissapointing. Comparing some of the LOTR's characters and battle odds to Franklin Roosefeld, the British army against the French and some other battles and persons in human history.
