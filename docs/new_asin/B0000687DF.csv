1723826,1,B0000687DF,"Monster-a-Go-Go! (Bill Rebane, 1965)

Bill Rebane (The Giant Spider Invasion), who would go on to be generally considered one of the worst directors of all time, first inflicted his vision of celluloid idiocy on the American public with Monster-a-Go-Go!, a sort of cross between fifties B monster movies and Reefer Madness!. (Weirdly, it bears more than a little resemblance to the later film The Incredible Melting Man. I have always wondered what drugs the makers of that movie were on; now I wonder how many times they watched Monster-a-Go-Go! and what drugs they were under the influence of while watching it.) Filmed by Rebane in 1961 and abandoned when he had trouble finding financing, Monster-a-Go-Go! Was given a new lease on life in 1965, when Herschell Gordon Lewis bought the footage from Rebane, finished the film uncredited (including doing the voiceovers), and released it, kick-starting Rebane's career as a horrendous filmmaker. Thank you, Mr. Lewis.

The plot, if you can call it that: a spacecraft crash-lands in America, and the retrieval team that goes to find the astronaut finds it empty. It seems the astronaut has been irradiated, and is now a ten-foot-tall cannibal mutant. Or something like that. Needless to say, every victim of the monster (other than the poor helicopter pilot who was sent to retrieve him--opportunistic murder FTW!) is someone who was doing something baaaaaaaaad. ""If only she'd danced with her boyfriend instead of that other boy..."". Yes. That's an actual line from the voiceover.

It is said that the producers of Mystery Science Theater 3000 considered this the worst film they'd seen until they first saw Manos: The Hands of Fate. I disagree; this is far, far worse than Manos could ever hope to be. Of course, I think this because Manos didn't have the simplistic, and utterly stupid, moralistic streak Lewis forced upon this movie, but that's by far not the only problem here. The acting is torrentially bad. (Yes, I know that makes no grammatical sense, but it popped into my head and I like it, so I'm leaving it there.) The direction is hackneyed and wooden. The editing seems to have been done by tossing the footage into a blender and pasting together whatever came out. The soundtrack is... well, okay, you have to watch this movie if only to hear Herschell Gordon Lewis' velvety voiceovers combined with the awful, electronic lounge music in most of the movie (and the bop in the very few scenes that give the movie the second half of its title). Seriously, Lewis' voiceovers? If you can ignore the moralistic dreck, they're the best thing about the movie. The guy could've sold ice to eskimos. Were he still around today, he'd have Ron Popeil over a barrel.

Truly, one of the worst movies ever made. (half)",1251331200,3,2770,4.912393162393163
1723827,1,B0000687DF,"Monster a Go-Go is quite simply, one of the worst movies ever made. It's a helluva lot of fun to watch because it's so badly made. There are more laughs here than in most so-called comedies. The level of filmmaking incompetence involved in this movie is mind boggling. How do you get such a large group of people, so untalented, together at the same time and place? It must have been a grand cosmic jest that the universe hoisted Monster a Go-Go on us. Even the title makes absolutely no sense.

The plot? Uh, ok, well there's this astronaut see, and when he comes back from space, he's a 10 foot tall, crusty-faced monster, wandering the coutryside strangling people. There are a group of NASA scientists investigating. They come to believe that the monster is actually their astronaut transformed by something he brought back from outer space. One of the scientists secretly captures the beast somehow and tries to cure him but instead the creature escapes, wreaking havoc everywhere he goes. The scientists devise some kind of plan to track him that isn't important because it's all gobbdegook. The movie ends by telling us the astronaut is found alive and well thousands of miles away. Huh?

Everything about the movie is terrible. No one can act, the direction and writing are abysmal. The print is so washed out that in one scene one man's face completely disappears. A narration was added because the dialog was impossible to hear.

But the true gem of a scene is the man sitting in his office who makes the sound of a ringing phone with his mouth, then answers it. Yes, they couldn't even afford to hook up the phone. Thank you Monster a Go-Go, for one of the best laughs I've ever had.",1208822400,5,1694,4.64
1723828,4,B0000687DF,"Good evening, and welcome to the first Saturday night devoted to watching one of the dozens of DVDs out there offering a double-feature of bad B-movies from the hey day of exploitation cinema.  The first feature on this DVD is the black & white ""Monster A-Go-Go"" from 1965, although I think the theme song is actually entitled  ""Go, Monster, Go,"" a catchy little rocker performed by The Other Three.  A space capsule comes back to Earth but lands in the woods outside of Chicago, so the police have trouble finding it.  A helicopter pilot finds the smallest space capsule you have ever seen, but the astronaut is missing.  Fortunately there is a scientist (you can tell because he carries a pipe) and he is able to shed light on the mystery before he goes back to the lab to figure out the dead helicopter pilot was literally ""cooked to death"" by radiation (this film has my type of bad science, which is so bad even I know it is bad).  We then cut suddenly to teenagers dancing in a basement somewhere.  This looks promising, especially when one couple go park in the guy's car.  He is pawing too much so she runs away, just in time to be spared as a really tall figure comes out of the dark and kills the guy really fast (but leaves all alone the annoying dog that keeps barking and barking and barking).

The really tall figure turns out to be the missing astronaut, Frank Douglas (Henry Hite), who is now 10-feet tall and has a face that looks like a lot like oatmeal.  Now the body count starts to rise.  In fact, just to make sure there is no suspense the announcer tells us that the next victim is about to be killed.  This is one movie where being the scientist does not mean you get to be the hero, just another corpse, because even with a Geiger counter a 10-foot tall monster can sneak up on you and kill you.  Either the announcer informs us that the character we are looking at is going to die (because they have problems like an ""extraordinarily bad sense of timing""), at which point we watch the character for several minutes and then the monster shows up and kills them, or we watch some people who escape from the monster.  The monster is not that bad, but there is so little of him and the thrilling conclusion is pretty much off screen.  The ratio between action and dialogue is really skewed towards the latter, which is strange because the two things really pushed in the trailer for ""Monster A-Go-Go"" are action and pretty girls, and there is not that much action (3 stars).

The best part of this DVD is all the stuff in between the two features.  There is a homemade horror short, ""Bedtime Booga Booga,"" which is pretty lame, and a ""Trippy Short"" called ""Psyched by the 2D Dot,"" which torments a naked dancer with a black dot.  Then there is ""Driving Miss Daisy Crazy,"" which I think is a relatively recent attempt to make a sexploitation film in the manner of the 1960s (but I cannot prove it one way or the other).  A socialite in New York City has a husband who is trying to drive her crazy, giving her drugs so that he can take Polaroids while her psychiatrist, the maid, and other people do ""disgusting"" things to her.  An interesting excuse for nudity, but since the main character thinks it is all ""disgusting"" it must be all right to show it and this short is better than both the features put together.  The high points are the opportunity to get a witch deflector to protect you during ""Witchcraft"" and the fact that a movie of unspeakable horror (""Eyes of Hell,"" formerly ""The Mask"") is rated PG.  The only complaint is that I do not seem to be able to find any of these movies readily available on DVD (4 stars).

Then you can enjoy the second feature, the R-rated ""Psyched by the 4-D Witch (A Tale of Demonology),"" which is filmed in ""Transetheric Vision"" according to the opening credits, which translated into heavily saturated red.  Since the film is supposed to look like an acid trip you can only wonder what it would do to somebody actually tripping on LSD.  Again we have a rock song at the beginning that warns us to ""beware of the 4-D Witch"" (and keeps popping up through the movie).  The story begins with Cindy (Margo, the mother of Eddie Albert, Jr. apparently), engaging in a sexual candlelight ritual.  Cindy is the descendant of an early colonial witch named Abigail, who contacts her across the chasm of whatever separates them and offers Cindy unlimited orgasms (while keeping her virginity for daddy).  The next thing we know Cindy is possessed by Abigail and this film continues to try and take its tongue and drive it right through both cheeks.

Basically Cindy has a series of sexual adventures, which she numbers (the alternative is grading them and that would not be good).  In keeping with the witchcraft theme, a snake becomes prominent at one point.  This 1972 film was conceived, written and directed by Victor Luminera and also stars Esoterica as the Witch, Tom Yerian as the Vampire (when he appears the movie goes all the way down the drain), and Kelly Guthrie as Mr. Jones, the homosexual neighbor who dares to reject Cindy's advances.  There are also a host of Astral demons.  This is one of those films that is so cheap that all of the dialogue consists of voice overs, which is rather important because you hear more than you see in this particular film (and you hear a lot of great classical music at key moments, including Ravel's ""Bolero,"" of course).  This movie is too silly to be sexy and too dumb to be funny (2 stars, which is a total of 9 stars, divide by two for the double-feature, which would be 4.5, which is too high, so we round down to 4 stars in terms of entertainment value rather than any idea of quality).

That is it for this go around, boys and girls.  Come back next week when the double-feature will be ""The Ghastly Ones"" and ""Seeds of Sin.""",1109376000,4,5836,4.482986767485822
1723829,5,B0000687DF,"In Monster-A-Go-Go a space capsule returns to earth, crashing off-course. When it is located, the pilot is missing. Meanwhile a giant with bad skin is slowly shambling towards a city and everyone who comes near him drops dead from radiation poisoning.  Could the giant really be the astronaut?  And will the army remember that it has weapons such as sniper rifles capable of killing people from a distance before the film ends?
The best thing about Monster-A-Go-Go is its title, there is a gratuitous dance club scene, and the monster (played by a real giant) looks great (but you rarely get to see him). The more scientifically advanced viewer will find some amusement in the claim that the monster is becoming increasingly radioactive, causing his radius of danger to increase, when by definition any object which is radioactive becomes less dangerous over time (otherwise it cannot be giving off radiation!!) And there is a phone which does not ring until 7 minutes after it has already been answered (bad soundtrack).  But mostly you get dull talky dialogue between people just standing around and detailed narration, most of it dubbed in, all of which put me to sleep more easily than accounting classes.  The film is too tedious to watch without fastforwarding through most of it, even for a fan of old monster films like myself who doesn't expect to see gore, death and special fx every few seconds. This gets a very weak 2 star rating.
But you get more than your money's worth with Psyched by the 4D Witch. This is, hands down, THE most insane film ever made, and is almost beyond description (except by giving a detailed blow-by-blow account). It is sort of like a combination of one of Ed Wood's last few films (e.g. One Million AC/DC) and a REALLY intense, bad acid trip. Every few seconds you will ask yourself ""WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!"" I can't imagine even people going to a theatre completely stoned out of their minds failing to question the sanity of the filmmakers. From the beginning until the very end of the film you will think things cannot get any stranger, but they do! Not one single second of the film has visuals which are not weird or experimental. The acid rock theme song played repeatedly throughout the film is also hilarious and will haunt your brain for the rest of your life. Even during the most serious business meeting a voice singing ""Beware of the 4D Witch, Beware!"" will suddenly pop into your head. Could this film have been part of some sort of otherworldly psychological warfare program targeting the unsuspecting peoples of Earth? Perhaps! I'm wondering when the invasion will begin.",1045440000,30,2628,4.807522123893805

7964074,5,B0000687DF,"Call 'em what you will, Bad Films, Z-Grade Cinema, Schlock Movies, or outright Celluloid Crud; the bottom line for me is these types of entertainment are UNIQUE in themselves. Many will run in the opposite direction from them while holding their nose to keep out the stink. Me? I like to INHALE the often intoxicating odor of these low-to-no-budget wonders, because they are wonders, as in they make me wonder about them, who made them, how much more interesting their lives and imaginations must have been compared to the person who was able to produce a movie without any more effort than phoning in the finance.

As you can imagine, this type of outlook does not gain one many friends and/or alliances, but Schlock Movies need love too. The beauty of Schlock is that, for the sake of all appearances, it is a dead art. Unless I am mistaken, no one ever intended to make a Schlock film. I like to think they had a VISION and made the best film (under the budget constraints) that they possibly could.

Alright, alright, I'm already seeing contradictions in what i just wrote and besides that, I'm here to review this mind-bending DVD combo of two perfect examples of Schlock and as usual I'm trying to analyze my own philosophy on why I keep searching for and finding movies such as these, and no one cares about that (especially me).

Just look at that cover! ""Monster A Go-Go"", the title alone, it's driven me nuts for decades, I can remember reading about this in the eighties in that first book about H.G. Lewis, how he bought an unfinished kids film and Herschelled it up. Or something like that, it's been a long time and that book got so devoured that it fell apart, BUT there were only a few options at that time to see any of his films on VHS, and ""Monster A Go-Go"" was not, to my knowledge, on a commercially available tape.

So here it is in all of it's glory (and it's so good), but wait, it's only the OPENING FEATURE (of a double feature).

""Psyched By The 4-D Witch""? They must have done cartwheels when they thought of that title! You won't believe it, but - and here's where it gets incredible - the movie is even more hallucinatory than the title. Yes. that's what I said. Even more.

How so? While watching it, it made me feel like time would jerk to a stop, then open up a pocket which I would drop into then when only my head was sticking up out of the time-pocket, the film would lurch to a start again, and I had to leap up out of the pocket before my fool head got chopped off in the process. Plus there are dirty words in this movie, and other things. Things best not spoken of. I could not stop watching it. After subjecting myself to countless years of Schlock films, I had never experienced anything like THIS. It had a power over me. I do not take drugs.

So should you buy it? What do you think? If you've read this far you will know whether the time-pocket has arrived and you are ready to drop in. Who knows? Maybe you'll see me. I'll be in that other pocket. For this inscrutable film keeps calling me back again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again...",1502409600,,3210,4.357859531772576

7964076,2,B0000687DF,"Some movies are so bad that they're good, and others are so bad that you can't watch them. Unfortunately BOTH of the films included in this package are the latter.

""Monster a Go-Go"" is thought of as one of the worst movies of all time, but it's not one of the worst in a ""gee-whiz""  kind of way (Like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" and others), where you have to keep watching the train wreck. It's just flat-out dull. There isn't enough here to hold your attention for more than maybe 10 seconds. I had been hoping (expecting) a lot of bad SFX, horrible stage makeup, bad acting--unintentionally funny moviemaking. Instead there's a frightful amount of pointless exposition and essentially no action. You couldn't really fill a thimble with the plot, but that's to be expected, and there's no reason for me to go through it again when everyone else on here has done that already.

Believe it or not, ""Psyched by the 4-D Witch"" is actually worse. Visually it's nearly impossible to look at, with it's never-ending psychedelic displays. There is no on-set audio at all; the only vocals are narrated voiceovers. And don't be fooled by other reviewers who say that it has ""an abundance"" of nudity...there is a fleeting amount, and what is there isn't titillating enough to hold your attention. I'm sure that this was the best copy in existence but it's been pretty obviously edited, even for foul language.

The only thing that saves this double feature from getting one star from me are the extras, which are very strong: Two different very brief features, a great short and a slide show of old monster-movie posters along with original radio commercials for some of them. All three of the video features pretty obviously had their names changed to fit the theme of the package--I'm sure that the original titles have been lost to the sands of time. The short ""Driving Miss Daisy Crazy"" is quite good and the lead character is a hottie who gets naked often on the roughly 30-minute presentation.",1406937600,,2026,4.747159090909091
7964077,4,B0000687DF,"Monster A-Go Go(1965/69 mins/B&W) is a screwy sci-fi flick about a 10-foot monster that has landed on earth and manages to baffle/evade the authorities even though he moves about as fast as a snail and is about as bright as a log. The movie is slow moving/dull and whenever someone talks it sounds like they are in some echo chamber.

Psyched By The 4D Witch(1972/81 mins) is quite an acid trip of a movie with groovy far-out images and Cindy who is possessed by a Salem witch. Throughout the movie we hear Cindy's oh so cute voice narrating the on-screen action as well as random shots of mundane city life interspersed among the psychedelic imagery. Of the two movies I enjoyed this a whole lot more.

There's a 36 min featurette called Driving Miss Daisy Crazy(B&W) where a young affluent wife is being driven into madness by her conniving husband as he comes up with some of the most bizarre ploys in order to take over her estate. There's also two short subjects Bed Time Booga Booga(4:51) and Psyched By the 2D Dot(2:16/B&W). The first short involves a guy who falls asleep in his attic bedroom and wakes up in a scene resembling 'Night of the Living Dead' except with cheap-looking mask. The second short involves a naked woman being attacked by a black-ink blot.

And there's a Gallery of Horrorama Drive-In Exploitation Art and Radio-Spot Rarities(5:41) featuring movie posters of horror and exploitation flicks from the 60's and 70's along with spooky radio ads. And finally there are a dozen creepy trailers including Blood Bath, Bourbon Street Shadows, Creature of the Walking Dead, Eyes of Hell, Frankenstein Meets the Space Monsters, Insect-o thon Midnight Show, Monster A-Go Go, Psycosissimo, Something Weird, Tales of the Bizarre, and Witchcraft/The Horror of It All!",1383177600,,1783,4.897350993377484

7964079,3,B0000687DF,"When Image/Something Weird Video releases a double or triple feature DVD, there's usually a theme running throughout the contents.  But MONSTER A GO-GO and PSYCHED BY THE 4-D WITCH have nothing in common, with fans of one film probably not interested in the other.  (You almost have to wonder if the guys at SWV found they had enough stuff left over in the vault to fill up one more DVD and went for it, regardless of how it all fit together.)

MONSTER A GO-GO is a pedestrian-paced black & white sci-fi thriller that started filming in 1961 with director Bill Rebane, but the production was shut down for a few years until director Herschell Gordon Lewis finished it in 1965.  The film's plot, such as it is, concerns an American astronaut whose space capsule crashes back to Earth, the astronaut turned into a deformed killer by radiation.  (When military officials discover the tiny empty space capsule, it's painfully obvious that no adult could squeeze into the thing unless it had the usual gadgets and gizmos needed to make the craft fly ripped out...and even then it would be a tight fit.)  PSYCHED BY THE 4-D WITCH, on the other hand, is a 1973 sexploitation film shot on 16mm that tells the tale of a young gal guided by the spirit of a witch ancestor into a voyage of sexual discovery while magic keeps her virginity intact.  (The colorful psychedelic imagery seems inspired in part by Roger Corman's THE TRIP from a few years earlier.)

MONSTER A Go-GO would have probably been better paired with something like PSYCHO A GO-GO, BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS or FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE SPACE MONSTER.  While it would be hard to come up with a good match for THE 4-D WITCH, it might play well with PLEASE DON'T EAT MY MOTHER (another Image/Something Weird release that, for some reason, was put out as a stand-alone title).  And, as usual with Something Weird discs, you get a fistful of bonus goodies (trailers, featurettes, etc) that are also an eclectic collection here.  The contents may not necessarily compliment each other but, in terms of quantity, you're getting a decent amount of bang for the buck.",1370908800,,2109,4.7193460490463215

It is basically 60 minutes of people sitting around tables talking about boring-as-hell crap, and 8 minutes of extremely boring non-violent ""action"". If you count seeing a helicopter land (not crash) as ""action"". The so-called monster is on screen literally for less than 10 seconds of screen time, and you only ever see him interact with another character once. Briefly.

It's nice they included extras, but they are extremely forgettable nudie cuties from the 60s.

Psyched by the 4-D Witch is basically a psychedelic nudie cutie. Again, forgettable.
