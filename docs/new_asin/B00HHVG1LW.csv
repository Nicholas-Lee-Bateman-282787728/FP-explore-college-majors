6164214,5,B00HHVG1LW,"Positively hilarious. I remember watching these shows on TV back in the early 70's; I cracked up watching them back then, and I still crack up watching them today. Good, clean, wholesome comedy without the rude, obnoxious, dirt of todays low blow insults that count as today's style of comedy. It just goes to prove, you don't have to swear or be filthy in your comedy act, to be funny. Unless of course, you stink as a comedian and have to resort to that sort of ""below the belt"" comedy, just to get a laugh. These folks were REAL entertainers and comedians. They were classy and well dressed. Plus, there was no harm seeing an actor with a martini in one hand and a cigarette in the other. Back then you wouldn't get ""roasted"" by the liberal PC police simply for being human, like we are today. These Celebrity Roast DVDs display actors and comedians with class. It was just goo clean fun. I believe all ages can watch these episodes and enjoy them for what they are. That is, if you can drag them away from their cell phones and video games for an hour. Classic comedy indeed.",1450483200,3,1079,4.42713567839196

6164216,4,B00HHVG1LW,"Entertaining trio of Dean Martin roasts featuring Bette Davis, then-Governor Ronald Reagan (both in 1973) and Betty White (1978). Alternately hilarious and sloppy, these celebrity-filled skewerings are held together by numerous edits, obvious canned laughter and affectionate nostalgia. Worth revisiting for the unique talents we will never see again.",1443571200,2,351,6.183673469387755

8632835,3,B00HHVG1LW,"I never really realized how lit Dean Martin was in all his shows. I have seen a lot of his roasts and this one wasn't one of his best. Betty White was so young in this show. However, compared to the roasts on Comedy Central today Dean Martin's roasts seem pretty tame. This show was some good old fashion slap stick that will make you reminisce of back in the day. I love the Dean Martin show and his roast series. This one was just kind of on the lame side.",1483920000,,458,4.043956043956044
