8327061,1,B001NHZ2LG,The DVD that I bought did not playback correctly.  The playback was fragmented and MovieMars made me print out a return form and also they made me ship it back to them.  They should have just sent me another copy. I have mailed the DVD back and I am waiting to hear back from them. At this time I am disappointed with MovieMars.,1242172800,,328,4.190476190476191
8327062,2,B001NHZ2LG,"Awesome game with a nail-biting finale.  The bonus features really left a lot to be desired.  I was expecting things such as ""Texas vs. Oklahoma Condensed Game Highlights"", ""Texas vs. Oklahoma State Condensed Game Highlights"", ""Post/Pre-Heisman Interview with Colt McCoy"", clips of the team prepping for the Fiesta Bowl, and an interview with Mack Brown.  The 2006 Rose Bowl (when Texas won the National Championship) had really great bonus features similar to what I mentioned.  I had the chance to buy just the iTunes download of this which would've been much cheaper, but bought the DVD because I've been used to good bonus features that can't be found elsewhere.

My advice - if you're looking for a copy of the game, just get the itunes download and save your money...you won't get much more with the DVD.",1241395200,,810,4.883211678832117

8327064,5,B001NHZ2LG,This game was as good as it gets.  OSU in my opinion outplayed Texas for most of it and then with time running out McCoy threw the winning td.  Props to both teams for playing a great game and one that will be remembered forever.  Hook'Em,1233014400,3,238,4.130434782608695
8327065,5,B001NHZ2LG,"All I can say about this game is WOW. Despite the fact that we lost in the final seconds of the game, this finally proved that Ohio State was more than just a Big football program, and that we could play in the big games with some of the nations top teams. I have said it once and will say it over and over, any team on any given day can beat any team no matter what conference they play in. Too bad we blew it in the end!! Oh well there is always next year. The first half was full of D from both teams, and the second half was when the game became really exciting. 3rd quarter belonged to the Longhorns as they took the lead and seamed to be taking over the game completely. That is untill the Buckeyes offense woke up and scored 2 touchdowns in the 4th quarter to take a 21-17 lead. But as I said before, we blew it in the end. Colt McCoy would go on to throw the winning touchdown pass to Cosby with 16 seconds left, and left Buckeye fans all over the world with there jaws hanging. But it was a hell of a game non the less. I will be adding the DVD to my Ohio State collection despite the loss, because it was a great game, and one that Texas and Ohio State fans can appreciate for years and years to come.",1231632000,10,1211,3.946938775510204
