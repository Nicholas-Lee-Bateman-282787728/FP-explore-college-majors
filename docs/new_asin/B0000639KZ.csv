7959034,5,B0000639KZ,"Being the mom of a train obsessed almost 3 year old has qualified me as somewhat of an expert on train videos for kids.  This one ranks among the top choices for several reasons: 1) Film footage of the trains is very good, clear, and interesting; 2) Narration and printed words make the video educational, but not cumbersome; 3) Jim Coffey's music is fun to listen to; 4) Footage of trains & signals from France & Spain expand train interest to other technologies & systems; 5) Jeff McComas is growing up to be my son's idol (he refers to him as ""my friend Jeff""); and perhaps most importantly, 6) My son has owned this video for 6 months and still asks for it at least 3 times a week.  What more could a parent ask for in a kids video?  Looking forward to more in this series!",1036281600,21,777,4.272108843537415
