8478577,1,B005LURIEU,"I have created this petition from my passion for a late 80s show called ""Out of this World"". After a long and frustrating search I have decided to give the power to the people. I would like to purchase this dvd box set, however, it is not available in North America. So lets ban together and make this a reality. Please help me and all those who love this classic show enjoy it once again.

8478579,4,B005LURIEU,I loved this series as a kid I really wish they would release the complete series here in the usa. It seems like all the best stuff from the states gets released in europe but not here. That all said if you have a dvd player that plays overseas discs I highly recommend this dvd set.,1464652800,2,283,4.071428571428571
8478580,4,B005LURIEU,"I was hoping it would include more of the first 2 seasons, I'm hoping that a volume 2 will be released soon. If not volume 2, an all inclusive DVD set. I was thrown off by the voice of Troy in the first episode, but in all the other episodes the voice of Troy was Burt Reynolds.",1455926400,2,278,3.8947368421052633
