8446735,5,B004XC7PTA,This documentary showcases Holzer's recent work while providing a short but informative summary of her early work for those who may come to the film knowing nothing about her. I like that Holzer talks about her own work more than the galllerists or art historians do. Holzer comes across as articulate and free of conceit.  Holzer's art remains relevant to even very young artists while she remains true to her own vision- a rare accomplishment.,1356566400,2,445,4.933333333333334
