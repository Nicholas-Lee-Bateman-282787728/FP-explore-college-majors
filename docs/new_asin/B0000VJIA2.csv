8091245,3,B0000VJIA2,"A twenty-something male and female learn some speed driving concepts (dealing with oversteer, understeer, left-food braking, hairpin turn with handbrake) on an ice covered lake from expert Norwegian rally driver John Haugland.  Haugland demonstrates the techniques, and then you watch them learn to do those techniques with Haugland coaching from the passenger seat.  Plus fluff at the beginning and end.  The production values are acceptable, but it feels much more like a TV show than a training video -- for instance, it spent time introducing us to the male and female learners at the beginning and watching them race each other at the end.  I skipped all that.

Total time watching Haugland drive and teach (from passenger seat) is about 26 minutes of 52 total.  I did learn some things, and I'm sure Haugland is a great driver, but the video is more shallow than I expected.  But it still might be worth it if you can't find the info on youtube.",1509235200,,951,4.833333333333333
