8586454,4,B00CU9QDCI,It was a fun Ova series to watch. Story was bite weak but good.,1486684800,,63,3.5714285714285716
8586455,3,B00CU9QDCI,"After&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Irresponsible-Captain-Tylor-Complete-TV-Series/dp/B00C6ATFSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Irresponsible Captain Tylor Complete TV Series</a>&nbsp;these 10 OVA episodes were created with somewhat mixed results.  Clearly, at least after the first story ""Tylor's War"" (and the creator's death), attempts were being made to ""serious up"" the stories, but since this usually involved leaving Captain Tylor out of it, it is unclear how successful this was going to be.  On the one hand the 8 following OVA's made a fascinating attempt to tell individual segments of what turned out to be an interrelated story, but on the other, as viewers will find at the end, this all amounted to a prelude to a second TV series that was never made because the story in the OVA's was never finished.

Note: Nozomi Entertainment and Right Stuf! deserve credit for doing an excellent job of re-releasing an  anime classic by including ship data, music videos, and the Liner Notes explaining (very briefly, among other things) how the series would continue in the books though the anime ended here.",1477353600,2,1161,5.85207100591716
8586456,1,B00CU9QDCI,"The Irresponsible Captain Tylor television series was pretty great, but the sequel series, (this OVA,) is pretty much garbage. The fun loving and zany adventures from the first series are replaced with angsty melodrama, as they twist the plot around and take it from lighthearted to dark and soul crushing. Perhaps if it was done well, the change in pacing and genre wouldn't have been so bad. Sadly, it was not done well.",1437436800,2,422,4.794520547945205
8586457,3,B00CU9QDCI,I wasn't as impressed with the OVA series as I was the original series which I loved. It was still good but there was less humor and it focused more on the supporting characters and less on Captain Tylor (who was absent from many episodes). I found some episodes were slow and probably could have been shortened and combined with other episodes without losing anything.,1432252800,2,369,4.6923076923076925
8586458,4,B00CU9QDCI,Good .. 2000 a little dated. But worth watching!,1430265600,,48,4.444444444444445
8586459,5,B00CU9QDCI,"This funny, quaky space captain continues to wow his crew with a funny way of justice in space history.  The ova is an awesome sequel to the first series. It is very well worth the buy.  For many of you who are younger in generation this movie may have some 90's techno sounds but, that is more of the reason to like this series.  I have shown this series to friends much younger than I am and they just can't get enough.",1387324800,2,421,4.109756097560975
