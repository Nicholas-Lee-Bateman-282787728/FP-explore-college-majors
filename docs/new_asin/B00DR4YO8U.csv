5848411,5,B00DR4YO8U,"Initially I had a problem with one disc in season 1 and it would not play. I tried cleaning it to no avail, I could see some separation of the two polycarbinate platters that make up the disc in the center of the disc. I placed warrantly claim and they responded quickly. I got busy and didn't have time to send the disc in. A few weeks later I remembered I still had to finish this out but I went ahead and retried the disc again before returning it. And amazingly it plays now. No idea what caused it to work again, but I'll just let sleeping dogs lie I guess.",1457308800,3,562,4.072072072072072

5848423,5,B00DR4YO8U,"There were re-runs of Stargate: Atlantis playing on one channel.  It made me think about how I missed SGU and wish it could have lasted longer than two seasons.  Guess it's better than only have one season (Browncoats!!) and the cast for both is awesome.  I love the way SGU makes you think about the exploration of universes and the differences of the few people trapped on a spaceship.  Those ancestral stones to communicate with people on Earth, now that would be an experience.  I have started Season 2 but went back to SGA, bought them too, because I don't want to finish watching SGU yet.",1513641600,,594,4.566037735849057
5848424,5,B00DR4YO8U,I am a fan of Science Fiction and it absolutely terrible that they cancelled this show. Every time I watch it I am so disappointed to not see the plot and characters continue. To have a show where people face the unknown and how they respond to it individually and collectively is fascinating. And to have a diverse set of people rather than those that were prepped for that situation is good to see. There are so many challenges and discoveries that are meaningful in this show and the acting is brilliant. I will continue to buy this show for people as gifts and hopefully one day it will come back. In the meantime Dark Matter is also a fantastic show made by a lot of the same crew as SGU as has a similar vibe if not possible storyline continuations of SGU.,1512604800,3,762,4.335664335664336
5848425,1,B00DR4YO8U,"This was the most annoying Stargate spinoff ever!! I tried to give it a chance and watched the first few episodes, but that Dr. Rush was such a terrible character that I couldn't stand to watch it anymore. Plus, it seemed like they didn't have enough money in their budget because most everything happened on their spaceship. I'm not quite understanding the good reviews for this ridiculous excuse of a Stargate spinoff. No wonder it only lasted 2 seasons.",1510963200,2,456,4.784810126582278

5848436,1,B00DR4YO8U,"SGU was an effort to change the Stargate series from a family friendly show into a mindless sexcapade. It had none of the heart of the other two series and the fact that it failed miserably proves that the shows producers had no clue about what made the original successful or who the fans were. The fact is that this show was so lousy that if it were not for the Stargate name attached to it the thing would never have made it onto the air.  Do not waste your time or money on this show. If you want Stargate, watch the first two series, if you want dark plots and random sex scenes try Battlestar Galactica.",1496620800,7,609,4.205128205128205

Due to an attack on the base, survivors are forced to use the gate to escape and wind up on a starship in the next Galaxy.  Not enough power to go home, the crew quickly find the ship is a self piloting, million year old ship of a dead race known as the Ancients.

The short lived (two seasons) series take the survivors on a trip across and between galaxies, with life being a struggle to learn how the ship works, make repairs, fine food, water and other things needed for survival.

Not bad...interesting ending.",1477958400,5,657,4.581196581196581

5848465,1,B00DR4YO8U,"It's no surprise that this series only lasted two seasons. This is by far the most depressing offering in the SG franchise or any other science fiction production I have ever seen for that matter. Robert Carlyle portrays one of the main characters, Doctor Nicholas Rush--the most unsympathetic, self-centric and supercilious character ever; and the actor's cold-fish and generally deadpan performance didn't help. Same for Lou Diamond Phillips' character (Colonel Telford), who has no moral conscience although he is supposed to be one of the good guys, and last, but not least, the meddling and self-righteous Camile Wray, the HR person and civilian representative for the International Oversight Committee, portrayed by Ming-Na Wen. Why the writers chose to develop these characters this way eludes me; in the other SG series we encountered a myriad of characters--good and evil--but somehow you were able to relate to them one way or another; not so in this series. In fact, one of its main drawbacks is that the characters never seem to gel together and are constantly double-crossing and working against each other to the point of annoyance--the net result is that the series seems to stall and not move forward in a productive way. If this was the way the writers chose to create dramatic tension they failed miserably. Another problem is that most of the action takes place in a dark, gloomy, rusty spaceship; the occasional planet forays are not enough to relieve the mind-bogging tedium. So in the end, I forced myself to continue to watch this dismal program because I was hoping Dr. Rush, Colonel Telford and Camile would get their comeuppance, that's how annoying these characters were. You know you are dealing with a turkey when you want to see several of the main characters (and presumably good guys) killed before the series ends. Enough said.",1473465600,6,1860,5.042207792207792

8596556,5,B00DR4YO8U,"This series of stories was really well done.  The only flaw was the fact it was canceled when it was, rather than play the story out to a proper point to end it.  I actually watched this series completely before having seen any of the original SG-1 series.  I came into it with only having watched the original movie that set off all of these stories.  I liked the original story and came to like SGU, as well.  Recently I've had the opportunity to watch the SG-1 series from the first show and going through it with the stories in chronological order.  I am often surprised when something is presented in the first series that makes me think of something I saw in SGU and that now comes back to me and it seems like it was answering questions first posed in the original series.  SGU's story lines were well laid out in plot development.  Character development was also full and realistic, bringing the characters to life as real people with real problems and lives.  It's a real shame that the story was ended when and where it was.  I will say that at least it left me feeling that if the story and the people were in a real situation, there was at least hope that things would work out to an exciting and fulfilling ending.  As it is, it's unlikely the series will be picked up and given a chance to be fully appreciated, but someone could make a great movie that would pick things up from that last scene and go on to give a complete story with a real finish.  While it's been a few years since the last story was done, picking things up a few years later would seem to fit in perfectly where it was left off.",1530144000,,1614,4.2730263157894735
