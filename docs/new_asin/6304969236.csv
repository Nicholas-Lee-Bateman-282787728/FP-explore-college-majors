943919,5,6304969236,"this is one of my most loved anime it is short, 60 min. but it was almost nonstop killer sword action!",953510400,,102,3.9047619047619047
943920,3,6304969236,"I really can't recommend this purchase for anyone other than as a mild adrenaline rush.  The animation is uneven and attends mediocrity at times which is unfortunate because the underlying story is pretty entertaining.  The tale revolves around a ruthless warlord that is somehow using advanced  weapons to overthrow his opponents and has enlisted the powers of the  notorious ninja killer, the immortal Gennai Doma.  A crack team of ninjas  is charged with the seemingly impossible task of assasinating Gennai.  It's  not the best anime by far, but nor is it the worst.  However, that's not  saying much.  Had the animators pursued the final product more vigorously  they could have come up with something rather good.",952819200,,719,5.103448275862069
943921,4,6304969236,"Black Lion is a great movie for anyone who enjoys blood, gore, or laughing at cheesy voice acting.  I didn't enjoy the animation as I had with other movies though.  Some of it is just plain ugly, yet most of it is above  average.  I strongly reccommend this movie to anyone who likes dragonball  Z. It's battles have the same look. This is definetly worth buying in my  opinion.",950832000,,378,4.405797101449275

7880106,5,6304969236,This anime was entertaining! A great spin on Terminator in anime form. I love martial arts action in anime. Need more like this.,1381795200,,128,4.608695652173913

7880108,4,6304969236,Go Nagai is usually known for over the top sexually themed anime. But Black lion is a  entirely different side of him that hasn't been seen before or since. This film is actually one of the best early examples of ninja action I have seen. The only series at the time that may come close is Kabuto. If you grew up on stuff like Enter the Ninja then this would definitely appeal to you. It also has an interesting sci-fi aspect to it as well. I really enjoyed this dvd and wish they had finished the series!,1323907200,,505,4.206185567010309
7880109,3,6304969236,"And why, you might ask? Because it is the absolute WORST dub I have heard... ever. And man, that is saying something, after watching Yotoden, Lost Universe, and Crest Of The Stars. It makes William Shatner look like a master performer, and the dub script makes the writers on Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers look like William Shakespeare. That being said, this anime is one of those types that's SO terrible, it's almost good. Ninjas and Feudal Japanese wars are a pretty common theme in anime, but what are the odds that they will be mixed together with robotic technology? Only Go Nagai, creator of stupidly enjoyable nonsense such as Shuten Doji and Cutey Honey, could think that sort of thing up. The music (there isn't much, but there is at least a main theme) is CHEEEEEEEEEZY to the max; pure 80's cheese. The violence is GRAPHIC; you even see a man's face get squashed and watch his EYES fall out. The story is somewhat nonsensical; there isn't much background story, nor does it really stay all that consistent. But, the action is solid; the artwork is nice to look at if you don't mind Go Nagai's trademark modest touch of ugliness, and it's actually quite fluidly animated. I certainly can't say I recommend it based on any of this, but if you're looking for an inoffensive, action packed, and just plain STUPID thing to watch, then rent this off Netflix and watch it dubbed. I'm sure plenty of hardcore otakus will have many a joke to make at the expense of this OVA if they watch it.",1313712000,,1494,4.599250936329588
7880110,5,6304969236,"Just like Devilman, Mazinger Z, and Violence Jack - black lion proves that detail-oriented anime artists of the 90's - combined with creative masterminds like go nagai - produced the best anime of all time.  This is a must-see for anyone who likes Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter D, Mad Bull, Golgo 13, MD Geist, Guyver, Yoma, Space Cobra, Fist of the Northstar... and so on.  People who enjoy the Friday the 13th, Terminator, and George Romero movies will also appreciate... If only they'd release a large compilation of Go Nagai's work in English.",1220918400,,546,4.860215053763441
7880111,5,6304969236,"This anime is one of the best action oav animes i've seen with alot of gore, and the way people think, talk, and move is realistic.

Alot of people are saying why is there robots in the 1500s with guns.. Well that answer is simple, there is an old man that is the leader of the upper class ninja that had a computer that was asking ""the time department for help"". As he was typing on his computer it showed areas of the world. He even said that ""the warlord/ninja killer has things that don't belong to this time, I must talk to the time department for assistence"".

Hope that helps confussion.

Its a great anime, really good quality for being an anime from ""1989""",1122854400,7,665,4.304
7880112,4,6304969236,"The story is OK, the animation is fair but there is a lot of action and it is nice and bloody.",985824000,,94,3.5238095238095237
