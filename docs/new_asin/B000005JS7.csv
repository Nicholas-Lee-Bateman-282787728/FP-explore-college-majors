1184658,1,B000005JS7,"LONELY IS AN EYESORE, released in 1987, is a compilation which was intended as a sampler of music of the influential British label 4AD. It appeared both as an audio CD and as a videocassette with music videos directed by 23 Envelope's Nigel Grierson.
The video is, to be frank, an immense disappointment. Grierson is an incredibly talented photographer, one glimpse at his shots on the cover of This Mortal Coil's IT'LL END IN TEARS or on most of the Cocteau Twin's albums in the 80's will show that. However, he has little skill in creating music videos. The opening video, Dead Can Dance - ""Frontier"", is a chaotic, unevenly filmed mess (and Lisa Gerrard's bride-of-Frankenstein hairdo doesn't add any appeal for the viewer). Colourbox - ""Hot Doggie"" is the usual 80's video, instantly forgettable. Dead Can Dance - ""The Protagonist"" consists of mindnumbingly repetitive shots of foliage and the sky, and seems to lack any sort of message. Cocteau Twins - ""Crushed"" is an okay video, and the scene of Liz Fraser laughing after the song is rather charming, but one gets the idea that the video didn't intentionally turn out that good. The Wolfgang Press - ""Cut the Tree"" is hilarious, although I've yet to fathom what exactly it's getting at.
Another problem with LONELY IS AN EYESORE is that the music has dated immensely. Although the tracks were wonderful at the time of their release and might have been considered to represent the best of 4AD's output in that era, the style now comes across as passe and doesn't captivate. Considering that Dead Can Dance were in their prime, the Cocteau Twins were getting ready to release the ""Love's Easy Tears"" EP, and This Mortal Coil had just done a bunch of excellent tracks (on its second album FILLIGREE AND SHADOW), 4AD's choice of tracks remains inexplicable.
LONELY IS AN EYESORE is certainly worth buying if you're a dedicated 4AD collector, but for the casual fan of 4AD bands or 23 Envelope's design, it can be infuriatingly disappointing.",1004659200,5,1994,4.850439882697947
1184660,5,B000005JS7,"This is one of those videos I made the tragic mistake of loaning to a friend (correction: ""ex-friend"") oh-so-many years ago.  I would love to see someone release this on DVD.  ""Fish"" (Throwing Muses)  and ""Crushed"" (Cocteau Twins) are standouts, but the entire video  is breathtaking.",955238400,6,284,5.108695652173913
7903389,4,B000005JS7,"It's surprising how many reviews here are for the companion CD, and not the item described (the VHS tape).  I don't know if this is Amazon's screw up or people just don't read.  There's a separate listing for the album where most of these reviews should go.

As far as the videos are concerned, file this more under historical document rather than essential viewing.  Although I still love the ambiance many of them have (especially the This Mortal Coil and DCD entries) it's true much of it definitely shows it's age.  Still, a good collection of material that (at that time) was not available on their albums, and these were very low budget videos that captured the 4AD mood.",1204675200,,677,4.65546218487395
