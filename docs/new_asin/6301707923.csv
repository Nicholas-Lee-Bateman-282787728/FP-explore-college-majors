7814107,5,6301707923,I always loved Walt Disney's  A TIGER WALKS. I always liked Pamela Franklin and thought we would see more of her in Walt Disney films like this. These were times of great family oriented films that Walt Disney was producing. Sadly this was Sabu's last film.,1414800000,,257,4.586956521739131

7814109,5,6301707923,"THE PLOT: When a traveling circus drives through town, they lose a tiger due to an abusive animal handler. But another handler Ram Singh (Sabu, in his last film) knows the tiger and is determined to catch him before the locals kill him. Sheriff Williams (Brian Keith) and his wife (Vera Miles) try to keep things calm at home when their daughter (Pamela Franklin who had appeared 3 years earlier in ""The Horse Without a Head"") is fighting mad about attempts to kill the tiger instead of catching it. Adding to their problems, the Governor sends in the National Guard in a move to bolster his re-election campaign and uses the event to create hysteria. There are more dangers than tigers when the townsfolk and guardsmen are all tromping through the woods with loaded weapons and fog sets in. Meanwhile the sheriff's daughter helps start a national ""Save That Tiger"" campaign amongst school children. The sheriff may be able to handle the issue without bloodshed, but he is also facing a re-election that is struggling due to the maneuvers by the Governor and the clumsy work by the mob of reporters. The film has quite incidents of people exploiting others, enough to become a running theme of the show. This includes the hotel owner who increases her room rate 10 times the normal rate when it appears a mob of reporters and government officials are coming to town; or the local reporter who sensationalizes the story to get a big job outside the town, despite the sherrif's request to keep the story from creating panic; the Governor using the incident for his re-election; the host of a childrens show who uses the issue to build ratings; and so on. All in all, an exciting movie that points out that everyone has character flaws, but in the end we must do what is right.

BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: Walt Disney oversaw this project and he liked working with people he worked with before, who brought a familiar Disney face to his projects, but he also did it because he knew what to expect from them. This movie was no exception as half a dozen actors, the director, writer, composer, producer, art directors, set decorator, and most of the crew selected for this project had all worked on other Disney projects in the past or were full time studio employees. Directed by Norman Tokar, who also directed ""Big Red"", and ""The Happiest Millionaire"" for Disney. Tokar had a strong background in television, having previously written and directed on episodes from famous shows including Leave it to Beaver and the Donna Reed Show.

The fog effects The screenplay was adapted from the book by Ian Niall, by Lowell Hawley. He worked as a studio writer for Disney on episodes for the Zorro series, and later wrote screenplays for the ""Swiss Family Robinson"", and ""In Search of the Castaways"" movies.

Add to this Brian Keith Vera Miles, Edward Andrews and others and you can see that Walt kept hiring people that were good at their craft and dependable. The supporting cast for the movie was also full of familiar faces including Una Merkel, Kevin Corcoran, peter Brown, Ed Andrews, Frank McHugh, and others.
