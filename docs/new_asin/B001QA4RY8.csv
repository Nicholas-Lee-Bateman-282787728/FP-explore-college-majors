The story is unlike other vampire movies, with a mixture of romance, action and horror. The special effects in this movie are amazing. It will keep you interested on the edge of your seat. I don't think I ever have seen a movie with the ongoing good relationship between a vampire and a human that accept each other for the way they are. This movie is a must see.",1383004800,,578,6.148148148148148

8335278,5,B001QA4RY8,"I previously had the Target exclusives for Eclipse and Breaking Dawn Pt. 1 and searched for Twilight and New Moon in these lovely editions. They are so nice and very visually appealing. If you love Twilight and collect the items, I most definitely believe you should purchase this.",1354320000,,281,4.875
8335279,5,B001QA4RY8,"I was very pleased with the purchase of this product. I paid very little for so much. Although it was used, it contained everything that was suppose to come in the collection. Now my collector editions are complete (minus, Twilight Saga: BD2).<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-Collector-s-Edition-Gift-Set/dp/B001Z2S4P0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight (Collector's Edition Gift Set)</a>",1354060800,,435,7.8979591836734695
8335280,5,B001QA4RY8,"First I have to say I have not opened my DVD. I bought the special edition to watch. Then I found this and just had to have it. I kept my eye on it for a long time. I know that every Twilight dvd that was released came with some different stuff I think this one came with the most. I bought this one as a collectors item. One that I will never open and if someone opens mine ill have to hurt them type of deal lol. I love how beautiful the case is and its thicker then the other dvds. Since this one they have come out with New Moon, Eclipse, and now Breaking Dawn part one with similar cases so they all match. Each one comes with something special. From Pictures to prop flowers. Its something I will never open because I know someday it will no longer be out there to buy and the price is going to jack up and i know Ill be happy I kept mine in great condition.

So if your a true twilight fan. Buy this now. You never know when they will stop making it. Just think. The last movie is at the end of this year.",1333670400,8,1012,3.888888888888889
