8351540,4,B00260HER4,"As a fan of Extreme 4X4, and an avid Samurai owner, I was interersted in this build. Overall this is a good build video, but I wish it was a bit more detailed and longer. The modifications were basic for a hard-core build and didn't go as in depth as I would like, but it is good entertainment. It was heartbreaking to see them cut up such a nice tin-top, but still built a cool rig. The veggie conversion was a bit much, but otherwise a trick build.",1357430400,,450,4.125
8351541,4,B00260HER4,"My son and I enjoyed this video, despite DA host, he is irritating. Good info, neat build.  1 1/2 thumbs up.",1355616000,,108,4.142857142857143
8351542,3,B00260HER4,"Not what I was looking for. Not much left of the original car. They replaced everything, not a budget project.",1306800000,,110,4.55
8351543,4,B00260HER4,Bought this dvd because I missed the episode... not all that informative but good to watch every now and again to pump one up for their zuk build. Amazon had it to my door in only a few days... very impressed!,1304121600,,209,4.121951219512195
