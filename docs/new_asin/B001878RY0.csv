3412009,5,B001878RY0,"Just arrived in the mail today all the way from the U.S. and have watched both dvd's already. I'm still only a beginner but am searching for as much info as possible, and like another reviewer says, it's like you are right there with Tony, what i really like is the location he made this dvd, instead of going to the Rockies or Grand Canyon, or some place like that, where they're the only place like that in the world, he chose the Smokeys. I'm from Australia which has plenty of places you can find that might be simular to Smokeys, with nice mountains, running rivers with rocks and moss on them, forests with nice old buildings, parks with picnic tables and nice trees,  and he shows how you can take nice photo's anywhere..  One of the things I found most interesting though was the second dvd where Tony goes through alot of his photo's when he was beginning, and tells what he did wrong and what he would change now.. and then also goes through some other great photo's on his pc and explains about each..  I could have sat there all day watching this.. He also shows his whole kit, with lenses, filters and different camera's he uses.. I found the whole dvd very entertaining and helpful, and highly recommend it to anyone, beginners or professional..",1233360000,7,1259,4.5131578947368425
3412010,5,B001878RY0,"Although some of the presentation was a bit advanced for my current level, it was well presented and done with humour and professionalism. It challenged me to study and , above all, practice. I'm taking a Rocky Mountain workshop this Fall and have joined a local camera club as advised by Mr. Sweet. This is highly recommended.

3412011,5,B001878RY0,"I found these DVDs to be outstanding.  I have watched both discs three times in the two months I have owned them.  He doesn't do any remedial teaching; it assumes you have more than a surface understanding of exposure, metering, light; if you do not you will likely be frustrated and not rate the DVDs very highly.  I have seen a number of DVDs and sat in workshops and Tony is a natural teacher.  He doesn't take himself too seriously and isn't one of these prima donna photographers ; he is very down to earth and just wants to take great photographs.  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD.",1228694400,6,583,4.411214953271028
3412012,4,B001878RY0,"I bought this video looking for some help on photography. I am a beginner and was looking for some help. The video was pretty cool if you are looking for something that is similar to a nature show. He shows his work throughout this video while he is taking the photos. He picked some breathtaking photos. Alot of what he was doing just depended on what kind of picture he was looking to take. he takes some breathtaking photos and he is very creative. So the video shows some tips you can get off of him. However, I own a canon and he was using a Nikkon. It made me want to kick myself for getting a canon because I don't know if my canon DSLR can do what his Nikkon can. So the video doesn't necessarily teach you how to use a camera it just gives you some tips. This one was a two disc as well. so it is very long and drawn out.",1227916800,2,830,4.006024096385542
3412013,5,B001878RY0,I have reviewed literally dozens of photography videos and surprisingly most of them have very poor video quality. But this title finally has video quality to match the quality of the photography. The on location feel is fantastic. It combines great advice with the feeling that you are on a real photography excursion. It is shot in the Smokey Mountains but the topics apply to all outdoor photography.  The in studio sections are equally well done. This is the best of the videos out there and I hope Tony does some more. His books are also a great companion to the video.,1225584000,4,574,4.627450980392157
3412014,4,B001878RY0,"Fun video, sweet's an interesting guy... I'm sort of an intermediate photographer and I learned a few things from this video.  I very much like the fomat, kinda like hanging out with a ""friend,"" taking photos!

If you're an advanced photographer, you would probably still enjoy the video but maybe not learn too much.  I certainly recommend it, and would buy a volume two if they come out with one.",1220140800,6,398,4.6571428571428575
3412015,5,B001878RY0,"As I am watching this DVD set from Tony Sweet I'm wondering why everyone who ever wanted to teach anything didn't do it this way.  Maybe it's because not only does Tony have a prodigious gift as an artist but a unique ability to communicate how he does it and an infectious enthusiasm that is palpable.  On this DVD he covers a full range of topics from the most esoteric and technical (his knowledge of lenses, filters, tools and techniques is encyclopedic) to the most mundane (be careful walking on the wet rocks because you can get hurt) or (just because it's not raining doesn't mean water won't drip on your filters from the overhanging trees).  Tony is a seasoned professional who is a combination of artist, photographic business man and Renaissance man and philosopher.  If you want to know how a brilliant artist thinks and how to bring the results home, this is a video you should study.  The videography is also beautifully done and consistently enhances the experience.  I've never seen anything quite like this and really do wish there was a similar product for everything I'd like to learn.",1220054400,11,1105,4.729166666666667
3412016,5,B001878RY0,"Very much enjoyed this workshop video presented by Tony.  There are two facets he cover; 'in the field' and 'in the studio.'  Set in the Great Smoky Mountains, Tony takes us to a number of scenic venues and explores possibilities from shooting fog, river streams, flowers, and much more.  His style of fine art photography should be enjoyed by all photographers.  Additionally, he shows the use of lens filters (provided by Singh-Ray) as well as some experiments with Lensbabies.

The 'in the studio' portion of the DVD, Tony takes us into his studio for some great macro shots with flowers, discusses his personal portfolio, post-editing workflow (with Photoshop), and the gear he uses (Nikon camera's and lenses).  One great tip he talks about is how to break into the stock photography market and the importance of the Photographers Market Guide (well worth purchasing this book) as it contains hundreds of book publishers, etc. looking for photographs.

I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and look forward to purchasing some filters and practicing the techniques Tony discusses.  Highly recommended for the beginner to advanced level enthusiast.",1260144000,,1158,5.221621621621622
3412017,5,B001878RY0,"I loved this set of Videos... i put them on my iPhone and watched them all about 3 times each !  My favorites where walking along and looking over Tony's shoulder while on a photography trip to Great Smoky Mts.  Seeing how another photographer works is always valuable, but to see how hard and how fast Tony works every location for images was inspiring !",1259798400,,355,4.446153846153846
3412018,5,B001878RY0,"I went to see Tony at a viewing af his work and really enjoyed his talk. So I searched out his dvds to purchase and found this one to be one for me. I watched it upon arrival over several evenings and was enlightened about many things I have heard talked about. The first time out photographing since watching it, I applied a technique he showed and was amazed how successful my photographs came out. I highly recommend this dvd if you can't attend a workshop.",1259280000,,460,4.3604651162790695
3412019,5,B001878RY0,"In the first DVD you join Tony on a photo hike. If you are an inexperienced landscape photographer with a desire to be shown how to pick motives and choose lenses I guess this could be instructive. To appreciate what he is doing you will need to know the basics of your camera and have a basic understanding of exposure compensation and choice of aperture.  Given that, Tony will take you along on a two hour photo hike in the Smokey Mountains showing you how he works and chooses motives. I did learn about variable density ND filters and to use a 10 magenta filter to enhance the look of fog, but if you are a fairly seasoned landscape photographer most of this is plain boring.

On the second DVD Tony starts with a presentation and discussion of an early and a recent portfolio of his images which I found a bit interesting.  On the next track Tony shows how he creates images of flowers in his studio where I picked up a few tricks. Shooting through a piece of structured window glass was neat. The rest is about equipment and a bit on workflow. I would think that the tracks on workflow are to brief to be very illuminating for the uninitiated and for the more experienced photographer there is nothing to learn.

I guess it is unfair to rate this product from the point of view of an experienced photographer who will likely find most of this a waste of time. I think the product may work well for the inexperienced landscape photographer that would like to follow an experienced photographer on a hike before going out and try to create images on his own.",1258848000,,1563,4.435540069686411
3412020,5,B001878RY0,"Tony is a true master of his craft and watching him in this video his passion for teaching photography is obvious. I have long wanted to attend one of his many workshops he does, but due to my location and money I have never had the opportunity to do so. This video is the next best things as he you get to see how he goes about his shots while listening to him tell you why he chooses to take a shot this way or with a certain lens over another.

He also goes into his equipment. Many books and help guides do this, but Tony does so in a way that you don't feel like he is endorsing anything specific. He uses Nikon, but as a Canon user I felt I could get very nice shots with what I have now and ideas for pieces I might want to get later as funds allow.

The first part of disk 2 Tony shows us some of his earlier photos and the thought process behind them. His critique of them are invaluable and well worth the price of the DVD alone. It's great to see someone you look up to in a field point out flaws they did. It's like ""Wow, he's made the same mistakes as me. I have hope after all!"" lol. Of course he also shows some of his newer stuff which is just breathtaking.

Anyone looking for a DVD to help improve their nature photography cannot go wrong with this purchase. I will defiantly be buying some more from this collection by Master Photo Workshops.",1257292800,,1361,4.07089552238806
3412021,3,B001878RY0,"The first DVD shows Tony trudging around the Smoky mountains and taking pictures. He described the shootings sporadically, as pro photographers would speak to advanced students. Some shootings were described better than others. How he managed lighting to deal with shadows and to enhance textures was instructive. I learned that #10 Magenta filter can be used to give a bit of life to fog, and the variable ND filter made by Singh-Ray can close down the light all the way to 8 stops, and is a great tool for taking blurry flowing water pictures.

I liked the first part of his second DVD much better. In this section, Tony analyzed some of his successful pictures. He made quite useful comments about mistakes in composition, lighting and editing. That is visual literacy proper. It was also interesting to watch him describe his equipment collection.

This DVD set is meant for somewhat advanced students of photography (which I am), but it does not do very well in addressing the usual questions of this group of photographers. So I give three stars.",1253318400,11,1052,4.871508379888268
3412022,2,B001878RY0,"I live in the UK and I enjoyed watching this video, as there are some fairly good tidbits of info in there, that is if you are advanced enough in the use of photographic jargon, to understand what he is talking about. And, unless you mainly want to shoot waterfalls with eight second exposures, using $400 filters (only available in the US, so add import duties as well for everyone else). Or how to make blurry green and white abstracts using a lens baby combined with a filter that you cannot buy(?) he had one hand made just for him. Then this DVD is of little use to you.

As you would expect, Tony being one of the people at the top of the commercial photography pile, he has access to more lenses, kit, filters and gadgets etc, than your average photog could ever dream of being able to afford, including a second high spec camera converted to infrared use only, with which he took about three images.

But if you are that advanced photographer with a large wad of spare cash burning a hole in you pocket, then this video is just right for you (although if you are, I suspect you would already have all this kit), but for the rest of us mere mortals, I would not recommend it for anything other than aspirational purposes.

UPDATE: Well, I took the plunge and bought the filters, had them shipped over to the UK and took the very large and painful hit in the groin for the import duties ($160 I think it was - thank you Gordon!). Took some shots (so so), then some more (mmm, not too bad) until finally, what do you know, I am making some really quite stunning images. Watched the video several times more and even contacted Tony directly (who was more than happy to chat with me via email - which was very nice of him and he even liked some of the images I sent him - so not too shabby...).

So with what I have learnt from the DVD and the lift it has given my photography, I am going to happily upgrade my 2 star rating to 4 stars. I still cannot give it 5 stars, as I still think the average amateur photographer is not going to be able to afford this kit, and without it the DVD is not going to be much help to them. But if you can afford it and you are obsessed with all things photographic, then I would advise you to dig deep and buy it. But if you are on a really tight shoe string budget, then I could not give the same recommendation.

Tony has a new DVD out called ""Visual Artistry"" which of course I will buy and which I imagine will severely hurt my pocket once again, but then I remember some advice I once overheard someone say in a book shop, when looking at buying a very expensive book on how to become a Buddhist, he looked at the book in one hand and the money in his other hand, as he weighed up what he should do ""what the heck, you only live once!"" he said to himself as he headed off to the till to buy it.",1248998400,13,2836,4.130434782608695
3412023,5,B001878RY0,"This is a very inspirational DVD. It is fun and a bit of a tutorial as well; it is a lot of fun to watch Tony Sweet set up his Nikons and go at it - even though I am a Canon shooter it was great nevertheless. I would consider my self as a advanced amateur photographer; I was able to pick up a few techniques from this DVD as well as some more gear. If you enjoy photography as much as I do I am sure you'll have a great time, very nice, professional and again fun. 5 stars hands down!",1248480000,,485,3.764705882352941
3412024,5,B001878RY0,"I've always been a fan of Tony Sweet - he's got a unique eye and creative style that help to improve my creativity.

Tony Sweet's Visual Literacy is an intimate look in the field with Tony to learn how one of Nikon's Legends approaches a variety of opportunities.

This is a two DVD set.  The first DVD takes the viewer along with Tony for a multi-day shoot in the Smokies in the Spring of 2008.  Tony visits Cades Cove, Roaring Fork, Greenbrier, Tremont, and Clingman's Dome to create images at some of the prime locations in the park.  Having been to the Smokies many times, these locations were very familiar.  But it was interesting to see how Tony worked the locations and the lighting.

Here's an example of how the DVD flows.  At the Ogle cabin in Roaring Fork, Tony goes to a familiar composition and talks you through his thought process for composition.  Tony creates multiple compositions to work the site with everything from long lenses to close ups and IR and talks you through everything he is doing and why.

The second DVD takes the viewer into the studio to explore a variety of close up and macro techniques for florals.  Then the DVD covers the editing process, the commercial side of professional photography, and the gear Tony uses in the field and the studio for photographs, editing and printing.  I found the section about photographing flowers in the studio a little slow, but worth it to pick up important nuggets.

Each DVD has extra features that are worth a look.  The Extra feature of the first DVD puts you in the car with Tony while he scouts locations in Cades Cove.  Buckle your seat belt!

This is certainly one of the better purchases I've made.  I own several of Tony's books, and have spent a great deal of time in the Smokies at these locations.  But there is something about seeing these locations and the thought process of a great photographer at work.  What's more - Tony is just a nice guy - intense about his craft but genuinely interested in helping those who view this DVD set.",1242950400,13,2025,4.5595567867036015
3412025,5,B001878RY0,This is a very helpful DVD for Tony Sweet's fans. He discusses how he shoot his amazing pictures. In DVD 1 he discusses how he takes pictures in the field and in DVD 2 He discusses about his pictures in studio. Both of them is full of valuable informations. I recommand the DVD for those who likes Tony Sweet's pictures.,1234569600,,320,4.35
8268628,3,B001878RY0,"There are 2 CDs in this set:  one is brilliant, one is boring.  Tony is much more insightful reviewing his work, rather than talking as he shoots.",1465171200,,146,4.37037037037037
8268629,5,B001878RY0,Very informative and interesting.,1431302400,,33,7.5
8268630,5,B001878RY0,"I would definitely recommend this DVD, it was so informative, I do think anything Tony Sweet does is going to be good.
Tony is a natural born teacher and his creative eye is amazing.  His style of photography is so inspiring.",1388534400,,225,4.487804878048781
8268631,1,B001878RY0,"Although I'm sure Tony Sweet is very knowledgeable, he is a terrible communicator. He did not explain what he was doing or why. And even if he did, I wouldn't have understood him, since he mumbled everything. I would not recommend this video.",1339372800,2,242,4.651162790697675
8268632,5,B001878RY0,"Tony Sweet hit the ball out of the park with this DVD! I have viewed it several times and learned quite a bit from it. Tony explains his technique and gives you a taste of what on location shooting is about. The key thing is to remain flexible with your schedule. Have a plan, but remain ready to change the plan when conditions warrant it!",1314662400,,340,4.246153846153846
8268633,5,B001878RY0,"There is no doubt he's a salesperson for Nikon, but who cares.  Watch it the first time and just enjoy the beauty of the Smokies!  The next time watch to learn!  Great instructions.  If you are just starting in photography the ""language"" will sound strange, but a great learning video,",1313107200,,285,4.64
8268634,2,B001878RY0,"I was extremely disappointed in this video! As a moderate photographer I was looking for a video that could help develop my ability to capture impressive landscapes, but this video left me feeling ripped off. There is some useful content in the video sure, but not $40's worth. The first video is watching Tony take pictures, with minimal explanation of what he is doing. This video would have been much more valuable if he explained why he was doing what he was doing! If you already know that a tripod and small aperture are needed for crisp landscape shots, and that you can use a neutral density filter to give water a smooth flow then don't waste your money. The over all feeling is that you are walking around following a guy taking pictures and you don't participate at all! He discusses about metering but never shows you what he is using in the frame to meter, he talks about how great of a shot he is seeing, but the viewer only sees Tony looking into his camera, and lastly he quickly shows you the picture he took but doesn't talk about what the F-stop or aperture setting was. If this is what you are looking for I am sure a local photographer will let you carry his stuff around all day and give you the same amount of hints for free! The second video is him showing you his tens of thousands of $$ in high end glass and about is fully furnished studio. This has no real use because if you can afford a $7000 printer, and a $8000 computer set up, then you wouldn't be looking at this video you would be taking private lessons. The last hour or so of the video is Tony showing you his portfolio, where he basically tells you what he might have done different on each shot. It's a long dry 4 hours that could have been condensed to 30 mins of useful information.",1289347200,8,1774,4.33033033033033
8268635,5,B001878RY0,"Fantastic Video.  Loaned it to several friends and they loved it so much that they still have it, so recommend it highly. Tony is a great teacher.  A lot of information and worth the money...buy it as a gift for your many photographer friends..you won't be disappointed...",1279584000,,272,4.76595744680851
8268636,2,B001878RY0,"This was a big disappointment for me as a beginner.  He was shown rushing around doing his craft, but never gave the details of what it is about!!  He used slang and professional jargon which left me totally lost.  This was a waste of my money as an amateur.",1264204800,7,258,4.224489795918367
8268637,5,B001878RY0,"Tony Sweet's Visual Literacy: Photography Workshop DVD is a very informative work. The package comes with two DVDs. One DVD take you on Photo shoots in the Smokey Mountain area. The 2nd DVD takes you through the post processing process using Photoshop and plug-ins. The photo shoots are good and informative, providing the viewer with an insight to Tony's approach to capturing the impressions of the moment. He uses Nikon equipment but his approach applies to any equipment that you may have. He demonstrates the practical use of ""bracketing"", and other visualization techniques to make the shot and planning the posting processing process. He demonstrates how he takes a somewhat boring subject of an uninhabited home and made it interesting and turned it into a great shoot.

DVD 2 provides many techniques to add ""zip"", ""pizzazz"" and ""pop"" into the shots. His also has a ""show & tell"" shows all of the equipment he owns. I found very informative and enlightening. The presentation is this very detailed and informative. This is an excellent companion to his other DVD-Visual Artistry.

You will enjoy these informative DVD presentations and worth the cost.",1263168000,2,1160,5.1
