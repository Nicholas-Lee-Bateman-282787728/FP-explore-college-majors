8005409,2,B00011V82W,"This is a collection of 3 stories - the first one is so shallow and the characters so vapid that it almost discourages you right then and there from watching any of the rest. The 2nd story unfortunately does little to revive your interest, its only slightly better than the first in that you do feel something for the bufoonish chracters and do get a feel for the atmosphere of life in a working-class Tel Aviv neighborhood. But the 3rd story more than makes up for the first two - its funny and engaging and suspensful all at once. If you get this movie just skip past the first 2 parts.",1303948800,,588,4.306306306306307
