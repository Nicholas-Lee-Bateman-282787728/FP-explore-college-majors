7816036,5,6301816099,"Reminds me very much of Ken Russell's ""The Devils"", substituting love and lust for bloodshed and torture. Popp and Prey are in top form and orchestra & chorus are magnificent. Can't judge the playability or absolute picture quality because I dl'd this (in 5 parts) off You-Tube. Not a literal view of the work, sometimes the cast sings along with the music but frequently they don't. But unlike a lot of video portrayals of classic pieces (Britten's ""War Requiem"" comes to mind) it doesn't hammer the music's point home but underlines and enhances it. It's become my Official ""Carmina"" over my other recordings (Ozawa, Shaw, Chailly) even when I only listen.",1353974400,,658,4.936936936936937
