We've had this DVD for a few years and both of my kids L-O-V-E it; it's great for all ages and it's fun to see how each kid reacts to different street scenes. It's also very calming background noise for a parent who just needs a few minutes to get dinner ready. I hope there are more of these DVDs in the works!!!",1176595200,,450,4.125

I loved the funky, original music, VERY NEW YORK, but to say that your child will enjoy this DVD is assuming that having a view of the world from the angle of someone's calves is fun.

Some of the more endearing scenes include youngsters enjoying the Central Park Zoo, the lake and the playground sprinkler's, dog walkers with all sorts of adorable canines, and the ever interesting mix of cultures which make this city indescribably infectious.

I wouldn't recommend this for toddlers, maybe at five or six your child will appreciate parts of it, but all in all I think they'll lose interest somewhere between the crane dumping dirt at a construction site and the zig-zag camera work of people's feet walking through the streets.  Enough to leave you cross-eyed!

By the way, the mom and son in this film are obviously living in luxury's lap because at the end they are greeted by a doorman who says ""Welcome Home..."" as they roll into a gold trimmed, ritzy lobby...not exactly how most typical New Yorkers are living!

That being said, however, for an out of towner looking for a short tour of New York City, this is nice gift to send along before or after they visit for the first time.",1120089600,,1396,4.608870967741935
8024036,5,B0002910RQ,"This DVD is a great virtual tour of New York City. We don't live too far from NYC and make trips there with the kids when we can. This video serves as a great souvenir and a way to see the sights without actually being in The City... I agree with the comment made by one of the reviewers that this is a great alternative to the Baby Einstein videos. Little Walks New York is great ""eye candy"" for kids and for parents alike; shot at the kid's point-of-view in the stroller in the summertime. The music is great too! Featured music includes jazz piano, classical, alternative rock and a great mix of other genres that are appropriate for a stroll through the park and in-and-around NYC. Highly recommended.",1106438400,,705,4.4728682170542635
8024037,5,B0002910RQ,"I went to visit my friend in Washington. She has a two year old daughter with a discerning video habit. I brought her this video (being from New York). We put it in the player and she was captivated. The images of New York against the wonderful mix of music was enchanting...(we found ourselves getting drawn in too!)
If you want your child to watch something fun and fascinating, without the music driving you crazy. This is the video. I'm going to give it to all my friends with kids!!",1088726400,,487,4.4222222222222225
8024038,5,B0002910RQ,"My 18 month old daughter loves this DVD!  It's not often that I can get her to sit still for 30 minutes, but when this is on, she doesn't move.  the other nice thing about this video is that it's also adult-friendly.  Great music, great footage, no annoying characters that sing.  A refreshing break from the usual children's video.  I highly recommend it.",1088640000,,356,4.587301587301587
