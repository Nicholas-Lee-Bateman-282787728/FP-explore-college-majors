8733250,2,B015DG7WPQ,"I like the show, but am disappointed and confused by this release. This has 7 of the 8 episodes of the short second season, and is missing the first episode of the season, Swans. Not sure why this could possibly be. Why not release all 8 episodes? Apparently Swans did not air in the US, so it is missing from this package. Silly. The DVD releases for this series are very confusing as there is a complete Season 1 release, and also a 2-part release of Season 1 in 2 separate packages. This is the 3rd in that series of releases, and instead of being all of Season 2 is incomplete. Perhaps they thought the season would have more episodes and were saving the 8th (actually 1st) for the second package? Silly and annoying. Now my collection will forever be incomplete.",1456617600,2,767,4.446808510638298
