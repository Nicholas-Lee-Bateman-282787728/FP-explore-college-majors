8412979,2,B0041KW4UE,"Although the movie is pretty good with a great cast, I'd suggest steering clear of this particular edition unless you absolutely need a Italian language version.  For some odd reason, this edition is bowlderized and removes little snippets of the racier bits of several scenes.  The OAR is also altered from 2.35:1 to 1.85:1 (cropping the sides of the frame.)  The disc offers a 5.1 Italian soundtrack but only a 2 channel English track and absolutely no extras at all.",1414713600,,469,4.8375
