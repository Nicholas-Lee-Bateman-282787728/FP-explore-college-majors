8087259,3,B000BITVGA,"I've gotten several of these ""Real Girls Uncovered"" DVDs lately and have enjoyed them quite much. This ""Party Girls of the USA 1"" is a fun one. It actually is films from 5 different places - 2004 Indy 500 Street Action, 2003 Amtrak Mooning, Pudding Wrestling, 2003 Kentucky Derby, and San Diego Over-the-Line Contest.  Each film runs about 10-15 minutes, and the total run time of the DVD is a generous 67 minutes (most DVDs like this run 55 to 60 minutes).

Most segments are of women, mostly in their 20s and 30s, flashing their breasts and buns to the assembled crowd.  Most of them are very nice looking, but occasionally anyone is shown whether good-looking or not.  Several ladies are real standouts. There's a slight bit of total nudity on here, since this is mostly toplessness, but if you're a breast aficionado like I am you'll surely find this fun to see. Many shots too are of women in bikinis. Even on the Amtrak Mooning film, where men and women are mooning trains as they pass by, there's still a lot of women flashing their chests to the camera.

The picture quality is pretty decent, not super sharp but OK. It's all at a 1.33:1 image ratio, and it appears that these are amateur filmings, but still they're all very watchable. The segments filmed in crowds have the problem of people getting in the way, but not too badly. Still, because of such conditions I dropped this from 4 stars to 3. There also is a similar volume 2 of this and it's also titillating.",1396742400,,1476,4.533834586466165
