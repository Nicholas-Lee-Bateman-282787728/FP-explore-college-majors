256547,5,6300216950,"Storyville, New Orleans. 1917. Brooke Shields(Violet) is the daughter of prostitute Susan Sarandon(Haddy). The camera follows Violet around and shows the goings on within the New Orleans style brothel mansion through her eyes. She is a surprisingly strong central character and the brothel provides a fairly stable family environment which sometimes seems more like a boarding school than a bawdy house. The old Madam looks out for her girls and the girls look out for each other. Shields is friends with both the colored Jazz pianist, the voodoo fortune teller, the worldly photographer as well the other little kids. Her childhood seems charmed, rich.
Louis Malle in his earlier classic Murmur of the Heart examined bourgeois norms and found them to be far from moral, and in this movie he is examing what most deem an amoral atmosphere and finding much there that is admirable.  He is celebrating moral freedom within the rich and racially diverse culture of New Orleans and he is examining moral hypocrisy as all the patrons are the wealthy and ""respectable"". Malle sets up an equation that perhaps parodies the age old artist/patron relationship. The most obvious arts being patronised are the sensual arts but also  the mansion is a social club with its own jazz pianist, paintings on the wall, and there is a general joie de vivre that is lacking in the normal world. The brothel is seen as a kind of timeless sanctuary of the better things in life. Birth and death are kept out of the main parlor to preserve this illusion. At the end as this world that Malle and Nykvist have so carefully put together comes apart the mood is one of regret that it can't keep going on. This is not a message film and Malle is a director who does not insist you see things any particular way. Certainly the young Brooke Shields appearing as she does is meant to shock and no one thinks  little girls should grow up to be prostitutes but the other extreme of growing up in the narrow confines of puritanical mainstream America also has its limits. The former world is amoral but it is lively and awakens the imagination and senses, the latter world is moral but overly protective and stultifying.
Malle leaves things unresolved and the photographer played by Kieth Carradine embodies the ambivalence best of all.  Carradine is attracted to the prostitutes existence, and he seems at home with them(much in the same way an artist in the same period found himself at home in Paris)but he keeps his distance for awhile, treating them only as art objects. Once he steps over his own bounds though he becomes as morally questionable as the prostitutes themselves. At the end he is still divided as to what is the best life for young Violet.  So among everything else in the movie you have this little allegory of the bohemian artist as well.  Music throughout is by piano professor Jellyroll Morton who is thanked in a note at the end of the picture. Malle is a director who never made a bad picture, and never made an ordinary one as well. One of my all time favorite directors. Also recommended by Malle: Murmur of the Heart, Atlantic City, My Dinner w/Andre, Crackers, May Fools, Damage, Vanya on 42nd Street.",1017532800,78,3197,4.741007194244604

256549,5,6300216950,"Brooke Shields is as gorgeous as a little girl can be.  Her beauty really rivets you to the screen.  Louis Malle keeps the camera on her as often and for as long as possible, reminding me that some years ago Brooke Shields was the most photographed model in the world.  Susan Sarandon gets considerably upstaged.  However as far as acting goes, Brooke ranged from amateurish to competent to flashes of delight.  She was good, so good I would say in comparing her to later roles, that she has regressed.  But perhaps it was Louis Malle's direction that made her seem so natural.

Sarandon was flawless and seamless as usual (and never looked better).  The long takes on the faces of the characters was noticeable but short of annoying.  The sets were almost magical.  They seemed so natural without all the usual, ""Look folks, this is 1917!"" kind of feeling you usually get with period piece photography.  The milieu of the whore house in New Orleans in which little Violet wanders about in every room and every nook and at any time, day or night, seems natural and unforced.  It's a huge child's playground in effect for the twelve-year-old who yearns to out-do mommie in being desirable to the johns.

The story line is strangely reserved.  You keep expecting some real horror to explode in your face, and then you expect a heart sickening tragedy, Violet to be mutilated by one of her johns or perhaps exploited by some sick man, but the worst she gets is deflowered and slapped.  The madame of the house (played brilliantly by an actress whose name I don't know) has her whipped for something, but she skips away from that saying it didn't hurt and runs off to the photographer she likes, played perhaps too Victorianly by Keith Carradine.  I got the feeling he couldn't make up his mind whether he was Toulouse Lautrec, Vincent Van Gogh or Professor Henry Higgins and decided to go with all three.  I expected to see him grovel a little for Brooke, or debase himself  la Philip in Of Human Bondage, but Malle spares us that.

The defining sequence in the movie, and the part that reveals the real tragedy of the little girl is when she goes to the photographer's house and they begin living together and he leaves her a note that she can't read (because she is illiterate) and we see her standing behind his iron fence watching the sailors walk by (perhaps the sailors are in her future).  When he comes home and we see that her child's view of the world is so different than his, we know their relationship is doomed.  But we also know that she has lost her childhood and will never have a normal adolescence.  That is her tragedy.

The cinematography is beautiful without calling undue attention to itself.  The whore house seems real enough as a sort of French salon cum New Orleans brothel, cum Dodge City saloon. We see Brooke as close to naked as perhaps we would want.  The point of the photography is to show her physical beauty, but in a naturalistic, almost nonsexual way, to show the awkwardness of the child who is about to become a woman.  She never looks worse than when she's painted up and thick with lipstick.  We get the point.  In the scene where she is deflowered we are ""threatened"" with horror (she screams, the john sneaks out and they discover her motionless on the bed).  But she's only joking and they all get choked up at this ""rite of passage.""  Malle makes it like a first kiss, which for her (his point) it is.

He gets to tell it like it is sometimes with young girls and men but spares us a lot of the shock by making it clear that Brooke Shields as Violet the 12-year-old prostitute is an exception to the general rule.  Yet nothing is hid from us.  The slavery of the prostitute's life and bondage to her trade is made clear.  The tragedy of growing up in a whore house is not glossed over; it's just that the tragedy is sugar coated like our memories of childhood, and indeed the little girl has a lot of fun in the old whore house and we know that some of her memories will be fond ones.

Finally, Violet's mother comes back for her.  She has made a successful marriage with her rich respectable husband.  Violet goes to her and although her photographer husband objects, he knows it's inevitable: he must lose her.  She asks ""Can't you come too?""  We, along with Keith Carradine, get to fathom that for a long moment or two before he lets her go.  The great thing about this scene is that the arrival of the mother and her rich husband just destroys their ""marriage.""  Kaboom.  We immediately see that the child's higher loyalty and greater love is to and for the mother and not her husband and her marriage, a relationship she does not understand.

It's a strange tale, bravely told with a touch of gentle genius.  I'm glad I didn't have to see all the warts, but I know they were there behind the gloss and Malle left them out on purpose: and the nearly idyllic world of the child prostitute is nothing like his fairy tale, but I thank him for it anyway; after all, these things have to be told in the form of fairy tales or myths otherwise we can't accept them.

256550,4,6300216950,"The cinematography, acting, & artwork were second to none. Keith Carradine, Susan Sarandon, & Brooke Shields did an excellentjob portraying the other side of society that most of us do not deal with or even want to deal with.  The forced sexualization of a 12 year old girl is, perhaps, a strong subject to tackle in a film.  Not only is this girl sexually active, but, she is also a prostitute.  Life is full of hardships for most people; however, it can be harder on a select few than most.  That is what happens to Violet (Brooke), she is forced to interact on an adult level in an adult world never quite having a childhood. This movie left me feeling sad & overwhelmed.  I wanted to change Violet's life for her, make it happy...somewhat normal.  If you are looking for a movie that has a happy ending, look elsewhere.  If you want an accurate portrayel on the hardships of growing up a young, beautiful girl in a prostitutes world, this is the movie for you.  The message is hard & is not for those that are easily offended.  I can see where this would be more popular in Europe than here given the subject matter. To sum it up: Brooke is (as usual) beautiful & stunning.  The nudity did not bother me as much as the subject matter did, but, only to the extent that you wish her character would have the chance to enjoy the innocence that is so beautiful in children.  I do recommend this to those that can see past the images displayed on the screen & can engrosse themselves in the story.  NOTE: This movie is not for everyone, hence my 4 star rating.",955411200,98,1559,4.375

256770,5,6300216950,"Louis Malle is a curiously unsung French director whose misfortune it was to fall between two stools. His films are neither as obviously dynamic/trail-blazing as those of Godard & co nor as obviously imposing as Robert Bresson and Jean-Pierre Melville, the two great antecedents of the French New Wave. Initially it seemed Malle was set to fit in quite well with the revolutionary zeitgeist. He won an Oscar co-directing the documentary The Silent World (Le Monde du silence) with Jacques Cousteau in 1956 at the age of 24. The same year he assisted Robert Bresson on A Man Escaped (Un Condamn  mort sest chapp), a film now commonly acknowledged as one of the greatest ever made. On paper at least the first French phase of his solo-director career running from Elevator to the Gallows (Ascenseur pour lchafaud, 1957) through to Black Moon (1975) was successful, his films picking up attention at Cannes and Venice, especially The Lovers (Les Amants, 1958) and Le Feu follet (1963). However, the international spotlight seized by the Cahiers du Cinma crowd took peoples attention away from Malles work which seemed dull, old fashioned and out of step with the times, especially with his liking of romanticism and his side-stepping of self-reflexivity. At a time when the fashion was to make films which criticized other films in essence relating on screen what was being written in the pages of Cahiers du Cinma, Malle continued making films in the traditional old way. Time is the great changer of perceptions. Looking back at 60s French films it is remarkable how much of what once seemed fresh and revelatory (especially Godards work) now looks dated with the quieter more conservative (more traditional) films especially of Eric Rohmer and Malle standing the test of time much better than the work of their angrier peers. Indeed in terms of longevity and a high level of consistency it may be argued they are the greatest French directors since Bresson and Melville even if the iconoclastic Nouvelle Vague modernism cant be totally ignored. Formally, Godards influence is pervasive everywhere of course, his films changing a generation of filmmakers, but none of his films really address the human condition (they are too busy addressing the film medium itself) with quite the same depth as these four.

In Pretty Baby (1978) Malle addresses the very meaning of Art no less, a human activity which enshrines the basic instinct for harmony, balance and rhythm as understood by Aristotle. In essence the film amounts to a study of beauty (the very definition of aesthetics) and its relationship with sexual desire. As is so often the case in painting, sculpture and photography, the object of beauty here is the female form, in this case the denizens of a brothel and in particular, the nubile body of 12-year old Violet (played by Brooke Shields, also aged 12), the daughter of a whore named Hattie (Susan Sarandon) who is growing up in a brothel in Storyville, the red light district of New Orleans, c. 1917. The depiction of a milieu is more important to Malle than the story, any melodrama as such being almost completed eschewed. Violet spends the time watching the ladies of the house go about their business, the whores servicing their clients, the black servants running the house, and the coke-sniffing absinth-addicted Madame Nell (Frances Faye) controling everything through an indolent fug. One day she decrees Violet old enough (12!) and her virginity is auctioned off for $400. Hattie deserts her daughter to take up with a customer in St. Louis. Once settled she returns to collect Violet only to find Violet has married a photographer named Bellocq (Keith Carradine) in the meantime. Malle stays with Violet throughout so that in the film we see the life of the brothel including the auction, Violet running away to Bellocq, Bellocqs marriage proposal, the wedding itself followed by a riverside picnic, and then Violet being reclaimed by her mother.

The film has been criticized for its lack of dramatic incident, but that misses the point for Malle devotes himself entirely to an objective capturing of the milieu of the brothel, the great old house which comes alive courtesy of Jelly Roll Mortons ragtime piano music and Sven Nykvists astonishing burnished camerawork rendering the intimacy of the ladies at work within it without lewd sensationalism and with much sensual atmosphere which clearly evokes French impressionism (especially Claude Renoir) and the work of Pierre Bonnard. Most important of all, attention is paid to rendering E. J. Bellocqs photographs on screen as accurately as possible. Bellocq was a real life photographer and in fact we understand this part of New Orleans history mostly through his work. Malle therefore makes him the central artist figure in his film who hangs around the brothel in the pursuit of beauty, taking pictures of the whores, especially Hattie and Violet. He eventually marries Violet ostensibly to protect her from the hostile world once Hattie deserts her and the brothel is facing closure, but also because he loves her. To what point this love is sexual is left wide open to debate. Earlier in the film we see Bellocq pointedly not touching the merchandise. He watches and photographs, but never has sex with the whores and he doesnt take part in the auction for Violets virginity either. Later when she is at his house he buys her a toy doll and we never see them either in bed or having sex. We see Violets nude body, but never when Bellocq is present. The relationship is portrayed as father-daughter until the films pivotal key concluding scene where he declares to Hattie who is attempting to take her daughter back, I cant live without her! The way he trembles, the way the camera stares at him it seems forever, his eyes  all speak volumes of his love for Violet. But is it a sexual love for her body, or is it a platonic love of beauty? Is it possible to separate the two? An artist, he has spent a lifetime capturing beauty on film, and now he actually has beauty living with him, he feels he cant live without it, whatever it may be.

Malle/Bellocqs pursuit of beauty here is similar to what Thomas Mann and Luchino Visconti give us in their meditations on beauty in Death in Venice, but without their Nietzschean Appoline/Dionysiac dialectic. Like Tadzio Violet is beauty incarnate but where Mann/Visconti give us very subjective views of beauty (most of the philosophizing of both novella and film is rendered as remembered by an aged Aschenbach), Malle goes to great lengths to objectify his beauty in Pretty Baby. Look carefully and we see there are no point of view shots other than those looking through a camera. There are three cameras, the most obvious of which being Bellocqs and when he sets up his shots we occasionally see the frame as he sees it through his camera. An obvious example is one by the river where Bellocq photographs the excited men swimming across the river towards his wedding party to chase after the ladies present. The second camera is the box brownie at the end belonging to Hatties husband. He photographs Violet standing with her back to the side of a train, the frame freezes and the end credits roll. Its as if until this point her world has been captured and presented as if photographed by Bellocq (a point underlined by Nykvists exquisite compositions), but from this point on her life will be captured by a totally different camera in St. Louis, by this new cameraman. The third camera of course belongs to Nykvist and he points it wherever Malle tells him to. The world we see  the brothel, the street, Bellocqs house, the river  are all observed dispassionately as we are distanced from the events as they play out. Note we learn nothing about the background of any of the characters. They are defined completely by the spaces they inhabit, by what we can see. It is like we are offered a whole new different world of beauty which we can spy at through Nykvist/Malles camera, but not empathize with at all. To observe this film is akin to looking at paintings on the wall wherein we the audience provide our own points of view according to how we interpret what we see  the subjectivity being entirely with us and not at all with Nykvist/Malle even if it is they who are directing exactly what we are looking at.

Malles objective portrayal of beauty (not only Violet, but all the ladies and the locales they inhabit) pays greatest dividends of all when the film turns to linking beauty with sexual desire. This is also Death in Venice territory of course especially with the shared theme of pedophilia, but where the desire there is no doubt homo-erotic at base, in Pretty Baby it is heterosexual. Morality was different in 1917, a time when child prostitution was fairly common in New Orleans even if it was already illegal. Malle presents Violet as a very wise 12 year old who is well versed in the ways of the world. In the first shot of the film we see her focused on something happening off screen, the sound of a woman panting and groaning. We momentarily think that she is watching a sex act (being educated) before the angle widens and we see its actually her mother giving birth to her brother. She wanders freely in the brothel, presumably observing the various ladies having sex and when she approaches her auctioning-off its played like a birthday with the girl seemingly not able to wait to be put into service. We watch all this distanced and dispassionate, reserving judgment while we swallow up the sheer beauty of the compositions.

The films focus on sexual desire pivots on two sequences  the auction and the final scene with Bellocq. In the first, Violet is paraded out on a platter as an after-dinner bon-bon and the bidding is treated very matter-of-factly, but one short shot (of the pianists look of disgust) is enough to tell us that what is happening is reprehensible. Other clients also express their disapproval. What seals this particular act of pedophilia as wrong is the rough way the auction winner treats his trophy. We see nothing, but Violets scream is followed by the clients embarrassed stumble down the stairs and out of the house. In the final scene with Bellocq sexual desire (if it IS sexual desire) is controversially portrayed with great ambiguity. Throughout the film, Bellocqs honor, his status as a moneyed gentleman has been stressed. He is by far the most sympathetic man we see and he is also morally superior to Hattie who stands by watching her 12 year old daughters virginity auctioned off before abandoning her while making her own selfish bed for freedom. She comes back for Violet not for a full three years (we know this by observing how the brother has grown). The new husband is an old client of Hatties and together, even though they say they have a house and can provide for Violet, there is nothing to suggest what they are offering is better than what Bellocq is already providing. The final scene is radically subversive according to the letter of the law and our intellectual grasp of common notions of decency for we should be applauding the (still under age) girls return to her mother coupled with the defeat of a pedophile. Instead we feel the opposite way, Malle placing his trust in the absolute reality of emotions over pre-determined ideas laid down in stone by society. As depicted, the girl doesnt want to go (she actually wants to take Bellocq with her) and Bellocq states he cant live without her. This is profoundly moving and sure indication of Malles skill at objectifying what we see, putting us at a distance so that he can sail into taboo territory unheard of in American film up until this point. Malle knows that sexual desire doesnt just appear when people are legally old enough. It is an unquantifiable impulse of the human heart which transcends age. It is only society and organized religion that comes along later to lay down laws which repress these desires, a repression which is sometimes more damaging than the expression of the desire itself. And at what age does a woman or a man become beautiful or sexually desirable? The law has its own black and white answers, but human nature is different and perhaps only in Art are we able to approach without hindrance the real ambiguities which lie behind beauty and sexual desire.

Pretty Baby is an outstanding achievement, subtle and subversive cinema at its very best. Reading the credits we discover that the film is very much a personal labour of love for Polly Platt who not only provides the story and the screenplay, but produces as well. I am unable to confirm how close to reality the portrait of E. J. Bellocq is. Little details seem to suggest great fidelity to fact like Violet scratching away a models face in one of his photographs. A great many of Bellocqs photos survive in similarly damaged condition and nobody seems to know who the censor was. It may have been one of his models or (more probably) the photographer himself. Other details are less factual. The kind of doll Violet is given didn't exist in 1917, and more seriously we just don't know if Bellocq actually did marry a child or if he was a pedophile at all. This doesnt really matter though, as Malles film quite transparently is a phenomenal achievement, capturing his subject with superb acuity. Performances across the board are excellent. This is the film that got Susan Sarandon noticed and Brooke Shields never went on to do anything better. Keith Carradine is superbly cast and puts in a performance worthy to lay beside his work for Alan Rudolph (Choose Me, Trouble in Mind, The Moderns, etc). Malle was at a bit of a creative impasse following Black Moon, and this taken together with his next two American films (Atlantic City and My Dinner with Andre [both 1981]) amounts to a full statement of his formidable powers. Bucking the usual trend, Louis Malle was the European art director who went to America and succeeded without selling out. He succeeded where so many others have failed.",1460332800,,14049,4.812836438923395

256807,2,6300216950,"There was some as it were anticipation with this films initial release. The release date was 1978 with the showing of this film being on HBO.I saw this film then with a particular statement I made then, returning to my memory. I had wondered aloud with my two sisters and mother sitting at the kitchen table. I had wondered why was this particular film  an interest at all. Why in fact was there a need to make such a film? Most certainly these were very marginal positions with even concerns being the concerns of perhaps lawmakers and health officials but as an interest of entertainment it was not. This was not entertainment as such but there is something more important than merely this perverse showing is concerned.
There is a unmistakable environment that is  dirty and unforgiving, it provides for those who inhabit such a world, a deathlike grip of vice and debauchery that ""Pretty Baby"" witnesses too. The particular community as a result of its ""storied"" past was ripe with crime,one patron may very well have been killed as a result of a hammer blow to the head. Nell,the Brothels Madam simply wanted to get rid of the body. This was not done as a form of entertainment but as a pleasure  derived from a form of cruelty. The conversation's  between the women of this House of Prostitution were of a Godless world that cursed the light of day very regularly. This is what you will discover that this is a community that practices voodoo,a form of witchcraft,  with the child ""Violet"" being painted in a ritual  associated with the practice of witchcraft. The Negro women who paints violet is in fact recognized as a witch. Nell is  potentially more dangerous  than merely a Madam. This women did drugs,cocaine was clearly evident with either a cocaine derivative ""heroin"" or perhaps it was ""hashish"" ,""opium""(a maleable dark colored tar like substance)  also being clearly visible and in use. Crime was a very real problem associated with storyville,la.
There was as well an increasing awareness of various diseases like Syphilus that had no cure.and as a result this particular environment flourished. Louisiana politicians had made trips to Amsterdam in an attempt to determine how best to deal with these problems. It was part of the underwriting as to this film though hardly do we know that..
""Pretty Baby"" is foremost a story that though sordid even unattractive is in fact too unfriendly. There is much to this pictures attempt to persuade through firstly suggestion. The story escalates in the detrimental environment that a child is being brought up in-from Child Abuse to Corrupting the morals of a minor to the suggestion of extreme cruelty ,being whipped. There are certainly other instances of objectionable material though not as it were in the nude. The attempt to rape the Negro Child by ""Violet"".The child in one regard is a thoughtless even mindless creature who has not the slightest care. This would in fact support the idea that this is indeed an individual who is not mature nor intelligent.""Violet"" does not have an education and as a result can not read a note that is left for her by the photographer. This is a personality of a spoiled  precocious child. There is further evidence that subject matter associated with Bestiality is indeed present. The child eats the same food and from the same dishes as the food that the cat eats from,and the child chases a salamander across a yard. This type of thought less conduct is symbolic and even ritualistic in nature. The subject of witchcraft will surface again as it concerns these even ritualistic interests. The character as to who ""violet"" actually is,is  merely that this particular performance was no more convincing than the character was in its portrayal. This is truly a politically charged world whereby this film was a cause that would of brought others into harms way,that is ""violet"" has had a bad effect. This is what this film is partly responsible for, providing society with an influence whereby youngsters are influenced by show offs and the hollywoods of the world only to wish to emulate those that do these things. It should be mentioned that ""violet"" is not the only child in this house of prostitution. There is a younger girl,younger than ""violet"" whose  mother is indeed a prostitute like ""Hattie"".
There are a number of instances where there is no doubt that the ladies are fully mature and all are as it were fully clothed. I do not see that as a particular concern however ""Hattie"" played by Susan Saranden has a photo shoot and as a result an attractive upper body session  only. These scenes though not full frontal nudity are in fact bare breasted with there being more than a single photo shoot.the breast feeding of""Hattie's"" child for example. The photo never went any place else as it concerns ""hattie"".Violet is something different. The particular scene in question is  most certain Child Pornographic.""Violet"" is nude on a couch and when locked out her backside is clearly in view.
I do not consider such an environment as storyville,la to be entertaining.i did not see it as entertainment when first viewed nor is this film any different today as it was then.",1442707200,,5181,4.83954802259887

256971,1,6300216950,"So there's this whole backstory to my reasons for watching this movie.  First off, Brooke Shields is exactly one day younger than I am.  Exactly one day.  Throughout our lives I've often been reminded of the lottery of birth.  Whenever my life gets really bad, I think, well it could always be worse, I could be Brooke Shields, 6ft tall, money up the whazoo and a terrible yet working actress.

When this movie came out, it was controversy all over the place, that's when I learned about our birthdays being one day apart.  I wanted to go see the movie, but being 13, my mother flatly denied access.  I thought it was crazy that I couldn't see a movie whose star was exactly my age.  Well, I didn't miss much.

The thing about this movie is, it has all the ingredients to be a good story but it can't put it together.  For the record, it's not Brooke Shields fault.  She couldn't act at age 13, but they knew it wouldn't matter for this film.  They used her for her looks and wanted to make a controversial film and there it is in a nutshell.  But it really could have been something.  A real examination of our sexuality and morality.  It was debated at the time, but I don't think it was properly debated.  The debate mainly centered around how Brooke Shields mom could let her do the movie.

The big issue is the subject matter but the bigger one was that Ms. Shields is shown naked in the film.  It really wasn't that big a deal in the movie but after I watched it, I recalled that that was the big deal.  What should have been the big deal was the issue of the males in the film lusting after her.  YUCK.  Yeah, that sums this movie up, I can't think of a better review.

Whether you will like it may depend on what you expect when you watch a film.  I watched it because I was curious about that lifestyle and had seen Brooke in sillier films when I was young.  It's a gutsy film, and it is sickening when you see a twelve-year old child auctioned off to an old man to use; not to mention her mother who coaches her on how to get the best tips.  But that is probably a more honest depiction than you might see in some films.  I rated it high for the creativity and the photography.

The theme was tough to stomach and the underage nudity caused me no small amount of internal debate about her being nude at that age. I know nudity, for the child her age, is natural and non-sexual so odds are Brooke had no conflict about the whole thing.

I'm also thinking I'm glad that nothing similar to this has crossed my path before and I'll do my best to see that it never does again.",1379116800,5,783,4.193333333333333

257030,4,6300216950,"I was 24 when this highly controversial movie was released. I never saw it but was disgusted & horrified by a child being used and exposed to sexuality in any form. I am now 58 and incredibly surprised at being fascinated rather than triggered in light of my history.  I was molested at age 3 & 7 and, no surprise. married a very damaged man who tramatized me regularly w/ his kinky perverse sexual demands. With my early history I had a high tolerance for aberrant behavior and stayed w/ this guy for 28yrs until discovering I had 3 STDs and he confessed to his very twisted and prolific sick double life as a sex addict. I also learned he molested our daughter when she was 3 the same as he did w/ his baby sister when he was 12 (she commited suicide in her late teens).
It's been 7yrs and despite being w/ a healthy wonderfully decent honorable man, I continue to deal w/ extreme PTSD on a daily basis.

Needless to say I was braced for major trauma in watching this movie. However on the contrary it was beautifully done portraying a real piece of history. It was naturally horrible that prostitution was one of the few job options for a woman w/o means to support herself, but there was a bazaar sweetness of family and respect that kept it from being lewd and dirty. Very much like ""Dangerous Beauty"", the story of Veronica Franco, the last of a real life Courtesan of the 16th century. (Who by the way included Cleopatra!)

Please know I am in no way condoning the sexual exploitation of children here. Though I have great grandmothers who married at 14 and had children which was not uncommon in these times, 11/12 yrs old is beyond sick. But I do believe movies about the history of sexuality are important for both men and women to watch esp given the dark side of sex that's epidemic today.",1377734400,,1801,4.418674698795181

257032,4,6300216950,"I am going to start off by saying I was born in 77 and therefore coming to the film later in its life.  I first watched the film when I was in college in the late 90's after reading an article about Brooke's career. I rented the VHS version and it was unedited and contained the full frontal nudity scene.  I remem ber being shocked by it, but overall enjoying the and a bit disturbed by it as well.
I watched the movie again last night as it is available instantly through Prime, from what I can remember and the reviews this version has been edited.  I am glad I watched it again.  I do what I frequently do now when watching a controversial film thanks to the pause button, I watch, pause and read reviews, many times Amazon, because I like to see what other people think as I am seeing the film.  It's like a dialogue without the dialogue.

Brooke is striking, and while I thought her acting, Ok, she was chosen for her beautiful face which is significant for the role she played.  Sarandon, gorgeous, Carradine, creepy.  I don't know if the version on Prime was in HD but the visual experience was a feast.  The grainy VHS copy I watched years ago did not do the cinematography justice. That movie captured an era, visually and culturally, with striking detail.

The subject of prostitution was dealt with fairly.  This was a woman run business with women who seemed perfectly aware and willing to participate in the business.  They cared about each other and they cared about Violet, as much as they knew how.  By the end of the film I felt sorry for those women, not because they were prostitutes, but because others forced them out of work.  I think of the scene of the picnic after the wedding.  These women were ""saved"" from the sin of prostitution but swimming in their skivvies still willing to entertain those men jumping off the boat, but now possibly, illegally.

The topic of Violet as a child prostitute is another matter.  So many reviewers stated this just represented how it was, it is disturbing, but just history.  How clueless are you?  Child prostitution happens the world over, illegal many places, but sex trafficking of women, many underage, is rampant, including the US.  The difference, Violet was in a business protected by law (prostitution was legal, maybe not at twelve but legal) and protected by the madam (once a whore herself) and the other women in the house.  These trafficked women often are lured under false pretenses out of desperation and then enslaved by a men-run ring.  Which situation would I prefer?  If we dug into the backgrounds of prostitutes in NOLA during that time period many of them came to that business because they had little other options but there was no trickery,the women knew what they were doing, and while not ideal or perfect, there were still dangers, it gave the women a job and money and place to live.

As you watch this movie you feel for Violet, raised ignorant of any other life and uneducated, she made the best of a bad situation.  She was innocent and sweet and deserved better and seeing what she endured made me cringe.  But my anger and disgust was not directed at her but her ""savior"", Belloq.  He disgusted me.  Many of the reviewers claimed he married her to protect her.  He wanted to take her away from that den of sin, to protect her innocence.  No, he wanted that innocence for himself just like the horrid man who paid $400 dollars to ""pop her cherry"".

  I think of the scene when she runs away to his house (which she was free to do) and he takes her in not to care for her but to have sex with her and photograph her in the nude. He isn't any different than those Johns who paid for her. If he wanted to save her, he wouldn't have married her, wouldn't have had sex with her, and ask her if she knew how to prevent ""being with child."" He would have educated her , sent her to school, gave her options other than the legal from of child prostitution he had entered into (marriage).  His anger towards her, his sexual obsession, that is the disgusting part of the movie and of child prostitution.  Without that, it wouldn't exist.  Truly, what is the deal with old men and young girls?  That is what I kept thinking, yet saw very few reviewers broach that subject.

The only likable male character is the  man who marries Sarandon.  Wants to take care of both children and educate Violet.  He is the only man who indicates disgust at the auction of Violet, ""it makes my innards squirm to see such a thing.""  Yet he is a minor character in only three to four scenes.

I would like to know what the director wanted us to take from that film?  Who is the heroic character?  Was Belloq supposed to be it?  Was he even supposed to be likable? While Sarandon's character makes may questionable decisions (did she have Violet participate with her and one of her John's? Violet follows her mother and a John back to the room and then closes the door. I was confused by that.) but she came back for Violet.  Many might not forgive her for leaving Violet, but I did, she was trying to secure a future.

The movie is shocking only that it is thought-provoking on a subject not often discussed, but more often culturally laughed at or accepted.  (older men and  young women). Those who watch should not be shocked by sex and prostitution but by the fact that the only reason Violet became a prostitute is because the madam realized her youth and virginity was a sell-able commodity. That is what you should be disgusted by.

 One reviewer questioned why so many where upset by the frank sexual nature of the film, but violent death and murder are common place themes.  I agree.  I teach high school students and this film is tame in comparison to the sexuality and violence they see, hear about ,or watch.  This movie is sexual, it is set in a whore house, but that is really a side issue.  The film explores something deeper, and while I wouldn't want my  younger children to watch, I think it would be appropriate to watch with an older teen and discuss the real issues this movie presents.

Also, I want to say that I am offended by the reviewer that said this is a must-have for soft-porn collectors.  Get another hobby.",1374883200,7,6203,4.476827094474153

Seem that 'pedophilic' thoughts were more cultural and acceptable, rather than political.. up through the turn of the century, until 'the Temperance' movement affected alot of social 'order' and 'morality'. Brooke, who I had the pleasure of meeting in 1983: (despite the media) is a well balanced, nice, sweet, wonderful woman. Her posing nude, and being nude 'in the movie' at age 11, hasn't crippled her for life. People magazine in 1978 did an article about her - the 'controversy' about 'child porn'...front cover.(gasp)again the politics, and religion of it all. but the movie was not degrading, nor inciting what we hear today about 'child abuse' or 'harm'.. rather depictions, and documentary style (of the era) was painted into this movie, which for 1978 was no more shocking than Linda Blair vomiting all over a priest. like any cult favorite, you have to be a realist, and have an open mind about 'all' aspects of life; or you might think you have to start a political movement on behalf of eliminating more freedom of speech. There is no 'sex' in the movie; and ideally isn't 'pornographic' to the extent that many write their congress-person about. (many want Anne Franks diary banned!!) So if you are not embarrassed to give Amazon your credit card number and address- for fear of being thought a child 'molester'...and a seeing a child briefly nude doesnt 'offend' you, and you are a Brooke fan, ...'loved her in her other movies and Tv as well, then collect this piece of history, before it disappears.",1368748800,4,1870,4.8286604361370715

I was raised proto-hippie and underage sex,nudity and the lot of American puritanism didn't and don't afflict me. I recall an interview with the woman from who Malle got the story and the interviewer asked her what damage being auctioned off at 12 as a prostitute did her. The woman replied something to the effect of-none. She said her life had been good. She left the brothel when they were closed and eventually married and had a family. She looked upon her time in the brothel as a warm time in her life. Malle shows the familial nature of the brothel so well. Contrary to the reviewer who felt the moral outrage displayed by the piano payer was pivotal to the movie I thought it almost superficial. The movie is a whole piece. There are no Kurasawan ""cinematic moments"". However the moment when Brooke Shield tells the man who bought her that:""I'm glad it was you -I can feel your heat through my nightgown""(delivered with an authority few 12 year old actors could muster) whereupon the man bursts into action and carries her to the bedroom intent on ravishing her.

257063,4,6300216950,"There's not a lot more that I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said. I agree totally that the nudity is too much, especially because Violet is so young.  It's disturbing to see.  In other movies with nude kids, they aren't sexual roles, and this one is, which is hard to watch at times.  But the story is good, though quite sad, to see this young girl who doesn't know any better being sold off to the highest bidder to ""get her cherry popped"" as they put it.

One reviewer on here said, and I quote: ""If they gave Academy Awards for small moments, this film would deserve one for the scene in which Violet is being auctioned off, and the camera closes in on the eyes of the Black piano player, full of silent moral judgment.""  I disagree that he was full of silent moral judgment.  I had the feeling, watching his reactions, that he wanted to save Violet because she was a child being auctioned off for her first time.  I thought he was going to bid on her to save her, but of course he didn't do that, and later on in the barn, the older black woman tells Violet that ""the black ones never go upstairs"" so that explained to me why he didn't try to bid on her, besides probably being broke.  I don't imagine he was paid much for being the piano player there.

Ultimately, the movie made me very sad, knowing that things like this went on and probably still do at brothels.  It was well done. I just wish they hadn't shown so much of Violet's body.. I kept thinking that it would attract pedophiles, which made me feel sick to my stomach.  I doubt I'll watch it again for that reason, even though I like the story.

They start the movie with a nice plesent scene, violet is roaming around with the paino playing and every seems happy but it doesn't take long and this world to be shown in the light and the happness is empty...

To really understand this movie one must understand the time it was set in 1917, WWI had been raging for 4 years and everyone's mind set was one of shock and fear no one beleived they lived in a safe world, but go back 5 or 6 years ealery and the mind set was totaly different and ppl were livng in a fantasy world where they beleived they were safe and the world around them was a safe one. Open scene Violet is skiping happly through the brothel she lives in without a care of fear in the world and beleving her world is a safe one, her mother on the other hand was wiser and older and she knew the hell she was living in. I liked the 2 adventures these two ladies took, it made the story more beleiveable and it also made you understand why they mde the choices they made. For example at early point in the movie when Violet's mother wanted to leave and how Violet wouldn't leave, that made total since to me, there was no reason for her to leave let she thought she had everything she wanted she was living in her fanstay pre WWI world. Than when Violet's mother does leave and they begin to shater her world and the cold truth of life in a brothel is revealed to her it makes those parts even more powerful. I liked the parts where the guy was shooting the gun radomly into the air, the part where they auctioned off Violet, and also the part where Violet was in the bath and the old women came up to show her off, and finaly the part where they was thrown out into the streets, thoes were all great parts of the movie the added to show Violet what the real world is like also helped to grow her charecter so at the end when she faces the same choice she had in the begining she knows the dangers of the real world and makes the right choice, and if nothing had happened to shater her world the choice she made wouldn't have made any since.

It is a wonderful story the only problem I had with the movie is I didn't really care to have a 12 year old girl running around nude in this movie, yes because of the setting of the movie it wouldn't have made any since not to inculde them I just think they should have found an 18 year old girl that looked like brook shields for a stand in. My second problem with this movie is they were way to easy on the guy who married Violet, he hit, had sex with and threw out a naked 12 year old girl into the streets, he should have either been sent to prison for life or shot by the end of the movie, not just let off with a broken heart.

Rather there is a plot that unfolds on its own good time, well drawn characters, excellently written dialogue, perfect atmosphere, and gorgeous photography.

Still, I understand why some might find the film objectionable.  There is nudity, even nudity of a pubescent girl.  There is open talk of sex.  And some quasi moralists are more offended by that than by graphic violence.  Sex, of course, is part of life and is legal, but it must not be shown or suggested very clearly.  Murder, on the other hand, is illegal but is shown every night on TV with little protest from the moralists.

The acting here is seamless.  Susan Sarandon gives her best performance, as does Brook Shields.  But the performance that I found most startling was that of the bordello madame.

There was an area of New Orleans called Storyville, for some 20 years, where prostitution was confined, ending about World War I.  That much of the plot is true.  And the photographer Bellocq existed; some of his art has survived.  But he didn't look anything like the character in this film, or so we are led to believe from descriptions of him.

257114,4,6300216950,"Girl child stars have been used as either virginal beings or Lolita.  Brooke Shield's mom knew what to use with Brooke when she was just such a child star.  While these days we see Lolita more in the music visual genre (ex. Britney Spears), Brooke was one of the sexiest young girls ever to grace the silver screen.  While more famous for the nearly nude scenes in Blue Lagoon, this was a movie that has since fallen into the slush pile but had her reputation solidified as Lolita.

Brooke is a twelve year old girl whose mother, Susan Sarandon, runs a brothel in New Orleans around the turn of the twentieth century.  As Brooke is turning twelve, she is ready to be sold as a baby prostitute in her mother's brothel.  Brooke rarely dresses in a provacative way, she wears make up with the terrible heavy hand that only a twelve year old can apply to her own face.  She's cute, sweet, innocent, and childlike.  What man wouldn't bid on her virginity?  *Shudder*

It was more of the thought that things like this really happen in the world that made us think.  And to think that Brooke herself was being sold to the highest bidder to star in a movie about this is what made us cluck our tongues.  What a horror story.

But it worked for Brooke and her mom.  Unlike her counterpart child stars who would fall apart from the stereotypical child star fast life, Brooke grew up to be a well adjusted, well educated, and very successful adult.  She is the exception, but there are hundreds of others out there who are not so lucky, really living this hideous life.  That's the real horror story.",1216771200,7,1589,4.465277777777778

The scene where she jumps up and down on the photographer's bed (very childlike) and asks him whether he will take care of her before throwing her arms around him and giving him small childlike kisses on the nose, forehead etc. and reciting that little rhyme really pulled at my heart strings! I just wanted to jump into the TV and give her a hug!! This, mixed with the seductive adult things that she also says in this scene (and others) is particularly poignant as we know that young Violet is merely reciting what she's heard from the prostitutes. The photographer also says that Violet doesn't know what she's saying. You just want to turn the clock back, hug Violet and give her a proper childhood! The photographer marries her because he's fascinated with her beauty, innocence and is concerned that she is only a child and should not be in a brothel becoming a prostitute. The part where he gives her a doll is poignant as she has already lost her virginity and it seems that he's trying to give back her childhood, sadly she's been exposed to too much, too soon in her life. Susan Sarandon and Brooke Shields are wonderful in this movie as well as Keith Carradine, the photographer. The art aspect & music soundtrack are amazing. This movie deals with a taboo subject seen through the eyes of a child as 'normal' which enhances poignancy and brings out the viewers maternal need to 'rescue' young Violet.",1147737600,31,1888,4.724242424242425
257123,4,6300216950,"Great movies, like great literature, are capable of evoking a definite atmosphere, that of the time and setting of the story, the plot of which, then, almost loses significance. The atmosphere in this case is that of New Orleans at the turn of last century - a slight anachronism here sets the story in 1917 to match the timing of the closure of Storyville, New Orleans's red light district, located roughly between Rampart and Robeson, Iberville and St. Louis, of which nothing remains today. That atmosphere is well expressed by the music, especially that of the pianist in the movie, who is modeled after Jelly Roll Morton, a pioneer jazz pianist and composer, and plays his compositions. For the curious listener, I have listed here some of the works by Jelly Roll and when they get played in the movie:

3:30 - 4:45,  Winin's Boy Blues #1
5:05 - 7:21, Tiger's Rag, from the typical NO repertory, including the tiger's roar
24:35  - 25:00, Jelly Roll
26:11 - 27:12, Thought I Heard Buddy Bolden Say #1
30:10 - 31:30, Winin' Boy Blues #2
38:39 - 43:20, (composing of ) King Porter Stomp, in the background when the Susan Sarandon character poses half-naked for the photographer
54:46 - 56:35, (Original Jelly Roll?) Blues, with clarinet and bass
1:47:15 - 1:49:15 Blues

We can add to this the sweet, though perhaps already outdated by 1917, music played by the New Orleans Ragtime Orchestra, with the nice Creole clarinet of Louis Cottrell, who used to play in the Preservation Hall.

It is impossible to underestimate the importance of New Orleans in the world of culture, since it can be stated, as Jelly Roll Morton did, that it was for the musical world what Florence of the 14th and 15th century was for the visual arts. The fact that such culture flourished in whorehouses instead at the courts of princes is thus just a reflection of the cultural level of racist American society - which should be proud of its lupanars - which has prevented its own great culture to be accepted by its puritanical obsession, which led to the disaster of prohibition and the present overfilling of prisons for acts, such as possessing marijuana, which are not criminal in most of the civilized world.

Beside the music, there are great moments in this movie. Brooke Shields, besides being pretty, has an interesting role, oscillating between her behavior as a future [prostitute] and that of an immature girl, with a lot of innocence - which incidentally is to be found among all those ladies certainly despised by the pseudo-moralistic mainstream, that same one which seems so popular these days in the US. The Madam looks like a true character, a worn out woman with distinguished manners who keeps up with absinthe and cocaine (not without some humor, as when she says: ""there are only two things you can do in a rainy day, and I don't like playing cards!""). And I am sure that the character of the distinguished photographer existed in reality, since I remember having seen an exhibition of pictures of such ladies taken in New Orleans at that time (in spite of the howling of some who wanted to label it degrading and censor it). Add to this the great photography, and the intelligence of Louis Malle, who has always used Jazz in a respectful way, as in ""Elevator to the Gallows"" with the music of Miles Davis and ""Murmur of Heart"" with that of Charlie Parker - the latter exploring an even more controversial subject than ""Pretty Baby"", that of an incest with the mother, in a poetic way.

The only reason I am not giving this movie five stars is because I would have loved to see more of the Jelly Roll Morton character. One has almost to strain his/her ear to listen to his composing of the masterpiece ""King Porter Stomp"" while the photographer tries to take pictures of Hattie (Susan Sarandon). Perhaps some viewers may prefer Sarandon's naked tits over Morton's playing, but that's not my case!

But on the whole this is a great movie and is to be recommended heartily to everybody, perhaps especially to Americans who generally know close to nothing of the great culture which has been created in the very places their society has systematically despised, by people which are still often considered as an inferior ""race"" (whatever that means).",1107216000,39,4249,4.747967479674797
257144,5,6300216950,"After making a series of acclaimed and controversial films in his native France, director Louis Malle made his American debut with this disturbing but visually beautiful story about Hattie (Susan Sarandon), a prostitute working in New Orleans' Storyville district at the turn of the century. When Hattie becomes pregnant, she opts to keep her baby and gives birth to a daughter named Violet, raising her in the brothel where she continues to work. Twelve years later, Violet (Brooke Shields) is old enough to attract the attentions of the brothel's customers, but emotionally has one foot in the adult world of her surroundings and the other in the navet of childhood. With Hattie's consent, Violet's virginity is auctioned off to the customers of the house; but for Violet, the pull between childhood and adulthood becomes most clear - and most painful - when she draws the affections of Bellocq (Keith Carradine), a photographer who has been working on a photo series about Storyville prostitutes. Violet's blend of childlike innocence and adult sensuality is profoundly attractive to him, but their relationship quickly becomes problematic, especially when Hattie leaves Violet behind to get married.

This movie also has a great  ragtime soundtrack  and this music helps with  the story too.",1102377600,23,1295,5.241545893719807
257145,3,6300216950,"...this movie should be remarked, as the Amazon reviewer correctly notes, also for the utterly beautiful camera-work.

And Sarandon, before her manic obsession with politics, like Alec Baldwin and others, shimmers with talent and we're treated to her full genius, something little scene (pun intended) these last ten years as ""activism"" has dissipated the sap that once nourished the talent in this once brilliant actress.  (See this descent in her jarring overacting in ""Children of Dune; marring an otherwise excellent adaptation.)

The ""scandal"" is highly overblown.  As for the movie ""being unable to be made today"", that's an odd statement.  Thora Birch went topless at the age of seventeen. Kirsten Dunst engaged in full mouth kiss with Brad Pitt in ""Vampire"", and Led Zeppelin's ""Houses of Holy"" with dozens of naked children on it, can still be bought even at Wal-Mart and BestBuy.  I know of no prosecurtor who has brought charges of child porn against the producers of any of these films or the parents of the children. And this movie's still obviously available to everyone within the US by its mere presence on Amazon.

Even more notable is that the ""scandalous"" scenes haven't been cut in an ""abridged"" version by the supposedly craven studio(s).  However, this could be due to Malle's ownership of it.

If this film really was child porn does anyone think Amazon would sell it?

Frankly, this movie's tame compared to much of garbage readily available, 24-7, thanks to the wonders of cable.

The difference?  Malle's work has clear, artistic intent.  The nude scenes of the sparkling beauty of Shields, those eyes even then so powerful, were necessary to the plot.  Doubltess, controversy in the Anglo-Saxon world wasn't unanticipated, and certainly added to the box office; but its (obviously) enduring popularity is proven by its presence here.

As for the film itself, like all of Malle's work, it's a love-hate affair.  He either hits his mark or misses to the point of (possible Anglo-Saxon) incoherence.  Here he mostly hits his target, offering, in an American environment and in English, the very different French view of sexuality.

If you're looking for a readily excessible way to grasp some part of the Gallic mindset, this film may help.",1094083200,35,2264,5.056603773584905
257146,5,6300216950,The best part about this movie is Brooke Shields.  Her beauty is obvious even at that age.  She had some nude scenes.  This is the type of film that perhaps can no longer be made in the climate that we live in.  Susan Sarandon plays the part of Brooke's mother.  Keith Carradine is also along for the ride as a not-so-successful photographer.  I highly recommend this film to those who can appreciate the works of David Hamilton and Jock Sturges.,1088035200,21,446,4.5125
257147,5,6300216950,"A brothel is the saddest place in the world. Malle however finds a dark poetry behind the red house light and gives a beautiful intimate portrait since the point of view of a little girl.
Malle always kept in the deepest of his soul the childhood memories , and this is a direct heritage from the French Mew Wave. And this statement is supported by two essential films of him *Zazie dans le metro* from 1961 and *Au revoir les enfants* (one of his four masterpieces) from 1986 who deserved him an Academy Award as best foreigner film.
This film literally made grow up to Susan Sarandon as a top  actress in a demanding role. Jodie Foster made this role without too much effort , probably due her before playing in Taxi Driver.
The script is astonishing and surrounded of a bitter atmosphere.
One little gem and a cult movie from this brilliant french director.",1086998400,9,860,4.548387096774194
257148,5,6300216950,"I was very happy when PRETTY BABY became available on DVD. Soon as I found that out, I quickly ordered it from amazon.com and it arrived in only a few days. I wish to comment on the following:QUALITY OF FILM TRANSFER TO DVD: Outstanding! Picture was very clear and sharp. Colors were lively and brilliant! No noticeable defects in even the least slightest degree. MUSICAL SCORE: Soundtrack was very beautifull and moving. It represented the time period very well. It definitely contributed to the athmosphere of the time period. SET DESIGN and WARDROBE: This movie reminded me of the motion picture TITANIC, in regards to the representation and superb accuracy of the time period depicted. Just like the musical score, the set design and costumes were very true to the finest detail. ACTING: All performers, to include the supporting cast,  did a remarkable job of acting. My favorite actress was Violet played by Brook Shields. She had this thick sassy southern accent and was remarkable for such a young age. The photographer who later married her was also very convincing. STORY: And now for the meat and main part of my review....I also own the movies LOLITA (Both versions), and BEAU PERE---which I received from amazon.com in a timely manner. These movies were HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL. They were a subject of much social/moral criticism! During all of this extreme negative press concerning these young girl movies, I never heard anything mentioned about PRETTY BABY...So I guess PRETTY BABY just sneaked right in and surprised me........AND BOY DID IT DO THAT!!!!!I knew the movie would be about a pre-teen prostitute...But I never would expect what the censors let the movie get away with!!!!!(a) 11 year old Brook Shields posing nude, a full body shot of her laying on a couch, from head to toes!(b) Several scenes of her walking around the house fully nude.(c) Many close-up shots of her bare chest.(d) Highly XXX dialogue, such as the line where 11 year old Violet tells her customer that ""I can feel the steam just coming thru my dress""(e) The absolutely unbelievable scene where Violet is teasing this 10 year old black boy about him being a virgin. She then later throws the boy to the ground and jumps on top of him. She continues to tease him while pulling down his pants. Just as she begins to engage in forced sex with him, this black maid enters the barn and scolds Violet and gives her this lecture on how wrong it is for a WHITE girl to breed with a BLACK person. I will save the other examples for you to discover and find out yourself! I do not want to ruin the surprise and SHOCK!In terms of controversey, moral standards, and censorship....this movie blows both versions of the movie LOLITA and BEAU PERE out of the water!!!I really thought the above mentioned movies were the only three mainstream movies out their that challenged the censorships with highly controversial young girl ""lolita"" content.....But I JUST FOUND OUT THEIR IS A ""FOURTH ONE"" OUT THEIR IN THE WILD CALLED ""PRETTY BABY"" THAT BLOWS THEM ALL OUT OF THE WATER!!!!!!For those of you that enjoy and search the world over for mainstream ""lolita type"" content movies....THIS IS A 100% DEFINITE MUST OWN MOVIE!!!!!! (P.S. I do not want to waste space and your time by going into detail about what the movie was about or plot specifics...you can find out that information by reading the MAIN DESCRIPTION at the beginning, or the MAIN REVIEW...also many reviewers quote and state the same story specifics over and over...Reviews are supposed to give an EVALUATION/RATING REVIEW, not tell the story over and over again in different fashions)",1075680000,41,3626,4.857835218093699
257149,5,6300216950,"For years, I had heard all the controversy about this film and since I'm interested in New Orleans history, I decided to pick this up and see what all the fuss was about.  I was surprised to find it different than how others had described it to me.  Yes, the nudity was over the top but the story itself was tragic and well done.  Violet is a child living in an adult world who doesn't realize prostitution is wrong and follows in her own mother's footsteps.  When Bellocq comes to the Storyville district to photograph the prostitutes, he becomes enchanted with Violet's beauty and falls in love with her.
I never felt this movie glorified child prostitution.  It told the story of the way things were back then.  Life now is much different than it was in the early party of the last century and I think this film shows the ugliness of the brothels of that era.  Poor Violet having her virginity auctioned and really not knowing any better.  When the creepy old guy pays the money, it made me feel sick to my stomach.  I guess that was the point of the movie.  It made me feel so many things on so many different levels.
All in all, it was a movie that made me think.  It was also beautifully shot and very realistic to the time it portrayed.  The costumes, the music and the setting were breathtaking.  I definitely thought about it after the film was over.
