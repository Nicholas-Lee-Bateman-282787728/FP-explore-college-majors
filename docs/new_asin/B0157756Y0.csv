7429327,5,B0157756Y0,I really like this movie.  It was very fun.  I l really liked the Persian Cats and of course Max Amini.  He is hilarious.  I wish I got to see more of the nerds Tehran and George because they were adorable!  I definitely recommend this when you are in the mood to just relax and watch a movie.  Hope to see more from this director.  Maybe even a Maul Dog 2:  Revenge of the Nerds,1444003200,3,379,3.96

8732856,5,B0157756Y0,This movie was so funny! I really laughed out loud with this one. The little boy called Peeps was so adorable. I know the movie got poor ratings from some but it wasn't meant to be a serious movie. Sometimes you just want to look at something silly and fun. I had been feeling down and it really cheered me up.,1527120000,,310,4.098360655737705
8732857,4,B0157756Y0,"Great movie! Its really a hidden gem. Idk of they intended as much but I really like the characters in this movie. You have all kinds of roll switching from traditional and mainstream media that actually reflect reality. You have the fem dude that is actually straight, the hood nerd, and the not good at rapping aspiring rapper, and thise are just the leads! Its not very good if you expect it to be like mainstream media. However, it is freaking funny n awesome when you watch it with a critical eye. I'd also like to ad that it is also just straight up funny if you're not trying to be all critical about it. Just watch it for sng's too.",1507334400,,640,4.297520661157025
