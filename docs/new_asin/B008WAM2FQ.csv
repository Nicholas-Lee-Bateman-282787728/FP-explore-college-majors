5186570,1,B008WAM2FQ,"This movie, was extremly boring.
The story line jumped around so much it was hard to follow. The filming was very poor quality.
I rented because it was rated five stars ,it was a time waster.",1354579200,2,191,4.333333333333333
5186571,5,B008WAM2FQ,"Great, emotional movie that deals with the reality of terminal cancer. It was slightly confusing in the beginning but was gradually woven together well. Impressive acting. Highly recommend.",1354233600,2,189,5.785714285714286
5186572,4,B008WAM2FQ,"If you enjoyed A Single Man, then you will likely enjoy this film.  It's solid on every front (acting, writing, direction, cinematography) and very much worth a look.  At the time of my writing it's about $20, which is a little dear for a small independent film of this kind.  I would recommend rental through Amazon Instant Video (or a subscription-based video streaming outlet you may have heard of) before buying the movie.  The DVD does have some neat interviews that may be of interest.

5186573,5,B008WAM2FQ,"Stunning film in every way. Confusing at first, but in the unraveling, you care about these people, the acting is amazing, the visuals are amazing, and if you have any propensity toward empathy, this film will kill you. One of the best I've seen in many years.",1343520000,11,260,4.553191489361702
5186583,1,B008WAM2FQ,"More evidence of the moral depletetion and corruption to which the American culture continues to sink.  This movie is about the depraved and utter selfishness of the ""It's all about me"" attitude which has been, and continues to be, promoted in our society, as well as among so many others.  Individual responsibility has been negated, and truth has been declared relative so that man may do whatever he chooses via a self-butchered and obliterated conscience.  Don't waste your hard earned dollars on this loser.",1441411200,,512,5.071428571428571
5186584,5,B008WAM2FQ,"The synopsis gives the wrong impression of this movie, indicating that Matthew Goode's character is a real bad boy. To the contrary, he is a good man dealing with profound grief. Matthew Goode reveals yet another side of his great talent. The story is told with flashbacks and flash forwards, which keep it fresh and interesting.",1432080000,3,329,4.892857142857143
5186585,1,B008WAM2FQ,"Overacted, over cooked melodrama. Cast of good actors with a story that is neither believable nor worth experiencing.",1428278400,2,117,5.555555555555555

5186593,2,B008WAM2FQ,The behavior is irrational and unpleasant to watch.  Too deep for my taste.  I like to be entertained rather than trying to figure out the plot or trying to explain to myself the rational for the behavior of the characters.,1399852800,,223,4.55
5186594,1,B008WAM2FQ,"This is a wonderful film, and when one works out the story line, it is very rewarding.  The poor man is devastated and several women are trying to give him consolation.
I would recommend this film to anyone who likes good Australian movies.  Marta Dusseldorp is her usual wonderful self, even though her role is fairly brief.  Also loved Essie Davis. The leading man, Matthew Goode is also a marvellous actor, and the cooking scenes are better than anything on Master Chef or My Kitchen Rules!",1398643200,,493,4.709302325581396
5186595,4,B008WAM2FQ,"This film starts as a jagged mosaic, with brief scenes out of time and out of context.  Only further into the film does the viewer derive the info needed to properly sequence the protagonist's actions, which profoundly changes our perceptions of this complex man.  This directorial trick, of having us feel one way about these characters, but -- after further exposition  -- change our minds is effective, but also rather off-putting.  Eventually the film settles down into telling its story in a more straightforward manner, and the viewer's patience with the preceding jumbling is well rewarded, many times over.  This is a beautiful film, with strong emotional performances from a great cast of actors.  And, yes, a box of tissues might come in handy.",1398556800,,754,5.040322580645161
5186596,4,B008WAM2FQ,"I watched this movie for one reason and one reason only -- Matthew Goode.  He is such a talented young actor that I have made it a mission to watch every one of his recent films.  I must admit that it was a bit of a slog watching ""Burning Man"" and yet I'm glad that I persevered to the end.  The frenetic editing took some getting used to but in the end it came together.  Goode's portrayal of this tormented man is quite remarkable and should have received a great deal more recognition.  I may take the leap and re-watch it for that reason alone.  Don't watch this film if you're into the cookie cutter mold.  However, if you are up for a challenge, give it a go.  Goode will not disappoint you.",1398211200,2,697,4.18796992481203
5186597,1,B008WAM2FQ,Didn't make sense and we watched it for awhile. Finally turned it off. Very boring It was rated pretty well and we were surprised,1398211200,,129,4.416666666666667

Story of his young wife dying of Cancer and how he deals with the loss

5186599,2,B008WAM2FQ,"Unnecessarily confusing, creates an accurate perception of the main character that makes is difficult to care about or even interested in trying to understand what was driving his behavior.  Also, it is unnecessarily graphic in order to make a point.",1390262400,,250,5.25
5186600,5,B008WAM2FQ,"This is a tragic story of love and loss. Tom loses his young wife, who he adores, to cancer, leaving him with a small child to raise. Tom being young himself, has no experience for coping with a loss of this magnitude, and lacks the skill to deal with it. So, he slowly begins to self destruct, until he, himself is faced with the possibility of death. In the end, he accepts the reality, tht even though his wife is physically not with him, but through her son, and their memories of her, that she will never truly be gone. That her life had value and was meaningful....... very emotional, and touching story. Very well made and highly recommended. One of the finest performances of Matthew Goodes career.",1388707200,4,706,4.5234375

5186602,5,B008WAM2FQ,"Although this film has no mentally ill characters, it reminds me of Peter Falk's greatest performance in ""A Woman Under The Influence."" The audience is deprived of the tools to make a fair judgement of this man until the last half of the film.  This is a great use of non linear story telling because the emotions truly are experienced in isolated segments.  Every adult should see it.",1379980800,,385,4.647058823529412
5186613,5,B008WAM2FQ,"5 stars as this bizarre love story has many surprises in its well acted, well directed script. Though hard to track story at times, it is worth the effort as love is rarely as simple as it may look on the surface. I had to watch it twice to put it all together. But as love and men go, that's understandable.",1377302400,,308,4.065573770491803
5186614,5,B008WAM2FQ,"Seeing a story about grief and loss in reverse is an interesting twist; without giving too much of  the story a Chef looses his wife to cancer and is forced to raise their son by himself.  He is lost with grief ,  trying to comprehend on  how to move forward with raising his son, and to  continue to run his resteraunt.  As can be imagined  the weight of all this human drama is crippling, leads to some very nasty confrontations, and a car crash.  This is a really a good film.",1375660800,3,479,4.186813186813187
5186615,5,B008WAM2FQ,"This is a  sweet, delicate, exploration of a family.  Matthew Goode's character and portrayal are multilayered and always surprising.  At any moment you can feel him thinking, refining and making choices as most of us do in ""real life"".  The boy is believable and precocious without being bratty. I was unfamiliar with Bojana.  The always good Gia Carides was a pleasure.  I really enjoyed this movie,the story as described had NOTHING to do with the plot.",1374796800,,456,4.934210526315789
5186616,4,B008WAM2FQ,"I am a big Matthew Goode fan and until watching this I never heard of Rachel Griffiths.  Both do an outstanding job.  After viewing the segment when Goode prepares that ""extra special"" meal for the customer who sent his food back now makes me think twice before I'll ever consider doing that again.

The director could have eliminated several of the prostitute sections, shortened the film and the point still would have come across. Some of Goode's ""choice words"" could have been cut too. Both somewhat cheapened the relationship he had with Griffith's.

I could almost feel Rachel Griffith's pain.

I recommend purchasing this film unless you have time to watch it twice as a rental.  I got a little impatient with it's length so I skipped a few scenes the first time through.",1368316800,,778,4.768656716417911
5186617,4,B008WAM2FQ,"The jury in our house is still out on this one. We agreed it is a well made film and the cinematography is exquisite. We even, although in my case grudgingly, agreed that the narrative worked. You have to concentrate and I mean concentrate to put all the pieces of story, dialogue and image into context to get the whole story. In the end is the story worth the effort. I think so. The theme is not one often taken on by cinema as story-telling and it does not hold back on the emotional punches. So if you like your film viewing to be a challenge, a bit of eye to brain puzzle co-ordination then this could work well for you. Now for the down side. Why do we have to have every movie populated by beautiful (and I mean generally Anglo stereo types of blonde/buxom and well a bit shallow) putting bums on seats sex, tits and eye candy and smouldering blokes with chips on their shoulder and quippy put downs. I guess it sells. But it gets in the way of the meat of being engaged, made to think, emote and not just entertained. Secondly, trite shots shot beautifully just become naff when it is obvious they are unbelievable. In this the star for me was the two male leads-father and son and the interaction between them coming to terms and making sense on collision course of something neither had the skills to deal with. Yeah, I'm being obtuse because in no way do I want to give the plot away. So if the crack in this review resonates, have a watch and see what you think. One reviewer, not on this site, said they had to watch it three times to get it-a picture/pattern forming.",1366848000,3,1582,4.3120805369127515
5186618,5,B008WAM2FQ,"The acting was superb.  I didn't understand what was happening at first, but a few minutes into the movie, you realize why the character is behaving in such a way, and you really feel for him.  Totally loved British actor Matthew Goode's acting.  Don't know why this movie and his acting went totally unnoticed in the U.S.",1364169600,,322,4.614035087719298
5186619,1,B008WAM2FQ,"This Australian film was written and directed by Jonathan Teplitzky and starring Matthew Goode.
The film begins with a shot of Goode's agonizing face trying to get an erection while a topless woman looked on.
The next scene shows Goode working in a restaurant kitchen barking orders.
That scene jumps to Goode driving reckless in traffic and got hit by another car in slow motion and lost a lot of blood.
Then the scene jumps back to the restaurant while Goode did all kinds of unthinkable things to a cooked duck just because
a customer wanted it more well-done.
Afterwards we were introduced to Goode' ex(?)-wife and child then Goode destroyed a picnic just because a rugby player bumped
into him.  Then someone was in the hospital(dying?) and tears were shed.
I must admit that there were so many jump cuts from the 1st 30 mins that I could have missed mentioning some scenes and not
remembered them in correct orders.
What bothered me was not watching a man with all sorts of offensive behavior.  There were a lot in the movies.
It was the annoying non-linear filming style of Jonathan Teplitzy that offended me.
My question for Mr. Teplitzy is why can't he tell his story in straightforward format or not so recklessly non-linear?
Filmmakers must understand that they are making films for the people who watch their films.
Films are unlike novels which the creator can take some liberty in the narrative.
Using non-linear filming style must have its justifications.
The manner and style that Mr. Teplitzy used for this film are pretentious and maddening to say the least,
and with that annoying piano soundtrack added to the fury.
I could only endure 30 mins of this film and watched another DVD instead.
I do not set high standards for watching movies and seldom do not watch them till the end.",1357776000,7,1800,4.747603833865814
5186620,5,B008WAM2FQ,I loved this movie......it's a heart wrencher but well done. Matthew Goode was excellent and the son was really great as well.,1356652800,,126,4.7727272727272725
5186621,4,B008WAM2FQ,This movie doesn't diasppoint and Matthew Goode gives the performance of his career.  While I found it terrible sad - I loved it anyway.,1355011200,,136,4.666666666666667
5186622,5,B008WAM2FQ,"One of the best movies I saw all year. Although it was a bit confusing initially, I enjoyed it so much I saw it again the next night, and loved it even more. The acting was superb, the emotions were raw and real.",1355011200,3,212,3.953488372093023

8531383,5,B008WAM2FQ,"You might have to see this movie twice, to make sure you didn't miss a thing.  For me, Matthew Goode is as goode as it gets.  And yes, that's not a typo.  Check out his other movies and I know you won't be disappointed.  You will be seeing more of him in the future.  I think so much of his acting ability, I guess I should take on being President of his Fan Club.  ""Imitation Game,"" ""A Single Man,"" and ""Leap Year"" are three of my faves.  He is so different in every role he plays.  Oh, and don't forget him in the last season of Downton Abbey.",1503360000,,545,3.9814814814814814
8531384,3,B008WAM2FQ,"The film starts off with Tom (Matthew Goode) masturbating while looking at a naked girl (Rachel Griffiths) dressed as a nurse. We then see him bleeding out from an auto accident and the 90 minutes later we are back to where we started with a seriously disjointed film with flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks. Not too terribly hard to keep up, it just didn't add anything to the film. We find out Tom is a successful chef whose wife Sarah (Bojana Novakovic) has died from cancer, but is alive for half the picture. They have a son Oscar (Jack Heanly) and Aunt Karen (Essie Davis), who wants to help out while Tom grieves and has sex with his therapist and then later we see him meet her for the first time.

The film is about Tom dealing with grief in his own disjointed way.

Guide: F-word, sex, nudity.",1480377600,,815,4.5

8531386,5,B008WAM2FQ,"First off, I found while looking for Matthew Goode movies. I rented it 3 times, then purchased it. (How stupid am I.)
He plays such a different type of character than I'm use to & does it brilliantly. I forget the name of the actress that plays his wife, but she's awesome. I laugh & cry every time I watch this. I don't spoil movies - cause I wouldn't want it spoiled for me, but imo - this is a must see.",1471996800,,406,3.9634146341463414
8531387,5,B008WAM2FQ,"This is a soul-stirring movie, one's heart will  sink through out the length. Watched it only for matthew goode's work. The minute it started with accident i was upset but continued to watch for curiosity, first few scenes are off putting. Watched 3 times that evening (really n I am not ashamed of saying it) - twice to understand the story & then watched again. It depicts a furious husband's behaviour. It's kind of moving when his sensitive side shows up eventually, and dramatization transcends limits, but that's fine except for some scenes that seem mysterious. I wouldn't call it a best movie but just an art film for it stands out. It has it's share of frigging silly scenes, though.

Appreciate the plot, it was definitely a unique film compared to the contemporary style werewolf/super power movies that get all the hype.

Not many would spend time watching anything twice n this is definitely not understandable when watched once. The scenes are just strewn, it's baffling for a while, thereafter u get used to it.

Downside: There's a lot of unnecessary nudity & use of swear words.",1467676800,,1095,4.808510638297872
8531388,3,B008WAM2FQ,"Strange story...I bought it because I am a fan of Matthew Goode!  I was not prepared for it's depressing bout with cancer.  I will no doubt watch it again one of these days,but it's not a favorite by any means.",1461196800,,210,4.225

8531390,5,B008WAM2FQ,"Looking for some Matthew Goode films, after first seeing him in Downton Abbey I bought this after reading some reviews. This turned out to be a very serious movie and I'd have to give this a heads up to people who might not want to deal with the serious, sad subject matter.  Also, not a movie for children, lots of supervision would be needed.  Beside being very sad(but still uplifting), there is a lot of swearing (but in the situations not out of place) and explicit sex (but the movie is not about sex).  The film is like a puzzle and you try to get all the pieces together to make sense of what is going on.  It starts out very confusing, many events and the viewer is not informed how the characters are related or why they are doing what they are doing.  Like in the beginning the woman I thought was Goode's exwife turns out to be his sister-in-law. His wife is dealing with cancer.  The film is about how the wife experiences the difficult diagnosis and treatment and how her husband deals with
all of it.  In the beginning you think the husband(Matthew Goode) is a jerk, until later you find it's his way of responding to grief, and he turns out to be a very admirable man. He sticks by his wife through everything.  All the unseemingly unrelated puzzle pieces clearly come together in the end.  All the actors did an amazing job. Matthew Goode shines in this film and demonstrates his great acting ability. Highly recommended, but watch it when you are ready for a serious film.",1457136000,3,1490,4.448529411764706
