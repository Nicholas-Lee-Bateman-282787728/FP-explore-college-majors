The Suzaku seven have suffered their first loss, but are determined to press on and be victorius over the Seiryuu Seven. Miaka, in turn, is strongly moved to make sure that nothing more will happen to any of her friends. Miaka resigns herself to the unavoidable battle that will occur between her and the Priestess of Seiryuu, Lady Yui. Meanwhile, Yui becomes aware of one of her warriors having feelings for her. But her heart cannot be moved toward him due to the pain of her past and the ache for Tamahome, a fact which the powerful Nakago uses to his advantage.
