Martino (Giogio Passotti) is a shy, introverted night watchman at Turin's Mole Antonelliana, the National Museum of Cinema.  He spends his days filming the people and places of Turin, and spends his nights editing his film and watching silent movies.  One night he gives sanctuary to Amanda (Francesca Inaudi), a young woman fleeing from the police.  He allows her to stay with him for a few days while she waits for her boyfriend, known as the Angel (Fabio Troiana), to show up.  The Angel is a car thief who is saving money to buy himself a Ferrari.

Upon his arrival an unusual love triangle develops, in which the two men wait for Amanda to decide which one she wants to be with.  Unfortunately she is unable to make up her mind. She is still infatuated with the handsome Angel, but is growing ever fonder of the shy, retiring Martino.  And while they wait, Martino opens Amanda's eyes to the wonders of the cinema.

The growth of the friendship, and eventual  love  between Martino and Amanda is beautifully realized.  Each of the characters, including the tough Angel, is likeable, and there is good chemistry between them.  The movie is sweet, and often hilarious.  The funniest sequence occurs when Martino challenges the Angel to fight for Amanda.  The Angel doesn't want to, but is forced to in order to maintain his macho image.  So they fight, or rather, the Angel beats the snot out of Martino.

The actors are terrific, especially Passotti.

It is a shame this wonderful film is not widely available in the US.  Somebody should pick this one up for distribution!",1312156800,,1643,4.742049469964664
