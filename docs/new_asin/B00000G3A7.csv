1215845,5,B00000G3A7,One of the funniest series ever--if you have a sense of humour,924912000,,62,4.25
1215846,5,B00000G3A7,Thank you! Finally someone realized what a great show this is and released it....now where are the rest!?,920851200,,105,4.888888888888889
1215847,2,B00000G3A7,"Despite being on the air for only two seasons, Get a Life had a number of quirky, hilarious episodes.  Unfortunately, these second-year installments are not two of them.  The humor of ""Spewy and Me"" starts and ends  with its premise--E.T., but with a hideous, malevolent alien--and may be  Chris Elliott's creative low-point.  ""Girlfriend 2000"" is better,  but still below average when compared to the show's first-season offerings.  Get a Life lost some key characters, and a lot of steam, in its sophomore  campaign.  Rhino video should recognize this fact and issue the classics,  like when Chris and his dad get trapped inside a toy submarine  (""Neptune 2000"") or when Chris gets married and divorced in the  same day (""Married"").  Otherwise, this series of video releases  may go the way of the television series.",919555200,,818,5.052631578947368
1215873,5,B00000G3A7,"4/12/12 EDIT: Looks like it's coming to DVD after all. This year. Says Chris Elliott: ""It's 99% sure that it's coming out. It's looking like it's actually gonna happen. That's all I know about it. We haven't done commentary on it, but Adam Resnick, Dave Mirkin, a couple other writers, and I are gonna jump on and do some stuff.""",1207699200,7,329,4.5
1215874,5,B00000G3A7,"This show is absolutely hilarious, but it is unpolished and can be difficult to watch at times.  It falls short of the ""brilliant"" label some attach to it, but you have to appreciate the risky and absurd humor given the time period this show aired (1990-ish) and the catatonic-drooling-on-your bib-while-you-are-spoon-fed-oatmeal-Full House-Uncle Joey-has-two-dates-at-the-same-time-oh-what-to-do humor of the time.

The same can be said for Its Garry Shandling's Show ('86-'90), which I would also like to see released on DVD.  Please.

The Zoo Animals on Wheels episode is a classic.  On the first DVD, the Prettiest Day of My Life and Bored Straight are two of my favorite all time episodes.

But - Where are the other episodes?  Rhino, my niece can copy the DVDs for you if you're busy.  She knows how to do it.  She has plenty of free time.  Just let me know.",1151798400,5,864,4.979020979020979
1215875,2,B00000G3A7,"To charge a ridiculously high price for an abridged release of any TV series is a crime. In this case it only adds insult to injury. This TV show was never fully appreciated, much less promoted in it's original run, which coincided with the early years of The Simpsons. But that can be credited to Fox Television's still relatively early, unsure of itself years when it wasn't quite sure where to emphasize its marketing. Nevertheless, that's no reason to perpetuate that crime in its DVD release. Chris Elliott was perfectly cast in this role of the live at home with the folks, 30 year old paper boy. It gave him an avenue of extention for the dry wit he demostrated in his years on David Letterman (who can forget, the man under the stands, and his Marlon Brando routines on that show). Watching this show you can see where producers cast him as the lead in ""Cabin Boy,"" again, another unappreciated work. The wit and sarcasm are the same, as is the way he irks those around him, including his own folks, which includes his real life dad Bob Elliott of classic old time radio fame, and Elanor Donahue of ""Father Knows Best"" and ""Andy Griffith,"" where she played a before her time sexy pharmacist named Ellie. I give this series 2 stars merely due to the quality of the episodes themselves, which  was the perfect marriage of writers who worked around Elliotts' delivery and humor. On that it should get a 5, but the collection offered here is a disgrace. This show ranks as one of the top 2 TV shows to get cut short before given a fair chance, along with ""Police Squad,"" which at least was given a second life in movie theaters via ""The Naked Gun"" movies. Elliott deserved better than just ""Cabin Boy"" towards that end. Try again on the DVD release boys. Either do it right, or it shouldn't have been done at all.",1143849600,5,1817,4.506060606060606
1215876,5,B00000G3A7,"It is ridiculous to only release this hilarious show in such small increments! It is my favorite sitcom of all time, but I refuse to buy it unless they put out a set including all the episodes, or at least the entire first season.",1129075200,10,230,4.25
1215877,5,B00000G3A7,I always remembered this show for a few different reasons. Maybe because of how freaking stupid this guy was and some of the bizarre plots. I always remembered this one episode imparticular. The one where they build the submarine and put it in their bathtub. I always thought about that one whenever I would talk to someone about this show.  So when I saw they were availiable I had to get them both. But the only thing wrong is they need to release all of the shows. If you like weird comedy please buy and enjoy. If you don't get yourself straightened out and watch it as well.,1110067200,5,579,4.361111111111111
1215878,4,B00000G3A7,"I have to say I am a fan of Chris Elliott and have watched him in many different shows and movies and always liked his kind of down-trodden sarcastic wit, and I think Get A Life was a great example of his odd talents in the later episodes. The earlier episodes that are available on DVD (all 8) are not really the best examples of his work. They are funny but the later episodes with ""Gus"", ""Larry"", and ""Sharon"" crack me up. I am tired of seeing this limited run of only a few select early episodes available through DVD, it's time to release the rest or at least a few more...I mean if shows like ""Saved by the Bell"" can be a box set on DVD then I think the flood gates have been opened. Release the rest of the Episodes Rhino, what are you waiting for??",1104624000,7,756,4.114864864864865
1215879,4,B00000G3A7,"This DVD offers a rare opportunity to some of us; the diehard fans of this sitcom, which appeared on Fox Network in late 1980s and 1990s. This is one of the few funniest TV comedies ever created that did not succeed in TV ratings because it was not aired on a major network. This show is about a 30 year old paperboy who never grows up in every sense of the word. He lives with his retired parents and run into all kinds of zany, sometime off-beat antics that provides entertainment to young and old. It was quite disappointing to many of us that it did not reappear in reruns, but this DVD offers a rare opportunity to view four episodes. All episodes are funny, which offers great value for the money. Let us hope the success of this DVD may persuade producers of the show to market all episodes, and a DVD with 12 episodes is made available to all the fans.",1086566400,4,860,4.282208588957055
1215880,4,B00000G3A7,"When it first aired, Get a Life was a major break from what was considered an acceptable format for TV comedy. The principal character -- Chris Peterson, a 30-year-old newsboy who lives with his parents -- was weirdly asocial, perhaps even psychotic -- with no redeeming qualities. He looked good only in comparison with his antagonists, who were usually even more obnoxious than he.
How do you write comedy when the protagonist is so cut-off from the conventions of normal thought and behavior that the other characters reactions are little more than exasperated confusion? The answer is, with great difficulty. Its like trying to assemble a wooden structure without nails. Its hard to get laughs through character interaction when the main character doesnt interact in any normal way with the other characters.
About all you can do is mine Chris Elliots innate weirdness. So not only is Get a Life weird -- it's weird merely for the sake of being weird. The writers aren't worried whether the stories make sense, either practically or psychologically, because Chris Peterson neither worries nor makes sense. What other sitcom has ever shown a dummy of the main character being repeatedly run over by cars?
Clearly, Get a Life is a show about style, not content. In trying to be different from other sitcoms, the producers painted themselves into a corner thats hard to maneuver in.
The reaction of some reviewers -- that Get a Life isn't as funny as they remembered  isn't surprising. The shock and novelty of a pointless show about someone incapable of mundane social interactions has worn off.
Nevertheless, Get a Life is generally funny, and has a few really good episodes. Neptune 2000 remains my favorite, if only because it gives Bob Eliot the most on-screen time and the largest number of put-downs. Its a model of how this sort of humor should be done, and is arguably a classic of TV comedy.
For me, the shows greatest pleasure is Bob Eliots deadpan-sarcastic putdowns. I grew up listening to Bob & Ray, two of the great comic geniuses of the last century, who virtually invented pointless humor.
Amazon wants reviewers to focus on the content, but I cant resist taking a pot shot at Rhino. Is there any other record company that delivers so little for the consumers hard-earned buck? There are only four episodes on each disk, where Red Green delivers eight. And Get a Life has a sufficiently large cult following that a multi-disk set with all the episodes would have made sense.",1054166400,9,2492,4.863529411764706
1215881,5,B00000G3A7,"Chris Elliott is one of the side-split-n-ist funny guys around!

1215882,4,B00000G3A7,"Volume 2 is actually better than Volume 1.  There is a well-made interview with the producer and he explained a large number of the questions I've always had about the series and many of the difficulties they encountered.  Volume 1 had 4 episodes, and absolutely nothing else.
One major complaint, why all this separate volume foolishness?  Just put all the episodes out on DVD and be done with it!",1049328000,5,398,4.739130434782608
1215889,5,B00000G3A7,"The whole ""Get a life"" series is awesome, they need to come out with more volumes, better yet, they just need to come out with the whole series on dvd, that would be the best thing to do. I bought them both, they are both good, but I liked vol. 2 better than vol. 1. They picked funnier shows for the second one. But definetely pick them both up if you like to laugh!",1034726400,2,367,3.972972972972973
1215890,4,B00000G3A7,"I bought this because there is no other viable alternative on DVD. While I enjoyed the four episodes and the bonus interview was nice, this is no replacement for a complete season/series box set.",1033171200,4,195,4.764705882352941
1215891,5,B00000G3A7,"This show was the best show on TV.  It was like a live action cartoon -- it was funny, silly, wacky AND intelligent and satirical.  It was the total opposite of all the cookie cutter sitcoms out there that make you laugh, make you cry, and then push a moral or a happy ending on you each week -- which is why only a small group of people actually understood it and enjoyed it.
The show itself gets a 5 star rating, but as for the DVD:
1.)  The picture quality on my 12 year old VHS tapes is better than the DVD.  The DVD looks like it was filmed through cheesecloth.  40 year old shows like The Prisoner and the Avengers look great on DVD, why can't this younger show?
2.)  Only four episodes on a disc??  Rip off.  Again.
3.)  Bonus Features:  Weak.  Interview w/ the Producer/Director David Mirkin and a Cast Filmography (WOW!).  At least they didn't list ""Interactive Menu"" as a Bonus Feature ... or did they?
4.)  Rhino pushed the release date out at least twice on this one.  What's the problem with getting these out???
Rhino should release all the episodes, in order, all at once, in a 2 or 3 disk box set.  This is such a pain.  I'm glad I still have my VHS tapes.
Anyhow, if you can get by the picture quality, and you truly have a sense of humor you will love watching this show.",1032912000,21,1289,4.178861788617886
1215892,1,B00000G3A7,"Seriously, this show was unintelligent, childish, unreal and completly and utterly ignorant. Worst show ever....EVER. DO NOT BUY THIS GO**amn DVD.",1032652800,,146,6.0
1215893,5,B00000G3A7,"As a fan of the series when it was originally on the air, I was very excited to see the show being released onto tape and DVD. Watching the DVD, ""Get A Life"" is even better than I remember. If you need one reason to pick up this DVD, ""Zoo Animals on Wheels"" is it. This is one of the funniest things I have ever witnessed in my life. Ever. You just need to trust me on this one. If the concept of a famous play based upon animals in roller skates singing horrible songs is not funny, then I don't know what is. The three other episodes are quite funny as well, but each has its weak points. Since the descriptions for the others have been posted, there is no need for me to do so. I will tell you that this show is not for all. You need to have a certain sense of humor to truly appreciate what it brings to the table. If you have ever seen the show and enjoyed it, or if you find comedies where you don't have to think, I highly recommend ""Get A Life"". You will not be disappointed.",1032480000,5,983,3.9696969696969697
1215894,4,B00000G3A7,"I'm giving this DVD 4 stars simply for lack of extras. There's a short interview with David Mirkin, but not much else. They could have at least included a few words from the man himself! Maybe Rhino's saving that for the next round, if there is one.
But Get a Life is a five star sitcom, and I am more than happy with this DVD. I have been waiting years for a good copy of ""Zoo Animals..."", possibly the funniest 30min in television history. The other episodes are good as well, though there are some I would have rather seen than ""The Big City"". ""Meatlocker 2000"" anyone?
Anyway, it's better than any VHS bootleg you'll ever find.
So buy this DVD...Missy!",1031616000,3,656,4.429752066115703
1215895,2,B00000G3A7,"""Get A Life"" was one of the weirdest and most dementedly funny sitcoms I ever saw. It ran on Fox from September 1990 to March 1992 and totaled 35 episodes. So why oh why are they releasing 4 episode DVDs? Anyone who is going to buy a 4 episode DVD of this show is going to buy a complete season DVD set. So where is it?  Anyway, fans will be pleased with ""Get A Life"" being released at all, but if and when the complete season 1 DVD set comes out, getting these 4 episode discs will have been a waste of money. Some people might say that a complete ""Get A Life"" set will never come out, but I can't remember how many times I have read that there will be no ""South Park"" complete season sets and now the first season is due out in November! Don't get me wrong, the contents on this ""Get a Life, vol. 2"" disc will be funny and deranged, but 4 episodes? What's the point? There is only 35 episodes! 22 of them make up the first season.  ""Mad About You"" also has 22 episodes in it's first season and that's being released in October on 2 discs! How about giving ""Get A Life"" the same treatment and pleasing the mentally disturbed people, like myself who love this show! I'm putting my vote in for the complete collection on DVD!",1031184000,45,1224,4.138655462184874

1215897,4,B00000G3A7,"""Get a Life!"" is one of the great cult comedies of the 90s. I wish Fox or Rhino would release ALL episodes in a box set.

1215898,4,B00000G3A7,"No matter what episodes they release, they will be funny. Nothing beats attention to detail, and whoever wrote and directed this show are freakin hard-working genius! ""Get A Life"" is the cleverest and funniest show hands-down that Fox ever broadcast.
Still, I'd like to see the Time Drink episode again, where Chris goes back to stop Gus from getting fired from the force - along with the final episode, where he fell from a plane, and his life flashes before his eyes. I wonder what the maximum number of CD's I'll have to see released before both those episodes surface again? I'd still have them today had I not trashed the Betamax.. Hmm, before I turn into Chris Peterson, I bid you happy viewing. Not often you get to see well documented comedic chemistry between son and father :-D",1024358400,3,787,4.669064748201439

I guess its more lucrative to sell more discs.",1012348800,5,370,4.304347826086956

Rhino's just trying to clarify this with the title of this DVD as ""Vol 3 and 4"" and contains the VHS volumes 3 and 4. So, the DVD holds 2 VHS tapes worth of shows in case you didn't know like a previous reviewer.

Here's a run down of the episodes and a short synopsis.
- ""Zoo Animals On Wheels""
  Chris auditions for the local community musical by lamely dancing to a rousing version of ""Alley Cat."" Amazingly, he wins the starring role of the sad wildebeest-much to the leading lady Sharon's disgust. After a long, grueling rehearsal the theater group manages to put on a play that is so sickenly awful that Chris's parents walk out and violent fights erupt between the remaining audience of ""actors.""
-  ""Married""
  Chris meets a gorgeous model, falls in love, gets married, drifts apart, has an affair, gets caught, seeks couples counselilng, gets divorced, and begins dating somene new - all during the course of one day.
-  ""The Big City""
  Chris finally takes his first trip through the giant double doors of the big city where he is promptly slipped a mickey. When he wakes, his wallet is gone. A beautiful reporter looking for a story puts the innocent idiot on the front page, and the entire town take ""Wallet Boy"" into their hearts. When they find out he left his wallet at home, the town tries to kill him.
-  ""Neptune 2000""
  When a two-man submarine that Chris ordered from a comic book twenty years ago finally arrives, he talks his dad into spending some quality time together.",1003536000,42,1339,4.6553191489361705

In several interviews, Elliott has blamed the ""suits at Sony"" for not releasing the ""Get a Life"" complete DVD set. Other people have suggested that series co-creator David Mirkin is to blame. Regardless of fault, it's a shame that this masterpiece can only be purchased via ""underground"" sources. I have heard horror stories of people receiving poorly dubbed DVDs or worse never receiving anything at all.

Release the complete ""Get a Life"" series on DVD now! It will be huge! Until then I'll feel doomed... isolated from the rest of the world, like a free floating blob of cellulite cast adrift in a sea of cotton candy soaked in dog saliva.",1226880000,6,920,4.536144578313253
