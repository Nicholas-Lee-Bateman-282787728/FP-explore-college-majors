4663187,5,B005DY0VB6,"I enjoyed this movie, it had humor, sex, politics, great acting and an irresistible actress. In particular, the humor was so typically French, light, subtle, clever and touching.",1333929600,,178,5.392857142857143
4663188,4,B005DY0VB6,"""Le nom des gens,"" a delightful award-winning French comedy (English captions) is available from Amazon.com. It features a young extrovert whose life's mission is to convert conservative men to her left-wing point of view. She does this by seducing them, feeling that they are most open to new beliefs during intimacy.

This film is laugh-out-loud funny in many ways and more sweetly subtle in others. One example is during a voiceover when our hero describes his parents. We notice right away that the man who represents his father is far, far older than his mother. Then he explains that he could never picture his father as a young man, so that character always stays the same age.

We see:

  *Jacques Gamblin (""The First Man"") as Arthur Martin, which evidently is the same name as a kitchen appliance. Any time his name comes up, he has to explain that he is not that Arthur Martin. He may be conservative, but he is bewitched by this hedonistic beauty who sails into his life and leaves him tattered in her wake. Gamblin was nominated for a Best Actor award at the 2010 Csars, the French Academy Awards.
  *Sara Forestier (""Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life"") is Baya Benmahmoud, dedicated to righting the wrongs in this world by seducing ""fascists."" Problem is, by her definition, pretty much every man she meets is a fascist. Forestier won Best Actress at the 2010 Csars.

We meet HIS parents, conservative (and closeted) Jews; HER parents (Mom is a hippie and Dad is an Algerian handyman); plus younger versions of our two lovers. Her younger self had piano lessons but the teacher neglected to teach her any music, he was far more interested in HER; he left town when her parents found out. His younger self is torn between admitting his Jewish heritage to attract girls, or keeping his mouth shut to please his parents.

Written and directed by Michel Leclerc (along with his wife Baya Kasmi, they won a 2010 Csar for Best Screenplay), we see LOTS of nudity that is so natural we forget to be shocked. We see random acts of kindness that warm our hearts, and we see adult children who really care about their parents.

Deep down, these are really nice people and we want them to be happy. It's always so satisfying to have someone to root for.",1328486400,6,2246,4.677664974619289
4663189,5,B005DY0VB6,"The movie is not what it seems to be at first: a French take on a Cary Grant/Katherine Hepburn Dull-meets-Ditz comedy.  The characters don't so much overcome their roles as the movie explains how they got that way; you find out by getting to know the poignant history of their families, how they became who they are.  The acting is first rate, Sara Forestier is extraordinary; combining a little hysteria, a lot of attention deficit and bohemian sensuality; Jacques Gamblin is just dead-on dead from the neck down.  The characters and their families all have chemistry and watching them gingerly trying to deal with one another is just wonderful.  Names of Love is funny and sexy but ultimately a very touching movie.  Definitely worth seeing.",1324857600,,743,4.912
4663190,4,B005DY0VB6,"The French enjoy pairing two incompatible individuals for laughs - and this frothy comedy fits the bill.  If there is anything special, it is the charming, over the top performance of Sara Forestier as a (very) sexy, Arab wild child who likes sleeping with conservative men so that she can change their opinions to liberal ones.  One of her conquests is a tight older Jewish man whose job is to medically study dead birds. The idea that she is an Arab and he is Jew delights her.

The movie explores the nature of identity and the meaning of names...of course. It also touches upon liberal and conventional politics, racial bias, genocide, child sexual molestation...but only in a superficial way.  The movie is much too uneven. Truly interesting issues are tossed into a salad of the absurd.  When the movie works it is because of the actress in the lead role.  Yes, Sara Forestier won France's Cesar award for best actress...she is fun to watch.  She embodies vitality. But seriously, folks, this is a romantic fantasy!

Obviously, the man falls in love and then...

If you want a truly clever comedy that delves into Arab/Jewish prejudices - and a funnier one at that - try the Spanish ""Only Human"" about the visit of a Palestinian intellectual to his prospective in laws - a truly zany Jewish family. Or...if you want a more believable comedy about an older man falling for a younger woman, then I recommend ""Girl in the Cafe.""",1318982400,20,1431,4.714859437751004
4663191,5,B005DY0VB6,"On the outside, funny and sweet; on the inside a ten-course meal for thought. A tremendously courageous, gracefully crafted, unforgettably beautiful film.",1317600000,13,154,6.045454545454546
4663192,5,B005DY0VB6,I saw this film at the SF Jewish Film Festival and I have to say it was one of the best films I have seen in a very long time.  The story is as unique as the charactors.  I found myself really falling in love the the story and even cried a few times.  It's a must see for anyone who likes a good romantic comedy which is not a 'chick flick'.,1314835200,12,341,3.7083333333333335

4663216,4,B005DY0VB6,"I don't really like to watch romantic movies, but I enjoyed this one quite well, part of it was the perfect casting. Is the kind of film that although you already know the story, it has it has enough personality to make it interesting.",1383350400,,235,4.363636363636363

4663218,5,B005DY0VB6,"Sara Forestier (Baya in the film) should win the Academy Award for Best Actress by a land slide.  She is amazing!  This is a beautiful, intelligent, and passionate film!

4663219,5,B005DY0VB6,"A good story line, a wonderful mix of people that make up the joining of two very distinctly different families, a delightful free spirited young woman who falls in love with an older, overly grounded and seriously dull man, and how each others personalities come together to provide the perfect match.  Lots of humor and some very real sadness.  The nudity is done very well...as only the French film makers seem to be able to do without coming off as rude, showy, ""crass"" or porno.  Its a great love story and you will not regret renting or owning it.",1377734400,,553,4.565656565656566

4663221,5,B005DY0VB6,"This is a wonderful story about two people who seem to be complete opposites on the surface, but have much more in common then they realize. Baya Benmahmoud, played by the beautiful Sara Forestier, is outspoken and overflowing with life. She has the most amazing, big blue eyes and is oh so very charming she could steal your heart at first glance. Arthur Martin, played by Jacques Gamblin, is a stoic, very serious scientist who doesn't seem to ever smile and he has completely bottled up all his history and emotions that make him human. They meet by accident and a wonderful love story unfolds. A truly lovely movie!",1373155200,,619,4.6880733944954125
4663222,5,B005DY0VB6,"The characters were more substantial in this film, to better explain their actions and reactions.  Their life histories were explained with surprising results and with sensitivity.  They did take up a little more time than necessary...  A very sweet gem.

4663254,4,B005DY0VB6,"I enjoyed the movie, especially the soundtrack.  I liked the last duet sang in the end.  Would anyone know the lyrics and who sang this song?  I have been trying to figure it out and have not been successful.  The acting was good although I was really looking for strictly a comedy.  This movie had some serious parts to it, yet it caught my interest enough to watch the whole movie.  I rate this 4 stars.",1367884800,,405,4.2631578947368425

The lead characters are both the protagonists, and the antagonists.  Bays, a ditzy young hippy chick, and Martin, a middle aged, straight laced scientist both have a ton of baggage . They frequently add more problems once they are together.  He's half Jewish, but keeps that a secret.  She's half Algerian, but her whacko doodle  hippy mother's  the one who influenced Baya.",1366934400,,532,4.898876404494382

4663259,4,B005DY0VB6,I found this movie oddly funny. They don't make them better than the French. I liked the characters of the movie.,1362355200,,113,4.428571428571429
4663260,4,B005DY0VB6,"The movie's basic premise--that opposites attract--has been played out beyond cliche, but the characters, particularly ""Baya"" played by Sara Forestier, are what make the movie a joy. The back story of Baya and of her counterpart Arthur Martin, essentially the stories of their respective parents,gives the story coherence and poignancy, and provides several delicious moments.  Baya's willingness to couple on a moment's notice and her frequent and casual nudity may make some people uncomfortable, but the contrast between her uninhibited exhibitionism and Arthur's caution are the core of the movie, which is why the film may not be for the whole family.  On the other hand, if seeing Sara Forestier prance around in various states of undress is a turn on, you can't go wrong.  You may also learn something about contemporary French history and sociology along he way.",1362268800,,870,5.244604316546763
4663261,5,B005DY0VB6,i love this film. everyone's a little messed up and very few romantic comedies delve into the more serious baggage/damage in people's lives and how this affects relationships. this is beautiful and feels light but honest.,1360627200,,221,5.166666666666667
4663262,5,B005DY0VB6,"This beautiful movie has lots of unexpected twists and turns and features sympathetically drawn characters who seem like real people. To good effect, the filmmaker has chosen to shift film types and use innovative devices to unobtrusively blend time and space. Above all, the movie tells a great story in the grand French tradition.",1359849600,,332,5.166666666666667

4663264,5,B005DY0VB6,The DVD works just fine. The movie is a great one. It is a smart french comedy. I would recommend it to any one who is interested in french movies.,1359244800,,147,3.933333333333333
4663265,5,B005DY0VB6,"A great dating movie. Smart, funny and uplifting.

I also suggest watching the DVD extras (making of and the short movie).",1358726400,,122,4.809523809523809
4663266,5,B005DY0VB6,"This film, originally titled ""the names of people"" in french, or in more colloquial terms 'what people are called' is an apt description of the film and how what people are called or named has a total influence over their lives. yes, this is a love story, yes it is funny but it is not a 'heartwarming, light hearted comedy' in the u.s.-american sense of the term!
sara forestier and jacques gamblin do an excellent job of portraying two people of two generations and backgrounds and how they find a common ground. the subtitles in this film are pretty good, but it definitely will help to have a beginning knowledge of french society and current events/social climate to understand the nuances of the humor here. having said that, this is an excellent film that is smart, witty, and thought provoking. it brought tears to my eyes at times with its handling of both what Arthur's mum and Baya's dad (respectively and separately at the hand of fascism in different modalities) survived, and then tears of joy and laughter during the scenes at the polling place (!) at Baya's distress. This film, poignant much of the time, poses questions about identity and belonging and how what we call people either benefits or hurts the social fabric. As Baya says, ""We're bastards. But there's millions of us and we're the future."" i give it five of five stars. one of my new all time favorites. comme on dit ""nous sommes l'autre.""",1358294400,,1419,4.7028112449799195
4663267,4,B005DY0VB6,"i will say, the girl overacted in this movie. but this is common in french films. overacting or really subtle characters. alas... the story line was wonderful and aside from the annoying girl and her overacting, it was a great movie.",1347062400,,233,4.7073170731707314
4663268,5,B005DY0VB6,"This film is about a beautiful young woman and a slightly older man.  The woman is a leftist who seduces conservative men and convinces them to become leftists.  She thinks the older man is a conservative, but he just dresses conservatively--he and his parents have been leftists/communists since World War II.

The girl is a bit absent minded.  One really funny scene is when she goes home to take a shower, but gets so distracted by multiple phone calls, that she leaves and rides the metro without remembering to get dressed again.

Another funny scene requires a bit of knowledge about how the French vote.  At French elections, the voter is given slips of paper, each paper with a candidate's name on it.  To vote for a candidate, the voter puts the slip with the candidate's name on it in the voting machine.  The scene also requires the audience to know that Nicolas Sarkosy (the recent French president) is a conservative.  With this background, you can probably figure out the scene.

I highly recommend this movie.",1346371200,,1024,4.767045454545454
4663269,5,B005DY0VB6,"This movie, the music, camera angles, storyline, acting was all superb. As zany as parts of it were it was so believable and real. It cut through the prejudices so beautifully.

4663271,5,B005DY0VB6,I watched this to listen to the French language.  Before long I was caught up in this story about how two people who seem so unalike are good for each other.  The characters were delightful; the theme timeless.  Perhaps love can keep us together.  Watch this and enjoy.,1339372800,,269,4.541666666666667
4663272,4,B005DY0VB6,"Usually I love to (try) fall asleep while french films play in the background, but this particular films story was so compelling and sweet yet bizarre at the same time I decided to stay awake.

8467731,5,B005DY0VB6,"This is an attractive French mix of a romantic comedy and a mild, warm satire of French politics. She is Baya (the very beautiful Sara Forestier), a free spirited, very attractive girl in her early twenties. Her mother is a leftist hippie, her father is an Algerian immigrant. She has followed the politics of her mother, and she tries to get into bed with right wingers, in order to convert them to a progressive outlook. He is Arthur (Jacques Gamblin) a shy, mild mannered, middle aged minor public bureaucrat. He denies being a right winger (since he voted for the moderate socialist candidate Lionel Jospin, who by the way has a cameo appearance in the movie) but he comes from a very staid family. His father is a respected engineer in the politically incorrect field of nuclear energy, his mother is the daughter of a survivor in Auschwitz (when Baya learns of his family background, she is excited at the possibility of becoming an Arab-Jewish couple, but he plays down his Jewish connections). Very entertaining, and at its best when it mocks the more emotional strands of western leftism.",1390608000,,1097,4.809523809523809
8467732,5,B005DY0VB6,"A cute French love story. I. absolutely. loved. it. Baya and Arthur's characters were so much fun to watch as they grow through each other. Vaya' s quirky character drew me in with her big doe eyes and her bright smiles. The nudity salt on in the film was laughable as they were comical and fit the Baya character's free spirit perfectly. Her free spirit is well balanced with Arthur's stick-in-the-rear character and it was a joy to watch them fall in love.
I came across this movie because it was suggested through the Amazon prime. I'm guessing it was because I enjoy watching French movies and other foreign language films. However, I found that this movie is not as deep and philosophical as some other French movies I've seen recently. In fact, this was a nice easy to watch and laugh kind of movie. It was light hearted and fun. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes foreign films who don't mind subtitles and anyone who needs a light hearted fun love story.",1389744000,,976,4.551136363636363
8467733,5,B005DY0VB6,"This is a delightful and clever movie about an unexpected romance between an uptight forensic veterinarian and a free spirited young women half his age. It highlights the life experiences of the male and female protagonists growing up in their very different families, yet in the end it shows people remain individuals regardless of their background and cannot be treated as stereotypes. It cleverly mixes in political satire where any and all politically correct pieties on race, ethnicity, sex and love are subverted by wry comedy. I especially liked the idea of commemorating not where someone died, but rather where they first tasted whipped cream. See the movie to understand what I mean. PS. be warned there is quite a bit of female nudity involving the beautiful female star.",1389225600,,782,5.069767441860465
