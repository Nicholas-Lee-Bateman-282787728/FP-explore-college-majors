6120652,5,B00GWJIDM0,"I'm a big fan of Sinbad and this video did not disappoint. New jokes, faster and sharper than ever. He's getting better with age. I watched it yesterday and can't wait to watch it again - I know I'm going to hear something new every time. Highly recommend this video if you're a Sinbad fan, or if you're a fan of laughing.",1403568000,6,322,4.209677419354839
6120653,2,B00GWJIDM0,It was ok. Not as funny as his other shows. Sinbad is a awesome comic but this show wasn't his best,1403568000,,99,3.761904761904762
6120654,2,B00GWJIDM0,"Not as funny as his previous stiff. Still a big fan, this one just not one of my favorites. Can't wait for the next one.!",1403395200,,121,3.88
6120655,5,B00GWJIDM0,"that is my man never uses profanity, this guy is just naturally funny its no other way to put it...his comedy has no generation gaps we all sit in the family room youngest to the oldest and just laugh all night... thanks Bad love you..",1403049600,11,235,4.2444444444444445
6120656,5,B00GWJIDM0,"I came across this on the Comedy Channel and was thrilled. Sinbad has always had an easy, relaxed delivery but has a way of relating to everyone. I feel like we grew up together.  The throwback '70's set was so dead on.  His coverage of the pains of getting older (he talks about gout) was just hilarious....my husband and I were rolling.

I am so impressed with his humor and genius for timing and material.  Honestly, I laughed all the way through this.  I am so thankful that he doesn't cheapen the show with language or ridiculous topics.  If you can talk about life and hold an audience like he does....you truly are one of the best out there.",1402876800,13,648,4.4033613445378155
6120657,1,B00GWJIDM0,"Sinbad was funny as ever and his comedic timing was right on the money throughout the show.  His jokes were witty, he kept the audience laughing and engaged, and I had no complaints at all right up until the end when Sinbad launched into church hymns and instructed the crowd to block in paying attendees so that they would be ""forced"" to attend Sinbad's impromptu church services.  I find this heavy-handed christ-peddling to be in terrible taste.  I am offended he would resort to such inane tactics, and am convinced that the failure of his comeback can be attributed entirely to his brutal evangelizing of ticket holders.

If you want to watch this, do yourself a favor and turn it off when he starts talking about white churches vs. black churches, because his impassioned worship service immediately follows.

For shame, Sinbad.  Many of your (former) fans are Atheists, you know.  Too bad.  You could've been back on top again.  Talent is always wasted on the religious.",1402876800,4,977,4.837349397590361
6120658,5,B00GWJIDM0,"Holla?! Yes I did! Sinbad was great!! He has a way of being funny while at the same time connecting with his audience. I couldn't stop laughing. One of the best things about his act is you can watch it with the whole family. You can watch it with different age groups, cultures, etc. He has something for men, women, any and everyone. People from all walks of life could relate to his jokes and have fun. I am definitely ordering his dvd. Sinbad you are a comedic genius!!!!",1402704000,19,474,4.337078651685394
6120659,5,B00GWJIDM0,"I watched this tonight on Comedy Central, and it was GREAT!  Everything he talked about, I could relate!! The good thing about this is that you can watch with you family...he also interacts with the audience as well. Good old school comedy from Sinbad.  In my opinion, he still got it, and you will holla with laughter!",1402704000,12,319,4.578947368421052
6120660,4,B00GWJIDM0,"My mom and I ended  up coming across this special on tv tonight and it was so funny. He talked about  many subjects like the city of Detroit, private school, tv, children and other subjects. This is great for all ages",1402704000,11,217,4.2682926829268295

6120664,3,B00GWJIDM0,"I saw this when he did it live in theaters and it was fantastic! Sinbad  always has a great show, but the editing on the dvd is horrible. It depicts his show as mediocre and it definitely wasn't mediocre. The live show was hilarious and everyone in the theater was laughing the entire time. Don't sleep on Sinbad, he's one of the greatest. A clean, funny and thought-provoking artist.",1491091200,,384,4.565217391304348
6120665,5,B00GWJIDM0,"Love Sinbad! Funny with no questionable material, which is rare these days. We are aging at about the same pace so the humor hits very close to home which makes it even funnier.",1490918400,,177,4.393939393939394

6120676,1,B00GWJIDM0,I don't know if the public is now calling for more profanity in Sinbad's work or what but this whole production is far from the Sinbad I've gown to love and admire! Sixty-four . . . .,1472947200,,183,3.972972972972973

6120699,4,B00GWJIDM0,"Subject matter in some of the show was a little more ""serious"" than usual -  a little off what I would call the ""Sinbad path"" but he still added humor to it. A slight departure from his prior shows, though he's still ""crazy"" in many moments of this one. At the first viewing, I laughed but not quite as much ""muscle-hurting laughing"" moments as ""Sinbad, Where Have You Been""?",1449187200,,375,4.434782608695652
6120700,4,B00GWJIDM0,"Still funny after all these years, a little slow in the beginning but really picks up speed.",1448064000,,92,4.470588235294118

6120702,4,B00GWJIDM0,"Sinbad is one of those guys; he makes you laugh (and feel better) by telling you like it is.  Some people just have that gift - Mark Twain, Bill Cosby spring to mind.
And in this performance, he makes you wanna holla.  You laugh as you continually nod in agreement, or at least in understanding.
Sinbad brings it!
And dare anyone to find another entertainer/comedian that works an audience as well as this man.
Watch this; you'll see what I mean.",1445299200,,446,4.493827160493828

6120704,5,B00GWJIDM0,"To me Sinbad is the funniest man I have ever heard. A lot of the humor in this routine is related to people who find that their body is maturing and doing funny things. He also talks about Male - Female relations, racial relationships and family. I don't really laugh easy, but Sinbad really gets me going like no one else. He is very talented. It is hard to put into words. You will just have to buy it and find out.",1443398400,,417,4.097560975609756
6120705,1,B00GWJIDM0,I did not like this CD.  To me Sinbad's perspective was off and I did not think some things were funny.  Seller was fast!,1442793600,,121,4.0

6120707,4,B00GWJIDM0,I love all of Sinbad's standup. Son of a Preacherman is by far his best work. Hilarious!,1441584000,,88,4.235294117647059

6120710,2,B00GWJIDM0,"I was truly disappointed with this video after enjoying "" Where Ya Been.""  The ending was especially disturbing as Sinbad talks about his father and then goes into the church service and ""Our God is an AWESOME God"" song.  I love to laugh and there are alot of things people do in the name of God that deserve a comedy routine...however, for me, this was just un-funny and disrespectful.  I also felt, again...just me...that the Sinbad who enjoyed his stand up so much... was missing.
There was language present in this video that is not family and/or faith friendly.",1439251200,6,566,4.696969696969697
6120711,5,B00GWJIDM0,"You can't go wrong with Sinbad, he's always funny and pretty much clean in the language department.

6120747,4,B00GWJIDM0,"Sinbad is funny as usual but stumbles a bit on some politically sensitive social issues. Could tell the audience was just a bit uncomfortable with him trying to get a laugh on some current events.  Even so Sinbad is the absolute best when it comes to talking and joking about everyday life.  He shows time and again that ""clean"" comedy can be very funny.",1413244800,,354,4.515625

6120758,2,B00GWJIDM0,"Sinbad's an experienced and competent performer who can put together a set; but too many reviews here are preoccupied with vulgarity than with quality or originality of the humor. A lot of mean old parents, crazy kids type stuff he's been doing for almost thirty years; probably fine if you're genuinely interested in that. The last few minutes are a musical performance and a bit of a waste.",1409356800,,392,4.779411764705882

6120762,4,B00GWJIDM0,"Sinbad is very funny and delivers humor that all of the family can watch.  He does so without the profanity laden monologue of most comedians today.  However, I thought the show was a bit long and contained extraneous content that did not contribute to what otherwise was an excellent program.",1407801600,2,293,4.84

6120764,2,B00GWJIDM0,"I am big fan of Sinbad and like the fact that he wants to keep his jokes clean. But I was very disappointed in this performance. He was not funny - to the point that I fell asleep in the middle. I woke up and saw I had 30 minutes to go. I suffered through it in hopes that it would get better. Alas, no. Recycled jokes, new ones not funny - especially jokes about teachers preying upon children. Sad.",1407110400,2,400,4.0125

6120770,4,B00GWJIDM0,"Yes... He's wiser...
Yes... He's still funny...

Sinbad is one of my favorite comedians. He serves as a reminder to the upcoming comedians - you don't have to be vulgar to be funny. I love the way he interacts with the crowd during his performances. I was fortunate to see Sinbad live when he came to Toledo a few years ago. He ""schooled"" me twice from the stage on the topic of marriage (I told him I wanted my husband to write me love letters - his advice was... ""Why should he write you love letters when he is sitting right next to you."" My husband still laughs about that.

Sinbad touched on a few topics - some controversial, but he put his realistic yet comedic spin to it. I really enjoyed this DVD. If you are looking for a mature comedy DVD without the vulgarity plaguing our TV sets these days - Purchase it.",1406419200,9,819,4.27741935483871

There were a few moments that were worth a chuckle, but nothing nearly as good as his other material.  I've always appreciated his clean comedy that can be watched and enjoyed by the entire family, so if you haven't seen his other stuff, please check it out.",1405296000,,423,4.613333333333333

6120780,3,B00GWJIDM0,"Pretty funny standup.  We saw Sinbad years ago and he's just as funny how as he was back then.

The only complaint I have about this is that I don't need to hear his obviously misguided slant on Trayvon Martin.  He goes on about it as if he was there and knows Trayvon was the victim.  The state of Florida could prove no wrongdoing in the case.  If Sinbad had information the prosecution didn't, perhaps he should have stepped forward with it.

Stick to jokes everyone can enjoy, Sinbad.  Stay out of inflammatory and political topics (especially when you haven't even taken the time to research them).",1404691200,,603,4.579439252336448
