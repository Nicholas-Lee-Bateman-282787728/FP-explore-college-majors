8488502,5,B005XB8T40,"- Synopsis: Our main character is in for a huge surprise when he routinely builds upon his juice can collection. His day goes on like any other until one of his drinks transforms into a cute girl! Unknowingly, he is involved in an experiment that will decide the future of 2 types of Akikan girls: the aluminum can and steel cans. With various enemies to deal with, as well as whacky situations, our main character must press on as his once ordinary life changes drastically.

- Comments: Nice and simple anime to relax and watch. Nothing crazy really goes on in this anime. Some of the scenes are silly and loaded with fan-service, which helps add humor and entertainment.

I would say this is a much more tamed version of stimulating animes such as Sekirei. For one, there isn't any nudity. The girls are pretty easy to tell apart thanks to their color-coded and flavor inspired theme/design. Much of them are also cute and adorable. Most of them are content with just being with their masters.

- Analysis: Trouble tends to come to even those that act cautious. Those that actively engage in reckless behavior probably won't live a long life. As such, the protagonist unwillingly wants to be involved in anything dangerous. A smart way to live, however, his enemies don't share the same sentiments. Which goes to show that most people will never be able to agree. Unless agreeing to disagree counts.

Socializing is also a commonly addressed concept. This is most likely true for the simple reason that humans need social interactions to survive. As well, as to make life more enjoyable. Basically, the power of bonds is probably the one thing that can bring people of different backgrounds together. It's a bit of a cliche, but nobody is truly alone in the world.

- Features: Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-14 for violence and fan-service.

8488504,4,B005XB8T40,"Only in Japan... With a fateful kiss on the rim of a steel can, Kakeru finds himself smooching a pretty blonde who tells him that she's a sentient soda container, and he'd better get used to her since he purchased her. It's soon revealed that there are several other bubbly soda-girls in town, and in fine anime fashion... they gotta fight. It's an internecine squabble between aluminum and steel cans, as it turns out. (Oh, the prejudice! The bigotry! Why can't we all get along?!) Carbonated shenanigans ensue.

Akikan is too obscure a title to merit high-profile reviews anywhere, but among anime reviewers on the Internet, it has often been panned as a mediocre copy of more popular anime in the ""battle harem"" genre. Listen, not to kick up a fizz, but I completely disagree with this assessment! I laughed and smiled all the way through it, and I suspect the reason a lot of people can't get into this series is that they mistake it for a serious show. The thing is, Akikan is a parody. A gentle parody, but a parody nonetheless.

More than any other anime, I feel like Akikan is poking fun at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sekirei/dp/B00BCPOEI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sekirei</a>, copying some things with a twist, and totally inverting others for comedic effect. In Sekirei, the mad scientist CEO of a ridiculously wealthy corporation creates battle-maidens who must live with a male ""Ashikabi"" who unlocks their power with a kiss as the girls fight one another for supremacy. Sugary-sweet Musubi finds shy ""good guy"" Minato, and a sweet romance ensues. In Akikan, on the other hand, the evil organization behind things is an under-funded government economic research study with two employees, so their budget is drastically smaller (yay, realism!) and their kiss-activated combatants are battling soda can women. The point of the battle is also much more modest: determining which metal makes for the most economically-sensible soda container. As for our protagonists, rather than a standard, easily-embarrassed shy-guy, Kakeru is a foul-mouthed and narcissistic class clown with a good heart but zero sense of shame. Melon is surprisingly unsweet to him (maybe she's diet?) and is unambitious about her future as a soda can. Her inner turmoil mainly stems from the abandonment issues that come with being a disposable consumer good people use for about 2 minutes, crush, and toss in the trash. The stakes are hilariously small, and if you allow yourself to soak in the mixture of absurdity and ""that's... actually kinda logical"" appropriateness, Akikan can be a very satisfying show.

Where this anime probably made a mistake and lost some viewers is that its parody is so gentle as to be almost imperceptible at times. For all its weirdness, it follows the ""battle harem"" formula to the letter, and it follows it with a straight face and sometimes with sincerity. Akikan seems to have trouble deciding if it wants you to laugh at its characters as exaggerations of tired formulas it's poking fun at, or caring about them as people worth loving within the context of their own universe. The shift is never jarring, but I think Akikan could have found a more broadly-accepting audience if it had either laid the silliness on a little thicker (a la Excel Saga) or worked with more pathos on the character development.

Even so, I stand by my recommendation with this one. Akikan won't be everyone's thing. It isn't hearty fare that gives you food for thought or animated health food that makes you a more humanistic-minded person. But as soda for the mind - when you get home and just want something fun and sweet with a little pop to help you kick back and relax - Akikan is well-worth popping the tab on.

8488508,4,B005XB8T40,"Your soda can turns into a woman. Thankfully, it is not your mother telling you to stop drinking soda...but a cute girl with special soda powers to fight against other sweet beverage women!

Sounds completely wild and off the wall right? Well Akikan is just that. The story is pretty much described in that opening sentence. Drinking the soda summons her out and she is able to fight using her soda powers. In the midst of this there are many episodes of hilarity as the soda girl is brought into regular daily life. But don't worry, this is mostly a fan service battle anime and it gets back to more action soon enough.

However, despite all that, this is not a very fancy looking series. Art is clearly a step down when compared to others of the time period. The characters are also all rather cookie cutter. If it wasn't for the rather original plot, this series would get more of a generic label.

Akikan is at least worth a rental. If you are a fan of romantic comedy animes, it is worth a look. But, will you remember it fondly after that? This is where it gets tough. It is not a bad show, but after the originality of the soda girl concept wears off, you may start to see it for what it is...generic anime. There are a lot better shows which haven't gotten to the states yet. This is the only reason a star is taken off. It is likable, but if you've seen better, you likely will never see it again. Take it for what it is. If you enjoy it then by all means, tell a friend. The more animes get sold, the better the industry recovers and the more chances we'll have at even better shows.",1324944000,18,1593,4.268211920529802
