8522180,5,B007VBUGN2,"Boz does it again.  ALL of my kids have loved Boz and even still the teenagers will sit down and watch it with the little ones.  Drew and Gracie are the sweetest, most adorable characters and I appreciate they model siblings having fun and getting along.  Fun videos and catchy (but not annoying) songs model valuable character traits and Christian as well as life lessons for little ones.",1390176000,,389,4.6911764705882355
