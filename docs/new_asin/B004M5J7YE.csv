these oportunistic 'sellers' are asking for (over $100 bucks, ha!).
I notice that whenever I state something about hyper-inflated prices on
Amazon that my review gets a  negative rating. Sorry guys, I don't care.
The blue-ray of this movie, which is ""not yet"" widely available, will be
available soon enough, and at a far, far more reasonable price than $100+.
Until then, check out some fan blogs and download the movie for free, with
english subs, and watch it until you can score a copy that won't burn a
hole in your disposable income.",1311120000,14,594,4.823529411764706
