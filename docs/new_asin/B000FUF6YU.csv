Lucia is a dreamer. One day she meets the man of her dreams, Jose Simon but he doesn't have eyes for her. She's poor and he's one of the wealthiest men in Peru. While working at a flower shop she meets Roberto, whom she believes is also poor. She initially doesn't like him but soon they become friends. What Lucia does not know is that he is actually Jose Simon's brother and also wealthy. In a series of misunderstandings Lucia re-meets Jose Simon, but this time as an Italian countess. He immediately falls for her, or is it for her money? Now Lucia must decide if she loves the wealthy Jose Simon or the poor Roberto?

This novella ranks up in my top 3 of all time. While you don't get to see the entire series they do a decent job of showing you how things transpire. If you are debating getting this after never seeing I recommend you go for it. If you were a fan of the original run, well be ready to see it shortened.",1327708800,2,1170,4.082608695652174

8126662,1,B000FUF6YU,"This DVD was such a disappointment.  They have cut more than half of the novela.  Almost all of the funny stuff is gone.  If I didn't already know the storyline, I doubt I would be able to follow it.  I hope someone will come out with the complete novela, preferably with extras.  Esa es una travestia.  BTW, there are no English subtitles, or Spanish either, for that matter.  I definitely don't recommend buying it.  Of the telenovelas I have bought, the best was Cuerpo del deseo.",1178496000,2,483,4.534883720930233
