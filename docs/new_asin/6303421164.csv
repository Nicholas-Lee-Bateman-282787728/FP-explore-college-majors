8179219,5,6303421164,I have this set in VHS and I really hope it comes out in DVD.  I would buy it all over again.  All these productions are quite true to the Catherine Cookson books.  I would recommend Fifteen Streets in particular.  The movie creates an incredible portrayal of the helplessness of those who are poor. My only criticism would be these need to be released as DVD's.,1138665600,11,362,4.4393939393939394
