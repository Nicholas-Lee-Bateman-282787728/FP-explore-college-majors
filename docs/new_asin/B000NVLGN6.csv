8181936,3,B000NVLGN6,"It's in Spanish. I didn't know this. Made it difficult to follow, but the exercises are effective. Perhaps I should get a Rosetta Stone? : )",1366156800,,140,4.423076923076923
8181937,5,B000NVLGN6,"VERY GOODD dvd, SHE EXPLAIN EVERYTHING, ITS VERY EASY TO FOLLOW, NICE JOB MAYBE WOULD BE MORE HARD BUT ITS OK",1294617600,,109,4.238095238095238
8181938,1,B000NVLGN6,This is probably the worst workout I have ever bought. The music is wierd and the exercises are similar to any other strength training workout that you could buy. The copy that I was shipped was also in Spanish. I would skip this one and save your money.,1274832000,4,254,4.3125
8181939,2,B000NVLGN6,"Katie Skow is the creator of Pompilates, so I guess it is fitting that she gives herself a 5-star review on May 9th, 2007. However, many of these previous reviewers have given both Katie's product (Pompilates) and her husband's book (Gracias Africa by Ricardo Villarreal) 5-star reviews with little or no other reviews to their name.

I have to agree with K. Robinson's review on September 5th, 2009 that states the reviews here for Pompilates are overhyped.",1274140800,10,458,4.9480519480519485
8181940,3,B000NVLGN6,"This dvd is easy to follow and quite effective, but not as original and outstanding in its effectiveness as other reviews would have you believe; I am sure there are plenty of other similar products on the market.  Furthermore, anyone that works out regularly is unlikely to find anything to boost them to 'the next level' here.",1252108800,14,328,4.754385964912281
8181941,5,B000NVLGN6,"Llevo un mes practicando pompilates tres veces a la semana y en verdad noto gran diferencia en la tonalidad de mi cuerpo, especialmente en mis glteos (pero he quemado grasa y bajado de medidas en todo el cuerpo). Al inicio estaba escptica sobre el hecho de que la rutina dura slo 15 minutos pues no crea que fuera suficiente, pero es realmente efectivo! A mi me ha funcionado y para mi es la mejor rutina de ejercicio :) Tuve a mi beb hace 5 meses y en el ltimo mes, gracias a pompilates he logrado recuperar mi figura y estoy mejor que antes del embarazo! y lo mejor es que no tengo que salir de mi casa y puedo seguir al pendiente de mi beb. Gracias pompilates!",1233187200,5,663,4.228346456692913
8181942,5,B000NVLGN6,"I was looking for a good, quick workout in the morning. This video is 15 minutes long. No more excuses about not having enough time in the morning!",1224892800,4,147,4.285714285714286
8181943,5,B000NVLGN6,"I started doing Pompilates right after the holidays and I'm impressed with the results. I can't wait to wear my bikini for Spring Break! Even my friends have noticed the difference! Pompilates works right from the start and you can feel your muscles working out. I love the fact that it's in Spanish because I can freshen up on it and even if you don't speak the language the exercises are so clear and easy to follow. The ability to change the background music is a great idea and a big plus. Although my favorite is salsa, I switch to Afro-beat every now and then. I recommend Pompilates for everyone.",1202083200,4,603,4.490909090909091
