8298947,3,B001EN46SE,"THE CLOSET

Undercover homosexual men all over the world have always used  wives and girlfriends to avoid ridicule, persecution, violent attacks, and death. That's nothing new....we want to appear respectable and acceptable to our family, friends, children, co-workers and employers.

We want to get a job and succeed in an incredibly hostile homophobic society. We want to be loved for who we are but are afraid to be who we are.

The overwhelming majority of gays and lesbians are hiding in the closet and running scared because we live in a sexually repressed uptight world that rewards uniformity.  To be oneself takes a lot of courage especially when uniformity is a lot more cost effective.

There are few RuPauls or Sylvesters. These audacious queens are only the tip of the iceberg.

Bayard Rustin and James Baldwin were praised by people all over the globe yet were ostracized by many African-Americans because they were gay. The fierce fighters proved without a doubt ""It's OK 2B Black & Gay"" but many refused to listen.

 It would be interesting to see what the sexual landscape would look like if prejudice, intolerance and discrimination were abolished and  people were allowed to be themselves without fear. Who knows? We might find 90% of people are gay or bisexual with 10% Miscellaneous!

THE CLOSET is a story that must be told because lives are at stake.  Black women are being infected with HIV at an alarming rate by double dipping black men.  Unfortunately, most men living a hidden sexual life will never be EXPOSED.

THE CLOSET was the first step. Unfortunately the producers did not get the financial support to survive and overcome all the production criticisms hurled at them. I applaud their effort.",1363651200,,1727,4.951388888888889

8298949,4,B001EN46SE,"I bought the season beacuse I like the ropic and it's always great to see gay people and stories on screen. I want to support that. That said, I've only watched the first episode so far but I can already tell the acting is pretty bad. Hopefully it gets better as the show prorgresses. It's pretty good for ametuer work, though. And the drama IS intense",1241481600,2,352,4.348484848484849
