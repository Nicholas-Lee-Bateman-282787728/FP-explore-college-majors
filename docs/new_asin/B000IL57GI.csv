8506869,5,B000IL57GI,"I wanted something straightforward to teach pedestrian safety to my kids that just conveyed the subject seriously without scaring them. Presents the topic in an engaging way, without idiotic singing felt puppets and cartoon characters that would undermine what should be a serious subject.

DVD Description:
The DVD has three 10 minute videos, all made in the late 40's early 50's, showing children and adult pedestrians. Video #1 and #2 are appropriate for small kids, but be aware that video #3 is more mature, showing images that might be disturbing to younger kids, including wrecked cars and three images of people who were killed by cars. The latter are not exceedingly graphic, but give a sober picture of the consequences of not taking pedestrian safety seriously. I show all three videos to my kids (11 and 8).

Video #1: ""Walking to School"", black and white. Very appropriate for kids of any age. Shows two kids walking to school. Examples of correct pedestrian behavior, basic traffic laws, watching for blind spots, don't take rides from strangers, etc.

Video #2: ""ABC's Of Walking Wisely"". In color. Appropriate for kids of any age. Uses the alphabet as a mnemonic device to teach both safe pedestrian behavior and several examples of bad/dangerous pedestrian behavior. The video is a bit cheesy, but ended up providing a really handy framework for teaching my kids the subject in real life.

Video #3: ""When You Are a Pedestrian"". Black and white. Parents should watch this third video before showing it to small kids. This video is very frank and sober, taking a serious look at the consequences of careless driving and walking. For the first 2-3 minutes it shows still images of mangled, wrecked cars, and 3 still images of people killed by cars. The images are disturbing but not graphic. The rest of the video shows examples, this time with adults, of both safe and dangerous pedestrian behavior, and narration explaining both.

Yes, the video is old. But these basic traffic rules are as relevant today as they were then. They've provided a clear picture to my kids of why pedestrian safety is important, and a handy framework for teaching them the subject in real life.",1312156800,2,2190,4.924119241192412
