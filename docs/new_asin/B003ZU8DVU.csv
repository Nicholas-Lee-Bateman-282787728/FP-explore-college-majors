8410984,4,B003ZU8DVU,"Unlike her other 2 yoga videos (where cover says they are 50 minutes or 55 minutes and the practices are only 26 min)  it is about 49 minutes long.  There are a wide variety of poses included.  There is a pretty lengthy session at the beginning with sun salutations that aren't particularly strenous.  There are warrior 1, 2, and 3 and of course downdward facing dogs and cobra and up dogs and chatarungas.  There is triangle and side angle and chair.  She also includes balancing poses including pose of the dancer and the pose where 1 leg is lifted in the air with holding 2 toes and stretched out to side while looking other way then she brings it back to the middle and you look the other way and hold it on the other side.  She briefly has 1 participant show crow but it's not included in the actual practice.  She includes a restorative section she says where there are several seated poses and poses done supline such as bow, a variant on pigeon? and a seated split and then some bridge variations and fish.  There is a lying twist to end before relaxation.

I don't remember seeing eagle, tree,  full camel, boat, bicycles, standing down dog split, revolved triangle, chair pose with twist, or many side planks.  There is not a distinct flow to the practice and the poses don't go very fast but I did feel stretched out afterwards.

Overall I would say a good video for the price.  Nothing near as difficult as sadie nardini or some of the advanced rodney yee or tara stiles but I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it.",1307318400,4,1528,4.469314079422382
