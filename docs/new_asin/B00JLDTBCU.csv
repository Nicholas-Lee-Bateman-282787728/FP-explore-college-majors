6378105,4,B00JLDTBCU,"Whats it about?

A guy that gets talked into becoming a professional male escort by his cash-strapped friend.

What did I think?

The plot sounded dubious and the inclusion of Woody Allen left me extra concerned but I walked out of Fading Gigolo pleasantly surprised. Its a light but intelligent comedy that I actually found delightfully charming.

John Turturro (Transformers) wrote, directed and stars in a pic whose star power reflects the strength of a quirky but interesting script. Sharon Stone and Sofia Vergara play almost predatory females who are looking for attention and a selfish satisfaction that makes their interactions with Virgil fascinating. Not only what they want from him, but also the way they treat him. And then we meet a quiet widow who I think we all fall in love with a bit including our hero. But can he have her? Especially given her devotion to the Jewish faith.

One of the criticisms of this film is that Turturro is not an attractive man, especially odd given the profession hes supposed to portray but I think that actually adds to this film. Its about his quiet confidence and his attentiveness to the womens needs, rather than a cheeky smile and six packs. Hes an unlikely but likable hero.

Warm-fuzzy feelings and no, not THOSE kind  theres actually very little in the way of nudity and sex scenes. But see it anyway. ;)",1401667200,4,1359,4.757446808510639
6378106,5,B00JLDTBCU,"This is an enjoyable and charming film.  Although not Woody Allen's film per se, it has his influence. It starts with what seems to be some potential for vulgarity, but doesn't go that route. The focus is on telling the story of  the awakening of life and love in a widowed Hasidic woman. It is done with charm, dignity, grace with good natured humor.",1401062400,2,351,4.46875
6378107,3,B00JLDTBCU,"I have a stubborn fondness for Woody Allen, based mostly on films he made more than a generation ago, and I've been hoping for some time that he would make at least one more really memorable film.

Disappontingly, 'Fading Gigolo' isn't it. Despite the intriguing title, this just doesn't deliver. It's not poignant, it's not funny, and for me it just doesn't work.

If you were a 3rd year film student, and somehow your uncles were Woody Allen and Turturro, and each of them had a couple of weeks free at the same time and you could somehow persuade them to shoot your junior-year film script over a long NYC weekend, you would have 'Fading Gigolo'.
You can pose a totally absurd premise where characters do impossibly unrealistic things (Nicholson in AS GOOD AS IT GETS). That's a longshot, but to work it has to be genuinely funny and the characters have to be worth spending a couple of hours of your life with. 'Fading Gigolo' just doesn't pull that off.

The plot borrows elements from a lot of other (and better) films, including Jeff Bridges' 'The Amateurs' and 'Midnight Cowboy' (not in a good way). The dialog feels like a rough draft. This is a film to catch for free on Netflix someday. See it for free. But for me, it's not a film to own.

I hope Woody's next film is better than this. Until then, if (God forbid) Woody were to drop dead tomorrow, he's not going to want to be remembered for 'Fading Gigolo'.

Woody Allen deserves better scripts than this.",1399852800,,1468,4.524528301886792
6378108,4,B00JLDTBCU,"""Fading Gigolo"" (2013 release; 90 min.) brings the story of two long-time friends, Fioravante (played by John Turturro) and Murray (played by Woody Allen). As the movie opens, we see how Murray is having to close his venerable New York bookstore due to the changing times and shopping habits. Murray needs to find a way to make money, and when his dermatologist (played by Sharen Stone) confesses that she and her girl friend would like to try a threesome, Murray suggests Floravante. It's not long before Floravante's reputation as a ladies' man spreads. In a parallel storyline, Floravante makes the acquaintance of Avigal (played by Vanessa Pardis), a widow with six kids who is desperately lonely in her Orthodox Jewish community. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the writing/directing debut from well respected actor John Torturro. The idea for the story is not bad, but neither does it flow effortlessly. Is this movie a comedy? or something more serious? or both? Second, I don't remember when was the last time that Woody Allen acted in a movie he neither wrote or directed, but it surely has been decades. Here, Woody gets to play himself--albeit from 30 years ago, and the truth is that what once was super-funny, now comes across slightly irritating if not worse. Third, the movie for me was stolen by French actress Vanessa Paradis, who brings an outstanding performance as the widow suffocating under the strict rules of Orthodox Jews. Paradis is a mega-star in Europe and it's a shame we don't get to see her more often in American films (or on American theatre screens). Fourth, this is a New York movie all the way, and the set locations are in and of themselves a character in the movie, in particular Williamsburg in Brooklyn gets the spotlight. Last but certainly not least there is a delightful jazzy-sounding soundtrack to the movie, which is definitely worth checking out.

In all, ""Fading Gigolo"" certainly isn't bad, but neither is it the ""special"" movie which Turturro surely had in mind when he was making this. I saw the movie last weekend at the Landmark E Street Cinema in Washington, DC and the late matinee screening I saw this at was nicely attended, without being close to a sell-out. If you lower your expectations for ""Fading Gigolo"", you might even be surprised in a good way. With that caveat, ""Fading Gigolo"" is worth checking out, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1399766400,6,2525,4.815668202764977
6378109,5,B00JLDTBCU,"I suspect there will be two groups of people: those who love this movie, and others who don't.

It's a highly individual and quirky comedy, set in New York City.

The ensemble cast is excellent: Woody Allen plays the role of bookseller turned pimp to perfection, and John Turturro lends his unique style to the role of the florist who becomes a gigolo.

Sharon Stone looks elegant as a wealthy client.

Besides the storyline about love for hire, there's a poignant romance, sensitively played out by Vanessa Paradis (an attractive widow) and Liev Schreiber.

John Turturro was the writer and director, as well as playing the title role. His style of moviemaking is individual and quirky. It's a gentle movie, with a sensitivity of emotion in the interplay of the characters, and charming elements of  observational comedy.

Frankly, it's not for everyone: followers of Turturro and Allen will enjoy this carefully crafted souffl of a tale; others may find it not to their taste.",1399680000,6,978,4.926829268292683
6378110,5,B00JLDTBCU,"When I went to see this movie I admit I had little expectation of it, with the subject matter of a middle aged fellow played by John Turturro randomly becoming a gigolo at the prompting of his older friend played by Woody Allen.

I assumed incorrectly that it was a Woody Allen written and directed movie,  an understandable mistake if you see the movie, though it was both written and directed by John Turturro.

What you may discover as you watch is a marvellous exposition of this story, with Sharon Stone, reminding us of how sexy she can be, and Sofia Vergara showing us how sexy she is, in flattering but not overly revealing lingerie.  Oh well.

The story stems from a random conversation between Woody and a female friend who wants to be in a menage a trois, and you can imagine how it develops from there, but probably not how it actually develops in the movie. What impressed me was the subtlety of the piece, how well it was written, the understated performance of Turturro, who goes with the flow in every situation, it eschews comedy though it has its moments going for the more tender story at the heart.

Fading gigolo takes on another dimension when Murray (Woody) persuades a grieving Rabbi's widow married into a particularly repressive sect, to get a massage from our lothario, which provides the pivotal moment in the movie, and a woman almost literally
frozen by her grief begins to.......and this introduces the central performance of the movie by French actress Vanessa Paradis who brings a certain French chicness to the role, accompanied by a soundtrack reminiscent of those French movies from the sixties.  Really she steals the movie from everyone except Turturro with a simply brilliant and also subtle performance.  Far more is conveyed by fleeting facial expression and the character she plays, than any words that are actually uttered.

Liev Shreiber plays a nosy neighborhood patrolman with a little too much interest in Murray's enterprises.

If it was not for the fact that it says written and directed by John Turturro in the credits, I would have assumed it is a Woody Allen movie, as it has all the hallmarks of the types of movies Allen made years ago, with him playing a central character, so I found it to be a remarkable homage to the actor, writer, director by someone doing exactly the same.  Kudos for style, excellence, character, and story.

If you like Woody Allen movies you will certainly this Turturro one about a fading gigolo. Loved it.",1399680000,47,2488,4.76046511627907
6378111,4,B00JLDTBCU,"I loved this crazy movie. Woody Allen plays Murray, a 70-something used book store owner, whose business isn't bringing in the bucks like it used to.

Allen needs another source of income and decides to become a pimp. So he recruits John Turturro's character, Fioravante, as a gigolo, to charge women for sex (Turturro is the sole member of Allen's stable).

Turturro plays a 50-something, part-time flower shop worker who is also in need of some extra money. It was not easy for the Woody Allen character to sell Turturro on the idea of becoming a gigolo, and you can understand his hesitation. Turturro sort of looks like what you would think Eddie Haskell, of Leave It To Beaver, would look like in his 50's. Turturro tells the Woody Allen character that he is not a beautiful man. Allen counters that neither is Mick Jagger, but look at all the women he gets. Turturro counters that Mick Jagger is a millionaire celebrity rock star and that women don't pay him for sex.

As the story progresses, we find out that the Woody Allen character lives in the same apartment with a black woman in her 40's and her kind-of-nerdish young children (they wear thick glasses and checkered shirts and thin neckties). The kids seem to adore Murray, and they call him Poppa Mo (?!?!). The mother seems to get on quite well with Murray and is very protective of him. What exactly is going on in this arrangement is never explained in the movie, which makes it that much more intriguing and, somehow or another, that much more comical.

At any rate, after an exceedingly funny scene where Allen and Turturro decide what their pimp and gigolo cover names are going to be, they go to work. In another laugh-riot-of-a-scene, Allen is on the phone hustling up work for Turturro. He manages to set up a ""date"" for Turturro with his dermatologist, played by Sharon Stone (who looks better than ever in her mid-50's).

Allen sets Turturro's price at $1000 per trick, and Allen and Turturro split the money 40/60. With Turturro receiving 60 percent. How generous of the Allen character.

After they start taking in some decent money, Allen decides to splurge a bit. In yet another funny-as-hell scene, Allen purchases a brand new couch to impress the black woman he lives with. Show her how he's coming up in the world. When the couch is delivered to their apartment, she can't help noticing how strange the couch is designed, with swirly q's and exclamation marks and pound signs. Allen notices her reaction and attempts to defend his choice by claiming that ""he was on acid"" when he purchased the couch.

The movie continues on detailing Turturro's sex-for-money encounters with women, until the movie slows down a bit when Turturro is hired by an orthodox Jewish woman to provide her with company.

The woman has been widowed for a couple of years and is terribly lonely. She is as conservative as anyone could be; and somehow Turturro's character, whom we know little about, identifies with her. They wind up opening one another up, and we can't help noticing the gigolo fade.

I don't want to get into this film any more than I already have. But let me tell you about one more thing that I very much enjoyed about this film: It is beautiful to look at. It kind of looks like a typical Woody Allen film - bathed in warm tones, i.e., yellows, reds, and browns. Somehow or another that lighting strategy seems to help make the characters that much more human and vulnerable.

In closing, let me say that this is a strange movie, indeed. It is essentially a comedy; but, in addition, there are plenty of dramatic scenes that are very well-written and performed and directed.

I hesitated to give this five stars only because I felt that the relationship between Turturro and the Jewish woman could have been explored in more depth. That was my only qualm with the movie. Otherwise, a terrific movie from beginning to end.",1399680000,20,3900,4.687134502923977

6378134,5,B00JLDTBCU,"Imitation is the highest form of flattery. There is barely a difference between this film and a Woody Allen film. That is a good thing. If you like any of Woody Allens many fine movies, youll like this one.

This movie was included among the movie trailers before the main attraction of the DVD begins. My interest was drawn immediately when Woody Allen appeared in the first few moments. I concluded after a short that this was a Woody Allen film, but I was darned if I could recall this one. Then the trailer advertises, A film by John Turturro, ....  What? John Turturro wrote and directed this movie.

Dont be fooled, though. It may say, by John Turturro, but it appears to me that Woody Allen was the indirect, if not guiding, inspiration of this funny romp.

This is not a bad thing. You won't be wasting time watching this movie. The acting is good, good plot, Turturro is a decent director.

It also has all the hallmarks of a Woody Allen film:

A neebish main character.

Upscale New York setting.

A plot containing elements of sexual intrigue.

Puckish, smart, witty dialogue.

The most important give-away: length of the movie. This movie is 90 minutes long. I would say that 95 percent or more of Woodys films are 90 minutes, no more, no less, like this one.

Woody Allen shines in this film. John Turturro wrote his character as a withdrawn, sullen, retiring character, who Allen is trying to motivate into a three-some. Thus, the spotlight is always on Woody Allen, if not because his character has more personality. Allen and John Turturro are like salt and pepper and there is an odd chemistry to their on-screen personas.

All in all, a good, watchable, enjoyable movie.",1494460800,,1688,4.646464646464646

Delicate and ribald comedy about life decisions shaped by personal history, needing a familiar culture and shared social norms as support, pull of obligations, financial realities for a Hasidic widow (French singer Vanessa Paradis who provides echoes of unfulfilled longing on the soundtrack) mother of 6 children and Fioravante (John Turturro) a 50yo self educated bachelor living in a single room.

Each principal experiences a coming of age self discovery, self reaffirmation that life perceived as so uncomfortable in the past, is in fact what brings us to a present blossoming: dermatologist (Sharon Stone), tango-ing Sofia Vergara, desperately lonely widow Vanessa Paradis, father surrogate mentor Bongo (Woody Allen) who instructs and employs Fioravante after he catches Fioravante trying to rob his rare books store as a youth, local neighborhood watch policeman for Hasidic community (Liev Schreiber) who watches over Paradis since they were children, and hopes to marry her.

The final scene with Paradis Fioravante and Schreiber is filled with meaning absent words: being unsure of who we are, making a decision, a commitment and following through with confidence in ourselves.

6378283,3,B00JLDTBCU,"It's worth getting this Blu Ray just to enjoy co-star Woody's performance - classic Woody - but if you're not too much into that, then you might want to hold off. The story line seems very unlikely: super-babes Sharon Stone and Sofia Vergara are willing to pay John Turturro for his services. Unfortunately, Turturro doesn't really deliver in the clumsy and innocent fashion this role would require. Along the way, he's such a stud and he has such a magic touch that he's able to bring sheltered Jewish widow Vanessa Paradis back into the world of the sensual. Woody does play a very funny pimp, and there are some good lines. I was willing to suspend my disbelief, but the story never really comes together, especially regarding Liev Schreiber's role as some kind of overly possessive orthodox neighborhood watch boy scout. The scene where Woody is kidnapped by the Jewish mafia and hustled before a tribunal is rather incomprehensible. I was disappointed that Turturro didn't spend a bit more time getting the script ironed out before rushing out to shoot this thing.",1436054400,,1069,4.8791208791208796

A good, sensitive person with the right amount of misgivings & unsureness about a new venture but making you appreciate what he was going through and his affect on the people he is dealing with.  I can only hope he makes more movies like this one.",1435104000,5,431,4.107142857142857
6378286,4,B00JLDTBCU,"Woody Allen has had, shall we say, a checkered career.  He started out a brilliant comedy actor and director.  Then he entered his dark phase, in which he wanted to make serious movies that it turned out, hardly anyone except the very masochistic and film reviewers wanted to watch, because they were too dark.  Then, reminiscent of Oscar Wilde fleeing to France with his gay lover after being released from prison in England and never writing anything brilliant for the rest of his life, Woody married the adopted daughter of his then-wife Mia Farrow, who was absolutely livid with fury.  The resulting rumors about incestuous and/or pedophilic tendencies were so intense that he fled to Europe which [somewhere] remains his residence today.  And then he proceeded to make a series of what I felt were mediocre films, lacking either the comic genius or the dark seriousness of his earlier works.  Perhaps this is the last time, but I am pleased to say that some of the old Woody magic is back in this film.  Perhaps what saves it is that Mr. Allen neither wrote the script nor directed the film, nor edited it; he simply appears as one of the leading characters in it.  And that is alongside a very good ensemble including John Turturro, Liev Schreiber, Sharon Stone, Sophia Vergara and several others.

You may have heard the basic plot.  Allen plays the elderly owner of a collectible books store who is forced to close the shop as it just isn't bringing in enough revenue to make a living.  After an unexpected comment from his dermatologist, he then tries to enlist another under-employed but younger friend, a florist by profession, to become a male gigolo.  Turturro is very reluctant butface factshe does need the money, as does Woodys character.  What could have been a disastrous one-time and amateur attempt proves surprisingly successful.  So successful that it begins attracting unfavorable attention, in the form of the Orthodox Jewish neighborhood patrol [Liev Schreiber].  I wasn't really aware of Schreibers existence on this planet until I saw him on another one: Last Days on Mars, in which I thought he gave a marvelous performance.  It was great watching him here in a totally different role.  Also kudos to Vanessa Paradis in her role as Avigal, with a wonderfully luminous performance as a rabbis widow.  I give this a B+.  Funny, sweet, and it's nice to see the old Woody Allen again.",1432512000,2,2408,4.843520782396088

6378419,4,B00JLDTBCU,"John Tutorro is an actor I have not seen for a long time. I gather that writing and directing a film, may be his forte. In this film, he pairs with Woody Allen, a most unlikely pair, but in reality they are well matched.

Woody plays Murray, a longtime friend of Tutorro's character, Fiorovante. On a whim Murray suggests he sleep with Murrays wealthy dermatologist for money. Murray has had to close his rare book shop, and Fiorovante is working several jobs to make ends meet. This seems like an outlandish request, but the more that Murray sells the job, the more Fiorovante thinks this may be a way out of his morass. The Dermatologist is played by Sharon Stone, In a role that suits her well. Her friend played by Sofia Veragara becomes interested, and Murray now becomes the pimp for Fiorovante.

Murray lives with a younger woman, played by Jill Scott. He becomes a father figure to her four young boys. At one point, Murray has one of his children's head checked for lice, and he takes them all to the Hassidic section of Williamsburg. There they meet Avigal, played by Vanessa Paradis. It is at this point that this film gets out of hand, into the impossible realm, when Murray thinks Avigal would benefit from Fiorovante's services. From here on, the film becomes very complicated, and looses most of its reality.  However, many seemed to enjoy it.

Although Turturro is wonderfully bland and unassuming in the title role, Allen plays a muffled version of his usual smart *ss to great effect.  The interplay between the two friends is priceless and the writing, which could have devolved into tawdry sexual territory, is wonderfully sensitive and insightful.

Fading Gigolo could have been a lusty and brainless piece but aside from a little slow pacing delivers a sensitive look at love, morality, and how people cope with religion, death, and lust.  The strength of the movie is how it balances humor and pathos in a wonderfully organic manner.

What they need is physical affection and after one confesses the desire of a menege a trois, Murray turns to his helpful bookstore clerk Floaante (John Turturro).

6378535,4,B00JLDTBCU,"There may be spoilers.

Who can blame John Turturro, who wrote and directed this little film, for casting himself as the title character.  Especially when the story involves a 3-way tryst with Sofia Vergara and Sharon Stone.  Turturro plays Fioravante, a florist by trade who helps out his older friend Murray (Woody Allen) on occasion.  Set in Brooklyn, Murray has to close his bookstore and is looking for a new way to make a living.

During a visit to his dermatologist, Dr. Parker (Stone), Murray learns that she is bored with her husband and mentions to Murray that she'd be interested in a threesome with her girlfriend Selima (Vergara) and would be willing to pay handsomely.  Not with Murray of course.  So Murray recruits Fioravante.  He reluctantly goes along, at first with just Dr. Parker.  This leads to many more opportunities with Murray as his pimp.

Murray is friends with a widow in the Hasidic Jewish community named Avigal.  She is played by French actress/singer Vanessa Paradis who might be best known in the U. S. as Johnny Depp's former beau and baby momma.  Murray suggests she might break with conservative Jewish tradition and venture out with him to meet Fioravante.  Not necessarily for sex but companionship.  The scenes between Avigal and Fioravante are quite intimate but not sexual.  She admits that his chaste massage is the first time she's ever been touched that way.

They both begin to fall for each other a bit, but wouldn't you know it, Dovi (Live Schreiber) a citizen patrol officer, also has eyes for Avigal.  This is all just a little convoluted as are other incidents that seem to be just Turturro giving his friends a job.  But there is no denying the chemistry between Turturro and Allen who is at his best, albeit a character he's always played.

The relationship between Stone and Turturro's characters could have also played out a bit more.  Their hookups suggests that there's more there, there.  The film includes a humorous tease with Stone doing the whole leg crossing and uncrossing thing she made so famous in ""Basic Instinct.""  The ultimate 3-way does find its way into the film, but it's a big letdown.  A far from perfect film, I give it a mild recommendation especially if you are a Woody Allen fan.

The Blu ray disc is very good.  Presented in 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the film has excellent detail, solid blacks and is without noticeable artifacts.  The colors at time seem a bit unnatural with a heavy use of amber and various shades of red.  I suspect the filmmakers wanted a ""warm"" look to the movie.  Here's a rare movie that uses a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless soundtrack.  It is excellent, while certainly not bombastic as you should expect in a dialog centric film like this.  The musical score is excellent and well displayed.  Surrounds are limited to the music and some street scenes for the most part.  Turturro handles the audio commentary, there are some deleted scenes and some trailers.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.",1415232000,,3022,4.794573643410852

The let down is Turturro.

Having written and directed the movie, he aims for a decent story, and his instinct to include Woody is a good one, but he doesn't have the skills to display the story, dialogue, and characters deeply, poignantly, or humorously enough to raise this effort.

Turturro's character here is restrained to an uncomfortable level as if he is afraid to emote anything beyond contemplation, introspection, and quiet resignation with the goings on around him. While that might be his vision, its certainly not interesting for viewers. I don't think I saw a single smile from the stiff Turturro for the whole film. Surely his inner life wasn't that bad. Gigolo takes itself too seriously. For this material, and these actors, that's a shame. It could've been fun. Instead, it felt like a film class exercise.",1413763200,12,940,4.754601226993865

6378600,3,B00JLDTBCU,"FADING GIGOLO is at heart a comedy of two movements, which do not exactly cohere but are fascinating to watch nonetheless.

One movement focuses on the male buddy relationship between Floravante (John Turturro), a flower-shop worker who decides to become an upper-class whore; and Murray (Woody Allen), who acts as his pimp.  The two of them concoct the scheme to make money out of Floravante's body: Murray not only does it for the money, but to take vicarious pleasure in hearing about Floravante's experiences.  Murray himself is the kind of man who talks a lot but cannot act: we know that most of the things he tells about his past are simply lies.  Allen's portrayal of the character is masterly; his dialog full of uncertain pauses and caesuras as he tries his best to convince his interlocutors of the truth about what he says.  Turturro comes across as something of a lost soul; a basically kind person with not much idea about his future.  At the end of the film he vows to ""go away"" somewhere, but Murray soon talks him out of it when they encounter a pretty woman in a Brooklyn caf.  They remain buddies for life.

The film's second movement is a much darker one, focusing on the burgeoning relationship between Floravante and Avigal (Vanessa Paradis), a Jewish woman who hitherto has led a sheltered life among her own kind.  They never actually make love; but they are obviously attracted to one another.  Director Turturro shoots two memorable sequences, one in a wood, the other in Floravante's house, in a series of close-ups and two-shots that signals the closeness of their relationship.  Unfortunately Avigal is part of a community that believes she should lead a sheltered life; when she visits Floravante, she is pursued by rogue officer Dovi (Liev Schreiber).  Eventually Murray becomes involved in the intrigue as well.  Through such sequences Turturro makes some telling points about the ways in which women are still prevented from expressing themselves in patriarchal societies.

Eventually the relationship between Floravante and Avigal ends (it has to, to endure the future health of the Jewish community), but we are left in doubt as to whether Avigal will enjoy future happiness, despite Dovi's protestations of love for her.

Turturro - who wrote the script as well as directed the film - includes several nice jokes in the film, while focusing in detail on the relationship between the three protagonists.  Nonetheless, I am still not sure whether the two movements cohere - or are actually meant to cohere.",1413244800,,2540,4.9411764705882355

6378624,4,B00JLDTBCU,"When the HBO comedy Hung, about a male PE teacher/prostitute living in Detroit trying to make ends meet, got cancelled, I doubt you gave it a second thought. I doubt you sat down and wondered where else could this concept take me? And I truly doubt you said, What if John Turturro played the prostitute and Woody Allen played his pimp? Well regardless of your lack of thought on these ideas, John Turturro presents his own spin on them in Fading Gigolo. Part male fantasy and part satirical take on the state of life, passion, and Judaism, Fading Gigolo is hard not to like on some level, mostly due to the relationship between its central duo.

Its hard out there for a floristespecially in New York City. Fioravante (Turturro) has been watching his bills steadily rise as his days at the flower shop are being cut like the stems of his roses. That is until his friend Murray (Allen) approaches him with a wild idea. Murray too is in financial woe, having to close his rare bookstore and trying to contribute expenses for his roommate (Jill Scott) and her four young boys. After overhearing that his sexy dermatologist (Sharon Stone) is interested in having an affair, Murray instantly suggests his friend Fiorvante for the job at the low, low price of $1000. And just like that, Fiorvante and Murray are the worlds unlikeliest pair to be employed in the worlds oldest profession.

The ridiculousness of this concept takes some getting used to, but it is still quite enjoyable to watch. Allen channels his neurotic confidence with panache and the absurd plot allows him to deliver some one-liners that are among some of his best. Murray turns out to be an effective pimp, even setting up Fiorvante with a mnage-a-trois with Stones dermatologist character and her gorgeous friend played by Sofa Vergara. I told you it was one part male fantasy.

Turturro as writer/director also pairs this fantastical storyline with another subplot involving a widowed Hasidic Jewish woman named Avigal (Venessa Paradis) living in an Orthodox neighborhood and who happens to be excellent at curing head-lice in young children. When Murrays roommates children become afflicted with lice, he takes them to Avigal and upon meeting her, he sees a woman who could perhaps benefit from the talents of Fiorvante. This is the craziest plot development of the entire film; this strange but sweet comedy suddenly turns its gaze on the traditions and gender roles of the Hasidic faith.

Nonetheless, Fiorvante and Avigal do have some chemistry and begin to fall in love, allowing Avigal to strike back at the loneliness that comes with being a widowed wife of a Rabbi. It is easy to see this development as somewhat offensive to this subset of the Jewish tradition, but upon further analysis of what Turturros doing here, it is actually a fascinating piece of satire. Fiorvantes chief obstacle in his relationship with Avigal is an obsessive neighborhood watchman named Dovi (Liev Schreiber) who does not approve of Avigals sudden disregard for some Hasidic traditions. Dovi is an authority figure and while he clearly wants to appear to uphold his religious traditions, he can not admit that his true interest is not in religious law but Avigal.

In a scene late in the film, Turturros character stands static inside a revolving carousal staring out at the camera and at Avigal. It serves as a metaphorical moment that reminds us that we are all on this crazy merry-go-round called life together and sometimes love finds us in the strangest of circumstances. Therefore, a relatively fair message sifts its way through the comedy and oddness of this film; Fiorvantes romances with rich, bored, spoiled housewives are very different than those who simply want contact and companionship. Im not sure if a 57 year old prostitute and his 79 year old pimp are the best messengers for this point, however.  Woody Allen fans will enjoy this obvious nod to Allens style and subject matter by Turturro.  However, some may not find this movie very appealing, but I assure you its smarter than it sounds.  B-

It's not really a love story so I think men would enjoy this as well especially with Sharon Stone and Sofia Vergara in their very sexy and spicy rolls. Turturro is an excellent director and well, Woody Allen was Woody Allen. As he says in the movie to Allen about pimping him out, ""I'm not a beautiful man."" But by the end of the movie his beauty evolved inside and out making him just about every woman's dream guy. A true tale that beauty is truly in the eyes of the beholder. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that true love didn't win out in the end (I'm a sucker for true love conquering all) because of the brainwashing belief systems put upon women in all societies, not just the one in the film. What a peaceful and harmonious world it could be if humans weren't divided by religious belief systems.

6378759,2,B00JLDTBCU,"It is embarassing to watch a pretty-good actor like Turturro  do something like this. He has chosen to cast himself as the gigolo. SERIOUSLY. I like the idea of a mature man in that role, but he is not just mature, he is old. (As they age, men get chicken necks, too.,by the way.) He is totally unbelievable in this part. Unattractive physically, it might work if he were shown to be exceptionally charming or interesting, but he is neither. Sharon Stone looks lovely, unlike the girl who plays her friend--they allowed the makeup artist to use way too much of everything in her kit. She looked like the real professional--but more of a street walker type. Anyhow,the story was interesting enough, but if the gigolo makes you giggle with his supposedly smooth moves then nothing else in the movie makes sense.
Oh, and Woody Allen chose not to act. I don't know why--he just did his Woody Allen schtick. Like a really bad Woody Allen impersonator. The whole thing was an incredibly sad ego stroke for Turturo. Truly painful to watch.",1410134400,3,1032,4.670329670329671

6378774,4,B00JLDTBCU,"Woody Allen does a decent job of acting his age in this delightful movie, but John Turturro may be too aloof leaving the viewer to wonder if his reticence reflects his mysterious inner self, or if he's just a cipher.  The rest of the cast is convincing, especially Vanessa Paradis whose quirky good looks and front teeth can mesmerize you.  (Americans aren't allowed to leave junior high with gaps that wide!)

This is an exclusively New York City version of Detroit's ""Hung,"" but with the emphasis on the consequences of intimate interpersonal relationships portrayed in a very sensitive and sophisticated style.  Highly Recommended.",1410048000,5,634,5.12621359223301

Laughable dialogue and situations, and social commentary.  New York from a New Yorker's heart, and romance are elements that make this movie endearing.  Many of the scenes are so well directed that it seems as though they were improvised as the shooting progressed.  I enjoyed the many implausible situations made real for the sake of the punch line, i.e. Murray (Woody's character) coaching a sandlot baseball team made up of his black kids and a group of Hassidic boys.  The gigolo story line has to be seen to be savored. John Turturro's character, who changes names to suit the client, nails this part in every encounter.

6378800,5,B00JLDTBCU,"I took a chance on this movie and just  expected something light and entertaining.  What I got was a deep look at life and how we often miss the tenderness and ability to connect with people.  Woody Allen is perfect as Murray.  This was certainly a woman's movie.  All of the women had something ""missing"" in their relationships.  An inability to connect with the man/men in their lives.  In reaching out for ""sex"" with a gigolo, they found truth and tenderness.  Who needs Johnny Depp or George Clooney when you have John Turturro!  I too fell in love with his character. This man actually feels what a woman needs and wants. A woman's man.  He is unassuming, responsive, very masculine yet soft,  listens, dances, speaks french, cooks, touches without expectations and is affectionate without sex.  Just being with Fioravante was healing and therapeutic - Hey guys, it wasn't about the sex for any of these women!  I started looking for my check book!  What a warm, funny, sensitive movie.  It's Christian in Fifty Shades of Gray without the bondage.  :)  Loved it.",1409702400,2,1067,4.774725274725275
6378801,3,B00JLDTBCU,The ending is abrupt without any real understanding as to why one female character suddenly ends what we are lead to believe is the beginning of a relationship.

6378802,5,B00JLDTBCU,"Actor John Turturro's directorial debut ""Romance and Cigarettes"" showed a lot of promise but to me smacked of watered down Coen Brothers.  Ironically this film bears the influence of Woody Allen, who is brilliant as Turturro's co-star here, but has enough originality to stand on its own.  Between the laugh out loud moments like Allen's character being dragged before an Orthodox Jewish tribunal or the Hasidic Jew played by Liev Schreiber who never heard of ""The Godfather"" there are moments of great poignance which give the film resonance.  For instance Turturro's Fioravante truly loves women and only takes up the world's oldest profession out of necessity and has real misgivings about what he is doing.  The film also demonstrates a side of New York that even Allen in his countless endeavors hadn't uncovered.  Additionally the film is rich in characterization none more than the turn by Johnny Depp's former girlfriend Vanessa Paradis as a young Jewish widow.  Paradis has a fragile beauty that belies an inner strength and to me her performance should be noted at Oscar time.  This film is a hit on all cylinders and I give it my unqualified recommendation.",1409443200,4,1168,5.020725388601036

She's a brilliant actress in this moving role. She made an impact. Turturro was a warm engaging straight man to Woody's funniness.  I wasn't crazy about how African Americans were depicted (very stereotypical boarding on insulting, which maybe was revenge for the criticism leveled at Woody for not having African Americans in his movies, even in vast cities like New York). The movie also was educational in showing a peep hole view into the Hasidic Jewish community/culture in NYC, which is never depicted. Good movie.",1409356800,3,660,5.111111111111111

6378902,3,B00JLDTBCU,"Fading Gigolo is set in New York and features Woody Allen, but it is not a Woody Allen movie. I mean, it is not directed by him. The off-beat romantic comedy is written and directed by John Turturro, who also stars.

The story goes like this. Sharon Stone is a sexy and wealthy dermatologist, who asks his patient Woody Allen to introduce to her (and her friend) a professional Don Juan. Allens character agrees, and asks his friend Fioravante played by John Turturro to be one. Turturros character eventually agrees. After all, they need money. To their (and our) great surprise, their new business is a success.

The film takes another unexpected turn when Avigal (Vanessa Paradis), lonely widow of a rabbi, enters the story. And a neighborhood patrol officer Dovi (Liev Schreiber) seems attracted to Avigal. Without revealing much, I can say that the rest of the film is about human relationships.

The premise is preposterous, but somehow the film works to some extent. The best part of the film is the chemistry between Turturro and Allen, with their natural and funny dialogue that easily makes them convincing as long-standing friends. Also, Sharon Stone is very good, as a very attractive and mysterious doctor.

Unfortunately the film itself is pretty uneven, with the disjointed second half which is simply disappointing. My reaction to the ending was something like Is that all? Fading Gigolo is a gentle and lighthearted comedy drama, but lacks something that would make us really care all these lonely people.",1408060800,,1522,4.980314960629921

6378908,4,B00JLDTBCU,"""If a man can't get a woman out of his guts, his heart, it means something."" Fioravante (Turturro) is best friends with Murray (Allen). Murray tells him he is not doing well financially but has a plan to make more money they they thought possible. What starts off as a way to make some fast cash for the both of them becomes dangerous physically, mentally and emotionally for everyone involved. I have never been a big Woody Allen fan but I have found myself liking the last few of his movies. While this isn't a Woody Allen movie per-se it has the definite feel of one and he is actually very funny in this and I did enjoy it. John Turturro wrote and directed this but gave the best parts to everyone else. Allen steals the movie but Liev Schreiber does a pretty good job as well. On its face the idea of the movie is about being a Gigolo but really that is not what the movie is about. This is about so much more then that and the main aspects of the movie are love and finding yourself. Overall, Woody Allen fans will love this since it does have a very Woody feel to it. I did really enjoy it more then I was expecting to. I give this a high B.",1407369600,2,1148,4.129464285714286
6378909,5,B00JLDTBCU,"For me, seeing Fading Gigolo was yet another lesson re: get past the prison of simplistic thinking & past experiences, remain open and CHECK IT OUT.

Sorry to say, Ive never been a Woody fan.  Ive always found his neurotic, self-abrogating screen persona numbing and necrotic.  I also never paid particular attention to John Turturro, forget, never found him especially attractive.

I also caught some early comments saying, beautiful females paying for sex?  Seriously?  Credibility defying male fantasy.  But, I think, perhaps something far richer than that.

This film knocked me out, made contact with my subjective core, and reiterated my personal experience .  Its reality, its depth, its sweet humor, its emotion were entirely unexpected.  I was transported.

I cant recall a recent screenplay this original, this of a piece, this illuminating.  Next, Ive certainly never seen Woody Allen as a whimsical, CHARMING, even endearing presence.  But there he was, manifesting all three.  How happy making!

For all the explicit coupling depicted in films, for me, its mostly been anti erotic.  Why?  Because what is at the heart of the stunning  crescendo of  increasingly mindless merging that is sexual, is each persons ability to be fully present, open and initially, focused on The Other until boundaries between the partners cease to exist.  In both genders, polar opposite of  pervading, static caricatures of hot.
Seeing, experiencing this film.all that was gloriously reiterated.

Finding Turturro increasingly erotically appealing was a surprise.  His face, the juxtaposition of his features, are not the stuff of conventionally handsome, after all, not to mention he is pushing 60.

Thing is..it was all moot.  Turturro is tall with a good, fit but natural (not resistance work ripped armor) body..but most important, he is self-contained, taciturn, and intensely focused and present/responsive every second, making full contact, never a false or insensitive gesture or move..be it with a given woman, or while meticulously, lovingly potting a phalenopsis in the flower shop he works in.making a stunning, spare Japanese flower arrangement..cooking a kosher fish dinner for the breathtaking orthodox Jewish widow he becomes increasingly captivated by.

Those capacities, be they in a man or a woman, comprise the distillation, the amalgam of what sexy truly is.  Clearly, Mr. Turturro knows it: he wrote the screenplay and directed the thing, after all.

Then, we have the contrast between two females, both near caricatures of a species of one dimensional sexiness: Sharon Stone (do the math), and the luscious Sofia Vergara.  Ms. Stones character hires a lover to get back at a rich husband she clearly despises, is at least is portrayed with some underlying vulnerability. Her friend, Ms. Vergaras character, is depicted as overtly, aggressively sexual as per her usual persona. We have yet to see Ms. Vergara manifest depth or nuance, and this may well be where she is convinced her bread is buttered.

But I will say, the scene where Mr. Turturro first goes to see Ms Vergara and they dance, is pretty special.

Juxtaposed to these two women, we have the beautiful orthodox Jewish widow who connects, is fully present, emotionally whole and with no guile, played by Vanessa Paradis, the French model, singer, actress who was Johnny Depps significant other for a decade and is the mother of his two kids.  Ms. Paradis with her winsome gap toothed smile and unadorned delicate beauty could not have been a more perfect choice.

It is naturally she who Mr. Turturros character falls in love with, making it (briefly) impossible for him to perform with his other clients.
This film is filled with sweet, sophisticated humor, including the affectionate whimsy in its depiction of the Brooklyn community of orthodox Jews.  Its kind, loving.  Its just plain delightful.

For me, the only false note, the only part which didn't work (at all), was that the beautiful widow ends up with the orthodox community watch guy played by Liev Schreiber, and not with Mr. Turturro.  I have to assume, because logically, for the widow of an Orthodox Rabbi to end up with not simply a not observant Jew but a gentile, was just not a viable option.

But the Schreiber character was boorish, heavy handed, inelegant, dense, unerotically aggressiveno way someone Avrigal could have had chemistry with, forget come to feel love for.  But. despite she was all about comporting with orthodox lawincluding the paternalistic element that the wife belongs to the husband and modesty dictates she is precluded from showing her hair outside the home to strangers, especially strange mennot unlike the tenets of the Muslim religion.

So, who she ended up with, for me, was a seriously compromising element in light of the quality of rest of the work, though, Avigal, as she reclaims health and entitlement via her interaction with Mr. Turturro..has a romantic scene with him in which she allows him to gently remove her wig.an event she shares happily, even proudly and with no shame, before the tribunal of Rabbis she is brought before along with Woody.

In life, Mr. Turturro remains married to the woman he met when they were both at Yale drama school 25 years ago.  She is Jewish, but not observant.  They are both self-created, discerning gourmets. He was born in Brooklyn and they and their two sons live there now in a brownstone.

Some reviewers found the music tracks chosen by Mr. Turturro neo Woody.  While he chose some jazzy sax centered tracks, his choices were more diverse in genre than those Woody (who is also a jazz musician of some note) usually chooses for a given film.  Each and every track is a brilliant choice and neo nothing: Mr. Turturros mother was an amateur jazz singer.

Then, there are the kids in the movie!  The 4 precocious offspring of the woman Woody lives with: a lovely, no nonsense African American, as usual, far younger than he..and the six (observant Jews often feel impelled to produce lots of offspring, I think, because of Jewish history) also delightfully precocious offspring of the gorgeous orthodox window.

I urge everyone to recognize conditioned conceptions you may be harboring of what is erotic, via years of movie and TV portrayals (forget porn); right click on all of them, send them to the recycle bin and hit empty.

Then, go see this movie.",1407196800,7,6385,5.051575931232092
6378910,3,B00JLDTBCU,"Millions swooned over Richard Gere in 1980's steamy AMERICAN GIGOLO, and now, nearly forty years later, it's looking like ""macho grande"" all over again! John Turturro, who previously set hearts aflutter in BARTON FINK and ANIMALS WITH THE TOLLKEEPER, steps into Gere's sizable shoes and soon has women fawning at his feet.  Woody Allen shines here as Turturro's friend and erstwhile pimp; together the men have an easy chemistry that makes you want to see more of them.

The man-for-hire scenario is not new to the movies, of course;  over the years, Hollywood has given us several memorable examples of men plying their trade in the world's oldest profession, from Jon Voigt in MIDNIGHT COWBOY to the aforementioned Gere and, most recently, Rob Schneider.
