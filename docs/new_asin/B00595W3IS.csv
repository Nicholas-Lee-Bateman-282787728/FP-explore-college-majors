4620223,3,B00595W3IS,"Some parts of it were great, but others were awkward & unsettling. To me, the ending was horrible, since the ""bad guy"" setting the fires won.",1446336000,,141,4.461538461538462
4620224,3,B00595W3IS,"This flick was kind of ok.  But if you have something else to do instead, like breathe or move your bowels, you should go ahead and do that, rather than spending to much time or money on this...kind of ok thing.",1442620800,2,211,4.146341463414634

4620227,2,B00595W3IS,"Whoever rated this with 3.5 stars was being overly generous in my opinion! The acting was terrible and the plot was contrived. It has a few good moments but all in all unless you're a real fan of bad B movies I'd give this one a pass. On the other hand if you're really bored it might be worth a look as a rental, don't buy you'll regret it! Oh yeah, and somebody please explain to me why in what is supposed to be a creature feature you have to have the designated villain, that gets really old!",1369785600,5,496,4.071428571428571
4620228,2,B00595W3IS,"I am a huge fan of cheesy bigfoot movies, but this is above and beyond THE worst one I have ever seen. The acting is awful. The bigfoot did look pretty good, so I'll give them props for that. But beyond that? Here Bigfoot = bigflop! I'd rather go to the dentist than have to watch this stink hole a second time! Avoid at all costs! You'll waste your money and a couple hours of your life that you could put to better use, like counting cracks in the sidewalk or standing in line at the DMV. The 5 star review must have been written by someone in this horrible turd!

*After suffering through ASSAULT OF THE SASQUATCH I had to take a second look at this review. I still don't like this movie, but it isn't THE worst bigfoot movie out there -- ASSAULT is (probably in a tie with SyFy's recent BIGFOOT turd!). So, I've upped the stars by one and will admit that this is not the worst bigfoot movie. I'd rather watch this than ASSAULT or BIGFOOT again. So, less of a turd by default, I guess...?",1317859200,15,991,4.18848167539267
4620229,5,B00595W3IS,"Great acting and effects for its budget, wonderful body count including a firefighter massacre.  Can't say enough good things about it.  Totally check it out if you like Bigfoot horror.

4620231,2,B00595W3IS,"Nothing much to say about this movie other than its a low budget Big Foot horror movie with lousy effects, bad acting and terrible ending.

4620242,1,B00595W3IS,"such a great concept!  however there is zero delivery on any aspect. all natural lighting, the movie is based in the 70's but all the men shave their body hair. pretty sure one of them had a cellphone in his back pocket. no actors at all.  SPOILER ALERT : literally the first 40min of this movie is a bunch of nekked hunks traversing an obviously well kept state park while someone dressed in a crappy bigfoot stalks them like a pervert in broad day light, emitting odd screeches grunts and growls.  than eric roberts says something. than there is about a straight half hour of these young men undressing to soft rock music and flexing in front of mirrors with air-rilfes, this part climaxes with one of the men masturbating in the shower.  than eric roberts says something about DB Cooper.  than the movie closes with the bigfoot stalking and killing these ""armed"" men one by one.  enter DB Cooper...but it doesnt matter cuz this is rubbish. i assume the target audience for this is young horny women or old horny gay men.  but i really don't think either would get any pleasure from viewing this.",1471046400,,1098,4.571428571428571

4620266,3,B00595W3IS,"Oh, this wasn't that bad. Certainly wasn't great, but the type of movie that doesn't require you to fire too many of your precious synapses and you really don't have to pay much attention to figure out what is going on. Someone starts a fire, bigfoot gets angry. There's your story. Decent acting, good camerawork, silly dialogue and a really good bigfoot. Watch it while you are folding clothes or paying your bills.",1453248000,15,417,4.726027397260274
4620267,3,B00595W3IS,"The best thing I can say about this movie was all of the familiar faces.  Lots of names in this movie.  But there was no  resolution at the end and that really bothered me.  I know there had to be more than one (monster, beast, bear-like thing) because it was everywhere.  The story tellers had an opportunity to make it something more, but didn't and that's a shame.  It would have been nicer to have a little more fleshing out of some characters, especially without them yelling what and who they were to one another.  Anyway, except for the ending, I thought it was a nice little movie.",1449964800,4,589,4.398148148148148
4620268,3,B00595W3IS,Ok I am going to rate this for what it is and that is a low budget movie. But that being said they didn't put millions into this and it was better than some. some parts were a little clunky but over all it was worth the time and a good watch.,1449619200,4,242,3.673076923076923

8462701,4,B00595W3IS,"I liked it because it's a ""B"" rated movie. It delivers a good story line with o.k. acting. You can't rate this B movie in a class with the high end box office buster movies of Hollywood.",1527465600,,186,4.054054054054054
8462702,3,B00595W3IS,"Just finished watching this. Most of the dialog and acting was hokey, but the creature was pretty good. Movie editing not so great. Ending not as good as it could have been. But if you like creature movies, it is a fun one to watch at least one time.",1517529600,,250,4.122448979591836
8462703,1,B00595W3IS,The movie seems to be more about how great rednecks are and that everyone else is stupid or wimpy. Its like an ad for deplorables. No thanks.,1509235200,,141,4.2592592592592595
8462704,5,B00595W3IS,"I'm biased, but I love this movie.  Sure, it's not a big budget extravaganza, but it's a fun Bigfoot film and those can be hard to find.  I like to call it a ""family friendly"" horror film because it has no swearing or nudity.  Sure there is a little blood and whatnot, but that's to be expected.",1504396800,,295,4.140350877192983
8462705,4,B00595W3IS,"I've seen this a couple of times, and I have to say, that I really enjoyed watching it. Some of the review talk about this movie being boring, or low budget, and what-not, but honestly, I don't know what they were watching because this was anything but boring, and while it was low budget, it is one of the better low budgets of its genre. I don't expect a movie like this to be Academy Award material, I just expect it to keep me watching and have enough dramatic and scary moments to keep me interested.  It held my interest throughout the movie, and there were some parts that had a bit of wasted dialogue, but I guess that was supposed to give us some of the backgrounds on the characters and to see their relationships. Having the sheriff as the one wanting to keep the park open because he didn't want the bad publicity to drive away business was a bit different since it usually is the town mayor or someone else over him who plays that scene, but as it turns out that there was still more to come in that department, I guess they had to play it that way. The over enthusiastic bigfoot fanatic and the phony bigfoot hunter who eventually became a real bigfoot hunter, were the source of many comedic scenes, even to the point where the fanatic even got a kick out of filming his own death, I was laughing at what I guess would have normally been a pretty tragic scene. They did pretty good with the creature, too, because most of his scenes we only got a fleeting glance of him, which added to the tense scenes where one doesn't know for sure what's going to happen.
If you're looking for something to watch that doesn't require a whole lot of brain power, and includes a bit of humor during some really serious moments, sit down a while and check this movie out",1504396800,2,1769,4.328313253012048
8462706,4,B00595W3IS,"There is only one reason for the four stars.  While the movie, overall, had the feel of a made for tv movie, the depiction of the creature moving through the wooded area was fantastic.  There are only a few brief glimpses of the big foot on the move, but the way it moved going from bipedal locomotion to all fours was eerie and realistic.  Watch for a brief flash of the big foot running in the brush along side the truck as it races ahead.  It's easy to miss but eerily similar to witness reports of the speed and agility of the creature in their alleged encounters.  I will watch it again just for those couple of scenes",1504137600,,623,4.245762711864407

8462709,3,B00595W3IS,"for sure, with a cast of characters who seem slightly similar to the excellent Sasquatch Mountain movie. Not many BF movies have this quality. Enjoy!",1490486400,2,149,5.0
8462710,1,B00595W3IS,"How anybody can rate this higher than a 1 star is beyond me. I'd rather watch snow melt or grass grow, it would be more exciting! The acting is terrible, the big foot character looked like something you'd see in a cheap Halloween play. The story line has worn out long ago! I can only say it's pathetic!",1486771200,3,303,4.241379310344827
