8055622,3,B000854PBW,"If you are one of the many people who think S Club 7 are just a bunch of not singers trained how to lip-synch on a live show, I'd sadly say you're right.

The CD ""Sunshine"" is enhanced with Never Had A Dream Come True, taken from this concert, take it and see it. Realize that the track is exactly the same as the song in the CD; not even a key different. They lip-sych all the time the concert lasts. Even the slow songs, like Two In A Million and Natural...and don't talk about Reach and Bring It All Back.

It's a good concert, though, very simple, but good stage, the audience was great, and they really know how to entertain, waving hands all over the place and dancing all the time, but their lip-synching was the only problem.

However, I don't regret I saw this once, because I didn't buy it. If they would have at least sang with the CD track as background music it would have been better. But that's the only reason I give this 3 stars, because in a live show, to be really singing is ESSENTIAL.",1153353600,,1005,4.196891191709844
