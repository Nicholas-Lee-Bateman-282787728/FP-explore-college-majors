4834990,5,B005MQ58AE,"I love three of the four movies! 'All I want for Christmas' was annoying to me and I didn't finish watching it. The other 3 are keepers! I love them. Its well worth the price and nice to have collections available. 'Surviving Christmas' was new to me this year and is now a favorite! Too funny! 'Trading Places' has been a long time favorite, and 'Last Holiday' is a newer favorite, but a movie I watch about every other month, year round!!!",1360800000,,441,4.390243902439025
