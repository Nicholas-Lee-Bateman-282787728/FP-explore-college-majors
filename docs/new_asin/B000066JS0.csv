8451805,5,B000066JS0,"This is another great ""Arthur"" DVD to add to your collection.  My Children love watching Arthur including my teenager.

The three episodes are:
Arthur Goes to Camp
The Shore Thing
The Short Quick Summer",1300147200,3,202,4.911764705882353
8451806,1,B000066JS0,"We thought this would be a cute DVD to watch with our 3&4 yr. old.  This was clearly designed for MUCH older children.  It was filled with negativity and bad behavior.  My kids couldn't believe someone would want to be like ""Arthur"".  In this DVD at least, Arthur was a jerk so we canceled movie night for the first time.",1174003200,3,321,4.3
