8344749,2,B001URA60G,"A washed up bodyguard is hired to protect the man who ruined his life--the professional assassin who murdered his last client and his partner.  This has an agreeably loopy premise and two strong actors in the leads, but the movie isn't really very good.  The action scenes in Body Armour are never exciting and the script is pretty lazy, never giving the actors much to work with and providing no twists that aren't completely predictable.  This is watchable if you have nothing better to do but it's a time waster at best.",1408924800,,523,4.663043478260869

8344754,1,B001URA60G,"this movie was garbage, i was very disapointed. i thought because of the plot and the actors it would be a decent movie,BOY WAS I WRONG! i love chazz palminteri as an actor but in this movie he sucked. i even like til schweiger but he stinked also, as a matter of fact all the acting in this movie did! ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE AT ALL!!! DO NOT EVEN RENT THIS CRAP!",1270944000,2,379,4.135135135135135

8344756,2,B001URA60G,"From the artificial dialogue, to the amateurish acting, to the clumsy editing, illogical plot line, and missing scenes, this movie (starring one of my favorite actors of all time, Chazz P.) contains almost nothing worth watching .  Character development is non-existent, machoism rules supreme, and little makes real-world sense in this rather silly film.  (Dang, but I hate to say that about a Chazz P. movie!)

Very, very avoidable is ""Body Armour.""",1256428800,12,451,5.236111111111111
8344757,2,B001URA60G,"This movie was very thin on plot, highly predictable, full of cliches and very weak dialog. Full of action though the fight choreography could have been so much better, I don't think I've seen much worse. Overall, I'd say pass on this one.",1249516800,12,239,4.5813953488372094
8344758,5,B001URA60G,"I was surprised by the amount of action and style this relatively unknown film has, Chazz Palminteri is simply fantastic as a (spoiler!) dying assassin who has come out of hiding to reconcile with his long lost daughter. Til Schweiger is a real bad*ss as a retired bodyguard who must protect him from the criminal bosses who are hunting him. It's an emotional portrayal of a unsympathetic evil man by Chazz, and it works. Some of the supporting characters are real oddballs, but that just adds to the fun. The locations in Barcelona are beautiful.",1245196800,7,547,4.768421052631579
