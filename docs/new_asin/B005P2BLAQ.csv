8482294,5,B005P2BLAQ,"""La prima cosa bella"" (""The First Beautiful Thing"" from 2010), was directed by acclaimed director Paolo Virzi. In ""La prima cosa bella"" an estranged son is reunited with his dying mother, where he is trying to come to terms with his past and accept his mother for whom she is. This was a bittersweet and touching comedy-drama. It is very symbolic of the Italian people's longing for an era of supposed simpler times (looking to the past), when the nuclear family was still unchanged, more or less. The character of 'Anna Nigiotti' was especially important in this respect. Her cheerful outlook on life (she taught the children popular songs), and stubborn willingness to overcome setbacks on her own terms, including using her beauty and feminine charm to provide for her two kids, was emblematic (simultaneously) of the traditionally-bound mother and of the modern independent-minded woman of today (Anna Magnani and Sophia Loren: were cinematic embodiments of this very Mythic symbol). 'Anna' did her best to shield her children from the ugly truth and unpleasantness of real-life. This created some bitterness and resentment in her son 'Bruno'. The other characters were also very interesting and amusing too, especially 'Valeria's' husband---who talked incessantly on everything and nothing (this is a prominent feature in Paolo Virzi's films, see the equally excellent---""Caterina va in citta"" from 2003).

The film had sumptuous cinematography, and recreated the Italy of the early 70's (in Livorno), with nostalgic abandonment. The cast were all excellent: Valerio Mastandrea 'Bruno', Micaela Ramazotti 'Anna' (1971 - 1981), the wonderful Stefania Sandrelli 'Anna' (the present), Claudia Pandolfi 'Valeria', Sergio Albelli 'Mario', Marco Messeri 'Il Nesi', Fabrizia Sacchi 'Sandra', Aurora Frasca 'Valeria' (child), Giacomo Bibbiani 'Bruno' (child), Isabella Cecchi 'Zia Leda', etc., etc. This is a touching and heartwarming look-back at the lost innocence of childhood, and of the things we can never replace: like our ever-enigmatic---Mother. I highly recommend it.

The DVD picture and sound quality by Tartan Palisades was excellent. NTSC, Italian (English subtitles), NR 122 mins.
