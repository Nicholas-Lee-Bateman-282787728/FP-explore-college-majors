5929720,4,B00EOAIK86,"I watched this recently, and while it was interesting, as I am an English teacher who teaches Catcher in the Rye, I found that some of the parts could have been edited.
For example, it starts out with a huge segment on the murders/shootings committed in the name of Catcher in the Rye; it doesn't go into enough detail for my taste.
Plus, I found a few of the interviews with the women who he dated, loved, were placed a bit too frequently, and really didn't offer the sorts of insight I would have liked.
I did however find the parts on his life in World War II of interest, and helpful to connect to the novel and its themes.
Personally, I would recommend it to teachers who could fast forward through the slower parts.
A student in my class watched it on Netflix, and stated that it helped him to understand the novel, Catcher in the Rye much better, so from that viewpoint, it is worthwhile. I would give it 31/2, but it wouldn't allow me to.",1382313600,,946,4.320224719101123
5929721,3,B00EOAIK86,"I've read enough biographies of artists (James Joyce, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot to name a few) to know that artists can be right bastards when relating to others who do not possess their gifts.  Salinger is a case in point.  I must admit that outside of a few of his collected short stories I am not an admirer of his work,  though I understand why others might enjoy reading it.

  One wants to take revelations in these types of documentaries with a pound of salt, but certainly there is ample evidence that J.D. was emotionally scarred by his terrible experiences in Europe during World War II, and this experience may certainly account for some of his animosity he felt towards most of humanity.  He treated the women (and at least one of his two children) with contempt and silence, and the women he seemed most attracted to were young (indeed, a bit too young - there is a whiff of the chicken hawk in old JD) and innocent, the better to treat as willing acolytes who would make few demands on the man's time and be much more patient than women with a bit of experience under their belts.

  I don't know what others will come away with after watching this, but the man comes across to me as a petulent, bitter, misanthropic mysogynist who used the people in his life as though they were fictional characters of his own creation.  I think it ironic that so many people were so very interested in meeting a man who, when met with, proved such a bitter disappointment.  Those who say he lived a tragic life miss the mark.  He lived exactly the life he wanted to live.  Save the sympathy for those who suffered from his self-centeredness.",1381622400,11,1638,4.489864864864865
5929722,4,B00EOAIK86,"Yes, this documentary could have been better. I tired very quickly of the dramatic music. This is not a Michael Bay film. There are no Transformers or gun fights in this movie. This is not a dramatization of the end times.

Some of the editing was also annoying.. going back and forth in time, rapidly transitioning between segments of two interviews of the same woman.. I found that a bit jarring.

However, I still found this documentary quite worth watching. Even though I have read ""Catcher in the Rye"" several times, I've never read anything about Salinger. I saw the preview for this film, waited for it to get to a theater near where I live, but it never happened. I was able to watch it online.

From this film, I learned a great deal about this intriguing, somewhat reclusive, tragic man. Perhaps folks who have read books about Salinger already know everything that is presented in this doc. If you've read a lot about Salinger, then maybe you'll want to skip this. But, if you are like me, and have felt blessed to read ""Catcher in the Rye,"" but have learned almost nothing about its author, I think you will be able to get past the bothersome and overly dramatic music, and the somewhat poor editing. If that's the case, you'll appreciate this film, and learn a lot from watching it.",1381536000,5,1295,4.573275862068965
5929723,1,B00EOAIK86,"In the book we were bombarded with the false omniscience of the two authors, but at least we could supply our own music in the background (mine was more keystone cops as I read on and on and on), instead of the thumping, overbearing, pretentious music that is in the film!  And reading the book we might imagine our own version of Salinger, and those around him- but in the film we get the absolute CHEESIEST of reenactments, and bad acting, one after the other!  My wife and I were the only two people in the theater where we saw it, but even so it felt claustrophobic and airless.  We walked outside and stood there, stunned, for a few minutes, by just HOW bad a documentary can be.  My wife said it as generously as it can be said, I think: ""a lot of nothing that only clouds the subject matter more, and does so in as annoying a manner as any film I've ever seen!""

If we could give ZERO stars for the film, we would.",1380153600,9,921,4.1807909604519775
5929724,1,B00EOAIK86,"I have to say that I loved some of Salinger's other writing more than Catcher (especially the Glass stories- much like Steven Colbert, apparently!), but I was still very much looking forward to this film.

I learned absolutely nothing new from it, however.  It was just a cut and paste of various other things already published, with a paltry few unexceptional exceptions.  And the ATTITUDE of the filmmakers was like nothing I've ever witnessed (been subjected to) before.  The wild assertions they come out with total authority about, the music that betrays the filmmakers big-time-Hollywood back ground, worthy of a Spielberg Sci-Fi film, or, as one reviewer stated, the world coming to an end!  To call this over hyped piece of trash an exercise in how to con the viewer into shelling over his money would be too kind.  It drags on and on, repeating the same footage over and over again- and has someone who looks like a porn actor playing Salinger (who knew he was so studly?!), and acting (badly) without words.

Can I PLEASE have my money back?",1379289600,12,1051,4.773480662983426
5929725,5,B00EOAIK86,"""Salinger"" is a documentary film which examines aspects of the life and career of author J.D. Salinger.

The narrative moves back-and-forth in time quite smoothly between decades in Salinger's life, which contributes to a dynamic story flow by concentrating on key events to try and unravel some of Salinger's unique ways and motives towards his life and work as a writer.

A collection of people comment on Salinger which includes family, friends, lovers, professional colleagues and admirers of his work, and whilst Salinger is impossible to fully define these people do shed much light on a private, complex and very gifted man.

The documentary takes the viewer to Salinger's rural home with the opportunity to look from afar and this is somewhat in keeping with the distance Salinger appeared to like to keep, although probably much closer than what he would have permitted in life. Therefore the viewer is treated to a closer experience and is left salivating at the thought of his unpublished work and the day it might appear in print.

Salinger's stories contain himself in a universe of fiction and his posthumous works subsequently present an opportunity to further unearth some glimpses of his thoughts and reasons towards the world around him.

8607341,2,B00EOAIK86,"As a huge fan of Salinger, I was so excited for this doc.  But it really did nothing more than ""here's a celebrity... and here's that celebrity talking about how great Salinger was.""  And that's it.",1441324800,,198,4.472222222222222

8607343,4,B00EOAIK86,"J.D. Salinger wrote one of the greatest and most influential books of his time. And it haunted him until his death.

Here's the scoop. This documentary examines the life and career of a writer who's experiences during WWII haunted him to a point where he needed to exorcize those demons through his writing. He did so but at great cost to himself.

There is nothing new here in the format. They introduce you to the man and take you through his life with spots filled in by friends, family and people who are writing various biographies about him. On the good side is they have a lot of information on him and the talking heads do a good job of fleshing him out. There is an amazing amount of film footage and photographs of him and the people in his life so not much is left to the imagination. I liked the way they took me through the early days of his short story writing an his subsequent difficulties in getting published in New Yorker magazine. But it really hit home when he publishes his first novel ""Catcher in the Rye."" So much happens after that that it boggles the mind.

He was a bit weird to begin with but experiencing immediate and intense fame seemed to distill those things and bring them to the surface. It was a total surprise to him (and I suppose to others) that ""Catcher in the Rye"" would speak so personally to such a huge number in our society. They do spend a chapter on how that book was the favorite read of assassins. Some thought there were hidden meanings written into the book trigger those nut cases into action. But after seeing this documentary one realizes no. Salinger merely tapped into some deep troubling waters haunting our society.

This is a heck of a documentary. If you ever read his master work, see this and see how it all came into being.",1402358400,,1786,4.419452887537994
8607344,4,B00EOAIK86,"""Salinger"" (2013 release; 120 min.) is the documentary by Shane Salerno that is a companion piece to his book of the same name (or is it the other way around?). The documentary is structured chronologically, and the first hour spends considerable time and effort on Salinger's time in the army during WWII, including his active participation during D-Day and the subsequent march onto Germany. At one point, the screen goes blank, to make the following dramatic announcement: ""This is the only footage of JD Salinger during WWII. It has never been seen before"" (it is an 8mm showing Salinger talking with Parisians after the liberation of Paris). I had no idea that Salinger in 1945 married a German woman who was a member of the Nazi party (Salinger sought to annul the marriage only 1 months later). A lot of attention is obviously given to the publication of ""Catcher In the Rye"", and plenty of celebrities have something to say about it (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ed Norton, Martin Sheen, Tom Wolfe, just to name those).

Couple of further comments: first and foremost, this documentary was not received very well upon its release, deemed 'not worthy' of Salinger by the so-called critics. Now having seen this myself, I honestly don't know what the problem is. I'm guessing that, like most people (if not the overwhelming majority), I knew only 2 things of Salinger: that he wrote Catcher in the Rye, and that he was a recluse. This documentary does a nice job filling in the blanks for the casual Salinger fan like myself. Second, Salinger's overall relationship with women is very nuanced, and again I thought the documentary tackled that quite well without becoming  sensationalist, Check out the interview with Jean Miller, who in 1950 was 14 when she struck up a friendship ('purely platonic', she adds) with Salinger, then 31. They would remain in contact for many years to come. The interview with Joyce Maynard, who moves in with Salinger in 1972, is equally revealing. At some point, someone asks Salinger what his future writing plans are, and he confidently replies ""I am up to my ears in unwritten words"". Nice way of putting it. Even though Salinger wrote many things before and after Catcher, that book towers over everything, including the author.

This documentary briefly played last Fall at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati but it left after only 1 or  2 weeks, before I had a chance to see it. I finally saw this on PBS just a few days ago, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I can only imagine that if you are a Salinger expert, you will find plenty to complain about if you look hard enough, but for me, a casual fan at best, this documentary proved to be enlightening and entertaining. What more can you ask for? For casual fans, ""Salinger"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1390694400,2,2793,4.8004158004158
8607345,5,B00EOAIK86,"This is an absorbing documentary examining the life and work of literature's most reclusive superstar. Yes, it has movie stars...but they provide brief, incisive comments reflecting how Salinger's writings inspired and shaped their own work. Yes, it has dramatic music...which only underscores the drama of an extremely sensitive, war-torn, love-lorn life. Yes, it depicts Salinger's attempts at attracting young women...but does so with explanatory insights into this behavior, including the shocking betrayal by his first real young love, which he never forgot. The documentary provides many rare photos, film clips, and unknown stories of the subject (especially his harrowing experiences during the war), and daring, in-depth interviews with those who knew him best and those who were shunned by him. I was never bored for a minute watching this absorbing and surprisingly moving film, and found at the end that I now understand Salinger's life and work (and even sympathize with his decision to disappear from the world) far more than I ever have before.",1390348800,4,1059,5.424242424242424

8607347,5,B00EOAIK86,"Salinger is an intense and educational look into the reclusive life of J.D. Salinger. Salinger is known for his novel Catcher in the Rye that continues to influence our culture greatly to this day. He took rejection after rejection to get his works published in the New York Times, until he finally had his breakthrough. But becoming an overnight success doesnt suit everyone.

I think this film is incredible. Salinger was such an influential writer, but was so much of a perfectionist in everything that he did so if anyone disagreed with his stories he would discontinue speaking to them. He had his own personal issues that he worked out through his writing, so when he published his stories he was really putting the most hidden parts of himself out there. When he went away to war it really changed them. The amount of death that he saw was enough to make any sane person crazy, but Salinger was already a little strange to begin with. I love the way this documentary conducts interviews with many different people that knew Salinger throughout the years. It was interesting to see how so many of them hadnt had any contact with him for decades because he would end relationships with everyone so quickly and abruptly. He even replaced his own family with The Glass Family which is a series of books he wrote. This film shows footage and pictures of his life, and even includes never before seen images of Salinger in WWII which is very interesting to see. The soundtrack in this film is wonderful because it makes certain scenes so much more intense. There are fantastic cuts and edits done to enhance the emotions and overall this is a very well done film.

I think it was very interesting to see how Salinger had an obsession with innocence. He had many different girlfriends and wives, all of them ranging from 16-20. He always put his work before anything else which had a strain on his affairs, so he never kept the same love interest for long. He was also very conflicted on his works. He wanted so badly to share them, but in doing so he risked putting his inner turmoil out there. When he published Catcher in the Rye he thought that here he was, having these thoughts and writing these things that no one had ever imagined before. But when the entire nation had the response oh my God, someone finally understands how I feel! Salinger was very shocked. He referred to his characters as if they were real people and he lived more in his stories than he did in reality. This documentary has inspired me to read Catcher in the Rye and many of his other works because he seems like such a profound yet tortured writer. I am very pleased to know that after his passing, he left his wishes for his writings. In 2015 his Glass Family books will begin to be released, along with some of his other hidden works.

This film is really a conversation about this mans life, so I think that needs to be taken into consideration when deciding whether or not this film is for you. It also has some very powerful and intense imagery from World War II which is definitely not something that everyone can handle. I would recommend this film for ages 16+ unless you are used to more mature topics and documentaries. Salinger is entertaining, heartfelt, intellectual and insightful to the hidden world of this American writer. Overall I give Salinger 5 out of 5 stars",1384732800,7,3362,4.590682196339435
8607348,1,B00EOAIK86,"The soundtrack saturates the interviews to distraction. A horrible mess of boring celebrities weeping over themselves. I love Salinger enough to leave him alone, and the idiots who participated in this mess should have done the same.",1383609600,4,233,5.324324324324325

This depiction of him did not show him in a positive light. Salinger was a private man by choice. I feel like the filmmakers tried to interpret parts of his life that they had little to no knowledge about. It is interesting to see how his career developed and how the people in his life reflect back on him, but this film is simply just ok.",1383177600,2,494,4.15625

Holden Caufield.  'Catcher In The Rye'

'Salinger' the documentary about J.D. Salinger is a surprise in several ways. The documentary is far too long, covering the same territory over and over. It does, however, give some insight into the life of Salinger and how he lived his life. Fir one  he was not a recluse. He became public when it suited him. His book, 'Catcher In The Rye' however became such an overnight success, selling 5 million copies, and still sells 250,000 copies a year.  Salinger was not prepared for the success nor the notoriety, and he wanted no part of it. He returned to New York when it suited him, and he traveled whenever he wanted.

The documentary covers his young life growing up, his time in the war, and how it affected him. His girlfriends, all much younger than him, and his marriages. Many acquaintances  are interviewed, two girlfriends, film stars, and assorted literary figures. They all give a report of a brilliant man who liked to write, but did not want the infamy. He retired to New Hampshire, and the townspeople covered for him. No one gave out his address, and no one got an interview that Mr. Salinger didn't want to give. Several surprises in the documentary for you.  All in all not worth two,plus hours,but entertaining in it's own way.
