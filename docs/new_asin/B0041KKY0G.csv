8412854,5,B0041KKY0G,"This is actually a DVD of the 1979 Final Four game between Indiana State and DePaul. Regardless, an excellent quality DVD of a very exciting game. Indiana State earns its place in the national championship game for the matchup the entire basketball world wanted to see. After watching this game though, I am left believing that DePaul would have made a better opponent for Michigan State. Either way, this was by far the best game of the Final Four.",1305158400,,449,4.69620253164557
