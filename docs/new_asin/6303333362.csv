625155,4,6303333362,THE SHOW IS GREAT AND ENTERTAINNING.TRIPLE H AS A SNOB WITH HIS SNOBBY THEME MUSIC THAT WAS A REAL SCHOCKING THING WHEN YOU WATCH THIS TAPE.,1017014400,,140,4.423076923076923
7843542,4,6303333362,"1-2-3 Kid VS Hakushi: A good way to start the show. The ending came out of nowhere but didn't take away from the whole match.

Triple H VS Bob Holly: A good match and the ending was great. Ah, WWF circa 1995, some of the dumbest gimmicks in the history of wrestling.

Smokin Gunns VS Blu Brothers: In 1995 tag team wrestling was dead in the WWF. That being said, this was a damn good match. It's scary to admit but I loved this match up.

Barry Horowitz VS Skip: I loved the story line of this match and Sunny is smoking hot. This was a fine little match up with Hakushi costing Skip the match and Horowitz winning again. Wow, I have to say again-what crappy gimmicks WWF had in 95.

Bertha Faye VS Alundra Blazye: I skipped it.

Kama VS Undertaker in a casket match: If you remember a Papa Shango VS Undertaker match from three years earlier, then this is basically the same match. I enjoyed the match overall.

Bret Hart VS Issac Yankem: I could really careless about this match, even though it was a Bret Hart match.

Shawn Michaels VS Razor Ramon in a ladder match: There is nothing to say about this match but awesome.

Diesel VS Mabel: Diesel nearly put WWF out of buisness with his title reign. Mabel is a decent worker, but I won't say he is among the elite. This being said, Mabel put on a great match and Diesel really sucked in this one. Mabel should have won the world title but that probably put WWF out of buisness. The ending was weak but it was not one of the worst main events in Summerslam history. WWF had alot of poor main events for Summerslam though.

The early matches are a good way to relive the days of WWF Superstars. The casket and ladder matches lived up to the hype for me. Hart-Yankem was stupid and pointless, the main event was good but Diesel really sucked as champion.",1237161600,,1803,4.294985250737463

HHH pinned Sparkplug Holly- this match did not make HHH under any circumstances.  It just got his finisher a big pop.  bad match  6/10

Barry Horowitz pinned Skip with the help of Hakushi- horrible match thats all i have to say  5/10

Undertaker defeated Kama in a casket match- very suprised this match had a lot of good wrestling and one bump  8.5/10

HBK defeated Razor Ramon for the IC title- very good match with some awsome bumps. I thought the athletisim in the 2nd match was better than WM 10  10/10

Bret Hart defeated Issac Yankem by DQ- this match had a couple boring spots not much wrestling and a horrible ending.

  7/10

Diesel pinned Mable for the WWE title- by far the worst main event in history of the WWE.  Diesel wins by a clothsline.  5/10

1-2-3 Kid V. Hakushi

very good opener with a cool spot at the end. Hakushi wins. ***1/4

Bob ""Spark Plugg"" Holly V. Hunter Hearst Helmsley

short match with Triple H's pedigree getting a face pop. cool. *3/4

Smoking Gunns V. Blu Brothers

This match shouldn't even be on the card...oh well, it looks like I have to deal with it. Gunns win. *3/4

Barry Horowitz V. Skip

Good storyline with a ok match. Horowitz wins! Who cares. I don't. **1/2

WWF Women's Championship:

Alundra Blayze (Champion) V. Bertha Faye

horrible women's match. Faye wins the title. *

Casket Match:

Undertaker V. Kama

alot better than I thought. Taker of course wins..but I was shocked that this match was better than I thought...that's not really saying much. **1/2

Bret Hart V. Tssac Yankem, D.D.S.

Look...It's Kane...with very bad teeth. Very good match that had good in ring work. Bret wins by DQ because of Lawler...should of had a clean finish. ***1/2

Ladder Match for the WWF Intercontinetal Championship:

Shawn Michaels (Champion) V. Razor Ramon

I wasn't expecting this to be better than the first one and is wasn't by any means. Shawn & Razor were told that they couldn't hit each other with the Ladder because Vince was trying to form a relationship with Disney and didn't want any more violent that he already had. WHAT??? Then whats the whole point if you can't use it was a weapon. That really took away from the match. The match was good, but I think it is very overratted. The ending was screwed up not once, but twice and i just really didn't think it was all that special. Good effort, but the no weapon thing really hurt it. Shawn retains in a very good, very overratted ladder match. ***1/2

WWF Championship:

Diesel (Champion) V. Mabel

Lets see, you have Bret Hart in midcard feuds the whole year and Diesel faces Mabel in the main event of the second biggest show of the year!!! God help us. This match sucked like Diesel's title reign. Diesel retains (which is the only semi good that comes news out of this whole mess)1/2*

Overall, a good show that is underrated but has a very overrated ladder match that the show is remembered for. Do you follow me?",1138752000,2,2247,4.6828644501278776

Undertaker vs Kama
Good match but had some slow spots as well.

Bret Hart vs Issac Yankem
Good Match. The Legendary Bret Hart showed some good moves in this match. I also thought Yankem was pretty impressive as well.
It had a horrible ending though.
8/10

Ladder Match. Razor Ramone vs Shawn Michaels
Best Match of the night. Shawn Micheals took some bigtime bumps in this match. A lot of high spots in this match. My favorite spot is when HBK does a backflip from the ladder on to Ramon.
GREAT MOVES AND ATHLETISISM by both men.
9/10

Overall good PPV to watch. One of my favorite ppv tapes of all Time!
