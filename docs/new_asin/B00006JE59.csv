2685260,5,B00006JE59,"When I first heard the synopsis of the latest Tom Cruise sci-fi/action vehicle I was skeptical.  The general premise of a man reliving the same day over and over again has already been explored in comedic form in Groundhog Day, and more recently as science-fiction in 2011's Source Code.  Both of those films are outstanding and I questioned whether Edge of Tomorrow would bring anything new to the table.  Upon leaving the theater I can say the film quickly put those fears to rest.  The concept may be familiar to you, but Edge of Tomorrow explores it in fresh, new ways, while also providing some of the best action sequences of this or any other year.

The film centers on Major Cage (Cruise) an inexperienced PR man thrust into the middle of a battle between mankind and an unrelenting alien force known as the Mimics.  During this conflict Cage gains the ability to relive the fateful day over and over again each time he dies and, along with an army veteran (Emily Blunt), uses his new found ability to discover a way of defeating the alien threat once and for all.

Edge of Tomorrow is modern action filmmaking at its finest.  All action scenes are well-paced, feature superb special effects, and make wonderful use of the human soldiers' combat suits and the unique attack patterns of the Mimics.  Think of the book Starship Troopers crossed with Saving Private Ryan and you'll have an idea of how Edge of Tomorrow's action plays.  Each sequences feels distinct and I never felt the filmmakers were resorting to the common trap of just throwing prolonged sequences of soldiers screaming and shooting for extended periods of time.  Each time they suit up you're in for a new spin on the combat.

Given director Doug Liman's background with film's like The Bourne Identity this was to be expected.  What I wasn't expecting was how funny this film can be.  They have a lot of fun with Cruise as a coward and his repeated deaths that was able to keep the film entertaining even when the characters weren't tearing up the French country side in mechsuits.

Watching Tom Cruise play against type as a cowardly desk worker is amusing, and his gradual transformation into action hero is well-developed, proving that the man still has what it takes to lead a big-budget action film.  Blunt's character makes sure the plot stays on track whenever it threatens to veer off course.  Bill Paxton also shows up in a memorable supporting role as a no-nonsense sergeant from Kentucky.  While not necessarily original these characters are all entertaining and likable in their own way.

Warner Bros. really took a financial risk choosing to finance a movie based on a Japanese novel (All You Need Is Kill) and an unproven genre.  I'm glad they did because I was thoroughly entertained.  Despite a few shortcomings in the final act Edge of Tomorrow is smart, funny, and has emerged as one of this year's best action films.  If you're an action junkie, a sci-fi nerd, or just someone who wants a fun time at the movies Edge of Tomorrow is worth every cent of admission.

(Note: As of writing I have not seen the film in 3D.  I intend to catch it in 3D eventually and will update the review once I've seen it.)",1401926400,5,3199,4.671428571428572
2685261,4,B00006JE59,"A great many influences were drawn upon by Doug Liman in crafting Edge of Tomorrow, which is very loosely based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's popular light novel, All You Need is Kill. More than just the simple ""sci-fi Groundhog Day"" it's most frequently described as, the satirical edginess will have fans of Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers chuckling, while the hulking battle suits are pulled straight from Japanese anime, and there are perhaps even hints of Deja Vu in there for good measure. But for all the different styles thrown in to make for an exciting and surprisingly light-footed action epic, the steadying influence is Tom Cruise, who at the age of 51 seems to be getting his action hero groove back.

Like the time loop-stuck hero he plays in Edge of Tomorrow, Cruise keeps going to the sci-fi well over and over, fighting to try and replicate his War of the Worlds success. And with a touch of slick humor, Doug Liman's energetic direction, and a hint of the bizarre, this is easily Cruise's best crack at the genre, despite a third act fail that threatens to kibosh the whole thing. Cruise plays Major William Cage, a shady pro war spinmeister happy to stay far in the background while others die for the cause. The world is under attack by strange, liquid metal-ish creatures known as Mimics, and to combat them the military has come up with weaponized battle suits capable of turning an untrained soldier into a hero. The face of this PR campaign is the ""Angel of Verdun"" Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who turned the tide of battle when all seemed lost. Posters of her are literally everywhere, inspiring others to fight for the cause.

Well, inspiring everybody but Cage who refuses an order by his commander (Brendan Gleeson) to embed with the front lines to cover an all-or-nothing strike against the Mimics. Cowardly noting that he can't even stand the sight of blood from a paper cut, Cage tries to blackmail his way out of it, only to be knocked out, arrested, removed of rank, and shipped out to camp to prepare for battle. There he's screamed at by an overzealous war-loving drill sergeant (Bill Paxton), tossed into a misfit outfit, and dropped into a firefight that echoes the beach storming of Normandy. Flopping around in a bulky metal suit, Cage still manages to accidentally kill one of the larger Mimics, only to have its acidic blood doused all over him, and in that moment of death he wakes up at camp as if nothing happened.

From here the film follows the Groundhog Day/Source Code route of Cage figuring out the parameters of his predicament. That means lots of dying and waking up, greeted with a booming ""On your feet, maggot!"", and to Liman's credit he manages to keep these scenes mostly free of repetition for the audience. That involves lots of quick cuts, presenting some moments from differing perspectives, and finding humor in the absurdity of Cage's situation. Here's the least likely soldier ever forced into a Hellish scenario in which he must be a soldier forever.  But everything changes when he encounters Rita on the field and her words, Find me when you wake up"", hint that he's not alone in this. He and Rita were much the same once, and with her help Cage must figure out a way to stop the Mimics and break the cycle once and for all.

Liman keeps the pace moving briskly, even at times when it should come to a screeching halt like in Cage's multiple training sequences. But these carry weight because of the importance heaped upon them; if Cage can't get his act together the whole world is doomed. And so it kind of makes you angry at him when he stops training to hit on Rita (points for trying, though), or just can't seem to get his timing straight. Of course, over time he begins to take things more seriously and we see the crushing war fatigue plastered all over his face. We've seen Cruise play this sort of character before, the free-wheeling guy burdened with impossible responsibility, and he does it ease. Frustration comes with Rita basically being reduced to Cage's sidekick when she starts off as such a badass. Thankfully she never quite becomes a ""damsel in distress"" and Blunt is capable of showing more layers to Rita than I think were intended. She's shown to be more than capable of holding her own and is a rare case of a strong female heroine in a genre dominated by guys. But let's not mistake, this is Cruise's film and Cage makes for an interesting enough character to root for. His initial sliminess marks him as more than just a standard-issue hero, one who would rather be on the sidelines than the front lines. His transformation into hardened soldier is, despite being cut short by necessary montage, rendered in a believable way.

While Cruise and Blunt may be perfect casting on the screen and to the studio bean counters hoping for a big box office, the compromise, or what I call ""The Cruise Compromise"" comes on the creative end. There's no real way to sugarcoat this: the ending is a complete disaster. It's the kind of lazy, go-home-happy Hollywood ending you might imagine a bunch of studio execs hammering out while ""doing lunch"". A more poignant conclusion was clearly intended, sacrificed on the altar of popcorn entertainment and in the process robbing the film of any chance to be memorable. It's the one lapse of intelligence for a film that is far smarter than the summer generally requires, and is worth reliving for a second time.",1401926400,2,5435,4.709779179810726

2685264,5,B00006JE59,"Is the other reviewer reviewing the movie or simply expressing his views on the media's take on Cruise and his spiritual beliefs here? It is kind of hard to figure out. And I find it strange that such views would be formed by the media since the media is as about as Hollywood as well... well Hollywood! I am not a Crusie fan myself, and am very sceptical of all things HollyWood-Stock, but to review a movie on Amazon is one thing, whether or not you give it one star or five stars, but venting one's frustration on a person, or personality, whether that personality be real and or imagined, perhaps belongs on some other kind of site. And to label Crusie as being talentless is being, not so much less than generous, as being less than honest. He has put in many good performances over the decades and would not be in the business for decades so successfully if in deed he was talentless. This is not the kind of movie I would usually see, I am not really into SF, but when it comes to the judgememnt of another person and his or her life choices, I think I will leave that particular task to God and not myself or someone supposedly writing a review of a film here on Amazon. One of the downsides of freedom of speech I suppose... Shalom.",1400025600,12,1241,4.3076923076923075

2685274,5,B00006JE59,Although I might not agree with Tom Cruise's choice of religion I must say that he surprised me and delivered the best Sci Fi/Action/Comedy film the year 'Edge of Tomorrow' came out. I forgot that he can do comedy as well as action and I really was pleased with the arch of his character going from self absorbed opportunistic coward to self sacrificing everyman who transforms himself to help save the world. This is the 'Groundhog Day' of science fiction movies and it not only works it will go down in history as one of the best films of it's genre.,1524355200,,552,4.475247524752476

2685276,4,B00006JE59,"Live, Die, Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow is a thrilling, sci-fi, adventure ride of a movie.  Tom Cruise plays the (at first) almost comically inept Cage, a soldier forced to repeat the same tragic day over and over again (and that's not a spoiler - it's in the title).  Cruise is in Mission Impossible-like form once he gets up to speed, and the non-stop action of the movie plays to his adventure star strengths.  Emily Blunt plays the hardcore Rita with a spine of steel that puts Cruise in the passenger seat.  She truly is fun to watch as she deals out death and destruction to the alien invaders.  Even the late, great Bill Paxton makes a delightful appearance as the scene-chewing Master Sergeant Farell.  It makes you miss him all the more.  The plot is a clever twist on the time travel trope and the technology and science of it all is explained with some attention to detail.  You can't pick at it too much, but that's not what you're meant to do.  This is a fun movie with lots of explosions and aliens that are soulless targets for the heroes' big guns and mechanical suits of armor.  The directing and cinematography are nothing revelatory, but they are perfectly suited for this genre of film. The chaotic camera work in the battle scenes lends substantively to the feel of the action.

There are three making-of featurettes and a collection of deleted scenes to round out your viewing experience.  Again, they're nothing groundbreaking, but they do offer an interesting added view into the mechanics of this highly technical and engrossing film.  For the current price ($7.88), you'd be crazy not to add this film to your library.",1524182400,,1640,4.6923076923076925

2685278,4,B00006JE59,Very good time travel film and that is from someone who doesn't usually watch Tom Cruise movies.  I won't spoil the story for you.,1523923200,,130,4.416666666666667
2685279,4,B00006JE59,"While I think Tom in real life seems like a weirdo that probably shouldn't get married ever again, some of his movies are great.

I think Edge of Tomorrow while no cinematographic masterpiece is a rather entertaining film that is heavily inspired by high production videogames such as Gears of War. A brief recap, Tom plays the role of a dishonored general that demoted to a new infantry recruit for attempted desertion. He has no training in the robotic armors being more of a desk officer that is more experienced in politics and power lunches than actual fighting.

The enemy? A strange race of alien robotic insects that are winning the war. As expected, he fights like crap during a suicide battle and watches how his new comrades are killed in the battlefield. Before he joins them, he gets exposed to a strange blue light and then the movie turns into a Groundhog Day homage.

After reliving the exact same day for a few months, he discovers the way to sneak out of the base camp and befriends a legendary warrior that won a previous gruelsome battle. He discovers that she was once also stuck in a groundhog day scenario after getting infected with the same blue energy, but she lost her ability after getting a blood transfusion. They team up and try to locate the core of the space-time bending energy of the enemy before they lose the war.

The film is lighthearted with a lot of humor and while I think there wasn't that much of a spark between Tom and the female costar, the story is engaging (albeit starts to get slow after a while). Perhaps it is a bit predictable, but I think that is was a fun movie to watch.",1523836800,,1627,4.505084745762712

I got caught up in the film and just enjoyed watching it. Cruise does a good job without coming across as a jerk or being caught up with himself.

A cup of Tom Cruise
A cup of Emily Blunt
A table spoon of Brendan Gleeson
A table spoon of John Paxton
Hardware, lots and lots of futuristic military hardware
A dash of Run Lola Run
A sprinkle of Starship Troopers
A sprinkle of Black Hawk Down

Stir vigorously.  Set surround volume to HIGH. Place clean disc in player and leave it for 113 minutes. Serve with 2 (or more) cold beverages of your choice with a side of chips--and don't forget the guacamole dip!

Director Doug Liman's 2014 science fiction action thriller Edge of Tomorrow starring Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt and Brendan Gleeson is one of the most exciting and original action films from a director known for bringing Robert Ludlum's Bourne series to the big screen. Also known for the tagline Live. Die. Repeat., Edge of tomorrow centers around Major William Cage, a U.S. Naval officer--played by Cruise-- with zero combat experience who is unwillingly deployed to the front lines of a landing operation to battle with alien creatures that have invaded earth. There, he teams with Special Forces leader Rita Vrataski known as the Full Metal Bitch--played by Emily Blunt --and becomes caught in a time loop that resets every time he's killed.

This is 1 of those films like Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film Starship Troopers that somehow managed to fly in under the radar. Having seen Liman's work on the original Bourne movie and his excellent 1999 film Go, I figured that if anything else, Live. Die. Repeat. would be fairly entertaining and have a decent script. What I wasn't prepared for was how easily the film would measure up with iconic films like The Terminator or even The Matrix. This is a muscular super-toy one can appreciate from a geek standpoint with all of the military gadgets like the combat exoskeletons the soldiers wear, to its humor, to its James Cameronesque level of action--everything about this film cries out for a sequel which is coming, I read, in 2020 and deservedly so. Tom Cruise is, as always, great in his role as a soft public relations officer who grows by experience on top of experience into a hard-core warrior. Emily Blunt is also great as a seasoned field warrior who mentors him. Brendan Gleeson is also great as Defense Force Commander General Brigham. And finally, the late Bill Paxton is great as Master Sergeant Farrell who whips Cruise and other soldiers into shape prior to the landing operation.

Live. Die. Repeat or, if you prefer, Edge of Tomorrow, is a damn good film that proves that you can make  an entertaining movie that is under 2 hours. If you're a Tom Cruise hater you have no idea what you're missing out on!",1517184000,,2688,4.757510729613734

Edge of Tomorrow is a film I have watched multiple times, and will probably watch many times again. It is as well made as a movie can be, from the basic premise, to the writing, to the effects (wow.) and the acting - it all just fits how it has to fit. This is probably the best written and conceived action movie to come out in a long time. It doesn't pander, doesn't throw out softball jokes or references. It is gritty without wallowing, and manages to bring a completely far-fetched and fantastic concept into a believable reality, which for me is the mark of all good science fiction. The acting is fantastic. For me this is the best Tom Cruise role ever. His unwilling hero is perfection - it is so refreshing to watch a movie with a hero who is not full of ego and bluster, but rather who is scared and would prefer to just be sitting in a pub somewhere, trying to escape his horrible fate. This is much more real and human, and makes for an endearing and relateable protagonist. At all levels this movie is a stand-out. With one exception that has always bothered me. The title. The title seriously sucks. Is it too late to re-title this movie? 'Live. Die. Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow'? That is horrible. 'Groundhog Day with Aliens and Robotsuits' would have been a better title. How about 'Once More Into the Breach?' or 'Die to Fight Again?' or how about '5000 Ways to Die for Your Country?'

2685357,4,B00006JE59,"To casually label it as a sci-fi version of Groundhog Day (1993, Harold Ramis) is to do ""Edge of Tomorrow"" a disservice. Try and name one good pop-corn flick in the last few years thats this original, intriguing, or isn't a sequel. Playing into World War IIs D-Day invasion (June 6th, 1944), the message is timeless: practice makes perfect. The nature of life itself remains that we must fail repeatedly to even begin to make progress. Even with a can-do mentality, we see that there are some aspects that Tom Cruise simply cannot achieve. The exact road you take to achieve your goal may not be as you planned, but perseverance will open up alternate doors. Easily one of director Doug Limans best films  he tends to favor the action genre, yet Edge of Tomorrow remains the most sophisticated. Any baggage of the post-2005 Cruise (jumping on Oprahs couch) can end. The collective performances from Rock of Ages, Jack Reacher and Edge of Tomorrow rightfully should bestow Cruise the same star-status he maintained in the 1980s (it wont, but hes worthy of it).",1514419200,,1059,4.786885245901639

2685478,5,B00006JE59,"While not Tom Cruise's best sci fi action film (Oblivion is better), Live Die Repeat is a fun romp. Cruise is very good at cocky, as he has proven repeatedly since Top Gun. Here, as in The Mummy, he is no hero but a self-serving jerk.

Condemned to die alongside his fellow soldiers when humanity launches its last offensive on the beaches of France against alien invaders, Cruise discovers that he cannot die.

This is where one of my favorite actresses comes in, Emily Blunt, who plays the ""Angel of Verdun,"" Sergeant Rita Vrataski. Turns out she had one Cruise has, and then lost it. That is, she was unable to die too.

It's all part of some weird alien physics that puts Cruise into the future's driver seat. He can now determine events, and so the aliens especially want him dead. The problem for Cruise (and humanity) is that if he doesn't die, if he gets a blood transfusion, he loses his powers.

This leads to a hilarious training session where Blunt tries to whip Cruise into shape and he keeps getting hurt. I won't give it away but watching the movie is well worth it just to see these scenes.

The action sequences are well done. Brendan Gleeson is good as the allied commander-in-chief and Bill Paxton turns in a great performance as a drill-instructor-type NCO. It's a fun movie, full of action and also full of laughs.

The ending requires some explanation and unfortunately, no reviewer can provide that. In fact, they're making a sequel that will explain it all. And I'm looking forward to it.

I said Oblivion was better but Oblivion is one of those films that demands 5 stars plus. I still have to give Live Die Repeat 5 stars for Cruise and Blunt alone.",1501804800,,1675,4.54485049833887

The movie stands just fine on it's own.  I enjoy real Science Fiction.  And, that is something which does not require fantasy to work.  This movie met that challenge.  Most do not.  On a side note, the military suits reminded me of the armored suits Aurthur Heinlein described in his book Starship Troopers (ignore that movie by the way, it was beyond awful and has no relation to the book at all).

2685527,5,B00006JE59,"I watched this film three or four times before suggesting it to reticent friends. Both did not particularly want to watch a Cruise movie because of his Scientology sell factor. I suggested that while holding what may be considered his rather bizarre (to us) beliefs to the side, he is an actor to be respected for his abilities and craft, and that this role has some great humor at his character's expense. Emily Blunt repeatedly shooting him to reset the day simply to save time is hilarious as he pleads ""I'm good!"" when his leg is broken, and the exchanges with the Master Sergeant (played by the wonderful departed Bill Paxton) are delicious. This is not a grisly, horrifying alien war film: the story is novel and a great vehicle to let these very talented actors express themselves in some occasionally quite touching ways. I found it very entertaining (and refreshing, as the story is complete and there is NO set up for an encore film). I find the current trend of sequels quite distasteful and often leave the theater feeling had and used by what is released of late. A story with a complete arc that wraps itself up is gratifying when well done, as I believe this one is. Emily Blunt is great in this one, too.",1499299200,,1220,4.575342465753424

2685571,3,B00006JE59,"Live, die, repeat. Or more appropriately: lather, rinse, repeat. So is the basic premise for Doug Liman's ""Edge of Tomorrow."" Not your average Tom Cruise vehicle, the film is built on the premise of a solider who, by some form of luck -- good or bad -- has attained the power to hit refresh on the same day. The catch is, he must die in order to do so. But in repeating the same day over and over again, he gains the edge over the Mimics -- robotic/insect aliens -- that have invaded his planet and eventually wins the trust (and, yes, affection) of his tough-as-nails partner, played by Emily Blunt.

That's right, this is basically a sci-fi ""Groundhog Day"" with a video-game twist. Cruise's character re-spawns over and over again until he can learn from his mistakes and make progress. Naturally, this lends itself to a few humorous brushes with fate and a potential for fatigue as the audience is treated to the same action sequence over and over again for most of the first half of the film. No matter, though, as the film is never as dull as its limited premise would suggest. Liman, who directed the exceedingly entertaining and refreshing first ""Bourne Identity"" flick, is right at home with the material. The action is tempered with humor and flickers of humanity, with a surprisingly tolerable turn from Cruise, though Blunt is the real shining star of the movie. Stone-faced and focused, her character is the backbone and the heart of the movie, undercut only when the film sees fit to pull her into an unneeded romantic side-plot with Cruise (who is, incidentally, old enough to be her father). Elsewhere in the cast, we are treated to the always wonderful Bill Paxton as Cruise's increasingly befuddled sergeant. While he misses the perfect opportunity for a reprisal of his ""Game over, man, GAME OVER!"" line from ""Aliens,"" he is another bright-spot in the film. But then again, a little Paxton always went a long way in making any film better (R.I.P.).

The film admittedly gets a little soggy in the final act, as the aforementioned romantic subplot is tacked on and the film strains to find a satisfying conclusion. The action ultimately becomes a bit of a blur, and the cinematography gets a little sloppy during the final face-off between Cruise and the Mimics. It doesn't completely undo the goodwill generated by the first half or so, but one can't help but sniff a little bit of last-minute studio-meddling and re-shooting here. Regardless, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a more than satisfactory and unique sci-fi film. Flawed, yes, but most assuredly a solid way to pass a rainy Sunday afternoon.",1494720000,,2610,4.7849223946784925

2685613,5,B00006JE59,"It is often easy to overlook just what a fine actor Tom Cruise is because in most of his recent films he has been cast as the heroic figure in action movies that focus more on his physical prowess than his ability to portray a character.
In ""Live, Die, Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow"" Cruise is once again portraying an action hero but there is a difference: In this movie he is NOT always brave. In fact, in the beginning of this time-warping, science fiction film he is downright cowardly. His ability to make us believe that aspect of his character shows us, as viewers, just how very talented an actor he really is.
The movie, directed by Doug Liman and co-starring the marvelous Emily Blunt, is a truly excellent bit of film making that could easily have gone off the rails. It deals with an alien invasion of Earth and has a definite ""Groundhog Day"" vibe given the fact that Cruise's character is stuck in a time loop. Each time he dies time is reset and he wakes up on the day before the battle in which he is killed. It's a fascinating concept but one that could easily confuse - and ultimately frustrate - viewers if not handled correctly. Thanks to Liman's direction, a well-done screenplay, and Cruise's ability to inject humor into the time loop sequences viewers are able to follow a clear path to what turns out to be a dramatic conclusion.
This movie has been reviewed thousands of times so it's not my intention to discuss the cinematography, the plot, and other aspects of it in depth. I will point out that in this film the late Bill Paxton showed once again why he was considered one of America's finest character actors. His portrayal of the sergeant in charge of the platoon that Cruise winds up being assigned to, is spot on. I'll also add that Blunt, as the ""Full Metal Bitch"" with a reputation for killing alien invaders, is terrific in the role.
That said, I'll sum it up this way: Great performances, smooth direction, and some truly unique alien invaders make this a 5-star film.",1489449600,3,2000,4.542936288088643

2685615,5,B00006JE59,"One of the best sci-for films to come out in quite sometime. Tom Cruise does it agin with this action packed rollercoaster ride of a Sci-fi film. Minority report, Oblivion and now Edge of tomorrow. The man is a great science fiction action star.

He brings with him his comedy into a chaotic situation and even during battle scenes. A must see!",1489363200,2,344,4.548387096774194
2685616,4,B00006JE59,"What a marvelous mixture of outstanding themes, from Robert A. Heinlein's Starship Troopers, to John Steakley's Armor, to Danny Rubin's Groundhog Day, all woven into a tight, fast paced, seamless story filled with irony, humor and, of course, horror. Saddest bit was seeing Bill Paxton in one of his final roles, but this was hardly the film's fault.

Tom Cruise carries this film as he must. He appears in nearly every scene. It's not easy to like the person of Tom Cruise for many reasons but I strongly feel that an artist's work must be regarded as wholly separate from what bits and pieces we get of an artist's life when they're not working. Yet I know that it almost pains many people to acknowledge what a superb actor he has been over so many years covering such an enormous body of work. One has to wonder if it is not indeed those very traits that make him so repellent as a public figure that contribute to his greatness as an actor.

Emily Blunt...well....my god it's hard to begin to describe her adequately. From a bit part as a gorgeous bimbo with great legs in Charlie Wilson's War to a near pure warrior with a warrior's physique in this film, all I can do is simply marvel at her abilities. Combining both butch and beauty in a brutal character who never smiles, yet we find ourselves drawn to and care very much about her fate, that is brilliant acting!",1489104000,,1373,4.51004016064257

2685634,5,B00006JE59,"Great scifi. I liked this movie because of the interesting twist constantly being reincarnated added to the film. The surround sound and animation is great. I also liked that it was not produced to be a vilography or pornography film. To be sure, there is action and violence, but not the ""over the top"" blood and gore you see in something like Hacksaw Ridge, which made my wife physically ill. Another thing I like about this film is that it was not dumbed down with a bunch of constant and needless profanity. Most films out of Hollywood these days have both vilography and pornography thrown in to help titilate the ""down market"" usually also an attempt to compensate for a creative flop. This is one of the few movies I have seen lately that has no political agendas, ie, no homosexual thing, no transgender thing, no evil America thing, no evil Corporations thing, no evil big gulp cups, no evil military, etc......heck there might have even been a few ""Big Gulp"" cups in the movie!

Before renting, I pulled up reviews and one of the most accurate I read was that it's not a movie about time travel so much as it is and event movie.  It's a good action ride where Cruise starts off as a mousy character, very opposite of Jack Reacher or Ethan Hunt.  And Emily Blunt is awesome as a tough (but not in quite as manly a way as Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor in Terminator 2) soldier.

The effects are great, as is the acting and though the solution to any alien invasion these days is by killing the queen is becoming a bit overdone, the movie maintains the logic well and having a human able to tap into the queen's ability to reset time is a new twist.  Emily Blunt is as compelling as ever and , though I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, Cruise plays his character's evolution from reluctant warrior to savior of humankind with his usual steady hand.  All the other characters in the movie are just backround noise to the quest Blunt and Cruise are on, no one else standing out. The script is very well-written and the editing is done in such a way as to keep the story moving even as the leads relive the same events over and over until they ultimately succeed.

I purchased the Blu-ray ""Standard Edition"" and the product images and description seemed to conflict on this. Well, long story short, yes, it includes a UV code. Also, the inside flier states that the code needs to be redeemed by 10/7/17. Not even the product packaging indicated that it would be in there. The cover just says ""Blu-ray Disc"", but the code is in there, along with a DVD copy as well. Please keep in mind that if you purchase this from a 3rd party seller (e.g. it doesn't say ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"") your results may vary.

Another possible reason for watching it was that I had just seen Emily Blunt in ""The Girl on the Train"" and that reminded me what a good actress she is.

All of you who have read something about this movie understand that the plot is basically - I do not want to say ridiculous, because the move works, so what can I say?  That I am a complete sucker for time travel movies?  Why is that? It is not just me, many people are.  What is going on here?  Maybe our subconscious minds know that the time of physics (not psychological time) is really spooky and strange.

In fairness to Tom Cruise, we all have to respect the fact that he does his own stunts, some of which are dangerous, and he shed some actual blood making ""Live Die Repeat"".",1479168000,,954,4.118918918918919

2685875,5,B00006JE59,"This is a movie that has no boring parts, the entire film is immersive and the production of the film was very well done. Tom Cruise is crazy in real life, therefore perfect for this role of a someone who has to relive the same day hundreds of times, while slowly falling in love with Emily Blunt who is an absolute babe. Honestly I think the reason I watch this like once a month is because in this movie, she is both super hot and a total badass. She also has some crazy yoga pose she does that looks impossible.

The ONLY thing I didn't like is the cover, because the Oblivion cover ""feels"" more like this movie.  LIVE REPEAT DIE is right, but it should have a picture of cruise on the beach in armor, and firing weapons as one main image on the cover.

Tom Cruise is at his most likeable and Emily Blunt makes a great action lead. The 3D is very immersive and comfortable. Lots of depth and shrapnel flying out of the screen. The opening act up until (spoiler) Tom Cruise's first death feel like a theme park experience. I'm going to get a lot of mileage out of this blu-ray.,1472860800,,490,4.455555555555556

Amazon streaming has been terrible for us over the last few months. We constantly have to lower our streaming resolution to SD or the films get way out of sync. We do not experience these streaming issues with other suppliers.

2685957,5,B00006JE59,"I love this movie. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are excellent, and so are Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson. Paxton's ""Battle is the Great Redeemer"" speech, oft repeated, is one of the funniest things I have ever heard - the more so because he smiles each time he recites it like it's the first time such glorious words were uttered. This is just one example of the wonderfully cheeky humor present throughout the movie. The action is gorgeous, with explosions and super-suits and roly-poly aliens disemboweling soldiers. Even better, the cadence of the movie is top-notch. Sometimes the script has us revisiting events from the ""past"", and sometimes it surprisingly skips right ahead, but you never lose track of what's going on. The romance between the two main characters has a fantastically interesting dynamic, which I won't spoil for you - you'll just have to watch the movie. Finally, the song that plays at the end of Edge of Tomorrow is probably the best match there ever was, but you won't be thinking about that while you watch the movie.

2685976,5,B00006JE59,"Edge of Tomorrow is my favorite Science-Fiction movie of the past decade. This film stands as one of the great triumphs of Sci-Fi, Action, Adventure, and even stands up as a fine Comedy. This film is perfectly timed, perfectly acted, and features masterfully executed visual, audio, and special effects. While the plot is a simple one, it is not hindered in any way by its simplicity. Before I saw Edge of Tomorrow in theaters for the first time in 2014 I was concerned about its possible potential for a poorly executed pace and timing, based upon my basic understanding of its premise. Prior to watching this film I thought of it as an Action Sci-Fi take on the ""Groundhog Day"" premise and worried that it would be difficult for the production team to offer the right pace of action. I wondered if the film would become boring or overly repetitive. After watching Edge of Tomorrow for the first time, however, my worries were immediately assuaged. Over the past decade or so I have noticed a reduction in the availability and frequency of high quality, well-written, and well-produced Action and Science-Fiction movies, especially among movies produced by Hollywood studios. I was extremely pleased after watching this gem of a film, as my fears of a future of endless sequels and perpetual rehashes of exhausted film concepts and plots were happily proven wrong. Prior to seeing Edge of Tomorrow the last Sci-Fi films I've truly loved that didn't require any improvements and matched the high quality of Edge of Tomorrow consist of James Cameron's Aliens, Terminator 2, The Matrix, Primer, District 9, Minority Report, Shaun of the Dead, Jurassic Park (the original), and 28 Days Later. Edge of Tomorrow stands among these films as one of the very best Science-Fiction films I've ever had the pleasure of watching. This is one of the rare movies that I actually purchase a copy of in order to watch it again and again. If you love any of the movies I listed, you will love Edge of Tomorrow and you will always remember it as a crowning achievement of the genre. In summary, I give Edge of Tomorrow 9/10 for acting, 8/10 for plot, 8/10 for visual effects, 8/10 for sound design, 8/10 for musical score, 10/10 for pace and timing, 10/10 for action content,  10/10 for direction, 10/10 for editing, and 10/10 for lasting enjoyment.

snapshot: a quality sci-fi title that has a good balance of humor (if a bit morbid), action, and character development (albeit at an accelerated pace).  could have developed the characters a bit more, and the antagonists are little more than a glorified deus ex machina trope to drive the narrative.

full review: i usually review restaurants and other establishments on Yelp! so bear with me here, i don't have the credentials that a 'professional' movie reviewer does.  oh wait, i do.  i have a brain, i like some things, and i dislike others.  most movie critics are morons, their input is entirely subjective (ie, opinions), and i have nuanced enough taste that whether or not i like a movie is entirely independent of their take on it.  i hear this movie was reviewed well.  don't care.  i liked it.  it was lighter fare for tom cruise in terms of budget-look, about as close to 'indie' as he's gotten in a while.  he did also run in this movie, if you feel the need to know.  but honestly it was emily blunt's character, played well, that really did it for me.  the background of this character is alluded to and she has the appropriate disposition given her experiences.  if you pay attention you can ascertain a lot of what happened to her, the clues are all there.  furthermore she plays the hardened and focused soldier type well.  also yoga moves on fleek.  there was an interesting narration technique where background characters that we might write of as unimportant become relatively developed and important to us in one sudden turn of the plot (not a plot twist).  the special effects of the movie were adequate; unlike big budget summer films the CGI wasn't another character on the screen (and a usually bad or over the top character).  in this movie the primary special effect is old school film-the-same-scene-30 times-slightly-differently-each time.  the movie doesn't spend a whole lot of time on the tech or 'the threat' as they are there to help set up the story, not overtake or tell it.  example: the book 'starship troopers' was a giant political science thesis that was set in the future during a war with giant bugs to frame everything; on the other hand the movie 'starship troopers' was a movie about spaceships that shoot bugs that eat soldiers...and *might* have had one line of political commentary in it.  i feel the the directing and editing EoT were done well.  i am a huge star wars fan and i liked this movie better than i liked 'the force awakens' because i had no expectations and was more than pleasantly surprised.  to give this movie five stars i would have liked to see more character development, particularly how the 'problem' in the story is effecting cruise's character and how it effected blunt's character (although both these things are explored a bit in the movie as i've mentioned before).",1470960000,,2870,4.716867469879518

2686001,5,B00006JE59,"I never thought I'd say this about any science fiction movie starring Tom Cruise after 'Minority Report' ... but this is actually quite good.  And hilarious.  Unexpectedly hilarious.  Hilarious at all of the right moments, and sacrificing none of the emotive potential of a man who faces death time and time again--and everything that goes along with this kind of repeated trauma.

The marketing team for this film made an absolute hash of promoting it in any reasonable, organized fashion, so I didn't see it in theaters.  (I could never quite figure out whether it was in theaters as ""Live Die Repeat"" or ""Edge of Tomorrow"" and it turns out theaters were confused themselves, so I missed it looking for the wrong title.)  But when I caught it on DVD, I kind of fell in love with Emily Blunt's character.  By virtue of the film's premise, wherein Cruise's character repeats the day each time he gets killed in the alien-invasion version of landing at the beaches of Normandy, Blunt's kickass Rita Vrataski ('The Angle of Verdun') is the only female character who exists to cast light on a male protagonist's coming-of-age narrative who DOESN'T somehow end up changed or domesticated by the process.  Because her memories are reset with each day, she is introduced as endlessly self-reliant, self-realizing, and self-dependent.

Don't watch this movie for Cruise.  Watch it for the brilliant writing, direction, alien design concept, and most of all--for Rita Vrataski, my personal hero and the best thing to happen to women in science fiction action flicks until this year's 'Ghostbusters.'",1470700800,,1591,5.038167938931298

Readers might like to know that some people get Edge of Tomorrow confused with a small budget sci-fi film called Age of Tomorrow. I picked up a copy of the latter at a second-hand store for the princely sum of $1 after I saw that Robert Picardo was it, as I thought he did a great job in 'Star Trek: Voyager' (by far my favourite Trek series), notably in the 'Latent Image', 'Living Witness' and 'Real Life' episodes. 'Age of Tomorrow' was a real hoot thanks to the hilariously cheap special effects, fogged up visors, cheesy dialog, etc. I enjoyed it more than any other film Ive seen this year. I saw it with my nephew and we had a great time. We burst out laughing when we heard Picardo say The sheer size of it; now one of my favourite movie quotes along with Badge?

I rented the movie.  Brilliant!  The acting of both leads is first class; and their interplay wonderful - witty, dramatic, dark, light, intense, hopeless and more.  And the writing, the script, is as good as you can really get.  The story is clever; it is hard to write a story about Time - it really is.  The dialogues are crisp and authentic; I cannot remember, off-hand, even one cheesy line - and that in itself is a testament to a professionally committed writer.  And the way that the repetition is handled, sort of beginning at the same place but with nuanced differences each time, is masterful.  Pay attention!  It is precise and surgical and every nuance counts.  This movie can be watched more than once for this alone.

2686029,3,B00006JE59,"""Groundhog Day"" with aliens!! Yikes.  But it's cleverly done.  Here's the situation: Earth has been invaded by an alien force that has the ability to create deadly ""mimics"" of its ""alpha"" warriors.  These mimics can wreak havoc on flesh and blood, and things are looking gloomy for the human race.  However, it happens that, if a human is lucky enough to kill an ""alpha"" and get alpha blood on him, then he (the human) can't be killed: rather he is sent back to repeat the previous day.  Major Bill Cage (Tom Cruise), an American PR man who is effectively press-ganged (by Brendan Gleeson, no less), and an English soldier called Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) figure out how it is that they have this power to repeat.  They then try to use it to adapt their behaviour going forward in order to identify, isolate, and hopefully destroy, the big brain-like center of alien power.  The director, Doug Liman, paces all this very cleverly, letting us see a lot of repeating early on, but then moving the action forward in such a way that we understand that there are repetitions that we haven't seen but that we now take for granted as what MUST have happened to a degree that we are not at all confused by the action.  The special effects of the scything whirligigs for the mimic aliens are effective -- not like any other aliens I've seen, and, of course, there's a certain amount of humor in scenes where Emily Blunt has to keep ""killing"" Cruise, so that they can start over and do better next time.  No acting is required by anybody here -- ""character"" is beside the point -- but the whole thing is well-paced and clever.  Do they destroy the alien brain?  Do you even have to ask?",1469577600,,1678,4.52317880794702

2686078,5,B00006JE59,"The ""Omega"" knows I've watched this movie before I've even watched it again!  Scary. So, better re-set and watch it again. What am I talking about?  Watch this highly enjoyable movie to find out for yourself. Has Tom Cruise won any awards yet for his films? I can't understand why not, he's very fun to watch.  Here he teams up with Emily Blunt as two soldiers fighting to win the war against a daunting alien enemy force. Heroine Sgt. Rita Vrataski, UDF special forces unit, recycles a helicopter blade into a weapon she uses for combat. I love watching her crush aliens with that awesome blade and you will too. I guarantee.  So, here are just a few of my favorite movie lines from the movie:

1) ""Those aren't officer cuff links.""
2) ""The fiery crucible!""
3) ""Where is the safety?""  ""Exactly.""
4) ""Who said you could talk to me?""
5) ""First of all this presentation is terrific.""
6) ""Nobody else will.""
7) ""Go, let's go!!""
8) ""You have to die. Everyday. Until we kill the Omega.""
9) ""My middle name is Rose.""
10) ""Keep your eyes open!""
11) ""Come find me when you wake up.""
12) ""Again.""
13) ""Again!""
14) ""Again!""
15) ""Again.""
16) ""Again.""

I could go on, but seriously just watch the movie, again and again!  The soundtrack is killer.  The DVD includes special bonus features you will also enjoy on the making of the movie and special effects including all about the origin of Emily's distinctive, awesome weapon.

Emily Blunt is great as the ""Angle of Verdun"", the special effects are good, and the movie is suspenseful.

It has a fairly standard story arc, but the premise, writing, editing, and direction make that not an issue.  I've seen it four times now, and it stands up.",1468195200,,485,4.488636363636363

""He's a bad actor and he's nuts!"" There's no acting in action movies.

""Oh he jumped on Oprah's couch!"" Don't give a s***.

It's fun, thrilling and gorgeously epic. I'm so happy to learn that there is a sequel in development now. I cannot wait to spend more time with the characters so wonderfully created by Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise (as well as the marvelous supporting cast throughout). Say what you want about Tom Cruise's personal beliefs and lifestyle, but this man knows how to deliver an amazing performance that packs a punch. This film is an unmitigated blast!

But then it was released on Amazon, and I started hearing chatter on Reddit about it.  So we watched it over Memorial Day weekend, and both of us were amazed.

2686276,5,B00006JE59,Bought digital version and was a bit disappointed in video quality sharpness and color saturation as well as audio quality when compared to Blu-ray disk standard. The movie itself is really excellent sci-fi and I stayed wide awake throughout the movie despite starting to watch it at midnight. Always a good sign when an old fart like me can do that.,1463184000,,350,4.754098360655738
2686277,4,B00006JE59,"Neat movie.  But, the whole reason I ordered the rental was too see if the filming techniques, sets, and the suits would work for a Warhammer 40k movie.  And I think it would work.  I spent most of the action scenes imagining the jacket soldiers as Astartes.  Take into account the Game of Thrones technique for making the giants using real actors and the potential is there.  Just need a director and editor that doesn't use such close shots or rapid fire editing but most of the action stuff was pretty good.  The scenes of the actors in the props and just plain walking was a highlight for me.  That's movie magic.  Not CGI.
The movie itself is fun, but the aliens are boring, generic, lame, and completely uninteresting (I know it's based on a Japanese book).  What I most enjoyed was the production value, it's set quite high.",1463184000,,831,4.523489932885906

This is a review if Live Die Repeat

At first I was not sure how I felt about purchasing a digital copy of a movie. But after I made my purchase and realized how much better a digital copy was than a DVD I am now purchasing all my movies as digital copies. I have tried all the other competitors and have found that Amazon is much more user friendly and works on more devised than all the others combined. And you can download off line copies to take on trips.

As far as the movies me and my sons love it. We have watched it numerious times and it is just as good every-time after the first. We can always find something we didn't see the first time. I love this movie and Tom Cruise is great as always.",1462060800,3,887,4.939597315436242

I thought it would be boringly repetitive. And indeed, his first couple of deaths seemed to confirm my suspicions. But the story instead advances and improves, as does the action, as it proceeds. Cruise is as good as he usually is in his action movies, and the versatile Emily Blunt is excellent as the female lead Rita Rose Vrataski. The Mimics, who look like demonic dog robots, are neat looking. I can't quite give this movie four stars but would give it three-and-a-half if I could. A Cruise fan would probably enjoy seeing it at least once.

I found it exceedingly satisfying and there is so much packed into almost every frame I've watched it several times and always notice something new. One of the most creative takes on an alien life form I have seen and I've been watching sci-fi and monster flicks for over 50 years. This is a gem and it immediately jumped to my top five.

No, not especially the most professional way to start a review, but then again,
I make no secret that I'm not a professional reviewer.  I'm a movie enthusiast
like all of you, who loves nothing more than to watch and talk about the latest
Blu-ray releases.

So, here I am today to not just talk about -- but to implore all of you science fiction
fans to open your wallets and blindly shell out some dollars to purchase this year's
most thrilling, and engaging alien ride.

And before I even talk about the movie itself, let's get over a few obstacles.  First,
let's talk about the film's title.  Based on the sci-fi graphic novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka,
All You Need is Kill, the film was released theatrically as Edge of Tomorrow. Along the line
it seems that perhaps Warner Bros. felt uncomfortable with the name and
decided to headline the Blu-ray box art with Live Die Repeat.  Will this make for a more
compelling Blu-ray purchase?  That's a question we may never get answered.  Next,
there's the film star, Tom Cruise.  I think I speak for many when I say that I never
understood how the actor has remained a box-office draw with the amount of mediocre,
badly acted films he has appeared in over recent years.  However, I am rather shocked to
say that Live Die Repeat EOT is the kick-in-the-ass that Mr. Cruise's career has badly
needed.  This is a film that every Tom Cruise naysayer is going to love.

In the future, the world is under siege by an alien race known as Mimics.  Major William
Cage (Tom Cruise) is a well uniformed, but rather smarmy P.R. guy who becomes the face
of the military, assuring the public that humanity will win the war over the invaders.  With
no combat experience whatsoever, Cage is suddenly thrown to the front line of the war by
an unsympathetic General (Brendan Gleeson).  It doesn't take long for Cage to die in combat,
only to awaken moments later and repeat the day once again.  It's the kind of time loop trap
that is reminiscent of Ground Hog Day, but on a much larger scale. This time, there's a war
to be won and Cage realizes that with each reboot, he's getting closer to finding out how to
defeat the aliens.  After dozens upon dozens of ""resets,"" Cage meets Rita Vrataski (Emily
Blunt), the most decorated soldier in the army, who also has been gifted with the power of
rebooting.  Together they team up to figure out how to defeat the alien invasion once and
for all.

Directed by Doug Liman (Swingers, The Bourne Identity), Live Die Repeat: EOT effectively
tells the same story over and over again without boring its audience.  Through very clever
editing, the repeated story finds new ways of remaining humorous and fresh,  and in the
process, moves the film forward at a rather brisk pace.  The cast is absolutely sensational,
particularly Emily Blunt, who is perhaps the most intriguing super heroine to hit the screens
in quite some time.  The film is filled with loud, epic battle pieces that are very reminiscent
of watching Private Ryan when the forces hit the Normandy Beach.  Intertwined with all these
great alien battle sequences are lots of genuinely funny comic moments that come out of the
many story twists this film has to offer.  It is so rare to see the elements of plot, action and
humor come together so perfectly.

Live Die Repeat EOT looks as incredible as one would expect from a Blu-ray transfer.  The
amount of detail is impressive to say the least.  At the beginning of the film, you can count
the beads of sweat on Tom Cruise's face as he faces the inevitable drop into battle.  Colors
are pretty non-existent here as the film has an intentional bright, washed-out look.  While
there has been a decreased emphasis upon color, there are moments where brighter colors
can be seen, particularly highlighting blood during combat.

The big question here will be whether it's worth opting for the 3D version of this release.
This is yet another upconversion effort from Warner Bros.  However, the studio reunited
the team from Prime Focus World who did the stereo conversion for Gravity.  You can read
more about the conversion process here.  As most of you are aware, I am generally not a
fan of films that have been unconverted to 3D.  Perhaps the best unconverted release I have
seen to date is Pacific Rim, and unfortunately, Live Die Repeat EOT falls a little short of that
effort.  Still, the film delivers plenty of depth which makes the over-the-top battle sequences
seem more immersive than their 2D counterpart.  There's plenty of dirt and battle debris
flying at the screen, but unfortunately because of the upconversion, it gets thrown towards
the screen instead of directly at the audience.  Yet, there are brief moments while wearing
eyewear that you could swear you were just hit with something.  Perhaps the most effective
scenes that make the best use of 3D are the ones that were shot underwater near the end
of the film.  Overall, a decent upconversion, but I wasn't impressed enough to say that it's one
of the better 3D films I have recently seen.

Ghosting was non-existent.

The film boasts a very loud, aggressive 7.1 mix that works wonderfully to compliment the
on-screen action.  What I found so compelling about watching this film was that the sound
seemed to place me right in the middle of combat as military aircraft circle overhead and
the sounds of machine gun fire and exploding grenades seem to emanate from several
directions at once.  The added rear channels do an excellent job of proving sound that is
all encompassing.  Dialogue remains clear and intelligible beneath the chaotic sounds of
battle.  Subs get some nice LFE support, but surprisingly, it's not as overpowering as I would
have expected.

Live Die Repeat: EOT arrives as a 3-Disc Blu-ray Combo pack (3D Blu-ray, 2D Blu-ray, DVD
and Digital HD/UltraViolet).  The case comes enclosed in a lenticular cardboard sleeve.  There
are numerous special features that include Operation Downfall - Adrenaline Cut; Storming The
Beach; Weapons of the Future; Creatures Not Of This World; On The Edge with Doug Liman
and Deleted Scenes.

Live Die Repeat: EOT is a huge departure from the usual dreck that Hollywood has been putting
into theaters.  It's a remarkable, expertly produced, science fiction roller coaster ride with enough
thrills and twists to give it the Blockbuster status it deserves.  Easily, the best picture to come out
this year thus far.  Do not hesitate to purchase this blindly.

I could spend another 113 minutes watching this film again.  Can't wait to do so!",1453075200,,6558,4.765070921985815

However, this is also one of the reasons why I found this film to be such fun. Watching him bite the dust over and over again was entertaining and fumy. Putting aside my bloodthirsty nature, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Good script with just enough cliche thrown in to be funny, but not enough to get stale. Good characters, great action, excellent editing and casting (I know - form a person who does not like Tom). Overall, as a Sci-Fi fan and a fan of good action I though it was fun, a bit macabre but light, and visually and mentally entertaining. Exactly what I was looking for.",1451952000,,693,4.2180451127819545
2686516,5,B00006JE59,"This is by far one of my new favorites.  It's got Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt in an alien invasion movie, what else do you want?  I haven't read the novel this was adapted from, but it sounds like it might be a pretty fun read.

The plot may seem familiar in this day and age, but in my opinion it's not who's first, it's who's best.  The main character, Tom Cruise, is an American military propaganda spinner, and ends up putting his foot in his mouth leading him to a path where he's forced to fight on the front line with the infantry soldiers.  He quickly finds himself facing imminent death, and through an unexpected turn of events, finds that every time he dies his day resets.

He has to ""Live, Die, and Repeat"" until he's able to discover a way to defeat the enemy once and for all.

The supporting cast does an out-of-this-world performance, and Emily Blunt performs phenomenally.  The special effects were a mix of elaborate sets and green screen, which comes together to really make the surroundings feel real.

The 3D version of the film is well done.  Not the greatest, but not bad by any means.  This is one of those movies where I almost prefer the standard 2D HD version, but both formats are close to a tie really.

If you have any passion for sci-fi at all, then this is a must see at least once.",1451952000,2,1314,4.340163934426229

2686550,4,B00006JE59,"Edge of Tomorrow was a movie I didn't hear much about during its theatrical run, but I was glad to have seen it on Blu-Ray.

I found the movie itself to be fun - it run a bit under 2 hours and I didn't feel that it dragged on at all (despite so many ""flashbacks""), it kept a nice pace throughout. The movie was a nice mix of Sci Fi and Action, focusing a bit more on the sci-fi side. I think that may turn some people off to it (and I do wonder how it would have been if it stuck to a more traditional action film). I'd give the movie itself about a 4/5

The video quality on the Blu-Ray is very nice. Grain wasn't noticeable, colors were nice and sharpness was there. A lot of the film is dark, so it's not reference quality, but I didn't notice any issues. Overall a nice transfer.

Audio quality was also very good, with lots of subwoofer usage. Clear to understand dialog throughout and a generally ""loud"" action movie. It's presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1.

The 3D Quality, however, I felt was a bit lacking compared to everything else. There was very little popout (mostly shrapnel on a few scenes), with most of it relying on depth and I just didn't feel the depth did much for it. Most scenes didn't show depth throughout, relying more on having a few objects in 3D and the background seeming to be flat. Using a higher-end Panasonic 3D LED TV I didn't notice any ghosting or crosstalk. I'd give the 3D about a 3/5 - the 3D didn't do much (even when it was used) and watching in 2D would present about the same level of enjoyment. I say this as a big fan of 3D films, and this is one I thought would be very fun to watch in 3D.

I didn't watch the extras, but there appear to be about 1 hour worth (behind the scenes, deleted scenes, etc..)

Included in the package are 3 discs (Blu-Ray, Blu-Ray 3D and a DVD, along with a Digital Copy code). The original 3D release also includes a lenticular slipcover (which also didn't do much for me -- it appears much darker in person and doesn't have the same quality as many other 3D Lenticular slipcovers)

Overall: Fun, enjoyable movie. Good Audio/Video but the 3D isn't memorable. If it's not much more, go for it.. but if you see the 2D one on sale, you'll enjoy it about the same. This comes from someone who loves 3D movies.",1449360000,,2284,4.236781609195402

I write it out, choose a title, click - ""Submit"" - wait awhile, get an email stating that it could not be posted to the website in its current form.

I really enjoyed this film so I try to figure out the problem. After making a few adjustments I click - ""Submit"". Time after time after time this has gone on and I keep getting emails stating that it could not be posted to the website blah, blah, blah. It's driving me nuts. What am I writing thats so offensive? It's like I'm up against some alien hive-mentality that's out to subjugate the planet.

Wait - I just remembered something. Right before I began to type this opinion I changed out the ribbon cartridge in my Epson MX-80 printer. It's a reliable old rig and over the years replacing these has become a messy procedure. So that night I changed the ribbon, got my hands filthy, then sat down to start typing with dot matrix ink all over my fingers. I wonder......

The premise is absolutely ludicrous, but if you are willing to accept it, it's a fine action movie despite some plot holes.
Millions of guys know exactly what this movie actually is: it's the life of a video game character as he explores his cybernetic Universe in order to beat the game.
But of course that is not what they say. They came out with the idea to film a video game then retrofitted a nonsensical story to explain it.

Small nitpicks and spoilers:

If the alien can control time why is it so easily defeated by people trying to learn the ropes? The whole thing with Time Lord aliens is b.s. and we all know it: If you can control time, how could you possibly be late for anything? The only way the movie works is if the alien is not able to learn along with Cruise, like a pre-programmed video game that does not change as the player learns its ins and outs. But if the program learns and changes along with the player at every reset, how could one possibly beat it?

If these guys know that spilling alien blood on them can turn them into Time Lords, then why not make an army of Time Lords before the alien can figure it out? They can know exactly where the alien will be every day and all they need to do is kill it every day and spill the alien blood on a different soldier.

It is also a good thing that we have a scientist (who's not even a Time Lord) who knows exactly what is going on and who actually invented a transponder that will tell them where the brain alien is, without having even proof that this alien brain exists! (...again with these centrally controlled aliens/robots - this is not the first time I've complained and here I am doing it again.)

Also, training one's mind is hardly the same as training one's body (which one can't do in a day without becoming tired every time at the end.) Any training Cruise would do should reset same as everything else. Or for that matter just because he can skip back to the past, what causes him to be able to remember either the future or his training?

And lastly, how does Cruise manage to not only reset further back in time in the final portion, but somehow transport the event of the killing of the alien sometime even further in the past?

But fine.

This could have been a PhilKDicksian movie, and they missed the boat, had they only come out with a premise that actually worked...
...But don't think too much, just turn your brain off and enjoy the action.",1446422400,,2626,4.329938900203666

2686659,5,B00006JE59,"Spoiler Alert!!! The Omega and its Mimics did not die in the ending of the movie (almost but not quite)... Let me explain for those who didn't quite catch the ending or thought it was an typical ending. There were actually good hints through out the movie explaining the Omega(mimic biology)... Important Part of the movie # 1) 39:10, Opens up starting with  Rita Vrataski, talking to Major Cage... Rita asked Major Cage  about his first encounter with this special mimic(Alpha), size etc... Cage respond Yes, Big and Blue etc... She asked did its blood get on you he replies Yes! We die tomorrow on the beach? He replied yes... Important part of the movie # 2) later after this part she took him to visit an engineer friend who was the only one that believe in this Mimic Biology and understood its Philosophy quite well which begin around 40:40 of the movie. Just listen very clearly about this alien and how it functions before she began to train him... Important Part of the movie # 3) Cage and Rita had to come up with a final plan to stop this Omega before its too late. 1:28min of the movie this began... J Squad was talking to one another on the ship explaining what they all must do.. Omega controls time, do not kill the Alpha cause it has the ability to reset the day and then THEY'LL know where coming. Major Cage response to that statement. Take a hit for the Team, if the Alpha attacks you! Here's the tricky part of the film @ 1:41min of the movie, where you have to pay attention.. 1:42min of the movie Major Cage killed the Omega(pay full attentions of the outcome when the scene changes). You'll noticed The Alpha and The Mimics all died instantly BUT... 1:42:40sec of the movie... What happened? Omega Blood got on major Cage body just before it completely died... Then what happened :) @ 1:42/52 of the movie the OMEGA RESSURECTED MAJOR CAGE and RESET THE DAY.... lol... Now go back to the ship when J Squad was talking if its blood get on you it'll have the ability to Reset the day and then they'll know where coming... So with that being said, the Omega Reset the day but this TIME changed its strategy... It allowed The Human to Win the war on the Beach!!! Operation Down Fall as Rita said during there first meeting with Major Cage once she introduced him to the engineer. Omega makes you think that you are winning. It allow the humans to win like in Verdun! Then later replanned a new strategy to wipe away the humans on a full scale of attack(like the day on The Beach). The Omega knows so he altered time and put Cage elsewhere. The enemy that knows the future can do what????? Knows Exactly how to win... 1:44min listen carefully to The General. He talkings about how the enemy is dying off and showing less resistance etc...(Okay go back to the ending before the Omega died, all Mimics died instantly).... So somebody tell me how are the mimics still fighting Russia and other spots of the world without its Brain(Omega which controls everything of the Mimic) :)

See??? The Omega still lives and allowing the humans to think they are winning hahaha... Cool ending or what? 1:44/20... Keep in mind, how did J Squad, Rita and Cage got resurrected? That should had been your biggest clue lol, the Omega did that! In other words all that s@#$ for nothing lol",1443744000,,3286,4.500837520938023

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU REQUIRE THE DIGITAL COPY. In order to redeem and download the digital copy, you need to use an app called ""Flixster"". The Flixster app will not play your redeemed movie. It will simply give an error every time you attempt to play a movie. Basically, you don't actually get the promised digital copy.

In order to get your digital copy, you need to sign-up for (or already have) BOTH an UltraViolet account and a Flixster account. The two accounts will be connected together. You use the UltraViolet website to redeem the movie (no mobile!). Then, using the Flixster app, you can download your redeemed movie. The download will be SLOW - you'll think it's not actually happening, but it is. I left the download going overnight and it worked. However, there's no point in doing that, because, when you try to play the movie, you'll just get an error - over and over again.

Update: it appears that the ""digital copy"" wording has been removed from the product title since I order mine, probably because of this exact issue. Although, you can see in the product description that it does say you get a digital copy (useless as it is).",1443744000,3,1265,4.638392857142857

2686674,4,B00006JE59,"Edge of Tomorrow(released May/14)stars,among others,Tom Cruise,Emily Blunt, Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson. This film is really a Sci-Fi Groundhog Day,but an enjoyable romp as this type of film goes.
The story opens with a myriad of TV reports about a terrorist siege that has griped the entire continents of Europe and Asia,and which threatens the rest of the world. Many of them refer to the ""Angel of Verdun""(Blunt),and show Cruise as a Major/liaison officer/PR man with the US contingent of the United Defense Force. Cruise is summoned to London to talk with the Commander in charge(Gleeson).This is when we learn the ""terrorist""threat is really an invasion of aliens called ""Mimics"".Cruise has,unbeknownst to himself,been put under Gleeson's command. And Cruise's orders state he is to ship out next day with the invading troops on the beaches of France. Cruise balks at the idea and is summarily put under arrest. While trying to run Cruise is knocked out,waking up next morning on top of some kit bags at the airport. Paxton,his(now)commanding sergeant,arrives and personally accompanies Cruise to his barracks telling everyone Cruise,now a private,is a deserter and is to be shot if he tries to run.
Next day,despite the total lack of training on the exo-suit all wear into combat,his squad's flight is shot down as it approaches the French coast. Dazed and confused(no pun intended)Cruise watches as many die around him. His final moment is underneath what turns out to be an Alpha Mimic whose ""blood"" spills like acid onto Cruises face. Suddenly it is yesterday once more and he is waking up on top of the kit bags. Once again he is thrown into combat but this time he meets Blunt/The Angel of Verdun,and the poster girl/soldier for the recruiting department. Before he dies he tells Blunt of his experiences and she believes him, as it has happened to her,and in fact is the reason her rep got to be as big as it was. She tells him to come see her when he reawakens.
The next cycle Cruise seeks out Blunt and the two hook up with a discredited scientist who was working on a way to defeat the Mimics. It seems the aliens are controlled by an Omega being,who in turn controls pockets through Alpha Mimics. They manipulate time and space as controlling factors in their invasion techniques. If one battle doesn't go well they simply reset time and start again until the desired result is achieved. Cruise's contact with the Alpha""blood"" enabled him to act like the aliens reset,as did Blunt until she woke up in a hospital and received a blood transfusion which ended her abilities. From here the three determine they must learn from their mistakes and train hard(especially Cruise),cycle by cycle until they achieve a victory. During this process it is learned that the Omega is under the Louvre,in Paris. Eventually they take their case to Gleeson who hands over a mechanism to them that the disgraced scientist had been working on. However they must flee after he tries to have them arrested. The next day Cruise wakes up in hospital getting a blood transfusion. With his abilities no gone,he and Blunt escape and go back to their base, where they convince Cruise's fellow soldiers to go on a daring mission to take out the Omega alien.
Their ship is shot down over Paris and only a few survivors remain. They must cross the Seine River and use a broken transport to get close to the Louvre. Once inside Blunt acts as a decoy for Cruise,who is badly injured. Blunt is killed while Cruise dives into deep water where the Omega alien is, with explosives. Just as an Alpha alien manages to kill him, he is able to drop grenades into the Omega who explodes,killing all aliens in the world. As a dead Cruise floats, some of the Omega's""blood"" rises and surrounds him.
Cruise wakes up now into a new world where he is on his way to his initial meeting with Gleeson. But now the Earth's forces have defeated the aliens,due to a mysterious ""surge of energy"" in Paris. Cruise re visits his squad at the airport and meets Blunt,neither of whom  recognize him. He smiles.
This is quite the action film and Cruise is definitely on game with this one. In fact the entire cast does a great job in their respective roles. The SFX are also superb. I can only imagine the headaches this film must have caused the continuity folks on the film. It would be a monster to cut and edit properly. The film opens with NO credits at all. I saw this film in its first week release,but soon after the parent company started advertising it with a new tagline""Live,Repeat,Die"".Why, I have never figured out. When I went to rent it  when it came onto DVD,none of the clerks knew it under its original name,they just knew the tagline. It does suggest the dumming down of the product though,and why film companies think we are all four year olds when it comes to understanding anything that appears on celluloid. The money spent on advertising alone(around a reportedly a cool $100 million!) could have funded several films. This is shake your head-crazy stuff. That's Hollywood.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. There are two featurettes in the extras department.
All in all Cruise and company turn in a solid performance,which can,at first,seem mighty confusing. The action,once it happens,is as intense as any you will see and the acting is first rate.",1442707200,,5385,4.776824034334764

The fact that Tom Cruise plays at least the first half of the movie against type just made it all that much stronger, and gave Emily Blunt the space to be even more kick-ass than Ripley.

For some reason the genre, along with horror, seems to be singled out for the most bone-headed formulaic movie making done, and rarely does the genre justice.  This movie is an exception.  It is one of the good ones.  It has has humor, wit, logical twists (some of which you shouldn't think about too much as with any movie involving messing with time), exciting fight scenes, and a worthy plot.  Without giving anything away, it is kind of like Groundhog Day meets Stormship Troopers.  It bears repeated watching which is about the highest praise I can give to a movie.

2686688,5,B00006JE59,"Edge of Tomorrow was my favorite movie of 2014. It was clever, funny, and action-packed.

In this movie, a soldier gets caught in a time loop, which forces him to live the same day over and over again. The bad news is that that particular day happens to be one of the worst days in human history. The good news is that by living it over and over again, maybe he can change it.

Edge of Tomorrow is an elegant movie, and it tells its story as much through what it doesn't show as with what it does.

Perhaps the best thing about this movie is watching Tom Cruise's character develop through the course of the movie. He begins as selfish and cowardly, but by the end he's a self-sacrificing hero.

Although, the plot is simple ""live, die, repeat,"" I appreciate how this movie was directed with twists and surprises in the most unpredictable way. Today movies are too busy being centered on sex, nudity and violence rather than the plot, concept and purpose of a movie, they don't make them like this anymore.

I'm not going into every scene or the characters because I want you to watch the movie yourself. The climax up until the ending of this movie is G-R-E-A-T! It keeps you in suspense.

There are several ways this movie can be taken / interpreted. It really depends on what level of so called ""consciousness"" the viewer is.

It can be seen as a video game made into a movie, where you die several times until you pass through the phases.

For those who believe in reincarnation, it can bee seen as a concept on how reincarnations could be if at some level we could carry memories over.

It also can be seen as humans trying to become as smart as what is keeping them ignorant, and by removing the obstacle through trial and error, peace is finally achieved, as time is a necessary illusion in our 3D world.

There are a few Masonic hints as well, as the numbers 13, 33 and 6 appear from the get go, around 1:43 into the movie.

The execution is excellent, even though I think the shaky cameras get really old real fast; They could have used more stable cameras during the non-action and dialog parts of the movie. When the background moves together with the foreground inside the frame, it becomes annoying very quick.

Tom Cruise has been ""illuminated"" in my opinion as he has been picking interesting scripts lately like Oblivion, this movie and others.

Watch this movie several times, you'll find new and interesting insights every time.",1440892800,,1277,4.594713656387666

I gotta admit, his sci-fi works really know how to rock it and rock it hard. I really liked Oblivion but I really love Tommorrow more. This is what summer blockbusters should be and whomever did the halfway job of promoting and advertising this gem needed to be jobless. Hollywood don't put out too many ""good ones"" anymore so anytime a smart, exciting movie like this fails, we end up with another brainless ""Transformers"" or ""Fantastic Four"" instead. Not good.

You have action in spades, but not just mindless, pointless violence and gun-play but what is essentially necessary to propel the plot forward. Suspense, likeable characters, humor, adventure, thrills, science fiction, and the always amazing Emily Blunt. Not only is she tough as nails (youll find out the special reason why shes like Ripley on steroids) but shes as hot as shes ever been. This movie was an absolute delight and this is coming from a guy who really cant stand Cruise.......but even he is marvelous in this, gotta give the doofus his due, he nails it here.

If you're still doubtful, let me give you two reasons why you should give this a try.
First, you get to see Cruise killed.......over and over and over again. In time (pun intended) he gets to be a real buttkicker right beside the delectable Blunt but his crash and burns get to be rather hilarious. If you cant stand Cruise, then you should enjoy his death scenes......theyre great.

Second, did I say Blunt was one tough hottie? This doesn't come to her naturally in the movie but does she ever pick up the ball and run with it. When has she ever not been amazing?

Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are both very effective here. This Blu Ray edition has some nice extra features, mainly about making the special effects.

Blunt and Cruise do an excellent job of portraying the characters and their roles match perfectly. My biggest complaint is that the side characters are hardly talked about at all, there's no character.

Sure, there are the archetypes; the tsundere, the guy whose always naked, the drill sergeant, generic heroic pair A, and the corporate jerk. But nothing that stands out. The closest we get to any sort of development with the side characters is the scientist who works with Blunt's character, but even he is basically a vessel for plot exposition.

A good movie, but outside of the main two, the character are poor.

Also, the ending to the book was better. I hate how Hollywood just can't seem to leave viewers with an unhappy ending.",1438646400,,893,4.67515923566879
2686791,4,B00006JE59,"The funny thing about Tom Cruise movies is that I almost always like them despite my sense that Tom Cruise has almost no acting talent. Or at least, that he has minimal range. He hit his peak in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Risky-Business/dp/B000SW16M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Risky Business</a>&nbsp;and when you peak so early in your career, there's nowhere to go but down.

So it is with some surprise that I find myself thinking that Cruise did pretty well in Edge of Tomorrow. In fact, he pretty much carries the film. The script, which is messy and full of holes, is just a vehicle for stunts and action and explosions. That's fine. I like all of that, especially explosions. Can't get enough of those. The other performances are enjoyable but what I like about Cruise is that he starts out as sort of a doofus, which is how I perceive him in real life, and is forced by circumstances to become competent (which might be a metaphor for his acting career).

This is a ""fight the evil aliens"" movie. The aliens are like big spiders which is a step up from lizards but not a giant leap. The plot requires Cruise to kill the top spider (called the omega) which will naturally result in the collapse of the underling spiders. The ""kill the queen bee"" plot is ridiculously unoriginal. It's also improbable. What kind of alien race would have any success conquering planets when their survival depends upon protecting a single target? It seems like an evolutionary plan that dooms the spider aliens to extinction.

But still, I like the way the story is structured. For reasons that make no sense at all, Cruise has his own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Groundhog-Day/dp/B00170I7GG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Groundhog Day</a>, reliving events over and over until he gets them right. This happens because he gets splattered with alien blood that affects humans like magic pixie dust. The Live Die Repeat motif could have been boring but the movie is amazingly well edited, avoiding redundancy, showing critical scenes from new perspectives, even explaining things in later scenes that didn't make sense when they first appear. I give huge props to the editor and director, and of course to the people who make things blow up.

2686811,4,B00006JE59,"I dread Tom Cruise movies because they are always stamped TOM CRUISE MOVIE in bold strokes from the promotion building up to the release and right through the movie itself.
The problem being that we never know if were going to see perfectly cast Tom Cruise (Risky Business, Rain Man, Jerry Maguire) or he wishes Tom Cruise (Mission Impossible, Jack Reacher). Edge of Tomorrow turns out to be good Tom Cruise and one of his best action endeavors.

The plot setup is quick and efficient and fits his Cruiseness like a glove. As smug, risk-averse Major Bill Cage, sent to do PR for the general in charge of Earths resistance forces to an alien invasion, he is taken aback when the general suggests that he will cover the battle from the front lines; things go south quickly and the general (a wonderfully gruff, poker-faced Brendan Gleeson) demotes him to recruit. When he stupidly tries to go AWOL, hes knocked out and ends up with the sorry-looking front-line grunts. When they are dropped into battle, its clear theyve entered an all-out slaughter as the aliens (not of typical alien design, these aliens resemble calamari on steroids) demolish all troops. After being spattered with the blood of an Alpha alien, however, he finds himself awake again, enduring another 24 hours as recruit.

Edge of Tomorrow is well-served by the fact that the rinse-repeat time device has not yet worn out its welcome; yes, you can say it mashes Groundhog Day and Source Code with a dash of Saving Private Ryan and War of the Worlds, but it does so with some nice twists (Cages reluctant hero), mainly in the casting of an against-type Emily Blunt as the kick-ass heroine known as Rita Vrataski. Shes full on gritty-sexy jadedness throughout, but thankfully the movie does not get (too) bogged down in clichd romantic subplots. Suffice it to say shes the only one who believes Cages crazy time story because she lived it herself; togetherhe in the time-loop, she in real-timemust use the day over and over to find the flaw in the aliens armor.

Director Doug Liman (Bourne Identity, Mr. and Mrs. Smith) handles the action deftly and the between-action plot set-ups serve the storyline well. Moments of humor are never out of sync, and we are spared any attempt at wooden action-movie catchphrases.

CLICHES: yet more post-apocalyptic despair complete with toppled world monuments, seemingly invincible aliens with one huge hive-mind flaw, fate of the world down to one man SURPRISES: Pop-song free soundtrack (thank you!) that keeps you in the story, and a coherently plotted time-twisting device (crediting writers Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Hiroshi Sakurazaka, author of the book on which the film is based, All You Need is Kill. JURYs OUT: Bill Paxtons scenery-chewing as a tough (duh) Master Sergeant is almost played over the top; just some needed humor, or cloying?

Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is ordered against his will to go into combatative
service and will be dropped onto the front line of defence on the French shores.
The Major can't even stomach the sight of blood, certainly not his own, the mission
he is about to embark upon is almost certainly one in which he will be killed.
Branded as a deserter and coward he's been demoted to 'private'
On the Beaches of France the Aliens totally overwhelm Earth's attack force including
unlikely combatant William Cage, however he's been thrown into a 'Time-Loop' and
arrives back on base on the evening prior to the ill-fated attack.
This happens over and over again, he cannot make his new comrades understand
that he knows what will happen next.
On the beach he'd met celebrated 'Warrior' 'Rita Vrataski' (Emily Blunt),with the knowlede
of what had happened each time around he's able to save from certain death at that moment
in time.
Each time he returns to the beach he learns a little more and develops his skills and gradually
learn how to fight back.
Because 'Rita' also has the memories of her earlier beach encounters with the Aliens,the two
begin to form an alliance, the former Major is put through his paces by 'Rita' he has many skills
to learn.
Teaching him new skills, over and over again, preparation is everything, a little knowledge
of what happens next, an advantage ???
It seems the only hope Earth has of victory may well depend upon the few.
There is some seriously enjoyable action sequences along the way as 'William' and 'Rita'
progress a little further on each re-visit.
There are also several light hearted moments that are sure to make you smile.
The film is without question an enjoyable movie experience indeed.
Great special-effects, in 3-D the action is certainly in-your-face so to speak, as the spider
like creatures are hurled toward you (great-stuff)
Great picture and sound quality throughout.
Special Features (in 2-D)
* STORMING THE BEACH - Drive into the trenches for a gritty look of creating the films
epic sci-fi batte.
* WEAPONS OF THE FUTURE - Watch Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt tackle the challenges

With this movie, 3D has finally come of age. In the past, the 3D aspects were kind of in your face and took you out of the action. In this movie, the 3D adds to the action and becomes a part of the story.

As for the story - there are lots of reviews breathlessly recapping the story line. No need to waste my time typing in yet another plot review.

The story is impressive though. The broad strokes being the time shifting alien race that is unstoppable and one man ending up as the counter. Normally, such a story would be told from a general's viewpoint with some grunt level action tossed in for excitement. Not here. It's all grunt level but this grunt has to win the war.",1435622400,3,756,4.129251700680272

2686871,5,B00006JE59,"Many people have equated this movie as another Groundhog Day.  I wouldn't know.  I've never watched that movie.  What this reminded me of was District 9 meets pretty much any 'aliens try to take over the world' movie such as Battle: Los Angeles.

As a not big fan of Tom Cruise.  However, I'll give this a nod in the direction of 'the longer you watch it, the less he seems to be part of it' film.  I'm my opinion, that's a good thing.  It doesn't matter about what actor I might be speaking.  I've lost the person and accepted the character.  Isn't that what good acting is ... acceptance of character?

Edge of Tomorrow isn't really a movie with a message.  If it is, it was certainly lost on me.  This was an action film plain and simple.  Sure, there's Sci-Fi through and through, but when it gets down to it, this is an war action film and its done pretty well.",1435449600,,866,4.271604938271605

2686895,4,B00006JE59,"First, let me say that I got this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack at Target for $10. When I say I liked this movie, you need to remember that. Why anyone would pay $24.99 or even $12.99 for DVD and Blu-Ray together is unintelligible to me.

That being said, I like this movie well enough to recommend it as a rental. If you watch it more than once, you might actually decide to own it--given, of course, you can find the combo pack for $10.

The plot device of time loops is fun at first, but it gets tedious. On a first viewing, all that looping interferes with the plot and suspense. However, a second viewing shows that writer/director Doug Liman is very probably making an anti-war statement. He's showing that war is always the same thing--cycles of violence and death repeated over and over and over. No matter how much advance information you gather and no matter how advanced your weapons, war is just butchery. Bill Paxton's comments about heroism seem noble at first, but after the umpteenth repetition they sound like rhetoric--which is just Liman's point. Over the centures, military leaders have been feeding their soldiers and the public the same windy lines.

I haven't read the book this movie is based on, but I think Doug Liman has definitely injected some of his own strong opinions about war and conflict. I have to say that Liman's views are very brave because they might be construed as anti-military during a time when we as Americans are very pro-military and supportive of our troops.

As far as differences between DVD vs. Blu-Ray are concerned, I didn't notice any spectacular differences--though I think the sound on Blu-Ray is more immediate and immersive. As you might expect, absolutely astounding special effects are everywhere on display thru the whole show and the movie boasts cinematography by Oscar-winner Dion Beebe.",1435104000,,1845,4.847619047619047

2686924,5,B00006JE59,"a fine tom cruise action flick.

aliens attack the earth and take over most of europe. a giant army is assembled in england to invade europe and kill the invaders.

Cruise plays a US Army PR flack who is Shanghaied to the front lines for annoying a general.

He manages to die quickly during the invasion when one of the aliens falls on him splashing him with its special blood. Somehow this causes a time loop where he relives the day over and over again. He learns how to extend his live after many iterations and eventually runs across a female soldier who experienced the same thing in a previous battle.

They try to find a way to survive long enough to kill the head alien but are unable to get far despite many attempts.

Eventually they realize that the head alien is under the Louvre and attack and destroy it there.

Some of the early part of the movie is pretty repetitive as the same thing happens over and over again. There is a huge jump forward at the end.

Mostly just a vehicle for some good old fashioned alien slaughter and blood and guts strewn all over the place, and it does that well.",1434240000,,1107,4.344660194174757

2686959,4,B00006JE59,"I was very skeptical about whether or not to bother watching this movie. With Tom Cruise's politics and religion in real life making him sound a bit nutty.  Did the viewing public need a Sci Fi action movie like Groundhogs Day? A la a movie repeating the same days events over and over.  But after viewing the film I was surprised to really enjoy the movie.  The movie had a lot of depth and kept you thinking the whole way.

I was intrigued by Tom playing a coward to start the film just an army recruiter with no combat experience suddenly thrown into the front lines.  To me that seemed more realistic rather than if he started out like Rambo. Emily Blunt fills more of that role as a pure warrior which is she seemed to do a great job in this film.  The monsters are obviously CGI but they are well done.  The relationship onscreen between Tom and Emily seems natural and does not seem forced.

I was impressed with Tom Cruises last film Oblivion even though a lot of people didn't like it.  You have to hand it to Tom none of his films seem repetitions of the same movie.  It seems like he is always coming up with something new which is why his movies remain popular. I would much rather see Edge of Tomorrow over any Mission Impossible sequel or a film such as Jack Reacher.

Anything film with Bill Paxton in it you have to enjoy.  He will always be the punk in Terminator or Hudson in Aliens to me or the obnoxious brother in Weird Science.  He is a scene stealing actor if there ever was one.  Bill's platoon of misfits was interesting and you see how Tom evolves to learn everything he can about each member.  Even when he tries to save them knowing it is futile.

I would recommend Edge of Tomorrow to anyone looking for a good action movie with lots of twists, it won't be for everyone but I thought it was a very good film.",1433203200,,1837,4.265895953757226

This guy looks and behaves exactly like a real army Master Sergeant- a permanent scowl with a bottomless bag of insults and denigrating wit... but who is not exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer. Paxton is brilliant in the role. If he doesn't get some kind of award to sit on his mantle for this role, Hollywood should be administered a psychiatric evaluation.
The romantic aspects are somewhat subtle and mostly implied. A lot of the elapsed time is only referenced by implication. That plays into understanding and following some of the secondary story lines.
The story is very well written, the special effects are top-notch, and there is no bad acting. Another worthy mention is Charlotte Riley as ""Nance."" Truth is, though, there were no bad actors in this one. Great flick.",1432857600,,877,4.9324324324324325

2687016,5,B00006JE59,"With all the mediocre sci-fi movies Tom Cruise has gotten cast in over the past years, this movie seemed to just get lost in the crowd. Just watch it! The best way I can describe it without giving too much away would be the movie Groundhog Day if the day was really on D-Day in WW2.

Acting is done well throughout, being that the movie is heavily around just Cruise an Blunt, and with Blunt being a stone faced warrior, the burden of acting and portraying believable emotion lies with Cruise, who nails it completely.

While all aspects of the film are handled well to great the story takes the gold followed VERY closely by the visuals. Being so difficult to handle the aspect of time manipulation in film, this film nails it with ease allowing you to become engrossed in the rest of the world they have created for the viewer and really appreciate the amazing battle sequences and alien/mech designs.

It is a real shame movies that try something different tend to bomb in the box office and stop potential creativity before it blooms, but hey, maybe after people get board of the same old thing in The Avengers 8: Rise of Interchangeable Villain creativity may get another boom.

This movie is a real gem and sure to be loved, just take a chance and watch it, please.",1431475200,,1271,4.51304347826087

Anyone happen to catch the movie Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton?

I've watched it as many times as Tom Cruise's character lives, dies and repeats!

Yes, I saw it. It was pretty well done, and Cruise did a fine job in the role, as did Blunt and Paxton. Thoroughly enjoyable, even if the explanation for how it happened was a bit incoherent.

Agreed. Plus, I liked how the script allowed the actor to adapt to the future, based on the past. As Nova implied, I found myself anticipating just as much as Tom.  Noticeably included.....the infinite regress workaround: he can't L,D,R endlessly.

One of Tom's best movies. The storyline is tight, the acting is great. Tom really does a great job in every scene. The directing was superb. Just the right pace. Just the right repeats. Enough of the enemy to satisfy me. The storyline was believable.

Bill Paxton was awesome. I loved his character. I could quote him all day.

Emily was bada**. She's cute, yet tough enough to pull both off.

The idea of living the same experience over and over is an interesting one for me. Having steeped myself in the fullness of self-enquiry so that my thoughts became ""lives"" (so that I live, die and repeat thousands of times a day); to the Dissolution by Thought and Daily Dissolution realizations present in that, we see in Tom's learning curves, the strangeness of watching those who are not learning (they are ""asleep""); to his surprise and amusement at first. We see a bewildered Tom at different times (rescuing others on the batllefield to the bar scene when he took the day off in London); to someone who learns to outmaneuver everything after innumerable trials. His facial expressions and acting are nearly perfect in every iteration (repeat).

Although we're all awake to some degree, the movie points out one of the ways we should be able to see how our lives are capable of seeing through all of the messes we create; and buckling down to the real business of solving our problems. They were created by us and we can undo them. The nature of Tom's knowledge goes from one of uncertainty and doubt about, literally, what will happen the very next moment, to one of nearly omniscience within the boundary of the battlefield; but that knowledge extends to the amount of times he can repeat going outside that boundary.

This is the theory of self-realization. We have lived every life. We have done all of the things we need to do. We know the outcome before it starts because we set the goal ahead of time. Lisa likes to pick on me for these notions. But, they don't work for the unknowns that we set goals ahead of time to discover. And, admittedly, in many avenues and pursuits in life, we want the future to be unknown.

But, when it actually comes down to it, much of what we do in life is capable of being set by us ahead of time. Not the living itself, but the boundary upon which we would operate, emotionally and mentally. We can learn, through movies like this (and the matrix and others) to see a future for ourselves and go out and challenge each other to create it. We would need to change our particular worldview that might pit us against one another; as well as our universal worldview that would pit us against each other because we want everyone to do like we do/beliefs and all; to a universal worldview in which each person knows that everyone has a different worldview and that each person's particular worldview will be different, but instead of a universal worldview that asks the adherent to force others to subscribe to it, this new universal knowledge worldview *already incorporates all other particular worldviews into itself*.

2687026,5,B00006JE59,"First of all, I had no idea what this movie was about when I started watching this movie on HBO. I didn't know it was related to the Japanese manga ""All You Need is Kill.""  I had, however, read the manga beforehand and when I noticed the similarities in the movie, I did a quick search and it confirmed this movie was based on the manga.

Usually when I watch a movie that is based on manga or a video game, I go in not expecting much.  They are just normally not that good.  I believe movies based on American comics have shown how they can be done right but manga and video game adaptations have not seen similar results.  Luckily, this movie shows that manga can be an acceptable source for movie-making.  Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are a perfect fit as the main characters in the film.  The acting is top notch, the comedic elements are perfectly placed, the story provides some very interesting aspects, the action is amazing, and the special effects provide a clean finish to a visual feast.

Hollywood seems to be running out of original ideas as can be seen by all the movie sequels being made instead.  I believe Japanese media provide some really interesting and fascinating stories that when bundled with the budget of American studios can become great successes.  This film is the perfect example of how manga adaptations should be done.  It gives me hope that other proposed American manga-adaptations like Ghost in the Shell and Death Note can also be great.",1431302400,,1472,4.580152671755725

I'm a bit of a stickler with regards to accuracy and consistency when it comes to movies that use ""time travel"" as a fundamental basis for the story line (e.g., the two original ""Terminator"" films are inconsistent - I won't go into the details here, but you'll have to trust me that they are indeed inconsistent), but ""Edge of Tomorrow"" does not seem to present any such temporal inconsistencies.

I love the scenes where Emily Blunt is training Tom Cruise to battle the aliens - it adds a bit of really funny black humor to the story.  I also appreciate that the director did not feel it necessary to show extensive scenes of destruction (as per the two most recent ""Star Trek"" movies) in order to justify killing off the bad guys.",1430092800,,1015,4.53551912568306

2687109,2,B00006JE59,"I watched this and Oblivion within days on Comcast.
I thought Oblivion was at least believable.
With regards to ""Live Die Repeat""; You CAN'T go BACK in time. If you could, then the entire cosmos would have to retract from expanding too.
If you went back in time 10,000 years for instance, the moon would be closer than it is today; the stars (other suns) would be
in different positions and so on.
Even is you decide to embrace this notion, then is the ""reset"" twenty four hours? Is it a day on this alien's planet (which would certainly not be 24 hours), and why is Cage always returned to precisely the same time as before?
After all, he dies at a slightly different time each day.
And why, near the ending, when he has destroyed the main alien, does he then go back to approximately two days in time (he goes back to when he was arriving in England in a helicopter), and not ""a day"" as before.
I thought the acting was fine. Bill Paxton is great as Master Sergeant Farrell. The female soldier ""Nance"" is the typical hard core, unruly, unkempt female that Hollywood loves to portray in this role. Very ""over the top"".
I also hate Hollywood's persistence on portraying soldiers as a motley bunch as societal rejects.
One of the squad even goes to battle in just a jock strap; I mean really!
Anyone who has any connection with, or has ever served this country in the military would find no connection with
these soldiers.
Finally, they moved the aliens' around so quickly that it became irritating. The end result was that they didn't even seem real (I know it is just CGI).
The rest of the battlefield look was great.
The obviously similarity to the ""D-day"" landing on June 6, 1944 worked well.
Otherwise, buy ""Oblivion"", and let ""Live Die Repeat"" just die and fade away.",1428710400,,1772,4.5062111801242235

Characters were also interesting, and I would say that this is the best acting that I have seen Tom Cruise do. I am impressed how Cruise brings the transformation of the character from cowardly weasel to someone who has been transformed by a crucible of war.

One drawback to the movie is that at the end, in order to make the movie more suspenseful, writers really stacked the odds against the protagonists making the whole thing a bit incredible. But that is a minor drawback.",1428624000,,699,4.410852713178294

Yes, I will admit that this movie is not overly original(other than the time loop and seeing Cruise die over and over and over). I will avoid details that could ruin it, but this movie about an invasion of aliens and how mankind has to find a way to beat them is some what over done. The movie's strength is both Cruise and Blunt working together and becoming a strong pair both as soldiers and as potentially something more. Again, familiar, but with great specials effects and a strong cast(Paxton is very funny here), this is a very strong movie that at least beats out Cruise's last sci-fi movie.

The illusion is seamless and internally consistent, the supporting cast and the effects and the production values are all excellent.
As a lifelong SciFi fan, (I remember being happy when Star Trek came on to TV), I can say with some certainty that this is one of the best action SciFi movies ever made because I've watched most of them.
Of course Hollyweird won't ever treat SciFi as a serious genre, so what? I haven't watched an academy award show in decades. I find most of the moves that they like to be repulsive losers anyway.

No thank you. I will say that Cruise and Blunt give compelling performances though so props on that.

On a side note, can someone with a military background tell me if the premise at the beginning - the one that gets him into this mess in the first place - is actually legal? Can your commanding office in the armed forces transfer you to the discretion of an international military branch and force you to join an armed conflict without notifying you beforehand, especially if you aren't even a fighter to begin with?!

 The film really reminded me of a living video game, where Cruise's Marine Corps character keeps trying to find the right method to staying alive, gets killed, comes back and then figures out each time what move he needs to engage in so he can make it to the ""next level"" all with out placing any new quarters in.

 Emily Blunt's ""Full Metal Bitch"" character is strong, very sexually attractive, and tough but I did find her coming off fairly weak drama wise when teamed up with Cruise.

 Very good sci fi action adventure, ""Good guys verses evil aliens"" theme.  B- & thumbs up for ""Live-Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow.",1426896000,,717,4.469230769230769

I recommend it!",1426636800,,262,5.414634146341464
2687204,5,B00006JE59,"And, ironically, it's not because the duct tape shut him up (like I usually wish for). Live, Die, Repeat had all the hallmarks of something I would usually hate - a loud, CGI-laden, testosterone-driven gun fest, not to mention Tom Cruise, who I generally can't stand (sorry). But to my complete surprise, this movie was so good I watched it twice in the same night!

Really. I'm a 36 year-old woman who watches a lot of BBC period dramas and generally sticks to 'funny' sci-fi (like Eureka). This wasn't supposed to be my cup of tea. And I loved this movie.

Because it WAS loud, but in a fun, exciting, roller-coast kind of way. And it WAS a CGI-fest, but it was really well done. Finally - aliens that actually look scary enough that I totally believed we were toast. And instead of a boring 'Terminator-style' movie - where the men fight it out and the pretty girl is pregnant and back at headquarters - in this movie we have a pretty girl who repeatedly, and relentlessly, kicks Cruise's backside to kingdom come. I don't think I've ever been so in awe of a soldier in my life.

Whoever wrote this script had one heck of a sense of humor. I just about busted a gut from the 'duct tape' through the ""What the hell were you thinking?"" scene. This is the BEST Groundhog Day-style movie I have ever seen. It was hilarious, clever, and managed to keep my attention for two hours straight. That's saying a lot, especially since I was totally prepared to hate this movie.

Absolutely EXCELLENT casting. Emily Blunt is just about perfect, and for once Tom Cruise's smugness worked to his advantage. This role was tailor made for him, and it fit him like a glove. Absolutely EXCELLENT script & dialogue - smart, witty, and heartfelt. Absolutely EXCELLENT storyline - a plot that catches your attention and doesn't let go. Absolutely EXCELLENT special effects, with CGI that is believable and enhances the movie rather than dominating it.

What else can I say, except FINALLY - a loud, CGI-laden, testosterone-filled movie that GOT IT RIGHT!",1426636800,,2035,4.657381615598886

2687276,5,B00006JE59,"This good movie isn't a classic, nor will it set any box office records. It's still well worth buying on DVD and well worth watching, but it is worth a moment or two to say farewell to one of the Three Kings of Hollywood. Tom Cruise will probably never sell a movie again just on his fans' desire to see him in ANYTHING. In bad movies, he'll sink. In good movies he'll attract good reviews. Which is nothing - even for Cruise - to be sad about. Nobody stays at the top forever.
HOWEVER, as said earlier, this is a good movie and  a very good solid science fiction adventure. You have human soldiers against mind-blowingly creepy alien invaders. You have time travel, the repeated deaths of heroes Cruise and Emily Blunt, an attempt to save the world, and the faintest hint of a - if not a love story, a like-story between Cruise and Blunt.
Cruise gets the better of the acting honors. As a PR whiz who get shanghaied into fighting a war when he knows nothing about being a soldier, he very adequately conveys the sheer terror this man of words feels when the shooting and dying becomes real. He learns as he goes, which is usually the way it works.
In a variation on ""Ground Hog Day"" Cruise finds himself repeating the human invasion of alien held territory over and over again. Over and over again he is killed, only to return to a point before the battle begins. Why it happens, why it's a key plot point of the movie, and how it involves him in Blunt's ""supersoldier"" effort to fight the war are believable and exciting.
Cruise does a good acting job and Blunt does an effective one. It's Tom's movie, there are no love scenes and Blunt is basically just a soldier throughout the film, but she still is a PRESENCE in the film. There are a lot of pretty actresses working today in film. a few very beautiful ones, but Blunt stands out. It's something about her eyes and those cheekbones. She may be just as shallow as any other Hollywood cutie away from the camera, but the camera seems to tell you there's something more there.
There really is only one gaping hole in the logic of the movie, and it might be explained in the book from which the film was made. But we're never told why PR guy Cruise is grabbed and put down in the middle of a battle where he's almost certain to be killed. Who did he piss off, and why? It hurts the movie a little bit because everything that happens from that point makes no sense, but otherwise this is a well built movie.
See it. Buy it. Even if you're not insanely into Tom Cruise.",1425427200,,2520,4.338983050847458

2687294,5,B00006JE59,"I never heard of this movie until it became available here.  What happened?

All that work and the public isn't informed about it?

Cruise and Blunt worked really well together.  It was a good combo.  But Bill Paxton, he breathed life into that MSG.  He was the spice of the movie.  Cruise's intense performance  carried the movie through.  Blunt's unique look added to character's  pathos relating  to the end of mankind.
The cast was competent but considering the ""repeat"" of the movie, there was very little time and opportunity for their development.

The problem with today's monsters, creatures and aliens is that they movie tooooooo fast!  That speed connotes a fakeness and makes it less realistic.

Very little if any foul language.  No sex scenes, which is always a plus.  Great action with a few comedic moments sprinkled throughout the film and a fleeting touch of romance.

There are a few mistakes regarding addressing officers and other military jargon but it doesn't take away from enjoyment of the film.  And there are a few things that just don't make any sense, but what do you expect when they don't have a script from the get-go?  For example, the creatures are called mimics, but they don't mimic anything... senseless.

Still, an excellent flick compared to the most of the worthless films made today.

It's worth a look.",1425254400,,1344,4.8584070796460175

Director Liman and Stars Cruise, Blunt, Paxton and the rest of the cast and crew did a bang-up job on what I had thought was just Groundhog Day with Guns.  However, Groundhog Day while a lovely movie, never tried to explain why the protagonist was looping, whereas in Edge of Tomorrow the reason for the looping is front and center and indeed becomes a critical plot point later in the movie (no spoilers).  With that and the casting (Cruise does some of his best acting in years and Blunt and Paxton both fully realize their respective characters) plus quite a bit of ridiculously over-the-top Human v. Aliens combat scenes is enough for this to get my vote for best Action Film of 2014.  Well worth the purchase or rental.",1424649600,,811,4.618055555555555

2687563,3,B00006JE59,"****Fair warning as this review contains some major spoilers all throughout****

I recall openly choosing not to even bother with the movie based on the premise essentially just being an action-packed Groundhog Day.  And it is.  But not purely so.  Time only resets whenever Tom Cruise or an Alpha dies, and only through the destruction of the Omega will the resetting end.  On top of that, Tom Cruise gained the same properties as the Alpha after he killed it on his first day and its blood melted his flesh.  It is also because those with the blood of the Alpha can recall events from the previous day that the alien race is going to win the war.  As a result, Tom Cruise must find a way to destroy the Omega to end this cycle, depending on a war hero and designated who once had the same ability to reset time as Tom Cruise (Emily Blunt) must die whenever he so much as suffers a serious injury so as to not lose too much blood.  She's pretty...blunt...about killing him whenever he screws up, which because of this, has some rather comedic effects.

Actually, if you really want to see Tom Cruise die repeatedly, there are some pretty funny ways he actually goes out in this movie.  He's a Major of the army and a coward.  So you definitely get to see where he begins and ultimately how he develops as a character.  The problem, of course, is that because death resets time, and he dies repeatedly, that the film isn't in any way, shape or form, intense.  You're just waiting through death after death after death until he comes across a narrative breakthrough, and then he dies some more.  Oh, yeah!  He does lose the power eventually, but it's only to fuel the stakes of the final assault to take out the Omega once and for all.  That doesn't even matter, however, because he still winds up resetting the past--only this time, the Omega remains destroyed--wait, what!?

Okay, this is my biggest criticism of the film: The time travel mechanic here is inept.  Tom Cruise somehow destroys the Omega, takes in its blood, is reset to the past, and yet the Omega doesn't resurrect with him either?  It probably would have made a bit more sense if this meant that the humans start winning the war, but plan on taking out the Omega instead of the Alpha since their memories would be erased (as the destruction of the Omega resets the entire variable on the war).  But the Omega is already destroyed after time resets for the final time?  Can somebody explain to me how this makes any sense whatsoever?  I feel that this moment alone ruins what was surprisingly an entertaining little flick.  I here people hating on Project Almanac, but frankly, the time travel mechanic is far more plausible and made a ton more sense than it does in Edge of Tomorrow.

Or, here's a better idea: Actually fully kill off Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt!  Resetting the past after the Omega's destroyed just screws over the entire story.  At least it makes their sacrifices noble and because of them that the human race is able to win the war. I know it's just the ending, but the film's credibility is determined by the destination of the journey rather than the journey itself.

As far as brainless entertainments go, it's mildly enjoyable 7 out of 10--though I doubt most people will be wholly capable of checking their brain at the door because suspension of disbelief can only go so far.  As far as credibility goes as a work of art--because I hear nothing but high praises from critics calling this film intelligent (maybe they could explain how the ending makes sense)--I'm giving the film a 4 out of 10 instead.  By Amazon standards, that should balance out as a 3 out of 5.",1423699200,,3658,4.5504587155963305
2687564,5,B00006JE59,"This movie deserved better promotion and marketing. While not a fan of Tom Cruise, I have to say this film is one in which he shines, and Emily Blunt is his perfect foil. In the course of reliving the same terrible day and dying hundred of times in many different ways to change the course of future history, he is transformed from a smarmy, manipulative, parasitic coward to a fatalistic, unstoppable warrior. The course of the action makes this transformation not only feasible, but inevitable.  I certainly never thought I would buy a Tom Cruise movie, but this one is quite, quite perfect.",1423699200,,593,4.757281553398058

2687605,2,B00006JE59,"I didn't really hate this movie but I wasn't too impressed with it either.  I have never been a huge fan of the ""Groundhog's Day"" premise of watching the same day over and over again but the director did a good job of negating as much of the monotony as you can with that hook.  Unfortunately what was behind the hook I found to be a rather generic scifi action movie.  I am a huge fan of scifi action but the whole thing felt cold and lifeless.  It was hard to care too much about the characters or what happen to them after you have seen them die over and over.  The movie has difficulty building a sense of urgency, tension or drama as you are quickly taught not to care about the outcome of any singe event, it can just be relived.  Even when things became truly dire, when the heroes are in the most peril I had spent so much of the movie not caring that I found it natural to continue not caring.  There are decent moments in the movie but my lack of emotional investment killed the experience for me.  Also a note on the special effects; while most of it was stunning their ""jacket"" technology didn't feel very real at all.  While these suits are supposed to enhance their physical abilities the suits the actors had to wear were heavy and cumbersome and it shows.  While wearing them characters lumber about slowly and move their limbs around with a strained awkwardness.  Even when they are performing superhuman feats like moving cars out of the way or leaping great distances they in no way seem to be doing it on their own.  Instead they just look like an overburdened human with off-screen forces doing all the work.  They really needed to find another way to bring these power suits to life if they wanted them to look right.",1423612800,,1739,4.363354037267081

Only complaint is about 10 minutes of VERY dark lit scenes near the end - too dark to make out what's happening. Also, the ending is a bit too tidy of a happy ending.

2687636,3,B00006JE59,"In what seems more like a video game than a movie, Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt (of all people) team up to defeat tentacled space aliens, outfitted in black, cumbersome body armor, shooting it out with them on the battlefield.  This is a high-tech, sci-fi re-creation of the Invasion of Normandy, only our protagonists realize they must attack the enemy at its brain center in order to triumph.  It turns out that the enemy brain center is located in Paris, and so Cruise and Blunt make their way there to save the world.  But only after Cruise pulls a series of ""Groundhog Day"" resurrections, then undergoes fight training, and consults with Emily Blunt and a scientist, who informs him that the aliens can somehow read their minds, giving them virtually no chance of victory.  The movie is long on dazzling special effects and shoot-'em-ups, most of them played out on the battlefield, with tentacled alien creatures bouncing around, and earth defenders in black body armor shooting at them, but very short on character.  Indeed, there is
virtually no character arc here at all.  And although Emily Blunt acquits herself convincingly as a combat-hardened warrior, I'd much rather see this lovely actress doing Shakespeare or Foyle's War, which would allow her true acting talents the latitude they deserve.  The lighting in the last twenty or so minutes of the film is so dark that it is nigh impossible to see who is doing what to whom.  I'm fully cognizant that these blockbuster movies are intended to translate easily to foreign markets, to showcase stars, and to provide massive amounts of work for Hollywood tech crews, all of which is well and good.  But there is something hollow at the core of this entire exercise.  It's all plot and special effects, and little or no character.",1423353600,,1788,4.8519736842105265

2687638,5,B00006JE59,"""Edge Of Tomorrow"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: An alien race has hit the Earth in an unrelenting assault, unbeatable by any military unit in the world. Major William Cage is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission. Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop-forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again...and again. But with each battle, Cage becomes able to engage the adversaries with increasing skill, alongside Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski. And, as Cage and Vrataski take the fight to the aliens, each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating the enemy!

The cast led by Tom Cruise (solid as usual as Major William Cage) & Emily Blunt (also solid as usual as Rita Vrataski) is excellent. The directing by Doug Liman (who also executive produced) is excellent. The screenplay (based on the novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka) by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth & John-Henry Butterworth is excellent.

The music by Christophe Beck is excellent. The cinematography by Dion Beebe is excellent. The film editing by James Herbert & Laura Jennings is excellent. The casting by Lucinda Syson is excellent. The production design by Oliver Scholl is excellent. The art direction by  Ravi Bansal, Alastair Bullock, Mark Harris, Christian Huband, Jason Knox-Johnston, Neil Lamont, Andrew Palmer, Stephen Swain & Gary Tomkins is excellent. The set decoration by Elli Griff is excellent. The costume design by Kate Hawley is excellent. The prosthetic make-up effects supervised by Kristyan Mallett is excellent. The creature designs by Kevin Jenkins & Jared Krichevsky is excellent. The conceptual art designs by Jenkins, Jeff Julian, Simon Lee, Paul Anthony McGill, Ed Natividad, Aaron Sims, Tim Browning, Christopher Brandstrom, Francesco Corvino, Kelton Cram, Jonas De Ro, Tani Kunitake, Magdalena Kusowska, Jon McCoy, Luca Nemolato, Lee Oliver, Steffen Reichstadt, Andrey Ryabovichev, Matthew Savage, Stephen Tappin, Maximilian-Gordon Vogt & Simon Webber is excellent. The special effects coordinated by Jess Lewington & supervised by Dominic Tuohy is excellent. The visual effects coordinated by Eva Abramycheva, Ashley Bellm, Helene Becourt, Ann Chow, Kingsley Cook, Talia Felber, Suzanne Forward, Murray Gale, Sandra Germain, Woojo Leon, Alyse Joseph, Ciaran Keenan, Nancy Lamontagne, Stephanie Muyco, Holly Price, Jeanne-Elise Prevost, Kailin Ryan & John Szebegyinszki and supervised by Gary Brozenich, Nick Davis, Jonathan Fawkner, Christian Kaestner, Matt Kasmir, Daniel Kramer, Matt Middleton, Jose A. Ortiz Jr., Matthew Rouleau & Simon Stanley-Clamp is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Simon Crane & Wade Eastwood is excellent.

This is an excellent, well-crafted and well-made sci-fi action thriller that is entertaining and well-done. Tom Cruise gives another solid performance as Cage & Emily Blunt is just as solid as Rita. Doug Liman has made one of his better movies of recent memory. This is (or was) one of the best action films of 2014 and also was one of the best films of the 2014 summer season, as well, too.",1423353600,,3250,5.366666666666666

2687641,5,B00006JE59,"Edge of Tomorrow is an *extraordinary* science fiction movie!  Usually I end up totally confused while trying to grasp Sci-Fi's I admit because it's a genre way out of my understanding usually, but Edge of Tomorrow manages to be understandable which helps me appreciate the tension and raises my interest in the storytelling dramatically!  It's basically a time travelling film the likes of which we've all seen before in some context (most famously in the classic film Groundhog Day).  This time it's set in the future where aliens have invaded the planet and need to be wiped out.

So the storyline focuses on Tom Cruise - an actor I hated for the longest time but is now seriously starting to win me over with this, Oblivion and *especially* the terrifying War of the Worlds- who continues to fall into a time loop where he keeps going back to the same soldier training room whenever he dies.  Tom and his troop are supposed to drop down and land on a beach and wipe out a bunch of aliens but... it's a suicide mission.  None of the soldiers make it out of there alive.  A particular type of alien has the advanced potential to strategically win wars by knowing what's going to happen ahead of time.  It possesses the time loop ability.  However Tom eventually gains this very same ability which continues to set him back to the same alien battle on the beach over and over again.

Of course as he keeps going back to the same predicament, he remembers/gains knowledge of what happened prior so he's better prepared the next time.  People think he's a psychic who can predict the future.  Of course nobody believes he's been dying over and over again in the same battle.  Who'd believe such a thing?  Would you?  Of course not!  Luckily one particular soldier -Emily Blunt's character- understands this because she experienced the same thing herself.  She's actually been in Tom's shoes before.  From here we see the same scenarios play out similarly with only minor differences as a means to advance the story until Tom Cruise meets his inevitable doom and dies *yet again*.  This happens so many times that when you stop and think about it, we're basically witnessing only 25 minutes worth of actual content since it's basically a cheap way of stretching out a short scenario into a full-lengthy movie.

But... it works!  This time cheapness is a good thing!  Edge of Tomorrow proves that even a science fiction movie can execute wonderfully and flawlessly with the time loop idea.  Of course a movie like this is an acquired taste because we're seeing the same events play out in similar fashion at least 30 times but in slightly different ways as a means to advance the story as I mention above, but I just *love* this kind of storytelling so I don't mind the repetitive nature of the plotline at all.  Emily Blunt constantly kills Tom Cruise because he HAS to die whenever he fails a mission (otherwise he'd receive somebody else's blood in a hospital and lose his time looping ability and thus lose the alien war).  If you're into films like this, I imagine you're probably sitting there on your recliner desperately wishing for a way Tom Cruise can convince his troop that they'd headed for a losing battle on that beach, but of course this hardly ever happens (without spoiling anything).

Overall just a terrific movie.  Tom Cruise going through the same training routines and battle confrontations with the aliens over and over is memorable writing because it's easy to follow, and Emily Blunt shooting and killing Tom's character in graphic point blank fashion is somewhat hilarious I hate to admit.  The atmosphere and some of the special alien effects (such as them popping out of the sand or the appearance of the main alpha alien later on) reminds me of the Metroid Prime series (Nintendo games).  This movie is just awesome on so many levels.  Congratulations Tom Cruise- you are officially likeable now!  I never thought I'd see the day.",1423267200,,3957,4.741228070175438
2687642,5,B00006JE59,"Did you have the feeling that while watching the preview for this film, you started to say to yourself that this reminds you of Tom Cruises last film, Oblivion, or even a little bit of Groundhog Day? Well, do not worry about that as the only thing that Edge of Tomorrow has in common with Oblivion is that Tom Cruise is the lead actor in both filmsand that both of the movies are exceptional. The basic concept used in this films preview could be considered very similar to that of Groundhog Day, but once you watch just ten minutes of Edge of Tomorrow, you will soon forget about any such comparisons. I know this will come to a shock to most us watching either sequels or reboots for what seems like the past two years, but Edge of Tomorrow has a very original and refreshing script that you cannot help but give a double finger pistol salute just like Shooter McGavin after he sinks a crucial putt.

Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are masterful in their roles as Major William Cage and Sergeant Rita Vrataski. Great chemistry between the two and Cruise absolutely nails his timing down perfectly with every little expression that he makes with every character that he interacts with. You want the full package when watching a movie? Then this film should solidify those needs quite well. You have a ton of action going on left and right, an immense and very detailed description of what is exactly going on throughout the film, and just the right amount of comedy used in certain situations, especially from Cruise, that makes this film one hell of a ride.

Essentially, this movie is about Major William Cage being thrown into the front lines of combat between humans and an alien race, even though Cage has no skills, except for Public Relations, whatsoever. Cannot really say much more about this film without giving anything away as the slightest detail could give away some of the plot.

2687644,4,B00006JE59,"There are at least two approaches to making a time travel movie: one in which they don't sweat the details like paradoxes or multiple outcomes (InterStellar); and those in which they pay just enough attention so that you recognize it as probable, (Loopers).  This film is a gem of time travel, a kind of ""Ground Hogs Day"" set in the near future with the very likeable Tom Cruise as a slick ad man in a uniform during a deadly time.  The film cleverly incorporates news footage of the fiery meteorite that lit up the skies of Russia recently, and, the ducking journalist who have covered conflicts in the middle east to introduce the audience quickly and convincingly that the Earth has been invaded by aliens, although this time they can alter time, resetting the start of the that they would have lost the battle/war.  Tom Cruise's character usurps this power when he kills, and is killed by a specialized alien. He is trapped in a Rod Serling recurring nightmare of harrowing experiences on a Normandy Beach invasion that should fulfill most action film buffs and dies repeatedly, only to wake up again at the beginning of the loop.  This plot device, his death and the restart of the day, reminds one of a popular game played on a console where you wear a mechanized suit, drop from a hovering craft and are able to shoot machine guns and canons with either arm/hand.  It is also is very reminiscent of a video game in which there is no consequence for death, just a restart. Tom's character finds a kindred spirit of sorts, Emily Blunt, who had the same power and lost it in a battle field aide station transfusion. Together they work to find the mother alien, buried under the Louvre, and destroy it, saving mankind and in an especially greedy ending, themselves.  I've never counted the number of times that Tom is reincarnated but I have thought about it.  I just get lost in watching a good story and forget about counting, physics and the laws of nature.  His trademark smile, from Risky Business, ends the film.  I have to admit that I've entered a loop with this film and have watched it countless times.  It's entertaining and moves along at a quick pace.",1423180800,,2167,4.619791666666667

I'm here to tell you that this movie is awesome. Surprisingly enjoyable. I can't believe I'm saying this, but this has to be Tom Cruise's best performance in a decade: he plays a character with flaws, noticeable ones, and nails it. Emily Blunt is fabulous, as always, and delivers one hell of a supporting role.

This movie is pure action sci-fi for start to finish. The pacing is excellent, and the cinematics are mind-blowing. The plot is intriguing and doesn't disappoint.

2687661,4,B00006JE59,"Edge of Tomorrow is a sci-fi action flick directed by Doug Liman from a screenplay adapted from the Japanese novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. Earth has been invaded by aliens, fast-moving octopus-like creatures called Mimics, who are laying waste to Europe. The worlds armed forces have combined to fight them, and Operation Downfall is imminent. An army of super-soldiers in powered exoskeletons, like low-rent Ironmen, will be dropped on a beach in France. General Brigham (Brian Gleeson) insists that the militarys PR man, a smooth-talking former advertising man named Maj. William Cage (Tom Cruise), be there to document the invasion. Seeing this as a likely death sentence, Cage tries to get out of it. Brigham ships him, unconscious, to a forward operating base at Heathrow, near London. From there he is dropped into France, where he kills and is killed by a large Mimic called an Alpha. And then he finds himself back at Heathrow the day before.

Edge of Tomorrow is classified as science fiction, because it involves aliens and a time loop, but the action seems to take place in the present or near future. This film strives primarily to be a big spectacle. Its able to do that, and present some semblance of a plot, because the live, die, repeat theme causes the action to repeat itselfwith subtle changes. The audience is on the lookout for what will change with each repetition, so our minds do not wander off every time we see the same battle or conversation again. Its a clever excuse for non-stop action that doesnt seem like one interminable, boring action sequence. Tom Cruise is 52 years old. Fortunately, he can pass for about 35 and has retained most of his on-screen charisma. When I think about it, its amazing that he is still an action star, but I wasn't inclined to think about it while watching the movie. There are puzzling gaps in the story and some things that make little sense, but its entertaining.",1423008000,,1947,4.794642857142857

But Edge of Tomorrow (I'm having none of that ""Live Die Repeat"" rename/re-brand) is a very watchable entry into that sub-set of Sci-Fi, artfully mixing styles: thriller, heroic epic, drama, and action, with a more-than-token and quite workable romantic subplot.  As usual, Cruise wins me over -- despite my less-than-positive reflexive emotional response to him as a person -- with a very solid performance and a character that you grow to empathize with very much by the end.  Very high story quality.  And very low objectionable stuff like heavy gore, disturbing violence*, excessive language, or faxed-in elements like cardboard characters or plot-serving twists.

* granted, this movie has lots of ""sci-fi action/violence"" but I was not aware of very much actual human gore.  One sci-fi-ish face melt that's about 1-2 seconds, not too bad for what it is (nothing like, say, Poltergeist), and it was VERY central to the story.",1422662400,,1038,5.076470588235294

The movie draws you in from the start, aliens attacking earth, the battle to defend it, and an ability (not giving a spoiler since the movie revolves around it) to repeat battles fought knowing the result so they can do it again but win.  Tom Cruise's character gets splattered with the blood of a special type of alien, and because of it, every time he dies, he too now repeats the day, knowing how things will unfold.

2687729,5,B00006JE59,"Theres nothing new in the central premise of this superb movie; science fiction has been messing about with time loops for decades. Its been the stock-in-trade for some of the best Star Trek episodes, there have been some excellent recent films such as Memento & Source Code and Greg Bears splendid Hull Zero Three gives the live, die, repeat theme an original twist. So, what makes this big budget 175 million dollar blockbuster stand out from the crowd? Lots of things, thats what.

Firstly, this is the first sci-fi  film I can think of where Tom Cruise isn't an indomitable action hero from the first scene; here hes an Army PR man (looking alarmingly like Pierce Brosnan) doing all he can to wheedle out of his surprise assignment to the imminent conflict zone. This refreshing lightly comedic, self deprecating tone is a consistent presence throughout the film.

 Secondly, the treatment of the core concept; the countless iterations of the loop as Cruise and Blunt progress incrementally towards their goal are not presented in the Oh no! Not again groundhog repetition format. The viewer is instead presented only with the changes to previous loops, keeping the dialogue and action fresh and, above all, engaging.

 This segues nicely to the next point. Doug Limans direction is superb; the pace and tension are deftly managed from beginning to heart-thumping finale, just what youd expect from the man responsible for the first three (and best) Bourne films. Finally, no review of a modern sci-fi motion picture would be complete without a passing mention of the special effects. They are superb, from the battle suit design, through the Private Ryanesque beachhead sequences to the incredible alien masses of tentacles. Im not quite sure why the aliens are called Mimics though; they never seem to do any, but perhaps its a plot device to keep the audience guessing about the nature of the main protagonists.

To summarise, this is an absolutely splendid movie and one well definitely re-watch many times.",1422144000,,2015,5.014970059880239

1. Intriguing--and well-executed--plot idea with a nice, quirky fight-the-aliens spin. I bought it, no problem.

2. Intentional humour--sometimes achieved through film editing. Cruise's knee-knocking character is a kick. Film blew me away in the nicest fashion!

3. Effects are damn good.

Good one for Tom Cruise, who, frankly, needs a good one at this point (and a much more viscerally satisfying Sci Fi film than his previous one, aptly titled Oblivion. Lemme think now, what was that one about...?)  Box-office reflects this: Oblivion took in less than $100 million.  Edge of Tomorrow, as of this writing, almost FOUR TIMES that amount.

It's not a ""come back"" film (but then, not sure the man really needs one)--and not on par with some of the spectacular stuff the star is associated with for all time (Risky Business, Top Gun, Born on the Fourth of July, Jerry Maguire, Rain Man), but, heck, that's damning with faint praise.

2687758,4,B00006JE59,"Popcorn entertainment done especially well, Edge of Tomorrow is one of Doug Liman's best films (along with the underrated Go and The Bourne Identity, the best film of that increasingly confusing and chaotic series). In a futuristic world, aliens set their sights on Europe. A general (played by the terrific Brendan Gleeson) plans a surprise assault in France. He wants to catch the extraterrestrial creatures off guard, and he enlists the talents of Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) to go to the front lines, document the war, and sell it to the public. Cage is very hesitant, but is forced to relent against great pressure. He ends up in a time loop, living through the same traumatic morning over and over again (the comparisons to Groundhog Day have been constant, but are apt). Every morning, he prepares for battle with Master Farell, an intense and brutal sergeant played by Bill Paxton.

Emily Blunt (the best part of the overrated Looper) plays an elite soldier named Rita Vrataski, and she adds much needed diversity to this heavily male-dominated cast (in a heavily male-dominated genre). Her performance recalls the work of Sigourney Weaver in the Alien films and Sandra Bullock in Gravity; she's that good. She's never just there to be eye candy, and (perhaps because of their age difference) Liman never tries to force a romantic subplot (although she and Cruse awkwardly and superfluously kiss at one point).

Many have wondered if Tom Cruise's days as a huge movie star are over. Is he too old to be a convincing action hero? Are his best days behind him? Is his strong faith in Scientology too controversial and polarizing? I don't know the answer to these questions, but whatever you think of Cruise or his faith, he is a true movie star and is not so much an everyman (like Harrison Ford) as the man every man wishes he could be: on screen, he projects charm, charisma, generosity, and strength.

The film is not without its problems. The alien-on-human fight sequences are entertaining, and the special effects are very strong, but the lack of backstory for the alien characters is a little frustrating. They're just a bunch of creatures who want to take over the world, and that's not original or interesting enough to make compelling villains. Still, Liman has learned a lot about science fiction since his dreadful 2008 film, Jumper. He understands that setpieces need to be strong, but the performers and the script need to be even stronger, and here he succeeds where that earlier effort failed. Cruise, Blunt, Liman, and a better than average script based on Hiroshi Sakurazakas All You Need Is Kill help elevate Edge of Tomorrow into very worthwhile viewing.",1421798400,,2684,4.894505494505495

2687769,3,B00006JE59,"Acting is ok.  The story line is full of plot holes.  Without spoilers - there is inconsistency in the movie's rules for time travel - esp. the last scene where the protagonists are mysteriously flung back to the beginning of the movie.  The battle strategy is positively archaic - the director just flung the infantry at a clearly superior enemy without any use of  naval or air power (or reason for not using) to pre-'soften' the battle arena; given the battle scene location there is plenty of historical precedent for strategizing the beach battle scene (think Normandy).  There is no reason for General Brigham to keep a vital device in his personal safe.  The special effects were 4 or 5 star.

The movie story line has lots of unrealized potential.  There were excellent actors with plenty of well demonstrated acting ability.  The director did not take advantage of the acting potential.",1421625600,5,895,4.874172185430464

2687788,4,B00006JE59,"This review is strictly for those wishing to purchase the 3D version of the film. I have dozens of 3D features with a top notch state of the art plasma display, so I know what looks good and what appears to be diminished viewing, As I have viewed this feature in 2D and 3D I can report that the 2D looks spectacular with a correct color palette with perfectly acceptable sharpness.
The 3D version has considerably more grain which makes the image slightly sharper for 3D viewing with active glasses. The downside is that the entire image appears yellowish (especially noticeable in skin tones) with color hues noticeably less saturated. The fact I am conscious of these elements does not detract from the enjoyment of the film once you accept the fact it is what it is. But those customers expecting the image to simply be a 3D reproduction of the 2D may be disappointed.
In general, the 3D imagery is pretty good. The 3D during the newscast montage in the beginning of the film pops in and out which is understandable since the filmmakers intentionally used real war/meteor news footage to add some realism to the invasion. Once the movie is underway with Cage on route to London the image looks fine throughout with only occasional ghosting.
It is my hope that most purchasers of 3D features will try and detail their experience so those of us who actually crave the experience can make better and more informed choices.
Personally I loved the film having only experienced the theatrical release in 2D...really looked forward to the 3D release.",1421366400,,1546,4.75092936802974

2687795,5,B00006JE59,"What can I say that others haven't?  It's a great movie.  While its the same premise as Looper the direction and pacing is much better done and there's lots of dark humor.  I have really disliked Tom Cruise's movies in recent years as they have seemed to have the similar theme of 'Look, I'm Tom Cruise and this is how awesome I am!'.  In Edge of Tomorrow he does play a similar character to most of his other movies but what's different here is Cruise's character of Cage actually has an arc.  We get to watch him go from cowardly PR guy to genuine self-sacrificing hero and it's much more rewarding as the character earns his hero status.  Emily Blunt plays Rita perfectly and she is the real key to Cage's growth and development into a real soldier.  And not through the standard trope of 'You make me want to be a better man,' but through training him, genuinely pushing him, sometimes shooting him in the head (which is awesome) and being the better soldier.  Rita's character is definitely the more hardcore of the two and the movie respects the character.  This should be a given in a movie but let's face it; Hollywood so often gets Strong Independent Woman horribly wrong.  It's a shame this movie did so badly at the box office because it's a gem.  I rented it, I'm now buying it and you should at least give it a chance.  You won't be disappointed.",1421280000,,1359,4.435483870967742

This is not a sci-fi film that provokes some interesting thoughtas do the bestbut its fun.  No obligatory sex, poop-humor, or blackboard lectures (as there are in so many films this year.)

But weapons designers really need to do something about the short battery-life of military robots of the future. Im no expert, but I think many battles might last longer than fifteen minutes or so.  Youd think someone might have spotted that flaw early in the testing stage.  Also those arm-mounded machine guns shoot a lot of bullets.  A second clip might not be a bad idea.  Then again, if you fire a few hundred large-caliber rounds per minute for ten minutes or so, plus rockets and grenades, youve got to wonder what all that ammo weighs.  Which explains the short battery-life, I suppose.",1420675200,,1286,4.912037037037037

2687915,4,B00006JE59,"I had zero desire to see this film in the theater and that's because the promotion was kind of dull and Tom Cruise films like Oblivion and War of the World's were bleh, but I took a chance on this and to my surprise I liked it. Tom actually plays a different kind of character you don't typically see from him. Usually Tom has to be the cocky hero, but this time his character starts off as a coward. He's no right out of the gate tough guy Jack Reacher. Also Emily Blunt's character is an excellent and equally dominant player in this film. Usually there really is no room in a film for anyone else thanks to Tom's ego/Napoleon complex but Emily's character is so good that she is hugely responsible for how good this film turned out to be. I'm telling you if you felt burned this movie season by films like Godzilla and Mocking Jay (was definitely dull) and rolled your eyes during Divergent and Age of Extinction (terrible even by Michael Bay standards) you might want to give this film a chance.",1420416000,,999,4.376344086021505

2687982,5,B00006JE59,"I am not a Tom Cruise fan and sci-fi isn't really high on my list to watch, so it was only when my brother recommended it that I decided to give it a try. And I am so glad I did because it was great! It helps not to know the entire plot beforehand, but even if you do, it is an extremely entertaining movie. It is surprisingly funny, and while it borrows from some of the sci-fi movies I actually like (Aliens, etc,) it does so in a self-mocking, humorous way. It's a cross between Groundhogs Day and Aliens but with more than enough originality. And yes, I just loved Tom Cruise in this. Still don't care for him personally, but who cares. He does great in this move, as does Emily Blunt. And of course, Bill Paxon is great- you can almost imagine him as a grown-up version of Pvt. Hudson from Aliens! Definitely recommend!",1420329600,,824,4.254777070063694
2687983,5,B00006JE59,Almost to sci-fi-y for most.  Very good though.  I really enjoy a story that leaves me asking so many thought provoking questions and lets me choose how it ends.,1420329600,,161,4.517241379310345

2687991,4,B00006JE59,I enjoyed this movie as it seems a thought provoking plot.  Considering the limitations of a 2 hour movie they did a good job getting the idea across that repeating the same situations with minor changes could end up with huge changes in outcome.,1420243200,,246,4.590909090909091

2687993,5,B00006JE59,"I'm a sci-fi buff, and I consider this the best sci-fi movie in the last five years - at least. It is tight, explores complex and interesting concepts, uses CGI creatively to advance the story, and never, ever drags.

Some backstory - I read Starship Troopers about forty years ago, and since then I've read Armor (John Steakley), Forever War (Joe Haldeman), Old Man's War (John Scalzi) and other related ""super soldier"" books. I also read the book on which this movie is based, called ""All You Need is Kill"". Plus, I've played Halo for ten years and read many of the books in that universe.

From that experience, I know that super-soldier stories are going to have some overlap and inspiration from earlier ones (well, perhaps except Starship Troopers, which basically founded the genre). So it does not bother me to see echoes of other works in this movie.

I'm also not bothered by the clear inspiration of video games, in which players try and try again, with respawn after death, until a difficult task is achieved.

All of these inspirations are nicely tied into one integrated storyline, and none of them are belabored. The story has a crisp intro to set up the alien invasion, and then a clever means to insert the main character into the counter-invasion. That part was not in the original book, and was a well done dramatic intro for the main character.

In fact, this is one of the few movies I've ever seen that is better than the book. The mechanism used to cause the time loop is different, and better, for example.

One of the measures by which I judge a really good movie is whether I want to see it again. Only about one out of ten movies pass that test. I've seen this one three times so far, and I'll likely watch it a few more times.

I think Hollywood critics are just determined to see Tom Cruise movies fail, and that's a shame in this case. If you're tired of superhero movies but still want something with lots of action, and you like sci-fi at all, I suggest you give this one a try.",1420243200,,2010,4.475409836065574
