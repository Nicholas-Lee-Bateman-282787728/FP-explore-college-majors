8087518,5,B000BJNUJS,"This documentary is spectacular and heart-rending.  I think it should be seriously considered for viewing by all Americans on the 100th anniversary of the start of hostilities in World War I.  A group of brave, patriotic Americans had to FIRST fight Jim Crow and upfront bigotry in U.S. before they could fight and die in WWI.  I am a Vietnam veteran and a retired small town lawyer who has seen a lot of life, but this film moved me to tears.  My recommendation is that all those of us who love this country and who revere the ideals on which it was founded should get a copy of this film, watch it several times, and show it to family and friends [as I have].  The stories that I listened to on film might also be appropriate for teaching units on race or civil rights or American history.  It seems inconceivable that our brothers of color should have to fight U.S. Marines at night in France to stay alive and to earn a chance to die in battle -- as thousands of them did.  Yet, the graciousness of the survivors in relating this story speaks volumes about class and grace under pressure.",1403913600,6,1092,4.402985074626866
8087519,4,B000BJNUJS,"First-class documentary on World War I's 369th Infantry Regiment (originally the 15th New York), also known as the Harlem Hellfighters and the Rattlesnake Regiment. They fought the the racism of the Army establishment from the earliest formation of the unit, through training (at a camp in Spartanburg, SC) and then posting to France, where they were initially given menial tasks such as stevedores and porters. Eventually they were assigned to fight under command of the French, who had no prejudice against black soldiers fighting alongside whites, and the 369th became the most decorated American unit in WWI. Their regimental band also became world-famous under the leadership of James Reese Europe, whose music and career were featured in Ken Burns' JAZZ. Europe and the Hellfighters Band are often credited with introducing jazz to the continent.",1182124800,8,852,5.365671641791045
