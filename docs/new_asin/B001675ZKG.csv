The picture quality sucks I can say that I have a true HD TV and this looks horrible on it also it shows in 16:9 which means a lot of black space the bigger TV is.
I don't know why a lot of older TV shows have not been transferred to blu ray yet but this is a good entertaining show keep my attention for all four seasons.",1392508800,,634,3.8473282442748094
3153667,4,B001675ZKG,Love the dvd set. Just what i was looking for. Bought it brand new. No scratches no dents no complaints.,1391990400,,104,4.25
3153668,5,B001675ZKG,It's the best!! The whole series of this great family show! I love the way the movie was made into a series. So sad when it was over!,1390867200,,133,3.7857142857142856
3153669,5,B001675ZKG,Love this show! It is so sad the shows of today have not exceeded the content or quality of this show. I would like to say R.I.P James Avery. James Avery was a wonderful actor. I was so happy to see him play Damon's father at the start of season 2.  Judge Carter in season 1 had a small part in 1 episode of the season and when I saw him I thought back then why didn't' James Avery for this part. I was so delighted to see James Avery as the replacement. I am glad to have this series on dvd however after watching this DVD series some episodes appeared to be missing some scenes so it is definitely edited in season 2-5. It is not as bad as the versions on BET/Centric. It would have been nice to see extras or deleted scenes. I also wished they would have made all seasons either full screen or wide screen. As another reviewer pointed out the final season is wide screen however the picture is grainy. Stretching the video to appear as widescreen compromised the quality of the picture. I played the disc in my blu-Ray player and I also have an HDTV. The picture was still grainy on the screen. I wish the was an option to buy this series on blu-Ray.  Even with the disc quality compromised in the final season the show deserves 5 stars. The final episode was a bit rushed but at least the fans were given some closure. It would be nice to see a soul food reunion show or perhaps bring back the show with a new cast focusing mostly on the Chadway and Van Adam family since the kids are adults now probably of college age. There is still more to be told about this family of matriarch and patriarchs.,1388707200,3,1602,4.1980519480519485
3153670,5,B001675ZKG,This series is fabulous! I love the characters and crazy story lines and dirty little secrets that pick up where the movie takes off.,1384819200,,133,4.583333333333333
3153671,5,B001675ZKG,"Every episode leaves you wanting to see more.  I have watched the entire series now and it was great.  Story lines hit on many issues that's real to life.  Thought compelling to know family drama is not so bad after all and with love, you can make it through anything as a family.  Stick together folks and keep the soul food dinners going.",1366329600,,340,4.349206349206349

3153673,5,B001675ZKG,Soulfood is really good for the soul and I thank Kenneth (Babyfaced)Edundson and TracyEdmundson for writing and producing the show for truning the movie into a tv mini series bring it to are homes and as we watch the show we learn a lot and grow from it and its real life bring families together to teach us about love for one another how to stay strong no matter how bad things are its to be there for one another.,1362873600,,415,4.2
