1418408,4,B00005AUJH,"Less known that Allen's ""Annie Hall"", ""Hannah and her Sisters"", ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", and ""Manhattan"", ""Alice"" is a charming and delightful film that can be viewed as Allen's remake of ""Juliet of Spirits"" with some obvious themes from ""Alice in Wonderland"". Mia Farrow plays a wealthy New Yorker who one day feels that something is missing in her sheltered and comfortable life. She turns to a Chinese doctor whose magic herbs help her to reevaluate her life and her relationships with her husband, lover, mother, and sister. She may not find the answers for all the questions but she certainly learned a lot about herself. During the few days that film takes place, Alice experiences romance, finds spirituality, and even enjoys the power of invisibility. This film has one of the most optimistic endings in Woody's film. Mia Farrow is absolutely wonderful.",1168387200,4,863,5.084507042253521
1418409,4,B00005AUJH,"I bought this film after seeing it many times over the years. It's a wonderful take on Alice in Wonderland, Woody Allen style. Fine acting, the usual glammny NYC scenes, and a fantasy any woman can relate to.",1151193600,,208,4.5
1418410,4,B00005AUJH,"Mia Farrow plays a repressed Catholic rich girl who as a child had ideals of helping the poor, becoming a nun, etc., but ends up marrying the very wealthy William Hurt. Out go the ideals and in come the closets full of clothes and pedicures. She thinks she's happy until she meets Joe (Joe Mantegna), a saxophone player, and begins an affair with him. All the while she keeps going to a Chinese doctor who gives her herbs - love potions, something to make her invisible, etc. While invisible, she discovers that Joe is still in love with his ex-wife and Hurt is having affairs himself. (As in DR.JEKYLL & MR. HYDE, the fact that a drug is used as a key element for her transformations weakens the reality and dilutes the impact of the truths discovered.) In one especially funny scene, a love potion that will make anyone who takes it feel in love with her is accidentally mixed in the egg nog at a party, and every man suddenly becomes interested in her. In a rather hokey ending for Woody Allen, Farrow decides to follow her earlier ideals and is seen helping the poor in NYC. The movie is very funny in spots, but not so good in others. The use of the song LIMEHOUSE BLUES is put to very good effect throughout the movie.",1141430400,4,1224,4.39647577092511
1418411,5,B00005AUJH,"This movie was made in the 1989-1990 period. Woody Allen was already an experienced film director and actor. Stas Mia Farrow in the title role of Alice, and Joe Montegna as the lover. Woody Allen does not appear in this film as he is only a director but there is a load of cameos from stars such as Cybil Shepherd and Bernadette Peters in the comedic role of the Muse. Woody Allen's intellectual/philosophical, life affirming comedies have always been effective and successful- Annie Hall, Zellig, A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy, Hannah and Her Sisters, etc. Alice is a modern day and more adult version of ""Alice In Wonderland"" where it gets its name. Alice is a seemingly happy, married woman living in Manhattan, New York City. The illusion of happiness soon wears off as she discovers her husband, a stockbrocker, played by William Hurt, is cheating on her. Soon enough, she is cheating on him with Joe Montegna's character, a saxophone jazz musician.
The reality of this film, which lies in the complicated adult affairs, including marital infidelity, and the urban scenes of New York City, are contrasted but mingled effectively with the ""magic"" that is dominant in the film. Alice is consulting a spiritual Oriental doctor who gives her all sorts of herbs and potions, including one which renders her invisable. The scene in which she and Joe Montegna are invisible in the women's clothes store is hilarious. Joe Montegna sneaks into a fitting room to spy on a model dressing. ""There's a lot of heavy breathing coming from in here"" says the model. Meanwhile Alice overhears her friends talking about her behind her back. Ultimately, Alice must make a choice. She has the cure for her problem. A love potion. But will she select her husband or her lover ? Her decision is unexpected and maybe even a bit off-putting to some viewers who would have preferred she remain in the realm of humans and romantic affairs and materialism. The movie had been going this way until the decision which is to reject worldliness and Mia Farrow is inspired by the humanitarian and noble work of Mother Teresa. I feel that it's at least true to Mia Farrow's real life nature. She is notorious for adopting many foreign children from war-torn and poverty stricken countries. This movie is still very good and I really enjoyed it. The witty script by Woody Allen and his position as director and Mia Farrow's husband is also very effectiive. It's a great film by a master of comedy that makes you think. If only this movie was available on DVD here.",1089158400,6,2535,4.776765375854214
1418412,5,B00005AUJH,"Alice starts harmlessly enough as we meet her, a dissatisfied NY housewife married to a wealthy banker. The fun starts when she goes to a Chinese doctor (played by a brilliant actor, whose name I cannot remember) and he gives her various remedies to her problems. This kind of plot could easily fall into caricature and cliche but miraculously doesn't. The cast play their parts subtly and honestly, and support the movie's delicate frame. Mia is enchanting as Alice (and I don't usually feel this way about her). This quiet film is one that stays with me. Each time I see it, I enjoy it more.",1013472000,5,593,4.60377358490566
1418413,3,B00005AUJH,"In Wonderland? This is the story of a mid-life crisis Mia Farrow, who, as Alice, the wife of a rich designer, played by William Hurt, has given up her own career and spiritual impulses a long time ago.
She now devotes herself to the frenetic passivity of her glamorous but rather humdrum Park Avenue existence - a wonderland of health fads, plastic surgery, extramarital affairs, gossip, with over-expenditure on everything from cuddly toys to personal masseuses and physical fitness trainers.
Alice soon meets the mysterious Dr Yan, and is therby introduced to a yet another wonderland of magic drugs that enable her, by turns, to don the cloak of invisibility, summon up ghosts from the past, make anyone fall in love with her, and generally see through the lies and hypocrisy of her life.
Despite these rich ingredients, the central theme of the movie owes more to the dourness of Ibsen's ""A Doll's House"" than to the unrestrained fantasy of Lewis Carroll's work. Allen's Alice is in fact Nora, a faithful wife and, with the help of maids, and, with the help of babysitters, a devoted mother. Beneath the surface, however, she feels stifled and deeply unhappy.
Having examined her life with the help of Dr Yan, the catalyst to changing it is Joe, a sleazy, divorced sax player, who enflames her passions, triggers off her catholic guilt feelings, and has her frantically trying to find out what her life meant, means, and will mean. She rushes around seeking answers, discovering her husband with another woman, and finding out, after a short affair, that Joe still loves his ex-wife.
All this is very entertaining, but what follows is a disappointment.
Alice decides to leave her husband, go off to Calcutta, meet Mother Teresa, and basically turn over a whole new leaf, wiping the slate clean, and living the complete antithesis to her former life by devoting herself to the poor and turning her back on all her old comforts.
This is no doubt supposed to be a warm-hearted ending with Alice ""finding herself as a woman and an individual"" and acting out a few other cosy, well-worn cliches that have crawled off the couches of New York analysts.
But just as her former life was perhaps too shallow, material, and hypocritical, her new life is too profound, spiritual, and sincere. There is a coldness in the emotional amnesia with which she excludes her husband from her new life, and a fleshlessness in the spirituality with which she turns her back on all men...
The character of Joe shows a more welcome attitude to life, an attitude that embraces life with all its contradictions, obligations, nostalgias, and emotion.
If there is any emotional centre to this film, it is not to be found in the main character.",1011484800,5,2718,4.834763948497854
1418414,5,B00005AUJH,"A great rainy day movie. It is a rare gem of a movie. Great story. Enough said,get it watch it and tell your friends.",1004832000,2,117,3.9166666666666665
1418415,4,B00005AUJH,"While I gave this film a 4 star rating, I have to say that it is one of the films I watch repeatedly.  In ""Alice,"" Woody Allen has taken his cue from Fellini's ""Juliet of the Spirits"" and assembled a better story and superior film.
The story of a disenchanted housewife finding her real desires and discovering the truth about her pampered but sterile existence is unfolded with such joy and air-light humor that I couldn't help but be charmed.  The concept of self discovery after years of self delusion was explored in more somber ways in Allen's ""Another Woman.""  Here, the use of magic potions are administered ostensibly to relieve Alice's psychosomatic discomforts.  The cures actually allow the character vehicles for seeing her life from new perspectives.
Alice's descent into Wonderland is a great escape, very entertaining.  Her character is an upper crust variation on ones she's done in other Allen films, but Farrow shows her range when, in the script's moment of intoxication, she moves in a split second from mousy uncertainty to voluptuous seductress.  The humor is mostly character-driven and this mousse of a confection is a great way to remove oneself from the stresses of a long week.",1004486400,15,1204,4.935643564356436
1418416,5,B00005AUJH,When I begin to miss NY I watch Woody Allen's Manhattan. The beginning pictorial in black and white is truly worth watching. Woody has a such a comical way of looking at life and all our crazy ways. He allows me to laugh at myself. We can all relate to the people in this movie. His stories always leave me smiling. I can't wait to watch it again . . . it is like visiting old friends.,997574400,2,385,4.012987012987013
1418417,3,B00005AUJH,"Review of Alice
Hot Toasty Rag, September 17, 2017

When I first saw Alice, I didn't know it was a Woody Allen movie, but I can imagine if Id been expecting the usual stammering joke fest, I might have wondered where Woodys influence went. He doesnt always make strict comedies, though, and this movie proves it.

Mia Farrow and William Hurt are married, have two children, and live the high-life. But Mia, in the title role, is unsatisfied and she doesnt know why. She visits a Chinese acupuncturist to help with some back pain and enters a journey of self-discovery.

Mia does a wonderful job in this slightly off-beat flick. Just as in The Purple Rose of Cairo when she rises above an unhappy marriage and finds herself, she expresses curiosity, sadness, hope, and invigoration all at the right times. I happen to be a Mia Farrow fan, so I was expecting to like this movie, but my mom doesnt like her nearly as much as I do, and she still really enjoyed Alice. As always in Woody Allen movies, theres a large cast, and this one includes Alec Baldwin, Blythe Danner, Cybill Shepherd, Joe Montegna, June Squibb, Julie Kavner, Bernadette Peters, Gwen Verdon, and Bob Balaban. Alice is thoughtful and sweet, and a great movie to watch when you're pondering the universe.",1505606400,,1269,4.681614349775785

1418420,5,B00005AUJH,"All I can say is that I want to visit Dr. Yang and get him to prescribe some herbs for me! What a delightful film ALICE is and all her adventures down the ""rabbit hole."" Mia Farrow gives such a great performance in the title role. She's sweet, sexy, funny, heartbreaking, reflective, childlike, thoughtful, real, while on her herb induced life experiences and is reborn at the end to totally reinvent herself as the woman she was always meant to be. I was enchanted by Woody Allen's fantasy film and admire his wit and cleverly written dialogue. The set designs, the costumes, the location shooting in NY, the glorious selections of music and the performances from the entire cast make the film a total delight. I loved all the bittersweet scenes where Alice gets to revisit a past boyfriend who has passed away and the moments reflecting with her deceased mother. We can all learn a valuable lesson watching Alice in her Wonderland adventures. Reflect on your life: past, present and future. Don't take anything for granted. Stand in your own truth to find your joy and happiness!",1489622400,2,1081,4.75531914893617

1418429,3,B00005AUJH,"Decades ago, watching Woody Allen go through his routines at night with Johnny Carson, I thought he was the funniest, smartest person on TV. His movies never impressed me as much, but he could still make me laugh. But years later, the whole lurid business with Mia farrow's adopted Korean daughter hit the news. Ever since, I've been totally turned off by the very idea of Woody Allen. I ventured seeing Alice only because he never appears in the movie. Well, not directly, anyway. Being the scriptwriter and director, his presence is hard to miss. That's particularly so with Mia's Alice character. Not only does she talk and joke like Allen, her mannerisms, her very core are Allen fakes. I have no idea if I would have enjoyed the movie had I seen it in the 1970s or early '80s. But I can't pretend I liked it today. How much of this is it the result of feelings that have little to do with a fair evaluation of his professional work and much to do with my views of his personal life? I don't know. I decided to rate Alice with three stars hoping that my personal feelings did not overwhelm my critical judgment.",1479513600,,1115,4.470588235294118

Some of Allen's charm (his love affair with NYC, cinematography, his accurate capture of the lives of the wealthy, twists and turns of a well-timed plot) but the Chinese stuff is terribly hokey (really, an opium den? inauthentic Chinese accent, a clean Chinatown yeah right). Mia Farrow is good and luminous but sounds like she is channeling Allen in her verbal style. Like some of Allen's movies, the style wins out over the content, even if many elements are well done. Classic Allen though in the scene where everyone has drunk the egg nog (=kool aid). But I wish I had spent my time on something more substantial.",1477612800,2,637,4.696428571428571

1418454,5,B00005AUJH,"Many people have read ""Alice in Wonderland."" Many have seen the Disney version. Many never saw the tale told the way Woody Allen tells it. In ""Alice"", Mia Farrow plays a housewife who feels spiritually empty in the heart of N.Y.C. She ultimately meets a spiritual healer and that meeting causes her to fall down a proverbial rabbit-hole. For once, the story is told in a different way with a housewife standing in for the young girl of Lewis Carroll's famous work. The story is also told with fantastic wonder and from the viewpoint of our main character, leaving us wondering what she will discover next from scene to scene. We don't know what'll happen until it happens. This is not like any of Woody Allen's previous work or the work that came after as none of them were based on a piece of literary work or told it in a different way. A definite change of pace and an antidote to all the predictable, mindless drivel that's been polluting the cinemas lately.",1425254400,2,962,4.566473988439307

To hear Mia Farrow's cook (in the movie) remind her that they are out of free range chicken is a hoot because this was back in the early 90's and there is a health consciousness running thru it as just one of it's themes.

While I, admittedly, have not seen every creative endeavor Mia Farrow has been involved in, I have not been especially impressed with what I have seen.  I have however, admired her delicate beauty, her choice in mothers, her strong sense of family and her many years of good works for the benefit of the peoples of the world.  I cannot state with any conviction that she is/has been an actress (in my opinion) of any really redeeming quality.  I have always thought she was like some insipid Barbie doll, but not as sassy or sexy.  I do consider Woody Allen to be a comic genius.  I used to wonder what they ever got together for.  Now, I know.  I believe they came together for the sole purpose of collaborating on this wonderful film.  I exaggerate, of course.  In truth, however,  ""Alice"" was absolutely made for the talents. (and yes, Virginia, she does have talents) of Ms Farrow.  Her performance in this witty film is perfect!  She is, all at once, baffled, sexy, sly, beleaguered, put upon and, absolutely incredible!  Together, Ms Farrow and Woody have created a film of such depth and brilliance it is like a cinematic epiphany.  Not only is there so much going on that you have to watch it multiple times to catch some of them, but, the film and the performances by all of the cast, warrant at least a second viewing.  No more will I sally forth into the world and bad mouth Mia.  I state here and now, Mia Farrow has got to be one of the most versatile actresses of our generation.  I'm not sure why she didn't make her talents known sooner, but I have become a huge fan.  I am going to re-watch all of her former endeavors and search for signs of life!  I know that her personal relationship with Woody was just a rotten injustice, but when I watch Ms Farrow flirting with Joe Montanga about a sax reed, I am absolutely certain that there was a time when love and respect was way up there in the relationship between Farrow and Allen.  It can certainly be seen in this gem of a film.  Woody knew what he was doing when he cast Mia in the lead.  What a partnership!  In this instance, they were certainly perfect for one another",1388534400,,2209,4.410891089108911
1418484,5,B00005AUJH,"i think mia farrow has been very underrated as an actress. perhaps her best role in an allen film was BROADWAY DANNY ROSE but this one is an awfully close second. she is very luminous throughout and carries through as the lead throughout its entire arc.  allen has a very deft hand at portraying women.  his script captures perfectly a woman who has everything and does nothing. worse yet, she was raised a catholic (true for farrow herself) and her doing nothing plays on her guilt from catholicism.  there is even a great scene she has in an old time confessional.

the film uses a fantasy element to make it possible for alice to learn and discover things.  she sees a chinese herbalist and each herb combo she takes gives her special powers.  she has great invisibility scenes.  but my very favorite scenes are with her dead boyfriend, played by alec baldwin.

alice does fall down the rabbit hole in this film but she does surface to do something. woody allem has well observed a vacuuous life transformed by magic and yearning.

Enchanting surprise goes on fantasy tangents, plays with Catholic (as opposed to Jewish) guilt, examines values.

1418516,4,B00005AUJH,"The story or premise of `Alice' is quite simple, but Woody Allen's construction of the film and exploitation of the plot is far from it.  Yes, `Alice' tells the story of a spoiled socialite who realizes that her life is far from a happy one despite all the so-called perks she receives and so she goes on a journey of self discovery that eventually ends in her happiness.  Like I said, we've seen this before, but we have never seen it displayed in this manner.

Mia Farrow stars as Alice, and she pretty much reprises her role in Allen's superior `The Purple Rose of Cairo', playing her character somewhat mousy and underappreciated.  The difference of course lies in her characters social status (Alice is wealthy, Cecilia was not) but Farrow's approach to character is very much the same.  So Alice is married to Doug, a successful business man who doesn't seem to have too much time for Alice.  When a back pain sends her to Dr. Yang, an acupuncturist who doesn't really do any puncturing, Alice gets the right dose of medicine to help her see that her pains are more mental than physical.  Her life is not what she intended and it is up to her to change things.  Throughout the course of her self discovery she finds herself in the arms of another man and spying on her husband's extramarital affairs with the aid of some herbs that make her invisible.

Yes, `Alice' goes there.

The film is outlined like your typical Allen film.  People converse as if they were not on camera and banter back and forth about seemingly uninteresting topics that in the end prove to be all the more interesting to us because they are not what we expect to hear.  Much like `The Purple Rose of Cairo' though, this film is tailored more towards the acceptance of the general public.

In other words; you don't have to be a fan of Woody Allen to enjoy this film.

Like I mentioned, Farrow pretty much reprises her previous role here, but her character is endearing and likable with all her ignorant quirks.  William Hurt is effective as her unfaithful husband and Keye Luke is funny as her overly wise doctor.  Joe Mantegna is the big standout for me.  His portrayal of Joe, the married man for whom Alice falls, is spot on perfect.  We can see why she is attracted to him.  He is handsome and he is sensitive and he is sweet, but he is unfailingly a man and his faults shine through to create a likable and relatable character.  Judy Davis, Blythe Danner and even Alec Baldwin all contribute fine performances as well, but they are not given anything memorable to really work with.

In the end `Alice' is a nice break from the norm in regard to its unique blend of storytelling.  It is not Allen's best; it's not even really close, but it is undoubtedly Allen and it benefits from his visionary style of directing.",1221091200,6,2800,4.524850894632206
1418517,3,B00005AUJH,"Alice Tate (Mia Farrow) is living in New York City, married to Doug (William Hurt), a rich and successful businessman from a prosperous family. They have two children, a lavish condo and a large stable of servants. Alice spends her days shopping, getting manicures and pedicures, and so on. However, she's not very happy, and in searching for the reason for her unhappiness she has become a bit of a hypochondriac. When she finally goes to see an acupuncturist, Dr. Yang (Keye Luke), on several friends' advice because her back is bothering her, he tells her that her problem is in her head, not her back. Through his extremely unorthodox treatments, Alice gradually transforms her life.

This is a Woody Allen film, but Woody doesn't appear in it. It focuses on Mia throughout, with various literary allusions, mostly to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), but also in ways to A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens (1843) in the way ghosts and memories from the past arrive to deliver their epiphanies. Alec Baldwin is a former lover with a brief turn as one such ghost.

Though Woody isn't in the film, and it is all about Alice (or Mia Farrow, as the case may be) it is as if he is speaking through all of the characters, as the unseen scribe behind the scenes, the author of the drama. Alice considers writing, but is clearly not cut out for it. Nancy Brill (Cybill Shepherd), a supposed friend, has a job reading scripts for a television network, but even with the help of her own personal muse (Bernadette Peters) she can't get a break. The muse points out that she can't expect any help from Brill, who constantly glances at her watch at all their meetings. Her writing teacher says she has talent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[explaining what the Professor means when he tells Alice she's 'deep']
Muse: Very deep is exactly where he wants to put it.

Bernadette Peters' muse is a mixture of creative juices, insight, and down-to-earth truth. I almost thought we had fast-forwarded to the Greek chorus of Mighty Aphrodite for a minute. It was like The Muse was inserted for Woody to tell Mia that she should stick to acting, and leave the writing to him.

The main metaphor of the movie is Dr. Yang, and his office functions as the looking glass through which Alice enters her Wonderland. He uses hypnosis, herbs, and magic potions. At one point, she barges in on him in the midst of an opium session. Is he the hookah smoking caterpillar? ""Yang"" would also seem to stand for the male principal, the compliment to ""Yin."" Her life is out of balance, with no Yang to offset her Yin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Yang: Love is a very complex emotion. No rational thought... much romance, but much suffering.

Her husband, Doug, wants her to just play the wife role, but offers her neither love nor understanding.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[trying to tell Alice why she'd be good working part-time in a sweater store]
Doug: You have a nice personality and you know sweaters.

Dr. Yang encourages her to speak to a man she sees while they are both dropping off their kids at school. The man is a jazz musician (Joe Mantegna), a tenor sax player who is working on a tribute to Duke Ellington. Though we never get to see or hear him actually play, he appears to be a solid professional on the New York jazz scene.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[explaining to Alice why he wants to have an affair with her]
Joe: There's nothing sexier than a lapsed Catholic.

Though she flirts with him, he isn't really the answer to her dilemma. She is almost going through Freudian analysis, searching her past for answers to her present.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: But then when dad died you drank yourself to death with, with margaritas.
Alice's Mother: I couldn't help it darling. You know I couldn't resist the taste of salt around the rim of a glass.

As in most of Allen's films, music plays a big part, especially jazz. At one point Alice, after hypnosis, is brazenly flirting with the jazz musician, asking astute questions about his reeds (he uses #3) and making references to the whole world of harmonics that opened up when John Coltrane switched from Tenor to Soprano Saxophone.

Woody Allen is a clarinet player himself, and especially fond of traditional jazz. The opening song, used as an ongoing musical motif, is ""Lime House Blues."" Though not technically a blues, this old-time jazz tune has stood the test of time, and was still being covered, for instance, by Coltrane, well into the post bop jazz era. It also works well as a bluegrass tune. ""Oh, Lime House Kid, Oh-oh-oh, Lime House Kid. Going the way that the rest of them did. Poor broken blossom, and nobody's child. Haunting and taunting, you're just kind of wild."" And the lyrics fit because the song talks about going to China Town, such as Alice is going to Dr. Yang's. ""...rings for your fingers and tears for your crown, that is the story of old China Town.""

After much soul searching, Alice leaves her husband, who is cheating on her anyway, and devotes herself to charity, adopting multiple orphans. Who (besides Madonna or Angelina Jolie) does that sound like?

Mini Biography
Mia Farrow is the daughter of the director John Farrow and the actress and Tarzan-girl Maureen O'Sullivan. She debuted at the movies in 1959 in very small roles. She was noticed for the first time in the film Rosemary's Baby (1968) by Roman Polanski. She showed her talent also on TV and at the theatre, but her final breakthrough was when she met Woody Allen and became his Muse after the film A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982). After that, Woody Allen wrote many other roles for her.

Personal Quotes:

""I don't like to talk about acting. I don't analyze it.""

""I love Lindt. Dark chocolate is such a delicious indulgence.""

""I don't think you can be a Catholic without an accompanying measure of guilt.""

""I think it was a difficult place for children. Beverly Hills was a one-business town, and the movie-making community was very clique-ish. You didn't really meet people outside that circle - except when they were employed by your parents: lawyers, or a gardener. Things that you might have wanted to do, you saw them as, in a way, in service. It was limiting in the way that role models were presented to children, and when people sort of became aware of how special our circumstances were, it also began to dawn on them that: how could they possibly sustain this themselves?""

""And I have the most wonderful children. I've been very, very blessed.""

""If I seem to be running, it's because I'm pursued.""

Top Ten Films of Mia Farrow (with fun facts and trivia courtesy of imdb dot com):

1.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-s-Baby/dp/B00003CXCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary's Baby</a>&nbsp;(1968) Directed by Roman Polanski, whose pregnant wife actress Sharon Tate was murdered in 1969 by Charles Manson and his followers, who titled their death spree ""Helter Skelter"" after the 1968 song by The Beatles, one of whose members, 'John Lennon,' would one day live (and in 1980 be murdered) in the Manhattan apartment building called The Dakota - where Rosemary's Baby had been filmed. The Dakota Building on Manhattan's Upper West Side was renamed The Bramford for the film. It was on the set of this film that Mia Farrow received divorce papers from then-husband Frank Sinatra.

2.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Gatsby/dp/B0000AUHQT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Gatsby</a>&nbsp;(1974) Originally, Truman Capote was the screenwriter, and his draft included making Nick a homosexual and Jordan Baker a vindictive lesbian. Capote was fired, and Francis Ford Coppola finished his draft in three weeks. Francis Ford Coppola lived in ""West Egg,"" aka Great Neck, former home of F. Scott Fitzgerald, at the time of writing the screenplay for ""The Great Gatsby."" The rights for the novel were purchased by producer Robert Evans in 1971 so that his wife at the time, Ali MacGraw, could play the part of Daisy. A shooting script wasn't ready yet, and MacGraw agreed to star in The Getaway (1972) as filler. During the production of The Getaway (1972) MacGraw fell in love with co-star Steve McQueen and left Evans for him. Mia Farrow was then picked to play Daisy. Mia Farrow was pregnant during filming and the director filmed around that by including close up shots of Farrow, and having her wear a lot of flowing costumes.

3.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Midsummer-Night-s-Sex-Comedy/dp/B00005O06K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy</a>&nbsp;(1982) Woody Allen wrote the role of Ariel for Diane Keaton, but she couldn't take the part because she was busy promoting her film Reds (1981) and preparing for Alan Parker's Shoot the Moon (1982). The first time Woody Allen appeared in one of his own films as part of an ensemble cast. Prior to this, he was either the main character or not in the film at all. The first time Mia Farrow appeared in a Woody Allen film. Woody Allen wrote the screenplay in 2 weeks.

In addition, 'Gordon Willis' took the exposed negatives to the shower, and stomped on them. In order to help create the look of genuine footage from the 1930s, DuArt, the lab that handled processing, called some of their experienced technicians (who were experienced with processing techniques of the 1930s) out of retirement.

The only time she removes the sunglasses is when her character is supposed to be more vulnerable.

6.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Purple-Rose-of-Cairo/dp/B00005O06L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Purple Rose of Cairo</a>&nbsp;(1985) Woody Allen has said more than once that this is his favorite of the movies he's made. After this film was previewed, word got back to Woody Allen that if he just changed his ending, he could have a big hit. Allen declined, saying that the ending is one of the reasons he made the film. In an interview in Esquire, Woody Allen was asked why he didn't make a happy ending to the film. Allen replied, ""That *was* the happy ending.""

7.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannah-and-Her-Sisters/dp/B00005O06J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannah and Her Sisters</a>&nbsp;(1986) Many of Hannah's scenes were filmed in Mia Farrow's actual apartment. Allen said that Farrow once had the eerie experience of turning on the TV to a chance broadcast of the movie thus viewing her own apartment on TV while she was sitting in it. According to USA Today, upon the film's original release, a movement was afoot to try to make Allen's script the first screenplay to be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. The poem Eliot gives Lee which contains the line ""nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands"", is the poem ""somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond"", by e.e. cummings. The book of poems by e.e. cummings is entitled ?Complete Poems 1913 ? 1962?, and the poem ?Somewhere? is on page 366. With a box office gross of over $40 million, this film represented Woody Allen's most financially successful film until Match Point (2005) in 2005. Four of Mia Farrow's real-life children appear in this film. Two appear as Hannah's son and daughter in the movie, while the other two (including Soon-Yi Previn, who Woody Allen would eventually marry in 1997) appear as young guests in the Thanksgiving scenes.

9.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/September/dp/B00005AUJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">September</a>&nbsp;(1987) Director Woody Allen cast and shot this film twice, without telling the original cast. Woody Allen decided to make the film for two main reasons. One was because he had always wanted to do a ""chamber piece"", a film with a small cast (there are only six principal characters, and only nine in the entire film) in a single location. The other was for the location itself, Mia Farrow's Connecticut country house, which inspired Woody Allen to write the screenplay with the intention that it would be shot at the house. Unfortunately, by the time Allen finished the screenplay, it was winter and the location was unusable for a movie so firmly planted in September. The entire movie (which takes place in Vermont) was shot on a single soundstage at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York. According to Mia Farrow's autobiography ""What Falls Away"", Woody Allen filmed two or three versions of every scene, took all of the footage into the editing suite, cut the film together and then decided that he hated it. He then rewrote the entire script, fired and recast virtually every major part, and re-filmed the entire thing. This meant that he doubled his production costs and came in well behind schedule. Allen was reportedly keen to do it all again

10.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Husbands-and-Wives/dp/B000062XE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Husbands and Wives</a>&nbsp;(1992) Hoping to piggyback on the scandal surrounding Woody Allen's break-up with Mia Farrow, TriStar opened the film on 865 screens, the largest amount ever given over to a Woody Allen picture. They were rewarded with an opening weekend of $3.52 million, the biggest ever for an Allen film. Woody Allen said in an interview that the reason he shot the film the way he did was that he wanted to break the usual rules of filmmaking. He cut scenes right in the middle of dialog, he used hand held cameras for no particular reason and did not care if he showed the side or the back of a performer's head during a scene. Allen said for this reason, he felt this film was one of his best. Sydney Pollack stated that although he liked working on the film, he did not like the character he played. Contrary to general perception, Mia Farrow's role is not autobiographical. Indeed, Woody Allen originally wrote the Judy Davis part with the idea of Farrow playing it. Farrow chose to take on the role of Gabe's wife instead as it meant less shooting time for her.",1211760000,5,16132,5.390786338363781
1418518,3,B00005AUJH,"I having been retrospectively over the past year running through films Woody Allen directed, wrote, acted in or produced. Interestingly they run the gamut of his intellectual and cultural interests but I must admit that I did not realize how many of his films featured his old paramour Mia Farrow. She must be the number one actress featured in his various efforts. That is the case here with Allen's whimsical modern day take on the Alice in Wonderland saga in good old New York City (naturally).

Here Farrow is the unfulfilled wife of a stockbroker who along the way has lost her moorings and her values and is desperately seeking a solution. In that effort she runs to the wisdom of the East exemplified by Doctor Yang, the acupuncturist. Going through a series of madcap false starts and pseudo-affairs she finally is able to right her course, leave her husband and bring up her children out of harm's way. Damn, I want the telephone (or more correctly these days, the cellphone number) of the good Doctor Yang, pronto. A piece of fluff.  Woody has had better ideas for a film in his time but not a bad performance by Farrow.",1203379200,,1130,4.645

1418520,4,B00005AUJH,"Well written, well acted, and well directed, this is much better than 99% of all films on TV or in the theatres.  the only reason it is unknown is its adult content - marijuana smoking and romantic affairs, lending amusing background to a woman's haphazard but fortunate search for control of her life.  This is that rare bird, an intelligent film, for adults. My favorite line: Joe Mantegna's remark to Mia Farrow: ""You're really interesting"", after she relates an  intimate comment she heard him make to his ex wife while she was invisible.  It is not a 5 star film, like say ""Witness"", but it is an excellent small film.  This is for film fans who prefer romance to violence.",1171929600,4,678,4.616666666666666
7935791,3,B00005AUJH,"Twilight Time offers another Woody Allen film for fans to enjoy or non-fans to disregard. Once more he teams of with life partner (at the time) Mia Farrow to present a tale that takes place in his familiar New York City. This time he takes the neurosis found in most of his films and gives them nods to both the Lewis Carroll classic ALICE IN WONDERLAND and Federico Fellinis JULIET OF THE SPIRITS.

Alice (Farrow) is a well to do married woman who still feel empty inside. Her days are spent with the children being looked over by their nanny, shopping at the most expensive stores and with nothing more than small talk with her wealthy husband Doug (William Hurt). Picking up the kids one day she sees another parent there named Joe (Joe Mantegna) that shes attracted to.

Her guilt over this attraction causes her to have back pains. Complaining of the backache to her friends while shopping one suggest that she try an acupuncturist and herbalist she know called Dr. Yang (Keye Luke in his final film performance). With nothing to lose Alice visits Yang who tells her the problem is not in her back but in her head and her heart. He provides her with some herbs to take at a precise time.

The next day she picks up the kids after taking the herbs and meets Joe again while waiting. The herbs have left her uninhibited and she flirts mercilessly with Joe, making a date to meet the following day. She doesnt follow through with the date but returns to Dr. Yang who gives her new herbs to use, this time making her invisible.

While invisible she watches Joe as he meets up with his ex-wife (Judy Davis) in her office and the two have a quickie there for old times sake. This makes her glad she didn't go through with her meeting. It also sends her back to Dr. Yang who gives her different herbs, this time giving her the ability to see her old beau, Ed (Alec Baldwin), who died before they could marry. Ed suggest that she give Joe a chance and learn more about him.

Each suggestion that Alice follows opens up new doors to whats really going on inside of her, her true emotions and feelings, rather than the superficial life shes been leaving. And each time she learns something new she returns to Dr. Yang who gives her more herbs that lead her in more directions with more people. Whether or not she will learn from her experiences and find happiness is what rounds out the film by the end credits.

The story is interesting and inventive in its mix of mysticism, romance and light comedy. Each new herb yields yet another small story within the context of the larger whole, revealing as much about Alice to us as she learns about herself. The writing is some of the better that Allen has done from the films of his Ive seen and it works well within the confines of the NYC world of the elite.

The cinematography here is amazing. Where some movies do well either with interiors or exteriors but not always both, cinematographer Carlo di Palma (famous for shooting BLOW UP as well as many of Allens later films) shows an expertise to be envied. His use of lighting and camera angles works in every shot.

Perhaps the weakest element the film has is its lead actress, Farrow. Ill admit that my exposure to her performances is pretty limited to her appearances in other Allen films and ROSEMARYS BABY. Ive never found her to be a dynamic actress whose work I would want to seek out. But her performances in the films shot in NYC for Allen always feel the same to me. She always seems as if shes a weak willed woman with a constantly whining voice, always unsure of herself and more inclined to wallow in self-pity than anything else. Having recently watch Allens MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY and learning that she had been intended to play the role Diane Keaton did I kept thinking that that movie would have felt completely different if that had happened. And not for the better. It doesnt matter if Alice finds herself here or not, the majority of the film has her so self-deprecating that it made it hard for me to feel for her.

While critically acclaimed and nominated for various screenplay awards the movie was a box office flop. It should have done better because for the minor flaws in the film it was entertaining and a good representation of Allens films. Perhaps it will find an audience on discs that will make up for that box office loss.

Twilight Time is offering the film in a beautiful blu-ray presentation here in 1080p. Extras are slim to non-existent with just an isolated music & effects track and the original theatrical trailer. But fans of Allen will want to grab this up since like other Twilight Time releases it is limited to just 3,000 copies.",1525219200,,4674,4.51418439716312

7935800,5,B00005AUJH,I'm not a fan of Mia Farrow but am a fan of Woody Allen because he has a way of making a mediocre actress into an entertainer.  The movie is very late 80s early 90s but actually still holds water and relevance in the 2000s. You also get to see a slimmed down version of Alec Baldwin (sexy) and a type-cast William Hurt (his usual self). A good middle years Allen movie.,1505865600,,369,4.125
