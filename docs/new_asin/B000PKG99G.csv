2824425,5,B000PKG99G,"Having been married to a Pan Am Pilot, I can tell you that this resembles what the crews did more than the fluffy TV Show. Pan Am was there, around the world, at crucial times. This docudrama, is worth the time and money to watch it. The acting is superb and the story (true story) shows the goodness of the crews.",1325548800,2,314,4.163934426229508

8192064,4,B000PKG99G,"Good Video. I have the original TV version that NBC sent to me on a VHS Tape. It contained all of commercials etc.

Last Flight Out was fairly decent with a just a few flaws that the producers should have corrected before releasing the video.

The biggest flaw was the Last Flight aircraft shown in the movie was a DC-10. In reality it was not a DC-10 nor was it the real Pan Am ""Clipper Unity"". In reality it was a Pan Am Boeing 747 tail number: N653PA cn 20348/106. I have pictures of Clipper Unity at FRA (Frankfurt Germany)and at LHR (London Heathrow).

Pan Am ""Clipper Unity"" was delivered to Pan Am on 4/08/1971. It is was sold to Evergreen Int. Air Cargo on 01/05/1991 and was reregistered as N480EV.  Stored 09/2009 & Scrapped in 2012.",1433376000,,743,4.401459854014599

8192066,5,B000PKG99G,"The unforgettable true life story of Pan American World Airways executive Al Topping as a true man of destiny is not to be missed. This is a top notch cast of Richard Crenna, Dr. Haing Ngor M.D., Barry Corbin and James Earl Jones as Al Topping in the closing days of the Vietnam War. Don't miss it!",1416787200,,298,4.245614035087719
8192067,5,B000PKG99G,"From start to finish, The Last Flight Out is a fast paced, gripping drama the holds your attention to the very end as the film follows a handful of Americans trying to help friends, family, orphans, and ""enemies of state"" certain to be killed the incoming regime flee Saigon for America in the final days before the Viet Cong Take Over at the end of The Vietnam War.  One road block after another is thrown up by a government in disarray and a military scared for its own existence as the rules for gaining entry to flights out of the country seemingly change almost daily. Meanwhile the US Military is pulling out so US aide is extremely hard to come by.

While parts of the film focus on a handful of select individuals who were trying to rescue people, other parts focus on the efforts of Pan Am's Airline Chief in Saigon, himself sympathetic to the hardships of those working on evacuation face but facing extremely difficult issues of his own, Washington wants everyone out, the Viet Cong are advancing faster than those in the know believed they would, and Pan Am is ordering flights halted ASAP.  Literally forced to ""play God"" with only one last flight (if he can get it approved after it was cancelled) and only so many seats, it's a struggle deciding who to say yes and no to in this horrible time.

The cast is excellent from top to bottom, especially Richard Crenna (playing a Pan Am Pilot who worked with a local orphanage to evacuate sick children) and James Earl Jones as the local Pan Am Chief.

Despite having almost no violence on screen this film is tension filled with lots of excitement, a very enjoyable drama for all ages.",1397433600,,1645,4.543918918918919

8192071,5,B000PKG99G,"I worked for Pan Am during that time and was involved in getting kids out of Vietnam. In fact, 15 years later I met one of the kids I'd helped get out. So many times Hollywood glamorizes a story, but this one was right on. I saw the movie when it first came out and am so glad I was able to purchase my own copy. Thank you Amazon for making this so easy",1347148800,2,353,3.7837837837837838
