5934506,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"As a non-performer who enjoys stretch classes, I was looking for a DVD somewhat comparable to the stretch classes I had been taking at my local gym.  I tried a few yoga DVDs, which were either too slow of a pace or didn't have enough leg stretches to appease me, but this one fit what I was searching for -- it's a warmup and cool down with a progressive, comprehensive full body stretch in between (including a splits section and a backbending sequence).  It's a total of an hour long, which makes it doable on a regular basis, and didn't require any special equipment (aside from a yoga mat and yoga blocks).  She talks just enough and her dialogue is to the point, with very little extraneous speaking, which I also liked.

My only critique, which is admittedly nitpick, is that the splits section is kind of short and doesn't hold the splits as long as I'm used to doing them (so I just pause it until I'm ready to move on).  She does do a full-on quads stretch with some variations before going into the splits, which I appreciated.

Overall, I really enjoy this DVD as it was comprehensive, easy to follow, and had enough variations to make things easier or more challenging when necessary.",1401235200,6,1196,4.513888888888889
5934507,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"This is a wonderful DVD if you are looking for a one hour routine to increase your flexibility and strength. The routine is progressive and efficient. The DVD is superbly organized, and her instruction is clear without any extra fluff. The instruction is very easy to follow both visually and verbally, with the right amount of humor.

Here is the format the DVD follows:
  * Full body warm up
  * Stretches for legs and hips
  * Side and middle splits
  * Shoulder warm up and stretching
  * Strength-based approach to backbending
  * Cool down
  * Special hands-on tutorial on achieving beautiful splits

Highly recommended!",1399766400,2,626,4.875
5934508,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"The first thing to say is that this video is definitely not for people who have not moved around in a while, or for the overambitious who cannot pay attention to what their body is telling them. Get Bent (for which I received a review copy) is an intense program, you go into stretches for relatively long periods of time, and it plays on the edge of discomfort. As Kristina explains in the introduction, you need to differentiate between good and bad pain, and she describes how to recognize which is which.

To be perfectly honest, the first time I worked with the video I wasn't sure if I had pushed myself too far, and was afraid that I wouldnt be able to move the next day. In fact, I felt fantastic the next day, all kinds of aches and pains were gone. This has been true every time I have done the video  for me, it works like a really good yin yoga session. But I would still say that you need to be smart, careful, and aware using this DVD, as you will not have a live coach to watch over you.

The first section is a Warmup, which is more of a joint-loosening warmup than one to get your heart up very much. You systematically move all the joints of your body, from the wrists to the ankles, and start to practice some squats and leg raises. I was very glad to have this, as I would not have wanted to stretch cold, but I imagine that doing the video after a long workout would be even better.

Part 2 is Splits Preparation, which consists of forward and sideways lunges held for a good long time, followed by a series of yoga postures designed to relax the hamstrings. While some of the moves are yoga, the instruction isnt. Kristina carefully guides you through dynamic stretches, using gentle movement and tensing and releasing of muscles to attain a deeper stretch. Everything is done equally on both sides. I find the little tricks, especially with tensing and releasing muscles, incredibly helpful.

Part 3 is Splits. This was the hardest section for me, mainly because I cant do anywhere near the splits. As much as it was difficult for me to levitate in the position that was as close as I could get, I did feel that I was stretching in a way that was beyond the lunges in Part 2. However, the middle splits are something one can practice even without too much of a range of motion. In this section, as through the video, Kristina gives you quiet encouragement and tips on saying nice things to your body. This sounds sort of funny at first, until you realize it works. So yes, Ill admit it, I now say nice things to my body in my head when Im stretching! The Splits section would be particularly valuable to people who can already do the splits, since there are also exercises for going beyond a 180-degree stretch.

Next comes the Shoulder Warm Up & Stretch. This was one of my favourite sections of the DVD, and perhaps the most generally useful. I sit at my computer a lot, for both work and fun, and it is not good for my shoulders and upper back. Kristinas exercises really loosen the shoulders, and she also has some gorgeous stretches for the front of the shoulders and the chest. Again, this section would be worth doing as a break at the office, but would also be worth incorporating into a dance warmup. Really delicious.

The Backbends section will probably be most interesting to bellydancers. Kristina uses a mirror/wall to bend towards, but she also guides you to move from the upper back only, keeping the lower abdominals still. Again, this is one of those exercises I worry about when Im doing, because I don't want to hurt my lower back. But Ive always been careful only to go as far as I could while still following Kristinas instructions, and Ive felt fine.

Finally, you get a short but satisfying yoga-based Cool Down. You have earned it. Heck, if you're anything like me, you're probably shaking at this point.

Throughout the DVD, Kristina is encouraging and funny. While she is clearly very fit, she is also curvy, and frankly, it made me very happy to see someone on the screen with a body similar to mine, but doing really cool things with it.

So the big question: does it work? I haven't done the video the recommended three times a week, nowhere near it, so I cant speak to the effects it would have if you really did it religiously. That said, when I did work with it, I noticed a difference in my classes afterwards. My muscles were remarkably looser, I felt more flexible, and I felt like I knew how to stretch better. I have to imagine that doing the video regularly would increase my flexibility even more.

You will like Get Bent if you have some experience with stretching or yoga, are aware of your body and can respect its limits, and are craving really deep, long stretches. If you can already do splits, you will probably use the video as a maintenance and extension program. All of the program is useful for dancers, but there are parts, like the upper body and shoulder stretches, that bellydancers will particularly enjoy. I also think youll like it if you want the feeling of having done a great yoga session  you know, that sensation of everything in your body having been pulled apart and put back together loosely  without all the yogic tralala.

On the other hand, you will probably be frustrated with the DVD if you are very inflexible; in that case, you might be better off with a gentle yoga program. You also should not expect contortionist circus tricks, despite the title. These are very straightforward, well-known stretches, guided well, and with some extra techniques thrown in to make them feel better. But don't expect to be pretzeling your legs around your neck or anything.",1398902400,40,5654,4.5087890625
5934509,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"Totally addicted to this dvd.. I do it most days unless really busy and don't have time as it is an hour long.
Very straight forward and can follow and do the dvd at your own flexibility level and progress with time :-))",1396656000,2,220,4.1395348837209305
5934510,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"This DVD is so wonderful that I'm actually taking the time to write a review.  In all my years of dancing, practicing yoga and taking fitness classes, I have never had such comprehensive instruction as regards flexibility.  Some of the information presented I had encountered before, of course, but never all in one place.  All the extra information Kristina adds is invaluable.  The splits tutorial in particular was extremely helpful.  Kristina takes the time to really explain proper form and gives great tips for increasing both active and passive range of motion in the joint.  As with all exercise, of course, you should consult with a health practitioner first.  That said, I got more out of my first session with this DVD than I did from my very expensive and painful physical therapy several years ago.  Because Kristina's sense of humor and presentation style are so engaging, I'm sure I'll continue to enjoy using this DVD daily.",1390003200,15,940,4.942675159235669
5934511,4,B00EQH4PZ4,"This is a really great flexibility workout. I did this DVD while I was doing P90X, so I was already working on my fitness. However, if you didn't know that you had a spinal irregularity before, you'll find out once you start this work-out. During the shoulder/back-bending stretches, I felt a crunching in my lower back that I couldn't get rid of no matter how I'd correct my form. One day, I was attempting a full camel pose, and the pain got worse and didn't go away. I went to a chiropractor and X-rays showed that my spinal wasn't straight and twisted to one side. I was given stretches/exercises to correct my spine and it's helped a lot with the pain and going deeper into the stretches on the DVD. What you don't know CAN hurt you. AND hinder your progress! Just something to think about for anyone else new to the contortion/flexibility world.

Pros: The DVD is at a slow pace, so it's very easy to follow.

Kristina's tips are very helpful, and you can tell she knows what she's talking about. Correct form is the biggest emphasis, so you learn to do things the right way.

I personally love the backbend section. I've never done anything like it, so I don't know how to compare it to anything, but it makes sense and it's very helpful.

Cons: Sometimes, the camera angles weren't helpful to me. After you've done the DVD ten times, it won't matter, but at first, it's a little confusing.

The warm-up didn't get me warm-enough. I wasn't sweating and my heartbeat wasn't elevated by much. I'm use to cardio workouts, so maybe you don't need to be AS ""warm"" for a stretch routine. If that's the case, ignore this point.

I wish there were more straddle split stretches. The front splits are the majority of the workout, and it seemed like the straddle split wasn't given as much attention.

I wish there were MORE back stretches!! My goal is a triple-fold, but nothing on the DVD goes anywhere close to that.

There isn't really a cool-down. It's called a cool-down, but that's not what it does. You're still working out, pushing your body into new positions, and doing some challenging moves- as oppose to something soothing to relax your body after all your hard work. But again, maybe that's because it's a stretch DVD. And again, if so, disregard this point.

The production value isn't super. It looks like it was shot on a camcorder. However, it doesn't interfere with the overall effectiveness of the work-out. In this age of High Definition, I guess anything that isn't HD becomes very obvious.

****The pros FAR overweigh the cons for this DVD. It really is a great buy and I enjoy having my own personal flexibility trainer! :)

P.S. If you add Kristina Nekyia on Facebook, she is VERY helpful and will give you extra insight on stretches, concerns, and anything else you may want to ask about. facebook.com/FitAndBendyContortionTraining

P.S.S. Testimonial!!! After doing this DVD only 3 times, I was able to touch my feet to my head when lying on my stomach. Something I haven't been able to do since elementary school. I was super excited! I used the DVD every other day- so I hit my goal in five days.",1385078400,24,3123,4.607207207207207
5934512,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"This is the most comprehensive stretching DVD I own, and I have quite a few - so I highly recommend it.  I was referred to Kristina's classes by a pole teacher of mine a few months ago.  Although I have been getting stronger in pole I have always been extremely tight and am completely retarded when it comes to stretching.  Because Kristina is a contortionist I was afraid that her classes and the DVD would be too hard for me to do.  I also have some past injuries (back, knee) that I didn't want to aggravate by stretching the wrong way.  Quite the contrary, this DVD has helped me to get into the right positions to actually start stretching my muscles the right way so that I am finally seeing progress!  And my lines are soooo much better.  This DVD is invaluable and if you are ever in Los Angeles or Kristina is visiting a city near you I highly recommend taking one of her classes, she is AMAZING!",1381104000,3,906,4.325443786982248
5934513,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"I took her workshop and bought the DVD at the workshop.  I am naturally pretty flexible, but this DVD took me to the next level.  She really empasizes keeping your hips squared while doing the splits.  I hadn't realized, before this DVD, how hard it was to keep your hips squared and that I did not keep them squared while in the splits. I had never done oversplits before this DVD, though I could get to the ground without keeping my hips squared.  Now, I can do oversplits and my form is a 1,000 times better.  The little tweaks she gives in the DVD change the way the strech feels completely.

What I love most about this DVD is the strength elements.  You are not passively stretching, you are being challenged and sweating in this workout.  I really appreciate the level of detail she gives in each move, she makes it easy to understand what you really should be doing.  I only do the DVD twice a week right now, but even that has really improved my mobility and the way I feel.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to become more flexible or maintain their flexibility.",1381104000,10,1087,4.417085427135678
5934514,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"My pole dance instructor recommended Kristina Nekyia to me after having had a class with her herself. I could not be more thankful and feel more and more thrilled about owning this DVD.

Get Bent is set in a simple studio with no unnecessary distractions in the background. While Kristina is demonstrating the stretches a voice over of her explains them in great detail. She has a fabulous way of guiding you with her instructions. I never felt lost or unsure what or how to do something. Furthermore her calm voice guides you in an easily understandable way the entire time so that you do not have to keep your eyes locked on the screen to see what is happening (which I find very unhelpful and annoying with a lot of other instructional DVDs).

The stretches themselves are amazing and I already felt a lot of improvement and opening in both my splits and backbends the very first time I did this DVD.

Kristina offers a lot of great advice and encourages you to both listen to your body but also to reassure it that everything will be okay (LOVING IT!) showing us that we are not our enemies but that we should be working with ourselves.

Her great vocabulary makes her very memorable and also puts a smile on my face whenever I do her DVD even though I have done it with great results quite a few times now. Thanks to Kristina I am nearly all the way down in my middle splits and feel comfortable working on backbends without hurting my back.

I hope there will be more DVDs to come!",1381104000,2,1487,4.412408759124087
5934515,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"I cannot say how much I love this DVD and the tips / advice Fit & Bendy freely gives. I started following Kristina on Facebook, and when she announced the sale of this DVD, I promptly ordered it.

VERDICT - This is a must buy because it works!

I had been working on my splits for a few months prior to starting the DVD, but once I added it into my routine, I was able to touch down on both leg front splits within a month. I am also nearly down in my middle split. I hadn't worked on back flexibility since I was a kid, and getting into backbends is a big goal of mine. I feel a lot more comfortable in my bridges and my shoulders are pretty well stacked over my wrists - I even started working on forearm bridges.

You will definitely sweat with this DVD. Stretching releases toxins, so expect it. Make sure to listen to her tips throughout - positioning, breathing, visualization, drinking lots of water! - all of that helps immensely. She also includes a tutorial illustrating proper positioning with splits - if you are a visual learner, do watch this section. it is accessible from the main menu.

i am 36 and, anyone over 30 knows, it takes a lot of hard work to gain and maintain flexibility at this age. I do the DVD at least 6 times a week just because if I don't, it's like taking 10 steps back. I do the entire DVD, mainly because I am working on both, but also because the flexibility you work on in one section also helps in the other (i.e. open hip flexors and hammies are very important for back flexibility).

I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone working on getting into splits / over-splits and backbends. If you are naturally flexible in one area, I still recommend it, because you will learn proper technique and strengthening exercises - the strength exercises are more so for the back portion, although some are included in the splits prep. And anyone who stretches knows you need strength when working on flexibility to protect your body.

Remember, if you aren't diligent about working on your flexibility, you won't see results. Kristina gives you the tools on how to become more flexible, but it is really up to you to be consistent with your training. I strongly recommend taking photos of your progress and following Fit & Bendy on Facebook, where she gives weekly tips. You can also post your progress pics there and get great feedback from her. Lastly, if you have friends who have the same goal, make a challenge out of it and track your progress together. Making it more social is a great way to motivate you!",1381104000,34,2539,4.449462365591398

fun, easy to follow, and very detailed so you can really learn how to work with your body with out hurting it and actually make it happy and healthy.",1458000000,,376,4.094594594594595
5934517,4,B00EQH4PZ4,"There are a lot of good points to this DVD, Kristina definitely knows how to get into a good stretch, and I really like that she has incorporated strength into the stretching, because I feel that flexibility without strength is not good for the body.  I have been using this dvd for a week after about a year of not stretching regularly and I've noticed that I am gaining flexibility at a faster pace than I normally would.  So the techniques used in this program are very effective, at least for my body.

The explanations of the stretches are pretty good, and the camera is focused where it should be, so you can always see what you're supposed to be doing.  The lighting is great, and the background and Kristina's outfit make a nice contrast so that everything is very visible and easy to understand.

Other reviewers have given a breakdown of the segments of the dvd so I won't take up time with that.

There are some issues with this DVD.  First off, I am beyond tired of instructors who cannot mirror you.  This thing is done in a VOICEOVER, and she says to ""bring your right leg out"", but to the viewer it's on the LEFT side.  Come ON people, reviewers of dance and other exercise instructional DVDs have been complaining since the days of VHS about how it's much harder to learn when what they see on the screen and what their bodies are supposed to be doing.  And with a voiceover, this should NOT be happening.

I was also disappointed at the lack of modifiers for some of these stretches.  There are times when she says if you can't do a move, you can modify in one way or another, but there are some positions she doesn't give a modifier for at all, and some that she doesn't give a pointer until she is deep into the stretch (like doing a center split, she's all the way down, my knees were screaming before she says ""oh  yeah, if this hurts your knees you can do it while laying on your back""....Um, thanks for telling me that AFTER I hurt myself (yeah, I shouldn't have gone down so far, but I was comfortable to a certain point and then when I got to where I was having pain, I couldn't control the split enough to get out of it easily)  She does seem to be more careful about the backbends,(although she offers NO tips for those of us who can't push themselves into a bridge, such as using an exercise ball to start).  I am surprised that no one has sued the company for injuries to knees, back, ankles, etc.  She almost seems to assume that anyone using this DVD is nearly as flexible as she is.  If you have any flexibility issues, knee issues, back issues, I suggest you either have a professional show you alternatives to some of these movements because you may find yourself stuck in a pose and damaging yourself before you can get out of the pose.  Or you may want to find an easier program and master that before trying this one.",1447891200,6,2854,4.342749529190207

5934519,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"I am an E-RYT and a full-time Pilates instructor, with certification starting in 2003.  I am also an avid anatomy and kinesiology student, and have started training in aerial arts in the last year.  I began doing some research on how to advance and deepen my flexibility for aerials and this DVD continued to come up again and again.  After debating for a while, I went to Kristina's website and ordered the digital copy (which I immediately sat down to practice!).  Within 10 minutes I was sweating and shaking and wasn't sure if I'd make it through the whole hour!  At the end of the full thing though, I felt fantastic - which continued through the following day even though I thought I'd be sooooo sore!  This is not just a stretch, it is work - you will support, flex, and stretch through all your muscles.  If you cannot touch your toes or support yourself on your hands or blocks for splits or wheel pose you may want to start with the previous DVD.  Even if you have your splits and backbends, there are plenty of advanced options given, and the cueing is fantastic!  I highly recommend!",1437264000,2,1095,4.517766497461929

I love that this stretch workout is exactly what it says -- it DIRECTLY forces us to focus on opening up the body for splits and backbends while employing other stretches to prepare us for hanging out, seriously, in these positions for a while.  Finally, an instructor that doesn't go crazy with 10,000 stretches, but hones in on those key positions that we press and hold and sink and hold and breathe and hold until the muscles are forces to relax and open.

I'm pretty limber, but I don't have any of my splits down to the ground anymore (and never had a straddle to the ground, my middle splits have always been terrible).  Additionally backbending was something I'd shied away from for the past 10 years due to a very bad lower back injury.  However, because of the aerial arts I'd developed a passion for this year, I picked yoga back up.  And -- this DVD :)  I'm more of a classes kinda gal, but it's nice to have something at home that I can use to work on stretching at my place, because my schedule totally sucks trying to fit everything in.

The stretches are simple but effective, and you can really go as deep as you'd like or take it easy if you think that's the best choice for you.  The instruction is clear, the segments are a good length, and it's very thorough.  The warm up is basic, so if you need your limbs a little more well-oiled, you might wanna do some cardio and then pop this in.  What I have ended up doing is utilizing the info from this video and incorporating it into some additional stretching after my yoga class and some PT.

She's also got a nice, calm voice and gentle personality in the video, which is perfect for being able to breathe into the deep stretching you're doing.  I actually met Kristina because I went to the studio to pick this up, and she's very down to earth.  I think you'll find that quality in the video as well.

Even if you stretch just once a week, you'll get something out of this.  It's not an overly expensive thing to have on hand -- it's not even the cost of a silks or a flying trapeze class, so -- it basically pays for itself :)",1410480000,2,1674,4.206896551724138

5934536,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"It's only been six days since I got the DVD, but my body feels better when I wake up in the morning. I really appreciate how detailed she is about everything. This is totally worth it.",1409616000,3,184,4.138888888888889
5934537,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"Fantastic DVD! Great instruction, tips throughout, and a split tutorial so we know exactly what position we should be striving for. I recommend her DVDs to all of my fitness students.",1409616000,,183,4.935483870967742
5934538,5,B00EQH4PZ4,Kristina Nekyia is a body master. Her understanding for how to safely increase flexibility is unbelievable! I have been injured in the past from former contortion coaches and unfortunately my body will remember that feeling forever...but with Kristina's technique my body is slowly starting to trust me again and build strength and flexibility in those injured areas. A must buy!,1409011200,2,379,5.333333333333333
5934539,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"This was great.  I was a bit skeptical that it might be too easy since I am already ""fit and bendy"", but I really wanted to step it up.  This has been very helpful, and I will keep using it as I have seen some improvement in my strength and flexibility as a result.  Most stretching routines are for people who can barely move.  I'm so glad there is something more advanced out there.",1409011200,2,384,4.148648648648648
5934540,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"Before I get into the review, I think it's important to recognize who writes these reviews as we all stretch for different reasons and come from different backgrounds. I am a 9-5 office worker who, for the first 23 years of my life, never did anything active - I was in a sitting position for about 70% of a typical day. This of course has caused me to become extremely inflexible, particularly in the hips and shoulders. Working on a laptop at a desk for so many years had really taken a toll on my body. I started working out 2 years ago and while I've gotten a lot stronger, my flexibility was awful, and I realized that my workouts would go a lot better if I started flexibility training.

I started seriously stretching as a 24 year old and have been working on my front splits for one and a half years. I never did ballet, gymnastics, heck I was never really an active kid before I was 23 when I started to exercise seriously. When I started stretching I quickly made progress for about 8 months, then plateaued. I was still 3-5 inches off my splits on both sides and stayed there for months, becoming increasingly frustrated, so I started looking online for something that could help me get past it. DVD's seem to be pretty effective, as I don't have to think about my routine as much as focusing on the moves.

Yes, the design of the cover seems like it was made with 90's soft and the video isn't exactly HD quality, but the stretches are very simple to follow (some stretching videos have the instructor talking incessantly about what to do in each move).

Part 1: Warmup - This warmup is not meant to get your heart rate up but to take your joints through their full range of moments. It will not necessarily get your muscles as warm as you normally would with workout warmups, but after doing the DVD a few times, I found that my muscles were in a more relaxed state than normal and it was no longer necessary for me to do a 10 minute run or cardio session.

Part 2: Splits prep. I LOVE this section - mainly because Kristina doesn't just make you hold a pose for a really long time, but tells you to make certain contractions/movements that allow your muscles to relax - this is the essence of PNF stretching which is what I was missing in my old routine.

Part 3: Splits - Honestly, this DVD is great for front splits, but I find that stretches for middle splits were a bit lacking. If you already know how to do middle splits, this section may help you as she dabbles in a tiny bit in oversplits.

Part 4: Shoulders - This section is pretty short but is great for people who need to correct their posture. There is a gradual progression here which is great.

Part 5: Backbends - After this section I realized quickly that my current backbending routine was completely wrong. She really emphasizes engaging your abs to support your spine - instead, I was hurting my lower back by compressing it in my backbends instead of lifting my torso out of my hips. This section is probably my second favorite because it has really helped me with my lower back pain.

Part 6: Cooldown - I won't spoil anything here, but it's a very appropriate ending to the DVD.

Kristina's narration is excellent - she does make cues and they might be a bit subtle, but if you do this DVD enough times you'll practically memorize them. Her voice is always very relaxed and she speaks slowly which I really appreciated in a stretching video.

I'm doing this DVD every day, sometimes twice so if it works as I think it will I'll come back to update this review. After 2 weeks I'm already noticing a huge difference - ALL my aches/pains and soreness from my static stretching routine are completely gone. I realize this is anecdotal evidence, but I think this can benefit anyone, though I think this DVD would be more appropriate for someone who has some experience with yoga or stretching, as some of the moves are quite advanced.",1408838400,10,3916,4.426388888888889

8608528,4,B00EQH4PZ4,"Kristina is a fabulous instructor. She is fun with the expressions that she makes during training.  This is done with narration and is her as a solo and not a class. Very fluid transition from one move to the next.  She is very flexible and she can definitely get most people to her level with hard work and commitment. I would recommend yoga blocks for this to help with leverage. It helped for me to stay in those poses that I can't fully execute yet.  I learned this after the go with this. The only issue I had, and this is no fault of the program is that you need a wall for part of it and I don't have a wall that I can use because of the layout of my workout space.

8608531,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"This program is SUPER awesome. Not only is she is super easy going, down to earth and kinda quirky, I'm already pretty flexible and I've only been doing it for two weeks! Granted, I've always been fairly flexible i.e yoga, stretching for general dance work... but I've never been able to do back bends or kick really high. I know every body is different, but I'm seeing fast progress, and am amazed with the results. Unfortunately, I got into a car accident a year ago, someone rear-ended me while I was stopped. I was out for 3 weeks. Since then, my back hasn't been the same and this video seems to trigger upper back pain and headaches. However, I'm recently getting to a chiropractor to adjust me, and hopefully that will help get me 100% again. I also found out I have slight scoliosis- who knew? I definitely recommend going to a chiropractor prior to doing these exercises, especially if you've had any kind of trauma to your neck or spine. But if you can't wait- like I couldn't- definitely check in with yourself and listen to how your body feels and handles it, if you start to get any type of pain, its probably a spinal issue and going to a chiropractor could help.

P.S
You will definitely sweat, shake or both with this DVD. It can be intense and your muscles/body will tell you! So pace yourself at what you can handle, and do not overstretch your boundaries ;)",1466553600,5,1376,4.48207171314741
8608532,5,B00EQH4PZ4,"I would highly recommend this DVD if you are trying to get or improve your splits or backbends. It is expensive but it is effective, in the happy middle between stretching too much or not enough. The stretches are hold long enough. It is mainly passive stretching, but she also adds active stretches here and there, specially in the back section.
I would not recommend this DVD as a general stretching DVD for ""regular"" people, I would recommended it for dancers, aerialists, etc. as the DVD indicates on the other hand, so no surprise.",1465862400,2,536,4.712765957446808
