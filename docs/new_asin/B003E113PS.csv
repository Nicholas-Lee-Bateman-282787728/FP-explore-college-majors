Dorthea Roschmann is a fabulous Fiodiligi, I don't think she has a single solo CD, but shes one of the great sopranos of her generation, a real joy to listen to.  And Hanno Muller-Brachmann is  a wonderful Guglielmo.  His rich baritone and joie de vivre are captivating.  In a particularly inspired version of Donne mie, la fate a tanti, hes strutting back and forth at the front of the stage, maliciously shining a flashlight at random women in the audience.

But what makes this production so delightful is the way Doris Dorrie has recast the story.  Its set in the late 60s, and when the two soldier-lovers return in disguise, they come back as hippies.  The sets, the costumes are fabulous, but its the acting that puts this over.  I laughed out loud several times.

Scene one, the wager, takes place at an airport counter, amid perplexed bouffanted blonde flight attendants and staff.  The soldiers are businessmen, dueling w/ umbrellas and flying off in a 727.  The penultimate scene is a mock love-in.  The chorus seems to be enjoying itself hugely, smoking dope, meditating, and making out, beneath psychedelic flowers.

Roman Trekel is a superb, and youthful, Don Alfonso, and Dorrie tweaks the story so that a romantic interest flickers between Al and Despina, sung w/ bravura by Daniela Brurera.  Katharina Kammerlocher and Werner Gura are also first-rate as Dorabella and Fernando.  Gura sings a lovely Unaura amorosa, but hes overshadowed by the mischievous Muller-Brachmann.

As soon as the opera was over, I stuck the DVD back in and started watching it again.",1383868800,6,1671,4.868794326241135
