Everything you always wanted from a Golden Harvest swordplay movie; honor, betrayel, ninjas flying through forrests like superman, severd arms and legs, decapitations and fountains of blood!  Needless to say, this isn't a movie to watch for an increadable plot, top notch cinamatography or acadamy award winning acting, but for action, great swordfigthing scenes and a comic-book storyline, look no further.  This movie is high on the entertainment value, and has more wire flying than a year's worth of Barnum & Baily circus.  If you love the hokey old Golden Harvest Kung-Fu movies, you have got to check out this title.  Look for the scene where the monk is decapitated, his head flies into and is impaled on a pranch, then after muttering ""A monk feels no pain"", the severed head exploads!  A true Saturday night classic!",988416000,,836,4.9784172661870505

7870241,4,6304418671,"A good but strange movie about a match up between China and Japan's two greatest warriors. The competition is held by a chinese family whose ancestors had defeated the japanese in this event in previous battles. The  only problem is that the master of this family is planning on killing the  chinese warrior,and placing his daughter in the competition. Along with a  crooked japanese monk, who is only interested in learning the chinese  arts,they plan to corrupt the match. The japanese warrior(Tsui Siu Keung)  isn't planning on helping, and is an honorable samurai who wishes to fight  to the death to see who is truly the better warrior. The chinese  warrior(Damian Lau) is similar to the japanese man in this way,until the  end when he doesn't wish to fight. Although he does anyway. The sword fights  are great,although i'm not the biggest fan of the wire work which is a  little overdone during the sword fights. During the hand to hand combat,the  wire work is kept to a minimum. There isn't a whole lot of empty hand  fighting, but what there is of it is quite good. Casanova Wong has a small  roll in the movie as a chinese master who uses a nice combo of sword and  foot against a bunch of ninja.",944524800,,1207,4.579439252336448
