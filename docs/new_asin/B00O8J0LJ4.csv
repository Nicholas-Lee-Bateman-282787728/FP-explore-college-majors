6729156,4,B00O8J0LJ4,"I was 17 years old when BATMAN (In Color) hit the airwaves. It was and remains a silly, campy and outlandish affair that best showed off  the potential of Color TV for the masses. If you grew up reading Detective comics when they sold for a dime, then you'll appreciate all the ridiculous sets and situations that comprise this DVD of pure nonsense. The TV series is actually a fair representation of BATMAN comics circa 1958. That was an era when Batman and Robin was for kids only, having lost any semblance of a decent story line, let alone a ""Detective Story"".

What makes the entire series endearing and even noteworthy was and is the all-star lineup of Arch Villains. Serious movie stars (Burgess Meredith, Art Carney, etc) of the day apparently lined up and begged for a chance to be part of the goofy fun. One gets the impression that the cast had a blast making these garish Bat-episodes and couldn't wait to come back for more. Unlike many ""super hero"" TV series, BATMAN never took itself seriously, and neither should you. Devotees of Comic Con will be appalled at Howie Horowitz's campy TV show.

BATMAN THE SERIES is really more about 1960's Television history than a nod to the super-hero genre. On that note, enjoy at your own peril!",1419638400,4,1248,4.638009049773756
6729157,4,B00O8J0LJ4,"Well, let's be honest. Some of us probably had a feeling they were going to pull this split season scam on us. Is it nasty? Yes it is. It sounds legitimate IN THEORY seeing that there are 60 episodes. HOWEVER, each story consists of two episodes. So technically, we're only getting 15 episodes. I can't remember ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" or ""Star Trek"" pulling this split season scam. And there were over 20 hour long episodes in each season. Let's not disguise it either. Why do they do this? The answer is simple. If we have to buy 2 sets, it's twice as much money.

Alright. Now that we got that out of our system, let's look at the first 15 episodes of S2 we should be getting here. (1) ""To Shoot a Crooked Arrow"" brings us the one time guest star Art Carney as the archer. This was a funny and interesting modern Robin Hood scenario. (2) ""Hot off the Griddle"" brings Catwoman back and she is after a pair of violins. It's an alright episode. But nothing equals her first episode ""The PurrFect Crime."" (3) ""The Minstrel's Shakedown"" has a sinister Van Johnson coming in as the minstrel. As dangerous as he is, he has the gift of charm and has some especially lethal plots. First he destabilizes the economy, and then makes a plan to destroy the world. (Surprisingly good episode.) (4) ""The Spell of Tut"" brings back King Tut. And this time he resurrects an extinct species for the purpose of making a pill that can paralyze the human will. (5) ""The Greatest Mother of Them All"" brings in Ma Parker. And as lovable as Shelley Winters is, she is dangerous and with her 4 children, she engineers a frightening and rather plausible plot to take over the prison.

(6) ""The Clock King's Crazy Crimes"" brings in Walter Slezak as a bumbling (but still lovable) criminal set on stealing some especially valuable clocks. And Bruce Wayne's pocket watches are on the list!  (7) ""An Egg Grows In Gotham"" brings in Vincent Price as Egghead. And he makes a plot to give Gotham City back to the Indians. Provided of course they give in a high position of authority. (8) ""The Devil's Fingers' brings in Liberace as Harry (a dangerous criminal) and Chandell who is also a criminal, but slightly more reluctant to engage in criminal activity. (9) ""Hizzoner the Penguin"" is a hilarious episode where Batman runs against the Penguin for mayor. And while Batman's integrity is never questioned, the Penguin clearly knows how to campaign better. This is a great episode with large chunks of truth to it. Poor Batman campaigning to 12 or so sympathetic people who are falling asleep during his lecture on issues is so iconic. (While of course the criminal Penguin is sweeping votes left and right due to his political knowhow.  (10) ""Green Ice"" brings in a really sinister Otto Premminger as Mr. Freeze, and his goal is to destroy Batman's reputation and collect a billion dollars in the process.

(11) ""The Impractical Joker"" is a strange episode that involves a plot where the Joker can tamper with time. An interesting side note here is that Burt Ward's (soon to be for a short time) wife is the Joker's hench lady in  this episode. (12) ""Marsha Queen of Diamonds"" is one of the few episodes I didn't like. Carolyn Jones was ok. But I just couldn't get into the story where she hit too many men with a love dart and kept them locked up. (13) ""Come Back Shame"" is an interesting story where Cliff Robertson plays a criminal (but still likable) cowboy. And he is bent on kidnapping some valuable ranch animals. (14) ""The Penguin's Nest"" involves an interesting story where the Penguin wants to be arrested. But why? (15) ""The Cat's Meow"" is an episode where Catwoman has her mind set on stealing the voices of singers Chad and Jeremy. This episode did have some funny moments. Robin ""We have to do something. Millions of teenagers are in hysteria since Chad and Jeremy lost their voices."" Batman ""Ah, yes Robin. That is quite true. However, on the plus side, millions of parents are delighted.""

Is this first half of the 2nd season as good as S1? I would have to give that a firm no. It doesn't quite have the brilliant mixture of comedy, darkness, and suspense that the first season had. S2 does go more the way of campy. Though it is still better than Season 3.

Adam West loved the first season. He kind of liked the second season. He didn't think much of the third season. And after seeing all the episodes, I can easily share his opinion. But while this 2nd season lacks the pure brilliance of the first season, there is still plenty of Batpower in it.",1418601600,33,4536,4.563882063882064

Meanwhile, this animated series consists of Adam West as Batman/inclusive millionaire Bruce Wayne, Burt Ward as Robin/Dick Grayson, Neil Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon, Stafford Repp as Chief O'Hara, Alan Napier as Bruce Wayne's butler(Alfred), and Madge Blake as Aunt Harriet during this shows whole 2-year run on ABC, which usually aired twice a week with a cliffhanger.

Unfortunately, this was also the season when the ratings hit a speed-bump too, which eventually lead to the shows cancellation in the Spring of 1968 when BATMAN unfortunately bit the dust and even Batgirl couldn't help save the show either.

This 1966-1967 Season also had some interesting guest starred villains like
*Art Carey as the Archer
*Van Johnson as the Minstrel
*Liberace as Chandelle
*Maurice Evans as the Puzzler
*Carolyn Jones as Marsha
*Cliff Robertson as Shame
*Vincent Price as Egghead

6729224,4,B00O8J0LJ4,"BATMAN-SEASON 2, PART 1: The first half of BATMAN's sophomore year adds an ever growing list of baddies...the colorful gimmick by which the series lived or died each week...to the core cache of CAESAR ROMERO's maniacal JOKER, BURGESS MEREDITH's cackling PENGUIN and JULIE NEWMAR's skin-tight seductress CATWOMAN (FRANK GORSHIN's deliriously hyperactive RIDDLER is sorely missed). The normally reliable ART CARNEY falls flat as THE ARCHER, CAROLYN JONES channels MORTICIA ADDAMS for MARSHA, QUEEN OF DIAMONDS, and LIBERACE's evil ivory-tickler CHANDEL is inspired stunt casting if nothing else. Much more memorable are CLIFF ROBERTSON's bullet-headed cowpoke SHAME, scene-chewing SHELLY WINTERS as MA BARKER, VINCENT PRICE's brainy, pun-spouting EGGHEAD and OTTO PREMINGER's eyebrow-raising turn as MR. FREEZE (which ups the kitsch ante on GEORGE SANDERS' first season appearance and puts ELI WALLACH's later take on ice). Obviously played less close to the vest this time around, the cliffhanger traps are far more elaborate (making their escapes all the more incredulous), celebrities pop out of windows during every Bat-climb, and CHAD & JEREMY have their singing voices ""stolen"" and held for ransom by CATWOMAN. As BURT WARD's easily excitable BOY WONDER might exclaim, ""Holy hilarity!""

We get mad at our dad for watching Batman without us. The only bad thing is it isn't as great as the first season. Want more intense, watch the first season.",1532822400,,283,4.071428571428571

8682540,4,B00O8J0LJ4,"The gleeful insanity continues in the second season of the classic 1960s 'Batman' series. While the show's heavy reliance on a repeated story formula (as well as similar situations for the caped crusaders to face) has affected its quality a bit, the madcap energy of the villains coupled with the hilariously droll seriousness of everybody else makes for quite a ride. Just two of the many moments worth noting: the Penguin runs for Mayor of Gotham (something later referenced in Tim Burton's Batman films) before Batman nearly escapes getting married to the dastardly Marsha, Queen of Diamonds (played the same actress as Morticia of 'The Addams Family'). Rock n roll group Paul Revere & the Raiders even stop by for a silly cameo. The show remains a delight.",1525305600,,760,4.9453125
