8436942,5,B004O2QPEU,I really liked these Windows 7 training videos.  I hope it's ok that I shared the disc with a few of my older family members to help them use all the new useful tools that are built in Windows 7.  I didn't even know there was a magnifying glass built in and my aunt was telling me a couple of weeks ago that she uses a magnifying glass on the screen sometimes!  5 Stars!,1301184000,3,370,3.972972972972973
