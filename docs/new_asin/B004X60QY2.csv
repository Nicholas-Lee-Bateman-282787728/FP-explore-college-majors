8446087,2,B004X60QY2,I'm surprised nobody mentioned in their reviews that the resolution on this DVD is really low. It might look ok on an old laptop but on an actual TV or Macbook it's really pixilated. The program itself is fine but not amazing enough to justify keeping it when the fuzzy image is so distracting. I would have kept it otherwise.,1454198400,,326,4.45
8446088,5,B004X60QY2,After my second child was born I wanted to strengthen my body and recover faster. This DVD was exactly what I was looking for. It included the baby which my son loved and I enjoyed those simple movements that did have some great benefits on getting back fitness and strength. I could feel and see a difference after one week doing it daily. All in all a great experience. I was listening to it in German and I found the voice to be very calming.,1370908800,,445,4.247058823529412
8446089,3,B004X60QY2,I had never been much of a yoga fan until I did Baby yoga classes after I had my daughter.  Unfortunately they don't offer them on the weekends so I haven't been able to attend since I went back to work.  So I bought this video.  It's okay.  It's just not as interactive as the class I went to and most of the time the baby is just laying on the floor.  The poses weren't very difficult but I was a little bit sore the next day.,1364083200,,428,3.8735632183908044
8446090,5,B004X60QY2,"I was looking for something to slowly get me back into working out like I did before I had my son. I did a lot of power yoga and running before, and briefly did crossfit. This was exactly what I needed. Of course it is ""slow"" like some people said. This is for those days when you know you should be working out but just don't want to. It's just enough to do while your baby is sleeping and not too much that you can't tend to your baby when he or she needs you.

I could do all of this on my own, yes. I know the poses and movements but its great to hear her tell you the next move, and how to incorporate your child if you want to. The vibe is so nice and calming and it's perfect for slowly getting back into a new routine and working up to where you were before.",1362700800,5,766,3.848101265822785

8446093,5,B004X60QY2,"I tried a couple of DVDs ... this one I love. It is demanding and that is what I want. It integrates my baby into the exercises and works the parts that need to be worked :)
There is no background distraction and the feel and look is very calm. The voice is relaxing and the music motivating. I can recommend this DVD very much for if you want to get fit again.",1334448000,4,361,3.958904109589041
