7887792,4,6305322864,"Australian filmmaker Mark Lewis enters the animal kingdom once again, with a look at creatures that most people would just as soon never think of, let alone watch a movie about -- rats.  But this film is as much about human beings and their responses to the rodents as it is about the disease-carrying vermin.
Particularly interesting is the way that Lewis' camera (it must have been a teeny-tiny one) follows rats around underground, through pipes, etc.  The real-life stories of people repelling rat invasions are quite interesting as well.
Not as great as Lewis's best work (CANE TOADS, which is on video, and THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE CHICKEN, which isn't, not yet anyway), fans of animals, documentaries, and animal documentaries will be fascinated.  And it's a rare chance to look closely at rats without actually having to be near them.",970617600,,844,4.929577464788732
