In this movie Dilip Kumar throws in his job when he joins other workers in funeral of a worker killed in an industrial accident, and the management wants to dock their wages. What happens next is that Kumar builds his own mill on the basis of social justice.

The romantic element involves the poor textile engineer taken in and virtually adopted as a son by Dilip Kumarwhose daughter, played by Padmini Kolhapure, falls for, while he has fallen for a rich girl.

An enjoyable movie because of the strong performance by Kumar, who brings his trademark intensity to the role, and because of the reminder of days when Hindi cinema could produce movies that questioned the status quo",1301875200,,881,4.751633986928105
