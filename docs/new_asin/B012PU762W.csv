7357927,4,B012PU762W,Saw the show in London several years ago.  This reminded me of why I loved it live!  Very enjoyable - but no video can capture the excitement of live theater.,1445472000,2,158,4.233333333333333
7357928,5,B012PU762W,"This DVD is the film of the musical which has played in the West End, London, Broadway and throughout the World.  The cast is magnificent!  The direction is excellent!  The choreography, set design and music are all fantastic!  My Wife and I saw the show in Chicago and we now have the DVD to enjoy again this excellent musical.",1445212800,13,328,4.508474576271187
7357929,2,B012PU762W,"I could not disagree more with the previous reviews. The performances may actually be excellent but who can tell? The dizzying, fast cut, editing makes it impossible to watch. A previous review said that it was like being in the theatre. It is nothing like being in the theatre. They change cameras every 3 seconds--it is cut cut cut. The editor/director or whoever was responsible for this had to have had so much caffeine he couldn't help himself. These people are under the delusion that the show is not good enough to carry itself without their making it more alive or more interesting by the frenetic editing. The material DOES carry itself. It does not need their ""artistic"" aggravation imposed on it. It will make any theatre lover nauseous. And I really like the show. Why can't they just leave it alone and let us enjoy the purity of the show?",1445126400,10,852,4.6490066225165565
7357930,5,B012PU762W,"I have been wanting to see Billy Elliot The Musical for many years but never thought I would get the chance until this blu ray was released. Watching Billy Elliot The Musical Live was like I was actually in the theatre!

7357931,5,B012PU762W,"This is one of the most exciting musicals I have seen in many a year. It has a bite that I find missing in the original movie which, by the way, I liked a lot. The young man who played Billy was remarkable. The finale was outstanding. Don't miss it!",1444780800,19,249,4.0
7357932,5,B012PU762W,"The Wait is Over.

I saw this on November 15.....and I have been waiting ever since for chance to order it. The ""LIVE"" show has been on my wish list at Amazon since November 16. There are other film versions but they are in formats that do not play on my DVD/Blue RayI have the dramatic film in two versions and the screen play on my shelf already.  I am a fan and as such I am also critical. My critique: it was marvelous.

Fathom Events, ran the film on three days as a 10 year anniversary event film LIVE at the West Theater where it continues to run. This unique cinema event featured the return of Liam Mower, the first boy ever to play the role of Billy on stage, in the role of Older Billy. PLUS as a special treat, 25 past and present Billys reunited for a very special mash-up finale that was stunning! The show has fascinated millions, won 80 theater awards along the way, including 10 Tony Awards  and launched dozens of careers.

TO BE CLEAR......THIS IS NOT A RETOOLING OF THE STAGE PLAY FOR THE BIG SCREEN.
THIS IS THE STAGE PLAY PERFORMED BEFORE A THEATER AUDIENCE.

We get a behind the scenes tour with the lad who plays Elliot Hanna who plays Billly and then the curtain goes up. The cast is perfect with

Billy Elliot the Musical manages to capture the energy, emotion and historical relevance of the original story, film and this LIVE version translates extraordinarily well (a salute to expert camera and microphone placement).  The clever, insightful and touching lyrics of Lee Hall, who also wrote the book and film screenplay, were brilliantly brought to life within Elton Johns music, both having a freshness not seen in the often formulaic musical format.

We see dance in many forms:  ballet, tap, jazz, modern. The music is memorable and the lyrics powerful. The Billy Elliot character in the live transmission, starring the appropriately named Elliott Hanna, conveyed the role with a maturity which will serve him well in his future career.  There are moments of pure tear-rending pathos, especially in his conversations with his dead mother, moments of explosive energy and anger, tentative searching, self-doubt and salty regional language balanced against self-awareness and eloquence.  There is true humor in unexpected places, and some hysterical action between Billy and a cross-dressing boy, Michael, who nearly steals the scenes with his flamboyance.

Having seen the musical twice before on stage I still found myself surprised by the complex social relationships and the variety of human experience framed within this story which expands on the settings and characters seen in the original film.

Set against this soul-searching by the children is the gut-wrenching realities of their families played out in a depressed northern English County Durham mining town where Prime Minister Maggie Thatcher and the Constabulary are the enemy at a time when the coal mining industry was dying.  The women in Billys lifeMrs. Wilkinson who sees his promise and teaches and grooms him for a better future, and his Alzheimer plagued but comical and loving grandmotherprovide the moral support.  Billys older brother and father are striking miners fighting a losing battle against economic misery, family financial hardships, and emotional devastation. His ""Da's"" transformation from angry and disappointed father who does not want a ""poof"" for a son to the man who makes the dream possible is believable and touching.

They ensemble creates compelling historical snapshots from the Thatcher years.  ""Da"" and big brother don't approve of Billys seemingly frivolous and unmanly attraction to ballet and would be happier to see him boxing. But Christmas party play where puppets and dressed-up miners act out their grievances towards Thatcher and her government provides the setting for their realization that there is nothing for Billy there.

Eventually it is the  solidarity and insularity of the miners to take up a collection to send Billy to London to audition for the Royal Ballet School, among the most important donations is from a scab or strike-breaker.  At first the gift is refused but ultimately the most important thing, to give the child a chance and to, at the same time, create a moment of pride for the entire community, wins the day.  Against all financial odds, his lack of training, and cultural and class differences, Billy wins a dance scholarship and leaves to start a new life, leaving the old, crumbling society behind him.

The curtain call at the end of the show concluded with a special finale in which current and former Billy stars from around the world dance together on stage.

I just preordered my copy and will host a ""Billy Watch"" Party when it arrives.",1441756800,49,4713,4.944233206590621

7357947,5,B012PU762W,"Beautiful adaptation of the movie.  Elton John's music captures the feeling and energy of the movie and then some.  Very moving at times as Billy deals with all that's on his plate:  the miners' strike, his family, his absent mom, his dancing talent.  Elliot, the boy who plays and dances Billy, is marvelous, so are Tony and Jackie.  Well worth the time to watch and enjoy.",1488499200,,374,4.606060606060606

7357952,5,B012PU762W,Excellent filming of the British stage version that knows how to dart in for close-ups while properly keeping the camera back when the stage is thickly populated in the musical numbers. Gives the viewer a true feeling of watching the show as if being there in the audience. Extended curtain-call scenes include one surprise dance number in which former Billys reunite. English subtitles are a welcome option if you want to catch all the salty dialogue.,1484092800,,452,4.9605263157894735

7357954,5,B012PU762W,"This is the same performance of the West End hit musical that was shown in cinemas as a Fathom Event.  It marks the 10th anniversary of the musical and includes a special finale with as many of the boys who played Billy through the years as they could round up.  The original opening night Billy, Liam Mower, plays grown up Older Billy, which is a perfect idea.  This is a nice filming of the production before a live audience and a treasure of a record of one of the superior musicals created during the first ten years of the 21st Century.",1481587200,,541,4.336633663366337

7357959,1,B012PU762W,I was happy to get my Billy Elliot Musical live! The movie is very good! But on the bottom of the screen the whole movie was closed captioned in a foreign language!

7357963,4,B012PU762W,I only rated the Blu-ray with four stars because the copy is somewhat dark. I compared it to a PBS Direct TV DVR copy played on the same plasma TV and the DVD is noticeability less bright.  Otherwise the Blu-ray is complete and has no noticeable other issues. The show itself is amazing in every way and filled with outstanding talent through and through.  A must see.,1472083200,,368,4.477611940298507

7357967,4,B012PU762W,"I'm not going to review the musical. It's great as evident from the bazzillions of awards it's received here and abroad. The DVD itself is a well done rendition --might be the same one that was broadcast on PBS. But, you cannot fast forward. You can only go from chapter to chapter. This was an issue for me because I got the DVD to prep for an audition for a part in a local production. I couldn't efficiently watch the parts I wanted to study. I had to play it on the TV and then film the segments I wanted on my phone. But then, the picture is tiny unless I broadcast it to the TV and that means I have to read the darn manual and then the quality is not as good second hand.",1470614400,,678,3.9926470588235294
7357968,5,B012PU762W,"Love this. So nice to be able to get this version that was live in the theater. The talent of the whole cast is amazing and ""Billy"" just blew me away. I am currently loaning this to all my friends to show them what live theater really is.",1470441600,,238,3.9791666666666665

7357974,5,B012PU762W,Be prepared for strong language but aside from that Superb Performance. The most culturally relevant musical ever. You can connect with at least one character old or young.

7357978,5,B012PU762W,Billy Elliott is fantastic.  I have seen several productions of this script on major stages and in local theaters.  It's a script that stands the test of time and provides a platform for many talented artists; especially the young boys who play the two young-male roles.  This production is especially good.

7357989,4,B012PU762W,"It's well worth having in my collection, but I think that to realize just how good Elliott Hannah is you need to have seen him dance as an 8 year old in the TV lets dance competition where he and and his 10 year old partner finished 2nd. Hannah played Billy as the main part for the final 18 months at the West End and had only just turned 11 years old. Most Billys were 12 years old or more before they started.",1461456000,2,412,3.9759036144578315
7357990,5,B012PU762W,I saw this show live about 2 years ago.  I liked it then and this follows the live show very well.  The story itself is something of a sad retelling of the 1984 miners strike that eventually resulted in one of the most poverty stricken areas in the UK.  The story concentrates on Billy and his future which is a good counter balance to conservative England's class warfare.,1458432000,,373,4.455882352941177

And the young actor who played BILLY? Beyond words. The songs are either fun, poignant or both. Elton had lots of fun with this score. You hear phrases from LES MIZ. You hear the vamp from New York New York. He even copies his own music. Its just a wonderful theatrical experience. The viewer is engaged and thus feels part of the stage performance.

Elliott Hannah, the young star of this show is absolutely astonishing.  The entire cast is spectacular. The music, by Elton John is out of this world, the dancing is exciting as can be.  I have just now finished watching it for the 17th time received it from Amazon 8 weeks ago.  If you have a high definition TV & a blu-ray player, order that version.

The stage musical is far better than the original movie (which was still good), bringing a variety of emotions to the viewer. Also knowing that the 12 year old star is on stage moving and dancing for most of the show is amazing in itself. I am a huge fan of Broadway and this show is now one of my top 3 favorite shows.

7358028,5,B012PU762W,"Cush!  (British word for excellent or awesome!)

I'll confirm the English Subtitles for Deaf/HH are great. So far that I can tell maybe 2 times when a spoken sentence is not subtitled probably due to indistinct voice. The Special Features are available in subtitles, too! (Intro by Elliott Hanna is 5:30 mins and Behind the Curtain is 11 mins).

I got this because PBS blurred out some of the gestures and bleeped out the curse words when they showed this show on PBS. (Grrrr, PBS!) I have seen the regular DVD several times already. Video quality is excellent enough for me (I don't have blu-ray).

Suggest you check out list of British terms or slang at Billy Elliot Forum or PBS first (do a search) before watching the DVD. ""Howay"" means come up. ""Owt"" means anything. ""Puff"" means gay. ""Fanny"" means crotch (in this show, Debi's p--y). ""Slagged"" means to talk badly about. ""Bairn"" means child. ""Sunderland Poly"" is a British school probably equivalent to community college or night school (easy to get into and graduate from). ""Esquire"" is an older form of address (like Mr.). ""I have packed it in"" means have quit or stopped. ""Trainers"" means shoes. Etc... Certainly wish some of the British terms were used by us in America. :)  I'll start using ""Cush!"" in my everyday language.  (front of DVD case is of a different older Bill (George Maguire...not Elliott Hanna). DVD was sold by Amazon and to me in America. I'll add pictures of the Billy Elliot souvenir programme and the dialect page. (It was about $17USD incl shipping which you can order from the Billy Elliot London store...the programme makes a nice complement to my DVD).

7358045,5,B012PU762W,"""Billy Elliot: The Musical Live"" is a wonderful production on the London stage.  Elliott Hanna is a delight as Billy, a very talented eleven year old who is mature beyond his years with his singing, dancing and acting.  Indeed, the entire cast is excellent, giving superb performances on all fronts.  The musical is set during the early 1980's miner's strike in the north of England.  Admittedly the language is a bit rough in places, but it is true to the time and circumstance of miners on strike.  ""Billy Elliot: The Musical Live"" is a joy to see and hear with music by Elton John.  It will make you sing, laugh and even shed a tear or two, this sensitive story of a young boy coming of age and coming to terms with his passion for dancing.  It will make your heart sing.  It quickly became one of my two favorite musicals (""Les Miserables"" is the other.)  ""Billy Elliot"" gets ten stars from me - you must see this one!",1447804800,3,922,4.408284023668639

The entire cast is outstanding, and because of the closeups, all the accents are easy to understand.

7358052,5,B012PU762W,"It has been noted on news sites there is a ""Billy Elliot Effect"".  Though males are still comparatively rare in the ballet world, their numbers in ballet schools, and notably the Royal Ballet School, have been increasing over the past decade, and the Billy Elliot story has been credited with the increase.  It is recognition, perhaps, that ballet is not what many people think it is.  One can advise the little guys when they begin they will become stronger than they can imagine now and at the end be able to leap like Superman.  It will be hard work, when passion must push through pain, and demand commitment throughout childhood; yet, not everyone can be the Nutcracker Prince. The show can provide the encouragement they will need.

Critics have loved this show, but critics toil not nor do they spin.  They cannot conceive the Hell of coal mining or the injustice of socio-economic-political systems that divide the working class  against itself.  They overlook the hatred, anger, and death wishes aimed at national leaders.  They dismiss the consequences of a Socialist nationalization scheme that betrayed the workers and cast tens of thousands of them into the maw of abject welfare poverty, the lowest class.  I think they liked the tap dancing.

I am not a critic.  I'm a paycheck-earning member of the working class.  But I have an opinion, such as it is.

I believe the musical is tells the story better.  The young boys cast as Billy have strong ballet training that included tap, acro, and street.  It takes years to build the skill, core strength, and endurance needed for this role.  Billy is on stage ninety-five percent of the time. This may be one reason the producers are very selective.  Auditions can take two years, I have read.  The success of their show rests on the shoulders of twelve year olds.

In this DVD, filmed in September 2014, Elliot Hanna was the thirty-fourth Billy.  He was the youngest boy, ten years old, ever cast as Billy in the London production.  Ten years old is remarkably young.  He was about twelve, more or less, in this presentation, probably tired after (I suppose) four hundred performances, and transitioned away from the show in March 2015.  Early in the Angry Dance scene, a four minute tap tantrum at the world, Hanna appears to come down hard on his left knee and then grabs the thigh in his hands for a beat before rising.  (He was dancing on a raked stage.)  In a cheeky moment, he hugs his ballet teacher, and the actress has to pry him away.  The Swan Lake pas de deux, the only scene of real ballet in the show, when Billy day-dreams he is an adult dancer, provides the catalytic moment for his father, who secretly sees Billy's passion for ballet for the first time, as does the audience.  For a story about being authentic to oneself, pursuing a passion for ballet, there is precious little ballet in the show, but the day-dream leads to that precious moment of acceptance between father and son.  Though I'm not comfortable commenting on children's performances, Hanna was very good.  He had a fine, expressive line.  It is regretful the production likes to single out one little star from the team of rotating performers, however.  All the boys must be very good dancers or they would not be there.

Alex Ko, one of the boys cast as Billy in the Broadway production, wrote a memoir about his early life and experience in the show (""From Iowa to Broadway: My Billy Elliot Story"").  It's not easy being Billy.  For Alex, there were family challenges; financial strains; the ubiquitous and bulletproof Facebook trolls; and a serious dancing injury that risked everything.  His memoir bears reading.
