7922207,3,B00004T3AE,"This 1997 Italian documentary with British narrator is generally interesting, but as a DVD production is bare bones at best. For instance, there are 5 episodes (one per DVD), but no way to determine their order, which is quite annoying given that there is a short recap at the start of each episode but no way to determine which DVD(s) the narrator is refering to.  At the end of each episode, the narrator mentions the name of an upcoming episode but try to find it in the 5 titles given.  The product code on each DVD is sequential, but seems to have no relation to the viewing order.

To add to the confusion, there is also a good deal of needless repetition among the programs.  There are virtually no credits, no acknowledgment of who had been interviewed, no sources for the photographs and video, no documentation whatsoever.  Then, most egregious, in the episodes where Roswell, New Mexico rancher Mac Brazel is mentioned, a photograph of Dwight Yokum from the made-for tv-movie ""Roswell"" is shown.  How lame can you get?

One program is essentially devoted to an interview with Whitley Steiber and one with Zacharia Zetchin, but you'd never know it from the titles or scene menus.  The other three episodes are essentially interviews with Italians about their ufo experiences.  These are dubbed into English, but there seems to be little correspondence with what is being said in Italian and what the narrator translates into English.

As I noted, an mildly interesting, though not revelatory, flawed, bare-bones production.",1157587200,4,1533,4.929961089494164

not the 'aliens' movies, December 11, 2001

evidently a few rocket scientists are buying these confusing it with the aliens movies w/sigourney weaver? it's not, DUH...""

Heh.

Indeed...

I'm at a loss as to how anyone could possibly confuse the two?

Some people are just lazy, and/or lack the attention span to read... I know I have had to deal with such people on online auctions. Sigh.

ANYWAY... moving right along:

This is an 'okay' documentary series, of an average quality on the subject of UFOs. Not the best, but certainly far from the worst. I consider it good enough to have a place in my collection.

If you are a UFO buff who is familiar with & collects such videos, you should not be dissapointed with this series.

If you have only a passing interest in the subject, I would still recommend this series, with the caveat that it is probably not in the top 10 UFO doco videos out there.",1138665600,3,921,4.527272727272727

Well i don't think so and neither do billions of others around the globe. But until i have seen it with my own eyes i remain 1% sceptical. But it's that 1% thats annoying...The 5discs contain much sparkling theories if your relatively new on the subject they will open your mind that little bit further......",986688000,8,417,4.726027397260274

7922211,1,B00004T3AE,"This is NOT the Alien Legacy box. I was very disappointed when I received the DVD's. I send them back the same day without even watching them. I hope this review is helpful for the 'real' Alien fans (Alien, Aliens, Alien3 and  Alien Resurrection).",963878400,87,247,4.613636363636363
7922212,1,B00004T3AE,"This is NOT (I repeat, THIS IS NOT) the 5-disc series of the popular Ridley Scott series based on the movies starring Sigourney Weaver. Don't be fooled by the reviews and details above. I was. I should have known better  that they would sell all these movies for this low of a price. This might  be good if you are into UFO/Unsolved Mysteries sort of thing. I can't say -  I didn't watch them.",962841600,44,393,4.283783783783784
7922213,4,B00004T3AE,"this is an excellent collection of movies.  I am a huge fan of Alien and Aliens.  Aliens 3 and Ressurection are decect flicks, but not as great as the first two.  The last picture included is a documentary, which  chronciles the history of the Alien saga. I found it to be very  informative.  This is a must have for Weaver fans and Sci-Fi fans alike",961718400,2,350,4.3076923076923075
