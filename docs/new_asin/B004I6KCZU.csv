8430208,5,B004I6KCZU,"As my title asks ---Where was this? I've seen Jay Graydon's name on some album credits both as songwriter and session player. Recently I saw a ""You Tube"" video of Jay and David Foster, I was blown away and immediately ordered what I could buy from Amazon. This music is as good or better than most anything currently on the charts. Of course it helps that he uses top notch session cats, the guys from Toto and Bill Champlin from Chicago plus David Foster as well. This makes for a really great sounding CD.",1341187200,2,507,4.404255319148936
