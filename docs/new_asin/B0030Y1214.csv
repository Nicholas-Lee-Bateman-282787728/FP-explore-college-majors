8386237,2,B0030Y1214,"When I purchased these discs I could not wait to get home to watch them. Boy, to my surprise, I was very disappointed with these discs. While the story-lines on most of these discs were quite entertaining, the music was quite inappropriate. The music on most discs sounded like jazz rather than traditional western theme music. The worst thing of all, these discs had the poorest sound and especially picture quality I've ever heard and seen.  After watching these discs I became angry that such poor quality material was released for sale to the public. I've purchased other discs of westerns and they were very good in sound and picture qualities (such as the bounty hunter, have gun will travel, and gun smoke, just to note a few). Granted, discs like the restless gun (my favorite), frontier doctor, cimarron city, and shotgun slade had good story-lines. In summary, I rate the picture and sound qualities of the discs zero out of four stars. The story-lines quality of such discs rate two to three out of four stars.",1289174400,11,1021,4.768361581920904
