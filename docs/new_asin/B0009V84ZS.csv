8184051,4,B0009V84ZS,"Having bought a sitar, which came with a not-too-helpful manual, I bought a book (""Learn to Play on Sitar"", also from Amazon), but I still had a lot of questions.  There are some things that just make more sense when you see them.  He does a good job of explaining tuning (the top strings, not the sympathetic strings), and the sitting position.  He got me to the point where I had my sitar in tune (ignoring the sympathetic strings), sitting correctly, and making some noises that weren't terrible.

Of course I still had questions - but this is only the first video in a series.  Playing the sitar is just not something you are going to pick up in five minutes.",1140998400,5,663,4.446280991735537
8184052,4,B0009V84ZS,This is a good video to introduce those new to the sitar to things you will need to know.  The Dhun at the end is also entertaining.,1087603200,6,132,3.888888888888889
