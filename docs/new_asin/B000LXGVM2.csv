8164925,4,B000LXGVM2,"Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute is interviewed concerning Peak Oil, efficiency, carbon fiber, energy and world culture. Amory comes across direct with quantified examples. He holds a ""bowl"" of carbon fiber that is stronger than titanium and will revolutionize transportation by making cars, trucks, trains and bicycles stronger and lighter, thereby increasing energy efficiency.

We have ""substituted oil for knowledge"" for so long we find it difficult to think of a ""softer path"" such as efficiency. We cannot image earning higher profits by using less. Amory Lovins, the Rocky Mountain Institute and others have led the way for a long time. This interview just reinforces that Lovins focuses on solutions, not problems. Brief, concise and on point. Excellent!",1175644800,,774,5.45
