So the story is about a man who loses his wife and daughter in an airplane crash but finds out there were survivors a child about 6 years old the same age as his daughter and a woman.

From who are they running from and who is the woman who keeps him away from his child with people chasing him and her this gets better as it goes along. Now I have told you a little bit as there is a lot more to this, now to keep you interested I'll leave you hanging in mid air as not to totally disappoint you and tell all.
