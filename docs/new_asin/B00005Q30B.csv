7949587,5,B00005Q30B,"AFTER SEX is a funny movie about contemporary relationships. Kate (Brooke Shields), divorced, and three girlfriends go to Palm Springs to spend the weekend. In the hotel bar, after many, many, many drinks, they meet new guys and... Well, when the girls come back home, they have to deal with their own feelings and their relationships.  The first time I watched AFTER SEX, I thought to myself: ""It's so true!"" Now, I watch this charming movie time and time again and I'm quite sure they stole my story! (I`m kidding!) The performers are very natural and real. The soundtrack is lovely (specially the song KISS ME) and it goes so well with the action, that really moves me. In this crazy world we live, where things change so fast and everything seems to be ""one way"", the movie challenges and, more than this, it makes me feel like finding out what comes... after sex.

7949588,5,B00005Q30B,"I actually really enjoyed this movie--a lot. I throw this movie into the category of the successor to those relationship movies such as About Last Night and St. Elmo's Fire, but with a somewhat lighter tone. I thought the ending was well done. The characters and their situations felt real. I don't want to give parts of this movie away, but there are a few interactions with the guys that I found hilarious.
I wish the DVD had more features--actually, any features. Apparently, they did not want to spend a lot of time to put any of those special DVD perks before they shipped it out.",1027296000,20,585,4.528301886792453
