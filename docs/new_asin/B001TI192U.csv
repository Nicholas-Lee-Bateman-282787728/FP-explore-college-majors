3790657,5,B001TI192U,"The phrase ""dream-like"" is overused with psychological-suspense movies, but it's more appropriate here than any other movie I can think of.  Mix one part Dark City with one part Road to Perdition, and you have a mixture of the strange, looping story that is Nobody.

The story is a collection of a few scenes told over and over, each time through a different lens, concluding with possibly the most creative ""Whodunnit?"" surprise ending I've ever seen.

To get into almost any detail on this movie would be to give away too much; suffice it to say that if you enjoy being puzzled and challenged, and you like your noir as black as coal, this movie's a safe bet.",1246924800,14,661,4.584745762711864

3790660,1,B001TI192U,I would like some of the drugs used by those giving this crap five stars.  Kept waiting for the end to redeem it; it did not happen.,1427673600,,132,3.888888888888889
3790661,5,B001TI192U,"This movie has no ending and is a marvel of the most complicated rubric cube of a film ever devised and way past macabre or morbid.  It deceptively draws the audience into corridors and passageways only imagined; a dreamlike landscape more unintelligible than ordinarily encountered in, other than in, perhaps, a Fellini film, or one by David Lynch!  This is a film not to be missed by the discriminating theatre goer!",1423526400,,418,4.873239436619718
3790662,3,B001TI192U,An interesting story and a great production - but it just falls short and its hard to pin down why. I think its because we get no real idea why this is happening or why he does what he does once he realises what is going on.,1418860800,,224,3.7872340425531914
3790663,5,B001TI192U,"I rated this movie five stars for originality and the acting abilities of the characters.  I will probably end up watching it again. The ending as I understand it anyway, was not an ending at all. I'm sure I missed certain points as well; or perhaps not.  Maybe, the movie was based on just a simplistic recurrence of events caught in a loop due to the witches curse.  The phantom an active  thought form from the previous cycle shadowing the main characters.  I do feel that the movie was intentionally set up on the vague and that sometimes the simple can appear complex.  One thing for sure, the witch was collecting a silver coin from each recurrence and it didn't seem like she wanted to end the cycle any time soon.

The movie was very film noir, and very dark. As surrealistic as it was, the movie was still very realistic in its own way.  An excellent film for those who like riddles and the metaphysical and believe that sense is no sense.  I would not recommend the film to someone unless they like this kind of movie.  Otherwise, it could be seen as nonsensical and illogical which can lead to an altogether frustrating movie watching experience.",1416009600,,1157,4.545893719806763
3790664,3,B001TI192U,"Gritty and dark this film plays like a pulp noir graphic comic book. I liked it but was not able to figure it out. I got lost in the time shifting narrative. The film is well done and my rating would be higher if I was not so confused by the plot. Still, I give this film a lot of credit for being out-of-the-box, way out. Recommended.",1412553600,,335,4.014925373134329

3790666,5,B001TI192U,"Outstanding, done in the film noir style of the 50's, but in color with a wonderfully creative script, like eating a jelly roll from the inside out.  You keep tasting the last flavor, but in a different place.  If Pulp Fiction was over your head, this one will be in another zip code for you.  This one is for lovers of cinema, not movie goers.",1410652800,,344,4.2615384615384615

3790668,1,B001TI192U,"I could only get through about 30 minutes. It was literally and figuritely dark, hard to follow and understand what it was all about.",1408752000,,133,4.583333333333333
3790669,4,B001TI192U,"If you like Costas Mandylor, you will love this. He stars in and does voice over...nice deep voice.  Sexy underrated actor.

Somewhat confusing noir story shown in flashbacks....but kept my interest (mostly due to Costas, another lead and I might have stopped watching) and wraps up ok at the end.

 I liked it.  Recommended for Mandylor fans especially.",1406419200,,354,5.0344827586206895

3790671,5,B001TI192U,"this is the best budget/no-name film you will ever watch.  it is better than most of the other films on here, even though you won't recognize anyone in it and it was obviously made on a shoestring.  I keep watching 'those' kinds of films in order to find out whether it really takes a lot of money and big-name stars to make something good.  nearly always, I'm terribly disappointed because ultimately, some element of the film is so obviously amateurish that it spoils the whole 'suspension of disbelief' that you're really trying to give the thing.  this film has it all--incredible convoluted plot, great acting, nice shots (not expensive, but done with an eye for what looks great regardless, so done with benefit of an artist's skills).  if you, like me, watch these unknown films hoping to find a gem in the mud, you have finally found it.  it won't quite make up for watching all of that other crap, but nearly almost.  now, if they could just make big budget films more like this.  but why ruin a good thing?  let big budgets keep their uniform-looking leading men and ladies, their same ol'plots (something about superheroes, probably), and their strict emphasis on appearance (since appearance is now everything.  man, we've lost any depth as a culture!).  I will gladly take more no-name films from this Shawn whosifrass.",1402531200,3,1332,4.798245614035087
3790672,5,B001TI192U,"Excellent acting with a fascinating script. Why have so few people watched this? My wife and I were in suspense from the beginning to the end.  It was a nice mixture of film noir, surrealism and a great atmospheric effect.  It was not easy to categorize which led to its originality. There were elements of  the gangster and horror (supernatural) genres. It is a very nice contribution to the Canadian film industry (shot in Manitoba) as well as world cinema.

  This really was a ""sleeper""  movie.  It was definitely a movie that made you think. However, if you want a predictable cliche type movie with a simplistic plot, this is probably not for you.

Cheers from two Canadian expats!!",1393459200,5,688,4.714285714285714
3790673,5,B001TI192U,"In NOBODY we follow a mysterious man (Costas Mandylor- DINOCROC, SAW 3-7) as he traverses a dark, sinister netherworld. All we know about him is that he's some sort of hitman, he's carrying a package, and he's been shot. He's looking for answers. What's happening to him? Who is the old blind woman? What is the answer to / meaning of her riddle? What's in that damned package? Slowly, the story reveals its secrets. Bits and Pieces of information start to add up. NOBODY is a tale of murder, retribution, karma, and absolution. In the end, it all makes a strange sort of sense...",1392681600,5,580,4.586538461538462

Please someone ask them to upload the movie without the overlaid talk from the director. Its a good movie, but the rating is for the one uploaded. I can't hear the dialogues of the movie as there are a lot of people talking. I hope Amazon fixes this soon.. cheers. I recommend this movie not this version.",1363737600,,452,4.267441860465116
3790675,2,B001TI192U,This is a director's cut version - looked like a good movie but I couldn't hear it over all the talking.  Would much rather hear Costas talk than some writer/director.,1341100800,3,167,4.566666666666666
3790676,5,B001TI192U,"The movie was very entertaining, Costas Mandylor was very good playing a role in blackface.  He is very underrated, Ed O'Ross was also very good, You will either love or hate this movie, there is no in between.",1312848000,6,210,4.526315789473684
3790677,3,B001TI192U,"One of those movies that is going to average two and a half stars because most people are either going to love it (5 Stars) or hate it (1 Star).  Rather confusing for the average movie goer, but if you really like to sit down and pay close attention you may enjoy it.  Not a movie for a large group.  Surprise ending not that surprising.  Many viewers are just going to say ""What? Huh?? I don't get it!""",1274054400,2,403,4.128205128205129
8341490,5,B001TI192U,It's a great movie but the majority of the main character's narration is missing from the Amazon Prime version. The narration is by far the best element of this film as we learn so much about the character's insights and thoughts as he goes through these bizarre experiences. Without it a large element of the film has been stripped away. If you want to view this film I would recommend ordering the DVD instead of watching the Amazon Prime version.,1507593600,,449,4.625

8341492,4,B001TI192U,"The reviews on IMBD are as polarized as Congress, but a few intriguing comments hinted to a well shot artsy time-bouncing thriller; so, I took a chance and boy am I glad I jumped on this taut little film noir trampoline.

Wisps of voodoo, then fantasy lead to a blackface assassin caught in an endless violent circle like an old Victrola needle stuck in the groove to play and replay a gruesome tune.

Nobody is a terrifically enjoyable viewing experience - well acted with gritty 40's gangster dialogue.  Don't try to make sense of it, the logic's all there, just nicely deconstructed and rejoined by a blindfolded witch.",1491264000,,622,4.7407407407407405

Spoilers ahead, but all the negative reviews contain them so you probably can read this and then see the film but it not stop reading and watch.

A poor very poor twilight zone type movie much as a bad cop show where the majority of the film is just noisy car chases....repetitive and boring. That being said it would probably make a good read.
