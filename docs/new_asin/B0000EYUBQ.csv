1938013,3,B0000EYUBQ,"An Irish movie set in 1920.  It starts kind of slow, like a period piece, but eventually picks up.  It's about an older IRA gunman in hiding who befriends a wholesome and nave (and well brought up) eighteen year old girl.  It's a wonderful movie.  And the history is authentic.",1026518400,3,277,4.48

1938020,2,B0000EYUBQ,"As an Anthony Hopkins fan I am sorry to say this is not his best movie.
We watched this as a family and one fell asleep, one took the dog out
for a walk and the rest watched to the end and agreed it was a very slow
movie. The one reviewer that stated it livened up as it went on, I don't
know where or when. I was falling asleep. I have a collection of Hopkins
movies but this one is going to the book sale next year. I gave it 2 stars
simply because of Anthony Hopkins as a part of the movie.",1371081600,2,493,3.704761904761905
1938021,4,B0000EYUBQ,"I found this movie very interesting.  Although I have been a fan of Anthony Hopkins and have followed his career, I somehow missed this movie. I would definitely like to watch it again.  I know very little about the young actress in it.",1370131200,,236,4.465116279069767
1938022,5,B0000EYUBQ,A forty-ish gorgeous Anthony Hopkins. Set in Southern Ireland in 1920. He's a Republican. Armed Black & Tans (from Scotland) patrol the streets under martial law. I ordered this film & watched it 4 nites in a row. Haunting harp music from Simon May - cannot get it out of my head. This is a MUST SEE.,1310601600,11,300,4.280701754385965
1938023,4,B0000EYUBQ,"""The Dawning"" is set in 1920's Ireland and the beginning of what is referred to as 'the troubles' or their war with England for independence.

Nancy (Rebecca Pidgeon) has just turned 18 and is getting ready to go off to university.  She discovers ""Cassius"" (Hopkins) in an abandoned beach hut she'd claimed as her own.

Cassius tells her up front he's a dangerous man, but Nancy doesn't fear much.  Orphaned at birth, she's lived well but on her own most of her life.

When he entrusts her with a mission, Nancy accepts and takes a message.  12 English soldiers are killed as a result.

The movie explores Irish times and politics after WWI and the dawning of the IRA.  It's a slow film, but often the dawn does break slowly.  Very well acted on Hopkins and Pidgeon's parts.
