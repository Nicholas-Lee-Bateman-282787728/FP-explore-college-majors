8347469,1,B001WBGW08,"I absolutely hated this DVD. The quality seemed low-budget; the content was annoyingly repetitive, and the arrangement of the combinations on the DVD just didn't make sense to me. The whole DVD seemed to lack the fluidity and continuity that bellydancing is known for.  I've purchased three other bellydance videos that I REALLY liked, even if they were difficult. This video and I just didn't jive.",1286150400,,399,5.045454545454546
8347470,5,B001WBGW08,"I have been looking for an advance belly dance disk for a long time and this one was really the only one that offered routines that I thought would bring me to learning whole performances rather then focusing on separate mechanics.  The disk did not disappoint me, it is challenging enough and easy to follow for an advanced beginner. I purchased other belly dance disks before and some were good and/or great to practice routines but I never felt that I want to ""dance like that"".  This is the first disk where I ""felt the dance"" and my body wanted to keep mastering the routines further and further. Music is great, performances are absolutely beautiful.  The only area where this disk could be improved relates to replay and menu functions.  This is because each of four performances (which are accessible via the main menu) are further broken down into 5-7 smaller routines and because of the way the disk is set up I have had difficulty in finding my way to replay those routines and getting back to the part where they are connected in one performance.  Still, this is one of my favorite disks and it is definitely worth the money!!!",1264809600,,1139,4.618811881188119
8347471,5,B001WBGW08,"The only advanced instructional that has the written choreography with the break down of each combination and eight count exactly!!!! Easy to follow!!

Volume 2 features choreography to Om Koulsoum's ""Alf Leyla"". The piece is sensual and dramatic featuring the haunting classic as played by none other than San Diego's own ""Middle Earth"". The ""Alf Leyla"" track can be found on their latest CD titled ""Lavender"". From dramatic back bends and turns, an extensive floor work section and a healthy amount of complex layering throughout, this choreography is sure to inspire and challenge beginning/intermediate through seasoned professional level dancers.",1237680000,5,651,5.575757575757576
