423214,5,630210131X,"Shirley MacLaine stars as a movie star and Yves Montand plays  her director-husband. He wants to film Madame Butterfly in Japan with an all-Japanese cast. She plots (with producer Edward G. Robinson) to disguise herself as a Japanese actress and do the film without telling her husband, to prove she can do a serious role, even though Montand wants to prove he can make an important.  She dresses as a geisha, gets the part, and they start shooting, but her co-star, Robert Cummings, starts to fall in love her.

MacLaine is overly-cute and almost annoying, until she redeems herself in the final scene. Yves Montand is very, very attractive, French accent and all. He is good at playing the sensitive man whose pride is crushed by his tricky wife. Robert Cummings is the comedy relief and keeps things lively as the leading man who chases all his leading ladies. Robinson is properly gruff and cranky, as one supposes rich and powerful producer might be.  This is a really enjoyable family film.",1030320000,9,996,4.807017543859649

423286,5,630210131X,"This 1961 gem of a technicolor film offers beautiful views of Japan and its people, with red haired and impish Shirley MacLaine as an American actress disguised as a black-haired and black-eyed geisha.  She does this just to secure a part in her husband's all-Japanese film about Marame Butterfly.

The result is a comedy as she must stay in this part and kimono-and-wig disguise lest the American men catch on.  She is so charming and girlish and coquettish, it is funny.

She can act demure and self effacing and shy, quite contrary to her real personality.  She wears contacts to change her eye color to black which is her signal to us that she is switching from her open American womanhood to her suppressed Japanese style.  She informs us that contacts were invented in Japan.  One can see that, sixteen years after the war, there is an effort to show Japan as modern and a positive place. The teenage Japanese girls are chewing gum and acting like nasty and demanding sububan American kids, down to the clothes and hair.  I think the film was trying to reassure the world that Japan had changed and improved, and it was no longer to be feared.

What is truly impressive is how she appears to sing the operatic part of Madame Butterfly. Does she really?  Costumes are delicious and saturated colors are everywhere.

Does she fool anyone with her charade?

She fools the husband. A French director plays her husband.  He drawls a broad French accent tough to understand, how did the Japanese camera crew and actors understand him? He grows agitated near the end realizing that she will carry away all the glory on opening night.

To keep her marriage, she does the unthinkable by modern standards.  She puts on her Japanese self to the public at the opening night and essentially does hari Kari to her role.

I am not often surprised but this ending did surprise me.

 Life in Japan is no picnic and their men are another kettle of fish.

But there is something truly charming about thr Japanese woman.  Come see an American actres make that clear!",1428883200,,2052,4.662952646239554

423290,5,630210131X,"A favorite of mine for decades.  ***MILD SPOILERS***  This film was a thinly veiled take on Lucille Ball's and Desi Arnez's marriage.  Clever, red-headed comedienne Shirley Maclaine (Lucy Dell!) is married to French director Yves Montand (Paul Robaix), perceived to be riding on his wife's coat tails.  The film is about the machinations involved in Montand trying to gain recognition in his own right- but, unbeknowest to him, his wife has a hand in everything.  (In truth, Desi Arnez was the real genius behind the scenes and the one who literally engineered his WIFE'S career, but that wasn't widely known at the time.)

Another interesting wrinkle is that the movie was produced by Steve Parker, MacLaine's real-life husband (of nearly 30 years), who worked and lived in Japan with the couple's daughter, so while filming there MacLaine could stay with her family in their home (orchestrated by the couple so they could spend time together).

Though the movie is outdated in that men's careers are assumed to be of far greater importance than women's (1962!), I don't care, I love it.  I'm a big fan of both Shirley MacLaine and Yves Montand (could listen to Montand read the phone book), and  the chemistry between them is potent, everyone's acting is top-notch.  MacLaine over-acts shamelessly as Madame Butterfly, in the ""film within a film"" (over the top, love it), but as both American movie star and modern geisha, she's superb.  This is Shirley's show all the way, she gives a tour de force performance.  Edward G. Robinson lends craggy charm and quiet dignity to the proceedings, Robert Cummings is at his skirt-chasing (albeit over-the-hill) best, and lovely Yko Tani is perfect as wise Kazumi.

Alternately funny and touching, this is a romantic, sexy comedy of the highest calibre, at its heart the story of a  love between two driven, imperfect people.  The film has more character development than the average rom-com (and puts others of the era, like Doris Day or Dean Martin movies, to shame).  It has an impressive pedigree: written by Norman Krasna, who wrote the screenplays to several other of my favorite films, e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-and-Miss-Jones/dp/B00B27WTBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil and Miss Jones</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Christmas/dp/B000IBUOX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Christmas</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bachelor-Mother/dp/6301564480/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bachelor Mother</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-O-Rourke/dp/B002KE4ZIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess O'Rourke</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-Started-with-Eve/dp/B00CBD8S8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It Started with Eve</a>.

It was directed by Jack Cardiff, not only a great director (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sons-and-Lovers/dp/B00GNLY0CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sons and Lovers</a>), but one of the best cinematographers of all time (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-African-Queen/dp/B003F3KKCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The African Queen</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Red-Shoes/dp/B009B6I0SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Red Shoes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Narcissus/dp/B00D0K025K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Narcissus</a>, many more)- and the colors, clothing, costumes (Edith Head won an Oscar for costume design), locations (e.g., Mount Fuji) and settings are all GORGEOUS, eye candy, the Eames era on steroids, plus Japan in the early 60s.  Much of the comedy results from the clash of cultures- Hollywood meets traditional Japanese values.  The ending is dramatic, hokey and WONDERFUL.  Highly recommended!

Certainly some of the sexist elements of the storyline are dated by today's standards (a  woman should never be more important professionally than her husband )but the storyline is fresh and original and Maclaine should definitely been nominated for an oscar for her extraordinary doiuble sided performance.

Like Julie Andrews in ""Victor Victoria"", you need to suspend disbelief a little, even with the Geisha makeup, one cant imagine how husband Yves Montand doesnt recognise her, but the performances and the charm of the idea and the lush cinematography an d the theatrics of the piece make up a delightful package. Interesting to note that the film was inspired somewhat by Maclaine's relationship with film producer Steve Parker who also produced the film and to whom she was married at the time of the making of it.",1237420800,2,1052,4.871508379888268
423380,3,630210131X,"Not a bad little comedy; interesting flick of Shirley playing ""Lucy"" a big star in film with her director husband.  Director husband does not like being in her limelight and so tells her she cannot be in the picture he has in mind as she would not fit in.  He does not bother telling her the truth, however, that he wants to be successful without her.  Without this info, she takes it as a challenge and gets her producer, expertly played by E.R. Robinson, to go along with the gag.  Considering the time period this was filmed, I thought they handled the Japanese culture fairly well, though the English-accented Japanese was a bit much.

That earns it the three star treatment, I'm afraid.

Funny scenes include Shirley caught in the act where she has to talk to a Japanese Sumo wrestler and talks Japanese gibberish at him (sounds like she is talking to ten and saying hello and goodbye and thanx!).

Yoko Tani plays the actual Geisha who's trying to train ""Lucy"" to be one.  Yoko is known for being the Asian actress in the Communist-bloc film, First Spaceship on Venus.

Bob Cummings was fairly awful and I do agree with Amazon reviews that he was badly cast for the part.

The director does use split staging rather than film scene splitting, which makes it all very interesting.

If you loved Lucy, you'll love this one....

The VHS tape was clean and ran great, too.  Is this on DVD now??

423384,4,630210131X,"MY GEISHA, starring Shirley MacLaine and produced by her then-husband Steve Parker, is a very cute comedy lushly-filmed on location in Japan.

When celebrated movie director Paul Robaix (Yves Montand) decides to do a new version of Puccini's ""Madama Butterfly"" on location in Japan, his actress wife Lucy Dell (Shirley MacLaine) secretly follows him, dresses in traditional geisha costume and lands the title role!  An hilarious comedy of switched identity ensues.

Shirley MacLaine positively glows as Lucy, and looks very beautiful in her geisha disguises (Edith Head deservedly received an Oscar nomination for her colour costume designs).  Yves Montand, always a little bit stiff when paired with his American leading ladies, tries his best to conjure up a rapport with MacLaine, but this is very much Shirley's show.  Edward G.

Filmed entirely on location in Japan, MY GEISHA was the climax of a fascination with the country for MacLaine and her husband Steve Parker, who lived there for a period.  The visuals capture Japan at the height of it's beauty.

423417,5,630210131X,"I was in ""Geisha"" mode a while back and was hunting down anything I could find.  I came upon this gem on the Romance Channel and was enchanted.  The thing I was most impressed with the respect the filmakers showed for Japanese culture and Geisha in particular.  We get a rare glimpse into a time period during which Japan almost lost its identity through all things western.  And it was an interesting parallel to have the epitome of modern western culture (at the time) Lucy Dell, portraying that most mysterious bastion of traditional Japanese culture that is the Geisha and at a time when the profession was just starting its decline.

  As for Japanese actors shooting Shirley McLane dirty looks, I thought that was part of the fun.  The Japanese crew knows Lucy isn't Japanese, but the French guy and the Americans are too smitten (and clueless) to notice.  And let's face it, it's Shirley McLane playing an American woman trying to play a Japanese woman.  I think her stereotypical accent was part of the character.

  I was in Kyoto about a month ago.  There are only 160 Geisha and 40 Maiko (trainees) in all of the Kyoto hanamachi.  One day, the profession will die out and this film, along with a few documentaries, will be all that is left.

423422,2,630210131X,"With the possible exception of The Possession of Joel Delaney, easily MacLaine's most bizarre film. Here she's cast as a Hollywood slapstick queen who's so desperate to be taken as a serious actress that she secretly flies to the Orient and, unbeknownst to her film director husband (Yves Montand), poses as a geisha to land the lead in his movie production of Madame Butterfly.

Any resemblence to a remarkably similar I Love Lucy special of three years earlier (wherein Lucy and Ethel posed as geishas to fool their husbands while on vacation in Japan) is practically italicized. MacLaine's character has red hair, like Lucy Ball---and her character is even named ""Lucy Dell."" Need more convincing? Bob Cummings figures prominently in both the TV sitcom *and* this movie!

What might have proved amusing as the punchline to an outlandish '50's sitcom (husband doesn't immediately recognize wife under geisha drag, but when he does, turns tables on her--ha ha!) is weak tea stretched out to feature-length and played relatively straight. And despite being billed as a comedy (laughs are few and far between, even when intended), this is actually more of a soap opera, with MacLaine constantly fending off Cummings' advances while using her disguise to test her husband's fidelity. The jarring movie-within-a-movie climax (a sobbing MacLaine commits hari kari with a samurai sword--a buzz kill seen twice!) hardly adds to the fun; meanwhile, a dour Montand wanders through the proceeedings looking like he's just had a bout with a plate of bad sushi. Beautiful location cinematography just points up the artificiality of the rest of theproduction.

Ironically, just a year later, MacLaine would be much better served by the same trite disguised-lover plot (with Jack Lemmon as the masqueradee) in Billy Wilder's infinitely more entertaining Irma La Douce.",1167955200,2,1855,5.239057239057239

Fans of Yves Montand will not be disappointed for he brings a surprising range of emotions from one scene to the next, alternating between witty banter(particularly with Bob Cummings) to gripping heartache near the end of the story.  The supporting cast is solid, led by veteran actor Edward G. Robinson in a role that is a far cry from his ""Little Caesar"" days.  One of my few complaints lies in the fact that once in a while a Japanese extra will scowl at Shirley MacLaine when she is portraying her Geisha character with a little too much stereo-type.  I certainly don't blame them for cringing once in a while.  It would be like a young Japanese man portraying a Redneck Cowboy in front of a crowd of extras from Texas.  However, Shirley MacLaine nails this role down pat after a few scenes early in the film where first-time director Jack Cardiff probably should have gone for another take.  There are a couple of scenes that look too staged to be believed, while later in the film there are some excellent scenes with fantastic acting from all concerned.  Once in a while there is also some voice-over dubbing that doesn't quite match the lip-movement.  There are a few other scenes that suggest that Jack Cardiff was once a stage director at one time, such as: instead of having a split-screen effect and editing the actor's voices in later, the whole set is cut in two with a thin partition separating the action on either side as the actors do their scenes on the telephone.  It makes for a great live effect that feels kinetic and touching .  A while back, say ten years ago, I was in a Shirley MacLaine-fan mode and I rented everything I could find with her in it.  I saw ""The Apartment"" and I thought she was the cutest actress I had ever seen, yet she had more emotional range than I had initially anticipated.  I was subsequently thrown for a loop.  I rented ""My Geisha"" in the hopes of seeing more stellar work from her, and in all seriousness I am surprised she was not nominated for the Oscar for this role.  She plays two different characters, she is comedic, she cries, she sings, and she is absolutely gorgeous dressed as Geisha Yoko-Mori.  As for the comedy in this story, Bob Cummings rules the roost here inducing full-throated chuckling on my part through the use of witty dialogue and his understated, under-rated physical comedy.  This film has plenty in it to recommend it whole-heartedly: comedy, romance, wit, glorious photography, oftentimes inspired direction from Jack Cardiff, and four great lead performances mixed with some solid work from the supporting cast.  Now if they'd only release this little gem on DVD my collection would reach one step closer to perfection.  Take it easy...and don't jump into any volcanoes!  Thank you.",1088985600,27,3340,4.742214532871972
423424,5,630210131X,I never would have noticed this movie if it hadn't been for me catching it on Cinemax. Well the movie was great and i plan on buying the video or dvd of this to watch it over and over again. Shirley McClaine's potrayal of Lucy is so fun to watch and I am slowly getting to rediscover the classic movies. This is certainly among my favourites. She looks so believingly like a Japanese Geisha girl. The movie certainly touches your heart towards the end. Do certainly buy it or rent it. Don't miss it...,1086912000,8,501,4.340425531914893

7821103,5,630210131X,"Paul Robaix (Yves Montand) is a top notch movie maker. The only problem is that every one attributes his success to his actress wife (Shirley MacLaine.) To prove himself, he sets out for Japan to do a remake of 'Madame Butterfly', with out his wife's participation.

Unknown to him, the studio, represented by Edward G Robinson, has condemned him to a black and white film. His wife has cooked up a scheme to extricate her husband from the situation.

Will this plan save face or become the downfall of their career and marriage?",1503446400,,529,4.67741935483871
7821104,5,630210131X,"If you only get to see one and only one movie in your lifetime, it should not be My Geisha. But if you've seen all the great ones, you have the right kind of background and perspective for this extraordinary work of piffle. I saw it when it came out, again in its second run, and after that at a drive-in theater, the small screechy speaker hung on the driver's side window.

The DVD is gorgeous, the beautiful filming owing to the peerless Jack Cardiff, who can make you think the shots are really where they look like they're happening, on Mount Fujiyama. If you look closely you can see they're not what they appear to be. Cardiff (as cinematographer) fooled us in Black Narcissus, making us believe the scenes took place in the Himalayan Mountains, rather than the studio lot.

This time, not only do the settings deceive us, but the characters deceive each other in the same kind of way.",1473120000,,892,4.5
