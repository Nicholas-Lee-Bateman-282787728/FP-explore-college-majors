Don't be hoodwinked into spending your post 9/11 harder to earn money on some slick artwork cause inside is nothing but low budget garbage with bad lighting and the typical back stage ... with the black MC's partaying with them  white thangz and it's like porn...bad porn at that, It's not insightful, it takes you no where and leaves you with nuth'n but a headache and a feeling like you was robbed!",1034467200,,432,4.538461538461538

7954201,4,B00005U4VK,"I really only started listening to the Alkaholiks when they released ""*X.O. Experience"" as Tha Liks.  I really, really liked that album, so I went out and bought the other three albums, and really enjoyed them, too.  So, when i heard that there was a dvd out of them, i knew i had to find it.
It was hard to find.  In fact, i didn't find it on any store shelves.  I had to have Best Buy personally order it for me.  But after all the wait for it to arrive, I am happy to say it was all worth it.
Tash, J-Ro and E-Swift are as funny and as entertaining as ever on this 83 minute long dvd.  It includes live concert footage, low-budget music videos for about 8 or 9 songs off of ""*X.O. Experience"" cd, and many hillarious skit-like parts throughout the dvd.
The funniest part is when J-Ro and E-swift go to a big billboard advertising ""*X.O. Experience"" cd.  Well, they stand in front of it to see if any people who pass buy can recognize them.  They stand there from 11:45am till 4:15am, with no one recognizing them.  This goes to show that Tha Alkaholiks still don't get the props they should.
The reason I gave this 4 stars is simple.  There wasn't a 4.5 stars button because that's what i would give it.  The only problem was the price.  [item price] and tax is a little too much to pay for a 90 minute dvd.  I could get a 2 Hour motion picture on dvd for about $14, but i wonder if it would have been as good as this *X.O. Experience.",1023753600,4,1438,4.129496402877698
7954202,5,B00005U4VK,"I've been an Alkaholiks fan since way back in middle school, so when i heard they were releasing a DVD, i was the first to get it. I must say, i really enjoyed this. From beginning to end, its packed with, females, chronic, live performances, skits, and freestyles from the members of the Likwit Crew. I also enjoyed this video because i had never really seen footage of the alkaholiks besides the Best U Can video which rarely showed on MTV and BET. So if you cant get enough of the Liks, then i recommend this DVD",1017014400,,515,4.319587628865979
7954203,5,B00005U4VK,"i bought this dvd at a store & i love it. it not only has material from earlier Alkaholiks albums, but it has a good look at what they are doing these days. lots of freestylin from my favorite rappers & it makes me wish i was a rapper!
