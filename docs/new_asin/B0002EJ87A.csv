It's on very early in the a.m. on Noggin, so I purchased this for my daughter to have when the TV-mood strikes.  The narrator's voice is bright but calm, and not condescending; the characters do not have voices of their own.  I feel like my daughter's at a well-done story hour.  Best of all, she enjoys it, is learning from segments like ""The Same Game.""  One more plus: when you pop it into the DVD player, it actually starts without any commercials and other nonsense that precede a lot of other kids' videos.",1169078400,11,654,4.6521739130434785
