If I hadn't been told  that certain scenes were supposed to be ancient Israel, I would never have guessed.  There's some poured concrete and it looks like a modern construction site or perhaps someone's backyard and garage.  A few cute Jewish kung fu puns (Shalom instead of Shaolin) aren't enough to make up for the overall confusion. The dialogue is limited and is frequently interrupted by lame fight scenes that look like high school students ineptly re-enacting scenes from their favorite Bruce Lee movies (which is perhaps what was actually happening).
