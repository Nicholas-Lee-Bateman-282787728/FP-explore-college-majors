1692000,5,B000063UTS,"I rented the movie a couple of times now and would like to purchase the movie but I find the price too high!
I liked the movie for a couple of reason.  The way the relationship grew was interesting and made me smile alot.  I liked the fact that the contents were clean.  No sex scenes and everything was gradual and they way things unfolded seemed real.  They had a good chemistry together.
I found that Christian got cuter and cuter as the movie went on and I loved the way he related to Monica.
I hope the price goes down soon!",1024272000,3,529,4.1568627450980395
1692001,5,B000063UTS,"I saw this movie the first time it premiered on MTV, and I have been in love with the movie ever since. Since watching the movie I have become a huge fan of Christian Kane, the actor who stars as Monica's bluesy love interest.  I have to admit he's the real reason why I love this movie so much.  He's such a talented singer and I could watch this movie over and over just to hear him sing.  If you guys like what you hear in the movie from him - you should check out his band Kane, and their website which I believe is Kanemusic.com.  You won't be sorry!!!!!!!Your ears will thank you later!!",1021161600,5,593,4.130434782608695
1692002,5,B000063UTS,"Boy meets girl, girl is betrothed to another.  Boy opens a new world to the girl.  Girl has some tough choices to make.
This story just draws you in from the very beginning.  While it is simple it is no less intriguing for its simplicity.  I watched it every time it came on MTV and every person that I know that has ever seen this film had the same attraction to the characters.
The love between these two is steamy and intense without having to run the kids out of the room.  It's a great story with a hopeful message for humanity:  ""It's best to see the person and not the ""label"" and let your heart decide.""",1017446400,2,611,4.17948717948718
1692003,5,B000063UTS,"Monica is excellent in this movie. It really shows how great of an actress she is, and guess what she got a perfect on her first try. Being the Big Fan of Monica I am, kids at school had mixed fellings/comments about the movie, but I told them did you not notice the strong love in this film. It's truly moving, remarkable and brilliant. The film sets a calm and cool mood. It has Blues music in it to create it's vibe and storyline. This movie--oh my god you got to see it, It's number one and I love it. Words can't express how good this movie is, but that's why I'm telling you to see it. I Looooooovvvvvveeeee you Monica. The costars Essence Atkins, Christian Kane & Rachel True were excellent Actors and Actresses. Enough Talk JUST BUY THE MOVIE.",1016755200,2,751,4.333333333333333
1692054,5,B000063UTS,I love this movie. It is a must see. Christian Kane did a marvelous job. Monica not so much. But I still love it. I bought mine from Hollywood Video for $10.00. If you want a great movie this is it. And Christian Kane got nice ears so do Rainbow the other guy who played Monica's boyfriend. A must see movie. Monica can't act.,1275955200,,326,4.109375
1692055,5,B000063UTS,"I saw this movie when It first came out, I though that Christian Kane was cute, but I recently wanted to see it again because of Christian's role in Leverage.  I loved this movie so much that I've asked Netflix to get it, so I can rent it from them.  Monica and Christian look great together and their scenes seemed so real, this made me wonder if they were couple in real life at some point.  I'm a 32yr old african american woman and I think that Christian's hot and this role won over a large percent of his african american female fans today. Great job to all who started in this film.",1250899200,5,589,4.1946902654867255
1692056,5,B000063UTS,I love the movie but im not paying 55 dollars for a VHS or DVD that's outrageous!,1250812800,3,81,3.823529411764706
1692057,5,B000063UTS,Chrisian Kane shines in this movie. He played young Hub on Second Hand Lions and I was hooked. This was just one more wonderful performance by Christian. This movie was beautiful.,1208563200,,179,4.806451612903226

I agree with everyone this movie was great and it is a love story
I just bought it hoping to convert it to DVD for my own personal viewing since my VCR died long ago, and with copyright codes which i do understand why they are in place i still have it in VHS form and can't watch unless i buy a VCR
so i agree put it in DVD format and i beleive u would sell alot of copies i would buy one again, since monica and christian are both still very popular",1203120000,4,586,4.91919191919192
1692059,2,B000063UTS,"I was very interested in viewing a movie about an interracial romance and this one provided a good one; however, Monica Arnold really could not act. Her character came off stiff. It was obvious that there really was not a chemistry between her and her lead man. Overall, I wish that I had waited and just rented the thing!",1170806400,,322,4.47457627118644
1692060,5,B000063UTS,"I really want to see this movie but in the DVD format because I do not have a vhs player only dvd.
Using a VHS is still like using your grandparents very old beta player or an eight track player.
So come on [...] get with the program. Geez. So are there any vendors out there that have it in DVD format in brand new unused condition???",1167091200,4,335,4.014925373134329
1692061,5,B000063UTS,"I knew of Christian Kane through the Angel series and never really took much notice until I watched this film on Hallmark.  And boy did my opinion change!!!  As soon as Christian breezed onto the screen covered in grease, my jaw hit the floor.  That face, that accent!!! And what a singing voice.  I would recommend this to any hopeless romantic.
I can highy reccomend the band KANE [..] and totally agree this film REALLY needs to be brought out on DVD!!!",1158883200,4,456,4.524390243902439
1692062,5,B000063UTS,"I got Love Song by mistake but really enjoyed it and kept the rental for days past my rental time.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves a great romance movie.  I wish I could find this movie in rental stores now but I can't.  It needs to come out on DVD, soon!!  Great modern day love story.",1147046400,3,296,3.9661016949152543
1692083,4,B000063UTS,"From the moment I saw the promos on MTV, I knew 'Love Song' was 'MUST SEE TV' for me. Being an avid fan of both Christian Kane, the actor and Monica Arnold, the songstress, I was very anxious to see them mix it up and try filling each other's shoes. I was not disappointed.  Monica proved that singing isn't her only talent and I was totlly blown away by Christian's singing ability. The storyline was the classic boy meets/looses /gets girl back but with an interracial twist. The characters, Camille and Billy Ryan, were very likable. The script realistic and often funny, and oh how I wish they'd release the music as a soundtrack! If you're a hopeful romantic, Love Song is worth the watch.",1123200000,5,694,4.552
1692084,5,B000063UTS,I saw this movie on MTV when it was first released. I enjoyed almost every bit of it. Christian Kane made a great debut in this flick showing his remarkable acting skills as a bad boy but good hearted struggling blues musician. Monica does a great job herself making her character believable. It would be nice to see this released on DVD.,1121299200,8,338,4.467741935483871
1692085,3,B000063UTS,I think Monica did a good job in her first movie. I enjoyed the movie but I wouldn't buy it and watch it over and over. The story was very believable but prejudice against biracial couples still live on unfortunetly.,1103328000,3,216,4.425
1692086,5,B000063UTS,"I remember when i first saw this on Mtv..this movie was i think one of the best Mtv tv movies that mtv made.
 this movie is a modern day love story....A young, privileged medical student (Monica Arnold-R&B singer Monica) finds herself torn between a fellow med student who has won her father's approval and a struggling blues musician (Christian Kane- known for lindsey on Angel) who has won her heart. i want this movie to come out on DVD come on paramount mtv release it on DVD.",1098576000,25,480,4.517241379310345
1692087,4,B000063UTS,"Like the other reviewers, I loved this movie and watched it several times before I had to return it to the video store.  Unlike most of the other reviewers, I thought Monica's acting was just ok.  She seemed a little forced sometimes but it is a good first effort for her.  Christian Kane was definitely great.  He played a wonderful bad boy character next to Monica's very good girl character.
The acting of the supporting actors and actresses were cool, except I thought the actor playing the Dad was way, way too stiff(even for his upper-crust character).
The chemistry between his and Monica's characters was great(as opposed to Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner in The Bodyguard).  My biggest complaint would be the intimacy between the characters.  There could have been a way to make their scenes a little hotter without getting too graphic.  There's only two kisses between the characters in the entire movie.  They don't even touch hands or embrace that much. If there were a few more scenes like the one when Billy tries to kiss her for the first time, the overall story would be much more believeable. I'd give the movie 5 stars.  It's a good movie to teach young people how to follow the heart in end.",1077408000,5,1213,4.683962264150943
1692088,5,B000063UTS,"I fell inlove with Kane's and Arnold's characters right from the beginning. The chemistry between them was very tangible and hot and this was especially protrayed in the song they sang together. I could not stop watching this. My children keep saying ""Mom not again!"". Kane's character Billy was awesome, he came across as tell-it-like-it-is, confident man. A person who will not let an opportunity pass him (when he sees something or someone that he wants). When I think about Billy one word comes to mind PASSION. I also liked the internal conflict Arnold's character felt in trying to please her parents, and friends. The realization of her love for Billy gave her the strength to break away from the hold her parents and Calvin had on her and the freedom to pursue the career of her choice. Billy was her ""Mojo"".",1075939200,6,816,4.753521126760563
1692089,5,B000063UTS,"This is good stuff. Of course Monica plays a singer and sings a song in the end :) But it's all good. It's not a movie that only dwells on her as a singer. It's fun, colorful and heartfelt. Of course you should like soulmusic, if you watch this... :)",1074038400,,250,4.02
1692090,5,B000063UTS,"This movie was just AMAZING!!! I can't even put into words How Much I Love This Movie!! I've Watched It Over a 100times already. I Taped it when it first came on MtV.I want to buy the movie,but it's to high!! Anyway me being the biggest Monica fan that I am,will buy it one day!!!Anyway I recommend this to anybody. Something you can watch with the WHOLE family!!It's just excellent!!Monica You Were Great in this movie for it being your first!!!",1066608000,2,446,4.518518518518518
1692091,3,B000063UTS,"When I first heard about this movie, I was definitely skeptical. I had seen my fair share of singers trying to be actresses, so I wanted to see for myself if Monica could pull off a starring role.
For the most part, I thought the story was very nice. Monica did a pretty good job with her acting. However, there were moments where her emotions seemed forced - almost as if she was trying too hard. Christian Kane did an excellent job as her love interest even though I wish his character would have been developed a little more.
Overall, this is a pretty good movie. It was nice to see a movie about an interracial couple where things turned out for the good and the characters didn't let society and their families determine their happiness.",1049068800,10,742,4.463235294117647
1692122,5,B000063UTS,"Not since ""The Jeffersons"" has interracial love been such an integral part of our culture.  ""Love Song"" proves this.  Camille Livingston and Billy Ryan make such a fantastic couple that I want to jump into his shoes.
The Monica and Christian Kane on-screen chemistry was so powerful, I am surprised that it has not spilled over into their real lives.  As for others in the cast, I think Essence Atkins and Rachel True should give up their roles on ""Half and Half"" and start a series titled Love Song (on UPN, of course).  I hope there will be a ""Love Song 2"" with Camille and Billy tying the knot.",1042329600,4,597,4.4495412844036695
1692123,5,B000063UTS,"This movie was wonderful. It had three beautiful females, especially Essence Atkins, and the story was very romantic. If you like romantic comedies you will love this movie. I would reccomend it for anyone.",1040428800,,206,5.088235294117647
1692124,5,B000063UTS,"I love this movie b/c of the songs.  Why isn't there a Soundtrack to this movie?  How can you make a movie with such good music and not make a soundtrack.  Monica does an excellent job of singing ""Angel"" by Anita Baker.  That was a song I thought noboby needed to remake b/c Anita Baker did a wonderful job but Monica proved me wrong.  But besides the music the story line is pretty good too.  I just wish the price of this movie wasn't so high.",1039824000,,445,4.116279069767442
1692125,5,B000063UTS,I rented this movie on a rainy day with nothing else to do.  From the beginning this movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go.  It's a movie that I can relate to.  I watched it 2 times in one day and can't wait to watch it again.  What a great job.  Leaves lots to the imagination (which is rare these days).  A must see.,1036108800,3,326,3.9384615384615387
1692126,5,B000063UTS,"I really loved this one. Monica really did it. For this to be her first acting debute this is a hot movie. I truly think Monica is one of the most gifted R&B singers out you really just have to give her a chance and watch she will shine. I think her and the late Aaliyah was the greatest of there times. And with this movie I hope more offers come Monica's way so It can expand her horizon. So to all of you Monica fans her debute from J-Records hit stores on either November 12, or the 19th which ever date it is go out and support our Miss Thang. You got singers that don't even have a talent like Ashanti get recognized. So Monica fans lets get out there and help our true Princess Out. One Love",1033084800,4,698,4.028776978417266

1692128,5,B000063UTS,"I rented Love Song, watched it and just fell in love with every part of it.  I lived in New Orleans and have roots there so I know about the beauty and its prejudice color struck history.  This movie was so well done and I applaud the beautiful and talanted cast.  I love interracial movies anyway but this one is more special and pure than most I've seen.  It touched on family issues, family pressure, friends acceptance, following your heart no matter what...WOW, it had it all!  I am super proud of my girl Monica and the rest of the cast.  This was a LONG overdue film.  The ""brown bag skin issue"" was strong in New Orleans, especially at Xavier University. They are known to prefer and accept lighter skinned blacks as students.  I was just glad to see a film which finally told the TRUTH about a lot of things.  YOU SHOULD BUY THIS!!",1031529600,8,840,4.367741935483871
1692129,4,B000063UTS,"This was a really good film. I had this film imported from the USA for [a certain amount]....Which in AUSTRALIAN dollars its double and thats not including the postage and handling cost...If only this film was released in AUSTRALIA.So this film cost me alot of cash,but it was totally worth it. I thought this film had its own type of style. The good thing is that it kept up that style through the whole movie,it didn't let me down. MONICA done a great job with her acting,i was impressed and her remarkable singing vocal cords adding to the film is what made it even a better film. Lots of people might think this is a girlie film. I don't think so at all. Im a guy and i loved it.",1029542400,,683,4.2615384615384615
1692130,5,B000063UTS,"I thought this was a great movie with beautiful people. Wow, as a parent, I can believe that someone would take a chance and write a story about people really caring about each other.  It's been a long time since I've seen such a wholesome movie about young people falling in love without sexual overtones or any violence.",1024963200,,322,4.551724137931035
7959743,5,B000063UTS,THIS IS A VERY GOOD LOVE STORY. IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT THE GIRL IS BLACK. AND THE GUY IS WHITE. THEIR CHEMISTRY IS SO UNIQUE FROM THE BEGINNING.

7959747,3,B000063UTS,"The overall storyline isn't bad, but let's be real. This movie is corny as all get out, and I think it gets worse every time I watch it. However, it is 16 years old and can't be faulted for that. But, we should all thank Monica for sticking to singing afterwards. Back when it came out, I was just happy to see a black woman-white man relationship as the lead story, and I was ecstatic that man was Christian Kane. After falling in love with him on Angel, it was great to see him in other roles. Till this day, I follow his career, and to be completely honest, he's the only reason I watch this movie repeatedly. His singing is good, his looks are great and his acting is the best in the cast. Now, I realize this is a rare find, but this VHS has been listed on here at 70ish dollars for years, which is ridiculous, because obviously it's not selling, and newsflash: it's a VHS! I'd like to have it for my collection, but I'll continue to watch it on YouTube until the price drops or I find it in a thrift shop. As for my Christian Kane fix, I'll continue to watch all five seasons of Leverage on repeat, brush up on some cooking skills with Kane's Kitchen and look forward to the season three premier of The Librarians. #Kaniac",1461196800,,1228,4.229787234042553

7959749,4,B000063UTS,"I loved this movie...hv always been fan of both Monica & Kane who I feel are under-rated & under exposed. I know it's not full of the usual hollywierd over the top nudity & sex..but I am fine with that. I would love to have the sound track & wished there had been a sequel showing how they blended their differences  to make a dynamic relationship. And for those who think this is too unreal...believe me it's not. My oldest brother who is black..born & raised in the ghetto..went on to graduate from college with honors found his soul mate in the person of a Chinese American whose parents emigrated to the US & lived the American dream in another state. Of all the women he dated..including the 1st one he married & divorced..only she captured
