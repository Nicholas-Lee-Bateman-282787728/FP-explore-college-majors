4831363,2,B005LZW75K,"Yet another installment in director David DeCoteau's long line of homoerotic horror movies.  Only there isn't much homoeroticism (or eroticism of any kind) in this one, and certainly no horror.

Peter and his friends travel to his summer home on a remote, wooded island for their annual vacation before returning to school.  But this summer something unpleasant is in store for the boys.  Waiting for them is Danielle, the more than a little unbalanced young neighbor of Peter's.  The previous year the group (with the exception of Peter), apparently attacked Danielle (the story is a bit vague), who was rescued by Peter.  Now she is out for revenge.  And she has a powerful friend on the Island.  Bigfoot!  She is en rapport with the creature and summons him to wreak vengeance on her attackers.  One by one the guys are stalked and neatly dispatched by her furry friend.  Only Peter is immune, because Danielle has other plans for him.  Poor Peter!

It sounds like a promising idea for a low-budget horror film.  Only thing is, DeCoteau seems to have forgotten that a horror film needs some sort of suspense, and there isn't any here.  In fact, there isn't much of anything here.  All we have is an endless parade of bare-chested dudes hiking and running and kayaking through the forest, interspersed with scenes of Danielle invoking the spirit of the island.  We barely get to see the creature, which is just as well.  What glimpses we get are not promising.  The acting is bad, maybe the worst I've seen in one of the ""1313"" movies.  The script is pretty much nonexistent.

Still, I give this one two stars for the scenery.  And I'm talking about forests and hills and water, not the masculine kind.  I spent part of my younger days in the Pacific Northwest, and it was a pleasure to see Vancouver Island again.  So kudos to you, David, for the good photography.  But next time make sure you have a story worth capturing on film.",1333929600,2,1934,4.667655786350148
4831364,3,B005LZW75K,"This is so wonderfully bad! But if you're looking for a movie that's so completely bad that it's fun to laugh at, this is a masterpiece.

The majority of the movie is literally composed of shot after shot of shirtless guys running through the woods while someone in a cheap orange gorilla suit stalks them. It's weirdly bad. It's like soft-core porn meets Ed Wood. Just set-ups, awkward acting and cheap costumes. Think Scooby Doo meets an Abercrombie shoot in the woods of Oregon.

Apparently there's a whole series of these homoerotic campy horror movies. I'm going to watch them all.",1331856000,8,586,4.792079207920792

Just watched the trailer for this movie: no underwear shots at all (if you've ever seen a Decoteau trailer, you know they're pretty much nothing BUT undie shots).  Shirtless guys, yes, many, many shirtless shots, but nothing briefer than cargo shorts.  Especially given that the 1313 series has gotten progressively stupider and lazier, there doesn't seem to be any reason at all to pick this up.",1323302400,6,502,4.9523809523809526

4831377,1,B005LZW75K,"This movie is boring in the extreme. Lots of shirtless guys walking on trails through the woods, punctuated with brief, dark, and blurry sightings of the  bigfoot. A girl is apparently mentally communing with the bigfoot. She mostly sits on a rock crosslegged while chanting ""Omm"". I really enjoy ""so bad it's good"" B-movies, but this one is an exercise in extensive padding, and fails to entertain in any context.

Lots more fun to be had in ""Boggy Creek 2: The Legend Continues"", a delightful and cheesy Charles B. Pierce outing.",1465862400,2,531,4.824175824175824
4831378,1,B005LZW75K,"For the love of God, please do NOT watch this film. This film in a nutshell was so boring that I started yawning and questioning as to why films like this exist on Amazon Prime in the first place.

Everything in this entire production value is boring, tiring, and just stupid; the characters, the plot, the dialogue, the camera shots, etc. The settings just drags on like a ball and chain, attempting no risks whatsoever. There is one gem in the rough where someone gets knocked out, but that one scene cannot compensate on how awfully boring this is.

There are no attempts on character development or backstory for the men and women in this movie. The flashbacks serve no purpose because it explains very little to no explanation as to why these characters are this way.

If Uwe Boll made a Bigfoot film based on a successful videogame, this would be that film except on a budget of $5,000 or less. Rifftrax would tear this film a new one. And seeing how there are at least six more, which could be just as ridiculous garbage as this one is,
1313: Bigfoot Island clearly states you should avoid them like the plague.",1465603200,2,1118,4.524752475247524

4831383,1,B005LZW75K,"This movie was a rip off of another stupid Bigfoot movie. Watch the 1st 16 minutes of this then watch the first 16 minutes of Bigfoot vs DB Cooper. They are the same exact scenes but with different actirs. However the actors are dressed identical, they walk some of the same paths, the horrible monkey suit was the same for both movies. Even some of the same Bigfoot footage was used in both. They totally copied one another. I'm betting the same stupid producer did both. He should have his camera revoked. Horrible setup, directing, acting, writing... Y A W N .... everything was bad.",1464652800,4,586,4.59047619047619
4831384,1,B005LZW75K,"It's easy to detail the movie's virtue (singular): the setting is magnificent.  There's very little dialogue, but quite enough to make the viewer profoundly grateful there isn't more: repeating ""Great forest spirit, avenge me"" is no threat to Wilde.  The cast do not interact.  Two of the young men (apparently inseparable friends, but one couldn't tell it from their lack of chemistry) do arrive together and run towards the cottage more or less together, and the young woman does unconvincingly interact with the young man whom she has earlier watched while he showered; but it appears that the director filmed most of the cast individually, then spliced together the results.  The film begins with a young man, naked to the hips, walking across the screen, then walking across the screen, then walking across the screen, then....  Eventually the filmmakers borrowed a snapping twig from J. F. Cooper.  This gives the young man the opportunity to seem startled, then run back across the screen.  If watching shirtless young men do nothing is one's idea of a good time, this is the film for him/her.  Otherwise, not so much.",1464652800,6,1125,4.978609625668449

4831391,1,B005LZW75K,"I don't get it. What I don't get is why anyone would fund a movie like this, nor why anyone would try to find some sort of redeeming value in it. High school films made by students are FAR better than this was. It's mildly suggestive of something, but we were never quite sure what. The guys are all (but one) shirtless, so we thought that maybe it was trying to be erotic. But erotic forgot to get the memo and never showed up. Not even in spirit! And how do you get 72 minutes of screen time out of 15 minutes of shot footage? Simple, replay the same scenes over and over and over again. And how do you maximize your income to expense ratio? Pay as little as possible, invest as little as possible. Film it all on low resolution video, film it on logging roads and at a campground. Film it all in one day. It won't take long to get 15 minutes of footage. Enlist your actors with a bulletin board post sent to the local high school football team. Biggest expense being a used, off the shelf bigfoot halloween costume. In orange. Use royalty free music, and who really cares if the score sounds more like a mish mash of mystery films, scary films, disaster films, because to get something a bit more tailored to this particular film would take too much time.

I like funky, bad movies as much as anyone, but this one was just an insult. It really wasn't worth the time. It couldn't deliver on any level. Had it been cheesy, that would have been something, at least. It wasn't even cheesy. It was just really, really bad.

4831393,1,B005LZW75K,"This is probably the worst Bigfoot film I have ever seen. Ignoring the reviews, I went ahead and bought this one because I'm a huge Bigfoot movie fan. What a piece of crap! The single saving grace of this whole film is the beautiful scenery. There is literally no plot. Instead what we get is a steady parade of shirtless young guys running through the woods, inter-cut with scenes of the natural beauty and shadowy shots of a guy peeking around trees in a really, really bad gorilla suit. There is almost no dialogue (probably best considering how horrible what little there is is!), and no acting of any sort. When the Bigfoot catches up with each guy it bitch slaps him to death -- seriously! (and several of the virile studs scream like little girls when attacked, BTW). And there isn't even a hint of blood or gore of any sort after the killings. When we finally do get some ""acting"" (really, really bad) and dialogue (also really, really bad) we get the whole of the supposed plot explained to us in about 5 minutes by one of the characters, and then the film ends. Seriously. That's it. I wish I could give this one 0 stars. If I were hard pressed, I wouldn't even call this a movie. Nothing happens and no one speaks (much). And for those seeking the director's famed ""soft core boy porn"" there isn't even any of that sort of thing -- just mundane shorts and shirtlessness -- not a glimpse of underwear (or less) or steamy sultry scenes in sight. So unless you came for the nature scenery you will be sorely disappointed.",1404950400,5,1529,4.464285714285714

The next ten minutes is a guy taking a shower......really weird. The ten minutes after that is another shirtless guy walking in the woods. Mixed in are two or 3,  10 second shots of some chick having really bad flashbacks about the 1st kid offering her sugar. I had enough at this point and turned it off.

The dialogue is horribly written and delivered, despite the actors barely interacting with each other so they are pretty much just reciting lines alone, poorly.  The plot is as weak as it gets and seems to leave almost everything out.  I mean, what kind if maybe witch  is this girl supposed to be  while she chants ""aum"" and summons Bigfoot to do her bidding?  The monster itself is hardly shown but that might be for the best, as any glimpses you do see are of a very poorly made bright orange costume.

And just when you think they can't possibly cram anymore walking into this movie, they do!  Sure there are little breaks of showering, running, and kayaking, but there is definitely walking.

SPOILER ALERT: With about 25 minutes left, they shake things up by changing from guys walking through the woods to guys jogging though the woods!  Abrupt, aimless jogging is not something every movie is brave enough to tackle. I was surprised that they made this bold move but I have to admit, it worked.
