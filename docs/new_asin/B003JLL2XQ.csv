4129892,5,B003JLL2XQ,"Going in to see 8: The Mormon Proposition I was in an odd position.  I have always been extremely supportive of the equal right for ALL people to marry and live as they please.  Too many of my friends and family are homosexual for me to have ever been able to accept any other argument.  I also grew up surrounded by LDS friends in my community and have always made it a point to be kind to young missionaries when they come around.  I understand the difficulties that serving their missions to their faith put upon these young men, and while I am not able to share their beliefs at all, I admire their deep personal beliefs and actually sort of envy people with such a strong sense of their faith.  So when they come around, I make it a point to ask them to come in and rest, share something cold to drink, offer them a cookie or brownie or whatever I have around, and invite them to discuss LDS with me.  I make it extremely clear that I am not going to accept Joseph Smith as my personal prophet and am NOT going to convert to LDS, but am happy to visit with them.

I can't do that anymore.  After watching 8: The Mormon Proposition I am so appalled at the behavior of the power structure of the LDS church that I just don't think I could sit down with these young men and let them go on about their church without absolutely having to discuss the abuses of their leadership -- the totally unacceptable manipulation of the political process by an outside source for the furtherance of their own religious agenda to the detriment of so many people's basic human rights.  It is a discussion that would not be likely to be comfortable for these boys, but I just can't sit through their testimony of their acceptance of their church and what it teaches them without really challenging the morality of exactly what that church has done.

This film is not going to be for everyone -- but for everyone who is willing to listen impassively to a set of well-researched, wee-documented and well-presented facts it will shock you to understand just how deeply the system of government can and has been twisted.  A very valuable piece of education that most people will never have, it needs to be seen by as many people as possible.

I have to determine now if I am going to be able to continue to be supportive of young Mormon men on their mission.  I know too much about what their mission is a part of.",1278720000,11,2396,4.357303370786517
4129893,5,B003JLL2XQ,"""8:The Mormon Proposition"" is a documentary which is an earnest and heartfelt effort to highlight the way the Utah-based Mormons or Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints played a crucial role in the passage of the proposition that doomed gay marriage in California. A Church elder says early on that the Church has three things needed to pass the measure: organization, money, and a message. They raised between twenty to thirty million dollars to push passage of the proposition. The movie shows how they had prevailed in a similar anti-gay measure years before in Hawaii.
The California proposition stated that ""only a marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in the state."" San Francisco's mayor, after passage, said California was the first state in the nation to take rights away from people by changing its constitution.
Obedience to Church teachings is central to the Mormon faith, a church with a history of homophobia, racial discrimination and the practice of polygamy. All of the elders or prophets shown were old white men in suits while the one female spokesperson for the Mormons in the film said that in heaven polygamy will be practiced.
The film shows a young gay couple, two men with Mormon family backgrounds who were ecstatic when they married in 2008, but who were distraught when the proposition passed in November of the same year. Just as they had in Hawaii, the Church formed a coalition front group to carry the ball, and they stayed in the background even though they raised the bulk of the money. Many Church members went door to door canvassing, and the men were told not to wear ties and white shirts so they wouldn't look like Church members.
Part of the film deals with the plight of gay Mormons who risk rejection by their families and the Church if they pursue their lifestyle. Utah's suicide rate is the highest in the nation. The film shows apparently gay teens who have been made homeless because their families turned them into pariahs.
On a technical level the film is not well-done; it has poor photography at times and suffers from poor editing. This is an emotionally charged one-sided view of the issue, but I think it should concern American citizens of all persuasions when a tax-exempt entity like the Utah-based Mormon Church can spend millions to press a homophobic agenda.",1277856000,10,2344,4.84788029925187
4129894,1,B003JLL2XQ,"This documentary deals with an important and timely topic, namely the deliberate and secretive intrusion of the Church of Later Day Saints into the civil struggle over marriage equality.  It also contains new and important information about how the Mormons attempted to disguise their activities, probably in violation of their tax status as a non-political religious entity.  This is vital material that deserves to be known to a broad audience.

Thus it is sad and unfortunate that the film is so utterly unengaging.  The director uses every cheesy trick possible:  scary music, distorted pictures of LDS church leaders, rag-tag children, and a celebrity narrator.  What it does NOT have is any real through story or fully developed characters.  There is no beginning middle and end, just a series of tirades.  And the entire second half of the film seems tacked on to stretch the length rather than to draw in the audience.

Its a testament to the importance of the topic that this film was shown at SUndance.  It's a pity it wasn't constructed in a compelling manner such as other documentaries on this topic; e.g. For the Bible Tells Me.  This COULD have been an important film.",1277769600,15,1183,4.924242424242424
4129895,4,B003JLL2XQ,"In no uncertain terms, ""8: The Mormon Proposition"" (2010) is a scathing indictment against the Mormon Church (LDS) for their sneaky, dishonest and (possibly) illegal funding and direction of the campaign that resulted in the passage of the 2008 California proposition that forbid same-gender marriage. As verbiage added to the state constitution, it not only prevents gay and lesbian couples from marrying in that state, and prevents CA and its cities from passing legislation to allow such ceremonies, but actually removed that right and annulled the marriages of many same-sex couples who had already been married before the proposition passed.

Narrated by Dustin Lance Black (Oscar-winning screenwriter for ""Milk""), it primarily follows one male couple, both of whom were brought up in the Mormon Church, who got married during early 2008, reconciled it as much as possible with their families, and expressed how important it was to them. At the time,,the Mormon Church had just successfully finished orchestrating (and financing) a similar proposition to crush the ""gay marriage"" movement in Hawaii, and essentially used that as a blueprint to take on California voters. The film reviews documents that spell out the Church's plan to be the ""silent"" force behind the campaign for Proposition 8, creating an alliance with the Catholic and other conservative Christian denominations, but making sure the publicity for the effort focuses on non-Mormon individuals with whom the public could relate. But it was clear that the Mormon Church was in charge, coming up with last minute financing (Projections showed the proposition was losing, as close as a month before the election) by essentially threatening their church members to give, or possibly face expulsion from the church. It worked.

After covering the aftermath of the legislation, the film goes off on several tangents about the Mormon Church's stand on homosexuality, including suicide by gay teen Mormons, their take on ""conversion therapy"", the backlash against a Utah congressman who was deeply involved in the campaign, ""No on Hate"" counter-protests, and a challenge to the church's tax exemption.  These seem a bit disjointed, and detract a bit from the overall impact of the movie, in my opinion.  That's the sole reason for the review giving it four stars, rather than the full five.

But that doesn't detract from the main focus of the film, which was done intelligently and fairly (In several places, the producers asked the Mormon Church to refute or clarify points they made, but they refused to comment dire ctly.)  The powerful indictment that it is, the only unfortunate thing is that it is likely to be seen only by those who already agree with the basic premise, rather than change any minds.",1276905600,16,2772,5.2040358744394615
4129896,1,B003JLL2XQ,"This movie is preaching to the choir. If you are a choir member you may find some catharsis.

If you are not, you will likely be unhappy with how one-sided and subjective this movie is.

The Mormon church does not get involved in most political issues. But the church sees gay marriage as a moral and religious issue. It affects one of their core beliefs, traditional marriage and family.

Mormons and the Mormon church are within their rights in a democracy to promote their viewpoint, just like any other group of citizens.

The fact that the Mormon church is against gay marriage has never been a secret. It's silly to portray the church as having some secret agenda.

Of course, Mormons didn't pass Prop 8 - the voters of California did. So if you want to be angry about it, be angry at the majority of CA voters. Others besides Mormons also supported it. And for the record, not all Mormons are against gay marriage; a minority of Mormons in CA say they did vote against Prop 8.

There is more than one way to view this issue. It's amazing how gays ask for tolerance (and should certainly get it) but don't appear very tolerant of those who disagree with their world view. Everyone has to agree with you - is that the American way?

It's funny to see gays cast this a civil rights issue. Ironic, because it was apparently all the blacks who came out to vote for Obama who turned the tide on Prop 8. They saw it on the ballot and voted for it. So civil rights? - I think black people would know what ""civil rights"" actually means.

It's unfortunate if individual members said things like they hope that AIDS kills all the gays. I don't agree with that statement. There is a difference between individuals and organizations. In the Prop 8 aftermath some gays were also quoted in the news as saying strongly-worded things that their national organizations backed away from.

I do not support gay marriage, although I'm in favor of civil unions to give equal legal rights to gay citizens, wherever they don't already have them. I'm for protection of gays and everyone else against hate crimes.

Legal civil unions, yes. But don't mess with marriage - that's a religious thing for me, and a sacred institution. It means a man and a woman committed to each other for life, and to their kids. The bedrock of society. For me, redefining marriage destroys it although I realize some people don't see it that way. For me, gay marriage is an oxymoron - a nonsensical concept.",1276905600,21,2469,4.553047404063205
4129897,5,B003JLL2XQ,"Just saw ""8: the Mormon Proposition."" It does have some flaws, which is a shame. Still, a great deal of the documentary is well-researched and very powerful. It of course brings back many personal memories, such as an elder in Priesthood meeting saying, ""I hope they don't find a cure for AIDS till all the gays are dead."" Mormons are ""good"" people, but I think if you hurt people in the name of God, you are taking the Lord's name in vain, and that, not the simple saying of ""oh, god,"" is what scripture condemns. This documentary shows quite clearly the duplicitous way in which the LDS Church carefully planned their attack on civil rights and is continuing that attack today.

4129911,5,B003JLL2XQ,"This documentary strikes directly at the core of the ""gay"" problem and the Mormon church.  It discusses true (un-white-washed) Mormon doctrine and how that doctrine is incompatible with homosexuality, thereby suggesting a cause for anti-gay behavior from the Mormon church.  It presents, in a very emotional manner, many witnesses and much evidence about the Mormon church's involvement with Prop 8.  Most of it is unfavorable toward the Mormon church.  Unfortunately, like so many other questionable aspects of Mormonism (including denying the priesthood to blacks, polygamy, and anti-feminism), the highest levels of the Church (especially their president/prophet) are unwilling to ""set the record straight"" or even answer questions or have a real dialog about marriage equality.  I have personal experience with the topics of this documentary and validate that the culture, attitudes, teachings, and behaviors portrayed in this documentary are quite accurately portrayed.

The documentary is powerfully emotional and well produced.  The people interviewed seem to speak from the heart.

The first half of the documentary focuses on Prop 8.  The second half speaks more to the treatment of gays by the Mormon church.",1404604800,,1218,5.612021857923497

4129913,1,B003JLL2XQ,"As an active Latter-day Saint, I don't know why men and women are homosexual just as I don't know why some people are pedophiles or have sex with animals. Clearly the anatomy of men and women is such that the church (including the ancient church) is and was that homosexuality is a perversion. I knew an emergency room doctor who told me that while on duty at a metropolitan hospital, he had removed virtually anything that would fit from men's anuses -- things that had been shoved so far up that they needed emergency medical attention to remove them. And this included, at times, dead animals. I can't judge such people, nor do I deny that some people find meaningful and loving relationships; however, I have to accept the fact that ultimately God must be the arbiter of right and wrong, and that he brings judgments on societies that accept, condone and revel in such practices. Some will be angry because of this, but the problem with such presentations as THE MORMON PROPOSITION is that they seek to paint the Church as base and corrupt and that it's doctrine is predicated on old and outdated misconceptions based in hate. And while many of our leaders are old enough to retain some prejudices that are admittedly unkind, I believe the Lord deeply loves homosexuals but maintains that righteous societies cannot condone it.

So the problem with this production is that it is just as biased as it accuses Mormons of being. And it doesn't reflect the church or people that I know. If the LDS church is corrupt and outdated, it ultimately will not stand. Society will eventually settle the issue and the United States will move on in prosperity and justice. But if the church reflects the will and outlooks of God, then America cannot condone it without incurring His wrath. Only time will tell.",1399507200,4,1800,4.714285714285714

4129916,4,B003JLL2XQ,"I was raised Mormon, though I am no longer active in the church. Growing up in the SLC valley, almost everyone we knew were members of the church. Although we were ""encouraged"" to befriend and date only within the church, I never understood the control the church had on me. When I moved away from Utah and met people of all races and religions I realized the control the church had, as well as it's ability to teach intolerance as a church directive as though it were handed down from god. This film shows how he LDS / Mormon church can control thing from behind the scenes. One can argue the the Catholic Church has done some of the same, but the Catholic Church has generally been forthright with thier intentions and directives to thier worldwide members. I was sickened to hear of the church's involvement here, as I am a strong believer of the separation of church and state. Thank goodness that as of today,  several states now recognize same sex marriage,  but this film is still relevant because it shows the control that can be taken over a few people who control a lot of money.  My heart goes out to the young people in this film who found themselves left out in the cold because of a long standing fear. And if you have never been a member of a church/cult like this, you cannot understand the extreme prejudice under which they live. Yet how difficult it would be to survive outside of the church with no supportystem at all. For instance I was recently informed that I have a cousin who lived with his boyfriend for many years, staying with him through the last moments of his life. Now the the boyfriend is gone, ny cousin has "" seen the light"" and has returned to the church, and is now almost pure enough to go to the temple.

The gay community didn't show up until a day or so after the election for a big protest, as shown in the film.  Even afterward, unless you are both gay/lesbian and (or were formerly) Mormon, people still might not really get it without information such as is provided in The Mormon Proposition.  I think we will indeed look back at Prop 8 as the beast that awoke the sleeping giant of the gay community and it will be seen as a major turning point in the fight for marriage equality.

Even as a gay, former Mormon, the film reminded me of some of the important aspects of the Mormon's involvement in gay issues that I don't often think about.

No Prophet or Priest was in the voting booth with the 54 percent when they made their choice.  Yes, churches vigorously promoted their agenda, as did all groups with a vested interest in this issue.  The premise that one must believe 54 percent of the voters of California are too weak or simple-minded to resist the Rasputin-like powers of the LDS marketing campaign is insulting.

4129926,3,B003JLL2XQ,"The focus of this DVD is how the Mormon Church supported California's Proposition 8 in the November 2008 elections. The measure added a provision to the California Constitution the provided that 'only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.' Previously the same verbiage had been passed in 2000 as an ordinary statue, but invalidated by the State Supreme Court earlier that year.

Campaigns for and against Proposition 8 raised $39 and $44 million, respectively - the year's highest funded campaigns on any state ballot. About 29.1% of the monies raised in support came from outside the state, and 30% of the money against. THE LDS church was fined $5,538 for failing to follow campaign disclosure requirements.

Prior LDS polling and experience campaigning for a similar measure in Hawaii had led them to a strategy of keeping out of the news, instead forming a coalition with the Catholic Church, as well as a group of Evangelical Christians, Rick Warren, and the National Organization for Marriage.

Mormons were pressured to donate money and/or in-kind in support - with the implicit threat of expulsion if they did not. Some 25,000 volunteers turned out each Saturday to go door to door - coached to not look like Mormons.

After the proposition passed, opponents then raised the issue that the Mormon Church was violating the separation of church and state, as well as its tax-exempt status requirement to not lobby.

Another dimension portrayed in the DVD was Utah's high youth suicide rate - presumably the result of the tension between being gay and church denunciation of such. Many gay teens are reportedly kicked out of their homes.

Negative examples of the LDS church's hard-line vs. homosexuality were shown throughout the DVD. However, to be fair the same could undoubtedly be said about a number of Evangelical churches as well. On the other hand, I was also taken aback by the numerous lies told by those supporting the proposition.",1356912000,,1983,5.0121580547112465

Prop 8 is a gay issue....but it could be ANY issue that the LDS leaders see as a problem, and they will go after it, probably the same way they did in this film, which was so covertly.

4129938,5,B003JLL2XQ,"Utah has the highest teen suicide rate. But why? Isn't it forbidden by the bible? Well, no; Samson's suicide is generally held up as a laudable event. The bible even clearly states that god granted him superhuman strength during his final moments. Therefore, god approves of suicide (at least if you take out several thousand of his enemies simultaneously). By extension, the bible gives Christians no reasons to oppose suicide bombing.

The tragedy behind Utah's youth suicide rate is quite simple once you learn that the majority of the state is Mormon. It is also profoundly and undeniably tragic. Under Mormon teachings, being gay is second only to murder under their collection of ""sins."" The threat of hell is certainly no match for the oppression, ""reparative"" therapies and condemnation from pulpits and parents alike. And yet the Mormon hierarchies aren't satisfied with tormenting those who were unfortunate enough to live in their state. They funded and supplied countless volunteers to pass Proposition 8 back in 2008. Needless to say, the pool of Mormon sheep blackmailed with excommunication amounted to tens of thousands of flyer-distributors, yellers and election-day ""advisors."" As anyone well-versed in political science is well aware, dedicated (or in this case, at least partially-coerced) volunteers can run circles around a smaller but more well-funded opposition.

Families sacrificed their childrens' college funds, retirement funds, and whatever else was demanded of them by comfortable, affluent and above all lazy clergy. And for what? For holding back social justice, compassion and understanding for a few years until the Judge Walker of California's district court declared it unconstitutional. Are the families going to receive aid from their conservative leaders who fleeced them of so much money? I highly doubt it. Utah will be profoundly dependent on the government teat (i.e. welfare) for the near future. So much for right-wing conservatism and personal responsibility. This was religious blackmail at its most pernicious.

Or consider this - convicted mass murderers on death row and sex offenders can marry the person of their choice, but gays and lesbians cannot. That likens them to slaves in the Antebellum South, who were not allowed to marry. Like the emancipated African Americans before them, members of the LGBT community gathered in throngs to get married. To equate them to slaves and imply that they are worse than murderers is both profoundly callous and bigoted. Such discriminatory laws have no place in secular societies.

By sticking its unwanted neck into the public sphere, the Mormon community unequivocably and unforgivably violated the first amendment of the US Constitution. There can be no freedom of religion without freedom FROM religion. The Mormons would no doubt throw childish hissy fits if their tax-exempt status was revoked and they were held accountable for their pernicious actions in shoving their baseless religious beliefs on the rest of California. Yet that would only be fair. There should be no governmental representation without taxation. This guiding axiom of democracy must work both ways for healthy societies to function and thrive.

I am ecstatic that NOM is now under investigation for violating the US tax code. Justice for them, and the rest of society, is past its due date, but better late than never. Hiding financial figures and the names of one's donors is a clear sign of guilt (or at the least, a profound fear of embarrassment). As the recent 2012 referenda showed, it is only a matter of time before social justice spreads across the developed world. Religion cannot stop it, and their efforts to try only make things worse for us all (how many foster children could have been helped by the money thrown down the toilet on Proposition 8?).

I would highly recommend Marriage On Trial's re-enactment of the Prop 8 Trial to see just how flimsy and unsupported the case against marriage equality is.

And the legislation they wanted stopped and was in there eyes just evil was Gay Marriage.

And in there words they said such an act of 'just love' is evil!

So in 'Land Of The Free' the Mormans stopped a group of people acting out of love from doing something they wished to express.

This film is not only an indictment of the Mormon Church's involvement in the fight against gay rights, but a testament to love thru the story of a Mormon gay couple (one of whom is a descendant of one of their prophets) and the mother who has to reconcile her faith with the love of her son.  The film discusses the basis for the church's arguments and illuminates the long history of hate found in the Mormon scriptures (their thoughts about blacks as being that color because of ""sin"" and their idea that skin color can lighten should the person turn to God).

After illuminating the suspect theology, the film details the involvement of the Mormon church in the California struggle.  How did a faith whose members comprise 2% of the California electorate end up becoming the MAJOR contributor to the Prop 8 battle?  It is a perfect argument for the application of election laws to institutions of faith and for the review of the tax-exempt status of the Mormons.

Some of the reasons for leaving were: my own failed attempts at changing my orientation with church sponsored ""change"" therapy groups, my own suicide attempt, seeing first hand under-age friends that were kicked out of their homes for being gay, friends that were removed from Temple Square for simply holding hands and the list goes on and on.  It wasn't until seeing the outrageous involvement that the Church had with Proposition 8 that I decided to formally request that my membership as a Mormon be nullified.  At the time of my resignation of membership, I didn't know so many of the things that this documentary shed light on.

4129962,4,B003JLL2XQ,"8: The Mormon Proposition, documents the troubling positioning of religious values into state politics (same-sex marriage in both Hawaii and California, but particularly Proposition 8 in California).  Now, I don't label this ""troubling"" because a group of people, in any religion, want their position known to their members and the world.  I call this troubling because the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS, often called Mormons), worked very, very hard to shape laws to match their particular skewed vision of reality.  More below.

I attended a screening of this documentary that was followed by a question and answer session from producer and director Reed Cowen.  It was also following the infamous 2010 declaration of intolerance toward same-sex marriage by Boyd K. Packer, president of the LDS church's Quorum of Twelve Apostles.  He stated, ""There are those today who not only tolerate but advocate voting to change laws that would legalize immorality, as if a vote would somehow alter the designs of God's laws and nature.  A law against nature would be impossible to enforce. Do you think a vote to repeal the law of gravity would do any good?""

Reed Cowen stated that he needed to document the LDS involvement in the political process, and to document their intolerance and interference before documents disappear and the official spin doctors hide the facts.  The result of Proposition 8 was the addition of this wording to the California constitution:

""Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.""

That was a bit of a slap in the face to those of the same sex who had been married previously.  That was contrary to the belief of a number of other religious traditions.  And the passage of this proposition, Cowen argues, was in large part the result of falsehoods and propaganda developed, financed, and spread by LDS authorities and members.

For Reed Cowen, a former Morman who served his church mission but decided he couldn't be anything other than what he was, a gay man, the church involvement in keeping him and his partner from having the same rights to a legal commitment as any heterosexual couple was immoral.  In addition, Cowen, claimed, the LDS church and its members were culpable for the despair, pain, and violence directed toward people with a same-sex attraction.

Here's what this film does.  It gives the viewer a good overview of the LDS position toward gay marriage and their involvement in Proposition 8.  It does make the leadership look sinister as the film broadcasts messages from leaders to members.  Is it fair?  Is it balanced?  Like most documentaries, it was not designed to be fair.  It was designed to make a strong case... the ""grand jury"" model, outlining whether there is enough evidence for something done wrong.

4129963,5,B003JLL2XQ,"The question of the civil rights of glbtq persons to marry under state and US Constitutions has been, and is still, a hot button issue for many people. Whether you agree or disagree with that idea, one should be alarmed that any religious group should have the right to impose their views on persons not of their faith community.

""8: the Mormon Proposition"" looks at how The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints raised monies to influence voters in California in opposition to a ruling by the California State Supreme Court that held that civil marriage was the right of everyone...glbtq or straight. Of course the Mormon church wasn't the only religious group opposing marriage equality...the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic Fraternal organization, contributed over $1,000,000 toward that effort too, but the Mormon church contributed the majority of the funds to overturn the ruling, and became the poster child for intolerance and inequality. This is interesting, and somewhat mindblowing, considering the intolerance that Mormons have had to contend with over the past almost 200 years of their institutional existence.

4129966,4,B003JLL2XQ,"Hey, did you hear the good news? Jesus Christ did in fact return to life and was here in these very United States! Also, this guy, Joseph Smith said he found some tablets in the forest or something like that, but nobody ever actually saw them other than Mr. Smith, and now he can have as many wives as he wants!

Oh, you didn't hear this? Well, then you're either a logical human being or, more likely, simply not a member of the Mormon church.

So God said that one guy making out with another guy is wrong, so it HAS to be an absolute truth, right? Well, in that case once my daughter hits a certain age I'll be sure to pimp her out, that is if she doesn't mouth off to me and I stone her to death, two things that are promoted in the Bible as God's word; and lets not forget that wonderful concept of man's domination of all on earth leading to such marvelous things as species extinction and global warming  (but that's just made up, right? Sort of like an all powerful being; IRONY ALERT.) In case you couldn't get the hint, I am an Atheist, have been for about 10 years now. It wasn't particularly hard work to realize that there is, was nor will there ever be a god in any sense. Sure, some of the mythology from some religions are interesting from a purely story telling aspect, loves me some Norse mythology, but to read a book and take every word written as factual truth is just beyond ridiculous and, obviously, dangerous to the rights of human beings.

Watching the documentary, and seeing the Morons, I'm sorry, Mormons go from door to door surveying people one can't help but recall the treacherous and manipulative methods of the Ku Klux Klan in the early 1900s; they would go from door to door and ask people vague questions; do you love your country? do you love god? do you love your children? etc, etc. Well if you do, SIGN THIS AND JOIN OUR CLUB! and, unfortunately, a ton of people fell for this scheme. It's all about misinformation and fear, really; control the fearful and you have power absolute. Tell them that their children are in grave danger if a man is allowed to marry a man and, unfortunately, 8 times out of 10 they'll vote for whatever you're pushing. This idea that if homosexual couples are allowed to marry will bring about the demise of the United States and all it stands for, you know...the whole every man born equal thing, is so unbelievably absurd that it's making Camus role over in his grave.

I'm not a Stalinist Atheist. I don't feel that if you eliminate religion from the world it would make it a better place (I don't have enough faith in the human condition to be so naive.), you can believe whatever you want, you can preach whatever you feel to be your seriously hilarious truth (like not allowing blacks into your religion until 1978) but once you take your beliefs and use them to manipulate the public into voting for something that is in your best interest then you're a problem through and through. Really, though, it's, again, all a matter of controlling the fearful. I believe in an afterlife because I'm scared to death of...well, death; what happens after we die? Oh, nothing? Total darkness and no more? Well, that's too bleak, so I'll just believe that when I die I'll get all the tang I could ever want; hell, I'll even become a GOD after I die, but in order to get to this point that somebody made up 100 or so years ago I have to be a slave to a group of megalomaniacs.

Seriously?

The documentary didn't tell me anything I didn't already know from reading noted science fiction author Orson Scott Card's appalling essay railing against homosexual rights; the fact that these people think that sexuality is a choice that can be reversed just goes to show how intensely they're living in their own little worlds, if this is the case, if something born into a human being is actually a choice....well, in that case you better start rounding up the blind, the deaf, the autistic and, gosh golly, why not the horizontally impaired? Yes, the Mormon church, proponents of eugenics: fantastic.

In 2004 Australia's conservative dominated federal government, sadly with the full support of the ""liberal"" opposing party, marched hand in the shadow of George W Bush by amending the Marriage Act to specifically exclude same sex couples (marriage is not a state matter here).

Six years later, with a change of governing party, there's at least a possibility of enacting marriage equality, but some activists are being complicit in their own persecution by suggesting they might accept civil unions, rather than fight for marriage equality. I challenge them, and any rational person, to watch this film and yet fail to realise that marriage equality is a necessity as an option for all - not a pipe dream, nor a nicety.

While the law defines that we deserve discrimination, the Churches who hate us will continue to feel vindicated in active oppression, and too many youth will be rejected, or feel rejected, will self-harm or suicide, as a direct result.

Who denies the criminal equality with freemen when laws are broken?  Is it the freemen who erected laws or the criminal who refuses to obey them?  Marriage is a privilege for those who keep God's laws.  Not even Mormons can marry in the temple unless they keep God's laws. Equality is not license, it is responsibility.

Marriage is a religious institution protected by law.  The secular equivalent is Civil Union.  Were government to appropriate wholesale the religious institution of marriage, to dictate to religious organizations who they will and/or cannot marry, then the First Amendment securing the freedom of religion would be abridged.

The Wall separating Church and State is impregnable in only one direction.  Freedom of Religion means not having one's tax exempt status threatened for teaching morality or even funding moral movements.  The Church has as much right as any other organization to fund the movements it supports.  We do not buy this right by paying taxes else it would be no right at all.

The lavender revolution's real beef is not with the LDS church for informing the public of a threat to the religious institution of marriage, but with democracy.

I can honestly say that it was a moment of insanity because of what could have happened.  I have always been a strong minded person, confident and sure of myself. The mormon's way of brainwashing and threatening really didn't and could not have worked on me.  Honestly the Bishop and First Council were pretty cool about it.  They took me into the office and sat me down and told me that they know and understand my struggles and that one in every 10 men is gay.  They told me that if I wanted the Churche's help, that I could remain a member as long as I vowed celibacy and attended regular meetings with a mormon psychiatrist.  I declined. There is nothing wrong with me, I just don't find women attractive and I never have.  As a member of the Church I lied about my attractions simply because I wanted to fit in.  What most people don't know about being Mormon, is that within the Church is a world in and of itself. There is a support group and friends and leaving that and walking into an empty world where there is no connection to anyone is very terrifying.  The only reason i survived is because my life was not exclusively Mormon. I had secular friends and my family consisted of non-believers, baptists, and born again non-denominational christians. My leaving the Church was met with applause.  Unfortunately there are alot of young men and women who leave the church and walk into a big world where they don't know anyone and they don't have any support.  This documentary really hit home for me. Never has anything made me so sick in my life. I never knew that Gordon B Hinckley said those terrible things about Gay People, had I heard that as a member I would have definately lost it.  This documentary was moving and emotional, it almost made me cry. More than anything it terrified me.  Religion is far to personal, and far to unstable to have so much power.  If we all are not careful it is only a matter of time before the churches unite, Catholic, Evagelical, Mormon etc etc and plot a global take over that we will regret.  This may sound like science fiction, but as a member of the LDS Church, I saw first hand how secrets found their way into the laps of Bishops and the Higher-Ups of the Church.  This is not GOD, this is plain and simple human, military strategy.  The fact that my community was under attack by the Religious Right, is not what made me sick while watching this documentary, the issue of what was going on is what made me sick.  Thousands, millions, of people rallied together to TAKE AWAY CIVIL RIGHTS. It is terrifying that a Church, a house of God can gather an army under hate.  It could just as easily have been a rival of Jim Crow supporters.  What I found funny is how in the mormon church, black people are pretty-much non-entities, however when wanting to slam the gays, the church used more photos of black people and children and families than i have every seen in all my years as a member.

THE OTHER THUGS (UNKNOWN-RELIGIOUS-TYPE GAY HATERS), THAT THE MOVIE BRINGS OUT-OF-THE-CLOSET, ARE VICIOUS, FILLED WITH HATE AND HAVE NO LOVE IN THEIR HEARTS.  THEY ARE WORKERS OF EVIL AND THE VERY SLIME ON THE GROUND THAT GOOD AND REAL AMERICANS WALK ON.  THEY, ALONG WITH THE SADISTIC HATEFUL AND CORRUPT MORMON CULT, HAVE DESTROYED THE VERY FOUNDATION THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON, ""FREEDOM AND CIVIL RIGHTS"" !!!!

THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AS A THREAT AND A WARNING TO ALL OF US WHO DO NOT SHARE THE MORMON BARBARIC DOCTRINE !!!  THE MORMON CHURCH, (ALONG WITH OTHER RELIGIOUS WOMBATS) MUST BE STOPPED AT  A N Y  C O S T, BEFORE THEY ENGULF US ALL WITH THEIR FASCIST MEGA-MONEY, HIDDEN BEHIND COUNTERFEIT CHURCH WALLS AND CLAIMING TO HAVE JESUS CHRIST AS THE LEADER.

THIS MOVIE DESERVES A RATING BETTER THAN 5 STARS AND I SUGGEST THIS MOVIE BE MANDINTORY FOR EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD OVER 16 YEARS OLD....MAYBE EVEN YOUNGER (WITH A LITTLE EDITING OF CHOICE WORDS).  THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS AND ONCE THE CHURCH AND STATE MIX, THERE WILL BE WORLD WAR III, CAUSING ALL OF MANKIND TO VANISH WITHOUT A TRACE.

PREJUDICE, HATRED AND BIGOTRY,  HERE TODAY AND THERE TOMORROW,  CAN ONLY END UP IN DISASTER !!!  EVERYONE SHOULD WAKE-UP AND SMELL THE CORDITE BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE !!!

4129986,5,B003JLL2XQ,A very important and informative documentary on cruelty and interference in our democracy by the Mormon church.  Brought to light a lot of issues and events I was not aware of.  Well made and riveting.,1279238400,7,201,4.714285714285714
4129987,5,B003JLL2XQ,"No, the movie's not perfect, and (partially for reasons described in another review) provides only one side of the story.  But there is enough information here that most people will be appalled and shocked by the facts that are presented.  I urge everyone, regardless of your position on same sex marriage to watch this movie.

There are a few Mormons in my family, and we have discussed their/my views about gay marriage and the Mormon opposition to marriage between same sex couples.  I understand their reasoning, and honor their right to their beliefs.

It turns out that I may understand what a typical Mormon believes about gay marriage, but not what the church believes or is willing to do to promote those beliefs.

If you think the Mormon church would be more tolerant of diversity than many other churches or religions because of the persecution they suffered for polygamy, you'll find out you're wrong.  The movie provides numerous examples of decades of bigotry and hypocracy, directed primarily at gays, but also at blacks.

One of the church's platforms in opposition to Measure 8 was that children would be taught tolerance of homosexuality in schools.  Later in the movie we see a Mormon prophet telling LDS youth that they would be better off dead than homosexual.  Then we learn that Utah has the highest suicide rate of teens in the US.

Watch the movie.  You may get mad, and you'll probably get sad when seeing interviews of gay LDS youth, but you'll also get information you didn't have before, and probably couldn't find in any other single place.",1279238400,8,1570,4.8389513108614235

8398218,5,B003JLL2XQ,As a Mormon I am sickened by the actions of the church in California and Utah.  More people need to know what the church has done to gay youth and just how unchrist-like their secretive methods have been.  DISCUSTED,1482364800,,215,4.487179487179487
8398219,5,B003JLL2XQ,"A great movie about how a church manipulated public policy. If you're a Californian who lived through the 2008 same-sex marriage ballot initiative battle, Prop 8, it's fascinating. If you're not, it's a very good look inside how religion is attempting to manipulate public policy by scapegoating minorities they dislike.",1461542400,,320,5.42

8398221,5,B003JLL2XQ,Love this video!  It's a real inside look at what most don't know or don't want to know about the Mormon Church.  I was a good Mormon for 27 years and very much a part of the prop 22 calling list. These things are still happening now.  More people need to be informed! God bless.,1450396800,,279,4.036363636363636

8398223,5,B003JLL2XQ,"Very well done film exposing the truly harmful work of the Mormon church in funding the discrimination of prop 8.  I don't understand how good people can have such a blind spot when it comes to the church promoting hatred.  I would think even if your church were telling you to hurt innocent men and women and their families by campaigning with a message of hate, some part of your mind and humanity would realize that the hateful message is just morally wrong.

On the bright side, marriage equality is now the law of the land, so all that money and effort (that could have gone to something positive rather than negative) was at least a failure in the end.  Hopefully, the church can learn to stand on the side of good for everyone rather than preaching a continued agenda of hate because there are good people in the church that deserve better.",1439078400,,847,4.516339869281046

Thankfully, the courts have and continue working to overturn many of these BS voter approved bans on same sex marriage all across the country...",1409097600,,390,5.078125

How they can remain a tax-free ""church"" when they are so involved in making laws is mind boggling. But I guess SCOTS thinks that ""corporations are people too.  Idiots!
