5159055,5,B008FYZHP6,"Rancho Deluxe like Thunderball and Light Foot is a classic ""going no where"" yarn 70's film with Jeff Bridges at his best. It's the reason he took up residency in Montana well before the hedge fund other out of state big Montana Ranch wannabees started to move in to Paradise Valley ruining the real dream of the simple life with simple beauty that the film portrays.",1364428800,2,366,4.5606060606060606

8527468,4,B008FYZHP6,"As Rancho Deluxe is not quite my cup of tea this review is of the unknown.yet outstanding western film ""Wild Bill.""  Jeff Bridges performance and interpretation of the main character is so filled with energy, so riveting throughout, as to be simply amazing.  There are still a few of his movies I do not have, but I will say yet again that Mr. Bridges gives an Academy award level performance just about every time he makes a movie. He has to be the most underrated/overlooked actor of our time.  If you are a western fan you will enjoy this one..",1428796800,2,547,4.45

8527471,5,B008FYZHP6,"Great movies!!! Mr. Bridges plays a GREAT Wild Bill Hickok. Rancho Deluxe was a pleasant surprise - a very quirky 70's story about rustlers in Montana.

8527473,3,B008FYZHP6,"An odd half-comedy half-western about contemporary cattle-rustlers with a startlingly young Jeff Bridges and Sam Waterston, indifferent direction by Frank Perry, and an overall dissatisfying feel. Despite some good laughs, it never quite delivers the goods, and doesn't add up to as much as it might have. Script by Tom McGuane, including a personal appearance by Jimmy Buffet.",1408233600,,377,5.517241379310345
