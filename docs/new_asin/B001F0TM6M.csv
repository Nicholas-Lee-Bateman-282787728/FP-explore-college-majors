I had all of these recorded. So, I cleaned off some hard drive space, also thinking (not wrongly) that it intimated the complete series. WRONG!!! No Growing Up Elephant, one that I deleted. No Growing up Panda, another deletion. No Growing up Marsupial. At least I saved that. Now, the ones I deleted aren't scheduled to be shown in the near future. I could have spent thirty bucks on almost anything else and been happier.",1238803200,8,586,4.537735849056604
8300330,5,B001F0TM6M,we were very pleased as usual from amazon. thank you!,1463270400,,53,4.4
8300331,5,B001F0TM6M,"I had been looking for these for a while, and couldn't find the ones I was looking for. The Primates video is impossible to find, so I was so glad to finally find it in a set! I fell in love with this series as a kid, so I'm glad I could find it again!",1375920000,,252,3.6
8300332,5,B001F0TM6M,"I bought this for my wife just so she could see the Moose.  It started with her forcing me to sit and watch these, but ended with me wanted to keep going.  Great for any age animal lover.",1352246400,,187,3.8947368421052633
8300333,5,B001F0TM6M,"I bought this set mainly because of the black leopard episode and have been pleasantly surprised at the quality of the entire set.  The black leopard episode is still my favorite.  It had Edie Falco as a guest.  You may remember her from the tv series ""The Sopranos"".

It is well worth the price I paid.  When I made my purchase, it was a much better deal to buy the complete set than it would have been to buy individual DVDs from the series.  Check out individual titles and I bet you will find this to still be true.  I have had mine for a while and have watch some of them multiple times.  I have really enjoyed it.  I recommend it for animal lovers and conservationists.",1345161600,,675,4.251968503937008
8300334,4,B001F0TM6M,"Wonderful educational and fun videos for children that allows them to learn about caring for wild baby animals.  A few have a birth scene in it, which may be uncomfortable or confusing for some children so be prepared for possible questions. Our children really enjoy this series and watch them frequently on long trips.",1323993600,,320,4.925925925925926
8300335,5,B001F0TM6M,"Best videos grandparents,or parents could ever have. Our kids are 3 to 5 yrs. old. They have favorites of cartoons and always seem to choose the animals first. Very educational for the kids.......even if you are 50 yrs. old. In other words everbody gets pleasure from watching.",1297468800,,277,4.914893617021277
8300336,5,B001F0TM6M,"We never saw the series on Animal Planet.  We ended up finding this because my daugther (2 yo) loves Giraffes, and we were watching youtube videos of giraffes, so we looked this up from the ones we watched there.  The episodes are very nice.  I just wish we could get some other animals that seem to have been made (pando, elephant), that aren't on this set.",1292198400,,358,4.393939393939394
8300337,5,B001F0TM6M,"I got these dvds around 2 weeks ago and my 3 year old toddler have been watching them a lot! They are really nice and kid friendly. I would say these are good for ages 3 and up because they are documentary type but don't let that fool you to think they are boring! I find myself glued to the TV every time we see a new episode! This gift pack is good if you don't have the others individual dvds. The dvds that are included are Growing up Primates, Growing up Wilderness, Growing up Cats, Growing up Safari and Growing up Artic. I just wish they would put the other ones they have on VHS on DVD format.",1266883200,,602,4.067226890756302
8300338,5,B001F0TM6M,I absolutely love the growing up series. I got it at an excellent price and can enjoy it anytime I want now. It arrived timely and in great condition.,1260662400,,150,4.206896551724138
8300339,5,B001F0TM6M,"This is my very favourite series televised on Animal Planet.  Like the other poster here, I already own all the individual DVD's.  I however, took the time to READ the description of what was included - therefore NOT making the same foolish mistake.

For those of you who love animals and do not own any of the individual DVD's, I highly recommend that you purchase this set.  It is wonderful! The price is great - buy a few sets for any animal lover's birthday or Christmas presents...  They'll love it too!",1239062400,3,508,4.538461538461538
