8259759,5,B0015S4BCE,"the greatest movie version of O'Neill's masterpiece. The performances set a standard of individual and ensemble acting under the superb direction of Sidney Lumet. The cinematography captures the mood of O'Neill's searing autobiographical play,
Katherine Hepburn plays the focal role with tremendous insight and skill.  One of the greatest portrayals of American cinema.  Richardson is the perfect foil for her performance as the beleaguered husband and father--absolutely memorable.  The two sons are played to perfection by Robards and  Stockwell. .  Each actor has captured the essence of their roles tied together in an artistic unity that makes other versions of this play pale in comparison.",1470787200,,696,5.59047619047619
8259760,5,B0015S4BCE,I'm looking everywhere for a DVD copy of this or the 1995 PBS version ! Anyone have ideas?,1450051200,,90,4.055555555555555
8259761,5,B0015S4BCE,"I'm not at all saying this because I'm originally Canadian, but this is by FAR the best video recording of the great stage drama (depressing for some), written by Eugene O'Neill. Sadly it's very rare and copies only occasionally can be found on Amazon and are often very expensive. I managed to find one for just 10 bucks when it first came out.. William Hutt, Canadian icon of the Stratford Shakespearean Festival, gives a superior performance as the family patriarch James Tyrone.",1448496000,,482,4.890243902439025
8259762,5,B0015S4BCE,"I saw this version of Long Day's Journey into Night several years ago on PBS Great Performances. I tuned in because I had misread the credits in the TV listing. I thought the star was William Hurt, and I wanted to see his interpretation of James Tyrone (even though he would have been too young to play him at the time). My initial disappointment vanished as I began to see how good William Hutt and the other cast members were. I now have four different version of this, my favorite play -- Katherine Hepburn and Ralph Richardson, Jack Lemon, Laurence Olivier, and this one. This is by far the best. All five performances (even the maid) are magnificent. The setting and direction are flawless. Director David Wellington resists a needless 'opening up' of the play onto the veranda, the lawn, or the garage. He maintains a close-up focus on the actors, so that every fleeting emotion is seen and felt. It's the drama of the characters revealing their innermost thoughts and fears to each other that grabs you.

I've watched my tape of the PBS presentation many times, and am thrilled to have found this gem on DVD. Anyone who enjoys great theater and great acting is in for a treat with this Canadian production from the Stratford Festival. A 10 out of 10.",1303430400,4,1257,4.611607142857143
