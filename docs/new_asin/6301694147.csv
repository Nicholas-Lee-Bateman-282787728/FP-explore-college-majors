349988,5,6301694147,"Tosca is not one of my favorite operas, but this dvd is definitely my favorite opera-made-movie.  Kabaivanska's Tosca is dramatic, and Domingo and Milnes are spectacular as usual.  But what makes this dvd shine above a host of other dvd's with equally stellar casts is the setting and direction.  The scenery is constantly beautiful--you're in a church, a palace, a castle--and the director makes great decisions in how he places and films his actors within them.  You see faces when you want faces; group shots when you want group shots; scenery when you want scenery.  This dvd has two highlights for me, both in act I (but the other acts are done well too).  The first is 'recondita armonia'.  The director captures visually the spirit of the aria--the duality of a single beauty reflected in these two, so different women--without distractinig you with *too* many changes on the screen.  And of course Domingo's clear voice is just perfect for the aria.  The second highlight for me is Scarpia's aria at the end of act I.  Milnes is terrifying in voice and visage, and the director accentuates this by filming him walking through the church as he sings during mass.  It's an effect you couldn't close to achieve on stage, and it's perfect.  As he paces along, rooms, church, people and camera swirl around, and all you see is Scarpia, Scarpia, Scarpia, making his mark on the world.  Brilliant!",1124150400,39,1398,4.823529411764706

kabaivanska - sometimes sings some less than pleasurable notes, but they are very few and far between, she sings this well despite, she is also a decent actress.

349991,5,6301694147,"Many, many years ago I saw this film on TV and I have been looking for the DVD for years. Today I finally bought it (yes already released in Europe). The DVD quality is not good. It is slightly better than Butterfly (with Freni and Domingo see my other review), but it is a shame that Deutsche Grammophone did not feel the obligation to the public to remaster the film for DVD. With prices as much as three times the price an average movies costs, one would expect a better treatment of the material (and the customer). The sound is very good though. The singing of all the principal singers is glorious, glorious...... Kabaivanska is really beautiful to look at, Domingo is in excellent voice and I always wonder how such a beautiful voice can convey so much evil as Milnes does in his role here (same with his Iago in Otello). One of the most beautifully sung Toscas.",1117929600,10,869,4.471698113207547
349992,5,6301694147,"This production will seize you and not let you go; it is so powerful.  The inate dramatic intensity that is ""Tosca"" is successfully transferred into this actual full-fledged film.  I think this is achieved in part through its filming at the actual sites in Rome where the story takes place, using costumes and props as the people would actually have had in Rome around 1800.  There is little, if any, fledgling experimental interpretation here.  Everything has been carefully crafted, as if the audience member watching the production were thrown into exactly how Puccini would have imagined it, if one could make such a claim.
  Placido Domingo's performance is as to be expected.  We find him here at the very height of his career, full of youthful splendor: a seemingly effortless, yet brilliant delivery.  Kabaivanska commands a quite compelling role of Tosca, as well.  Although I've watched this production a countless number of times, I still say ""wow"" every time she finishes the very much underrated withing operatic criticism, in my opinion, aria ""Vissi d'arte"" in the second act.  Stronger performances of Tosca's vocal part can be heard on other recordings, though.  Try anything with Kiri Tekanawa, for instance, who sings with much more of the dark resonance that is Tosca.  However, the real catcher is that of Scarpia with Milnes performing.  Scarpia actually is a very demanding role, especially for a baritone, a fact not really widely accepted.  But Milnes really shines in his role and, I think, makes the most striking impression of the three leads.
  Flaws with this production include the relatively poor video quality.  Yes, it's true that there are constant white spots that show up on the screen throughout the piece.  The final scene also can be a little disappointing.  The soldiers do not march in step, although they try to, and this clutter can distract from the ultimate emotional climax that Puccini achieves here.  The orchestra also does not play together in the final echo of the flagship theme of the opera, which makes the whole opera come to an unsteady close.  These are nevertheless details, and probably wouldn't be noticed the during the first few viewings.
  All in all, I would definitely recommend buying this production because overall it very much achieves the quintessential dramatic splendor of Tosca and is thus worth owning your own copy to view over and over again.",1041379200,17,2418,5.0201005025125625
349993,5,6301694147,"Needless to say that the star is Raina Kabaivanska, a beautiful, graceful Tosca, whose soprano is very expressive - a voice that can be glorious and tender as well. She sings high pianissimo beautifully and her trills are brilliant in ""Vissi d'arte"". In contrast to other's acting, her acting is full of details and subtleties, dramatizing a proud, fiery, and willing-to-die-for-love Tosca wonderfully. Domingo's approach to Cavaradossi is heroic, poetic, and quite attentive. His voice is silvery; he looks virile, although a bit too wide his girth for a young Cavaradossi. ""Recondita armonia"" is sung with passion and graceful turns. In ""E lucevan le stelle"" he conveys the farewell to life with deep emotions and climaxes the aria in a wonderful outburst of ""E non ho amato mai tanto la vita"". Sherrill Milnes sings Scarpia with a powerful baritone, only if he could add some varieties in reflecting the character's human side, other than just evil. Also, did he really need that ugly unnatural-looking nose?
The film was exquisitely made, from the interior of the grand chapel to the crystals on Scarpia's dining table, everything was carefully chosen. Adding the effect of performing on locations where the story actually took place, this surely is an epic production of Tosca.",1039478400,12,1282,5.138755980861244
349994,5,6301694147,"I agree with the other reviewers here who have praised the performances of Kabaivanska, Domingo, and Milnes. All three sing well and are convincing as actors.  Shooting the opera on location is effective and adds to the dramatic power.
The DVD transfer, however, is not the best I have seen.  There are frequent white spots and ""dirt"", as well as places where the picture seems to skip a frame or two.  Considering the relatively recent date of the original filming, it is hard to believe that the DVD transfer came from the best source available. I have a DVD of Furtwangler's ""Don Giovanni"" which was filmed in 1954, and the transfer is much cleaner than this.
However, the sound is excellent, with the wide dynamic range one would expect from a DVD, and the slightly substandard video quality is not enough to give this anything less than a full 5-star rating.",1018051200,48,863,4.701986754966887
349995,5,6301694147,"I'd never experienced opera before seeing this treatment of Tosca, more years ago than I like to think, on PBS. I was captivated. Tosca remains my favorite opera ever -- and this version of it is still my favorite, even after the many I've seen subsequently. Yes, the scenery is terrific, Domingo and Kabaivanska are polished and effective... but for me, the most exciting performance was delivered by Milnes. Unlike every Scarpia I've seen subsequently (all of whom played the police chief as an aging rou who's been-there-done-that and come out the worse for wear), Milnes plays him as a man in his prime, with animal appetites and amorality -- a Scarpia who /does/ have attraction and power, and Tosca must fight with herself and her love for Cavaradossi to resist him. She wants him, though she knows she shouldn't, that he'll use her up and throw her away like his empty wineglass. That's an interpretation I've never seen anywhere else. I'd only be happier if it were a DVD...

349996,5,6301694147,"This is a beautiful, spectacular film which uses the real locations in Rome where the opera takes place.  Domingo and Milnes give wonderful performances.  As for Kabaivanska, I thought she was very good, but  certainly not the greatest Tosca of all time.  To the reviewers who said  Kabaivanska was the greatest of all time: have you seen Maria Callas?  For  me, Callas is the greatest ever.  But Kabaivanska is a good actress and  gives a moving performance.",937267200,18,459,4.857142857142857

Milnes created a really hateful villian with his remarkable voice and acting skills.",1255910400,2,386,5.241935483870968

350089,4,6301694147,"If you don't mind a movie version of an opera, then this is a great production to enjoy.  It takes place in the actual spots designated in the libretto and is very realistic even though the characters are singing instead of speaking.  The costumes are beautiful and very authentic.  The singers were all in their prime physically and vocally and give powerful performances.  Since it was edited, there are no intermissions which gives the opera a strong build-up to the final scene.  I certainly was caught up in the intrigue even though I've seen the opera many times.",1219017600,5,569,4.76530612244898

350091,5,6301694147,"Puccini's reputation as a verismo composer is based primarily on La Boheme - a wonderful opera, but neither typical nor his best.  His last opera was Turandot, and there's nothing of verismo about it - a grand, grand opera, a fairytale opera, an opera of princesses and princes.  Sometimes I lean toward considering Turandot Puccini's best.

However, most of the time I can't overcome the notion that Tosca was the best thing he ever wrote.  As a drama the opera's concision magnifies its dramatic punch - or perhaps its powerful drama makes it seem shorter than it really is.  This performance is less than 2 hours long and holds the viewer on the edge of his or her seat even if she or he is thoroughly familiar with it.  Puccini's music shines in its brilliance like a nearby nova.  His 4-note descending leitmotiv for Scarpia and his villainy is among the best such theme written ... if not the best.  The short theme which introduces and ends Act I is also a marvel of revelatory concision.  Tosca's libretto is one of the best constructed in opera.  Each act moves naturally to its own climax, each climax more poignant than the one previous.

If Tosca were not such a well-known opera, it might be worthwhile to rehearse the plot here.  As it is, plenty of reviews go through it and of course nowadays there's Wikipedia to provide as much information as one might wish.

This production of Tosca is as close to perfect as we're likely to get.  To begin with, and most particularly, it's filmed in the exact locations in Rome specified by the libretto.  The grandeur of these settings, particularly in Act I, magnifies the effect of the performance.

Secondly, the principal roles are portrayed by 3 outstanding singing actors.  I've never encountered Rania Kabaivanska before, but her portrayal of Tosca is outstanding.  Her passions are utterly convincing and her beauty is exactly the sort that would inflame Scarpia's heart (or whatever he has in the center of his chest).  Her expressions and demeanor are always totally appropriate to her words and her situation.  Her voice may not be considered ravishing, but it's clear and musical in all registers.  She's completely believable as an Italian diva of old Italy (except perhaps several stone lighter).  Play her performance of ""Vissi d'arte"" a few time.  It's glorious.  She follows the modern style of doing it on the floor, but only on her knees and not sprawled out.  The performance itself evokes nothing so much as the great Maria Callas, her voice ringing and yet somehow showing her sense of strain.

One has only to see and hear Plcido Domingo in any role to become convinced he is its most effective avatar.  Here he is Cavaradossi down to his heels.  His voice is a clear, ringing instrument - and hardly any modern tenor (save perhaps Alfredo Kraus) could match him for effective acting and stage presence.

Sherrill Milnes is, always has been, the quintessential Scarpia.  His facial expressions are chilling ... watch him particularly at the end of Act I, during his monologue beginning ""Go, Tosca!"" and ending, ""Tosca, you make me forget god!""  The lasciviousness, the cunning, the malice of the man are palpable.

A 3-star review on this site complains of poor mixing in this recording, making the orchestra tend to drown out the singers.  I don't hear that on my version.  Perhaps it has been re-mixed along the way - although I can recall one instance of the brass being a little over-raucous and treading on Domingo's toes.

Tosca is one of the 10 greatest operas ever written (see my list on Amazon).  This performance is the best, or one of the very best, on DVD.  You can hardly afford not to get it, particularly as the price is the lowest around for a complete performance of a full opera.  I should note that the photography sometimes looks just the tiniest bit fuzzy.  But don't miss it, even if you only get it as a rental.",1205280000,6,3913,4.723781388478582
350092,5,6301694147,"In this production, the villians are really villians, the lovers oh so much in love and the real settings amplify the drama. The performances are outstanding and the direction subtle or in your face as and when it needs to be. I am marginally disappointed with the quality of the sound but prehaps I need to explore some settings on my system.",1154044800,2,343,4.548387096774194
350093,5,6301694147,"This is the best ""Tosca"" in movie. Actually, the other video recordings available are of lesser quality, v.g., that insipid movie with the ""satin doll"" Gheorgiu and her anodyne and boring screamer-husband. There is also a Corelli's ""Tosca"", which is not problematic because of the singer, but because they substituted (I think for aesthetic reasons) La Caniglia for an actress, for she was old and fat at that time (end of her career).
Well, this is a wonderful, really amazing movie. Kabaivanska is just fantastic, deliverying powerful drama from the beginning to the end. Domingo is an excelent, totally convincing Cavaradossi, and his singing send chills down the spine...
Milnes is a great surprise, for I was not very fond of his somewhat ""barking"" sounds. However, judging for this recording, I have to say that he is dramatically and technically convincing.
Well, the rest of the cast is very good as well, the Sacrestano is a very good singer.

350094,2,6301694147,I was hoping for the performance from Italy sung in 24hrs at the actual locations.

350095,4,6301694147,"This opera-movie combine the excellent music of Puccini with acting in the enviroments of old Rome. The scenes and costumes are realistic, the acting is good and singing is excellent. Domingo is very good as Cavaradossi (of course), Milnes does a great Scarpia, and Kabaivanska performs an outstanding Tosca. The final scene in act 1 is powerful, and the final scene tragic and great. I will recommend this persformance strongly if you don't mind dubbing and opera as a movie.",1126569600,15,476,4.9625
350096,5,6301694147,"Deutsche Grammophone has outdone themselves with the release of this 1975 Tosca starring Placido Domingo, Raina Kabaivanska and Sherill Milnes. It is largely considered the greatest opera film ever made. The singing/music was recorded in a studio and then transferred on to the film to synchronize with the action of the film. The cinematography is top-notch, authentic Napoleon Era costumes are used and the film is shot on location in the settings Puccini wrote for in the opera- Act 1 The Church of San Adrea De La Valle, Act 2 Scarpia's Palace Farnese and Act 3 The Tower/Rooftop of the Castel San Angelo in Rome. Visually and acting-wise, it looks brilliant. There are tiny things I noted that do disturb me but they can be overlooked once you realize we are treated to great opera by singers who know their stuff and provide passionate portrayals.

The Hungarian diva Raina Kabaivanska is known as the soprano who sang the most number of Toscas in her career. She knew the role down to a ""t."" She is in her best voice in this performance and her acting is convincingly intense and emotional. She has genuine chemistry with Placido Domingo, who makes the best Mario Cavaradossi in that he provides the role with passion and idealisic spirit. Domingo knows that Mario is not only an artist but a lover of liberty (though a blind one since he believes that Napoleon is pro-liberty). Likewise, Kabaivanska subdues the diva-esque character of Tosca, making her a woman who is real and experiencing real intense feelings in diverse situations - unreasonable jealousy in Act 1, torture, horror and murderous rage in Act 2, love and suicidal despair in Act 3. Sherill Milnes' Scarpia is a little too weak for me. I prefer a more in-your-face Scarpia, a real nasty piece of work so I have preferred the interpretations of Tito Gobbi, Justino Diaz, Cornell McNeill and Samuel Ramey. Vocally, Sherill Milnes is superb. He captures the character's wickedness, power and lust with flair. He even acts the part well, but for the reason that I still feel nothing when seeing him as I do with the other baritones I mentioned I cannot praise Milnes. Milnes has worked a lot with Domingo on record for the RCA label - Aida,Otello,  Trovatore, Tosca and Forza Del Destino. Milnes is a top ranking baritone but in this production his Scarpia is very bland to me. I would have liked it if Justino Diaz had been cast (Diaz has done other opera films including the Grace Bumbry/Karajan Carmen, and the Domingo/Ricciarelli/Zefferelli Otello.

Little things that bothered me were some of the things perhaps people rarely notice. In certain scenes, when I NEEDED, JUST NEEDED to see faces or close-ups to see reactions, I got nothing. In the infamous scene in which Tosca stabs Scarpia, we mostly get Scarpia's perspective camera-wise, and are seeing Tosca through his eyes. It is filmed with graphic intensity and the blood on her hands is a little too much. Further, in the end of Act 1 during the Te Deum Procession Scene, a brief glimpse of ceremonial guests reveal what appear to be men in Ku Klux Klan white robes and hoods! What was that ? Does anyone know who those men are ? What do they have to do with the Te Deum Scene ? When Tosca throws herself from the Castel San Angelo tower in the finale, we see her limp body bleeding in the street and steps below. Not a pretty sight. This film intended to shock as I can see. Also, the little annoyances included the looks of the characters and or their costumes. Raina Kabaivanska is a beautiful woman and quite young in this film, but her modern haircut is not to my liking and feel she comes off as a modern woman from the 70's stepping back in time to the 1800's for a visit. Placido Domingo, usually a well-dressed, shaven and handsome looks absolutely grisly in this film. He is chubby, hairy (hairy chest) and bearded. He does not make the same romantic impression he would later do in the 1982 Zefferelli La Traviata or even the Trovatore conducted by Karajan and also starring Kabaivanska. He would lose weight and take on dashing leads in the 80's but in this film he is just not doing it for me as Cavaradossi. But other than these things, the film is a must have. It leaves you breathless, has a dramatic impact and is musically excellent.",1125705600,38,4285,4.6728476821192055

7814534,4,6301694147,"This is an excellent movie Tosca. And if you want to see Domingo in a movie opera, this one is a lot better than the Ponnelle Butterfly (Domingo/Freni). The singing is top notch and the costumes and sets are deluxe. There is not a lot of effort to turn the opera into ""cinema"" - you'll see mostly very basic camera work. That's fine - at least the director has avoided distracting the viewer with poorly thought-out ideas.

This DVD loses a star because the singers you see are obviously not really singing. There's something a bit jarring about hearing the singers sing with so much athleticism and seeing them stand there calmly moving their mouths as if they were talking to each other. Perhaps the producer/director thought that seeing singers singing close up is not attractive or perhaps not ""realistic"". I think in this case it takes away from the urgency and emotion of the visual part of the performance.

7814535,5,6301694147,"Where to start?  This movie of Tosca is so wonderful!  It has so much going for it, that it is hard to know where to start.  Location, location, location!  Singing, singing, singing.  Acting, acting, acting!

Floria Tosca:  Robert Merrill's documentary, ""I Live For Art, On Performing Tosca"", featured interviews with noted Toscas of the 20th century.  One of the divas, Leonie Rysanek, explicated her interpretation of Floria Tosca as being just a little bit older than Cavaradossi, which helps to explain her intense jealousy.  This Tosca, Raina Kabaivanska, acts the part of that slightly older Tosca.  She is beautiful, fascinating, passionate and utterly in love with Domingo's Cavarodossi.  This Tosca is openly obsessive in her love and jealousy.  Kabaivanska may not be among the greatest singers of this role, but she understands, looks and acts the part of a Tosca who is confident in her stage persona, but less in her relationship with her handsome young artist.  And, be assured that her singing is just fine.  She's not my favorite Floria, but she is very, very good!

Cavarodossi:  Domingo gives you all you could desire of Cavarodossi, and more.  He portrays Cavarodossi as a thoroughly romantic figure--subversive, though idealistic; passionate, though clear-eyed; sexually magnetic and seductive, though sincerely in love with Tosca.  His looks are perfect.  His acting is wonderful.  Watching him in the first encounter with Scarpia, then in the torture scene, he leaves no doubt that he is willing to die for loyalty and his politics.  Watch the third act, while Tosca tells him how they will escape, how to fall convincingly, how happy they will be.  You may sense that Domingo plays it as though Cavarodossi knows that, even dead, Scarpia is relentless.  Domingo's Cavarodossi knows he is doomed, that he will die.  He goes before the firing squad afraid, yet resigned.  For my ears, Domingo's slightly baritone-colored tenor is perfect for Cavarodossi.

Scarpia:  Milnes is stunning in this role, and brings some fine points to the character.  His Scarpia is evil, but not in the same way as Wixell, who brought a kind of base vulgarity to Scarpia.  Nor is he as exquisitely decadent as Gobbi.  With his classic good looks, it seems to me that Milnes plays Scarpia as Lawrence Olivier may have.  We know he is bad, but he's so slick that Tosca would never guess it in the first act.  Another reviewer mentioned the fake nose.  So, somebody thought they had to do something to make Milnes look bad; and that certainly would be a challenge.  I still did not like the nose.  Such an actor!  As Scarpia escorts Tosca from the church in the first act, he does the long walk while never taking his eyes from the prize.  For the entire promenade, his penetrating gaze is trained on Tosca.  I don't think he even blinked.  The voice!  Love that voice!

The shepherd boy:  This is little ""Placi"" Domingo, who looks about 10 or 11 years old here.  This scene is delightful.  Domingo Jr. is adorable, barefoot in the dewy morning grasses, interacting with his flock of sheep, stoking the fire.  This shepherd boy sings with a penetrating, pure and straight tone.  This is just as a shepherd boy would sound, which is not like a boy soprano in the church choir, or a woman singing ""light"".  Placi Domingo gives us a boy who learns and sings his songs in the fields and hills, rather than the church.  You just must see and hear him.

The sheep:  Being real sheep, their performance is pretty straightforward.

This movie version of Tosca is wonderful.  Others have mentioned the ""dirt"" in the video.  Don't let that stop you.  Just be aware that this is a 1976 televised production.  It was great when I saw it then on the little screen.  It's great now.  Be reminded that this production was filmed on location, and the location is a knock out.  From start to finish, this is a jewel.",1262822400,7,3896,4.7990936555891235
