2348099,5,B000A0GYCS,"I have seen this wonderful movie. Norma Jean will now shine in the eyes of all Marilyn fans world wide. This film humanizes the woman who has become immortal! She was after all only one woman. Jim has set the record straight....all because of his undying love. What a true romance! We all love Marilyn...now we can love Norma Jeane as well! Anyone who minimizes the essence of this story has never truly been in love! Not unlike a childless person....claiming to know anything re-raising children!

All this and done with local ingenuity. It is refreshing to find that not all movies have to come from Hollywood. There is such talent locally and it shines through in Marilyn's Man.",1127779200,20,681,4.722689075630252
2348100,4,B000A0GYCS,"I liked this documentary and actually cried while watching it. (What a great song, ""All About Love"") Jim elucidates his love for Norma Jeane; proof that if you do love someone or something you sometimes have to let it go. The film has a real natural flow to it. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to see a different perspective on things...not to mention great photos, too.",1126483200,23,384,4.579710144927536
2348101,5,B000A0GYCS,This documentary is very well done. I found it very interesting. The music is fantastic.,1126396800,12,88,4.933333333333334
2348102,1,B000A0GYCS,"With all due respect to the recently deceased James Dougherty, who seems to have been a very decent man, this is without a doubt the worst, cheesiest, ill-conceived, non-edited, putridly scored, out of sequence excuse for a film that I've ever seen. If it didn't have interspersed snippets of film and still photos of Marilyn, this could be a film about anything or nothing. James Dougherty, who cannot be blamed for this mess, rambles on and on, sometimes about Marilyn/Norma Jeane, sometimes about Maine, sometimes about his then present wife, sometimes about the L.A.P.D. that employed him, all with absolutely no chronoligcal order or relevance to anything. There is no progression of story, no ""I first met Norma Jeane..."", nothing unfolds as would be expected. Photos of Marilyn The Star are shown as he's talking about Norma Jeane, and photos of Norma Jeane are shown as he is talking about something like marksmanship.... whatever it was, it had absolutely nothing to do with the subject of the pictures being shown or the supposed subject of this supposed film. The rambling dialogue is sporadically cut off and stills of Marilyn/Norma Jeane appear, to a soundtrack of what must be some of the most amateurish, badly written, badly sung songs ever ""composed"", which, amazingly, again have nothing to do with what's being shown.[...] The incredulous laughter that emits from first viewing this catastrophe quickly gives way to total disbelief that someone could intentionally make a film this bad about ANYTHING, at which point total boredom sets in. This film promises ""revealing truths"", ""rare film clips"", etc...but delivers absolutely nothing that hasn't been seen or heard numerous times, only not possibly this badly told. The first clue of just how bad this film was going to be came right at the beginning, with the dreaded ""re-creation"" scene, supposedly of the young Norma Jeane pining for her Jimmy. The ornate period rooms the actress who is also supposedly ""Norma Jeane"" is languishing longingly in are nothing like the simple, modest surroundings that they truly did live in, as anyone who knows their M.M. history is already aware of. Also in the beginning there are film clips of Marilyn, and the creators of this mess didn't even bother to note that one is not even M.M., but is Jane Russell in Marilyn drag in the courtroom scene from ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes."" As this film progresses from bad to awful to unwatchable, it is almost constantly accompanied by not only the horribly written, totally modern and out of context songs, but also by an irritating aria like backround vocal which will make you wonder if you are going insane. [...] As stated earlier, James Dougherty was a very decent man, who throughout his life spoke only generously, wistfully, and lovingly of the woman who was his wife for four years. His excellent little remembrence he wrote in the 1970's, ""The Secret Happiness Of Marilyn Monroe"", was all he needed to say and all we needed to know of those lost years, before Norma Jeane became the most beloved star and greatest legend in the history of Hollywood. If you are a true Marilyn fan, do yourself a favor and read his book if you haven't already done so. [...]",1126224000,9,3217,4.92633517495396
8071677,3,B000A0GYCS,"I bought a storage locker at auction and found that it had belonged to the man who made this documentary, so I purchased it out - out of curiosity.",1448409600,,147,4.103448275862069
8071678,3,B000A0GYCS,"The focus wasn't mostly on Norma Jeane, it was mostly on her husband, Jim, and then his next wife.  It's okay, but I didn't take anything I already knew about Miss Monroe.",1430352000,,171,4.34375
8071679,4,B000A0GYCS,"This documentary is special and somewhat historic in that very little is known about Norma Jean before she became ""Marilyn Monroe."" Some of her history was made up by the studios or PR people. Here Jim Dougherty gives true insight into Norma Jean. He was just a normal man who happened to become involved with a woman who was going to be one of the most famous, legendary, iconic and mesmerizing persons in the world. Peeling away the layers of her persona with his insight still leaves her interesting and an enigma.

Mr. Dougherty's story is poignant and touching. After 4 years of marriage to Norma Jean he eventually found his own way to move on and remarry a loving woman and have children. He admits to only knowing Norma Jean and NOT ""Marilyn Monroe."" A rose by any other name would still smell as sweet. The power of her legend followed him for the rest of his life. I'm glad I have this in my collection.",1257206400,3,913,4.467065868263473
8071680,1,B000A0GYCS,I couldn't even finish to watch the 'documentary'. Poorly done and boring. Not even for a Marilyn fan.,1204502400,2,102,4.722222222222222
8071681,3,B000A0GYCS,"The honest to God truth is that Jim Dougherty was not very nice to Norma Jeane.  He married her as a ""favor"" and not for love; he went out drinking and hunting with his ""buddies"" on a regular basis; stopped off at the pool hall after work on most nights; left Norma Jeane alone so very often, which was the very thing she hoped to escape in life - the lonliness and rejection she'd always known.  Always scared to death of being rejected again or sent off to the friggin orphanage or another ""foster family"" she didn't know, she just longed for some normalcy in her life and getting married sounded like the ticket for belonging!!  And she was crazy about him!  He treated her bad, he told her to shut up a lot, he belittled her when they went out on the town by dancing with other women while leaving Marilyn at the table on her own - things like that.  After having sex with her, he'd just turn over and go to sleep, leaving her awake, cold, and alone wondering if she was doing things right to please him.  She was 16 -  what a nice age to be shoved off on a man cause you're simply ""in the way.""  No one EVER told the poor girl the birds & bees or anything about sex.  She had to learn all that from a male cheauvanist like Jim?  ew[...]  He knew she was an animal lover and yet he'd bring a dead rabbit or other animal home to skin in their kitchen, which sent her into histerics!  He didn't truly love her which is why he didn't think nothing of treating her this way.  And to think - he had the best thing in his life  -  a girl who had nothing but kindness and love in her heart, always willing to give and not take, never demanding, and just as sweet as anyone could be.  He actually didn't know a good thing when he had it.  She finally wised up after 4 years of pretty much ""spousal abuse via verbal & abandonment.""  Here he leaves her alone while he takes off for the merchant marines.  She begged him not to leave.  He had a good job at Lockheed!  He left for the merchant because his buddies were going.  He was a man's man and all he really cared ABout was being with his buddies.  The last thing Norma needed was to be ""abandoned"" again!!!  She was never loved by a soul at that point in her life.  He deserved what he got - an empty house upon return!  Yea, after she became famous he has a story to tell, of course.  Well, if he'd treated her like the angel that she was - he wouldn't have got ""left behind""  -  he got some of his own medicine.  He turned into a better man with age and experience, sure, but that didn't help Norma Jeane any.  Little too late.  I believe the only man who really loved her with his whole heart was Joe D.  Unfortunately he was extremely jealous.  Not a good combination with a ""sex-symbol"" eye-popping, gorgeous wife.  Poor Marilyn.  If there's a heaven, she's there.",1202947200,,2818,4.163265306122449
8071682,1,B000A0GYCS,"This is the slowest, worst ""documentary"" I've seen to once again take advantage of Marilyn Monroe's name.  It is the long rantings of an old codger who is trying to remember anything he can make up about his loveless marriage to the great Marilyn. She dropped him as soon as she could after the marriage was arranged.  She saw where her life would end up if she stayed with him.

The woman he should be thanking and doing the documentary about is his present wife, who I'm sure has put up with a lot over the years.  Let it go, Jim.....it's getting pathetic.",1159228800,11,558,4.388349514563107
8071683,3,B000A0GYCS,"I have to agree that the film is very poorly edited. It is touching and interesting, but poorly done.

FYI one of the pictures in one of the many photo montages is not Marilyn Monroe, it is a a Marilyn Monroe look-alike...me!

The picture has been my publicity shot for over 13 years and has been published in books and on many websites as being me in all that time. The producer refuses to admit his mistake, so to try to halt any future confusion I am letting you all know here.

As for the film...its worth seeing because Marilyn is in it.",1139097600,8,542,4.242718446601942
8071684,2,B000A0GYCS,"I was so exited to get this NEW Documentary about Marilyn Monroe, I heard so many good reviews that I went for it! I'm not happy with the end product, I thought that it would have a more inside depth about her life before she became the movie star we all grew to admire,this documentary is about a man longing for the love he had and lost, sure there's a couple of clips and photographs I haven't seen before, every other clip and photo you'll see in this DVD you can find it in every other documentary out there!!!! like I mentioned this is just the melancholic, nostalgic desire of a man that never forgot his first wife, she just happend to be Marilyn Monroe.",1136160000,10,662,4.304
8071685,5,B000A0GYCS,I have been searching for Marilyn Monroe items to write about in school. I came across this movie online. I was hoping to get a real autograph from anything Marilyn signed and bring it into school but instead found Marilyn's Man interesting. I bought it on Dvd and loved this movie. I hope I can at least get an autographed copy from the producer of the movie to bring into school and share with my friends. I hope whoever else reads this will take consideration to see this movie like I did. Wish you all find this movie fun like I did.,1129075200,15,537,4.2745098039215685
8071686,3,B000A0GYCS,"Hi there, I went to a store out here and someone was dressed up as Monroe. She told us that there was a movie out named Marilyn's Man which was about her earlier times when she was alive. Dressed up Monroe told me that her first husband passed on and the move spoke about him. I and a friend of mine went online to research the sites about this film. I have to say going on Empire site we listened the samples of all songs and the soundtrack seems nice. I would also like to tell JIMMY WATKINS that there are many more artists he forgot to give credit to. After reading all these comments on this site I don't know if I'm going to buy it yet. I read CHIATZ and even MOVIEVIEWERS. I agree with MOVIEVIEWER that ALL ABOUT LOVE is nice and thought from the sample on Empire  that the singer was black. He has a TOP40 radio feel. My friend and I even checked out Chris Tian website and the site is professionally done.",1128124800,14,914,4.134831460674158
