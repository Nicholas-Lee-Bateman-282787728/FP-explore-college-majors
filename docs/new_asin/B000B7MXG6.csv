8083188,5,B000B7MXG6,"I anticipated the arrival of this movie anxiously and was rewarded with a relatively short waiting period. It came just as promised, with quality audio and video. I LOVED the movie - it was silly, over the top and held my rapt attention throughout. I know most of the actors were locals from Seattle (my hometown) and I have to give a shout out to Jason Collins as Ralph Peed....I just loved him.",1432512000,,396,4.438356164383562

8083190,3,B000B7MXG6,A strange indie horror musical.  Very different and weird. Wish it was more violent! If it was I could see it becoming a cult film.,1384560000,,131,4.24
8083191,5,B000B7MXG6,"This movie is a fun, campy film about some misfits who go on an adventure.  After being denied for the role of Jesus in a community theater production, four colorful actors decide to travel cross country to audition for Jesus Christ Superstar.  After stopping in a small, Christian town, the four are arrested for sins against God.

If you like The Comebacks, this is a movie of the same ilk!",1339718400,,392,4.571428571428571
8083192,4,B000B7MXG6,"This is billed as `A bawdy & Surreal Art Musical. With  Zombies'. And yes it sort of is and it is actually a lot more. It kicks off with four very different actors auditioning for `The Greatest Play Ever Written!' They are all up for the part of Jesus. One is a black power, revolutionary, one a spirited Jew, a bi-sexual hippy and a red head femme fatal (and I do mean fatal). They all get blown off for the gig by the brilliantly over the top director.

So in the spirit of Thespian camaraderie they decide to all bond by taking a road trip to New York to audition for the revival of `Jesus Christ -Superstar'. So on static motor bikes with a rolling canvas backdrop they wend their merry way. Whilst taking a breather for free love and beer they encounter a band of evil Elvis impersonators (including one who is a dwarf - uh huh). Things go bad and the foursome do a runner and find themselves in the arse end of beyond, the Evangelical town of Jackville.

There they get arrested for being gay and such stuff but are released on bail into the hands of the community (prison would have been better). Thus the true spirit of this corrupt band of Bible bashers is revealed. Then the undead and the local brothel come into the fray.

This is a comedy that is camper than a drag queen pantomime - in a sequined tent. It is a bit bawdy, it is all done on a shoestring budget, the make up is particularly laughable and the casting director deserves a medal for finding and creating such a grotesquery of characters. The songs are one dimensionally bad in that they are good and the action is more or less non stop.

Angie Louise who wrote the screen play also, acts as Jessie and Sue Corcoran (director and plays Prudence) have made a cult classic. This is one that put a smile on my face from the start and it stayed there. This is not high cinema or a horror, it is a comedy of characters that have spent too much time in wardrobe and make up and cant deliver a single line straight. I ruddy well loved it. If a `zom com' is your thing then also check out `Dead Heads'. This though is pure fun, an ideal companion to a night in with your mates and quite a bit of booze - this is Troma for the 21st Century.",1331164800,,2206,4.218009478672986
8083193,5,B000B7MXG6,"In these days of sequels and remakes, Gory Gory Hallelujah is a breath of fresh Artistic air and a hoot to boot !!
5 Stars",1193443200,,122,3.92
8083194,3,B000B7MXG6,"Another entry in the long tradition of Jesus Motorcycle Gang movies, Sue Corcoran's GORY GORY HALLELUJAH is the groovy tale of four actors who try out for the role of Jesus in ""The Greatest Play Ever Written.""  The quartet approaches their roles from different perspectives.  There's Rahim the black revolutionary (Jeff Gilbert), Sky the bi hippie (Tim Gouran), Joshua the mensch (Todd Licea), and Jessie the feminist (Angie Louise).  When the four Jesuses run into a pack wild Elvis impersonators things get all shook up.  On the run from the law after one of the King of Kings lays low one of the Kings of Rock `n' Roll, the group happens upon the wrong backwater Podunk town.

It's about here where this wild movie settles down; perhaps a little too much.  Our four Jesuses become prisoners in Jacksville and are placed with various pillars of the community, only to find that they're not everything they pretend to be.  Unfortunately, this was about the time that I lost interest in the movie.  I could have done for more hysteria and less histrionics.  It's a shame that this flick didn't live up to its potential.  Even the zombie-filled finale can't save the tepid second act.",1149120000,2,1183,4.783251231527093
8083195,5,B000B7MXG6,"This film is a hell of a lot of fun. I picked it up at Best Buy and love it! Great, great fun. It's a mix of Zombies, musicals and Evil Dead. Any Sam Raimi fans out there will find this fun! Plus it has some coked out Elvis's that you've got to see. Very clever and I highly recommend.",1136937600,,285,3.7666666666666666
