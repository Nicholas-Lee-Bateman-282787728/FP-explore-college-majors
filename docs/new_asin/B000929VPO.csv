8056767,5,B000929VPO,Too bad she doesn't make more DVDs.,1480377600,,35,4.142857142857143
8056768,5,B000929VPO,"This video took me some time and lots of practice to learn, which is what I was looking for.  In the beginning, I would pause the parts that were intricate and repeat until I got them.  I found this engaging and challenging... plus it forced me to exercise longer while learning it, and the continued challenge to concentrate has kept me revved as I dislike monotonous and repetitive exercise- I always look forward to it.  When I don't feel my out-of-home exercise class exerts me enough, I come home and do Rock Steady, or make sure I alternate with it the next day.  If I haven't done it in a while, I have to review parts, which keeps it interesting. I like the way the combos can be done separately, so that I can customize my workout according to my time or fitness level, with small pauses to drink some water or rest (esp. when recovering from a cold).  I don't particularly like the warm-up combo as there are a lot of ""repeaters"" and it gets to my knees...but starting at combo #3 and going till the end of the routine is a perfect workout for me. I find the floor routine too time consuming and usually skip it, though I'm sure it's effective.
I also like the back-ground music; it's motivating, sort of a rock-techno mix and not that de-motivating pop music some work-outs have. Unlike other reviewers, I enjoy the added spins and optional advanced moves.  The cues are fine...nobody's perfect all the time, nor do they need to be if you're concentrating-it's good to stretch the brain as well as the body.",1296172800,,1518,4.501818181818182
8056769,4,B000929VPO,"I really liked this tape, but it's not for every one. The choreography takes a few tries to get into, and unfortunately the person showing the modifications is off most of the time. However, once you get it, it's a great workout that doesn't get boring. Also, the 15 minute abs section is awesome! The biggest complaint I have about it (besides the clueless girl in the back) is that Seasun put a lot of spins in that I feel could have been left out and would not have taken away from the workout, but it's easy enough to modify. I just think it would have made it a little easier without having to turn and face away from the TV all the time. In all I think this is a great workout, and quickly becoming one of my favorites. I would stay away though if you don't like more ""dancey"" choreography.",1178409600,,796,4.243421052631579
8056770,3,B000929VPO,"Okay, I know it says advanced but I couldn't even get through the warm-up..tried it in slow-mo..could not figure out what the heck she was doing.  Even advanced steppers can't learn a routine that makes you turn your back to the TV..which she starts right off doing. I'm like trying to follow along and then she's got her back to me and it's a whole big mess.  I rented it from Netflix..don't think I'll need to own this one.",1174262400,2,425,4.367088607594937
8056771,2,B000929VPO,"I do step 3-4 times per week and this instructor is the hardest one I have ever had to follow!!! She acts as if you've been doing her class for years and doesn't do much demonstration. The choreography is VERY advanced and she doesn't have the same rhythm as other instructors you will find on the web i.e. Taylor, Smith, Anderson. If you get frustrated easily, do not buy this tape. It would be a waste of your money. If you're willing to stick with it, it's a tough workout that will get your heart rate up there.",1168560000,4,515,4.26530612244898
8056772,5,B000929VPO,"I am not the most coordinated person and the first two times I tried this DVD it made me so frustrated all I could do was cry.  It was hard to see what she was doing with my back to the TV! But when I realized that I didn't have to get it all 100% of the time as long as I kept moving and picked up where I could I was fine.  I can now do all but the last piece, and that's more because I am just too tired after 45 minutes to keep going.  But I love it!  I watched each section first and then tried it, that worked pretty well.  Once I had an idea of what she was doing her verbal cues made it so I didn't have to look at the TV.  Very good cuing. I think I am going to order the other one!",1155168000,5,691,3.543046357615894
8056773,5,B000929VPO,"This is a great step workout for people who love complex step choreography. There is a fast-paced warm-up followed by 7 combinations. Seasun then proceeds with a cool-down, core work, and finally a stretch. As far as cueing goes, Seasun is OK. She is not perfect, but I found it fairly easy to follow along even on my first run-through. There is not an excessive amount of TIFTing (taking it from the top).

I found this workout to be challenging but doable. I like workouts that engage my brain as well as my body and this definitely fits into that category. If you are at an intermediate/advanced fitness level and enjoy intricate step choreography, you will like this workout.",1140998400,10,679,4.705882352941177
8056774,4,B000929VPO,I have been doing step for a little over 3 years now. I have go to classes weekly and use my bench at home. I found this tape fun but hard to follow. Seasun moves fast and if you are not familiar with step you will get lost. I suggest watching this video once before attempting to work out with it. You will find that familirizing yourself with the moves will make this video easier to follow!!!,1136937600,7,395,4.142857142857143
