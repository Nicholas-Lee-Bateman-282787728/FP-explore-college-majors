964117,2,6304989245,"The evil Lord Doom sends an amphibious monster into the Omega Quadrant to initiate the destruction of Earth, and it is up to intergalactic policeman Mogyar and a group of unsuspecting humans to stop the 200-foot menace! KRAA is Full Moon's response to the GODZILLA remake of 1998, but even fans of the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers will find this all to be a bit silly. Considering the cheapness of the production, however, the scale miniatures and creature design are really quite impressive. An incredible amount of care has gone into the construction of this project, and Kraa's explosive rampage through the streets of New Jersey stacks up against many of the lesser Kaiju Eiga. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the acting or plot, but anyone willing to pick up a film called KRAA! THE SEA MONSTER will know what to expect. A resume booster for the special effects team, but only mild entertainment for monster fans.

964118,1,6304989245,"Actually, to be honest, KRAA!The Sea Monster is... blah. It's not good enough to be interesting, but not bad enough to be worth making fun of. It's just basically a waste of time. I have been known to watch some pretty bad movies, but I won't watch this one again unless Little Sis wants to see it.

The only good thing about the movie is KRAA! himself. Not anything he does, 'cause he really doesn't do anything, but the costume/whatever. He? is gorgeous, with vivid colors and some very nice details. If you get the chance to see screen shots/pics of the monster, check them out. Don't watch the (alleged) movie though... unless it's free... and you have nothing else to do. Really. Nothing.

964119,3,6304989245,"""Kraa"" is a ridiculous man-in-a-rubber-outfit movie that is oriented toward a young demographic, and has enough camp hilarity to earn it three stars easily. The short version is this: Lord Doom is stuck on the cold, dark planet of Proyas, but he covets a warm climate. He dispatches ""Kraa: planet wrecker for hire"" to Earth to destroy the civilizations there. Kraa lands in the ocean, but thankfully the Planet Patrol is watching from Planet Patrol Station 1645, conveniently located 14 light-years from Earth. The officers of the Planet Patrol appear to be about 14, and the newest member of the crew was sent into space because of her psychic abilities. Unfortunately Lord Doom disables their station, which leads to no end of squawking about different ridiculous problems they are encountering. It's not enough that the station's core is going critical, it's going ""hyper-critical"". That must be extra bad!

Kraa emerges from the Atlantic ocean and immediately begins his world domination by destroying a service station in New Jersey. If any of you have seen the Rick Sloane masterpiece ""Hobgoblins"", it turns out that Kraa looks like an enormous amphibious hobgoblin. That appearance combined with some of the cheesiest miniatures and sets in recent film history make for high camp value and many laughs. Fortunately for Earth the Planet Patrol sends its only available agent, Mogyar, to destroy Kraa. Mogyar, who resembles a cross between a moldy pimento cheese sandwich and a box turtle, speaks with an Italian accent, and quickly befriends a waitress and a biker, who happens to be a genius.

Pompous government thugs (in comical red and black uniforms) capture Mogyar and his friends and thwart their plans for saving the Earth. Thankfully, the captives are smarter than the captors and appropriate a nuclear power plant, which, when combined in a unique manner involving psychic mind-melding and astral projection, saves the Earth. You will learn many interesting details in the film. For instance, I didn't know it was possible to simply unplug a nuclear power plant. After some fisticuffs with Lord Doom and his midget sidekick the film comes to an end much like it began: with really long credits.

This is a totally absurd film, and is about as horrifying as an ABC After School Special, only without the high budget or fancy production values. Sure it's cheap and mindless, but it's also a newer piece of camp that even gets in a cheap shot at Godzilla. Watch it for a laugh; if you don't you will assuredly miss one hundred percent of its appeal.",1212710400,,2562,4.981308411214953
964120,1,6304989245,"Kraa is supposed to destroy the earth, but he doesn't seem to take his assignment very seriously.  Instead he just stands around in the same spot, waving his arms and shrieking until he gets shot.  Our protagonists are assisted by a thingamajig which is variously described as a ""talking sandwich"" and a ""cheese covered crab,"" and those descriptions are not far off.  This thing is the only interesting part of the movie, and by interesting I mean you're so disturbed by it, it's hard to divert your eyes from it.  It looks like a giant mushroom with hands; it speaks in an Italian accent and is covered with what looks like vomit.  The movie looks like it was filmed in a couple hours.  It makes Ed Wood look like Robert Altman by comparison.  Throw a dart in the video store, and you'll hit something that's a whole lot more entertaining than this crap.",1112227200,3,855,4.549019607843137
964121,4,6304989245,"If any of you have ever seen Zarkorr! The Invader, you will know this same movie is made by the same company. Although, Zarkorr does have its own problems which I state in my review of that film.

Kraa is a film that is a VERY cheap B movie; but besides that, the monster costume is just breathtaking and the acting is very good considering it is a very cheap film. Not to mention much better than Zarkorr.

Like Zarkorr, the only scenes we see the monster, Kraa, in is when he is destroying minature cities. He doesn't fight any military whatsoever and just goes stomping around. While it does get old pretty quick, the story is what keeps you in your seat because it is pretty good. Not to mention Kraa does look fabulous.

Overall, what can I say? The film was a cheapy to produce but for what was given, the film is pretty good but nothing spectacular. I based my rating of it on being a monster film and not as a regular film. If I had done that, it would get about 1 or 2 stars. But as a nice monster film, it serves its purpose.",1104710400,2,1035,4.165
964122,5,6304989245,"Lord Doom is tired of sitting in the middle of a cold, dead planet.  He wants to live somewhere that is warm.  So he instructs his dwarf henchman to send planet destroyer Kraa off to Earth to wipe out its civilization, thus making a takeover easier.  The Planet Patrol gets wind of this horrid plan and attempts to stop Lord Doom.  But Doom anticipated this and knocks their Death Star kinda thingie into self-destruct mode.  The Patrol does manage to send an operative to Earth to stop Kraa though.  His name is Mogyar and he kind of looks like a cheese covered crab, and he takes in an Italian accent!
Oh how I love this small, dumb movie.  It rips off everything that was popular in 1998.  Godzilla, The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, Star Trek, Men In Black, and it even tosses in Masters of the Universe for good measure.  I doubt that words can get across how gleefully stupid I think this thing is.
Kraa! The Sea Monster was one of two attempts at making old school style Kaiju funness by Charles Band's once Paramount funded Full Moon Pictures.  The other was Zarkorr! The Invader.  By 1998 the deal with Paramount was finis and Band was on his own.  Still with a little bit of cash (and a studio in Romania) he attempted to keep up the crank 'em out fast ethic alive.  Under the Full Moon umbrella such smaller 'speciality' productions were founded.  Pulsepounders (for tween entertainments), Surrender Cinema (for the *ahem* mature audiences), and Monster Island Entertainment (which distributed Zarkorr and Kraa) are the three I clearly remember, but I am sure there were one or two more.  Sadly the whole operation crashed and burned within a year or two and, for awhile, Band floundered.  Ever the astute survivalist though, Band has rebounded and Full Moon lives again!  So Kraa! The Sea Monster now sees life on DVD.  Sadly director Aaron Osbourne (or Dave Parker) contributes no commentary.  Heck, I doubt there are even any chapter stops!  There are some trailers, but parents be warned.  Most of the trailers are for Full Moon's skin exposing output, which makes this juvenile friendly movie a rather juvenile unfriendly disc release sadly enough.
Clearly Kraa is aimed at kiddie's, what with its teen heroes dolled up as Star Trek convention attenders and acting like they are Power Ranger style defenders of the galaxy.  Sadly they spend most of the movie trying to fix their busted Death Star station while the talking cheese covered crab attempts to convince the MiBs that he came in piece and can stop Kraa.  There is a generous amount of building smashing and the monsters are goofy looking (look close when Kraa smashes through the power lines, you can see the man in the suit's chin behind the teeth) yet still kind of cool looking (well Kraa is).  The only down side is that the dwarf henchman isn't played by Phil Fondacaro.  Mr. Fondacaro is one cool dude.  The dwarf in this movie, while I am sure he is a nice enough fellow, just doesn't hold a candle to the coolness that is Phil Fondacaro.  We need more movies with Phil Fondacaro.
I wish that Full Moon had done more Kaiju!",1074297600,10,3107,4.653211009174312
964123,1,6304989245,"This movie has a talking sandwich in it, how could you not like it? The acting is wooden, the special effects are laughable (even for a B movie), and the plot is rather vapid and torpid to say the least. The monster, however, looks cool, but don't expect anything grand if you see this. I mean this is to bad to even be on Sci-fi!!!",1074124800,,332,4.123076923076923
964124,4,6304989245,"Alright guys, this is not suppose to be some masterpiece entry into the monster genre. It is suppose to be straight to video and fun, and i think it really delivered on what it was ment to be. True an itialian speaking mollusk that sounds like the worst sterotype for Mario is dumb.....but what you want.....that or a cute and cuddle pikachu wanna be.
Only real complaint i have is the Planet Patrol.....eesh. Ok, teenagers that travel the galaxy like an interglactic police force......yeah. That is all i am saying on that.
Ok, now for the real reason y you people bought this dvd. Kraa. I admit, at first i kinda cringed at the sheer bulkness of the suit, over time watching it, i have grown accustom to it. It kinda is like a lovechild from the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and the gillman from Monster Squad. The minitures and effects are fun to watch, though nothing extravagant. Kraa really didn't remind me of a dangerous world demolishing creature. I guess the Dr. Doom rip off villian didn't quit think his plan all the way through. Ah well.
Story is easy to follow. Kraa gets sent to earth. Speaking mollusk gets sent after to help earthlings build a gun that in the end kills poor kraa. The fish didn't see it coming *sob*
Overall...its worth the 10 bucks. But i still like Zarkorr better, and admit people to get that one first. Hopefully this is help the shy people from debating to buy this.",1073606400,,1408,4.525490196078431
964125,3,6304989245,"You want a good giant monster movie then rent something made by the Toho studios or featuring stop motion animation from Ray Harryhausen. If you want just dumb fun then you could do a whole lot worse than Kraa! The Sea Monster. A talking cheeseburger (believe me) tries to enlist the aid of some earthlings to battle a giant sea monster that threatens the world!

7882786,3,6304989245,"Kraa! The Sea Monster is another film by the makers of Zarkorr the Invader and to be fair: it's an improvement. The characters, though forgetable, arn't nearly as annoying as the one's in Zarkor. The monster, in my opinion looks better. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that he look good. The effect are better than Zarkorr as well. I particularly remember being impressed by the effects and cinematography  in one nightime city destruction scene. The movie, again, is a little boring. I know this seems to be something I say about a lot of movies and it is something that I've come to expect when viewing older foreign movies but this movie doesn't have any of those reasonings. The worst part about this movie is that it's forgetable. I brought this up with the characters and this is a problem througout. Even though Zarkorr was defeated in a highly predictable and slightly stupid way, I don't even remember how Kraa! Was defeated and I watched both of these back to back just the other month. But again.. I love the monster itself. Kraa! Looks amazing. Sad, that he didn't get to make it into any future films.",1470528000,,1115,4.54726368159204
