213836,5,6300181898,"I love Walter Matthau, he is a wonderful actor, and in this movie he delivers a wonderful performance with deadpan expressions and a grumpy exterior, which he is wonderful at doing.  When his character becomes an unwanted guardian of a six year old girl left by her father { who then drowns himself} as a marker for a loan he starts to soften up, but tries to hide it.  Sara Stimson is wonderful as ""the kid"" and Bob Newhart is good as the stuttering assistant of Matthau. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family, which is hard to find in lot of todays movies.  I love the beginning credits with all the tin wind up toys,  my uncle collected them!  This movie is one that I will enjoy many times and would recommend to anyone who wants a movie they can laugh at and enjoy with their family!",1278201600,,806,4.241830065359477
213837,5,6300181898,"Years ago I had seen Little Miss Marker and had been wanting to see it again. My husband had never seen the movie, he enjoys watching it over and over. The movie is wholesome entertainment, like entertainment should be.",1209254400,,219,4.641025641025641
213838,3,6300181898,"The 1980 remake of LITTLE MISS MARKER does visibly capture a lot of the 1930s feeling of the original Damon Runyon story, but the film as a whole seems under-done.

Walter Matthau plays the curmudgeonly bookie ""Sorrowful"" Jones, who finds himself lumbered with a six-year-old girl, known only as ""The Kid"" (played by Sara Stimson).  Throw a beautiful society dame into the mix (Julie Andrews at her loveliest), and you have one of the classic comedies.

The original version of LITTLE MISS MARKER was filmed by Paramount Pictures in 1934, starring Shirley Temple as ""The Kid"" and Adolphe Menjou as ""Sorrowful"".  In terms of sheer charm, the original wins hands-down, but the 1980 remake must be commended for re-creating the tale for a new generation.

Walter Matthau and Julie Andrews manage to conjure up some sort of chemistry--but despite that fact you'd never imagine them as a romantic couple.  Sara Stimson is appealing in the title role, and there are some fun cameos from Tony Curtis and Lee Grant.

Universal has released LITTLE MISS MARKER on a bare-bones DVD--fullscreen transfer, and there isn't even a menu.  However, the price is nice, and the movie itself is quite enjoyable.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1179878400,8,1227,5.064676616915423
213839,5,6300181898,I loved the movie years ago when it came out. It was wonderful to enjoy it again.,1163030400,,81,3.823529411764706
213840,5,6300181898,"This is a great, fun movie. Walter Matheau is always a treat to watch. I believe this is the 3rd remake of ""little Miss Marker"", the first with Adolf Menjou and Shirley Temple and the 2nd made in the early 60's with Tony Curtis (taking the little girl to Disneyland. This version from the early 80's is set in the depression era, with Tony Curtis as the villain. I recommend this movie for the whole family",1123718400,5,406,4.355263157894737
213841,5,6300181898,"This is such a feel-good comedy, one of Walter Matthau's best!

If you've seen the ""Odd Couple"", or for that matter any of Walter Matthau/Jack Lemmon's comedy, then you'll love this.

The casting is spot on!

So glad it's finally out on DVD :-)",1107820800,5,244,4.5
213842,4,6300181898,"This is vintage Walter Matthau, playing his trademark sourpuss personality.  Based on a story by Damon Runyon (the same author  whose stories formed the basis for the classic Guys and Dolls), the film is populated by the usual Runyonesque cast of endearing, gold-hearted Depression-era lowlife characters.  Matthau plays Sorrowful Jones, a bookie who takes the Kid (Sara Stimson) as a marker for a bet placed by her father, who promptly goes out and drowns himself.  Despite his flinty exterior, Jones has a heart and spends the rest of the movie trying to cope with his new status as father-by-default to the adorable Kid.  In this he is aided and abetted by his faithful sidekick, played admirably by Bob Newhart.  Julie Andrews as the love interest adds a touch of class.  The cast is rounded off by Tony Curtis, playing a less-than-menacing gangster who provides the third side of the love triangle.

The plot is carried entirely by Matthau, whose deadpan delivery of his lines is impeccable.  The humour does not insult the viewer's intelligence.  All in all, a film worth watching.

The only quibble I have is with the DVD, which is execrable.  There are no special features at all - not even a menu for selection of scenes.  What we have here is basically a VHS in DVD format.  One expects more nowadays.",1104796800,27,1311,4.794642857142857
213843,2,6300181898,"The Walter Matthau version of ""Little Miss Marker"" tries very hard to capture the authentic 1930s Damon Runyon flavor. The art direction is superb, the Henry Mancini score is wonderful, and Matthau is fine as always, but the film promises more than it delivers. The original Runyon story tells of a hard-hearted bookie who reluctantly accepts a little girl as security for a wager, and gradually thaws out as he cares for the child as his own. The story (faithfully told in the 1934 Adolphe Menjou-Shirley Temple film version) strikes all the right notes as the plot progresses, but the 1980 script rambles aimlessly and often overlooks key plot points, with many missed opportunities for the Runyon warmth and humor. Still watchable thanks to Matthau and villain Tony Curtis, but what should have been a sure winner finishes out of the money.",980640000,10,843,4.943661971830986
213844,4,6300181898,"I like this movie a lot.  It is sweet to see how the crusty old bookie begins to care for the child.  Although this movie is predictable, it is entertaining.  It is one that the whole family can watch together. I  especially like the scene where Sorrowful reads ""the kid"" the  race results for a bed time story.",954115200,7,311,4.293103448275862
213875,5,6300181898,"I bought this for my Dad because this was ""our movie"" when I was a little girl. I used to look just like the little girl, so it reminds him of me. I was thrilled this was on DVD and he was super touched to receive this gift. This is a sweet movie and you gotta love Walter Mathieu!",1390089600,,281,3.7796610169491527
213876,3,6300181898,"This movie rates 10 out of 5 stars. The write-up on Amazon said no special features. You wouldn't expect that would mean no menu, no chapters, no subtitles. Another reviewer said about the same thing but since I had seen the movie before I didn't read the reviews until just now!",1379116800,,279,4.490196078431373

213880,4,6300181898,"This is by far the best version of this story ever filmed.  The original one in the 1930s was a vehicle for Shirley Temple, the second for Bob Hope.  In this rendition, Walter Matthau was the center of attention, and he performed his usual first-rate hardnosed comic role in superb fashion.  The little girl (Miss Marker) was well cast and so were Tony Curtis and Bob Newhart.",1336003200,,376,4.582089552238806
