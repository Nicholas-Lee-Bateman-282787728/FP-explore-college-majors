8317538,4,B001L7TE5S,"This endearing romantic comedy, ""Nos 18 ans"" (known in English, to the extent that it is at all, as ""School's out""), has a lot of charm, obviously for young audiences. It is so well conceived (as based on a prior Italian movie), written, directed, and acted, with superior camera work, that more mature audiences, too, who surely will forgive these youths their coltish indiscretions, will enjoy it as well.

The story, set in France but, refreshingly, not in Paris, centres upon Lucas (played by Tho Frilet, a lad of lushly beautiful good looks) who insults and cusses out his professor, dour, strict, seemingly humourless Monsieur Martineau, on the last day of school, only to find out that he is going to have to face oral exams with none other, unexpectedly, than Prof. Martineau himself! Not surprisingly, gloom ensues in Lucas' mind.

It gives away nothing, since this turn of circumstances is mentioned on the DVD container's very container and is obvious early on in the movie, that the girl with whom Lucas falls hopelessly and deliriously in love is none other than Prof. Martieau's very attractive daughter, Clmence, a role taken by Valentine Catzflis, who rather resembles the young Brooke Shields, but who really is prettier and more personable than that. The professor realises the boy's predicament much sooner than Lucas does, which makes for some wryly amusing scenes between the two. At film's end, Lucas, Prof. Martineau, and Clmence come out happily reunited and reconciled with the young pair's prospects (and Lucas passes his oral ordeal).

There are other youthful couples, too, whose frisky adventures figure into this delightful motion picture. Arthur Dupont plays the part of Maxime, one of Lucas' school mates. Maxime is a handsome young dude with more sex drive even than the other teenage males among Lucas' friends, one who has one wonderfully comic turn following upon another. The brashly saucy lad's raging hormones propel him not only into impregnating his girlfriend, but also into having a torrid affair, as well, with her underage sister. Maxime is all importuningly sad-beagle-puppy-dog-faced contrition, to hilariously heart-tugging effect, as he pleads with, and at last wins the pardon of, the sister of his own age. Dupont, the highly gifted actor who assumes that role, making the most of every comical opportunity which it affords, is perhaps more famous for having played the seductively good-looking but scandalously perverse bisexual rock musician who mixes things up to violent effect in a more celebrated film, ""One to Another"". Here in ""Nos 18 ans"", Dupont delivers first class comic acting, fully realising Maxime's capacity to amuse the viewer and also to excite sympathy for the young man's plight.

The dialogue is in French, with English subtitles. ""Nos 18 ans"" (T.V.A. Films TVA-00533 being the edition viewed) is one youth culture film (French youth culture, all to the better!) which should appeal to a wide and varied audience.",1413504000,,2986,5.150515463917526
