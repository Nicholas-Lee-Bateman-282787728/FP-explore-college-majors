More for train buffs than for travel information, though I got a few bits of information from it to help me understand some of the rail lines in the UK.  Also, I thought it would show scenery looking out the window of the various train routes, but no, the camera shot was always of the train gliding through the countryside!  Now I have to figure out who to give it to... it is aimed to please older men who are fascinated by trains, old trains, steam trains, and the wonderful men who keep the old steam trains running.",1433289600,,554,4.3076923076923075
8297035,4,B001E7MMIQ,"Appears to be older technology but is great scenery.  Not the same as the steam train travels in the U.S., but these are not in the U.S.  Lovely.",1255478400,,145,4.142857142857143
8297036,5,B001E7MMIQ,"Trains, towns, tourism. Made in the nineties, each hour-long episode in this series was a perfectly blended cocktail. For the train buff, technical details about the equipment that didn't bore the rest of us; great chunks of scenery; geography and history lessons and visits to English Heritage and National Trust sites and other attractions. One experiences a cozy feel for each town or village explored. Hopefully more episodes in this excellent series will be forthcoming on DVD. (I bought the boxed set, but each two-hour disc [two episodes] is available separately.)",1242086400,7,571,5.285714285714286
