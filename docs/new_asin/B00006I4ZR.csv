1762396,1,B00006I4ZR,"This DVD set is just plain awful.

Obscure, bottom-of-the-sewer episodes replete with authentic 1950s television broadcast quality.

Avoid this purchase like the plague.",1101340800,69,169,6.304347826086956
1762397,5,B00006I4ZR,"There are plenty of DVDs out on the market today with episodes of television shows from the 1950s and 1960s that have fallen into the ""public domain.""  Many of them are cheaply put together and, visually, look it.  Not so with releases from the Falcon Picture Group.  By and large, their releases look better than the vast majority of DVDs with older television shows.  The reason for this is that they have done digital restoration of the prints included on this set.
What I like about this DVD is the great variety of shows included.  Yes, some of the shows, like Dragnet, the Lone Ranger, Red Skelton, etc., are available on other DVDs, but they have also included some shows like Racket Squad, Mr. & Mrs. North, and Sea Hunt that are either rarely or never seen on video/DVD.  I hadn't seen Sea Hunt since its syndication run in the 1960s.  What a great show and, to the best of my knowledge, this is the only episode available anywhere on DVD (wish there were more episodes of Sea Hunt on DVD).
While this disk is more of a ""potpourri"" of different types of television shows from the 1950s, Falcon also offers three other DVDs, including ones with television Detectives, Westerns, and Comedies.  If you are nostalgic for this great era in television, these DVDs are the way to go.  Highly recommended!",1060732800,136,1306,4.619047619047619
1762398,4,B00006I4ZR,"If you're a connoisseur of the golden age of television comedy, you'll find this DVD collection to be an overall satisfying experience.  In not including the Honeymooners or I Love Lucy, one could call it the best of the rest.  The Jack Benny Program showcases the talent and personality of Liberace while Jack hams it up with the violin.  The Burns and Allen Show highlights the underrated comedic genius of Grace Allen as she verbally spars with the tax man.  The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet won't give you any belly aches as Ozzie goes on a diet, but it best reflect the naivet and idealized 1950s notion of the perfect American family.  The Red Skelton Show proves that comedy is high art as Red plays a diploma mill trained dentist.  Eight other shows round out the collection.  Some interesting things to watch for include a no laugh track sitcom (Beulah), a young Betty White (Life with Elizabeth), and almost all of the shows include some interesting sponsor advertising, mainly from Cigarette companies.  If you don't know already know, Television of the 1950s was saturated with Cigarette ads from competing brands and the insidiousness of cigarette pitchmen knew no bounds.  Watch as the man's man John Wayne relaxes on set with a cigarette after performing physically demanding fight scenes - if only he knew.",1053907200,77,1325,4.879464285714286
1762399,5,B00006I4ZR,"I've come to enjoy the Western genre relatively late (as a kid I thought they were dull, and the number declined through the 60's so I had little chance to develop a taste for them when I became a movie fan in my teens.  I can't pretend to be an expert, just a viewer.
With that said, I do recommend this collection.  It offers a variety of approaches, from the grim ""Tate"" (written by ""Dirty Harry"" creator Harry Julian Fink) to the charming situation comedy of a ""Death Valley Days"" episode (written by series creaor Ruth C. Woodman).  By checking through the Internet Movie Database, I found that many of the writers and directors had long lists of film credits, so this collection is somewhat like a compilation of short ""B"" western features.
Something else I gleaned from the IMDB...many of these shows are much-beloved, yet have been unavailable in syndication or on pre-recorded tape for many years, so the collection is a valuable introduction to shows that are rare at present.  The purchase of this boxed-set is a vote in favor of the re-release of more of these classic programs.
Contents: one half-hour episode each, of:
The Lone Ranger, Bat Masterson, The Cisco Kid, The Roy Rogers Show, Death Valley Days, Sky King, Tate, Sgt. Preston of the Yukon, Judge Roy Bean, Fury, The Adventures of Jim Bowie, and Annie Oakley.",1038355200,96,1331,4.724137931034483

7969068,3,B00006I4ZR,"This was a little disappointing. A lot of the shows were in bad shape, muffled sound, not really restored. Interesting to see some of the shows I've only heard of. I did especially enjoy the Burns and Allen show. ""Our Miss Brooks"" was good also. I guess not every old show can be as good as ""I Love Lucy"".",1377561600,,305,4.186440677966102

Either way, it's great to have an example of these beloved shows.",1375401600,,359,4.393939393939394

7969071,4,B00006I4ZR,"I loved loved loved these three DVD's.  Why four stars instead of five?  I would have liked to be able to purchase individual DVD's, each featuring a different Western personality, with more episodes of each show.  My very favorites?  Roy Rogers; followed by the Lone Ranger (and his wonder horse, Silver), and the Cisco Kid; Fury, Annie Oakley, and Sergeant Preston of the Yukon.  I did not care for the other six, hence the four-star rating.  The digital restoration made the episodes crystal clear.  I definitely would recommend this set, but I would suggest looking for individual sets featuring just the programs you like best.  Happy Trails!",1311552000,,647,4.981308411214953
7969072,4,B00006I4ZR,"If you're a fan of early television, then this nostalgic trip down TV lane will give you much pleasure.  This is black and white TV at its best:  Joe Friday's great staccato style reminding interviewees of the importance of ""just the facts, ma'am"".  And Lloyd Bridges in a wet suit is a long career away from Mandlebaum on Seinfeld!  So, if you're a war baby wishing to reminisce or you just want to see what television was like in its infancy, this is a good primer.",1266105600,4,467,4.395348837209302

7969074,3,B00006I4ZR,The transfers are professional and good looking all the way. The selection of episodes is very good as well. My only beef that you should get more episodes for the money. These 12 episodes cost more than the whole 5th season of 'Make Room For Daddy' (6 Discs 33 episodes). Why not put 3 episodes of each show on? It would seem a better deal then and I'm sure I would have given 5 stars.,1176940800,14,386,4.16
