3479688,3,B001B1UO8K,"I will probably say the same think about all of the Goosebumps I order.  They are just not that scary to my kids.  Years ago they were fun for my kids, but now they are just cheesy.  I am sad to report this because my kids and I have always enjoyed the Goosebumps books and videos.",1385683200,,281,3.982142857142857
3479689,5,B001B1UO8K,"It was a strangely beautiful, somewhat children-rated Goosebumps series. It had Monster Blood Part 1 & 2, How to Kill a Monster, and so on.",1384732800,,139,4.6
3479690,4,B001B1UO8K,"Here is another Goosebumps DVD release. This time we get Monster Blood 1 (1996), More Monster Blood (1996), How To Kill a Monster (1996) and The Girl Who Cried Monster (1996).

Both the Monster Blood episodes chronicles the adventures of Evan as he encounters the mysterious green, slimy Monster Blood at his Aunt Kathryn's house and on a plane.

Gretchen and Clark are visiting their strange grandparents in How to Kill a Monster. They are warned not to go upstairs, but being kids, they don't listen and they end up unleashing a monster.

Lucy is a storyteller, especially stories about monsters, but when she encounters a real monster, the school's librarian Mr. Mortman, no one believes her as they think it is just one of her stories.

These Goosebumps episodes have low-budget special effects, bad acting, and a cut-down scripts based on the books by R.L. Stine.

They're not perfect, but most kids and some adults will enjoy the B-Movie quality of it.",1345939200,6,958,4.852760736196319
3479691,3,B001B1UO8K,This books are so great and keep on through the generations.  I wish the DVD's were as good as RL Stine wrote them...but in any case the kiddo's still dig 'em.,1344297600,,159,4.129032258064516
3479692,3,B001B1UO8K,"GOOSEBUMPS: MONSTER BLOOD contains four episodes from the GOOSEBUMPS tv show.

""Monster Blood"" - A boy named is Evan is sent to stay with his creepy great aunt Catherine for several days as his parents get their new house settled in Atlanta, Georgia. Catherine gives Evan a free reign of her house, except for one particular room. She warns him that he must never go into the room. Of course, before Evan's even settled into his own room he sneaks into the danger room. Evan after being caught, Evan later sneaks into the room with his new friend, Andy. Together they open up a glass jar labeled ""Monster Blood"" that contains a small amount of a goopy, green liquid. The Monster Blood starts growing at an exponential rate and begins devouring everything that it comes in contact.

""More Monster Blood"" - This episode is actually the continuation of the previous episode. The Monster Blood has been contained and Evan is on a flight to reunite with his parents. However, a small amount of Monster Blood stowed away in Evan's suitcase and begins wreaking havoc on the plane. Instead of snakes on a plane, it's monster blood on a plane.

""How to Kill a Monster"" - New step-siblings Gretchan and Clark are dropped off at Gretchan's grandparents in the middle of nowhere while their parents look for a new house in Atlanta. The kids spy Grandpa and Grandma sneaking around in a room upstairs and off course, they have to check it out, even after being told the room is off limits. Well, it turns out the room contains a horrible swamp monster that begins chasing the kids around once the grandparents have left to go into town. The ending is a nod of the head to WAR OF THE WORLDS as the kids defeat the creature in the most unlikely way. Of course, like most Goosebumps stories, there's another twist at the very end of the episode.

""The Girl Who Cried Monster"" - This is one of the better known of the Goosebumps tv shows. It stays rather close to book. Lucy Dark is constantly tormenting her brother with monster stories. One night while at the library after hours, Lucy discovers that the librarian really is a monster. She tells her parents and her best friend, but no one will believe her. The librarian discovers Lucy knows his secret and begins hunting her for his next meal. Lucy is able to avoid his grasp, but then his parents invite him to dinner.

Of the four episodes on the DVD, ""The Girl Who Cried Monster"" is by far the best episode. ""How to Kill a Monster"" isn't as good, but it's not too bad, either. The ""Monster Blood"" episodes could have been rather frightening, but they go for the laughs instead of the scares (especially ""More Monster Blood"").

Unless you are a major Goosebumps fan, I'd recommend renting this DVD first to see if you like it enough to buy it.",1327276800,2,2782,4.554

8281392,4,B001B1UO8K,"A collection of 4 of R.L Stine's best monster episodes. You get Monster Blood 1&2 as well as How to Kill a Monster & The Girl Who Criex Monster. The monster blood starts in the swamp where a kid finds a thing of jarred or canned monster blood. Well a monster forms and the kid tries to get eid of it,but in part 2 it makes it onto an airplane where it is after the kids. How to Kll a Monster is weird that one takes place in Louisiana and these kids forgetful grandparents who are also scientists to a degree don't mention the monster in the attic. Girl Who Cried Monster is a girl who sees a teacher eating bugs and mutate to a monster. Then the monster shows up for dinner at the girls house and gets eaten by her parents. Oldschool show for people who grew up with it & have kids or like to reminisce every autumn",1423699200,2,816,4.074534161490683
8281393,4,B001B1UO8K,"this dvd comes with a total of 4 eps. the first one is monster blood, its more interesting than spooky. the twist at the end wasn't really done well cuz of the bad acting from the witch woman and low budget cgi but still pretty interesting to watch.  the 2nd is more monster blood, which fox kids created not an adaption of the goosebumps books. this one is a bite more frightening cuz the monster blood comes back bigger than ever, eating people on a moving plane.  the 3rd is how to kill a monster and its a pretty fun and spooky ep. 2 kids r locked in a house while a monster chases them and they try to kill it. the acting is pretty good, the monster well it is kinda scary depending on how good ur imagination is and how old ur kids r, but to a grown person ur like its just a guy wearing a huge rubber monster suit, but still this suit is better than most goosebumps monsters. the last one is the girl who cried monster. its a pretty fun and creepy ep. the twist at the end is a classic rl stine twist but the ending is kinda cheesy for a low budget show but still cool all and all.",1414886400,2,1088,4.009216589861751
