4102049,4,B003ADOI0W,"There are so many WWII stories but this short film shows that tolerance of differences in religion can prevail over evil.  From the Danish royalty to the common fisherman and farmers, the Danes never saw the Jews as a probem or an issue.  They were Danish citizens worthy of protection and they did just that in the face of difficult circumstances.  In so doing the vast majority of Danish Jews survived.  The film does a good job with this topic.  The technical quality is not the best.",1368489600,,487,4.551724137931035

4102051,5,B003ADOI0W,"I loved this documentary because it shows how the Danes treated their fellow Danes...those who were Jewish....when the Nazis invaded Denmark during WWII. Unlike many, not all, citizens of other invaded countries, the Danes not only protected their Jewish countrymen as much as and whenever possible, but also hid them and helped them flee.

One cannot say enough good things about the Danes.  In fact, when exiled Jews returned to their homes in Denmark, they found that their neighbors had fed their pets, watered their plants, and otherwise looked after their property, something that certainly did not occur in other Eastern European countries..",1361664000,9,648,5.281553398058253

DANISH COMPLICITY IN THE HOLOCAUST: DANES MURDERED JEWS

SALIENT FACTS IN GARRISON KEILLOR'S The Danish Solution

This hour-long DVD captures all of the essential background factors that made the rescue of Danish Jews (wartime survivorship of 95%) possible: The mildness of the German occupation of Denmark, the warning in advance from the German Duckwitz about the impending mass German arrests of Jews, the Germans not searching Danish hospitals in which many Jews gathered and hid, the questionably dutiful conduct of German leader Werner Best, the decision by Adolf Eichmann to ship captured Danish Jews to Theresienstadt and not henceforth to any death camp, the behavior of ordinary Germans (having leads from Danish collaborators) often not breaking down the doors of Jewish homes when no one answered, German patrol boats--for some reason--taken out for ""painting"" (most accounts say ""for repairs"") during much of October 1943, etc.

CONSIDERABLE DANISH AUTONOMY UNDER THE NAZI GERMAN OCCUPATION

The fact that the Danish administration retained its power under the German occupation is mentioned, as well as the untruth of the Danish King wearing the Jewish Star. The viewer learns that Danish fishermen required money to ship the Jews to Sweden, and that they had weeks to do it--never encountering serious German interference. One of the interviewed Danish Underground members mentions that there was a German death penalty for aiding Jews in Holland, but not in Denmark. [Actually, the German death penalty in Holland was sporadically enforced; In German-occupied Poland it was almost certain for a caught rescuer of Jews.]

Of course, there is much more to the deliverance of Danish Jews than this documentary can show. See the Peczkis Listmania: THE WWII RESCUE OF DANISH JEWS IN FACT AND IN MYTH.",1346976000,5,2206,5.832298136645963
4102054,5,B003ADOI0W,"I have always been deeply struck by the courage of the Danish people, who refused to give up their Jewish citizens to the Nazis during World War Two. The Danes for the most part considered the Jewish citizens of Denmark as their countrymen first and Jews second, unlike many of their European counterparts. The Jews in Denmark were also highly assimilated into Danish society, once again unlike their counterparts in other European nations. This documentary which was completed in 2003 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Denmark's rescue of its Jews tells the story of how the Danes went to extraordinary lengths to save their Jews. It is truly an amazing occurrence in the history of World War Two, and certainly unique. The documentary also portrays individuals involved in the rescue efforts and explores how this event occurred and why Denmark was the only country to execute such a widespread rescue effort of its Jews.

Narrated by Garrison Keillor, the documentary highlights certain individuals and their roles or memories about the period such as Max Asernikow, Jytte Bornstein, Nils Koppel, Gustav Goldberger (all Jews), several Danes who were actively involved in the rescue effort such as Jorgen Kieler and many more. Further insights are provided by historians Therkel Straede and Sofie Bak.

The documentary runs about 58 minutes, and is in English and Danish with subtitle options in both. Archival footage (e.g. photographs) is included as well as more recent color footage. There is much to be gleaned here - though this event happened decades ago, it has many implications for history and humanity, especially in considering the role of ordinary citizens standing up for justice even in the face of a great power such as the Third Reich.

4102058,5,B003ADOI0W,"How was it that Denmark managed to secretly hide and rescue almost all Jewish Danes in October 1943 in response to a planned raid by the German occupation?  This vivid and highly-recommended documentary answers in the words of the participants themselves and with the familiar narrative voice of Garrison Keillor, the celebrated host of A Prairie Home Companion on National Public Radio.

A nurse describes hiding a family of four in one room of her apartment until they could board a boat to Sweden.  A resistance member describes facing off an armed German patrol at the debarkation point.  The son of Copenhagen's cantor describes how his family boarded a fishing boat in the dark to cross to Sweden.  That these recollections are given in an understated manner gives them added power.  Without over-idealizing real people, the film is inspiring to anyone concerned about courage and decency under duress.

A brilliant U.S.-Danish co-production, the film was developed with input from eminent scholars such as Therkel Straede and Leni Yahil.  Its brief black and white archival film-clips of Hitler's mass meetings, racist rants, and military aggression are made more tolerable by Keillor's reassuringly measured narration.  Although they were largely frustrated, German police reports itemizing planned deportation actions are shown as dryly as in a police procedural.  People calmly describing events that tested them to the limit are photographed in backgrounds of warmly glowing color. As cinema, the film might have particular interest for those who appreciate Danish or World-War-II themed movies. As fact, it provides a much-needed reminder of how good people acting together--without making excuses--can face and overcome the forces of destruction.",1268006400,27,1759,5.4575645756457565
4102059,5,B003ADOI0W,"It's part of our world history. I never knew about how the Danish Jews were treated during WWII and how they survived. I ran the gamut of emotions happy, sad, and finally resolve that this is just another curiosity that the brutal, egomaniac, anti-Semitic, killer named Adolph Hitler was able to pull of and people accepted it to get along and not have a confrontation. When you think about it this is what amazes me that a paper hanger with grandiose delusions was able to almost conquer Europe and kill millions of people with the world watching.",1424390400,,548,4.65979381443299
4102060,5,B003ADOI0W,"I just finished watching this. I knew much of the story but the individual descriptions and details were often new to me and were all moving. While there were collaborators in Denmark, the vast majority of citizens participated in collusion of a different sort- collusion with the Resistance. Police officers drove Jews in patrol cars to safe houses, and their superiors didn't say a word. Doctors booked Jewish patients with nowhere else to turn into hospital, and the nurses painted their faces to make them look sick. A local church snuck out the synagogue's Torah scrolls and hid them safely in the church catacombs until the end of the war, when they were returned. Politicians insisted that all Danish citizens be treated alike, and when that later failed, managed to secure special treatment for Danish Jews who were arrested- they were held in a ghetto rather than transported to the death camps, and allowed to receive packages of food from the Danish Red Cross and letters. Later they were actually driven in buses from Czechoslovakia across Germany, put on trains across Denmark, and allowed to sail to Sweden. (Sweden remained neutral, but also opened their borders to the Danish Jews- broadcasting every hour that Sweden would accept Jewish refugees, and Swedish fishermen assisted the Danish fishermen in ferrying Jews to safety and welcomed them as they landed.) This story is as important, to me, as remembering the stories of the death camps and the people who knew but did not say anything to fight or stop it. If the majority of a people rise up to fight an evil, they have a chance against it. Over 95% of Denmark's Jews survived the war, mostly safe in Sweden. When the war was over they were welcomed back by cheering crowds. Let's remember this- if we stand for good against evil, if we refuse to give in to fear and propaganda, we have a chance to make a difference.

Highly recommend this program. It is appropriate for children old enough to understand what happened in the Holocaust, too, no graphic descriptions or depictions of violence. (Some mentions of death, because, Holocaust.)",1422662400,,2112,4.883008356545961

4102063,5,B003ADOI0W,"The Danes were as prejudiced towards Jews as other Europeans.  But acting on their prejudice is where they drew the line.  Jews were not Christians, but neither were they foreigners.  Nor were they less than fellow human beings.  When the Danes were faced with being accomplices to murder, it did not matter if it was about Jews or Gentiles, the answer was, No.

Imagine the Danes, small in number but great in stature, part of Hitler's master race, facing down the Nazis with righteousness on their side -- no hostility, just a quiet refusal.  Resident Nazis were not immune to the spell.  Before the deportations could be carried out, the German military governor Werner Best is said to have given the Danes a heads-up, allowing Jews to be evacuated to Sweden.

Also deserving mention are the Bulgarians, who, like the Danes, refused to collaborate with the Germans in the Final Solution.  Some Bulgarian statesmen were murdered by the Germans for this.",1418860800,5,955,4.881987577639752

This film tells that story very well, and it's a valuable document now that those days are passing from living memory. My only criticism: the film seems to equate the Danish government with Danish resistance and implies that the latter didn't begin until 1943, when the government (which officially cooperated with the Germans) resigned. In fact, organized civilian resistance began within hours of the German invasion in April 1940 and grew steadily through the war. By 1943 it was able to pull off the rescue of more than 7,000 Danish Jews. Only a handful went to the camps. The resistance is a great story in itself.

4102084,5,B003ADOI0W,"The nightmare years of anti-Semitism remain but this is a tribute to all of those who sought to protect. Interesting that the Scandinavian Jew did not suffer the extremes of Nazism.  If one knows about the obsession of Hitler and the myth of the 'Arian Race,' this all becomes more understandable. Denmark had a well assimilated Jewish population combined with refuges of more recent persecution. Unlike Middle Europe, there had been no real prejudice in their history. This video allows one to follow multiple avenues of 'The Jewish Question.' There are references to the concentration camps, to traitors and those who choose to offer refuge and protection.  For a timeline in world history, we can find those who choose to be the 'best' that one can expect instead of the 'worst.' This offers a glimpse of honor and respect  for human dignity. Video and audio combine with interviews for a way to realize what 'could have been' as opposed to 'what was.' Easy to follow, accurate and a video that brings the 'light of knowledge' into the darkness of Nazism. This video is a 'good reminder' of all that is 'genocide.'

Not surprisingly, most historical video in this film is stock footage of Nazis marching, planes flying, etc., with little that relates directly to the story. There are several interviews with survivors or those who helped save them, now in their eighties; but despite the inherent drama of their stories, their words soon become ponderous and repetitive, a problem made worse by the editing, which leaves parts of the stories unclear or confusing.

This is a worthy, even noble, effort to tell a story that must be told. Had the video team written a book, I would doubtless be praising it now.
