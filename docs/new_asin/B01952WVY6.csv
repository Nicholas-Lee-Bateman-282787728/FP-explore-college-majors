7562822,5,B01952WVY6,Very informative info re  Hudson River School Painters from NY State . So I think it's well worth watching. Each important painter is highlighted and lots of painting photos and history of these amazing artists. Inspiring for any artist or student of art history.,1473552000,2,263,4.9772727272727275

7562824,5,B01952WVY6,"After seeing the Hudson River School documentary on PBS, i immediately ordered a copy of this DVD.  This is a beautifully textured historical account of  the Hudson River School painters and the unique and powerful artistic movement they created.  Whether you are new to the work of these artists or a long time fan,  this DVD will provide an insight into the principal figures and truly demonstrate the depth of their genius... an excellent work by creator Vin Tabone!!",1457222400,11,470,4.9113924050632916
7562825,5,B01952WVY6,"Just watched the DVD last night and am looking forward to Part 2..  I am an admirer of the Hudson River, but knew nothing about these great artists who were so  inspired by the beauty of the Hudson that they created some of the finest American paintings of the 19th century..  For a novice like me, this was great..  Beautiful art, beautiful scenery, well presented, informative and a real treat..  Can't wait for Part 2..  Just beautiful..",1456272000,3,440,4.64935064935065

8743962,1,B01952WVY6,"This documentary is like taking the most boring tour possible. The narrator is so contrived and the info is not interesting. It felt almost as if I was watching a documentary that was made in house at a museum to accompany an exhibit, and for that purpose only. I really wish Amazon would get better educational films on art. I have only seen a handful of good ones and most are BBC.",1495843200,2,383,4.333333333333333

8743965,3,B01952WVY6,"I love the Hudson River School artists, and imagine my delight to find a new documentary celebrating their accomplishments.  The film footage is generally of high quality, the interviewees insightful about the artistic achievements of the five painters highlighted.  But oh, for shame, how the narrator is way over the top.  The narration itself is overwrought, while the narrator feels the need to play up every single word.  I feel like I am trapped in an infomercial.",1487808000,2,470,5.064935064935065
