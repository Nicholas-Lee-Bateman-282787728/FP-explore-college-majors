8507828,5,B000BGR0ME,"This series isn't too bad, for what it is.  If you're a manga fan you'll probably love it.  Looks to be taken directly from the pages of one, in its animation at least.  Lots of exclamations and short scenes you'd typically find in a manga.  Overall, if you like something like Azumanga Daioh, you'll probably like this.  Has many of the same Eng. Voice actors from the My Hime/My Otome series.  I give it a 5/5, as long as i'm not comparing it to more recently released stuff.",1238112000,,477,4.363636363636363
