8433251,4,B004KO1OQQ,"Book of Ruth was not quite the movie I was expecting.  Peggy Wood starred in the picture, but the same leading lady.  I really liked the other version which starts in Moed and her husband is killed and Ruth and Peggy Wood leave for Wood's homeland where she is seen talking to a prophet, etc.  The ending is the best part when it is announced that Boaz and Ruth have a son who is the father of David.  THAT IS THE VERSION OF THE STORY I WANTED.  Home Beyond the Sun was very good.  I liked it very much.",1409356800,,503,4.03030303030303
8433252,5,B004KO1OQQ,"I had seen a portion of this movie on TCT and thought that it would be a good movie to own.  I am glad that I made the purchase, my whole family enjoyed this film, granted, it was not like a high budget film, but enjoyable none the less.  Stuck pretty close to scripture.",1341100800,,271,4.0
