3964589,4,B002PJ8290,"Somewhat boring in format. But scaled so that beginners as well as advanced dancers can gain benefit from it. It is very much for an egyptian caberet dancer, but I still got a lot of use out of it as a tribal fusion dancer. She teaches well, nice angles on the camera shots to give you maximum view of what she is doing and she explains arms legs and torso movement with care and separetly so that it is easy to learn.",1257379200,4,418,4.109756097560975
3964590,5,B002PJ8290,"This DVD was so much more than I expected.  For some reason, I really thought it would be about combinations that you could use while improvising or choreographing, or about building your own combinations.  It was about so much more, almost every aspect of performance.  The DVD would be great for any level of dancer, and should definitely be part of any performer's library.

The tips & tricks section was great, with Bahaia sharing her top tips for dance creation.  She shared some concepts that were new for me, as well as some that I consider very important.  I actually wanted to take notes.  Also, Bahaia seems very comfortable on screen, and has a great speaking voice.

Bahaia covers some of the same ground as Improvisation Toolkit I.  As in Nadira Jamal's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Improvisation-Toolkit-Volume-1-Movement-Recall/dp/B001NMT8FW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Improvisation Toolkit Volume 1: Movement Recall</a>, Bahaia recommends  making a list of your repertoire and categorizing those moves.  She also talks about how to take your signature step (or any step really), and adding dynamics to it to vary it - doing it stationary, to different directions, changing the timing, level changes, and layering.  These sections are great for improving one's improvisational skills.

Bahaia put a big emphasis on walks, those filler steps that can be presented between movements.  Beyond explaining their purpose, she taught three types of walks, including the arabesque.  Her explanation of foot placement on the arabesque was incredibly useful.  Her arabesque is grounded and will prevent knee injury or loss of balance.

This DVD also covered many other topics, such as planning for transitions, understanding weight changes, and structuring your dance for maximum impact and interest.  Most of the topics had an exercise, where the viewer was encouraged to try out the concept, often using her own imagination.

I enjoyed the segment on Repetition and Sequence, which talked about how to identify patterns in the music and reflect them in dance.  However, the exercises didn't necessary match with the patterns.  For example, one exercise was done with a drum solo.  The 8 8 4 4 2 2 2 2 was not matched by the drum riffs in that drum solo.  In the next exercise, the AABA pattern was shown in movement, but did not reflect an AABA pattern in the music.  I was minorly disappointed in this  because I was looking forward to seeing it applied to the music as well as the movement, since that is how it was taught in the lecture portion.

Finally the DVD actually did present some combinations.  My favorite was the first travelling combination.  Bahaia uses it in the performance, so you can see how it would be used for a real show.  It does indeed have the BIG effect even though it is quite easy to do. I don't typically take notes on combinations, but I took notes on that one and tried it out to some of my music - though it worked perfectly with Daret Al Ayam.  Each combination illustrated a concept, such as unexpected directional change, body lines, transitions, or expanding across the stage.

I really enjoyed the performance presented at the end.  It demonstrated the principles that she taught, and it was a good exercise to review those principles in your head as you observed Bahaia.

Bahaia has quickly become one of my favorite dancers, both as an instructor and a performer.",1257120000,12,3457,5.105169340463458
3964591,5,B002PJ8290,"I was highly impressed with this DVD. It is well organized and easy to follow. She gave you tips and tricks, talked about importance of body lines, transitions, how to find your signature step, floor patterns, arm movements, walking, variations, poses, patterns, and 6 different combinations. All the information was very useful and I highly recommend this DVD and all the Cheeky Girls videos.",1255737600,4,393,5.15625
3964592,5,B002PJ8290,"Wow, I knew when I first saw the video trailer for this DVD it would be Great.  However, it far exceeded my expectations.  If you've ever admired Bahaia's dance style then I'm confident you will find this dvd a tool that you'll come back to time and again.  Not only will you glean some of her beautiful traveling steps, but you will also be equipped with the tools you need to create your own unique dance style for all occasions.

8377045,4,B002PJ8290,nice CD in good condition,1425859200,,25,4.2
8377046,5,B002PJ8290,This is one of my favorite Bellydance videos. I had never heard of Bahaia before and now think she is just wonderful - as a dancer and an instructor. She makes concepts easy and reachable with simple explainations for good dancing.,1361750400,,231,4.658536585365853
8377047,5,B002PJ8290,I love this DVD. Bahaia takes the sometimes complicated process of developing choreography and gives us simple ways to add variety and excitement while allowing for truly dancing in the moment. She has great advice for overcoming stumbling blocks during improvisation that I found really simple. I highly recommend this video to beginners as well as advanced dancers. Some very useful information here.,1360886400,,402,5.396825396825397
8377048,5,B002PJ8290,"This DVD offers solid principals and sound advice on how to improve one's improvisational belly dancing choreography.  I found this very helpful because improvising in cabaret style is my weakest area.  Bahaia is very pleasant and her easy to follow instruction made me feel successful.  That success kept me want to see what came next.  Other DVD's I have bought leave me with a frustrated pointing out that I need to dedicate hours I don't have or study intensive yoga in order to execute the moves correctly.  The instructor is cute and joyful in her dance and her attitude made me feel like dancing and having fun too.  Just what I needed.  I particularly enjoyed her performance where she drops her veil in the unintended spot and teaches us how to relax, not freak out and work with it.  Thank you!",1289347200,,804,4.652482269503546
8377049,5,B002PJ8290,"Got this dvd based on the reviews on Amazon, the content is for beginners/intermediate levels. But what made me write this review was its production quality:

- Bahai's presentation skills are superb, she speaks beautifully and explains the material well and nicely organized.
- The setting is neat with no visual distraction, especially when she displays the moves in front of a mirror.
- The camera work is the best I have seen for belly dance dvds: it is steady,  appropriately focused and you get to see her moves clearly & head-to-toe where needed.
-No distracting/loud background music, even when the menu goes to the next section.

On the whole, an example of how an instructional dvd should be.  At this price, a bargain for the quantity & quality of its content.",1278979200,,771,4.818181818181818
8377050,4,B002PJ8290,"This is a great video to add to your belly dance instructional video library.  I recommend it for students with at least a few years of basic belly dance instruction and ready to graduate to a more intermediate level.  This is like an encyclopedia of information and covers areas class instructors may miss or avoid.  It breaks down into sections that are all important for dancers wanting to break out and begin doing solo, or those that have been doing solo work and want to improve or expand on their repertoire.  The most important agenda for my purchasing this video was to improve travelling moves and transitions.  I used a travel combination from the video in a solo dance just two weeks before I was to perform.  Bahaia will show you a technique and combination slowly and articulately.  Then you have an opportunity to practice with her in repetition, also good for practicing arms.  Some combos are challenging but are worth working on.  There are also sections in the first part of the video where Bahaia will show you something, you get to practice with her and then the music plays with a screen saver image so you can try and practice new moves on your own without copying the instructor you see on the video.  This would be improvisational section.  It's a long DVD, I haven't done the entire thing, but I've already gotten value out of it.  Great for new solo dancers and troupe combination ideas.",1272240000,,1414,4.657258064516129
8377051,5,B002PJ8290,"This is a great DVD for continuing an intermediate dancer on her way.  It offers some lovely walks to work with, ways to vary a step to add variety and interest, and some neat little combinations.  The content is definitely worth having.  Bahaia herself glows on camera, with absolute comfort in front of the camera.  She seems genuine and relaxed, creating a good learning atmosphere.  She breaks moves down so that they are very easy to understand and follow.

The menu is broken out into each section, then further breaks out into each topic.  It's a lot of subchapters, which allows you to repeat a particular section easily, or go back and find something at another time with no problem.  This DVD is a real winner.",1263513600,2,720,4.658730158730159
8377052,5,B002PJ8290,"The content offered on this DVD is very helpful and informative for dancers who wish to learn how to actually dance and perform. The explanations are lengthy, but I found the information to be very valuable and necessary to understand the concepts fully. Lots of tips on understanding your audience, how to improvise, what to do when you get ""stuck"", how to create presence and energy in your dance, etc.

Unfortunately there are a couple of chapters, that are weak on a clear visual example or commentary to help fully understand the concept being explained. For example, ""Entering & Exiting the Stage"" ...the importance of ""why"" is covered but there is no visual example, therefore, the viewer has no understanding what a great entrance or exit should look like. On the bright side, I don't think this will prevent one from getting the ""gist of it.""

As for the other chapters, they are clear and complete with visual examples, and packed with information. In particular, I thought the Art of Walking, Finding Your Signature Step, Weight Transfer, Repetition & Sequenced Movement, Body Line, and the Combinations were very well done. The information and excercises were interesting and helpful. I have been taking classes for a few years now, with no real idea how to put it all together to ""dance."" This has given me a new understanding and the tools to do it.

Overall, I would recommend this DVD, as a ""must have"" for your dance library....especially for the beginner to advanced beginner.

NOTE-It's teaching concentrates more on how to create and pull together your ""dance"". If you are looking for new combinations, try Combination Nation 1 or 2.",1262390400,6,1653,4.913978494623656
8377053,5,B002PJ8290,"I have never been disappointed with a CheekyGirls DVD, and this one was no different. Bahaia is very approachible, and easy to listen to. Her down-to-earth way of teaching makes you feel relaxed. This DVD is a non-stop barriage of helpful information, and never gets old or tiring. Some of the info I knew, some I had never heard someone put into words, so even the stuff I knew it was good to hear from a fresh perspective.
I am very very glad I bought this one.",1260489600,2,463,4.333333333333333
8377054,5,B002PJ8290,"I wish I had owned this when I first started dancing. This is a fantastic dvd for anyone who performs publicly.
Actually, it's a great dvd for anyone who dances.
Bahaia has a lovely easy and relaxed style, and just after one viewing I started to rethink again performing in public.(although that's not likely!)
Bahaia has good advice to give, some fabulous tips, and her combinations are very interesting. She covers all topics from entering and exiting the stage, getting un-stuck, your wow step, intensity of movements, awareness in movement, walks, poses, weight transfer, 21 of these plus exercises for each. Bahaia then covers repetition and sequenced movement with exercises, then follows with combinations and exercises for each combination, with performances at the end.
If you are a teacher, then this would be a must dvd, as it is not often that these subjects are covered in classes, or if they are not in such depth.
and these tips and exercises are so important if you are a performer.",1259452800,32,998,4.911242603550296
