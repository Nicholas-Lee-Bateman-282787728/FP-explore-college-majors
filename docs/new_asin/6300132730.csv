8212677,4,6300132730,"This is a good film about a hopeful, musically-inclined girl whose gifted talents are under estimated because others seek to take advantage of her in the tough, competitive entertainment world.  The main actress Monica Gayle plays an innocent country girl fan who is attractive, intelligent although somewhat naive, and intent on becoming a country music star but those attempts are constantly thwarted by manipulative and pretending admirers in the big city of Nashville. It seems almost a semi-comical show with its amount of inferred sexual exploitation that a viewer could believe might be an exaggeration, but maybe not. Jamie gets manhandled time and again but she seems to withstand the pressure with a hard optimism, and stubborn determination. She meets some new and possibly friendly people, and some well-meaning, but there is truly not any good to come of her urgent cause. Are they sincerely wanting to help her? But she's only just a lonely, simple country girl after all. The show contains some playable easy listening music that also features an appearance by 1970's country singer Johnny Rodriguez and has a nice quality resolution picture. The plot has a smooth moving yet easy to follow story that kept my interest but the show ended with an unclear and baffling ending.  This is an interesting and worthy film that is fun to watch if only just to witness actress Monica Gayle's high-spirited efforts and loveliness which will have you rooting for her even though it leads into an unknown future.  Fans of country music and mature audiences could really stay tuned to it!",1464220800,,1590,5.038022813688213

8212679,5,6300132730,"This new DVD presents the film in a beautiful print that looks even better than the film did originally at drive-in theaters back in 1976.  The colors are rich, all the better to appreciate the beautiful and talented Monica Gayle.  Monica stars as a wannabe country singer who finds that her path to success is paved with sleazy guys who just want to take advantage of her.  Monica had an unusual career, beginning in softcore  films and then progressing through some R-rated films like this one.  She finally landed in such family fare as an episode of FANTASY ISLAND on TV.

The film was originally titled NEW GIRL IN TOWN, but with the success of Robert Altman's NASHVILLE, the title was changed to NASHVILLE GIRL.  A few years later, when COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER became a hit for Sissy Spacek, this film's title was changed again, to the sound-alike COUNTRY MUSIC DAUGHTER!

There's also a Blu-ray edition of this film, but it's only available via direct mail order from Screen Archives Entertainment.",1434758400,3,1003,4.824561403508772
