5178994,4,B008R65XRO,"Four films on four DVDs at a good price.  That's the basics.  Physically, there was nothing wrong with the packaging or the discs; save the printing on the back (white on a cornflower blue background) does not make for a sharp read for those of us with eyeball trouble.  (I'm between glasses - uncomfortable!)  But let's talk movies for a bit, shall we?

""King Kong""  This is Peter Jackson's big remake after Lord of the Rings was wrapped.  Perhaps another project might have been better.  I love the original with the Ray Harryhausen stop-motion animation.  I do not love the prevalent CGI used here.  The film's open is terribly slow, as we seem to have to examine every board the ship is constructed with and the psychiatric problems evinced by all crew.  The cast is headed by Jack Black, and he's terrible.  There is not one aspect that brings any credulity to the role.  The clothes are wrong, the haircut is wrong, the language used is not 1930's - nor are Black's actions or any unnoticed attempt at perhaps a generic New York accent.  The cast simply fills space, without a standout performance nor even an adequate one.  All that time on the ship, and we only have a vague notion as to who might be who.  Then we get to Skull Island.  Nice f/x of the (useless) wall, some very grim shots of the islanders.  From there on it's standard fare, rehashing (badly) the rest of the script six writers prepared circa 1931-1932.  Really, PJ gave the world a gift in the 3-part Lord of the Rings, and it seems he is doing the same with the Hobbit.  Some people are made for special films.  Hitchcock made suspense and mysteries.  Spielberg makes blockbusters and films that are important to him.  Spike Lee has issues to be shown.  Tarantino is onto violence and obscure quotes.  Peter Jackson and his mates (in both senses) should face the music and realize there is both a cash cow and a creative bonanza in filming the works of JRR Tolkein.  It only makes sense to do perhaps a short-Story film (Farmer Giles of Ham, and maybe some tales from the Lost Works).  This is just a break, for next up would have to be ""The Silmarillion"" - which encompasses many tales.  But then he can shoot in New Zealand, and at his favorite studio in England, and wherever else he needs to be.  (Like a volcanic island to show Mordor under Morgoth; or the City of the High Elves - Gondolin.)  There are maybe twenty films there, just off the top of my head.  What we cannot do is let Mr. Jackson involve his ego and time in another bad remake.

""The Mummy"" by Stephen Somers is a modern classic, should be choose the genre horry/action/comedy.  Some very good stuff mixed in with some very corny stuff.  This film is holding up well, and kudos for the art through the credits.

""The Scorpion King"" is an offshoot of the two other Mummy movies by Somers, this one directed by Chuck Russell.  He does an okay job, but there is a bit of panache whe Somers directs that is missing here.  There are also some editing problems, and somehow I see egos clash in the cutting room.  It's a fun story with absurd situations.

""Van Helsing"" I have tried very hard to not like.  But, I can't.  It's just rather charming in a kill-all-the-monsters kind of way; and there are plenty to kill.  Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane), Frankenstein's creation (Schuler Hensley), a variety of werewolves, Igor (Kevin J. O'Conner), assistant vampires, vampire brides and a peasant population heavily armed with brooms, pitchforks, torches, tar, feathers and a lousy sense of direction and timing.  It is fun to see Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale grind it out as two fearless (?) vampire killers, ably aided by David Wenham (as a FRIAR, not a MONK! :D ) and opposed to Somers' go-to--bad-guy Carl.  There are some interesting spins on the vampire (and other) legends.  This movie does cry out for a sequel to answer some questions.  But, it's doubtful, as both stars did it for a lark.

Three out of four fun movies for me, and, hopefully, you - a whole different viewer - will enjoy the color King Kong.  For the price, you can't beat it with a stick.  A solid add to any horror collection (as long as one retains their sense of humor!)",1397088000,3,4218,4.545212765957447
