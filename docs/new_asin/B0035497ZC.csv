8388637,5,B0035497ZC,"Four Hallmark Christmas movies to ten bucks.  Even if you don't like one or two of the films (but I don't believe you will), it is still an incredible value.  Out of the Woods is a great story of a estranged grandfather and grandson reconnecting after many years apart.  Angel in the Family is a charming film about a family who's suffered the loss of their wife and mother being able to heal by reconnecting with her for a magical Christmas.  The Long Way Home is one of Jack Lemmon's final films and is a heartwarming story.  Where There's a Will is lighthearted entertainment sure to touch even the hardest of hearts.  Again, this is an incredible value and I don't think one could go wrong by purchasing it.",1319673600,5,711,4.4728682170542635

8388640,5,B0035497ZC,"I watch the movies on the hallmark network. If I like them I buy them. I buy most. TV today for me is almost unwatchable, but I love these. I also love the actors in this particular group of movies. Ed Asner,Marian Ross and others.",1298937600,,231,4.155555555555556
8388641,5,B0035497ZC,when i opened up this today there was an empty package with no dvd in it so i guess i would not recommend it for anyone if they are going to be ripped off,1294876800,3,154,3.5588235294117645
