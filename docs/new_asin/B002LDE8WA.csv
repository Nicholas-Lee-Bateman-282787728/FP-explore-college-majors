8405331,5,B002LDE8WA,Great music.  Awesome video.  Cool.  I just recently discovered these guys and have already bought 4 albums!  Mix of metal genres.  Heavy metal.  Death metal.  Great stuff.  Most lyrics in Japanese... but thats just fine.  ; ),1381536000,,226,4.891891891891892
8405332,3,B002LDE8WA,"the dvd has 13 videos, but 3 are different versions of songs already on here.
vinushka-- its a restricted version
dozing green
glass skin
agitated screams of maggots-- restricted version- meaning there's blurred out animated freaky creature sex, i'm guessing(i've never seen an unedited version)
grief
ryoujoku no ame
clever sleazoid
red soil
vinushka- promotion edit version
clever sleazoid {despair in the womb}version-
agitated screams of maggots {despair in the womb}version-
conceived sorrow {in weal or woe}version

there was some behind the scenes stuff of filming, pretty much just someone filming bits of the making of the video, no commentary on the few i checked out. the second versions of videos had live stuff.
i saw all the videos online already, so it wasn't really a great purchase for me.",1264723200,,806,5.2
