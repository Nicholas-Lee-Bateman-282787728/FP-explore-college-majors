8271215,5,B0018UZJ98,"As a Mark Twain follower I've tried to pay attention to how his work is treated by different groups and media along with whatever insiight might be possible about public attaitudes toward the characters. It's interesting that the ""American"" icon (Huckleberry) is so popular and readily recognized in Europe. An idealized boyhood set on the moving stage of a great river might explain the successful fascination, but in any case Europeans seem to do well with Huck and Tom. This is one of the better movie efforts, most of which are barely OK or should be thoroughly thrashed before being put away to be ignored and forgotten.",1355184000,3,625,4.850467289719626
8271216,5,B0018UZJ98,"This production sets out to do something unprecedented with the texts of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, something so radical it makes one's head spin. The producers have not attempted to ""improve"" the text or impose their own agenda. They haven't tried to tell the ""real"" story which Twain supposedly ""meant"" to write. Instead this series simply seeks to tell TWAIN'S story. The adaptations in this version are only those necessitated by lack of money, the need to fit everything into 26 episodes, or (in one or two very minor instances) by the need to bear in mind the likely child audience. And the result of such fidelity to the text is a STUNNING piece of television.

Little details from the novels are lovingly reproduced - from the fact that the boys are all barefoot, to Huck slinking under the bed when Aunt Polly arrives at the Phelps' residence (Ch. 42). The performances of the three leads is superb. Best of all is Ian Tracey, who beautifully embodies the laid back and gentle approach to life of Twain's Huck Finn. There is a lovely moment on the raft after Jim and Huck's argument over whether Frenchmen speak the same as everyone else. Huck turns to Jim and sort of smiles, and Jim smiles back. It's a fleeting moment but it speaks volumes about the warmth of the relationship between these two. Even the supporting characters in this production are superbly done: Sid Sawyer, Becky Thatcher, Uncle Silas, Aunt Sally, all are wonderfully and memorably portrayed.

And this is the only production besides the 1920 film to keep Twain's original ending. The rescue from Phelps Farm is brilliantly handled without departing from the text. Through some sublime acting on the part of Blu Mankuma, we are left in no doubt that Jim is going along with Tom's plans only because he doesn't want to upset him - also, no doubt, because now that Tom has arrived on the scene and is obviously firmly in charge, it might not be wise to upset him when he still needs him in order to make a successful escape. Far from losing his dignity, by going along with Tom's plans Jim displays his sensitivity, intelligence and patience. To show the whole scenario as Twain wrote it is one thing; but to show it in a manner which enhances rather diminishes Jim's stature is a massive achievement.

Never mind the production difficulties (Aunt Polly's dubbed vocals, the fact that they don't seem able to film at night, etc.). These problems pale into insignificance before what is accomplished. No other screen realisation of Twain's novels has accorded the text such respect. From the moment the gorgeously nostalgic theme tune plays at the beginning of episode 1, all the way to the last scene in episode 26, it is the LOVE of Twain's actual novels that shines through every scene in this golden series.",1348617600,5,2796,4.748971193415638
8271217,5,B0018UZJ98,"This is a wonderful series, easily the best rendition of Twain's stories that I've ever seen, ""an American Institution"" for the generation of TV viewers that grew up in the 1970s. I was all geared up to order it upon its release in N. America, when Amazon abruptly displayed the notice that it has been ""discontinued by the manufacturer."" Whatever the problem is, I sure hope they get it resolved soon!",1272067200,4,402,4.676056338028169
8271218,5,B0018UZJ98,"I saw this series on the Showtime channel in the early 1980s. It was called ""Mark Twain Theater"" when it was on Showtime.

I'm a fan of Mark Twain's novels, and I found this series to be very entertaining. I was able to see it only once as a kid when it was on 30 years ago, but I saved the Showtime guide from back then.

I am so looking forward to getting the DVD and seeing it again! The price looks good, too. I would highly recommend this series to any Tom Sawyer/Huckleberry Finn fan!",1270857600,3,490,4.09375
8271219,5,B0018UZJ98,"I adore this film:

I have watched over 50 miniseries based on classic works of British or American literature, and I have to say that this miniseries is one of my very favorite, if not my very favorite. [""Bleak House"" (2005) and ""Kidnapped"" (1978) would be its main competitors.]

This 1979 television series covers both of Mark Twain's novels about Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn (i.e. ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" and ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"").

The acting in this nearly 700 minute series is excellent. Huckleberry Finn is played by Ian Tracey. Tom Sawyer is played by Sammy Snyders. Both Ian and Sammy are wonderful actors, at least in this production. Also, the script for the production is quite good and very accurate to Twain's novels. The only somewhat major deviation occurs when the scriptwriters alter a few events and add some plot details to allow for a smooth transition between ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" and ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."" However, I would not say that this deviation detracts from the overall quality of the production.

Below is some additional information covering the episodes. Episodes 1-11 cover ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"". Episodes 14-26 cover ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."" Episodes 12-13 are transition material between Twain's two novels, especially transition material that better explores Huck's life with the Widow Douglas and Miss Watson.

Caution:
I am writing this review before the production is officially released in the U.S. Therefore, I do not know what the film transfer is like nor do I know what the DVD quality is like. Hence, I have no idea if the DVD quality of this region 1 transfer is as good as its UK region 2 release.",1263168000,5,2325,4.786967418546366
