8312311,5,B001JAHQIY,"NBC wasn;t paying attention. Season Six of Hunter features some GREAT action. I think it had the most realistic violence of any cop show ever. I was watching some of the reruns recently and I saw a few things I never saw on any other Action Show. In one episode (I beleive it is episode 21) there is a  scene of a guy slashing someone right in the face complete with realistic blood. NBC had a strict code of ""acceptable"" levels of violence but season six tried some very authentic special effects. I saw blood squibs (bullet impact shots) .that was not allowed on any other NBC show. This season was more serious and I thought well written.  Fred Dryer made no apologies for Hunter. Why is this NOT on BLU RAY?",1493424000,,711,4.378787878787879
8312312,5,B001JAHQIY,"I bought this season because I'm in the episode ""Lullabye"". I didn't know until years later that I was acting opposite the fabulous Gary Sinise. He was so creepy as the killer none of us would talk to him on set. This series is a classic, and you never know who will be popping up on your screen.",1483747200,,296,4.120689655172414

8312314,5,B001JAHQIY,Love! So much fun watching the seasons again. So many memories.,1463443200,,63,4.818181818181818
8312315,3,B001JAHQIY,"I actually cancelled seasons 5,6 and 7. I ordered them by mistake. I wanted DVDs.",1458000000,,81,4.466666666666667
8312316,5,B001JAHQIY,"While Season 6 is a more serious season than the previous seasons, it still has some funny scenes between Hunter & McCall as well as between Hunter & McCall & Charlie. It also has Hunter & McCall working separate most of the time. But Season 6 has something going for it.... ""Unfinished Business"", you know, the one where Hunter & McCall finally reveal that they ""got down to business""!

I disagree with the reviewer ""Taheen"" in that Stepfanie Kramer left due to being sexually harassed by Dryer. If that's the reason she left, then why is Kramer the Godparent of Dryer's daughter born during the series' run and why are they still friends today?

Stepfanie left to pursue her music career. She stated that fact many times over during interviews at the time. The interviews are on Youtube... I put them there. The tabloids have to create drama to get people to buy their papers.

And, after reading Taheen's review, I know that person missed the episode where they moved their offices to Parker Center..... Charlie can't figure out how to use his computer...which was state-of-the art way back in 1989 but it's a dinosaur compared to the technology we have today.

A myth I'd like to set straight is that Stepfanie didn't stand on a box in her scenes with Fred. People who believe that have never watched the show because when they have scenes together you can clearly see that he's a good foot taller than her....so where's the box?",1242432000,,1433,4.674603174603175
8312317,5,B001JAHQIY,"Great season, although it lacks some of the light heartedness of previous seasons.

The above review is incorrect in it's mention of Fred Dryer and Stepfanie Kramer not getting along. Stepfanie did in fact leave due to the fact she wanted to pursue her singing career. They reportedly got along very well behind the scenes and were good friends.",1242259200,,345,4.8474576271186445
8312318,5,B001JAHQIY,"I can hardly wait till this 1989-90 Season of this over-the-top police drama gets released on DVD, since it was my favorite season as well as the last season with Hunter's sexy longtime spunky partner Sgt. Dede McCall(Stepfanie Kramer)which therefore resulted in Kramer(McCall) being replaced by Darlanne Fluegel(Sgt. Joanne Molenski) in the 7th Season in September of 1990 and then Molenski was replaced by foxy blonde Sgt. Christine Novak(Lauren Lane) in January of 1991 when Molenski died off in the Winter of 1991 which was of course before this shows cancellation in the Summer of 1991, due to toppled ratings.

Something that always baffled me about this cop drama was in this season Hunter & McCall went from being renegade homicide detectives from the fictional Metropolitan Police Dept. in Los Angeles in the first 5 seasons to now being streetwise police investigators from the LAPD at Parker Center headquarters in Downtown L.A. in the last 2 seasons.

In addition to that obvious change; even the inside of the studio that the producers used to look like a real police station in the last 2 seasons looked different, a lot more upgraded, & a lot more upscale like a real LAPD station too including the extras dressed in LAPD uniforms.

It was also interesting seeing
*Jerry Orbach in the ""Son & Heir"" episode before his co-starring days on the police drama LAW & ORDER before his death in the Fall of 2004.

*Jerry Douglas in ""The Legion"" episode during his co-starring days as John Abbott on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Joe Bucci in the ""A Girl Named Hunter"" episode before his co-starring days as Hunter & Novak's fellow officer(Joe Righetti)in this shows 7th Season

*Michael McManus in the ""On Air"" episode before his co-starring days on BAYWATCH

*Robert Connor-Newman in the ""Street Wise"" episode during his co-starring days on GUIDING LIGHT

*Granville Van Dusen in the ""Broken Dreams"" episode before his co-starring days on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS and PORT CHARLES

*Gretchen Corbett in the ""Brotherly Love"" episode after her co-starring days as Rockford's sexy attorney girlfriend(Beth Davenport) on the detective drama THE ROCKFORD FILES before she left that show in the Winter of 1978, due to a salary dispute with Universal

*Erin Gray in the ""On Air"" episode after her co-starring days as Kate Summers on SILVER SPOONS and Buck's sidekick(Col. Wilma Deering) on the Sci-Fi drama BUCK ROGERS

*Allison Smith in the ""A Girl Named Hunter"" episode after her co-starring days on the sitcom KATE & ALLIE
