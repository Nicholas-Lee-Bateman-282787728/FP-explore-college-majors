2111272,5,B0002OOUNM,"Karen Valentine and William DeVane have great chemistry in this movie.  It's one of my favorites for this reason.  It's not just a story of amnesia, serial killings or old fashioned husband wants me dead; it's a well put together thriller with all three aspects to keep your attention.  It's so well made that it doesn't have or need bad language and the violence level, believe it or not is little or none, except for what they leave to your imagination.",1217289600,7,455,4.592592592592593
