2510044,4,B000E8QVCO,"This economy priced flipper disc, features a couple of heavy duty action features that were released at approximately the same time period, and is a good value for those who appreciate such fare.

Showdown In Little Tokyo (1991) stars Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee as LA police detectives tangling with a ruthless gang of drug dealing Yakuza led by Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa.  Tagawa's character is particularly brutal, as the crime drama features plenty of violence and martial arts action.  In his feature film debut, Brandon Lee has pretty good chemistry, teamed with Dolph Lundgren.  This is one of Lundgren's better efforts from the days when he had the backing from major studios.  Unfortunately, the film did not do very well financially, and Brandon Lee's promising career was tragically cut short, when he was accidentally killed while filming The Crow in 1993.  Rating: 3.5 stars.

Bloodsport (1988) is loosely based on the exploits of a real life fighter named Frank Dux.  Jean-Claude Van Damme plays Dux, a soldier who against the wishes of his command, heads over to Hong Kong to take part in a tournament called the Kumite.  It is a mission of honor, as Dux is taking the place of the son of his martial arts teacher (Roy Chiao).  Through a series of brutal, sometimes fatal matches, Dux finds himself on a collision course with the defending champ (Bolo Yeung), while trying to keep one step ahead of the military police who want to bring him back to face charges.  Van Damme is a bit unpolished as an actor, but his boyish charm comes through, and he is in fantastic physical condition, frequently displaying his remarkable flexibility.  The story is a bit formulaic, but still a good watch for martial arts fans.  Bloodsport would be followed by at least three sequels.  Rating: 3 stars.

While neither film is an action classic, packaged together at a reasonable price, makes this a pretty good value buy.",1328659200,,1919,4.861538461538461
2510045,4,B000E8QVCO,Bloodsport is a great movie. Dux is a character. I've read alot about him. The movie is more good old fashion testosterone fun action than anything. Pretty uplifting. Great martial arts.,1302048000,,186,5.032258064516129
2510046,2,B000E8QVCO,"I almost ordered this double feature, but I saw a copy in a store, and...  contrary to the product information here, ""Showdown in Little Tokyo"" is full screen (while ""Bloodsport"" is wide-screen).  Why do distributors mix movie formats like this?  I admit, however, this double feature is still a good deal, since I have only seen ""Shakedown"" available in full screen (even though it's theatrical release was wide-screen).  Still, I'll hold out.

2510047,3,B000E8QVCO,"Well....what is there to say?  You have one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's most successful feature films, and you have one of the most laughably-awful action flicks of the '90s.  Does this interest you?  Well, read on if it does.

SHOWDOWN IN LITTLE TOKYO (1991)
Oh dear God, where do I begin?  Okay, so here's the jist.  Dolph Lundgren (from ""Rocky IV"" and ""The Expendables"") plays an LA detective who was raised in Japan, and has no problem dishing out his hard brand of justice to any Asian-looking thug who menaces our society.  During a fight with some thugs, he runs into a suit-donning hotshot (Brandon Lee from ""The Crow"") who's got skills of his own.  They both fight the bad guys.  They both get in each other's way.  They both have pistols and badges.  They can't stand each other.  After all the chaos, it turns out their PARTNERS!!!!

There's no real point in describing the plot, because even for the '90s, common sense is tossed right out the window, with plenty of cheap music, bare breasts, bad one-liners, and lots of ass-kicking.  You have to be in the right mood to enjoy this kind of movie, but I will say that it barely acheives the 'so-bad-it's-good' level.  There are so many things wrong with this movie, that it's amazing people still know about it.  Two things that really bother me are an off-screen rape and the running length.  The rape is merely used as an excuse for samurai Lundgren to rescue the damsel in distress, only to end up in bed with him on the FIRST DAY THEY MET!  Good God!  In all seriousness, the running length is totally unacceptable.  This movie clocks in at 78 minutes, which is way too short.  If the movie had just slowed down a bit and actually went a bit deeper with its story, characters, and/or action sequences, there'd be a much better popcorn flick here.  As it stands, ""Showdown In Little Tokyo"" is very amusing for its lack of quality.  If for nothing else, you'll have plenty to laugh at.

BLOODSPORT (1988)
There's not much I can add to this movie, other than I believe it's one of Van Damme's best movies (not saying a lot I know).  Considering I tend to enjoy JCVD's mid-'90s selection of movies, I'm glad to realize that the movie that put him on the map is still worth watching.

In Hong Kong, the Kumite tournament is being prepared.  Fighters from all over the world will come to test their skills against each other.  Frank Dux (played by Van Damme) is an Armed Forces officer, whose desire to compete causes him to go on the run since his commanding officers won't allow it.  But before he goes to Hong Kong, he pays his final respects to his dying teacher, played wonderfully by Roy Chiao.

To make a long story short, Dux gets to Hong Kong, meets an American brawler named Jackson, flirts with an American reporter trying to get a story on the Kumite that nobody will talk about, and gives it his all in the tournament.  It's not a deep plot, but it's well-paced and mostly enjoyable.

""Bloodsport"" has a few stumbles, mainly the poor early scenes when Frank remembers meeting his teacher (at a young age, Dux and his friends look like they're in '80s clothes!).  Once Frank begins his training as an adult, the solid quality rarely lets up.  As far as the action goes, if you can handle that fight scenes tended to look very stagey (meaning, not a lot of believable blocking and counter-attacking), then you'll like ""Bloodsport"" even more than I do.  There is a good collection of different fighting styles, but I personally noticed how some punches and kicks were delivered without a lot of dodging or parrying.  Then again, it's only a movie.

OVERALL
I think you're betting off searching your local Wal-Mart for a much better price than Amazon's (I got mine for 5 bucks).  Either way, if you're in the mood for action movies without a lot of deep story with old-fashioned choreography, then jump right in.  I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy ""Bloodsport"" on some level; ""Showdown In Little Tokyo"" is guaranteed to get some big laughs.

SHOWDOWN IN LITTLE TOKYO = 3.0 / 10 (hilariously poor quality with a few decent action sequences)

BLOODSPORT = 6.0 / 10 (one of the better Jean-Claude Van Damme pictures, with some late '80s choreography that may not bother others as much)",1288310400,,4244,4.597869507323568
2510048,4,B000E8QVCO,"well both movies are cool, I just wanted one but the other one is no longer single and i am not buying blue ray movies when these movies are still good, I hope it comes in a good case not a cheap one. Both actors are great",1268179200,,222,3.74468085106383
2510049,4,B000E8QVCO,"both movies have plenty of action,Bloodsport is a true story following
Frank Duxs to hong kong to fight in the martials arts",1264550400,,124,4.681818181818182
2510050,5,B000E8QVCO,"Both films are deeply steeped in the golden era of kung fu movies and have to be judged in that context.

Showdown in Little Tokyo is probably the funniest, unintentionally homoerotic action film ever made (though it maybe the only one in that category). Its two heroes (?), police officers played by Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee, make their bloody way thru LA's criminal element in a fashion that today would earn them multiple consecutive life sentences (or at least cost them their police pension...). However, somehow, inexplicably, they manage to stay under the radar: no police boss ever appears to order them to put the safety back on and explain why the coroner had to cancel her vacation. And so, while working feverishly to rid LA of the Yakuza, our heroes have time to save a damzel in distress, and utter some of the best one liners ever heard in an unintentionally homoerotic action film (I will NOT spoil your fun here; watch the film to find out what they are).

Bloodsport on the other hand is a bit slower in pace, but packs an equal dose of punches. It features the Little Belgian (no, not Poirot...the other one! Van Damme!). It should be seen, if only for Van Damme's gravity defying leg split, which instantly earns him the respect of every male viewer...In the film, Van Damme's character honors his master by taking place of his dead son in a secret tournament, and the women wear illegal amounts of Aquanet...

If you are still uncertain if this double pack is worth your investment, please consider this:
As a teenager in the 80's, I was peeved at Hollywood for objectifying women's bodies, while leaving their leading men fully clothed. However, after watching Lundgren's and Van Damme's frequent, enthusiastic and spectacular ...er... rear asset displays, I felt vindicated...If only for that, they both disserve an honorable place in the annals of moviedom! So, support their...ahem...art!?",1243814400,4,1920,4.901538461538461

2510066,4,B000E8QVCO,Bloodsport is based on a true story of first American or westerner to ever fight in the Kumite.  Van Damme's first leading role.
