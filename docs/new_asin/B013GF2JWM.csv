7364754,5,B013GF2JWM,"Many producers and directors have made compelling films about motorsports; the sights and sounds of individuals in mortal combat (motorsports can be lethal) capture the viewers imagination and generate an irresistible adrenaline surge. Wise filmmakers know that its more about the individuals and their stories, less about the equipment, compelling though the costly technological marvels may be. The story rules, always.

Among the acclaimed motorsports films are John Frankenheimers Grand Prix (1966, three Oscars), the Steve McQueen Le Mans (1971) and Ron Howards Rush (2014)all fictional or faux-documentary, interspersed with historical non-fiction footage. Then we have true documentaries such as the excellent Senna (2010) and brilliant 1 (F12014), plus motorcyclings epochal motorcycle competition film On Any Sunday (Bruce Brown, 1971). Now comes Hitting the Apex, an outstanding documentary about MotoGP racing written, produced and directed by the British motorsports filmmaker Mark Neale, coproduced and narrated by motorcycle-racing enthusiast Brad Pitt and dedicated to the gladiators.

Four-wheel stories may fail for a primary reason: we hardly see the racers, especially in formula cars, unless a helmet is a person. Unlike car drivers, working inside safety cocoons, motorcycle racers are out front, with minimal protection, putting their lives on the line every time they go on track, riding 250-HP, 325-pound monsters that go like bloody hell and bite like hungry sharks.

Neale puts us deep into the minds, hearts and skills of the great racers Valentino Rossi, Casey Stoner, Dani Pedrosa, Jorge Lorenzo, Marc Marquez and Marco Simoncelli, all world champions. He frames his story around the 2013 MotoGP season, enriched with situations, incidents and personalities enthusiasts will recognize, including memorable on- and off-track clashesafter Rossi punts Stoner off at Jerez in a desperate attempt to pass, Stoner calls out the Italian, telling him that your ambition exceeds your talent. Yeaow!!! Rossis two years in Ducati hell, unable to feel the front, hitting the floor often and violently. And the time, before 2015s grim face-offs, when eager Apprentice Marquez was Maestro Rossis friend.

He engages essentially every category of participant, from those featured riders and their families to team managers, race direction, pit crew, medical staff and screaming crowds. He shows us everything: riders slo-mo skills and high-side horrors, riding the fine line between merciless competition and friendly sportsmanship, from the pinnacles of achievement against daunting odds to the agony of Simoncellis fatal Sepang crash. Neale has edited his own riveting (plus Dorna) footage and face-to-face interviews into a seamless narrative that captivates the viewer.

Though factual, the film is deeply emotional. It moves at MotoGP velocity, with dangerous brilliance on display continuously. Every rider, racer and enthusiast will learn most particularly about great racers, whose courage is tested to the limit, demonstrating what we already know about winners: habits create character and character determines destiny. This is motorsports filmmaking at its peak, deserving of wide audiences. For motorcyclists, its essential viewing (see www.hittingtheapexmovie.com for more details).",1451260800,5,3309,5.814432989690721

The movie itself is awesome.  If you like MotoGP, this is very different from Faster, there's a lot of history and info on the riders younger days and coming up the ranks.

I highly recommend this movie for any motorcycle racing fans.",1447718400,9,388,4.273972602739726

7364771,4,B013GF2JWM,"After watching the movie I have to say that it retains much of the ""feel"" of Faster even if the narration isn't the same. Not that it's better or worse, just different.

The footage is sublime, just as it was in Faster. The story is much the same, just the players are different...save for one. Watching the Simoncelli segment was heart wrenching, Even 5 years on (I watched it happen live) all I could think was how nauseated I felt when I watched it live...the movie version is not nearly as graphic but captures the shock and disbelief of the moment.

Also found the focus on Pedrosa in his segment to be somewhat revealing. He really comes across as a genuine guy which hasn't always been the case. The rest pretty much meets expectations with regard to the segments on the rest of the riders. No surprises nor revelations that haven't been covered a dozen times a year or more during the season. For that reason, I gave it 4 stars. Well, that and you can't give quarter or tenths of a star",1480204800,2,994,4.426229508196721

Wise filmmakers know that its more about the individuals and their stories, less about the equipment, compelling though the costly technological marvels may be. The story rules, always.

Among the acclaimed motorsports films are John Frankenheimers Grand Prix (1966, three Oscars), the Steve McQueen Le Mans (1971) and Ron Howards Rush (2014)all fictional or faux-documentary, interspersed with historical non-fiction footage.

8727592,3,B013GF2JWM,"Kudos to Mark Neale for producing his series of MotoGP Documentary Videos from his first, Faster, to now, Hitting the Apex.

But it needs to be made clear all this video footage is not original content, rather it is re-edited MotoGP TV race coverage with added in voice over commentary by the host. Some of it includes MotoGP Saturday Practice / Qualifying and related ""Package"" features (like a ride around the track in a rental car driven by Valentino Rossi) never shown in USA TV broadcasts. But for the most part, 90% is previous race coverage seen on television in the USA. For a motorcycle racing newbie, and to impress your friends with excerpts of the best MotoGP racing action, crashing and today's top riders, it is a must have. But for hard core motorcycle roadracing fan who follows all the MotoGP and World Superbike race TV coverage when it was initially broadcast, it can get repetitive and boring.

It is unfortunate that it is nearly impossible to produce original content of MotoGP and World Superbike racing, as there are just too many parties involved when it comes to licensing holder Dorna, the teams, riders, manufacturers, sponsors, etc. to get all the film clearances. And then the budget to shoot all the necessary original content for the potential size of the audience would be too cost prohibitive. It would be cool if Neale had the personal relationships (and budgets) to folow top riders like Valentino Rossi through a full race weekend, at home, and at play on his home dirt track with pals like Marc Marquez.

There is one original big budget movie drama centered around and inside SBK World Superbike, I do suggest that everyone who loves motorcycle roadracing and a good action drama love story, they should buy here on Amazon and watch, it's called High Speed - https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0015KJG2M/fastdatescomcale",1491436800,,1865,4.990353697749196
