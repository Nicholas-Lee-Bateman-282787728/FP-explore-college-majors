532363,4,630300783X,"One of the best of Ken-ichi Sonoda's earlier creations, Riding Bean is a must-own for any anime fan's collection.  Bean Bandit's a courier who works on both sides of the law.  He'll deliver just about anything for just about anyone for the right price.  Bean has very few scruples, but when the cargo's the daughter of a well-known political figure, and said figure is being held for ransom by a clever bunch of thugs, things can turn pretty ugly.  What ensues is a battle between the police, the thugs, and Bean himself, who's caught in the middle.  Needless to say, there's lots of action to be found here, complete with nail-biting high-speed car chases all throughout the city, big guns, explosions, and bigger guns.  The story moves at a breakneck pace and keeps your eyes and ears fixed to the screen.  Sonoda's fixation with weapons and cars comes alive very well in animated form, and the animation itself is actually pretty decent for an anime that's almost 15 years old.  The crew actually visited Chicago in order to get an idea of how to capture the cityscapes, and it definitely shows.  And how about Bean's ride, the Roadbuster?  I want one...anyway, Bean's partner Rally is a force to be reckoned with as well; a deadly beauty who's a crack shot.  The English soundtrack has a nice action-oriented flavor, with vocals by gospel artist Phil Perry.  The complete package for action fans and anime fans alike.  Even if it is ""old school"".",980121600,7,1450,4.729083665338646
532364,5,630300783X,"PG-13 my foot!  There do they come up with these ratings? Riding Bean is  rightfully entitled to an R rating!.  Anyway, Riding Bean is the coolest  movie I have ever seen.  Bean is the character by which all other action  movie heroes should be judged.  The plot is simple, but effective.  The  video is only 45 minutes long, and I guess they figured that more plot  would take away from the action sequences.  The second half of the movie is  just one huge string of car chases and shootouts.  The animation seems a  little old to some people, but it really doesn't bother me at all.  The  skillful direction, plentiful action, and a sense of humor make Riding Bean  my number one anime video.",965952000,2,694,4.467741935483871
532365,5,630300783X,"This video is great! I mean, not only is Bean one stud of a cartoon character, the comedy content is wicked! Some of the faces he pulls are just sooo wicked, and it's all down to the animators. There's a wide spread  of characters in the film, and I watched it over 20 times the first day I  got it! I know go round quoting the hilarious dialect and witty comments to  myfreinds, who love it just as much as I! A good start to any manga/anime  collection, or even if your looking for something interesting to watch,  Riding Bean is the one for any occation.",955238400,5,557,4.216981132075472
532366,5,630300783X,"This is an excellent anime movie, and is one of my favorites along with Baoh!!! This anime is what you would get by mixing Law & Order with NYPD Blue and then animating it making one of the best animes out there!!!  If you like anime and don't have this then don't think twice abbout it and  put it on your shopping list.",936576000,,321,4.079365079365079
532401,5,630300783X,"Riding Bean is a great anime show. It must have influenced the Transporter movies, because I see a lot of things done in the Transporter that are in Riding Bean. I have to say that when I first saw this show with my friends, we had rented the English dubbed VHS, and I was not that impressed. Years and years later, I bought this dvd out of nostalgia, and saw what a huge difference the Japanese dub makes. I found all of the characters engaging and the action was elevated because of it. The other thing I noticed after watching both the Japanese and English dub on the dvd back to back, was that a lot of sound effects were lost completely in the English dub. What a big loss of impact that has on the viewing experience, because not only are the original voice tracks so exuberant, but the sound effects are big as well. If you have access to grab this entertaining dvd, get it. It's only a shame that like Bubblegum Crisis, the Riding Bean Japanese blu-ray has no English subtitles.",1418688000,2,986,4.364130434782608

532403,5,630300783X,A lot more darker than I remember it when I watched this as a youngster. I guess a lot of the darker themes went right over my head all I remembered was the sweet car and the violence and humor. Pretty short like 45 mins or so.,1404777600,,227,3.851063829787234
532404,5,630300783X,"great pickup if you like gunsmith cats  this is a perfect buy ,classic anime lots of action and adventure totally awesome.",1375056000,,122,4.809523809523809
532405,4,630300783X,"I knew that Riding Bean was in the same world as Gunsmith Cats (an excellent anime http://www.amazon.com/Gunsmith-Cats-Bulletproof/dp/B000059RZ9) but I did not know that it is a precursor. Rally has blond hair! and is Bean's partner. Bean's archrival is a tough  woman, with a young protege. The protoge is clearly the prototype for Minnie May, although her hair is red/brown. It is interesting to see the story of how these two ladies met.

Bean is unbelievably strong, fast, etc. Kind of overpowered. In Gunsmith Cats they turned down the volume; Rally and Minnie are believably human. The setting is Chicago, of course, and the depiction of violence in that city is way over the top. I'm not a big fan of nasty violence in general, but I sat all the way through. I  wish bullet-proof clothing really worked that well!

Standing on its own, I'd give it only 3 stars. But for a Gunsmith Cats fan, it is cool to see how Kenichi Sonoda sensei's ideas developed along the way. As for Gunsmith Cats, if you haven't tried it then start with the manga.",1368057600,,1047,4.704918032786885
532406,4,630300783X,"While certain bits are far fetched to say the least, this can be overlooked with an animated feature of this caliber.  The main character ""Bean Bandit"" aka ""Road-buster"", is a loveable scoundrel in the tradition of Han Solo and other mercenaries with a soft spot for the underdog. Although an 80's anime, the drawing is pretty smooth, and seems to hold up well against more contemporary animated features.  As far as the action, one is reminded of films like Mad Max with some of the incredible driving, not to mention the gun-play, which often occurs during the car chases.  Finally, there are several rather serious themes touched on in the storyline, kidnapping and child abuse to name two, which makes the film work on a dramatic level as well. In short, this would probably be entertaining even for non anime fans, although probably not suitable for young children due to certain images and themes present therein.",1321920000,,919,4.878205128205129
532407,5,630300783X,Bought this dvd because I group up watching this movie on vhs. Wanted to continue to watch it even today. The dvd plays perfect.,1316476800,,128,4.375
532408,5,630300783X,"Riding Bean was produced by Kenichi Sonoda who did Bubblegum Crisis and Gunsmith Cats so if you've seen any of these your already know what to expect - ACTION & STYLE!

This is a high octane, fast electric paced anime which never takes a moment to slow down and let you take a deep breath. It has everything from incredible car chases to action packed showdowns and shootings.

Bean Bandit (our main character) is the definition of a bad boy. He can get so completly wreckless that his very attractive female partner must always keep him in line.

It's also worth noting the music is done by David Garfied and complements the anime perfectly. It's feel good, frantic electric guitar plugging and screeching to the fast tempo set in the anime.

Conclusion - Highly Recommended to Everyone - 5 Stars out of 5!",1153094400,12,807,4.6223776223776225
532409,2,630300783X,"RIDING BEAN (1989) is a 45-minute Japanese animated crime thriller--with some humorous elements--set in Chicago and featuring an all-American cast. Bean Bandit is a high-paid getaway driver whose last job, for a pair of ruthless killers/armed robbers who are not quite what they seem, leads to reluctant involvement in a kidnapping case involving the 11-year-old daughter of a Chicago-area tycoon. Bean and his female sidekick, Rally Vincent, are soon saddled with the kidnap victim and have great difficulty returning her without invoking the wrath of the police and the tycoon's vengeful private army. When they catch up to the real kidnappers, the chase is on.

The tone of the piece is light-hearted and fast-paced, with as much emphasis on Bean's driving skills and the remarkable features of his custom-made car, which get him out of more than one tough scrape, as on the story. It's nothing like the more serious (and more violent) Crying Freeman and Golgo 13 anime series. While there's much more bloodshed and brutality in those series, their idealized hitman heroes are actually much nobler characters than Bean and Rally, never harming innocent people and killing only those who deserve it. Bean and Rally, in contrast, are complicit in cold-blooded murder of innocents (committed during the robbery that opens the story) and endangering the public safety (causing numerous accidents in the car chase scenes) and, on a moral scale, only a notch above the killers/kidnappers who employ them.

All that said, there's a lot of good action here, including a spectacular car chase through the streets of Chicago that draws on well-known car chases from more famous live-action movies. Although the DVD offers both English and Japanese-language tracks, I tend to prefer the English track for a story set in America with an all-American cast of characters.",1103328000,6,1860,5.196666666666666
532410,5,630300783X,For someone who is into animation a little it is a pretty good movie.....but for an action packed movie it is a little short for me. But I bought the movie a long while back it and I still look at it so it still has the value of watching it over and over that I like in anime.,986083200,,276,3.694915254237288
7833913,5,630300783X,"Kenichi Sonoda got his start working for Artmic studio designing the Iron Man suits for Bubblegum Crisis, but later gained enough traction by creating his own OVA one-shot through Artmic, Riding Bean. Sonoda was a huge fan of The Blues Brothers movie, so he set his story set in Chicago making for what could be described as ""The Transporter in the 80s starring Sylvester Stallone"".

Bean Bandit(also known as ""Roadbuster"")is a professional underground getaway driver operating out of Chicago along with his gun-expert partner, Rally Vincent. After a previous job where he helps a two crooks rob a mall, Bean is visited by a bodyguard working for a wealthy industrialist whose daughter was kidnapped. Bean and Rally have to deliver the rescued girls while the bodyguard is seemingly gunned down by snipers. So our professional drivers head out in Bean's suped-up car to the wealthy family's mansion, only to find out they've been duped by the actual kidnappers who have been using them the whole time. Bean and Rally eventually track down the boss lady of the whole caper, which leads to a major chase through downtown Chicago, and a climax right out of Terminator!

Riding Bean eventually spawned off its own unfinished manga series, which Sonoda reformatted into a completely new manga titled Gunsmith Cats where Rally is now about 1 ft. shorter and half-Indian instead of a statuesque blonde who is a professional bounty hunter along with her partner Minnie-May(slightly based on an existing Riding Bean character), and Bean is a underworld driver that works alone. It's success lead to a 3-episode OVA series, which acted as a separate story making it okay to check out if you've never read the manga. Bean and Rally had a background appearance in Scramble Wars OVA special where characters from various Artmic titles engage in a Wacky Races-styled event(because Wacky Racers was a huge cult hit in Japan!), but all of the characters are in super-deformed or ""chibi"" form. The original Riding Bean OVA has been released in English through Animeigo that first put it on VHS and DVD, along with laser disc double-feature with MADOX-1, plus they recently produced a Kickstarter-funded blu-ray. It's a short 45-minute one-shot, but makes for a fantastic take on 80s American action flicks, and for anybody who thought Baby Driver was to ""tame"".",1512259200,,2344,5.038659793814433
