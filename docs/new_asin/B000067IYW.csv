8650694,1,B000067IYW,This was the crappiest street racing video i have ever seen. Looks like a 10 year old put it together! It was very short and not very many race's in it. I would love to give it back and get my money back!!!! It was very DUMB!!!! Dont waste your money on this video. TRUST ME.,1084665600,4,275,3.9285714285714284
8650695,1,B000067IYW,"PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS DVD... ONCE AGAIN [SOMEONE] TRYED TO MAKE A STREET RACING MOVIE AND FAILED.THERE SHOULD BE A WARNING ON MOVIES LIKE THIS,THAT SAY NO REAL STREET RACING!!!!!!!!.IF I WANTED TO SEE A BUCH OF GIRLS MAKING... SUGGESTIONS TO THE CAMERA I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT [ANOTHER MOVIE].
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR STREET RACING VIDEO THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT.

8650696,1,B000067IYW,It was terriable. I bought street fury red and though this would be good but it was not. They even stole clips from the other movie. I wish I didn't buy this DVD.,1029628800,9,162,3.9393939393939394
