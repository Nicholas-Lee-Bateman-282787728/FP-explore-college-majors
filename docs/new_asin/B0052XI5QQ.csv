8454653,2,B0052XI5QQ,"This concert was excellent.  This is one of my very favorite shows.  However this DVD's quality sucked!!!  I had this on VHS, had it transferred to DVD by a friend and it was blurry & low quality.  This is no better except that it's got that stretched look.  The audio is dull sounding.  If you are thinking you're getting an up grade, you're not!!!  It comes on professional artwork on the case & DVD, but looks like a bad bootleg version!",1412035200,4,440,4.3580246913580245
