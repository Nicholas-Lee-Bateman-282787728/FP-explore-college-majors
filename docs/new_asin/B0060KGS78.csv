8490397,5,B0060KGS78,"I really enjoyed this movie.... it is an older movie but in color and the story line was good.  I would recommend this movie....a bit of romance in it, but not like of today...would recommend this movie.",1415404800,2,203,4.486486486486487
8490398,3,B0060KGS78,"In this interesting movie an American arrives in British East Africa (i.e., Kenya) at the invitation of his brother, who was prospecting there. He soon learns that his brother is dead, murdered by the Leopard Cult which had supposedly been eradicated. He meets a beautiful anthropologist and a big game hunter (who loaned his brother money) and goes out to the bush to find out what happened. The movie follows the group as they try to find what may be a uranium mine, little knowing that death is stalking them...

A good film, and unique in that the film was partially shot on location during the Mau-Mau Uprising, an African insurgency probably more threatening than the Leopard Men. Also some good music, at least at the beginning.",1407888000,4,735,4.78740157480315
8490399,4,B0060KGS78,"This is a good 1950s Africa movie, filmed on location, with some nostalgic footage of the Kenyan coast at that time.  The scenes in Mombasa were filmed at the Manor Hotel, and there is a good section filmed at Gedi ruins, Watamu, just south of Malindi.  The story is fairly ordinary, but it has it's moments, and for anyone interested in old Africa movies it is a must buy.  Lots of action and atmosphere in an Africa which, sadly, only exists today in films such as this.",1401148800,6,472,4.402298850574713

8490401,2,B0060KGS78,Beyond Mombasa is a below average African adventure story that I couldn't sit through twice; that's despite the interesting cast.,1361059200,2,129,5.5
