3474262,5,B001AYWY9K,"Noise is an fantastic deviation from the norm that sadly did not make enough of a splash when it was released, which was only 2 years ago I was amazed to find out. Robbins plays alawyer that is constantly annoyed with the noise of living in New York city. Added on top of the stresses of his home life and work, Robbins begins to take the fight to the source, becoming a high profile vandal known as the Rectefier. His attacks on his foe draw the ire of the mayor of New York City, and the battle between them for Robbins sanity follows a variety of interesting turns.

Robbins acting in this is top notch, supported by several smaller names, most of whom held their weight, but was nearly poisoned by a few parts that felt overblown and outrageous.

There are quite a few scenes that feel drastically out of place, and Robbins tailspin marriage and separated affair feels a bit overdone, almost to the point of softcore pornography. But aside from this weird turn, the movie was hysterical, with several scenes worth watching repeatedly, and an ending message that's uplifting and empowering, that the little guy can still slay the giant.",1240358400,,1139,4.633663366336633
3474263,3,B001AYWY9K,"I'm a fan of Tim Robbins and this film had great potential, but I found it more irritating than enjoyable, even though there are some very good laughs. The film's plot is certainly something we can all identify with, but it just seemed to go on too long! This is a love it or hate it film, but I give it 3 stars for good performances and concept.",1235001600,2,346,4.102941176470588
3474264,4,B001AYWY9K,"Tim Robbins plays well to do NYC attorney married to a beautiful wife who is a classical musician.  Their daughter is a product of their mutual and genuine love for each other and everything seems fine until one day during his wife's home rehearsal of the cello piece her husband gets annoyed by a car alarm.  It does not stop there.  Suddenly car alarms are everywhere waking up his young daughter in the late hours of the night, disturbing lovemaking between him and his wife.  It all escalates when one day our hero is caught by a police breaking into a car in order to shut off the car alarm by disabling the car battery.  His life seems to spiral from there on; first, he is fined for damage, then he is kicked out of the house by his wife and finally he looses his job.  Without family, job and in the new apartment, all that is left is to fight noises in the NYC.  Our hero becoimes known as a ""Rectifier"" (very funny!), man who takes on single handedly car alarms in the city, until the mayor decides that this battle is personal.  William Hurt is fantastic in his role of a mayor who is more concerned about being liked by his constituents than doing the right thing.  I loved the part of the movie where Robins vandalizes car  in a manner of their alarm tune - each swing corresponds to the tune of the alarm.  Robbins is funny, sexy adn totaly likable in his role.  Definitely another one of the movies where Robbins is making his statement, but this is quite funny and deeply human movie.  It is almost impossible not to identify parts of any one of us with his character.  Great movie.",1230508800,6,1598,4.35472972972973
3474265,4,B001AYWY9K,This movie is actually very good.  The concept is hilariouse and his reactions are priceless!  There's even a couple of hot scenes with the young chick interveiwing him.  Good job.,1225324800,,180,4.933333333333334
3474266,4,B001AYWY9K,"This is a very tongue-in-cheek dark comedy about a man who takes the Noise in his life very seriously.  Tim Robbins plays David, a man who is so distracted by the noise surrounding him in New York city that he cannot live a normal life.  His solution, to become the Rectifier, a vigilante sneak who gives people with those darn car alarms exactly what they deserve no matter what the cost.

This movie was hilarious, if a bit sad at times.  This is not an action film but David nonetheless sees himself as a superhero of sorts.  In typical superhero style he has to loose everything to become the vigilante he wants to be.  The difference this time is losing it is his choice, kind of.

Where the movie started to fail a little bit was when David's new love interest talks him into trying to get legislation against noise put into place.  This is a bit weird, and the movie takes itself a bit too seriously.

Still as a dry, dark comedy this movie had me and my husband in stitches most of the time.  Just don't take it too seriously or try to get a message out of it.  If you need some sort of significant question to ponder from this movie it would be broader than the topics investigated in the movie.  I guess it would be this, ""What would happen if people stopped tolerating every annoyance they deal with in a day and started to really do something about?""  The answer is probably chaos, but it is still funny to contemplate.",1224979200,3,1431,4.354716981132076
3474267,5,B001AYWY9K,"I feel like I watched a diff movie than the first reviewer, cos I really loved this movie. I liked the grittiness and realism it displayed. And even without that, how could anyone NOT enjoy a movie starring Tim Robbins, William Hurt and the gorgeous & talented Bridget Moynahan? How many of us have gritted our teeth and at times felt like throwing a chair through the window when the noise outside gets so loud and persistent you feel like you're losing it? This movie is not unlike the Michael Douglas vehicle, Falling Down, where he went slowly nuts and took it out on bullies and bad guys. I watched this movie at a private screening when it was first released and I jumped at the chance to own a copy for my private library. Highly recommend this movie.",1221523200,10,758,4.460431654676259

3474280,2,B001AYWY9K,"** Early plot spoilers**

I am not a fan of Tim Robbins. He bores me to tears. Think films tend to do the same. I had put this film back on the rack 4 times before I got it. Tim Robbins plays a vigilante who hates noise so he lives in NYC.. He has taken it upon himself to destroy car alarms etc. that bother him. He leaves stickers behind at scene of the crime so people know he is ""The Rectifier."" His wife discovers what he has been doing and suggests ""close the window."" Robbins is too proud to be pushed around by noise makers. ""What if I want the window open?"" he responds. Eventually he gets arrested again. This time he goes to jail, loses his job and his wife, who suggested he see a shrink. He gets out of jail and maintains his quest.

I enjoyed the way the movie ended, that was genius and entertaining, however the rest of the movie was not. The writers went half way to create symbolism and metaphors. They should concentrated on making the film entertaining.

The movie contains sexual scenes, nudity, and the f-bomb. What was up with the girl with the French(?) accent complaining about her ugly looking privates? I keep reminding myself not to watch any Tim Robbins films but I do anyway.",1288137600,,1205,4.346666666666667
3474281,5,B001AYWY9K,Tim Robbins vs. William Hurt. Robbins fulfills our inner most desires by clobbering cars that have annoying alarms. Hurt portrays the hilarious mayor trying to find out who this vigilante is. It comes to a hilarious climax. Yet redemption and justice prevails.,1270512000,,260,5.214285714285714
3474282,4,B001AYWY9K,I really liked this movie and it was better than I thought it was going to be! Tim Robbins' character goes crazy when he hears noises espically car alarms. So he becomes a vigilante and takes care of the problem!,1266624000,,212,4.325
3474283,4,B001AYWY9K,"Who can't identify with the harried, frazzled, infuriated protagonist of this film? Car alarms, back-up beepers, inane cellphone chatter -- we're all drowning in a surfeit of noise, and the overall quality of life degrades around us incessantly as a result. But what can we do about it?

Well, David Owen (a wonderfully frustrated, about-to-erupt Tim Robbins) has the solution. In the guise of The Rectifier, he smashes into cars with yawping car alarms & shuts them off, leaving a small card with his symbol. Needless to say, this gets him in trouble with the law -- but an arrest or two isn't about to stop him in his seemingly quixotic crusade.

Simply developed as a comedy, this would be a successful film. But writer/director Henry Bean takes it further, adding some rough edges & interesting layers of texture with Owen's personal life, philosophical musings, and reflections on the nature of contemporary life. Not all of this works -- I'd like to have seen some of it developed at greater length, while other threads seem to drift off into limbo entirely -- but it does take what might have been a competent but predictable premise into more challenging territory.

I'd be remiss if I didn't single out William Hurt's performance as the smarmy, self-satisfied blowhard of a mayor. You just want to smack him or kick him down the stairs! His eventual comeuppance is one of the more satisfying examples of poetic justice I've seen in a long time.

The film appeared & disappeared all too quickly, but I think it has genuine cult potential, much like ""Office Space."" Both films have something worthwhile & even sobering to say about everyday life in America, sweetened just a bit with comedy.

Meanwhile, stop & think about the last time you enjoyed real silence, a space without intrusion by banality & stupidity & noise. You just might realize how precious & rare those times are, and just how much we need them. And if you're driven to take action of some sort ... more than a few of us will understand completely!",1262736000,2,2023,4.768571428571429
3474284,3,B001AYWY9K,"***1/2

David Owen is as mad as hell and he's not going to take it anymore.  What he`s mad about is car alarms.  Car alarms that go off in the middle of the night, or when he's trying to put his colicky baby to sleep, or when he's making love to his wife, or when he's just this close to grasping a particularly dense passage in a treatise by Hegel.  After years of putting up with this ubiquitous urban din and vainly pleading with the authorities to do something about it, David finally resorts to vigilantism, smashing out the windows and dismantling the alarms of the offending vehicles, even going so far as to leave a calling card in his wake identifying himself as The Rectifier.  Soon the mysterious noise-fighter has achieved near folk-hero status among his fellow Manhattanites and become a true thorn-in-the-side to the city's unctuous mayor, played amusingly by William Hurt.

Sort of a dark comic, upscale version of ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Noise"" is a rage-against-the-machine fantasy that chooses as its target the relentless cacophony of city life.  David, who's a successful attorney in his day job, isn't quite as off the rails as Travis Bickle, but there are times when his obsessiveness begins to border on the psychotic.  Is David suffering from mental illness or is he simply acting out against the impotency and inadequacy he feels in all areas of his life?  Or does he just get off on hating and being angry all the time?  Whatever the underlying psychological reason, once he establishes himself as The Rectifier, David develops a whole new outlook on life.  And who among us can't identify at least to some extent with David`s frustration, for don't we all have something that forever gets under our skin and that we would do just about anything we could to get it to stop?  David just happens to be the one person to actually act on that impulse.

Written and directed by Henry Bean, ""Noise"" is a satire of metropolitan neuroticism performed in a minor key.  Tim Robbins carries the film with his understated portrait of a man wound up so tight that he threatens at any moment to completely unravel.  He receives solid support from Bridget Moynihan as the wife who can't understand why the man she married has suddenly turned into a raving lunatic, and Margarita Levieva as an attractive newspaper reporter who uncovers The Rectifier's true identity and wants to explore what really makes this explosive man-of-the-people figure ""tick.""

The humor isn't always as uproarious as it could be, but everyone, not just city-dwellers, should find something to appreciate in David Owens' amusingly extended rant.",1261180800,,2624,4.8629213483146065

8280243,4,B001AYWY9K,"Tim Robbins, a terrific actor. carries this film.  In the hands of a lesser actor it might not be as good. The script is actually a little weak but Robbins and the excellent supporting cast make this very watchable.  William Hurt has a small part but he's so good that I wished he'd been in more.  He is hilarious as Mayor Shneer and it looks like he had a good time playing it.  His assistant is Alec Baldwin who looked like he was trying to upstage Hurt.  Both had terrifically bad dye jobs; Hurt's is an amazing red and Baldwin's is a sinister black.  They liven up every scene they're in but Hurt is by far the better performer.  Bridget Moynahan is pretty if a bit bland as the wife.  Margarita Levieva adds a lot of spice as another romantic interest.  Personally I would have voted for Robbins to go off to London with Levieva but they didn't ask my opinion.

I found the film to lag a little towards the end.  I fast-forwarded through the court scene.  The end was predictable.  Still it was worth watching.",1413849600,,1015,4.363636363636363
