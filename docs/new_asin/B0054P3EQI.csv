8456810,1,B0054P3EQI,"This is an extraordinarily pretentious and unpleasant film, which seemingly aspires to say something about Christianity but exactly what is difficult to discern as the film's 'Christ'-figure, although twice riddled with bullets, repeatedly cut and once nailed to a form of cross stubbornly refuses to die, which is surely a prerequisite for resurrection.",1500076800,2,354,5.69811320754717

8456814,5,B0054P3EQI,Great movie. In my opinion the best work of the director HUNG . THE CHARACTERS TOGETHER WITH THE SCENARIOS ARE UNIQUE. What an incredible work when we are used to such mediocres movies. Full of creativity and imagination.,1430352000,,221,4.842105263157895

8456816,1,B0054P3EQI,"This was a terrible movie! It was quite shocking that the very fine director of beautiful movies like  ""The Scent of Green Papaya"" 1993 and ""The Vertical Ray of The Sun"" 2000, Tran Anh Hung, was the writer and director of this mess. Poor storytelling, extreme violence just for the sake of it, over the top gory depictions with no purpose, etc. I couldn't find anything positive to report having viewed this except that the actors did their very best with poor material. I hope that he returns to his good movie making ways. Many people refer to his first three movies, the two I have already mentioned along with ""Cyclo"" 1995 as his Vietnam trilogy. In fact I consider his first film ""The Scent of Green Papaya"" which was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign film, as his best work with ""The Vertical Ray of The Sun"" a very close second. Nothing he has produced outside of these two movies have quite measured up. Though some will mention ""Cyclo"" and ""Norwegian Wood"" 2010 as both good fares, I think they are interesting but still fall short of the bar set by Papaya and Sun. His next project is a film titled ""Eternity"". It is scheduled to be released in 2015. We will see in what direction Tran Anh Hung goes going forward.",1415145600,3,1238,4.502222222222223

8456818,4,B0054P3EQI,"This movie was not fantastic but really not bad either. The storyline was quiet well,i enjoyed this movie anyway. When i looked at the reviews at amazon.uk,i was almost demotivated to look.
For me it's amazing how generally reviews from uk can differ from reviews from us. Honestly,i've learned in the time that if i really want to know,i prefer the opinions from amazon.us a different look and less negative",1337558400,,408,4.8428571428571425
