4890465,2,B005TF24F0,"The film is not as described. Dianna Argon, whose Snow White doll face adorns the cover is a minor chracter. Most of the film is preoccupied with building character, even the minor ones like a Dickens' novel. The main character is Chris Briant. He plays a new policeman and ex-army vet. There has been a rash of disappearances in the county. Briant suspects a fenced private hunting area known as Fort Gobin.

He opts to go find out on his own and by this time you're asleep. The gory stuff is done off screen. This is not a teens going to the wrong place and being tortured type of movie. Fairly lame in slasher terms.

F-bombs, no sex, no nudity, a homo-erotic dance.",1332115200,3,669,4.430894308943089
4890466,2,B005TF24F0,"To agree with many of the reviewers, Hunters was, or could have been, a decent little nasty take on that famous story, The Most Dangerous Game.  Too bad it takes almost 40 minutes to get to the meaty part of the story.  Basically, you should forward the DVD to the part where the police officer is meeting his informant at the fort.  Until then you will be assaulted with all manner of back stories, flashbacks, flashforwards and flash who-the-hell-knows-where-this-is-heading-to's.  Once the ""hunting"" starts, the film picks up very quickly.  This doesn't mean the film or the story redeems itself by a long shot.  There were lots of unanswered questions.  The motivations of the hunters are never entirely clear.  Surely not for depravity alone?  Yes, there is Diana Agron (of Glee and I Am Number Four), but it's strictly now you see her, now you don't.  Apparently her face on the DVD cover is for the sole purpose of selling the film.  She's hardly in the film, and the times she is on screen are strictly wooden.  All in all, this film might be worth seeing once, if you can get someone else to rent it for you.",1329091200,,1117,4.614213197969543
4890467,2,B005TF24F0,"Picture the scene a disused castle that is run by an elite club of men who like shooting off in the woods (I did that once). Throw into the mix some rubbish cops who have spent too long learning `The Cop Book Of Unamusing Clichs' and some `kids' who just wanna have fun. This then is the heady mix of (not so) groundbreaking scenarios that our hero is thrown into.

He is a cop, but wants to break the mould by taking on his ball breaking, no messin boss. This is a boss who knows he is winning because he can shout really loud. Our hero is also an ex marine - with a past - that will add to the nightmarish (not) situations he will be thrust into when a meeting with a stool pigeon leads him to be locked into the scary castle Goben's grounds.

Meantime there is another story of the three men who are the sort of gun totin guardians, they are all nice in real life doing jobs where they are underappreciated and oft times abused, like in a modern take of a Dickens character. One is a bar tender, one an IT guy and the other a school teacher, so at weekends they let their hair down by doin' stuff in the woods.

The hero cop is called Le saint and is played by Chris Briant who also directed this woeful waste of celluloid. We have phrases like `don't stray from the path' (bad guys to Le saint) and `you can't know suffering if you haven't experienced happiness' well the makers taught me a few things about suffering.

We have magic guns that never run out of bullets, motives left unexplained or even hinted at. Bad casting but Jay Brown as Steve and Steven Waddington as his mate Ronny both do above average jobs of raising this from the mire (hence the rating). It is badly edited and the plot is disjointed, what twists there are have better signposting than Disneyland - truly tragic. Eerie dream sequences and nightmares that are also a bit rubbish, some man on man action that is just inserted (forgive the pun) and then some vague references to the guardians being actual Vikings and I don't think they meant metaphorically.

Good points are the great locations, the cinematography and some of the acting, the music too does a great job of trying to get the mood across. There are plot holes but heck I assumed you would have guessed that. There probably is a good film in here trying to get out, but the wrong one got made. You will only want to see this if you have to have every film that calls itself horror and trust me a room full of school kids is more scary, or you are a friend of Mr Briant - not one from acting school as he has never been. Seriously duff film that has a smorgasbord of clichs wrapped up in a bilious attack of bad film making, only buy if you want to give it to as a gift to someone you want to remove from your Christmas card list.",1327536000,,2773,4.224528301886792
4890468,2,B005TF24F0,"Hunter-prey movies e.g. ""Surviving the Game"", ""Hard Target"", ""Deadly Prey"" are plentiful and this one had potential given that the surprising source of who were the hunters and a really nice horrific setting. But it lagged in too many areas to be really good.
First, too many missing bodies, in too small of an area, over too long of a period of time to be taken seriously.
Second, that the police chief and several upstanding community members should be participating in the crimes was unbelievable.
Third, that nobody discovered the rooms of displayed heads and torture devices at a frequently visited tourist destination historical fort - nahhh, not likely.
Fourth, that our hero combat, ex-soldier, now police officer, made too many dumb decisions and when he finds himself holding and firing a weapon he acts like he was afraid of it. Then, with his seemingly unlimited supply of ammo (where it came from - who knows), he completely missed his very close targets despite being just yards away.
Fifth, all the improbable scenes where assailants die from their own stupid mistakes.
Sixth, really bad editing making the movie seem like a patchwork of scenes tossed together to quickly finish the movie. One example is the pointless ending with the hero sitting in a cafe sipping coffee while the only other survivor just happens to be sitting at a booth in the same cafe staring out the window (probably wondering why her boyfriend was blasted with a shotgun right in front of her) before she orders her tea.",1325548800,,1510,4.879377431906615

4890471,1,B005TF24F0,This is the worst movie ever. I  feel I just wasted 2 hours of my life! Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie! The story has no cohesion and if Aragon is your draw - she is barely in the movie. This movie seems like it was made by an 8th grader.,1323993600,4,254,3.7037037037037037

8486120,1,B005TF24F0,"I am a huge fan of Terence Knox and Tony Becker but this is a waste of their talent.  They are fighting for their right to hunt down people in an abandoned fort.  It falls apart when.... someone suggests that there is something strange about all the missing people around the abandoned fort.  A child could have figured their way through the thin smokescreen that was set up to hide it.  I hate sending people away from it because I want these guys to be successful but unfortunately, this one got screwed up in ways they had nothing to do with.",1367539200,2,545,4.366336633663367
8486121,2,B005TF24F0,"This movie was kind of a let down, I watched it because Dianna Agron was in it and I am a big fan of ""I am Number Four"". I am a little unsure if this was made before that one or not but I suspect that she did the movie for a paycheck. Weak story and some pretty lame characters and I would take a pass, at least I rented it and didn't buy it!!",1364947200,,343,3.5866666666666664
8486122,1,B005TF24F0,"Is this French or American?  I guess it's somewhere in Canada, but just plain boring, no thrills, suspense.  very predictable, characters blah, acting blah. Unoriginal.

8486124,2,B005TF24F0,"When I don't know much about a movie, I usually read the Amazon brief synopsis to see what the movie is about and sometimes I watch the trailer. I don't know who wrote this synopsis for Amazon but s/he is either misleading the crowd in purpose because s/he was told to do so just to attract more buyers/viewers, or there was a mistake. Alice (Dianna Agron) HAS A TINY ROLE in the movie. I guess they wanted to put her on the cover rather than all the psychopaths hunting humans in the forest (...what is your name? That is her best line at the end). Even the trailer doesn't represent the movie. I guess they realized they messed up a movie with potential, they cut it, they saw the final product and then they said: oups, how can we sell this piece of junk for $12 and try to make some money? Let's misinform the audience, let's put Alice on the cover, let's have a trailer focusing on Alice (the good looking one, that is only in the movie for maybe 5 minutes total), and let's have Amazon write a fake pathetic summary of the movie that has nothing to do with the story. Two stars because it has potential, but two stars also because of the misinformation. The principal protagonist with the fake French accent (Chris Briant) needs to take some acting lessons from De Niro.",1342656000,2,1276,4.3881856540084385
