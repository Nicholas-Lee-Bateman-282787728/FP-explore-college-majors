I didn't see the end when rocky dies, but got past the part where his grandson's wife dies. It think it progresses well, even if it is a slow paced film, and it hoghlights how strong family values can help preserve the family when terrible things happen.",1336694400,,505,4.440860215053763
7850482,5,6303584667,I am a fan of this movie because I am playing the nurse at the bedside!  Loved doing the movie and everyone was great!,1043366400,2,118,3.9166666666666665

because it lends itself quite easily to being experienced by many people at one time. This
quality becomes greater when you experience a great movie with a loved one. That film
then becomes one of your fondest memories. For me, this is the case with ""Room-mates.""
I will forever remember the first time I watched this movie and who I watched it with.
There are certain movies where you quite willingly turn a blind eye to it's supposed
""imperfections"" and enjoy it purely because it left you with a good feeling in your heart
and a memory you will forever cherish. It is very odd indeed that ""Room-mates"" would
fall into this category. Despite the fact that you know one of the film's saddest moments is
inevitable, it still affects you deeply. Even then, you are left with hope in your heart, and
know that these character's will endure. I love the subtle yet important messages it
imparts. As a small boy, the son has to contend with the old man's incessant snoring yet
when he finally is out on his own and free of it he finds he can not sleep for the lack of it.
(This proves, in a unique and unforgettable way that you do not appreciate what you have
until you've lost it.) Every member of the cast gives stellar performances without
exception. I even enjoyed the moments that some critics would argue went over the top.
Above all else I will remember  what this film means to me personally. It was a rare sunny
day (my fellow Oregonians will appreciate the understatement.) My mother and I, refusing
to worship the sun decided to take in a movie. This was that movie, it is a rare gem that
manages to be genuinely heartwarming, without being sugary. It is a film I will never tire
of because it themes are universal. And it will forever be associated with the day my
mother and I shunned the sun, and saw a film that to us is unforgettable. It is a film I am
proud to have in my collection.",1019260800,10,1964,4.4404432132963985

7850485,3,6303584667,"The never ending story of the younger vs. the older generation. However, ROOMMATES puts this relationship into a funny but serious twist. I could really relate as my father and i were alot like these two. Not only did i  enjoy the film, but i was in it as a spectator at the baseball game scene.  For an enjoyable evening, rent or buy this film, sit back with some popcorn  and take in all this movie has to offer.",964915200,,414,4.215189873417722
7850486,5,6303584667,"In agreement with the other viewers, and contrary to the critic's review, this is a wonderful movie that deals with many issues regarding aging in America.  Although it takes place in the 70's and 80's it is not dated.  It  deals with relationships within families, between generations, as well as  health and social issues.  I use it in my classes on aging and  dentistry/medicine as a trigger film for class discussion of a wide variety  of areas regarding aging in America.  The vast majority of students  (dental) find it meaningful and worthwhile.  It is very moving, but not  maudlin.  As one of our students said ""It is nice to see the guys in the  class show emotion for once.""  I wish it would be rereleased.",956534400,6,717,4.632
