1411946,5,B00005A1ST,"The original ""Black Adder"" is one of the marvels of contemporary TV comedy (actually, it's now 21 years old).  Brimming with imagination, intellect, and that irresistible grotesqueness known as British humor, it has everything going for it.  For whatever reason, star Rowan Atkinson decided to quit writing his own material after this series (he relinquished that chore to upstart Ben Elton, whose name--at least in my book--will live in infamy as the man whose scathing 1986 critique of the great Benny Hill helped trigger the demise of the latter's classic sketch series.....it's never good form for one comic to criticize another).
But the present DVD's a wholly different ballgame.  The premiere episode in particular is itself worth the price: apart from the title character here being almost as mentally inept as his erstwhile assistant Baldrick, it features the incomparable Peter Cook as a murdered nobleman whose severed head comes back to haunt the twerpish Edmund Blackadder; many series fans are turned off by the visual unbearability of the gory humor.  MY constitution's robust enough to withstand it.  Indeed, it's an awful pity those cheapos at the BBC cut the series' budget after the first year, forcing all episodes to be videotaped on the same set, episode after episode.  Here the combination of interior AND exterior shots provide the necessary variety.  (Funny thing--great as British comedy is to many of us Americans, it was ironically their style of TV comedy that led to stateside TV comedy's artistic downfall, with loads of visually stagnant fare.)
Never mind: Here's one of the supreme treasures of boob-tube comedy.",1079222400,7,1646,5.212121212121212
1411947,5,B00005A1ST,"I still remember how I accidently stumbled across this series many years ago, channel surfing and finding some very strange show on PBS (it was the Archbishop episode).  I ended up on the floor laughing.  If you love Monty Python, Red Dwarf, Bottom etc you will love this series.  There are four series within the series and the beauty is they are all great, and you will want to watch them over and over and over.",1075680000,,414,4.421052631578948
1411948,5,B00005A1ST,"Rowan Atkinson is one of Britain's most beloved comedians, but it is with the tales of the BlackAdder he shines most.  This is the first series of tales that start in Medieval times and correct the ""mistaken point of history"", such as who really killed Richard III.  This is the complete Medieval arc with all 6 tales.
The Foretelling tells how Richard III did not really die on Bosworth field, and Edmund Blackadder's father rising to be King.  However, three witches mistakenly tell Edmund he will one day be King, so he set off to make this happen.
In the second episode - Born to be King - he plots to expose his brother Harry as being born out of wedlock, believing his father is already dead and he will then be crowned king.  Instead, of exposing his brother, he finds out there is a question about his own birth.
In Episode 3 (one of the most hilarious) - The Archbishop - the King decides he need someone as Archbishop to stop people from leaving their worldly wealth to the church.  He figures Edmund is just the person to be his handpuppet.  Only, two Knights Templar over hear a conversation about Becket and think the King was Edmund killed.
Episode 4 - another riot called - The Queen of Spain's Beard - The king decides Edmund, no longer of use as ex-archbishop, he can marry a foreign princess in order to strengthen England's alliance.  She is far from idea in Edmunds eyes and he goes to various extremes trying to rid himself of her.
Episode 5 is called - Witchmeller Pursuivant - The plague is start to rear it's head, and with it the Burning Times.  And Edmund instead of being closer to the throne is suddenly accused of witchcraft - and his horse, too.
The series closes with the last episode - The Black Seal - In a last determined effort, Edmund does what he must to be crown king....
They are so funny with a super supporting cast.  They are British Comedy at it's best.",1072656000,24,1896,4.4409221902017295

1411950,4,B00005A1ST,"Black Adder stars Rowan Atkinson, an absolute comic genius who is also the star of Mr. Bean.  The screenplays were written by Richard Curtis (Mr. Bean, Not the nine o'clock news) and Ben Elton - possibly one of the funniest modern writers.
In the first series, Rowan Atkinson plays a weak chinned, effeminate heir to Richard, Duke of York.  Set in medieval England, we are introduced to two of the most often recurring characters in Black Adders live(s) - Percy and Baldrick.  Lord Percy is an eager to please, high strung dolt.  Baldrick, an filthy peasant that is under qualified to be the village idiot, acts as Black Adder's golfer.
There are six episodes in the first series:
1.  The Foretelling - a lone horseman, cursed with a bad haircut and a large codpiece, races to battle after sleeping in.  After three cases of mistaken identity, the wrong king is crowned, the enemy escapes and three witches fortell of Black Adder's rise to the crown.
2. Born to be a King - the cowardly Black Adder must plot against a barbaric Scottish cousin in order to keep his holdings amidst a cast of leaping rabbi's, a eunch's feast and the death of a pharaoh.
3. The Archbishop - Archbishops die fast and often in Medieval England.  So it is perfect obvious to Black Adder that his pious brother, and rival to the throne, desparately needs the job
4. The Queen of Spain's Beard - international treachery gives Black Adder a chance to press his shriveled little body against some of Europe's most eligible princesses.
5. Witchmeller Pursuivant - a bit of black death is in the air, but that's not what is threatening to kill Edmund Black Adder
6.  The Black Seal - thwarted for the last time, Edmund sets forth to find seven evil men and fulfill the witches prophecy",988070400,55,1757,4.627009646302251

Whilst Atkinson is clearly the lead, the other members of the cast are excellent and this wouldn't work without Tony Robinson, Brian Blessed, Robert East, Tim McInnery, Elspet Grey  and Miriam Margoles.

 It is the quality of the writing which makes this series stand-out and it always makes me laugh.

1412023,3,B00005A1ST,"Let me explain the reason for three stars: Blackadder is one of the finest English comedies you will ever see... except for the first series.  Blackadder is one of those shows that started weak and grew stronger and stronger with each series that followed, until it achieved it's deserved legendary status as the greatest ensemble historical comedy ever made (and maybe the only historical comedy ever made).
However, before the glory of its later years came this first series ""The Black Adder"", set in medieval England telling an alternate history after the events of the Battle of Bosworth Field.  According to the series, Richard III did not murder his two nephews in the tower, but rather one of them lived to adulthood and fought with him in the aforementioned Battle of Bosworth Field.  Richard is accidentally killed by that nephew's son, a spineless, sniveling Edmund (Rowan Atkinson) and Edmund's father becomes King Richard IV.  The series chronicles this short (and fictitious) reign of Richard IV (played by perfect ham Brian Blessed) and the misadventures of his neglected second son Edmund.
If I had to describe this series in a few words they would be: incomprehensible, over-the-top, and distinctly unfunny.  It's a little hard to believe that out of the medieval dung heap bloomed the wittiest comedy ever.  While some of the situations in this series raise a few laughs (covering all manner of medieval times including church politics, witchcraft, crusades, etc.) the writing by Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson hasn't yet mined the comedy gold that would come later on.  Edmund is far from the cunning curmudgeon we know and love to hate; here he's stupid, weak, weird (in a pasty creepy way).  The cast is insanely large and the set pieces (a medieval court in all it's opulence, exterior shots of Alnwick Castle) are amazing, a reflection of the lavish budget the cast were given by the BBC.  The three core cast members of Atkinson, Tony Robinson's Baldrick (who is the clever one in this series... the world is LITERALLY upside down here!), and Tim McInnerny's Lord Percy Percy get through the series admirably but their characters are still being formed, and not quite as solid as they would be in the years to come.  The thrust of this series (from Edmund's perspective) is to show his family he's not as sniveling and useless as he really is, only to be defeated time and again by extraneous circumstances, his own friends/family, and his own stupidity.
And yet, let us not despair, for out of the primordial ooze of these half-formed characters and half-baked attempts at laughter would walk the gloriously wicked Edmund Blackadder of lore and his marvelously witty comedy!  Take hart that we are no longer in the Middle Ages, as history will show, the Elizabethan time was a time of greatness (for Britain and the Blackadder saga).",1441411200,,2860,4.9375

1412110,3,B00005A1ST,"I was first introduced to the Black Adder series (Season 3) back in high school and found it an enjoyable parody of episodes in English history. My sense of humor meshes will with British comedy  so I enjoy watching classics of the genre like Black Adder and Monty Python movies and shows. After having watched Black Adder Season 1, I must say that I found it funny and enjoyable enough but not on the same scale as the later seasons, so I would recommend them, especially Season 3, before Season 1. I think one of the main things that troubled me most about this season was that Rowan Atkinson's character was not as likeable in this season as in later ones. He came off as too pathetic and groveling.",1392163200,,702,4.441860465116279

Think of watching ""Get Smart"" type of humor, set in the past, filled with making fun of one's own history and culture.  The flip side of Masterpiece Theatre.  Saturday Night Live.

1412136,5,B00005A1ST,"""Blackadder"" starred Rowan Atkinson as Edmund Blackadder, a hapless member of the royal family in the late fifteenth century in England.  In the annals of British television comedy the show has attained classic status, and this DVD contains all six episodes of the first season of the show originally broadcast on the BBC in the summer of 1983.

Edmund is ineffectual and sniveling despite his proximity to power, and he is disrespected by others in his family.  The comedic plots of the episodes center around Edmund bumbling into situations symbolic of the Late Middle Ages, and the humor includes a range of devices from sight gags to takeoffs on Shakespeare.  There are adult themes in the show, and aspects of ""Blackadder"" would be viewed as politically incorrect by today's standards.

While extensive knowledge of British history would contribute to the enjoyment of the series, those without such knowledge would still get a lot of the humor.  There is a very brief bonus feature on the DVD that provides historical background for this highly praised series.",1383350400,,1066,5.062857142857143

1412150,5,B00005A1ST,"Like so many other Americans, I was introduced to Rowan Atkinson through his ""Mr. Bean"" series, but I was even more pleased to stumble onto this series. This show is somehow irreverent and sober at the same time, and that suits the historical setting pretty well. The scripting and acting are equally strong. This is some real ""comfort food"" among British shows out there because it's willing to make fun of itself on occasion instead of taking the lazy way out via flavor-of-the-month politics. It hasn't lost any of its shimmer in the 20 years since it was made.

Atkinson is great as the ruthless schemer (who can't stop simpering) Edmund. Tony Robinson's Baldrick is both sharp and hopeless. Tim McInnerny's Percy is so dimwitted that he's almost endearing. Miriam Margoyles and Jim Broadbent, although only appearing in one episode, have great supporting roles.

Brian Blessed is superbly eccentric as Richard IV. His physical on-screen presence as well as his absurd script lines are a joy. We are ""blessed"" to hear him bellow, sing, roar, grunt, and mutter his way through the show. This casting choice was brilliant and he adds so much humor to the show.

Strict historians will bridle at the factual inaccuracies and ""alternate timeline"" in this show, but the writing is put together well enough that I, for one, am willing to overlook them.",1372896000,,1350,4.912280701754386

The description on the back of the 2nd cover describes Edmond Blackadder as ""deliciously twisted and swaggering around town with a big head and a small beard in search of grace and favor from the stark raving mad Queen Bess"". As with clever comic English plots there is always some convoluted result that leaves Edmond glad to escape with his big head and small beard. The 3rd cover describes Edmond in a ""slump"" moneywise and is a gentleman's gentleman to the ""mini-brained"" prince regent. With many looks and asides, Edmund gives bitter advice.

1412174,5,B00005A1ST,"Blackadder is a British comedy that follows the lives of the royal ""Blackadder"" line, a lineage that seems to produce nothing but sniveling cowards who are always trying to shirk duty and avoid all sense of obligation. Produced in four seasons, with each season taking place at a specific time in history, the series commences in season one with the life of Edmund Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), a son of the English King (Brian Blessed) in the 15th century. As the seasons progress, we move forward in time until ultimately arriving in season four with a certain ""Captain Blackadder"" in the trenches in World War I. The premise of the show, then, is to watch the machinations of the current Blackadder as he squirms his way through each threatening situation while continuing his quest to wiggle ever higher up in life, whether that be to become King (as in season one) or to escape the trenches of World War I (as in season four). The show is one of the most successful comedies to ever come out of the BBC.

The character of Edmund Blackadder begins in season one as the Duke of Edinburgh (his accidental killing of Richard III over the misappropriation of a horse seems to cause him some serious difficulties about this time, with a little help from Shakespeare), and episodes revolve around Blackadder either attempting to seize control of the throne or, in the other cases, trying to keep from being executed due to his shenanigans. Without giving any of the story lines away, we can say that each season sees Blackadder incarnated in the form of one of the descendants of the Blackadder line, and so Edmund's character shows up, first in the Middle Ages, then in the Renaissance, and finally, in World War I. Over this span of some 600 years (specifically, 1485 - 1917), we see that for one to be a ""Blackadder"" carries a whole series of connotations with it, this being the underlying theme of the show in all its contorted situations and events.

Edmund Blackadder is not the only recurring character throughout the seasons. His dogsbody is Baldrick (Tony Robinson), who is also present in every episode in the entire series. Other actors (including Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, and Tim McInnerny) who appear as key characters in one season will frequently appear as different characters other seasons. Each of the supporting actors is outstanding, and although Blackadder is clearly Atkinson's show, all the actors work together to pull the effort off seamlessly. Many of the special characters are famous British actors and/or comedians, but it is not necessary to know that as you watch the episodes.

To a certain extent, ""Blackadder"" defies categorization as a TV show. It certainly is a comedy, and a sardonic, cynical one at that. However, the series is so vested in British history that one almost feels you are receiving a series of lessons on British history rather than just watching a comedy show. And while it is not necessary to be fully aware of the major events of British history in order to enjoy the show, it certainly helps to bring a richer enjoyment to the experience, and you also won't miss the numerous history-oriented ""asides,"" ""caricatures,"" and allusions that fill the show. The other side of the coin, so to speak, is that by watching the entire series, you can get a ""mini"" British history lesson on an almost subconscious level.

The show is indeed extremely funny, but this is a distinctively ""British"" show. If you are an American viewer and are not familiar with this type of humor, there may be a short period of adjustment, but after one or two episodes, understanding the humor becomes second-nature. True, there is much similarity in Rowan Atkinson's style of humor and the type of humor commonly seen in America, but there is certainly also that little added ""twist"" that may take typical American viewers a little time to absorb. Once you do, it is straight laughs all the way. And it is not all high-brow: there are sight gags, physical humor, and yes, even occasional crassness. This is history for people who don't take history all too seriously, and Blackadder in a way epitomizes all that we average people feel as we go through life, regardless of the historical backdrop operating during our lives.

Some viewers may be aware of Atkinson's other very famous and popular series, ""Mr. Bean."" Let's be clear and explain that there is virtually no relationship between these two shows, which have different premises, a different comedic approach, and are generally aimed at different audiences. To think that Rowan Atkinson successfully completed an engineering degree at Oxford and ended up playing Edmund Blackadder is a stretch, at best. And yet, once you see him in action, you can easily see how this came about. He is like a little kid in class, always wishing to pull the string on the person's clothes sitting next to him, or perhaps placing the proverbial whoopee cushion under the teacher's chair. In a very real way, it all seems a natural, un-acted role for him.

Blackadder season four was voted in 2000 by the British Film Institute as the 16th best British TV series in all the BBC's history. The previous three seasons are every bit as good, and it is likely that the strong political themes underpinning season four played into the rating. Let's just say that, in spite of its occasional crudity and offensiveness (yes, we may be offended at a few things here and there - the show is an equal opportunity lancet), Blackadder must be easily rated as one of the BBC's master productions. It's fun to watch, helps us learn, and perhaps even more, makes us think. But it is simply sheer comedic entertainment that begs for another season.

1412175,5,B00005A1ST,"I had caught bits and pieces of this program on TV over the years, but never more than that. I finally got around to watching a whole section in sequence. It is a bit bizarre, but I have to say, it is very entertaining.

Prince Edmund (son of the fictional King Richard IV of England) is the main character in the series - he adopts the name Black Adder. Richard becomes King when Edmund ""accidentally"" kills Richard III.

Black Adder seems to always come out with the short end of the stick, but never gives up. Given the circumstances, it is hard to label him as the bad guy - though he is pretty bad. His sidekicks are Lord Percy and Baldrick the peasant - they help keep things interesting.

Black Adder's mother is a great character. It is really funny to see how she saves her son from being burned at the stake in the Witchsmeller episode. Very unexpected.

I guess this program is sort of like Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I mean, the humor is similar in some ways. Very British I guess.

The program continued through several series. Give series I a try and see what you think. Some say series II and/or III are the best. I have not gotten that far, so cannot comment on that now.",1290384000,,1193,4.308035714285714

1412177,4,B00005A1ST,"Who knew the War of the Roses was so funny?

Or at least, the first season of ""Black Adder"" was, as it chronicled an erased era in English history, and the life story of the slimiest, creepiest, least impressive prince ever. Rowan Atkinson brings the legendary Black Adder to life, with plenty of slapstick and bawdy humour -- too bad it doesn't quite measure up to its sequel series.

On the day of the Battle of Bosworth Field, the Duke of York (Brian Blessed) and his son Harry (Robert East) accompanied the king (Peter Cook) into battle. His second son Edmund (Atkinson) hopes to come along, but he oversleeps. The battle is practically over when he arrives, but he succeeds in beheading a knight who tried to take his horse. Unfortunately, it was the king.

His friends Baldrick (Tony Robinson) and Lord Percy Percy (Tim McInnerny) help him cover it up, and to Edmund's delight, his father is made king. He dubs himself the ""Black Adder"" and decides to one day become king of England... too bad nobody likes him, and the ghost of the late king has decided to play some mind games with him.

But being the Duke of Edinburgh has its own problems. Edmund soon has to deal with a Scottish laird getting his lands, being made the endangered Archbishop of Canterbury, an engagement to an unattractive Infanta, and being accused of witchcraft. Finally, when all his titles but Lord Warden of the Royal Privies are seized, he decides to usurp the throne himself... but unfortunately gets into the grasp of the evillest men in England on the way.

""Black Adder"" is in some ways the least polished of the series, since the whole idea is pretty new here. But it's a unique sitcom, and handled with the sort of wonky zaniness that the setting demands (""Why, some people over there aren't fighting! They're just lying down!"" ""They're dead, my lord"").

And while the first episode is a bit jumpy, it quickly gains humorous momentum. Lots of hilarious dialogue (""Dear Enemy, may the Lord hate you and all your kind. May you turn orange in hue, and may your head fall off at an awkward moment"") and knotted-up storylines, such as Blackadder doing whatever it takes to avoid marrying the Infanta, or selling fake relics as the Archbishop.

Of course, things always go horribly wrong, and the more Edmund attempts, the more disastrous things turn out for him. The last episode is a glorious mixture of Greek Tragedy, Shakespearean history and madcap comedy with some blood and gore, as well as a hilariously ironic final line.

Atkinson is pretty perfect as the slimy, sniveling, creepy, cowardly, inept, whiny-voiced Edmund, who repulses almost everyone around him with both his appearance and personality. Absolutely sterling. Robinson and McInnerny are equally good as his grubby servant and birdbrained pal, and Brian Blessed is wonderfully bombastic as Richard IV.

The first ""Black Adder"" series is not the funniest of the overall series, but it is a hilarious, crazily funny little comedy series that just gets better as it goes on.",1250208000,10,3026,4.815028901734104

They could have run any number of image enhancing or cleaning programs on it but it looks as if they absolutely did nothing to it at all.
It's ridiculous how bad this looks. As if it was transferred from a VHS tape. I'm very displeased. I wish I'd been able to see a screen capture before purchasing it.",1244419200,,616,4.228813559322034
1412179,5,B00005A1ST,"Rowan Atkinson began the Black Adder series set in medieval days, with Edmund Blackadder being a man of few morals and high ambitions. He's heir to the Duke of York and has to deal with a bumbling servant Baldrick as well as the less-than-helpful Percy. Both of these characters follow him through pretty much the entire series.

I find the series to be *incredibly* funny, but there is definitely a difference between what many Americans find to be funny and what British find to be funny. I love British humor. It is often very dry and cynical, and also a lot of times you have to have some education / background to understand it. That is, if you actually know something about British history you'll pick up on a ton of superbly funny in-jokes that might otherwise pass you by.

For example, in one of the episodes a general comment is made about a person being better off dead, and two Knights Templar decide that they should race right off and kill the person. This is based on an actual situation in English history. There are witches cackling around cauldrons giving out messages, another staple in English drama.

Yes, a few of the jokes go towards the slapstick kind of silly versus the more erudite kind. There is something for everyone.

Highly recommend for anyone who loves British comedy!",1230336000,4,1302,4.672489082969432

But this ability to understand the humor will increase as you watch the series. A general underlying truth is that each episode gets funnier as you move forward in this series.

1412187,4,B00005A1ST,"BLACKADDER ran four glorious series on the BBC, but the show took a dramatic change in format after this, the first series, and a change indisputably for the better, changing the character of Edmund Blackadder from a bitter, pretentious, self-serving, sniveling idiot to a bitter, pretentious, self-serving, saracastic jerk. The changes made were beneficial both to the series itself and to the performance of Rowan Atkinson. In later series, he would make , in his various incarnations, Edmund Blackadder (whether Lord, Butler, Captain, Royalist, Dickensian shop-owner or Time-Travellor) into a strangely likeable anti-hero dealing with people far below his intelligence level. It is not so here, and the series is weaker for it.

The show takes place over a 13-year period in the 1480s, a reality in which Richard III (Peter Cook) was a beloved monarch and won the battle of Bosworth Field, only to be beheaded by an idiotic nobleman mistaking him for a horse thief. That nobleman is Prince Edmund the Black Adder (Atkinson), Duke of Edinborough and Warden of the Royal Privies, the weak-chinned son of the fictional King Richard the Fourth (Brian Blessed). Edmund is a blithering idiot with unrealistic expectations of ascending the throne, a man whose father doesn't even know he's alive and whose only allies are Lord Percy (Tim McInnerny), an aristocratic nitwit even more incompetent than himself, and Baldrick (Tony Robinson), a serf who's slightly cunning plans only rarely go right.

Atkinson plays up the idiocy in a funny voice, a funnier hat and an even funnier haircut, whimpering and giggling like a schoolgirl when pleased and squeaking in terror when in mortal danger (which happens frequently). He has a nice way with a slow burn and the over-enunciated consonant, traits he would perfect as the character's descendants become more cynical. When taken in small doses, he can be hysterical, but watching all six episodes after the other, one becomes aware of how mannered the comedy is.

Atkinson is lucky he has such an excellent supporting cast, or he'd be in trouble. As Baldrick,  Robinson builds the foundation for the unassuming moron he would perfect in later series. This Baldrick is smarter than all of his descendants, though not by much, and Robinson's deadpan takes on the insanity that revolves around his master is priceless. As Percy, Tim McInnernry plays dumb so well it should be illegal, a look of blissful incomprehension stuck to his face to side-spliting effect.

As the bloodthirsty King Richard IV, Blessed is keen to the parody of the Shakespeare hero his role entails, and his insane monarch is a highlight of the series. As Edmund's Goody-goody brother Harry, Robert East does much with little material, playing straight-man with an upper lip so stiff you could use it as a diving board. Elspet Grey provides a sense of airy class and a delectable foreign accent as the Queen who never quite knows what's going on.

The Episodes are as follows:

THE FORETELLING: In which Edmund kills the King, becomes a Prince, accidently saves a traitor and dons the title of the Black Adder. The groundwork for the series is laid out in the best possible manner, and in ten minutes you know exactly what you're in for. Peter Cook trods out his best Olivier impression as the ghostly Richard III. Unfortunetly, this is Atkinson at his most annoying.

BORN TO BE KING: In which Edmund must deal with an arogant Scotsman and the dregs of Medieval entertainment. The series kicks into gear here with a hilarious script, featuring a side-spliting performance from The Jumping Jews of Jerusalem (""They Jump, my Lord. A Lot"" says Percy, describing their act) and Brian Blessed at his most violent. Alex Norton scores points as the coarse Doogal McAngus, who takes every possible opertunity to humiliate the Black Adder, and Baldrick gets his first chance to fill out a dress when a beared lady shaves off her beard.

THE ARCHBISHOP: in which the Archbishop of Canterbury is the most dangerous position in the land, and Edmund is the next canidate. Features Atkinson at his best while trying to convince a dying man Hell isn't such a bad place at all, and some hilarious Catholic-related sight-gags. Tony Robinson's crowning glory in the first Black Adder series is in this episode in a wonderfully-played routine where he hocks fake religious relics such as a Holy appendage variety pack (Featuring the noses of Jesus and Peter and the breasts of Joan of Arc). One of the best.

THE QUEEN OF SPAIN'S BEARD: In which politically-profitable wedding Bells ring for Edmund and a gargantuan Spanish Princess, and he tries his damnest to get out of the marriage. The inspired pair of Miriam Margolyes and Jim Broadbent are at their best as the horny Infanta and her effeminate interpreter Don Speekengleesh, who impassionate translates such phrases as ""I want to enfold you in my broad thighs"" to hilarious effect. Atkinson does wonderful work here, including a prize-winning double take when he meets his bride-to-be.

THE WITCHSMELLER PERSUVIANT: In which the plauge is blamed on Witchcraft, and Edmund and Company find themselves on the wrong end of a witch trial. This episode features a highlight of the series in Frank Finlay. Watch him happily chewing away the scenery as the titular Witch hunter, barking out words like ""Grumbledook"" and ""Beelzebubbles"" with glee as he accuses Edmund and his pets of Witchcraft on clearly manufactured evidence that everyone believes. The sequence in which he condems Edmund's horse is especially funny. Watch for a cameo by British stage and screen regular Louise Gold as a screaming woman at the beginning of the episode. One of the best of the series.

THE BLACK SEAL: In which Edmund, desperate to get the throne, gathers a band of seven of the most evil men in England and the tale of the Black Adder comes to a suitably violent (and hilarious) end. Rik Mayall shows up uncredited as the delightful whack-job Mad Gerald, and Edmund's evil band provide plenty of laughs. Atkinson finally gets a chance to use the strongest weapon in his comic arsenal in this episode: withering insults. When he dismisses Percy from his services, Edmund unleashes a series of put-downs in the manner born, a trait that would become synonimus with the name Blackadder. A fitting end to a side-splitingly funny if uneven series.",1187740800,2,6372,4.989642184557439

This transition isn't explained at all in Series 2 which is a bit of a head-scratcher but we'll forgive it.

Even as an American with VERY little British history knowledge to back up the story lines, I was rolling on the floors with every episode. Between Black Adder's lunacy (care of Rowan Atkinson), his assistant Baldrick's cunning plans (and inability to go back to being a dung shoveler, seeing as it took him years to get to that status level before befriending Black Adder), and Lord Percy's unbelievable naivety, you'll be rolling on the floor too. And I haven't even mentioned the other main characters  (like the king, played very well by Brian Blessed) and guest stars (although most are only well known in England). Side-splittingly funny. Unfortunately, I had to leave the UK before seeing the final episode - which really whet my apetite when it showed up on PBS back here in the US. And I was not dissapointed at all!

  About 20 years later, I now know a little more about about British history - and it makes the series even funnier. What's more, my appreciation of Shakespeare has increased, and this show is riddled with snide comedic references to it throughout. Just wait 'til you see the end of the first episode (make sure to keep watching until the end of the credits!) - you'll just about burst from laughing.

  Well worth the purchase, especially for anyone with any level of interest in British history and/or literature. The only negative I can come up with is that the first episode MIGHT be too violent for very young children to watch (not to mention the lewdness in some subsequent episodes).
