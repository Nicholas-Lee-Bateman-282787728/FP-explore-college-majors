I've seen a handful - Some of their releases are fairly good, some just OK because of their recently unearthed obscurity and others just plain god-awful (`Top Girl', 'Provocation' as examples).

 I guess the same can be said of other, older companies such as Severin, Redemption, Synapse, Shriek Show, Blue Underground, Mondo Macabro (altho I have a weakness for everything BUT the Bollywood and Indonesian Horror they release), and the now-defunct No Shame label (which is a shame, as I've enjoyed quite a few of their releases). But these companies have proven themselves to churn out a fair amount of entertaining, rare releases through the years, most with DVD extras that make them even more enjoyable. Mya never puts any extras on any of their titles...

As far as 'Italian Sex' goes, it's about a woman who researches and writes a thesis about Italian prostitutes by actually becoming one for 3 months, and presents her dissertation to a panel in hopes of getting her degree in sociology. The panel is comprised of stereotypical prudes, and as she relates her experiences to them (as well as what appears to be a courtroom full of other stereotypes), we learn, allegedly, what the current status of Italian males regarding sex is supposed to be all about. (Remember, this takes place in 1974).

Unfortunately, this is just another one of those silly Italian sex farces that were prevalent at that time, and most I've seen were done better. This one's full of outrageously over-the-top performances, over-acted hysterics and hammy, humorless humor; grossly exaggerated clichs of gays, clergy, men, women, prostitutes, politicos, etc. It borders on the imbecilic and bad subtitles only makes matters worse.  Thankfully, it is in Italian w/ English subs, otherwise it would be rendered unwatchable if dubbed in English.

 If you enjoy a good European sex farce, stick w/ 'The Virgo, the Taurus and the Capricorn' (also on Mya), 'Lover Boy', 'Evil Thoughts (Cattivi Pensieri)' or 'Giovannona Long-Thigh', all of which feature the luscious virtues of Edwige Fenech.",1255132800,10,2242,5.126027397260274
