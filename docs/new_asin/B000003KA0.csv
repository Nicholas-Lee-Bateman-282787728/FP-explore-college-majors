7902890,4,B000003KA0,"Sooner of later all ""Star Trek"" series have an episode where the characters have to confront their subconscious fears as an encounter with something alien forces hidden thoughts to the surface.  For ""Star Trek: Voyager"" that moment comes in Episode 24, ""Persistence of Vision"" (Written by Jeri Taylor, Aired October 30, 1995).  As they work there way across the Delta Quadrant ""Voyager"" is about to encounter the Botha.  This meeting is fraught with peril, danger, etc., and the Doctor (Robert Picardo) orders Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) to relax.  The Captain tries to enjoy her favorite holonovel, but before things get too interesting with Lord Burleigh (Michael Cumpsty) she is called to the Bridge for first contact with the Bothan representative (Patrick Kerr).  The reception is far less than cordial, but a rendezvous is set up where the decision will be made whether or not to allow ""Voyager"" safe passage through Bothan space.  Then things start getting weird.
Janeway sees the little girl from her holodeck in the novel.  It could be a glitch from the crew's work on expanding the ship's holographic system (to help the EMH wander free), but that is quickly ruled out.  By the time Kes (Jennifer Lein) sees the little girl too Janeway has heard her fianc Mark and been attacked by another holonovel character.  Again, it is Kes who is able to confirm what is happening to Janeway, but the Captain turns over the negotiations to the Botha to Chakotay and submits to medical tests.  However, this time the encounter turns hostile and again Janeway has to run to the bridge where new surprises await for both her and the ""Voyager"" crew.
On the one hand the explanation behind these bizarre manifestations has a certain logic, but if ""Voyager"" is going to go to the repressed emotions route there should be something more significant to the payoff for the trip.  The biggest upside to the episode is that Kes has something substantial to do away from Sick Bay, even if it still involves the Doctor.  But mind games on ""Star Trek"" should be serious stuff and not involve a few minor jolts and simple mind games.  Besides, I think Janeway needs to find herself a better holonovel (I have a strong preference for Da Vinci over Lord Burleigh).",1057190400,,2249,4.8407310704960835
