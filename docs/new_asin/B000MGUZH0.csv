I have seven other Philippine movies that are well made.  This one was disjointed, hard to follow, subtitles would fly across the screen with not enough time to read.  Overall, it felt like a high school production.  I think I understood what the writer was trying to communicate, the circles of life, but he did not execute well.",1332720000,,466,4.634146341463414
