It has really neat bonus episodes and an interactive book on the screen! We'll have to purchase the next sets soon due to how much the kids are watching it.

Plus, I'm not sure it's the right message to pass on to kids, even when they are not talking about religion at all. The voices and songs are REALLY annoying too. My baby never liked.

I really recommend getting the 'Little People' fisher price DVDs. My baby loves much more, it's super cute and it has a wonderful message of equality and kindness. Songs and voices are cute, calm and soothing.",1440806400,,497,4.584269662921348

5314219,4,B009B8YZR6,"I was excited to get this for my kiddo, after growing up watching these videos as a kid.  Well, okay, as a teenager.  But I still consider them a great childhood memory.  Some of my favorite shows are included here: both of the first Larry-boy shows (Fib from outer space and the Rumor Weed), Josh and the big wall, Dave and the giant pickle, and Madame Blueberry, among others. The first episode of ""3-2-1 Penguins"" is included as well.  I don't really have much to say about the shows themselves other than they're really funny and cute, and teach great lessons while bringing back good memories.

My one complaint is that some aspects of these shows seem to have been ""updated"" or changed from what I remember, and I find it noticeable mostly in the sound quality of the songs.  A lot of the time, the vocals seem different - I don't know if there's some kind of extra processing that's happened, but occasionally it sounds like the character is singing with a bucket over their heads.  Like, there's some kind of echo that wasn't there before.  Also, I feel like there are a few sound effects that weren't there originally, and I also wonder if a few mistakes were made - for example, in the silly song ""Dance of the Cucumber,"" from ""Rack Shack and Benny,"" Larry comes on screen at the very end where he is supposed to say ""Adios, amigos!"" and his lips move but there is no voice.  Just weird, random stuff like that.  As if someone was trying to ""re-master"" the songs and did a shoddy job of putting them all back together.

Another thing I noticed is that the ""Bunny Song""  in ""Rack Shack and Benny"" has been dumbed down from what it originally was (and it's not the ""new and improved Bunny Song"" either).  They seem to have removed the line about ""I won't go to church and I won't go to school"" and maybe also the ""I don't love my mom and dad.""  I get it, it's not the greatest thing for kids to run around singing, but, the song is important to the story.  Otherwise, you have 3 guys getting thrown into a fiery furnace because they won't sing a song about not eating soup or bread.  So, I was kind of annoyed with that too.  It rendered the story pretty lame, unfortunately.

I know, maybe I'm being too picky.  I am one of those people who doesn't want any other version of Star Wars except the completely untouched original where Han shoots first, so this may not be something everyone cares about or notices, but I thought I'd point it out anyway.  It made sense for me to buy this due to the low price and the fact that I have none of the originals, but if I did I'd rather keep the originals.",1389398400,6,2606,4.345041322314049

The price is great since in a lot of stores I found I would only get one video for the same price as I would pay on Amazon for 10. Although on the front it says ""All the Shows"" don't be fooled and think it is all the shows that have been made. There are only ten of them from 1993-1999. Each story is on one disc. 7 Silly Songs are also included. Just like the ones you would watch on VHS. I love the older Veggietales the best so I'm real glad I purchased this for my son. He really enjoys it. The discs also store in the case (it folds open like a book) and I have not had any issues with them falling out of the case like other reviews have stated. They snap in spot in the case.

The shows included are:

1. Where's God When I'm S-scared?? (1993)
2. God Wants Me to Forgive Them ?!? (1994)
3. Are You My Neighbor? (1995)
4. Rack, Shack, & Benny (1995)
