2762302,2,B000NA1W3G,"I finally sat down to watch this sequel during check-in at Morehouse College and I can't say whether or not I was disappointed. This wasn't as sexy as the first, Sean Blakemore simply read his way through the part, and Joe Torry basiclally played the same role he did in Poetic Justice. Brian White gives a dead-on personification of Shemar Moore's role in the first film, so it was believeable that he was an estranged brother. I thought the plot wasn't as tightly wound as the first, but everything seemed to pull together at the end, which kinda didn't make sense: did Connie plan to use Brandon all the while? That was a lingering question for me.

And what was Drew Sidora's role in the movie? I thought her character was way too needy and infrequent for me to care about.",1188000000,,777,4.51063829787234
2762303,3,B000NA1W3G,"The first ""Motives"" was better in my opinion, although, this one did bring about closure to the first one because of what happened to ""Shemar Moore's character in Pt. 1. I was glad to see that justice kind of prevailed.",1183334400,7,219,4.5
2762304,5,B000NA1W3G,If you saw Motives you had plenty of questions about the future well Motives 2 answers those questions. You need to see this if you saw Motives. It picks up a few years later and it gets right into it. Greed will get anyone killed and this movie shows it. No matter who you are the wrong motive will come back on you. You must watch Motives first though. So watch Motives then watch Motives 2 and have a great evening.,1182124800,8,418,4.172839506172839
2762305,3,B000NA1W3G,"I think Motives 2 is an excellent movie, even though, one must have watched Motives 1 to fully understand this twisted mystery. Napping in between settings is most definitely not recommended.....Put on your P.I. thinking cap!",1181779200,2,225,5.277777777777778
2762306,5,B000NA1W3G,This is a good sequel from Motives 1. Do buy. I enjoyed it.,1181606400,,59,3.6153846153846154
2762307,4,B000NA1W3G,"This is the sequel I have been waiting for all year!!!

First, let me say that I am a huge fan of White, Fox, Jackson, Joe Torrey and am encouraged by the work of young filmmakers at ""Rainforest Films.""  If you saw Motives 1, you know that the ground plan was laid out with everyone being a suspect in the murder of Allanah James (Golden Brooks from Girlfriends fame). Kelsy Scott continues with the story from here, revealing more information about the major players and how they each have a motive to get what they want.

Well in Part 2 ""Retribution"" is to be paid by the real Killer, (Blakemore) and boy does he have to pay for what he did (see the movie). Although this one is not as truly as exciting as Part 1 (see the other reviews), it was wonderful to see all these beautiful African American faces do well together (Sharon Leal, etc) on film. It would have been nice to see Shemar in some scenes, because the movie is about him to begin with.

It was a plus to see more of Jackson, he is on his way up in Hollywood. Of course, Joe Torrey steals the show for me (he is the funny man) - in fact I watched it 5 times in a row just so I could see his part and how he lit up the screen with his presence.  Other newcomers presented themselves well on camera too.  The sex scenes were well done (not too much).

Overall, it was not as slick as the first one, but still entertaining. My prediction is that we will discover in Part 3 that Connie, the Lawyer, and Donovan have mastermined this whole thing from the very beginning. Who knows, its just my guess.  We will have to wait and see.

Since there was no 4.5 on the scale, I gave the film 4 pts. Had to take away 1pt because there was no Shemar, and 1pt because it moved too slow, it could have been more suspensful.  But I gave it 1/2 pt because Kelsy Scott did a great job at letting Jackson's (character) be as mean and nasty as he should have been.  It helped the movie a lot.  Then I gave another 1/2 pt because the filmmakers did such a fine job at answering ALL the questions pertaining to the story, some films leave the audience with too too many unanswered questions and its hard to get a feel for having learned something.

Cant wait to see part 3.  This film is worth having in your home movie collection.",1180828800,14,2275,4.176201372997712
2762308,3,B000NA1W3G,"Rent it.  Does not live up to the first one. It would have been great if Shemar Moore's character had been in this one some where.  There was no romance for Vivica and the new husband who supposedley set up Shemar's character all for love of her. Sean Blakemoore's character of Donovan was so so sexy and mysterious in the first one; he was just creepy in this one.  all his machismo was gone.  Rent it.  Watch it twice to understand it.  Buy Motives 1, it is still one of the best black mystery romance suspense movies out there.  I wish Motives 2 was as good.",1180742400,,561,4.235849056603773
2762309,4,B000NA1W3G,"This one is worth the effort if you enjoy African-American themed movies.  It had a great cast and the plot was interesting, though predictable at times.  All-in-all, a pretty good movie to curl up with on a lonely night (the men are great eye candy).  :)",1179705600,,255,4.5
2762310,4,B000NA1W3G,"I didn't give this movie 5-Stars because it falls short when comparing it to the first one. The plot has too many twists and turns in it and it gets down right confusing at times. This is a movie that you have to watch twice to finally ""get."" I had to watch ""Beloved"" a couple of times before I ""got"" it. It could have been a lot better but it just wasn't.

It would have been nice if Brian White's character, Donovan, had a relationship with his brother, Emory (Shemar Moore), and had a desire to avenge his downfall. His quest appeared to be forced upon him. The movie was nearly over when he finally showed some type of emotion regarding his brother's death. Also, it was never revealed why Donovan and his brother drifted apart for so many years.

This movie also had too many 'conveniences.' It was too convenient for Joe Torry's character to break into a house and download incriminating files from a computer. It was too convenient that Emory had a long lost brother that no one had ever heard of before to leave all of his assets to. It was also convenient that there was evidence of another person being at the crime scene (in the first ""Motives"") after Emory died. Weren't the police suspicious when his ex-wife married his best friend, Brandon (Sean Blakemore), the guy he claimed set him up? And what exactly happened to Emory? How was he killed in prison? Who killed him and why? And why wasn't a background check done on Brandon before he was employed and promoted at a prestigious company? And what happened to the money the police took away from Joe Torry's character? This movie left too many unanswered questions.

Also, it would have been nice if Donovan hadn't cheated on his girlfriend. He got with a co-worker then went home and kissed on his girl like it was nothing. Brandon was unfaithful also but that was expected of him.

I gave it 4-Stars instead of 3 because of Brian White. He is an excellent actor and he's very easy on the eye. All of the actors did a great job, although it was hard for me to look at Vivica's new lips.

This movie (like a lot of sequels) did not quite live up to the original but it is entertaining. Unless you are just a die-hard Brian White fan, I would recommend renting this movie before buying it.",1178582400,2,2254,4.434782608695652

2762409,4,B000NA1W3G,"This movie was okay, but definitely not as good as the original....maybe because I'm such a huge Shemar Moore fan and killing him off was depressing....except the individuals who set him up in ""Motives"" got exactly what they deserved.",1407628800,,234,5.0256410256410255

2762426,5,B000NA1W3G,"I like this movie too, as well as the first movie that that was filmed. I like the fact that this 2nd movie is a sequel to the first movie. With this movie the plot thickens from the first movie. The dramatic conclusion was well written as well as the actors and actress portrayed their part very well. Ms. Fox & Mr. White took the lead in their rolls, without forgetting about Mr. Moore who is also a well known actor, as well as he's eye candy for all the ladies out there.

Despite this drabby film I did enjoy Sean Blakemore(Brandon Collier) and Mel Jackson's performance.  This film just didn't do it for me.,1219881600,,390,4.594202898550725
2762459,4,B000NA1W3G,"I didn't completely understand everything in this film until I watched it twice.  It's considerably more complex than Motives.  It's full of intrigue and I like how the story progresses.  Very intelligently gone and classy.  The acting was fair, but some of the scenes were badly made (particularly the fighting scences).  I don't want to see a sequel to this but would love to see more films of this type (African American erotic thrillers).",1209859200,,442,4.918918918918919
