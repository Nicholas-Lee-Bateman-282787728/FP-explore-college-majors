7863251,2,6304158955,"Maris the Chojo is one of renowned manga artist Ms. Rumiko Takahashi's early works. The original manga version is simple, short, and sweet. Unfortunately, the anime version I'm reviewing now is the exact opposite. While the zany plot is more or less retained, the execution is what kills the MTC anime. Things unfold slowly, and everything just gets so long-winded. There are lots of useless panning through scenes where characters traverse - whether walking on land or flying through space. I marvel at how they managed to extend a very short manga story to a 45-minute anime feature. The art and animation are okay. The overall look and feel are somewhat dated but it's generally not bad.",1001203200,,690,4.905982905982906
7863252,5,6304158955,"Actually, there aren't enough ""girl too strong for her own good"" animes for me.  Can't think of any others with that exact theme, in fact, and it's a really fun one.  This anime explores that theme and many other interesting ones, including how money doesn't make you a better person.  And as far as strength, Maris is truly in the extreme class, like 1,000,000x plus, and here we have a number of impressive fights and accidents to show it off, and they're all fun.  She can hardly move without breaking something.  This VHS suffers from the usual lame dubbed soundtrack, but it's all you can get.  Order it now to encourage them to make a DVD version.  Unfortunately this seems to be falling below the radar, but it's great.  I'd love to have this in DVD with the original sound and subtitles.  And lots more amime girls actually using and misusing extreme strength a lot.",994291200,,874,4.587096774193548
