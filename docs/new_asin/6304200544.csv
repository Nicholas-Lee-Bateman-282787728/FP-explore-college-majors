808970,4,6304200544,"Many consider Shaft the icon of blaxploitation flicks.  And as much as I like him, I feel Fred Williamson is the true tough guy of blaxploitation.  He's tough, suave, menacing, and smokes a cigar!  I'd start out with Black Caesar or Hell Up in Harlem, but this film  is great.  Seeing him together with Pam grier(I've always had a thing for her), Roundtree, and O'Neal(Priest, man!) is awsome.  Watching these guys go toe to toe with young gang banger punks who think they're really something is a treat.  In the end they show us who the original gangstas really are!  This was brought to you by the guy who made the It's Alive movies(Remember? About the mutant babies?) and The Stuff(Remember that one?  About the addictive killer dessert?) and writer of the upcoming Phonebooth movie.  You must see it, you must!",1047340800,,814,4.709219858156028
808971,4,6304200544,"The reason to watch this movie is the reunion for those of  us who remember the protagonists from the era of blaxploitation  films in which we were introduced to them/  Fred Williamson, Jim Brown, Pam Grier, reconvene to take back their home town of Gary, Indiana from several well organized and terribly violent street gangs.
Also appearing in almost cameo roles are Ron O'Neal (""Superfly"") and Richard Roundtree (the original John Shaft).  Seeing them all together is a treat, but left me wondering why this quintet did not get more screen time all together.  It is particularly pleasing to see Brown and Grier, who, as one of the expert reviewers noted, have aged very very well.  However, the re-ignition of their former relationship is tepid and seemingly forced.  By contrast, it has nowhere near the intensity seen when barely restrained Brown confronts a gang leader about the murder of his son.
I agree that the simplistic plot and the consistent (and predictable) violence keep this from being one of the great films of our time.  Those who remember the first time seeing these individuals in character now some thirty years ago will enjoy seeing them all together again, and that makes this disc worthwhile.",1036368000,10,1218,4.936274509803922
808972,3,6304200544,"This is something like a re-union party of the so-called blaxploitation film stars, which shows the whole world that those guys and ladies are still sexy and strong enough to teach some lessons to the young, disrespectful punks in the neighborhood of the city of Gary, Indiana.  That's all about the story, which is as uninspired as any B-action flicks.  ""Original"" gangstas come back to town, to fight against the ""new"" gangstars that rule the street with terror.
The charm of the film lies in the cast, which looks a dream team for any fans of the 1970s blaxploitaion films.  Here they are back in good form:
  Fred Williamson (""Black Caesar""), Jim Brown (""Slaughter""), Pam Grier (""Coffy""), Richard Roundtree (""Shaft"") and Ron O'Neil (""Superfly"")
and you got also players like Robert Forster (who in the following year makes a smashing collaboration with Pam Grier in ""Jackie Brown"") and Wings Hauser in his very unlikely role.  It is a gift from the heaven for the movie fans like me.
Before you watch, however, be warned.  The film is virtually lead by Fred Williamson's character, and his screen time is the longest of the five (and this film is co-produced by him).  Jim Brown and Pam Grier are given fair chance of doing something better than cameo roles, but Roundtree and O'Neil both appear very short.  Though the ""re-union"" film will please the fans of the stars, director Larry Cohen barely manages to shoot those five stars in a single frame only once, but perhaps that's the best he could do.
As many other Cohen's films are, ""Original Gangstas"" is based on a good idea, but put into practice in a not-so-good way.  It starts solidly, but gradually gets confused and unnecessarily violent.  Nevertheless, for the people who love those stars, the film somehow delivers.  I only wish that Tim Barton or Quention Tarantino would do the same thing.",1033171200,2,1858,4.826498422712934

I particularly liked his 'hard hitting' style and the white shoes he always wore (he and Joe Namath) so when I began playing sports (Baseball and Football) in school I tried to model myself after him by always wearing white shoes.  Also, I own almost all of his movies from 'back in the day' (Hammer, Black Caesar, Hell Up In Harlem, Bucktown, etc...) and I needed ""Original Gangstas"" to add to my collection.  It's got so many of the 'Old School Blaxploitation' stars from 'back in the day' in it (Pam Grier, Richard Roundtree, Jim Brown and the late greats Paul Winfield and Ron O'Neal).

Seeing them all together in one film was amazing for me, and bought many smiles to my face. It was good to see Richard Roundtree (the original Shaft), and the late Ron O'Neal (Superfly).

809382,1,6304200544,"Larry Cohen directed several blacksploitation films in the 1970s, including two with football star Fred Williamson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Caesar/dp/B000053VB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Caesar</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hell-Up-in-Harlem/dp/B00005N7Z6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hell Up in Harlem</a>). 1996's Original Gangstas is a reunion of sorts for Cohen and Williamson, and they invited several other luminaries to the party: Pam Grier (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coffy/dp/B000053VB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coffy</a>), Jim Brown (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slaughter/dp/B000053VBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slaughter</a>), and Richard Roundtree (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaft/dp/0790743752/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaft</a>). We also get veteran actors Robert Forster, Charles Napier, Paul Winfield, and more. That all sounds great in principle, at least for a devoted fan of the genre. Unfortunately, reality comes knocking fairly early in the film. Like, right after the opening credits.

Original Gangstas predated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jackie-Brown/dp/B000068DBD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jackie Brown</a>&nbsp;by just one year. The two are light-years apart in terms of directing and production value, however, despite Tarantino's film having barely twice as much money to spend (12 million vs 5 million). But as much as I dig the classics--I reviewed a dozen classic blacksploitation flicks recently--some things are best left in the past. The acting here is wooden, and most of the young actors are cookie-cutter caricatures. The violence is harsh and unbelievable. For an edgy but excellent urban coming of age film, see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Presidents/dp/1558908390/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Presidents</a>&nbsp;or even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Bronx-Tale/dp/6304884419/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Bronx Tale</a>.

Paul Winfield and Isabel Sanford did pretty good as well in one of their last performances in movies.  May their souls rest in peace.

809467,3,6304200544,"I really wanted this movie to be great. I really felt that it had the potential. And you know, it started out pretty good. But the longer the movie goes the weaker it got. It was almost like they started with half a script and when theu got to the end of that they just winged the rest.

The premise of the film is that a gang called the rebels had pretty much taken over the streets of this urban Indiania neighborhood. They are extremely bad and horrifically violent and refuse to let anyone get in their way. One citizen see's one of the gang kill a high school basketball star and calls the cops. The gang retailiates by trashing his store, beating him up, shooting him, and leaving him for dead. Enter John Bookman.

Bookman (Fred Williamson) is the son of the shop owner, an ex-NFL football star, and, it turns out, the original leader of the rebels some 30 years ago. He returns home to find a war zone. After failing to start a dialog with the gang with the help of the local preacher (Paul Winfield) he turns to his old comrads-in-arms to try and take back the streets.

Joined by his best friend from the gang days (Jim Brown), who has his own demons to over come (the son he never knew had just been killed by the gang) they begin to orchestrate a neighborhood revolt. Joining them is Brown's old girlfriend and the mother of his son (Pam Grier), and a couple of ex-gang members (Richard Roundtree, Ron O'Neal).

Here is where the problems begin for this movie. After this great set-up it starts to deteriorate into just pure violence. A previous reviewer says this movie has a ""deep message."" What's the message, that you have to become as vicious and brutal as the gang you're trying to stop? We see people being executed with a bullet to the brain, burned, having their necks snapped, knifed, beaten with baseball bats, and just gunned down in a all-out hail of gunfire. As the heroes continue their onslaught we see that in the end, they really are no less violent and brutal as the gang. In the final scenes we find Williamson & Brown in a fight with the two current gang leaders while a rival gang looks on. Once they dispose of the hoodlums finally the police, missing completely during the firefight, show up. What started out good ended silly. What a shame.

I would recommend this only to those who are either into Blaxploitation movies or if you have about 100 minutes to kill. Not bad but just could have been SO much better",1175212800,,2447,4.44097995545657

Williamson is John Bookman, a former hood who made it to the big time with his smooth football skills. But when the gang that he had created/founded back in his hometown starts shooting at members of his family - including his father - he returns to his old turf, meets with his old partners in crime and walks into an all-out street war to clean up his neighborhood to its rightful state of justice!

809475,3,6304200544,"Original Gangstas:  Fred Williamson, Jim Brown, Pam Grier. Williamson is John Bookman, former football pro turned coach, who comes back to his old hometown to find it overrun by gangs. The last straw is when Bookman's dad is assaulted and his grocery store vandalized.  Grier is the mom of a basketball prodigy slain by the Rebels, one of three major gangs in the city.  Brown is Bookman's best friend who comes back to bury his son. In a touch of irony, the gangs are the modern day incarnation of the crews started by Bookman & his friends decades ago. But whereas the original intent was to be a teen militia of sorts, the modern crews-mostly people well over 21--  are about nothing but victimizing their neighborhood.
Filmed entirely on location in Gary, Indiana, the film uses many city landmarks to illustrate the decay that has taken place.  The film rightly postulates that the abrupt downsizing of the US Steel mill in the late 60's started an economic domino effect that the city has yet to recover from.  Abandoned storefronts still abound, while neighborhoods are peppered with derelict houses and other rag-tag buildings.
Supporting roles are offered by Robert Forster as a police detective, and Ron O'Neal & Richard Roundtree as longtime residents who join the effort to take the city back.
Williamson and his contemporaries first came to prominence in the black action movie trend of the 70's.  Some of his real life was slipped into the script: Williamson was a Northwestern football star before turning pro; also, according to the star the film was inspired from an encounter he had while visiting his mother, who still lives in Gary.
Fred and the actors of his generation deserve better from the Hollywood industry-- folks like Spike Lee, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez have used them in a handful of contemporary films, but they should have the status of a Clint Eastwood or Burt Reynolds..",1067212800,,1918,4.901234567901234

Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson, Jim Brown, Pam ""Foxxy Brown"" Grier, Richard ""Shaft"" Roudntree, and Superfly himself, Ron O'Neal. A host of other infamous character actors and some of today's big name underground rappers also show up for this bullet-riddled nostalgia pic.
It's ""old school"" versus ""new school"" as the Rebels, a gang once known simply for protecting their neighborhood has transformed into a gang of thugs who specialize in drive-by shootings and drug dealing. This doesn't sit well with the gang's founding members who reunite with the support of the community to clean up the streets once and for all.
While not nearly as energetic and entertaining as many of the 70's pics that it is paying homage to, ""Original Gangstas"" does have fun while delivering a solid anti-violence message. Seeing all your old favorites strap up again makes for some real good times. There are also some good performances from relative unknowns like Christopher Duncan as the leader of the new Rebels and rapper Dru Down as the group's loud-mouthed ""trigger man"".
