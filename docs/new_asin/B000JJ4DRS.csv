8150799,1,B000JJ4DRS,"I should have known better when I didn't see a picture on the back of this DVD. This acting was the worst I have seen in the last 10 years. The main character couldn't act so you know that is the kiss of death for a film. The cinematography was a rookie at best. The story line was from a historic figure but could have done better much better. Elizabeth the blood queen could have made such a interesting story. If a real director actually did it on the caliber of Frances ford Coppola or Neil Jordon. This movie really really should not get any consideration please do your eyes a favor stay clear of this film. Do not rent, entertain, or buy this movie and I love B movies for the adventure of new discoveries but this is a waste.

8150800,3,B000JJ4DRS,"This film was pretty predictable, had horrible acting, but the storyline and the plot were pretty original, and the filmwork was pretty good.  This tells the tale of a post-apocalypse massive power grid failure world where people live in kingdoms again, much like the middle ages. Howerver, these kingdoms are Counties, and this one in particular is ran by a former model from new york who returned home.  Is she a good leader, or just a puppet.  Take a look at this film, but I would recommend borrowing it, or cheap rental, unless you like cult-following B films.",1180224000,,565,4.744897959183674
8150801,2,B000JJ4DRS,"APOCALYPSE AND THE BEAUTY QUEEN is supposedly loosely based upon the 16th Century ruler, Elizabeth Bathory--""The Blood Countes"".  The movie is set in a not-too distant future where governments and other ruling bodies have collapsed and people have been left to fend and survive for themselves in a world that has regressed to a Dark Ages mentality.  Amber (Beverly Hynds) was a former New York model who returned to her hometown after the collapse and led and organized the citizens in the area back towards civilization.  However, she becomes seduced by vanity and power.  Meanwhile a new revolution seems ready to break out while a cold blooded killer is kidnapping beautiful young women, killing them, and bathing in their blood.

APOCALYPSE AND THE BEAUTY QUEEN desperately wants to be seen as a hip and artsy romantic thriller.  That's the type of movie the filmmakers seem to have been wanting to make.  Unfortunately, that's not the film that ended up as the finished project.  The film does have an aesthetic appeal, but it takes itself so seriously that it's a caricature of what it was meant to be.

The worst part of the film is the writing.  The dialogue is terrible. I've watched junior high students produce films for class that have had better dialogue than is in the movie.  The bad writing seeps into other parts of the film and taints them, too.  Take the acting for example.  There are a few decent performances in the movie (Gunnar Hansen, the original Leatherface of the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE films gives one of the best performances in the movie), but much of the acting is second-rate at best.  These performances combined with the terrible writing make for laugh-out hilarity.  Except most of these laugh out moments are meant to be funny, they are supposed to be taken seriously.  Of course, there's the general plot of the movie much of which doesn't make any sense at all.  The films ending raises causes some huge plot holes and eliminates any sensibility at all.

APOCALYPSE AND THE BEAUTY QUEEN does have some appeal.  The production value isn't too bad and some of the cinematic techniques are well done.  Beyond that, it's one of those movies that could develop a cult following because ""it's so bad, it's good.""  The film also has value as a picture you can use for your own MYSTERY SCIENCE 3000 viewings.  Other than that, unless you a fan of Gunnar Hansen or any of the other principals involved, this is a movie you are better off not seeing at all.",1172966400,3,2487,4.748251748251748
8150802,1,B000JJ4DRS,"Although it is visually captivating, the storyline couldn't be worse. If you are DYING to see it - rent it, it's not a buy.",1170115200,5,123,4.166666666666667
8150803,4,B000JJ4DRS,"I am a fan of this TYPE of movie. When I saw it in ST. Louis it was beyond what I expected. I love the scream queen and she fulfilled her role. If anyone knows more from this directer please advise. Its a ""must have"" for the independant film lover.",1168214400,2,248,3.98
8150804,5,B000JJ4DRS,"Smugala's brilliance in visual storytelling is highlighted in a stunning and stylistic film. Unique juxtaposition of raw images and gorgeous colors are a sight to see. The story is based sometime in the future when the future is not what you would expect. An uncivilized decrepit world ruled by a strong armed queen and fueding warlords, a world where sex and guns are the currency and power is the goal. See it, enjoy it.. love it or leave it. Not your typical mainstream drama.",1167868800,3,479,4.714285714285714
