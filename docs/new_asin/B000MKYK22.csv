2736342,5,B000MKYK22,"BCI Eclipse's Ink & Paint presents the action-packed conclusion to the quintessential `80s cartoon series, Defenders of the Earth.  Volume 2's snazzy purple slipcover houses four double-sided discs and one single-sided disc in three slim cases.  Each case is lavishly decorated with one or two of the program's junior stars: Rick, Jedda, LJ and Kshin.  The content on these DVD's is at least as entertaining as the first half of the collection, if not more so.  Here, you'll find out how Mandrake came to adopt Kshin, see Jedda become The Phantom, and learn valuable life-lessons about responsibility, teamwork, good citizenship, and the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse.  Episodes include: ""The Gods Awake;"" ""The Ghost Walks Again;"" ""Flash Times Four;"" ""The Frozen Heart;"" ""Rick Gordon, One-Man Army;"" ""The Rites of Zesnan;"" ""Audie and Tweak;"" ""Return of the Sky Band;"" ""Dracula's Potion;"" ""One of the Guys;"" ""100 Proof Highway;"" ""The Time Freezer;"" ""The Prince Makes His Move;"" ""The Prince Triumphant;"" ""The Prince Weds;"" ""The Prince's Royal Hunt;"" ""The Prince Dethroned;"" ""Lothar's Homecoming;"" ""Suspended Sabotage;"" ""Call of the Eternals;"" ""The Return of Doctor Dark;"" ""The Deadliest Battle;"" ""The Necklace of Oros;"" ""Torn Space;"" ""Ming Winter;"" ""The Golden Queen;"" ""The Gravity of Ming;"" ""Flesh and Blood;"" ""The Drowning World;"" ""The Adoption of Kshin;"" ""Street Smarts;"" and ""The Thunderlizards of Ming.""  Volume Two also contains episode 1 of Filmation's `Flash Gordon'--which was supposed to have been on Volume One, but wasn't--as well as a ""Bonus Movie,"" which will be redundant if you own the previous Defenders set since it's just the first few episodes of the series edited together.  Animation buffs will enjoy the interesting interviews with Bruce Malek, David Wise and Michael Swanigan...not to mention the original model sheets, scripts, storyboards and trivia. You even get a full-color, meticulously detailed episode guide and two groovy 4x6-inch art cards!  Call forth the power of ten tigers, and order both Defenders of the Earth volumes today!",1186790400,9,2066,5.414330218068536

8169555,5,B000MKYK22,"The item arrived in stated condition and it arrived incredibly fast.  No problems whatsoever and would do business with this seller again.  As for the product itself, Defenders of the Earth holds up suprisingly well after all these years.  A fine addition to any animation library/collection.",1367712000,,292,5.304347826086956
8169556,4,B000MKYK22,"Hi, Finally, I have both vol. and i can now have hours of fun. I thougth that i would not be able to find this item since the company no longer exists. Set is perfect and complete as advertaised,I am very please with my buy. Thank you!!",1286755200,,236,4.042553191489362
8169557,3,B000MKYK22,"I selected this title out of a feeling of nostalgia.  Saying that, it was a fun but breif enough walk down memory lane for me.  If you had watchecd it when you where younger, or have young children around then I would recommend these shows.  They have a moral stance and enjoyable stories that don't become to preachy on the whole.  The animation isn't bad for its time, and the cast has plenty of flaws that can be played on.",1279584000,2,426,4.2875
8169558,4,B000MKYK22,"This volume has more of the multi-arc stories and the PSAs.  It completes the first volume so if you've got one you might as well get the other.

The extras on this one were fun.  More than one commentary would have been nice and the Defenders logo fade was annoying during the interviews but I enjoyed going through the storyboards in the DVD-ROM features.",1227052800,2,357,4.546875
8169559,5,B000MKYK22,"These animated series from the 80s were cool, better than most of the actual ones, good for the kids even for the new generation.",1222732800,2,129,4.416666666666667
8169560,4,B000MKYK22,"Like my title suggests, Defenders of the earth is just like I remembered it when I was younger. It's a cool concept, with good action, but alot of cheese though. My complaint was that Ming was the main villain and he pretty much wasn't that great. Now they have his son who isn't much better, but a change. Then you have the return of Villains from season 1 which adds to it. And the theme song still rocks!",1189814400,5,407,4.230769230769231
