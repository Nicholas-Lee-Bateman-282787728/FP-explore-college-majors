If you like older movies this has color and loads of entertainment don't let the bad reviews get you down I could watch this more than once",1473465600,,336,4.014925373134329

8086188,2,B000BFJM30,"There are so many better films that haven't made it to dvd. This was filmed in 1999, through soup and onto VHS, to fill some awful straight-to-video foreign crap genre that tricks moms into getting it and boring their entire family.  Luckily video stores are gone...",1364515200,,266,4.782608695652174
8086189,4,B000BFJM30,"The other negative reviews notwithstanding, this is one of our favorite films. It is definitely a lightweight work, along the lines of those great British ""B movies"" with the likes of Alec Guinness and Charles Laughton. It should not be compared with ""Master and Commander"" (I wonder who would form that expectation? and I wonder which film will have more true longevity?) but with ""Operation Petticoat"" or ""All at Sea"". Once you accept that it has a typical British B-movie silly plot, and typical British B-movie production values (unbelievable storms, etc.), you can settle back to enjoy the characters, the story, and your popcorn. It is just what it should be: light, fluffy fun...with some nice scenery thrown in.",1324166400,,719,5.050420168067227
8086190,3,B000BFJM30,"The 1999 British release 'Captain Jack' starring Bob Hoskins is a well intentioned, family genre film that attempts to concoct a storyline virtually out of nothing, relying solely on the talents of Captain Jack (i.e.: Bob Hoskins) to keep you entertained until the closing credits roll by. Needless to say it doesn't work. Fifteen or twenty minutes into the film the antics of the irrespressable Captain start to wear a little thin and one begins to look around for someone, or something else in the cast to help keep the poor boat afloat. Alas there's no rescue for this storyline as far as the eye can see.

Bottom line: Admitedly I'm being overly critical here. I did give it -3 Stars- afterall. It's not that it's a bad film, it just doesn't succeed at elicting that ""feel good"" emotion from the audience that it's shooting for. 'Captain Jack' is watchable but if given the opportunity for a repeat cruise with the good captain I believe I'd let this one set sail without me.",1310515200,,979,4.658959537572255
8086191,5,B000BFJM30,Inspirational story based on true events. Bob Hoskins gives a great performance in the tilte role. Great film for the whole family.,1235433600,,131,5.0
8086192,1,B000BFJM30,"I so much wanted to like this movie. I was hoping for another ""Captain Ron"" or ""Master and Commander"" type move but instead it was overly sentimental, corny and just awful. I know I am going to get panned for this review, but the movie was so bad I want Captain Jack to give me my two hours back. The acting was acceptable (especially Bob Hoskins), but the plot and script were so poor and stupid that once they left port I was hoping the boat would sink with all hands lost just so I wouldn't have to tolerate any more. It was so sentimental, so wistful it was painful. How much 'Ah' can you stand when there is no reason to be 'Ahing'? A dreadful movie.",1214179200,,655,4.165354330708661
