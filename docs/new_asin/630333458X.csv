7843709,1,630333458X,"This version has the sides chopped off of it to force it into the 1.33:1 aspect ratio.  I thought they'd learned to at least offer the full movie these days, but I guess not.  I didn't pay full price to only get 2/3rds (or less) of the movie though!",1145923200,6,249,4.061224489795919
7843710,2,630333458X,"This is a descendant of the 1980's teen pic crossed with 1990's grunge directed by Daniel Algrant, with Eric Stoltz having left his girlfriend Mary-Louise Parker and while driving, reminisces, narrating to the camera. There are flashbacks to his childhood, his relationship, and the production of an autobiographical off-Broadway play ""Master of my Emotions"" (with such a title you know it's bound to flop, unless it is meant as an indication of the self-indulgence of some off-Broadway productions). Only the latter subplot brings this film some degree of interest since as characters Stoltz and Parker are dull, limp, dull. This performance makes you long for Peter Bogdanovich's Mask cos at least in that film Stoltz' makeup gave him something, and Parker appears to be doing Diane Keaton's Annie Hall schtick, using big eyes and odd hand movements. As Stoltz' mother, Jill Clayburgh is keen but given nothing to do except wear a lot of jewellry for eccentricity - get it? In the off-Broadway scenes we get a series of cameos. It's great to see Tony Curtis as the show's producer and his boxer intonation, cheeky smile and silver hair is a delight. Kathleen Turner as the play's lead actor brings some energy, and she carries a drag queen air. Algrant uses her movie-star glamour and pug-ugly face for comic effect. As Stoltz' friend, Ralph Macchio is a true surprise after those terrible Karate Kid titles. His violent reaction to news of his being fired suggests what Macchio might have brought to the Stoltz role, and his scenes with Stoltz carry real sexual tension. Timothy Dalton has a few scenes as a wolf and his snake eyes and dark features hint at a masculinity that his efforts as James Bond lack. Agrant tries for amiability by populating the soundtrack with groovy music and his sensibility includes fantasy and dream, a talking orangutang, stone faces come to life with the help of Whoopi Goldberg, a mariachi band, blackouts, squirrels and a nut factory, an amusing lazy-Susan editing technique, and parties attended by New York literati, including the ubiquitous Quentin Crisp.",993254400,13,2096,5.025862068965517
7843711,4,630333458X,"This is a great film to watch if you're into 'reality' films. The script has a very real feel to it, in the sense that its goal isn't to solve problems or to give everyone a warm fuzzy feeling.  Its goal is to show you 'yeah, no one has it all together (although some have it together better than others).
The actors do a great job with the matierial, and the script is well written.  I warn in advance that this is a film without a traditional 'plot', so if you don't like films where there's more talking than anything else, you may not like this film.
If you're patient with films, and aren't looking to be entertained, give Naked in New York a try.",992822400,9,652,4.208
