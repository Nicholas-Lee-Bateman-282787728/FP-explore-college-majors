As the parent of a young man who was diagnosed at the age of 18 with Aspergers, this film was critical for our being able to open the dialogue-creating learning elements for all involved.  I highly recommend this film and have actually bought several extra copies of it to add to my Autism Spectrum lending library.  Praise needs to be given to Taylor Cross for having the bravery to put himself out there in order to create this film.  Thank you, Joey Travolta, for seeing that Taylor's original short film deserved a longer treatment and in depth delivery.",1477008000,2,648,4.657894736842105

8335739,5,B001QIP5C8,"I liked this documentary.  Taylor interviewed sixty five people  ranging from pre teens to adults, who have varying degrees of autism. Questions ranged from how they felt having the disorder to hopes for the future. The subjects gave interesting insight and had a wide perpective. I liked their honesty about how they felt about having the disorder. I also got insight from how the parents felt about their autistic kids. Their perspectives were quite touching. The interviews were informative and entertaining. The only thing that bothered me a bit was outdated information. For example, When Taylor's child therapist was explaining  the rates of autism she said it is 1 in 166 which was the rate at the time of the documentary; however according to the most recent CDC numbers (Center for disease control and prevention)the rates are now 1 in 110. If you are looking for a documentary that is entertaining and has good insight in to autism I highly recommend Normal People Scare Me.",1310256000,4,984,4.951515151515151
