7919799,5,B00004CIM1,"If you like surfing and the especially surfing history this DVD is a must.  George Greenough is one of a few truly classic characters in the amazing sport of surfing.  George was/is an innovator, designer, builder, adventurer, film maker.  Regarding the essence of the organic surfing experience, George got it, and gave it back to those of us who followed in his wake.  Yeah George!  And ""Echos"" from Pink Floyd?  How good can a surfing film be?  In this case, real good!  Enjoy.",1395619200,,480,4.698795180722891
7919800,5,B00004CIM1,"This guy, is amazing.  His talent in the surf is something I'll enjoy for years.  Plus...everything goes better with Pink Floyd.  Echo's is perfect background music for this awesome production.",1374537600,,193,5.366666666666666
7919801,5,B00004CIM1,"Fantastic Surfing Video shot by Geoge Greenough back in the early 70's. This cult classic has always been difficult to find here in the US. You will need a VCR that is capable of playing all region codes because Region Code is set for Austrialia, or convert it to DivX if you VCR plays DivX video. I had seen watched this 20 years ago with fellow surfers in Hawaii. It is fantastic. Especially the last 22 minutes where George used Pink Floyd's Echoes as background music!",1329868800,2,472,4.5
7919802,5,B00004CIM1,"I was living in Oxford, England when this movie came out and saw it because the Floyd did the music - I had no idea what to expect... It was a movie that changed my life - since then I have traveled all over the world, been places that I never even knew existed, and done many wonderful things - my life changed the instant that I saw this movie... not because it's a ""great"" movie, it isn't - but because it showed a different world to the one that I knew as a callow youth - if there is one message in this movie, it is that it's not what you DO in this live that creates happiness, it's how you live your life within the framework of this wonderful world.

Don't expect a plot or a story in the movie - a life well lived has neither - you don't need a different consciousness to watch the movie... all you need is a willingness to accept that when you walk with beauty and an open heart then something wonderful will walk beside you.  God, I love DVDs!",1157155200,8,955,4.0476190476190474
7919803,3,B00004CIM1,"I bought this film simply because I'm a Pink Floyd fan - the epic 23min piece ""Echoes"" makes up one block of the sound-track for this film.

There's minimal storyline. The first 50 mins is one of George Greenough's views on surfing, with loads of shots of him doing just that, along with him building a boat, which he then sails with two mates, including champion surfer, the Australian, Nat Young.

The next part of the film features great under-water shots, made surreal by the aforementioned Pink Floyd music. It's a trip, man.",1154217600,4,530,4.688172043010753
7919804,4,B00004CIM1,"Though not really an entertaining film, Crystal Voyager is definitely one for true fans of film to see. The documentary/story is not completely boring, but it really doesn't go much further than ""I base my life upon surfing."" What the film has are a bunch of very intriguing shots of waves: from afar, close-up, inside, and underneath. The added bonus of Pink Floyd's ""Echoes"" over the end of the film is just that: an added bonus to a neat film.",1129593600,,446,4.5875
