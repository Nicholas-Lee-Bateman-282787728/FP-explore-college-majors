2218624,4,B0007LPSJU,An interesting story....good acting & presentation.......certainly an interesting movie for those who were around during the events of this period in time.,1207353600,2,155,6.090909090909091
2218625,5,B0007LPSJU,"I have always been fascinated by the Kennedy women, this biopic is perhaps the most dignified and relevant works on the lives of the wives of the Kennedy brothers. Particularly well done is the portrayal of Joan. The careful balance given by Leslie Stephanson is masterful and beautifully paced and insightful. Lauren Holly's brash and lovable Ethel makes Robert's devotion understandable. Finally we are given a Jackie through Jill Hennessy that is not just a collage of mannerisms based on television clips! Thom Christopher's tight writing is not a sentimental journey but an enchanting examination of extraordinary women placed in extraordinary circumstances by virtue of their exoteric partners.",1202860800,12,700,5.4907407407407405

Give me strength! The kennedys must be rolling in their graves at a poorly scripted, over cliched, stiffly acted and if that wasn't enough , BAD wigged women portaying the 'strong but suffering Kennedy women""

Whether or not Ethel Kennedy did have a voice similar to a munchkin with sand in its throat,  I don't think Lauren Hollys version gave the woman much credibility. In fact I wished someone had of anethetised her throat or I would have put my head through a window.

BAD wig of the series goes to the Jill Henessy who played the role of Jackie Kennedy.  All the money spent on production and they couldn't get the poor girl a decent wig and a good onion to make her tears over Jacks death look beleivable.

And Leslie Stephanson.....the poor misunderstood Joan hitting the bottle over the cruel remarks about her worth and her intelligence. Why hit the bottle........she could have hit the road.

All the scripted stereotyping that the viewer could ever want created a sea of slop that in the end needed a bucket beside the chair of the viewer.

The winner of the bad accent award goes to the kennedy men who put the rhouw onto ""yask"" and ""caarnt"" and ""pawt"".  They must of worked hard to get it sooooo OTT.

Buy it but don't expect much except a good nights sleep.  Better than benzos and not as addictive,.",1200441600,,1473,5.0246913580246915
2218627,4,B0007LPSJU,"Jill Hennsey played wonderul role protraying Jackie Kennedy. It gives the viewer a part in the movie itself as there is good drama, and role acting. I felt part of the film myself. Excellent. The story is well written, and gives the many facts that the public hadn't known during the Kennedy era. I was in 7th grade when Pres. Jack Kennedy was assisin. It was a horrible day that afternoon, that we were dismiss from class early and sent home. The church bells rang out in morning. I will never forget that day. I enjoyed the movie very well. Execept for Marilyln Monroe, the part of her character didnt' look like the real one. But it was a fine job too.",1199059200,,655,4.377049180327869
2218628,5,B0007LPSJU,"Covering much of the same territory as other biopics on the Kennedys, THE WOMEN OF CAMELOT goes more in depth on the three,Jackie,Ethel and Joan who were married to Jack,Bobby and Teddy respectively. Though this 3 hour series hits all of the well known ""hot spots"" that occurred during the years 1953-1979, what this series does best is to keep the focus squarely on the women and their dealings with each other,their trusts and  mistrusts with the Kennedy clan and their needs ,wants and desires that individually fueled them while being married to the most powerful family in America. The casting is outstanding. All three actresses have done a marvelous job at capturing the ladies language,look and movement. This film breezes through material quickly, but not in a way that characters are left undeveloped. History is not sacrificed and neither is character enrichment. Well done and worth the bargain price you pay.",1185667200,23,921,5.059210526315789
2218629,5,B0007LPSJU,"This story stays pretty close to the book, which was great.  You read alot about the husbands, it's interesting to see the women's side of things.  I loved it.",1167782400,2,159,4.448275862068965
2218630,5,B0007LPSJU,"A most fascinating look a the Kennedy empire from the wives point of view. Based on the book by J. Randy Taraborrelli Jackie, Ethel, Joan - Involving extensive research, including interviews with those closest to the Kennedy family, oral histories from the JFK libraries and revealing personal letters and tapes. The DVD is 3 hours in length. Stereo surround and picture quality are excellent. Cinematagrophy is completely mesmerizing, with every scene similar to a historic color photograph. From the viewers point of view, the film creates a secret glimpse into the three women's lives. Outstandingly cast.",1114041600,15,608,5.34375
2218641,1,B0007LPSJU,"I've never watched any of the biopics of the Kennedys as I've felt that if they are at all factual then they're intrusive, and those that aren't are speculative, based almost entirely on hearsay, usually from gossipy former friends, rivals, or employees. This movie reinforced my desire to continue to avoid them. I was impressed with Jill Hennessey's Jackie and Leslie Stefanson's Joan, though I'm not sure what direction was given to Lauren Holly, except maybe ""crass, shrill, annoying harpy"" to prompt such an unpleasant rendering of Ethel. ""Rose"" was badly miscast, bearing no resemblance in any way to the real woman other than hair color. ""Bobby"" looked older than Jack and slightly lecherous. Despite the fact that Jackie went to great lengths to lead as private and normal a life as possible after 1963, her life and the tragedies she endured have too often been fodder for ratings. Replaying the personal hell that was Joan Kennedy's life during this era is equally troublesome. Joan has also tried, at times sadly unsuccessfully, to lead a quiet and dignified life since those years, and her personal problems have been rehashed more than enough. Yes, they married into a very politically active family (they were not yet ""famous"" when Ethel, Jackie, or Joan married into the family in the 50s), but I'm sure they never thought their lives would be retold, ad nauseum, and sensationalized for entertainment purposes, or that their private pain would become spectacle. The book was equally dreadful and often inaccurate.",1325030400,,1529,5.071428571428571
2218642,1,B0007LPSJU,"Entertaining? Yes. However, especially with Jackie's oral history published, you can see how very historically inaccurate it is. If you want any semblance of facts, this isn't the one to go by.",1320624000,,193,5.0625
2218643,5,B0007LPSJU,This is a fantastic movie that portrays the lives of 3 Kennedy wives.  Each lady played their roles to perfection.  How difficult it was to be a Kennedy wife.,1318896000,,158,4.413793103448276
2218644,2,B0007LPSJU,"The screenplay to this production was written by someone wishing to portray the Kennedy women as strong & independent in their own rights. Given the recent releases of some of her old interviews in which Jackie stated that her opinions were pretty much given to her by JFK, and the shock expressed by Caroline's daughters in learning that their grandmother was the antithesis of a liberated woman, it is difficult to make that case with Jackie. Recalling Joan's bouts with alcoholism as a result of her marriage to Ted the words strong & independent do not fit so well. Perhaps Ethel was the exception, but I suspect she was very much the traditional housewife. With Joan, who was not so strong, & Jackie, who was anything but independent, we are being asked to empathize with people who were privileged and wealthy, and somehow relate to their stories. This is hard to do.",1316304000,4,873,4.75
2218645,5,B0007LPSJU,"I loved it. All three Kennedy women were wonderful.  Monroe character sucked, but the movie was great.  Thank you.",1306454400,,114,4.947368421052632
2218646,4,B0007LPSJU,"This movie was great to watch . Especially to know that the kennedys wives have pull together strong for each other through their trail and tribulation. Jackie was very strong. She their for children . Very protected of her family. Joan was very outspokening. She did not care what she say , she mean what she say. This movie is a great movie to watch. To see these three women have to battle through with their husbands.",1303776000,,421,4.48051948051948
2218647,4,B0007LPSJU,"I picked up the book "" Jackie Ethel and Joan"" at a local bookstore, and was very excited to see they're was a movie about the book.  I love reading the book and then watching the movie afterward.

It is a story based on a tragic time in our history.  I think a lot of people are fascinated by the Kennedy's.  This is a little window into their world.",1300752000,,350,4.028985507246377
2218648,1,B0007LPSJU,"the book was so much better than the movie. the book took more time to delve into who these women really were, their interpersonal relationships and what its like being in such a high profile family. the movie took many things out of context and made certain things hard to understand and follow along. it was also poorly cast. this was the worse adaptation ive ever seen. what a wasted opportunity.",1273449600,,399,4.633802816901408
2218649,4,B0007LPSJU,"Just as I enjoyed the book by Randy Taraborrelli - I enjoyed this movie.  Jill Hennessry is very believable as Jackie Kennedy and when the President dies - her scenes will break your heart and take you right back to that dreadful moment in time.  Lauren Holly is excellent as Ethel and fun to watch - Leslie Stefanson is surprisingly effective as Joan Kennedy,
you can find yourself cheering for her and that surprised me.  This movie is about these three remarkable women and that theme is carried out from the beginning to the end of the film.  I have watched this movie several times since I purchased it and enjoyed it each time.  If you are interested in the ""Kennedys"" - you will like this DVD.",1247702400,4,700,4.480314960629921
2218650,5,B0007LPSJU,This was a great purchase.  The quality of the DVD was perfect and I received it within days of purchase.  I would definitely deal with this vendor any time.,1238025600,2,157,4.379310344827586
8048366,5,B0007LPSJU,Great entertainment.,1508803200,,20,9.5
8048367,5,B0007LPSJU,"I think that The Women of Camelot was a very inspiring and amazing film about the life of the wives of President Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Edward Kennedy and about how they were able to deal with and recover from personal tragedies that affected the entire country and the world.  I also think that this film had a lot of entertaining, exciting and enjoyable drama and a really great and amazing cast and personal storylines as well.",1498780800,,435,4.64935064935065

8048371,3,B0007LPSJU,"I was taken aback by the opening scene (November 9, 1960) showing summer foliage?  Anyone else catch this rather insignificant detail?  Perhaps I need to suspend my disbelief.",1398211200,,175,5.214285714285714
8048372,3,B0007LPSJU,This is not the complete movie/miniseries. I was disappointed that it was filmed only to the JFK assasination. I saw the original on TV when it first aired and knew their was more to the story. Very dissappointed that it did not include more of the Joan and Ethel aspect of the storyline. Did anyone else have this issue with only it being half of the original mini-series?,1383955200,,373,4.5
8048373,4,B0007LPSJU,"This was an interesting movie and covered a lot of time and happenings. I thought Jill Hennesey was very good as Jackie and the role of Joan was very well played, very believable. I didn't care for this interpretation of Ethel. Just grated on the nerves. If she was that irritating a personality then I can't imagine her fitting in with the Kennedys or keeping Bobby's interest very long.  The portrayal of Bobby was well done and he looks quite a bit like him. More so than the actor in the latest Kennedy film with Greg Kinnear as JFK. The actor playing JFK was a fairly close match but he really lacks the skill as an actor to carry the role. This movie really does take you behind the scenes of their public lives and it's an interesting look. I enjoyed it.",1379635200,,761,4.359154929577465
8048374,5,B0007LPSJU,I would like to believe this series was based on fact...but due to the fact that in his short period of time in office...I find myself a tad confused on reality vs. drama.,1361923200,,171,4.212121212121212
8048375,4,B0007LPSJU,"I am a Jackie Kennedy aficionado from back in the day, as the Kennedy years were my high school years.  Since that awful day in Dallas, I have read uncountable books about the Kennedy era, as well as biographies about John and Jacqueline Kennedy, and watched the many film clips of them which now live in cyberspace.  While she's much younger than I and wouldn't remember Jackie in her White House years, Jill Hennessey obviously did her homework, because she superbly manifests the spirit, intelligence, dignity and mannerisms of Camelot's first lady.  Jill and the actresses who portray Ethel and Joan have done a fine job of depicting these historical characters and their relationships in a time slipping farther and farther into history.  Bravo!",1343174400,,750,5.024193548387097
