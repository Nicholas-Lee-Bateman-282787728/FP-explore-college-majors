8221398,4,B000W6TFV2,"This video keeps my 6 month old fairly entertained. The only complaint I have is that even this young, there are some segments that he doesn't care for, so it would have been nice if like segments were grouped together. Otherwise, entertaining for the both of us.",1268870400,,263,4.617021276595745
8221399,5,B000W6TFV2,"My daughter loved this product.  We've tried Baby Einstein and Brainy Baby and nothing seems to hold her attention like the babyfirsttv DVDs.  We like the parenting subtitles and my little Noah loves the variety of fun characters.

I would definitely recommend this product.",1201824000,2,274,5.181818181818182
