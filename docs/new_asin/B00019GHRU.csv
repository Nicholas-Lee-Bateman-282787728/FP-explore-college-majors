8008885,4,B00019GHRU,I use to watch Heathcliff at church back in the 80's and it was cool so I had to get it. I gave this movie a 4 because it had alot of fish Tales in it but then again it does say fish tales in the title. It does have 3 other movies so if your planing on watching it all in one day like I did then watch 1 of the 3 shows after every two fish tales so you can mix it up a bit. other then that it was cool.,1124064000,3,402,3.3333333333333335

8008887,5,B00019GHRU,"I love this DVD! I've been a huge fan of Heathcliff since I first saw the ""Heathcliff and Marmaduke"" show from the early 80s. I liked the idea of a cat who wasn't afraid of dogs. And when the show was canceled, many fans of the show, like me, hoped that someday he would return to the air. In 1984 our prayers were answered.

This time Heathcliff starred in his own cartoon with a whole host of new characters that kids from the 80s came to know and love (Wordsworth was my favorite). It was one of the best cartoons of it's time. But sadly, it too was eventually canceled.

Now, with the release of this DVD, we are able once again to enjoy Heathcliff's adventures in all their hilarity. I have grown out of a lot of things I enjoyed from my youth. But this cartoon still cracks me up. My favorite scene is the one where Heathcliff is in a rush to get home. But Grandma Nutmeg is driving too slow. And when she stops at a red light he gets out of the car and starts trying to push it.

Anyone who likes the 80s, or cartoons, or fat orange cats should definitely check out this DVD, and watch the original fat orange cat ""terrify the neighborhood"". My only complaint about this DVD is that there aren't more episodes included. But 9 will do for now. Hopefully the other episodes will be released on DVD as well, except for the ones from 1986. They really sucked.",1104192000,3,1362,4.250965250965251
