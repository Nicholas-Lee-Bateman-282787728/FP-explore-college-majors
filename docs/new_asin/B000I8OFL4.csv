8144456,5,B000I8OFL4,"La finta giardiniera (""The Pretend Garden Girl"") is an opera buffa from Mozart's youth (written in 1777, when Mozart was all of 18, with a libretto by Giuseppe Petrosellini).  The jealous Il Count Belfiore has attacked and stabbed his mistress, La Marchioness Violante Onesti.  Believing he has killed her, Belfiore flees.  The frayed, but quite alive Violante disguises herself as one Sandrina and, with her servant, Roberto (who also takes a disguise, as Nardo), she sets out to find Belfiore.  Nardo and Sandrina find employment as gardeners for Don Anchise, the Podesta (Governor) of Lagonero.  The Podesta falls head over heels for his new gardener while Nardo falls for Serpetto, the housekeeper.  The Podesta's niece Arminda enters the story; she was was once the lover of Il Cavalier Ramiro, jilted him, and is now engaged to Count Belfiore.  Sandrina eludes the Podesta's constant advances; she's further stressed when she discovers Belfiore's engagement.  Tension increases further when Ramiro appears at the estate.  The characters are thrown into a whirlwind of confusion: Arminda's engagement is called off when Belfiore is officially charged with the murder of Violante.  Sandrina comes to her ex-lover's rescue, revealing that she is Violante, alive and well.  Initially, no one believes Sandrina, but Belfiore reasserts his love for Violante.  Sandrina and Belfiore go mad in a cave, believing themselves to be gods, but their madness subsides after they fall asleep and reawaken in each other's arms.  Arminda decides to marry Ramiro after all, Nardo decides to  marry Serpetto and the Podesta will remain single until he finds another Sandrina.

Now what is an artist to do with such a ludicrous plot?  As he often did when tackling an absurd libretto, Mozart responded with inspired music.  In the true Mozartean spirit, director Doris Dorrie has just as much fun with Giardiniera as when she bounced through her 2003 staging of Cosi fan Tutte (set in the psychedelic 60's flower children era).  Dorrie's personality is stamped all over this charming production.  Primary colors abound.

The opening fight between Belfiore (John Mark Ainsley from Zaide) and Violante (Alexandra Reinprecht) is performed as a ballet in the opera's overture (and done true to period--traditionalists, do not get your hopes up).  Dorrie and set designer Bernd Lepel replace the garden estate with a busy, 21st century superstore.  A black leather clad Ramiro (mezzo-soprano Ruxandra Donose) looks like an extra from Road Warrior (1981), while the two leads are still adorned in powdered wigs, making for whimsical contrast.  Veronique Gens's Arminda could give Cruella de Ville competition and she delights in tormenting her poor Ramiro (Donose supplies meaty angst).  Audrey II from Little Shop of Horrors (1986) shows up ( I kid you not), chomps down on both Belfiore and Violante, thus generating their ""madness'--which takes place in a spider's den with an arachnid that's about as animated as Jack Arnold's Tarantula (1955).  But, it's all in good fun, even if a good thirty minutes of music has been excised, and if conductor Ivor Bolton and his orchestra don't seem to have as much fun as Dorrie and company.

Dorrie wonderfully succeeds in elevating what could have been a lackluster event into a spirited Halloween-like Mozartean treat.

8144457,5,B000I8OFL4,"A fun production. Ingenious in many respects.  Thankfully, the notes included with the DVD explain a bit what Stage Director Doris Dorrie was trying to do.  Her ideas work most of the time, but are a bit forced at other times.  (I don't much care for the sexual assault simulated in the Podesta's aria.  That crosses the line.)  Of course, the singing is world class. But anyone who thinks opera singers cannot act need to see this video.  Reinprecht's facial expression are perfect while she maintains such a noble air.  Kucerova is amazing as the young, unstoppable Serpetta. I was shocked to find Ramiro was Ruxandra Donose. I am a big fan of Ruxandra and did not recognize her in the facial hair. Excellent casting!  Amazing work in this rather bizarre staging.",1299715200,,765,4.742424242424242
8144458,5,B000I8OFL4,"All the Salzburg M22 productions were outrageous. ""Over the top!"" Intended, of course, to be fresh and challenging as theater, while maintaining the highest musical standards. Many of them failed, to my eyes/ears anyway, at one goal or the other, and several failed at both. I believe American audiences had more objections to them than European, and I know why: many European opera lovers, with far more opportunities to attend productions, would have seen and heard more conventional stagings. They would have a stock of memories of the action, the scene, etc. For them, this staging of ""La Finta Gardiniera"" and even more so the stagings of the later Mozart masterpieces would have seemed a fresh variation on the familiar, an extension of the possibilities of the opera.

""La Finta Gardiniera"" is one of the more successful ""over the top"" productions of the M22 series. It is well sung by all cast members, with tenor John Mark Ainsley singing splendidly the largest role as Belfiore, Veronique Gens outsinging the other females in the lesser role of Arminda, and baritone Markus Werba making the most of his role as the lackey Roberto. The orchestra is adequate -- not especially stylish, but technically adequate; this is not an opera with much exceptional orchestral participation, so ""adequate"" is exactly what's needed. Mozart's boyish genius got a bit ahead of him in this score; there are arias and ensembles of brilliance, but the whole doesn't cohere as more than the sum of the parts. The quintet and septet ensembles are remarkably 'prophetic' of the sort of madcap chaos that Rossini would throw at the audiences of his later era. It's always seemed to me that Rossini wrote very fine Mozart in his way ....

The libretto, by Giuseppe Petrosellini, is as absurd as any 18th C audience could have expected, with three sets of crossed lovers all obviously destined to be properly sorted in the end. There are moments of 'self-referential' comedy that would fit easily into a 21st C Hollywood film about Hollywood; instruments are mentioned metaphorically, for instance, and the actual instruments respond from the orchestra pit. It's supposed to be ""giocoso"", this tale of The Pretend Gardineress, and I hope there were plenty of sight gags and pratfalls in the stagings of Mozart's times. Without the ""jokes"", this libretto would be flatter than the bottoms of the theater goers after 161 minutes of boredom.

The M22 staging is a witty melange of rococo details inside a modernist set. The ""garden"" is revealed to be a ""big box"" garden hardware store. Most of the characters are employees in the store, with the Podest Don Ancise as the manager. Plants come alive, garden statues and giant flowers dance, and there's a monstrous Venus Fly Trap that plays a role in the action. It's relentlessly slapstick and surreal. After some first moments of surprise and skepticism, I found it quite entertaining. Yes, it meandered at times, but it was constrained to do so by Mozart's youthfully meandering music.

The one very valid criticism of such a staging, I would humbly suggest, is that the drama and the music tend to compete with each other. Not to clash. The spirit of the music was and is fully as outrageous as the modern staging. Rather, it's just plain hard to listen intently while so much absurdity is prancing on stage. Possibly, if I'd listened to various sound-only recording of ""La Finta Giardiniera"", and knew the score better by ear, I would have been less easily distracted.",1261440000,2,3503,4.932203389830509
8144459,3,B000I8OFL4,"The fine American stage and nightclub comic, Jimmy Durante, often sang a ditty which includes the lines, ""have you ever had the feeling that you wanted to go, then you got the feeling that you wanted to stay"", That pretty well described my feelings about the characters in this opera as it proceeded on its not very merry way, ""Enough Already! Stay or go, but put an end to this shilly-shallying.
I understand that this is intended as farce with a whirlwind of comings and goings as the crossed relationships are exploited in a 1930's sort of madcap comedy. I wasn't laughing.
Could well be my fault. Could be that a Carol Lombard, William Powell, Marx Brothers, Ritz Brothers, Hepburn, Grant, were needed to make me laugh at it, but there was an almost complete lack of similar talent; perhaps, the thought strikes me, it was because these were a group of ""straight men"", second bananas, without a first banana. That is, there was no strong comic character on which to build.
Certainly, every effort went into creating effects; some quite ingenious. By the three quarters mark, however, I found none to be so appealing as to induce an attachment so that I cared who married whom. I must say that the young man playing the female leads manservant was quite personable, alone among the central characters, but his choice for a love object certainly was puzzling(although,when he took off her glasses, she was beautiful, piece of business that was old when the Marx Brothers were young).
The singing was acceptable, the setting worked sufficiently well-if one is to wrench the characters out of the scenic design Mozart for which Mozart wrote, but, all in all, the vocal characterizations were so inconsistent from the setting in which they were created, that I had a constant sense of disjuncture between the lyrics and what was happening on the stage.
I have seen no other performance of this Mozart piece so cannot recommend it over the others or as a less suitable choice compared to another one available.",1228694400,2,2008,4.80635838150289
8144460,3,B000I8OFL4,"I will admit to being rather fussy about how Mozart is sung, but the women in this production are singing too loudly in order to be heard over the orchestra.  In my opinion, the M22 ""Abduction"" (also with Bolton conducting) suffers from the same over aggressive conducting.  This makes for a spectacular sound which is pleasing to the audiophile part of me, until the unrelenting ""driven"" sound and it's effect on the singers becomes annoying.

There are not enough floated notes, and coloratura passage work is forced and smeared.  I would like to hear these singers with a conductor who leaves room (sonically) for the voices.  My standard for Mozart is well represented by Sena Jurinac, Lisa Della Casa, and Irmgard Seefried on pre stereo recordings.  These singers had the advantage of singing in a less noisy world.  Malin Hartelius sings just as beautifully today by singing with conductors who know how to leave room for the voices.

In my opinion Mozart can be scaled up a bit without losing much musically and in the process gain dramatically.  Furtwangler's Don Giovanni is one example.  The La Scala Cosi Fan Tutti with Daniela Dessi as Fiordiligi is another sucessful example.  These productions do not have an unrelenting wall of sound coming from the pit.  In conclusion I think Bolton is the problem.

Now let's get to the production:  I am getting tired of the underware displays.  Although the nudity is not so blatent here as in ""Abduction"" dancers in body stockings that are fairly transparent, will not please some of the audience.  Unlike ""Semplice"" this recurs, so cutting one chapter won't eliminate the near nudity.  Again, this limits it's use for teaching purposes.",1174262400,4,1691,4.939716312056738
8144461,4,B000I8OFL4,"Alongside Jurgen Flimm, Claus Guth or Pierre Audi, Doris Doerrie is another ""star"" stage director to take part in the ""M22"" project, coming from the German movie industry. It is fair to say from the start that her work on ""Finta"" is very interesting, very detailed and very original. Frau Doerrie moves the plot - completely inane and inept - in the gardening section of a big department store. In this restrained atmosphere, the staging can really focus on the comedy and on the intermingling between the seven principals. While the concept is really innovative and fun, the execution is brilliant too. Because she is a movie director, Doris Doerrie knows how to keep a sense of pace, and to this extent this production is as entertaining as Joachim Schloemer's Finta Semplice in the same collection. More importantly, Frau Doerrie has also done a lot of work on each and every one of the characters, which means that very quickly, an audience unfamiliar with this opera (like I was when I first watched this DVD) can quickly recognize and single out every character. This is pretty remarkable since, as we hinted out above, the libretto by Giuseppe Petrosellini is utterly stupid and non-sensical, and focuses on cardboard characters with no depth whatsoever. As a result, Doris Doerrie's attempt at strengthening the dramatic interest of these people is exactly in line with Mozart's music which, many times in the course of this opera, tells you the opposite of what is written or at least considerably amends the litteral meaning.
Fortunately for us, this production is supported by a very good ensemble cast.
The palm of the best singers goes to the delightful mezzo Ruxandra Donose, who portrays a fragile, long-suffering Ramiro. As demonstrated by the excellent bonus feature on the DVD, this more ""tragic"" aspect of Ramiro's personality was quite difficult to get to but Donose is very moving. Veronique Gens was a cracking Arminda, ample-sounding and a lot of fun too while Adriana Kucerova was an exquisite Serpetta. The best of the men is without a doubt the hilarious Podesta of John Graham-Hall, halfway between John Cleese and William H. Macy in Boogie Nights: a resounding vocal and comic success.
Alexandra Reinprecht, in the title role, is battling with her part most of the performance but she delivers a wonderful final duet with her Belfiore, John Mark Ainsley.
In fact, the only drawback of the performance (costing it its 5-star rating) is the completely flat and academic conducting of Ivor Bolton. The orchestra goes through the motions and seems really routine versus the madness that goes onstage. This is a bit of a shame because the pairing of Bolton and the Mozarteum orchestra is appearing three times in the M22 collection (Giardiniera, Entfuhrung and Zaide). We hope for a more lively account of the other two operas - more on this later.
Despite this drawback, a great performance of a lesser-known Mozart opera.",1168732800,16,2946,4.9776876267748476
8144462,5,B000I8OFL4,In this production German movie director Doris Dorrie sets the opera in the gardening department of a large supermarket. Singing is very good especially by the young German baritone Markus Werba and mezzo Ruxandra Donose. Highly recommended!,1168041600,2,241,5.54054054054054
8144463,5,B000I8OFL4,"How many eighteen year olds do you know who could write an opera, let alone an opera of this quality? Not bloody many, I'd be willing to wager!

Okay, this opera is pretty much a romp and little more. However, it is a very enjoyable romp and it does contain some music which wouldn't be out of place in Cos fan tutte or Les nozze di Figaro. Serpetta, played with great pizzazz and sass by Adriana Kucerov, sings the sort of Opera Buffa arias Despina, in Cos fan tutte, would present to us several years later in Mozart's career. The butterfly tattoos, black boots, mobile phone, bubble gum and ""colourful Goth"" look work very well for Serpetta! See her on the cover of the DVD. She steals the show, by the way.

Don Anchise is played by John Graham-Hall and he reminds of the typical skirt chasing boss who always manages to take himself way too seriously and ends up looking like a buffoon.

Vronique Gens is here, too, as Arminda, an Opera Seria style role. John Mark Ainsley is also in the cast and he is in fine form and enjoying himself immensely.

Ivor Bolton conducts the Mozarteum Orchester Salzburg and the orchestra is in good form, although I would have preferred a sharper, punchier and more incisive sound from period instruments.

Doris Drrie directs and the staging and concept is very entertaining and creative, without being silly. The opera is staged in the gardening section of a major department store! It works well and I actually laughed out loud more than once when I first watched this opera.

I look forward to buying others in the 2006 DG collection of Mozart operas.

As I said in the title of this review, this is a sexy, nutty, funny and fun production. Great entertainment for the whole family.",1166918400,13,1724,4.577922077922078
