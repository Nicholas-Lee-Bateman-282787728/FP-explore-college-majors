6872833,5,B00QJN34R8,"There are two really great experiments here - ""Space Travelers"", and ""San Francisco International.""  SFI is of note as , like ""Mitchell"" and ""Code Name: Diamondhead"" have a 1970s failed TV pilot vibe to them  ""Space Travelers"" is the FVI (and MSTed) version of the Academy Award winner to receive the treatment from Joel, Mike, and the 'Bots.

""Hercules"" is a typical ""sword and sandals"" bad movie from early in the Comedy Central days, and is in my book amusing but not up to the majesty that is ""San Francisco: International,"" a season 6 winner that has defied release up until this point.

""SFI"" has a groovy beatnik that gets the business from Joe Friday, I mean Pernell Roberts.  Mr. Adam Bonanza himself later talks down a non-pilot teenager who manages to get his Cessna to take off, but hasn't worked on the landing part yet.  If only this teen had taken lessons from Mr. Light Aircraft himself, Mr. Coleman Francis.

6872834,2,B00QJN34R8,"Radar secret and hercules are well done and 2 of my faves.  San Fran and space travelers are weak.  Hey, that is JMHO.  That is my bias.  I can understand if you disagree with that.  Maybe you love san fran because it has that ultra skinny vietnamese-french chick in it.  Well okay then.  You are a perv but hey whatever.  It's all good.

What is not good, and not debatable,  is that they want forty dollars for a quad of four crappy movies.  It does not help that the mst3k phoned in two of them.  Come on guys.  Not all misties are millionaires.  This set should go for 20 bucks max.",1425168000,6,586,4.162162162162162

6872836,5,B00QJN34R8,"This set features four episodes from the Comedy Central era of the show. Two episodes feature Joel Hodgson as host and two are with Mike Nelson. It's a good eclectic mix of movie types spanning seasons four, five, and six.

Space Travelers, episode 401
Originally titled Marooned, this retitled version from Film Ventures was the first episode of season four. It's a 1969 color film with an all-star cast including Gregory Peck, Gene Hackman, James Franciscus, Richard Crenna and David Jansen, yet it's a fairly dull film with lots of stock footage shots. The riffing on this one is terrific and is punctuated throughout by Crow (Trace Beaulieu) doing a killer Gregory Peck impression to deliver many of his jokes. The host segments are all winners in this one too. Fantastic jokes throughout along with an MST3K rarity, a major motion picture. Don't miss it!

Hercules, episode 502
This 1958 color film starring Steve Reeves started the sword-and-sandal craze by Italian film makers and it's certainly better than most of the knock-offs that followed including its own direct sequel, Hercules Unchained which was also done on MST3K. Hercules arrives in Iolcus and falls in love with King Pelias' daughter, Iole. To win her Hercules must complete a series of tasks including joining Jason on the voyage of the Argo. Though it was episode 502 it actually aired first at the beginning of season five. Like all the Hercules films done on the show it's fun and more action packed than the sequel, though cuts were made for time meaning that sometimes the continuity of the movie suffers a bit. Highlights include Crow's one-man show of the Match Game and the updated constellations sketch.

San Francisco International, episode 614
A 1970 TV movie starring Pernell Roberts, Clu Gulager, Van Johnson, Tab Hunter and David Hartman, it's a fair TV knock-off of the Airport theatrical series of films that was also a pilot for a TV series. Pernell Roberts was replaced by Lloyd Bridges when the show became a series. This melodramatic movie has both a main plot about thieves and a subplot about a kid in crisis in a stolen plane. It's just as exciting as it sounds. Host segments focus on an Urkel running gag for some reason and Torgo makes an appearance too.

Radar Secret Service, episode 520
This is a 1950 black-and-white crime drama produced by Robert Lippert (Lost Continent, Rocketship XM, Jungle Goddess, King Dinosaur) so you know you are in for a low-budget film with lots of padding. The film is so dull the Mad Scientists dub the effect of it as ""Hypno-helio-static-stasis"", a successor to ""Deep Hurting"". The plot focuses on G-men tracking a stolen uranium shipment. You'll recognize at least one actor in the film, Sid Melton (The Danny Thomas Hour, Green Acres and a lot more), he was the comic relief in Lost Continent.  It's quite a bit duller than the other Lippert films used on the show, but the short, Last Clear Chance, about railroad safety is a lot of fun. The host segment making fun of the short, ""Why don't they look?"", is definitely an episode highlight.

6872851,5,B00QJN34R8,"A great collection of episodes, but for me the big draw is ""Space Travelers"".  I like that, in the bonus features, they confess some discomfort at riffing a decent film with some major talents.  But were it not for MST3K and Shout! one would be hard pressed to find a copy of what was originally titled ""Marooned"" in any format.  This is one time I kind of wish they went back to the early practice of including uncut versions in the DVD releases.  ""Marooned"" made a big impression on me when I saw it on TV as a child, and it was a major contributor to my interest both in the space program and science fiction.  I realize it is a little plodding by today's standards, but so is 2001: A Space Odyssey, and at the time it seemed full of suspense and tension.  Of course the other films and their MST3K treatments have their charms as well.  Herc is always good grist for the mill, and I kind of wish they had held them all back for a Herculean all-Hercules special box, like they did for Gamera.  Radar Secret Service and San Francisco International are two very different flavors of pain, made entertaining only by the magic of a man and his bots.",1432771200,2,1148,4.331775700934579

6872861,5,B00QJN34R8,"""Space Travelers"" (a/k/a ""Marooned"") was a big budget movie with a well-known cast - Gregory Peck, Richard Crenna, James Franciscus, David Janssen, and Gene Hackman (he's always good in everything he appears in).  As Frank Conniff (TV's Frank) mentioned in his new introduction, it was an unusual choice for the MST3K gang to riff on, but the results were hilarious.  The slow pacing of the film worked in favor of their constant riffing.  Next up is Steve Reeves, not to be confused with George Reeves, who played Superman on TV.  Steve flexed his mighty muscles in the title role of ""Hercules"" (1958).  Hercules falls in love with King Pelias' daughter Iole; can't save the King's son Iphitus from getting killed by a lion; and row, row, rows the boat with Jason and the Argonauts on their voyage to get the Golden Fleece.  It's all Greek to me!  As a rule, I don't care for sword and sandals movies, but the original Hercules has a certain charm, which Joel and the 'bots have a field day riffing.  The host segment on the Match Game is excellent.  In addition, there is an interesting bonus feature on the early films of Joseph E. Levine.

As Mike Nelson points out about ""Radar Secret Service"" (1950), the film spends far too much time dealing with radar, and not nearly enough time with the secret agents.  In fact, the whole movie is like an expanded short subject that could have been called ""Radar Is Your Friend.""  The only noteworthy performances come from Adele Jergens in the blonde bombshell role, and Sid Melton as the comic relief.  An interesting bonus feature is a travelogue with Frank Conniff and Trace Beaulieu in England, being interviewed by Bunny Galore, British horror movie host, and Queen of the cult movies.  (Although, going by her name and listening to her voice, I suspect that Bunny is a Drag Queen.  Not that theres anything wrong with that!)  Last and least is the made-for-TV movie pilot ""San Francisco International"" (1970).  Pernell Roberts stars as the head of airport security.  Tab Hunter chews the scenery as a criminal briefly disguised as a priest.  The plot involves a gang of criminals holding people at gunpoint, as part of a plan to steal a shipment of millions of dollars from Alaska (cold, hard cash).  There's also a subplot about an annoying kid whose parents (Van Johnson and Nancy Malone) are going to get divorced.  The kid steals a small airplane and somehow manages to fly it.  Pernell Roberts has to fly next to the kid, to talk him down safely.  And yes, we can all agree that David Hartman is a goofy-looking guy.  The host segments mostly involve Mike Nelson impersonating Steve Urkel, with everybody laughing hysterically at everything he says.  That strange episode closes out this mixed bag of MST3K movies.",1429574400,9,2770,4.76890756302521
6872862,5,B00QJN34R8,"Very good collection of MST3K episodes. I did not have any of these in my collection, and their all pretty good.

6872863,3,B00QJN34R8,"Every time I do an Amazon/MST3K review - I Have to post this notice. - And - it's because a handful of diehard goofballs - Can't allow someone (like me) to have an opinion - and give a rating - that is anything Less than 100%.
(Everyone's 'funny bone' is in a different place - and this is my reaction - of course)
So - if you like my review and it helps you - Great. - And if you Don't - just go write your own review - and leave me Alone! (Thanks)

I LOVE MST3K - the concept, the cast (most) - and I have most everything on DVD. - And - I Will continue to buy and support his cult classic - legacy.

#1 Radar Secret Service - black & white (Joel, Kevin & Trace!) Starts with one of my favorite MST Shorts - 'Last Clear Chance'(in color)- a railroad safety short - with William Boyett. GREAT riffs!! One of my favorite MST Shorts!! (my rating = 9!!)
(the movie itself) I Don't like it - it's a Flop! Wasn't interesting or fun. And Not one memorable riff. I give it a 4 (out of ten)

#2 San Francisco International, (Mike, Kevin & Trace)
Kind of an off movie w/Pernell Roberts. Towards the end the thieves are a bit clever - and the riffs 'kick-in'. (p.s. I don't understand why the good guys - didn't just trade the money back out - with the magazines.) I also give this movie a rating of 4 ( out of ten).

#3 Hercules - color (Joel, Kevin & Trace) I Love the 'Invention Exchange' - with the 'Cellular Desk'!!
I Don't like the Hercules series to begin with. One thing that grossed me out - was the rams hide with the head/skull (Yuck!!)
The riffs never caught on for me in this movie. - Rating 2 ( out of ten)

#4 Space Travelers - color (aka Marooned) (Joel, Kevin & Trace) For some reason - I watched this movie first out of the set - and I LOVE it!! I remember seeing it in the theater as a kid - and I like the movie to being with. - GREAT riffs!! I Laughed A Lot!! Only slowed down a bit at the end. So far - one of my Most Favorite MSTs of all!! Rating 8 (out of ten)

*My overall rating of this set - is a 5 ( out of ten) - and this includes the short 'Last Clear Chance'.
Again - I LOVE MST (Cinematic Titanic - and Rifftrax) - and will continue to buy and support them.
In this particular set - I only like Disc 4 - and the short.",1428624000,3,2241,3.914285714285714
6872864,5,B00QJN34R8,"Just my two-cents on the movies.  Space Travelers:  Lots of stars.  Not bad special effects (for the time).  Stunningly boring.  Compare this to watching paint dry?  It would be a toss up.  The skits and riffing, however, keep it going - and keep you laughing.

Hercules:  The dubbing is, of course, pretty bad.  Storyline?  Well, I guess there is one - if by storyline they mean having Mr. Reeves run around flexing his muscles.  The riffing and skits, of course are first class.

Radar Secret Service: You just have to watch it to believe it.  I watched it a couple of times and am gobsmacked how people could have thought this was a good idea.  This is one that really didn't need the riffing to be hilarious - unintentionally of course.  But the SOL crew make it even funnier.

San Francisco International:  I was laughing just looking at the fashion.  And the set for the inside of the jets - we could only wish they were that big with that much leg room.  At least we know where they got the idea for the Airplane comedies.

Watch these if you dare!  Be prepared to be bowled from laughing.

I cannot wait for the next set to come out!  Keep up the great work, SHOUT!",1428364800,12,1173,4.373831775700935

No, these are all gems with the perfect cast. Personally, I prefer Joel to Mike, but the Mike episodes up to the departure of Frank (and tragically, soon to follow Trace) are often just as funny, sometimes funnier. Space Travelers is hard to riff, as it's probably their biggest budget film, with an all star cast, but the boys pull it off. The Hercules films are always fun. Radar Secret Service will be remembered mostly for the super great short ""Last Clear Chance"". I wish they would bring back this show, and if they ever do, please let the cast be Joel, Trace, Kevin, and Frank, with possibly Mike somehow alternating with Joel.

8691678,5,B00QJN34R8,"Four feature presentations from the Mistie middle years and one memorable short make up Volume XXXII, released in March of 2015.

Episode 401, SPACE TRAVELERS (1969), is the only MST3K movie so far to have won an Academy Award (VIsual Effects).  Originally released by Columbia as MAROONED, it is a story about three Apollo-type astronauts trapped in their space capsule due to malfunctioning retro-rockets.  Despite a nearly all-star cast (Richard Crenna, Gene Hackman and James Franciscus in the capsule; Gregory Peck and David Janssen at Mission Control), and a then-hefty ten-million-dollar budget, the movie was not a success for the studio.  (The moon landing having already taken place, Americans showed a strong preference for the real thing.)  Despite the stars' salaries and the special effects, SPACE TRAVELERS is a boring affair though Joel and the bots do their best with it.

Next up is Episode 502, HERCULES (1958), the first Hercules movie to star Steve Reeves and many would say the best.  This one hews closest to the myths of Hercules falling in love with Iole, daughter of Pelias and going in search of the Golden Fleece.  All this machismo with almost every day ""a big, brawny, hairy, glistening, two-fisted, manly day"" makes for zesty fun and great satire, and after all Steve Reeves isn't too hard to look at.  The S-O-L crew has great fun mocking it in a somewhat affectionate vein.

The third selection is Episode 520, RADAR SECRET SERVICE (1950), pure shlock from the golden age of ""B"" pictures.  The Secret Service has somehow refined radar to the degree it can not only track solid objects on the ground, but yield television-like images of what's going on.  (A government that could obtain visual images of its citizens -- preposterous back then if not now).  This was only Mike Nelson's eighth episode as botmeister, but the crew do extremely well, finding humor and provoking laughs from things that would simply bore most of us.

The fourth movie, and in some ways the weakest, is SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL (1969), a pilot movie from the high age of Universal made-for-TV movies.  Pernell Roberts manages the huge metropolitan airport and has to contend with the ego of a subordinate (Clu Gulager) and typical made-for-TV dilemmas like a bad guy (Tab Hunter) trying to smuggle a box of illicit cash from one plane to another, and a misunderstood pre-teen (Teddy Eccles) who happens upon a small single-engine plane with the keys in it.  (I doubt that security was that lax even in the Sixties).  This is Roberts' only appearance in the SFO series, since NBC insisted Lloyd Bridges take his place.  The riffing is fun if not exactly outstanding, as Mike, Crow and Tom Servo jibe perceptively over changed times and Hollywood stock figures.

If I had to give these Mistie movies individual stars, I'd say four stars for the first and last entries, five for the two in the middle.  But one thing pushes me towards five stars for the whole collection:  the 1959 short ""Last Clear Chance"" that precedes RADAR SECRET SERVICE.  Commissioned by the Union Pacific Railroad to urge safety on the road (and especially at railway crossings), it's surprisingly chipper in tone as an aggrieved State Trooper lectures a farm family about avoidable highway deaths he has seen in his career.  The family seems to have nothing better to do than sit around drinking iced tea and humoring the lawman.  Of the family's two sons, one drives an English roadster (as if!) and has a creamy girlfriend with a stylish convertible (""I've got life in me, Big Daddy!"");  the other has just received his driver's license (""Hey, my Advocate's here!"").  What could go wrong?  Mike and the bots have a great time hashing up this time-capsule piece, which was quite popular in its day with schools and community groups.

I do not own a lot of these ""roman numeral"" collections, but I think this is one of the better ones.
