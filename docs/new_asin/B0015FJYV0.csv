3144297,4,B0015FJYV0,"Prior to buying this DVD, I had been working out with Rania's Weight Loss for Beginners:Hip Hop, Hip Drop. Her DVD is a workout that includes belly dance moves that are more basic.
 When I first tried Lucsious: Bellydancing for beginners, it was hard for me to follow some of the moves. The instructor went over each move but seemed to rush the teaching of each move a little bit. Then after each move learned there is a practice session a "" mini-workout"".
 I would recommend both Rania's DVD and Luscious with the caveat that you need to build up your stamina first with an easier DVD like Rania's.
 Luscious is for people that already might have some knowledge of basic moves and would like to move on to more challenging moves.
 Luscious is produced by World Dance Studios in New York and the dancers are professionals in full costume. It is a dance instructional workout.
 Whichever one you choose, realize that it takes time to build up the strength and physical skills to bellydance. Persevere, and you will learn how to bellydance.",1213574400,9,1038,4.6502732240437155
3144298,4,B0015FJYV0,"One of the things that attracted me to this workout is that it advertises itself as being for beginners.  This isn't quite true.  If you've never done bellydance before, then this is not a DVD for you.  It's lovely and lush, and each of the instructors are talented in their own right, but a rank beginner will find the moves hard to follow.

The DVD does include a tutorial section, which is a bonus.  I wish, however, that they had filmed it differently.  The tutorial appears to be filmed on the same stage on which the workout is performed, when a studio with mirrors to show more angles of Neon (who is the only instructor performing the tutorials) might be more advantageous.  Neon is also dressed in a performance costume, which is a bit distracting and which makes it hard to follow sometimes, particularly in traveling moves and the movements of her knees.  The tutorial for each move also seems a bit short at times, with more time being devoted to an accompanying clip demonstrating the move's use in the workout.

The workout itself is more satisfying.  The vocal prompts are in general quite good, and I particularly like that there is an indication on-screen as to which move or combination is being performed.  The workout is balanced and well-paced, building moves from each previous section as it progresses, and the musical accompaniment is appropriate.  The angle changes are occasionally odd and distracting, but don't detract too much from the quality of the workout itself.

Although it purports to be for beginners, I would not recommend this as one's first bellydance DVD purchase, unless they've already had some instruction.  For those without access to an instructor, it might be better to start with another DVD that better breaks down the basics, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-Basics-and-Beyond-Technique-for-a-Solid-Foundation/dp/B000FSL8WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance Basics and Beyond: Technique for a Solid Foundation</a>&nbsp;(another World Dance New York title).  If you've mastered the basics, though, then this will be a fun, relaxed workout, well worth the money.",1212451200,75,2175,5.41246290801187
3144299,5,B0015FJYV0,"Too exquisite to be called a workout, this seven-part ""danceout"" as I like to call it, is beauty in motion. The three absolute goddesses who draw you warmly, elegantly, charmingly into the beautiful world of bellydancing, look every bit luscious. Dressed in equally luscious costumes, they create an atmosphere that totally fills your mind even as you watch on your screen.

While Neon, Blanca and Sarah may look as if they're dancing the most impossibly beautiful moves, the bellydance beginner can join in. Conceptualized and choreographed by Neon, who has produced numerous instructional videos that have spread bellydancing to many places in the world, this video is targeted at beginners. And it includes the ""simpler"" moves. If you've recently begun bellydancing and have a  video or two focusing on basic technique or better still, if you're taking classes, Luscious will be a lovely way to practice them in a connected, smooth, flowing way. I won't describe each section because other reviewers have done so and the video clip does a great job of telling you what to expect. But I will say, that for the absolute beginner, there's a natural sort of break up in each segment which makes it easier to work with the video a little bit at a time. Another really useful touch is that in the tutorial section, led by Neon, each set of isolations ends with an extract from the danceout. You can use that to practice putting the moves into action.

The tutorial section is very thorough and the moves are explained very thoroughly at a pace which a beginner will have no trouble with. For anyone not familiar with Neon, she's particularly experienced with clear, precise and ever-so-gentle explanations and demonstrations of dance movements. She happens to be the one who started me off on belly dancing as a video-only learner and several years later I'm amazed to have reached a happy level with no injury.

For more experienced dancers, this is a wonderful video to deepen, intensify and beautify the basic moves without the usual almost-military drills we do. Use it to focus fully on engaging the abs and back while doing a full 45 minutes to strengthen the moves you'll use most often. There are combinations and arm moves sprinkled through the sessions - so it feels like a long, long leisurely dance. It's a very pleasurable way to go through all your moves, for all body zones. It reminds me a little, conceptually, of Jehan's Ultimate Fitness, which of course is a fast-paced advanced workout with complex movements and layering.

Two things need a special mention and that's the absolutely gorgeous costumes and the music. The costumes contribute significantly to how this whole video looks and the aura that it creates. They're lush and totally mouth watering. The music. Ah. There are 17 (if I counted correctly) tracks used here. They're beautifully selected and  add so much richness to the dance. The most-featured artists are DJ Mosavo and Solace. I've got myself an entire Luscious playlist because the music is so very pretty.",1211068800,14,3045,4.925925925925926
3144300,5,B0015FJYV0,"Luscious
Neon, Blanca, and Sarah, star performers from World Dance New York are here to bring you into a new concept to weight loss,by loving yourself and gently flowing into deep core belly dance basic elements that are sensual and feminine yet sneak right in and tone, strengthen the spine, build fluidity and grace. The concept here is that continuous movements with ease will accomplish more than hard impact work outs that are short-lived.
This program runs approximately two hours. It is a work out implementing belly dance moves with clear concise instruction from each dancer.
A tutorial section including undulations, infinity loops, circles, hip accents, body line, shimmy; carefully dissected with details that comprise each section. For example, in the body line section, Neon breaks down the arabesque, the back bend, or arch and three step turn.
The workout is divided into sections:
Circles, Infinity loops, Hip work, Undulations, Shimmy, Body Line. In conclusion, a beautiful dance bringing together all the combinations used in the program.
 The work out is complete with voice cues, or music only. The music is an added bonus, simply because it is beautiful! There is plenty of repetition and each section is easy to learn.
This program is complete and versatile enough for the beginner or the seasoned dancer who wants a great warm up, cool down with a gentle and effective practice while developing deep core strength and most importantly, fluid movement.
I enjoyed every aspect of this work out and look forward to it as a personal work out; gentle but effective therefore building stamina and stamina burns calories.  The instruction is easy to follow, each dancer is knowledgeable, and clear to point. Their costumes are colorful and beautifully detailed as to coordinate with each other. The setting is simple and not distracting, the lighting enhances the dancer their movement, topped off by the music.
Overall, aside from delightful, the choreographies added at the end of each section will ""engrain into muscle memory"" all the basic moves that  can take any level dancer into a daily dance ritual to embrace their feminine goddess. Make this your personal workout, and who knows, someone may comment, that you do look luscious!",1210809600,3,2255,5.138964577656676
3144301,5,B0015FJYV0,"Did we really need another bellydance-based workout? I wouldn't have thought so, but Neon, as usual, has gone and proven my expectations wrong.

""Luscious"" is an exquisitely made program, with more good qualities than I can enumerate. The costumes and setting are gorgeous -- nothing like the typical brightly-lit aerobics studio -- and Neon advises you at the beginning to dress up for it and join the three dancers here in making the movement special. This is the kind of thing that sounds cheesy, but I did it, and it makes sense: how will you forget about bad body image or those extra pounds if you're wearing ugly workout wear? Dressing up makes you feel like you're dancing, not punishing yourself.

The instruction itself is taught in sections themed ""Circles,"" ""Infinity Loops,"" ""Undulations,"" ""Hip Accents,"" ""Shimmy,"" and ""Body Line."" Each dancer leads two of the sections: she stands at the front and her voiceover describes the movements to be done. What I really like about this is that the sections weren't assigned randomly; instead, each section bears the particular dancer's imprint, and showcases her strengths. It's subtle, but you start to notice that Neon leads complicated, quick-changing combinations, Blanca shows her wonderful, large, and sensuous movements, and Sarah Skinner adds an upbeat Turkish feel to the shimmy section. This made the instructors seem much less like exchangeable dancing bodies, and much more like teachers with particular areas of expertise.

The movements are varied, and quite a few combinations are introduced and repeated from two to six times. This is not a ""four of this and four of that"" drill. In fact, I would suggest that complete beginners start with a different video. This would be great for advanced beginners like me, who are not expert enough for a complicated choreo with tons of layering, but get bored when everything comes in fours and is repeated ad infinitum.

All along, the dancers offer tips on putting emotion into the steps, on maintaining form, and on making movements deeper and stronger. While the dancing is rarely fast-paced, the slowness of the movements is often more challenging and grueling. The workout made me sweat (though it might not make everyone), but more importantly, it challenged me to maintain grace, form, and muscle control while learning the combinations. I couldn't believe it when the forty-five minutes were over -- it felt like fifteen!

If you have weak knees, you might want to be careful with some of the lunges and plies; on the other hand, there aren't a lot of them, and they're done slowly enough that you can be careful. I'll also repeat the warning that this might be a little hard for complete beginners who aren't already good at picking up choreography. However, the video does have a well-indexed instructional section which describes all the movements used in the workout. As a step up, there's a version of the workout with music alone, and no voice over.

In case my enthusiasm wasn't clear enough, I really think WDNY has a winner with this video. It's simple, but also simple enough to do regularly and to grow into. At the same time, even once you have learned the step combinations, adding graceful arm and handwork (to say nothing of being aware of facial expressions, head positions, and dancer's poise) poses an extra layer of difficulty. And finally, the movements are, quite simply, beautiful. You will be happy to be dancing.",1210809600,232,3456,4.9809358752166375
3144302,5,B0015FJYV0,"I found this DVD to be very enjoyable.  The instruction portion is very
clear, the costumes are intriguing, and the dancers are lovely.  This is a great beginners DVD.  I'm not a beginner, but after surgery was advised
to ease back into it.  This is easing me back into it and I'm loving it!
I like that you can choose to work out with verbal cues or just music. The pants that the dancers wear are so cool, I think I will have to make a pair!",1210636800,,443,4.057471264367816
3144303,5,B0015FJYV0,"""Luscious"" is a terrific bellydance instruction DVD geared towards beginners, though intermediate students may enjoy and learn from it too, as Neon, Blanca, and Sarah are superb dancers and teachers, and the choreography is varied enough to find interest and enjoyment for a very long time.

After the ""Welcome"" by Neon, the dancers guide you through the moves, each taking their turn at being in the front and doing the teaching. There is also the option of a ""Step by Step Tutorial,"" which explains each move in detail, as well as an option to practice just with the music, without the voice-over instructions. The music is marvelous, all with a traditional flavor in its instrumentation and melodies.

Your instructors:
Neon is a stunning blonde born in Russia; a famed dancer, teacher, and choreographer, whose technique is dazzling, and creativity amazing. She has helped bring the art of bellydance to a new level. Blanca is a goddess. Born in Mexico, her sensual style and grace have few equals. Sarah Skinner is a dancer I'm less familiar with, but she is incredibly impressive and beautiful, and fits in well with Neon and Blanca. These 3 dancers are the epitome of ""The Three Graces.""

""Luscious"" is very well produced, and the dancers are filmed in a simple stage setting with excellent lighting, making it easy to discern and follow the movements. The costuming is also lovely, in shades of teal and red, and adds to the visual beauty of the program. This is a great way to learn bellydancing, relieve stress, get your exercise and have fun at the same time. If you want weight loss, many experts agree that the best way to lose is through doing continual movement as is done on this DVD, rather than in aerobics. ""Luscious"" is a superb DVD for your dance instruction library, and if you're just starting out with bellydancing, it will inspire you to keep practicing and learning.",1210550400,52,1892,4.833333333333333

3144305,5,B0015FJYV0,"I really like this! It's easy to follow and is done at a good pace for beginners. I watched the tutorial first on how to do the moves. If you are JUST starting, I recommend Neon's, beginner DVD (the blue one) before you get any other belly dance DVDs. Once you learn that, it will be easier to follow choreography in other belly dance DVDs. I mean, this has a tutorial with all the moves in this dance, but I still recommend getting that other one first, just to lay a very basic foundation.",1443312000,7,491,4.23404255319149
3144306,3,B0015FJYV0,"I was disappointed because I expected a more intense workout & more dance combinations. The video did teach various belly dance moves in a manner that was fairly easy to learn. However, it was very boring. I gave it 3 stars because if you simply want to learn how to belly dance, this dvd will be adequate. But if you want to have fun & burn calories, I would not recommend this.",1442620800,,379,4.277777777777778
3144307,3,B0015FJYV0,If you are an absolute beginner this DVD is not for you. It's hard to follow because it's just a prerecorded voice talking to you while they perform and nothing is broken down for you. If you have a little bit of experience it's not a bad dvd but I thought it would be a little more personable. If this was my first belly dance experience I probably would have been extremely confused and had a lot of trouble catching on.,1440806400,,422,4.222222222222222

3144310,3,B0015FJYV0,"First time doing belly dancing, I do have a young childhood in dance in ballet, jazz/r&b, and ukranian dance. I had a good workout although I recommend you stretch your arms and back at least before doing the tutorials and possibly your calves. The dance examples are too challenging for me but I could see myself doing most of it if I stick to it. Really helps to have a mirror. I recommend you look them and neon up and other tutorials on youtube as there are some small tips which made some of the movement easier and could see the legs better or differently. A confidence booster but I am thinking it would be better to combine or just sign up for dance classes instead if you are serious about learning. I am sore already. I looked up love potion online and I like the movements the way they looked on this one, as well as read reviews. They do have first steps which I would have done but I want dance not just steps, well nothing is instant or comes easy, so I do appreciate the work and it has me re-interested in dance. Maybe a 2 part disc or something inbetween the two would have been better for an absolute beginner. If you have some experience than this would be good for you.",1426291200,,1189,4.265486725663717
3144311,5,B0015FJYV0,This is a good workout as well as a great DVD to practice your belly dance skills.  I like to use this when I don't have time to attend classes regularly.  This is one of the better DVDs in my opinion from World Dance New York.,1423094400,,227,3.9130434782608696

3144314,3,B0015FJYV0,"I'm a beginner/advanced beginner bellydancer, and I was looking for a DVD that teachs me a few combos and feel like I'm dancing and not make a serie of repetitions of the movement. I think this DVD comply with this function. On the Tutorial section, Neon explains you, briefly, and practice, the movements you will use in the workout section. I recommend go over this part of the DVD for the first time.
On Workout Section, Neon, Blanca, and Sarah Skinner, guide you in a complete 45 minutes workout. They breakdown and practice a serie of combinatios progressively and finally you are dancing a combination. I love this section, because you can review and practice your movements while you are dancing. despite everything, I miss a warm up and a cool down in this DVD.

So, this is my review. I hope it help you. I'm sorry about my poor English, I'm working on that!",1416441600,,867,4.593548387096774

I recommend starting with the tutorial, after watching the dance moves if desired--the costumes are so colorful.

No matter how many times I do this little workout, it doesn't get boring. The DVD has an option where you can turn the voice cues off if you have it memorized.

3144336,3,B0015FJYV0,"I really enjoy the work I've seen of these three dancers, and they are wonderful to watch on the DVD.  I enjoy the choreography and the graceful movements they've arranged for the workout.  The thing that ruins it for me is the cuing.  Neon's voiceover cues the movements after the dancers begin them.  I watch them carefully and try to imitate what they're doing, but since I don't know what the next movement is going to be I can't do the movement until after I'm supposed to have started.  The result is that I'm stumbling gracelessly through the movements, always a step behind the dancers, and struggling the catch up the whole way through.  It makes me feel like I can't do the movements, when the reality is that I can.  I've been doing these moves for years.  Now, if I watch this DVD and follow along enough times, I will eventually memorize the choreography and be able to do it.  I'm considering going that route, but I have so many other exercise DVDs where the instructor tells me what we're going to be doing a couple of beats ahead of time, and I don't have to memorize the entire thing in order to do it, that it's probably unlikely.",1359417600,6,1149,4.433333333333334
3144337,4,B0015FJYV0,"The instructions are nice and slow in the beginning but, then speed up a little too fast for complete beginners. I think you need to have some experience of belly dancing before tackling this one.",1354492800,,196,4.628571428571429
3144338,5,B0015FJYV0,"The workout goes for 42 minutes one with voice over and one without.  It has a step by step tutorial that is over an hour.  The tutorial is very clever, they go over the movements then use sections out of the workout to drill the moves.  I have done this workout about 5 times since I have got it and it is not boring.  I like that the 3 woman take it in turns to lead different sections and they seem like really accomplished dancers (as on some other dvds I own, the one leading it is accomplished and the others aren't at the same level of skill).  I seem to go into another space when I do this workout and time seems to stand still and the workout goes really quickly.  Other dvds I own I seem to push myself to complete the practise but this one is not like that.  The only thing it is missing is official warm-up and cool-down (although at the start they sort of do stretching belly dance moves).  So I just do my own warm-up and cool-down.  I recommend this dvd, it may be hard for a beginner belly dancer, but I'm sure it wouldn't take long to build up to doing this workout learning the moves in a class and going over the tutorial a few times.",1354406400,5,1154,4.093333333333334
3144339,5,B0015FJYV0,"A word of warning, first: it's labelled as a workout ""for beginners"", but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who has no bellydance experience; you should definitely have some familiarity with circles, eights, shimmies, and undulations before you try to do this DVD.

That said, I started using this as a way to practice after I'd done a 10-week beginner class and found it very useful to develop my muscle memory and keep myself from forgetting moves between classes. It incorporates fundamental moves (hip & chest circles, ummis, vertical and horizontal figures of 8, shoulder and hip shimmies) into a series of nonstop flows and combinations which start out very simply and get gradually more difficult. I wasn't able to do all of them all the way through the first time, but after two or three attempts, I usually had no problem. And by the end, I had a nice sweat worked up! (Sadly, this effect doesn't last - after about two months, I wasn't even breaking a sweat, so it was time to move on to Love Potion for more of a challenge. I do still go back to Luscious when I want something gentler and easier, though, so it's worth keeping around.)

Also, their costumes make it impossible to really see their legs and feet, which I think makes it more difficult to learn than it otherwise would be.  It is a decent workout though, which is why it got two stars instead of just one.",1351641600,3,384,4.0394736842105265
3144341,5,B0015FJYV0,"In addition to finding a fun way to tone my ABS, I got this Luscious Belly Dance Workout to entertain my husband. The women who do this type of dance make it look so easy. I found out fairly quickly that it was not as easy as it looked but, with continued practice I got better and better. Some movements I have mastered while others are still not as easy to me yet. The sexy dance styles are expressed through muscle control and graceful movements. My husband is very pleased with my progression and it has spiced up our life! I'm sure anyone who gets this DVD will love it! You may feel frustrated at first, especially if you haven't worked out in a while. Just take it one dance move at a time, tune in with your body movements and you will be Lusciously sexier in no time.",1351641600,,776,4.214765100671141

I love the combos and languid moves, the lovely costuming, and soothing music.  I originally bought this as a beginning dancer and some of the combos took quite a while for me to work up to, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for brand new dancers.  Otherwise, I cannot recommend this one enough.",1349654400,2,408,4.486486486486487
3144343,5,B0015FJYV0,"I totally love this DVD.  I was a bit nervous as I haven't learned much bellydance and I noticed quite a few reviews suggesting this DVD was not for a total beginner.  However, it is just the right level for me and I have found it easy to follow.  The movements are gorgeous and the combinations all quite simple.  I have found that it really does what it says on the cover - it helps ingrain the movements in my muscle memory which is just what I want.  I would say that it is more of a dance instructional DVD rather than a workout but I have felt my body being sore in parts the day after doing it (and I'm generally pretty fit) so it is definitely doing something.  Best of all I've found myself dancing the movements around the house whenever I can and really enjoying the sensuality and playfulness of it.",1347494400,3,811,4.233766233766234

It really is a great workout especially for the thighs, core (abs and back) and even your arms. I find when I use this DVD a couple of times in a week after not having used it for a bit that I really feel the results in all these areas. It's also a great form of exercise for those with joint problems as the movements massage the tissues and structures of the joint spaces, increasing range of motion and stability of joints. I find this just as good if not better than yoga for reducing the chronic joint pain and reduced mobility I get in my knees, low back and hip joints as a result of Lupus. Its tremendous fun too, especially when you start getting good at doing the different movements.",1346976000,2,864,4.274390243902439

Some people may like or dislike the technique used in these videos, but the way the dvds are made are wonderful for learning transitions while building movement recall. So begginers, these are really nice dvds. The NYC videos are really made well. The movements are introduced, broken down, and explained. Then the movements begin at the bare bones for practice and build in complexity. I really like how much the movements are repeated and the way the segments are seperated. I also like that there are voice-over options for practice. These videos are all very well thought out. Again, they are beggining level. The trailers for these dvds are lengthy and leave you with no questions about what you are buying (THANK YOU!) One minute trailers do a huge disservice to consumers, so all around, I really appreciate the amount of work and effort that goes into the making of NYC instructionsal dvds.",1346630400,4,981,4.880239520958084

By practicing with this dvd over and over I feel I am improving my flow, connection to my center, and my moves look more graceful, natural, and well, may I just say it: sexy! this dvd helps me move more sexy. which truly is my goal. The moves are so natural. Their comments while dancing are very helpful. Although they don't point it out particularly, the arm work on this dvd is so clear, simple and graceful, and you can see how the arms round out each movement and make you look more beautiful. i watch their arms and heads carefully and try to copy. I esp. love Blanca's body line section. that is just super. I practice it over and over. The dvd is very easy to navigate and bring up any section you want to practice. very relaxing and enjoyable way to spend some workout time. dance, enjoy, repeat!",1320796800,,1048,4.297979797979798

3144354,5,B0015FJYV0,"This DVD is so much fun to workout to. Although it teaches the basic moves, I'd suggest that if you are a beginnner that you get something else first (Amira or Ranya Renee, to name a couple). The reason I say that straight off is because though there is a nice tutorial in this DVD with Neon, she is in costume, which makes it hard to see exactly what is going on. Plus, I think we all benefit by learning from more than one instructor.

What I love best is dancing with these 3 great bellyists in their choreographed segments. Their costumes are lovely, the music is lovely, and you get a really good workout. I like how there are 3 dancers, as you can see how they each have their own individual expressions of these movements. I like to vary my exercise (jogging, aerobics, etc.), but with bellydancing, it is so much fun that you won't even know you're exercising!",1314403200,2,868,4.391304347826087

I have been dancing for 8 years and even though this is a beginner/intermediate dvd I still come back to it if I want a relaxing workout or I feel I need to brush up on the basics. This dvd is great because it not only shows how to break down the movements it also shows different combinations the movements can be put into. This definitely gets an A in my book.",1303257600,2,450,4.067415730337078
3144358,4,B0015FJYV0,"Luscious is a sensual, slow paced workout. The extended tutorials do a good job of breaking down the moves. The workout itself contains beautiful movements that are somewhat easy to follow, although it will take practice to develop better technique and your own artistic expression. There is even a short sample dance that you can learn to perform separately.

The problem, as other reviewers have said, is in the costuming. The costumes worn in the workout are beautiful, but they are too concealing over the dancers' legs and feet. It is difficult to see what they are doing, especially in steps that travel in a circle.

What's even more frustrating is that the step-by-step tutorial also has the same concealing costumes. When the dancer is describing the importance of bending your knees, you have to take her word for it, because her legs are covered by a long skirt. In fact, the skirt is so long that it brushes the floor and blocks most of her footwork.

Otherwise, the DVD seems to do a good job of bridging the gap between instructional dance video and workout. Just don't expect much cardio--the workout is slow, but should strengthen and sculpt muscles. On the dance side, it seems to cover very basic moves, but takes the time to explain technique (if you use the step-by-step tutorial).",1297900800,,1301,4.799107142857143
3144359,5,B0015FJYV0,"I love this DVD. It is lots of fun and before you know it, you have worked out for 30 min. After doing this a few times, I find myself doing some of the belly dancing moves to regular music on the radio. I have much better control over my hips and my husband likes the toning effect belly dancing has had on me.",1295308800,2,311,3.875
3144360,5,B0015FJYV0,"I have had this DVD for a while now along with Love Potion and I find they are very similar, so my review is essentially the same for both of them except for one major stipulation I want to make for Luscious:

THIS IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS unless you are ready for a challenge. If you do not have some grasp of basic movements and preferably simple layering you will have a very difficult time following along. I'm not sure why they advertise this for Beginners. Advanced Beginner, yes, but not true Beginners.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'll move on to all the positive things about this DVD not including the actual content it self. First, it's very affordable. I got mine when it was closer to $15 which is very well priced for a quality belly dance DVD. The video, sound, lighting and camera work are all very good. The video is clear, sound is crisp, voice overs are well done, lighting is moody but not too dark, camera angles are appropriate and camera changes are kept to a minimum. The DVD has lots of features. It has explanations on how to do the moves and how to do the combinations used in the workout. You can do the workout with voice over cues or without.

As for the actual content, the program provides a light to moderate workout that is very much like dancing as opposed to an aerobics class with some belly dance moves. I wouldn't say you will get a heavy workout like the Veena and Neena Slim Down. However, if you are looking for something that is a mix of dance practice and a workout in one then I think you will enjoy this DVD. It is 100% dance including graceful arm variations. It's a great way to work on your stamina and polishing your technique for long performances. The sessions vary in tempo starting with a slow piece. From there they alternate tempos to keep things interesting. The dancing starts off with a simple move such as a hip circle, then adds on it to make short combos that are repeated a few times, then another simple move is introduced and this process is repeated throughout. The movements match the music and are generally easy to follow although you may not get them all at first. Simple layering is used (such as hip bumps over a traveling step) but if you can't do the movement yet you can easily omit a layer or two so that you can keep up.

The dancers take turns being in the middle and that dancer does the voice over for that dance. Voice over is simple cues, tips, and bits of encouragement that are helpful and are not distracting. And you can always turn it off later if you prefer. All three of the dancers are skilled and demonstrate technique properly. They are also in perfect sync with each other making everything come together well. Their costumes are attractive and stand out well without being distracting or overly gym-ish. They're like something between practice gear and a full costume. The dancers wear pants that let you see their feet.

The music is enjoyable, but not very ""traditional"". However, I find for practice this is perfectly acceptable. The songs tend to be simple because something complicated with lots of changes would make it too hard to repeat movements and follow along. I actually really liked a lot of the music in this context.

You will like this DVD if:
-You are looking for something to practice uninterrupted dancing for long periods of time to help you build dance stamina.
-You have a grasp of basic belly dance movements and some simple layering or are not afraid to alter the movements to your needs.
-You don't mind non-traditional music for practicing.
-You don't mind voice over
-You don't mind choreography dancing and follow the leader style practice

You will not like this DVD if:
-You're totally new to belly dance or are still learning basic movements and would easily get confused if you had to add movements with traveling and arms.
-You're looking for something more aerobic or something which drills moves and/or breaks movements down and focuses on technique.
-You only want traditional music to practice to.
-You can't stand voice over
-You can't stand choreography or follow the leader practice

Overall I think this DVD is a great deal and a good practice companion for any dancer who has a grasp of basic technique (or isn't afraid of a challenge!)",1295308800,6,4284,4.576271186440678
3144361,4,B0015FJYV0,"First off, before I got this video, I knew completely nothing about belly dancing. And I am definitely a person who does not dance or has never followed a dancing choreography. When I put this in, I was glad to see there was a separate tutorial part aside from the actual workout part itself.
The tutorial part gives an idea of how the move is done but you can not see Neon's legs, as she has a long skirt on. Aside from that, though, she does tell you whether the unseen leg needs to be bent or not, but if you don't see it, it's hard to mimic. I think, like everyone else has said on here, it does a decent job of telling you what is happening next or is happening as there is also the pattern at the lower part of the screen but you have to pay close attention.
It is easy to get lost on here, especially on the workout part, which is really just the dance.
I still like it, though, and will continue to do it. I thought I was having a hard time just because I'm not a dancer, etc. but apparently, everyone is having that problem with this if they are beginners. I think, out of repetition, as with anything I could get the hang of this. I don't think I did such a bad job in the first two go arounds but adding arms is confusing!
I think this video is beautiful, the outfits are beautiful, music, etc. and does give you a good feeling by the end of the workout.
I would give this video a 5, but the beginners, I mean, super beginners, like me, probably should not purchase unless they have perserverance.",1294876800,4,1508,4.13265306122449

The company I bought it from was very gracious and sent me a replacement, which also had issues. Because it did play on my newly purchased laptop, I decided to just keep the replacement tape. However, and this is really weird,  there was a point in the tape where there was the strangest talking going on, almost like something out of The Exorcist.

The instructors are all wearing long skirts and you cannot see the knee and leg movements they are pointing out to you.  It is difficult to copy a movement that you cannot see.

Do not buy this video until you have a firm foundation in bellydance. I'm sure its great for intermediates or advanced.",1282694400,7,548,4.76595744680851

I think Luscious is a nice but challengin work out for beginners.

I did break a sweat but it was because I was trying so hard to keep up and I still was confused and lost. I never knew if my feet were positioned right or not because I could not see their feet.

3144368,1,B0015FJYV0,"I have watched/attempted the Shimmy series on FITv for a while, and wanted a DVD so I could learn more. After some research, I found the Luscious workout for beginners. I just tried this DVD a few minutes ago and I'm probably going to end up selling it on Amazon or eBay.

I have done step classes and aerobic classes before - so I am used to cues and general choreography, so I figured I could do this DVD with a bit of ease. Yeah. NO.

Let me start off saying I DID DO THE TUTORIAL section, and even then I was lost. This is ****NOT**** for beginners. I didn't expect to get all the moves on the first try, but when I'm still stuck on the first move because I can't see her legs (wearing long skirts) and her explanations are confusing - you realize it's not going to be a good workout. I need to SEE her legs/knees doing the dance! So you're confused and they move fast, then as if her one explanation would do the trick, they add arms to the move, so now it's REALLY confusing! Then in a mocking way, they show the steps all together with the dancers. Am I supposed to follow that? I just stood there and watched. Wow.

I'm very very disappointed in this DVD. I thought it would be at least the same as the FITv one, there wasn't even a warm up. I'm unsure if I'm going to try this out again, my frustration level is quite high, I think they should've broken this DVD up into a set, it's just way too much, too quick and for a true beginner.

Like I said, I did not expect to get it right away, but when I'm on tutorial one and not getting the moves right, it leaves little motivation to continue on. I figure IF I do this DVD again, I am going to have to master the tutorial, entirely, in steps, then try to move onto the workout. I'm not sure if I want to put that much time into this, when I can pop in a different exercise DVD and work up a sweat. This seemed fun, but after doing it, I wasn't having fun with it - isn't that was exercise is all about?

Unless you've done shimmy/belly dancing before, I would NOT recommend this DVD.",1274140800,26,2041,4.079800498753118

3144370,5,B0015FJYV0,"I have just started learning how to belly dance but have been looking and watching numerous videos for years before I got up the nerve to now try to do it(a 100 lbs lighter!). I have seen lots and I have to say, I just absolutely LOVE this video!! I was at first kinda turned off by the title of the video but I decided, what the heck? Give it a chance. From the first move, I was hooked! I love how Neon would do the move and then all three ladies would do the moves together to music; they danced together so effortlessly, it was beautiful to watch. The other thing was, I loved how she patiently and thoroughly explained how to do the move precisely and how not to do it so you hurt yourself. Neon really makes a struggling beginner, like me, feel like you really could do it with her kind instruction and gentle accented voice. The music, the costumes, the backdrop of the video, was exquisite and sensual! It is also great that its not one of those so-called 30 minute teaching videos that you pay an arm and a leg for and you wonder what for? and be disappointed at the amount of time they spend on technique and how they gloss over a lot to fit it into 30 minutes. I disagree, however, with people who say that this video is not for absolute beginners. It will be hard and you may stuggle for a minute but if it is too hard, go to the beginning and do tht tutorial and learn the basic moves. You can do that for a while until you can do the other beginning moves and you should be fine. If you buy this DVD, you will NOT be disappointed! The moves are authentic, the music is good and you will be learning while having a great time and getting in shape!

3144372,5,B0015FJYV0,"I had been looking for a real Belly Dance workout, that was both good practice, AND a real workout. So many DVDs are called Belly Dance workouts, and I have found them disappointing. Usually they are not a very good workout, and aren't really belly dance oriented. There ARE a lot of good instructional Belly Dance DVDs out there. But I was really looking for something that would be about a 40+ minute workout, covering most of the techniques a beginner/intermediate needs to work on. A DVD that would not require that I have the remote in hand, hunting and pecking for this or that move in some ginormous table of contents, or fast forwarding past the repeated 20 minute discussion of ""tuck your hips, chest out, shoulders back"". Finding this DVD was like finding a jewel.

This DVD is called a belly dance work out for beginners, but I will agree with another reviewer who said that it was not for rank beginners. I would say it's more for ""advanced beginners"". That said, most beginners will be able to follow most of the moves, even the first time they see it. There is a tutorial section that is broken down pretty well, and should help those who may find themselves overwhelmed, or unfamiliar with the name of a specific move (for instance, what Neon calls ""infinity loops"", my teacher calls ""figure eights"".)

If you have been taking lessons, even if it's just a couple of months, you won't have too many surprises in terms of the basic techniques. However, you MAY find some familiar techniques put together in suprisingly different, but still lovely combinations.

While I am not winded nor sweating by the end of this workout, I do feel like I am working all the joints and muscles commonly used in belly dance (class.)",1263686400,5,1730,4.647058823529412
3144373,5,B0015FJYV0,"I was pretty turned off by the 'beginner' aspect of the title, so I hesitated to purchase this DVD. After completing the workout I was really happy I did buy it.

First off, it is probably too much for absolute beginners, if you have a few class sessions under your hip scarf or have worked extensively with other DVD's you should be fine. The 'combination's' are pretty short, most only being 2 or 3 moves. Some of the names they use threw me off at first but it's all basic stuff. All of the sections are narrated by voice-over (I love listening to Neon & Blanca with their accents, but that's just me) so the voice volume is constant and you don't hear heavy breathing. There are a few lunges and deep level changes but they can easily be modified or ignored.

I really liked the contrast between the 3 dancers, and I like that its not ""4 this, 4 that"" start over. It really feels like dancing. I liked the costumes, it gave the video more interest. I could have done with out some of the cheesy empowerment shenanigans but they weren't over powering.

The first section is CIRCLES (7:31), led by Blanca. The moves covered are hip circles, 1 hip circles, pelvic circles (interior hip circles) and chest circles. There are 3 combination's in this section. The skeleton is pretty basic but they add nice arm flows (often a major issues for beginner dancers) that get you used to moving your whole body (aka actually dancing). This section is pretty relaxed and I liked the soft stretching from the large circles. Keep your abs engaged to really feel the workout.

The next section is INFINITY LOOPS (6:44)  aka Figure 8's, with Neon. The moves are horizontal 8's, chest figure 8's,  vertical figure 8's up and down (I do the down section with my feet flat, better workout  and better for the ankles) with some variations and 1 hip figure 8's. There are 8 combination's. This section moves pretty fast, typically with Neon there are a lot of quick changes; I found that they aren't always announced with enough warning. In this section you can really see the differences in the 3 dancers, I find Neon's dancing to be somewhat jarring, and I think her movements often look jerky.

The next section is UNDULATIONS (7:02) with Sarah Skinner. The moves are snake arms, side undulations (I really like how this move is broken down), up and down undulations with variations, there are 3 combination's. I think Sarah Skinner does the best job of telling you what is going to happen before it happens.

Next is HIP ACCENTS (7:57) with Neon. The moves are vertical (weighted lifts/drops) and horizontal hip slides, unweighted lifts and drops with variations, there are 8 combination's.

Next is SHIMMIES (5:43) with Sarah. She covers basic hip shimmy and twist shimmy and shoulder shimmy. There are 4 combination's.

Next is BODY LINE (5:08) with Blanca, there are a lot of sways, flourishes and accents. She also does torso drops, back arches, pivot and three step turns and arabesque. There are 6 combination's. I thought this was actually the hardest section to do while still looking `pretty'.

Last is the dance, which I honestly haven't done. Once I get the hand of the combination's a bit better I probably will. I also haven't used the tutorial sections, I didn't find that I needed them. Over all as an intermediate/advanced student I found that this was a fun work out that helped me focus in on some moves that I would like to polish and it was interesting enough that I'll do it again. I would really recommend it to anyone with at least a basic understanding of belly dance fundamentals.",1262822400,6,3591,4.655608214849921

I ordered this DVD and practice it almost everyday.  The only thing I don't like is how hard it is to tell what their legs/knees are doing under their skirts.  Until I can find a good belly dancing class/teacher where I live, I'll be following a DVD.  I definitely recommend this DVD.",1261267200,2,413,4.324675324675325

They always emphasize the fun portion while instructing the moves.

If someone is needing more instruction on technique, a tutorial section is offered. Immediately following each movement in the tutorial is a clip from the workout section that includes that specific movement. Also, the workout can be played without voice cues. I recommend getting used to doing the workout with cues, first. Excellent music choices to accompany each section of the workout. The workout includes six sections & finishes with a dance that involves many of the learned moves. The movements are strong enough to get my heart pumping after only two sections - yet they are moderate enough so that a person can do the entire workout.

3144379,5,B0015FJYV0,"This is another great DVD from WDNY  However, I would not recommend it for any Beginner Student, as I think it is more for someone at Intermediate or Advance level.  One the positive side -- I love the dance movements, the way the movements are grouped, the costumes, lighting, etc.

But on the negative side, the directions (left and right) threw me off.  I guess I am used to ""mirroring"" the dance instructor -- whether on a DVD or at a dance workshop; without using an actual mirror.  When I teach my dance classes, I use a mirror -- so when I call out left or right, it is actually left or right.

Another thing that irritated me on this DVD (and many others) is having any type of ""Welcome"" speech.  Welcome speeches and Introductions should be placed on the video, as an optional chapter feature.  You only need to hear it just ONE time!  I time my workouts and it is irritating to have to fast forward through the Welcome or Introduction each time I use a DVD.  The welcome/introductions are so inconvenient.  I find myself shouting at the TV, just shut up and get to the dancing!!!

I teach beginner students, but won't recommend this one to them (yet); but will recommend it to my more advanced or intermediate students.",1252713600,,1229,4.486486486486487

3144381,5,B0015FJYV0,Wow!  This workout/instructional video is worth every penny and more.  It is fun and fast.  I love how it breaks the moves down into categories that focus on certain areas.  Also loved the atmosphere of the instruction.  The addition of facts about the connection of the belly dance moves to different energies was a great way to incroperate the spirit-body connection in bellydance.  This IS NOT for beginners. The moves are not taught enough so that the beginner can proform at the pace of the DVD.  It goes pretty quick through each of the combinations.  I adore the final dance and feel like I've really danced and had a good low-impact workout.,1247443200,4,649,4.732142857142857

3144385,3,B0015FJYV0,"I agree with the reviewer who indicated the clothing/costume can make it difficult to see how to do the moves. With a basic understanding of bellydancing, or by doing the tutorials, you can learn the moves that are in this video (although it would be easier with a different costume choice on the part of the instructor). The instruction isn't great, but you can get an idea. However, the main problem I had with this video is the lack of cuing. There are move changes and direction changes with little to no cuing. It's difficult to follow, so I mainly just use the tutorials for practicing the basic moves. There are much better videos out there, so if you're a true beginner, spend your money on something else.",1243555200,35,714,4.5859375

But I would like to say, this is a great DVD to practice with, especially if you are a beginner bellydancer. The routines give ideas of how to put all the basic movements you have learned together. Plus, it's really fun and has a ""no pressure"" approach. You can gradually build the combination sections at your own pace. If you need a review of the movements, you can refer back to ""the step by step"" sections.

I would recomend this DVD, as a ""must add"" to your bellydance practice, especaily for the new bellydance student.",1240876800,6,619,4.5675675675675675

The instructional section really breaks down each move to ensure the viewer understands the dynamics behind each belly dance step. I am completely a beginner. I have tried other belly dance workout dvd's in the past and was very disappointed because they turned out to be cheesy and did not teach belly dance steps. This dvd makes you want to learn more. In addition to the great choreography, this dvd works up a sweat. Not as much as Zumba (my favorite workout) but you still get a decent workout.

The way the dvd is laid out, it is fairly easy to get to the specific section you want to review.  The instruction is easy to understand and follow.  If I were to make a recommendation, I would suggest increasing the camera angles.  A variety of angles would help to ensure that you are making the proper movements.

Everything is explained in minute detail. The one thing I would like to see is a longer period spent practicing each individual move - an additional minute or so. This can be achieved by rewinding with the remote, but that is a bit inconvenient. My muscles are slow to adapt to new moves, and as a non-dancer beginner I could use  more time getting comfortable.

One thing I would advise buyers is that if you have little to no experience in dance, this is NOT a workout dvd. It will not replace a cardio workout.",1237766400,5,670,4.395161290322581

The DVD is broken down into two basic parts, the workout itself (which you can either have with vocal cues or just the music) and the tutorial.

If this is you are just learning belly dance, definitely go through the entire tutorial first, this will teach you the moves used in the dance routine. Keep in mind that you will not ""get them"" right away, you'll need to practice a few times in order to master it. You'll most likely feel awkward at first, but you'll feel more comfortable as time goes on.

The video helps with first learning the actual movements, and then the transion into the next movement.

Of course it doesnt show you all you can do with every combo, but you can get a good idea of how to transition and create new combos.

Blanca teaches you about your body line, which is very improtant for belly dancers. you want to look graceful and you want the movements to be effortless.

Its great for beginners and intermediate. It helps you brush up on your skills, transitions and may teach you something new as well.

After doing that for about four days, I was ready to move on to the full workout.  I found it fun and challenging and wouldn't return it for anything.

First time, started off with the 'workout with voice cues' thinking I could listen and watch and would be able to follow what they were doing.  A couple minutes in, realized that was a big mistake... the belly dancing moves were complicated and the voice cues were confusing since I didn't know the difference between a hip circle, a pelvic circle, etc... so I pulled the menu up and back-tracked to the Tutorial section.  If you haven't belly danced before, you'll want to start at the Tutorial!!  Much better :)
OK, so the tutorial is thorough and clearly explains/demonstrates each of the moves... provides the opportunity to practice them a few times, then follow along with a little combination series incorporating the move you've just learned with 1 or 2 of the moves earlier in the tutorial.  Once through the whole tutorial (day 1), I was able to go back and do the workout with the voiceovers (day 2 -- the tutorial is fairly long!), because now the little comments made sense!  Which is to say that I could follow their movements and at least knew what I was supposed to be doing, but probably not doing it completely right -- that will take a bit more practice!

The workout is a lot of fun and goes very quickly (it's not boring).  Would put intensity level at light to moderate, (light sweat, but not out of breath...)  Fun!",1231545600,13,1484,4.590909090909091

3144417,4,B0015FJYV0,"This DVD is quite enjoyable...it is a great way for the belly dancer to refine his/her techniques and get a full dance workout. The content of the video seems to have more of an artistic approach, as opposed to just doing one drill after another. (Don't get me wrong, drills are great, but sometimes I get bored with them and I just want to dance!) The combos flow nicely together and the choice of music fits well in each section. The fact that it is put together to feel more like a dance performance than a workout makes the time go by faster!

Only a couple of things on the negative side.  I would not recommend this for a beginner belly dancer. This DVD is best suited for an experienced dancer; someone who has taken classes for awhile (perhaps at the advanced beginner or intermediate level) and understands the basic principles of belly dance technique and has a solid foundation. Videos are a great tool for practice but it is usually beneficial to get feedback from a teacher in person, especially when you are learning belly dance for the first time. That way you can avoid bad habits that could lead to injuries, such as a lowback strain from doing hip infinity loops.

The other negative thing, (and this is just my personal opinion), is that I would have preferred a cool down and stretch at the end of the workout.  But that is pretty minor since a person can easily stretch on their own without video guidance!

Overall a well thought out video...something I will be adding to my home practice for sure!",1228089600,4,1520,4.532846715328467

I first started with bellydance 7 years ago but continue to learn and find the best methods in which I learn. Using the tutorial section where the move is taught then demonstrated by a clip of the workout it shows up in, I could get a nice little workout. When the 'practice' part of the tutorial plays it is with music only. I found that to be a great option for those who get overloaded with trying to listen to the voice over instructions while watching what the dancers are doing next. So, it's not just a great workout done in sections and as one big workout- but a great tool for the more advanced bellydance student in drilling transitions.",1227225600,2,810,4.198717948717949

Luscious is packed with more moves than I've ever seen in any other bellydance video. I think that Drills Drills Drills and this video make up a great combination. The dancing is beautiful and the costumes and music do inspire.

Luscious has tutorial sections where the moves are explained and then shown in the context of the movie. You can practice every section after the corresponding tutorial or you can dance through the sections from the beginning.

The sections are called:
Circles where you learn pelvic circles, hip circles, chest circles, and one hip circles, aka Moroccan hip circles.

Infinity loops which goes through vertical figure eights, chest figure eights, horizontal figure eights, one hip figure eights, and mayas.

Undulations which practice side undulations, reverse undulations
Hip lifts and drops
Shimmys

The workout leaves me really exausted, but very happy with my results. Their explanations are very good and the global quality of this product is fantastic. Especialy the visual one!

3144424,5,B0015FJYV0,"For the price, you get what amounts to a 'two-fer': an instructional video--sort of a short form of Neon's ""instant bellydancer"" series that lasts 50 minutes, and a 45 minute connected workout.  The instructional section has Neon's typical focus on proper posture and alignment as well as her wonderful way of conceptualizing the moves.  If you've never ever ever bellydanced before, this might require a few watchings to get the moves right, because she's a real stickler on form. It's that focus on form, though, that a) keeps you safe physically (no hyperextending or dangerous twisting) and b) works the deep muscles that show real control and grace.  It's worth it to learn how to dance with proper form!

If you already know a bit about dance, jump right into the workout.  There's plenty to keep even intermediate level dancers involved--incorporating arm movements, studying how they put together combinations, etc, so don't pass this one up as too basic. It's harder than the BellyTwins stuff! It may take you a time or two to get all the moves down yourself!

The production value, especially for bellydance videos, is high.  The dancers are easy to see and well lit, you can see their knees and feet and what they're doing to create the movement.  The music isn't too loud or too soft and there's no distracting background.

 This video showcases a series of moves and puts them together in short combinations of anything from two to five moves.  An advanced dancer could profit from this video studying how they put the combinations together--the interplay of soft and hard movements, upper and lower body movements, and transitions.

Bellydance has lately seemed to bifurcate into the camp that thinks dance should be hard and extreme and damaging on the body--if you're not doing aerial Turkish knee drops, you're a poseur--and the camp that thinks that bellydance is something all women of all ages should be able to do and do safely.  Neon is in this latter camp, but her moves, though safe on the joints, are not simplistic.  I've seen women struggle with the one-hip figure eight for a long time.  So there's complexity here, but a complexity you can achieve with practice.",1223596800,14,2191,4.883783783783784

I am pushing into my one year in belly dancing, and i found this video informative, creative and simply divine. the music is perfect for each section. I never got bored with this workout because of how each dancer lead the section and the different costumes. My arms and thighs alone burned with satisfaction.

I also found Neon's instruction in the 'step-by-step' section very helpful. This section is great for thoes who do not have any background. For thoes who have background, the section makes a great check and drill.

No matter your size, this workout really works out most of the target areas.",1223251200,,658,4.7631578947368425

3144428,5,B0015FJYV0,"I love Neon's dance style:  no shimmies, lots of complicated hip movement; fast and very fluid; nothing that would make a dancer feel socially awkward in a club. However, she's too fast for some people, on some of her other DVDs.  (I was a professional Pilates instructor for five years--that doesn't mean I can dance.)

In this beautiful, inspiring series of bellydance moves (arms, circles, hips), the movements are done just slowly enough and repetitively enough that a beginner can do them the first or second time through.

The costuming is elaborate, detailed, and perfect for beginners to follow:  there is enough of a reflective surface on the hips and chest so that you are able to see the movements really well.  The hip belts have points on each side that make it a lot easier to see the hip movements. Even the skirts have slits so that when the dancers kick out a foot, you can see what the feet are doing.

I have a very short list of bellydance DVD's that are appropriate for true beginners:  this is on that list, and it's one of the best; it's inspiring, beautifully shot, and easy to follow.",1221696000,5,1109,4.593908629441624

 I am an an advanced belly dancer who performs and choreographs for other dancers, I  also come from a Middle Eastern family, so I am generally a hypercritical malcontent when it comes to Belly dance DVDs. However, this one is like nothing I have ever purchased before and yet it is everything I have ever wanted in a practice conditioning workout, but didn't know how to articulate. Not only do the beautiful dancers on the DVD lead you straight into the ""Goddess Zone"" but they also keep you there long enough to heal and nurture your body, soul and mind. If you concentrate and perform every movement as it is meant to be executed you will get more of a workout than you realize. It is only a few hours after you dance this out, will your body tell you what has happened. Your internal organs will glow, any physical injuries will start to self heal and your confidence and inner sensuality and joy will radiate from every pore.

It's good to see the slight variations, how each dancer tailored each move to suit her body and style. Also, having the moves taught in such a non-stop, flowing manner helps with figuring out how to connect moves and create routines.

Here, you get a lot of information for the price, plus gorgeous costumes, and skilled, enthusiastic dancers.  Also quite nice, they give the names of the songs and the musicians in the credits.",1220832000,4,516,4.775280898876405

It's exactly what I've been looking for and I like that there are transitions and combinations I haven't seen before. This is perfect for someone who just wants to dance, not drill moves, not learn a specific choreography and is looking for some new ways of putting moves together. The moves they use are beautiful and make you feel beautiful and serene while you practice them. I think it will add grace and elegance to your dance.

Lovely to watch, with costumes and staging. I like the onscreen directions, I like the option to play without voice-over, I like the breakdown section, I like that they swap over, I like that it moves at the right pace for me when I'm tired and stiff. The only small quibble is with Neon who can't seem to isolate her hips when shimmy'ing in some of the sections - but she doesn't lead those parts and she is beautiful to watch nevertheless. I think I would have to buy Blanca's sensual bellydance after watching her here, I think she is fantastic. Definitely worth the small price, which is only the cost of a lesson in any case!

The instructors execute each move exquisitely, showing their expertise and beauty. They are simply inspiring. Using combinations instead of drills, this feels more like a class and less like a workout. It is just so much fun.

I love it because it combines learning a new workout while also learning about an ephemeral art (dancing). The only drawback is that the workout is 45 minutes and I would prefer 20 minute ""mini workouts"" but that can be remedied nicely by simply stopping the DVD after 20 minutes because you learn a series of movements a la workshop.

I have some dance background, and I agree, it was challenging at first, but they teach how to do the moves correctly.  I think a more basic beginner DVD is a good idea, so you learn to protect your lower back.

3378794,4,B0015FJYV0,"Prior to buying this DVD, I had been working out with Rania's Weight Loss for Beginners:Hip Hop, Hip Drop. Her DVD is a workout that includes belly dance moves that are more basic.
 When I first tried Lucsious: Bellydancing for beginners, it was hard for me to follow some of the moves. The instructor went over each move but seemed to rush the teaching of each move a little bit. Then after each move learned there is a practice session a "" mini-workout"".
 I would recommend both Rania's DVD and Luscious with the caveat that you need to build up your stamina first with an easier DVD like Rania's.
 Luscious is for people that already might have some knowledge of basic moves and would like to move on to more challenging moves.
 Luscious is produced by World Dance Studios in New York and the dancers are professionals in full costume. It is a dance instructional workout.
 Whichever one you choose, realize that it takes time to build up the strength and physical skills to bellydance. Persevere, and you will learn how to bellydance.",1213574400,9,1038,4.6502732240437155
3378795,4,B0015FJYV0,"One of the things that attracted me to this workout is that it advertises itself as being for beginners.  This isn't quite true.  If you've never done bellydance before, then this is not a DVD for you.  It's lovely and lush, and each of the instructors are talented in their own right, but a rank beginner will find the moves hard to follow.

The DVD does include a tutorial section, which is a bonus.  I wish, however, that they had filmed it differently.  The tutorial appears to be filmed on the same stage on which the workout is performed, when a studio with mirrors to show more angles of Neon (who is the only instructor performing the tutorials) might be more advantageous.  Neon is also dressed in a performance costume, which is a bit distracting and which makes it hard to follow sometimes, particularly in traveling moves and the movements of her knees.  The tutorial for each move also seems a bit short at times, with more time being devoted to an accompanying clip demonstrating the move's use in the workout.

The workout itself is more satisfying.  The vocal prompts are in general quite good, and I particularly like that there is an indication on-screen as to which move or combination is being performed.  The workout is balanced and well-paced, building moves from each previous section as it progresses, and the musical accompaniment is appropriate.  The angle changes are occasionally odd and distracting, but don't detract too much from the quality of the workout itself.

Although it purports to be for beginners, I would not recommend this as one's first bellydance DVD purchase, unless they've already had some instruction.  For those without access to an instructor, it might be better to start with another DVD that better breaks down the basics, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bellydance-Basics-and-Beyond-Technique-for-a-Solid-Foundation/dp/B000FSL8WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bellydance Basics and Beyond: Technique for a Solid Foundation</a>&nbsp;(another World Dance New York title).  If you've mastered the basics, though, then this will be a fun, relaxed workout, well worth the money.",1212451200,75,2175,5.41246290801187
3378796,5,B0015FJYV0,"Too exquisite to be called a workout, this seven-part ""danceout"" as I like to call it, is beauty in motion. The three absolute goddesses who draw you warmly, elegantly, charmingly into the beautiful world of bellydancing, look every bit luscious. Dressed in equally luscious costumes, they create an atmosphere that totally fills your mind even as you watch on your screen.

While Neon, Blanca and Sarah may look as if they're dancing the most impossibly beautiful moves, the bellydance beginner can join in. Conceptualized and choreographed by Neon, who has produced numerous instructional videos that have spread bellydancing to many places in the world, this video is targeted at beginners. And it includes the ""simpler"" moves. If you've recently begun bellydancing and have a  video or two focusing on basic technique or better still, if you're taking classes, Luscious will be a lovely way to practice them in a connected, smooth, flowing way. I won't describe each section because other reviewers have done so and the video clip does a great job of telling you what to expect. But I will say, that for the absolute beginner, there's a natural sort of break up in each segment which makes it easier to work with the video a little bit at a time. Another really useful touch is that in the tutorial section, led by Neon, each set of isolations ends with an extract from the danceout. You can use that to practice putting the moves into action.

The tutorial section is very thorough and the moves are explained very thoroughly at a pace which a beginner will have no trouble with. For anyone not familiar with Neon, she's particularly experienced with clear, precise and ever-so-gentle explanations and demonstrations of dance movements. She happens to be the one who started me off on belly dancing as a video-only learner and several years later I'm amazed to have reached a happy level with no injury.

For more experienced dancers, this is a wonderful video to deepen, intensify and beautify the basic moves without the usual almost-military drills we do. Use it to focus fully on engaging the abs and back while doing a full 45 minutes to strengthen the moves you'll use most often. There are combinations and arm moves sprinkled through the sessions - so it feels like a long, long leisurely dance. It's a very pleasurable way to go through all your moves, for all body zones. It reminds me a little, conceptually, of Jehan's Ultimate Fitness, which of course is a fast-paced advanced workout with complex movements and layering.

Two things need a special mention and that's the absolutely gorgeous costumes and the music. The costumes contribute significantly to how this whole video looks and the aura that it creates. They're lush and totally mouth watering. The music. Ah. There are 17 (if I counted correctly) tracks used here. They're beautifully selected and  add so much richness to the dance. The most-featured artists are DJ Mosavo and Solace. I've got myself an entire Luscious playlist because the music is so very pretty.",1211068800,14,3045,4.925925925925926
3378797,5,B0015FJYV0,"Luscious
Neon, Blanca, and Sarah, star performers from World Dance New York are here to bring you into a new concept to weight loss,by loving yourself and gently flowing into deep core belly dance basic elements that are sensual and feminine yet sneak right in and tone, strengthen the spine, build fluidity and grace. The concept here is that continuous movements with ease will accomplish more than hard impact work outs that are short-lived.
This program runs approximately two hours. It is a work out implementing belly dance moves with clear concise instruction from each dancer.
A tutorial section including undulations, infinity loops, circles, hip accents, body line, shimmy; carefully dissected with details that comprise each section. For example, in the body line section, Neon breaks down the arabesque, the back bend, or arch and three step turn.
The workout is divided into sections:
Circles, Infinity loops, Hip work, Undulations, Shimmy, Body Line. In conclusion, a beautiful dance bringing together all the combinations used in the program.
 The work out is complete with voice cues, or music only. The music is an added bonus, simply because it is beautiful! There is plenty of repetition and each section is easy to learn.
This program is complete and versatile enough for the beginner or the seasoned dancer who wants a great warm up, cool down with a gentle and effective practice while developing deep core strength and most importantly, fluid movement.
I enjoyed every aspect of this work out and look forward to it as a personal work out; gentle but effective therefore building stamina and stamina burns calories.  The instruction is easy to follow, each dancer is knowledgeable, and clear to point. Their costumes are colorful and beautifully detailed as to coordinate with each other. The setting is simple and not distracting, the lighting enhances the dancer their movement, topped off by the music.
Overall, aside from delightful, the choreographies added at the end of each section will ""engrain into muscle memory"" all the basic moves that  can take any level dancer into a daily dance ritual to embrace their feminine goddess. Make this your personal workout, and who knows, someone may comment, that you do look luscious!",1210809600,3,2255,5.138964577656676
3378798,5,B0015FJYV0,"Did we really need another bellydance-based workout? I wouldn't have thought so, but Neon, as usual, has gone and proven my expectations wrong.

""Luscious"" is an exquisitely made program, with more good qualities than I can enumerate. The costumes and setting are gorgeous -- nothing like the typical brightly-lit aerobics studio -- and Neon advises you at the beginning to dress up for it and join the three dancers here in making the movement special. This is the kind of thing that sounds cheesy, but I did it, and it makes sense: how will you forget about bad body image or those extra pounds if you're wearing ugly workout wear? Dressing up makes you feel like you're dancing, not punishing yourself.

The instruction itself is taught in sections themed ""Circles,"" ""Infinity Loops,"" ""Undulations,"" ""Hip Accents,"" ""Shimmy,"" and ""Body Line."" Each dancer leads two of the sections: she stands at the front and her voiceover describes the movements to be done. What I really like about this is that the sections weren't assigned randomly; instead, each section bears the particular dancer's imprint, and showcases her strengths. It's subtle, but you start to notice that Neon leads complicated, quick-changing combinations, Blanca shows her wonderful, large, and sensuous movements, and Sarah Skinner adds an upbeat Turkish feel to the shimmy section. This made the instructors seem much less like exchangeable dancing bodies, and much more like teachers with particular areas of expertise.

The movements are varied, and quite a few combinations are introduced and repeated from two to six times. This is not a ""four of this and four of that"" drill. In fact, I would suggest that complete beginners start with a different video. This would be great for advanced beginners like me, who are not expert enough for a complicated choreo with tons of layering, but get bored when everything comes in fours and is repeated ad infinitum.

All along, the dancers offer tips on putting emotion into the steps, on maintaining form, and on making movements deeper and stronger. While the dancing is rarely fast-paced, the slowness of the movements is often more challenging and grueling. The workout made me sweat (though it might not make everyone), but more importantly, it challenged me to maintain grace, form, and muscle control while learning the combinations. I couldn't believe it when the forty-five minutes were over -- it felt like fifteen!

If you have weak knees, you might want to be careful with some of the lunges and plies; on the other hand, there aren't a lot of them, and they're done slowly enough that you can be careful. I'll also repeat the warning that this might be a little hard for complete beginners who aren't already good at picking up choreography. However, the video does have a well-indexed instructional section which describes all the movements used in the workout. As a step up, there's a version of the workout with music alone, and no voice over.

In case my enthusiasm wasn't clear enough, I really think WDNY has a winner with this video. It's simple, but also simple enough to do regularly and to grow into. At the same time, even once you have learned the step combinations, adding graceful arm and handwork (to say nothing of being aware of facial expressions, head positions, and dancer's poise) poses an extra layer of difficulty. And finally, the movements are, quite simply, beautiful. You will be happy to be dancing.",1210809600,232,3456,4.9809358752166375
3378799,5,B0015FJYV0,"I found this DVD to be very enjoyable.  The instruction portion is very

to ease back into it.  This is easing me back into it and I'm loving it!

3378800,5,B0015FJYV0,"""Luscious"" is a terrific bellydance instruction DVD geared towards beginners, though intermediate students may enjoy and learn from it too, as Neon, Blanca, and Sarah are superb dancers and teachers, and the choreography is varied enough to find interest and enjoyment for a very long time.

After the ""Welcome"" by Neon, the dancers guide you through the moves, each taking their turn at being in the front and doing the teaching. There is also the option of a ""Step by Step Tutorial,"" which explains each move in detail, as well as an option to practice just with the music, without the voice-over instructions. The music is marvelous, all with a traditional flavor in its instrumentation and melodies.

Your instructors:
Neon is a stunning blonde born in Russia; a famed dancer, teacher, and choreographer, whose technique is dazzling, and creativity amazing. She has helped bring the art of bellydance to a new level. Blanca is a goddess. Born in Mexico, her sensual style and grace have few equals. Sarah Skinner is a dancer I'm less familiar with, but she is incredibly impressive and beautiful, and fits in well with Neon and Blanca. These 3 dancers are the epitome of ""The Three Graces.""

""Luscious"" is very well produced, and the dancers are filmed in a simple stage setting with excellent lighting, making it easy to discern and follow the movements. The costuming is also lovely, in shades of teal and red, and adds to the visual beauty of the program. This is a great way to learn bellydancing, relieve stress, get your exercise and have fun at the same time. If you want weight loss, many experts agree that the best way to lose is through doing continual movement as is done on this DVD, rather than in aerobics. ""Luscious"" is a superb DVD for your dance instruction library, and if you're just starting out with bellydancing, it will inspire you to keep practicing and learning.",1210550400,52,1892,4.833333333333333

The dance examples are too challenging for me but I could see myself doing most of it if I stick to it. Really helps to have a mirror. I recommend you look them and neon up and other tutorials on youtube as there are some small tips which made some of the movement easier and could see the legs better or differently. A confidence booster but I am thinking it would be better to combine or just sign up for dance classes instead if you are serious about learning. I am sore already. I looked up love potion online and I like the movements the way they looked on this one, as well as read reviews. They do have first steps which I would have done but I want dance not just steps, well nothing is instant or comes easy, so I do appreciate the work and it has me re-interested in dance.

3378811,3,B0015FJYV0,"I'm a beginner/advanced beginner bellydancer, and I was looking for a DVD that teachs me a few combos and feel like I'm dancing and not make a serie of repetitions of the movement. I think this DVD comply with this function. On the Tutorial section, Neon explains you, briefly, and practice, the movements you will use in the workout section. I recommend go over this part of the DVD for the first time.
On Workout Section, Neon, Blanca, and Sarah Skinner, guide you in a complete 45 minutes workout. They breakdown and practice a serie of combinatios progressively and finally you are dancing a combination. I love this section, because you can review and practice your movements while you are dancing. despite everything, I miss a warm up and a cool down in this DVD.

So, this is my review. I hope it help you. I'm sorry about my poor English, I'm working on that!",1416441600,,867,4.593548387096774

I definitely think a beginner can learn a lot from this DVD and look great in no time for a home dance. I recommend starting with the tutorial, after watching the dance moves if desired--the costumes are so colorful. I love this DVD, but think of all the DVDs I've seen and purchased, Sarah Skinner's Opulent Moves is the best one for teaching a beginner a few terrific moves for the home dance.",1413849600,,568,4.69

Theres a few sections and some combos that are put together (including a body line section which is a great cooldown- Bianca is so graceful it blows me away) and a dance at the end. It's pretty fun! No matter how many times I do this little workout, it doesn't get boring. The DVD has an option where you can turn the voice cues off if you have it memorized. If you are having issues doing some of the moves there is a section of the DVD where they break it down for you :)

3378827,5,B0015FJYV0,I love neons on camera personality in the tutorial section. The workout I felt was easy to follow and fun. I thought the cueing was great. They don't over explain since there's a tutorial section to give detail. I liked the outfits. I didn't think they obstructed my understanding of what legs were doing. I can see myself enjoying this workout for a long time. I must say it has given me a better self image by the end of every workout. I think this would be fun for friend to do together or mothers and daughters. Its sexy without being trashy.

3378833,3,B0015FJYV0,"I really enjoy the work I've seen of these three dancers, and they are wonderful to watch on the DVD.  I enjoy the choreography and the graceful movements they've arranged for the workout.  The thing that ruins it for me is the cuing.  Neon's voiceover cues the movements after the dancers begin them.  I watch them carefully and try to imitate what they're doing, but since I don't know what the next movement is going to be I can't do the movement until after I'm supposed to have started.  The result is that I'm stumbling gracelessly through the movements, always a step behind the dancers, and struggling the catch up the whole way through.  It makes me feel like I can't do the movements, when the reality is that I can.  I've been doing these moves for years.  Now, if I watch this DVD and follow along enough times, I will eventually memorize the choreography and be able to do it.  I'm considering going that route, but I have so many other exercise DVDs where the instructor tells me what we're going to be doing a couple of beats ahead of time, and I don't have to memorize the entire thing in order to do it, that it's probably unlikely.",1359417600,6,1149,4.433333333333334
3378834,4,B0015FJYV0,"The instructions are nice and slow in the beginning but, then speed up a little too fast for complete beginners. I think you need to have some experience of belly dancing before tackling this one.",1354492800,,196,4.628571428571429
3378835,5,B0015FJYV0,"The workout goes for 42 minutes one with voice over and one without.  It has a step by step tutorial that is over an hour.  The tutorial is very clever, they go over the movements then use sections out of the workout to drill the moves.  I have done this workout about 5 times since I have got it and it is not boring.  I like that the 3 woman take it in turns to lead different sections and they seem like really accomplished dancers (as on some other dvds I own, the one leading it is accomplished and the others aren't at the same level of skill).  I seem to go into another space when I do this workout and time seems to stand still and the workout goes really quickly.  Other dvds I own I seem to push myself to complete the practise but this one is not like that.  The only thing it is missing is official warm-up and cool-down (although at the start they sort of do stretching belly dance moves).  So I just do my own warm-up and cool-down.  I recommend this dvd, it may be hard for a beginner belly dancer, but I'm sure it wouldn't take long to build up to doing this workout learning the moves in a class and going over the tutorial a few times.",1354406400,5,1154,4.093333333333334
3378836,5,B0015FJYV0,"A word of warning, first: it's labelled as a workout ""for beginners"", but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who has no bellydance experience; you should definitely have some familiarity with circles, eights, shimmies, and undulations before you try to do this DVD.

That said, I started using this as a way to practice after I'd done a 10-week beginner class and found it very useful to develop my muscle memory and keep myself from forgetting moves between classes. It incorporates fundamental moves (hip & chest circles, ummis, vertical and horizontal figures of 8, shoulder and hip shimmies) into a series of nonstop flows and combinations which start out very simply and get gradually more difficult. I wasn't able to do all of them all the way through the first time, but after two or three attempts, I usually had no problem. And by the end, I had a nice sweat worked up! (Sadly, this effect doesn't last - after about two months, I wasn't even breaking a sweat, so it was time to move on to Love Potion for more of a challenge. I do still go back to Luscious when I want something gentler and easier, though, so it's worth keeping around.)

One thing I wasn't terribly fond of was the occasional bit of ""inner goddess"" talk; I know this is part of WDNY's schtick so I tolerate it, but it always seems so unnecessary!",1351814400,3,1325,4.586497890295359
3378837,2,B0015FJYV0,"The video and audio quality are terrible, but since I didn't get a chance to use the video right away, it was too late to return it by the time I did.  Also, their costumes make it impossible to really see their legs and feet, which I think makes it more difficult to learn than it otherwise would be.  It is a decent workout though, which is why it got two stars instead of just one.",1351641600,3,384,4.0394736842105265
3378838,5,B0015FJYV0,"In addition to finding a fun way to tone my ABS, I got this Luscious Belly Dance Workout to entertain my husband. The women who do this type of dance make it look so easy. I found out fairly quickly that it was not as easy as it looked but, with continued practice I got better and better. Some movements I have mastered while others are still not as easy to me yet. The sexy dance styles are expressed through muscle control and graceful movements. My husband is very pleased with my progression and it has spiced up our life! I'm sure anyone who gets this DVD will love it! You may feel frustrated at first, especially if you haven't worked out in a while. Just take it one dance move at a time, tune in with your body movements and you will be Lusciously sexier in no time.",1351641600,,776,4.214765100671141

I love the combos and languid moves, the lovely costuming, and soothing music.  I originally bought this as a beginning dancer and some of the combos took quite a while for me to work up to, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for brand new dancers.  Otherwise, I cannot recommend this one enough.",1349654400,2,408,4.486486486486487
3378840,5,B0015FJYV0,"I totally love this DVD.  I was a bit nervous as I haven't learned much bellydance and I noticed quite a few reviews suggesting this DVD was not for a total beginner.  However, it is just the right level for me and I have found it easy to follow.  The movements are gorgeous and the combinations all quite simple.  I have found that it really does what it says on the cover - it helps ingrain the movements in my muscle memory which is just what I want.  I would say that it is more of a dance instructional DVD rather than a workout but I have felt my body being sore in parts the day after doing it (and I'm generally pretty fit) so it is definitely doing something.  Best of all I've found myself dancing the movements around the house whenever I can and really enjoying the sensuality and playfulness of it.",1347494400,3,811,4.233766233766234
3378841,5,B0015FJYV0,"I love this DVD, and use it all the time. It breaks down the various techniques into easy to follow steps before bringing a variety of steps together in a creative form. It really is a great workout especially for the thighs, core (abs and back) and even your arms. I find when I use this DVD a couple of times in a week after not having used it for a bit that I really feel the results in all these areas. It's also a great form of exercise for those with joint problems as the movements massage the tissues and structures of the joint spaces, increasing range of motion and stability of joints. I find this just as good if not better than yoga for reducing the chronic joint pain and reduced mobility I get in my knees, low back and hip joints as a result of Lupus. Its tremendous fun too, especially when you start getting good at doing the different movements.",1346976000,2,864,4.274390243902439
3378842,5,B0015FJYV0,"I highly reccomend this dvd to beggining students who need to build muscle memory. Some people may like or dislike the technique used in these videos, but the way the dvds are made are wonderful for learning transitions while building movement recall. So begginers, these are really nice dvds. The NYC videos are really made well. The movements are introduced, broken down, and explained. Then the movements begin at the bare bones for practice and build in complexity. I really like how much the movements are repeated and the way the segments are seperated. I also like that there are voice-over options for practice. These videos are all very well thought out. Again, they are beggining level. The trailers for these dvds are lengthy and leave you with no questions about what you are buying (THANK YOU!) One minute trailers do a huge disservice to consumers, so all around, I really appreciate the amount of work and effort that goes into the making of NYC instructionsal dvds.",1346630400,4,981,4.880239520958084
3378843,4,B0015FJYV0,"The quality of moves and style is excellent.  For those familar, the moves are real, and it is a good work out.

The problem is that my blu ray player does not go to the menus, as it should. Instead it launchs right into the routines.  The educational content is good, but if one doesn't catch that the menus are fouled up, it's likely to look harder than it's supposed to be.

After using the tape for a few weeks, I joined a belly dancing class that really helped me put it together.
In retrospect, I could have kept doing the tape and eventually got through all the moves.  I think its a perfect beginner tape that i keep doing!",1330819200,,425,4.2875
3378846,5,B0015FJYV0,"This is definitely more like learning dance than it is like an exercise workout. And who needs those boring exercise workouts? With this, you learn dance moves that you can incorporate and use however you please. It's not so much a workout as it is dance practice and drills. But it's presented very well, so that while you're getting the repetitions, you still look and feel like you're dancing. Great choreography, on the whole. Get it to add to your bellydance collection.

I like that alot. By practicing with this dvd over and over I feel I am improving my flow, connection to my center, and my moves look more graceful, natural, and well, may I just say it: sexy! this dvd helps me move more sexy. which truly is my goal. The moves are so natural. Their comments while dancing are very helpful. Although they don't point it out particularly, the arm work on this dvd is so clear, simple and graceful, and you can see how the arms round out each movement and make you look more beautiful. i watch their arms and heads carefully and try to copy. I esp. love Blanca's body line section. that is just super. I practice it over and over. The dvd is very easy to navigate and bring up any section you want to practice. very relaxing and enjoyable way to spend some workout time. dance, enjoy, repeat!",1320796800,,1048,4.297979797979798

The music with the verbal cue mode really helps make and right moves and direct most of the postures. The belly dance is more for body sculpture than cardiac workout. Overall, good program!",1315699200,,271,4.666666666666667
3378851,5,B0015FJYV0,"This DVD is so much fun to workout to. Although it teaches the basic moves, I'd suggest that if you are a beginnner that you get something else first (Amira or Ranya Renee, to name a couple). The reason I say that straight off is because though there is a nice tutorial in this DVD with Neon, she is in costume, which makes it hard to see exactly what is going on. Plus, I think we all benefit by learning from more than one instructor.

What I love best is dancing with these 3 great bellyists in their choreographed segments. Their costumes are lovely, the music is lovely, and you get a really good workout. I like how there are 3 dancers, as you can see how they each have their own individual expressions of these movements. I like to vary my exercise (jogging, aerobics, etc.), but with bellydancing, it is so much fun that you won't even know you're exercising!",1314403200,2,868,4.391304347826087

3378854,5,B0015FJYV0,"Having a collection of about a 100 bellydance dvds, this has to be one of my favorites. I have been dancing for 8 years and even though this is a beginner/intermediate dvd I still come back to it if I want a relaxing workout or I feel I need to brush up on the basics. This dvd is great because it not only shows how to break down the movements it also shows different combinations the movements can be put into. This definitely gets an A in my book.",1303257600,2,450,4.067415730337078
3378855,4,B0015FJYV0,"Luscious is a sensual, slow paced workout. The extended tutorials do a good job of breaking down the moves. The workout itself contains beautiful movements that are somewhat easy to follow, although it will take practice to develop better technique and your own artistic expression. There is even a short sample dance that you can learn to perform separately.

The problem, as other reviewers have said, is in the costuming. The costumes worn in the workout are beautiful, but they are too concealing over the dancers' legs and feet. It is difficult to see what they are doing, especially in steps that travel in a circle.

What's even more frustrating is that the step-by-step tutorial also has the same concealing costumes. When the dancer is describing the importance of bending your knees, you have to take her word for it, because her legs are covered by a long skirt. In fact, the skirt is so long that it brushes the floor and blocks most of her footwork.

Otherwise, the DVD seems to do a good job of bridging the gap between instructional dance video and workout. Just don't expect much cardio--the workout is slow, but should strengthen and sculpt muscles. On the dance side, it seems to cover very basic moves, but takes the time to explain technique (if you use the step-by-step tutorial).",1297900800,,1301,4.799107142857143
3378856,5,B0015FJYV0,"I love this DVD. It is lots of fun and before you know it, you have worked out for 30 min. After doing this a few times, I find myself doing some of the belly dancing moves to regular music on the radio. I have much better control over my hips and my husband likes the toning effect belly dancing has had on me.",1295308800,2,311,3.875
3378857,5,B0015FJYV0,"I have had this DVD for a while now along with Love Potion and I find they are very similar, so my review is essentially the same for both of them except for one major stipulation I want to make for Luscious:

THIS IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS unless you are ready for a challenge. If you do not have some grasp of basic movements and preferably simple layering you will have a very difficult time following along. I'm not sure why they advertise this for Beginners. Advanced Beginner, yes, but not true Beginners.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I'll move on to all the positive things about this DVD not including the actual content it self. First, it's very affordable. I got mine when it was closer to $15 which is very well priced for a quality belly dance DVD. The video, sound, lighting and camera work are all very good. The video is clear, sound is crisp, voice overs are well done, lighting is moody but not too dark, camera angles are appropriate and camera changes are kept to a minimum. The DVD has lots of features. It has explanations on how to do the moves and how to do the combinations used in the workout. You can do the workout with voice over cues or without.

As for the actual content, the program provides a light to moderate workout that is very much like dancing as opposed to an aerobics class with some belly dance moves. I wouldn't say you will get a heavy workout like the Veena and Neena Slim Down. However, if you are looking for something that is a mix of dance practice and a workout in one then I think you will enjoy this DVD. It is 100% dance including graceful arm variations. It's a great way to work on your stamina and polishing your technique for long performances. The sessions vary in tempo starting with a slow piece. From there they alternate tempos to keep things interesting. The dancing starts off with a simple move such as a hip circle, then adds on it to make short combos that are repeated a few times, then another simple move is introduced and this process is repeated throughout. The movements match the music and are generally easy to follow although you may not get them all at first. Simple layering is used (such as hip bumps over a traveling step) but if you can't do the movement yet you can easily omit a layer or two so that you can keep up.

The dancers take turns being in the middle and that dancer does the voice over for that dance. Voice over is simple cues, tips, and bits of encouragement that are helpful and are not distracting. And you can always turn it off later if you prefer. All three of the dancers are skilled and demonstrate technique properly. They are also in perfect sync with each other making everything come together well. Their costumes are attractive and stand out well without being distracting or overly gym-ish. They're like something between practice gear and a full costume. The dancers wear pants that let you see their feet.

The music is enjoyable, but not very ""traditional"". However, I find for practice this is perfectly acceptable. The songs tend to be simple because something complicated with lots of changes would make it too hard to repeat movements and follow along. I actually really liked a lot of the music in this context.

You will like this DVD if:
-You are looking for something to practice uninterrupted dancing for long periods of time to help you build dance stamina.
-You have a grasp of basic belly dance movements and some simple layering or are not afraid to alter the movements to your needs.
-You don't mind non-traditional music for practicing.
-You don't mind voice over
-You don't mind choreography dancing and follow the leader style practice

You will not like this DVD if:
-You're totally new to belly dance or are still learning basic movements and would easily get confused if you had to add movements with traveling and arms.
-You're looking for something more aerobic or something which drills moves and/or breaks movements down and focuses on technique.
-You only want traditional music to practice to.
-You can't stand voice over
-You can't stand choreography or follow the leader practice

Overall I think this DVD is a great deal and a good practice companion for any dancer who has a grasp of basic technique (or isn't afraid of a challenge!)",1295308800,6,4284,4.576271186440678
3378858,4,B0015FJYV0,"First off, before I got this video, I knew completely nothing about belly dancing. And I am definitely a person who does not dance or has never followed a dancing choreography. When I put this in, I was glad to see there was a separate tutorial part aside from the actual workout part itself.
The tutorial part gives an idea of how the move is done but you can not see Neon's legs, as she has a long skirt on. Aside from that, though, she does tell you whether the unseen leg needs to be bent or not, but if you don't see it, it's hard to mimic. I think, like everyone else has said on here, it does a decent job of telling you what is happening next or is happening as there is also the pattern at the lower part of the screen but you have to pay close attention.
It is easy to get lost on here, especially on the workout part, which is really just the dance.
I still like it, though, and will continue to do it. I thought I was having a hard time just because I'm not a dancer, etc. but apparently, everyone is having that problem with this if they are beginners. I think, out of repetition, as with anything I could get the hang of this. I don't think I did such a bad job in the first two go arounds but adding arms is confusing!
I think this video is beautiful, the outfits are beautiful, music, etc. and does give you a good feeling by the end of the workout.
I would give this video a 5, but the beginners, I mean, super beginners, like me, probably should not purchase unless they have perserverance.",1294876800,4,1508,4.13265306122449

3378860,3,B0015FJYV0,"I have been bellydancing for almost ten years. From that perspective, this is a great addition to my video collection. It really breaks down the moves, but as many have stated, it is NOT for beginners. My main complaint is that the DVD refused to play on my machine. The company I bought it from was very gracious and sent me a replacement, which also had issues. Because it did play on my newly purchased laptop, I decided to just keep the replacement tape. However, and this is really weird,  there was a point in the tape where there was the strangest talking going on, almost like something out of The Exorcist. I'm hoping this was just a result of my aging DVD player. I am getting the heads cleaned and hope I never hear this again. However, since both my husband and I heard it, it was not just a product of my imagination,",1289865600,3,830,4.354838709677419
3378861,5,B0015FJYV0,"Beautiful dancers, beautiful costumes, beautiful music. As an advanced beginner, this gives me a good combination of things I can do and things that are still challenging. After the workout, they have step by step instructions to help you break down the moves, and there's a list of the music used so you can buy it yourself. There's a lot of material here, and you can watch it either with or without the voice cues. I think it's a worthwhile investment.",1282867200,,455,4.62962962962963
3378862,3,B0015FJYV0,"The dancers are beautiful.  The costumes are beautiful.  The instruction sucks.  This is NOT a video for complete beginners, like myself.  I found myself extremely frustrated by the speed of the instructions and the rapid movement from step to step.

The instructors are all wearing long skirts and you cannot see the knee and leg movements they are pointing out to you.  It is difficult to copy a movement that you cannot see.

Do not buy this video until you have a firm foundation in bellydance. I'm sure its great for intermediates or advanced.",1282694400,7,548,4.76595744680851

I  found Neon's instruction in the 'step-by-step' section very helpful. This section is great for thoes who do not have any background. For thoes who have background, the section makes a great check and drill. No matter your size, this workout really works out most of the target areas. I think Luscious is a nice but challengin work out for beginners. I am pushing into my one year in belly dancing, and i found this video informative, creative and simply divine. the music is perfect for each section. I never got bored with this workout because of how each dancer lead the section and the different costumes. My arms and thighs alone burned with satisfaction.",1280448000,,775,4.733333333333333

This is not for beginners--you can't see their feet, they go to fast and they get caught up in their performance that they forget it is supposed to be for beginners. Don't waste your money-- Rania has some better DVD's out there that are really great for beginners.

I did break a sweat but it was because I was trying so hard to keep up and I still was confused and lost. I never knew if my feet were positioned right or not because I could not see their feet. These people should give people who bought this DVD back their money because they misrepresented--it is not for beginners! It is for the advanced--probably those who took their classes.",1279756800,17,857,5.635658914728682
3378865,1,B0015FJYV0,"I have watched/attempted the Shimmy series on FITv for a while, and wanted a DVD so I could learn more. After some research, I found the Luscious workout for beginners. I just tried this DVD a few minutes ago and I'm probably going to end up selling it on Amazon or eBay.

I have done step classes and aerobic classes before - so I am used to cues and general choreography, so I figured I could do this DVD with a bit of ease. Yeah. NO.

Let me start off saying I DID DO THE TUTORIAL section, and even then I was lost. This is ****NOT**** for beginners. I didn't expect to get all the moves on the first try, but when I'm still stuck on the first move because I can't see her legs (wearing long skirts) and her explanations are confusing - you realize it's not going to be a good workout. I need to SEE her legs/knees doing the dance! So you're confused and they move fast, then as if her one explanation would do the trick, they add arms to the move, so now it's REALLY confusing! Then in a mocking way, they show the steps all together with the dancers. Am I supposed to follow that? I just stood there and watched. Wow.

I'm very very disappointed in this DVD. I thought it would be at least the same as the FITv one, there wasn't even a warm up. I'm unsure if I'm going to try this out again, my frustration level is quite high, I think they should've broken this DVD up into a set, it's just way too much, too quick and for a true beginner.

Like I said, I did not expect to get it right away, but when I'm on tutorial one and not getting the moves right, it leaves little motivation to continue on. I figure IF I do this DVD again, I am going to have to master the tutorial, entirely, in steps, then try to move onto the workout. I'm not sure if I want to put that much time into this, when I can pop in a different exercise DVD and work up a sweat. This seemed fun, but after doing it, I wasn't having fun with it - isn't that was exercise is all about?

Unless you've done shimmy/belly dancing before, I would NOT recommend this DVD.",1274140800,26,2041,4.079800498753118
3378866,4,B0015FJYV0,"If you start the dvd from the beginning, it starts with circles, and can be too fast paced.  I tried it once and put it away for nearly a year.  Then I took it out again, and realized you have to deliberately start with the tutorial, and I highly recommend it.  It takes you step by step through the movements, and the video can be too hard to follow without it.",1267920000,7,362,4.070422535211268
3378867,5,B0015FJYV0,"I have just started learning how to belly dance but have been looking and watching numerous videos for years before I got up the nerve to now try to do it(a 100 lbs lighter!). I have seen lots and I have to say, I just absolutely LOVE this video!! I was at first kinda turned off by the title of the video but I decided, what the heck? Give it a chance. From the first move, I was hooked! I love how Neon would do the move and then all three ladies would do the moves together to music; they danced together so effortlessly, it was beautiful to watch. The other thing was, I loved how she patiently and thoroughly explained how to do the move precisely and how not to do it so you hurt yourself. Neon really makes a struggling beginner, like me, feel like you really could do it with her kind instruction and gentle accented voice. The music, the costumes, the backdrop of the video, was exquisite and sensual! It is also great that its not one of those so-called 30 minute teaching videos that you pay an arm and a leg for and you wonder what for? and be disappointed at the amount of time they spend on technique and how they gloss over a lot to fit it into 30 minutes. I disagree, however, with people who say that this video is not for absolute beginners. It will be hard and you may stuggle for a minute but if it is too hard, go to the beginning and do tht tutorial and learn the basic moves. You can do that for a while until you can do the other beginning moves and you should be fine. If you buy this DVD, you will NOT be disappointed! The moves are authentic, the music is good and you will be learning while having a great time and getting in shape! I will definitely be buying the rest of their series!",1267660800,6,1714,4.134730538922156

3378869,5,B0015FJYV0,"I had been looking for a real Belly Dance workout, that was both good practice, AND a real workout. So many DVDs are called Belly Dance workouts, and I have found them disappointing. Usually they are not a very good workout, and aren't really belly dance oriented. There ARE a lot of good instructional Belly Dance DVDs out there. But I was really looking for something that would be about a 40+ minute workout, covering most of the techniques a beginner/intermediate needs to work on. A DVD that would not require that I have the remote in hand, hunting and pecking for this or that move in some ginormous table of contents, or fast forwarding past the repeated 20 minute discussion of ""tuck your hips, chest out, shoulders back"". Finding this DVD was like finding a jewel.

This DVD is called a belly dance work out for beginners, but I will agree with another reviewer who said that it was not for rank beginners. I would say it's more for ""advanced beginners"". That said, most beginners will be able to follow most of the moves, even the first time they see it. There is a tutorial section that is broken down pretty well, and should help those who may find themselves overwhelmed, or unfamiliar with the name of a specific move (for instance, what Neon calls ""infinity loops"", my teacher calls ""figure eights"".)

If you have been taking lessons, even if it's just a couple of months, you won't have too many surprises in terms of the basic techniques. However, you MAY find some familiar techniques put together in suprisingly different, but still lovely combinations.

While I am not winded nor sweating by the end of this workout, I do feel like I am working all the joints and muscles commonly used in belly dance (class.)",1263686400,5,1730,4.647058823529412
3378870,5,B0015FJYV0,"I was pretty turned off by the 'beginner' aspect of the title, so I hesitated to purchase this DVD. After completing the workout I was really happy I did buy it.

First off, it is probably too much for absolute beginners, if you have a few class sessions under your hip scarf or have worked extensively with other DVD's you should be fine. The 'combination's' are pretty short, most only being 2 or 3 moves. Some of the names they use threw me off at first but it's all basic stuff. All of the sections are narrated by voice-over (I love listening to Neon & Blanca with their accents, but that's just me) so the voice volume is constant and you don't hear heavy breathing. There are a few lunges and deep level changes but they can easily be modified or ignored.

I really liked the contrast between the 3 dancers, and I like that its not ""4 this, 4 that"" start over. It really feels like dancing. I liked the costumes, it gave the video more interest. I could have done with out some of the cheesy empowerment shenanigans but they weren't over powering.

The first section is CIRCLES (7:31), led by Blanca. The moves covered are hip circles, 1 hip circles, pelvic circles (interior hip circles) and chest circles. There are 3 combination's in this section. The skeleton is pretty basic but they add nice arm flows (often a major issues for beginner dancers) that get you used to moving your whole body (aka actually dancing). This section is pretty relaxed and I liked the soft stretching from the large circles. Keep your abs engaged to really feel the workout.

The next section is INFINITY LOOPS (6:44)  aka Figure 8's, with Neon. The moves are horizontal 8's, chest figure 8's,  vertical figure 8's up and down (I do the down section with my feet flat, better workout  and better for the ankles) with some variations and 1 hip figure 8's. There are 8 combination's. This section moves pretty fast, typically with Neon there are a lot of quick changes; I found that they aren't always announced with enough warning. In this section you can really see the differences in the 3 dancers, I find Neon's dancing to be somewhat jarring, and I think her movements often look jerky.

The next section is UNDULATIONS (7:02) with Sarah Skinner. The moves are snake arms, side undulations (I really like how this move is broken down), up and down undulations with variations, there are 3 combination's. I think Sarah Skinner does the best job of telling you what is going to happen before it happens.

Next is HIP ACCENTS (7:57) with Neon. The moves are vertical (weighted lifts/drops) and horizontal hip slides, unweighted lifts and drops with variations, there are 8 combination's.

Next is SHIMMIES (5:43) with Sarah. She covers basic hip shimmy and twist shimmy and shoulder shimmy. There are 4 combination's.

Next is BODY LINE (5:08) with Blanca, there are a lot of sways, flourishes and accents. She also does torso drops, back arches, pivot and three step turns and arabesque. There are 6 combination's. I thought this was actually the hardest section to do while still looking `pretty'.

Last is the dance, which I honestly haven't done. Once I get the hand of the combination's a bit better I probably will. I also haven't used the tutorial sections, I didn't find that I needed them. Over all as an intermediate/advanced student I found that this was a fun work out that helped me focus in on some moves that I would like to polish and it was interesting enough that I'll do it again. I would really recommend it to anyone with at least a basic understanding of belly dance fundamentals.",1262822400,6,3591,4.655608214849921

Until I can find a good belly dancing class/teacher where I live, I'll be following a DVD.  I definitely recommend this DVD.",1261267200,2,413,4.324675324675325

If someone is needing more instruction on technique, a tutorial section is offered. Immediately following each movement in the tutorial is a clip from the workout section that includes that specific movement. Also, the workout can be played without voice cues. I recommend getting used to doing the workout with cues, first. Excellent music choices to accompany each section of the workout. The workout includes six sections & finishes with a dance that involves many of the learned moves. The movements are strong enough to get my heart pumping after only two sections - yet they are moderate enough so that a person can do the entire workout.

3378876,5,B0015FJYV0,"This is another great DVD from WDNY  However, I would not recommend it for any Beginner Student, as I think it is more for someone at Intermediate or Advance level.  One the positive side -- I love the dance movements, the way the movements are grouped, the costumes, lighting, etc.

But on the negative side, the directions (left and right) threw me off.  I guess I am used to ""mirroring"" the dance instructor -- whether on a DVD or at a dance workshop; without using an actual mirror.  When I teach my dance classes, I use a mirror -- so when I call out left or right, it is actually left or right.

Another thing that irritated me on this DVD (and many others) is having any type of ""Welcome"" speech.  Welcome speeches and Introductions should be placed on the video, as an optional chapter feature.  You only need to hear it just ONE time!  I time my workouts and it is irritating to have to fast forward through the Welcome or Introduction each time I use a DVD.  The welcome/introductions are so inconvenient.  I find myself shouting at the TV, just shut up and get to the dancing!!!

I teach beginner students, but won't recommend this one to them (yet); but will recommend it to my more advanced or intermediate students.",1252713600,,1229,4.486486486486487

3378878,5,B0015FJYV0,Wow!  This workout/instructional video is worth every penny and more.  It is fun and fast.  I love how it breaks the moves down into categories that focus on certain areas.  Also loved the atmosphere of the instruction.  The addition of facts about the connection of the belly dance moves to different energies was a great way to incroperate the spirit-body connection in bellydance.  This IS NOT for beginners. The moves are not taught enough so that the beginner can proform at the pace of the DVD.  It goes pretty quick through each of the combinations.

3378882,3,B0015FJYV0,"I agree with the reviewer who indicated the clothing/costume can make it difficult to see how to do the moves. With a basic understanding of bellydancing, or by doing the tutorials, you can learn the moves that are in this video (although it would be easier with a different costume choice on the part of the instructor). The instruction isn't great, but you can get an idea. However, the main problem I had with this video is the lack of cuing. There are move changes and direction changes with little to no cuing. It's difficult to follow, so I mainly just use the tutorials for practicing the basic moves. There are much better videos out there, so if you're a true beginner, spend your money on something else.",1243555200,35,714,4.5859375

But I would like to say, this is a great DVD to practice with, especially if you are a beginner bellydancer. The routines give ideas of how to put all the basic movements you have learned together. Plus, it's really fun and has a ""no pressure"" approach. You can gradually build the combination sections at your own pace. If you need a review of the movements, you can refer back to ""the step by step"" sections.

The instructional section really breaks down each move to ensure the viewer understands the dynamics behind each belly dance step. I am completely a beginner.

In addition to the great choreography, this dvd works up a sweat. Not as much as Zumba (my favorite workout) but you still get a decent workout.

Everything is explained in minute detail. The one thing I would like to see is a longer period spent practicing each individual move - an additional minute or so. This can be achieved by rewinding with the remote, but that is a bit inconvenient. My muscles are slow to adapt to new moves, and as a non-dancer beginner I could use  more time getting comfortable.

One thing I would advise buyers is that if you have little to no experience in dance, this is NOT a workout dvd. It will not replace a cardio workout.",1237766400,5,670,4.395161290322581

If this is you are just learning belly dance, definitely go through the entire tutorial first, this will teach you the moves used in the dance routine. Keep in mind that you will not ""get them"" right away, you'll need to practice a few times in order to master it.

The video helps with first learning the actual movements, and then the transion into the next movement.

Of course it doesnt show you all you can do with every combo, but you can get a good idea of how to transition and create new combos.

Blanca teaches you about your body line, which is very improtant for belly dancers. you want to look graceful and you want the movements to be effortless.

Its great for beginners and intermediate. It helps you brush up on your skills, transitions and may teach you something new as well.

I'm in my 50s and found it hard to bellydance in the beginning because my body wasn't use to the moves.  I have been using DVDs at home for a year and now I find a lot of joints that use to hurt, don't anymore.  I have lost weight and regained a great part of my balance back.  This is not just for the young, but also the young at heart.  I got a great report back from my last doctor visit.  Ladies, it's time to dance!!!!!!!

While the instruction aspect of the video may be for beginners, an intermediate dancer can turn on the music-only option and just dance.

I went through the tutorial for the first four days and got an excellent workout and figured out how to properly align my body in order to do the moves.  After doing that for about four days, I was ready to move on to the full workout.  I found it fun and challenging and wouldn't return it for anything.  In fact, I used this video as training before I did Rania's ""Cardio Shimmy"" (which I found disappointing as it was less belly dance and more rah-rah, cheerleader aerobics).  I would recommend this to anybody who wants to learn  a little about middle eastern dancing and get a good workout and fantastic hips in the process.

This DVD is awesome.  These three women are so gorgeous that at first I just wanted to sit and watch them dance.  But eventually I started practicing along with them.  At first I tried to just follow along from the beginning of the DVD, but I have found that it is better to go to the tutorial on each of the movements and learn the correct way of doing it before trying to follow along with the combinations.  This is an excellent dvd to learn bellydance with.",1231632000,4,635,4.3474576271186445
3378909,5,B0015FJYV0,"I bought this workout thinking that it would be something different to do to still workout on days when I didn't really feel like working out...  First time, started off with the 'workout with voice cues' thinking I could listen and watch and would be able to follow what they were doing.  A couple minutes in, realized that was a big mistake... the belly dancing moves were complicated and the voice cues were confusing since I didn't know the difference between a hip circle, a pelvic circle, etc... so I pulled the menu up and back-tracked to the Tutorial section.  If you haven't belly danced before, you'll want to start at the Tutorial!!  Much better :)
OK, so the tutorial is thorough and clearly explains/demonstrates each of the moves... provides the opportunity to practice them a few times, then follow along with a little combination series incorporating the move you've just learned with 1 or 2 of the moves earlier in the tutorial.  Once through the whole tutorial (day 1), I was able to go back and do the workout with the voiceovers (day 2 -- the tutorial is fairly long!), because now the little comments made sense!  Which is to say that I could follow their movements and at least knew what I was supposed to be doing, but probably not doing it completely right -- that will take a bit more practice!

The workout is a lot of fun and goes very quickly (it's not boring).  Would put intensity level at light to moderate, (light sweat, but not out of breath...)  Fun!",1231545600,13,1484,4.590909090909091

I have done some bellydance before so I was familiar with the moves and could catch on pretty quickly. You need some room to do everything, so a bigger living room would be good, and I like to have a mirror to watch myself and check my form.  It is very luscious and sensual, but not too overly sexualized. I would definitely recommend it.",1231286400,,460,4.464285714285714

3378914,4,B0015FJYV0,"This DVD is quite enjoyable...it is a great way for the belly dancer to refine his/her techniques and get a full dance workout. The content of the video seems to have more of an artistic approach, as opposed to just doing one drill after another. (Don't get me wrong, drills are great, but sometimes I get bored with them and I just want to dance!) The combos flow nicely together and the choice of music fits well in each section. The fact that it is put together to feel more like a dance performance than a workout makes the time go by faster!

Only a couple of things on the negative side.  I would not recommend this for a beginner belly dancer. This DVD is best suited for an experienced dancer; someone who has taken classes for awhile (perhaps at the advanced beginner or intermediate level) and understands the basic principles of belly dance technique and has a solid foundation. Videos are a great tool for practice but it is usually beneficial to get feedback from a teacher in person, especially when you are learning belly dance for the first time. That way you can avoid bad habits that could lead to injuries, such as a lowback strain from doing hip infinity loops.

The other negative thing, (and this is just my personal opinion), is that I would have preferred a cool down and stretch at the end of the workout.  But that is pretty minor since a person can easily stretch on their own without video guidance!

Overall a well thought out video...something I will be adding to my home practice for sure!",1228089600,4,1520,4.532846715328467
3378915,5,B0015FJYV0,"I love this workout. It moved a bit fast for me at first but when I decided to mix it up a bit by doing the tutorial section, I found I still got a great workout. I first started with bellydance 7 years ago but continue to learn and find the best methods in which I learn. Using the tutorial section where the move is taught then demonstrated by a clip of the workout it shows up in, I could get a nice little workout. When the 'practice' part of the tutorial plays it is with music only. I found that to be a great option for those who get overloaded with trying to listen to the voice over instructions while watching what the dancers are doing next. So, it's not just a great workout done in sections and as one big workout- but a great tool for the more advanced bellydance student in drilling transitions.",1227225600,2,810,4.198717948717949

3378919,4,B0015FJYV0,"I don't consider this video a beginners video. The pace is fast and hard to follow. The costumes look like performance costumes and hide the feet and knees. I'd say this is an intermediate video. That's why I give this 4 stars. Anyone who has an idea of how to do basic bellydance moves before this video can have a great experience.

Luscious is packed with more moves than I've ever seen in any other bellydance video. I think that Drills Drills Drills and this video make up a great combination. The dancing is beautiful and the costumes and music do inspire.

Luscious has tutorial sections where the moves are explained and then shown in the context of the movie. You can practice every section after the corresponding tutorial or you can dance through the sections from the beginning.

The sections are called:
Circles where you learn pelvic circles, hip circles, chest circles, and one hip circles, aka Moroccan hip circles.

Infinity loops which goes through vertical figure eights, chest figure eights, horizontal figure eights, one hip figure eights, and mayas.

Undulations which practice side undulations, reverse undulations
Hip lifts and drops
Shimmys
Ans a section called body line
Then there is a short section at the end called the dance where you combine a  few of the moves you learn in a fluid free feeling dance.",1224374400,3,1333,4.850220264317181

The workout leaves me really exausted, but very happy with my results. Their explanations are very good and the global quality of this product is fantastic. Especialy the visual one!

3378921,5,B0015FJYV0,"For the price, you get what amounts to a 'two-fer': an instructional video--sort of a short form of Neon's ""instant bellydancer"" series that lasts 50 minutes, and a 45 minute connected workout.  The instructional section has Neon's typical focus on proper posture and alignment as well as her wonderful way of conceptualizing the moves.  If you've never ever ever bellydanced before, this might require a few watchings to get the moves right, because she's a real stickler on form. It's that focus on form, though, that a) keeps you safe physically (no hyperextending or dangerous twisting) and b) works the deep muscles that show real control and grace.  It's worth it to learn how to dance with proper form!

If you already know a bit about dance, jump right into the workout.  There's plenty to keep even intermediate level dancers involved--incorporating arm movements, studying how they put together combinations, etc, so don't pass this one up as too basic. It's harder than the BellyTwins stuff! It may take you a time or two to get all the moves down yourself!

The production value, especially for bellydance videos, is high.  The dancers are easy to see and well lit, you can see their knees and feet and what they're doing to create the movement.  The music isn't too loud or too soft and there's no distracting background.

 This video showcases a series of moves and puts them together in short combinations of anything from two to five moves.  An advanced dancer could profit from this video studying how they put the combinations together--the interplay of soft and hard movements, upper and lower body movements, and transitions.

Bellydance has lately seemed to bifurcate into the camp that thinks dance should be hard and extreme and damaging on the body--if you're not doing aerial Turkish knee drops, you're a poseur--and the camp that thinks that bellydance is something all women of all ages should be able to do and do safely.  Neon is in this latter camp, but her moves, though safe on the joints, are not simplistic.  I've seen women struggle with the one-hip figure eight for a long time.  So there's complexity here, but a complexity you can achieve with practice.",1223596800,14,2191,4.883783783783784

I am pushing into my one year in belly dancing, and i found this video informative, creative and simply divine. the music is perfect for each section. I never got bored with this workout because of how each dancer lead the section and the different costumes. My arms and thighs alone burned with satisfaction.

I also found Neon's instruction in the 'step-by-step' section very helpful. This section is great for thoes who do not have any background. For thoes who have background, the section makes a great check and drill.

No matter your size, this workout really works out most of the target areas.",1223251200,,658,4.7631578947368425

3378924,4,B0015FJYV0,"The dancing is a lot of fun.  The only thing I don't like is that you can not see the positioning of the feet during the dances.  Other than that, I have been ""shimmying"" away.",1221782400,2,176,4.0
3378925,5,B0015FJYV0,"I love Neon's dance style:  no shimmies, lots of complicated hip movement; fast and very fluid; nothing that would make a dancer feel socially awkward in a club. However, she's too fast for some people, on some of her other DVDs.  (I was a professional Pilates instructor for five years--that doesn't mean I can dance.)

In this beautiful, inspiring series of bellydance moves (arms, circles, hips), the movements are done just slowly enough and repetitively enough that a beginner can do them the first or second time through.

The costuming is elaborate, detailed, and perfect for beginners to follow:  there is enough of a reflective surface on the hips and chest so that you are able to see the movements really well.  The hip belts have points on each side that make it a lot easier to see the hip movements. Even the skirts have slits so that when the dancers kick out a foot, you can see what the feet are doing.

I have a very short list of bellydance DVD's that are appropriate for true beginners:  this is on that list, and it's one of the best; it's inspiring, beautifully shot, and easy to follow.",1221696000,5,1109,4.593908629441624

 I am an an advanced belly dancer who performs and choreographs for other dancers, I  also come from a Middle Eastern family, so I am generally a hypercritical malcontent when it comes to Belly dance DVDs. However, this one is like nothing I have ever purchased before and yet it is everything I have ever wanted in a practice conditioning workout, but didn't know how to articulate. Not only do the beautiful dancers on the DVD lead you straight into the ""Goddess Zone"" but they also keep you there long enough to heal and nurture your body, soul and mind. If you concentrate and perform every movement as it is meant to be executed you will get more of a workout than you realize. It is only a few hours after you dance this out, will your body tell you what has happened. Your internal organs will glow, any physical injuries will start to self heal and your confidence and inner sensuality and joy will radiate from every pore. Forget ""exercise"", this ""workout"" will turn you back into the living work of art you have always been.",1221177600,23,1056,4.466321243523316
3378927,4,B0015FJYV0,"What I enjoyed most about this dvd was watching how each dancer interpreted the moves.  It's good to see the slight variations, how each dancer tailored each move to suit her body and style. Also, having the moves taught in such a non-stop, flowing manner helps with figuring out how to connect moves and create routines.

Here, you get a lot of information for the price, plus gorgeous costumes, and skilled, enthusiastic dancers.  Also quite nice, they give the names of the songs and the musicians in the credits.",1220832000,4,516,4.775280898876405

This is great for people who have taken some bellydance classes and want to be able to put moves together in a flowing fashion without the choppiness of trying to learn a choreography. It's exactly what I've been looking for and I like that there are transitions and combinations I haven't seen before. This is perfect for someone who just wants to dance, not drill moves, not learn a specific choreography and is looking for some new ways of putting moves together. The moves they use are beautiful and make you feel beautiful and serene while you practice them. I think it will add grace and elegance to your dance.

Lovely to watch, with costumes and staging. I like the onscreen directions, I like the option to play without voice-over, I like the breakdown section, I like that they swap over, I like that it moves at the right pace for me when I'm tired and stiff. The only small quibble is with Neon who can't seem to isolate her hips when shimmy'ing in some of the sections - but she doesn't lead those parts and she is beautiful to watch nevertheless. I think I would have to buy Blanca's sensual bellydance after watching her here, I think she is fantastic. Definitely worth the small price, which is only the cost of a lesson in any case!

The instructors execute each move exquisitely, showing their expertise and beauty. They are simply inspiring. Using combinations instead of drills, this feels more like a class and less like a workout. It is just so much fun.

I love it because it combines learning a new workout while also learning about an ephemeral art (dancing). The only drawback is that the workout is 45 minutes and I would prefer 20 minute ""mini workouts"" but that can be remedied nicely by simply stopping the DVD after 20 minutes because you learn a series of movements a la workshop.

I have some dance background, and I agree, it was challenging at first, but they teach how to do the moves correctly.  I think a more basic beginner DVD is a good idea, so you learn to protect your lower back.

I got pretty enthusiastic and eager, and was very sore, but now can follow right along.  I love this DVD!
