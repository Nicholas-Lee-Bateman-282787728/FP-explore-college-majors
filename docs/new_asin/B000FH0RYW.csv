2565359,1,B000FH0RYW,it took us about 4 sittings to get through the entire movie.  it is very slow and not alot happens until about 3/4 of the way through it.  a couple go to a party where a scientist tells them a story about driving people crazy then using them in a ritual.  then while the couple is playing tennis with the scientist who told them the story the girl gets pricked by a nail in her tennis racket.  all of a sudden the girl starts seeing things.  so is the girl really going crazy or are the people driving her crazy is the question...what is real and what is an illusion.  this is nothing new in cinema but the way it is done here is very boring and drawn out.  the music used to indicate a suspenseful moment was annoying and yea they needed music to indicate it or the viewer wouldn't have know it was suspenseful.  the acting was also lackluster.  the actors seemed bord with their roles and the main actress appeared wooden throughout most of the movie.,1317081600,3,953,4.279329608938547
2565360,4,B000FH0RYW,"This isn't a giallo in the traditional sense. Those looking for a movie like DEEP RED or WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE? will be disappointed.

What we have is a movie like Polanski's REPULSION. This is a movie about psychosis. I didn't think I was going to like this one because I generally enjoy the more straight-forward killer-with-a-razor type of Italian thriller. But this was really good. It's probably more of a 3.5 out of 5 instead of 4 but I think that one-starred review is uncalled for. Though THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK is not a classic, it's still creepy and unsettling.. especially the ending.

Recommended for Italian horror fans.

2565361,1,B000FH0RYW,"I am a huge giallo fan, and I love obscure horror films. That said, I really didn't like this one. It's beautifully shot and Mimsy Farmer is fine in the lead, but it just doesn't didn't hold my attention. The plot basically comes down to this. Mimsy Farmer is either crazy or there's a conspiracy against her by all of her friends and neighbors. She spends the entire film seeing bizarre things that she can't explain. Once you've figured this out, it's just a matter of waiting til the end to find out the truth, madness or conspiracy. I was sorely tempted to fast-forward several times, but I resisted the urge. In hindsight, I wish I hadn't.",1310860800,4,644,4.512820512820513
2565362,4,B000FH0RYW,"(1974 - Italian with English subtitles / optional dubbed English audio). Finally in a Region 1 / NTSC release, it's time to toss out the old wretched copies of this much-lauded and impossible to find gaillo, comfortably sit back and enjoy this classy retro-artifact by director/writer Francesco Barilli (who also penned 1972's 'Who Saw Her Die?').

Starring Mimsy Farmer ('4 Flies On Grey Velvet','Autopsy','More'), who portrays a chemist as well as a psychologically fragile main character who finds herself sinking slowly into a kaleidoscope of hallucinations and past nightmares - or are they?  Are these disturbing visions of her childhood with her mother just sediments of a past that are now being subconsciously re-evaluated, or do they conceal some dark machination of a trauma she once suffered and buried? The slow progression from successful scientist to a disturbed woman on the edge of insanity details the in-depth intricacies of the haunted mind, one that weaves fantasy, reality and memory into one seamless fabric. With a cast of interesting characters (especially Mario Scaccia, who stands out as the eccentric elderly next door neighbor) and threads of murder, black magic, blind psychics, flesh-eating, Alice in Wonderland and 'Rosemary's Baby' all tossed into a salad of sanguinary psychosis, all fans of gailli, cult and Eurohorror should stay well-entertained.

Unlike most gailli, there's no real sleaze involved (nudity, yes, that's a given in European films from the 70's, but it's there as part of the plot and not random titillation); this one's more of an arthouse/horror hybrid than most - the sets are gorgeous, the cinematography wondrous to behold, the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful, the director's eye is awash in artistry (Barilli was first a painter before becoming a writer and director) and the digital transfer of this RaroVideo release is absolutely glowing. Colors are rich and vibrant, contrasts are deep, and audio is crisp. (I hope they continue to release Euro-artifacts from their PAL vaults in NTSC for the rest of us to enjoy). Special features include the documentary 'Portrait in Black', the director's bio and filmography, and a small booklet.
4 solid stars for both the flick and the print we're treated to - take a whiff of 'The Perfume of the Lady in Black'.",1301270400,29,2317,5.206434316353888
2565363,4,B000FH0RYW,"This movie is a interesting horror flick with the excellent Mimsy
Farmer putting in a great performance.  Unlike many other horror movies from italy this one was shot in English.  And the movie was successful in the United States at the time.  It is a study of madness or is it?  Is the main character going mad or are the people all around her after her?
She killed her promiscious mother while a child and now it seems that the child she was is unleashed from her as well.  The movie looks fantastic and raro video which usually cleans up movies really well did a fantastic job here as the movie looks beautiful. Half the fun of watching movies that are older than the 80's, is seeing them shine with a remastered print. And this movie is awesome in it's colors.  It's a psychological horror movie with a big payoff.  We are lucky to get this  horror flick that looks so nice.  It's not a traditional giallo; it's more a 'rosemarys baby"" type of flick but if you take the time to watch the poor main characters increasing dive into insanity and evil ,then you will be well satisfied.  It is a crime though that so many great euro horror flicks have yet to be released on region one discs.  Especially this one that is well done and shot in english.",1227398400,6,1250,4.367965367965368
2565364,4,B000FH0RYW,"Works like a cross between three Polanski films:  ""Repulsion"", ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Tenant"" (lthough this was made prior to ""The Tenant"") with big dash of Italian flavor.

In short a medical researcher believes she is being stalked and menaced by creepy neighbors in her luxurious Italian residence.  Of course, no one believes her.  Is she mad or sane?  The ending is unforgettable and should satisfy gore hounds.  If you're a fan of giallos, Italian horror or just cult films, then this is for you!",1159228800,2,506,4.894117647058824

8122482,3,B000FH0RYW,"I was anticipating Director Francesco Barilli's 'THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK' aka 'IL PROFUMO DELLA SIGNORA IN NERO'-1974 with great relish because of all that has been written about it these past decades.  I was kinda disappointed.  The film is not a Giallo film at all but is masquerading as one.  What we have here is a woman slowly descending into madness due to a past tragedy which resembles Director Roman Polanski's 'REPULSION' -1966 but there are other elements a foot to prolong the films running time.  The film is beautifully acted by Mimsy Farmer who worked with the greats( Dario Argento - Lucio Fulci) and gorgeously photographed by Mario Masini.  The images are so beautiful that you can see Barillis future calling as a painter in each frame.  The film is graced with a memorable music score by Nicola Piovani which you just can't shake once you hear it.  The film introduces an is she or isn't she nuts theme through out but is mired by scenes of characters which have been peppered onto the viewer during the films middle and slowly building into more Polanski territory (ROSEMARY'S BABY-1967, to be exact) revealing an underground cult .  Barilli actually gives a nod to maestro Mario Bava by having a blond ghost child popping in to annoy Farmer's character when things get rough. Euro Fans may enjoy the surprise? ending but it didn't work for this viewer.  Raro Video presents the film in a beautiful 1.85 transfer from the original negative with eye popping colors making you appreciate the films gorgeous images.  Extras include a 35 minute interview with Director Barilli, and a biography and filmography on him as well.  The package comes with a small booklet on the film.  Not for everyone, the film deserves to be seen just for Farmer's performance alone but the sum of its parts doesn't warrant a whiff of its perfume.",1425686400,,1853,4.774294670846395
8122483,4,B000FH0RYW,"About The Movie:

The Perfume Of The Lady In Black is both surreal and pretty. I like how the character of Sylvia is the center of everything, as if all events flow through her, as if every character seems to exist through her, and every one seems somehow suspicious. So then why? Suspicious because I observe them to be, or because I'm seeing them through Sylvia? Yes, it's that kind of movie magic. The messed up childhood, watching her mother with that dusty sleazeball all the way to the apparent murder(s) Sylvia committed as a child and beyond. The execution here is spot on too; very nice atmosphere, some genuine eerieness and a few good shocks. Some may find the plot running a bit slow, but I think having the time to ""smell the perfume"" served me to appreciate the movie more.

The Perfume Of The Lady In Black is worth watching, and I think an occasional repeat viewing could be nice.

About The Release:

This is my first RaroVideo purchase and I'm very satisfied with the quality and features here. The picture and sound is very nice having been digitally restored and remastered and displays at 1.85:1 aspect ratio with audio at Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono. I watched with the English dubbing, but it can also be watched in Italian and with optional new English subtitles. The movie was directed by Francesco Barilli, who I've been unfamiliar with until watching this DVD. The video interview feature with Barilli runs over 20 minutes and is pretty interesting. There's also a Francesco Barilli Biography and Filmography on the disc and an informative paper insert inside the case. The only thing I'm wishing for here is a trailer or two.

...and of course the movie stars Mimsy Farmer, who drew me to watching it to begin with. The movie would be fine shown together with Four Flies On Grey Velvet for more of Mimsy, or even Polanski's The Tenant or Repulsion for more mind-bending.",1424649600,4,1893,4.6897590361445785
8122484,2,B000FH0RYW,"If you've ever listened to a small child try and tell a lengthy joke, then you're probably familiar with how needlessly complicated the joke becomes before dissolving into complete nonsense and an outrageous punchline.  ""The Perfume of the Lady in Black"" is just such an undertaking, a creative, convoluted joke that slaps the viewer over the head with a grotesquely miscalculated punchline that seems stolen from a Lucio Fulci movie.  First-time director, Francesco Barilli (a former painter), has an eye for detail and infuses ""Perfume"" with scenes of languid glamour and creeping menace; his visual style is well-served by this lovely Raro Video restoration (which accounts for one of the two stars I awarded to this film).

Actress Mimsy Farmer plays Sylvia, an alleged chemist who spends most of the film calling in sick to work.  Sylvia has violent secrets in her past that seem to be resurfacing in dreams and hallucinations.  Concurrently, literally everyone who Sylvia comes into contact with--friends, neighbors, lover, co-workers, the local taxidermist--seems to be harboring some shady secret of their own as they slink around the colorful sets, whispering together, nodding knowingly as they head for midnight assignations in some crumbling ruin.  Soon enough, Syvia is on the verge of full-fledged psychosis.  Or is she?  Do the wealthy voodoo experts know something they're not telling, or are they, too, part of Sylvia's madness.  By the time the movie arrives at its unlikely and gruesome finale, I'd stopped caring.  More a horror story than a giallo, ""Perfume"" ends on an incoherent note that offers no satisfaction; in fact, many viewers will either probably find themselves laughing (though not in a good way) at the filmmaker's audacity, or angrily simmering to see their patience so deliriously and contemptuously disregarded.

As an actress, Farmer often played vulnerable, neurotic beauties whose classy fragility belied a hidden physicality that unexpectedly surfaced in scenes of surprising carnality and violence.  Blonde and ethereal, Farmer carries the film (as much as she can) with a convincing aura of tortured intellect, sadness and impending doom.  The film gets another star for her performance.  Unfortunately, her co-stars don't help her out much.  Mario Scaccia, as an eccentric, initially helpful neighbor, looks more like a mad scientist than Farmer, who is, literally, the mad scientist of the story, and Mauricio Bonuglia, as Farmer's lover, seems to struggle with a character that is poorly conceived.  The ghostly little girl played by Daniela Barnes, is also ill-conceived, given the direction that the movie takes.  The rest of the cast, although they appear and re-appear, like phantoms, throughout the film, are more memorable as a whole, than for any single character anyone plays.

Visually, ""The Perfume of the Lady in Black"" is a strikingly stylish example of a particular period in Italian filmmaking.  Unfortunately, the lesser elements of that same filmmaking style ruin what could have been a fine classic.",1387065600,3,3063,5.330561330561331
8122485,3,B000FH0RYW,"1974's ""Perfume of the Lady in Black"" (the version produced by RaroVideo) is the definitive version and cheap enough.  The director, Francesco Barilli said in an interview included with the extras that he was inspired by the success of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and with co-writer Massimo D'Avack, who with director Aldo Lado co-wrote 1972's ""Who Saw Her Die?"" a superior effort.  The music by Nicola Piovani is quite good, the cinematography by Mario Masini and editing by Enzo Micarelli are excellent and it is well complemented by RaroVideo's quality transfer and pressing.  But Barilli, who takes major credit for most of the plot ingredients,and however, stunning the ending, the traveling to this shock ending, adds little to make it seem ultimately gratuitous, and as a study of madness, explains nothing.  Mimsy Farmer is excellent, deserving of her fame in European cinema, as she is asked to carry the picture, which she nearly does, but the mystery surrounding her madness remains without any real language to the audience.  It is true the film never delivers as a true giallo, although there is some blatant working a cleaver by Ms. Farmer toward the end, but I must confer that it is a cult film.  Just don't expect to guess what the actual perfume is like.  Includes a booklet, filmography, biography and came be seen in both English and Italian with subtitles.",1362960000,2,1367,4.969298245614035

8122487,3,B000FH0RYW,"Similar to previous comments by some reviewers, this is a rather unusual film that mixes three styles in my view. The story revolts around a woman that begins to have flash backs from her very sad childhood, as his father (a sailor) was most time away from home, until she realizes her mother intimate with other men. In my opinion, this part takes place half of the movie is the best achieved in my view, with a nice style that some reviewers may fin slow. This part leads to more explicit hallucinations of herself as a child coming to see her in present time. Meanwhile, we have some sort of sect that is helping on this process to drive her mad. These two parts may be considered a sad with mystery film. Near the end, we see murders in pure Giallo style, and a quite unexpected ending, yet dumb for most I would say. To sum up, this is not a good movie when you assess it complete, with some good, some oks, and some very bad. Ten box is the most you should pay for it.

The movie comes with a widescreen format, with dubbed English audio, and English subtitles. It is a region free DVD (region 0) made by Raro Video. The packing comes with a brief booklet with some interesting notes on the historical context of Italian cinema. Extras include an interview with Director Francesco Barilli.",1353196800,,1295,4.418410041841004
8122488,3,B000FH0RYW,"Although most of the reviews for this film seem to rave about it, I can't be so positive. ""Perfume of a Lady in Black"" is dressed up as a giallo (the title alone is typical), but it doesn't seem to fit into that genre very comfortable. Basically the tale of a woman who is slowly going insane, the film echoes other films in several ways, so you could compare it to ""Rosemary's Baby"", as it features a woman in an apartment block with strange neighbours and a boyfriend who isn't much help, ""Images"", which features a similar case of the central character seeing phantoms and hallucinations, and ""The Haunting of Julia"", which also features a heroine tortured by guilt because of a past tragedy in her family. So with all these comparisons, I guess I was feeling that not much in this movie was original...the litle ghost blonde girl in a white party dress has REALLY been done to death.

I also found the film very fragmented, with scenes just cut together with no flow or sense of progression: you couldn't tell if a change of shot meant another view of the same action or the passing of time. Some of the imagery is very nice, and Mimsy Farmer looks good, but it was like watching a film that was all montage and no real progression.

The acting is also pretty lame. I've always found Mimsy Farmer a bit unfathomable, but she is the best actor here, it's the rest of them that let things down, Mimsy's boyfriend is terribly wooden, as are all the neighbours and supporting cast. Doesn't add any mystery when you don't know if behaviour is supposed to be weird or if it's just not been acted properly! The crappy dubbing doesn't help and as usual I could recognise the voices of the post production dubbing cast, as they seem to use the same people over and over again in any number of Italian movies from the 70s and 80s

What really confused me was the ending - after 90 minutes of spooky drifting mindplay, the film suddenly delivers 3 minutes of unexpected gore that seems to bear no relation to anything else in the film. I have to say I was pretty furious as I watched this final scene as I felt it was completely the wrong payoff for the attention I had paid to what proceeded it, and it leaves a whole host of unanswered questions.

I honestly would not say this was a rediscovered gem, although the picture quality is very good, and there were some nice shots, the end result is unsatisfying.",1338508800,8,2403,4.454545454545454
8122489,3,B000FH0RYW,"As a Gaillo Fan what can I say... its from the 70's and nothing special, you can now watch this one on netflix streaming.  I wasn't crazy about the story but its a good add to my collection.",1318550400,,190,4.0
