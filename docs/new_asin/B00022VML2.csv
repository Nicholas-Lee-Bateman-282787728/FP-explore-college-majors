8020962,4,B00022VML2,"`Comandante' is a compelling and fascinating interview with Castro filmed in 2002. It looks at a variety of topics from the revolution, bay of pigs, Che Guevara, modern Cuba and way more besides. Castro comes across as extremely charismatic and candid and although you have to be aware of the bias in any interview of this type, this doesn't feel especially like a PR exercise or publicity stunt. Oliver Stone is a poor interviewer and his questioning could have been more concise to get a more coherent narrative from Castro and taking this into account this interview is all the more interesting. Once you get used to the subtitles and translations tripping over each other this quickly become compelling viewing and 90 minutes goes by in the blink of an eye. It is fascinating to see Castro when he meets the public, they obviously seem to adore him and you don't feel as if this is staged either. It is also great to see historical footage inter-cut with the interview and footage of modern day Havana as well. All in all, this is a intriguing, fascinating and extremely watchable interview with one of the most important world leaders from the last 50 years. Well worth a look.

8020963,5,B00022VML2,"This is a great documentary with very effective editing and stirring music. We see Fidel Castro and Oliver Stone visiting a medical school where even American students can go for free, having lunches together, walking around and talking about everything, from Viagra to philosophy. There are also many revealing scenes of the island and historical clips. The fact that this documentary was banned from theaters and TV is more evidence that the United States is not as free as many people would like to think. Get a region-free DVD player and then buy this documentary.",1252627200,6,568,4.989473684210527
8020964,5,B00022VML2,"""The truth shall set you free."" What Cuban exiles call the golden age of Cuba, the gangster-prostitution houses' era, ended with the Barbudos marching in. The film by Stone allows Americans to see why the world does not share the poison tip opinions of the Cuban exile community. Americans have a right to see that it is poverty caused by an illegal U.S. blockade which forces people in Cuba, like those of Central America and Haiti, to take the perilous trip to the north. Sad that censorship is the only thing Cuban exiles can contribute to the United States.",1223596800,7,561,4.6767676767676765
8020965,5,B00022VML2,"Oliver Stone took a huge risk in making this movie and I am glad that he did. Great art that stands the test of time and makes a significant impact on contemporary discussion is art that takes risk. ""Comandante"" does just that.

""Comandante"" is a series of interviews between Oliver Stone and Fidel Castro in Havana. Stone guides the conversation diligently as they change locations from the Palace of the Revolution to Old Havana to the School of the Americas and the Contemporary Museum of Cuba. Throughout the conversations the viewers are allowed to see a side of Fidel Castro that we are not allowed to see due to political bullying from the Cuban exile group in Miami. After all, it is harder to villify and hate someone once you see that they have a human side. In this film Fidel makes jokes, engages in friendly verbal repartee with Stone and offers candid insight into what he was thinking during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. Fidel also has a bust of Abraham Lincoln in his office. He is a great admirer of Lincoln. How many Americans know that?

How many Americans really know Cuban history beyond what is emanating from Miami? Seeing this film is a good start to get a better idea of what preceded the Cuban Revolution. There are even images of Fulgencio Batista, the overthrown dictator, present in the movie.

In some documentaries, the conversations are contrived, but here they are open and flow quite easily. I must say that the translater does an excellent job in facilitating the conversation.

The music is excellent as well and you will find yourself tapping your foot as you watch the movie.

I have been in Cuba four times and watching this movie brought back wonderful memories of Havana and the people who live there.

With any historical figure there are two sides to the story. So far the American people have been allowed only to see one side. This movie does an excellent job of showing the other side. There is no America bashing; on the contrary, Fidel applauds the American people and emphasizes the American government OF THE PEOPLE--a sentiment that seems to have been lost over the last few years.

I encourage everyone to look for this movie, the search is worth the effort. Oliver Stone and Fidel Castro tell a story that must be heard.

It is interesting to note that Fidel Castro is painted as a dictator for not allowing open communication or dialog. Yet he is quite open and frank in this movie and the American government has made it almost impossible to see this movie. I wonder who is really following the steps of dictatorship here.",1188172800,13,2582,4.671806167400881
8020966,4,B00022VML2,"An excellent, fascinating film but also flawed. Whatever you think about Fidel this film shows you how incredibly intelligent, charming and personable the man is. The documentary is immensely interesting due its format. There is Fidel talking about everything from major world issues to viagra, there is the reaction of the people when he goes on walkabouts around Havana, there are the inter-cuts of archive film relating to the issues he is discussing and then there is great Latin American music binding it all together. Fidel talks a lot of sense about the environment and at times the hypocrisy of the United States. However the film is a missed opportunity because Stone does not tie down Fidel as he should have done over the dictatorship which Fidel manages. Its a real pity because I think Stone could have done so and have still maintained the atmosphere which allowed Fidel to be as honest and relaxed as he was. Just when you wanted another more probing question to be asked, Stone moves onto something else. I have been to Cuba and I have met people who have said to me that there is no freedom in the country and this view was not put forward strongly enough in the film. Also I can see why many Cuban exiles would get pissed off with the overly chummy farewells at the end of the credits. However, despite these criticisms, it is still one of the best documentaries I have seen in years. Shame on America for effectively banning it.",1183420800,3,1447,4.65625
8020967,5,B00022VML2,"One of the saddest, most recent examples of fascism in the American media is the suppression of Oliver Stone's ""Comandante."" This is an extremely important film, a powerful document of one of the most famous of all world leaders. The fact that HBO allowed itself to be bullied by the radical wing of the Cuban exiles in Miami says much of the poor state of the ""free"" media services in this country. ""Comandante"" is a stunning achievement, Stone has managed to make a movie that is able to probe into Fidel Castro THE MAN, it is not just a film for Cuba buffs, Castro and Che Guevara fans, it is a universal film where men discuss philosophy, social ideas, personal thoughts, desires, hopes, fears and dreams, and yes, it is also a powerful film about history and the history of Latin American and world politics from the last 50 years. Stone is a true filmmaker here, he does not sit down to do a 60 Minutes interview, he is a filmmaker who has journeyed to Cuba to TALK with Fidel Castro, to talk about the things most interviews shy away from. In modern journalism many studies simply discard the human side of history and concern themselves with basic, repetitive questions, here Stone and Castro discuss deep, sometimes personal issues, which at the end of the day connect back to the Cuban Revolution, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the embargo, the friendship with and assassination of Che Guevara, Castro's tussles with figures like Nixon, Reagan, Kennedy and Bush. The movie has an exhilarating feel with the photography of Rodrigo Prieto (Amores Perros, 21 Grams) and the hyper editing which intercuts brilliant historical footage with the documentary segments and Alberto Iglesias' score. Stone takes us through Cuba, with the island's rich music as a lush background as we see hospitals, neighborhoods, meet students and explore realities of the Cuban Revolution such as an increase in education and the basic obliteration of harsh racism within the society. Most rabid Castro haters, having grown-up with pure American propaganda, will surely trash Stone's friendly, open attitude with the revolutionary leader, but Stone does make honest questions about homophoebia within the Cuban system, Castro's secret police, the question of free elections etc. To which Castro answers honestly and plainly. The truth is many of us here on this side of the world rarely ever bother to learn about the history of other countries, Castro, like Hugo Chavez, has suffered much in public perception due to basic American ignorance. Like the best filmmakers, Stone has taken a chance here and has come out with an important document which should be watched by history students everywhere. But, like ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,"" the brilliant in-depth study on the American-backed but failed coup against Chavez, this film has essentially been banned from American airwaves. Oh sure, you can find the Region 2 import, but the United States deserves to see this movie, it is a shame that factions loyal to Bush and radical conservatism are now choosing what the public can and cannot watch (isn't this what they accuse Castro of doing?). ""Comandante"" is a brilliant documentary, it deserves to be seen, and hopefully one day it will receieve the kind of recognition it deserves.",1156809600,40,3279,4.996343692870201
8020968,1,B00022VML2,"Yeah Castro is great.  He turned one of the best economies and highest standards of living into the worst.  People each day risk their lives on the shoddiest of crafts to try to reach freedom.  They know their odds are virtually nil but they now that even a few hours of desperate freedom on the sea is better than living one more day under this despotic regime.  The only people heading back to CUBa are little children torn from the arms of their families by Janet Reno and Bill Clinton's stormtroopers.  Hey Janet why don't you live there for a day, off the guided tour of course.

Of course Castro is a great guy.  That is if you get the guided tour and swallow everything his propoganda machines produce for you.  That is apparently what Stone did in tribute to Communism, Castro, and corruption.

ADMIRERS OF CUBA: WHY ARE PEOPLE FLEEING THIS OCEAN PARADISE FOR A NEAR CERTAIN DEATH? THEY LIVE UNDER THIS TYRANT'S RULE.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH PERFUME YOU DUMP ON A PILE OF MANURE IT WILL STILL REAK OF ****.  YOU CANNOT POLISH A TURD NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.  CASTRO'S DEATH WILL BE CUBA'S LIBERATION DAY.",1148256000,11,1111,4.472636815920398
8020969,5,B00022VML2,"Possibly one of the most subversive films of recent years, Stone's interview all but blows the US propaganda image of Castro and Cuba out of the water. Castro emerges as a thoughtful, intelligent leader and, in several telling sequences depicting impromptu strolls through the streets of Havana, one that is regarded with more than a little respect and affection by Cubans. An encouraging 'must see' for those who have even a modicum of doubt concerning Castro's more vociferous critics.",1135468800,32,487,5.177215189873418
