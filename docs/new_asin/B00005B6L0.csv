1420957,5,B00005B6L0,This was by far one of the best movies that came out this year. To refer to the above comment: The movie really isn't supposed to be that scary. It's a drama. You can throw in some comedy in there too.  John Malkovich was awesome. You can't deny that he is one of the most underrated actors around. And Willem Defoe rocks. Must see movie if(Big If) it comes to a city near you. THe most surprising thing about this movie is that Nicholas Cage produced it. Never would have thought that this good of a movie would have Cage's name linked to it.,979689600,,543,4.221153846153846
1420958,2,B00005B6L0,"I was told that Shadow Of The Vampire is a much better movie than most productions of its genre. The starring of charcacter actor John Malkovich propped up this expectation, and so did the fact that it's filmed in my country of residence, Luxembourg.
But no. There are only two good things about this movie! The acting is very very good, and the plot is much more original than in ordinary vampire stuff.
And that's all! The movie itself is not at all exciting. Not catching, in no way scary, and not very well-written either.
A disappointment - avoid it.",976060800,3,555,4.56

I was very skeptical when buying this movie. What intrigued me the most is the title of the movie.

1420996,1,B00005B6L0,"""Shadow of the Vampire"" is a dreadful film.  Referred to as a ""metafiction comedy,"" its raison d'etre is apparently to mock a cinematic masterpiece of Expressionism, F.W. Murnau's ""Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens"" (1922), which Werner Herzog has called the greatest of German films.

As with Tim Burton's version of ""Dark Shadows,"" this film was a platform from which today's cinematic mediocrities could express their cynicism toward the past.  Willem Dafoe particularly gives a very bad performance, playing Max Schreck for laughs; only Cary Elwes survives with his dignity intact.

Rather than wasting one's time with this lifeless travesty, one is directed to Murnau's incomparable silent original.  Herzog's stylistic remake, ""Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht"" (1979), is also extraordinary.",1476489600,,798,5.728813559322034

So going in I high reasonable, but also pretty high expectaions. What I got was....exactly what I thought I was getting. Which is to say: its was a good watch.

The concept was brilliant, but it execution was mildly successful.  The cast was excellent and it starts out as a promising story, but the end, well it was like, How do we end this movie?  The only plot hole in the whole film is, vampires cast no reflection in a mirror, so how do you film one?  I was disappointed.

There is a definite reason you cannot buy this film anywhere for under 30-40 bucks. Same reason Zeppelin and Beatles stuff are NEVER in dollar bins.  Because there are few films where you as the consumer has absolutely NOT choice but to pay for this product.  Dig deep in those pockets people because this film is worth every penny.

1421051,5,B00005B6L0,"Should be watched after seeing the original ""Nosferatu,"" that made it a lot easier to appreciate. Excellent acting. Cinematography set the mood well. It was relatively easy to see where the plot was going right up to the end which was something else again. Would definitely recommend this movie.",1415577600,,295,5.040816326530612
1421052,4,B00005B6L0,"For people like me, I suppose. This is a film that offers the myth of Murnau secretly filming Nosferatu with an actual vampire. It's pretty great as it remains committed to the myth throughout. It's like a great, modest, poker-faced production. John Malkovich is solid, and Willem Dafoe is marvelous as the vampire in question.

The only weakness may be the writing which perhaps falls victim to the very concept that it depends upon. The story skips forward at times when you wish it wouldn't. It's only ever mentioned that ""Max"" has been killing off crew members -we never get to see any of this action. Instead of showing us what's happening. The characters too often update the audience, bringing us up to speed. The result is that it feels somewhat rushed and incomplete. It's a sorry feeling -the film seems to promise more deliciousness than what it ultimately delivers.",1415404800,2,877,4.846666666666667

1421055,4,B00005B6L0,"This film SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE is set during 1921 Slovakia in Eastern Europe somewhere
set during the shooting of the film NOSFERATU (Vampire) Directed by German Director
F.W. MURNAU whoose real name was Friedrich Wilhem plumpe

SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE Directed by British Director Elias Merhige
makes his film about the filming of Nosferatu set in 1921 Slovakia
Brilliant performance by John Malkovich who plays F.W. MURNAU in the film
and Brilliant performance by Willem Dafoe who plays the Vampire character actor Max schreck
also starring German actor Udo kier who plays German Movie producer ALBIN GRAU
the film is mainly based around F.W. MURNAU'S obsession to shoot the film as real as possible
by actually getting a Vampire to play the role of a vampire from Eastern Europe
and how the German director blackmails Actor Max schreck to complete his film
by offering the Actress's in the film as Victims for the Actor.
During the shooting of the film, one by one the film crew of Nosferatu are mysteriously missing
and the movies producer played by Udo kier blames the Director for this.
but F.W. MURNAU does give a Damn he is so obsessed with shooting the film
he'll do anything to complete it
i have no idea if that's true or not
or if some of the scenes from the film are based on fact or just made up for the movie sake
You can make your own conclusions

when NOSFERATU was released in cinemas Germany 1922
F.W. MURNAU got sued by Bram stoker's widow Florence stoker and she won the court case
which left F.W. MURNAU'S production company bankrupt
about 9 years later F.W. MURNAU Died aged 42 in car accident

this SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE film gives an interesting view of how Nosferatu was shot during filming
and what happened behind the scenes with Director F.W. MURNAU, Producer ALBIN GRAU & ACTOR MAX SCHRECK

the 2003 dvd from Lionsgate has the film in 1:85:1 widescreen format and has new special features
interview with Director Elias Merhige & interview with Actor Willem Dafoe
plus you also get Director's commentary and some behind the scenes footage
this film is yet to get a blu-ray release
so this dvd from Lionsgate will have to do
i gave it 4 stars.",1414713600,,2170,4.672774869109948

Filled with some good chills & great black comedy, ""Shadow of the Vampire,"" is not for everyone, but for those of you it is for, you'll know it, right off the bat!

William Dafoe plays ""Max Schreck,"" playing ""Count Orlock, in the filming of ""Nosferatu."" The rub here is, Dafoe is a vampire playing an actor, playing a Vampire, & things get a little out of hand as Dafoe starts feeding off the cast & crew, with a the zeal of a fat wiggly leech, swimming in a blood bank! Dafoe is obliviously having great fun with this role, & it is almost startling how he has re-created ""Count Orlock!""

""Shadow of the Vampire"" spouts, fine cinematography, sure handed direction, & it's casting is perfection. Of course, it's always fun to watch John Malkovick fly off the deep end as the misunderstood genius. A role he knows well.

A ghoulish delight that flew under everyone's radar, & another masterful performance from Dafoe, that shows why he is one of the best actors of his generation!",1336867200,,1011,4.569060773480663
1421084,4,B00005B6L0,"As Shadow of the Vampire begins, John Malkovich as director Friedrich Willhelm Murnau, quietly tells us how memories are no longer fated to fade. He is setting the frame for the story of the making of Nosferatu. Like any good frame, it establishes the context of the story without intruding into it.

  Today, we are so accustomed to change that it is impossible for us to appreciate the magnitude of change that motion pictures represented. These days, we expect the events and devices around us to be in flux; any software or device that hasn't updated within two years is considered hopelessly out of date and unable to catch up.

  At the advent of motion pictures, for who could see, this was the most fundamental change humanity had ever achieved. Man could now create new realities and capture and alter time itself. Those who recognized this change were driven by irresistible passions.

  Asking whether or not Max Schrek really was a vampire provides some comic situations and exchanges, and produces tensions that move the movie along. But was he really a vampire or not? That isn't the question Shadow of the Vampire answers. The answered question is: Would Friedrich Murnau have brought a real vampire into the picture if he'd had the opportunity?

  And the answer is an undeniably passionate: YES! This passion is so strong that, in a scene where Muranu has lost control of Schrek, he is able to regain it by ordering him back to his position with the declaration ""If it isn't in the frame, it doesn't exist.""

  Somewhat like a vampire, the movie Nosferatu has lived beyond the lifetime of those involved with it. The court that found Nosferatu to be in violation of the Dracula copyright ordered all copies be destroyed. But they are among us today.

  Motion pictures and vampires are a natural fit, near twins in their existence. They are created outside the normal forces of nature. They have a compelling appeal for us, and an existence that stretches beyond a person's lifetime. Neither is truly real, truly alive, but with a good movie like this, that doesn't seem to matter.",1335484800,3,2098,4.796657381615599

It went directly from a slow build into full swing, without the any resemblance of a good transition.

A note which gave both films their resonance in spite of any other shortcomings - elevating them into the realm of the near-philosophical.

But getting back to ""Shadow of the Vampire"" on its own, its a well-done picture technically with a clever script and good performances all around, most of all for William Dafoe as the creepy Nosferatu.  I wouldn't say the film is riveting but it moves along at a reasonable pace and picks up momentum as it goes along.  While it has creepy moments, the overall vibe of the film is one of spooky amusement, and understated comedic drama, rather than horror.  Which was fine by me.

1421095,4,B00005B6L0,"Count Orlok Bites!

Shadow of the Vampire is not a docu-drama of the original 1920s silent screen horror film, but takes well from that time.  Director F.W. Mirnau made an expressionist classic  and director E. Elias Merhige created quite the film to answer the question:  Was Mirnau's film great because the actor Schrek was really a vampire?

There are a few scenes that reflect on the obsessiveness of German directors, the pampering snobbery of actors and actresses, the rabid press wanting to know if this film is based on the Stoker novel Dracula (it kinda was, but I digress).

Mirnau pretends that Schrek is simply a method actor getting into his part, while he secretly feeds the vampire bottles of blood.

The filming techniques were pretty coolly demonstrated:  ""Iris in, and begin.""  The actors with their thick eye make-up, and the occasional drug use and fooling around off-stage made for some interesting scenes.

Willem DaFoe really steals the scenes -- I mean, the guy walks and talks as Max Schrek did or may have done during the actual Nosferatu.  There are also scenes where they took the actual film clips of Nosferatu and then cut DaFoe in them, and frankly you cannot tell the difference between actors, he's that good.

Horror and comedy plays the biggest role:  Schrek criticizes the original Stoker novel to the producer and writer as they share a bottle of schnapps under a full moon.  Schrek says the horror was really Count Dracula who had not eaten real food for centuries now trying to remember how to set a table.  The writer quips, ""Did we read the same book?""

Orlok grabs a bat mid-flight, sucks its blood and stalks off.

The producer exclaims, ""What an actor!  Dedication!""

As Mirnau's crew becomes a supermarket of bodies and blood, he begins to wonder if he has truly made a deal with the devil.

The film is a bit slow and pondering in parts and if you have not seen the original silent film, you may not get all that Shadow of a Vampire is showing.

The DVD has some comments by Willem DaFoe and the director as they discuss the film, and the whole production.  There's the usual commentary and languages.

Must see!

1421108,3,B00005B6L0,"I hate to be a suck-up, but I gotta admit that very often when I see a posting on a given film's Amazon page by in-house critic Jeff Shannon, I have to wonder if I'll have much else to add to the discussion.  What he--and several other reviewers--have observed about SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE is pretty much on target.  The movie would seem to have a lot going for it; its basic conceit is undeniably clever, the cast is just about perfect (in a po-mo stunt-casting kind of way), and the cinematography is all you could hope for, with letter perfect reduplications of scenes from F.W. Murnau's classic b&w NOSFERATU yielding to scenes of such vivid color and striking composition that the effect is actually jarring.

It's just too bad that the film is a one-joke affair.  Its 90 minutes seem just a hair too long.  Of course, few movies run much less than that--but you walk away from this one thinking that it well could have.

That one-joke, as most readers know by now (no SPOILER warning needed, I don't think) is that in this film, the actor assigned the part of Count Orlock, the vampire, really IS a vampire.  Everyone in the cast and crew believe that this unfamiliar actor ""Max Schreck"" (whose very name should have tipped these native German speakers off that SOMETHING was fishy--or batty) is just this great method actor.  It's a clever premise, high concept enough that you can see how it easily got green lighted by studio execs.  But developing the story is another matter.  Do you go broadly comic?  scary comic?  scary tragic?  The answer is, in this case, a little bit of everything.

And you just know that the question of just who's the real vampire will always be lurking below the surface.  F.W. Murnau, the ultimate obsessive artist figure, has literally made a pact with evil to achieve his vision of ""a symphony in horror.""  He is all too willing to put the lives of his caste and crew in jeopardy to achieve cinematic immortality.  We've seen this kind of character before, of course and are not surprised when the vampire character sneers, ""We're not so different, you and I.""

This movie was more about egos and film making than it was about Vampires.  Dafoe's character is downright comic.  Let me take that back, he's ATTEMPTING to be comic.  He's not funny.  The sad part is he isn't even scary.  Malkovich is unconvincing as Murnau playing the stereotypical egomanic director. The fake accents and bad ""recreations"" of scenes from original silent film really put me off.

If I worked in the film industry, I might have enjoyed this film.  As it was, I felt like it was a series of ""inside jokes"" and I was not an insider.

Dafoe is interesting, and Malkovich (as many many other reviewers have observed) seems simply to be playing the same stock Malkovich role, only with a vaguely European accent.

  So thus are recited the immortal lines of Tennyson as the old decaying Vampire laments the loss of his youth and power.  Shadow of the Vampire is a remake of the 1922 Film Nosferatu and is based in part upon the myth that in the original film the actor Max Schreck who played the role of the vampire was in fact a real vampire.  At one point, the legend of Max Schreck suggested that Nosferatu was the only film he ever made, however, when Nosferatu was filmed, Schreck was already working on the stage and screen.  Schreck would appear in many other roles before his death in 1936.

  For those of you who enjoy symbolism in film, Shadow of the Vampire will not disappoint.  It opens appropriately as the train appropriately named ""Charon"" transports the film's crew to Czechoslovakia where the movie will be made.  According to Greek myth, Charon was the ferryman who conveyed the souls of the dead across the river Styx.

  I found the Vampire's recitation of Alfred Tennyson's poem 'Tithonus' a nice touch in this offbeat Vampire film, and a nice correlation with the tragic greek legend.  Tithonus was a character in Greek Mythology who had bestowed upon him a defunct gift of immortality the problem being that his mother Aurora forgot to include a ""youthful appearance"" in her request to Jupiter so Tithonus, though now immortal,  continues growing older in appearance and gradually, slowly and painfully loses his all his powers.

  The underlying message of shadow of the Vampire is in its reflection on the question ""what is the essence of true evil?""  It challenges the viewer to reflect on the notion, ""can human insensitivity be worse than vampirism?""  The film's complexity makes you think and at times, has you asking yourself who is worse...the tragic old vampire or the obsessed director?

John Malkovich interprets the brilliant & legendary German film director Friedrich Wilhelm 'F.W.' Murnau who in his quest to affect realism in his movie recruits Max Schreck, supposedly a real vampire, to play the role of count Orlock knowing a few lives from his crew may be lost.

  At one point in the film while conversing with his unsuspecting fellow actors, Max, impoverished for a blood fix, snatches a bird desperately from the air, and sucks the life out of it in front of them.  They watch in astonishment as the old vampire feeds and admiringly comment to him afterwards on his commitment to the role of Count Orlock.

  Ultimately, I found Malkovich's performance good, consistent, and above average, though somewhat monotone.  William Dafoe is undeniably brilliant in the role of the Vampire and I have never enjoyed him more.  Over all I found Shadow of the Vampire a delightfully ""Mad"" piece of filmmaking.  The film's cinematography is excellent as is the cast.  It is also nice exercise in suspense and a great movie to watch with those who enjoy the genre.  As a student of film, I will treasure this classic for many years to come.",1157328000,6,3052,4.805769230769231

1421116,2,B00005B6L0,"Although probably a must-see for  fans of F.W. Murnau's 1922 classic `Nosferatu,' SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE is certainly capable of disappointing.  The premise is intriguing enough - what if the character who played the vampire, Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe) was a real-life (or unlife) vampire?  What if director Murnau (John Malkovich) knew this, and promised his star the movie's female lead Greta Schrder (Catherine McCormack) in exchange for acting in the film?

 There are a lot of ways to take it, I suppose, but the route taken by E. Elias Merhige disappointed me.  Dafoe, make-upped and dressed to look exactly like Schreck reminded me of a cross between Uncle Fester and the Green Goblin.  Anyway, the dread factor was zero, the film class questions (Merhige talks a lot about the `vampirism of film' on the commentary track) failed to intrigue, and rather than profound I found it all a little silly. By the end, where Merhige shows us the lengths to which Murnau will go to get it on film, had me throwing my hands up in disbelieving exasperation.

 I can't speak for vampire film fans - I'm not one - but as a non-fan I found SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE plodding and, like I said, a little silly.",1150502400,,1196,4.684210526315789
1421117,4,B00005B6L0,"SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE belongs to a curious subgenre of horror cinema: dramatized speculations on the inspirations of true-life horror artists.  THE SPECTRE OF EDGAR ALLAN POE told a wildly fictionalized account of splattery tragedies that would inform Poe's work.  GOTHIC similarly dramatized a night of debauchery suffered by Mary Shelley that would inspire her FRANKENSTEIN.  GODS AND MONSTERS fictionalized the final weeks of James Whale's retirement, still haunted by the personal demons informing BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN: World War One's trench warfare and Britain's class system.

Of the above films, GOD AND MONSTERS hews nearest historic facts, whereas SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE veers to the opposite extreme, tossing aside history in a brilliantly imaginative, revisionist retelling of the making of F.W. Murnau's classic vampire film, NOSFERATU (1922).

In NOSFERATU, German character actor Max Schreck played the vampire, Count Orlock.  So compelling was Schreck as Orlock, and so completely did he subsume himself in the roll, that his career was destroyed by subsequent typecasting.  (A common risk for actors, one that ended the career of Karen Lynn Gorney after SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER).  SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE posits that the reason for Schreck's compelling performance was that ... it was no performance.  Schreck was a vampire, and his ""makeup"" was his real face.

It's an intriguing idea, sublimely executed.  SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE opens with Murnau (played by John Malkovich), shooting his final scene in Germany, without Orlock.  No one on his set knows yet who will play Orlock.  Murnau informs them that he's found an obscure Method actor who's craft requires him to always be ""in character.""  Thus, this mystery actor (named Max Schreck, played by Willem Defoe), will always be in makeup, and will only shoot at night.

The film company travels to the location in Czechoslovakia, where all are impressed with Schreck's ""realism,"" even as they think he carries it too far.  Such as when he goes overboard in attacking his co-star, or drinking a bat's blood.  Murnau must control Schreck during the duration of the shoot, cajoling and bribing and threatening, at least until he has ""his shot"" and everything is ""in the can.""

John Malkovich's portrayal of Murnau is 90% perfect, but is hobbled to the extent that he plays a stereotype: the tyrannical, jackbooted, thick-accented German film director.  Neither Malkovich, nor Merhige, nor Katz, do enough to raise the film's Murnau above this stereotype.  One thing they might have done is lose the accents; since everyone in the film (except Orlock/Schreck) is German, there was no need for contrast.  All could have spoken standard American English.  But SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE does little to contravene Teuton stereotypes, and the result is that Malkovich's Murnau is nearly perfect, rather than perfect.

Malkovich's Murnau also overlaps with a related stereotype: the director as manipulative deceiver.  This broader (and not necessarily German) stereotype is similar to the first, but without the accent or pre-World War Two milieu.  It evokes Peter O'Toole's manipulative director in THE STUNT MAN, who lies and connives and blackmails to get his shots.  John Vernon in the Canadian slasher film CURTAINS also fits this category.

Willem Defoe offers the film's standout performance as the vampire Orlock/Schreck.  Dafoe's vampire is feral yet sympathetic, brutish yet poignant.  He pines over a photo of the film's leading lady (Greta, played by Catherine McCormack), implying a romantic heart; yet later pounces on her, slurping her blood as the animal he is.

Vampires are usually depicted as either alluring romantics or repulsive beasts.  To his great credit, Defoe successfully blends the two personas.  His Orlock simultaneously inspires both our revulsion and sympathy.  Defoe's Orlock compares favorably to Karloff's Frankenstein monster: both creatures are physically abhorrent, yet beneath their ugliness, we detect pain, self-loathing, and a desire for a nobler existence.  Orlock relates his descent from past worthiness, expressing his self-revulsion at what he has become.

Seeing Defoe in makeup and character, it's hard to believe he was Jesus in THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST -- the most ""human"" and multi-dimensional Jesus I've yet seen on film, the only cinematic Jesus one could relate to [until the brilliant THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST].  Defoe also portrayed a genteel and guilt-ridden T.S. Eliot in Tom & Viv, and a memorably chilling biker/sadist in STREETS OF FIRE (another of my personal favorite films).  Defoe's range is remarkable.

Great villains make for great horror films.  Villains that are morally ambiguous, who confound us by simultaneously evoking our sympathy (or at least, our empathy) and our disfavor.  Dafoe's Orlock is that, yet arguably Murnau is the real monster.  He has bribed Orlock with Greta, who Orlock may have once they finish their scenes.  It's unclear whether Murnau initially intends to sacrifice Greta for art's sake, but it's intimated the possibility was on Murnau's mind from the start.  Greta's life is certainly no priority.  Murnau would readily sacrifice his cast and crew, and betray Orlock, to get his precious shots.  Murnau continues filming his crew's deaths rather than intervene, much in the manner of war correspondents.

Indeed, Murnau's callousness might in part be explained by his living in a Europe still traumatized by World War One, aside for the fact that the war and its after-effects are curiously absent in SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE.  No hint of the war's human, financial, and political costs that burdened Germany in 1922.  This is no irrelevant omission.  Most film critics believe German expressionist cinema was influenced by the war.  [See David J. Skal's THE MONSTER SHOW.]

The standout scene is also Defoe's, and will likely be remembered as one of those classic scenes in cinema that everyone recalls.  (And proof of the poignant beauty of horror.)  Orlock had earlier told Murnau that what he desires most is to see the sun again.  After everyone has left the set, Orlock wanders to the film projector, gazes into the lens, and cranks the film.  He sees a shot of a ship sailing with the sun behind it.  Orlock is mesmerized, gazing into the lens, recalling all that he has lost, and how far he has fallen.

Willem Defoe deserves much credit, but credit is also due to director E. Elias Merhige, and screenwriter Steven Katz.  Reportedly, this was one of those scripts that had been shuttled about for years before someone actually filmed it.

The film's title seems arbitrary.  Orlock pines for the sun, and his lack of reflection in a mirror provides for a minor plot point, but there's nothing especially important about his shadow.  Perhaps ""shadow"" is intended as a metaphor?  The shadow of film's influence on the future?  (Murnau speaks of film memory.)  But if there's a metaphor to ""shadow,"" it's unclear, and apparently not crucial.  This film could just as easily have been called something else.

Udo Kier is likable as Murnau's producer, a contrast to Kier's sleazy Satanist in END OF DAYS.  Catherine McCormack's Greta is debauched, shrewish, and thinly sketched, so we don't much care if Orlock desanguinates her.

A historical note: the Bram Stoker estate successfully sued NOSFERATU's producers for infringing Dracula's copyright.  All prints were ordered destroyed, but NOSFERATU survived, so there's no excuse for a horror film fan not to have seen the original.  SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE is worth seeing in any event, but you may appreciate it more if you first see NOSFERATU and review its history.",1147737600,40,7676,5.199674001629992

1421119,5,B00005B6L0,"What if... just what IF vampires were real... and what if the Nosferatu star WAS a real vampire? Now that would have been interesting, and that's the director and screenplay writer's POINT in this film.

Now, after watching the film with the commentaries on, I see that a lof of the characters were played the way they slightly were in real life. Eddie Izzard as a 'bad actor' because, well that's what Gustav was - a hammy 20's actor! Eddie didn't even like all that makeup because he thought it wasn't that great, but that's how the makeup was in those days and in black and whites - it's hard to light for black and whites much less dress and make up people for those films. He grew to like it though, so he says. (Eddie Izzard is a straight transvestite, not a female impersonator on stage... read his bio and his official webpage... yes I'm a big fan, I know...)

 Greta really was apparently a love of the stage and was a prima donna, and FW Murneau loved his art in a very poetic way.

As for Ronan Vibert as Wolf Muller, whom was the destroyed photographer, I don't think he was a real person at all. Cary Elwes, as the replacement cameraman, if you notice on the real NOSTFERATU, had his name under cinematographer. But I so DID love Ronan's 'Wolf', and his acting was great along side Malkovich.

Willem DaFoe, in my humble opinion, was capivating, and fun to watch just to see the look on his face.

Udo as 'Albin' was great too, and fun to hear his accent.

Over all, it's all a bit of fun - it's just a movie about a 'what if' situation behind the scenes of a REAL movie... have fun with it and do NOT take it seriously. Just let yourself go into their world, and have fun.

After years of Wes Craven schlock like ""Scream"", and movies by other directors of the same ilk like, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" I was hoping that there would be a resurgence of intelligent horror films.  Shadow of the Vampire wasn't it.  Although F W Murneau gave the vampire shadows in the original Nosferatu, which in most legends they don't have, this ""tribute"" had the core conceit of making the vampire capable of being photographed.  So in other words not only did Orlock have shadows but also reflections.  The characterizations in this movie were poor and tissue thin, with John Malkovitch trying to channel Colin Clive in his portrayal of F W Murneau--like the director was a mad scientist. Catherine McCormack played a cliched prima donna as Greta Schroder, and worst of all was William DaFoe as the vampire.  His makeup was a hollow mockery of Max Schreck, and not nearly as effective as Reggie Nalder, who was made up in the same manner in ""Salem's Lot.""  I dubbed William DaFoe's appearance Bucky the Beaver.  The razor sharp fangs of Schreck had become for DaFoe buck teeth, and it looked like this was a vampire who got manicures, with no hanging edges anywhere on his long fingernails. DaFoe was well nigh incomprehensible with his dialogue, with some mystery accent that only Latka, on the TV show Taxi, could understand.  Eddie Izzard played Gustav von Wagenheim as if he was a Teutonic Ted Knight in the old Mary Tyler Moore show.  Although this character also showed a lack of depth, it was amusing, and one of the main reasons I went to see the movie.  I also went to see Udo Kier, Andy Warhol's Dracula.  I was especially pleased to see that one of the trains they rode in the movie had the name Persephone mounted on it, since that echoed the name of one of the sailing ships in Dracula, the Demeter.

I was flabbergasted, however, when William DaFoe's performance was nominated for an Oscar, and was glad when he lost.",1123804800,,1996,4.652421652421652

Anyhow, the concept of the movie is really great.  A crazy director want to make the ultimate realistic vampire film... and does so by having a real vampire play an actor playing the vampire; in return for the right to eat the lead actress after filming is over.

The movie itself is well done, but sometimes feels a little bogged down.  The cast is strong however, and its easy to let such problems slide.",1121558400,3,537,4.552083333333333
1421123,5,B00005B6L0,"The heirs to Bram Stoker were unwilling to let F W Murnau film Dracula in 1921. So Murnau called his character Count Orlov and his movie Nosferatu. Stoker's character is suave, handsome and a hit with the ladies. Murnau's Count is bald, has ratty teeth and pointed ears. He is gruesome, ugly and would not go over well in the drawing room.

Shadow of the Vampire is ripping with comic excess. The names of the characters are too stereotypically German. There is an aura of unacknowledged camp dripping from some of the characters. The Weimar Decadence seems evident in many scenes. Every main character is on one opiate or another. At the same time, the movie seems austere. These characters are stoic and serious. Whats going on here?

Right away there is a mystery about the lead actor, Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe). Scenes have been filmed on sets in Berlin before the production arrives on location. The first night the Company meets Schreck. He is eerie and horrible. Still the Madhatters from Berlin try to pretend that he is not scaring them to death. We're all seasoned troupers and all that. Humor will be necessary on this movie, to get over the rough spots.

The scenes between Schreck and Gustav Von Wangenheim, who is buying property from the Count, are filmed. Those scenes and all others are staged almost exactly as they were in Murnau's original Nosferatu. On occasion Director E. Elias Merhige substitutes scenes from Murnau's 1922 version. It is difficult to tell the difference.

Suddenly the cameraman collapses. Old Vampire Hands in the Audience know at once that the Wily Schreck must have been at work the night before. Murnau, played by John Malkovich, is outraged. Murnau is almost always outraged. He takes Schreck aside and tells him he must not do this again. Now the audience is on to the fact that Schreck is a REAL vampire.

After a couple of days, we realize that Schreck has a deal with Murnau to leave the cast alone. But the cameraman is dying from suspicious neck wounds. Murnau confronts Schreck and invokes the whole History and Nobility of filmmaking to get the Vampire to cut it out. To no avail. Schreck says he won't continue on the film unless he lances the neck of anyone he cares to, including self-centered leading lady Greta Schroder (Catherine McCormack). His rage spent, Murnau tacitly agrees to the new deal. He MUST complete his project!

While Murnau planes off to Berlin for a replacement cameraman, the film's writer, and Producer Albin Grau, have an extraordinary conversation about the script with Schreck at Twilight. The threesome pass around a large bottle of schnapps. Schreck says the writer doesn't understand the difficulty a Vampire has in trying to pretend to be hospitable to a stranger when he has lived alone for over 500 years. The speech is the most serious in the film. Willem DaFoe captures the loneliness of the Creature, speaking of the difficulty of trying to remember how he should appear to an ordinary man. The scene is as powerful as any I've seen. The drunken writer and producer are, by turns, awed by Schreck's ability to understand ""his character"" and shocked when the actor grabs a bat from the air, rips off its head with his teeth, and drinks its blood.

Murnau returns with a new swashbuckling cameraman, Fritz Arno Wagner (Cary Elwes). Wagner brings an energy to the film that has been missing up to this point. His character resembles real-life directors Eric Fleming and William Wellman. He also brings a ton of camera know-how and enough varieties of drugs to power two movies like this one.

The film really begins to move now. Murnau is manic. Schreck tears into members of the Cast while they are still on the set filming. Its getting hard to ignore what is going on. The film is a little stupid this way because its funny. Its about Germans, you know, and for laughs they are considered a little thick. Finally, in a drugged stupor, Murnau admits there is no Max Schreck, that he discovered this real Vampire while scouting locations for the film. The movie moves toward denouement.

Shadow of the Vampire is choppy and shortened like the TV commercials that Mirhige usually directs. But the movie doesn't have to work perfectly as a piece of movie machinery. The mixture of comedy and seriousness and the wonderful performances, give the film enormous power even if the editing and story-telling aren't perfect.

But the film is not for everyone.

It helps to have seen F. W. Murnau's 1921 Silent Nosferatu and Werner Herzog's 1979 color remake. It helps to know that German actor Udo Dier, who plays Producer Albin Grau in this film, played Andy Warhol's Dracula in 1974. Dier was a straight actor then. He was so funny sucking the blood of ""weregins"" (virgins) only, that ever since he has been cast in strictly comic roles. He can no longer say a line in his thick German accent that does not make one laugh. Eddie Uzzo is an English comic female impersonator who has performed his act for HBO. His performance as the actor playing the character buying land from Nosferatu is awfully good. Malkovich and Cary Elwes, who plays Fritz Arno Wagner, slip out of their faked German accents on occasion. I think they do it on purpose to add to the serendipity of the movie. The film's tone is the same as the overwrought German expressionism of Murnau's 1921 Original. Malkovich's performance is a hoot. He reminds me of Colin Clive's Victor Frankenstein, and a little bit of the former Nazi Scientists who are always caricatured in American space films like the Right Stuff. Malkovich as Murnau is a mad scientist, putting together an unearthly creature: Nosferatu.",1114992000,5,5657,4.791794871794872

1421126,4,B00005B6L0,"Was the vampire Max Schrek portrayed in the original `Nosferatu' an actual demon of darkness? That is the premise of this film, with the mysterious aura of Schreck haunting the celluloid frame. The characterization of Count Orlock {John Malkovich} is excellent , playing an actual vampire who hailed from a family of vampires in Hungarycoaxed to play the role with the promise of the director's wife as a reward. The director turns out to be the true villain with the streak of madness bourne of obsession for his profession - ""Scientists in the creation and preservation of memories."" Indeed.

 The cinematography contains an eerie quality to it, runming from full color to sepia, to black and white, gracefully transitioning to preserve the arcane quality, in effect placing the viewer in that era with the excellent element of realism. Bit by bit - fist a cameraman, then a writer, begin disappearing and turning up dead, husks drained of blood, which frustrates Murnau, for it causes delays as he must replace each one. Finally, they must travel to Heligoland for the final scene, of which the Count is reluctant, which is a trait of the Vampire, that of preferring to remain one native soil and one's preferred created environment  {ergo, the legendary home soil in the coffin}, yet he agrees to travel for the fair neck of the actress, which he does eventually savor, after abstaining for far too long. Unfortunately, the Count is betrayed by Murnauand ends up evaporating in that famous ending scene.

 The legend that has been attached to this film since the beginning was a brilliant ploy to gather controversy and viewers, not unlike the gimmick created around The Blaire Witch Project.

 Nosferatu preceeded the Bela Lugosi Dracula, which was actually the original intent, but Murnau could not secure permission with Bram Stoker's wife;  It was `Dracula' which began the suave, romantic depiction of The Vampire, whereas Nosferatu focused more on the original monster , a grotesque emaciated corpse, but who is not without his own charms. In one notable moment while Orlock was cpnversing with two actors, he suddenly takes up a rat scurrying by, and forthwith begins partaking of its blood with a slurp as sort of a late night snack. The crew believes him to be an eccentric character actor whom none will see out of `costume'.

An imaginative and creative reconstruction of the filming of the film classic ""Nosferatu,"" the film is very entertaining and inventive, and shouldn't disappoint any viewer.  But I don't think it would hold the same level of fascination for someone who hadn't already been captivated by the original.

My only complaint, made with the understanding that not every film can satisfy every expectation, and that the film works well enough within its own plan, is that by portraying Max Schreck as a ""real"" vampire, we don't get to see anything about the ""real"" Max Schreck who I imagine to be fascinating in his own right.  The film also does not shed much light on the question why this film is horrifying on its own, at least for the time in which it was made, because it feels the need to set up the scariness of the film for a contemporary audience by portraying Mr. Schreck as if he really were a strange and scary character in ""real"" life, i.e. as if he weren't a good actor, who happened to have found a role for which he was ideal.  Now to say he is a good actor may surprise some who find his performance over the top -- but his performance really was a powerful one for the day in which it was made.  It is the slow deliberateness, and singularity of purpose, that is frightening; today as film goers we tend to lack the imagination required to find this performance powerful, and want instead violence and sudden movements.

What I find most interesting about older films like Nosferatu one is that they achieve their effects using very different techniques than are used in contemporary horror films -- but that if you put yourself in the right frame of mind you can discover yourself feeling something like what one might expect a contemporary of the film to have felt.  While ""Shadow"" succeeds on one level, as a contemporary film that replaces horror with gleeful campiness, it manages to keep the viewer at a distance from the horror of the original.",1103846400,,2081,4.62059620596206

Is Dafoe's performance Oscar-worthy?  I think so.  It certainly is better than some of the mediocre performances that have won of late.  The script is strong, as well, and the cinematography is beautiful at times.",1076976000,12,745,4.606060606060606
1421132,3,B00005B6L0,"Hmmm. Interesting film. Like many pieces of art that thinks about art, it gets a bit idea-ridden. But the thoughts are interesting, and Dafoe's performance as Schreck / Count Orloch is something divinely weird. Here is a movie with a genius makeup artist, who manages to re-create the vampire of Nosferatu (no creepier vampire has ever been shown on screen, I think) with exactitude . . . and Dafoe gives him PERSONALITY! It's not just the pity-the-monster pathos, though that's beautifully touched on when, alone in a cave, he begins reading from Tennyson's 'Tithonus'  . . . ""The woods decay, the woods decay and fall / the vapors weep their burthen to the ground / Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath / and after many a summer dies the swam.../ Me only cruel immortality consumes. . .  ""  but the absurdity of his situation. He has read Dracula, he says, and finds it sad, because the poor count has no servants, and has to be seen by his guest serving the table, making up a meal he cannot partake. He feeds like an old man pees, he says, all at once or in drips. He ghoulishly stuffs down a passing bat like a Circus geek. He snorts and sniffs like one so long alone has has forgotten to have normal manners. After rudely smacking his lips feeding greedily on the desired maiden (no maiden indeed!) he snores in piggy satiation.  He is awful and repellant, and very, very funny at the same time. Malkovich's Murnau is a little less of a delight. The whole idea of his character--one so obsessed with creating immortal (or should we say undying?) art that he is willing to expose his cast and crew to the depradations of the real vampire thing, is a sort of mad scientist joke that has all the manifest and hard-to-believe stupidity it usually does in the old horror flicks. He keeps cranking away at the camera while Orloch snaps necks and sucks noisily on the heroine's throat. He has striven so hard for verisimilitude that he is willing to have a rogue creature on the set, but then he complains peevishly when the count dares to commit a murder in such a way as to spoil the composition in the frame. Still, what he says about art and film is telling, and memorable. The director is meant to show us another sort of monster, I guess--the kind who gets so in the grip of an idea about imitating reality that he wittingly or unwittingly shoots a snuff film. This is a level of irresponsibility it's a bit hard to accept. But then, of course, it's a level of irresponsibility in our minds because we rapidly come to believe that Orloch either believes he is the real thing or IS the real thing . . . and how real is THAT???? Meanwhile the cast and crew continue to accept his unpleasant presence as that of a method actor who takes his art very seriously. It's a clever hall of mirrors in which not all the characters have reflections. The incorporation of footage from Nosferatu is done extremely well and seamlessly. And yes, there is irony in recalling that one of the first things done in film, was to put on deathless celluloid the moving life  & murderous acts of the undead.",1075507200,6,3098,4.48581560283688

It is hard to imagine that someone could make a mess out of the story of the making of Nosferatu but E. Elias Merhige has managed to do exactly just that. There is ""nothing"" happening in this movie what-so-ever except for the director complaining about his production and Willem Dafoe as the actor Max Schreck trying to manipulate him as some ""accidents"" (of which there are very few) happen on set. Schreck is interesting for the first two minutes and then simply becomes just plain Disney. It is unintentionally funny when it is not meant to be. It is not funny when it tries to be. Dafoe thinks he is in a pantomime most of the time and it looks like one too. His performance is clumsy even at the best of times. You will see through the latex in the first five minutes. It looks cheesy and fake.

1421134,4,B00005B6L0,"Shadow of the Vampire was released with little fanfare, and the film was too quirky to earn any real money at the box office. The first time I saw Shadow of the Vampire, I was amused by the weird humor and thought it was pretty decent. Watching Shadow of the Vampire for a second time, I realize that I vastly under-appreciated this film. Shadow of the Vampire is stunning.
This film is a loving homage to silent filmmaking. Though I haven't seen all of the original silent film ""Nosferatu"", I've seen enough to know that Shadow of the Vampire did a great job of recreating the art direction in Nosferatu.
The humor in Shadow of the Vampire is obvious, but subtler is Willem Dafoe's sad portrayal of bizarre actor Max Schreck. Dafoe's performance can be overlooked because of his makeup and his amusing facial expressions. However, underneath the humor is a sad, lonely man. ""How can you hurt me when I don't even know how to hurt myself?"", asks Max. To me, that means that Max is a tortured soul that has no way to end his suffering.
The ending of Shadow of the Vampire is questionable. Did the film need to end in such a dark manner? Maybe not. But even if one questions the choices of director E. Elias Merhige and writer Steven Katz, the first 70 minutes of Shadow of the Vampire should not be dismissed. Shadow of the Vampire is simultaneously touching, funny, bizarre, and tragic - and well worth seeing more than once.",1073606400,3,1425,4.5271317829457365
1421135,5,B00005B6L0,"There is a fear to be had in this kind of work.  Because it's not only delving into such a monumental piece of motion picture history but purporting to shed new 'light' on that movie's making, 'Nosferatu' purists are likely to avoid it on the grounds that it may de-mystify their beloved pic.  Given the added features on the Special Edition DVD of that 1922 classic, it's easy to see that 'Nosferatu' is not just a movie anymore but a gateway into that cosy, misty, first impression of movie Transylvania our species ever got to see.  How could anyone do such a heinous thing as cut through that sense of eerie escapism?
That's the risk.  If you approach this DVD without ever having seen 'Nosferatu', you'll find it an intriguing work of horror that will make you wonder about the 'what if's.  So much can be read into a picture that is 80+ years old now - where nearly all the actors must now surely be no more and where the first Dracula representation was such a freak of nature to behold.  This film takes full advantage of its rickety, grainy subject and exploits all that can be exploited to the hilt.
The good news for those who have seen (and cherish) 'Nosferatu' is you will probably experience the same wonder.  'Shadow ...' doesn't denigrate a thing about 'Nosferatu'.  Instead, it presents creaking secret compartments within the castle that was 'Nosferatu'.  The two should one day be twinned on the same DVD release, or tripled with Herzog's remake of the silent classic.
The cast are brilliant - Dafoe and Malkovich interplaying particularly well.  The 'German' accents are immaterial - the essence of the work itself is everything.  This is like taking what 'Burden of Dreams' is to 'Fitzcarraldo' and adding yet another dimension.
Its genre is 'horror'.  It's an impossible documentary, also - what happens when you view a magical object through a magical lens.  All in all, an overdose of beautifully crafted movie mythos.",1070582400,,1942,4.7611940298507465

The premise is that Murnau cast a real vampire in the person of the frightful Max Schreck in his '22 film.

Soon enough though, the vampire starts killing the rest of the cast and crew and messing up Murnau's entire production. Willem Dafoe's gloriously over-the-top performance as the vampire Max Schreck should have won him the Oscar (he lost to Benicio Del Toro for ""Traffic""), and there are surprisingly good turns by John Malkvich and English comedian Eddie Izzard. While there are some slow moments and a few underdeveloped character, this quirky little film is a winner.
This DVD is in the aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The image looks very grainy at some points and the orangey colour palette will test the limits of your DVD player. Image is pretty sharp, however.
The true value of the DVD lies in the extensive extras. There is the usual Behind-the-Scenes documentary, as well as a commentary by director E. Elias Merhige. There are informative interviews with Willem Dafoe, Merhige, and producer Nicholas Cage.

1421138,3,B00005B6L0,"Shadow of a Vampire's premise is first rate, as is its cast, cinematography and much of its acting, but despite this huge promise and, in its various departments, considerable delivery, Shadow of the Vampire really doesn't work.
It's a smashing premise: in casting his legendary silent horror Nosferatu, German director FW Murnau hired a real vampire to play Max Schreck, the actor playing the vampire in the movie. A ready made excuse, therefore, to run plenty of footage from the original film, visit and re-stage many of its scenes, all of which is done with relish. You can just imagine the meal John Malkovich makes of the obsessive, laudanum tooting director, and he signally fails to disappoint, but is nonetheless royally outdone by Willem Dafoe - *almost* unrecognisable - chewing scenery (as well as cast and crew) as the vampire.
Well made-up though he may be, I don't think Dafoe captures Max Schreck awfully well: he's uglier and more angular, for a start, whereas Schreck had a sort of Chaplinesque goofiness about him which lent a fair bit of pathos to his character. And Dafoe's rendition tends (when ""off screen"", at any rate) to pull faces unshakably reminiscent of Wilfred Bramble, (the ""dirty old man"" from British comedy classic Steptoe & Son).
But this is small stuff. The big problem the film has is coherence: superficially it's all fine, but director Merhige is clearly getting at something a little more substantial than black slapstick, but for the life of me I couldn't work out what it was.
Partly what confuses is the acting: Malkovich and Dafoe are both so over-the-top that it is difficult to treat them as anything other than comedy performances, but this in turn undermines a markedly heavy denouement, in which both feature prominently. And Dafoe is often hard to make out - many of his critical lines are uttered not just in cod Transylvanian, but sotto voce as well (I searched in vain on the DVD for English subtitles but alas there were none!)
Lastly, the narrative is very disjointed - partly, I suppose, as a result of having to follow the film around the different scenes and gel with the historical facts of the production - but it is a director's job to smooth out and explain - to create an indelible and coherent memory, as Murnau himself might say, and I don't think this was done.

1421140,4,B00005B6L0,"First off, this is not a horror film.
It's actually a funny, well-executed movie about the making of a classic silent horror film, NOSFERATU.
SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE's take is that the director, F.W. Murnau, hired a genuine vampire to play his Count.
Director Murnau is played by John Malkovich and there's nothing I like more in a movie than to see John Malkovich yell at someone.  When I watch IN THE LINE OF FIRE, I rerun the scene where he's frothing on the phone at Clint Eastwood at least a half-dozen times.  Nobody freaks out like Malkovich.  And he gets the chance to yell at just about everyone: his crew, his actors, even the vampire he tries to control.
The Count is played by Willem Dafoe, almost unrecognizable in his makeup until he smiles or peels his eyes.  His scenes with Malkovich are priceless, whether arguing over missing crew members or which one of them is the greater monster.  These guys are just so good together.
I found a very subtle but hilarious humor at work here.  The scene where the Count snatches a bat out of the air, bites its head off and then [drinks] it dry as the producer and writer watch and admire his dedication to the role--believing he's just ""method acting""--is hilarious.  What makes this film special is that it doesn't play as a comedy.  It maintains its straight face and creepy atmosphere.
And it's so much more fun because of it.

William Dafoe plays a vampire so old that he can barely remember life as a man and he is stunning, especially in his monolouge on the movie set.

The cast and crew are stunned by his appearence and habits, but the man holds a darker secret that must be seen to be believed.

What is the line between art and science?  With the exception of actors, the real Murnau made everyone on his sets wear labcoats and goggles because he viewed filmmaking as a science, not an art.  Malkovich does a wonderful job playing a tortured soul trying to create something as subjective as a film through the objective lens of science.  He butts heads with the actors and his own crew, who don't share his view on filmmaking.  Max Schreck, with his unorthodox acting methods, quickly becomes Murnau's nemesis.
What is the line between genius and lunacy?  Was Max Schreck the Uber-Artiste, or a madman?  Was Murnau's relentless pursuit of scientific achievement a result of brilliance in action, or merely obsessive ravings?  More than anything, ""Shadow"" is the story of two men.  Neither one may be in their right mind, but both believe they have ultimate control of a final product.  The artist, the scientist... are they really so different?
The ending IS different.  It wraps up so nicely, and that's a problem.  For a film that brought up serious philosophical questions, the end seems cut-and-dry.  In real life, strange, unexplained incidents plagued the set of the movie.  Noone ever knew what really happened.  After shooting was wrapped up, Murnau and Schreck parted ways.  Murnau had almost made it in Hollywood when he died in a car accident in 1931. Schreck had a long career that lasted until his death from a heart attack in 1936.  To compensate for the lack of exciting facts, ""Shadow"" wraps up in Hollywood fashion: low in intellect, large in bang.  It's as though it was written by a test audience.

Murnau was the director of ""Nosferatu"", that's the really old(early 1900's) one with the creepy vamp with pointed ears. Which is basically what this movie is about. But in this movie about a movie, the actor Max Schreck(who is actually played by Willem Dafoe a.k.a The Green Goblin) who is set to play Count Orlock(their version of Dracula...they had to change the name because Bram Stoker's widow wouldn't give them the rights) takes his role a little too seriously.

Instead, screenwriter Steven Katz (any relation to the comic?) and E. Elias Merhige have created a work of art, though short of a 5-star masterpeice, that is true to the German expressionism of the original ""Nosferatu"".
The feel of the film is like that of Film Noir which emanated from German Expressionism (See Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari), so expect a dark and moody montage.  But the true highlight is that of the dynamics between William Dafoe as the vampire (yes, a real vampire) and John Malkovich as Murnau the pre-WWII Berlin film auteur.  The two actors alone make the film a worthwhile watch, yet they are supplemented by excellent performances from Catherine McCormack (Braveheart), Cary Elwes (Princess Bride) and Eddy Izzard (transvestite English comic, I kid you not).
Yet I wouldn't stop there in the film's praises.  The story has humor, albeit dark comedy, that somehow works with a gothic setting.  Not Sam Raimi/Army Of Darkness funny, but an intellectual humor more reminscent of Tim Burton's sly fun in ""Ed Wood"".  There are a few vacuums you will sense in the film as a whole, but the pros greatly outweigh the cons in this case.

Now, it was interesting enough seeing the scenes from the movie with new actors and in colour, but they were still unfaithful, rigid, and just pathetic.  Did ANY member of the cast or crew watch ""Nosferatu"" (1922) besides the writer?!?!?  And speaking of the writing, it's pretty danged tin-pan-alley!  Also, Defoe does NOT act like Max Schreck AT ALL.  He's WAY too sudden and murderous in his movements.  Schreck was slow, stiff, spidery, and creepy.  Defoe was just like ""SNARL!!!"" <twitch> <twitch>!  Now, the idea of making a movie about the making of Nosferatu except that Schreck is a vampire IS A PRETTY COOL IDEA.  Really.

1421153,5,B00005B6L0,"This was one fun movie. The story is loosely based on the making on the silent classic NOSFERATU in 1922. It was directed by the German director, F.W. Murnau, and is considered one of the best (if not the best) vampire movies ever made. I still have memories as a kid watching it on TV. The scene where the vampire's shadow ascends the staircase gave me nightmares for weeks.
It was Murnau's radical idea (for that time) to film the novel DRACULA on location in an abandoned old castle in Czechoslovakia. Unfortunately, the estate of Bram Stoker wouldn't give Murnau the rights to film the novel. So he changed the plot very slightly and the name of his vampire from Count Dracula to Count Orlok.
The Count was played by an actor named Max Schreck, whose name is German for ""Maximum Terror. The name fit him well. He is most unlike the vampires that one is used to in a vampire movie. He didn't have a flowing cape, was very ugly, had the ears of a rat, a bald head, long talons for fingernails, extremely dense and bushy eyebrows, and two pointed teeth in the front instead of fangs. He repulsed women instead of seducing them like the charming vampires later on like Bela Lugosi or Frank Langella.
The film was supposed to make Schreck an international star,but lawsuits from the Stoker estate stopped the film from wide distribution and he only did a few more films after. Little is known about him, and that's where the fun begins with SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE.
It's about the making of the silent film NOSFERATU, but it takes a lot of liberties with it. I want to make this clear - this is NOT a realistic account of how NOSFERATU was made. It is the premise of this new film that the director F.W. Murnau (played wonderfully by John Malkovich) would seemingly do anything to get his film made. For the vampire lead, he hires someone (Willem Dafoe) who thinks he is a real vampire - or is he? Murnau tells his cast that his choice for the role of Count Orlok is a theater actor named Max Schreck who likes to stay in character all the time, even when the camera's not running. He tells the cast just to play along with the demands of this strange actor. And the demands do get strange!
It was amazing how much Willem Dafoe's character resembled the original, and how well they recreated the scenes of the silent classic. There's a couple instances where they even inserted footage from the original, but unless you know NOSFERATU real well, you may not be able to tell.
I don't want to tell you anymore of the plot. Just go rent (or but) it and have a good time. There's parts that are funny, parts that are creepy, and even a part where Schreck talks about being a vampire with two of the crew that's a bit melancholic. It's not a real deep movie, but it will make for interesting conversation afterwards.

At first I wasn't sure what to make of the film, but after repeated viewings Shadow of the Vampire has become quite possibly my all time favorite film.  Those expecting a normal vampire film will get a surprise, this is a different kind of vampire movie.  A tribute of sorts to the original crew of the legendary German film Nosferatu, John Malkovich stars as director F.W. Murnau, and Willem Dafoe is ""character actor"" Max Shreck.  As the film unfolds we learn Shreck is an actual vampire, and his personality comes out the more he is around the film crew.  I will say that Dafoe gives a knockout performance, and he earned his Best Supporting Actor nomination, his makeup (which was also nominated for an Academy Award) was excellent as well.  But what made Dafoe's performace so great was one scene in particular where he is talking outside to the film makers about why reading Bram Stoker's Dracula made him sad (you have to watch it, this is what acting is all about).  Malkovich was haunting as the obsessive director, willing to go to any extreme to complete his masterpiece, and the question as to who the real monster is, Murnau or Shreck, will be something you'll be asking yourself.  The special features are worth noting, Nicolas Cage produced the film and offers an interview, as does Dafoe, both of which are great and interesting to those who cannot get enough of the film.

The storyline (a director hiring a real vampire to act the part of a vampire) is very convincingly presented.  I especially enjoyed some of the comic scenes between the director (Malkovich) and the vampire (Dafoe).  However, the second half is boring.

1421157,4,B00005B6L0,"When a German avante-garde movie director in the 1920s named F.W. Murnau sets out to make the ultimate vampire movie, only the supreme ""method actor"" Max Schreck can be the titular leading man for ""Nosferatu,"" destined to be the seminal vampire film.  At first, Schreck's fellow performers think the ugly old man is merely eccentric, but when cast and crew start to disappear mysteriously, they begin to wonder just what Murnau has invited into their midst.
Shadow of the Vampire is an endlessly clever and innovative picture about what might have happened if the now legendary Murnau had shot his vampire masterpiece with a real vampire in the lead.  John Malkovich is totally believable in his role as the marginally sane film maker, capturing the full essense of intermingled genius and madness perfectly.  Likewise, Willem Dafoe is a splendid nosferatu, at once ogre, cartoon, and hapless victim.  Certainly, Dafoe's Max Schreck (who, so far as we know, achieved his immortal performance solely on the basis of his natural acting abilities, and not because of any supernatural qualities!), is a much more sympathetic being than Nosferatu's Count Orlock was ever made to be. Indeed, the entire cast is exceptional, lending an air of authenticity to what could have been a completely farcical fantasy.
Filmed in shots of surreal, dream-like scenes of lingering shadows and intimate close-ups, Shadow of the Vampire is a beautiful viewing experience and a captivating look at the (dysfunctional) artistic ambition.  Though perhaps not as exciting as say, John Carpenter's Vampires, Shadow of the Vampire lingers in the imagination longer because of its greater depth and irresistible humanity.  A unique film, one that at once harkens back to a grander age of movie-making and makes us more cognizant of those mortal elements that are ever and always a part of our being.  Not your typical vampire flick by any means, this is a mature piece of cinema art that I believe Murnau himself would be proud of.",1021161600,3,2004,5.072948328267477
1421158,4,B00005B6L0,"Shadow of the Vampire has an interesting premise, even though it takes enormous liberties. It is based on the making of the classic 1921 German vampire movie, Nosferatu, and gives it a fascinating twist by having Max Shreck, the actor who played Nosferatu in the original film, as a real vampire. This is a fun idea and it is effectively carried through, especially as William Dafoe convincingly recreates the Max Shreck role. The film director, F. W. Murnau, is obsessed with finishing his film regardless of the number of his own crew who `mysteriously' disappear, victims to the vampire's relentless hunger. ""You and I are not so different,"" says the vampire to Murnau at one point.
A study of the early years of filmmaking and of the obsessive and ruthless pursuit of obsession, this film captures both perfectly. It is both funny and scary in turn. John Malkovich excels, as usual, as the film-director, F.W. Murnau.",1016928000,2,921,4.910256410256411
1421159,3,B00005B6L0,"If you're a hardcore horror movie fan, forget Shadow of a Vampire. But if you are looking for something clever and amusing, this one's for you. The movie takes a real life event, German director F. W. Murnau's filming of his classic vampire movie, Nosferatu, in 1921, and weaves a fantasy based on this question: What if Max Shreck, the bizarre actor who played the vampire, really was a vampire? Though it lags just a bit at times, the movie is often entertaining and sometimes quite funny. For those who are into actors and acting, Willem Dafoe's performance alone is a good enough reason to watch it.
Murnau [John Malkovich] is portrayed as a control freak and as someone who cares little about anyone but himself. He considers himself a visionary, and, in real life, he truly was a gifted pioneer in the fledgling art of film making. He plans to film most of Nosferatu on location, a cumbersome and tricky thing to do eighty years ago. His party-loving leading lady [Catherine McCormick] is appalled. She would prefer to stay at the studio because she can go to cabarets and be her Bohemian self after work. What no one but Murnau knows is that having to rough it in rural Germany is the least of the cast and crew's problems. They are about to meet Max [Dafoe], who only films at night and who comes to work already in costume. He doesn't need makeup. He looks the part because he is the part. His payment? The leading lady, of course.
The movie is cleverly photographed. When we see the crew filming a scene, the film goes from color to black and white, making it look much like the original Nosferatu. This technique gives modern audiences a good idea of what viewers way back then were seeing. These scenes really are more ominous in black and white.
The supporting cast is quite good, but this is Dafoe and Malkovich's movie. They are spectacular in their scenes together. They show us that, while Shreck is a monster because he sucks people's blood, Murnau is equally evil because he knows how to suck people's souls. The movie wisely uses humor for the most part to make this point.
As I mentioned before, the picture may seem a bit slow at times. Movies about making movies often seem this way, because watching the actual process is not that interesting to many people. So, Shadow of the Vampire is best suited for those audience members who love movies passionately. For the rest, it should prove mildly diverting.",1016150400,,2428,4.622685185185185

But he is unable to obtain the rights to the novel so he is forced to make an imitation. He gathers a great crew and cast. Everything is a little weird to begin with but when the extremely strange Max Schreck finally appears to play the part of the vampire count, things get out of hand.
My Opinion: The story was interesting in this art house film but it lacked any type of depth. The single premise was stretched pretty thin by the time the end of the movie rolled around. You basically knew what was going to happen, but were forced to sit and wait for the gruesome details. I fear that the filmmakers may have spent too much time making sure the sets and costumes were historically correct, and neglected the script. Both Malkovich and Dafoe give great performances and are the best things in the movie. I couldn't even tell that it was Dafoe under all that ghoulish makeup. But in the end two great performances and a thin story do not make a great movie. I was left wanting something with a little more bite.
DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen anamorphic - 2.35:1 Sound: DD5.1 Extras: Commentary, Featurette, Photo Gallery, Nicholas Cage interview.
What You Should Do:  Rent this if you are into artsy movies because you like to be different. It is even worth a rental for the performances of Malkovich and Dafoe if that interests you. This is not a mainstream movie by any means. It is not a horror movie either. The best description might be a dramatic what if type historical recreation.

So Murnau makes a deal with Max Schreck a real vampire played by (Willem Dafoe) That if Max plays the vampire Count Orlock in  Murnau's film NOSFERATU. that at the end of the film he can drink the blood of his female co-star. But no one else that are working on the film knows about the deal or that max schreck is a real vampire they are all just told that max schreck will always stay in character.

The acting was very good, especially William Dafoes. The way he would tap his long nails together and pull his face in so it looked like he was sniffing was fascinating. The greediness of the director and the need to get his picture as real as he could makes you wonder if directors are really like this. His obession of getting all the carnage on film makes you think he is a human monster, using dracula as his weapon to inflict death on the innocent. Although, the main actress still feels the need to play out her part even in the throes of her deathbed. The narcisstic need to be a legend still is a consuming passion. Wow, what some people will do to achieve fame. Well, the movies depth and style caused me to give it 4 stars.

Malkovich as the director so obsessed with his ""science"" that ANY compromise is necessary.  The lives of his actors and crew are irrelevent.
Dafoe's character slowly gaining power over the film, he recognizes that Malkovich is a greater monster that he will ever be.  The final scence where what remains of the crew keeps filming is the ultimate commentary on the fascination that evil has over us.

1421169,4,B00005B6L0,"I'm sure Murnau would have been quite flattered with this odd tribute. The concept of making a movie about Murnau and Nosferatu as a vampire movie is a great idea to begin with. The premise of the film - what if Max Shreck, the mysterious actor who played Count Orlock in the classic vampire film, really was a vampire? - is also a great concept, especially since so little was really known about him. The idea is great, but very difficult to handle, as the film proves; the ideas have not been fully developed, and there are huge gaps in the plot. Except for the characters and the scenes from the original movie, Shadow Of The Vampire has little to do with historical facts and the whole thing doesn't make much sense.
But who cares? It's still incredibly entertaining, scary at times but never pointlessly gory, with a dark, ironic sense of humor which never trails into silliness. Merhige's directing is fabulous, and he seems to really feel a bond with Murnau; the photography, costumes and lighting are wonderful. Of course, the two lead actors steal the show - John Malkovich as Murnau and Willem Defoe as Shreck, both of them frightfuly good in their roles. Cary Elwes, Eddie Izzard and Catherine McCormack are all good too. The acting and the direction more than make up for the somewhat flawed script. At any rate, it's certainly refreshingly better than the dozens of terrible teen-summer-horror movie that have been swarming the theaters in recent years. A very good movie, if you're a fan of the genre.
The special features, by the way, are really nothing special. Only Director's comments and a couple of interviews. I would have liked to see some reference to the original movie.",1010966400,,1694,4.745762711864407

Best known for his role as Orlock in Nosferatu, he made only a handful of other films before fading back into obscurity. But who *was* he? We really don't know. This gap in our collective knowledge is the basis of Shadow of the Vampire. What if Shreck gave such a creepy performance in Nosferatu because he was a real vampire?
Shadow of the Vampire is a well-made film that blends fear and horror effectively with humor. It will never really have you rolling nor will it scare you out of your wits but it always keeps you entertained.

I found Willem Dafoe's character, 'Max Schreck' to be totally adorable. Yes, he kills people by drinking their blood, but there is something about him that almost makes you feel sorry for him. I mean, he did have to live out all those years, alone, probably bored... and hungry... and then the movie crew came along, and he was very friendly with them. Well, friendly with some, feasting on others. ;) I would like some makeup.  Well you don't get any!  (My favorite part of the movie).  This movie just cracks me up, but it's definitely got a serious undertone, especially apparent in the ending. Which by the way, endings usually make or break the movie for me... in this case, the end made the movie, I thought. It was just so good. I'm sure not everyone will see the humor in it... but I think most people (especially those with a more sarcastic sense of humor) will appreciate this great film. The DVD is quite good as well. It's amazing ... the transformation Willem Dafoe goes through when they apply the makeup for Max. Very good acting... very good dialogue... very humorous... very easy to watch. Can you tell I love this movie?? If you like more Indie-themed movies (I personally feel they are usually more creative and better than Hollywood-mainstream movies, but that of course is just my opinion), or you like Mr. Burns from the Simpsons, like myself (So Max Schreck kind of reminds me of Mr. Burns (do I have weird taste in guys or what? haha) then you should definitely take a chance on this movie!!",1007596800,2,1686,4.557755775577558

I heard about the film ""Shadow Of The Vampire, but basically ignored it, thinking it was just another sad attempt at cashing in on a far too trite genre. However a while later, I took a chance and purchased ""Shadow Of The Vampire"" on video, brought it home and watched it. Needless to say, I was impressed and amazed how good this film is! How could there yet be another film about Nosferatu that is original and worth watching, I kept saying to myself? Well, this movie prooves that there is, as well as how there can be.
""Shadow Of The Vampire"" is a film within a film; a story within a story. It is a film about the crew and director and players who made the original 1922 Nosferatu--but it is not a docu-drama. It is an orginal story of fiction that touches on non-fiction.
The movie is full of grace, elegance, atmosphere, wit, and refinement. The acting performances, particularly by Willem Dafoe and John Malkovich, are superb and brilliant. The musical score is tasteful and effective.
""Shadow Of The Vampire"" isn't a particular scary film, but it certainly does get creepy at times, and can be quite disturbing. It is the great sense of wit and unintentional (at least in appearance!) humour finely woven throughout this film that keeps it from becoming the usual Vampire fodder; not to mention the clever story with its twist after twist.

1421174,5,B00005B6L0,"As one who would rather pick through dusty attics than the *New Arrivals!* section of Blockbuster for a film to watch, this for me was a rare treat. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting in a theatre with other people who had seen, or at least heard of, FF Murnau's wonderfully creepy film.
With the double whammy of being black and white and silent, the film might be at Blockbuster, maybe one copy, but probably a cheap one, badly reproduced, just reinforcing people's stereotyping of silent films. I hope Shadow of the Vampire keeps rental copies of Nosferatu hopping.
And it just may, because it's a great film. Max Shreck, the actor playing the Nosferatu, is a real vampire. FF Murnau is a symbolic bloodsucker, slurping his actors dry, thinking only of the film.
In addition to being a great vampire film, this is a great period piece. Sometimes 21st century audiences need reminding that even though Nosferatu is set in Victorian times, it was made in the 1920's. I assume the Victorian atmosphere is well done, just because I don't see any evidence of 1922. At any rate, an era that is viewed as innocent by both us in 2001, and the cast of the film in 1922 is recreated. This is important, because the 20's themselves were a not-so-innocent time. So we have a period piece within a period piece, smooth and fascinating.
The atmospheric effect of the film is so good, I wish the cameraman would give lessons. The color of the film is wonderful. Although gore is restrained, the entire film looks as though it was shot through a vial of blood. There is a creepiness, but not the sort that you feel at a space alien or slasher movie, waiting for the moment that the monster is finally shown in full view. The creepiness here is the kind you get when you make a wrong turn and find yourself in a strange neighborhood, where people dress oddly, the buildings are in an unfamiliar style, and the more you try to find your way, the more lost you become.

1421176,4,B00005B6L0,"I wasn't sure what to make of ""Shadow of the Vampire"" after my first viewing.  I bought it on a whim on Halloween night, to scare my girlfriend with a ""Nosferatu"" double-feature.  When the World Series game ran long, we ended up watching neither.  I finally got to ""Shadow"" two weeks later and came away unsettled.  This is more a movie about scary notions -- about shadows -- than a scary movie itself.  Why did the film begin and end with 5-minute-long title sequences?  Why was the ending so suddenly downbeat?
However, I was still fascinated, so came back to watch a second time and was quite impressed.  Now I wasn't expecting Technicolor gore (most of the deaths are alluded to, not shown), and got to enjoy more fully the electric dialogue between stars Malkovich and Dafoe.  I wanted to cheer when Cary Elwes swashbuckled onto the screen late in the picture.  I enjoyed Eddie Izzard's portrayal of Z-grade silent film star Von Wangenheim -- Izzard's manic gesticulations reminded me of Jay Leno in his more bizarre character bits.  But it all comes down to John Malkovich in the mad-scientist goggles and Willem Dafoe munching on a bat.  These are expert actors and we should all clearly be more like them in our daily lives.  I want those goggles.
The DVD extras are worth your time.  The video interviews with Merhige, star Willem Dafoe, and producer Nicolas Cage (who's very *freaky*, bug-eyed and fidgety) are short, and do more than just mimic the director commentary.  Izzard has a great line on the making-of featurette.  Watch for two hidden trailers in the ""Recommendations"" section.
Merhige's commentary track is mostly a winner.  It's weighty stuff, be warned; Merhige is in full-on film school professor mode, discussing abstract notions, technical details, and Goethe.  The commentary for ""The Last Temptation of Toxie"" this isn't.  He does occasionally go overboard, talking his way through the endless opening titles, going orgasmic while comparing his ""Nosferatu"" recreations to the original, and rambling a sort of Oscar acceptance speech at the end.  On the whole it's a good commentary track and if you choose to watch the movie more than once, this is a good use of 85 minutes.",1006300800,6,2205,4.894878706199461

And it is interesting that Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" was acclaimed as an influential piece that has left its mark in the work of filmmakers as recent as Tim Burton (""Nightmare Before Christmas""), when a simulationist film applying the filming process of ""Nosferatu"" looks BACK on what film is really all about.

1421178,4,B00005B6L0,"Unlike a lot of other reviewers on these pages, I didn't have a problem with the story.  It was easy enough to follow, and a great idea to start with  However, the film does have one major problem-the editing.  That's why it does feel slow quite often, and why many scenes seem to end with the characters trailing anti-climactically off the set.  The jump cuts are annoying, and completely throw off the film's pacing.
 That aside, however, there's also a great many things to enjoy in Shadow of the Vampire.  One of its best features is the blend of comedy and drama, the pathos of the vampire contrasted with his enjoyably theatrical snarling.  I've never seen a vampire who was more lovable than Max Schreck.  The gleam in his eye when he whispers, ""I don't think we need the writer any longer,"" is absolutely priceless, while the loneliness in his voice when he says he is unable to create other vampires is touching.  Probably shouldn't be, but is.  Murnau comes accross as much more monstrous in many scenes, although he is strangely appealing too.  So the film gets full marks for taking a buch of characters who should be thoroughly detestable, and making them interesting and likeable.  The cast deserves credit for this, from Malkovich's intense and insane Murnau and Dafoe's wonderful Schreck, to supporting characters like Udo Kier's gentle, sympathetic Albin, and Ronan Vibert's beleaguered cameraman Wolf.
 Meanwhile, the recreations of scenes from the original Nosferatu are fascinating.  I haven't seen the original, although I definately will now, but whether or not these scenes capture Nosferatu's brilliance, they certainly market it well.  Seeing Count Orlock grinning horribly up through the coffin lid was terrifying-and, like the rest of the movie, funny in a dark and twisted way.",1005782400,2,1805,5.010067114093959
1421179,4,B00005B6L0,"I mention that this is a great addition to the Nosferatu trilogy.  Let me clarify that statement.  Everyone is familiar with the original 1922 Nosferatu original by F.W. Murnau.  I have a copy of it, and I agree with many of the critics, it is one of the scariest movies of all time.  Several shots from that film of Max Schreck as the infamous Count Orlock or Count Dracula stand out in my mind as among as the scariest scenes in film history along with The Exorcist and the original  Alien as well as Hitchcock's The Birds. I also have a copy of the second film in the trilogy, Werner Herzog's 1979 remake of Nosferatu with Klaus Kinski playing the infamous Count Orlock.  It is a fantastic remake with political overtones for me, because I have always interpreted the original Nosferatu as a subliminal warning against Hitler as a blood sucker.  In Herzog's remake, the evil is not completely defeated as if to suggest that evil can never be completely defeated.  Surely history since 1979 has borne this out.  Now to Shadow of the Vampire which I think is a an homage to the original Nosferatu.  I rewatched Shadow of the Vampire the other night and then rewatched the 1922 and then the 1979 Nosferatu.  Both sequels really honor the original in theme, tone, and style.  In fact, I don't think a person can truly appreciate Shadow of the Vampire without watching the original Nosferatu first because of all the inside references to that film.  Perhaps that is why so many people who have never watched the original Nosferatu might have been disappointed with Shadow of the Vampire.  Remember, Shadow of the Vampire is an homage film, an ""art house"" film in the tradition of Hearts of Darkness which is a documentary about the making of Apocalypse Now.  People watching Shadow of the Vampire expecting to see a graphic horrific film will be disappointed.  Shadow of the Vampire is about how art affects people, and what people will do for art.  It is more of a thinking film than anything else, but the end, for those who are patient, should certainly satisfy those who watch the film hoping for a climatic, violent ending.  There certainly is a climax which is violent and to me, is chilling. What is this film about?  What people will do for art, and fame, and what films are about and what they do to the actors as well as the audience.  The last movie that made me think like this about watching something horrific and not being able to do anything about it is David Lynch's Blue Velvet.  I put Shadow of the Vampire in the same category.  A thinking man's nightmare.",1003104000,5,2574,4.586433260393873
1421180,3,B00005B6L0,"***1/2  ""Shadow of the Vampire"" is a brilliantly conceived dissertation on the fine line that exists between art and reality, between creative genius and obsessive/compulsive madness.  Lovers of film will get a particular kick out of this production since it uses as its kernel of historic truth the making of F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent horror classic ""Nosferatu,"" a film that predated the American version of ""Dracula"" by almost a decade.
Writer Steven Katz and director E. Elias Merhige have envisioned the famed actor Max Schreck (who portrayed the original vampire in Murnau's film) as an ACTUAL vampire, hired by Murnau to achieve the highest degree of realism possible.  However, as Murnau soon discovers, it isn't always easy to keep a real vampire down on the set - and, as a number of his crew members start to fall victim to this ultimate in ""method actors,"" the completion of the film itself becomes ever more doubtful.
Walking a fine line between muted suspense and dark comedy, the film makes certain that we never quite forget the parallels that exist between the vampire, who yearns to make a victim of the beautiful starlet assigned to play the lead female role, and the director, who will sacrifice his own cast and crew to achieve his artistic ends.  The film provides a fascinating duel of wills as both vampire and director confront one another with threats, recriminations and broken promises, only vaguely aware that they are really playing at the same game.  As Schreck, Willem DaFoe brings a strange sensitivity to the man behind the makeup.  We actually feel for this creature who has obviously fallen from the pinnacle of wealth and fine living in his ""previous"" life into this nocturnal pit where his only companions are bats and rats he is forced to devour for his own survival.  One of the most poignant moments in the film comes when Schreck, alone on a deserted set, watches in mournful fascination a clip of film showing nothing more amazing or profound than a simple summer sunrise.
John Malkovich gives his usual superb performance as Murnau, a man who becomes so absorbed in bringing his own make believe world to artistic fulfillment that he eventually cannot distinguish between what is real and what is illusory, eventually calling on his film crew to complete the final scene, totally unaware that they all lie dead at his feet, victims of his own obsessive madness.  As Murnau tells his suddenly uncooperative leading man/vampire about the nature of film and, by extension, life, ""If it happens outside the frame, it isn't happening.""
On a technical level, ""Shadow of the Vampire"" is an astonishing achievement in the art of filmic recreation.  Many of the film-within-a-film scenes capture the quintessence of Murnau's original work almost to a tee.  Although DeFoe's image doesn't quite reach the grotesque level of Schreck's original, the sets and general appearance of the recreated shots often fool us into believing we are seeing the real thing.  Also, the filmmakers capture well the atmosphere of decadence that defined much of the artistic community in that postwar German era.
""Shadow of the Vampire"" is a highly unique and innovative creation.  In a way, it honors the endurance of the original ""Nosferatu"" in showing that you really cannot keep a good vampire - or a good vampire movie - buried forever.",1003017600,5,3354,4.9696428571428575

1421186,4,B00005B6L0,"Few of us will have failed to make a connection between the thirsty vampire and devouring male sexual greed, of sex as a taking, as violent and penetrating, of exploiting and depleting of the female.  But this can also be the experience of the mother with the child inside her, and of her child in relation to the foetal environment. This is also likely to be retaliation of the baby towards an environment which increasingly fails it at various points. The wooden stake clasped by the woman in this film could easily stand for the negative umbilical affect, the poisonous feeling-states or chemical toxins from the mother that pierce the baby through the umbilical chord.
 The climax of this film comes right at the end, with film crew, cast, new cameraman, and young wife all assembled with Nosferatu on the island of |Heligoland. As he approaches her in the bedroom, the woman sees in the bedside mirror that the vampire has no shadow, so he must be real.  Screaming in terror like a woman in childbirth, she is injected with morphine, like the woman in child birth, so that she is barely conscious and unable to resist the blood letting.  ""He casts no reflection"" cries the terrified Greta.  For birth is like a black hole. No light can escape it.  Awareness is sucked into darkness. The vampire in each of us wants the immortality of never being born. We seek immortality in an imaginary world, mirrored by the celluloid world of film. We imagine that mother earth will never be exhausted by our greed and will always be able to discharge our waste products. We seek to banish our deaths by denying the experience of birth. Even Freud had a terror of outliving his own mother. The vampire now drinks the blood he craves unhindered.  Greta is haemoraghing. But the plot of the film makers to deal with the threat of the hungry vampire has been undermined. The film crew, decked out in their white medical coats are now as much obstetricians as cinematographers.  Their cervix does not open. The tunnel of light from the outside world remains blocked off.  The vampire has cut the cervical chain mechanism that opens the outer doors to the daylight.
 The vampire hopes to stay in the dark with his fantasised eternal prize, an inexhaustibe placenta. But as one of the film makers has pointed out, there is no way off the island. There is no fuel left in the plane.  The reality is that blood supplies will soon run out. The modern health professionals are gathered at the door with their forceps, taking over the job of the unconscious anaesthetised haemoraging woman. Like the baby stuck in the birth canal, the celuloid film sticks in the camera. Both the film and the vampire are burned to ash by the fierce intensity of the light.
 The experience of birth can be  like death by burning, unendurable. It is not a coincidence that the wise women who gathered herbs and provided midwifery services to medieval women were the ones burned at the stake for witch craft in  medieval, Nosferatu times.
 I wonder if the audience of this article can endure to be aware of what I am writing, or whether these words will be eradicated by some editor before they even reach the point of becoming combustible paper. Malkovic, as the film director, declares that he is making this film in the service of science. You and I , dear reader, are no longer to be left chained to the walls of Plato's cave seeing only reflections.  From now on we will no longer be able to say that we were not there.  We were there at our births.  We were conscious, at least to the point when the pain became trans-marginal and our memory became buried in the darkness, though not eradicated.  The pseudo-scientific myth makers who affirmed so unequivocally that there could be no birth experiences, because the nerve cells are not yet myelinated at birth, have been exposed as purveyors of intellectual opiates equivalent to the chemical ones used to suppress the mother's and babies experience of birth.
 As Herr Murnau winds on the old camera by hand, one is tempted to think of  this scene as a masturbatory fantasy, a narcissistic sexual devouring of the mother/Goddess, male revenge upon woman as mother. ""In this scene you will make the ultimate sacrifice for love,""  Murnau tells Greta.  This statement is totally inexplicable in terms of pretty young woman and hideous monster. And make no mistake, Willem Dafoes Nosferatu is no tall dark handsome stranger, but a rival to Boris Karlof's greatest performances. It is only in birth that a woman sacrifices herself to great pain for love.  Malcovic's face is shown in colour while the vampire and victims are in monochrome. He is totally uninterested in the threat of death to himself or his colleagues at the creatures hands. The vampire has cut the chain which connects the counterweight to the solid portcullis that opens to the outside world and  the bright light of day. The humans are locked in with the vampire till he can escape at dusk. He does indeed kill the directors assistants, but in the face of the directors calm insistence, he goes back to complete his part in the script, expiring in the flood of light let in by the noisy rescuers, battling in from the outside  world.  Just as the light starts to enter the house, the creature gazes into the camera to witness his immortality there. But he is dissappointed. He throws the camera aside and expires in the sunlight.  Malcovic exults,  ""and finally you must turn to meet the sun, the death of centuries. Moonchaser, monkey, blasphemer, vase of prehistory, finally to earth and finally born.""
 Suddenly the story of all vampires is also exposed to the light of understanding. For this undead, yet forever living creature of darkness, who lives off an endless supply of blood drawn from an artery, is none other than the unborn baby. His existence is none the less precarious, for the supply of blood is not guarrunteed. His greatest desire is for the life blood of the most nubile of women, the perfect child bearer. His deathly paleness is the result of  an inescapable placental failure, as he grows too big and too demanding for the dark space he seeks to inhabit forever. The glorious fullness of the outer world is death to the dark secure timeless world prebirth. Murnau concludes the film. ""Time will no longer be a dark spot on our lungs,""  the price of premature birth.  We now have ""Our very own painting on our very own cave wall. They will no longer be able to say, you would have had to have been there, because the fact is, Alvin, (already killed by the vampire) we were.""
We can remember our births. We can remember life before birth. But it is a dangerous journey. It is truly a heroes journey. But The Shadow of the Vampire's only real hero is the author, who has dared to throw light into the darkest hiding places in our culture.",1002067200,2,6843,4.671107410491257

1421188,2,B00005B6L0,"I guess I was just expecting a lot more out of this movie than I actually got.  The premise of it is a making-of documentary of the movie Nosferatu, but with an extra twist of what it would be like if the actor playing Nosferatu really was a vampire.  I think we were supposed to feel the whole movie or concept was spooky and unsettling.  I'd say up till the last 15 minutes of the movie it was pretty boring and I kept looking up to see how long it would be till it was over.  Some parts seemed very drawn out while a lot of other things were skipped over all together.  Overall the movie is pretty forgettable and I wouldn't feel like I was missing much if I didn't see the movie at all.
I did catch one interesting filming blunder.  At the very end of the movie there is a scene where Greta is lying in bed and notices the vampire doesn't cast a reflection in the mirror and gets scared and they must sedate her.  About 5 minutes later there is a shot with the vampire resting his head on her chest.  You can clearly see the reflection of the back of his head in the mirror! (and its a fairly long , its visible for at least 10-15 seconds).

1421189,4,B00005B6L0,"This is an awesome film looking back on the German vampire classic from the modern perspective. Willem Dafoe, himself a student of the Stanislavsky school in acting pays tribute to both, the acting philosophy he follows in real life and the great vampire character of the movie classic. Simply put, Stanislavsky method of acting states that you have to experience life as a character you portray in order to bring realism into your acting, so if you gonna play a grunt in a war movie, it would help to don the uniform and go on a few military exercises and live in the barracks for a few days.
  The film itself does a good job spoofing the theater, aviation, and other fashionable obssessions of the twenties. The bickering scenes of the playwright vs THE DIRECTOR vs actor are hillarious and on the money done by people who love stagecraft and can offer menaingful comments on the subject.

1421191,4,B00005B6L0,"Right from the very first few frames, Shadow of the Vampire is a gripping drama with terrifying characters and very black and sly humour. The film carries itself excellently and goes at a great pace. The script is very careful and clever, and written with ultimate style and sureness for itself. The acting is very impressive with John Malkovich in a good role with a bad accent and Willem Dafoe, giving an almost legendary performance of an updated version vampire we all know too well. Direction and cinematography satisfy, although the moody blackness of the film sometimes darkens it a little too much so we have to look very hard to see what's going on. Kudos to the makeup artists for fantastic face detail with Willem Dafoe's character. The actor is unrecognisable and the makeup is brilliant. The scenes I really loved in this movie were the conversations with Malkovich and Dafoe. They are extremely powerful and the two actors have great chemistry. There is one extremely eerie scene with the two when Malkovich jumps on top of Dafoe and Dafoe's vampire smiles spookily at him, giving us and Malkovich's character the ultimate creeps. That scene will definitely send a chill down your spine. I also enjoyed the scenes when the crew was shooting Nosferatu, and Eddie Izzard's quiet large cameo. I recommend this movie mostly for people who have seen Nosferatu and really appreciate films and don't mind the odd boring bits. I'll admit sometimes I was a bit slouched from the uninteresting parts, but the film has highly entertaining and intelligent scenes it totally makes up for it.

1421192,2,B00005B6L0,"'Shadow of the Vampire' was a big disappointment.  Although marketed as a kind of comedy or spoof of obsessive movie-making, it is nothing of the sort, with the exception of the recreations of 'Nosferatu' itself, which are improbable, but amusing.
It fails as a 'Gods and Monsters'-type investigation of a great gay director working in the horror genre, and the tensions between his life and his work, because Murnau, like all the characters here, is given no life, just a few mannerisms and long-winded speeches about obsession and art.
It's not much of a recreation of 20s Berlin (presumably due to budget limitations), or the exigencies of film-making.  As a fantasy about the latter, it is distinctly un-fantastic, replacing Murneau's eerieness  with muffle.
The problem with 'Shadow' is that it wants to be an intellectual film, imposing its themes on the narrative, rather than letting them arise unobtrusively from it.  It wants to make all sorts of connections between vampirism, film-making and stardom, for example showing how the director sucks the life out of his actors to give them a dubious 'undead' immortality in cinematic afterlife.
It assumes that the audience has seen 'Nosferatu' and read Bram Stoker's novel 'Dracula', on which it is based, and so can construct a narrative momentum itself, by ticking off all the mirrored scenes, allusions and recreations.  Certainly, they didn't bother to create any themselves.  By the end, I was baffled and frustrated, ignorant as what I was supposed to be watching.
On the positive side, when my local cinema showed this, it provoked such interest that accompanying screenings of Murnau's film were packed.  Which can only be a good thing.",999648000,3,1701,5.11913357400722

1421194,4,B00005B6L0,"There are enough other reviews that I do not have to comment on the action in the film. I would like, however, to give my impressions. The film is busty at the beginning and finishes with nice rounded hips at the end. The middle, however, is lacking. It is unnaturally skinny like a too corsetted waist.
The beginning of this film is almost magical. We are taken to 1922 to the filming of one of the best silent films ever made. The camera work and dark lighting blend with a well written script to transport the viewer to actually sitting on the set with one of the early masters of film. Mystery, intrique, and suspense are thick. What evil lies with the mystery member of the cast? This magical mastery continues up until the second third of the film. At this point, after we see a member of the film crew get eaten on the staged ship, it appears that director Merhige ran out of budget/time/imagination. In order to show the progression of the Marnau's film making, we are subjected to a series of harsh jump-cuts. These cuts are disjointed and not clearly linked to the rest of the action. I so very much wish we could see what ended up on the cutting room floor. I think this story could have been much richer had there been a bit more continuity in the middle.
Despite what some other reviewiers had to say, I liked the ending. It is a nice rounded ending that brings us back to Marnau's obsession/insanity. We are returned to another progression of suspense in these last few scenes. The film starts making sense again and there is once again motivation for the action. We are left to think on the plausibility of what just took place. Did things really happen that way? There is no way to prove it didn't!
I wish I could leave just thinking on this question. But instead, I find myself wondering what happened in the middle of the film? What other character dimensions am I missing because of the horrible story telling in the middle? Can this film be repaired to make it the masterpiece that it should be? <sigh> What a waste.",999043200,3,2036,4.461126005361931
1421195,2,B00005B6L0,"I had high hopes going in to SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE.  Willem Dafoe's Oscar-nominated performance looked like it would be a lot of fun, and the idea behind the movie (a movie director making a pact with a vampire) seemed to be something I would relish as both a movie fan and a fan of the vampire genre.
Alas, Merhige's SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE is a slight, only occasionally successful movie full of characters that are only partially drawn.  John Malkovich's F.W. Murnau is barely fleshed out at all, and his scenes with Dafoe's Max Schreck often seem to only consist of him yelling at his star to stop killing the film crew.
The movie starts well (extremely well), with Merhige setting up his situation by keeping Shreck off-screen until just the right moment.  But once Shreck is there and the joke is played out, there's not much left for the movie to do.  And the structure falls apart completely.  Scenes seem to be disjointed, having no connection with the movie as a whole.  Events happen with absolutely no setup, and we are often left to wonder how we got from point A to point C without any B to lead the way.  It makes me wonder if perhaps production problems or post-production editing got in the way.
Dafoe is truly delicious as Shreck and stands out above the otherwise forgettable cast (including comedian Eddie Grizzard, who has very little fun in his role as Nosferatu's romantic lead).  Dafoe has fun in his role as a vampire-turned-actor, but again, he is hampered by a screenplay structure that leaves his character in the shadows.
One scene truly is a standout and shows the potential of what the movie could have been.  Nosferatu's producers are sitting on the set downing a bottle of schnapps, when Schreck happens by.  He joins them for a drink as they question him (they think jokingly, but he thinks seriously) about what it's like to be a vampire.  In this one scene, we see the mistaken-identity possibility that Merhige seems to want to set up.  But more importantly, we see the pain and desperation that has led a once noble vampire to take a job as an actor.  The scene plays out beautifully, but then the movie rushes forward to confusing and unsatisfying conclusion.
SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE leaves many funny and even thought-provoking possibilities left unexplored.  It's a shame that Dafoe's bravura performance (and the incredible make-up job he sports) are lost in this minor effort.",998265600,3,2413,4.714285714285714
1421196,3,B00005B6L0,"What kind of a man would be so driven that he would make a pact with a real vampire and then sacrifice human beings to the fulfilment of his artistic vision? Well, the makers of Shadows exquisitely meander around this question but, sadly, fail to expand the scope of the movie to answer it.  And even sadder is that answering this question, or at least providing the clues, the evidence, the little snippets of F.W. Murnau's life, would have made richer a movie that for the most part is a concept and not a full-fledged exploration.  The filmmakers had one of two options with the way with movies go nowadays- either turn this into a horror story, a slight more novel and innovative take on the vampire genre, or make an intelligent movie about the ambitions of a man.  The result falls somewhere in the middle.  This is an intelligent, artistic movie, no doubt, but the very severity of its plot screams out for an exploration of the man who is at its center.  The one glimpse into Murnau's personal life comes very early on and is very vague.  I guess they were trying to avoid a 'gay movie' label by evincing Murnau's homosexuality- useless, the people who won't see this because its got a gay protagonist would also probably not see it because it's artistic.  Beyond what is a unique and novel plot, Shadows also had a very interesting real-life person in Murnau, a glitzy period in history, and a unique supporting cast of characters, to delve into.  Sadly, Shadows doesn't go beyond the setup. Murnau, who finally got some recognition recently in the novel Nosferatu, is once more nudged into the shadows of a monster less complex than the demons that troubled him.

I was not dissapointed in the least.  As being a horror movie fan, it is nice to see a new yet old twist on the vampire legend.  John Malkovich plays the German Movie Director F.W. Murnau, who has a dream of making this movie stand out above all others and nothing will get in his way, he definitely ""sold his soul to the devil"" for that.
Willem Defoe portrays Max Schreck, the Vampire.  It is not hard to see why Defoe was nominated for being best actor when this came out.  It is hard to see any resemblence of Defoe in this character.  In this movie, Schreck is a real vampire.  The original Schreck in ""Nosferatu"" was quite scary enough, but Defoe adds more to this character.
The supporting cast is also excellent, the locations are beautiful, the soundtrack enhances the film.  The plot is intelligent, and maybe has a tongue in cheek shots at the Hollywood establishment as well.  I just wonder how many movie directors would be like Murnau in this movie and sacrifice and sell their morals for the ""sake"" of making a great movie?  Maybe that is a question that we would not want to know....
Overall an excellent movie that I highly recommend!",996278400,,1304,4.414225941422594

Of course, Schreck is a real vampire -- he is immortal and he thrives on the blood of mortals. Murnu seeks immortality through the movies and he too is prepared to allow innocent blood to be shed for the sake of his art. ""Shadow of the Vampire"", which is  about the making of the silent German classic ""Nosferatu"", is genuinely creepy thanks to great performances by Wilem Dafoe as Count Orlock and John Malkovich as Murnau.

1421202,4,B00005B6L0,"Although this movie is not without its flaws, there is definately enough good stuff in it to make sure it is an experience you will long remember.  The initial premise is that the director of the classic vampire movie Nosferatu (Played by John Malkovich) was so obsessed with his art that he decided to cast an actual vampire in the title role of his film rather than even attempt to look for an actor.  This rather clever idea is utilized brilliantly, as the specific details of the director and vampire's arrangement are hinted at but never directly revealed.  You can pretty clearly infer that Malkovich's character has promised his beautiful leading lady to the deranged Nosferatu (played by Willem Defoe) but the question of whether the director intends to  honor his agreement with Nosferatu from the beginning or whether Nosferatu is stupid enough to be fooled by him in the first place is never entirely explored.  One of the main strengths of the film is how much is left unsaid, especially with the bizzare Nosferatu.  Willem Defoe is sublime in a performance that perfectly mimics the previous screen appearance of the legendary vampire.  He does not really bring anything new to the character (which is obviously a director's decision) so it is more appropriately labeled imitation than acting, but the performance, within the limited boundaries that have been set, is spectacular.  Even with only a cursory knowledge of the original Nosferatu, there is plenty to enjoy, but with a good understanding of the original, the intended satire and comedy comes across quite effectively.  The only problems I had worked hand in hand with the strengths.  It would have been nice to see more of Nosferatu, but too much information steals the audiences ability to engage their own imagination.  One glaring flaw came with the editing, there were quite a few disruptive cuts that left me confused and you can almost get the sugestion of a few sub-plots that have been essentially cut out (Malkovich's character's ... addiction for example).  All in all, however, this is an extremely entertaining movie, especially for film buffs who like the original Nosferatu.  It pays homage to the classic rather than drifts along on its coattails, and there is definately a lot of love involved with the production and the script.",994636800,,2320,4.979274611398964
1421203,3,B00005B6L0,"""Shadow of the Vampire"" is a cute, fictionalized story about the making of F. W. Murnau's silent classic ""Nosferatu - A Symphony of Horror"" (German, 1922). The premiss of ""Shadow..."" is that Murnau, in his quest for ultimate realism, hires a real vampire to play the part of an actor (named Max Schreck) playing the part of the vampire. The fact that the real Max Schreck, who played the vampire in the original silent film, was always in character and makup during the entire 1922 production makes the premiss of ""Shadow..."" that much more plausible (if you consider a real vampire to be plausible). On the whole, ""Shadow..."" works very nicely. The period cars, trains, costumes and scenery are right on, and the actors certainly do a commendable job, especially Willem Dafoe, who plays Max Schreck. The down side is that in order to fully understand and appreciate this movie, you really should see the original silent ""Nosferatu"" first. Therein lies the rub. In my book, the original is a five star classic (and my favorite silent movie), and it's difficult not to compare the two. However, it is still very enjoyable and certainly worth seeing.",994464000,,1148,4.862244897959184

The reason was that there was little to none character development among the main players.  Not once is Murnau's background discussed.  Also skimmed over is any information about Max Shrek.  Now I understand that this was part of the mystique of the film, but surely some shred of information could have been provided by Murnau.  The film maintains a sluggish pace until the end which builds up to a shocking climax. Malkovich and Dafoe turn in stellar performances, but Dafoe's role is limited and should have been given more screen time.  John Malkovich continues to be one of the world's best actors and I'm convinced that any film he is a part of is well worth watching.  Recommended",993686400,,794,4.924812030075188
1421206,4,B00005B6L0,"Being a silent-film fan, I was pleased when it was announced that a sort of ""spoof"" on the making of the classic ""Nosveratu"" was being released.  I loved the original and consider it a masterpiece, but after watching this film, I have to admit that I'm stumped for words in describing ""Shadow of the Vampire,"" but will try.
For those of you who've lived under a rock and never heard of ""Nosveratu"" it was basically a German film that lifted the storyline literally and illegally from Dracula because the widow of Stoker wouldn't release it to them.  So, if you basically know the story of Dracula, you have ""Nosveratu.""
This movie is based on the making of the movie, complete with more profiling on the actors, workers and the infamous director himself, Murnau.  Murnau wants so badly to make his film realistic, that he manages to lure a real vampire, known as Max Schrek, into playing his lead and the problems begin. (In order not to reveal any spoilers, I'm leaving the details here.)
Otherwise, I have to say that Willem Dafoe as Max is just stunning.  He is completely unrecognizable and absolutely brilliant, right down to the mannerisms and details of his ""eating habits"" (okay, I gave you one,) as well as taking the original Max Schrek and giving him a personality.  Why he was passed up for an Oscar is beyond me because he blew Crowe out of the water.  He most definitely should have gotten best actor for in this role you completely forget that it's Willem Dafoe unless you have a DVD and watch the interviews -- it's shocking.
The movie tries very, very hard to stick to details and the time period in order to seem authentic.  This includes the grainy film.  In fact, I read that real snippets of the film were kind of pasted in here and there and honestly I could not tell the difference.  Artistically, it was beautifully done.
Now the story in a whole: weird.  The trailer does a disservice by insinuating that it is a comedy by really focusing on one particular scene where Murnau is yelling at the vampire for satisfying his appetite on his cameraman and asks why not the script girl, to which Max thinks about it for a second and takes it as a suggestion and happily replies:  ""Oh, the script girl.  She's next.""
One funny scene in one movie does not make a comedy, to which the trailer ruined this for me.  I guess I went into this expecting Malkovich's ""Being John Malkovich"" type of sense of humor.  It isn't like that at all.  Of course, there are other mildly funny scenes, but most of the time it's a bit of everything.  It's more dramatic, a touch of horror, a moment of gore and a bit of tragedy with a few comedic moments dabbed here and there.  Beautifully mixed -- but that's all of it without the ending.
The ending is what really threw me.  Whereas the whole movie could have actually been believable (and leaned towards it), the ending is so outrageous, so bizarre that I found myself stunned at what I thought was a magnificent masterpiece only to turn around and somewhat become a horror-movie ending.  The brilliant part would be it ties into the ending of the actual movie, but it just was so weird I couldn't swallow it.  It kind of made me feel the same way I did after ""Mary Reilly"" (Yeah, I know I'm quoting Malkovich movies, but he kind of sticks to a specific oddball genre and the comparison works... sort of.)
So what on earth is my recommendation?  Alright here goes:  If you're a Nosveratu fan in general, I think you'll like it.  As oddball a picture as this is, it is brilliantly played, designed and acted that it is somewhat believable.  You should enjoy it.
If you're not familiar with Nosveratu, I recommend you see the movie before this one.  Mostly because you'll have a good understanding of the work that went into this film and not only will you have an appreciation for silent films, but you'll truly love the tremendous effort made to branch the two of these films together.
If you're just looking for a ""fun movie"" for a Saturday night, this is a pretty highbrow flick for just kicking back with some beer; it's pretty deep, but, you might get a kick out of it.  You'll probably be pretty quiet towards the end like we were.
If you're a vampire fan looking for more to add to your vampire movie collection, you'll like this tremendously.  They truly play up the Nosveratu image, gore and all.
Four stars for drama, period and acting.  Left out one for script.  I still feel that it could have been done better than it was, but don't let me dissuade you from renting this.  If you want to expand your horizons in genre of movies, I recommend it.",993686400,3,4608,4.503605769230769
1421207,4,B00005B6L0,"Of course, there are some similarities between ""Shadow of the Vampire"" and ""Ed Wood."" Both movies deal with unorthodox film directors, both feature a film about the making of a film, both have starring actors (John Malkovich and Johnny Depp, respectively) whose eclectic role choices are legendary, and both have actors who received Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor.
However, wherein Martin Landau won for his role as Bela Lugosi in ""Wood,"" Willem Defoe did not. And there lies the injustice. For Defoe is superb as Max Schreck/Nosferatu, the ""actor"" who is more than adequate for his role. Not only does Dafoe submerge himself into character but he makes the viewer feel that he indeed is one of the undead. His mannerisms, slithers, and vocal delivery are stunning.

Along with this creepy night out, is a creepy character who is played by a very creepy Willem Dafoe.  While I do think he is one of the better actors around, he's always had a sort of odd way about him.  He's not conventionally good looking at all, but can he act!!! And as Max Schrek he is amazing!!! I did see the original Nosferatu on video a few years ago, and Dafoe looks exactly like him in the movie and captures the whole aura of the actor that played him.  That's what really creeped me out, and he has these long claw like nails to go along with the 'vampire' make-up.  At first I just thought this movie was going to be like the making of nosferatu, I didn't realize they were satirizing it and making him out to be a real vampire.  It's an excellent hook, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I can't say enough good things about Dafoe's performance.  It's just mind blowing.  He should have gotten the Oscar!  To think he lost it to Benico Del Torro, in Traffic!  While he is a good actor, I don't think he was anywhere near as amazing as Dafoe.  John Malkovich is amazing as the director of the film.  I think he must get controlled by Max Schrek.  some of his behavior seems so outlandish, and he gives the end of the film an element that just makes you really keep thinking about the movie long after it's over.

1421214,2,B00005B6L0,"This film is basically a retread through the making of FW Murnau's 1922 masterpiece Nosferatu - eine Symphonie des Grauens. Basically it tells the fictitious tale of how Murnau hires Max Schreck (who will not appear out of make-up and costume) and tries to confuse us or merely blur our perceptions of whether or not Max was in fact a brilliant character actor or a real vampire. Ludicrous, but it could have worked. Unfortunately I do not think it has, I think the film is a lacklustre bore. Murnau's classic vampire movie, though not his best film remains one of the most poetic of all horror films. I think Willem Dafoe in Shadow captures the feel of Schreck, I also feel that his acting is superbly understated given the camp performance he could have gone for instead. Whilst the original film is a film that survives repeated viewings, I would never wish to see Shadow of the Vampire again. It really was dull, I became aware of the way the director has tried to delay the predictable and inevitable finale. So to wrap up I'd say that the idea behind the film was ludicrous but could have actually been a lot of fun and could have worked, I do not think that Shadow of the Vampire uses the potential of the story, which could have been an exciting movie with a darkly suspenseful set of sequences, instead we get a slowly moving movie that has very little to offer. John Malkovich also stars but just does angry again, which we have seen numerous times before in film such as In the Line of Fire and Con Air. John just seems to give pretty much the same performance in a number of films, which is a shame. Willem Dafoe on the other hand who I have always considered a good actor, but never anything really special delivers a quite remarkable performance from behind the heavy make up.

What a bizarre concept!  I thought this film would be funny - and it was - but it also made my skin crawl.  Malkovich as Murnau was a soft-voiced madman, totally unconcerned with the loss of his crew, except as it affected his ability to complete the project.
There was a lot going on here - the homage to the original classic, the ""behind the scenes"" look at how the film would have been made, had it starred an actual vampire (!), and Murnau's efforts to work around the foibles of his increasingly petulant ""star.""

However, I started ROTFLMAO and it occurred to him, ""Hey, this is funny.""  Yes, this film is absolutely hilarious and it is more about the lengths people will go for their passions and needs than it is about vampires.  John Malkovich plays filmmaker Murnau making the original ""Nosferatu"" back in the '20s, a silent film.  Willem Dafoe plays the lead actor Max Schreck, who is actually a vampire hired by Murnau to play the part as the ultimate touch of authenticity for his film. Murnau only has his film on his mind.  He will and does do anything for it.  Schreck only has feasting on blood on his mind, both cast and crew's but ultimately the leading lady as the piece de resistance.

The cast and crew, in turn, are so used to being around crazed artistic types that Schreck's insisting on remaining ""in character"" and only shooting at night and in ""full costume"" strikes them as his ""sacrifice"" for his acting craft!  Willem Dafoe is absolutely fabulous, as usual, and certainly deserved his long overdue best actor Oscar nomination.  Malkovich does his usual solid job but the role isn't that different from his other roles. This film reminds me of ""Barton Fink"" and ""The Muse,"" which also covered the far out behavior of creative artists and the prices they are willing to pay.  What makes all three so good is that they are not exaggerations in the slightest.  Doubt my word?  Check into a live-in summer art studio course for several weeks and you'll come home knowing no exaggeration is necessary.  The DVD has some fascinating extras on it including Dafoe getting made up for the role.

I adore Willem Dafoe and am always riveted by John Malkovich.  The film co-starred the insanely brilliant Eddie Izzard, as well as Udo Keir, Ronan Vibert and Cary Elwes, all of whom did their best with what they had to work with.  SotV is beautiful to watch, the idea fascinating.  So what went wrong?  Why, in the end did it remain so uninvolving?
In spite of performances which are almost universally wonderful - even brilliant in some cases - character development is, at best, heavy-handed.  In some cases, it's non-existent; poor Cary Elwes has so little to do it's almost embarrassing.  The pacing and editing all serve to create a kind of silent film within a talkie atmosphere which never quite works.  We listen for story clues that are not found in the dialogue, look for them in the visual shorthand which is as strange as it is unexpected, and the tension between the two flattens this film pretty comprehensively.
Perhaps this requires more than one viewing, I don't know.  I just know that as much as I looked forward to it, I found it impossible to love this film.  And given the talent and the ideas here, that's just a pity.",992131200,7,1290,4.593886462882096
1421220,4,B00005B6L0,"Early on in ""Shadow of the Vampire,"" when director F. W. Murnau (John Malkovich) tells the cast and crew of his 1922 horror classic ""Nosferatu"" that he has hired unknown actor Max Schreck to play Count Orlock, he explains that Schreck has been studying with Stanislavski in Russia and is one of those actors who gets subsumed by his role.  This is an intriguing enough conceit, but Steven Katz's script takes this film's conceit a bit further by having ""Schreck"" turn out to be a real vampire.  This explains not only the need to shoot all of his scenes at night but also why he keeps attacking crew members, biting their necks and drinking their blood.  The producer (Udo Kier), the writer (Aden Gillett), the new cameraman (Cary Elwes) and the film's star (Eddie Izzard) are getting increasingly nervous about people dying while making this film, but Murnau is totally consumed with getting his vision immortalized on celluloid.  Since he would be willing to make a deal with the Devil to do so, coming to an arrangement with a vampire with regards to the life's blood of his leading lady (Catherine McCormack) is a relatively trivial matter.
""Shadow of the Vampire"" has an obvious affection for the way in which silent movies were made, and key sequences of the film emulate the style of the time (shot in black & white, iris in & iris out, etc.).  Both Schreck and Murnau are interested in immortality, albeit of different sorts, and it is not surprising that by the end of the film there is the question of which character is the real monster is quite debatable.  Dafoe's performance as the title character was certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination, one of those grand disappearances beneath the make-up reminiscent of John Hurt in ""The Elephant Man.""  Malkovich is at the stage in his career where it is difficult to notice how good he is because of how good he is (he improvised a lot of the dialogue during the final scene).  Producer Nicholas Cage certainly deserves credit for getting E. Elias Merhige to direct another film.  It had been almost a decade since Merhige wrote and directed ""Begotten,"" and he was threatening to become the J. D. Salinger of contemporary American cinema.  ""Shadow of the Vampire"" is destined to become a beloved little horror film, if not a cult classic.
Given the subject matter, the DVD extras are pretty sparse this time around.  Merhige does the audio commentary alone and there are brief interviews with him, Dafoe and Cage.  However, the featurette is standard Hollywood fare when what I was really expecting was a documentary-style look at the original ""Nosferatu"" with film historians or horror writers holding forth on its greatness.  While having seen the original ""Nosferatu"" is not necessary to understanding ""Shadow of the Vampire,"" it certainly would enhance your enjoyment of this film, and since ""Shadow"" is only 93 minutes long, you can easily do a double feature on a Friday night when the moon is full.

Dafoe put on one of the finest performances I had ever seen.  The expressions and the finger nail clicking were humorous but at the same time disturbing.
Malkovich was over the top in a good way.  That's the only way he should act because nobody else can do it the way he can.  Cary Elwes sweetened the deal too.  I was looking for Nicholas Cage (the producer) to make a cameo, but there was no room for that in a, as some reviewers say, ""non-Hollywood movie.""  F.W.

1421224,4,B00005B6L0,"In 1922, German film director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, directed an unlicensed screen adaptation of Bram Stoker's classical horror novel, DRACULA. The film was NOSFERATU. It featured actor Max Shreck (and with such a name what else can you star in besides horror films?) as the eerie Count Orlock (a.k.a. Vlad Tepes Dracula), Greta Schrder as Ellen Hutter (a.k.a. Wilhelmina Murray) and Alexander Granach as Makler Knock (a.k.a. Jonathan Harker). The shooting of the film is apparently shrouded in much mystery, with people disappearing from the set, and this sets up the premise for SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE, a fictional film about the making of - fans will argue - the best film version of the well known story of Dracula.
John Malkovich stars as the eccentric film director F. W. Murnau, who in his quest for absolute realism in his work has gone to the length of hiring a real life vampire, Max Shreck, as the role of Count Orlock, who has been promised the lovely Greta Schrder as a ""fee"" for starring in the film. It may all sound ridiculous, but it works out great. Willem Dafoe stars as Max Shreck, and boy... what a performance! He *is* Max Shreck. It's a complete transformation. You basically can't tell the original Shreck from the Dafoe variety. Some of the scenes from the original has been reconstructed down to the tiniest detail, and it's an amazing result. And we're not just talking about external resemblance here. With just a fixed gaze, Willem Dafoe manages to bring back the eerie feel that the original Max Shreck gave the Count Orlock character.
So is it a must to have seen the original NOSFERATU in order to fully enjoy this film? Well, of course, I can only speculate on this question, for I know not what it is like to see SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE without having seen the original Murnau film, but I would assume that some of the thrill is lost if you have no knowledge of NOSFERATU. Because it must be said that SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE is a rather peculiar film which seems tough to label. You can't really call it a horror film for it's not especially scary. It may be perceived as a black comedy, but also this label seems a bit off. So part of the fun of watching the film, besides getting great performances from Malkovich and Dafoe (the other cast members, for instance Cary Elwes and Udo Kier, also deserves credit), was comparing the film with NOSFERATU. But if you have seen Murnau's ""symphony of horror"" (and enjoyed it) and have a taste for films that don't follow the standard Hollywood formulae, then I would probably label this film with the only label that seems fit, ""a must see"".",991785600,6,2617,4.642241379310345
1421225,5,B00005B6L0,"As I read and write reviews I realize that their really is no point to them. Everyone has such varying opinions, one person can love a film and another person hates it just as much. But I've already written too many reviews to stop now, so I too will add my opinion to the pile, and remember that the best way to know if you might agree with someone is to read some of their other reviews and see just how often you agree with them. Now, on to Shadow of a Vampire.  When I first saw a preview for this film on television, I was instantly excited! There are not enough horror films being made latley that don't involve aliens! I'm sorry, but I prefer classic horror, and not alien or slasher stuff! And when it comes to vampires, most of the time little effort is put into the story ideas. Here is a wonderful exception! The story here is truly engaging! The idea of taking a real situation, the filming of an actual, existing film, and throwing in a case of the supernatural, is a welcome change from the two usual vampire storylines: reviving Dracula or erotic vampires. Anyway, it was not easy for me to find this movie at one of the local theaters. First I had to wait a long time past the release date! Finally I found it, and while it wasn't quite what I was expecting, it was still wonderful. Before seeing it, movie trailers and the internet had me thinking that it was a film that would not reveal whether or not Shreck was an actual vampire until the end, if at all. This was not the case however. It is not long after Shreck's appearance that we learn the truth. This perhaps would have added an interesting element to the movie, but never the less, it was still one of the best vampire movies ever made so far. The portrayal of the vampire is extremely real. All of the acting of course is wonderful. The film seems short, although I have not checked the running time, but frankly I'm glad of that. I've grown weary of these 3 hour theatrical bombs that have been coming out lately, that are nothing more than the film industry's equivalant of boy bands. This movie, in all its briefness, makes its' point, and does it beautifully! John Malkovich is brilliant as usual, and Willem Defoe was equally stunning. There were laughs, but it never, not even in previews, appeared to be a comedy to me. I was surprised to see that statement from one reviewer. I was expecting a psychological horror film, and while it wasn't set up the way I thought it was going to be, I still got what I expected. The real horror in this film was the madness of humans, not necessarily the bloodlust of vampires. There were so many clever and subtle hints to nazi-ism throughout the film too. While this movie could have been a tad more clever, it was still very clever! Now, I'm not saying the vampire is all out scary. This movie is mainly horrifying in a disturbing sense. It sticks with you. It's wonderful though, definitely among the best movies of the year, and a welcome new addition to my DVD collection.",991612800,,3001,4.39748201438849

1421231,5,B00005B6L0,"SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE is an amazing film. It operates on three separate levels. On one level it is a story of a filmmaker, F.W. Murnau (John Malkovich), obsessed with his own ambition and vision. He is remaking the Dracula legend, changing the name of the vampire to Count Orlock. His film will be called 'Nosferatu'. He has hired the 'ultimate method actor' named Max Schreck to play his vampire. Schreck is said to get into character and stay there, only wanting to be filmed at night and only responding to the name 'Count Orlock'. But as filming progresses, the truth becomes clearer and clearer... Schreck really IS a vampire, agreeing to star in Murnau's film in exchange for the chance to dine on the leading lady. It's a delicious concept, even more so after you've seen the classic, silent original. It's easier to believe that Schreck was some kind of monster then it was to believe he was simply an actor in makeup. That's how effective Schreck's performance in the 1922 German film is. The second level of the film is more familiar. It is a horror film. It has all the elements of a vampire film and it acts on all of them, actually reaching a degree of creepiness that you wouldn't expect from a film this (excuse the phrase) 'artsy'. And finally, SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE is a seething satire, one where the lead actor cannabalizes the cast and crew to get what he wants and the director is so focused on his vision that he ignores the fact that the people around him are falling ill, they are merely meat puppets (Hitchcock and Kubrick would have been proud). This is a fun little film, with aspirations towards greatness that it all but reaches. The production design and brilliant cinematography allow for an accurate reproduction of the settings of the 1922 film. So dead-on, in fact, that when actual footage of the silent film is inserted into the film, we can't tell the difference. Director E. Elias Merhige work beautifully with an amazing casy which includes Malkovich, Udo Kier (of 'Andy Warhol's Dracula' fame). Eddie Izzard, Catherine McCormack, Cary Elwes, and Aden Gillett. But the real star here is Willem Dafoe, whose performance of Max Schreck as long suffering and desperate monster is so accutely creepy and inventive that it'll make your skin crawl.",991267200,31,2281,4.748110831234257
1421232,4,B00005B6L0,"Certainly an interesting (and surprisingly intelligent) movie for the vampire genre.  The actors were brilliant; particularly an almost unrecognizable Willem Dafoe as the vampire Count Orlock, or Max Shreck (it's worth it to watch him, if nothing else).  He certainly does portray a decrepit, aging vampire who is at once both pitiable and powerful.  He is a shadow of what once was; a remnant of a gothic, old world.
One of the best scenes is the vampire's (Dafoe) conversation with a furious Murnau (played by John Malkovich), who is the director of his movie ""Nosferatu.""  Malkovich is delightfully explosive as an obsessed, selfish,..director who will stop at nothing at producing ""memories"" on film.  He is both a laughable and frightening figure; particularly when he shows the viewer what lengths he will indeed go to make his picture.
The movie, however, is brief and doesn't really bother going into the depths it really could have.  The only things that really save it from being completely shallow and boring are the actors themselves, who use what little time they have to bring the thin story to life.  Another great thing that makes it a good movie is the way it draws from the movie (""Nosferatu"") it revolves around.  The blending of the classic black and white with color brings the viewer back into the gothic realm of a time gone by.  Watching the characters as they film their movie creates an almost surreal atmosphere, making the watcher almost wonder which is the real world and which isn't.
All in all, a fitting tribute to both the vampire world and the film it honors.  It's brief and at times vague; but the actors and the clever blending of new and old makes it a movie worth remembering.",991180800,5,1715,4.802721088435374

We see a very lonely, miserable vampire that has seen the centuries drag on until he is confronted with playing this roll in Murnau's creepy classic, Nosferatu.  The last scene of the movie is one of the most uncomfortable things I've ever seen.  Murnau's attempt to capture as much realism as he can makes the entire audience shift in their seats.

It is not a very serious movie but can be frightening at times.  Its not aimed at the usual audience so its more complex not simplistic.  I think Willem Dafoe should have won becaus his movie was more dialogue and he had to do the makeup and be a lot out of character.  Benicio Del Toro probably already knew spanish so what if he learned some.  They don't understand what he is saying how do they know how he is acting.  As for John Malkovich he was great as usual and his best role since Dangerous Liasons.  He was ecstatic as the great director Murnau and he makes him so obsessive.  This is definately worth buying and the special features are better than most.  I always love the commentary.  They really did a god job making a plot of the rumor that Shrek was actually a vampire nd thats why he played Orlock so well and just maybe they are right. I love how they make the germens drugges and how they just let people die.  They did a brilliant job showing how to film nosferatu in the 20's and I thought it was intersting.

1421238,5,B00005B6L0,"About 35 years ago, I read an interview with Christopher Lee entitled ""The Loneliness of Evil"", in which Mr. Lee discussed the element of loneliness that he wanted to bring to his screen characterization of Dracula. I think that could also apply with great veracity to Willem Dafoe's remarkable performance in Elias Merhige's ""Shadow of the Vampire"", an extremely entertaining and unease-provoking fantasia about the making of Murnau's vampire classic ""Nosferatu."" Mr. Dafoe, who I feel was cheated out of an Oscar, gives a multifaceted, tour-de-force performance as ""Max Schreck"", probably the most brilliant bit of ""typecasting"" ever. For those of you who don't know what I'm referring to, the premise of this audacious film is that director Murnau, played by John Malkovich, hires a real vampire to star in his film, unbeknownst to the rest of the cast. Murnau strove for realism in this classic silent film, shooting on location in Czechoslovakia by ruined castles, menacing woods, etc. The fact that his star happens to be the real thing only adds to his vision of cinematic ""truth"". What he doesn't foresee is that his leading man, who is not above having ""star fits"", starts to feed on the cameraman, and, later, the leading lady. This film made me very uneasy, as does ""Nosferatu"". It is duskily photographed, and the period (1920) is lovingly recreated via the costumes, hairdos, even the heavy black-and white makeups of the actors, and, of course, Willem Dafoes's chilling makeup as Schreck. Add to this a darkly beautiful music score and strikingly beautiful, eerie opening titles-images that look like creepy storybook stencils or woodcuts of subjects like St. George and the Dragon, etc. There is also a very subtle, sly, sick sense of humor at work here. When Max Schreck, the demanding star, says to his director, ""I think we do not need the writer any longer"", I laughed out loud in the theater! There is also a very melancholy side to Dafoe's Schreck-a sad loner who has lived a VERY LONG time, and has ""seen it all."" What a mature, intelligent performance! I also have to commend comedian Eddie Izzard for his performance as Gustav Von Wangenheim, the actor who portrayed ""Hutter"" in this film. The man looks truly terrified of his co-star-which, if you've seen ""Nosferatu"", you will find is quite accurate! I don't go to the movies much these days, unless it's something I really want to see-and this film was one of them! And one other touch of brilliance in the film-the name of the train transporting Murnau, his cast and crew into Czechoslovakia is ""Charon"", which is the name of the boatman in Greek mythology who ferries people across the River Styx into the land of the dead-need I say more?",985651200,,2718,4.898047722342733
1421239,5,B00005B6L0,"WOW! What an excellent film. From the beginning art deco intro to the violent climax, this film really worked well. I couldn't believe how well the making of Nosferatu was done in this film. Its amazing. Before going to see the film Shadow of the Vampire, I rented Nosferatu from 1922 for a second time to refresh myself on how the story went and the scenes. The scenes in the movie were almost identical and truely amazing to watch. Defoe mastered the role of Max Schreck who played Nosferatu. He surely should have won the Oscar for best Supporting actor. From his stiff dark pose to his huge evil gazing eyes, Willem Defoe surely steals the show. But let me not forget Malkovich who not only did an excellent job playing the role of F.W. Murnau, but also looked a lot like the original director. Lets just say producer Nicholas Cage was right on the money in producing this film. I give it five stars do to its realistic depiction of the F.W. Murnau classic Nosferatu and because of its witty comedic and spellbinding thriller story. See this movie...but first definitely rent the original F.W. Murnau classic. You will appreciate the film so much more.",985564800,,1156,4.64390243902439
1421240,3,B00005B6L0,"This movie is just not as good as it should have been. Somewhere during the film, the story gets lost in a big way. I understand what they were trying to say with the ending but the film should have built up to it. As it stands, the ending feels very tacked on and is, therefore, unenjoyable for me.
Having said that, there *are* plenty of enjoyable moments in this film. Willem Dafoe is exquisite. His portrayal of Max Shrek is both comic and very moving. It makes me think of a photograph of the real Max (taken during shooting of ""Nosferatu"") sitting on a hillside, looking very alone. If you're at all familiar with comedian Eddie Izzard, you'll love his performance as well. He had me in giggling fits (more often than I should have been, I warrant). John Malkovich is John Malkovich, as always. He's very charismatic so I can't say if I was entranced by his performance or by the man himself. I don't think he can be anything other than brillliant, even though I don't think his role was very well written. I don't feel Murnau's character was properly built up. You're left making too many assumptions. There were several times when I couldn't stop wondering what had been left on the editing room floor, and why? I felt that way quite often actually, and not just in regards to Murnau.
The best parts, for me, came when the crew was filming ""Nosferatu."" Malkovich was most amusing when giving directions to his actors. And it was interesting to watch the actors improvise those moments. But my favourite scene is the one in which Max (Willem) explains to Albin (Udo Kier) & Heinrick (Aden Gillett) why the book ""Dracula"" made him sad. It starts out very funny but quickly becomes very moving. There's quite a bit of that in the film: comedy to tragedy. Those moments kept me interested but left me desperately wanting a much better written/edited film. I can't help but wonder what got left out due to the project running out of filming time. If more attention had been paid, this could have been a masterpiece.",985564800,8,2018,4.577348066298343

John Malkovich, Willem Dafoe, and Eddie Izzard played their roles superbly. Malkovich has the potential of being an excellent actor. Sometimes he playes the role well, other times he seems rather cliche to me. This movie was the ultimate specimen of his talents. He was spellbinding as a filmmaker who would do anything for his art. Willem Dafoe was amazing as Max Schrek. At times he was horrifying, and others, quite amusing. Eddie Izzard, although not as charismatic on the screen, was impressive as the lead actor.
I also have criticisms concerning the end of the film. I agree that it seemed sort of tacked on, however that did not bother me terribly as I found most of the film to be quite enjoyable.
This movie, I must stress, is multifaceted. There are those scary parts and there is dark humor, but it is also a fascinating psychological study and a theory concerning one of the most important pioneering movies.

1421242,4,B00005B6L0,"In 1921, German director F.W. Murnau began the first film adaptation of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" and it soon became, not only one of the most celebrated horror films of all time, but the stuff of which legends are born.  Denied the rights to the book, Murnau merely changed the title to ""Nosferatu,"" Count Dracula became Count ""Orlok,"" and filming began.  ""Shadow of the Vampire,"" directed by E. Elias Merhige, is a chronicle of the making of the film, one which blends fact and fiction and successfully exploits the myth surrounding the entire project.  Fueling the fires of mystery that permeated the set was the fact that method/character actor Max Schreck, who played Count Orlok, was never seen by anyone without his makeup, which gave him a look that was a bit disconcerting to say the least.  And, according to this film, Murnau added to it all by confiding that Schreck was actually a real vampire playing an actor playing a vampire.  In any case, the atmosphere created by Murnau as they filmed ""Nosferatu"" certainly did the trick, as did the dark, unsettling aura created and maintained throughout by Merhige with this film.  John Malkovich does an excellent job of bringing Murnau to life, giving him that sense of someone just slightly off-center; an unusual artist making a decidedly unusual film.  Malkovich's Murnau is a determined and adamant filmmaker who has the ability to stay in the moment, and whose philosophy is that ""Anything beyond the frame doesn't exist.""  An interesting concept from one of the three most highly regarded German filmmakers of the time.  As Schreck/Orlok, Willem Dafoe gives an amazing performance that completely captures the essence of the man and his most famous on-screen character.  Off screen as well, Dafoe applied Schreck's method of only allowing himself to be seen in full make-up by cast and crew as they filmed, and the desired effect is fully realized-- by the other characters, as well as the audience-- in the anticipation of his first appearance in the film, which when it comes is cast in shadows that distort his figure while emphasizing his elongated fingers and nails.  It's quite an image, and does indeed create an indelible impression.  Merhige's approach not only works well, but is brilliant in conception and execution, evoking a dark sense of disquietude while sustaining the enigma of his actor/vampire.  And the B&W rushes of ""Nosferatu,"" as well as the glimpses ""through"" the lens we get as they film it, have an authentic look that further captures that sense of time and place that gives this film credibility and makes it so believable.  Most of the film takes place ""on set,"" or at least in the proximity thereof, and the atmosphere created by Merhige draws you in and makes you a part of it all; it gives you the feeling of actually ""being there.""  The terrific supporting cast includes Cary Elwes (Fritz), Udo Kier (Albin Grau), Eddie Izzard (Gustav), Aden Gillett (Henrick), Ronan Vibert (Wolfgang) and Catherine McCormack (Greta).  Extremely well crafted and presented by Merhige, with a number of memorable performances (especially Dafoe's), ""Shadow of the Vampire"" is a rare treat to be experienced and savored.  It's a dark film, but not depressingly so, delivered with intelligence and just enough humor to offset the drama, as when Schreck at one point says to Murnau, ""I don't think we need the writer anymore.""  A classic line from a film that I am sure will in time be considered a classic in it's own right.  An engrossing behind-the-scenes look at the creative process that makes the magic of the movies a reality, and for film buffs especially, it is one that must not be missed.",984441600,,3673,4.923824959481362

Elias Merhige's first film, Begotten, is one of Nicolas Cage's favorite movies. So when Cage started up his production company and financed his first flick, he called Merhige. He had other reasons, of course, but the rather tenuous connection has caused a number of people who have seen both movies to ask why Merhige came out of semi-retirement (and a lucrative business designing stage sets and directnig creepy videos for Marilyn Manson) to work on a film that's as commercially accessible as Begotten was commercially deadly?
The obvious reason that no one seems to have come up with is that Merhige is one of only two living directors who's made a major silent film, and Mel Brooks would have been inappropriate for the material. The less obvious reason is that Merhige's favorite trope, the long repetition cut, makes itself known in this movie. It's far more subtle than it was in Begotten-- no ten-minute shots of robed figures dragging Son of Earth up a hill in this one. But as in Begotten, there are long, loving shots of landscape (and I use the term loosely; the most noticeable shot like this focuses on different parts of the train for a few minutes) with action going on around them that has nothing, really to do with the landscape whatsoever. The juxtaposition is just out-of-kilter enough to add a veneer of disturbance. With the increased action in this film, the viewer is less compelled to focus on the juxtaposition, and thus less disturbed; but for this film, in the back of the mind is enough.
Much has been made (and very rightly so) of Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Count Orlok, who takes on the persona of character actor Max Schreck through a shady deal with obsessed film director F. W. Murnau (John Malkovich). Dafoe does a fantastic job not only of playing Count Orlok as a vampire who's forced by his own greed into contact with humans he can't kill, but he also takes the silent-film exaggeration of statement and uses it in a sound film. It's unexpected, and it's wonderful. Dafoe is quite deserving of his Best Supporting Actor nomination, but if you're a betting man, remember that Dafoe was overlooked for his two finest roles (in The Last Temptation of Christ and To Live and Die in L.A.).
All the flap over Dafoe's brilliance has unfortunately eclipsed some of the minor performances in the movie which are equally as brilliant, e.g. Udo Kier as the perpetually-stressed producer Albin Grau, Catherine McCormack as the spoiled and bitchy star of the film, Eddie Izzard as her co-star, and Cary Elwes as a replacement cameraman (after the original, played by Ronan Vibert, is sent to the hospital thanks to Orlok's inability to, erm, contain himself) whose arrival on the scene is the catalyst that sets everything in motion.
Elwes' role, and the way his arrival changes the dynamic of the film set, is the one piece of this film that elevates it from an amusing, hyperbolic character sketch of a director who will go to any lengths to get his film and a piece of art. While Elwes himself is about as subtle as a cold chisel to the ear, the effects of his coming are masked by his (and those around him) aping until the final scene, when the true implications of the whole mess come to light. The final scene is so beautifully set up, and so well constructed, that the payoff would have been worth any number of errors. Fortunately, we have very few to contend with, most of which have nothing to do with the film itself (the person who composed the main title credits, for example, should be exiled from Hollywood forevermore).
As a side note, the actual scenes we see Murnau directing are quite close to the scenes in the original. Given the flights of fantasy used in other parts of the film, this is a detail that could have easily been overlooked, but it wasn't. Kudos.
While it's not Begotten-- nothing that's come out since has equaled the artistry and beauty of Begotten-- one can't say by any means that Merhige cound himself in a sophomore slump. To the contrary, the accessibility, the likability, of this film is astonishing, given the endurance-test qualities of Begotten. Very highly recommended. ****",982195200,2,4199,4.745554035567715
1421244,1,B00005B6L0,"I too was greatly looking forward to this one. Though they've had spotty track records, I am in general a fan of both Malkovich and Dafoe. I was especially eager for the kick of Eddie Izzard as a silent-screen male ingenue. But who is this E. Elias Merhige clown?  His first major feature, produced by Nicolas Cage, a great cast and a truly interesting story idea, and he has the temerity ""to treat the script as a staring off point""? Both leads, although gentlemanly in tone, admitted that he didn't have enough experience behind the camera to finish the film on time and on budget.  Even the director stated that he and Malkovich had to sketch out a new ending at the last minute as the production was being closed on them. And watching the movie, all of this shows.  Characters (such as Izzard's) disappear without mention, others die without note from their fellow-characters. Filming of NOSFERATU suddenly jumps from the opening scenes to the final shot with no note of how shooting the rest of the picture went. Poor Willem Dafoe is caught wringing his hands and rolling his eyes and tongue in the comedy that the trailers promise, while everyone else (save a handful of humorous lines) is left in a film that wants to be tense and serious. The only truly interesting aspect of the film is the device of fading from the murky color of reality to the grainy iris-framed black and white of the film-within-a-film (the washed graininess, of course, being as anachronistic as a scene of ancient Rome littered with modern-day ruins would). I was sad but quick to remove this film from my potential top 10 list for 2000. SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE leads the way in erasing the myth that last year was not as bad as everyone says.",981590400,2,1724,4.609120521172638
1421245,4,B00005B6L0,"Like most of John Malkovich movies, there are always more layers than the titles.  This movie really isn't about vampires.  To me, it was about sacrifice, dedication, and the human cruelty is at the same level as the immortals.  To everyone else, you might find something different out of this movie.  But if you were looking for something scary and spooky, you would not like this one.  This is a movie that make you think.
John Malkovich is a great actor as Murnau.  If you like him, you would really enjoy his originality, acting and humor.  The special makeup for Willem Dafoe is fantastic.
This movie is definitely worth seeing.  After all, when was the last time you really thought about the idea, ""the vampire and a movie director are no different""?",980812800,3,756,4.674242424242424
1421246,1,B00005B6L0,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, but was terribly dissapointed.  As other have said, the acting is great, and has some fairly good humor, and comments nicely on what is real vs. illusion.  Unfortunately, the narrative is muddled, scenes are poorly edited, and some lighting is absolutely terrible.  I was easy to forgive these shortcomings, but with ending scene I had lost all hope that this film has any redeeming qualities.  I came away with a grisly impression that I was watching a movie about the making of a snuff film.  The film cheapened the original classic Nosteratu.",980640000,5,588,4.84
