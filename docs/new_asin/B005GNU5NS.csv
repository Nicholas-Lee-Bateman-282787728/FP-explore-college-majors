It is difficult to say you are an expert in American history, if you are unaware of how American history is different in contrast to its closest neighbor and ally to the north. The movie is well-acted and entertaining. It is neat to see what was happening in Canada at the exact time ofand immediately afterthe American Civil War.",1523923200,,427,4.783783783783784
