however, there are some interesting ideas about how to eat well, conveniently, and cook very simply and healthfully.
i cannot imagine these cooking methods yield deliciousness, I think that comes from the store bought sauces [oil free as they may be], which they don't show you, but clearly slather on while consuming the food they've prepared.",1435276800,,461,5.16
8445588,4,B004WQF986,"When this started playing in the DVD player...I thought....What???....and then I realized..these were real people with a real kitchen who were on a plant based diet...exactly what I was wondering...what are some of the quick meals that people eat on a plant based diet?  Interesting to say the least...I don't agree with Beth on corn since 99% of non organic corn is genetically engineered and if one has read commentary on GMO corn one wouldn't be eating it...especially if one had colon cancer...BUT otherwise this is the average ""real life""....quick meals, plant based....family who shops at Walmart occasionally just like me...sooo

Why only 4 stars?  No PDF file was included with recipes although most meals were so simple one doesn't really need recipes...but I would have liked to have that banana blueberry bread recipe... & I am thrilled with those ""veggie rolls and the ""potato chips""..definitely worth the $",1378771200,2,919,5.154362416107382
8445589,5,B004WQF986,I really enjoyed this video from start to finish. I bought it a while ago and liked the meals so much that I have incorporated some of the them into my meal plan. Easy to make. Nice down-to-earth people sharing what really helped them to lose weight.,1340668800,,250,4.340425531914893
8445590,1,B004WQF986,This video was a dissappointment. I thought it would be current exciting recipes. old school. nothing new to offer anyone.  bad purchase on my part,1336521600,2,147,4.88
