3871462,5,B00280W8UA,It is a very interesting story with some sad parts but teaches the value of caring about nature and what God provides for us.,1337385600,3,125,4.25
3871463,5,B00280W8UA,"I got this as a gift for my horseshoer (who loves wolves) as I had seen this on PBS a few years ago.  It's a fascinating heartbreaking story, but also wonderful to hear how this hunter went on to be instrumental in establishing the national park system.  Great story!",1328054400,2,267,4.428571428571429
3871464,5,B00280W8UA,"I originally saw this clip on the National Geographic channel, I believe it was. It is a documentary on the wolves in their habitat and doing what comes naturally to a wolf. It goes into too much detail to relate it all here, but suffice it to say, you will learn a lot about them if you know little or nothing about them. It follows the ""choosing"", I'll call it, of the Alpha male (A-male, the dominant male), the mating of the A-male and the A-female, it even delves into what they are or might be feeling in certain circumstances and situations. I bought this as a Christmas gift for a family member who loves wolves - he's only 3 years old, but he is learning.
The following is copied (without permission) for your benefit. ""In 1893, a bounty hunter named Ernest Thompson Seton journeyed to the untamed canyons of New Mexico on a mission to kill a dangerous outlaw. Feared by ranchers throughout the region, the outlaw wasn't a pistol-packing cowboy or train-robbing bandit. The outlaw was a wolf. Lobo, as locals simply called him, was the legendary leader of a band of cattle-killing wolves that had been terrorizing cattle ranchers and their livestock. It was up to Seton to exterminate this ""super-wolf."" The ensuing battle of wits between wolf and man would spark a real-life wilderness drama, the outcome of which would leave a lasting effect on a new and growing movement in America: wilderness preservation."" It is a very wonderful documentary for adults and children alike.",1324771200,5,1486,4.741312741312742
3871465,5,B00280W8UA,"This is a tale that needs to be told....the white man's not-so-great contribution to the American West....un-fettered decimation of native animal species.  How we wiped out the buffalo, natural prey of the wolf, and brought other live-stock that took their place. When the wolves looked to these new animals for food they were targeted for extinction.  This DVD focuses on one man's obsession to capture a very smart wolf, and in the process is transformed by him. The fate of the wolf brought me to the depths of sadness...for him AND for man's lack of compassion and treatment of other sentient beings. This true story, although sad, finds redemption....you'll have to watch the film!",1286755200,13,686,5.008771929824562
8355464,5,B00280W8UA,A must see for anyone involved with Boy Scouts. Excellent program!,1474761600,,66,5.090909090909091

8355466,5,B00280W8UA,Excellent documentary. I cried and cried and it even moved my students at a maximum prison for men!,1473465600,,99,4.555555555555555
8355467,3,B00280W8UA,"I love wolves, LOVE Ernest Seton Thompson's books and stories about the animals. This dvd, however, is pretty weak, no much beauty or story in it... kind of a waste of money...",1421193600,,176,4.53125
8355468,5,B00280W8UA,It broke my heart!! Wolves they are wonderful animals! I am so shocked that how people can do to them! its so true that wolves paid their life for the crime they didn't commit! STOP hunting and trapping them! I bought a lot of this DVDS to send to friends and family. hope that  I can do something to change people's view about wolves. so sad!!!,1408838400,,345,4.2272727272727275
8355469,5,B00280W8UA,"A fantastic read in history, wolves and a
fantastic person in Ernest Seton who helped
form our national parks, Boy Scouts and
interest in our inviournment.",1407110400,,155,5.0
8355470,5,B00280W8UA,"As a wolf lover, the story, this TRUE story saddened me, but Ernest Thompson Seton completely turned his life around after he
killed ""Blanca"" and they captured and the next day ""Lobo"" died of a broken heart.
The photography is beautiful and interspersed with Doug smith who talks about the Yellowstone wolves. It IS sad what humans have done to wolves, trapping them in cruel traps, poison them, all b/c of the cattle industry and hunting industry.
Wolf are a top predator outside of the ""psychopath man"" and man feels like they must be ""gotten rid of"" bison also, passenger pigeon and so many animals extinct. But after Lobo Mr. Thompsom saw the light, even later founding the boys clubs of America. He went on to I believe spearhead the more recent Save the wolves project although, the lunatics are screaming, again...we have to fight hard to save our brothers and sisters of the animal world Wolves, Horses, prairie dogs, bison all under attack. If anything this film shows how we must speak up for them as they have no voice....so we must be it!",1369180800,3,1050,4.681081081081081
8355471,5,B00280W8UA,"I loved this movie because I love wolves. ALthough towards the end their is a sad part that I was hoping for a different out come. Although their was some good that came from that result. Over all, it still is a good story on the life of wolves. I had no issues with the seller and would purchase again through this company or suggest this company to my friends as well.",1366761600,,370,4.152777777777778
8355472,5,B00280W8UA,Interesting (albeit sad) history on the near-extermination of wolves. It shows that wolves are social creatures who grieve when they lose a loved one just as we do. Also gives history on a naturalist and co-founder of Boy Scouts.,1363564800,,229,4.897435897435898
8355473,4,B00280W8UA,"The subject was intriguing and overall the video is informative, but the production itself is uneven, abruptly weaving in interviews with the historical docu-drama portion of the story.",1361404800,,185,5.642857142857143
