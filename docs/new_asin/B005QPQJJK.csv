8483546,5,B005QPQJJK,"I just received a copy of A Medal for Benny (1945), sold by Amazon.com, package design (c) LTC, Inc.  Having read the jacket art and watched this DVD from beginning to end, here is my two cents, as it were.  Fussy at times... out of focus. This current copy of A Medal for Benny (1945) has less than average black and white transfer production values. Scale of one to ten, where ten is impeccably crisp and clean, I give this copy a four.  Similar to the transfer values of the only available DVD production of Disney's 'Song of the South.'  The Classic Reels and Broadcasts Company, out of Dahlonega, Georgia, DVD with Bonus Features version.  If you can get one.  'Oooh, Criterion Collection.  Pleeease do you magic on this classic.'  Maybe I should sing a song for Disney's Song of the South as well.  On the jacket art of the DVD, J. Carrol Naish is described as ""Benny's volatile Italian papa - ...""  In the actual movie 'A Medal for Benny,' J. Carrol Naish's character, Charley Martin [Latino], is described as 'coming from an old Californian Spanish American family.'  Not Italian!  How could those who wrote the DVD jacket art review of the movie, get the description of A Medal for Benny's Oscar nominated star of the show's character description, so wrong?  Did they even watch the movie?  Maybe my review will clear-up this problem for the future of this classic - A Medal for Benny.",1404950400,4,1394,4.6138211382113825
