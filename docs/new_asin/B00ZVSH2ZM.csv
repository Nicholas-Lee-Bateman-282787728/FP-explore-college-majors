8721031,5,B00ZVSH2ZM,"This Blu-ray review makes relevant reference to the previous DVD version

This is a disc that has been in my collection for several years as a DVD so it is one that has become very familiar. The Blu-ray version, just issued, is an expensive option for those who already own the DVD but, as one who has made that transfer, the gains are evident enough to make it worth considering for collectors. The issue is much easier for first time purchasers.

The deciding factor for many will be to decide how much Barenboim and Rattle rate compared to the many fine alternatives on CDs in terms of the concerto. The coupling will also be an important, but less competitive, issue for thought.

The interpretive situation becomes clear almost from the start with Rattle setting a strong forward pace of some dramatic output. Barenboims first entry immediately sets a slower pace which then slows down even further as Barenboim proceeds to deliver a deeply felt and lyrically focussed interpretation which is expansive rather than explosive. Rattle settles to this approach instantly and delivers a model accompaniment despite the early divergent views.

As an interpretation therefore, this is strikingly different to the more forward deliveries of Fischer and Curzon (both with Szell), Gilels, Friere, Rubinstein and Angelich all of whom have been used as reference points. As an alternative interpretation to those this is completely convincing and, with the visuals switched off, as an audio-only, it works well.

The Schoenberg arrangement of Brahms first Piano quartet is completely engaging and easily enjoyed with much to engage the ear as well as the mind. The finale, taken at a blistering speed, provides for a thrilling conclusion to an outstanding concert. This is a virtuoso delivery by all members of the orchestra.

The source material for this disc is genuine HD. The imaging, very good on DVD, is even clearer on Blu-ray as is the sound. Indeed, heard without visuals, the sound gives this disc a considerable advantage over CD rivals especially when heard in full DTS surround sound. The bird song is there but not unduly disruptive  no more than that experienced by the enthusiastic audience. Such is the quality of the music making that such matters can easily be ignored or treated with good humoured understanding.

This is an excellent disc with two engrossing and compelling accounts well worth collecting",1444694400,,2419,5.060301507537688
