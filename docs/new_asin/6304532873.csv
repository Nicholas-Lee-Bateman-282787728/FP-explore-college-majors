7874483,3,6304532873,I bought this tape because I am a fan of Gabrielle Miller.  She only had one short line and about 30-45 seconds screen time.  I wasn't impressed with the film.,1483401600,,159,4.266666666666667
7874484,5,6304532873,"If you like serious movies, skip this.  But if you appreciate bad movies in all their cheesy glory, own this.  The effects were horrible, there was little way in a plot, but that's why this movie is so bad.  I first saw this movie on television and I was so captivated by the sheer cheesiness of it, I was compelled to own it.  There was a scene in the movie where the director's chair made it into the film.  The lead actor tried his hardest to impersonate Keanu Reeves.  There was a rather effeminate looking man/alien wearing a backless jumpsuit.  The Keanu look a like and Rae Dawn Chong turned themselves into cottonballs for the movie's big love scene.  But the scene that tops all of these is the one where Willie Nelson shoots laser beams from his eyes.  This movie should have been on Mystery Science Theater.  The reaction of Mike Nelson and The Bots' to Willie's Laser Show would have been one of those priceless television moments.",990316800,4,943,4.5266272189349115
7874485,5,6304532873,"Without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen in my life is Starlight.  Starlight is so bad, that it is great.  With some of the most atrocious special effects, an incredibly odd and pointless story line, and tons of  directing flaws, Starlight is a must have.  You will find your self in awe  of the utter stupidity of this flick.  Now, you may ask yourself, ""I  thought that girl was supposed to die if she was on Earth as long as she  was.  Wasn't that lame tattoo on the other side of that guy? Did they turn  into moths at the end? Why the hell is he playing the fiddle? How did the  motorcycle explode? What about her spaceship? What is going on?""  Well, take a deep breath and relax.  It is just a flick, and a terrible one  at that.  Remember, never ask any questions in a flick where Willie Nelson  gains magical powers from a totem pole that allows him to open dimensional  portals.  You must own this movie.  I dare you to find anything worse than  this.",944092800,12,969,4.21978021978022
7874486,5,6304532873,GREAT Sound Design. We have become great fans of Raymond Richards Rewt the sound designer in this film. We understand he normally works as a film composer and are interested in knowing more about him and his work.,936921600,,213,4.631578947368421
7874487,5,6304532873,"This campy video is a lot of fun to watch. The backgrounds are fantastic. It is the story of a half-alien Kieran(Billy Wirth)and an alien Arianna (Rae Dawn Chong) sent down to save her species and of course save Kieran. A  combination of Native American rites, with the help of Grampa (Willie  Nelson), madness, danger, romance, great scenery, very original. A must  have collectible for Billy Wirth and Rae Dawn Chong fans.",936748800,2,424,4.861111111111111
