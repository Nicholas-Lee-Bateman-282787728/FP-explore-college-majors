8063556,1,B0009NCPGA,Great comedian but should never put a DVD together on his own. Didn't even keep the DVD. Waste of money,1360022400,,103,4.2
8063557,3,B0009NCPGA,"This is a pretty OK DVD. Its not the highest quality in editing or A/V but it is still entertaining at the least.  I did not expect much from it being it was made a while ago, but it was good for a few laughs.",1346371200,,209,3.6444444444444444
