3167650,1,B00176X7LK,"Short story: I purchased this DVD but the DVD wasn't even formatted correctly. I tried the DVD on several players and on 3 different computers (Apple & PC) and the DVD never worked. The DVD was bad. I emailed Amazon about this. They told me they were going to send another with the correct formatting for free and well, the whole thing was a disaster. 15 emails later and a lot of confusion and stupidity on the part of the customer service department of Amazon and I still don't have a replacement DVD. Amazon is great when the items are good and correct but their customer service sucks when things go bad.

Don't buy this DVD, unless you want to go through the same nightmarish experience that I went through.",1216512000,10,712,4.476923076923077

8265100,1,B00176X7LK,"Scott was in lousy shape for this ""Son of Hercules"" type movie.  He needed to hit the gym. Fat,hairy....awful",1502841600,,109,4.7368421052631575
8265101,5,B00176X7LK,"BEAST OF BABYLON AGAINST THE SON OF HERCULES opens w/ a prophetic fireball, streaking across the sky. Meanwhile, the eeevil king Balthazar (Piero Lulli) -we know he's the king, due to his Sears Tower-sized crown- has decided that he's not oppressing his people quite harshly enough. This includes his treating the true heir to the throne, shamefully. Enter Hercules / Nippur (Gordon Scott- SAMSON AND THE 7 MIRACLES OF THE WORLD), who quickly finds the opportunity to crush the king's troops w/ a trusty log, rescuing a slave-girl, Tamira (Genevieve Grad!!) in the bargain! Obviously, our humongous hero is on a collision course w/ the king! But first, dancing girls! Ooo-pah! Next, Herc / Nippur infiltrates Babylon, buddying up w/ the king, while wearing a strange assortment of shower curtains, throw rugs, and table cloths. Don't worry, he gets to throw Balthazar's men around, as though he were juggling sword-wielding coconuts! Can Nippurcules deliver the slaves, and allow the heir to take the throne? This burning question is second only to: How does the king stand up w/ that space station on his head? In the meantime, more of the dancing girls! Inka-dinka-doo! It's sort of modern interpretive dance, w/ human sacrifice! Oh no! Hernipules is wounded! By what miracle of the gods can he save everyone, now?? Hurrah! The Persians happen by! It's battle time! But first, Hippurnules must break into the king's dungeon to rescue Tamira. And now... the final battle royal ensues! All while Balthazar has his beard trimmed! Okay, that was just the preliminary battle. The real battle starts... now! And, it's a doozy! Wha?... More of the dancing girls?! Well, alright. Doesn't Balthazar's neck hurt? It must be murder holding that thing up! Hercippules has arrived! Here we go! Clang! Clong! Eeee-aaagh! All of humanity must see this glorious film! That's an order!... P.S.- I dare you to try and get the theme song out of your head!...",1501891200,,1941,5.012383900928793
