8519793,5,B007NXELUM,"Lovingly adapted from a classic German childrens novel, this is a great film to be enjoyed by the whole family, about a seclusive young boy who struggles to unravel the death of his enigmatic girl cousin forty years ago. It's mysterious, suspenseful, spooky, funny and sad, with wonderful actors and beautiful music, and a tinge of nostalgia and melancholy only very rarely found in movies of this kind. Do yourselve a favour and watch it with subtitles. Unforgettable!",1477267200,,469,5.0256410256410255
