7210038,4,B00YAZNBM0,"Pretty good one. There are a lot of scenes that are poorly lit (probably on purpose) where you can't really see what's going on. All the acting was good with the exception of the woman who played ""Kat"" - she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.",1445212800,,248,4.081632653061225
7210039,2,B00YAZNBM0,Unsympathetic characters and obvious plot.,1444953600,,42,7.6
7210040,4,B00YAZNBM0,Solid horror flick that's part psychological with some good gore/ scares to be had.  Bill Oberst is a welcome presence to any horror flick.,1444694400,,139,4.791666666666667
7210041,2,B00YAZNBM0,"badly acted, terribly filmed. mediocre script. there was no real understanding of why the characters were in their situations. the only reason I gave it 2 instead of one star was that it had a couple of twists at the end.",1444608000,,221,4.414634146341464
7210042,1,B00YAZNBM0,Am I missing something? This is so poorly acted and written and PREDICTABLE.,1444608000,,76,4.923076923076923

7210046,5,B00YAZNBM0,This old school thriller kept me on the the edge of my seat throughout the film. It's hard to decide what is real or imagined in the mind of the main character Grafton Torn. If you like psychological thrillers this is one you don't want to miss.,1444348800,,245,4.23404255319149
7210067,5,B00YAZNBM0,"very good movie. Psychological .. what's real, and what's imagined or dreamed line  between is sometimes blurry",1448496000,,111,5.529411764705882

7210070,3,B00YAZNBM0,"The story line was unique and I appreciate that in a movie.  However, only the lead actor was convincing in his part.",1448064000,,117,4.318181818181818
7210071,3,B00YAZNBM0,"Pretty good psychological thriller. No frills, low budget, main character was the only one who could really act. It was okay for free prime movie.",1447977600,,146,4.88

7210075,5,B00YAZNBM0,"I like creepy psychological thrillers and that's what this is.  If you're expecting splashy kills every ten minutes, you probably won't like it, but if you like stories that take their time setting up everything and then throwing some fun twists your way, you'll probably dig it.  It was a bit dark at times, but I was engrossed trying to figure out what was real and what wasn't.  A nice homage to horror films along the way, too.",1446422400,,431,4.5
7210076,1,B00YAZNBM0,""" C "" movie!",1446422400,,12,2.25
7210077,4,B00YAZNBM0,Surprisingly good - this movie probably made on a very low budget is better than many offerings from big producers. Enjoyed the 'noir' atmosphere and unknown actors were surprisingly good. Thanks Amazon Prime for putting this on the list.,1446422400,,238,5.128205128205129

7210085,1,B00YAZNBM0,"Awful movie. Predictable, boring plot, bad acting. Rip-offs from at least 6 classics with an ending straight out of Psycho.
Another chunk of my life that I'll never get back...mislead by bogus ratings. If there was a minus star, I would have chosen that!",1445385600,,254,4.795454545454546
7210086,2,B00YAZNBM0,"Not a 4 star movie, not even a 3 star movie. Really REALLY bad acting and dialogue. Most of the ""scary; scenes are too dark; I couldn't see anything on a macbook except my reflection in the screen. When you see the effects you will turn this off. Pretty sure somebody paid a little extra for those two stars. I personally am offended that I was lured into wasting my time with this movie.",1445299200,,388,4.256756756756757
8717979,1,B00YAZNBM0,"One of the worst movies ever!!!!!  I could only sit through 28 minutes before turning it off.  The acting is TERRIBLE!! It took me completely out of the story.  All of the characters were emotionless, no depth.  I just want to throw up.  As a fellow filmmaker, I am pissed that this got made.  So much potential, and it falls flat on its face.  Why are people loving this!?  Ugh!",1501286400,,379,4.314285714285714
8717980,5,B00YAZNBM0,"Job well done! This is what indy film making is all about! I thought everyone involved did a fine job, an all around good flick.",1496534400,,128,4.16
8717981,1,B00YAZNBM0,"I turned this off half way through; it's a really offensive movie.

They never explain how he became comatose; although it's suggested that lapsing into a coma has a psychological basis which is untrue.
The ""sponge bath"" nurse looks like she's had so much plastic surgery and collagen pumped into her, she'll float away like a helium balloon.

The depiction of the psychiatrist is insulting to that branch of medicine.
She is so inept, it's horrifying and her mode of dress in totally inappropriate; she looks like a bobble head looking for a one nighter or a meal ticket; hardly a role model for the advancement of gender equality.

Even an intelligent layman would recognize that this is a man who is suffering from a severe case of PTSD and perhaps other deep seated psychological issues and should be on some serious medications. I'm sure hypnotherapy is a tricky thing at best and certainly would not be the first and primary approach to an individual with these types of issues.

I loved that scene where she takes him from a happy Christmas memory right into a traumatic recollection of his marital breakup; from one extreme to the next, all in the same breath. Oh yes, a very smart move indeed.....not.",1490227200,2,1210,4.747619047619048
8717982,5,B00YAZNBM0,"This is a Fabulous Film, With its Eye on a Battered & Beaten Milquetoast Husband slowly sinking into Delirium, Portrayed Brilliantly by Bill Oberst Jr., One of the Finest Actors Working ToDay ! Lise Hart is the Domineering Self-Serving Wife, who is at the Center of All the Problems that this Film brings before Us !
  It is an OutStanding Psychological Thriller with Some Horror, Blood, & Gore Thrown in at Pivotal Times during the way !
Cindy Merrill Portrays a Beautiful Psychiatrist, whose Acting is as Fine as Her Body; & Dawna Lee Heising is Nurse Voorhees, whose Beauty is the Topic of a Sponge-Bath Conversation that makes the Mind Wonder about Her Perfect Body being Hidden Under Her ""Scrubs"" !
  Veteran Actor Gregory Blair Exhibits His Always Fine Performance as the Doctor; & Mikhail Blokh is Wonderful as the Caring & Considerate Best Friend !
  There are Plenty of Twists & Turns Along the Way, Leading to an UnExpected Ending !

8717986,2,B00YAZNBM0,"Some entertainment value is had with trying to figure out just what the source of the writers visons, fantasies, dreams and reality is but ultimately this is a slog to get through as it unfolds too slowly. Better than a lot of free Prime horror but go in with low expectations.",1449532800,,277,4.450980392156863
