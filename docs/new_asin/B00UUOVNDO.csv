8708430,5,B00UUOVNDO,"Just released from Gorgon Video is another remarkable set of exploitation classics from the great Arthur Marks. Following on the heels of Gorgon's recent Marks double feature of The Roommates/A Woman for All Men, is another set of his pre-Blaxploitation, mid '70's sleaze. I previously owned the Dark Sky Film's DVD of Bonnie's Kids but had never gotten around to watching it. The Centerfold Girls I was unfamiliar with, but given my track record with other Arthur Marks films, I couldn't pass this set up.

Bonnie's Kids stars the beautiful Tiffany Bolling and Robin Mattson as sisters Ellie and Myra. They live with their abusive stepfather until an unfortunate ""accident"" occurs, leading the girls to drive across the country to move in with their rich uncle Ben and his wife Diana. Ben tries to help the girls start new lives but when they get mixed up with a private detective and a plot to steal a package full of money, the past starts to creep up on them.

The Centerfold Girls (co-written by Marks and directed by television director John Peyser) plays out almost like an anthology film with Andrew Prine as a religious zealot stalking three different nude models whom he wants to ""help"". Of course by help I mean taunt, stalk and murder. The girls he hunts are played by the sexy trio of Jaime Lyn Bauer, Inseminoid's Jennifer Ashley and (once again) Tiffany Bolling. Also appearing are The Big Bird Cage's Teda Bracci, Aldo Ray, tough guy Mike Mazurki and Janus Blythe from The Hills Have Eyes.

Gorgon has outdone themselves here with this depraved duo of exploitation classics. Bonnie's Kids felt like a '70's good time Bad News Bears type film one minute (I dig that theme song) and then the next the girls are naked or someone is getting blown away with a shotgun. Oh and did I mention Arthur Marks regular Alex Rocco appears as a goon too! Sadly, they just don't make films like this anymore. The Centerfold Girls on the other hands was just dripping with sex and violence from start to finish. Andrew Prine was so creepy as Clement Dunne, servant of God and professional weirdo and you couldn't find a more beautiful group of stalkees (I think I just made up a new word) than Bolling, Ashley and Bauer. If you are looking for two drive-in classics, you wouldn't be able to find a better pair than these two films. Gorgon's new Blu Ray looks absolutely beautiful and features some nice interviews with Bolling, Marks and Prine giving us some interesting behind the scenes stories about these films and their careers as well.",1449532800,5,2540,4.729119638826185
8708431,5,B00UUOVNDO,These brought back great memories of having seen them in the drive-in when I was much younger.,1442620800,,94,4.588235294117647
8708432,3,B00UUOVNDO,"BONNIE'S KIDS is probably the best of Tiffany Bolling's 1970s drive-in credits because it's her biggest and meatiest role. Tiffany and her kid sister (played by future soap star Robin Mattson) flee to the big city from their backwoods town after Tiff shoots their sleazy stepfather for getting a little too hands-on with his pretty young charges. The two look up their rich uncle (Scott Brady) to provide room and board and before long Tiff's gotten herself involved in criminal conspiracy with averse private dick Steve Sandor, who can't resist her charms.

The story and acting in BONNIE'S KIDS is actually much better than what's usually expected in this type of drive-in fare. What helps this movie work is the fact that Bolling can actually act because let's face it, a lot of the women in these types of movies were hired because Arthur Marks could convince them to take off their clothes on-camera. While she does show some skin (look for the angora bikini she wears in the pool scene!) it's her performance that makes the movie. It doesn't hurt that many credible actors such as Alex Rocco, Scott Brady and even young Mattson does a fine job with a hilarious harangue in the middle of the movie ('I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're a g--d-mn queer!'). Steve Sandor, usually cast as the heavy, plays a sympathetic character here and does well.

Don't blink or you'll miss boxer Ken Norton (a year or so before his big breakout role in MANDINGO) in a gym scene and a pre-CAGNEY & LACEY Sharon Gless shows up as a waitress named Sharon.

THE CENTERFOLD GIRLS is like a serial-killer trilogy that follows stalk-and-slash leading man Andrew Prine working out his sexual-repression issues by taking a straight-razor to the young ladies pictured in his Centerfolds of the Year magazine, one by one.

Future YOUNG & THE RESTLESS star Jaime Lyn Bauer plays the victim in Act 1 and does an adequate job. This story is given an interesting twist because Prine's stalking is interrupted when a Manson-esque gang invades Bauer's rustic cabin to terrorize her. B-Movie regular/Roger Corman alumna Teda Bracci plays one of them and while she's usually good for a few laughs, here she's just annoying with all the subtlety of a gorilla.

Act II finds accomplished actors such as Aldo Rey, Francine York, Ray Danton and Mike Mazurki slumming in an overpopulated and ridiculous story in which Prine's character is single-handedly able to dispatch of four healthy young women and two strong men in one weekend. York is especially fun as the uptight, no-nonsense den mother at odds with Danton but this middle segment is definitely the weakest of the three, despite having the most experienced actors.

Tiffany Bolling fans have to wait for the final reel before she shows up as a stewardess/our Final Girl who squares off with Prine in the subversive climax, which finds her taking charge and surprisingly turning the tables on her tormentor.

This is an okay set. I've seen plenty of other Exploitation flicks that are much more entertaining and while these are probably the best films Arthur Marks directed, they don't really merit repeat viewings. Still, this set is much more worthwhile than the ROOMMATES/A WOMAN FOR ALL MEN double-feature that was also released by Gorgon. The Bonus Features include recent interviews with Arthur Marks, Andrew Prine, Francine York and Tiffany Bolling and the picture quality is great.

THREE-and-a-HALF stars.",1436313600,7,3446,4.939550949913644
8708433,5,B00UUOVNDO,"Excellent 70s exploitation cinema packaged in a nice double feature set. ""Bonnie's Kids"" is one of the best retro classics with story elements that is very similar to Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"". ""The Centerfold Girls"" is a gritty horror flick with enough T&A and pulp that is very enjoyable. Kudos to Grogon Video for a well produced Blu-Ray set.",1435104000,3,354,5.016949152542373
