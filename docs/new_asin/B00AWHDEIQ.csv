5523105,4,B00AWHDEIQ,"I'm really hoping this is the original English dub that was first released, cause if I'll be buying it for sure. The original dub has yet to be released on DVD so I'm hoping this is it. The original dub had a spacial charm not like the re-dub Dragon Dynasty did which was utter crap. These films are already classics, but if I find out its the original classic dub I'll be sure to give it a full 5 stars. I'll be keeping my fingers crossed!",1358726400,6,440,4.127906976744186

5523111,4,B00AWHDEIQ,"Police Story is as good as I remember (though it would be nice if the original English dub was still available; the newer version featuring Jackie doing his own lines is not nearly as good as the original). A witty action thriller, with some of the best stunt work on film. Police Story II is a disappointment, however. While the stunt work continues to amaze, the story is far too derivative and scattered. Overall, the Blu-ray double feature is a nice presentation with good value.",1477353600,2,483,4.694117647058824

5523131,5,B00AWHDEIQ,"I admittedly haven't see as many Jackie Chan movies as I probably should have over the years, especially considering how amazing Police Story 1 and 2 are.  You can't help but to hang your mouth open in sheer awe as the action scenes play out, and the comedy is genuinely funny.  They don't make 'em like they used to, that's for sure.

I am thankful that this DVD has the Cantonese audio with English subtitles option for both movies, as the English dubs for these films are cringe-worthy.",1441065600,,489,4.534090909090909

I wouldn't rank them any higher than some of his other meh work, such as operation condor or Wheels on Meals.

5523138,5,B00AWHDEIQ,"These movies were made back when Jackie Chan was in his prime and it shows.

5523149,5,B00AWHDEIQ,"Fans of Jackie Chan really need this collection.  These are two of his more serious films, no real funny business as in his newer movies.  The choreography in this is top notch, which of course is standard in any Chan flicks.  The dubbing is lackluster, but that is standard in most ""kung fu"" type flicks.  Of course, they spend months filming the fighting and only a few days on the dubbing.

I think I enjoy Police Story more than PS2, if only because of the mall fighting scenes.  The pole slide is the wow factor in this film, in my opinion.  The fighting is great and some of the stunts are incredible; wouldn't expect anything less though.

PS2, is a great flick as well.  The wow factor in this one is the playground fight scene.  I'll also throw in the fighting in the factory.

Again, if you are a fan of Jackie and his movies, then I wouldn't pass this collection up.",1424044800,,877,4.351851851851852
5523150,5,B00AWHDEIQ,Do good job on time,1423699200,,19,3.0
5523151,5,B00AWHDEIQ,"Great deal...you get Jackie Chan's probably two best movies of his career on one blue-ray disc. That is right you read it correctly,...his two best movies.  In the 1980's, Jackie Chan was in the prime of his life.  The action stunts he performed in the first two Police Story films are sensational and mouth-opening. Chan is known for doing his own stunts...and at the end of each of these films the viewer can watch the filming of the stunts/behind the scenes re-takes of some of them...there are deep cuts, there is blood, there are bruises, and even broken limbs.

About the films, the original Police Story (1985) is really good, action and story wise. In the first part, we are introduced to policeman Chan Ka Kui (Jackie Chan) and his un-orthodox ways of catching criminals.  The story deals with Chan trying to arrest notorious boss of the Hong Kong underworld who deals with drugs.  The film is knows for Chan's last scene stunt, where he jumps on Christmas light-fixtures that are hanging few stories down in a shopping mall center and slides-down on them while in the process breaking all the light, which resulted in actual injury to his hands.  I really enjoyed watching Police Story (1985), but did not expect Police Story 2 (1988) to be even better, much better.  Police Story 2 is longer than the first part, and what is so good about the second part is that it is part, DRAMA, part POLICE ACTION. part COMEDY, part KUNG FU ACTION, part JAMES BOND ACTION...never have I seen a movie that had so many genres mashed in together.  What is even more astonishing, is that all these components fit perfectly together, as a result making the second part one of the best Hong Kong action films I have ever watched.  The only films that come even close to Police Story 2 are the films from the Mad Mission series, which interestingly were also shot in Hong Kong in the 1980's.

If you think Die Hard is the best action film from 1988, than watch Police Story 2.  Jackie Chan makes Bruce Willis look like a girl scout.",1423612800,6,2023,4.591666666666667

5523155,5,B00AWHDEIQ,"Police Story was great movie of Jackie Chans for the way the fights were set up they happened so fast and every for the most part did their own stunts , which makes it moore believeable than most martial arts movies. The second movie wasn't as good but the action is still there I would recommend both of these movies for the fight scenes only the acting was not that great , but that is not why most people by martial arts movies for they buy them for the action , fight scences . Great fight scenes if you are a Jackie Chan it is a must for your collection.  For one reason only at the end of police story they show all the out takes when Jackie gets hurt , when the stunt men miss there mark and end up in the hospital for several weeks. It and to the quality of the movie and Jackie started doing this after he worked with Burt Renyolds .",1411344000,,842,4.041916167664671

5523158,4,B00AWHDEIQ,I like it because I am a Jackie Chan fan. Although I preferred him much better before he had all the comedy in his films. The negative to making this purchase might be the fact that Police story is up part 4 now. The good news is that police story is basically independent stories so getting parts 3 and 4 are not absolutely necessary. The simple truth here is that the acrobatic genius of Jackie Chan's fighting style is not duplicated anywhere and every movie he makes has different stunts.,1408752000,,492,4.477777777777778

5523164,5,B00AWHDEIQ,"These two movies are some of the great production from Hong Kong during it's hey days. Jacky Chan does almost all the stunts as during the 1980, every action stunts are for real. For those who have not watch it or own it on Blue Ray. This is a good chance to own it as it a good value buy.",1371340800,,289,3.8333333333333335
5523165,1,B00AWHDEIQ,"So this is the third time this movie has been released and once again it does not have the original English Dubbing. Watched for 5 mins and turned off and put in my VHS burned to DVD copy. Now this may not matter to some people but to me it does. The original dubbing was done much better and some of the humor has been lost with this version again just like the DVD release from a few years ago. Unless they do the right dub soundtrack next time this will be the last time I purchase.

The language tracks are 5.1 and 2.0 in Cantonese and English, but for some reason when I switch to 2.0 in both language's there is no sound and on my receiver the Dts blinks on and off, this is the first Blu-ray I own that has done this.

The movie is a 5 star movie no doubt but they should have released the original dub and this version together instead of this horrible new dub yet again.",1366416000,5,879,4.045977011494253

RIDING SHOTGUN

  Over the years I have met various film directors who claim they'd studied the film-making of Buster Keaton and had been influenced by Keaton's 1920s cinema-language defining work and mind-warping, eye-boggling stunts.

  Keaton's superb timing and physical form leapt from the screen as if he defied gravity and mortal injury, with grace to spare.

  Jackie Chan has been quoted that Buster Keaton was a major influence to him in many of his films.

  SHOUT Factory has just released two of Jackie's Police Story movies on one Blu-Ray!

  In Police Story, alone, if you are familiar with Keaton's work, you can see that in Jackie's case he wasn't just talking words.

  I can find moments in Police Story and Police Story 2 where Jackie displays not only his incredible, balletic actions, but shows the influence of not just Buster Keaton, but also Douglas Fairbanks and Harold Lloyd's films from the 1920s.

  To take nothing away from Lloyd, because he did do many of his own stunts, with fingers missing from one hand, blown off by a prop for a still photo shoot, but Harvey Parry did double Harold in the more dangerous stunts.

  Jackie and Buster and Fairbanks did their own stunts.

  And Fairbank's modus operandi was to make the most difficult stunt look easy.

  You will see Jackie Chan do this again and again in Police Story 1 and 2.

  This is the first time either of the Police Story films have been released on Blu Ray, a double-feature from Jackie's prime as a director and star.  Shout has released them on DVD, also.  You can't beat the price, even the Blu-Ray can be found for less than $20.00.  The prints are the best I personally have ever seen, and although I am far from an expert on the films, they certainly appear to be uncut.  It's hard to tell with many of Jackie's films because there have been so many versions of different lengths released over the years.

  If you don't have any Jackie Chan on DVD, then this is an inexpensive way to own two of Jackie's most popular movies during the 1980s.

  Police Story opens with one of Jackie's biggest-scale openings ever, a drug raid taking place in a hillside Shanty Town, with tiers of buildings scattered haphazardly down the long, steep mountainside.  When the raid goes terribly awry within the first 5 minutes, Jackie is immediately in action.  The chase for the drug-lord and his cohorts smashes by cars down the mountain-side, through the ramshackle buildings and bright red and yellow clotheslines and paraphernalia from store goods to furniture.

These are two of his best.  fantastic stunts and half decent stories.  Great price for two movies as well.

The blu ray transfer is good and scales well, but it does not appear to be a better transfer over the DVDs, so the improvement (though there) is not as great as other movies I have watched on blu ray vs DVD.  Still a 5 star combination for me.",1517961600,3,584,4.115044247787611
