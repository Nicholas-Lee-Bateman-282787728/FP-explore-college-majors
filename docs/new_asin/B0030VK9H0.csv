8386149,5,B0030VK9H0,"Hello,

Just saw Patricia Martin's note, and thought I'd respond.  For less than $200.00, there are several DVD players available which will play discs from ANYWHERE on the planet.  We've had a couple.  Currently, we are using a very compact unit which will connect to either a newer television or any computer (we have an iMac, so we're using the Apple version, a PC version is also available; both will work with digital televisions).",1286323200,,436,4.851351351351352
8386150,1,B0030VK9H0,"Until I received this dvd I had no idea there were territorial restrictions regarding what certain areas of the world are allowed to play.  When I found out that I could not play this dvd with equipment available to me in the U.S. I returned it, unopened to Media-Mash at their return address.  Today I got the package back marked ""Not deliverable as addressed.  Unable to forward.""  I can only conclude that Media-Mash is not a legitimate company, not doing business legitimately.  I'm surprised that Amazon would be affiliated with a scammer.",1268870400,5,544,4.869565217391305
8386151,5,B0030VK9H0,Merlin Season 2 is even better than season 1! The episodes are exciting and you see a lot of characters evolve toward what they will become in the future... Romance for Gwen--who should she choose Arthur or Lancelot?; Morgana finding out her powers and Arthur developing into the future King of Camelot!,1263340800,3,303,4.846153846153846
