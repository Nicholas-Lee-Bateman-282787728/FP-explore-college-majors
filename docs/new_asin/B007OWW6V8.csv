5101683,1,B007OWW6V8,"With a script that includes lines like, ""I don't have to think, I'm Catholic!"", this film is another example of how anti-Catholicism is one of the last acceptable forms of bigotry in America. If you enjoy films that misrepresent a faith tradition while supporting the redefinition of marriage, you will enjoy this film.",1336435200,5,319,5.037735849056604
5101684,4,B007OWW6V8,"Anne Renton's {her directorial debut}The Perfect Family is a solid and well made film. There are cliches and some obvious moments, but the performances of Kathleen Turner, Emily Deschanel and a very fine supporting cast rise above the cliches.  Eileen Cleary, a devout catholic is nominated for an award, Catholic Woman of the Year. Her subsequent soul-searching, and efforts to make her not so perfect family perfect is the seam that holds this family drama together. I found it believable. Having grown up in the catholic church, none of it seemed over the top to me. Emily Deschanel does a fine turn as Shannon Cleary. She has several really well played scenes with Kathleen Turner. An excellent soundtrack to move the story works really well.
I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan to watch it again.",1336089600,18,798,4.911111111111111

5101686,1,B007OWW6V8,Kathleen Turner tried to make a good film.  Too bad it failed to deliver.,1505001600,,73,4.214285714285714
5101687,2,B007OWW6V8,"Even with decent names on this, the material was dull and the pace was slow.  Could be a bit controversial, depending on your viewing buddies.  While Catholicism is almost like a character in this movie, I would not call it a religious movie at all.",1504742400,,249,4.511111111111111
5101688,3,B007OWW6V8,"Kathleen's acting isn't as bad as some of these reviews are saying.  In fact I think she did a good job and so did the other actors ( except for Deschanel who I generally think is mediocre at best and I'm being generous. ) The plot and the dialogue is where this movie fell short.  It just felt too  unbelievable and somewhat predictable in parts. There were also parts of the storyline they could have delved into a bit more, and some scenes they definitely could have cut. I'm also not sure if this is really how Catholicism is but the competition to get absolution from the Pope was just ridiculous to me.  Why on earth would people be competing for complete absolution from the Pope. I thought all you needed to do was confess your sins and all was forgiven, which btw I have my own thoughts about but i'm not here to disrespect anybody's religion .

The whole storyline just felt a bit ridiculous to me but I was able to watch to the end so that alone means its tolerable at best.",1504396800,,985,4.302702702702702
5101689,4,B007OWW6V8,What a wonderful movie. That's what real life is...Loving your family despite their choices.,1504396800,,92,5.642857142857143

5101693,4,B007OWW6V8,I watched this on a whim because it showed up on some recommendation list. I have always loved Kathleen Turner's performances and this one did not disappoint. It's a movie about a normal/abnormal family whose members stumble around living their lives. Kind of like we all do. And it has the wonderful Richard Chamberlain playing a priest again! Who could resist that?,1503532800,,367,4.935483870967742
5101694,5,B007OWW6V8,Guilty Catholics!  So dysfunctional!  So hypocritical ... in ways that maybe only catholic would understand.  SMH (eyeroll).  Excellent movie.  Excellent!,1503532800,,154,6.5
5101695,1,B007OWW6V8,"Wow. This was clearly written by someone who knows nothing about the Roman Catholic Church and has still a dull axe to grind. I couldn't make it all the way through, though I love some of the actors. Boring, biased, uninteresting unless you live in a bizarro world.",1503360000,,265,4.541666666666667
5101696,2,B007OWW6V8,Slow and not very entertaining. It was  too pushy with liberal politics.,1503360000,3,72,5.0
5101697,4,B007OWW6V8,"The main reason I watched this movie was because of Kathleen Turner.  But, I found it to be a movie about a family unlike most of us and a mom who has a hard time dealing with the truth of it.  She finally does and we can all learn that love is love, and seeking to understand what you don't, and forgiveness and starting over are new paths to harmony in our lives and families.  Acting was excellent.",1503273600,2,401,4.115384615384615
5101698,3,B007OWW6V8,"I enjoyed the movie, but it definitely shows how religion can be confusing for everyone.",1503187200,,88,4.933333333333334
5101699,1,B007OWW6V8,"No real plot and very boring.... waste of time.  Kathleen Turner acted as though it was hard to breath, which made me feel like I couldn't breath either...turned off half way through.",1503100800,,183,4.71875
5101700,4,B007OWW6V8,"A good film with a great message. Sometimes movies with a serious message are so heavy-handed that you're tired after seeing the film. This movie is a comedy/drama that deals with several serious issues,(divorce, faith, gay marriage, alcoholism, and love). The message of the film is ultimately that love trumps everything else. And the last scene of the film proves that.

While on the surface, the film takes a well-earned go at the Roman Catholic Church, positive things are also presented about the church. When all is said and done, we are all flawed, and the quality that is always needed to overcome our imperfections is love.
That's the overall feeling that The Perfect Family presents and succeeds at well.",1502928000,,715,4.958333333333333
5101701,5,B007OWW6V8,"I am not a religious person but I did really enjoy the movie. It's about struggling through choices that some might consider right and wrong, just trying to do what makes you happy. Kathleen Turner is still such a great actress!",1502668800,3,228,4.585365853658536
5101702,1,B007OWW6V8,"The storyline makes the point rather clear: faithful Catholics are unthinking, deceptive, judgemental hypocrites more interested in appearances than living an authentic faith. Peppered with glaring doctrinal and disciplinary inaccuracies, this waste of film made me want a long, hot bath when it finally ended.

A work of malicious fiction aimed at marginalizing good Catholics, and assaulting their real faith.",1502582400,3,411,5.85
5101703,1,B007OWW6V8,"Predictable and slow-moving; every Catholic stereotype and cliche one could possibly consider.  I watched the first 10 minutes, then fast-forwarded it to a few scenes to decide 12 minutes was 12 minutes too long to spent on this forgetful film.",1502582400,2,244,5.1
5101704,5,B007OWW6V8,The storyline of the Perfect Family was well told! I enjoyed the well-played performance from the cast members.,1502496000,,111,5.222222222222222
5101705,4,B007OWW6V8,"Kathleen is a beautiful as ever! The film takes a human view of the things the bible warns us against, abortion, homosexuality and adultery - the woman torn between her faith and love for the family is an all too familiar story. In the end , however , I believe following Christ is about obedience , to his will not ours.",1502064000,,321,4.278688524590164
5101706,3,B007OWW6V8,"If you are a religious person you may find this film as trite as the rest of us. It is not horrible, in fact, there are many good parts, but still...

Kathleen Turner plays Eileen Cleary, who has been nominated for 'Catholic Woman of the Year by her Monsignor, played by Richard Chamberlain. Yes, I know.  Her competition is her rival forever more itvseems, Agnes Dunn, played by Sharon Lawrence. Eileen is the perfect Catholic woman, recognized by all, even her family. However, she has concerns.

Eileens daughter, Shannon, played by Emily Deschanel, has kept a secret for a long time, but now that she is five months pregnant, she cannot hold back any longer. At the family dinner to celebrate Eileen's nomination, she announces she is pregnant and going to marry her girlfriend, Angela. At the same time Eileens son, Frank Jr., played by Jason Ritter, has left his wife and two children for his real love, a beautician.

This is the perfect family, not. Eileen is beside herself. Now, as things come to a head, the real film begins. We can guess what occurs, but will leave it up to you.

5101726,5,B007OWW6V8,"You will either love it or hate it - if the latter then you did not understand it.  I laughed, I cried, and then did both at the same time.  It is not anti-Catholic unless your shoes are too tight.  It is anti-religious in a positive way (rules-rules-rules).  It is truly Christian if you know what being a true Christian is - that is.  The nuances are over the top and you find more with each viewing.  A pity so many reviewers were compelled to give away the script - they had nothing to say so they just said a lot - they would truly make a dinner party one from hell.

5101738,5,B007OWW6V8,"If you had never heard of any of these actors before, you would be impressed by their range of emotions, depth, and feeling. Kathleen Turner especially is excellent, as the conflicted mother of a not-so-perfect family and also a very devout church goer in a (mostly) very judgmental church. She shows up for everyone, all the time, even when there are problems,and she is a mama bear for everyone she cares about  -- but she wears her worries on her face and in her body language so it is not difficult to see how she is really feeling inside.  But of course most of us have seen Turner before, and she has always been good so this is no revelation.  She is simply older and pleasantly plump now, and in many ways a more lovable actress now, one that reminds me of my own mom.  The other actors are equally fine, including her daughter, son, husband, priest ( Richard Chamberland, a nice touch) and her rival at church.  The sets and locations also add to the familiar tone of the film.  The only thing I would improve is the script, which does have many fine lines but could use many more for this caliber of actors, and is too predictable in places.",1391558400,,1151,4.40566037735849

God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit we know as one Supreme Being, who made this Earth of ours and we need to start listening to God, Jesus and the Holy (GHOST) Spirit, as man did not start the Catholic Church. Jesus the Son of God started the Catholic Church and He did not discriminate against others, nor did he put others down, as the last election showed me that a man who calls himself a Priest tells people how to vote, has for sure created a sin against our Free Will that God gave us to select the right person for the job, not to be told how and who to Vote for anytime..............

The Perfect Family (2011)

5101762,4,B007OWW6V8,"It is interesting to see actors successfully take on roles that are so different from those for which they were previously so well-known.  This is certainly the case here for Kathleen Turner, who once reigned in Hollywood as the adventurous ""hot babe.""  In this film she revisits the conservative Catholic world that she inhabited in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Virgin-Suicides/dp/B000NK7H1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Virgin Suicides</a>&nbsp;as a mother who was had all but retreated from the troubling modern world that seemed to have cursed her family.  This time, however, her character is fully engaged--albeit reluctantly--with a host of modern issues facing her husband and children--ranging from homosexuality to marital infidelity.

Although her conservative Catholic world is quite alien to me, Turner's compelling acting forced me to care about her character as she struggles to find a place in her heart for her somewhat wayward husband and children.  I was especially touched by her troubled but evolving relationship with her Lesbian daughter, who is played charmingly by Emily Deschanel.  This struggle is highlighted by the scene in which Turner's character reluctantly attends Deschanel's wedding to her long-time partner--only for Turner to bolt from her seat when the times arrives for her daughter to kiss her newly wedded spouse--an awkward exit thwarted by Turner's collision with a waiter carrying glasses of champagne!

After seeing this movie, I was surprised to learn that it was considered a comedy!  I really had no inclination to laugh at any point of this movie, as I was constantly enveloped by the feeling of empathy that Turner's powerful performance elicited from me!

Later on, however, after thinking about this movie for a while, it occurred to me that Richard Chamberlain did play the priest in a pretty funny way.  In fact, while playing the priest it seemed like he was doing an imitation of George Takei!",1372982400,,2001,5.574257425742574

5101768,1,B007OWW6V8,"If you are a Christian, get ready to be portrayed as a bigoted, two-faced, poser because you believe that marriage is between a man and a woman and that adultery is wrong.  As an added bonus, you will come across as a shrill, wrinkled, old bitty, who whines that her husband's alcoholism impacted you too.

I really liked Kathleen Turner, I had no idea that she would be so willing to portray the old fashioned woman, who is stuck in the past.

Her family they are really nice and though she doesn't approve of her, they generally speak to her in a polite, loving way except in one scene where they really let it all hang out about her shortcomings.

Even though her daughter is pregnant and on her way to marry her partner of six years; she obviously isn't happy about it.  Yet, she waits on her daily when her daughter is off work under doctor's orders.  When she miscarries, the mother is on the scene to comfort her while the daughter tells her that she will never understand what it is like to loose a daughter.  Yet, the mother lost the daughter, that her daughter willingly portrayed for 30 years.  That isn't even touched on.  The fact that the mother goes to the commitment ceremony doesn't get her points either because she has an anxiety attack making a scene.  What really bites is that when the mother confesses, that she had an abortion, when her husband was still drinking and threatening divorce, her own loss is ignored.  In fact, she is even more imperfect because she is a ""hypocrite"" according to the movie.

I am angry that I watched the entire movie to see where things would go.

Spoiler Warning

The mother sees herself as a hypocrite and leaves the church to join her family.  The sad part was when she confesses her abortion because of the possible abandonment while her husband was cheating on her during his active alcoholism; no one comforts her.  This is the key to her ""works"" mentality which is found in some driven people.  She had to earn God's love.  She had never received/or come to believe that she was already forgiven for taking the life of her child.

This entire movie distorts many of the key tenets of Christianity.

We believe:
We are saved by the shed blood of Christ the son of God.

We don't believe:
We are perfect.

We believe:
that the Bible is the word of God, and our guide to live in a pleasing manner and escape choices that may have painful consequences.

We don't believe:
that we can select and choose only parts of the Bible to follow and ignore that which doesn't suit us or our desires.

We believe:
God loves all his children.

We don't believe:
God only loves Christians.

We believe:
that there is a judgment after physical death based only on if we loved Jesus and allowed him to cleanse our sins.

We don't believe:
that you get ""recycled"" and that your behavior/karma brings you a better or worse depending on this present manifestation.

We believe:
God is love.  Christians are called to love as Christ did.

We don't believe:
That we should condemn people who aren't followers as less important or valuable; however, we can't truly love someone without pointing out their destructive or anti-Bible behaviors because even Christ challenged people to live righteously before God.

When you love someone, you tell the truth with love and graciousness.
If I'm lost, I will ask for directions.  How about those of you, that thought the woman was a wretch?

The director told the story well. So kudos to a first time director, and a woman.

Claire's film about a devoted Catholic mother (Kathleen Turner) grappling with the Church's possible reaction to her less-than-perfect family (Jason Ritter, Emily Deschanel, and Michael McGrady).

I liked that the story touched on some very real day-to-day contemporary issues and dealt honestly with organized religion and the struggles some folks endure when their heart feels one thing and believes another.

A bittersweet comedy, I felt like I could relate to all of the characters, even the ones whose point of view I didn't share. With the exception of a single supporting character who was a little one dimensional, it never felt like the filmmakers resorted to cheap stereotypes to make their specific point known. They let us come to our conclusions on our own.

5101811,3,B007OWW6V8,"Beginners Anne Renton, director, and Paula Goldberg and Claire V. Riley, writers, had a good idea when framing this story about a mother's bigotry hidden under the cloak of Catholicism, and the film could have been extremely pertinent in today's milieu of the President's sanctioning of same sex marriage. The problem is the script is so weak and pasted together that it gives very little weight to the actors to bring off the message that could have been important. Yes, some viewers may rile that the film is anti-Catholic but it is not - it is just anti-prejudice.

Eileen Cleary (Kathleen Turner, crippled by a weak script until the very end of the film), a woman who devotes 98 % of her life to tending to her church duties and caring for the elderly who are house bound and other good Christian deeds, has been nominated as Catholic Woman of the year: the other nominee is Agnes Dunn (Sharon Lawrence), an almost equal do-gooder - both nominated by Monsignor Murphy (Richard Chamberlain). Eileen's family must be approved for the award and that is when the balloon of Eileen's glee seems to pop: her husband Frank (Michael McGrady) is an alcoholic who has been sober 15 years and must attend AA meetings; her son Frank, Jr (Jason Ritter) has left his wife and family for a manicurist whom he loves; and her daughter Shannon (Emily Deschanel, a successful 30-something lawyer and 5 months pregnant, is about to marry her girlfriend Angela (Angelique Cabral) in a same sex wedding to be performed by Father Joe (Scott Michael Campbell). Eileen is disturbed that Anglea's parents (Elizabeth Pe&ntilde;a and Gregory Zaragoza) approve and will host the wedding. Desperate to win the award, Eileen is conflicted between shame over her family and still desiring to do the right thing by them. Unable to accept any of their choices her family begins to splinter, with even her husband threatening to leave. How it all turns the corner is when Eileen finally reveals a secret of her own she has always had to hide for fear of being judged a bad Catholic. The ending is the best part of the film as it finally shows Eileen to be a more complete human being and things seem to fall in line.

The cast tries hard to make this all work and succeed as far as the script will allow. Katheen Turner, looking cosmetically and adipose altered, struggles with her role, but by film's end she seems to succeed in conveying the message of the film.

5101812,3,B007OWW6V8,"Beginners Anne Renton, director, and Paula Goldberg and Claire V. Riley, writers, had a good idea when framing this story about a mother's bigotry hidden under the cloak of Catholicism, and the film could have been extremely pertinent in today's milieu of the President's sanctioning of same sex marriage.  The problem is the script is so weak and pasted together that it gives very little weight to the actors to bring off the message that could have been important. Yes, some viewers may rile that the film is anti-Catholic but it is not - it is just anti-prejudice.

Eileen Cleary (Kathleen Turner, crippled by a weak script until the very end of the film), a woman who devotes 98 % of her life to tending to her church duties and caring for the elderly who are house bound and other good Christian deeds, has been nominated as Catholic Woman of the year: the other nominee is Agnes Dunn (Sharon Lawrence), an almost equal do-gooder - both nominated by Monsignor Murphy (Richard Chamberlain). Eileen's family must be approved for the award and that is when the balloon of Eileen's glee seems to pop: her husband Frank (Michael McGrady) is an alcoholic who has been sober 15 years and must attend AA meetings; her son Frank, Jr (Jason Ritter) has left his wife and family for a manicurist whom he loves; and her daughter Shannon (Emily Deschanel, a successful 30-something lawyer and 5 months pregnant, is about to marry her girlfriend Angela (Angelique Cabral) in a same sex wedding to be performed by Father Joe (Scott Michael Campbell).

5101813,5,B007OWW6V8,"The Perfect Family is a heartfelt movie. It's about the reconciliation between religion and the realities of life and family. The two can go together with acceptance and love. The message is clear, I think: accept things for what they are and let God sort it out. To me, Kathleen Turner's character didn't become a true Catholic until she stopped trying to be the ""perfect"" Catholic.",1336608000,9,383,4.818181818181818
5101814,3,B007OWW6V8,"""I don't have to think, I'm catholic."" Eileen Cleary (Turner) has finally been nominated for Catholic Woman Of The Year and wants to win it badly. She will stop at nothing to win which includes trying to cover up her families choices. She then becomes conflicted as to winning or being a supportive mother. I have to start by saying that after the first half hour I was almost ready to turn this off. I'm not saying that it wasn't good but just really slow and seemed to lack emotion. The more I watched the better it got though and I really liked the ending. For a movie like this the ending was perfect. My biggest problem with this movie is that it seemed to lack real emotion and all the performances seemed flat and phoned in. I'm not sure what it was but I just felt like it was missing something to make me feel for the characters. Overall, a movie with a perfect ending that is worth watching but was lacking any real emotion from the actors. I give it a B-.",1336521600,3,966,4.255434782608695

8519931,3,B007OWW6V8,"While there are some funny moments in this film, it seems rather slow. With that said, Kathleen Turner plays the role of a guilt-ridden Catholic mother perfectly. I've met people like him, I knew a college guy who used to go to church three times a day, the Priest himself told me he was trying to be a better catholic than Jesus.

The situation is similar here. Kathleen has been nominated for the Catholic Woman of the Year award, and she's terrified because she doesn't have the perfect Catholic family. Her daughter is a lesbian, her son is dumping his wife for another woman. It's a very human movie, about a person who suddenly discovers how the world really is.",1505952000,,668,4.566666666666666
