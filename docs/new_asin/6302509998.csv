482197,4,6302509998,"After having completed Frankenstein and The Mummy, Boris Karloff turned his considerable acting talents to playing Sax Rohmer's firendish Yellow Menace, Fu Manchu.  Karloff in this picture is a sadistic monster. Even by the standards of the period, The Mask of Fu Manchu is VERY racist, but it is an exciting movie which has all the benefits of an MGM production, with cinematography by Tony Gaudio, and sets by Cedric Gibbons. Especially notable is the beautifully photographed and staged sequence of the opening of Genghis Khan's Tomb.

The Mask of Fu Manchu is also very much an example of pre-Code film making with some of the wildest scenes that ever made their way onto the screen in the early 1930's--particularly those in which Fu's daughter, played by Myrna Loy in her Chinese period, drools over the recumbent, nearly naked body of an immobilized Charles Starrett. It's a bit unnerving to see the woman who would epitomize 30's style and chic in just a few years in the Thin Man movies, playing such a wicked, and sex-crazed harlot.

Lewis Stone as a Scotland Yard inspector & Jean Hersholt as an archeologist both give the expected fine performance. Charles Starrett, as the much-abused young hero, & Karen Morley, as the requisite young woman on a dangerous expedition, both give a good account of themselves.

The dialog is typically weak and outdated early 30's fare and theres not much of a musical score, but other than those two drawbacks, this is a mighthy fun film to watch.",1102896000,5,1493,4.866141732283465
482198,5,6302509998,"The Mask of Fu Manchu easily could have served as inspiration for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Archaeologists dash to retrieve a relic to save Western Civilization from the diabolic Dr. Fu Manchu. There's feats of derring-do. Scenes of despicable torture and heroic bravery.
What makes this movie so much fun is that in ""Raiders"" you know Dr. Jones will win. Nazis are mere obstacles in his path to run over.
But in this movie, Boris Karloff's performance as the insidious Dr. Fu Manchu makes the Nazis seem like mere shadows of a threat compared to his evil genius. His Fu Manchu is a villain you not only fear, but respect.
Myrna Loy as his daughter is wickedly good. While the sparks put off by Fu Manchu's diabolical invention are impressive special effects, they are nothing in comparison to the sparks emitted by a young, scantily clad Myrna Loy.",1088467200,,848,4.697986577181208
482199,5,6302509998,"If you are a Karloff fan, you must see this movie. What a role - a rich Asian sadist! Myrna Loy is also quite impressive. I think the best part of this movie (other than Karloff's acting, and his make-up job - wow!) are the sets. There are different torture rooms for different characters. I've never read any of the Fu Manchu books, so I can't comment about that. But Karloff's portrayal is pure evil and pure genius!",1057104000,3,418,4.371794871794871

482201,5,6302509998,"Ah yes, Boris Karloff as an Oriental nutcase in search of the mystical mask of Genghis Khan. His daughter is ""Fah-Lo-See,"" (love the pun) played by then vamp, later to be Nora Charles, Myrna Loy. The movie is great fun, and of course the bad guys get their comeuppance in the end.",1017446400,2,280,4.403846153846154
482202,3,6302509998,"They most certainly do not make them like they used to. This 1932 film is probably the best Fu Manchu adaption and a strangely enjoyable film in its own right. One note, this film has been rated G according to the box. I do not agree with this rating for, thoughit is not as risque as it is made out to be, it still would not be proper viewing for very young children. I would give it a low PG.
The plot (if indeed it can be called that) involves everyone's favorite evil doctor plotting to gain the mask and sword of Genghis Kahn in order to rule the world. To gain that end, he and his equally wicked daughter abduct an archaelogical team one by one and come up with ""only in the movies"" methods of torture.
Now, a note on political correctness. It is a very risky proposition to judge a movie from a different era by modern standards. I don't agree with it. That said, some of the inaccuracies are very amusing. A few things I never knew before I saw The Mask of Fu Manchu:
Buddhists apparently loved human sacrifices (and worship Shiva)
Boas have poisonous bites
Scientists and archaeologists are terrified of tomb curses (like they've never seen them before)
Someone didn't do their research. (in all fairness, the books also play fast and loose with the facts, they are also great candy reading.)
The main reason to watch this film is to see Myrna Loy (pre-fame) and Boris Karloff chewing scenery with apparent relish as a wicked father/daughter duo. Who could have known in 1932 that Loy would enjoy a long career as a comedienne?
This movie is wonderful for lovers of camp. Also, movies buffs will enjoy seeing how this movie influenced many later serials. (I could see traces of Fu Manchu in Flash Gordan and G-Men vs. the Black Dragon) If you wish to compare pre and post Code movies, I suggest the old Tarzan series as a better indicator. (The pre and post study is not my cup of tea so that's the best I can offer by way of suggestions)
This movie can be great cornball fun if you relax and try not to judge it by modern standards.",1012867200,13,2043,4.3931398416886545
482203,4,6302509998,"The kind of movie they, alas, don't make anymore -- a stylish adventure  with exotic settings, a glamorous cast, zesty direction, and a lacing of  humor.
The video I bought has trimmed some of the ""yellow  peril"" dialog which now seems blatantly racist, but it also edited  down the famous scene in which handsome-and-hunky Charles Starrett is  flogged by Myrna Loy's slaves. (Myrna appears to get really excited while  watching Charlie writhe.) Considering all the head-exploding violence going  on in movies today, it's bewildering to find that someone took the time and  trouble to edit out the simple lashing of a whip.",968284800,,623,5.03921568627451
7827714,2,6302509998,"I am very apprehensive toward The Mask of Fu Manchu. On one hand, it was entertaining, but on the other hand, it was cringe-worthy. The film was full of racist undertones. For example, there was a scene when a few supporting actors that played Asian characters muttered gibberish that was supposed to be the Chinese language. In another scene, the Asian peoples were portrayed as barbarians as they banged on tables in lieu of clapping as an act of ovation. In addition, Boris Karloff, who played Fu Manchu, sported a long mustache and makeup that made him look treacherous, which reinforced the archetypal Asian villain. Meanwhile, Fu Manchus daughter, Fah Lo See, was over-sexualized and depicted as a lustful, yet cruel seductress. For example, there was a scene when Fah Lo See participated in sexual sadism as she ordered and witnessed the whipping of the half-naked Terry Granville. Again and again, the Asian characters in this film were exoticized and depicted as others. Historically, Western culture has been steeped in such fear of the yellow peril and this particular 1932 film certainly portrayed those sentiments clearly.",1391299200,,1135,5.10752688172043
7827715,3,6302509998,"The Mask of Fu Manchu is a very entertaining film. It has some humorous and overly dramatic moments. Despite it being an older film it is one that can still be enjoyed presently. For, example I thought the first appearance of Dr. Fu Manchu was very comical and cartoonish. He reminded me of what a mad scientist would appear as in a film. However, for someone to be highly educated in multiply fields, the film made him appear as someone who wasn't educated at all. When I think of someone with multiple doctrines I don't think of someone who still believes and or practices mystical practices. Despite it being an enjoyable film racism is seen throughout the film. I can only imagine the impression this film left on viewers when it originally came out. Its possible this film left a negative impression towards Asian culture. The film made the Asian population appear as though they are barbaric such sacrificing to the gods.",1391299200,,927,4.728395061728395
7827716,1,6302509998,"I'm very interested in how gender plays a role in the process of racialization. The Mask of Fu Manchu illustrates how colonization and white supremacy render the Asian man as feminine and therefore less worthy. Dr. Fu Manchu has long fingernails and a tall, slender body type; he must engage in magic-like experiments to subdue his enemies because he does not have the physical means to do so; he appears to be educated, but a misstep in his thought process leads to his demise. While many of these characterizations of femininity are also based in patriarchal stereotypes, their application onto Fu Manchu is an attempt to demean Asian men and maintain the power of white men.

I also paid close attention to how physical power symbolized political and social power. Whenever Fu Manchu or his henchmen were tasked with kidnapping or subduing any of the white individuals, an entire group of them were required. On the other hand, when the white people at the end of the film break free from Fu Manchu's laboratory/dungeon/cult headquarters, they individually exert physical violence, with success, against multiple henchmen. This portrayal depicts people of color (as Fu Manchu utilized a variety of Asian-appearing henchmen and Black slaves) as inherently weaker than white people and almost deserving of colonization and other forms of radicalized violence.

Overall, the movie supports a wide variety of racist ideologies, but also gives contemporary viewers a glimpse into how race is demonstrated in historic film.",1391299200,,1520,5.2
7827717,4,6302509998,"A year after his ""Frankenstein"" breakthrough, Boris Karloff portrayed the magnificently evil Dr. Fu Manchu in MGM's opulent pre-Code adventure. Produced by Irving Thalberg, ""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" (1932) contains one of Karloff's finest performances. The MGM gloss adds to the film's stylized depravity. You haven't lived until you've seen Myrna Loy as Fu's lustful daughter. Politically incorrect to the extreme, yet decadent fun. Apart from the Republic serial ""Drums of Fu Manchu"" (1940), the best movie adaptation of Sax Rohmer's classic villain.",1364688000,2,550,5.559523809523809
7827718,1,6302509998,"""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" presents two very different groups of people decked out in their stereotypical best. Looks and behavior serve to separate the English and the Asian into the good guys and the bad guys.

Fu Manchu has a face similar to a grotesque mask, with eyebrows that inexplicably curve upwards at the ends, instead of down in the normal arch. The guards who are under Fu Manchu's power are portrayed as primitive and animalistic. They creep and hide, climb trees and swing on ropes, attacking as soon as the English's back is turned. The English spend the entire movie bundled up in layers of clothes. Fu Manchu's men are an entirely different story. While the English have hats, shoes, vests, etcetera, the guards and assassins are barefoot, and bare-chested, with only a loincloth wrapped around their waists. Their weapons are also much less evolved, while they fling spears into people's backs the English have pistols. Even the powerful weapon that Fu-Manchu longs for is a large curving ancient sword.

The behavioral differences between Asians and English are quite clear throughout the film. Fu Manchu acts the part of merciless dictator well, as he sits on his gleaming throne and offers his daughter to the Englishman in exchange for information. He is shocked when nothing, not his daughter, not money, not even torture will convince the man to give up his friends. Also, while Fu Manchu is selfish Sheila, the young English woman, is selfless. Fu Manchu sacrifices his own guard to make the mind control substance, while Sheila risks everything to go after her father. Fu Manchu is drawn to the power of the ancient sword so he can use it for himself, the English realize that it's power it too great and they must get rid of it. Before they fling the sword overboard, Sheila expresses her sorrow that it cannot be displayed in a museum so others can see and learn about it.

From the beginning to end the filmmakers made it quite clear that the English and the Asian are complete opposites. The viewer is forced to pick a side, but they cannot even do it objectively. From the way the races are presented, the choices they make, and the values they stand for, it is obvious the viewer is meant to sympathies with the English and fear the Asians.",1327968000,,2270,4.7272727272727275
7827719,2,6302509998,"My greatest concern with this film, as with the first Fu Manchu novel, is its need to typify the sexuality of Chinese women.  For instance, when Terry is first captured and made unconscious by Fu Manchu, he allows his daughter to kiss and fondle the man, as it's her ""customary procedure.""  Prior to this, she demonstrates how her cruelty is comparable to her father's, allowing her henchmen to continuously whip Terry into unconsciousness.  The juxtaposition of these two scenes only alludes to the sexual gratification Fah Lo See attains with abuse and power.
This description differs from the one Sax Rohmer endorses in at least his first novel, The Insidious Fu Manchu.  In the novel, one of the protagonists makes a suggestion to torture Fu Manchu's slave (who is also an Asian woman) with sexually suggestive methods in order for her to reveal Fu Manchu's ulterior motives; here, the character even claims that the woman would ""adore [the] savagery"" (100).  In this case, the woman is put in Terry's place in the film.
However, in both the film and the novel, Chinese women are portrayed to be hypersexual beings, obtaining it from either control or through being subjugated.  And while it is understandable that it is difficult to give social commentary on antiquated narratives, I still believe that it is important and still relevant in our society today to continue to discuss the themes this film, and the rest of the Fu Manchu series, brings up.",1327622400,,1457,4.902439024390244
7827720,4,6302509998,"The Mask of Fu Manchu is a 1932 film from Cosmopolitan Pictures. The character is based on a 1912 serialized novel by Sax Rohmer, the popular English novelist  Fu made his film debut in 1923 in a UK serial ""The Mystery of Fu Manchu"". He made his U.S. debut in 1929 in ""The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu"", played by Warner Oland who would go on to star 3 more Fu films (1930, 1931) and then in a host of Charlie Chan films between 1931 and 1937.

Boris Karloff (1887-1969) appears as Fu. He started in films in 1916 and up until 1931 he was a bit player in B films. Then came ""Frankenstein"" (1931), ""The Mummy"" (1932) and ""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" (1932) and he was off on a whirlwind career that lasted for decades. For his makeup to be applied Karloff required more than 2 hours a day

Myrna Loy (1905-93) plays his daughter. She's best remembered as Nora Charles from ""The Thin Man"" series that produced 6 films between 1934 and 1947 She made more than 100 films, the most notable of which are ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946), ""Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House"" (1948) and ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" (1950).

Lewis Stone (1879-1953) plays the good guy, Commissioner Smith. He was a major star in the 20s and 30s and was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Patriot"" (1930). Between 1914 and 1953 he made more than 150 films; his memorable roles were as the warden in ""The Big House"" (1930), Doctor Otternschlag in ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), and ""Doc"" in ""Three Godfathers"" (1936). Gretta Garbo used him in 7 of her films. He's probably best known for his continuing role as Judge Hardy in the Andy Hardy films (1937-46).

 Jean Hersholt (1886-1956) plays Dr. Von Berg. He appeared in more than 100 films between 1906 and 1955, including such memorable films as ""Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"" (1921), Erich von Stroheim's ""Greed"" (1924), and ""The Country Doctor"" (1936). He's best remembered as Shirley Temple's grandfather in ""Heidi"" (1937).

Karen Morley (1909-2003) plays the threatened girl. She was originally hired by Clarence Brown as a stand in for his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Greta Garbo, and then built her own film career with appearances in films like ""Mata Hari"" (1931), ""Scarface"" (1932) and ""Dinner at Eight"" (1933). She was married to the film's director, Charles Vidor, from 1932 to 1943. She made more than 40 films before being blacklisted in the 50s.

Charles Starrett (1903-86) plays Morley's fiance. He is best remembered for his western films, notably, ""The Durango Kid"" series (1940-52).

The film was directed by Charles Brabin who directed nearly 100 films between 1912 and 1934, the most famous of which are  ""The Mask of Fun Manchu"" (1932)  and ""Rasputin and the Empress"" (1932) which is the only film to feature all 3 Barrymore siblings. Brabin is best known for his long lasting marriage to screen vamp Theda Bara. Much of the erotica in Fu Manchu can be found in Theda Bara's films.

The film was criticized in general for its portrayal of the Chinese, and specifically for a line delivered by Karloff - ""Kill the white men and take their women."" This didn't disturb media mogul William Randolph Hearst who owned Cosmopolitan Pictures, but World War 2 and alliance with the Chinese kept Fu from the big screen for many years.

Some pundits believe that the evil ""Ming the Merciless"" from the Flash Gordon comic (1934) and film series (1936) was taken from Fu. Ming himself was the prototype for the Emperor Palpatine in the Star Wars series. The parallels between Ming and Fu are numerous. Both are oriental with distinct mustaches and prone to wearing long robes. Both have daughters, called Princess, who have dark hair and who eventually fall for the athletic hero (Buster Crabbe/Charles Starrett) who ironically enough, has a parallel life as a screen cowboy. Both Ming and Fu are smitten by the blond girlfriend of the athlete, and both are opposed by the smart older man (Frank Shannon/Lewis Stone). Both Ming and Fu have a plethora of inventive tortures at their disposal, and both have access to super weapons.

BTW - Ian Fleming was a fan of the Sax Rohmer novels about Fu Man chu and we see this influence in characters like Ernst Stavro Blofeld (1957) and Dr. No (1958).

Fu Man chu was voted the #1 ""most infamous Yellow face film performances"" by Asian Week.

The film is a hoot and Karloff is marvelous. Definitely worth viewing.",1290124800,3,4363,4.721052631578948
7827721,4,6302509998,"This was a bit different with Boris Karloff playing an Asian ""bad guy."" He plays ""Fu Manchu,"" and man who sets out to get Genghis Khan's mask and sword which supposedly will give him the power to rule over millions of people.

Despite the classic film casting of white people to play Asians, I found Karloff to be ""cool"" looking as was his evil daughter, a young Myrna Loy. I like Karen Morely, usually, but not in here where she plays an almost-hysterical daughter of one of the good guys.

""Fu Manchu"" shows some of his unique methods of torture, nothing graphic, thankfully - not like today's blood and guts.

Some of this is amateurishly-done but overall it still a legitimate amount of real horror and terror and the cast certainly is entertaining. (""Andy Hardy"" star Lewis Stone also is in here along with Jean Hersholt and Charles Starret.)

Summary: a decent and almost-mystical adventure story that doesn't overstay its welcome, either, at a tidy 68 minutes. Pretty good stuff.",1237334400,,986,4.7823529411764705
7827722,3,6302509998,"I bought this VHS after reading some of the customer reviews on Amazon and I will have to be more discerning in the future.  Some of the reviews that were 5 stars raved about the production and the performances and I gotta wonder what they were watching or if they were sober during their movie experience.  This was a ""B"" movie at best and even for the early 1930's this was a poor effort.  I have always been a fan of Boris Karloff, Myrna Loy and even Lewis Stone, but I'm afraid they were wasted in this effort.  Even comparing it with Bela Lugosi's Dracula from the early 1930's and Frankenstein of the same time period, it can't hold a candle.  Lousy script, poorly staged and everything that went with that type of production.  Too bad.",1182124800,,742,4.419117647058823
7827723,5,6302509998,"This film is short (68 minutes) and superbly entertaining. It tells the story of a Chinese evil scientist/warlord (Boris Karloff) who wants to seize the golden mask and sword which belonged to Genghis Khan, to dominate the world and impose the supremacy of Eastern Cultures over the ""Western World"".

Karloff is rightly cast as the menacing Fu Manchu, more frightful than ever; this role along with the ones he played in ""Frankenstein"", ""The Mummy"" and ""The Old Dark House"", are my favorites of him.

Mention apart deserves a pre-""The Thin Man"" Myrna Loy, as his ""ugly and insignificant daughter"", an oversexed, nymphomaniac and sadistic oriental girl, who's got as aides in her schemes, many tall, muscular black men, dressed in loin-cloths.

Check the scene where Loy has the hero (Charles Starrett) whipped by her aides and others in which she has him at her complete mercy, like for example when Starrett is being injected a ""serum"" that will have him under the spell of Loy & Karloff, and do whatever they will: he's strapped on a sort of ""Operations Table"" and around him are these ""muscular"" slaves wearing loin-cloths, standing above pedestals and thus resembling ""living statues"" (The Art Deco Sets and the Art Direction in general is excellent).

There's another scene in which Karen Morley (dressed as a white virgin) is taken to a sacrificial ""tableau"" in front of an Oriental God.

Lewis Stone plays the head of the British Secret Service, who wants to prevent Fu Manchu from finding Genghis Khan's tomb and thus, his sword and mask.

Karen Morley plays the daughter of the British scientist who knows the Tomb's exact localization in China and who's kidnapped by Fu Manchu; hunky Charles Starrett plays her fianc, who is also very much sought after by Myrna Loy.

Also in it Jean Hersholt as scientist.

A must-see for Pre-Code, Adventure and Horror fans.",1111536000,7,1869,4.929936305732484
