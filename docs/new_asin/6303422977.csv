660459,4,6303422977,"'Proof' is a wonderful, intriguing movie that keeps you riveted to your seat every moment. It's not an action film or a serious melodrama or even a rollicking comedy.  It's a fascinating, plot-driven story with one  underlying theme:  trust.  Why would a blind man insist on taking  photographs?  Why would a woman continue to torment a man she insists she  loves?  And why would a friend betray someone who puts all his faith in him  just to 'play blind'? (see the movie...you'll know what I mean).  All the  performances are wonderful, particularly Hugo Weaving as our temperamental  photographer.  He gives Martin such depth that while he is generally a  miserable SOB, you come to care about him and want to protect him from the  evils around--much like Andy, his young friend.  Speaking of Andy, Russell  Crowe is delightful.  A bit of warning though:  this ain't Maximus of  ""Gladiator"".  Crowe is an incredibly diverse actor, ranging from  the likable guy-next-door (""Sum of Us"", ""Proof"") to  imploding/exploding rage (""Quick and the Dead"", ""LA  Confidential"", ""The Insider"" and ""Gladiator"").  If  you are looking for the latter, this is not the movie for you.  You'll be  bored and wonder if the body from the ""rage"" flicks were just creative  lighting (no.....he just pumped up for ""Romper Stomper"" and never bulked  down).  But if you want to see Crowe smile and giggle uncontrollably, check  this out.  Overall, it's a moving, funny yet thought-provoking film that  makes you think about what ""proof"" we all need in our lives.",958608000,89,1537,4.968253968253968

660461,4,6303422977,"This is a very good movie on the concept of truth and people's obsession for the search of it. It deals with what truth is and is not, and questions whether you can trust someone who has lied to you before. Jocelyn Moorhouse  has certainly given a clever answer to all these questions, not ever  letting down her wit.",921715200,,317,4.3559322033898304
660462,4,6303422977,"34. PROOF (drama, 1991) Martin (Hugo Weaving) has been blind from birth. Unloved by his mother because of his handicap, she would lie to him when describing the outside world. Because of this Martin does not rely on  anyone and instead takes photos that serve to 'proof' of things he can't  see. He meets Andy (Russell Crowe) young kitchen-hand whose simple honesty  Martin comes to trust. They become friends and for the first time Martin is  able to trust someone. Celia (Genieve Picot) is in love with Martin ever  since she started working as his housekeeper. Though Martin doesn't love  her he keeps her on because it makes him feel good. They both like the idea  of controlling each other in different ways. Celia's jealousy, though,  causes her to destroy Martin's newfound friendship.
Critique: Perceptive  character study was written and directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse. Her feminine  touch shines through as deceit; trust and jealousy are the main themes  (similar to a soapy). The interesting (masochistic) relationship of the 3  characters is fun to watch. They are all damaged people looking to feed off  someone else so their egos can be mended somewhat. In a way, the story is  also about obsession and how Martin's handicap makes it all the more  difficult to fight back. There are also hysterical touches of comedy, such  as when Martin is taught by Andy to drive a car for the first time and are  pulled over by police. Made in 1991, at a time when Australian films were  making a resurgence ('Death in Brunswick', 'Romper Stomper', etc), Proof  has 'proven' to be the best of the lot. Great musical score by the group  'Not Drowning, Waving'.

660513,5,6303422977,"Who knew that there was a movie with the same title as the Gwyneth Paltrow 'Proof,' that would be so much better? They are very different movies, it's true. But this Russell Crowe film has more skill in every aspect - the acting, the plot, the script. And it's Australian. Who knew?

In the film, there's a scene that takes place at a drive-in movie. I was laughing so hard that I had tears. The characters act in ways that almost make you think there could be a crime to the story, but no. Simple life with people who have to deal with a disability and people who seek to profit from that. The motives are not so clear.

The acting is first-rate. From the very beginning, with a scene that culminates in an animal hospital, I was hooked. This was as good as I hoped.",1487203200,2,767,4.2465753424657535

660773,4,6303422977,"A quick clarifier-- 2 other productions, unrelated, share this title, so search via Amazon, 2004, with the names of leads.  Martin (Hugo Weaving), a bitter blind 30ish man, thinks he has devised a foolproof solution for affirming reality by photographing it.  He aims a camera in the vicinity of the subject or has someone direct it, shoots the image and then drafts someone else to define and interpret the scene. Andy ( Russell Crowe), a restaurant worker, is enlisted to carry out those tasks. Celia (Genevieve Picot), Martin's ostensible housekeeper, turned adoring seductress, resorts to some deception to ensnare him. Even Andy lies a bit to cover for her. The irony is that much of Martin's antipathetic, distrustful behavior, in attempting to prevent being pitied, seems to elicit no pity but yes, trickery and deception  The origins of his distrust are visited and explored in flashbacks. Jocelyn Moorhouse is the skilled writer/director. All filmmaking disciplines unite successfully. The acting is first-rate. The notion of likability is prominent. Among the 3 main characters are one who is not at all pleasing, one who is almost tolerable, and one who is fairly winning. Utilization of ambient sound is exceptional in enhancing the storyline and amplifying that sense for the blind protagonist. It also serves as a key element in engaging the viewer in that specific sensory experience. It's a solid film. Recommend.",1480550400,4,1429,5.2043478260869565

660778,5,6303422977,"Initially the movie made me think even more about just how vulnerable Folks with DisAbilities are when hey have to rely on strangers to help them. Because of the disability they are quite dependent on people who can and do take advantage of them, steal and abuse them. This extra vulnerability and the difficulty of trusting someone where you have no choice is pretty stressful. But beyond the obvious disability vulnerability, everyone has a need and desire to be able to trust someone completely and if one does that, ignoring everything else, the heart is completely vulnerable as well. The acting was superb.  The issue of trust once broken healing is a tough one for everyone as we are all vulnerable. How horrible to spend your life questioning those closest.  The other option is just not let anyone in. Definitely a thoughtful & thought provoking movie.  The Elven King who played the man who was blind was amazingly good in particular.",1479427200,6,944,4.850931677018633

660844,3,6303422977,"This movie could as easily been titled ""TRUST"" or possibly ""Do mothers really lie to their sightless children?"" Hugo W. plays a character who is a blind photographer. Not a professional photographer but one who takes pictures of scenes that are described to him by a person he trusts. This person has a great responsibilty to describe the scene just as it really is. Any deviation or deception creates a distrust for that person and also brings back some very painful memories for Hugo from his childhood. As a sightless child he depended on his mother to describe the world he could not see. He felt she was deceiving him as a punishment for being blind. This is the seed for the obstacle of trusting any or all people who he allows to enter his dark world. This is the running theme throughout the film. Can you build a friendship without trusting that person. A young Russel C. is one of these new friends if he can be trusted. There are tests that he must first pass to enter this very very small circle. The film ends on whether Russel has passed or failed. It is further complicated by his housekeeper(female) who he believes  is a constant challenge to him on all levels of trust and friendship.
 ""Proof"" as a title is more accurate of this films theme from here on. How can anyone really prove that he or she can be trusted? How far does one have to go to earn this privilege ? Thats the hook in this film. There is such distrust from his childhood that it seems there is no limits to how far one must go to earn his friendship. And why would you work so hard to be a friend if you were thought untrust worthy. These are good questions raised in this film. It just doesnt seem worth the effort.. So why do these people work so hard at it. Where do the hang ups really lay? In a person who works under the assumption that no one can be trusted. Or is it the person(s) who is/are pushing hard to earn an impossible trust. These are some pretty disfunctional people. Yet we are given to believe the problem is that of only Hugo's perception of trust. Is he proved to be right or wrong?
There is one heartbreaking scene .It is very powerful in showing how deep this distrust of his own mother went when he was a child .From this nightmare flashback you begin to believe this man never will or can develop any true friendships. Or maybe just maybe there is a bit of light that will come through.",1432944000,9,2398,4.338530066815145

660846,4,6303422977,"Proof is about the need for trust between people which is based on truth, but there is likelihood of lies and half-truths. Martin(Hugo Weaving) has been blind since birth and he feels his mum told him lies because he was born blind. She bought him a camera(which he asked for) so he could take pictures of the world around him. He even doesn't believe his mother when she said she is going to die,even when the coffin is in his home, he believes it's hollow. He gets friends to describe the photos to him so that he can have proof that what he sensed is what they saw. He trusts no one except the camera that has replaced his eyes. By taking photos, Martin has proof that the world he senses is the same one other people see. Martin has never known anyone he trusts enough to describe his photos to him. Martin is a bitter,distrustful man who lacks the faith to believe what he has been told. The camera may never lie, but to Martin people do lie, preferring to tell him what he wants to hear,or even, cruelly
misleading him.

One day Martin strikes up a friendship with the younger Andy(Russell Crowe),who becomes his regular `talking eyes',who has a down-to-earth honesty and kindness that touches him. Martin knows a 2nd person, Celia (Genevieve Picot),his housekeeper, whom he treats with contempt,yet she loves him. When she reveals this love,he responds with vicious malice. Inevitably,she and Andy are drawn together,with results that shatter the already fragile nature of the characters' relationships. Moorhouse's edgy film is more about metaphorical, wilful blindness than physical sight impairment. Martin is unable to trust unless provided with tangible proof. And yet he then refuses to accept the evidence. Not only can he not see what is in front of his face, he deliberately won't `see' the truth in others. He lives to be betrayed, he encourages and feeds on deception. all 3 actors bring immense presence to their roles and the writing is well organised,the dialogue effective. A good 1st film from Jocelyn Moorhouse. Crowe shows his future promise in an understated performance. Weaving has force.",1429920000,,2116,4.861495844875346

660848,5,6303422977,"This review is an excerpt from my book Killer Bs: The 237 Best Movies On Video Youve (Probably) Never Seen, which is available as an ebook on Amazon. If you enjoy this review, there are 236 more like it in the book (plus a whole lot more). Check it out!

PROOF: Seeing is believingunless you're blind. Martin (Weaving) was born sightless, and apparently trustless as well. He is certainly correct in refusing to trust Celia, who lusts after him even while tormenting him. The intricate, tangled web they weave, locked in this cruel battle of wills, is the hinge of the film, and could be analyzed at book length: for her, its a love/hate relationship; for him, shes the pitiful oneand as long as he refuses to indulge her, she cant pity, but only hate, him.

Weaving is sour, dour and marvelously cynical, and Crowe is charmingthink young Mel Gibsonas the irrepressible, admittedly irresponsible Andy, ironically responsible for the films lightest moments, as well as its deepest. And Picot creates a unique and memorable character in Celia, a person more vulnerable and truly crippled than Martin could ever be.

It is bittersweet and you can't help feeling protective and yet angry with the main character.  You also feel sympathy for the loveless horny housekeeper who wants to be his girlfriend and ultimately his wife.

660941,5,6303422977,"Whatever else it might be, the 1991 Australian motion picture Proof (not to be confused with the 2005 American movie) is a film that irresistibly compels a viewer to imagine life without the sense of sight. It's harder than ever to find originality in storytelling, but Proof achieves that rarity with its off-kilter tale of Martin, a paranoid, blind photographer (yes, that's what he is) living in Melbourne, Australia, who ponders whether or not his mother abandoned him by faking her death during his own childhood, because at her funeral the testimony of his sensitive hands compelled the young Martin to believe her casket was in fact empty. Living a life of comfortable privilege yet an existence devoid of an ability to bond with most others, Martin snaps photographs at random in a nearby park, then seeks out the sighted to describe the pictures to him. Martin's often cruel housekeeper, Celia, who harbors a seething, acidic form of love for her caustic employer, oversees the care of Martin, yet also undertakes tiny but effective cruelties against him, such as her frequent re-arranging of household furnishings, which confuses the blind man and also presents a hazard to him as he plods through his home. Martin's newfound friend, Andy, a dishwasher at a local restaurant, played to expected perfection by the always brilliant Russell Crowe, presents a threat to the cold Celia, who in a perverse ploy makes love to Andy in an effort to alienate his affection for Martin. There is also a later attempted seduction of the alternately pathetic and odious Martin, Celia's war of cruelties escalates, and the ending arrives with either a moment of liberation or a profound rejection of love, however it might be perceived by the individual viewer. As I said, Proof is certainly a cinematic original.",1204848000,,1808,5.009966777408638
660942,3,6303422977,"Proof (Jacqueline Moorhouse, 1991)

These days, anyone who remembers Proof probably does so because it contains a young Russell Crowe, something I was unaware of when I first tacked it onto my ever-growing list of movies to watch; I knew it was an early Hugo Weaving film (and discovered it because it has the same name as the decent-but-overrated Jake Gyllenhaal flick from a few years ago), which was enough to spark my interest. All I had to do was read a description of Weaving as a blind photographer, and I was in.

Turns out Proof was actually pretty well known in its day, having picked up a slew of Australian Film Institute awards and a Golden Camera at Cannes. Didn't do a great deal of box office, but that's rarely an indication of whether a movie's actually good or not. But Hugo Weaving and Russell Crowe when they were both still relative unknowns? How can you go wrong?

Weaving, as I mentioned, plays Martin, a blind photographer, while Crowe is Andy, a dishwasher at a local restaurant. To complete the triangle, we have Celia (veteran TV actress Genevieve Picot), Martin's housekeeper, who's a bit in love with him. Martin and Andy meet after a mishap in which Martin stumbles over some of the restaurant's garbage in the alley, injuring a local stray cat; Martin and Andy take the cat to the vet and bond. Soon Andy meets Celia, and the stage is set.

Moorhouse (A Thousand Acres), who also wrote the script, came up with something potentially quite powerful, but there are pieces of it that never quite gel. Martin's take on why he refuses to return Celia's affections comes off as facile, and seems to serve no purpose other than to set up a possible love triangle; Celia herself doesn't really impress as someone who'd be willing to sit around and take it. Only Andy, played to a T by Crowe, comes off as truly genuine here (which is ironic, considering Andy is a completely surface creature, ruled entirely by his instincts).

An interesting movie, but not an especially accomplished one. Worth checking out to see two wonderful actors when both were still rising stars, a year or two away from each's breakout performance. ** ",1192060800,4,2152,4.694960212201591
660943,5,6303422977,"One of the more impressive features in `Proof' is that it manages to strike a chord in the viewer almost unknowingly.  It really wasn't until the film was finished that I realized just how much of an impact that small film can have.  It perfectly addresses the need for total and complete trust but balances that out with the need for forgiveness, the need for patience and the need for understanding.  The film spends a great deal of time building trust with the audience, helping them to understand why it's characters need each other the way that they do and then it effortlessly snaps the trust in two and demands the audience decide the moral road to take.  It shows the frustration that comes with frigid demands and how we can ultimately end up alone if we refuse to give any slack.  No one is perfect and this film helps show the importance of understanding that very fact and conceding to it.

The film revolves around Martin, played by Hugo Weaving, a blind man who takes photographs of his surroundings as proof of his existence.  By a chance meeting at a restaurant he meets busboy Andrew, played by Russell Crowe, and an immediate friendship is sparked.  The film does a wonderful job, all the way down to the boyishly free spirited score, of building the feeling of childlike friendship.  The two of them truly have fun together and we have fun watching them interact.  Andrew is the type of guy every other guy wants to be friends with, and Crowe's portrayal is so convincing and natural the audience just can't take their eyes off of him.  Weaving, while not the greatest actor in the world, delivers here as well, playing reclusive and unsure and tortured by a childhood unwanted well enough.  His performance comes off a bit tense and stiff in some scenes but is forgivable.  It's easy to see why he was chosen for the role of Agent Smith in `The Matrix' for he exhibits that stiff and proper delivery even when he should be relaxed.

The true crutch of the film lies on the shoulders of Celia, Martin's housekeeper.  Harboring a crush on Martin that he doesn't dare embrace, Celia starts to resent him as he resents her.  It boils down to frustrated attraction, even on the part of Martin.  He's attracted to her but he doesn't trust her and so he repels her.  Genevieve Picot does a fantastic job playing Celia with enough sass and cattiness yet underlining sadness that we can feel for her as much as we understand Martin's reservations.  When she begins to target Andrew, who has no problem embracing her advances, the bond between Martin and Andrew is threatened.

Crowe, while very young here, commands his role with such fervor and dedication and natural charm that it would be easy to predict he'd be an Oscar winner.  While he allows others to shine he still proves to be the most talented of the cast in question.  His performance is the most memorable and his character is the most relatable.  Picot also deserves praise for creating a wonderfully memorable character in Celia.  She's an utter standout.  The final confrontation between Andrew and Martin lays the groundwork for this entire film and the feeling and morale that it should impress upon the audience.  Everybody lies, just not all the time, and how true and important is that very fact!",1182988800,,3279,4.668989547038327
660944,5,6303422977,"Jocelyn Moorhouse has written and directed one of if not THE most original screenplay to come along in years. PROOF concerns itself with the issues of trust and obsession.

Martin has photographs everything to prove he and the world exist. In his employ is a seemingly cold-hearted and vindictive housekeeper named Celia,played with the utmost cruelty by Genevieve Picot. Even Charles Dickens would have admired this viciously dark and shady lady! Enter Andy,a cook in a restaurant,played by a younger Russell Crowe already displaying the talent that would later win him an Oscar. Martin and Andy develop a bond of trust and friendship. Andy begins to interpret Martin's photos for him thus enabling Martin to further trust him. Celia,obsessed with Martin the nearly four years of her employment,sets out to destroy the bond the two men forge,and that is when this film gets so tense that from moment to moment you will be looking over your shoulder!

This movie was facinating, a great look at the weight trust carries in a relationship and how it can easily be minipulated and twisted and all together abused.  Some say that this is one of the only films were Crowe doesn't outshine his fellow actors, but to tell you the truth he is still by far the best here.  Hugo is not the greatest of actors, but this my friends is his tryumphant performance...the best of his career.  The woman who plays Celia is wonderful, you hate her and love her and hate to love her.  Hugo does very well as Martin and there were even times when my wife cried becasue she felt so sorry for him.  He played his role brilliantly.  But it was none other than Crowe who stole the show bringing charm and devotion to his role.  It was nice to see him laughing and smiling alot.  He looks so young in this film, but still has that dignified air about him.  He is a true Aussie legend.  Watch this film not only for the brilliant acting but for a strong lession in trust and betrayal and how we should be willing to 'pity' sort-of speak those who fall short of our expectations.

661023,5,6303422977,"Proof, an Australian film, stars Hugo Weaving as Martin, a man obsessively distrustful of the world, so much so he feels he has to take photos of everything around him, as proof they really exist. Uno-teeny-tiny problemo. He's blind. So he has to find someone he can trust to describe the photos to him. The person he chooses is Andy, a kitchen worker at a local restaurant, played by a very young looking Russell Crowe.

Hugo Weaving as Martin displays his trademark intelligence and sensitivity. Martin is smarter than hell but socially maladept. Andy is a charming ne'er-do-well who accepts the ""job"" of being Martin's eyes out of a combination of pity, what-the-hell, and actual liking for the guy.

Genevive Picot does a fine job as Celia, Martin's housekeeper who is intensely attracted to him and regularly tries to seduce him - advances he routinely rejects. Genevive's Celia is obsessive, manipulative, domineering, rude and yet still, in some bizarre, disturbing fashion, sexy. And if you think that's easy....try it some time.

As the movie starts, Martin's life is extremely regimented and limited. His only real relationship is one of conflict with Celia whom he keeps at arms length. But still he endures the pressure of her advances, her attempts at manipulation, the little cruelties when she's displeased with him and deliberately moves objects into his path for him to trip over. His relationship with her may be sick, but she's all he has. Celia had the job of describing Martin's photos to him before Martin gave the job to Andy because - for good reason - he doesn't trust Celia.

We have two great actors (and one great actress) in this film, all doing extraordinary work. In a quiet way, this movie is about Martin battling for his soul, fighting to become a whole human being. His relationship with Andy is the first time in his life he's ever reached out to another person. It's the story of how this friendship between very different individuals, its rewards and disappointments, gives Martin the strength to make badly needed changes in his life.

Favorite line of the movie: ""I forgot."" Trust me, in the context it's delivered, this is absolutely hilarious. My girlfriend, after watching Proof with me, for weeks and months afterward, would suddenly look at me and say, ""I forgot,"" before bursting into laughter.

Proof is a superb film, an actor's movie with performers fully up to the job. To quote Roger Ebert - though he was talking about a different show - ""I just want to hug this movie.""",1067472000,7,2522,4.8534883720930235

I'll leave the plot to the other reviewers. This is a tiny film, with only four characters, one of them dead. Hugo Weaving is so good as the blind photographer that I was amazed when I saw him in ""Priscilla: Queen Of The Desert"" and realized that he wasn't actually blind.
The movie also contains one of the funniest scenes in all moviedom, ending when the doctor examines Weaving's eyes and says: ""You've been blind since birth. Why were you driving?""

661026,5,6303422977,"This film has been an important adjunct to a lecture I do for mental health professionals on the meaning, importance and function of keepsakes in grief and in lifelong individuation.  The lecture has underlying themes of the powerful impact of pathological beliefs on our lives and also shows that decathecting brings hope.  So does this film.
  Proof is about Martin, a blind photographer on a mission to find someone he can trust.  Someone who can tell him the truth contained in a keepsake photograph he has kept in a safe for over 30 years.  A photograph he took at 10 years of age.  The photo will either confirm or deny his inner belief that his mother hated him for being blind and that she was embarrassed by him.  He believed that she lied to him because she could,in order to punish him for being blind, because, he felt, she wanted a ""normal"" child.  He believed that she didn't really die, that she left him, because she wanted to.
  During the film, Martin's inner belief system, the belief that no one can be trusted is challenged as he develops a bond with Andy, played by Russel Crowe.  Their relationship has heartwarming moments that provide experiences to force Martin to rethink his inner beliefs.  But as my husband reminds me, Martin is developmentally crippled.  Just as he's never experienced male bonding in his earlier life, he has never experienced love with a woman.  He runs from a seduction scene with his vindictive (and complicated) housekeeper.  We see a scene afterwards where he begins to cry and we sense that he is beginning to grieve and to make more conscious connections about the impact of his belief system on his life.  As Martin learns a new idea, that there are trustworthy souls who can be enjoyed, that new experience is ultimately stronger than the betrayal that ultimately tests his friendship with Andy and their relationship survives the betrayal.  Martin learns to accept the imperfection in human experience.  In the end, Martin realizes that his mother had not lied to him and that his inner belief is not true.  He is finally able to decathect from the punative unyielding belief with his deceased mother, to begin to grieve her loss and to decathect from his most precious keepsake.  We see he is able to make better relationship choices, to free himself from the repetition compulsion with his vindictive housekeeper as he is able to fire her in the end and as he struggles to accept the ambivalence in human relationships and in his relationship with Andy.
  In the end, we imagine him being able to put his cathartic energy elsewhere and to move ahead in his life to take risks in forming closer personal relationships.  Martin is finally unlocked from his past and is more able to enjoy his present and to begin to imagine a different kind of future.
  While my review hasn't focused on the triangular betrayal that evolves in this film, the important point in the talk that I give is that Martin's cathartic energy is initally so passionately tied up in his mother and in the keepsake that he is chained to his past.  The attachment to Andy begins to change his life so that he can decathect his energy from his deceased mother and from the keepsake and move forward.  Decathecting brings him hope for a different kind of future.",1036627200,5,3290,4.714535901926445

661028,5,6303422977,"This low-budget film from down-under is a character-study of three everyday people, played by Hugo Weaving, Genevieve Picot, and Russell Crowe. Be warned that it does not have a happy Hollywood ending, and similar to ""Secrets and Lies"", is more character rather than action-driven.
Weaving, who later stars in ""The Matrix"", shows his trademark sterness as a blind photographer and misanthrope.  He has lost touch with humanity, scarred by a notion since childhood that his mother had rejected him because of his handicap.  To verify what he senses, he photographs his surroundings.  He has a seemingly cold-hearted housekeeper, who he torments.  She continues to work for him because she's secretly in love with him and his dependence on her at least partially satisfies her desires.  Their relationship becomes threatened when he befriends a dishwasher at a local restaurant.  Weaving's character trusts the dishwasher, Andy, played by a young Russell Crowe, to describe the photos he takes.  Fearing that she'd be displaced, the housekeeper sets out to discredit Andy and makes her moves on both Andy and Weaving.
The performances are all superb.  Picot shows the vulnerability of a woman who masks her loneliness with a cold exterior.  As the film progresses, the viewer increasingly sympathizes with her.  Her character is the most interesting of the three.  And reminiscent of a young Mel Gibson, a lean and not-yet-so-masculine Crowe plays Andy with sensitivity, innocence, and a hunkiness and easy-going down-to-earthness that he'd project in his later films.

The character of Celia is truly an original and her little tricks on Martin fasinated me. But I have to say that watching Russell put a tea-cup down on a table was pure cinematic pleasure. The drive-in movie sequence is so original and I have to agree that all three characters are so well drawn.
Rent it, buy it. A wonderful film.",994204800,5,726,4.466165413533835
661091,5,6303422977,"I first discovered ""Proof"" a year ago on the Independent Film Channel, and thank God for it.  The film is akin in quality to that great period of American cinema from ""Midnight Cowboy"" through ""Ordinary People"", featuring imperfect characters playing out their imperfect lives, hidden amongst the masses of the world and their misery only for us to see.
The plot is about a blind man without trust, a desperate woman without love, a young man without direction, and what happens when their three paths intersect.  No one character is without blame, and each word and action is understood for better or for worse by the audience.  It is a simple story (""Proof"" being the term that serves as a benchmark by which trust is gained) wrung through the complexities of people and of life.
Two of the film's stars, Hugo Weaving of ""Matrix"" and ""LoTR"" fame and Russell Crowe of ""Gladiator"" and ""LA Confidential"" fame, have gone on to recent and popular success.  I can only hope that this leads to more exposure of this film, a small Australian production that is as well-executed, well-written, and well-acted as any classic American cinema.  ""Proof"" is worth a video store search or purchase.  It is truly a diamond in the rough.",991353600,20,1222,4.795238095238095
661092,5,6303422977,"If you're blind people can fool you.  They can lie to you.  And if you're a photographer and you are blind, who will believe you?  You need proof, and this is what Martin (Hugo Weaving) seeks.  He is a man who projects onto others the lovelessness of his own soul. He believed as a child that his mother died to get away from the shame of having a son who was blind.  Even as an adult he believed she lied to him.  He goes to the mortuary and is led to her grave where he reads the head stone with his fingers.  He asks the mortician if a coffin is sometimes buried empty.  The mortician asks why anyone would do that.  Martin suggests a prank.  The mortician replies, ""Seems like a pretty expensive prank.""  Martin spends his whole life obsessively seeking proof because he can trust no one.  Until he meets Andy.  He trusts Andy.
It hardly need be said that Andy, played with boyish charm and just the right amount of discovery by Russell Crowe, will both disappoint Martin and teach him a lesson.  Martin certainly needs some kind of lesson.  He exploits his housekeeper Celia's obsessive love for him, tormenting her by keeping her on, while denying her love as he inflicts little humiliations.  For her part Celia, played with a penetrating and desperate sexuality by Genevive Picot, mothers him and seeks to dominate.  She wants to keep Martin dependant on her in the hope that someday he will seek her love.  She controls his life, teaching the dog to prefer her and to come to her when signaled.  In her frustration she plays little tricks on Martin, such as putting objects in his path so he will run into them.  When Andy threatens to become important to Martin, predictably she seduces him.  Thus we have our triangle.  Andy also serves as an objectifying device to underscore the obsessions of Martin and Celia.
Jocelyn Moorhouse wrote and directed this original little masterpiece of dark humor from down under.  She carefully worked out the character-driven story so that humor and tragedy are in balance and we experience the revelations from the perspective of all three characters.  Nothing is fake or hackneyed and no one point of view is preferred.  She has the gift of seeing more than one side of the human condition, and it is this gift that makes her scenes so effective.  Note that the drive-in theater scene depends on our knowing what Martin is doing and why, while seeing his actions from the point of view of the bikers.  He faces the bikers from the driver's seat in the next car and holds up a packet of prophylactics.  The biker guy looks over and thinks that he is being taunted by a ""fag""
I have seen Moorehouse's ""How to Make an American Quilt (1995)"", which also explored the underlying psychological motives of human beings, but this is a better film.  It will be interesting to see what she does next.",983750400,14,2838,4.575396825396825
661093,4,6303422977,"I can't believe that they don't even have Russell Crowe listed in the cast. He steals the whole movie, as usual, giving a great performance as a young friend of the blind man. In this you get to see Russell's growth as an actor. Of course, now, I don't believe there is any part he can't play. It is worth buying the film if you are a true Russell Crowe fan.",973209600,2,358,4.056338028169014

661095,5,6303422977,"I first saw this film in a film class I took at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, back in 1994. I was completely taken with this movie. I did not know who Russell Crowe or Hugo Weaving were then, but now i look for and go see any movie with them in it. This wonderful story of how far mistrust and deceit can go appeals to everyone. The story is completely told in Weaving's face. He hardly has to speak to see the emotions that Martin (his character) is going through in every scene. Crowe is wonderful as the innocent used by Martin's housekeeper Celia to destroy Martin and his trust. THis is Proof that Australia is a country to reckon with in talent and great movies. Buy it NOW!!!",970358400,2,697,4.32824427480916
661096,5,6303422977,"It is easy to understand why Jocelyn Moorehouse won all kinds of awards in  this, his first major motion picture.  The writing is excellent: the  characters supremely well-developed and the story itself compeling.  A  blind man, traumatized in his childhood by his mother's imagined betrayal,  seeks to prove that his experience of the world is true by taking pictures  of his world and having someone describe the photos while he labels them in  braile. This is is how he meets and makes a connection with a humble,  blue-collar worker named Andy (a very young Russell Crowe).  Andy's  influence might help the man come to terms with life, but his housekeeper,  jealous of their friendship, seduces Andy and makes him violate the trust  built up between the two acquaintances.  Hugo Weaving's portrayal is  devastating.",965520000,2,820,5.06015037593985
661097,5,6303422977,"This is like the best 3 part, ensemble, black box play where each character is perfectly attuned to the other and we are right there with them feeling everything.
All I can say is see this movie or listen to it  if you have to.
It's also the first time I realized you don't want to  hand Russell Crowe an inanimate object unless you want him to do something  with it.  I've made my actor friends watch the tea cup scene.  Just let his  face tell the story.",961286400,,456,4.125
661098,5,6303422977,"""Proof"" is, for me, a masterpiece-giving me everything and more that I could hope for in a great work of art.
The superb script, dialogue, camera placement, acting, and new insights-they are all there on screen.  The director never makes a false move, inviting us into the lives of these  three people and leaving us wanting to know more.
Years from now, when  most of what is churned out in Hollywood and elsewhere has long been  forgotten, Proof will remain as a testament to what can be accomplished  when the artists are truly gifted-and Moorhouse, Crowe, Picot, Weaving, and  ""Not Drowning, Waving"" {who provide the musical soundtrack} certainly show  us the way.
This great film gives us even more with repeat viewings and  is an excellent source of discussion and sharing.
I'm eagerly waiting for  this film to be released on DVD.",959472000,6,837,4.838028169014085
