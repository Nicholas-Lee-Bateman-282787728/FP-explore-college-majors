8152706,2,B000JRYOQ0,Nothing at all of what I would expect from a hooked on phonics type program. The songs are cheesy and the people are lip synching.,1393545600,,130,4.24
8152707,5,B000JRYOQ0,My 15 month old granddaughter absolutely loves this DVD - She loves Twinkle Twinkle Little Star anyway and this just captures her attention from beginning to end.  Very calming DVD.,1387670400,,181,5.033333333333333
8152708,2,B000JRYOQ0,The animation is terrible.  It was boring.  I had to walk away after about 10 minutes.  I like baby signing time and leap frog dvds much better.,1351468800,,144,4.2592592592592595
8152709,4,B000JRYOQ0,This DVD is pretty educational but also fun for my two year old who never wants to sit still. This DVD is exactly what we were looking for .. Educational and kinda like the phonics my husband and I grew up on! Good buy.. Could be longer though,1337040000,3,243,4.083333333333333
8152710,4,B000JRYOQ0,My baby got one of these hooked on reading video and book as a gift! He liked the books since very little (4mo)and LOVED the videos starting at about 7mo.  We are not big fans of letting our kids watch TV.  But we did let them watch this series (3 videos/3books)a couple of times per week!  It is great to see babies light up when they see the characters and pay attention to the sounds of nursery rhymes! It is great to also see them attempt some of the movements themselves! only downside is that it can get repetetive and a little annoying to adults.  But babies love and thrive on repetition so we put up with it!,1291075200,,617,4.203389830508475
8152711,3,B000JRYOQ0,"My 18 month old, 3 1/2 year old and 6 year old like this but they'll watch just about anything.  It IS cute.  The 3 animal characters are cheerful and sweet.  The graphics for the nursery rhymes aren't' real impressive.  I like the series of rhyming words shown with real world objects. The repetition is good for the education aspect of the DVD.  It just doesn't seem like they took much time to develop it.  I think these companies like the fact that they can produce a film very inexpensively and kids will watch it.",1229472000,,519,4.410526315789474
8152712,5,B000JRYOQ0,my daughter was 9 months old when she was gifted this from the grandparents.  It encourages a joy for reading when followed along with the book.,1228003200,,144,4.538461538461538
8152713,5,B000JRYOQ0,"I have all the Baby Einstein collection for newborn babies and I got to say. I bought this one at the mall yesterday, cause I asked for Baby Einstein and they didn't have.
My baby usually fusses to sleep, I have to rock her and sing to her on the hammock and then move her to the craddle.
She slept last night, this morning and this afternoon with this video. If I put her alone she'll look at it and don't even blink, with Baby Mozart from Baby Einstein when the slow music plays she cries (maybe she thinks I am trying to force put her to sleep, cause we also have the lullaby cds of BE) but this dvd is AMAZING!
Baby Einstein moms, TRY this one!!!
Yasmin is 4 months and she LOVED it!",1186099200,2,687,4.0588235294117645
