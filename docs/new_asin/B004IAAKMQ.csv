8430500,5,B004IAAKMQ,We have shown this video to graduate mental health counseling students who are specializing in family and relationship therapy in their final semester of the graduate program. It is impactful and very memorable to them as they begin considering their career direction in relationship therapy. I highly recommend this video not only for training but also to get a very special sense of the amazing vision Yumi and Hedy have developed for the sacredness of intimacy and the potential healing power of relationship. This is a turning point perspective in a partnership!,1471392000,2,566,5.163043478260869
