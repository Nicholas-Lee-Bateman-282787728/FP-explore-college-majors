7853239,5,6303608345,"It took the better part of a decade to make the four seasons of ReBoot, and it was a decade which saw breathtaking changes in computer graphics technology.
This early episode is charming for many reasons...the great characters, the witty writing, the innocent enthusiasm of Mike the TV. But if you were lucky enough to remember watching ReBoot when it first aired (as I do), it's fun to recall that this episode represented what was, at the time, the pinnacle of cgi. The show, like the technology, sure came a long way.
ReBoot was the first--and, by the way, the best--computer animated television series.",1057795200,4,606,4.836538461538462
7853240,4,6303608345,"The guitar duel at the end of the episode is worth the price of admission, and some of the jokes at the expense of the ABC network's bureau of standards and practices are great...
All in all, my second-favorite episode of the first two seasons of ReBoot...",1015545600,,256,4.468085106382978
7853241,5,6303608345,"This was one on my favorite episodes for two reasons.  One, it made fun of the D&D style computer games on the market.  Two, Mike the T.V. had a bigger role than in some of the other episodes.  The two mixed together was  hilarious.",962755200,2,232,4.204545454545454
7853242,4,6303608345,"This was the first episode I ever caught of the series called ""ReBoot"" back in the mid-90's.  The first thing that caught my eye was the fact that the entire series was computer generated (the first  computer generated series ever, actually).  Being a professional digital  animator, I was of course intrigued by the idea of a weekly children's  series done digitally.  But I soon became engrossed in the plot of this  clever series, which I discovered was not really created entirely for  children (the intricate plots, in-jokes, sight-gags, and pop culture  references are obviously aimed at more mature audiences).  I became a fan  for the entire U.S. run (two seasons, though a third aired in Canada where  the series originated...and was eventually broadcast here on the Cartoon  Network).
The series takes place in the world within the computer, with  its lead characters defending their very lives against the ""user""  when games are downloaded into their midst.  When a game arrives, the  characters ""Re-boot"" themselves to take on characteristics of the  game environment (thus the name of the series).
In this particular  episode our heroes are subjected to a multi-level wizards and warriors-type  game.  The added catch on this outing is the inclusion of ""Mike The  T.V."" a character known to irritate and cause havoc around our lead  characters with his ongoing ""Newscasts"" of all actions going on  around him.  How they get out of the situation and complete the game is  interesting and fun!",961459200,7,1504,5.061475409836065
