2688609,5,B000KE5WL8,"This classic is worth having in your collection. Gary Cooper does a great job, once again, and the character role he plays holds attention as well as the persecution he endures for the sake of the job he holds. A story of a man who is dedicated and is willing to sacrifice for his country to protect others.",1297814400,,307,4.310344827586207
2688610,4,B000KE5WL8,"Gary Cooper stars in this Civil War Western. Overall, it is a solid Western with an interesting plot (bad guys are helping the Confederates steal horses so Gary Cooper goes under cover to find out who is involved), with plenty of action to include the use of Springfield Rifles during some gun fights. Although the movie is not a classic, it is definitely worth watching, especially if you like Gary Cooper.",1271116800,,407,4.746478873239437
2688611,4,B000KE5WL8,It is a lot of cowboy fighting in the movie.  Really exciting if you like cowboy movies.,1252713600,,88,4.176470588235294
2688612,4,B000KE5WL8,"For me ""Coop"" didn't make any really GREAT westerns in the 50's with the expection of the classic High Noon! But he did make some entertaining entries, and this is one of them.
Shot almost totally on location at Lone Pine, Ca. in and around the Alabama Hills, the most photographed rocks in all of movie history, and using the background of the Eastern Sierras and Mt. Whitney with snow capped peaks, this makes for a pretty engaging western.

One of the co-stars is Lon Chaney Jr. AKA the Wolf Man in 41'. Coop and Chaney were buddies in real life and he was also the retired sheriff in High Noon for some extra info here. Be sure to check out what Coop does to Chaney with a knife! A first and maybe last time in any movie western or otherwise.

Andr De Toth the director did six westerns with Randolph Scott in the 50's, and in fact this is the same caliber of western that he did with ""Randy""! A good little western story with out to many complications; the good guys and the bad guys, lots of horses, gun play, and ""Coop"" wins in the end! Again, ha ha. Enjoy!",1184976000,9,1064,4.262376237623762
2688613,4,B000KE5WL8,"I am a big fan of Gary Cooper. Except for his High Noon, this falls with all the other Coop westerns. Always like cooper. And Andre DeToth is one of the best directors ever.",1168473600,2,173,4.117647058823529
2688614,4,B000KE5WL8,"It would be nearly impossible for Gary Cooper to follow up his Oscar-winning performance in High Noon with as great as a Western, but Springfield Rifle is more than rousingly entertaining. It is well-written and although it has some lapses in logic, it does have good plotting.

Cooper plays a disgraced Union major from Virginia who falls in with Confederate raiders who are stealing Union horses and supplying them to the Confederacy. Little do the raiders know that Cooper's disgrace is a counterintelligence plot by the Union to discover the leader of the raiders and to find out who is the Union traitor who is supplying the Rebels information.

Complete with fistfights, shootouts, and double crosses, this film does not hesitate in killing major characters off, but this is a necessity of the plot, otherwise, the movie wouldn't go anywhere. Cooper seems more virile and alive than he did in Springfield Rifle, and had not reached the level of his later Westerns, almost all of which were entertaining and enjoyable, but saw him playing a tired, world-weary man who just wants to find something to believe in. Cooper still seemed young and energetic enough to pull off a believable, engaging hero.

Springfield Rifle deserves a DVD release, if for no other reason that to display one of Gary Cooper's last vigorous Western performances.",1164931200,11,1343,5.013452914798206
2688615,3,B000KE5WL8,"Andr De Toth found his niche in Westerns... He directed ""Man in the Saddle,"" ""Last of the Comanches,"" ""The Stranger Wore a Gun,"" and ""The Indian Fighter"" with his cautious, distinguished way, and intelligent skill..

With a nice musical score by Max Steiner, his ""Springfield Rifle"" projects imagination and suspense...

Major 'Lex' Kearney (Gary Cooper), a Union officer, masterminds a counter-espionage scheme to undercover a gang of renegades who continually have top-secret informations regarding shipments of horses to the Confederacy... Cooper joins the confederates as a spy to unmask the traitor...

Phyllis Thaxter was effective in her small role as the wondering astonished wife (Erin) suffering with her son (Michael Chapin) who can't accept or understand the fact that his father was cashiered from the army for cowardice...

Lon Chaney, Jr. as a villain, and Philip Carey, as the valiant officer, contribute to the tense and violent atmosphere of the motion picture...

Filmed in Technicolor, ""Sprinfield Rifle"" follows Fred Zinnemann's great Western ""High Noon,"" and is basically a pretty entertaining routine Civil War Western...",1163030400,12,1144,5.551724137931035

2688624,3,B000KE5WL8,"One quickly understands that the gun that gives its name to the film is only a pretext to the Hungarian born director. For that matter, the Springfield Rifle will not be used before the end of the movie. No, De Toth's concern is elsewhere, rather in the description of the people's reactions when they learn that Gary Cooper is a traitor. This theme is recurrent in De Toth's filmography.

this is my opion only  every child  in  middle school needs to learn about the evolution
of who the ARMY adapted this weapon to it's modern day use
even  though the modern day use I'm referring to is in the 1800's
sure the plot was predictable and the Indians always got the shaft in the end

the Indians always get the short end of the stick

8155766,4,B000KE5WL8,"The movie, Springfield Rifle, was made in 1952 with Andr De Toth as director.  It stars Gary Cooper, now 51 yeas old.  Also appearing are Lon Chaney, Jr., a very young Fess Parker, Alan Hale Jr., and Martin Milner (to name a few).  The movie is 1 hour and 33 minutes long.  The film did not win and was not nominated for any awards.

The plot (during the Civil War) involves Major Lex Kearney (Cooper), who is dishonorably discharged from the army for cowardice in battle.  However, this is a cover to hide his true misson: to go undercover and to discover who is behind the Confederate raids against Union shipments of horses.  These horses are being captured and shipped South to help the Confederate cause.  Falling in with the gang of jayhawkers, he gradually gains their trust and is put in a position where he can discover who has been giving them secret information revealing the routes of the Union horse shipments. There are a few good twists and turns to the story, which will keep your attention.  Although Cooper is only 51 years of age, he appears older and the fist-fight sequences are a bit staged.  However, it is still vintage Cooper.

Some historic inaccuracies include a sequence where Cooper and Colonel Hudson (Paul Kelly) are seen using the  model 1873 Colt Army revolver.  This revolver was not invented yet since the film is set during the Civil War (1861-1865).  The Trapdoor Springfield rifle, the feature of this movie, was also not issued until 1873.  They talk about this rifle being a revolutionary single shot breechloading rifle that will win the war for the Union.  The Civil War actually had much better weapons invented, issued, and actually used in battle.  There was the 7-shot Spencer Rifle made famous by Wilder's Brigade out west and Custer's Brigade during Gettysburg.  There was the Henry rifle (the predecessor to the Winchester repeating rifle).  There was also the single shot breechloading Sharps rifle that was extensively used by many regiments.  There is another scene at the beginning of the movie, where General Halleck is wearing a crimson sash. As a General, he should be wearing a gold-colored sash.

There are a few humorous production goofs to look for.  When Captain Tennick (Philip Carey) is trying to line up a shot at the leader of the horse raiders, his neckerchief changes from a bright red plaid color to that of an off-white, then back and forth several times.  In another scene when they are attempting to drive out the horse thieves by burning them out, the wagon section that Kearney (Cooper) drove is twice pushed over the edge in flames.  There was only one wagon.  In yet another scene, after having escaped from the military prison with two of the horse rustlers, Kearney (Cooper) rides back into town with McCool (David Brian).  He has an empty holster the entire time. However, after dismounting in the corral he walks into town and has a revolver in his holster.  During the battle between the Union cavalry and the Confederates, Pete Elm's (Lon Chaney, Jr.) face is dirty, then clean, then dirty again between shots.

The movie is shot with an aspect ratio of 1.37:1.  The video and sound quality are both good and the colors are vivid (filmed in WarnerColor).  However, the night scenes are a bit dark.  Please keep in mind, however, that this is a DVD and please do not expect the video quality to be that of a 1080p Blu-ray.

The price is quite cheap (lunch is more expensive than this DVD).  It has a slim line case.  So, it won't take up hardly any space on your shelf.  The story line is interesting and it is vintage Gary Cooper.  So, I recommend it and because of Gary Cooper, I give it a generous 4 stars.",1375401600,2,3689,4.673913043478261
8155767,4,B000KE5WL8,"Fascinating account of espionage during the Civil War, set in the West.  Superb outdoor cinematograhy.  Max Steiner composed the music for the film, and, as is true with most of Steiner's compositions, it is heart-thumping, especially during the introduction.  I can almost sense the horses moving through the snow-clad mountain passes and the fog drifting thru the pine trees.  The story bogs down in the last 10min, but overall, I think this is a suspenseful movie.  Cooper is well cast.",1374019200,,489,5.0625
