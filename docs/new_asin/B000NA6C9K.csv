8176349,1,B000NA6C9K,"Video panning across Virgin Island marine charts. Occasional pans across what looks like postcard photos and rarely some actual video clips of VI....probably stock footage. The limited value of the skipper suggestions as to navigating thru VI could be better gleaned from a chart book. Furthermore, even then it was difficult to tell what the commentator was talking about unless you were already familiar with VI. Video rarely used any graphic pointer or highlighter to draw your attention to the relevant spot on the chart during the narrative. Better title would have been ""Reviewing a Chart of Virgin Islands Without Pointing at it""",1196380800,4,636,5.184466019417476
