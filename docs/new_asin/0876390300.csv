7793327,5,0876390300,"Excellent intro to a number of instruments (6+ selected via chapter menu).
Very good for someone who wants a foundation/taster  to the principal Latin percussion instruments.

Shame it does not also include notes for the patterns used, surprising coming from the Berklee School of Music.  !!!

Covers the following CLAVE (2-3 & 3-2), CONGAS (Tumbao & Mambo/Guajira), TIMBALES (Cascara & Mambo), BONGOS (Martillo),
GUIRO, CAMPANA-Bell(MAMBO, SON/BONGO sic), DRUMSET Snare Drum combination
When you have finished with this then you will be ready for the play along version 'The Rythmic Construction  of a Salsa Tune' Vol 1 with Pablo Chino Nunez [Latin Percussion]

The play along section could be beefed up - VERY WORTHWHILE DVD  - a THANKS to all involved.",1121731200,,756,5.25
