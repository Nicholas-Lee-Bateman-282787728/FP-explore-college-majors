8746190,3,B019WMTXRM,"Three Great Movies, but the DVDs are burned copys using old-fashioned type media (not M-Disc).

3 Excellent movies. Well-written and well acted.

I understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid $2 more a disc for M-Disc, a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movies on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.  The video and audio quality is excellent on the disc.

This review is for the product I received from Amazon. If you are after a ""Pure Movie Review"", I recommend the ""International Movie Database"".  There, you will find reviews unrelated to the delivery mechanism.

I highly recommend these 3 great movies.",1526256000,4,782,4.871212121212121
8746191,5,B019WMTXRM,"5 because I have always liked Ladd. It is a shame many reviews gave ""Lucky Jordan""  a bum rap.perfect film? no, but Ladd plays a great gangster type, and in the vein of ""Broadway takes on Berlin"" format it is great fun. He goes because he has to, but when he goes A.O.L, he suddenly see ""What we a fighting for"" and dispite the fact he is on the lamb, he does what can to keep America on top. Actor producer Sheldon Leonard tried to take over when lucky is in dutch. Great WWLL propaganda film. OSS good film of WWll era Ladd does well on this,",1515369600,2,544,4.08411214953271

8746194,3,B019WMTXRM,"As of this writing this box set is priced at $40 for three mediocre movies ..... way overpriced In my opinion!  A few weeks ago I bought Universal's Film Noir 10-Movie Spotlight Collection which contains three better Alan Ladd films (This Gun For Hire, The Glass Key and The Blue Dahlia) plus seven other films that include Double Indemnity and Touch of Evil ..... all for under $30 ..... much better films at a much better price.  Anyone considering this should take a serious look at that set, and wait for the price on this set to drop under $20.",1478908800,17,549,4.48
