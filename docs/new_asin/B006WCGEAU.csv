8505518,4,B006WCGEAU,This backcounrty guide is a must-have for newcomers to the area as well as veterans. The good doctor has picked classic tours in the Northwest and provides some tips about the terrain and powder stashes that it takes most skiers several years to learn. I've done several of the tours and still have something to learn. The video is of good quality and will get you ramped up for the upcoming snow season.,1342224000,,404,4.5479452054794525

8505520,5,B006WCGEAU,"This is the ultimate backcountry ski guide, combining detailed descriptions of the routes with 3D animations and video of the actual terrain so you'll know exactly where to go when planning a tour. And of course seeing the actual terrain being skied in deep powder, or under bluebird skies, or even both, just makes you want to get out there even more. The 10 trips covered hit the highlights of the boundless opportunities in Western Washington, and each offers several variations so you might learn something new even about places you've been before. The review of safe backcountry travel principles is a much appreciated bonus. Bottom line, whether you're an experienced bc skier or just getting started, if you're looking to explore some new terrain you'll love this DVD!",1331078400,,775,5.015503875968992
