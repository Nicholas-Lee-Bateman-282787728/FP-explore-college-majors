3909806,5,B002D755BW,I bought this as a Christmas present for my fiance to complete his collection. He loved this set and is watching them all over again!,1358640000,,133,4.36
3909807,5,B002D755BW,"TMNT started to lose ratings thanks to the popular Power Rangers, so the eighth season had major changes. The Turtles and April got a new design, the sky was no longer blue, but was now red, and there was a new opening song.

These episodes on Season 8 are:

Get Shredder!
Wrath of The Rat King
State of Shock
Cry H.A.V.O.C.!
H.A.V.O.C in the Streets
Enter:Krakus
Cyber-Turtles
Turtle Trek

This is the last season for Shredder and Krang as the main bad guys. I never saw the show during it's original airing, but I wished I did as this is truly the last season of what we knew of the TMNT. For season 9 & 10, the storylines became even darker.",1345507200,3,644,4.305785123966942
3909808,5,B002D755BW,"I haven't seen these episodes much. But if you love the original episodes, get it! The last episode is what I consider to be the last true episode before USA changed it up!",1309824000,,172,4.242424242424242
3909809,2,B002D755BW,"At this moment, this is the last Season of Turtles that got to get a release date while there's still two more seasons that still need to be released of the original series.  While this season was one of the seasons that featured less than 10 episodes and in which started taking the show in a different but darker feel to it.  With the new turn around in the series, this was the season and onward in which I never got to watch cause of not being able to catch the show on in my area at this particular season.  Although I wish that after this season set was released that the other 2 season sets got a release so that way some of us fans can have at least all the episodes amongst our DVD collections.  We may have to wait to see what Nickelodeon does with them owning the franchise to see what they'll do with this series.  Overall this set gets a 2.5 stars out of 5.",1279756800,,870,4.094117647058823
3909810,4,B002D755BW,"From this season on, everything you know about your favorite TV show will be changed. Taking the show in a new direction after 7 seasons of wacky, fun loving, silly, party time, type fun. This isn't the same Turtles you grew up with, but at the same time it is.

This whole season is only 8 episodes and was part of the CBS Saturday morning line up in 1994.  It was an attempt to make things darker, more mature and cater to an older male audience that had grown past the kinder gentler turtles and maybe were looking for something a bit more extreme.

Some of the things to take note of are: The nice clear blue sky's are gone for dark and dreary red colored ones. Buildings will be destroyed in almost every episode. Almost every moment is a battle or fight that the Turtles are involved in. The overall look of the characters has changed like April O'Neil now wearing a jacket over her usual yellow jump suit and the turtles masks allowing more of the turtles eyes to be seen through them.  Even Shredder is more evil taking great pride in destroying buildings and just being more of the bad guy the Turtles should have. They also won't be doing any ""Pizza Time"" during any of these episodes either. In fact I don't think they eat at all during any episode.

But in all these changes, the show is still really just the same show, just more extreme. The good guys always win. The same supporting cast is found within with cameos from some favorites of previous seasons. Like Casey Jones, Rat King, Irma, Vernon, Bern, and of course Master Splinter. And it's non stop fighting back and forth just with more explosions and destruction mixed in. There is even some moments when they break the 4th wall as per the old episodes and talking to the viewers at home. But that has been toned down a lot and will be few and far in between.

The problem with the season is that it was all written by the same person. So there are a lot of common themes through a lot of the episodes here. Fighting electric or energy based creatures that suddenly show up. A machine that can make mutants out of people suddenly and the various mutants that are now just more of the same after a few moments. Krang and Shredder wanting to do something in relation to Dimension X in every episode they do appear in. And the writer really seemed to be into destroying random buildings as stated earlier. Even the Channel 6 building gets leveled here. An episode with robot cyborgs seems to have said cyborgs just leveling rows of the city as if it were nothing. Also every episode seemed to have some ""science lab"" building some great device that enemies couldn't wait to exploit. So lets just say the fresh and new approach on the series became 8 very similar based episodes that are different in that it was cool to see the Turtles and their foes (both new and old) in these type of situations, when push comes to shove its really all the same stuff due to the one track minded writer handling this season.

Overall though its still a fun entry into the Turtles saga. Lets face it, after 7 seasons, things were getting a bit stale. You can only fight weird creatures, foil Shredders crazy ideas and eat pizza and make jokes for so long before it grows tired. This was a good attempt to keep the show running for another few seasons and there is nothing wrong with it in that aspect. It's a good watch and good price as well for the 8 episodes you get.  The episodes will definitely be darker and cater to an older audience but it isn't anything we really haven't seen before. They have fought many mutants in the past and foiled many of Krang and Shredder's plans in before, they do more of the same here. And honestly, it's actually a lot of fun.

New opening credits, new attitude but same ol Turtles mixed in. I say check it out. No it won't be the same as when the show started, but after 7 seasons things do tend to change no matter what show you are watching. And the cosmetic and minor changes are really just that. It's still the same ol Turtles that we are watching here and since I hardly watched the CBS episodes, this was a lost treasure to me to find out what happened next with my one time favorite heroes.

Check these out, you won't be sorry you did. Just put the past behind you and get ready to move forward. If you like explosions, mutant creatures and science labs, have I got the season for you...",1264204800,6,4391,4.370098039215686
3909811,1,B002D755BW,"The ninja turtles is my favorite cartoon ever.  Seasons 1,2,3,6, and 7 have dozens of classic episodes I have watched countless times.  There are also a handful of good or great episodes in seasons 4 and 5.  What was great about this show was its heart, its character development, and its never ending ways of keeping the stories and characters fresh even though you knew the turtles would always win in the end.  The voice cast was fantastic, and I was greatly saddened when James Avery (Shredder) left.  Seasons 8,9, and 10 veered so far from the turtle formula that I just cannot get into them.  They don't have character building, or the endless supply of jokes and poking fun.  The sky is always dark, the turtles or the bad guys are always super angry and violent.  I couldn't believe what happened to my favorite show.  Shredder and Krang, once larger than life, became tiny characters that the turtles or others would just whip against a light pole and tie up on the ground.  BeBop and Rocksteady lost all sense of comic relief.  I tested these shows out on my 7/11 year old nieces (who are over 25 years younger than I am).  They feel the exact same way as I do.  They have watched all of seasons 1-7 (twice) and love them.  They wouldn't even finish season 8.  Where is the pizza?  Why isn't anyone funny?  Why doesn't Shredder and Krang have any strength anymore? They asked me.  It is too bad that violence and darkness became the norm for cartoons in the mid 90's, as it put an end to the greatest cartoon ever.  If it were me, I would bring the cast of the Ninja turtles 1987-1996 back, offer them multi-million dollar contracts and start making shows like they did in the late 80's.  As my nieces prove, they would sell out.  Make some cartoon movies (not that live-action rubber puppet suit stuff)and some merchandise schemes and you would get your investment back in no time.  Turtle POWER!  Long live seasons 1-7 of the Ninja Turtles.",1260144000,11,1952,4.530085959885387
3909812,5,B002D755BW,"They might actually finish releasing all the seasons of TMNT!!!

3909813,5,B002D755BW,"I loved the Red Sky seasons. For those who don't know the old turtles series switched over to a darker tone for seasons 8-10. All the episodes took place at night and featured a red sky, hence the nickname. The show focused more on character development and story arcs again. It got heavily criticized by many fans for benching major players like Krang and Shredder in favor of aliens such as Lord Dregg. This season however features Shredder and Krang as main villains as well as some new equally interesting ones.

It's only 8 episodes but everyone of them is good. There's a psycho who built the Technodrome out for revenge on Krang, a mutant gang lead by Titanus, a failed government experiment named Megavolt, and even the Rat King comes back. One of my favorites is ""Cyber Turtles"" featuring the turtles wearing the Cyber armor from the Playmates toyline. They were also in the Archie comic book series and unlike most toy endorsements this was a great one. The Archie issues were some of the best in the series and the episode is actually pretty good.

I highly recommend this to turtles fans and old cartoon fans in general. If you ever complained the old turles are just random with no story arcs then check this season out, it will change your mind I think.",1254873600,5,1267,4.601769911504425
3909814,4,B002D755BW,"Well, where to begin?

When the seventh season of the show had debuted the year before, everyone involved had delicately altered what had been a winning formula.  The episodes became ever-so-slightly darker than in years past, but not so much that it would turn away loyal viewers.  In hindsight, it would appear that season seven of the show was a trial run of sorts - to see whether or not fans would accept edgier fare.

With nothing to hold the creative team back, and with only a surprisingly few amount of episodes to fill a season (just eight!), everyone involved went for broke and completely revamped the eighth season of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.""

Well, where to begin?  Just about everything that made the show what it was, all the hallmarks that defined it for seven seasons, were replaced.

The iconic theme song was shed in favor of a darker, edgier track that interspersed clips of the new show with clips from, of all things, the first live-action movie in the franchise.  For the next three seasons, the series went with this music track/clip show, even when the main villains, Shredder and Krang, had been replaced by other baddies.  So, really, the new track was only truly appropriate for the eighth season, when Shredder and Krang were still the numero uno bad guys on the show.  Once they were replaced after the eighth season, the new track became wildly out of place.

The goofy, fun-loving reptiles who ate pizza for three square meals a day were replaced by straight-laced action heroes who bore little resemblance to those who came before them.  Even Michaelangelo, the biggest party animal of them all, was now sadly restrained.  Fortunately, Splinter was not altered at all, which was a welcome bit of relief.

The smorgasbord of side-characters that had sprung up over the years?  You know, Mondo Gecko and Mona Lisa and Usagi Yojimbo and the like?  Gone.  Members of the Channel 6 news team remained, although, strangely, after the season opener, Irma disappeared completely.  Bebop and Rocksteady, everyone's favorite bumbling duo, oddly cleaned up their act and became more competent.  Sadly, even this was not enough to save them, as their screen time was increasingly diminished over the course of the season.

And we can't forget about that infamous ""red sky"" that permeated every episode of the show for the last three seasons.  Some fans are still scratching their heads over that one.

So...where does that leave us?  Well, where to begin?

With only eight episodes to work with, the creative team cut the fat and really ran with shows that were high on action, high on plot, and that dealt with season-long story arcs, something that hadn't been done since the show's second year.  The stories themselves also became a lot less predictable.  Accustomed to seeing our heroes always save the day, just watch what unfolds in the very first episode of the eighth season, ""Get Shredder!""  Suffice it to say, the awesome foursome can no longer claim they have a perfect record.

Whether one likes the new format really has to do with individual tastes.  Looking back, there were pros and cons to both formats of the show - there were good and bad things about the first seven seasons, and the same goes for the last three seasons.  However, if you've picked up every other DVD release that has preceded this one, I would still recommend purchasing this DVD as well.",1246060800,40,3405,4.820689655172414

3909834,5,B002D755BW,"When I was growing up watching the T.M.N.T. franchise, I was a little concerned when the writers decided to take the final 3 seasons of the series to a much darker tone.  The animation, sound effects, and soundtrack were completely different, but I still loved watching the show every Saturday morning.  Sadly, there were only 8 episodes for each season, but as in most cases, I believe that the QUALITY of certain shows are much more important than the actual quantity.

This disc is comprised of Episodes #171 through #178.  In Episode #171, ""Get Shredder"", the T.M.N.T. have to hunt down Shredder and Krang, who lost their Technodrome when Donatello sent it to Dimension X for the third time.  They stumble upon the Hall of Science, only to find out that it's already being occupied by Berserko.  Not only that, but he actually KNOWS Krang and has him kidnapped!  This greatly upsets Shredder, who threatens to blow up Channel 6 (and sadly, he succeeds in doing that) if the T.M.N.T. don't give him Krang back!  Thankfully, the Channel 6 staff come out of the explosion alive, but Burne Thompson berates the Turtles for allowing Shredder to wreak havoc on NYC and vows to tell the public just how dangerous they are!  :(

Episode #172:  ""Wrath Of The Rat King.""  Krang and Shredder now occupy the Hall of Science, and the first order of business is to contact General Traag in Dimension X.  Traag states that the Technodrome is stuck in a black hole and that it can't get out!  Also, the Rat King returns and offers to help Shredder destroy the T.M.N.T. -- IF Shredder agrees to mutate his rat horde.  The plan works, but the Rat King realizes that Shredder is only using him for his own benefit and, therefore, steals Krang's Shock Wave to wreak more havoc on NYC!!

Episode #173:  ""State Of Shock.""  Not one of my favorite episodes.  The T.M.N.T. have to deal with the media's backlash and, to add insult to injury, Colonel Wesley Knight and his men hunt down the Turtles in the sewers!  Although they eventually have to answer to Knight, first they have to deal with Megavolt, who uses a bunch of charged energy from his robot body to turn into an insect.  He starts attacking the public in NYC, and the T.M.N.T. have to stop him.  Thankfully, with April's help, Colonel Knight lets the Turtles go and stop Megavolt from his evil plot!

Episodes #174 through #176:  This is a ""trilogy"" of sorts, which involves new archenemy Titanus.  He offers to give the T.M.N.T. asylum after Burne Thompson continues to badmouth them.  But the Turtles quickly realize what Titanus is REALLY up to -- he's not protecting mutants; he's MAKING them!!  :(  The T.M.N.T. manage to stop him from turning the entire population into mutants.  In Episode #176 -- ""Enter Krakus"" -- the Turtles realize that Titanus is actually from the future and that Krakus needs to stop them.  This particular episode is one of my favorites because of the soundtrack involved.  It gets very intense when Krakus has to deal with Titanus and his H.A.V.O.C. mutants!!

Episode #177:  ""Cyber Turtles.""  Shredder and Krang bring down an alien spaceship and try to take it over.  The aliens also don't take too kindly to the T.M.N.T. invading their territory.  Once they are captured, April calls on a new friend -- Casey Jones!  The both of them go to the Hall of Science to confront Shredder and Krang.  Meanwhile, the T.M.N.T. break free from their prison cell and don some Cyber Suits.  They use the Suits to take down the alien invaders, and eventually Shredder and Krang.  At the end of the episode, the T.M.N.T. show the aliens mercy and allow them to return home after fixing their broken down spaceship.

Episode #178:  ""Turtle Trek.""  This is the crme de la crop of the 8 episodes, and my absolute favorite!  The T.M.N.T. confront Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady at a power plant but are unable to stop them this time.  From the Hall of Science, Krang uses his brand new energy transmitter to open a portal to Dimension X.  All 4 archenemies go through the portal and reunite with their Technodrome, which somehow got out of it's black hole prison (probably due to the Rock Soldiers' help).  The T.M.N.T. realize what happened and soon give chase, but they are confronted by other aliens and have to go through a test of sorts.

After they win the battle against the aliens, they steal their spaceship and go to the place where the Technodrome now rests.  They soon get captured by an underground plant and are stunned to see the Technodrome moving again!  Shredder tries to zap the Turtles with an anti-mutagen ray but instead hits the plant and frees the Turtles.  Next, the T.M.N.T. have their biggest (and best) battle with Shredder by throwing him into a vat of mutagen.

Next, they use the Rock Soldier's spaceship to stop the Technodrome's engines, rendering it un-driveable.  When Krang realizes what happened, he can't do anything about it!  So after the Turtles lay waste to Bebop and Rocksteady, they enter the Technodrome's portal and go back home to Earth!  As for the Technodrome's fate, well, the giant plant pulls it into the huge hole and smashes its top, much to Krang's chagrin!  He curses the Turtles for ever crossing him.

Shredder and Krang, sadly, won't be heard from again until Episodes #189, #190, and #191, which are on the final season of T.M.N.T.  I'll review those episodes at a later time, so hopefully you'll enjoy this set!  :)",1394668800,,5433,4.712008501594049

The synopsizes come from Wikipedia.

170.  Get Shredder!:  Shredder & Krang are still loose on Earth, but without the resources of the Technodrome, they plan to steal equipment from the abandoned Hall of Science at the World Fair.  Krang's former weapons engineer, Drakus, using the guise of Beserko, also shows up to cause trouble.  This is an awesome episode to start the season on.  A+

171.  Wrath of the Rat King:  While Krang tries to re-acquire the Technodrome from Dimension X, Shredder tracks down the Rat King & makes an alliance with him in order to destroy the Turtles.  The Rat King's final appearance.  A

172.  State of Shock:  A band of ninja, led by a mysterious villain named Megavolt, are stealing electronic equipment from power plants all over the city, and the Turtles are being blamed for the crimes. The Turtles must find a way to defeat Megavolt & clear their names before it is too late.  My least favorite episode of the season, but it's still good.  B

173.  Cry H.A.V.O.C.:  A mysterious organization of mutants calling itself Highly Advanced Variety Of Creatures has surfaced in the city.  Although their pro-mutant intentions seem good on the outside, what are their true motives?  The Turtles must find out.  This introduces one of the best villains in the whole show.  A+

174.  H.A.V.O.C. In the Streets:  Titanus & his H.A.V.O.C. organization are back, and this time they are planning to build a Sky Platform so that they can retrieve a lost Flux Transformer from a military base.  Titanus creates a new mutant called Synapse, a being of pure energy that can control anything mechanical.  Synapse was a great adversary for the Turtles.  A+

175.  Enter: Krakus:  Still after the Flux Transformer, Titanus & his mutants track its unique electronic signals, in order to locate it & get it back.  Meanwhile, the Turtles have their hands full, when an enforcer named Krakus shows up.  A great finish to a great 3 part story.  A+

176.  Cyber Turtles;  Krang & Shredder steal the Astro-Viewer, a powerful telescope, before disabling a starfighter passing over Earth.  Once aboard the starfighter, Shredder steals the Fire Star, a crystalline fragment with the power of 1000 suns which renders its possessor invincible.  Krang needs it in order to rule the universe & to merge Earth with Dimension X.  I loved seeing the Cyber Turtles on the small screen.  A

177.  Turtle Trek:  Krang & Shredder are using the city's power to operate Krang's new Transdimensional Portal to Dimension X, so that they finally have access to their Rock Soldier armies & resources.  The Turtles rescue a resident of Dimension X, named Gargon, held captive by Krang on Earth, who agrees to help track down Shredder & Krang.  A great end to a great season.  A+

While I greatly enjoyed this season, I hated the new voice for Shredder.  James Avery was the best, but Townsend Coleman (the voice of Michelangelo) was a fine replacement.  So why hire a new guy?  Ah well, that won't be a problem next season, as you'll see.",1367884800,,3224,4.681003584229391
