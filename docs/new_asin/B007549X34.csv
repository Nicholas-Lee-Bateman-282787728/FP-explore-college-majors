8510357,5,B007549X34,"I have loved the album Northstar by Philip Glass for the last 35 years. The viewing DVD is a bittersweet experience for that reason. The music is not a big part of the film, but I managed to connect the album to the film and got to listen to the Glass piece that corresponds with each di Suvero sculpture.",1463184000,,305,4.186440677966102
8510358,5,B007549X34,"This DVD provides a good deal of insight into the remarkable work and life of the sculptor Mark di Suvero. It was filmed around 1975, and at a fairly early point in di Suvero's career. Since then, di Suvero has been prolific, and he received the National Medal of Arts in 2010. Films such as this one give a much better feeling for sculpture than still photographs, and the producers highlight nine of di Suvero's ""monumental, but delicate"" sculptures. The footage of di Suvero riding steel i-beams as they were moved into position during assembly of his sculpture is wonderful. Philip Glass composed distinct pieces of music for each of the nine featured sculptures. Like di Suvero, Glass has gone on to become something of a cultural icon.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-Star/dp/B008OUTUGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North Star</a>&nbsp;is a recording of the score that was released separately, and appears to be well-appreciated by Glass' devotees. Finally, the interviews of di Suvero, his mother, and others convey something of di Suvero's intelligence, his passion for his art, and his strong political commitments. All in all, this is a superb documentary film.",1438387200,,1218,5.625
8510359,3,B007549X34,I was glad to finally be able to see this film having been familiar with the Philip Glass soundtrack for many years.  Unfortunately I found the film informative but not particularly exciting and the music did little to enhance the experience.  Worth seeing once for fans of Philip Glass and of Mark DiSuvero.,1413417600,,308,4.7924528301886795
