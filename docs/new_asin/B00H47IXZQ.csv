8629711,4,B00H47IXZQ,This South African movie has very good cinematography and a somewhat unconventional structure. It was artfully adapted from a novel. The characters' relationships were unusual but mostly believable.,1454976000,,198,6.107142857142857

8629714,1,B00H47IXZQ,"This film, out of South Africa, is about some older middle aged guy who goes to a semi-rural friend's house to recover from a car accident in which he might have been responsible for the death of family members. There he finds he is a neighbor to a family where the wife(mom) was raped/killed. Surviving are the husband, his older teen daughter and younger teen son.

Not believable acting; a storyline that was disjointed with subplots of surviving father as forcibly over religious; daughter as a sexual tease; son as aloof. Tossed in is an African women who walks into houses asking for money and work, and a patrolling officer who does nothing but drive. Finally some obscure warning about baboons that like to go into houses. The movie does nothing for it's entire length (lots of extended shots of trees, etc.) until the young female seduces the visiting middle aged guy; her dad and cop find out and the baboon causes a ruckus. Nobody dies, nothing changes. Baboon eats an orange. End of movie.",1395532800,4,1001,4.72
