Absolutely forgot how funny and cute a show it was. It has aged a little (fashion, music and technology) buy my 11 year old twins LOVED it.

8591544,1,B00DC12RZA,"I am very disappointed- I have been wanting to own the series of Doogie Howser for a long time. When I noticed the complete series for such an affordable price I should have realized there was a catch: u need a multi regional DVD player to view the DVDs. So now I have a set of DVDs I desire but maybe cannot watch. I'm not sure if my player will/won't play them, but if I open the pack, I won't b able to return them if they are unplayable. I feel this fact about the possible unplayable state should be right up there with the price on the front page, not hidden in details of shippers. If you want an item you check the item, at least that is what I once did, but burned once twice shy..... Still think you should be able to at least try and see if your player can play DVDs and return if it does not.",1461888000,7,804,3.9691358024691357
