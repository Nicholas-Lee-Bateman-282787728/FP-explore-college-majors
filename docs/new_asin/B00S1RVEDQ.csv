8696875,5,B00S1RVEDQ,I love burlesque dancing.  Katalin is an awesome teacher.  Thank you.,1486252800,2,69,5.181818181818182
8696876,5,B00S1RVEDQ,"Katalin Schafer is misleading in that she is so pleasant and charming to watch and listen to it would be easy to miss her perfectionism. She is an amazing dancer and instructor and provides an excellent dance warm-up and workout as well as above ordinary Burlesque instruction. I previewed this before buying it online-because I usually find burlesque and ""sexy dance "" DVDs a waste of money.(I want exercise as well as dance instruction-not poses.) Katalin is the only one so far -that I have found that provides this.",1458777600,4,519,4.842696629213483
8696877,5,B00S1RVEDQ,"Well done, great instruction.  Fun to do and watch, tease not sleaze content.",1448150400,,77,4.923076923076923
8696878,5,B00S1RVEDQ,"If you are looking for a playful form of dance that is sexy without being vulgar, this is the dvd for you. Katalin Schafer brings out the best elements of Burlesque in a choreography that is full of fun.  For anyone worried about it being too tawdry, by the end of the a dance, you will still have more clothes on than the average 20 year old at the beach does.

At one point, Katalin says that the most important thing is to dance with joy.  It shows in her choreography and presentation.  This is one of the most playful routines that I have had a chance to learn.  The moves were intricate enough to be interesting, and she breaks them down well enough that I, as a belly dancer with several years of classes under my belt, could follow along easily.  Flat out beginner dancers may want to supplement this with a beginner level belly dance dvd, as some of the moves are shared between the two dance forms.  Bellydance: First Steps for Total Beginners - Belly Dance with Neon!,  in which the moves are broken down with easy to understand graphics, would be a good supplemental dvd for them.  In Refined Sugar, Katalin does get even new dancers in the good habit of doing warmups and post dance stretching.

One of the parts I particularly enjoyed was the advance movements section.  I was blown away by how clever and fun the little routines were in that.  It is great inspiration.  I also liked that she showed an alternate version on how to get down to do floor work for people who can't do the splits.

I have to give World Dance New York kudos for putting out yet another enjoyable, helpful, and affordable dance instruction video.  This was my first introduction to Katalin Schafer's choreography and instructional styles.  I liked it so much that I immediately ordered her Hip Romance belly dance instructional dvd.  Thank you, Katalin, for bringing a little more joy into my dancing!",1427068800,3,1892,4.550295857988166
