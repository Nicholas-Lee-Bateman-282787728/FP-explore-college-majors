1344919,4,B00004RJ72,"This is an attractive little film (Jessica Tandy's last) about two musicians, one old and one young (Fonda), and how they lead each other through a journey of self-discovery.  In the beginning both are hamstrung by men (a controlling son and a controlling husband) but by the end both have found ways to set themselves free.  Along the way their journey, literally and figuratively, is full of unexpected twists, colorful characters, beautiful scenery and music, and a warm developing friendship between the eccentric but compatible lead characters.  The supporting cast, particularly Maury Chaykin as the slovenly porn-producer son, are excellent.

In short, not a blockbuster or an award winner but there are much worse ways to spend an hour and a half.",1229731200,,755,5.163934426229508
1344920,5,B00004RJ72,Camillia was an incredible inspiration and I love Jeccia Tandy and Bridget Fonda so very much as actors and felt inspired and happy to have in my film collection,1225152000,,161,4.586206896551724
1344921,5,B00004RJ72,"I was channel surfing and came across this movie.  I love Bridget Fonda so I starting watching.  What a surprise.  It was witty, touching, and a little off the beaten path of comedy.  The music was enchanting.  Now I'm on the hunt for the soundtrack.
Follow the twists and turns on their road to adventure and true love.  I'm hooked.  Can't wait to see it again.
Enjoy it with a friend.",1191801600,3,386,4.352112676056338
1344922,5,B00004RJ72,"Jessica Tandy (6/7/09 - 9/11/94)

Camilla is a touching and funny road movie about two women on a journey of self discovery, and the unexpected friendship that changed there lives.

Jessica Tandy plays Camilla, a feisty violinist who's life story sounds like a great novel. Freda played by Fonda, a musician trying to find her voice. This is really a great film, that didn't get the notice it deserves. A sweet memorial to a truly great actress.",1169856000,,445,4.766233766233766
1344923,5,B00004RJ72,"The film is a tribute to the wisdom and the forgiving nature of an aging mother(Jessica Tandy)who has been kept apart, by choice, from the embrace of the man she has loved by her unwillingness to challenge the selfishness of her coddled son and only child.
Her lover was portrayed by her off screen husband(Cronin)whose closing dialog was rendered bitersweet by the subsequent passing of the persona of Miss Daisy snd Ninny Threadgood.
An adeptation of a story written by a Canadian author takes the viewer on the delightful voyage of higher learning of two unlikely traveling companions. (Bridget Fonda)accompanies ""Camilla"" on a trip that begins in a grove of moss covered vines on a sprawling Georgia Plantation and returns her heart to a small flat near Niagra Falls.
The plot twists and turns through art imitating life situations that are familiar and amusing. If you are a Jessica Tandy fan it's a must see, if only to bid her a fond farewell and.",1024790400,26,954,4.823170731707317

1344962,5,B00004RJ72,"Gorgeous movie.  Jessica Tandy encourages a young woman to take courage, to take her to Toronto for a concert and to Niagra Falls where she never has been despite her increasing years.  The music and an aging Tandy playing a violin, or appearing to, makes me want to be young again too.

1344976,5,B00004RJ72,"This is a quirky little film that changes directions more than one of those robotic vacuum cleaners.  The characters start out secure in their protective overcoats of delusion, then gradually these pretensions are stripped away to reveal the fragile humanity within.  Graham Greene also delivers one of his most eccentric performances to date.  This belongs in a prominent place in your video library, for those times when you need soul warming.",1388016000,3,445,5.23943661971831

1344978,4,B00004RJ72,"For some reason Bridget Fonda has never obtained the status of famous family members Henry, Peter, and Jane. But she proves she can hold her own in this tale of 2 unlikely friends who don't let age diminish their relationship as they take an unlikely odyssey together. Bridget gets to star alongside 2 icons from her grandfather Henry's era: Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn. It's almost as if the elderly couple, via their roles,  are passing the torch that Henry was prevented from handing to his granddaughter  because of his death at a relatively young age (compared to Tandy and Cronyn).",1372032000,,589,4.821782178217822

What can I say about the always delightful and talented Jessica Tandy!!  At the wonderful age of around 82, wow, she is full of spirit and is sorely going to be missed.

Graham Greene plays an interesting character and is a very fine actor.  I last saw him in 'The Green Mile' as Arlen Bitterbuck.

This is a very, very good movie.  I highly recommend it.",1240876800,,632,4.522123893805309
