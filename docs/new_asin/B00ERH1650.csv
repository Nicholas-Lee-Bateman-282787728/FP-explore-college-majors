5934956,2,B00ERH1650,"hey, I can appreciate the intent of the brutality and the hope of pumping indie blood into the film industry...but l felt that it's really poorly scripted and some of the actors seem corny at times...the restaurant and police station scenes are laughably bad...and I noticed some lighting problems (except the nude scenes--those were clear enough to see cellulite on a naked a**!)...

sorry folks...this film makes I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE look like CITIZEN KANE",1389916800,8,458,5.026315789473684

On the surface, ""The Hospital"" is sick, disturbing, brutal, depraved and unrelenting. Yet, there is something much deeper and perhaps more sinister going on. Is it all a trick? It is that which, behind its gruesome attempt to out sick the sick list, makes it worthy and memorable.

""The Hospital"" is passionately demented and won't so much shock its viewers, as it will skip the electrocution phase completely and move swiftly into the stage of sifting through the ashes of one's psyche.

If you endure the chaos you are literally infected with some of the most bizarre and disturbing scenes ever captured in legitimate American film. If you walk out or turn it off, you give into a psychological weakness. If you complete the experience and are repulsed the game is then to separate personal opinion of the content from the brilliance of the effort and the effect.

Whether or not co-writers/producers/stars Daniel Emery Taylor and Jim O'Rear meant to make a psychological statement is something which will likely remain a mystery. Regardless of the true intent, the film is unquestionably a psychological statement.

How much can you take? If you take it all, what does that say about your character? If you don't try it, isn't that submission to a fear of exploring territories within your own mind and soul that you'd never dared before? Finally, if you've completed the experience and are completely revolted, (as I was) can you separate the gruesome content from the beauty of the effort?

Yes, this film makes that sort of impact. It makes that sort of effort.

It's madness parallels the dinner scene in Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" but its perversions and unrelenting welding of typically unspoken vices surpass films that are spoken about in the dark closets of fandom or those currently engraved into Japanese pop culture.

It is two films really. The first half offers a simple little slasher before we are unexpectedly taken to places no sane man or woman would sign up for in the final half. It's an almost comedic homage film turned completely on its head to become a potent dark poisoning of the mind.

The starring cast put on some of the most unforgettable performances for a horror film in decades.

O'Rear has a lot to be proud of. Not only did he co-write and co-produce the film but also he places himself in a role that highlights his abilities the way that ""The Devil's Rejects"" highlighted the ability of Bill Mosley. O'Rear can play a straight guy all day, but his real talent is hidden beneath a madness that leaps onto the screen in this film. Well known to be extremely friendly, O'Rear does so well with his performance that one questions, when shaking his hand, what he would do if you crossed him in a dark alley on a bad day.

On the male side of the cast, O'Rear is undeniably the standout, but that is not a discredit to his cast mates. It is simply a huge credit to his previously unseen star power. He plays an initially in-control and humdrum straight guy and suddenly is revealed as an over the top sadist, Alan (a' la Otis Driftwood on a speed binge).

Newcomer, Alicia Clark puts on a victim's performance that is so real, so gut wrenching, and so emotionally raw that I wondered if she underwent psychological treatment following production. Without her performance in the most significant scene of the film the transition from tongue in cheek slasher to dark and brutal psychological warfare doesn't work as well. Only a handful of actresses working regularly today could likely pull off her performance. Most of those have had more award nominations than roles. She is a talent to watch.

Daniel Emery Taylor also has a tremendous amount to be proud of. Not only is this film co-written, co-produced and directed by him, he also plays the most unusual red herring in film history as the deranged hospital caretaker, Stanley Creech. To suggest Stanley as a mere red herring is perhaps dismissive but considering the film's path, is an accurate statement.

Taylor has mostly simple lines, as his character is a simple man, but Stanley is as sick and perverse as they come, but somehow casts a peculiar amount of sympathy from the audience. Taylor's subtleties in not exaggerating the performance make the over the top idea of Stanley much stronger than they would've been played any other way.

The film tackles some of the most disturbing subject matters hanging in the cobwebs of society, and in some areas it does so respectfully. In others it shouts ""damn the torpedoes"" and sinks to new depths. This is the genius of the film.

Where has society gone, to what depths? The film doesn't answer this question, but it certainly asks it loudly and proudly.

It has heart and passion and ultimately stands out above the crowd. It is a work of sick art as is made clear in its splendidly clever, albeit disgusting tribute to the late painter Bob Ross, a scene that will likely be talked about a decade from now.

Destined for cult status, ""The Hospital"" has taken the independent horror game into a different direction, breaking all the rules, and serving up a splendidly sadistic bit of vice infested anarchy.

Whether you ultimately love this film, hate this film, or somehow find yourself alone on the impossible road in between, you will remember it for a long time. You will compare other films to it. You will set standards and plummets based upon it. Yes, it is that good. Yes, it is that awful. Yes, it is everything it said it would be, and much, much more.",1389657600,5,5561,4.744041450777202

5934970,2,B00ERH1650,"The only positive aspect of this film is that it definitely makes good on its intention to be a ""torture porn"" flick..  The film is full of the over the top scenes of torture, rape, and nudity that fans of these types of movies have to expect.  There are even a couple of torture methods probably never even used before (I.e. paintbrushing the vag ).  The real problems come with both, shoddy acting and terrible scripting, along with several unresolved plotholes.  The film itself is so mean spirited and pointlessthat you cant even call It a popcorn movie.  I actually had to fastforward through alot of it, especially in the latter half of the film.  Points for delivering the red stuffthe nudity, but having to sit through this film again may result in my own trip to the hospital",1393977600,5,784,4.60431654676259
5934971,3,B00ERH1650,"This film has an inordinate amount of rape and murder, and not always in that order. The low production values actually work in the film's favor, since it focuses on a lot of snuff film type material. There is some good acting to be found here, particularly the work of Jason Crowe, but for me personally there was more violence against women than I am confortable with. I can see how this would appeal to a significant portion of the horror community,  which, along with the above average acting,  results in my 3 star review.",1392681600,2,527,4.536842105263158

Truly not for everyone but if depravity doesn't totally turn you away, you should like this one. This totally breaks new ground!",1390089600,6,405,4.71830985915493
5934974,5,B00ERH1650,"Sure, as with most low-budget indie flicks, you can point out problems with lighting or effects ... but if you're willing to look past that, it contains one of the sickest, most unrelenting story to hit film in quite some time.

To quote the review from Ain't It Cool News:

""THE HOSPITAL is a sick and twisted ordeal which centers around a paranormal investigation show. A group of guys lure a handful of women into a supposedly haunted hospital telling them that they will be a part of a paranormal investigation show which will be seen by millions of viewers. In actuality, this is a trap and GHOST HUNTERS soon morphs into an especially tasteless installment of HOSTEL pretty hastily.

To give this film credit, it does have some unexpected turns from start to finish and is able to mislead pretty well throughout, making this a truly unpredictable ride.

On the other hand, this is an especially diabolical film with no woman in its large cast getting out without being stripped, raped, and killedand sometimes not in that order. There are scenes of torture, abuse, rape, and murder a-plenty here, and though there is attention to story, it is clear the focus of the film is to show different girls in peril over and over and over again.

Had the torture inflicted in this film not been such the object of so many minutes in the film's run time, I'd believe the filmmakers may have been trying to make a statement here about violence by going so far over the top. But sadly, I felt the film may be a little too much fascinated with the torture to know when enough is enough. It was very tough to sit through this film and it definitely caused a lot of unease, which a good horror movie should do, I guess.

But I like a point to my violence, and THE HOSPITAL doesn't seem to have a lot of it besides racking up a kill count with some of the most depraved kills enacted upon anyone in cinematic history. If you have an iron stomach, you might be able to withstand this perverse little indie, but though there is some kind of retribution to the rapist killers in the end, it is definitely not what the camera seems to linger on.""",1390003200,12,2132,4.467866323907455

8608761,3,B00ERH1650,"Stanley Creech (Daniel Emery Taylor...also wrote and directed film) is an obese creepy individual who abducts women, rapes and kills them at the abandoned St. Leopold hospital. A film crew goes there to shoot about the haunting of said hospital along with several young females.

The film is a rape/slasher movie with friendly ghosts and not much horror. The rapes are off camera. Consensual sex is on camera. The acting was better than a ""Brain Dead"" film and for the most part worse than Asylum. The acting in the restaurant scene had me laughing. If you are expecting a creepy ghost horror film, this isn't it. It you want a fun rape/slasher, this is it, you sick pup go get help.

There is nothing like topless slutty goth looking chicks to make a film say ""beer movie.""

5 stars as a fun local cult film. I could see where fans of ""Blood Sucking Freaks"" finding some enjoyment in this short production.

1 star for a serious viewer.
