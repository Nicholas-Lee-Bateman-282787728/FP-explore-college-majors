8089067,5,B000BMCY56,"My stars, this DVD is full of so much information it will take me a while to get comfortable with using this information.  Meade Steadman does make it look much easier than I found it.  It is amazing how effective massage of the hands can be to work the whole body.  I am enthralled with learning  the history of reflexology, the techniques used, the body's physiology, the delicate anatomy of the hand, the therapeutic and healing practice.and the anatomy of the hand and how it maps to each part of the body. I am amazed at how comprehensive this instructional video is.  Mead Steadman helps break it down to make me successful at learning it.  He demonstrates his techniques on several models of different ages, both male and female. Mead Steadman  discusses the difference in techniques for elderly clients, and discusses potential geriatric concerns and contraindications.  My hope is that I can get to the point where I can massage my own hands and have it help with my aches and pains.  I do recommend this DVD if you are at all interested in learning about hand massage/reflexology.",1475020800,,1090,4.75531914893617
8089068,5,B000BMCY56,"Comprehensive Reflexology & Massage: The Hand Meade Steadman (Actor), Humberto Estrada (Actor) is a 1 hour and 57 minute video.  It has several chapters: Introduction, History, Techniques, Reflexology Body Map, Left Hand Reflexology, Right Hand Reflexology, Geriatric Reflexology, Hand & Forearm massage, Geriatric massage, Techniques and Options, Contraindications, Conclusion, and contact info.
The Left, Right & Geriatric chapters starts off with a stimulating massage to get the hands loose.  Obviously the Geriatric section is gentler than the Left & Right chapters.  The massages start off with compression then incorporate reflexology techniques.  Although he does give a hand reflexology map, he doesnt give the muscle or bones that are in the hand and forearms, but he uses those names while demonstrating the techniques.  Again, the Geriatric massage is gentler, and there are some age specific massage techniques that he covers.
Other techniques and options cover using a chair or a massage table, and using your own body as leverage during sessions.  And he emphasizes not to drop your head and slump while performing techniques to protect your posture, and to work for your comfort as well.  He also discusses using towels between clients to avoid cross contamination.
The contraindications sections deals with knowing what your clients maladies include, and that you should know them. They include heart conditions, vascular disorders such as diabetes, pregnancy, open wounds & bleeding, and infection diseases.",1474934400,2,1525,5.604347826086957
8089069,5,B000BMCY56,I started my massage business a year ago and I have been doing massage for 5+ years. I focused mostly on Swedish and Deep Tissue but you have to expand and keep learning always.  This video has great information in it and I learned a lot about reflexology that I didn't know. I not only learned about reflexology from watching this video but this video is going to make me a better massager all around. I always try out anything new on my wife and she said that she could notice a big different in my technique and she loved the work I did on her hands.,1474675200,,553,4.168224299065421
8089070,5,B000BMCY56,This is an excellent video! The instructor is easy to follow and the content is comprehensive. It's like I got three videos for the price of one when you consider how much I learned and how much information was included in this DVD. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning reflexology techniques. You will not be disappointed!,1241395200,10,347,4.8
