5528693,5,B00AYRIUGK,This movie has a good message for young girls that think that all that shines is gold. Overall it was entertaining although the little girl in the movie was a horrible actor (sorry:(.,1374192000,,183,4.575757575757576

5528696,2,B00AYRIUGK,"DeAndre (Game) is involved in stealing and dealing computer chips. He is arrested and his girlfriend Chanel (Stacey Dash) is arrested as an accomplice. She is placed under house arrest while DeAndre remains in jail. DeAndre wants her to take the rap because he has two strikes. (Something that since has been repealed.)

This story is about redemption and changing one's life. It is formulaic, campy, and poorly made. As an African-American film there has to be a girl named Keisha (Shelli Boone) as sure as a British crime film has a guy named Nigel. Red Grant plays Fran-Swah a stereotypical over-the-top gay. He role was campy as was the ugly baby named ""Precious.""

The whole set up of Chanel being on house arrest, the arraignment, and her going to drug counseling on non-drug related charges was part of the bad plot. She is a bad mother of a six year old, a six year old who likes the stud postman that takes her to church...guess where this goes?

It is a poorly done ""Christian-style"" film which drops the F-bomb and N-word for no good reason other than to get a rating. Stacey Dash shows off leg and cleavage, perhaps the only reason to watch this movie. It made me ache for a Tyler Perry film.",1365897600,6,1204,4.564814814814815

8559333,5,B00AYRIUGK,sometimes the greatest things are in front of our face but when you are focus on none factor things in life you need to find yourself and god to realize what you need all along was in front of you to begin with. Chanel was more focus on things such as gucci and prada that she ignored her daughter and paid her no love nor attention. Her daughter was so behind in school  and require love from mother.,1431216000,,401,4.141025641025641
