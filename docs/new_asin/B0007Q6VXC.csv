2231007,5,B0007Q6VXC,"A visually stunning, romantic tragedy, cinematically gorgeous and dramatically riveting, this movie compares favorably, if not surpasses, ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" As in the former movie, Zhang Ziyi was just as gorgeous, talented, graceful and incredibly agile and revealed these traits in both marshal arts and ballet-like dancing. Her abilities as an actress, her incredible beauty and the above mentioned talents make her tower above any American, Hollywood actress. This movie will dazzle and enthrall, and its pathos is even superior to that of Crouching Tiger which is a similar genre by an equally talented Director.",1513814400,,630,5.572916666666667

2231012,5,B0007Q6VXC,"Beautiful atmospheric movie. And as with many good Asian movies time is spent to effectively play with the emotions and get you invested. One of my all time favorite movies, as well as the movie Hero (2002).",1507939200,,207,4.621621621621622
2231013,5,B0007Q6VXC,"That final battle scene though.... WOW!!! Now, I readily admit that I have a major crush on Ziyi Zhang / Zhang Ziyi (whatever) and in my book she can do no wrong :-) but this is my favorite foreign film. It is an artistic masterpiece both musically and visually. Even the horses are beautiful. As far as Ziyi is concerned.... there are no words to describe her mastery of her role in this movie.",1506470400,,395,4.351351351351352
2231014,1,B0007Q6VXC,"It's obvious the effort to make a good disk wasn't there when they made this disk. Poor sharpness in detail and horrible coloration washes. Believe  it or not, you're better off with the DVD.",1506384000,,191,4.617647058823529
2231015,5,B0007Q6VXC,This movie is well worth watching.  The backdrops are visually stunning. The fighting sequences are good but one seemed a bit like a choreographed dance instead of a realistic fighting scene. Yet it was graceful. It is still one of my top favorite Mandarin (very beautiful language) movies that I have watched MANY times over & love every time.,1505433600,,344,4.830508474576271
2231016,5,B0007Q6VXC,I do not speak Chinese and therefore relied heavily on the subtitles.  I had seen it by chance on television.  This romance accompanied by violent action is still arrestingly beautiful.  The color is memorable.,1504224000,,210,5.117647058823529

2231026,4,B0007Q6VXC,"'Wuxia' apparently translates to 'the complete substitution of impossibly dramatic swordsmanship for any kind of rational decision making ability' and every single character in this film is absolutely full of that. Improbably complex martial art forms, incredibly shallow romances, convoluted loyalties and agendas, and casual disregard for gravity and physics all make for a backdrop of me yelling at the characters for being so incredibly stupid about, well, EVERYTHING. By the time they folded the whole thing up in a giant bloody trainwreck I honestly stopped caring if they lived or not (and suspected that they were too stupid to survive anyway). I suspect that the real arc of the story is that the whole thing is a (successful) plot by the rebel leader to get some of her more useless agents killed off before they can screw up her showdown with the equally faceless emperor general.",1496102400,,891,5.068027210884353

It's a beautiful and emotional film. I love how the romance finds its way into the grim circumstances of the characters' lives. Many of the scenes are artistic and vibrant.

2231085,5,B0007Q6VXC,"This was really great! I had somehow missed it since being out since 2004, but caught up with it after hearing Jackie Evancho sing the love song version of ""Lovers"" on stage.  I watched it twice within 24 hrs and ended up buying the HD version for my library. The beautiful cinematography, script and acting made this movie a treasure to watch. I found the direction to be poetic and paced for the right balance of drama, romance, tragedy, epic and touching personal moments to have maximum impact at emotional storytelling level. I felt like I was right there as part of this epic adventure and found myself swept up in the adventure as if I was a player. I did not see the surprises coming, nor the twists and turns in the plot. I was at the edge of my seat for the ending and felt like I had witnessed a timeless moment where love, pain, war and honor get all fused together at once in a dramatic meaning with blurry edges. Highly recommended.",1440374400,,946,4.405714285714286

2231092,2,B0007Q6VXC,this movie just misses the mark with me. Seems like they just gave up on some of the other story's just to stick to the main characters Hero is leagues better than this,1435622400,,168,4.121212121212121

2231094,1,B0007Q6VXC,"This could have been one of the best blu ray transfers available at the time (2005.)  However, visually it is an awful awful blu ray transfer.  Seen on one of the very best BD players around (Oppo) the Oppo only mangifies just how bad the transfer is.  Not the Oppo's fault of course since it is simply presenting the source material as is. If there was ever a movie needing to be reissued in a mastered edition this is it.  The only saving grace to the movie is the audio, offered in PCM (uncompressed), and Dolby Digital.  I can only imagine this in DTS-MA 7.1. The audio is interesting in that PCM is supposed to be much better than Dollby Digital, but to my ears the DD is much better than PCM.  Lastly, if you want to check your sound system the audio is stunning - especially the drum echo scene - even though it is not Dolby True or DTS-MA. Again, one can only hope that Sony reissues this and it gets the best BD transfer the movie deserves.",1435190400,,949,4.2444444444444445

The photography is fantastic and the use of color is outstanding.  A police officer is sent to investigate a blind dancer at a brothel, who might belong to the House of Flying Daggers, a group of Assassins. An amazing dance is preformed as Mei, the blind dancer,  dances and flings the long sleeves of her dress at drums that the police officer hits with beans.  The various battles are choreographed in a way to make the fights beautiful and fun to watch.  I enjoyed the movie even though some of it was confusing and difficult to follow in parts.

Now that that is out of the way, I thought that the movie, while not as good as CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON or DRAGON: THE BRUCE LEE STORY was still very well done and one of the better action movies I've seen. The production design was pretty good, along with the acting, costume design and visual effects were very good. I also thought it was nice to see an action movie that is not just action and no character development. One more thing: I said earlier that the movie had to be edited to get a PG-13 rating. It was originally deemed too violent for that rating and I think it actually should've stayed rated R. This is definitely one of the more violent PG-13 action films I've seen, along with the first TAKEN, CASINO ROYALE, THE DARK KNIGHT, TERMINATOR SALVATION, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD and THE WOLVERINE.",1412294400,,884,4.396341463414634

I appreciate the fact that you can set the settings so that I do not have to read the sub captions but rather listen to the dubbed version. Most dubbed movies you can see that the mouth and the words do not line up but this movie does not have this problem which help tell the story.

I wouldn't care about stupid, illogical or plain crazy plot points if there were plenty of martial arts action.  This movie has a couple pretty good fight scenes (but what they have aren't exactly supreme examples of top-notch choreography)  but it really needed a whole lot MORE to make up for the goofy premise.  All-in-all, that Chinese actress is pretty much wasted in this kinda' dumb movie.  I only ordered it because a blurb said it had been nominated for a foreign film Academy Award.

2231187,5,B0007Q6VXC,"I have been a lifetime student of the martial arts and Asian action movies most of my adult life.  My all time favorite one is ""Crouching tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  However, this movie (House of Flying Daggers) is a very close second on my list of great action martial art movies. You can see the professionalism in this fantastic film because it was made by the same Director of Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon.

 This gem has everything you might desire in an Asian martial arts movie.  The cast is absolutely wonderful (Ziyi Zhang, Takeshi Kaneshiro and Andy Lau). The dance scene at the beginning of this film is one of the most beautiful parts of the film. The fight scenes are nothing short of fantastic.  The story moves along at a fast pace and this is a movie that I have watched several times(twice at the show and twice after buying the DVD) because it is that good.

In conclusion, there is nothing more that I can add that has not already been written about from other reviewers; nevertheless, this movie is so fantastic that I just had to also comment on it with this short review. This is a movie for anyone who loves martial arts films.  I am glad I have it in my personal DVD library.

2231189,5,B0007Q6VXC,"This is a genuinely unique experience that tones down the magical acrobatics typical of most wuxia films and grounds the action in nature. Example: at no point, except maybe one shot near the beginning, do people appear to simply fly through the air supported only by wind. Instead, there is an absolutely brilliant scene in a vivid-green bamboo forest, where enemies traverse the treetops in pursuit of our heroes. Of course, such action is probably as impossible as the typical aerial acrobatics I mentioned, but we don't care because the bamboo forest and costumes are so gorgeous to look at!
  Nature is everywhere here. Stunning forests, vivid five-element costuming, fields of flowers...
  This film looks wonderful and sounds wonderful. That alone, regardless of the story, is enough to give this a watch. Believe it or not, though, the story is great as well! It is essentially a love story about freedom versus obligation, and you truly come to care about the characters.
  As I said above, the movie is all about aesthetics. To some, a certain aspect of the ending (hint: the weather) might seem ridiculous, but it makes sense given the film's style and values (ex: daggers that appear to have lives of their own), even if it doesn't make the slightest bit of sense on any other level. Personally, I loved the ending, and I think you will too.",1360886400,,1353,4.8354978354978355

A made-in-China movie and for the most part, it was a boring display of violent fantasy. The love interest wasn't believable and the sex scenes are totally juvenile. It was PG-13 which disturbed me very much. The ONLY thing that wasn't there was the usual cursing and blasphemy. Everything else was there, simulated sex, violence and intense melodrama which was way over the top for anyone under the age of 18.

From the beginning I noticed the story would be more interesting than the usual dramatic-martial arts Chinese movie, just because there was a duality of roles in the protagonist characters. And finally everything around those roles were linked to a love story, that was far from conventionalisms.
The costume design and scenery is incredible. The director and his team managed everything to details, e.g. the green appearance of ambient also matched with dresses of daggers. The bamboo forest, which is a known resource of Asian movies, was more than welcome because the fight scenes with tree lances.
And finally that would be incomplete without the surrealism of Chinese movies. Where human perfection of techniques is more close to fiction than reality. But at the end that fiction move myself forward to love more that culture.",1347408000,,946,5.14935064935065

2231216,1,B0007Q6VXC,"I *hate* this movie!  I saw the rating it had on Amazon and I read the description on the back of the box and I thought the movie sounded *awesome*!  Then I ended up getting it for really cheap on Blu-ray (for which the quality is not exactly stellar) and was met with one of the most unpleasant-to-watch movies I've seen in a while.

The movie starts off great.  I was very much intrigued by the story and the fight scene in the beginning is, I think, pretty cool.  But as the movie progresses and the love story unfolds between the two characters, I start enjoying the movie less and less until it finally bottoms out at the end with the conclusion of a stupid fight made stupid by the love story that sparked it.  The love story for this movie is wretchedly terrible!  I was not pulled in in the slightest and I thought it was absolutely unrealistic.  The love story is a classic example of a bad love story where all of the characters make stupid decisions and then suffer the melodramatic consequences of their actions.  The whole mess infuriated me.  Not only that, but the movie is *extremely* drawn out.  I was fighting the urge to fall asleep the whole time and was begging the movie to end.  Now, there is an interesting twist in the movie that I really liked, but it didn't make the rest of the movie any better.

Also, another point of disappointment in the movie that I want to talk about is the fight scenes.  The fight scene in the beginning is, as I said before, pretty cool.  But the vast majority of the subsequent fight scenes are very bland for me.  They aren't very impressive to watch nor are they exciting.  Another problem I had is that the fighting felt very infrequent.  Now, I'm not saying that a martial arts film has to have constant fighting in it, but that fighting should *drive* the story.  This movie succeeds on that part, but the story is so drawn out that the fighting itself gets lost in the mess and becomes a victim of the drawn out nature of the movie along with the bad love story.  Not only that, but I really felt that there were a lot of cuts in the fight scenes and, in general, they didn't look realistic.  I couldn't get pulled into something that looks so fake.  And the CG with the flying daggers?  That's just really unrealistic and further contributes to my dislike of this movie.

In summary:  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The love story was bad and, to me, was very unrealistic and even ridiculous at times.  This movie was a love story first and a martial arts film third or fourth.  The fight scenes were downright terrible and I regret paying any amount of money for this movie.  I never want to watch this movie again.",1283472000,,2696,4.368209255533199

2231220,4,B0007Q6VXC,"There's much that's beautiful in this movie: the actors, their acting, their costumes and makeup, the natural landscapes, the pacing, etc.

And the movie is also quite powerful.  The many martial arts scenes are indeed artistic and they manage to blend in elements of surreal fantasy without coming across as tacky, a triangle of romance unfolds, and, more generally, the movie is able to elicit a wide range of emotions, both simple and complex, subtle and intense.

All of this makes for a great movie in that distinctive Chinese style, but it's also dinstinctively Chinese in another way: it moves along nicely with plenty of action which builds a feeling of hope, but then everything comes tragically crashing down at the end.  This is a movie where someone can effectively die twice (!), thus amplifying our feelings of loss and grief even beyond their normally painful levels.

While some people might ""like"" this sort of tragic ending (which is very reminiscent of ancient Greek tragedy), I found that it cancelled much of my enjoyment of the movie prior to the ending, hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5.

If you're OK with tragic endings and/or like Chinese movies, I can certainly recommend this movie, but beware if you have a need for the classic American happy ending.",1274659200,,1287,4.853881278538813

2231223,2,B0007Q6VXC,"I bought this movie after reading all of the positive reviews here and usually Amazon reviewers are accurate, but not this time.  This is one of the few movies that I will be trading in.  In addition, I enjoyed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and this movie is nothing like it.  Interestingly, I reread some of the 5-star reviews below and it is amazing how many say something like, ""This is a movie where you do not really care about plot beyond its ability to move us from one beautiful set piece to the next.""  Really...a movie without a plot deserves 5-stars?  Wow, I was worried that my standards were too low!  Yes, the visuals are great but there are many other serious problems that cannot be ignored...

First, maybe if I understood the native language, I may feel differently but this movie contained some of the worst dialog that I have ever heard uttered in any film, and I like Arnold Schwarzenegger.  It made me cringe on numerous occasions.  Second, the plot was complete nonsense.  Sure, I get the whole individualism aspect but most of the story elements either didn't make sense in the end or were left unresolved.  It appears that most scenes were contrived for the sole purpose of justifying a particular special effect.  Third, the acting was shameful.  The female lead Mei is tolerable but both male leads are awful. Again, this may be partly due to the dubbed English but that is no excuse, someone should have done a better job translating because the end result is unacceptable.  Even worse, at no time did I care about any of the characters.

Finally, I had hoped for the typical Blu Ray extras where the director explains his or her motivations because maybe I missed something and believe me, this plot needs an explanation.  That also is not present.  If all you care about is visuals and an attractive cast, then I'm sure that you will enjoy this movie.  For the rest of us, five stars for the visuals and zero for the plot, dialogue and acting, a two-star movie at best.",1266364800,,2000,4.601694915254237
2231224,3,B0007Q6VXC,"'House of Flying Daggers' combines two classic storylines: the wanderings of hero-outlaws, and love among enemies.  The former is meant to showcase feats of strength and agility, the latter emotional nuance.  Unfortunately, neither element of 'Daggers' is successful.  Unlike such popular Wuxia films as 'Hero' and 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' 'Daggers' does not count any trained martial artists among its lead actors.  To make up for this deficiency, the film employs many quick cuts and digital animations in its fight sequences.  As a result, these scenes feel manufactured and fail to convince anyone who hasn't been raised on CGI-packed blockbusters.  I thought the film might redeem itself with its climactic sword fight: a form of combat that need not rest on digital crutches.  Alas, the filmmakers blunder to the last by throwing in a thoroughly computer-generated snowstorm.

Flaws on the martial-arts side of things could be forgiven if 'Daggers' offered a compelling love story as compensation.  However, the romantic dialogue is full of cliches, and though Takeshi Kaneshiro (as Jin, a heartthrob double-agent) has some very fine moments, he lapses into cartoonish behavior in key scenes, such as his introduction to the beautiful Mei (Zhang Ziyi).  Miss Zhang and Andy Lau (as Leo, Jin's partner) are superb, but none of the performances stands up to repeat viewings.  Certain scenes at the Peony Pavilion, such as Leo's conversation with the madam or his fight with Mei by the reflection pool, make little sense in light of later revelations about the characters.  In all, this is an entertaining film, but a weak one in comparison to other recent films in its genre.",1265673600,,1688,5.211111111111111
2231225,3,B0007Q6VXC,"I watched this film because I found the director's Raise the Red Lantern to be a masterpiece. House of Flying Daggers shares many of the attributes of that film: opulent costumes and sets, and lavish use of color. Unlike Raise the Red Lantern, Flying Daggers falls into the Chinese martial arts genre and as a genre film it follows a more predictable pattern.

 Set in the late Tang dynasty (9th century), the story is a love triangle played out against the backdrop of strife between the crumbling, corrupt government and rebellious clans that have arisen to fill the power vacuum. The most powerful of these, the House of Flying Daggers, has recently lost its leader, and a new leader has arisen.

Two police captains, Jin and Leo, are given ten days to kill the new leader. They devise a suberfuge designed to trick Mei, a blind dancer suspected of being the old leader's daughter, into leading them to the Flying Daggers. Along the way Jin falls in love with Mei, while Leo is revealed to be an undercover member of the Flying Daggers. Leo has also been in love with Mei (who in reality is not blind and is also a member of the Flying Daggers) for three years. The bloody resolution of this convoluted triangle is an ending worthy of Verdi.

Given a rather thin and formulaic storyline, House of Flying Daggers leans heavily on martial arts action for its appeal. There is plenty of this: swordplay, combatants turning somersaults while soaring through the air, outlandish feats of archery, and swords and daggers thrown for impossible distances with deadly accuracy.

For fans of Chinese martial arts cinema, this is undoubtedly a winner. I found the film visually ravishing, but prefer the more complex emotional terrain of Raise the Red Lantern. In any case, I will definitely sample more of Zhang Yimou's work.",1262563200,,1818,4.795527156549521

Movie:  4/5  Video Quality:  3.5/5  Audio Quality:  4.5/5  Extras:  1.5/5  Overall:  3.4/5 (rounded down in total star ranking)

Coming from Yimou Zhang, the director of my favorite wuxia film ""Hero,"" ""House of Flying Daggers"" offers a similar visual flair and some fantastic fight sequences.  I was rather pleased with the story; it's maybe not as deep as other works, but this film is a pretty fun and engrossing adventure.  Characters are decent and emotional.  But the most attractive feature is the production design, which features lots of ornate and vibrantly colorful sets and costumes, and some cool weaponry.  Photography is strong.  Music is very lovely, and accentuates the story in a couple of scenes.

This disc is not perfect.  The video is generally sharper than the DVD.  Color and contrast vary; some scenes look great while others are either a bit washed-out or a bit too dark.  A couple of scenes appear overly saturated.  It is not a grainy picture, but it does have some fuzzy noise in a lot of scenes.  Sound quality is excellent (your choice between lossless Cantonese or Dolby Digital 5.1 English dubbing with optional subtitles).  Extras include only a visual effects featurette and some storyboards; many additional featurettes and commentaries from the DVD have been omitted.",1261094400,,1318,5.089201877934272

Watching a Zhang film is like watching a moving painting.  And like Kurosawa and David Lean, who have both clearly had an impact on Zhang's own style of directing, the emphasis is on stylized, fluid motion and lush use of symbolic colors and color transitions, beauty of color and a variety of camera shots are as important as the narrative.  The plot line is simple, with a few twists and bends here and there to keep the audience guessing.  But fundamentally, it is an ""old fashioned star-crossed lovers"" tale where people, politics, and the ""rules of desire"" all clash to a worthy - if expected - climax.  One must applaud Asian directors in general for refusing to deliver the pat brands of ""happy"" or ""perfect"" endings.  The actors are beautifully chosen, and Zhang gives them enough close ups and ensemble work amidst all of the visual splendor so that they are never overwhelmed by their surroundings.  They are also highly skilled, using facial expression and ""kinds of smiles"" with a deft facility that makes long-winded dialogue refreshingly unnecessary and which makes them all completely convincing in their parts.  But it does make the dialogue there is critically important, so this is not a film where ""tell me what I missed"" is an option.  I watched it once for the story, and once just to enjoy its magnificence again.  The ""echo game"" dance sequence early in the film is not to be missed and almost hypnotically perfect.  Further, those who find Chinese music grating or annoying will have the chance to revise that opinion.  Simple where it nees to be, complex where it needs to be, a perfect compliment to the screen action without banging the viewer's eardrums half to death.

A simple tale elevated by a master director to the level of art.  Recommend.",1249603200,,1820,4.788461538461538

From his first images, Zhang plunges viewers into this romantic tragedy - a story full of mysterious twists, life and death action, intense color and design, unique use of sound and music, beautifully choreographed action, sensuality, wrenching conflict, passion and devastating loss.

The film is set in 850 AD during the Tang dynasty, when all of China was in chaos.  Caught in this time of great political instability, three warriors find themselves not only fighting on opposing sides, but unexpectedly tangled in a fatal love triangle.

The film begins with a single, bold, bright red brush stroke sweeping diagonally across the bare parchment background.  As it disappears, an identical stroke quickly follows from the opposite side, and fades.  A drop of blood falls, like a musical note on an empty score.  This marks the visual key for Zhang Yimou's drama that is masterfully supported by the film's cinematography, unusual score, and superb acting.

As the blood drops, Dai Ya's haunting bamboo flute melody is suddenly overcome by an ominous crescendo of yangqin dulcimers.  The film's title appears, center screen, boxed like an official stamp in large, red Chinese characters - House of Flying Daggers. - Zhang turbulent, heart breaking tale.

As the story opens, the emperor of China is weak and ineffectual.  Corruption and disorder are rampant. The country has split into numerous warring factions.  One of the rebel groups fighting the government is the House of Flying Daggers secreted in a forest of timber bamboo.  Because they have the support of the people, and their members have an almost magical skill with daggers and in martial arts, The House of Flying Daggers is a major threat to the government.

Two local police officers, Leo and Jin, are ordered by their general to find and kill the new leader of the House of Flying Daggers in ten days.  Believing that the daughter of the recently assassinated rebel leader is the blind dancer, and rare beauty, hiding at the local brothel, Leo devises a plan for her capture.  Jin is to go to the brothel, pretend to be drunk, and order the new girl, Mei, to dance for him.

Leo arrives after her dance.  He pretends to arrest Jin for drunkenness.  To see if the girl is really blind, Leo orders Mei to dance the Echo Game for him before he arrests her.  She performs amazingly.  This is one of the most extraordinary scenes in the film.

At police headquarters Leo threatens Mei with torture if she doesn't reveal the location of the House of Flying Daggers.  Later that night as part of the ruse, Jin rescues Mei.  He pretends to be tired of war and wants to escape with her.  Leo calculates that she will lead Jin to the House of Flying Daggers while government soldiers secretly follow behind.

Leo warns Jin not to fall for Mei.  She can be deceptive, Leo says.  Jin, who has a reputation for seducing women, assures Leo, ""I'm a free spirit.  I'm always in control.""  Unconvinced, Leo orders Jin not to turn a game into reality and ruin their plan.

War isn't the real story in this film. It's the stage on which the personal dramas of these three characters are played.  The war serves to divert, disrupt and endanger Jin and Mei's journey as they are drawn into more devastating personal struggles between loyalty and honor, and the real enemy - unnoticed and unsuspected until too late - true love, the assassin of all good intentions.  Once struck, there is no escape.

Nature's beauty is as much a character in this film as are the humans.  The wild meadow first deep in flower, and at the end, veiled in snow, which hosts choreographed battles for life, love and death.  The woods of white birch against fallen red leaves through which Jin on his magnificent horse flies like the wind itself.  Forests of ringed, timber bamboo with their hollow song and whispering leaves in which the lovers discover their true identities.

Zwang camera is often distracted away from human subjects to the pure graphic beauty of nature.  Human characters, dressed in the intricate costumes of the period, appear like exotic blossoms, jewels, within these stunning natural patterns and colors.

House of Flying Daggers is also an unusually sensual film where physical attraction turns into something much deeper and with greater consequences.

When Leo shows Mei the torture she could face at the jail, his hands caress her face and arms and hands as a love's would.  After Mei and Jin escape from jail, she bathes in a pool Jin makes for her.  To hide her identity, he seductively dresses her in men's clothing.  Later, Mei asks to know what her rescuer ""looks"" like.  She kneels before Jin and runs her fingers delicately up over his hands, then his body to his face, to feel what kind of man he is.  When they are captured by the soldiers, Mei reaches through the cage that imprisons them for Jin's hand.  Again and again the camera closes in tight on their hands clasped together.

Touch, the messenger of love.

In the end, it isn't the war that matters most to these warriors, nor their political commitments.  It's desire, jealousy and passion that are their real life and death battles.",1245110400,,5303,4.804419889502762
2231236,2,B0007Q6VXC,"First, i loved this movie... the story, cinematography, etc. is up there and reflected in the dvd related reviews here... no argument there

i just rented the bluray version from blockbuster (i have a samsung bd-p2500 player) and noticed immediately 'pixel dancing' on the screen (i have a samsung 1080p dlp tv.. so the player and tv work very well together)

having worked with graphics some, my educated guess is that the bluray version appears to be a reprocessing of the dvd digital data.  the resolution on screen is NOT at all at par with any other bluray disk i've viewed so far.  it shows artefactual noise of digital image upscaling

I was excited in anticipation of the Blu Ray as the amazing color palette of the director should have jumped off the screen--

Too bad Sony, who did a poor job on the dvd pass 5 years ago on this film, just dumped off their badly xfered hdcam to the new bluray format a few years ago.  Such a shame to see such an amazing film just go into the gutter.  This film looked fantastic in the theaters - it could look just the same on Bluray!
Hopefully, this will not occur on the film Hero, a similarly shot martial arts film, which is due for a bluray xfer as well.  Sure, a lot of the first titles to go out on Bluray years ago were poorly mastered - let's just hope this changes for the better - because so far there is only one chance to do it right!",1235174400,,724,4.006944444444445
2231243,3,B0007Q6VXC,"To Sony video:  If you are going to put a beautiful, visually sumptuous movie like ""House of Flying Daggers"" on Blu-Ray, for heaven's sake, DO IT RIGHT! If this was a review for the standard DVD, I would give it 5 stars because I love this movie. But I'm dropping the rating because this is a review of the Blu-Ray disc, and frankly, it's a disappointment.

Unless you are a freak for high-definition, high-end sound, there is no point in upgrading from standard DVD to Blu-Ray for this movie. Sony did nothing to improve the video quality. Having seen what can be done in Blu-Ray HD, I have to say, shame on Sony for not taking the time to give HoFD the treatment it deserves. It's not an old movie! ""Casablanca,"" which came out in 1942, received a gorgeous Blu-Ray treatment. So no excuses for Sony. They even dropped the long ""making of/behind the scenes"" feature from the Blu-Ray release extras, so instead of getting more, a buyer is actually receiving less.

If you are a fan of Takeshi Kaneshiro and want to see him in HD, take my advice and spend your money on ""Perhaps Love"" or ""Red Cliff"" in Blu-Ray. Both are outstanding.",1232236800,,1132,4.512195121951219

There is no fairy-tale ending and questions remain, which is one of its great strengths. Definitely worth owning and watching again and again.

One negative comment, though: there are several scenes where a rape or sex is initiated (but interrupted) and it feels contrived because they are all nearly identical and about half seem unnecessary to the plot.",1229990400,,646,5.1923076923076925

2231249,3,B0007Q6VXC,"This was one of the Blu-Ray discs that I bought at the same time I bought my player, as I was guessing that the vibrant colors of this film would look great in HD.  Unfortunately, there is so much film grain and visual noise that I had to drastically reduce the backlight and the color saturation on my LCD in order to make it less distracting.  But this eliminated the primary artistic virtue of the film: its colorful palette.  If this had been what Blu-Ray had to offer, I would have returned the player immediately, as I had seen better picture quality from upscaled DVDs and from HD downloads in 720p.  Thankfully, I was guided towards ""I, Robot"" and ""Ratatouille"" and saw what Blu-Ray really has to offer, and it is worth the price of admission.  But the shoddy presentation of ""House of Flying Daggers"" nearly soured me on the whole experience before I really got started.

I rather enjoyed this film on standard-definition cable TV when I first saw it.  The colors are marvelous, the fight scenes are fluid, and the plot is simple but effective.  The main character, Wind, is kind of a jerk at first, but he grows on you a little by the end.  I would describe the acting as competent, even a bit above-average for what you'd expect.  For a foreign language film, we English-speaking viewers need decent acting through facial expressions and body language, and there's enough here to adequately serve the story.

I don't know what equipment was used to shoot this film, but I hope that a great transfer could be done one day when Blu-Ray has settled into its place as the dominant disc format.  This is the type of film that has great potential as an HD viewing experience, but it hasn't come close to realizing that quite yet.  If you have and enjoy the DVD of this movie, I would recommend against buying the Blu-Ray at this time.",1219536000,,1839,4.553191489361702

2231253,5,B0007Q6VXC,"Government Solider Jin was sent to find, and capture, the head of the Flying Daggers; a rebel group bent on destroying the Government. Jin found the daughter of the head the Flying Daggers, a beautiful young blind girl named Mei. She's the key to finding where the rebel group is based. But Jin, quite the Casanova, never though he's actually fall in love with her....

So begins The House of Flying Daggers, a beautiful movie that'll sweep you up in the first beginning moments, and leave you in tears in the final minutes. With a beautiful Score, breathtaking theme song sung by Opera star Kathleen Battle, superb Cast, and stunning visuals, this movie will sweep you off your feet.

Takashi Kaneshiro plays Jin, a head Soldier in the Government sent to find, as I said above,  the head of a rebel group. Takashi is Asia's Johnny Depp; he has the looks, and talent to prove it. His acting as the Casanova Jin will have you laughing in the beginning, and swooning in the middle as he falls for the person he's been sent to capture.

Ziyi Zhang (Memoirs of a Geisha, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) plays Mei, a blind young woman who is the daughter of the leader of the Flying Daggers. Ziyi will captivate you as soon as she steps on the screen. She draws and sucks you in, as if she very well casts a spell on you. Her acting, like her beauty, is flawless.

And don't forget top notch actor, Andy Lau who plays Takashi's head superior. I don't won't to spoil to much, but there are secrets and twists surrounding this character that'll leave you shocked and breathless.

Shigeru Umebayashi has made a beautiful soundtrack indeed, which will have you closing your eyes and listening, believing you're in China yourself. Without a doubt you'll want to go out and buy the soundtrack for yourself, and listen to the breathtaking sounds. Kathleen Battle, world renowned Opera singer, lends her voice to a beautiful heart wrenching ending song. While I'm not a big Opera fan, this song is so full of sadness and emotion, it'll leave you with a sob ready to escape your throat.

The visuals are stunning, the costumes gorgeous and mind blowing. Action scenes are wonderfully choreographed, and sweeping camera angles are gorgeous.

As for questionable material (for you parents) there is no foul language, the action scenes are done tastefully without gore. There are a few sensual scenes, but nothing is really shown.

Before I finish this review, I must warn against one thing. The plot twists are so mind blowing, so shocking, this movie will leave you with your mouth hanging open. The Ending sequence will leave you in tears, so be forewarned....",1214006400,,2646,4.734782608695652

There is a beauty so deep, the viewer is mesmerized: characters/actors who play them, scenery/setting, astonishing martial arts movements unlike what the viewer finds in other movies, costumes, the use of colors and light. Director Zhang Yimou assembles the parts to create a whole, a film so deep in beauty that the viewer's focus is a totality in that frame. My breath was whooshed away!

The two leads, Ziyi Zhang--she with the delicate face in a powerfully controlled yet delicate body, and Takeshi Kaneshiro--he with his masculine beauty and graceful arrogance, play off each other with consummate skill as actors and martial artists. The third in this inevitable fate-must-play-out film is Andy Lau, a man's man who plays his control until the last second when his passion must out. Watching the interplay of these three give-and-take, back-and-forth is so unsettling. The casting is perfect!

The framework for the film is the House of Flying Daggers, a group of female martial artists, who oppose the corrupt Tang government and seek to embarrass it when necessary and opportune. Although this secretive group is the raison d'etre for the story, it is the story of the three characters who absorb our interest. And what is obvious becomes the source of secrets. With the necessity of secret organizations comes the well spring of secrets--one by one, several times, always keeping the viewer a little more off-balance.

In a time of corruption, the unusual becomes the norm. Soldiers walking the trees in battle becomes common rather than a seemingly magical skill exerted by only a special few. Every person is a remarkable handler of martial arts instruments. Everyone fights equally well. Who is to win?

The final conflict is played out across a meadow in a snowstorm. White has been described in literature as representative of ""the inscrutable cosmic  mystery."" Why these people? Why this battle? Why this ending?

I think perhaps I love this film as much as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" for that mystical element that is part of Asian films (in my limited experience), the Taoist belief in accepting things for the way they are and if challenging this, falling subject to one's fate anyway. The film then reflects both the Greek dramatic belief of the inevitability of fate and the Shakespearian technique of mistaken and double identities.

2231270,5,B0007Q6VXC,"Decades of fine Chinese film-making seemed to have reached a peak when ""Crouching Tiger"" was embraced so completely by the American film-going public. (The Chinese thought it was mediocre and couldn't understand the fuss.) Director Zhang Yimou has made fine films for years, and 2 of them, ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" reached American shores in 2003. ""House"" made more top 10 lists, but ""Hero"" was the official Chinese entry for the Oscars. ""House of Flying Daggers"" is a wonderful action piece beautifully embracing a terrific love story. Yimou's trademark use of gorgeous color schemes is again awesome, and the casting of Takeshi Kaneshiro, Andy Lau & Ziyi Zhang has to be the most pretty trio of actors put in any one film. Ms. Zhang is indeed luminous. Mr. Yimou's later ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" was disappointing, though still pretty to look at. The Tang Dynasty seems to appeal to Mr. Yimou, allowing him to create his image of that most opulent period. I was highly entertained.",1189728000,,999,4.9171597633136095

2231272,2,B0007Q6VXC,"I was a great fan of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, so, when I heard that another wuxia film was being brought to the United States, I flocked to the movie theater to see this one.  Director Zhang Yimou (HERO) sets the scene for us with broad use of color and drama.  I can't argue that the opening dance sequence with the blind courtesan (Ziyi Zhang) isn't pretty eyepopping.  However, the convoluted plot left MUCH to be desired.  Granted, I am up for an intriguing plot centered on a battle of wits anyday (I loved HERO), this film was, for me, one melodrama after another.  Without giving away too much of the plot, I will say that I was particularly offended by one depiction of rape and abuse that then blossoms into a relationship between victim and victimizer.  Also, there were some scenes intended to be highly dramatic in tone, and I recall several members of the audience giggling over the absurdity of the thoroughly unbelievable acting and the stylized violence (a familiar sequence in Chinese wuxia cinema is that where you see blood dripping from the slain/maimed individual's mouth).  There aren't really heros here--just different degrees of villainhood, and, for the most part, it's a battle based on manipulation, and it all stems from the society of the House of Flying Daggers and interrogating those possibly affiliated with the organization.  I would advise you to skip this one.  It's just a little too much......I can't imagine how it transfers to the small screen, as a DVD, but I would imagine it just looks absurd on a smaller scale.",1186876800,,1563,4.802238805970149
2231273,3,B0007Q6VXC,"`House of Flying Daggers' is truly no `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.  That's in no way to say it's not visually stunning and engrossing, it just lacks a little of that flare and a lot of that plot that made `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' so brilliant.  Director Zhang Yimou keeps his film heavy on the action but very light on substance.  It still delivers, don't get me wrong, and I was not entirely disappointed while it's credits began to roll but I will say that when you've been spoiled with something like Ang Lee's `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' you begin to wish that every Asian film could be that wonderful.

The film centers around a group of rebels referring to themselves as the House of Flying Daggers, or more specifically around one of their members, a blind woman named Mei posing as a showgirl.  This rebel group is in direct conflict with the government and so two officials, Leo and Jin devise a plan to infiltrate the rebel's lair.  Jin disguises himself as a lone rebel himself, rescues her from the hands of government officials and offers to escort her back to her group.  Along the way though, they are met with adversity.  The governor, unknowing of Leo and Jin's plan, has sent out his best soldiers to track down and kill Mei and Jin.  The fight sequences that follow are brilliantly choreographed and directed.  In fact, I'd be tempted to say they rival or maybe even transcend those in Lee's lauded film, but I haven't seen `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' in a few years and so I'm not the best judge at the moment.  The fight within the trees alone though is breathtaking.

As has been mentioned, the use of color within this film really takes it to another level.  The fight sequences are even more spectacular thanks to the wide range of reds and greens, whites and yellows all wrapped up within the natural backdrop to the scenes.  It's beautiful to look at, elegant and effortlessly put together.  The actor's movements are so well calculated, so controlled, and they perfectly complement the mood each scene intends to portray.

`House of Flyer Daggers' fails in the one aspect of plot, for everything else is truly splendid.  The above plot in itself would have sufficed, and it does have more twists and turns than an episode of `The Sopranos' but it tries a little too hard to transfer into a love story and it's there that it falls flat.  I don't want to give away too much of those `twists and turns' but I will say that it loses it's focus towards the end, and instead of delivering a final battle between rebel's and government (a battle I was salivating over in expectation of) it gives us a battle between star-crossed lovers that delivers in beauty but fails to deliver in emotional depth and thus becomes just another fight.

The acting is decent all the way around, but Ziyi Zhang is truly the standout.  Her performance is so tempered, so controlled it transcends the performances of her cast mates and becomes award worthy, Oscar nomination worthy even.  She's the only actor in the cast that is able to really connect with the audience, in such a deep way that even though I found the love story aspect a little phony and unbelievable I believed her character, I believed her side of that love and that in itself was a major accomplishment for Zhang.  Ziyi has got quite the resume going for herself, and she has all the potential in the world to be an Oscar winning actress.  Once the academy learns to embrace her stylized performances over her more Americanized (say `Memoirs of a Geisha') then they will see the beauty and grace that we all see.

The film, while far from perfect, still offers quite a bit for the far on this form of martial arts film.  The direction is top notch and the scenery just as breathtaking as the choreography.  I surely enjoyed myself and would watch this film again.  So sit back and enjoy, just don't expect anything too deep emotionally, just some beautiful, graceful and in the end brutal battles that more than make up for what this film lacks.",1186531200,,4041,4.631136044880785
2231274,5,B0007Q6VXC,"It is very disheartening to see a great number of reviews comparing this movie to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero.  While they have similarities I can not help but feel that the comparisons are being done mainly because the audience is trying to grasp onto something familiar.  Let us not compare apples to oranges simply because they were both grown in China, yes?

When this movie hit American theaters I wanted so badly to see it but I never had the chance.  Quite some time passed and I eventually saw it available for rent.

The first impression was a strong one.  The movie is vivid and saturated and the attention to detail painstaking.  To cite an example, watch the tack used on the horses in the movie.  It is all completely custom and each piece different than the next.  The style is the same from piece to piece but none are alike.  That speaks volumes on the dedication and quality put into the costuming and props.  It is one thing to put true effort in to the actors attire but to really go as far as to make sure even the animals are properly turned out is impressive for this genre.

I feel that there isn't much left to say about the story.  Nearly 300 reviews tell you it is an unrealistic tale of love, deception and lies...  And finally, remuneration.  However, I will disagree with many and say that the story is not empty nor is it frivolous.  To have a love like Mei and Jin's is the dream of many, but at the same time a complete and utter nightmare.  Their blind devotion and obsessive tendencies are dangerous and lead to the suffering of others besides themselves.

The action truly takes a back set to the love and drama but is treated with the highest respect.  The scenes are beautiful and some incredibly feminine and enchanting.

The story is fanciful and romantic.  The ending is heart breaking but fulfilling.  Love and obsession merge with greed and retribution.  I personally feel the story is quite realistic given the circumstances.  No good can come of passion so strong and rampant.

I never tire of this film.  I have long since added it to my collection and find yet another reason to love it each time I view it.",1186012800,,2165,4.5012853470437015

But all of this painstaking art is in service of a predictable and overly-long story.  If you've ever watched a movie, you know about 5 minutes into this one where it's going and how it's going to end.  And man, does this movie take its time getting there.  When you essentially have 3 characters, it's tough to round out 2 hours of viewing time with those three people - especially when the story is nothing new.

It wouldn't surprise me if the director Yimou Zhang had seen ""Mou gaan dou"" (Infernal Affairs) and decided to remake it in a martial arts context.

Perhaps the best scene in the film is the one shot in the Bamboo forest. This looked absolutely breathtaking and on my 42"" widescreen TV, sadly I never saw the film at the cinema but it must have been stunning. The use of colour in this scene, and throughout the film is another amazing aspect of the film, and even if you don't have a special interest in martial arts, you may well enjoy this in the same way as you might enjoy looking at a great painting.

This isn't a Western concept in film making, but works better for those who are given to deeper levels of thinking.  So, if you're highly extroverted and addicted to sensationalism is Western films, spare yourself and watch something like Die Hard.

This film is in my top-drawer collection, along with the other rare masterpieces in cinema.  What a genuine and moving work of art, this film.",1177545600,,737,4.666666666666667
2231283,5,B0007Q6VXC,"""What a Beauty of a film"" was my first reaction after seeying this great work of art.
These are the films Chinese cinema are all about. ""House of the Flying Daggers"" is a powerful story about love and war that has made a stunning impression.

The style Director Zhang Yimou puts in his films is well known for it's absolutely stunning scenery. The way he fills up the screen is delicious eye candy and with this film it's no difference.
From the locations to the way of filming, from the lighting to the costumes: it is and looks absolutely gorgeous. We've seen in his grand film ""Hero"", that next to the scenery Yimou also knows how to film his actionscenes and this film is the absolute proof of that. Great camerawork and strong editing make the fights tense and a joy to watch.
But this film isn't all about action: It's mostly a powerful drama and romantic film that shows emotions that are very well brought by the actors.
Therefor the cast is perfect: Zhang Ziyi is so believable and realistic as the blind woman Mei. She acts with heart and gives a wonderful, stunning performance. Takeshi Kaneshiro has also been greatly cast as the man who falls in love with the her. He plays his character well and is great to see on the screen. Andy Lau knows how to portray his character and gives a great performance as well.
A cast you can't go wrong with.

So unlike ""Hero"", this film is mostly centered on the romance and the love the main characters are experiencing.
So that element can be seen as the beating heart of the film, with around that fights and action.

So if you loved ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Hero"" and haven't seen this one yet: what are you waiting for?!
If you haven't seen those films and want to see what the real beauty and excitement of cinema is all about: watch this one and be blown away.
Because with a story of great twists and switches, love and hate, stunning beauty, fantastic scenery, beautiful music, powerful emotion, tense action and great acting (I can go on and on): ""House of the Flying Daggers"" is another triumph out of China that shows a film that is a masterpiece in every powerful and gorgeous way.",1174953600,,2155,4.506393861892583

  The musical score is excellent, it enhances the mood of the scenes even further. The acting is also very convincing, your hearts will go out to these characters.

  The story is simple, but has some interesting twists, and is told very well. Compared to most movies there is very little dialogue, but you won't miss it.

2231298,2,B0007Q6VXC,"House of Flying Daggers is almost everything you've heard it to be, a beautifully composed and designed film with ballet-like fight scenes.  The principle actors are attractive and engaging, the script offers surprising twists, but the end - the end undoes all the effort.  If you've seen director Zhang Yimou's Hero, then there won't be many surprises about what happens to the characters in Flying Dagger's love triangle.  The ending is also reminiscent of The Promise, another big-budget martial arts film about a doomed love triangle.  But where the endings of Hero and The Promise were annoyingly hokey, the conclusion to Flying Daggers is laughably bad.

Death seemingly never ends.  One character falls with a gasp, a close-up shows eyes closed, the other characters anguish in reaction.  But wait!  The dead one isn't really dead and comes crawling back a few minutes later.  The same character appears to die yet again and lies so long in the field that the body is buried under snow.  A protracted fight ensues between the remaining characters in which they stab each other in the back with broadswords - yet remain alive to finish out the scene with the corpse that has crawled out of the snow.  Blood from the ice-covered cadaver comes gushing out of a wound like water out of a hose, Monty Python-like, the music cues the final-final-final death, the body falls, and all you can do is roll your eyes and hope that this really is THE END.  But it isn't.  The corpse-to-be opens its eyes one last time to choke out a farewell and an impaled survivor walks into the snowy horizon.

Set in ancient China, this is the story of Jin and Leo, two ambitious police deputies who are bent on brining down the fabled `House of Flying Daggers', a group of anti-government terrorists and collecting the rich reward being offered. They use a beautiful young blind girl named Mei as their unwitting pawn, hoping she will lead them to the group leader. Along the way the story becomes one of betrayal, intrigue, and forbidden and unrequited love. It's all so well done that you don't realize until the final credits that there are really only 4 characters in the entire film, with everyone else being simply an extra. The cinematography is stunning, and the use of colors throughout to convey mood borders on impressionistic.

2231303,4,B0007Q6VXC,"""House of Flying Daggers"" is one of the best-looking movies you'll ever see.  Yimou Zhang, known for such over-the-top spectacles as 2002's Jet Li flick, ""Hero,"" may be the most visually exuberant director this side of Baz Luhrmann.  Whether it's an ornate reception hall, or a lush bamboo forest, or a snow-covered landscape, ""House"" cannot offer anything less than a breathtaking scene.

It sure helps to have three incredibly attractive, athletic leads for your love triangle.  Zhang Ziyi, who captivated audiences with her breakout performance in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" plays Mei, a blind dancer who may or may not be a link to the rebellious cult, the House of Flying Daggers.  The House wants to bring down the current corrupt regime, and they use assassination and mystical forces - not to mention their seemingly magical daggers! - to achieve their ends.  Mei's elfin beauty is, as expected, off the charts.

Two soldiers, Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and Leo (Andy Lau), decide to infiltrate the House using Mei as bait.  It's not a spoiler to say that these two men have ""issues"" with Mei . . . ""House of Flying Daggers"" is one of those movies that really isn't so much about the details of the plot.  The plot is a pretext for stringing together heart-stopping scenes like a fight atop a bamboo forest (using the bamboo as missiles), or a clever ""follow the leader"" dance scene involving pebbles, a gazillion drums, and the blind Mei.

""House"" never really ascends the heights of ""Crouching Tiger,"" but is on a par with ""Hero.""  There is a melancholy air that permeates both ""Hero"" and ""House,"" and while there are some stirring scenes, there's nothing as heart-pounding as, for example, the wondrous fight between Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh with its frenetic drum-beat.  And for all the build-up that there is for the ultimate clash between the House and the regime, it never really comes to pass.  Instead, we focus exclusively on Mei, Jin and Leo.

This is a minor quibble, but I'm trying to reserve five-star ratings to the truly spectacular movies, and ""House"" just doesn't quite make it.  But it is still well-worth your time.",1160092800,,2151,4.887052341597796
2231304,4,B0007Q6VXC,"The very first time I saw this amazing film I was wrapped around its finger. Everything about it is perfect from its scenery to the perfectly paced and executed fight scenes. After the first time you see it the more and more you watch it the more you notice little things that are big. Basically the things that made the film beautiful start to unravel. One thing I hate that I am seeing a lot of is the digital blood, so when someone is hit with one of the daggers it looks computer generated when the dagger hits someone and then the fake unneeded blood comes out. There are also the daggers that look digital and for some reason they feel the need to do a bunch of flips and turns while the dagger is in midair. Some of the scenery looks fake like in one scene Jin and Mei are walking down a hill and there is a very pretty background of trees and waterfalls but you notice that it's fake and looks like a painting.

With all of the fake stuff bugging me about this film I still really like it and have a hard time giving it anything under 4 stars. The acting holds it up because every character is important and every actor plays their part perfectly, you even start to feel the characters emotions. What I love most is that this film is very very hard to predict and figure out before it ends. It has the ability to keep a love story and a mystery going on all at the same time, cause you really want to know what is going to happen with Mei and Jin because there are a lot of people who don't want them together. One good thing is that the flaws are hidden well enough that it won't really ruin the rest of the movie for you.

But it seemed like, the forest the two characters take a journey through dominated the whole movie in a way I wish it hadn't.  I think it would have been better if they shot some scenes outside that bamboo forest, if maybe they shot to the emperor, or to a little village.  We had too much to focus on the forest, which means, they drowned us silly in the green of the leaves.  Which was fine, except here, you are, as the viewer, watching these two characters' every move, and they are being chased by these soldiers, and yet where the soldiers come from is very abstract.  It is just a theory; you do not see the actual empire.  I would have liked to see that empire, or to see that village.  It would have painted a much clearer picture to me.

2231309,5,B0007Q6VXC,"Better than ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" this story gradually reveals an unexpected love triangle which contains amazing martial arts choreography woven into a stunning visual masterpiece of epic proportions. The unusual love-triangle is heart-stopping ... the fight scene at the conclusion of the film is a gut-wrenching and powerful. The close-up scenes of pure emotions reveal both artistic cinematography as well as superb acting: whether it is desire, bliss, lust, rage, doubt, torment, suffering or other emotions ... the visual effects are absolutely amazing.

This film has it all: gorgeous period costumes designed by Emi Wada, spectacular landscapes like delicate water colors and oil paintings on canvas and visually pleasing actors and actresses ... They are fairy-tale like in their magnificence. The mountain scenery is breath-taking as the fall foliage paints a collage of orange, red, fading green and brown leaves which are exceptionally stunning from a distance. The field of wild flowers where Jin and Mei playfully discover the depth of their true feelings for each other is a natural wonder. They express their feelings gently at first and then with passionate abandon ... The martial arts fighting scenes in the bamboo forest where the government soldiers ambush Jin and Mei during their escape is exceptionally creative and well filmed ...

This enhanced DVD has a great interview with the director Yimou Zhang who explains that bamboo forests have been symbolic of martial arts in films from long ago and he felt it must be included. Watching the interview, the viewer learns to appreciate the amount of planning and background work which is painstakingly done to perfection to film this artistic masterpiece ... Ziyi Zhang who plays Mei, lived with a blind girl for two months to learn the proper body and head movements in order to play a blind girl accurately. Also, she had studied traditional Chinese dance when a young girl which helped her learn the choreographed dance and martial arts movements in her outstanding performance in the scene for General Leo at the Peony Pavillion. The original music in the film is fantastic, Kathryn Battle sings the theme song which is sung by Mei during her dance performance for Captain Jin. It is a totally heart warming performance that captivates Jin and wins over the viewers ...

The story begins in a brothel called ""Peony Pavillion"" where government officers visit for a tryst with the ladies and to be entertained ... The visual effects of the establishment are extraordinairily authentic, the set design, bright colors, flowers, and weapons on the wall are all extremely balanced and harmonious ... After Mei, the blind dancing girl does a magnificent martial arts and dance performance for General Leo, she is taken prisoner. She is believed to be the blind daughter of the dead leader of a clandestine organization, called ""House of Flying Daggers"" who are resisting government authority and creating unrest and rebellion against the Tang Dynasty. General Leo's plan is to flush out the covert operatives ... but unexpected emotional relationships develop to confound his plans. How the love triangle is revealed and resolved is the stuff of which great films are made. The story line itself is deceptively simple ... but its execution is thoroughly unequalled. The film expresses how in the short time of three days true feelings of love can develop with unequalled depth and passion. It can grow into becoming one of the most complex human emotions ever put on film. Erika Borsos (pepper flower)",1152921600,,3579,5.156626506024097

2231312,5,B0007Q6VXC,"I highly recommend ""House of the Flying Daggers."" a movie filmed in vibrant colors, beautiful Tang dynasty costumes with a plot full of action, surprises and twists. Zhang Ziyi playing Mei shows again why she is, in my opinion, the most talented young actress in contemporary Asia. As well as being a very beautiful young woman, Zhang Ziyi, who studied dance, works very hard in preparting for her roles whether in ""House of the Flying Daggers"" or ""Memoirs of a Geisha."" I was epecially very impressed by Mei's fascinating and brilliantly filmed dance performance near the beginning of the movie.

  Other reviewers have aptly summarized the basic plot of the movie, so I will not further discuss it. What is especially worthwhile about buying the DVD version are the excellent supplemental features. I greatly enjoyed Zhang Yimou and Zhang Ziyi's informative and interesting commentary about the movie. One comes away with a much better understanding of the movie and how ""House of the Flying Daggers"" was made after listening to their commentary as the movie is played out.

  I will give one relatively minor and entertaining example from their commentary. Zhang Yimou and Zhang Ziyi comment about how some people in the western world seem to have a hard time telling Asian actors apart. They amusingly make the same comment about how they view some people from the western world. The device the director employs to help some westerners distinguish between Leo and Jin in the beginning of the movie is rather funny.",1151366400,,1518,4.980237154150197

2231314,5,B0007Q6VXC,"Ziyi Zhang's performance as the strong-willed, kick-ass heroine Mei in House of Flying Daggers deserves a second look, now that the DVD release of Memoirs of a Geisha continues to catapult the Chinese actress into American movie fame.

 In House of Flying Daggers, Director Zhang Yimou (Hero) shows us that you can only control so much in life and love before fate takes over.

 Ziyi (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) plays Mei, a beautiful, blind dancer who may be the daughter of the murdered leader of the House of Flying Daggers, a rogue gang of Robin Hood-esque fighters in the middle of a war with China's corrupt Tang dynasty.

 With hidden plot twists, people are never who they seem. And when Leo (Andy Lau) sends Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) on a mission to discover Mei's true identity, a complicated love triangle exploring the differences between love, lust, duty and devotion develops.

 Oscar-nominated Director of Photography Zhao Xiaoding captures the culture of ancient China with superb compositions. A constantly moving camera complements the acrobatic nature of the fight scenes, and the special effects are typical of the slightly over-the-top martial arts genre. However, it is Xioading's wide, sweeping shots of misty bamboo forests, sunlit woods and snow-covered fields that truly make the film.

 Nature plays an important role, and Yimou uses changing seasons to show the passing of time. The natural beauty of China's landscapes also adds greater perspective. In one shot, Mei stands in a bright green kimono--a thin green stick in a forest of skinny gray trees.  The forest overwhelms Mei, making her troubles seem small.

 A simple score of traditional Chinese instruments and the title song ""Beauty"" create a peaceful yet heartbreaking atmosphere that espouses the theme of the film. Love can't be controlled, but it can be taken away.",1149120000,,1859,5.156666666666666

MY FEEDBACK:

The first time I watched this movie I had just finished watching Hero which I liked a lot. This only led to me comparing the two instead of enjoying this movie for what it is.

After talking with some co-workers who like this movie better than Hero, I decided to give it another try...over a year later. I loved it!

The cinematography was rich and the colors vibrant.

The drama and acting engaging and believable.

The themes of love and self-sacrifice strong.

The action bordered on fantasy, but was till very entertaining and fast-paced.

The sound, especially with the dumb beat soundtrack, added suspense and action to the story. Turn up the volume when you watch it!!

As with Hero the ending isn't the happiest in the world but sometimes the only plausible one.

OVERALL: I liked it a lot and if you haven't seen it rent it. If you like it as much as I did, buy it and watch it again and again. Truly a ""marvel"" of movie making that attempts to touch more of our senses than just the visual",1147996800,,1421,4.533333333333333

He travels with her but is secretly trying to find the Flying Daggers and their new leader. On their journey... he falls for her and she falls for him. Needless to say, I can't say much more for it will give away all of the plot. I can say that House of Flying Daggers has great action scenes, great dancing scenes, and a love story that will make your heart swoon and break.

Watch this movie. Don't watch it in the english dub either because you will loose the feel of what the director intended you to feel. Watch it in the original subtitled version.

The story itself is very touching and the ending is very emotional. I found myself captivated in the film, more than I thought I would have been.

But, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", the martial arts is not true to the discriminating eye of visual common sense.  And it's not just these two films.  Most movies nowadays, are depending on special effects more than the actual performance of the actor.

Martial arts films have changed.  The authenticity of the art of ""karate"" is now lost to the art of ""special effects"".  When we use to watch a Bruce Lee or a Jackie Chan film, we were watching true martial arts.  Not fake performances embellished with special effects.  Here, we are watching these people running on air, and even simulating taking flight as they fight, and it just looks embarrassingly silly.

This film doesn't really mention that the people from the ""House of Flying Daggers"" are magicians, or godly warriors, or some kind of otherworldly spirits, but you would think that they are since their actions are unrealistic, flying about and the such.  Take the simple rule of ""inertia"" for example.  When they throw a knife, or spear, an article of clothing, or even peanuts, it seems strange than not only does a simple toss cause these ""thrown"" things to travel great distances, but they also seem to gain speed and even ascend as it gets further away.  This defies the common laws of simple inertia.  This is where the authenticity of the film is greatly reduced of any realistic probabilities that such warriors could ever exist.

I guess I'm just living in the past.  Martial Arts films use to be so much more special when the actors were actually world acclaimed martial arts experts, performing with no camera tricks or special effects.  It use to be something very ""real"".

The art of the actual performance is gone.",1145145600,,1858,4.804416403785489
2231326,4,B0007Q6VXC,"Here's one word that sums up this film: Beauty. The plot of ""House of Flying Daggers"" (original title: ""Shi mian mai fu"") is lacking, but in a way it's made up for with the intoxicating sets, costumes, and exquisite love story. Zhang Yimou backs away from the grandeur of ""Hero"" in favor of a more intimate story.

It's 859 A.D., near the end of the corrupt Tang Dynasty. A guerilla rebellion called House of the Flying Daggers (who are able to throw knives at great distances) has sprung up against the government. Despite the loss of their leader, the rebels are thriving. Deputy Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) decides to go undercover to infiltrate the House, and he tries to get the trust of blind courtesan Mei (Zhang Ziyi), daughter of the House's dead leader.

But soon he begins to fall in love with Mei, jeopardizing his loyalties, while Mei herself is experiencing confusion. But government officials want Mei dead because of her sympathies -- and even worse, they don't realize that Jin is undercover. To make things worse, Jin is not the only rival for Mei's love -- his best friend is as well.

Director Zhang Yimou apparently said that ""Hero"" was the warm-up to ""House of Flying Daggers."" It does seem more polished and fully realized, without the ""Rashomon"" storytelling. Instead of a war movie, it's a mixture of fairy-tale romance and beauty, and spies and guerilla warfare. The final half-hour is the stumbling block, where some plot threads come unravelled. Things get pretty confusing.

Zhang doesn't drop the ball as far as stylism goes -- color and exquisite details are in every frame. They have an almost intoxicating effect, and so do the action sequences. One of the most memorable scenes is Ziyi performing the ""echo game,"" where she strikes drums in a particular rhythm with her flowing clothing. Not to mention a balletic, dreamlike fight in a bamboo forest, with the participants soaring and dipping like Cirque de Soleil dancers. It's all completely unreal, but there lies its beauty, like a painting of the sky that focuses on the sun and not the clouds.

This is entirely Zhang Ziyi's picture -- since her debut in ""The Road Home,"" Ziyi has proved herself a wonderful actress. ""House of Flying Daggers"" focuses mostly on Ziyi, and she gives a truly exquisite performance, particularly when she pretends to be a blind woman -- watch her face. The two supporting actors, Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro, do a solid job in their roles, particularly Kaneshiro, who brings plenty of life to what could have been another cliched bad-cop-turned-lover.

""House of Flying Daggers"" is worth seeing just to see -- it's visual ecstacy packed around a fairly typical love triangle plot and a slightly disappointing final half hour. But the sights alone in this intimate love story are exquisite.",1144540800,,2807,4.88655462184874

Visually, House of Flying Daggers is an excellent film.  Simply the story is Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and a girl called Mei (Ziyi Zhang).  Seems rather straight-forward.

Insert this into the context of Tang Dynasty China, with Jin working for the government and Mei is suspected to be the associate of a roving gang of assassins, for another layer of complexity.  The plot twists and turns with the addition of new details as the story progresses.

My favourite scene, is when Jin goes undercover to the Peony Pavilion to first look for Mei.  The sets are colourful and combined with the action, the music and the way the plot unfolds at this point, makes it a viewing pleasure.

The film moves on from there, of course, with sound, colour, movement and plot twists.

The only downfall (why to my mind the movie doesn't deserve 5 stars) is that while the main storyline of the love story ""finishes"", the subplot relating to the existence of the ""House of Flying Daggers"" is cut off and left me feeling that (a) the story was only a love story, and (b) more could have (and should have been done) to explain the existence and demise of the House of Flying Daggers.",1142985600,,1202,4.605633802816901

First of all, it is not a Kung-Fu movie.  It's really a love story with some fancy Kung-Fu scenes thrown in for special effects.  I can suspense my belief to accept people flying through forest and daggers travelling miles to reach their inteded targets, but I can't bring myself to believe how the two main characters can fall head-over-heel in love in the three non-consequntial days they spent together.  The movie did a lousy job in developing their relationship and I cannot see how wisecracks and some kung-fu fightings can lead to Romeo and Juliet.  The characters interaction felt superficial and to see that they would sacrifice their lives for each other at the end of that brief encounter, I feel I must have missed some thing major in the movie.

Except for the few kung-fu scences, the movie lacked direction and at time appeared long-winded.  It's no where near as entertaining as Kung-Fu Hustle or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

2231336,2,B0007Q6VXC,"""House of Flying Daggers"" seems to have appealed to the zeitgeist - at least of the relatively small but reliable American demographic for Sony Pictures Classics and the like - as an instant classic. Even after my second viewing, I'm baffled by its success. Placed beside other recent wuxia imports like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Hero"", HoFD is wholly unremarkable as a wuxia movie; placed beside Zhang Yimou's outstanding oeuvre, it's not even a good movie.

The storyline is nearly as convoluted as wuxia ""classics"" like ""Kung Fu Colt Master"" (whose unfortunate English title bears no relation to the original title). Indeed, it's impossible to escape that association for any experienced viewer of wuxia, and it seems likely to be intentional. Coupling art-movie pretension and gloss with B-movie kitsch can be risky, however. The result in this case is inconsistent characterization, nonsensical plotting, and uneven tone and pacing.

""Hero"" offers an interesting contrast to this movie. Both share the typical wuxia intricacy of plot, but ""Hero"" brings this generic complexity into harmony with a modern and sophisticated approach to storytelling. HoFD's approach, in contrast, seems deliberately anti-modern; the movie celebrates precisely those generic conventions which, in retrospect, may be the LEAST sophisticated hallmarks of wuxia film. HoFD, in other words, leans heavily on the (sometimes) narrative and human clumsiness of wuxia film, and its visuals and action - sometimes the primary focus of wuxia - are abstracted beyond the fantastic and into the merely metaphorical.

It isn't all bad, of course. What remains from Zhang Yimou's previous films, many of them masterpieces, are his striking visual sense, his use of color, and his ability to coax fine performances from his actors. ""Hero"" succeeded, however, because it placed the fantastic within a sophisticated context of contingent narrativity, and this film falls far short: it further abstracts its fantasy while simultaneously discarding any meaningful structure or context. I'm eager to see more wuxia from Zhang Yimou, but I hope he returns to his roots - focusing not merely on beauty and generic stylization, but structuring those concerns within his intelligent and sometimes highly critical perspective on human society.",1140134400,,2315,5.4789915966386555
2231337,5,B0007Q6VXC,"One of the most considerable and extraordinary contributions of the cinema as art is the amazing and perfect conjunction between mythos and reality; to get the accurate proportion in which poetic verb and visual expression can be melted.

Yimou Zhang `s powerful visual expression reaches that notable peak in which visual fantasy is simply a minuscule portion of the narrative scheme. The visual effects are under the service of the fable and the power of myth.

Loyalty  and duty; betrayal and jealous, pride and honor are just irresistible words that mean nothing when love makes its appearance. The rules are meaningless and the bliss genesis is also its consummation.

The sacrifice ritual is part of the life; the selfish still dominates our primary impulses; courage, boldness and spiritual discipline are mere semantic formalities. We return to the primordial roots: The consecration of spring is going to burn at your eyes.

The choreographic duels; the ravishing employment of chromatic filters, the wild nature working out as splendid frame to reveal the varied gamut of feelings; the cinematic rhythm and passionate characters description make of this picture not only a must-see, but elevates and expands still more the astonishing possibilities of the cinema as inspired vehicle of the perpetual imagination and reminds us these famous words of Jean Luc Godard when affirmed: ""The cinema is the expression of our most beautiful feelings.""",1139184000,,1452,5.2956521739130435

2231340,4,B0007Q6VXC,"Just like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero, House of Flying Daggers delights the audience in beautiful styllish martial arts action blended in with vivid colors. The main story takes place all over a wide landscape. From the inside of buildings, to the open fields of grass chest high, to a dense forest filled with tall, round tree trunks, this is really a movie to see just for the colors alone.

The main story involves a secret group of fighters called the House of Flying Daggers. They are rising against the emperor at the time after corruption and greed is turing the country against itself. Mei, who is an exotic dancer and also happens to be blind is caught and is charged with the crime of supporting the House of Flying Daggers and is put in jail. Yet she escapes with the help of a fighter who calls himself Wind and together they run into the wild to find the House of Flying Daggers.

The marial arts stlye is simply superb as the two escapees flee from dozens of Imperial guards who have been sent to find and kill them for escaping. From fighting guards on horses in the woods, which also shows Wind's excellence at handling a bow and arrow, to fighting even more soldiers in a dense jungle with breathtaking aero-dynamics as they crawl up and down the trees like spiders, crossing swords all the while they run and fight.

There are many twists to the movie as well, this isn't just about fight scenes. However you'll have to see the movie for yourself to see what I mean, after all, where's the fun in just reading what I say? I will say that the ending is emotional, and the scenery with the snowstorm is really excellent....

2231344,4,B0007Q6VXC,"It's odd that after Crouching Tiger came out, there became a need for wuxia films, meaning chinese films with flying warriors and stunning scenery. While of course they are great films, you do get a feeling sometimes of ""isn't this just a redux of that movie?"" There were even times where it was like Flying Daggers was taking a cue from Zhang Yimou's last movie Hero. I liked Hero better but Flying Daggers has its moments.

It's 859 AD in China with the government's soldiers out in full force as usual. Standing in their way is the House of Flying Daggers, an underground rebellion that the government feels are rogues and dangerous(don't they always think that way?) The plot centers around Jin, our main hero Leo, a captain; and Mei, a beautiful dancer who's also blind.

I'm just describing the basics because later on things get complicated and quite needlessly too. It's like ""oh well you thought I was this? well guess again! Oop, fooled you too, I really was!"" And after awhile you realize that Melrose Place-style adventures weren't limited to America or even this millenium.

The film of course is quite stunning to look at. Many scenes have vibrant colors and many different ones all in one shot so you can have a blue-coated soldier running through a green forest and even red leaves in one scene. The action pieces are well-done too but to me, nothing beats that scene in the leaves in Hero.

Which brings me to my next point: it's a bit TOO similar to Crouching Tiger and Hero. One scene has Mei testing herself in a cool scene called the Echo Game where she has to hit the same drum with sleeves that someone threw a bean at, growing in complexity. Quite similar to another scene in Hero where he has to cut his way through a similar situation. Another scene has a girl bathing while the guy bangs a sword so she knows he won't just stare at her, which is straight out of Crouching Tiger.

2231346,4,B0007Q6VXC,"This movie is primarily a love story that is kept mildly entertaining with some high flying martial arts and the absolutely stunning Zhiang Ziyi. What I enjoyed most about this film, however, was the choreography and wonderful use of colors throughout the movie.

As mentioned before, the 'Echo Game' scene features Zhiang Ziyi performing a beautiful martial arts dance with a gown that has long flowing sleeves that are absolutely gorgeous to watch on screen as they move effortlessly around the circle hitting each specific drum. This was by far one of my favorite scenes in the entire movie. The use of colors is also wonderful to watch, especially the green theme used for the House of Flying Daggers' scenes.

As far as the plot goes, this movie offers nothing spectatuclar and is a melodramatic love story at best. But the acting is superb and the film offers enough plot twists to keep your interest until the end of the film.

Overall, this film is not about action so much as it is about the overall mood created with the visuals and love story. Zhiang Ziyi is spectacular in her role as Mei and I would highly reccomend this to any fan of films such as 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', etc. (CTHD has a much better story though.)",1135728000,,1240,4.678899082568807
2231347,5,B0007Q6VXC,"After raising his artistic level to lofty heights in ""Hero,"" Chinese director Zhang Yimou returns to earth with the elegiac ""House of Flying Daggers.""

In what could be considered the second film of his third different film-making period, Zhang now freely traffics in martial arts. Bringing to the genre his own cinematic sensibilities, he renders a film that equals Hong Kong artists in action sequences, while again displaying his mastery in overall technique.

Working with a script from Li Feng, Wang Bin and himself, Zhang again returns to his country's history for an action tale full of romance, deceit, betrayal and loyalty. Set in 859 China, near the end of the Tang dynasty, ""Daggers"" centers on an on-going conflict between the established, corrupt emperor (whom we never see) and what must be called a terrorist group, known by the film's title, sworn to overthrow the ineffectual leader.

But, strangely, even when dealing with such a variety of emotions, ""Daggers"" is often a cold, uninvolving movie. A romance is established between Mei (Zhang Ziyi), who may or may not be blind, and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro), who may or may not be a double agent for the government, with Leo (Andy Lau), who may or may not be a triple agent for the government, acting as a romantic foil.

In the prolonged opening scene set in a brothel, full of flowery patterns and shimmering costumes, Mei dances for Leo, suggesting that the deft Zhang Ziyi can execute any physical demands. Before leaving the scene, however, director Zhang shows his perfect eye for composition and choreography with his production of Mei's ""echo dance.""

Mei smoothly moves through her intricate paces, provocatively stimulating the senses. Carefully choreographed drummers surround her in perfect symmetry, setting up an unlikely stage from which Mei performs her stunning dance.

After this initial interior sequence, the film goes outside and stays there for several pursuits. Zhang then parades several imaginative battle sequences in which armies are outrageously mowed down by one or two people.

Consequently, much of ""Daggers"" follows a Hong Kong film tradition by taking place in the air, as fights erupt in bamboo forests, with warriors swaying in the trees, bending, and defying gravity. Zhang's pastoral fight scenes don't originate from the Hong Kong tradition of Tsui Hark or early John Woo films, but instead are his own inventions with much more emphasis on the aesthetic.

And it's for this eye that Zhang is best known, even in epic works like ""Hero"" or in a film like ""Daggers."" And that alone makes it more entertaining, and better, than 98 percent of most movies.",1135123200,,2654,5.071100917431193

2231349,4,B0007Q6VXC,"""House of Flying Daggers"" directed by acclaimed Yimou Zhang is a romanntic drama disguised as a martial arts film.  This visually appealing movie features terrific set designs and costuming to create 9th century China at the time of the Tang dynasty.  The martial arts action sequences were choreographed beautifully as one would expect.  The storyline however was merely an above average romantic plot.

The Tang dynasty was in a state of decline and a clandestine underground group, the House of the Flying Daggers, was attempting to take over control of the country.  The blind daughter of the recently assassinated leader of the group was purported to be working as a dancer in the lavishly decorated bordello, the Peony Pavilion.  Two captains of the reigning government Jin and Leo schemed to use the girl to lead them to the secret hideout of the Flying Daggers.

The girl Mei played by the ravishingly beautiful Ziyi Zhang is arrested on trumped up charges by Leo, played by Andy Lau and threatened with torture unless she reveals the secrets of the Flying Daggers.  As previously, arranged Jin played by Takeshi Kaneshiro, helps her escape using an impressive array of martial arts moves.  Jin and Mei, also an accomplished martial artist, are riding and running through the countryside being hunted by government soldiers.  Jin is attempting to gain Mei's confidence so that he can coax her into leading him to the Flying Daggers, with Leo in hot pursuit.

A funny thing happens as in their flight which includes frequent battles in that Jin and Mei fall in love.  Mei had previously been Leo's love interest so this creates a muddle in the various allegiances.  The film concludes in a fairly standard manner but not necessarily happily ever after.",1134604800,,1759,4.962457337883959
2231350,2,B0007Q6VXC,"Let me preface this review by pointing out that I lived in China for many years and have met both Zhang Yimou (director) and Zhang Ziyi (female lead Mei).  I also speak excellent Mandarin.  In fact, in a criticism that won't matter to the subtitle crowd, the film is miscast with way too many Hong Kong actors speaking Cantonese-influenced, syrupy putonghua instead of the crisp Beijing variety:  sort of like watching some historic movie of Scotland and hearing, ""Hey, y'all whut say we 'ums hightail it to them there Highlands so's we all kin ree-bel with Bonnie Prince Charlie!"".

Also, yes HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS is a love story, but it is a lame and glacially-paced one, and also mildly non-credible, as other reviewers have noted.

And the big plot twist was pretty obvious, I thought and the whole plot paper thin.  In essence, DAGGERS was little more than a vehicle to grandstand Zhang Ziyi and for Zhang Yimou to paint his usual pleasant palate of bright hues across the silver screen.

There are so many better modern films coming out of the PRC, many by this same director and starring the same lady.  Really, go see HERO, CROUCHING TIGER, SHANGHAI TRIAD, RAISE THE RED LANTERN, XIU XIU THE SENT DOWN GIRL, OR RED SORGHUM and give DAGGERS a pass.",1133913600,,1258,4.6863636363636365

I guess that helped me with this film!  I have absolutely no problem with suspending my disbelief as I don't have any real beliefs to begin with.  Nothing about the characters motivations seemed too unrealistic as I have no experience with chinese culture/history.  It was easy to assume this was the norm for this age in China. Upon reflection sure...some of the stunts you saw pulled weren't probable and perhaps downright impossible but reality is fairly droll and boring.  I go to the movies to see something outside of my experience and existence and this did it for me.

  I've read a few reviews who called this eye-candy and it is.  It's absolutely breathtaking.  And the martial arts is as good as it gets.  Think Crouching Tiger.  I actually found the story line to be better than HERO and Crouching and the twists were wonderful!  My biggest complaint about the genre is that the storylines tend to be weak....of course if the martial arts is good I tend not to care but this movie had both!  I didn't see a single one of the plot twists coming and I enjoy a movie you have to really sink your teeth into to figure out what going on!

His movies rely on plot-twists that contradict the motivations and emotions of the earlier parts of the story. It's a very tricky game he's playing and by the end of it I felt deceived and confused.

And they didn't really make sense on a fundamental level.. (spoiler alert) One does not fight for one's life while pretending to be blind. It's suicide.  The premise is IMPOSSIBLE, so the movie is fatally flawed.  The audience is supposed to overlook this and focus in on the love-story, but I wasn't buying it.

Also, CGI effects have become so commonplace that it had little effect on the audience.  Daggers and spears flew and there was Fighting everywhere, but I didn't feel the impacts.

I certainly didn't feel any of the secondary motivations, either patriotism or whatever the Robin-Hood traits the Flying Daggers represented.  It was just a good high-budget romantic pulp - with a battle..which lasts right through a big snow-storm..?..  I do respect these actors, so I'm dissapointed. Maybe Zhang Yimou has lost his touch.

I hope this is just a blip or a passing fad and that we can get back to some substantive drama and characterization, because the genre is in big trouble if this keeps up.

A couple of observations:

* The entire scene at the Peony Pavilion was absurd from a technical standpoint. It looked like the entire set was lit by a thousand spotlights and everyone should have been wearing sunglasses. Where oh where do you get that kind of lighting in the Tang Dynasty? It's completely wrong.

* The CG effects with the knives was also wrong. I can suspend disbelief but only to a point. It was just laughable.

* I thought the dialogue was really lowbrow. This is just a matinee flick and nothing more.

* Andy Lau is miscast. His character engenders no sympathy whatsoever from the audience.

The plot is interesting, with the 3 main characters conflicted between love and duty, in a triangle of complex emotions. All 3 are spies in a battle between the government and a rebel group that seeks justice, and it is brilliantly cast by 3 of the most attractive stars in films today. Takeshi Kaneshiro, remembered from his great work in Wong Kar-Wai's films, is magnificent as Jin, who poses as a playboy to get to know the beautiful Mei. Zhang Ziyi is Mei, skilled as a dancer, actress, as well as in the martial arts scenes, and completing the trio is superstar Andy Lau; all 3 light up the screen with their charisma and excellence as performers.

""House of Flying Daggers"" is a feast for the eyes, and a romantic fantasy that is very moving. One has to see this film several times to enjoy all the detail, and the subtlety of the performances. As much as I liked ""Hero"", this film has perhaps even more depth, as it would be a fantastic film independent of the action scenes.

The lovely score by Shigeru Umebayashi adds much to the film, with the final song, ""Lovers,"" sung by Kathleen Battle, and the cinematography by Xiaoding Zhao, much of it on location in the Ukraine, is breathtaking.

The acting is equally fine. The three main characters are compelling and natural. It's no surprise to see Jin falling for Mei, but the outcome of that attraction is a big surprise.

The plot is tightly woven and finely designed. The finale seems melodramatic, perhaps, but it's no more so than ""Romeo and Juliet"" or ""Hamlet"". This is a tragedy in the classic form, in which each member of the cast is brought low by the weakness he (or she) doesn't recognize inside.

If it seems pale compared to ""Crouching Tiger"", I think it's mainly because most of us saw that film first and were enchanted by it. If we had seen ""Flying Daggers"" first, we would have been equally enchanted by the combination of beauty, stylized violence and complex romantic tragedy.

2231362,4,B0007Q6VXC,"It's amazing how we think we have ""discovered"" Chinese cinema in the last few years since ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"".  In reality, there have been some great Hong Kong films as well as some really good epics from the mainland over the past 50 years.  There's more to Chinese films than Jackie Chan, chop-socky and amazing stunts.  The main reason why Chinese films have not been popular in the past is because they were made for their intended audiences, the citizens of the mainland or the populace of Hong Kong. Naturally, these were not going to be resounding successes in Hollywood or New York.  But now Chinese filmmakers are looking at their projects with a more global view.  They are making films with Chinese spirit and tradition but assimilating more with the Hollywood style of filmmaking.  As an American viewer, I sat and watched ""House of Flying Daggers"" in awe of the great scenery, acting and storytelling.  As a long time fan of Hong Kong cinema I was slightly disappointed that the film was shot a little more glossily than the typical Hong Kong fare.  It looked almost as much Hollywood as it did Hong Kong, thus the one star I deducted.  As for the story and the film itself, it is beautiful and engrossing.  Zhang Ziyi is spectacular to watch and you will enjoy the heroism of Takeshi Kaneshiro and the labors of Andy Lau.  Director Zhang Yimou is one of China's all time best.

The Chineese guys captured a great technic and style that can been seen in hero etc. But they overdone it. Every movie now is exact the same. Also the story is ridiculus.just for the guys who have seen this crap the scene where the undercover has a knife on his back and the woman(i don't remeber details beacuse i saw it when it came out in cinema and consider the fact that I didn't like it),said go like this so to be more believable.

The UMD disc boasts an amazing video transfer, with beautuflly rendered colours and stunning cinamatography in tact. My only gripe, like many other reviews, is the loss of the 2:35:1 OAR. Like all the recent Sony releases, it has been cropped to a 1:78 aspect ratio. But, don't let that stop you, as it still holds up extremely well, and after 5 min into it, it didn't bother me at all. The subtitles are crisp and large, displayed in yellow to seperate it from the BG nicely maiking i that much easier to read.

Video 4/5

Audio wise, it holds up well, esp in the action sequences. It's a little lacking on the Volume side of things, as I had to belt up the sound to UMD volume+2 for most the film, but still holds up well. I've only watched it in it's native Mandarin track (for purest reasons)but i hear the other tracks have the same problem with volume aswell.

Audio 3.5/5

The extras side of things, we just get a couiple of trailers, and that's it. But, who buys these discs for extras...really. it's the movie that's the real reason for the purchase.

A great disc in the collection, and worth the purchase.

2231367,5,B0007Q6VXC,"""House of Flying Daggers"" brings you a wonderful tale you can delight in, and the opportunity to watch a movie where the use of color is so impressive that it is almost surreal, poetry in motion. Notwithstanding that, I think that you probably won't like this film unless you are prepared to suspend your disbelief at least for 119 minutes, the duration of this movie. Personally, I did exactly that, and I don't regret it at all  :)

The story is set in 859 AD, when a corrupt dynasty held power in China. There is an organization called ""House of Flying Daggers"" that is trying to change things, but the government won't allow that. Two officers, Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and Leo (Andy Lau) are ordered to stop the rebels, and so they devise a plan to infiltrate the ""House of Flying Daggers"". They capture Mei (Zhang Ziyi), the blind daughter of the previous leader of the revolt, who had been posing as a courtesan. Jin rescues Mei from the jail, and tries to convince her that he would like to join the rebels, when in truth his objective is to destroy the ""House of Flying Daggers"". But even if everything started as a plan, will Jin be able to remember Leo's advice, ""Don't fall in love for real""?.

I want to point out that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The story was great, with enough twists to keep you entertained, and plenty of outstanding fighting scenes.  Chinese director Zhang Yimou made such a great use of the elements at his disposition (great actors + inspiration + music + choreography + use of colors) that many sequences seem directly out of a dream, and the spectator feels as if he were bearing witness to a real story that happened a long time ago. In a word, the results are impressive... Watch ""House of Flying Daggers"", and decide whether you share my opinion :)

2231368,3,B0007Q6VXC,"This movie features all the rich colour and stunning visuals of 'Hero' and has plenty of beautifully choreographed action sequences, but nonetheless it falls short of the illustrious standard of 'Hero'. Where 'Hero' was about sacrificing everything for one's duty to the greater good, 'House of Flying Daggers' is precisely the opposite - abandoning one's duties for a lover one only met days before.

And that is a problem with the plot for me. At least one other reviewer here has also pointed it out: How did Mei and Jin fall so deeply in love after knowing each other just days? Given, they were enduring fairly unorthodox and extreme circumstances and given they were in only each other's company, but still - the sheer level of devotion they show is extraordinary, considering the brief duration of their acquaintance.

This movie is perhaps a tad too long, also. In addition the ending is something of an anti-climax. The great battle between the imperial forces and the House of Flying Daggers that promises to occur throughout the movie is only hinted at towards the end and we never see what would undoubtedly have made a spectacular scene.

Like I said early - this movie is visually stunning and Shigeru Umebayashi's score strongly evokes imagery of ancient China... however that is all that is outstanding about this film. Otherwise it came as something of a disappointment to me, so soon after the amazing masterpiece that was 'Hero'.

For fans of romance (this film gives more than a subtle nod towards Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet"") this will probably be a must see. For those expecting something of the scope, power and deeper meaning of 'Hero' this will prove only mildly entertaining and likely quite a disappointment.",1125792000,,1740,4.948630136986301

I love everything about this movie- there's bouts of fantasy in the movie that are so well done, at the end it made me think I could pull off running over treetops or floating through the air!(Yeah, it didn't work) Even the most emotionally stunted person will be forced to admit to being smitten with the complicated love story, exquisite costumes and the amazing colors of the everything!

Those who are trashing this film do so senselessly.

As can be the case in Asian films, like the recent hit. ""Hero"", the costumes and the use of color are important characters all by themselves.

  This film had gorgeous colors, settings, costuming, not too much wirework, nice choreography of fight scenes.

It's very fantastical, stripped-down, symbolic & surreal-- very nice for concentrating on telling a story.

  The characters are archetypes of everybody who's trapped in lives and social processes, governments & groups that have grown to not care at all about the people in them or their original purpose.  The characters Jin, Mei & Leo don't quite realize that their life's circumstances have changed --and will they have the courage to change to a more honest life?

  Leo has sacrificed everything for years, all for the idea of love with a woman he hasn't really had an affair with, and for  political movements that don't care about him.  He's still planning on continuing though..

  Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro is Gorgeous--I mean, wow.)-Jin might've been a shallow playboy out playing games, but here Fate has it's way with him, calls on him to be a man and decide for himself the right thing to do.  It's an agonizing, fearful gut decision, goes against his old programming & Jin probably couldn't explain why he must do this.

  On the surface, they'd decided to trick (what might be) the enemy girl, Mei, into leading them to the enemy stronghold...but deep down, he increasingly can't deal with putting the blind girl on a path to a horrible death.

  The 3-days journey of the mind might've gotten so intense due to isolation from others, empathy, a chance to study each other's hidden character, gender-attraction, role-playing, wearing the enemy's costume and battlefield intensity & camraderie.  (Stanford Prison Experiment 1971: costumes, roleplaying & interesting mayhem in less than 6-days.)

  After all the trickery is exposed & everybody is shocked, bitter & drawn back into the pettiness of their old lives, there still has to be dealt with that strong, unexplainable sense of another person's character and a huge desire for better lives.",1124668800,,2159,5.179710144927537

2231380,4,B0007Q6VXC,"After the spectacular movie ""Hero"" I was excited to see a new movie by the same director, Zhang Yimou. I enjoyed Zhang's interesting visual stylization of color to convey mood so apparent in both ""Hero"" and ""Red Latern.""

""Flying Daggers"" is the story of a blind dancing girl, Mei. She may be the daughter of the dead leader of the House of Flying Daggers, a rebel group. She is joined by Jin, the deputy of the county, in hopes that she will lead him to the new leader of the Flying Daggers. Though their journey only lasts a few days, they can't resist the intense attraction to each other and eventually fall in love. The intrigue and counter plot points were interesting, if not completely original.

The cinematography in this movie left me feeling a little cheated. While each scene is exquisite in color and composition I felt that based on the work shown in ""Hero"" I could have expected a higher and more original quality to the work. The lack of color in many scenes made them seem bland, when it seemed that such a historical epic demanded more drama inherent in the scenery.

Editing problems are exceedingly apparent in the ending battle scene. It is jerky and obviously cut together from numerous different takes. This results in a lack of continuity throughout what is supposed to be a single fight scene. The other battles though felt very staged as often entire groups of soldier invariably synchronized their movements. It became somewhat comical by the fourth battle in the movie.

The story had many plot twists that were both original and unoriginal. Ultimately I felt like this movie was probably edited heavily in post production and that led to certain continuity errors. Also the story left me feeling like it could have been so much better. This is a good film that falls just sort of being truly great.",1121212800,,1828,4.703125

2231383,4,B0007Q6VXC,"This is the third of the new wave of great martial arts movies to hit the West, after 'Crouching Tiger' and 'Hero'. Perhaps I was expecting something even more enormous in scale than 'Hero', so I was a little disappointed. There are no grand sieges or scenes of battlefield warfare in 'Flying Daggers'.

But there are many of the elements we are becoming familiar with: medieval setting, balletic violence, gorgeous scenery, assassins, deception plays, people pretending to be on the opposing side, superb crossover Eastern-Western music, and somewhat coy sex scenes.

This film has rather more blood in it than 'Hero'. (Perhaps the most worrying aspect about this is how little distress it caused for me, the viewer.)

Perhaps the biggest downer for me came at the very end with the credits. Again measuring this film against 'Hero', I had been expecting a travelogue element -- i.e. taking us to the most extraordinary parts of China. While watching it last night, I commented to my son how much the Chinese landscape seemed like England. The credits reveal that much of the film was shot, not in China, but in the Ukraine. So the scenery may seem exotic to much of the film's Chinese audience, but to me it wasn't very different from rural Surrey.

The plot is interesting, with several nice twists to keepy you from getting complaciant. the photography is spectacular, to the point of breathtaking. perhaps reason to catch it on a big screen if possible. the fighting is integral to both the plot and the movie, seemingly at times dancing more than swordplay. i like the hongkong highwire and don't find it fake, although you might if the genre is new to you.

there is some thoughful philosophy at the end but in general it is not a particular thinking film but a pretty Chinese sword movie. the love interest is unlike the Chinese and adds a little spice but not the sexual tone that you would find in western movies so it is suitable for the kids if you don't mind the fighting scenes.

2231387,4,B0007Q6VXC,"Though from different directors, most Western viewers will probably compare this film to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as they are both examples of wuxia film (a mixture of chivalry, xia, and martial arts, wushu).  Moreover, both films feature the beautiful and engaging actress, Ziyi Zhang.  Much like Crouching Tiger, this film shows a variety of natural, panoramic landscapes, engulfing the viewer in lush details.  However, Yimou Zhang - Flying Daggers' director - is far more deliberate with his choice of landscape, making changes based on visual criteria rather than sequence.  Thus, there are some rapid shifts in scenes, say moving from yellow birch forests to green bamboo.  Shifts such as these are guided by an acute sense of color; the extremes of sumptuous colors indulge the viewer.  This is a very beautiful film.

In terms of action, there isn't the same level of fantasy in movement that was found Crouching Tiger.  While there are a few scenes where the laws of physics are ignored, if you found the excesses of Crouching Tiger were distracting, then you may find Flying Daggers more enjoyable.  On the other hand, there is a lot more blood and death in this film, making it a bit darker than Tiger.  The PG-13 rating seems appropriate in that it is probably a bit much for younger (under 8) viewers.

As for the film story, it is secondary to the visuals.  The dialog tends to be a bit terse and pedestrian, but perhaps that is more the fault of translation.  The basic plot is interesting, but nothing about is particularly challenging.  Several layers of intrigue play out as a rogue gang and the authorities seek each other's destruction.  Against these grander schemes, issues of friendship and love twist and turn among two police officers, Jin and Leo, and their mutual love interest, Mei.  It is the struggles among these three that drive the plot, though the film fails to invest the viewer in any character to make the emotional tensions critical.  Again, this is primarily a visual film.

Overall, I think that this is an excellent film with gorgeous photography and interesting action.  The actors/actresses are beautiful, the landscapes are stunning, and there is a wonderful fairy-tale feel to the film as a whole.  If you enjoyed other wuxia films such as Hero or Crouching Tiger, I'm sure that you will love this one.",1120435200,,2353,4.893939393939394

2231389,3,B0007Q6VXC,"House of Flying Daggers, the latest epic movie from China, tells the story the fight against a legendary group of revolutionaries, the titular House of Flying Daggers. Jin and Leo, a pair of police deputies, decide on their own to track the rebels by using Mei, the blind daughter of the House's former leader. They concoct a plan: Jin will help her escape prison, pretending to be a sympathizer of the House, and seduce her into taking him back to their stronghold. Meanwhile, Leo will follow with soldiers.

Zhang Ziyi turns in her usual stellar performance as Mei in all of her incarnations, as does Andy Lau as Leo. Still, the standout performance comes from Takeshi Kaneshiro, who believable and compelling as Jin, who struggles with his own loyalties and the betrayal of his general, and who falls hard for his prey, despite his best efforts otherwise.

Despite the wonderful performances by the cast, the movie is very typical of Zhang Yimou recent films: a stunning use of color, scene and costume, beautifully choreographed fights, and completely and totally predictable. Unlike Hero, Zhang Yimou's last, more spectacular offering, House of Flying Daggers has a simple story that Zhang Yimou attempts to liven with some equally simple twists. It falls flat. The cinematography is not so good nor are the characters as compelling as in Hero. In fact, when compared with Hero, House of Flying Daggers seems a washed out shadow rather than a movie in its own right. Compared to some of Zhang Yimou's earlier movies, especially Raise the Red Lantern, it is an amateur and unskilled action movie. And, while it has the heartwrenching ending that seems to be found in all of the recent exports from China, it fails to emotionally involve the watcher like other recent Chinese films that have crossed the Pacific.

While House of Flying Daggers is a beautiful movie and worth watching for the visual aspects alone, it fails to live up to its predecessors.

In House of Flying Daggers the actors are really good and very easy on the eyes. I loved watching Takeshi Kaneshiro and Andy Lau like I loved watching Glenn, Kline, Glover and Costner wearing dusters in Silverado. Ziyi Zhang is a lovely dancer and actress. There is tons of imagination invested in both.  However, Hero wins on how the story rides up and whisks you through a Rashoman-style of storytelling to a complexity of meanings behind how we define leaders, heroism, tyrants, sacrifice, love... House of Flying Daggers was like a beautiful but contrived soap opera where women prove their worth by dying.  HOWEVER, the visuals of color, martial action and acting got me through this long movie.  Zhang is a poet, and the actors are pros.  I won't write this movie off.  It is more like a study for a future masterpiece.  A friend who is a Big Brother too his little Brother to go see this because they thought it was a martial arts movie.  Before they went, I had cautioned that Hero might be the better choice.  Did he listen?  No. Little Bro and Big Bro came out of the theater wondering where they were going to get those 2 1/2 hours of their lives back.  It took them a week to loosen their upper lips from being curled up in their eyebrows. I liked House of Flying Daggers better than they did.  You be the judge.",1119830400,,1436,4.51937984496124

The story could have been written by a group of teenaged boys all suffering from ADD who have an unhealthy obsession with Japanese manga and a rudimentary grasp of human relationships.

The film is full of simplistic plot developments that serve only to move the action from one pretty place to another.  Television ads for SUVs show more concern for telling a story than this film.

And there are amazing lapses of continuity: Jin's bow appears when bad guys show up and disappears after the action is over.  Leo and Jin battle as the general's troops descend from the hills.  But, the troops never arrive.  This is sloppy film making and sloppy editing.

The film begins lush and colourful as we are quickly treated to a sight of Zhang Ziyi dancing in a brothel in a gorgeous dress. At this point, too, the plot seems rather straight-forward. However as the film progresses the plot rapidly complexifies needlessly, in a way that causes one to stop and pause and re-evaluate the past behaviours of the characters and see if what they did before makes sense, considering they're true natures. And often enough, it doesn't really make sense. Why would Mei, who is a prostitute, not some virginal princess as she played in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, be so shy around men? Why would the guy who loved Mei get so possessive about her this particular time, when she has been in the peony pavilion, and also the madam states that this is NOT the first time Mei has used her beauty to further their cause? At some level, I don't really care about the answers to these questions: I sit back and enjoy watching these superheroic long and limber beautiful people fly through the bamboo forest and wield sharp swords. But on another level, the convoluted plot and the fact that I just don't BELIEVE what is going on, seriously prevents me from enjoying the aesthetics of the film. *I accidentally gave this film 5 stars.

2231395,5,B0007Q6VXC,"Set in the ninth century in China, this film brings to life a fascinating culture through its impeccable presentation of settings, customs and a storyline that will be hard to forget. At the time in question, the Tang dynasty is in decline due to an incompetent emperor and a corrupt government. This has led to several alliances being formed, with one of them leading the pack. The House of Flying Daggers is a group that acts as a kind of Robin Hood, stealing for the corrupt and powerful to give to the poor; as a result, people love them. Of course, the ""police"" are being pressed hard to bring their leader to justice, dead or alive, event which is likely to damage the House beyond repair.

After quickly presenting the basic premise, the movie jumps right into the action, and we see a young police officer trying to infiltrate the House of Flying Daggers by establishing a bond of trust with a showgirl that is suspected to be part of the group. This young woman, Mei, is blind but shows unbelievable powers for perceiving what happens around her. Jin is the man in charge of seducing her and earning her trust in order to uncover the organization, but right from the start we get a clear sense that his poise and determination are going to be seriously tested. The question then becomes: Will Jin be able to follow his mission without detours or is he going to fall in love with Mei and desist from his goal?

The way in which Jin gained Mei's trust was by helping her escape from the police, so their journey is filled with dangers as they are being chased by skilled and deadly men. Therefore, we get to see numerous exciting fight scenes, much in the style of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", but with improved special effects, where the movement of the characters is a lot smoother. In between the action scenes we have time for romance and pretty good acting from both Kaneshiro and Zhang. I especially liked the way in which Yimou Zhang (director) paced the film in these romantic scenes, allowing us a glimpse into the characters' souls. When you throw on top of this the beautiful settings, and the turns and twists of the plot that will give you guessing all the way to the end, the rating for this movie cannot be other than excellent. Even if you don't like the story or other aspects of this movie, the scene showing the echo game makes this movie worth watching. My recommendation is that if you are only going to watch one action film this year, this should be it!",1118707200,,2488,4.526666666666666

The fight scenes are done very very well (the best one being when Takeshi Kaneshiro shoots his arrows at the four guys surrounding Zhang Ziyi). To make things better there IS the beauty of Zhang Ziyi and Takeshi Kaneshiro. However, the thing I have against this movie is that the ending is so entirely cheesy in a bad way. It gets a little overly dramatic and you kind of sit there like HAH. There is less fighting and more ""romance"" but in a cheesy way. I would definitely recommend Hero over this and comparing it to another asian hit, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, this movie is worse in comparison.

2231397,4,B0007Q6VXC,"If you liked ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""Hero"" you will likely like ""House of Flying Daggers.""  If you haven't seen any of these movies then you've missed out on some of the best films outside of Hollywood!

I saw ""Crouching Tiger"" years ago and thought it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen.  It was epic, romantic, and dramatic.  What was especially gratifying was the inclusion of so many strong female characters.  Funny how a Chinese film can present such strong women when Americans think of themselves as so advanced and yet create so many movies that degrade women.

""Hero"" and ""House"" carry on with some of the same traits.  ""Hero"" is more epic and visual than all three, but ""House"" is clearly the most centered on romance.  It is, in fact, the center of the entire story.  However, I can't say that ""House"" is actually a romantic movie.  If anything it's a bit melodramatic. Of course, all three movies have this trait.  It's just that this movie seems to play it a bit heavier with two of its central characters only knowing each other for three days.

""Crouching Tiger"" was just more believable with its two couples - one impulsive and young, the other older, wiser and sadly unconsumated.  It's a little slower in developing its relationships, has moments of humor, and is far more sensuous when the couples interact.

After all this one might think I hated ""House of Flying Daggers"" in comparison to ""Crouching Tiger.""  ""House"" is a superb movie.  Like the other two, it's epic and redefines not just what we expect from the cinema, but also how female characters can be depicted in an action movie.  It's ten times better than the average movie that comes out of Hollywood!  Still, it's just not as good as ""Crouching Tiger.""  That shouldn't stop anyone from seeing or owning it - ""House"" is a movie that must be seen.  But then, I'd say the same about ""Tiger"" and ""Hero.""",1118361600,,1903,4.640718562874252
2231398,5,B0007Q6VXC,"I can't say enough about how perfect this movie was made.  It was like the director perfected every still with camera angles, ""Matrix"" effects, and rich colors.  I had previously seen Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Hero and those movies seem like experiments that have led up to this perfection of a movie.

Two police officers are told that they have only a short time (I think it was 10 days) to catch or kill the leader of the Flying Daggers an apparent gang that is the enemy of ""The General"" (I assume he is like the military dictator of the province).

The boss policeman tells the other (Jin) one to pay a visit to a brothel and see if he can find any leads.  Jin goes and is told by the madam that they have a new blind girl who has special talents, especially as a dancer.  Jin is intrigued and asks to see this girl.  It was told that the prior leader of the Flying Daggers had a blind daughter that disappeared.  After the girl's performance in dancing, martial arts and swordmanship, Jin and his boss think the girl may be the same blind girl that was the daughter of the Flying Dagger's leader.  They arrest her and then threaten her with torture if she doesn't talk.

She is then rescued from her captivity by a masked Jin who helps her escape into the countryside.  It turns out that Jin and his boss had the whole thing plotted, whereby Jin would win her confidence and she will lead him to the Flying Daggers.

The more time Jin spends with her, a romance slowly starts to develop, having Jin question what he needs to do and likewise for the girl.  The romance is beautiful, and I put it up there with anything I have seen on film.  Likewise the fight scenes are far better than either of the two previously mentioned films (there was no need for flying in this film which I hated about the other films).  The kicks and punches look like they really land, unlike other films where you can see that they have really missed by six inches.

As the moods of the film change so do the colors and it seems like the seasons too.  The movie has a few unresolved points at the end, so I hope it means a sequel will be made.",1118275200,,2135,4.28428927680798

In my book the film lost points on everything else. The plot line was weak and fuzzy at times, choosing not to really pursue anything about the conflict between the House of Flying Daggers and the goverment, only that there was a conflict, and it was indeed between the government and the House of Flying Daggers. The actors and actresses are beautiful, but the style of acting more reflects on a soap opera then anything else. Lines tend to be 4 word, a long pause, then 2 or 3 words. The long paused is used to make what is very simple, sound very meaningful, and much of the dialogue falls short of being anythning worth noting.

The soundtrack was also very well written, and I will certainly search out a copy. Overall the film would have gotten 5 stars had a little bit more time been put into the script, and a little bit more depth put into the plot.

2231401,4,B0007Q6VXC,"The Movie

Set in the declining years of the Tang Dynasty, House of Flying Daggers is the story of two captains of the now-corrupt Chinese government who use a beautiful captured assassin to infiltrate an underground resistance movement.  Captain Leo sends captain Jin undercover to rescue Mei, a young blind warrior captured by Leo himself in the hopes that Jin will earn Mei's trust and lead him to the heart of the House of Flying Daggers, the source of the government's greatest uprising.

What follows is a story of star-crossed romance and deceptions within deceptions where nothing is as it seems and where trust and love battle loyalty and honor like warriors in a bamboo forest.

To reveal too much more about the story will spoil all of the biggest plotlines of the movie, but I will say that the viewer will either feel extremely manipulated, or sympathetically understanding of why things transpire the way they do.

Visually, the movie matches the artistic and technical brilliance of Yimou's other recent martial arts' epics.  The cinematography is spectacular with simply stunning views of wintery fields, lush green forests, and even ornate interiors like the ostentatious brothel, the Peony Palace.

This is simply a wonderfully directed, edited, and performed period martial arts piece, with an arguably contrived and convoluted screenplay.  I enjoyed the performances of the principal characters: the ever graceful, yet powerful Zhang Zi Yi, the always capable Andy Lau, the award-winning and luminous Song Dandan, and Japanese actor Takeshi Kaneshiro do a wonderful job of conveying the emotion and crisp physicality of exceptional warriors drawn in to a violent world where love, loyalty, and trust are hard-won spoils of war.

The Video

Well done.  It's admittedly hard for me to judge technical quality on the PSP's awesome, but still relatively small widescreen, but I found no noticeable problems.  The disc reproduced the many the colorful sets and backdrops as well as the jaw-dropping fighting sequences very well.

The Sound

Good.  It's a dialog heavy track, but there are also lots of sound effects for the fighting sequences and such that came off pretty well.

Special Features

Only two trailers you've probably already seen.

Summary

I enjoyed the film, in spite of the twists and turns, and felt it was right on par with ""Hero"" and ""Crouching Tiger"" as far as big-budget, technically brilliant Chinese martial arts films go.  I would recommend it, overall.",1117584000,,2494,5.141439205955335
2231402,5,B0007Q6VXC,"THIS MOVIE HAS FLAWS, BUT THE ACTION SCENES AND CINEMATOGRAPHY MAKE UP FOR IT.

Who thinks this stuff up?  The action scenes and the colors are just amazing.  They are the reason you go to the movies.  To be entertained and to be transported into another world.

This movie does have it flaws in plotting, time scale and realism.  But, most Chinese movies do.  On the plus side, most Chinese movies do not have lapses in logic.  Some of the obvious flaws include:

The opening dance scene is just as contrived as the pod racing scene in Star Wars: Phantom Menace.  Is there any reason for this dance, other than it is visually stunning?  It makes no sense to the plot.

The emotional bond of the two main characters is too rushed.  The heroine really has no reason to make a connection, especially knowing what the relationship is based upon.

The plot is fairly obvious throughout, although there is one surprise near the end.

I was going to give this 4 stars, until the ending sequence.  The final climax, in a snowstorm, just caps off some amazing and beautifully photographed scenes.

The colors in this movie are amazing.  Much of it is filmed during the autumn, with very vibrant fall colors.  The costumes and buildings are equally intricate and bursting with colors.

The real amazing parts are the action scenes.  I think they are better than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or the Star Wars Movies.  Overall, this isn't a better movie, it is just the action scenes are so unique and spectacular, that there isn't much that equates to them.

One of the great parts of the action scenes, compared to other Chinese movies and some American movies, is that there is a certain amount of realism to them.  There isn't the unreal flying.  Instead, there is the jumping from stalk to stalk across the bamboo jungle, which you can believe could actually happen. It is like a Jackie Chan movie, taken to the next step.

There are some good extras on the CD's.  There are some bad extras, unless you are Chinese.  The ""Making of"" documentary is in Chinese.  The director's commentary is also in Chinese.  It is rather disturbing to hear his grunts and moans.  But, the star, Ziyi Zhang also gives commentary.  Even though you can't understand what she is saying, her giggles and breathing are just as beautiful and erotic as she is.

There is a nice extra that shows piecing toghether the special effects.  My only complaint is that it is not long enough.

One interesting note is the sexism that still exists in China to some extent.  The real star of the movie is the female star, Ziyi Zhang.  She main character and in more scenes.  But, she gets third billing to the two male leads.",1117497600,,2686,4.612288135593221
2231403,5,B0007Q6VXC,"""House of Flying Daggers"" is an excellent film.  It is not only stunning to look at, but it also has an incredible story line.  The time line is set at the end of a failing dynasty and the bad guys are starting to take over the country side.  The emperor has sent police to restore order against the Flying Daggers gang.  what transposes is a love story between three people.  One of the police and two of the gangsters.  Telling any more is going to give away the twists within the plot of the movie and that is not fair to you.  There are gangsters, cops, incredible fight scenes, and beautifull colors.

Like his last film ""Hero"", ""House of Flying Daggers"" is a feast for the eyes.  Once again Yimou has done marvoulous things with his choice of colors.  They are truly stunning and they enhance the film beautifully.  If you have seen ""Hero"" then you know what I am talking about.  This film also reminds me of ""Crouching  Tiger HIdden Dragon"" for the scenery.

This film also has incredible fight scenes throughout.  Even if you are not a fan of Martial arts films, this is just gorgeous to look at.  To me, the most amazing scene was the dance of the echoes which involved beans hitting various drums and a blind girl matching the rythem of the beans just by listening.  It is awe inspiring. Yimou does not fall into the cliche of most action films of one fight after another.  Don't worry, there is more than enough action for even the most die hard fan.  It just blends so well into the story.

If you liked Hero or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, then you will love House of Flying Daggers.  If you are not a martial arts film fan, then the film is still stunning to look at and the story line is everybit as good as the scenery.  This film is a true winner.

2231404,5,B0007Q6VXC,"Yimou Zhang loves to indulge color and hues in his films but in ""Daggers"" his indulgence at first hampers him.  The gears of the plot start off sluggish as Yimou seems more interested in indulging color than character, though one can hardly complain at Zhao Xioding's jaw-dropping cinematography.  But if you are patient, ""House of Flying Dagger"" pays off sweet and satisfying dividends.

Though the title insinuates a series dazzling fight sequences, ""House of Flying Daggers,"" Zhang's enthralling follow-up to ""Hero,"" is in fact a love story.  A triangle between two brothers-in-arms who do not the truth behind one another and a woman equal parts cold cunning and passionate heart.  Their faux-tragic tale is the emotional core of the film, giving it narrative drive and earthy dramatics.  The film opens as two army captains (asian superstars Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro) learn that the blind daughter of a slain insurgent leader (Ziyi Zhang) is hiding out at a local brothel.  Quickly concocting a plan, the two decide to let the woman lead them the new lead of the Flying Daggers and give them a chance to kill him.  But nothing is certain between these three warriors, and Yimou Zhang and his screenwriting team send the surprises coming in the film's final third and to give away anymore would be to spoil the emotional gravitas.

And the actors do Yimou proud.  Andy Lau packs his role with a muscular soulfulness, wheather he is wielding a mean sword or gazing longingly into the camera.  Takeshi Kaneshiro peels back the layers of his playboy captain, revealing a heart yearning for meaning and love. But the real star of the film is Ziyi Zhang, a radiant force of nature that ignites the screen with charisma and soulful feeling.  And all three prove their mettle in the film's eye-popping martial arts action.

Yimou, already known for staging breath-taking action sequences, pulls out some truly show-stopping numbers throughout ""Daggers."" Be it a martial arts marvel in an open field, a skirmish in the woods or an elevated battle in a bamboo forest, Yimou consistenly finds a balance between beauty and kinetic punch in one intensely choreographed battle after another.  In modern film, it's hard to find a film that deftly balances action, drama and visual theatrics with a earnest heart.  But Zhang Yimou and his gifted cast and crew do it, and do it spectacularly.

2231406,4,B0007Q6VXC,"Zhang Yimou's HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS continues where the director's HERO left off: it is a film of immense visual beauty and amazing choreography, supporting a plot with melodramatic elements to it. But whereas HERO could conceivably, amidst the dazzling imagistic pageantry and big emotions, be interpreted as a political statement (the film ends with a ruler having to sacrifice a hero for what he considers the greater cause of unifying feudal China), HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS is content to be romantic melodrama, plain and simple.

Personally, I kinda prefer the extra intellectual and thematic stimulation offered by HERO. At the end of that film, you really had something to think about; at the end of HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS...well, the story is over (and a song sung in English by soprano Kathleen Battle plays over the closing credits). Nothing of great consequence, I felt, had really happened in this film; it is basically one ravishing image and one amazing fight sequence following another, interspersed with (admittedly well-acted) moments of intimacy or high drama. If Zhang Yimou was aiming for thematic subtlety in HERO, here he goes for operatic emotions and visual spectacle. And for all its technical brilliance, the whole thing ultimately left me a little cold---maybe a bit too melodramatic and soapy for my taste.

That is a very personal reaction, of course. The technical brilliance Zhang Yimou brings to HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS is not to be denied; these are some of the most breathtaking (and breathtakingly filmed) fight sequences seen since the last notable ""wuxia"" film, Ang Lee's CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. And the actors bring as much conviction as possible to their basically two-dimensional characters: certainly, as House of Flying Daggers member Mei, Ziyi Zhang brings convincing passion to her role, as do Takeshi Kaneshiro and Andy Lau as, respectively Jin and Leo, two police deputies who rescue Mei from prison and try to trick her into bringing them to the House of Flying Daggers to stop their rebelliousness once and for all.

Perhaps the best way to appreciate HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS is to look at it as a cinematic opera. Zhang Yimou is clearly not afraid to work on a big canvas, and he brings all the big emotions and spectacular sights he can to tell his melodramatic story. Those who go into this film expecting to be dazzled will most likely be satisfied; it is a genuine technical marvel. For me, though, I was expecting more substance to the film than it delivered. HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS may be more purely enjoyable than HERO, but the latter, to me, is a much more interesting movie than this one.",1117152000,,2658,4.955156950672646

This was another great film from Chinese director Yimou Zhang. Although not even close to comparing to his last film, Hero, it still was a great movie. Zhang is an artist, it is as simple as that. His locations are perfect, the colors are vibrant, and the characters are passionate. This is much more a love story than anything. It offers some good surprises concerning the characters and keeps the mystery of the ""House of Flying Daggers"" a secret to even the viewers.

I think the plot's problem is there are no good supporting players to make the stars shine. It's just the 3 of them.

If you really want to see a good swordplay movie, check out the classics like Bride with White Hair, or the Swordsman trilogy.

In ""Hero"", the theme was about honor and what it takes to be a hero.  The theme of ""House of Flying Daggers"" is love and romance.

The story is set up in the first half of the film.  A lovely young woman is thought to be part of the rebel ""Flying Daggers"" group, and the government leaders want to discover her secrets.  There's a good story, coupled with some of the most exciting martial arts choreography on the screen today.  In this director's hands, it all seems a dance, and a complex one at that.  I couldn't take my eyes off those scenes, although some of the buildup seemed to drag a bit.

However, once the film reached the halfway point, the action intensified, and the complexities of the characters' inter-relationships clarified.  At that point the film just flowed and I was sorry to see it end.  And of course, I was completely fascinated by the extras on the DVD which show how some of the scenes were made.

I did enjoy the film but I kept comparing it with Hero, where the theme seemed to be larger and more universal.  But comparing the two doesn't seem fair.

The camera lens and film used to make this movie must be pretty high-end. The clarity & contrast are of a different class. The colors reminded me of FujiFilm Velvia: captivating.

The director really wanted a fairly high level of artistic achievement and much effort is clearly put into it. The use of shallow depth of field and panning horse-ride scenes are superbly captured.

The Chinese accents are more consistent (& accurate) and that provided less distraction for Chinese viewers. Dialogs are typical of sword-fighting Chinese movies, though.

The sound effects are ear-popping but effective. Visual effects for arrows are stolen from Robin Hood but improved. Sword fighting scenes are not as exaggerated as Crouching Tiger & Hidden Dragon and is kept at a more realistic level; thus, providing more intensity.

Sexual content is a little too overboard and I do not see how they contribute effectively to the movie. I also do not see that they are needed for the movie to be successful.

2231413,3,B0007Q6VXC,"The only explanation I can think of for The House of Flying Daggers is that the scriptwriter died halfway through the story, and the second half was written by someone with a completely different vision.

The movie begins as a tale of intrigue and romantic comedy, with much on the line for the the Tang government and the rebelling Flying Daggers.  After the series of twists, it becomes a melodramatic story about a love triangle - the coming battle all but forgotten.

Neither characters nor director appear to care about the causes they put so much effort into earlier in the movie.  The three warriors ignore their duty and their honor in favor of their own self interest.  It's bad enough when American movies give the same message - imagine what the Chinese would think.

It is a gorgeous movie.  Also less obvious wire fu, which makes the fantastic martial arts look more believable.  But the plot and character developement were a huge disappointment.  It could have been so much better, if they had stuck with the intrigue, instead of the melodrama.",1116288000,,1059,4.774725274725275

It isn't supposed to be total reality, you have to suspend your notions of reality in order to appreciate some movies. By stating that this movie is unrealistic and equating that with being a bad movie, you're just showing your ignorance about Chinese folklore and history. Maybe if you actually picked up a book (you know- the things with little letters printed on them) and gained some understanding into Chinese culture, you would be able to understand that this movie is a beautiful representation of the ideological/political/emotional era of China during a specific point in Chinese history.

2231416,5,B0007Q6VXC,"I rented the dvd from BlockBuster and now I'm buying it.

The film is absolutely gorgeous. I've seen only few films that contain as many beautiful scenes, or as beautiful for that matter. My favorite: The echo game at the beginning, the fight in the bamboo forest, the echo game at the end, and of course the snow scene.

The actings are brilliant. I watched Zhang ZiYi playing a blind girl who knew martial arts and thought she deserved an Oscar for it. Also, the two male characters are good. At least there's no eye rolling moment for me in this film. Plus, these are incredibly beautiful people. So even if the film were bad, you'd still want to look at them. Luckily it's not a bad film.

Action scenes are an absolute balance between violence and arts, if there are such things as beautiful killings!

On top of that, costumes are mindblowing. Music is great, especially the theme song at the end.

Weak points - hollow plot, pace slowing down towards the end, not enough character development, a few not very interesting love scenes, too little emphasis on traditional Wuxia themes such as honor, friendship, and so on.

To compare it with Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon, this film is more beautiful and a bit better in terms of details.. not as good when it comes to plots and storyline though.

And in response to some of the reviews above, my suggestion is you don't get this movie if you have a problem watching a Wuxia [Chinese Kung Fu] film that puts as much emphasis on romance as fighting. And if you don't like watching people flying, stay clear from the film. This is a fantasy story [kinda at par with Spiderman, Batman, and such.] if you know what I mean.

So even if I do think the film has some weaknesses, I'm giving it five stars.",1116028800,,1756,4.5
2231417,4,B0007Q6VXC,"First of all, neither Crouching Dragon, Hero, or this movie is  from Hongkong. Lee is from Taiwan, Chang is from mainland.

Second, both of them are emphatically not followers (go check their earlier works) of the traditional Hongkong wuxia genre, or at least not the wuxia movies of the last twenty some years. If you trace back a little bit further, you might find some interesting stuff. Still, not saying that they did or must follow the tradition.

Third, it's FICTION, or, let us put it in another way, would you take Moses or the Scarlet Letter as authentic HISTORY? How many good films posit their time in a historical moment and do not have any element of fiction or intention of composing a fiction? Go figure. I'm not saying that fiction has no authenticity in it, but I'm truly doubtful as to how one might see the authenticity of the universal in that way.

Fourth, do i like it? Well, the logic is not the best, many parts are leaky, and I subjectively think that, though it is indeed a love story as the director himself admitted, it might not be the most persuasive love story (but if you're okay with hollywood three-day fast love, that's another story. well, if you can take Speed, I don't see why you can't take this), and one main character was not exactly fully developed. The lack of preparation made the ending and the twist, not less convincing, but less powerful, that is, for me. However, I still like the movie.

So using the location and that traditional (and not exactly the whole of that tradition) perspectives to criticize it are rather invalid. Who told you to watch it that way? Well, how you want to analyze it is really your subjective choice. But for those who really like history, go read history books and make yourself believe that it isn't the representationo of the present and, at the same time, study the HISTORY of Chinese Wuxia genre as LITEREARY works. For those who dig the past and don't really know  how modern Wuxia came to being, go watch what had been made in the past. For those who have an issue with flying Chinese, don't watch Superman. For those who have a problem with plot, narrative and so on and so forth, go study Logic.",1115942400,,2183,4.541984732824427
2231418,4,B0007Q6VXC,"If, like many American viewers, you're interested in ""House of Flying Daggers"" because you were blown away by ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" you should be aware that while the latter film blends art film and action film almost perfectly, ""House of Flying Daggers"" makes a definite choice as to what sort of film it is. If you're interested in a jaw-droppingly gorgeous art film with some amazing action tossed in, great. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a beautifully filmed action film that could run in art houses, as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" did, look elsewhere. Even the somewhat troubled ""Hero"" would be a better bet for that crowd.

Make no mistake, ""House of Flying Daggers"" is a film of staggering beauty, and the action scenes that are in the film are quite nice (although even the credulity of someone coming for a wuxia film will get strained eventually at the superhuman feats done with the titular daggers), but for the most part, the film is incredibly slow and has a plot that's threadbare at best. It's a framework to justify a lot of the beautiful pictures, and nothing more.

Zhang Ziyi is still beautiful and great at what she does, and there are some very neat set pieces in the film, including the echo game when the blind entertainer hits drums scattered around the room with long weighted sleeves in response to beans being tossed at them in every more complex fashion. Likewise, the treetop scene in this film outshines a comparable scene in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" on a number of levels.

This film isn't the same sort of triumphant merger of art and action as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" but is strongly recommended for those whose interests in the previous film run more towards the artistry of the director and cinematographer and less towards the artistry of the choreographer and performers.",1115856000,,1856,4.867088607594937
2231419,5,B0007Q6VXC,"""House of Flying Daggers"" is visually stunning, making most western films look quite dull & dreary.  Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" was a modern tragedy, also cinematically breathtaking.  Zhang Ziyi who graced ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" & ""Hero"" does an exquisite job as Mei, taking the character through numerous levels as blind brothel dancer, hardened assassin, and ultimately a girl looking for love.  Both beautiful and talented, she is riveting on screen.  Takeshi Kaneshiro as the hunk Jin follows her through the woods and numerous battle sequences only to finally fall in love.  Andy Lau as Leo, the policeman who assists Jin in his undercover work, also is excellent, particularly as we see how this crime drama evolves into a classic love triangle.  The story telling is uniquely Chinese, a bit depressing for Western minds (...)  But all actors, the director and breathtaking cinematography make this a stunning visual treat that transcends cultural boundaries.  Bravo!",1115596800,,977,5.339869281045751
2231420,4,B0007Q6VXC,"Fresh from the success of Hero, Zhang Yimou and his current muse, Ziyi Zhang, reunited for another breathtaking martial arts epic, complete with some of the most impressive action sequences since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Like these movies, House of Flying Daggers features a tragic love story at its heart.

As he demonstrated in Hero, Yimou has fantastic eye for period detail and this film is no different with its colourful costumes and intricately detailed sets. The director eschews the heightened, primary colour scheme of Hero for a more naturalistic look with House of Flying Daggers. There is a predominantly earth tone look with warm colours like yellows, reds and browns. It is a nice contrast to the stylized action, which is impressively choreographed.

As he proved with Hero, Yimou's House of Flying Daggers is so much more than a martial arts movie. It is also features characters that we grow to care about which only makes the film's conclusion that much more tragic. This movie is just the right balance of style and substance, something that is very hard to pull of successfully with this kind of movie but so far Yimou is two for two. Hopefully, Zhang will continue to be his cinematic muse and they collaborate on future projects.

There is a subtitled audio commentary by Ziyi Zhang and Zhang Yimou. Yimou tends to dominate, talking about the look of the movie and the choreography of the action. Zhang does talk about all of the practicing she did for the dancing and action sequences. Fortunately, she already had six years of dance training which helped prepare for her intensive role.

""The Making of House of Flying Daggers"" is a 45-minute look at how this film came together. This well-made featurette examines various aspects, such as story, themes and interviews with the actors who speak highly of Yimou.

""Creating the Visual Effects"" is a brief featurette that shows various scenes as they looked originally and then with the CGI added.

Also included are ""Storyboard Comparisons"" for six scenes and allow one to watch the storyboards alongside the finished product.

""Costumes Gallery"" offers a brief look at drawings of the outfits worn by various characters with the final product.

There is also a ""Behind the Scenes Photo Gallery"" with many on-the-set and on-location photos.

Finally, there is a music video for the film's theme song, ""Lovers,"" that features footage of Kathleen Battle singing with clips from the movie.",1115164800,,2467,5.012224938875305

One soldier (Takeshi Kaneshiro) goes undercover and fakes a rescue. He hopes she will lead him to her gang. He falls for her of course and starts to really put his life on the line for her instead of just faking it.

  I wish that was just the whole plot though. Yes this movie looks great and the action scenes are very well done. The romance between Ziyi and Kaneshiro is beautifully done. I don't like how they add a second love interest (Andy Lau) for her in the second act though. He's jealous that she doesn't want him after he put his life into her for 3 years and blah blah blah. I didn't care about their romance or even think the movie needed him. The movie throws in too many plot twists when it didn't need them. It was a great movie the way it started without all that. It becomes too much about betrayal and jealousy. I don't think the love triangle was needed. It almost ruins an otherwise beautiful story.

It littered critic's top ten lists across the country and was hailed as an improvement over ""Hero"" (another movie I didn't care for).  There are of course many good things about this film. You cannot deny that it is a very very impressive film to look at. I loved the bright colors and elaborate sets. I also thought that on a few occasions Zhang Yimou's ambitious shots worked. The one in which we follow the arrows through the woods and watch them strike down four combatants simultaneously is my personal favorite. Unfortunately, I do not go to the movie to see sets and it would have to be the most incredible sets ever for me to recommend a film on that merit alone.  I like stories and characters, ideas and themes, and in these departments I found this movie to be seriously lacking.  This film involves tons of fighting in which you think to yourself nobodies really getting hurt because it looks too graceful. And that's fine, only I had no emotional connection to the characters. I was too caught up in how those four characters struck down by arrows were all lucky enough to be unharmed in the attack. Was it an attempt to make a joke about being so close and yet so far away, or (more likely) was in a simple plot devise to allow these men to be killed off again later in the story? In the end I liked ""Hero"" better than this movie, but disliked them both. ""Hero"" had a much better story, it just was swallowed up by its own sap in the last 15 minutes of the film.

2231424,5,B0007Q6VXC,"Director Yimou Zhang who wooed audiences with his cinematically breathtaking 2002 film ""Hero"" did another stupendous job with his 2004 film ""The House of Flying Daggers"" (a.k.a., ""Shi mian mai fu"").  Audiences familiar with the films ""Hero"" (2002) and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000) will no doubt recognize one of this film's main characters being portrayed by the actress Ziyi Zhang.  In this film, Ziyi Zhang plays Mei, the seemingly blind daughter of a man who founded the illegal group known as the House of Flying Daggers.  Two Chinese soldiers who are attempting to stop the House of Flying Daggers, Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and Leo (Andy Lau), learn about Mei is performing as a dancer at a nearby nightclub of sorts that is being run by a woman named Yee (Dandan Song).  Leo orders Jin to go to the club to scrutinize Mei undercover as a customer.  He does so, but is then later arrested by Leo (part of their undercover operation) who orders Mei to perform a difficult ""echo game"" dance for him.  She dances flawlessly, but he arrests her and takes her to his headquarters.  Jin, still working undercover, helps Mei to escape as his plan with Leo is to let Mei lead them to the House of Flying Daggers.  In the countryside, Jin and Mei are hunted initially by Leo and his men, but then a higher-ranking officer sends his own soldiers after the pair and Jin is forced to kill his own fellow soldiers.  While fleeing the soldiers, an interesting relationship develops between Mei and Jin as they continue to get closer to the highly elusive House of Flying Daggers.  Several excellent plot twists then reveal the full extent of who everyone is and leads to an emotionally powerful ending.

With a combination of excellent cinematography, well-choreographed martial arts, an engaging story and well-acted characters, ""The House of Flying Daggers"" is indeed a very excellent film.  People who enjoyed director Yimon Zhang's interesting use of color in the 2002 film ""Hero"" will see a similar use of color in this film, but he doesn't use color to convey the same meanings in this film as he did in ""Hero"".  It is also apparent in this film that there have been improvements in the martial arts choreography and special effects that made the various battles far more natural and fluid in appearance.  Overall, I rate ""The House of Flying Daggers"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.",1114905600,,2405,4.791767554479419

Of course there was magical flight that was incorporated into the movie but it wasn't as flaky as older films because of the fight choreography. From hand to hand to weapons combat every fight scene had it's own element of surprise. And that goes for the storyline as well. The conflict of the movie is pretty interesting and you'll want to know what happens when the story shifts towards the end so check it out!,1114732800,,511,4.565217391304348
2231426,4,B0007Q6VXC,"I was suprised by the short length of time this movie was available in the theatres locally, and the lack of promotion. It never got any TV ads, that I saw, and seemed to have a 1 week run. I decided to order a copy when I saw it was coming out (partly because the little I'd seen looked good and also because of Zhang Ziyi) and was not disapointed, this movie is much better than Hero.

The plot seems to be of some Chinese Government(military/police(?)) people plotting to capture figures in a terrorist group by sending one man undercover to get close to a suspected terrorist member. He ends up falling in love with her and abandoning his cause when it develops that he'll have to kill a lot of his own people to maintain his cover.

I've read here on Amazon about how some Chinese/Asian films are butchered by editing when brought over to the American Market, I've also read a website review in which the writer said this movie was the most beautifully handled movie he'd ever seen. I didn't have any real trouble following the plot (some mysteries were cleared up as the story moved along). If it'd been my job to edit I would remove only one short scene near the end in which Government troops are, I guess, moving in on the Flying Dagger group- that didn't seem to have much point to it. The color looks great, the sound was good, most sets looked good ( one or two small ones might've been a bit cheap)somebody really did a good job here. I noticed in the credits that part of the movie, must've been the fight scene at the end, was filmed in Ukraine, I didn't expect that but had thought that the area did seem large and undeveloped for China. Zhang Ziyi has apparently done a lot of work for an actress her age, she's very good here- Amazon has many of her films.

The movie is Chinese but I noticed that the Computer FX were Australian as was some sound work. The soundtrack composer is Japanese as was the costumer (surprising to me with the Japanese invasion of China in WWII). I was surprised to learn that lead actor Takeshi Kaneshiro (that is a Japanese name isn't it?) is in fact Chinese, one of the few Chinese actors to be big in Japanese action movies (I've seen him in Returner). My worst complaint about the whole DVD is in the ""Making of"" featurette, if the subtitling is done accurately it sounds like the Chinese government wrote the dialog, everything is ""perfect"", ""best"" or words to that effect. When producer Zhang Zimou is talking the subtitling for his dialog is all right, not boastful, preferable to Goverment Guy.

2231427,4,B0007Q6VXC,"This movie was all three I believe...good, bad and ugly.

The good.

It had amazing fighting and action stunts. I liked how close she came to death.

If they can fly, whats to say that their daggers can't hit their targets (sometimes repeatedly). And who's to say that someone who appears dead isn't.  Other things I can't mention, would ruin the plot.

The images and metaphors, how time flew, seasons change, trees to bamboo, life to death, all very good. A battle with no winners.

The bad.

I longed to see the stalker guy die.  I think that this movie seems more like a chapter from a book, than a complete book.

Much of the story line was predictable.  Not all of it, or it would have been ugly.

The ugly.

The ending. It was good until you wonder what exactly happened to the house of flying daggers?  Will there be a sequel?  Was this the end?  How pathetic.  Distracting us with an eternal battle, only so that we forget about the one we never get to see.

My wife and I were eagerly anticipating seeing this film since we loved Crouching Tiger and thought Hero was pretty good.

It seemed upon watching the film, however, that the director is focused on beautiful imagery and imaginative use of color and action at the expense of story and dialog.  The story was dull with many climaxes and much melodrama (a dead character rises from the snow....and we knew it was coming!).  And how many references to ""wind"" can we hear before the point is made ad nauseum?

Although I didn't find it quite as engrossing as Hero, this movie is just as melodramatic, the ending especially so. And just as in Hero, mostly everyone dies. The love triangle  in this film is only a tad different. It being two men who love a woman instead of Hero's man being the revolving factor.

Its interesting how Yimou Zhang can take such basic plots and convert them into such amazing movies. Because if you look at it, Hero and House of flying Daggers are basically movies on human emotions and the choices we make, the outcomes and what could have happened instead.

2231431,5,B0007Q6VXC,"Story line aside, this is a good home theater DVD test disc few other movie DVDs can match. One caveat, you should use the Chinese sound track for testing.

The disc contains Chinese, English and French sound tracks and one commentary track. Do not assume the three sound tracks are the same except conversations. The English sound track is the worst of all. Take the acclaimed ""Echo Game"" scene for example, the English sound track not only is muted in dynamic range but also has very narrow sound frequency range.  If one only listen the English sound track, one would think is only a mediocre to average sound track. The French sound track is much better and very close to the Chinese sound track. A very good sound track by itself but compares the Chinese sound track, the sound is less refined in both high and low frequency ends.

Speaking of the ""Echo Game"", it is the money shot as test disc. Very rarely, one can find a short chapter on any DVD that can test both the sound and image system of a home theater setup. As mentioned before, one should only use the Chinese sound track for testing. The ""Echo Game"" uses full surround to great extend. Most of the movies only use limited frequency range in the surround speakers in a 5.1 setup. This one uses full frequency range not just the front speakers but also the surround speakers to create the very impressive surround sound effect when beans are hitting the drums from all directions and then drop to the ground. The sleeve hitting the drum part makes use the surround speakers to pin points the drum positions. In the entire scene, the base should be strong and yet crisp. On the subtle side, one should also be able to hear some whisper from the crowd on the second floor. Together with the drum scene, makes a good dynamic range test (the English and French tracks has higher level of whisper background sound make them less a test for dynamic range).

Although I think the overall image is a bit on the soft side, at least it did not suffer from the ghost of over sharpening. Even so, the building, carpet and costumes in the ""Echo Game"" have more details and shades of color than most movies in one setting. If you have a HDTV, this is a good chapter to test how good your display is. This is in particular if you have a DVD player or PC setup that can up sample the image to 1080i instead of the regular progressive 480p. While I can only see minor improvement of up sampling on ""Lord of the Ring"", this one is far more significant. In terms of color, there are many saturated color right next to more subdue shades and hues. In a lesser display, either the saturated color will over run or bleeding through the surrounding or the saturation will be muted. The use of a large number of saturated colors also helps to determine the color accuracy of the display (do you see her lip as bright red or orange red?).

The rest of the movie has many great cinematographic scenes and the bamboo forest fight certainly is a great action shoot with great surround sound effect. But if you want a short test for both sound and image, the ""Echo Game"" is hard to beat and by itself worth the price of the DVD even if you are like me who does not care about the story line.

I wish the DVD has DTS ES sound track but as is the sound quality for the Chinese sound track and to a bit less extend, the French sound track is very well mastered that are far above average. Five stars for the sound and image. Three for the story line.",1114387200,,3485,4.378670788253477
2231432,5,B0007Q6VXC,"The scenery (even if some of it is Ukraine), the colour palettes employed for costumes and lighting, the action, the pace of the film, the story istelf and the incomparable Zhaing Ziyi combine to make this film an outstanding acheivement in every respect. This is essentially a love story set inside a political morality tale, and the chemistry between the two protagonists is positively enchanting. When the double-crossing police captain returns to Mei in her most dire straits and and tells her, when she asks him why he returned, that he came back for her, you honestly feel it in your gut. Anyone who has taken some unforgettable plunge, some ultimate leap of faith for the one they love, will feel the delivery of this line. That it all turns out as it does takes the notion of kharma and to task for not having more intelligence.

Who is Nia? Who are the Flying Daggers? Why should it be that the story reaches a set of conclusions that make you want to stand up and shout at the screen? Unlike CROUCHING TIGER, the morals are not as clear cut. All lines are blurred. And that is how most of us live, so while we may not be swinging from bamboo trees, allegorically, we all know what the director is talking about. There is much to contemplate here, especially considering the Chinese mythology surrounding colour.

And Zhaing Ziyi is possibly the most beautiful woman in cinema today, and one of the most powerful actresses ever. Kate Blanchett and Michelle Yeoh seemed to be roled into Ziyi. She has a command of the camera that head-cases like Kidman would kill for. She can appear both as ingenue and as deadly as sin. The echo game that sets the drama in motion is beyond compare to anything in film to this point.  There is in every frame with her a sense of mystery, danger, intrigue, intelligence, sexuality and surrender that captures the soul and she moves effortlessly through all the changes and emotional landscapes as naturally as though the story were really hers.

The DVD features a few commentaries, if you like that sort of thing, and a very lame lip-sync by Kathleen Battle. But a film this good doesn't need anything superfluous. In fact, it's as well that the extras are meager, they would only take away from the experience of an incendiary and captivating and soul-wrenching story of love. Of all the films that have come out in this genre, this one may be the best, and very hard to top. But we'll see what Zhaing Ziyi does next....",1114387200,,2464,4.6187214611872145

In my opinion, though, after about the 2nd time viewing, it is difficult to pop the disc in without skipping to the action sequences. The notion of it being better than ""Hero,"" though, is relative. I actually think the two have similar appeal. It does have as many tear-inspiring moments as ""Crouching Tiger,"" so definitely for fans. Replay value is only moderate, however. I think this may be due to the fact that the romance aspect of it is a little choppy. If you pause any part of the romantic scenes (which was only to answer the door, I assure), ""Jin's"" facial expression is contorted to such a degree that would make any audience feel awkward. So, maybe it's that. I mean, what movie is all just fighting? They had to throw a little romance into it.",1114387200,,1168,4.674757281553398
2231435,5,B0007Q6VXC,"I think Yimou Zhang has made the two most visually beautiful films I have seen in the past year, with ""Ying xiong"" (""Hero"") and ""Shi mian mai fu"" (""House of Flying Daggers"" but literally translated as ""Ambush From Ten Sides"").  The common denominator is not the martial arts action couple with the Hong Kong wire work but Zhang's use of rich colors.  I know that Akira Kurosawa pained a field of grass gold for a scene that ended up being deleted in ""Ran,"" and for all I know Zhang painted all those bamboo trees green in this 2004 film.  But Zhang has been paying attention to color for as long as I have been watching his films, which goes all the way back to 1991's ""Da hong deng long gao gao gua"" (""Raise the Red Lantern"").  The man is an expert at creating scenes of spectacular visual beauty on a motion picture screen and this time he is really into blue and green big time.

This is a movie where you do not really care about the plot beyond its ability to move us from one beautiful set piece to the next.  Mei (Zhang Ziyi) is the blind daughter of the former leader of the Flying Daggers, a secret group that is combating the corrupt Tang Dynasty of the 9th century in China.  The name comes from the fact that they throw daggers, and there are some daggers that are followed by the camera in this film the same way George Lucas followed the X-fighters in the trench during the attack on the Death Star.  Mei is a dancer at the Peony Palace, and Captain Leo (Andy Lau), a local cop, sends his young colleague Captain Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) to investigate the mysterious blind dancer who is suspected of having ties to the Flying Daggers.  While you know this is the beginning of a romance, because who could not fall in love with the beautiful and talented Mei, what matters is that we are up to the first spectacular set pieces, the Echo Game, played between Leo and Mei where the blind dancer shows she definitely knows how to play the game (and strike a pose).

The battle in the bamboo forest is the most impressive of these sequences, but I liked the choreographed battle in the field of grass with the two lovers encircled by swordsmen and the part in the final fight where it starts to snow.  I understand there are homages in this film, but while I get the link to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" going back to the bamboo forest scene from ""A Touch of Zen"" is beyond me because I do not watch too many of these films.  But, wow, the ones I have seen make me wonder why I am not watching at least one in a week and the answer is I know in my heart they cannot all be as beautiful as this one.  What will Zhang come up with next?  We cannot but wait to find out (he is currently filming ""Qian li zou dan ji,"" which literally translates as ""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"" and is apparently about a Japanese father her take his ailing son to China's Yunnan province to learn opera).

Granted, ""Shi mian mai fu"" has flaws despite its great beauty.  The political backdrop of the film seems to matter at the start, what with the emperor being weak and the officials being corrupt and all, but all that really matters is that Mei starts off on the opposite side of Leo and Jin, who best laid plans are going to go astray in ways too tragic for them to forsee.  That is because the story is an excuse to get us from one spectacular set piece to the next and the sides exist simply for one lover to cross over to the other.  The swordplay is more stylized than I have seen in other films of this genre and seems to involve less wire work as well, which is fine with me, because I would rather see it used selectively as it is here.  There is also a song that Mei sings early on where you need to pay attention because it will come back more poignantly later on.  The film has an English audio track, but you are obviously advised to go for the sub-titled original audio track because dubbed always sounds dubbed and that means tacky.  Gorgeous films do not deserve tacky audio tracks.",1114300800,,4001,4.300932090545939
2231436,5,B0007Q6VXC,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" introduced Ziyi Zhang to the world stage in a big way.  Aside from her intoxicating beauty she also displayed consummate skill as an expressive actress and a ballerina's agility in the film's martial arts sequences.  In ""House of Flying Daggers"" her aura of invincibility further blossoms.  As Mei, the blind warrior, she commands the screen as well as any actress working today.  Director Yimou Zhang has crafted an entertainment like no other I've seen before.  Yes, there are stunning exhibitions of martial arts, however, the film also concerns itself with matters of the heart.  This results in intricate plot twists that I will not reveal.  The film also features gorgeous cinematography as well as breathtaking editing.  In the end it's the story that will haunt you. Ziyi Zhang recently changed her name from Zhang Ziyi and is learning English in an effort to break into Western films.  Here's hoping that if she does make the successful leap she does not compromise what made her so unique in the films she made in her native tongue.",1114300800,,1075,4.960893854748603
2231437,4,B0007Q6VXC,"Of the three most well known Wushia movies in the past few years, House of Flying Daggers follows Hero and Crouching Tiger.  It also has the most fantasy elements of the three -- not that any of them could possibly be called realism.  They are all beautifully filmed and choreographed.  One of the real treats in all three is the presence of Zhang Ziyi.

The plot twists and turns in Daggers are a little more surprising than in the previous two.  The action begins with the blind dancer, Mei, playing a game called Echo with Captain Leo in order to avoid arrest.  She displays amazing skills in the game and in the fight that follows, especially for a blind woman.  The officials, led by Leo, suspect Mei is a member of the anti-government group House of Flying Daggers whose leader they had recently assassinated.  They hatch a plot to use Mei to lead them to the new leader by breaking her out of jail.  Captain Jin will lead the escape, woo and win her love, and have her eating out of his hand.  Soon, however, one has to wonder who is leading whom.

In Hero, director Zhang Yimou used color as if it were another character.  Color is also important in Daggers, but this time, sound is equally important.  Whether this was because of Mei's blindness, where her ears substitute for sight in the fight scenes, it is an interesting addition.

The romance heats up as does the pursuit of Jin and Mei.  When ""the general"" steps in and takes over, things become even more dangerous.  After a time, it becomes more and more difficult to tell who is on which side and who loves whom.  It is worth watching to find this much out, but hold onto your hankies.  All may not end well for everyone.

There are some inconsistencies and possibly some errors in certain details, some of which have been pointed out in earlier reviews.  However, if you're a fan of kung fu and Wushia films, don't miss this one.",1114300800,,1898,4.478134110787172
2231438,5,B0007Q6VXC,"I enjoyed this film very much. Despite the fact that it has Shakespearan feel to it. Remember Romeo and Juliet. Both main characters who meet and fall in love. Despite being on oppostite sides. The plot has a lot of twist and turns. So you will be fully capitivated. The visual effects as well as the costumes are amazing. The question ask throughout"" What is more important Love or loyalty""?  The question is answered at the end of the movie. Despite the typical ending you will fall in love with the movie anyway.",1114300800,,515,4.537634408602151
2231439,2,B0007Q6VXC,"I really had high hopes for this one, but it fell way short of its predecessors. This movie lacks the sophistication of crouching tiger hidden dragon and the beauty and special effects of Hero. The plot in this movie is poorly written, and the characters never develop, so that we never really associate with them, and end up not caring what happens to them. The special effects were ok, but could have been much better. And it is here that we are first introduced to the `smart' dagger, yes, a dagger that when thrown will not stop till it hits its target, even if it has to bounce a few times and take 90 degree turns!

I guess what this movie lacks more than anything is an ideology running in the background, but instead it tries to concentrate on a love that is nonexistent, the two actors had no chemistry what so ever, and thanks to the stupid twist, in the end we really don't know how loves who,  till they start dying for each other. And the ending, well, it's not worth mentioning. Ya it was that bad.",1114214400,,1012,4.349206349206349
2231440,5,B0007Q6VXC,"A ravishingly beautiful tour de force by Yimou Zhang (and also by actress Ziyi Zhang), this film combines an ultra-romantic story line with incredible martial arts sequences.  Each fight builds in intensity until you're not sure what will happen.  This is the first movie where I literally held my breath, wondering if the hero/heroine would make it out alive.  Incredible.  The beginning dance piece(the echo game)is also an instant classic.  Magnificent.

However, I watched this movie with several young people, and most of them were bored, so age may have a lot to do with how people receive the film.  I believe that the movie's complexities and subtleties may best appeal to those over the age of 35, when love and loss become twin themes deeply etched in our memories and dreams.  To the young, they are still adventures waiting to happen, and they'd rather get on with it.",1114214400,,880,4.859060402684563

I would first note that this movie is beautifully done. The sets, the scenery and the cinematography are all very nice. Certainly visually stunning, as is Zhang Ziyi. The story is another matter.

The first two thirds or so of this movie is quite intricate and interesting and seems to be setting us up for a worthy resolution. The resolution however reveals fatal flaws in logic to say the least. The ending was in general predictable--why do Chinese filmmakers think that killing off lovers is art? A lover dying at the end of a Chinse movie is as predictable as John Wayne killing the bad guys. It's not art to kill off a star crossed lover if everyone sees it coming and certainly not if it makes no sense.

As for the manner of Mei's death, none of the scenes in the movie was more fantastic than her immaculate resurrection. It seems clear to me that the writer just didn't know how to end this thing.",1114214400,,939,4.511764705882353
2231442,5,B0007Q6VXC,"""House of Flying Daggers"" is director Zhang Yimou's second martial arts film after a decade and a half of character dramas made him one of the most highly regarded directors in the world. As he did in ""Hero"", Zhang brings his sensibility for human emotion to ""House of Flying Daggers"", creating a character-driven action film that will appeal to a wide audience. ""House of Flying Daggers"" takes place in 859 A.D., at the time of a weakening Tang Dynasty. An underground revolutionary faction called the House of Flying Daggers has emerged to hasten the Emperor's demise. Two provincial police captains, Captain Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and Captain Leo (Andy Lau) suspect one of the employees of an upscale brothel, the Peony Pavilion, of being a member of the outlawed House of Flying Daggers. Jin visits the Pavilion as a patron to investigate and is surprised to find that his suspect, Mei (Zhang Ziyi), is blind, stunningly beautiful, and an exquisite dancer. But  when Mei attempts to kill Leo, she is arrested. Instead of turning Mei over to higher authorities, The captains cook up a plan for Jin to spring Mei out of prison, gain her confidence, and allow her to lead them to other members of the House of Flying Daggers. Jin is confident that he can seduce Mei and win her trust. Leo is not so sure.

The first 20 minutes of ""House of Flying Daggers"" are so beautiful that I watched them several times over. Director Zhang Yimou reunited with production designer Huo Tingxiao and costume designer Emi Wada who did such extraordinary work in ""Hero"". Han Zhong's art direction is especially remarkable in the film's first act. Most of ""House of Flying Daggers"" takes place outdoors, as Jin and Mei flee the imperial authorities. But the film's most memorable scenes are indoors, at the Peony Pavillion, where the colors and designs of the Tang Dynasty are so captivating that it seems you could reach out and touch them. The audience won't soon forget Zhang Ziyi's dancing among these exquisite sets. But this is a martial arts film, and once things get rolling, there are plenty of sword fights -choreographed by Hong Kong action director Tony Ching Siu-Tung. Zhang Yimou makes it clear that he views fighting as nearly indistinguishable from the dancing, as these fights are stylized and graceful. On the other hand, they are full of passion, since ""House of Flying Daggers"" is a story of love in the face of war, with the  principle characters forming a tragic love triangle.

""House of Flying Daggers"" excels in indoor cinematography and is somewhat less impressive outdoors, unlike ""Hero"", which was spectacular in both. It doesn't have the narrative or thematic complexity of ""Hero"" either, although ""House of Flying Daggers"" unfolds to reveal deceptions within deceptions, which seem to be fashionable in most of the world's film industries right now. Because this is a character-driven film whose fight sequences don't pretend to be realistic, I don't know if fans of the martial arts genre will enjoy it. But those qualities will earn ""House of Flying Daggers"" popularity with viewers who normally avoid martial arts film. In Mandarin with subtitles.

The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 2005): ""The Making of House of Flying Daggers"" (45 minutes) is a little meandering and too long, but features interviews with director Zhang Yimou, Tony Ching, and the film's stars. Zhang talks about the film's themes. The documentary discusses filming key scenes and ends with the film's premieres in Cannes and Hong Kong. In Mandarin with subtitles. ""Creating the Visual Effects"" (4 minutes) has no narration but shows the original film for 5 fight scenes, then the computer graphic that was added, then the final sequence. ""Storyboard Comparisons"" show 6 scenes from the film playing out next to the storyboard for the same scene. ""Costumes Gallery"" (1 minute) is a slideshow of costume sketches shown next to the final product. ""Behind the Scenes Photo Gallery"" (3 minutes) is a slideshow of behind-the-scenes snapshots. There is a music video for the song ""Lover"" performed by Kathleen Battle (4 minutes). The audio commentary by director Zhang Yimou and actress Zhang Ziyi is in Mandarin with subtitles. He discusses his decisions and various aspects of filming and creating the sets, and she talks about her experiences for each scene. The commentary is conversational, but there aren't many lulls. Subtitles and dubbing for the film are available in English and French.",1114128000,,4469,5.033783783783784
2231443,5,B0007Q6VXC,"When the neighborhood movie houses seem to have an overwhelming number of martial arts films, both takeoffs on 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' quality and the 'Matrix' clone dalliances, and when the whole concept of mind-boggling flying armed forms  threatens to become pass, along comes another film by Yimou Zhang and the atmosphere changes.

Zhang fully understands the choreographic possibilities if this genre of films and surpasses his fellow directors with his sensitivity to story.  Yes, HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS has more special effects than can be listed here, but FINALLY the special effects embroider a tender love triangle in the year 859 AD at the core of the dissolution of the Tang Dynasty. Mei (Ziyi Zhang) is the daughter of the deceased leader of a dissident group called House of Flying Daggers, and posing as a dancer in the Peony Pavilion, seeks to kill the captain of the Tang army Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro).  Under surveillance, both Mei and Jin are captured by loyalist Leo (Andy Lau) and while both escape, imprints of the two men and one woman have been set and the resulting chase leads to much action, fighting, and ultimate entanglement of the three in a tender and pathetic love triangle.  How this resolves is the basis for the very supernatural ending.

The story is sound and amazingly credible due to the fine acting by the trio.  But the real glories of this symphonic excursion are the lush colors, magnificent costumes, the exquisite choreography of dance and martial arts, and the breathtaking camera work observing the forests and glens in the richest colors of autumn and winter.  Simply stated, this film is dazzling and brilliantly conceived and executed.

An additional factor in the film is the musical score by Shigeru Umebayashi interspersed with old Chinese songs played on authentic instruments.  On the DVD there is a music video that features Kathleen Battle singing the main song, and while the song and the video are not remarkable, it is a pleasure to see that Kathleen Battle is still singing and, though somewhat older in appearance, still lovely of face and voice.  The additional DVD features of the making of the film are far above average, especially Zhang's story of how the unexpected early snow during the shooting encouraged him to utilize this miracle of nature and indeed supply some of the more beautiful scenes in the film.

But why three stars?

a. The colors are great... cinematography fails to cope-up with story... (some times frame is glorious than the scene context)
b. The physical capabilities of martial arts are good and great... but the earth has rules of nature... (exceptions could defy gravity, that does not mean that gravity does not exist)
c. The character of Mei's is good but in the scenes of physical intimacy and emotion she loses maturity. But the director has used heroines ballet skills very well.
d. Consistency in keeping curiosity some times loses out. But short snippets wake you up.
e. The synchronization of special effects needs to meet the human capabilities. (too much of matrixism is not impressive)

Eh.

There are a couple of cool action sequences, but in the end you feel there should have been many more. Too much screen time is used to progress the love story, and the pace slackens then to a crawl. You feel as though the main body of the story is missing.

There's a sequence at the beginning, the Echo Game, which is just terribly paced - minutes and minutes of slow-motion cloth-flinging. That was a really bad sign.

The ending seems lazy in terms of choreography. A couple of nifty tricks, but a lot of rolling around in the snow.

By the way, don't put much weight in what the reviewer below (a Chinese living in US for 20+ years) says. He calls this a ""wushia"" movie... :D even a 5 year old Chinese child knows that in Mandarin (currently the national language of China) the proper term is WU SHU. Maybe our critical friend has been in the USA too long. Also, he states that ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a better representation of the ""wushia"" genre than ""House of Flying Daggers"". Everyone knows that most Chinese people really hated ""Crouching Tiger"". Actually I loved ""Crouching Tiger"" however, I wouldn't say that it ""better represents the wu shu genre""... It is one of the more refined ""wire-fu"" movies (not very realistic) exclusively devoted to sword (jian) fighting that also encompasses a wide variety of complex situational underlyings. In other words, it's a whole lot more than just a Chinese martial arts movie. If you want to see a movie that ""represents the wu shu genre"" I would recommend something like the cult classics ""Five Fingers of Death"" or ""Buddhist Fist"" or even ""The Five Deadly Venoms""... at any rate, you can add ""House of Flying Daggers"" to your collection of martial arts classics (or soon to be classics)... this one is a winner in every way.",1113955200,,1457,4.629343629343629

It's a love story between two warriors caught on opposite sides of a battle between a corrupt government and a rebel group (the ""House of Flying Daggers""). It starts out slow, but gets better as it goes.

PROs:

+ Fight scenes are well-coreographed and exciting

+ Beautifully shot

+ Well-scripted

+ Overall plot is good, with a cool twist about an hour into the film

+ No ""annoying comic relief guy"" that plagues so many martial arts films

CONs:

- Starts out slow--you won't see any action scenes until 15-20 minutes into the film

- Relies heavily on CGI sequences (especially for the flying daggers--the way they curve through the air and around obstacles to hit their target no matter what made me roll my eyes)

- Lovemaking scenes look forced and unnatural

As for another reviewer's slam against U.S. marketing for switching the order of Ms. Zhang's name, I read in an interview that she changed her name herself (on the advice of her publicist) since she wants to infiltrate Western cinema.  The American marketers did not make that decision for her, especially considering they left Zhang Yimou's name alone.

The movie has several problems. It is melodramatic. The characters are too tragic and almost unbelievable. Ziyi Zhang's clothes get ripped so many times in the throes of passion; it is almost funny. The biggest problem I have with the movie is that it focuses too much on the love story conflicts at the end and does not resolve the bigger conflicts.

I enjoyed the movie. In spots, it soared and at other times, I rolled my eyes. I kept comparing this movie to ""Hero."" ""Hero"" to me was a slightly better movie. I enjoyed the love relationships better in Flying Daggers, but the nobility of Hero redeemed the movie for me. Flying Daggers ended weakly.

2231455,2,B0007Q6VXC,"I bought this DVD with much anticipation, although I had read some of the negative reviews.  Ultimately, I have to agree with those reviews.  There are just too many problems with this movie.

The plot of this movie is overly convoluted and has this big hole at the end.  As mentioned by another reviewer, Anita Mui (costar with Jackie Chan in ""Rumble in the Bronx"") died of cancer right before filming for the movie and was supposed to have played Nia, the leader of the House of Flying Daggers.  Zhang Yimou re-wrote the script rather than re-cast the part and so Nia never appears in the movie, and the final denouement between the House of Flying Daggers and the government soldiers is only hinted at in the movie.

With this movie, the cross-pollination of Chinese martial arts and Western CGI special effects comes full circle.  The fusion of film cultures, which first showed up in ""Matrix"", is used extensively in this Chinese film.  In fact, most of the fight scenes, with the extensive use of ""bullet time"" (flying daggers and spears and arrows replacing bullets) resemble Matrix more than they do traditional Chinese martial arts movies.

For fans of Zhang Ziyi (and yes, despite the awful U.S. marketing for the theatrical release, that's the way it should be written, standard Chinese fashion, family name first), there is a lot of bodice ripping in this complex love triangle, but ultimately, her appearance in this film is also disappointing.

Zhang Ziyi is at her best and most beautiful when smiling or looking sad or frightened.  In this movie, for some reason, her face takes on mostly the look of a frozen mask.  Maybe this was the only way she could play the role of a blind girl carrying some deeply hidden secrets.  If so, perhaps the role was more complex than she was able to carry out.  The other look that she gives a lot in this movie is this angry look, and unfortunately, she can look pretty scary when she does that look, a hint that behind this pretty girl lies somebody who could turn into a venomous assassin.  Overall, this movie ranks in my estimation as one of the lesser efforts of Zhang Ziyi - by comparison, she was just breathtaking in ""Road Home"", and much better (despite smaller roles) in ""Crouching Tiger"" and ""Hero"".

In his previous movies, Zhang Yimou made brilliant use of color and the countryside as backdrops.  Here, the background Ukrainian forests are rather nondescript, and do not match the intensity or beauty of the countryside seen in his previous works such as ""Road Home"" or ""Hero"".  Also, as mentioned by others, the sudden shift from these northern forests to the tropical bamboo forests is jarring and illogical.

The love scenes are not filmed very well.  There's just too much of this visual impression of a large man lying on top of a petite woman, crushing her.  The love triangle between the characters of Mei, Jin, and Leo never has much of an emotional impact.  Andy Lau probably does the best at trying to express the frustration of love forsaken.  Zhang Ziyi and Takeshi Kaneshiro just don't seem to ever connect or have much chemistry.

Lush, eye-popping and mesmerizing are woefully inadequate words to describe this widely reviewed and praised Chinese film.

Set in 859 AD during a corrupt period of the Tang Dynasty, two government officers search for an underground rebellion calling themselves House of Flying Daggers. Their only chance to find the rebels is a blind women named Mei.

Space does not permit a description of the twisty and always surprising love triangle that's interweaved against the political complications, betrayals and epic action.  Far superior to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Hero."" ""House of Flying Daggers"" delivers all the universally relatable elements that western viewers want in Asian films.

The extraordinary cinematography by Xiaoding Zhao must be seen to be believed. Extras include dense commentary from director Zhang Yimou and actor Ziyi Zhang, a better than average making-of featurette, a peek at visual effects, storyboard and more.

2231462,4,B0007Q6VXC,"Color, texture and movement dominate director Yimou Zhang's ""House of Flying Daggers"" a fascinating martial arts/action adventure film in the mold of ""Hero"". In the year 859 AD Two government officers Jin and Leo (Takeshi Kaneshiro and Andy Lau) search for an underground rebellion calling themselves House of Flying Daggers. Posing as an escort for the deceptively quiet but deadly Mei (Ziyi Zhang) a blind woman who is affiliated with the group, Jin travels through the forests as savivor and guide. After she's imprisoned Leo has Jin travel with her in hopes of uncovering the lair of the rebels. All is not tranquil, however, as soldiers make Jin's own soldiers attack them when escaping. The two become romantically involved as they travel together complicating their situation even more. Featuring marvelous swordplay and fight sequences, ""House of Flying Daggers"" focuses more on the narrative action story at the core of the film more so than ""Hero"".  Borrowing from the Wushia genre of Chinese martial arts films, ""House of Flying Daggers"" features some strong performances and the direction is taunt throughout.  While the script could be better developed, the visual flair of director Zhang saves the day much as it did for ""Hero"".

Featuring a stunning transfer, ""House of Flying Daggers"" looks positively sumptuous almost like a moving feast of color and motion. The rich, vibrant colors of the original theatrical release are accurately captured in this high definition transfer of the film. The 5.1 mix captures every bit of motion from the film and places the audience smack dab in the middle of the action.

We get a number of interesting featurettes. ""The Making of House of Flying Daggers"" provides a neat glimpse from conception to final production. ""Creating the Visual Effects"" looks at some of the outrageous stunts that are performed in the film and the wire work. ""Storyboard Comparisons"" provides an A-B comparison to key sequences in the film. The ""Costumes Gallery"" focuses on the beautifully designed gowns and outfits. There's also a ""Behind-the-Scenes Photo Gallery"" and Columbia-Tristar previews. The video for the theme song ""Lovers"" is also provided as well.

 Since the director doesn't speak all that much English, his commentary track is provided as a text commentary throughout the film. Actually, this unique approach works better as you're able to watch the movie in English or Chinese and watch the commentary whenever you want.  Ziyi Zhang also does her commentary in text format. It's a passable commentary track focusing more on the production side of things.  It can make it a bit confusing when both the director and Zhang make comments.

A marvelously colorful Wushia style martial arts film, ""House of Flying Daggers"" has all the motion and color that made ""Hero"" so memorable. While the story itself is fairly simple, the stunts and martial arts on display will distract viewers from this flaw. It's a well performed minor classic portrayed with vibrant, bright colors and stunning cinematography by Xiaoding Zhao.",1112140800,,3063,5.184210526315789

At the very least, it is visually magnificent (as are all of Zhang Yimou's films, all the way back to JU DOU, and one of my favorites, RAISE THE RED LANTERN).

The greens of the bamboo forest, the white of the snow, the sepia of the fields, and the mixture of the dance/drum scene are gorgeous and will keep your eyes glued to the screen.

Ziyi Zhang gives another seemingly simple but powerful performance.

The martial arts scenes are incredible.  It's neverending amazement of what the human body is capable.

The music is intoxicating.

The close up shots of weapons are as thrilling as a ride on a roller coaster.  Seriously!

The amalgamation of these qualities lead to sheer pleasure.

(The only problem, and it is overrided by all the positives, was that the movie seemed to be about 15-20 minutes too long.  The ending is the slowest part and the last fight seemed unnecessary.)

2231466,5,B0007Q6VXC,"Zhang Yimou's HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS is the much-awaited follow up to his highly acclaimed movie ""HERO"". The following DVD review is based on the 2-Disk presentatation with English subtitles released in Asia in 2004. However, since the initial US release of April 2005 appears to be a single disk, I will focus my review on Disk 1 of the above package namely the movie itself.

I saw Daggers prior to ""Hero"" so this was my first experience of an Asian movie in quite some time, and my opinions are from a westerner's viewpoint looking in as it were. I am not an expert on martial arts but I can understand some of the negative reviews from those expecting another ""Hero"". ""House of Flying Daggers"" is a triangle love story; it is not a fully blown martial arts movie. There are scenes of martial arts but this film is no ""Hero"".

When I first viewed ""House of Flying Daggers"" I was completely blown away by its amazing visuals. People have been impressed by Christopher Doyle's cinematography in ""Hero"", but Xiading Zhou who also worked on same, raises the bar as cameraman on ""House of Flying Daggers"". He delivers some incredible footage that in my view puts ""Hero"" in the shade. In fact this movie is a far superior film to ""Hero"" in every department. For one, the script is a big improvement over the previous film, and it's obvious a lot of work went into it because it shows. The story is full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing throughout the movie. Secondly, there are some breathtaking set pieces, which I will go into in more detail later.

The film centers around three characters played by Andy Lau, Takeshi Kaneshiro, and Zhang Ziyi. Lau and Kaneshiro play two government captains namely Leo and Jin. While Ziyi is a blind dancer called Mei, whom Leo suspects is the daughter of the former rebel leader of the House of Flying Daggers. She is also a specialist with the dagger as we later discover in the movie. This is 859AD, and we are told of a corrupt government in decline the Tang Dynasty. Director Zhang Yimou wisely avoids the temptation of developing the film into a blockbuster like ""Hero"", and largely focuses on the relationship of the three leads.

Captain's Leo and Jin hatch a plan to infiltrate the Peony Pavilion where Mei (Zhang Ziyi) works as a dancer. Jin pretends he is a lone warrior known as Wind, and arrives at the Pavilion to try and tease out Mei. Unfortunately Jin causes a commotion when he tries to make love to Mei, and is duly arrested by Leo as part of his plan. He also decides to arrest Mei, but concedes he would release her if she agreed to play the echo game with him. This involves throwing pebbles at a large circle of pedestal drums, with the blind percipient identifying the correct sequence by tapping same with an extended dress scarf.

This drum segment featuring Zhang Ziyi took twenty days to shoot, and is one of the most astonishing combinations of sound and vision that I have seen since Sergio Leone's cemetery masterpiece in ""The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly"". While Mei initially agrees to play the echo game, she astounds everyone by using this diversion as a tool to try and take Leo's life. Leo suppresses Mei and has her thrown in jail. Seeing this as an opportunity, Leo arranges a prison break with Jin acting as her accomplice. The plan, with Jin operating as Mei's escort, it was hoped she would lead them to the underground movement known as the House of Flying Daggers.

Thus the journey of both Mei and Jin (Wind) begins. To consolidate the charade, Leo orchestrates a number of fake ambushes. However, his plan comes unstuck when the General of the region takes over his duties, and orders his army to attack them without informing his soldiers that Jin is undercover. What follows are a number of mesmerizing set pieces with the bamboo forest escapade been one of the standouts.

I fully accept the various complaints about continuity problems with the forests and other anomalies in ""Daggers"". However it should be noted that movies are never about the nail been straight, but do require extensive use of an element on the right side of the brain known as the imagination.

As Mei and Jin continue their escape they gradually realize there is a mutual attraction between them, but Jin senses Mei is somewhat reserved in this newfound relationship. Though he cannot understand her reasons, he is nonetheless determined to win her heart.

There's a beautiful scene shot in the Ukraine, where Jin in cavalry poise, seizes some flowers for Mei while riding horse back. The blending of this scene, with the movie's extremely catchy theme music, delivers a genuine emotional sucker punch. It shows a poignant side that I was not expecting from a film of this type. Too often we in the west look upon Asian films as rather impassive, but this movie shows our eastern friends share the same feelings as the rest of us, and in this case puts many Hollywood films to shame.

I won't attempt to divulge any more of the storyline, except to say; do pay attention to Leo's (Andy Lau) dialogue in the second half of the movie, as there is a neat little twist in the final minute which is extremely clever. It goes without saying that Zhang Ziyi looks good in Daggers, though I've always felt eastern women have an unfair advantage over everybody else; they seem more beautiful. If you enjoy tales of mystery and romance this is a must see DVD, in fact it's probably one of the best love stories I have ever seen.",1110326400,,5488,4.619487179487179
2231467,4,B0007Q6VXC,"One has to ask, do the daggers come with a radar? I swear, I thought one of them was making a beeping sound, when it turned around... oddly enough the Last Samurai in Top gun came to mind????

I have a theory... there are two planes to reality in theatre. The first plane of reality, is one which directors trample over all the time... e.g. Grossly encountered coincidences, 920 degree somersaults, or even James Bond jumping from one plane to another. These miraculous feats are somewhat expected in your big bang movie.

BUT then there is the second plane of reality, which by all means (if a machine from the future hasn't come back, or we're not living inside a software) is theatre's point of relativity... Beyond this plane lies... swordsman walking on water, hillsides snow capped before your 2 minute noodles are done, or dare I say daggers that can take a tea break before piercing their foe.

Its a line that I hate watching directors piss on. And when they do, it makes me cringe... and I lose my focus... and the experience goes bad. House of Flying Daggers really walks that fine line... when laws of Physics as we know it are spat on...

The CG effects become apparent, and the invisible rope, isn't so invisible anymore.

Secondly, Im getting tired of these overblown love affairs, when conflict between ambition and love sweeps everything off its feet, literally. Its been done to death by the director. The storylines are somewhat always the same.

As a Kung Fu flick, the action scene at times are the most dazzling I've encountered... almost MANGA like. Its absolutely beautiful at its finest moments, specially the Bamboo scene. Reminds me of the late great Ninja Scroll animation.

However, at its core, comparitvely, the hand to hand fighting is badly choreographed... this is most evident at the end, when the two men wreslte each other like two kids in a playground.

Jin's drunken behaviour is something to be embarrassed about, not because of the rowdiness but his acting was awful.

Despite my ramblings, there is plenty here to be happy about, and nevertheless a pleasant step outside the realms of hollywood... hence 4 out of 5 stars. Do go and watch.",1110067200,,2180,4.746031746031746

2231470,2,B0007Q6VXC,"Yes the cinematography and costumes are gorgeous, and the actors, especially the usually wonderful Ziyi Zhang, manage to deliver nuanced, touching performances.  But they do so under the weight of a ridiculous, cliched, non-sensical storyline that ruins what is otherwise a visually stunning film.  There are the hopelessly romantic who will allow themselves to be swept away by the beautiful surfeit of this movie, but anyone with the sensibility to require mature, credible drama will cringe as the cliches and unbelievable (and pointless) plot twists accumulate.  Most of the double-crosses and startling revelations that occur towards the end are meaningless and overwhelming, and by then you just don't care.  The story logic withers under the scrutiny of anyone who cares to recall what took place 45 minutes earlier.  It seems the director filmed without knowing the dramatic convolutions that would eventually take place.  The motivation of the heroine, and thus the romantic essence of the film, is invalidated as a result, wasting Ziyi Zhang's otherwise commendable performance.  And that is the only real tragedy here (and what a hottie she is - I don't want to let that go without saying).

Flying Daggers starts slow and never manages to find its pace or involve the audience.  By the end, House achieves a self-involved silliness.  Everything is overdone, from the opening echo-dance, which is wonderfully inventive but way too long, to the conclusion's macho duel-to-the-death-for-the-girl's-love that we've seen so often before.  Yimou demonstrates no self-restraint, perhaps overconfident as a result of Hero's success.  The martial arts sequences in Hero are fantastic and dreamlike, balletic and straining credibility but ultimately satisfying.  Whereas Hero neatly achieves a balance between realism and fantasy, Flying Daggers proceeds well-beyond the incredible into the ridiculous, and suspension-of-disbelief cannot nearly compensate.  If only the film's producers had invested as much time in crafting a credible story as in the production, this could have been a wonderful film.  It had so much potential, making the disappointment of Flying Daggers all-the-more bitter.

Instead of this overwrought, self-indulgent melodrama, see Hero (which I place among my two favorite films of 2004).  Or go back and rewatch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - still the best film of this genre ever made, and one of the best of all time.",1109203200,,2449,5.453580901856764

2231474,4,B0007Q6VXC,"It's very rare to have a foreign art movie featured in a mainstream cinema chain.  Likely, I sensed a minor revolution.  First, ""Hero"" and now, ""House of Flying Daggers"".  Action speaks louder than words and it's marvellous to see an art movie such as this cross into the main stream, akin to Shania Twain crossing the country channel into the pop channel. Personally, I find this movie and ""Hero"" achingly beautiful and yet, this movie moves me in a way that the previous offering couldn't achieve.  Everyone should be familiar about the story outline by now and what made this movie truly outstanding is Zhang Yimou's concentration into the triangular relationship between three main characters.  This is a movie that needs to be savoured slowly on the big screen.  What moves me even more would be its understated elegance and subtlety and the life metaphors that are reflected through scenes filled with cornucopia of colour.  This is by no mean a mere Chinese movie but an Asian movie that involves team from Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and so forth.  One can't help but noticing the end credit dedicating to the newly deceased Anita Mui, who was supposed to play the leader of the House of Flying Daggers.  One could only imagine how different this movie's dynamic would be if she's featured instead of simply these three characters.  Choreography of fighting scenes is more toned down in this instance.  More CGI, more brute force but less wirework has become cliche in Asian movie offering nowadays.  Whilst this movie's setting is bygone time, its love storyline is very contemporary aka complicated and immersing in gray areas due to circumstances.  A movie that deserves better and a movie that's unfortunately snubbed by Oscars (a mere one nomination) this time around.  A very well-done love epic and a movie that deserves to be watched on the big screen.  Highly recommended.  For those movie geeks, English title is very different from Chinese title, which means ""Ten Sides Ambush"".  Perhaps, it refers to the hole that the main characters that they dug themselves into and their inability to get out of it when they got stuck too deep in the mud.

I became familiar with the music first, and then I surfed the Web for movie reviews and viewer commentary.  Unfortunately, I encountered many negative interpretations of the film's story, action, acting, direction etc. After seeing the movie, I realized that the same elements which were criticized in this film were celebrated when presented within more ""conventional"" productions.

As wisely pointed out by a reviewer on another website, the tale is from the tragic tradition of storytelling. Similarly, the exquisitely choreographed action sequences and the breathtaking cinematography are based in artistry - not reality.  Although the plot - which wasn't that logic-defying (especially, when compared to those of Star Wars and The Matrix) - revolved around issues that may feel foreign to some, the drama's emotional core resonated with the most fundamental of human longings: The need for a life of freedom and the yearning for love without fear.",1108771200,,1291,5.1923076923076925

2231478,5,B0007Q6VXC,"Looking beyond the breathtaking cinematography, this is STILL a great film. I do not review movie. But this work deserves better than most critics believe.

Myth: every movie should have plot, character development, great cinematography, action, theme, the whole shabang. It's a 2hrs film, give me a break. I'd rather see a film that focuses on a few elements and makes them really shine than to see one that TRIES to be everything and accomplishes nothing.

Story: Read from the movie's official site.

Character development: lots of critics compliant about the lack of character development in this film. This steams mainly from the writer's unfamiliarity with the Chinese culture. It's impossible to explain 5000 years of character development to a foreigner in a 2-hour time frame. Chinese is a very succinct. In order to get the character, one has to pay attention to what they DIDN'T say, read between lines. This is fortunate for the American audience since most of what they did say was lost in translation anyway. The characters and their roles in the film were very vivid to me. This is especially true in Zhang JiYi's role. Though belonged to a clan of assassins she's not valued in the clan for her fighting abilities, but rather, being used as a sexual tool against men in and outside the clan. Even though she didn't love Leo, she stayed because of her respect for Leo (an accomplished agent) and loyalty to her clan. Her own personality/individuality was suppressed by her upbringing and social pressure. Very typical of Chinese females. But when Jin came along with a promise to a carefree life, she's torn between her responsibilities and her dreams. Her desire to run towards a foreigner and away from her strict family/responsibilities is, unfortunately, also very common among Chinese females.  :)  Some parts of the character development in this movie was so vivid that it hurt. Those who compliant about character development, check out Zhang Yimou's early art films... with ONLY character development and little plot.  See how long you enjoy character development before crapping out...

Cinematography: This is not a Lord of The Rings or Hero type of setting with big siege/war scenes. It more like Crouching Tiger with 2-15 people in a fight. Visually, the scenes are on par with Hero. No break through, but still an 11 out of 10. This is actually the first film in which I think Zhang JiYi looked stunningly beautiful.

Plot: Simple, tragic story with a couple of good twists. Good thing since a complex story will undoubtedly lose a lot of people who have to read subtitles.

Action: He directed Hero... Need I say more?

Acting: Andy Lau underperformed IMHO. Zhang JiYi did well.  Takeshi Kaneshiro did his part as well.

Overall: Zhang Yimou is definitely producing films with higher ""commercial"" value than that of his early works. And this film shows that he is a master in balancing between action, character development, plot, and message/theme. Don't miss out of this one! Go see it NOW.",1108684800,,3021,4.948616600790514

2231483,5,B0007Q6VXC,"I had the opportunity to see this movie before it left theaters in 2005 and it is great! The film is set in China during 859 A.D., during the last days of the Tang Dynasty. One underground sect called 'House of Flying Daggers' is openly challenging the authority of the corrupt government. To crush the rebels, two police officers Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and Leo (Andy Lau) plot an infiltration.

Jin poses as a wealthy man to meet a blind courtesan Mei (Zhang Ziyi), who is suspected to be the daughter of a leader of the secret clan who was executed, and Jin gains Mei's confidence by saving her life in which she then falls in love with him. By doing this, Jin hopes Mei will lead him to the rebel's secret base. Jin's partner, Leo, warns Jin not to fall in love with Mei but, fortunately, they both end up falling in love with each other anyway.

The rest of the movie is a love story mixed in with beautiful costumes and sets, lush scenery as well as spectacular fight scenes. The film itself delves into philosophical questions of whether Jin and Mei should go back to their roles demanded by the societies they belong to or if they should follow their own self-interest and go live happily ever after.

Somehow it felt like a second year film student (a rather inadequate one at that) has tried to use the visual/thematic elements of what's good about Hero and tried to plagiarize it for a project.  The whole color scheme saturation thing fell flat on its face.  The snow storm scene obviously mimics that of the Red whirlwind of leaves scene from Hero except it didn't serve the emotional punctuation.  It's trying to use the same devices but not to advance any plot, theme, or cinematic point, but using them for the sole purpose of having them there.  The plot was so silly it was hard to stifle laughs when the movie thought it was at its most dramatic.  It was tedious and revolting.  As far as the acting goes, there were no emotional engagement, no chemistry, not event for a moment - only intense but superficial acting.  I mean have you seen a colder after-desperate-sex-scene as they lay afterwards at an unnatural angle to each other on the grass but at no point touching each other or attempting to hold on to each other, not even their cloths.  Zhang Zi Yi is of course as beautiful as ever and fantastic as a blind girl but I'm hoping for a bit of emotional depth and realism from her, mayhap also a fleeting touch of vulnerability?  Sigh.

2231485,4,B0007Q6VXC,"Here's one word that sums up this film: Beauty. The plot of ""House of Flying Daggers"" (original title: ""Shi mian mai fu"") is lacking, but in a way it's made up for with the intoxicating sets, costumes, and exquisite love story. Zhang Yimou backs away from the grandeur of ""Hero"" in favor of a more intimate story.

It's 859 A.D., near the end of the corrupt Tang Dynasty. A guerilla rebellion called House of the Flying Daggers (who are able to throw knives at great distances) has sprung up against the government. Despite the loss of their leader, the rebels are thriving. Deputy Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) decides to go undercover to infiltrate the House, and he tries to get the trust of blind courtesan Mei (Zhang Ziyi), daughter of the House's dead leader.

But soon he begins to fall in love with Mei, which jeopardizes his loyalties while Mei herself is experiencing confusion. But government officials want Mei dead because of her sympathies -- and even worse, they don't realize that Jin is undercover. To make things worse, Jin is not the only rival for Mei's love -- his best friend is as well.

Director Zhang Yimou apparently said that ""Hero"" was the warm-up to ""House of Flying Daggers."" It does seem more polished and fully realized, without the ""Rashomon"" storytelling. Instead of a war movie, it's a mixture of fairy-tale romance and beauty, and spies and guerilla warfare. The final half-hour is the stumbling block, where some plot threads come unravelled. Things get pretty confusing, and.

Zhang doesn't drop the ball as far as stylism goes -- color and exquisite details are in every frame. They have an almost intoxicating effect, and so do the action sequences. One of the most memorable scenes is Ziyi performing the ""echo game,"" where she strikes drums in a particular rhythm with her flowing clothing. Not to mention a balletic, dreamlike fight in a bamboo forest, with the participants soaring and dipping like Cirque de Soleil dancers. It's all completely unreal, but there lies its beauty, like a painting of the sky that focuses on the sun and not the clouds.

This is entirely Zhang Ziyi's picture -- since her debut in ""The Road Home,"" Ziyi has proved herself a wonderful actress. ""House of Flying Daggers"" focuses mostly on Ziyi, and she gives a truly exquisite performance, particularly as a blind woman -- watch her face. The two supporting actors, Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro, do a solid job in their roles, particularly Kaneshiro, who brings plenty of life to what could have been another cliched bad-cop-turned-lover.

""House of Flying Daggers"" is worth seeing just to see -- it's visual ecstacy packed around a fairly typical love triangle plot and a slightly disappointing final half hour. But the sights alone in this intimate love story are exquisite.",1106956800,,2795,4.886075949367089

2231487,4,B0007Q6VXC,"I have very mixed views on this one...a great success and a great failure

I have to give this movie one very absolute accolade: it is BEAUTIFUL.  Hero, by the same director, made great use of pure colors.  HOFD shys away from such a stark, obvious visual style but still manages to be very nearly as beautiful as Hero.  Both the scenery and the fight choreography have some very breath-taking moments.

That said, HOFD has a rather large problem.  The movie commits what I consider to be perhaps the biggest movie ""sin"" there is: the movie is HEAVILY anti-climactic.  The best scenes occur 1/3 to 1/2 of the way through the movie.  That might be ok if there was a decent ending scene.  I haven't seen a movie fizzle out so completely since I saw Tomb Raider (not that the rest of TR was much better than the end).  The movie fizzles out on several levels.  First, the choreography of the final fight scene is completely lackluster- in fact, the fight feels more like something out of a King Arthur/Braveheart type film- not martial-arts related at all.  Second, the story simply ceases to make much sense in the final scene.  The motivations of the characters and the odd events that occur in the scene simply cease to be both sensible and entertaining.

House of Flying Daggers is beautiful, and I can easily recommend it- anti-climactic and all.  Just don't expect it to be Hero.",1106870400,,1382,4.60655737704918

2231489,3,B0007Q6VXC,"The House of the Flying Daggers directed by Zhang Yimou is fantastically one of the most visually moving films I have seen in this year. The director's usage of colors in clothing, nature and interior decor proves to be nothing less then pure feast for the eyes.

The lead actors all proves to be quite good. Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro both proves to be good actors and their fight sequences got power and believablity. But the movie actually belong to Ziyi Zhang who looks devastatingly enchanting in this movie. Its her movie all the way and she takes advantage of it throughout every scene she is in.

However, the story have much to be desire. I am not going to give out the story but its not very original and its not very believable. While any one part of the movie, the romance and its discords, the fight scenes or the cloak and dagger stuff alone may have work, when you combined the three elements, the story simply don't make sense. This is one of these movies you feel enthralled with while you watch it visually but as you walked away from the theater thinking about it, you get more disappointed when the elements of the story simply don't add up. If none of the plots make any sense, what are you left with but a visual masterpiece but that alone don't make a movie. There may be folks out there who may be more forgiving then I but ironically speaking, this is a type of movie that does make you think about the movie and its consequences. And more you think on it, more disappointed you will be. Why ask why??

2231494,5,B0007Q6VXC,"""House of Flying Daggers"" is the most romantic movie since ""The English Patient"" and the best action movie since ""Crouching Tiger.""  But, let the viewer be warned. It starts slow, and builds up in intensity as time goes on.

The year is 800 A.D. and the Tang Dynasty of China is menaced by a secret organization called the House of Flying Daggers.  Two under-cover policemen conspire to infiltrate the HOFD They see their opportunity through a captive partisan, a blind, beautiful, and deadly dancer named Mei, played by Zhang Ziyi.  One of the policemen, Takeshi Kaneshiro, breaks Mei out of jail hoping she will lead him to the headquarters of the House of Flying Daggers. Dogged by pursuers, they flee together through a gorgeous landscape of autumn color, bamboo forests, hidden perils, and twists of the plot at every turn. Ostensibly an action picture, the romance -- and the deceit -- between Zhang and Kaneshiro dominates the movie, although there are enough artful action scenes to satisfy all but the most fanatic of Chinese martial art fans.

""House of Flying Daggers"" is an old-fashioned romance dressed up in lavish Chinese costumes and photographed ravishingly. There is a bit of grit it it too.  Zhang gets mussed and bloody -- sweats, cries, pants for breath, looks terrified, and shows a bit more skin than is common in Chinese movies. She was underused in ""Musa"" and ""Hero,"" but comes into her own as a glamorous waif in ""House of Flying Daggers."" Not the least of the sumptuous pleasures of HOFD is the song by opera singer Kathleen Battle at the end. To tell more would be to give away surprises in this spectacular movie.

2231495,4,B0007Q6VXC,"House of Flying Daggers (HFD) is a tough movie to recommend to acquaintances without in-depth explanation. Neither as accessible as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (CTHD), nor as sumptuous and epic as Jet Li's Hero, it is having trouble finding a Western audience despite glowing critical reviews.

It is still an excellent, exquisite motion picture, beautiful in form, thought-provoking in function. And its action scenes are the real deal. It's just that the other parts may not be so tolerable to those who will most appreciate them.

Imagine Shakespeare was Chinese; that is an apt way to begin describing this movie. Already the fanboys are turning up their noses. Then imagine he wanted to tell a romantic tragedy. Bid bye-bye to most other males. Then imagine him telling his story integrating amazing CGI, wire-fu and sword fighting. So long, women. On the sum of such description, that leaves as this film's audience only the curious and the brave and fans of pure cinema. But while its elements do not mesh perfectly, HFD has something exciting for everyone if they are patient, and it demands a bigger audience than it is getting.

The action scenes truly are instant classics, notably the ""Echo Game"" sequence, and especially the attack in the bamboo forest. This latter is astonishing: suspenseful, surreal, beautiful, even horrifying, as myriad faceless soldiers attack the lovely and talented Zhang Ziyi from above, sliding down or gliding across towering bamboo shoots. The scene is bathed in fog, and the green of the soldiers blends unsettlingly with the green of the plants. This scene is enough on its own to suggest action buffs see this movie.

But the story is basically a romantic triangle between Ziyi, who plays a blind revolutionary in 9th-Century China, and two of the Emperor's local constabulary, one of whom wins Ziyi's trust so that she will lead them to the leader of her movement, the titular House of Flying Daggers. There is a lot of PG-13 heavy breathing (a few too many instances for me) and subtitled talk about feelings in between the fights, so I would also feel confident that chick movie aficionados could also find much to enjoy about the movie. They will probably have a good cry, and I was saddened myself, like I was by the final portions of CTHD, although I reserve the salt of my tears for really truly melancholy things, like the demise of Godzilla in his movies.

Not everything is as it seems in the relationships and alliances of the characters, leading to lies and betrayal and more deep breathing. The ending combines the melodrama of the Bard's great tragedy with the loud action posturing of Mission: Impossible 2, as well as marvelously evocative cinematography, forming a memorable conclusion to a great film-going experience.

On the whole, I believe Hero is still the best wuxia film I have seen, although CTHD and HFD are very close behind. So why does HFD in particular fall just short?

It is visually rich, but I found it less so than Hero, which used its color schemes so wonderfully. HFD relies less on color and more on design and motion for its beauty, although the extent to which it is different in those respects and ""not as good"" is a matter of miniscule degree.

The story was straightforward and smaller in scale, and was ultimately hurt somewhat that the personal conflicts are not paralleled by the larger battle the movie was building up to. Additionally, sometimes characters would seem to freeze without reason for a time off-screen, allowing other events to occur before they would act. A couple of times such contrivances hurt the story's flow.

Another 'criticism,' although I do not believe it myself, is that the style is no longer ""fresh"" to typical Westerners, who have likely been exposed to the two movies to which I compare HFD, and believe it is just more of the same. That is unfair. Although the three films are all similar, in that they are lush Chinese period adventures, each offers something different from the others, as well. And many of these same people see every cookie-cutter Bruckheimer or Hugh Grant film and never complain of the formulas.

And finally, I must admit that I am often dismayed by romantic triangles, as they seem never to turn out the way I feel they should. Sue me... I'm emotional, I'm a guy, and I need a rooting interest to carry me through the 'mushy' parts.

But again, these are minor debits. This is a movie practically unique in its ability to offer so many things of such high quality to such varied audiences. That is a marvel, but hard to communicate to those same audiences, and its wide appeal will paradoxically looks to be its doom commercially. What a shame. It is one of the best films of the year, even of the decade.",1106265600,,4756,4.801955990220049
2231496,5,B0007Q6VXC,"If you have not seen Hero, HOFD stands on its own for its gorgeous art direction alone.  If you have seen Hero, you must see HOFD, because HOFD is a perfect contrast to Hero; ""Hero"" cannot be complete without HOFD. Both films are about sacrifice.  So what set them apart?

While the message in ""Hero"" can be interpreted as ""the greater goods outweigh the individual needs"", the message in HOFD can be deciphered as ""the individual needs outweigh the greater goods"".

In ""Hero"", Nameless and Broken Sword gave up their plan to assassinate the emperor (thus giving up not only their desire to avenge personal hatred but also their individual happiness) because they realized that the power of the emperor might be the best solution to end the dreadful pains and suffers resulting from the a tangle of warring states.

In HOFD, Mei and Jin eventually chose to give up their mission to serve their respective political entity and instead, pursue their individual happiness and freedom.

In both movies, the outcomes are the same. No matter choosing the greater goods or individual needs ahead of everything, the individual cannot escape from suffering.  In ""hero"", sacrifice of the individual dreams leads to the broken hearts.  In HOFD, sacrifice of the greater goods leads to amplify the conflict of individual emotions (e.g., rejection and jealousy).  At the end, the individuals still suffer and death becomes the best way to free it all.

While Yimou Zhang was criticized for the communism dogma in Hero (the importance of the greater good over the individual freedom), HOFD is his brilliant effort to silence the critics.  HOFD manifests the unspoken (or relatively hidden) messages of Hero: the individuals' emotional baggage could outweigh everything after all. Humans are just humans.  They suffer and search for ways to alleviate their suffering.  And Zhang sympathizes with both forms of sufferings.",1105920000,,1906,5.090032154340836

One thing I've noticed but I guess most people won't notice is tht the big screen in threater is sort of making the image twisted, it was streched horizonally a little bit, so the poeple, the scene on screen looks a little bit fat, That made me feel very bad. I watched DVD version first, and loved it very much, mostly because of the beautiful images, so I went to the theatre to watch it on big screen, expecting to see it better. What a big disappointment, The focus of the screen moved upward, I guess in order to leave space for subtitles. But imaging this, a perfectly beautiful picture got stretched a little bit horizonally, it still looks good, but the ""Shocking"" effect of beauty has been lost. A gorgeous actors somehow looked muscular instead. It is totally different feeling. If I wanted the movie in theatre first, I might not really feel striked by the images, it looks OK to me. Just about that. Another thing is, when I watch the DVD, the faces of actors is in the middle of the screen, looking gorgeously beautiful, but on the big screen , instread, I see the faces of  actors on the top of the screen, and subtitles running on their chest or belly, the beauty has been lost. Did they make two versions? I can understand, with the actor's face in the middle of the screen, the subtitles will have been be running accross their necks, so they have to move the focus upward somehow.

2231498,4,B0007Q6VXC,"Well having seen a bunch of kung-fu and wushu films and series in the past, HOFD does a good job of integrating modern matrix-era effects with old Asian stunt techniques. I'm not a real big fan of Zhang Zyi, but she does stand out as a superb actress while just able to speak chinese. I had seen Lau and the other guy in bunches of modern serials and movies my Asian immigrant relative watch. They like Yun-Fat in CTHD are actually pop singers and usually in star in modern Asian dramas, and they definitely don't really fill in as Jet Li did in Hero as martial artists. Even Ray Park in Star Wars:TPM is much more convincing as a true martial artist. I suppose the CGI effects make up for it. Like other reviews on this Amazon board have said, this movie was made too be a soap for the western audience. Way too much skin is shown in the love scenes compared to Asian martial arts-romance films even  just 10 years ago.

But for the merits of the movie itself, there's no denying the outstanding quality of the director's art and cinematography which is impressing western critics. Zhang Zyi carries the movie through her personality and strange attractive and feminist charisma alone. The sound and music are excellently entertwined with the pacing of the movie. Overall it's a wushu book come to life when in the past it could only be imagined by reading about it.

Interestingly, the director seems to have been impressed and influenced by scenes from Lord of the Rings. There is a shot of a horse jumping over a tree trunk from below; a dead ringer from the horse chase in FOTR. And use of natural woods and surroundings while on horseback alone with LOTR's use of horse aethetics and acrobatics have cameos in HOFD.

2231499,3,B0007Q6VXC,"Let me begin this review by saying that I purchased my ticket and entered the theater *really* wanting to love this film. After reading review after review by professional critics that seemed to fawn over the choreography, story, or cinematography (or all three), I expected to feel the same way.  Afterall, I loved Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as well as Hero.  Why not this latest addition as well? Perhaps that was the problem with this movie--existing as another offering from the director who did the aforementioned movies, my threshold for the ""awe factor"" had been raised considerably.  In other words, I entered the theater wanting to love it and left with a ""I've already seen this"" disappointment.

Yes, as many have noted, House of Flying Daggers does offer new elements--an expanded romance story and better yet belated use of Zhang Ziyi.  It is everything else I have a problem with, because I feel the director has fallen into the trap of constantly desiring to ""one-up"" himself.  By doing so, he has developed a tendency to make the fanciful seem ridiculous, and the poetic seem melodramatic.  What might have wowed me in Crouching Tiger or Hero does not have the same effect.  Furthermore, his execution was just off, especially in the final battle in the blizzard.

This is not to say the film was a complete failure.  The cinematography and use of colors was, as always, a pleasure.  Zhang Ziyi was great, as were her two male co-stars.

2231500,3,B0007Q6VXC,"Before I make my comments on House of Flying Daggers, may I ask a question? ---Does anyone think The Day After Tomorrow is a great movie? This film has stunning visual effects. It also tries to express the human affections complicated by something big. But most critics said it's just ok or even bad. Now let's think about House of Flying Daggers. It shares both elements with The Day After Tomorrow. Reviewers love it! So what on earth is the fundamental difference between House of Flying Daggers and The Day After Tomorrow, so one is a great movie, but the other is just ok at most?

House of Flying Daggers belongs to the genre called ""Wu Xia"". It is different from the ""Kung Fu"" genre. Kung Fu films express the fighting arts with some sort of reality; Wu Xia is based on the martial art fantasy in Chinese. People in Wu Xia films have unimaginable fighting tactics which are not going to happen in reality. To show that, House of Flying Daggers employed modern cinema technology that makes the fighting scene marvelous and a visual feast. It is very successful and deserves credits on achieving that. But other than that, a good Wu Xia movie also contains the story lines to demonstrate multiple layers of human nature. Goodness verses evil is a common topic. The humble individual verses the great era is another. You can find this kind of thing in old, classic Hong Kong/Taiwan Wu Xia films. Unfortunately, House of Flying Daggers lacks the depth of that. It tried but not very successful. The relationship between the three main characters seems to pretentious. Then what is the Great Goal so that they need to sacrifice themselves so much? Nothing was shown in the movie, and at the end the director seemed to forget about the battle between the government force and the rebellion House. If the movie tried to convey the messages about the love and helpless individuality within a chaotic situation, the director or screenwriter had better tell us more about the personality and the intertwining era. But the movie didn't do that. Alternatively, the movie could be just telling a love story packed with exciting fighting scenes. It would also be great, and then let the roles develop more about their feelings toward one another. Unfortunately, it failed, again.

I found it is very interesting that Hero and House of Flying Daggers received mediocre or even mixed reviews in all three different Chinese societies--the Communist China, the Capitalistic Hong Kong, and the democratic Taiwan. But in the Western world, both films were regarded as masterpieces. In this sense, I found maybe the director Zhang Yimou made these recent films for the westerners but not for Chinese, who know more about the topic and demand more.

For the western people, House of Flying Daggers may still be a good movie to see and an easy way to experience the exotic ancient Chinese cultural fantasy. And I do think watching pretty Zhang Ziyi fighting in bamboo forest or hooking up with these guys is quite entertaining. But please keep in mind that when a film is aimed to please the rich, distant audiences but not its own fellow people with similar cultural background, it's not at its most authentic fineness and sincerity.",1105747200,,3218,4.815551537070524
2231501,4,B0007Q6VXC,"More than anything else, this movie is just beautiful. Almost everything is washed in color: costumes, buildings, and landscape. The two monochrome exceptions are dark prison and the whiteout ending. Very suddenly and very improbably, the end's colors change to bleakness as the plot becomes bleakest.

The landscapes, especially forest scenes, had their own beauty. I don't know Chinese geography, but one point baffled me. There were at least three distinct types of forest, including bamboo and something with white bark. They would alternate almost scene by scene, instantaneously. In the forests I know, dominant types of tree tend to cover large areas and tend to have wide transition regions. Well, the groundkeeper's work was the least of the unlikely goings-on in this movie.

The action scenes, of course, were well choreographed, including the dance and ""echo game"" early on. The closeups of flying knives, arrows, and whatnot were good, but hardly ground breaking. Mei, the female lead, was a formidable fighter until the aggression got close in, when she suddenly became a standard damsel in distress. I didn't think less of Mei for that, but I did think less of the script-writer.

Plot? That's not a selling point here. There's some, but only just enough to keep the movie moving.

It's good fun. It's full of beautiful scenes and beautiful people. It has good action scenes, and some are quite creative. If that's enough, you're sure to like this movie.

As the suspense builds up toward the end, I was expecting an explosion of the love triangle where the heroes take sides and a final battle between the daggers and the general's troops concludes the movie.  This movie doesn't do justice for the heroes' skills and heroism.  Instead, they end up killing each other nonsensically.  There are also some inconsistencies.  Non-stop fighting between the heroes from fall until winter is silly and probably taken from legend where they fight for 40 days and 40 nights.  I know it's only a movie but it should be a little more believable.  At the end, I have the feeling that this movie is incomplete.",1105574400,,709,4.801652892561983

This movie wasn't created to be a world class kung fu flick, but rather to satisfy the desires of the followers of the newest type of motion picture: visual poetry.

This movie relates to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero, and I'm sure you can figure out why without even watching it.  The visuals are ASTOUNDING and the acting is far from weak.  It even features cast members who were in Hero and CTHD.

The music intertwines with the fight scenes to create a breathtaking experience that you couldn't even imagine reading this review.

This movie was so good that I may very well go see it again tomorrow night after work, before it's gone from the theaters.

I first became a fan of this kind of movie after I saw ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  Growing up I enjoyed martial arts movies, but they just don't compare.  I love the accompanying sweet music, the breathtaking scenery, the slow-motion martial arts, and the excellent actors.  ""Hero"" with Jet Li is another great example of this new genre of martial arts movies that seems to focus on the ""arts"" instead of the fighting.

Hopefully there will be many other movies like these coming out soon in the theaters.  I have both the Crouching Tiger and Hero movies on DVD and I'll just have to wait for the ""House of Flying Daggers"" to come out on DVD.

In the meantime, I'm going to buy the motion picture soundtrack and hopefully see it at least one more time before it disappears from the theaters.

If you haven't seen this movie, definitely try and catch it before it's gone from the theaters; but at least there are the Crouching Tiger and Hero movies available on DVD for your viewing pleasure.

2231505,1,B0007Q6VXC,"What motive does this director have for destroying kung fu films? Honestly, I've being a fan of kung fu films for close to twenty years, since seeing ""Enter the Dragon"" as a child. Anybody who claims this is a great kung fu film must be the typical mainstream viewer who has only being watching them since Jackie Chan finally broke into the US mainstream market in the late 90's. Anybody who claims that this is a good film is simply not intelligent, like the director's other works the story line is uneccessarily complicated to mask the fact that the same plot lines and ploys being used to to explain why the characters are fighting are no different than those used in these films since the 70's. And the romance..... these films do not have anything which could be interpreted as chemistry or passion between the lover characters and are in no way erotic.

The main reason I hate this film so much is that it simply hasn't any good fighting. The actors are just that, actors. They are not stunt people or decent martial arts performers, silly effects and fast editing cuts may fool the untrained eye however. It's not a good film, there is no really depth, it's cliched, script is terrible, therefore one cannot claim that it is superior in content to any of the cheap kung fu flicks that have being churned out in the last 30 years. However the action is inferior in quality and especially quantity to 99% of these past kung fu flicks.

This is mainstream crap produced for the western audiences, no different to garbage like ""Moulin Rouge"", ""Titanic"" or ""Pearl Harbour"". The last true advances and inovations to this genre were pioneered by Jackie Chan, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Hero"" and this boring pretensious mess are the decline of the true kung fu film!",1105056000,,1775,4.685897435897436

She lived a reclusive life,

She glances once and the city is in ruin,

She glances twice and the country is in destruction,

1st Review:

About the ancient song in the movie

by nausicaa_aaa

Some one asked about the Beauty song (JiaRen Qu) in the movie. Here is some background info.

The song is from the ancient ""YueFu"" collection of songs and poems. YueFu was the government 'music department' that was first set up in the Han Dynasty (206BC-24AD). Its duty is to compose new songs for the emperor while collecting past and current songs/poems from the people all over China. The whole collection of songs/poems can be categorized according to their different purposes, i.e. religion, entertainment, military.

Reading these songs/poems can be quite interesting, because they show you how people live/think more than 2000 years ago. And among the collections you can find several deep and moving love songs/poems. One classic is ""The Peacock Flies Southeast"". In fact the story of Mulan (Disney film) is also based on one of these poems/songs.

About the song in the movie, it might be a fragment of a long poem. The English lyric from my memory:

""There is a beauty in the north, She is a paragon of beauty, She glances once and the city is in ruin, She glances twice and the nation is in destruction..."" When you talk about some tragic beauty whose fate happened to be part of the history.

2nd Review:

More than just a romance

by lienlijuan

""There was a beautiful lady in the North. She lived a recluse life. A glance from her would ruin a city; another glance from her would ruin a country... However, even though she could win you a city or a country, she would not be around any more"" (translated by author). This song is played three times in the film ""House of Flying Daggers"". It symbolizes the theme.

This song refers to a historical archetype: beautiful ladies in China such as Xi-Queh (5th century B.C.) and Diao-Chian (2nd century A.D.) served their city/country as a spy using their beauty to deceive the enemy. They have been usually remembered for their beauty and the service they made to the groups they belonged.

Destined a similar lady, Mei is treated however from an individualist point of view. This film shows how a woman endures humiliation and life-and-death dangers to accomplish her mission granted by her group. But she decides to free herself and die for something very personal (to live a life like the wind). The conflict between individuals and groups makes this film more than just a romance, or a Chinese sword buckler. It is a process of characters changing from being a loyal member of a group to an isolated individual in order to have this romance:

1st ambush after Jin rescues Mei:

Everything goes as plotted, to both parties' satisfaction. Spy versus spy, Mei and Jin represent two groups, not themselves. However, in the last shot of this ambush scene, Jin tries to have Mei better covered with her stripped clothes, a beginning of a man feeling sorry for a lady for what she has just been through, superseding his group identity.

2nd ambush in the flowery field:

The plot goes sour for Jin. After he realizes that he has been betrayed, he fights with the beautiful lady against his own people. Here the theme song begins to play. After Jin talks to Liu and quits, he is completely on his own. He is free to act as an individual from this point onwards.

3rd ambush in the bamboo forest:

Mei smiles - while facing death in an out-numbered ambush - when she realizes Jin has come back to save her. In the next moment of facing death, unknown whether her group is going to show up soon to rescue her, she says to Jin, "" You shouldn't have come back."" A comment not from a spy, but from a friend, to say the least. Mei reveals her personal feelings in this rare moment.

Of course, when Mei carries her group's order to execute Jin but eventually releases him, she has completed her part of superseding the group identity and becoming an individual. This allows the romance to flower.

Liu's attempt to kill both Jin and Mei is based on personal motives. But the dagger struck on Liu's back earlier by his group's lead symbolizes the group authority. Not until Liu pulls out the dagger struck on his back does he completely act as an individual.

At the end of the film, we finally see three individuals, in a locked love triangle. Ignoring and rejecting the battle to be taking place between their respective groups, these three kill and die for one another in a world, where Autumn changes to Winter and changes to ""forever old"".

The theme song plays once again at the end when Mei dies in Jin's arms, as it did when she first appears in the brothel. The film is almost shown from Jin's perspective. He cherishes, saves, and laments a lady, for all of us.",1104796800,,5303,4.686084142394822
2231509,4,B0007Q6VXC,"'House of Flying Daggers' is director Zhang Yimou's second 2004 outing (well, not really, considering the fact that '04s 'Hero' was originally released in 2002, then withheld by Miramax till recently). This time around, the film concerns the life of a blind showgirl, Mei (Zhang Ziyi), and her capture by the government, only to be saved by Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro), who prefers the name Wind (he says he is reminiscent of a ""playful wind""). The secret behind Jin is that he's actually an imposter, sent to ""rescue"" Mei only to eventually take her to the government. Many secrets unfold in the last third of 'Flying Daggers,' culminating in an intensely emotional battle between Jin and a man who comes to be part of a romantic triangle between himself, Jin, and Mei. There are instances of deep emotion surging throughout the film, which in some ways sets it apart from the more political 'Hero.' Yet, in my opinion, it pales in comparison. Though there are astonishing images, sequences (my two favorites being a battle in the depths of a bamboo forest and an opening ""echo game"" using abundant fabric and ornate drums), costumes, and sets, the allegorical nature of 'Flying Daggers' is not as strongly presented as 'Hero.' Often times, the deeper meaning can get lost in the often silly ending. However, this opinion may be a result of a current lack of understanding, just how I didn't begin to fully admire 'Hero' till I had researched it thoroughly enough to know its meaning like the back of my hand, in turn improving my opinion of the film. Still, despite the difficulty of fully unwrapping the mysteries of 'Flying Daggers,' I encourage you to look beneath the gorgeous imagery as there is much to contemplate in the areas of symbolism and emotional arcs. I assure you the film will be more satisfying when thought through.",1104624000,,1832,4.837579617834395
2231510,4,B0007Q6VXC,"OK, maganed to get the Chinese version of the film before the American theatrical release (gotta love imports!).

I have been waiting for this film since, oh probably the summer, and I have mixed reviews.

The bad:  The ending.  By drawing it out in the manner in which the director chose to, it took away from the emotional impact it should have had.  It was difficult to watch the last fifteen minutes or so.  The CGI Daggers.  They were a character unto themselves.  Which is ironic, since the Chinese name of the film means something along the lines of ""evading enemies from all sides"" and nothing to do with ""daggers"" if I recall correctly.  The daggers were a bit much by the end of the film. And I think there were a few holes in the plot, which I will address later.

The good: Mei (Zhang Ziyi), Jin (Kaneshiro), and Leo (Lau).  Very good acting (especially considering some of the plot holes).  Ziyi's dance sequence was breathtaking.  I am getting more and more impressed with this young lady, and eagerly await 12/05's version of ""Geisha"" which has her cast as the lead.  Yes, she has some flaws at times, but she really can carry a film.  Plot holes aside, I really felt as though the two male leads were stellar as well.  I think all the acting went a bit downhill after all the twists, but I was still very impressed (again, the plot holes!).  I liked the fight scenes, and was pleased that although wuxia, the leads did actually get tired and/or hurt and/or afraid once in a while.  Refreshing.  I found it to be a visually stunning film, which makes up for the plot holes on a certain level.

Now for the stuff that I think took the film down from what it could have been.  The abscence of Anita Mui.  She was to be the fourth lead in the film, Mei's mentor (and perhaps the leader of the renegades?).  I think our poor film got lost when she passed on and the director elected not to recast her role; instead he rewrote the script.  There were complaints that the film ""fell apart"" when all was revealed, and I suspect this is why.  Instead of having that fourth character to push things along, we were left with the three, and no real idea how to fill in the blanks.  The dedication to and respect for Ms. Mui is admirable, however it did cost the film some plot and depth.

Overall, I do recommend this film.  Highest recommendations?  If you are a fan of Asian cinema, definitely.  If you like your HK Cinema more Jackie Chan-esq.  No.  If you like the ""neatness"" (sarcasm avoided here) of most American films, you may have issues here.  Of course, this film may very well get a lot more press soon as the buzz is that this film is the front-runner for best foreign film, and we all remember what happened when CTHD won that award...",1104278400,,2753,4.4095427435387675
2231511,5,B0007Q6VXC,"This film is everything it was hyped to be and more. I saw the great Andy Lau was starring plus that Zhang girl from ""Crouching Tiger"" and I knew this had to be special and it was.

First of all, the story is excellent. One of the most intriguing, captivating, and clever plots I have ever witnessed on film. The twists just kept coming and coming. By the end I was just speechless, I was so impressed. Beautiful love story set against the backdrop of a kind of war brewing between the government and a group of radicals. That's all I'm gonna say on that in fear that I'll give away too much.

The acting is great. I was so entranced with the emotional struggles these characters were going through. And yeah, it's really nothing knew. We've all seen many stories about 2 lovers that happened to be on opposing sides but this story had an originality to it that kept it from becoming too routine. I totally fell for the illusions the actors were creating. It was just so believable.

And yes, there was action. From the phenomenal opening dance number to the ""final battle"" the action scenes were a mix of traditionally detailed swordfights to unbelievable superhuman feats like grasping a sword with a piece of fabric. And I won't even go into the physics behind the actual ""flying daggers"". It's all good.

So the movie was great. Beyond great, it was flawless. As for the ""haters"" dissing the CGI please ignore that mess. If you are planning to view this film solely for the action and/or the special effects you might as well wait for the DVD and keep your thumb on the fast forward button. However, for those who are ready to experience a film that will connect with your soul as well as your adrenaline look no further than this ""House"".",1104192000,,1743,4.506329113924051
2231512,2,B0007Q6VXC,"Before I spill the beans on this latest offering of Chinese period pieces, let me tell you what this movie is not.  It is NOT an action-packed martial arts bonanza.  It is NOT an epic in the way director Zhang Yimou's previous film Hero was.  House of Flying Daggers is merely a love story, or rather the story of a love triangle set in medieval China.  The center of attention (yet again) is the lovely Ms.(?) Zhang Ziyi who has the seductive mojo powerful enough to have two men cut, bruise, and tear each other up for her.  The story has a little bit of mystery attached.  For example, who exactly is Ziyi's character Mei and what is the House of Flying Daggers?

When I review a movie, especially one by such a classy director, I like to look at several key components:  (1) plot/story (2) characters and acting (3) the film's technical aspects, e.g. editing, set design, visual effects, fight choreography, etc. (4) the film itself, e.g. overall feel, pacing, did it have any entertainment value whatsoever?

(1) This is one of those instances where the plot can be viewed as being either blatantly obvious or infinitely convoluted.  Case in point, the ending of House of Flying Daggers.  The entire beginning and middle of the film is just a setup for the climactic ending.  I don't want to spoil the ending for those who haven't seen the film yet, but basically it is Mei standing between her two lovers in a final showdown.  She has to make a decision who lives and who dies, and she has to choose carefully because one decision could lead to her own death.  Her final decision and the conclusion of the film bring into light questions surrounding her character motivations and only serves to confuse the audience more as to who Mei really sides with.  So for the open-ended anti-Hollywood ending, I can give House of Flying Daggers a plus.

(2) There are 3 characters House of Flying Daggers centers around:  Mei (Zhang Ziyi), Jin (Kaneshiro), and Leo (Lau).  While Mei is the ever-enigmatic female presence in the film, the two male leads are underdeveloped and paper-thin.  Jin is the playboy and ladies' man who comes to tame Mei's heart, Leo is the angry pissed-off former boyfriend that wants to do what all betrayed boyfriends want to do:  kill the new boyfriend.  Another complaint I have:  with all the talk of the new leader of the House of Flying Daggers, don't you think he/she would serve more justice by having more than the two, maybe three lines?  One thing I really do appreciate is Zhang Yimou's sense of giving the actors space.  While most of the fighting and action sequences are cut up and edited, much of the dialogue between the actors is done with longer takes.  We really get to see Zhang Ziyi do more acting and expressing herself than fighting in this one.  And you know what I've noticed more in this film than in any of her previous ones?  She is a BEAUTIFUL woman.

(3) This is a very mixed bag.  On one hand, you have Zhang Yimou's careful attention to detail and the gorgeous set designs... on the other you have the piss poor visual effects coupled with lackluster fight choreography and confusing editing.  House of Flying Daggers is incredibly good-looking.  The brothel scene and the bamboo forests are quite magnificent.  Costumes are also very good.  It is very easy to imagine the film is set over a thousand years ago.  But coincidentally enough, such beautiful scenery also means the special effects stand out even more.  And what an awful job at that they did:  beans jumping, CG snow, ribbons holding swords... and like I said before, this is not a martial arts film, but this is one of those cases where the special effects do a terrible job at complementing the action.  Undoubtedly many Crouching Tiger fans will be let down.  As for editing, apparently this film took three years to put together, and at certain times it is rather obvious the dialogue was filmed at different times on different days, but that's just the nit-picky side of me speaking.

(4) Overall feel?  Well, despite the fact that the ""echo game"" dragged on for eternity and there were many long gaps of silence in between the dialogue, the pacing overall was not entirely inappropriate.  I just wish the director gave us, the audience, something more to work with after the movie ended.

>> 2 stars.  What a beautiful, glorious mess for Zhang Yimou.  Three years in the making, it's like an expensive wedding cake that gets dropped on the way to the reception.  I could not whole-heartedly say I enjoyed this.

2231513,4,B0007Q6VXC,"The very negative aspect of this film is the plot twists.  While the plot itself is not bad, the exposition of the betrayals could have been done in a more subtle manner.  The script is not too well written, either: Most of the conversations are overwrought.  The actors are left to work with lengthy speeches that overstates his or her emotional states and intentions.

On the other hand, the wuxia action of this film is very appealing.  What I found fresh in this film is the sound effect:  You hear the breaths and grunts of the fighters, which gives the sense of physical exertion which is missing in many of the films in this genre.  The obligatory bamboo fight was well done, even though I felt that it was clich.  What I liked the most was the sword fights in the open field, where you can feel the desperation of the main characters fighting against the elite soldiers that the general has dispatched.  Ironically, the most uninteresting parts of the film involved the throwing knives, where CG was overused and done in a cheap manner that you cannot help but feel that it was simply superimposed.  While I don't want to spoil the plot, the scene where the characters are running around with knives stuck in their torsos was too ridiculous - unfortunately, I and the rest of the audience could not contain our laughter.",1103932800,,1328,4.6127659574468085
2231514,4,B0007Q6VXC,"In the ""House of Flying Daggers"", Zhang Yimou adds a brilliant but apparently flawed entry into the flowering genre of artistically saturated kung fu films. Like its relatives, American comic book films, kung fu art films depend on advances in CGI to visualize the outrageous exploits glamorized in cheap pulp romances that thrilled the imaginations of countless Chinese youth.

The formula for these films was established by Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Romance and political intrigue propel a small cast of characters through incredibly lush landscapes and preposterous action sequences that are meticulously designed to subvert all suspension of disbelief. Zhang Yimou adds impressive insight into this strange art of surreal physics and dreamy foilage. In previous martial arts films, the underlying motivation for any combat was to crown the acrobatics of the most impressive athelete. Zhang Yimou, however, recognizes that in a world where flying knives reverse course and untrained actors can float freely from tree to tree, such displays of one upsmanship become laughably devoid of meaning. The combat in the ""House of Flying Daggers"" is thus motivated by relationships rather than competition, a nuanced expression of bonding or friction that end with wounds more symbolic than lethal. Any hope for a plausible physical reality or a clear sense of political righteousness is carefully sabotaged to support this visual language of landscape and movement that mutates unnaturally to keep up with the capricious shifts in relationships.

With its entire universe warped to serve the expression of emotion, the relationships in the film thus become crucial to holding this curious logic together. Initially these relationships are beautifully introduced and developed, with increasingly convoluted allegiances flowing into a pivotal battle in the greenery of a bamboo forest. At this point, however, the film collapses under its own weight, succumbing to the trendy sorts of plot twists that wreak havoc with character development for no other reason than to keep the viewer guessing. The difference between these latter machinations and those of the film's opening is the provocation for the twists: at first, a natural escalation of events leads to rising stakes that naturally force change in the relationships. However, after this point the film abruptly changes course and starts slamming in a series of improbable secret pasts with all the predictability of a soap opera. The result is a final confrontation that seems as painfully maudlin and contrived as the bizarre changes in its weather and the boomerang-like behavior of its knives. However, this opinion is from a single viewing, so subsequent consideration may make these revelations appear less arbitrary by adding meaning to earlier events.

Despite these misgivings, this film remains an absolutely mesmerizing experience. An astounding assault of color captures objects both animate and inanimate in breathless aerial ballets. Even during the most contrived of plot twists, consistently lush scenery and thought provoking symbolism mirrors underlying tensions in ways both intriguing and subtle. As an expression and advance of kung fu art films, this film will likely be remembered as pivotal achievement.",1103846400,,3295,5.52079207920792
2231515,3,B0007Q6VXC,"I enjoyed Yimou Zhang's Hero a great deal, but I didn't find this movie strong enough as a follow-up. I really don't like Zhang Ziyi, especially she just gave the worst performance amongst all the actresses(Carina Lau, Gong Li, Faye Wong, and Maggie Cheung) in WKW's 2046. I didn't mind her being a supporting role in Hero, but in this film she's in almost every scene, and after 15 minutes, I started to find her more repulsive. I was disappointed to see that Andy Lau had so little screen time, and he gave the most dramatic performance which should garner him a best supporting actor nomination.
OK, she was stunningly beautiful in the opening scene doing her dance number, so much for her early intense training that the stunts seemed like a piece of cake for her. But when it comes to acting, she has no range, she's flat without layers. No wonder she's bashed as the most over-rated, overexposed, and over-used actress from Asia. For instance, Maggie Cheung's performance in Hero makes Zhang looked like an amateur actress.
As for the movie, it lacked elaborate fight scenes compared to Hero, or other great HK period action pieces such as The East Is Red, Green Snake, The New Dragon Inn,The Bride With White Hair 1 and 2, and The Chinese Ghost Stories 1, 2, 3. No wire work and the on ground fight scenes are less stimulating. The flying daggers were impressive, as well as the bamboo attack scene. The final scene was overdragged, because it was not realistic that the two male lead could fight for hours and they were bleeding massively and were still alive. Also, Zhang Ziyi got hit in her chest by a dagger, and hours later, she still managed to crawled out of the thick snow, as if she had become a zombie.
It was unfortunate that Anita Mui was unable to play the part of the leader of the house of flying dagger, because she died from cancer. And the director didn't even make her role visible on screen, it was just mentioned by other characters. She would've been great for the part, but no one could subtitute for her.
Anyways, the story was lame in a way, and it certainly doesn't match with the English title, because it's about a love triangle, and not the house of flying daggers. The Chinese name meaning hidden enemies is more appropriate. I did however find the location shots to be visually stunning.",1103587200,,2325,4.591346153846154
2231516,5,B0007Q6VXC,"This movie was spectacular!  That is the bottom line, but, that being said, there were some loose ends that should have been tied up.  Most notable would be the imminent battle bewtween the House of Flying Daggers (the good, I guess) and the General's Soldiers (the bad).  I imagine it would have been a great fight sceen.  But that is not where the heart of the movie lies.  The story line is good, not great, and this too is not the highlight of the film, which leaves what, you may ask.  The art direction, cinematography, set design, original score, and near flawless blend of love, action, nature, etc. is what makes this film a 10 in my book.  You can't help but compare this film with Crouching Tiger and/or Hero, but my accolades stem from thinking about the other movies that came out this year - barely one holds a candle to this.  If you just sit back and enjoy the film, the aesthetic superiority, you will have an experience that movies should provide us with - a mixture of emotion, awe and, above all, fun.",1103500800,,1021,4.451612903225806
2231517,5,B0007Q6VXC,"""House of Flying Daggers"" has a lot to overcome what with the competition of ""Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon"" and ""Jet Li's Hero"" nipping at its heels. But even though the first  hour seems intent on showing its technical rather than its storytelling prowess, ""HOFD"" wisely switches to the heart of its concerns: a love triangle between the impossibly beautiful Mei (Ziyi Zhang), Leo (Andy Lau) and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro).

The plot has to do with ""The Government"" and a renegade band of vigilantes, The Flying Daggers and their struggle for power and specifically Mei's pursuit of revenge for the death of her father. There are numerous hand-to-hand combat scenes that are expertly staged and executed and director Yimou Zhang doesn't skimp on the bravura choreography and the gorgeous production design and costumes. I don't think we've seen such a perfect color design concept since Todd Haynes ""Far From Heaven."" Everything is simply breathtakingly color-coordinated. It's so perfect that it creates a worldview of its own apart from the film itself.

If I had stopped to consider the emotional power of Yimou Zhang's other films like ""Shanghai Triad"" and ""To Live"" to name a couple, I wouldn't have been surprised at the raw dramatic and emotional power of the last 40 minutes of this film, for it transcends its very specific genre and becomes a shining, brilliant example of thoughtful, heartfelt film making.

And the die-to-the-death battle between Leo and Jin becomes much more than a mere fight: it becomes a brutal stage on which spilt blood becomes a metaphor for the Love that each feels, not only for Mei, but also for each other.

Don't go to the ""House of Flying Daggers"" expecting a dour evil versus good film with lots of action because you won't get it. What you will get is a serious and uncommon treatise not only on the whys and the wherefores of Love but on the intricacies and mysteries of the human heart and soul.",1103500800,,1940,4.8844984802431615
2231518,3,B0007Q6VXC,"I am a big fan of Zhang Yimou, everything from 'Raise The Red Lantern' up to his last film 'Hero', which was his first martial arts film and a big departure from anything he had previously done.

'Hero' was a masterpiece:  everything from costumes to scenery to fights to actors were beautiful.  The story was intriguing.  It was half art film and half kung fu flick.  It was truly one of the finest films I've seen in many a year.

So needless to say, I was very excited to hear that Yimou was making another martial arts film.  After the wonderous movie that 'Hero' was, 'House Of Flying Daggers' had to be great, right?

Well, I wouldn't say that 'HOFD' is great.  It is a good movie no doubt, but overall I think it is nowhere near as good as 'Hero'.  When compared to 'Hero', 'HOFD' falls short in just about every aspect:  cinematography, set pieces, costumes, fight scenes, and most importantly:  story.  Its not that the story is bad, but the love story is very shallow.

I don't mean to nitpick the film, but I was just disappointed.  I guess maybe I was expecting too much.  Don't get me wrong though, 'HOFD' is a great film and you should see it but I just don't think it stands up to 'Hero'.  'HOFD' is still better than 99% of the [...] that American companies churn out.",1103500800,,1284,4.372881355932203

2231520,4,B0007Q6VXC,"I have been anticipating ""House of Flying Daggers"" for awhile. I finally had the opportunity to see the film today. The film takes place towards the end of the Tang Dynasty which was slowly crumbling due to corruption. A new revolutionary group called The House of Flying Daggers was about to make an attempt at a takeover. However their plans was cut short when their leader was assasinated. The police thinks that the daughter of the slain leader went into hiding in a local brothel. One of the officers played by Takeshi Kaneshiro (Jin) goes undercover to find the daughter Mei played by ""Hero"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" star Zhang Ziyi and try to get Mei to give him the information about The House of Flying Daggers as they travel to her home. Along the way the plan was to set up some mock ambushes by Jin's partner and his officers for Jin to 'fight' off to make Mei feel safe and that she can confide in him. The trip starts off the way it was planned but what Mei and Jin didn't expect was to fall in love. Nor did they plan on running into the General's army who were ordered to kill on sight. I enjoyed the film immensely. The battle scenes were amazing. I especially loved the battle scenes in the bamboo forest with the General's army. I also enjoyed the opening sequence in the brothel where Jin meets Mei. Unfortunately ""House of Flying Daggers"" is not perfect. Although it is visual eye candy, the storylines was very thin. Not much was said about the revolutionary group The House of Flying Daggers or the main characters' pasts. It would have been nice had more thought would have been put into the storyline just as there was in the visual effects of the film. I must admit that I didn't expect the plot twists towards the end of the film. That made the story a bit more interesting however the plot twists still lack more details on the characters. Nevertheless, I enjoyed ""House of Flying Daggers"" despite the flaws. It is a stunning film. The music was complimented with the beautiful scenery. I really hope in the future that Chinese films in the future will focus more on the storylines than just throwing together a bunch of incredible special effects. That does not make a movie.",1103414400,,2216,4.556390977443609
2231521,5,B0007Q6VXC,"This movie is full of eye popping color, lots of texture, graceful dancing, gorgeous actors, well choreographed sword and dagger fighting.  The bamboo forest scenes are especially cool.  Zhang Ziyi is stunning, graceful, multitalented!  Takeshi Kaneshiro is gorgeous, charming and romantic.  Andy Lau is handsome, strong, tortured.  All three are great action heroes.  Love triangle...awesome fighting scenes, breathtaking scenery and vibrant colors.  Zhang Yimou (director) just keeps getting better and better.  I highly recommend his earlier works including Raise the Red Lantern and Shanghai Triad.  This is my favorite one after Raise the Red Lantern.  A truly wonderful film.  Enjoy!!",1103328000,,690,5.8
2231522,3,B0007Q6VXC,"It's kind of hard to understand how the director of the great Raise the Red Lantern has migrated to CGI-ville.  House of Flying Daggers, just as much as Zhang Yimou's previous film Hero, relies enormously on CGI (computer-generated imagery) to show hundreds or thousands of spears hitting a roof (Hero), or hundreds or thousands of bamboo trunks/branches hurled at two people in a forest (House of Flying Daggers).  And this is only one example among VERY many of CGI utilization in this film. Similarly, every time a dagger is let loose in this film, it immediately becomes a magical object that does supernaturally impossible things, defying belief so much it gets tiring after the first four or five times.

The most creative and gripping use of this CGI technology comes early in the film when the ""heroine"", Mei, posing as a dancer in a brothel, agrees to perform the ""Echo Game"" when she is challenged to do so by the head of the local police precinct, supposedly to avoid arrest.  In this context, the police guy throws pebbles at a semi-circle of large drums, and we watch as the pebble ricochets from one drum to another, finally falling to the floor.  The dancer must duplicate the sonic rhythms the pebble has created against as many drums as it hits.  This is admittedly a beautiful use of CGI because of its imaginative linking of man and nature--pebble against drum; dancer with her extra-long garment sleeves moving in such a way as to hit the drums with the edges of her sleeves, echoing the movement of the pebble.  Truly inspired and absolutely enthralling.

But unfortunately this degree of imagination is not carried through for the rest of the film.  Set in a time when the Chinese empire was weak, hundreds of years ago--this could be anywhere from the 14th to the 18th century--House of Flying Daggers gives us Mei, Jin--supposedly a young, handsome, wealthy playboy, and Leo, the police guy.  None of these three characters is who they appear to be initially.  The eponymous entity is a secret group/society fighting the current corrupt government typified by Leo who is in fact a member of the group itself, as is Mei. Jin is actually a police guy himself, not the rich layabout he initially seems to be.

Relatively soon, this evolves, if that term can be used, into a love story in which all three of the leads converge in a tale of passion, jealousy, and revenge.  It would have been decidedly more intriguing if the layers of misrepresented roles--House of Flying Daggers member, police captain, dancer--had been more carefully thought out and more intricately linked to each other without having to rely on love and jealousy to do so.

As it is, this tried and true method--Hollywoodlike, in fact--of forcing characters to be involved with each other cheapens the story considerably.  This cheapening is made substantially more obvious with the over-utilization of CGI, referred to previously. It's as if the director (who also co-wrote the script) is intentionally acknowledging how much he ""owes"" Hollywood for his success, or even, possibly, his interest in film to begin with.  Hollywood, as we all know, has become one of the giant corporations of not only the US but the world. It's unfortunate when a director from far outside the US who's shown in the past his obvious talent by paying careful attention to the nuances of his native culture downgrades that talent considerably by investing his films with so much splash they smack the viewer in the face--""Hey!!  Look at what I can do with these here nifty special effects!!  Wow, am I great or WHAT?""

The above may sound fuddy duddy, but I urge you, if you have not seen it, to rent or buy (unfortunately, December 2004, still only on VHS, not DVD) Raise the Red Lantern which is one of the best Chinese films ever made.  It is brilliant.

Unfortunately the same cannot be said of House of Flying Daggers.  The three stars are for the brilliant sequence of the Echo Game and for the visually stunning use of color in the film.  But the way over the top use of CGI and the cheapening of the storyline does not make this anywhere near the film it could--and should--have been.",1103328000,,4164,4.768802228412256
2231523,3,B0007Q6VXC,"To be fair, this is not a bad movie considering how many bad movies Hollywood put out there each year.

As a Chinese living in US for 20+ years and someone grew up devoting to Wushia films, this is a good but not outstanding movie.

Certain aspects were distracting:

1. bamboo forest and the other forest don't mix.  They are apparently from two very different regions.  Weird how they traversed between the two like they were next door neighbors....

2. Mei and Jin must be really young to fall so deeply for each other after only 3 days.  Also said the House of Daggers leader, Mei (Zhang Ziyi) had used her beauty for business a few times before.  She's not a spring chicken who had never ventured out of her confine to be a true Juliet (if you must use the Shakespearean connection.....)

3. Once the twist was revealed, Leo(Andy Lau)'s role became very unsympathetic.  He's a classic case of possessive character that stalker/abuser is made of.

House of The Flying Daggers is not a Wushia movie technically because its emphasis on the love story.  Everything, the story structure, fight scenes, visuals, music, and editing, are all in support of the love story.  A true Wushia movie is more about good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, underdog vs. oppressor, or moral vs. greed, much like a classic Western should.

As a love story/melodrama, it is good.

As a Wushia movie, it is not.  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a better representation of the Wushia genre.

Just my two cents....",1102896000,,1488,4.683397683397684
2231524,3,B0007Q6VXC,"Any movie from Director Zhang Yimou is worth adding to your DVD collection, if only to admire his directorial virtuosity and the stunning visual atmosphere he creates. Unfortunately, in THE HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS, Zhang hasn't given us much else to work with. Compared to the complex, multi-layered plot and epic scope of HERO, his latest movie is a pretty trinket, a Harlequin Romance of ripped bodices, longing stares, and star-crossed lovers, loosely wrapped in a story of assassins, traitors, and martial arts exploits.

The story line begins with the search by Leo (Andy Lau, whose Chinese name is pronounced Lee-oh) and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro), members of a vaguely militaristic special forces unit, for a member of the House of Flying Daggers, a group of anti-government assassins. They quickly find their target in Xiao (Little) Mei, a blind brothel dancer played by the gorgeous Zhang Ziyi, the director's newest favorite starlet. A magnificent opening scene called the Echo Game, involving dried beans, drums, acrobatics, and Tang Dynasty dance costumes with long flowing sleeves, foreshadows the martial arts ballets soon to follow. Reminiscent of both HERO and JU DOU, Director Zhang has again managed to incorporate endless bolts of beautiful dyed cloth into his choreographed action.

Leo and Jin stage Mei's escape in the hope she will lead them to the rest of the Flying Daggers and their mysterious leader, Nia. The balance of the movie follows Mei's flight, the unfolding double and even triple identities of most of the characters, and Mei's surprising relationships with Leo and Jin. A movie about mysterious assassins evolves into a tortured and overly melodramatic love triangle in which all three characters behave more like spoiled teenagers than noble warriors. A secondary plot line concerning the impending battle between the seemingly good Flying Daggers and the seemingly evil general and his army falls forgotten by the wayside, despite several references to the importance of the clash for the future of the country.

As usual, Zhang Yimou's use of color and texture are remarkable. The yellows of the leaves, the pink of Mei's sleeves, the whites of the flower field, the greens of the bamboo forest, even the white of Zhang Ziyi's bared shoulders and the red of her lips all nearly fly off the screen. The sounds of Nature are also amplified into a background chorus, almost as if our sense of hearing had been heightened to the level of the blind Mei's. We not only see the green of the bamboo forest, we feel its blade-like leaves through their soft rustling.

In what is essentially a three-person movie, Zhang Ziyi and Takeshi Kaneshiro are reasonably convincing, but Andy Lau seems badly miscast, as if he had just gotten off a plane from Hong Kong. His martial arts persona feels forced, as does his stagy anguish over Mei. His complaints in one scene over the mental torture he has suffered over Mei look like acting from a high school play, and his love scenes with Zhang Ziyi are perfunctory, lacking the fire of Kaneshiro's. Perhaps Lau's performance is just the inevitable result of making eight or ten movies a year.

The movie's final scene is perhaps the most disappointing. A sword fight lasts so long, the brilliant fall colors give way to a windswept blizzard. Zhang Ziyi is forced to play a laughably prolonged death scene in which she rises from eight inches of snow after her presumed death, only to die another slow death to save her true love. In the end, Leo's staggered lurches into the snow-covered distance feel like a metaphor for Director Zhang's recent foray into the martial arts (wuxia) genre. Time to move on.

Despite its shortcomings, THE HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS is entertaining and visually appealing, an interesting accompaniment to HERO and a movie worth owning. Combine it with JU DOU, RAISE THE RED LANTERN, THE ROAD HOME, NOT ONE LESS, THE STORY OF QIU JU, TO LIVE, THE TURANDOT PROJECT, and SHANGHAI TRIAD and you can see the fascinating evolution of mainland China's premier movie-maker, now deservedly becoming a major figure in international cinema.",1102636800,,4127,5.0087463556851315
2231525,3,B0007Q6VXC,"With Zhang Yimou at the helm, Ching Siu-Tung as action director and Takeshi Kaneshiro, Andy Lau, and Zhang Ziyi as the acting talent, ""House of Flying Daggers"" hype has been in full swing since the film premiered in Cannes in May.

""Daggers"" is a splendid visual feast with arty aspirations, but the story requires the viewer to take quite a few leaps of logic.  The action and art design are spellbinding from start to end while the trio of main characters gets a little tired half-way through the film.

Takeshi Kaneshiro (Chungking Express) and Hong Kong superstar Andy Lau (Infernal Affairs) play Tang dynasty policemen Jin and Leo who attempt to use the blind courtesan Mei (Zhang Ziyi) to lead them to her father, the leader of the rebellious House of Flying Daggers.

At the start of one heroically exciting action scene, Jin showcases his accomplished archery by launching a stream of lethal arrows to fell a group of men who try to capture Mei.  Jin  is way too deep undercover here, which makes things interesting.  This morally ambiguous deep-cover subplot could have been explored more thoroughly. Instead, however, several surprise plot twists arise that have more potential to induce laughter than to elevate the film to new heights.

A certain degree of excitement boils up and then simmers down only to leave a deflated melodramatic love triangle as a result.

As Zhang Yimou's second foray into the 'wuxia' or martial chivalry genre of Chinese film, ""Daggers"" is a colorfully audacious follow-up to ""Hero"" however some fans of Zhang may see  it as vapid in light of his earlier body of work.  The glum plight of commoners and village folk that Mr. Zhang's fans have grown accustomed to from such works as his ""The Road Home"" and ""The Story of Qiu Ju"" is replaced here with CGI airborne daggers that appear to have minds of their own.

Overall, the movie is worth seeing if you are curious about it.  A good and entertaining film despite its flaws.",1102550400,,1964,4.792284866468843
2231526,4,B0007Q6VXC,"HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS is one of those movies that, if you sit in the front row and are high on a controlled substance, the visual presentation will go from being simply spectacular to ""Far out, dude!"" (Just so you know, I was in the theater balcony and cold sober.)

The film is set in pre-communist China when the weapon of choice remains the sword. At this time, the ""establishment"" is threatened by the House of Flying Daggers, an organization of outlaws ostensibly dedicated to robbing from the rich and giving to the poor - an Asiatic version of Robin Hood's Band of Merry Men. Two police officers, Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and Leo (Andy Lau), discover one whom they suspect of being the blind daughter of the House's recently assassinated leader working as a dancer in a local brothel. Jin and Leo concoct an elaborate Good Cop-Bad Cop routine whereby the girl, Mei (Ziyi Zhang), is arrested, interrogated, threatened with torture, rescued, and returned safely to the House's hidden, rural base. Jin  plays the role of the dashing rescuer while Leo follows the ""fleeing"" pair with troops. Mei being one hot babe, Leo warns Jin, a self-proclaimed Lothario, not to take his role too seriously.

The stunning countryside in which this film was photographed is presumably China. When, at one point, Mei and Jin are menaced by attackers vaulting through the topmost branches of an achingly green bamboo forest chucking spears, I thought, ""This isn't Kansas."" (I also thought, ""With perfectly good ground to walk upon, why have they taken to the treetops?"" But, that's the curmudgeon in me speaking.)

HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS is essentially an extravagant visual feast, with gorgeous costuming and seamlessly choreographed martial arts sequences, that could almost be appreciated without the English subtitles. Almost. However, a rudimentary plot remains, admittedly with some good twists, but which ends in a deadly duel between two combatants that so protractedly milked the scene for every last drop of cheap melodrama that my wife and I were reduced to snickers and a rolling of the eyes. So, four stars instead of five.",1102377600,,2125,5.0113314447592066
2231527,5,B0007Q6VXC,"Perhaps the best genre offering from China since the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" [and arguably better], ""House of Flying Daggers"" is based in the China of 854 AD.  Although the cast is very large only a handful of players have speaking roles and most of those are relegated to the three main antagonists.

This is a beautifully filmed movie that makes Kurasowa's Ran look like an also ran. Filmed in China and the forests of Ukraine, director Yimou Zhang makes vivid use of his landscapes and drapes the film in strong primary colors. The fight scenes are well choreographed and are almost ballet-like in their presentation.  They easily match or exceed ""Crouching Tiger"" for sheer effect. The result is that the cinematography and choreography become a part of this great film.

The opening scenes set the stage for the characters complete with a great scene where Mei [Ziya Zhang playing the role of a blind dancer] performs the ""echo dance"" for the local garrison's captain Leo. Mei is suspected of being a member of the House of Flying Daggers, an insurgent group and Leo plots with his lieutenant [Jin] to take her back to the groups location. But all is not what it seems and the plot takes a few twists. At the heart of this is a love story, where love drives the character changes. It's also a tragedy as the lives of those involved are affected deeply by forces out of their control.

""House of Flying Daggers"" is filmmaking of the best kind. There's something almost mythical in its quality and I found it to be emotional story telling of the best kind. It's almost unbelievable that this film doesn't appeal to everyone, but I found it one of the best I've seen in ages. Highly recommended.",1102118400,,1706,4.6923076923076925
2231528,3,B0007Q6VXC,"Reminiscient of ""Hero"", director Zhang YiMou's other film that came out in the states this year, The House of Flying Daggers was beautiful visually, martial arts twisted with a sappy romance, and in the end a letdown to what it had promised. This time Zhang and his team of writers focus on a love triangle and an organization of bandits called ""The House of Flying Daggers"" set in the Tang Dynasty's last few years. Traitors of the emperor, the group is sought out by police captains Leo(Andy Lau) and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro). When news that a beautiful blind courtesan named Mei(Zhang ZiYi) may be part of the group reaches the police, Jin is told to disguise himself as ""Wind"", a warrior sympathetic to the cause of the group and hopefully find the leader of the bandits. Mei and Wind go off into the forest under constant pressure from their pursuers including Leo. (The best battle scene of the movie was the battle in the bambo forest. For once the flying people and falling trees seemed to all mesh together) What was to be an innocent mission for Jin becomes more and more difficult as he and Mei begin to fall for eachother. Unfortunately Jin isn't the only one that has secrets to hide. A secret trap had been set long before. Will love be able to conquer it or will tradegy follow?

The House of Flying Daggers is basically a movie that centers on everybody not being who he or she intially seems. Unfortunately it was really obvious how the story was going to go. The two leads, Lau and Kaneshiro provide plenty of eye candy but none of the twos performances were spetacular. Their last battle in the snow was one that totally defied the odds and seems a cheap way to end a movie that promised so much leading up to the climax, which felt like a real letdown.

Zhang ZiYi, who previously starred in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero, gave a respectful performance. Her dance in the beginning with flying sleeves was beautifully coerographed and was quite majestic. Unfortunately she suffers the same fate as the two male actors in the end, where the storyline was just such a letdown. In the end you wonder, how many times can a person get hit before they die? The audience realizes its a movie, but how far can a normal human defy the odds?

The movie artistic side in the end saves it from a very lackluster storyline that had so much promise in the beginning but was flat at the end. I was left wondering what the whole point of the movie was. Like ""Hero"", Zhang's attempt at mixing romance and action just didn't quite click. However if you enjoyed the visual beauty of Hero, this movie is not one to miss. If you like action, think twice since Hero definitely had the better action. In the end, there was just too much eye candy and not enough story.",1102032000,,2773,4.5199203187251
2231529,5,B0007Q6VXC,"The House of Flying Daggers is a ""cloak and dagger"" organization that rejects the current leadership of the country as they struggle to remove the current leader.  This organization finds support through the small communities as they rob the rich and give large sums to the needy.  These attacks have been rather interruptive for the Tang Dynasty, which has led the Tang Dynasty to set out to kill the leader.  However, the House of Flying Daggers has rebounded and found themselves a new leader, and now the Tang's want to eliminate the new leader of the ""cloak and dagger"" organization.

The police officers, Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and Leo (Andy Lau), in a small province of China having found leads that indicate that a new woman in the local brothel works for the House of Flying Daggers.  Jin and Leo infiltrate the brothel and quickly draw out the suspected member of the House of Flying Daggers, but to their astonishment she appears to be blind.  This happens to be a big break for the two police officers as Jin recalls that the former leader of the House of Flying Daggers had a daughter that was blind.  The two officers decide to capitalize on the situation as they find a way to free her, which they hope will lead them to the leader of the House of Flying Daggers.

Jin begins to work undercover as a free spirited traveler that breaks into the prison in order to help free the blind girl, Mei (Zhang Ziyi).  Together Jin and Mei escape the jail to begin on their journey north to the House of Daggers.  What Jin does not expect is that he would fall in love with the blind Mei, which leads the story into a new adventure as the General has sent out more troops to follow Jin and Mei.  This love story becomes more complicated as Jin struggles with his deceit towards Mei as he tries to uncover the identity of the leader of House of the Flying Daggers.

Initially, the story seems to be a clever love story with deceit and war in the backdrop.  However, as the story unfolds the audience soon realizes that things are not always as they seem.  The political undercurrents play a larger role in the story as one wants to believe and film becomes intentionally more complex.  The complexity of the tale lends support the notion that love is not always as simple as falling in love, which is evident in the end of the film.  This notion is also supported by the use of the brilliant cinematography, mise-en-scene, and the kaleidoscope of colors.  In the end when all the aspects of film making are put together the audience will has experienced a terrific cinematic experience that will provide a little of everything including much to reflect upon.",1101859200,,2662,4.582278481012659
2231530,3,B0007Q6VXC,"Let me first say that I am a huge fan of Zhang Yimou and Chinese cinema, and I really wanted to enjoy this film.  My expectations were very guarded, given the mixed reviews.  I have no bias in the whole China/Taiwan/Hong Kong rivalry; I'm just a regular American who enjoys good movies.

That said, Shi Mian Mai Fu was probably the worst film Zhang Yimou has ever made.  I really expected it to be better than Hero but it didn't even reach that level.  It reminded me of a lot of Shekar Kapur's Four Feathers, a film from a director whom I really admire that unfortunately was largely devoid of substance.

What went wrong here?  For starters, there is basically no plot.  The story is as aimless and vacuous as a typical Hollywood film.  The actors are equally lacking in substance: Zhang Ziyi is a star but she's no Gong Li.  Andy Lao is a bore.  And I'm sorry, but Takeshi Kaneshiro may speak better Mandarin than Chow Yun Fat, but to me he will always be the geekish mute from Chungking Express.  He has no gravitas.  This is essentially a love story, but there's little onscreen electricity between the lovers.  The film's much heralded visual brilliance is vastly overrated.  The early dance scenes were nice, but the sets looked stagy and did not realistically convey the time and place of the setting.  From there the rest of the film is spent over a couple of acres of a Ukrainian forest.  The whole thing felt confined and unnatural.  Even the flashy Korean action film Musa made fuller use of its thin historic pretext and setting. The soldiers' costumes look like they were prepared for the old Star Trek TV show.  Finally, some of the fight scenes felt so stagy they looked like choreographed dance numbers.  I was half waiting for Paula Abdul to jump out.

In sum, House of Flying Daggers was a bore.  If you want to see the best Asian film of 2004, I suggest you go see the Korean War drama Tae Guk Gi.  It may end corny, but it never felt like such a colossal waste of time.",1100563200,,1990,4.43646408839779

Review:

A meaningful plot is pretty much non-existent in this movie, and it's a bit confusing in the beginning (e.g., the brothel sequence with lots and lots of colors and hues), but after the first 15-20 minutes, you start sort of getting the picture (no pun intended).  Two policemen killed the leader of a powerful gang called the House of the Flying Daggers a couple years ago and are fearful that the remnants of the gang will seek revenge.  A game of deceit thus begins.

Although the script is drab (with silly teenagerish dialogs at times), the production is gorgeous.  Ok, the use of the bamboo forest is a bit trite and something of an overkill, but the cinematography is nonetheless beautiful and mesmerizing.  I watched the movie on a Hong Kong-released DVD on my LCD TV and, despite the subpar transfer quality of the DVD, everthing just looks breathtaking on the screen.  I especially like the fight sequence in the open field in the middle of the film, for it's simple and furious out in an open and vast environment.  But the earlier forest battle scenes are also top-notch, almost looking non-choreographed.  The actress ZHANG Ziyi has some impressive kung-fu moves in the film, although in a few places it's obvious it's a body-double performing some of the more dangerous stunts.  The two male leads are ok; Japanese-Chinese heartthrob Kaneshiro looks too serious and theatrical, while Hong Kong megastar Lau gives a somewhat muted and unbelievable performance.  Zhang is no doubt the shining star here, from beginning to end.  (SPOILER!!!  But, alas, through no fault of Zhang's own, her character Mei just takes too long to die in the end.)

The film is well-shot and well-edited, with terrific visual treats for the audience.  It's a movie experience not to missed.  If Kurosawa's ""Ran"" uses colors to emphasize rawness and savagery, ZHANG Yimou's present film employs colors to intertwine graceful violence and treacherous romance.",1098144000,,2036,4.958702064896755
2231532,3,B0007Q6VXC,"FIRST, A NOTE TO THE UNINITIATED:
Please note that this is a Wuxia film. ""Wuxia"" is a fullblown genre in itself (google is your friend) and an inspiration for many Hollywood big tykes including Tarantino. So the implausible antics that have supposedly tickled many of the stock amateur reviewers on this site were in fact meant to be precisely that way -- make-believe, superhuman, artistically awe-inspiring, a celebration of possibilities. (I mean, what, you thought Santa and Spiderman were not?)

SECOND, A NOTE TO FOLKS IN THE FAR EAST:
The film may be going by a different name in your country, in my case, the somewhat sophomoric one: ""Lovers"".

NOW ON TO MY REVIEW:
The short story is that House of Flying Daggers packs all the visual punches that masterpieces of Ang Lee or Kurosawa do, but despite its good looks, it ultimately stumbles in emotional heft.

We click off with a dance sequence that has a fascinatingly creative use of nuts in what I believe is the best choreographed courtroom dance I've seen in a while, in the vein of Bollywood's grandiloquent mastery of alignment, sync and pacing.

The martial arts department doesn't disappoint throughout. The combat montage at the end is a sight to behold while seasons change in the backdrop, as is a silky battle in a bamboo forest.

Zhang Ziyi, needless to say, is stunning. We see much more of her here (not in a literal sense, sorry to disappoint you voyeurs in the back) than in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Matter of fact, all screen time is triangulated between the three protagonists with a couple of twists thrown in.

All of which is super, but the problem is that the movie never quite reaches the emotional pitch that it spends so much time setting up. The romance is confusing at best; after ricocheting incessantly between the two guys, our girl basically ends up shot in the heart while the dumbos duel it out unto eternity.

Which leads me to the conclusion that House of Flying Daggers is just one big set piece after the next of dodging arrows and stopping swords with fingertips. While it's told with cinematic grace, it's sad when you realize that all that beauty was to make up for the lack of anything meaningful at its heart.",1097798400,,2216,4.725388601036269
2231533,3,B0007Q6VXC,"I saw this movie on my trip to china over the summer.  I read an article in the newspaper, and it got horrible review over there for many reasons.  I won't give away the ending, but i know that myself, and the rest of the audience had a good laugh at it when it should have been dramatic and anything but funny.  I have to say that i cant rate this movie on its entirety because when i saw it it was in chinese with chiense subtitles, and my knowledge of both is extremely limited, so i won't give it lower then a three for that reason.  If you are looking for fight scenes, then this movie is great, but don't expect a real tear jerker, its just too funny.",1097366400,,657,4.030769230769231
2231534,5,B0007Q6VXC,"Soon following the success of 'Hero,' director Yimou Zhang made another film featuring beautiful Zhang Ziyi.  One of the good news for Zhang Ziyi fans (including me) is that 'House of Flying Daggers' features her almost all through the film.  And this time director's stress is clearly given to the romantic side of the story -- and as if to match his intention, 'House' looks more beautiful, colorful, and gorgeous, than 'Hero.'  And there are actions, and some of them are quite unique.

The film is set in 859 AD, last days of the now corrupt Tang Dynasty in China.  One underground sect called House of Flying Daggers are openly challenging the authority of the government, and to crush these rebels, two officers Jin -- also known 'The Wind' (Takeshi Kaneshiro, 'Chunking Express') and Leo (Andy Lau, 'Infernal Affairs') think of a good plan.

Jin goes to meet a blind courtesan Mei (Zhang Ziyi), who is suspected to be connected with the secret clan, and he gains the confidence of this beautiful dancer by some tricks -- tricks meaning 'love.'  Make her love you, and you get her secret.  Hopefully she will lead Jin to the hiding place of the 'House of Flying Daggers,' but before the plan starts, Leo warns Jin: 'Don't fall in love for real.'  But who can resist Mei's beauty?  Or Zhang Ziyi's for that matter?

The rest of the story is very melodramatic, and the film sometimes needs a good amount of suspension of disbelief (especially for Western audiences, I'm afraid).  But, though melodramatic, it is aptly so, as this is basically about a romance, or a love story.  Those who love the romantic mood in films would understand what I say.  It's all about the tension and mood, and 'House' has lots of them.

Actions are done by Tony Ching Siu-Tung, whose CV includes the action director of 'A Chinese Ghost Story.'  He gives superb  martial arts actions here again, without using too much of now-too-trendy wire actions.  As the film title shows, there are some effectively shot scenes of 'flying daggers' which, with a good use of CGIs, gives a few of thrilling moments.  And like I said before, the battles in the midst of a deep bamboo forest are not to be missed, if you are a real Hong-Kong film fan.

Costumes are provided by Emi Wada (as in 'Hero'), whose colorful dresses are just wonderful.  Particlularly those long-sleeved dancing costumes for Zhang Ziyi not merely enhance the exotic beauty of the dancer, but things to be treasured on their own merit.  And Kathleen Battle sings the theme song at the end of the film.

But first and foremost, to me, the film is made for Zhang Ziyi.  Did I say she is beautiful?  She is, and breathtakingly so, when her character betrays her hidden emotions before the camera.  And sometimes the film reveals the character's very sensual side -- I say, for a Chinese film, of course, but it was a little surprising.

Of course, top-credited Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro are the stars, and they are very good.  The film is always beautiful to see, from the first to the end (the snow field was shot in Ukraine).  And if you're a fan of Zhang Ziyi, this one is not to be missed for it's not too much to say that it belongs to her.",1097107200,,3190,4.59646017699115
2231535,4,B0007Q6VXC,"That is the literal translation of the title. This is Zhang Yimou's sophomore effort in the ""wuxia"" genre, or quite simply the swordplay fantasy genre. His first effort was the recent US hit ""Hero"" which took almost forever to reach the mainstream audience, whereas the rest of the world had seen it since 2002.

This time, the thematic elements are smaller in scale and less epic. There is no nationalistic soliloquys nor lamentations about personal sacrifice. Instead, what we get is a straight forward romantic thriller under the guise of a period action epic.

The period setting, Tang Dynasty (859 A.D.) adds to the Oriental exoticness that Western audiences crave for. Even though there's nothing new for the Asian audiences here, but the action sequences are quite exquisite. There are still a fair amount of wire-fu, but not ""bullet time"" like as in ""Hero"". The only CG enhancement I find that is an improvement over the rest of the earlier ""wuxia"" movies are the tracking shots of the daggers flying spiralling towards their targets.

The cinematography here is spectacular. Zhang has obviously drawn on his previous experience of being a cinematographer himself and experimented with the different colours of the seasons to set the mood and atmosphere to the story. The various wavering fields and snow adds to the aura of romance and intrigue.

For a jaded ""wuxia"" movier-goer like me, ""House of Flying Daggers"" is nothing special. There are far better ones out there like, ""Dragon Inn"", ""Touch of Zen"", ""Swordsman"", etc. However, for something completely different from the mundane offerings of Hollywood, this movie would provide a refreshing relief.",1096934400,,1663,5.125461254612546

2231537,4,B0007Q6VXC,"This film brings the genre to new heights. Beautifully choreagraphed fight scenes. Cinematography is spectacular, and serves to very effectively highlight the action as well as the stunning scenery. A visual feast!! The last fight scene treats the viewer with great visuals; opens in the countryside with all the beautiful hues of fall and then it begins to snow. As the two male characters continue their fight, the snow begins to envelope the scenery and the senses. Spectacular! American audiences will most likely find some of the scenes between the main female character and her male counter-parts a bit melodramatic, as is her final scene in the film (audiences in Toronto at the film festival actually laughed out loud). But this is very typical of Asian films and should be taken with a grain of salt. Despite this, this film is a treat both visually, story line and action. Makes Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon pale in comparison. Highly recommend to those who enjoy this genre.",1096416000,,987,4.987878787878788
