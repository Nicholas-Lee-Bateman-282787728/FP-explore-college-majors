1045206,3,6305554420,"While it is nice to have such a beautiful, shining representation of Shakespeare's very fine comedy, A Midsummer Night's Dream is not really a beautiful, shining play. Rife with frustration, jealousy, ugly spats  between furious couples, and a general impression that these fairies are  not the lovey-dovey creatures they ought to be, this version of the play is  a little too sweet for my tastes. Despite all of the praise she's gotten,  Calista Flockhart gives a poor performance of a wonderful role. Kevin  Kline's Bottom, who is quiet, self-pitying, and generally sorry, is one of  the biggest midreadings of a Shakespeare part in a long, long time. The  redeeming acting job comes from a Rupert Everett as a dark, hungry,  gorgeous Oberon. The play within a play is funny and cute, but there's a  lot of potential that's not taken advantage of. In short, the movie is a  lovely rendition of Shakespeare's best comedy, but underneath the film's  attractive surface is a total void; it lacks madness, joy, or the intense  darkness that makes the play so wonderful.",949536000,14,1067,4.932584269662922
1045207,5,6305554420,"I've always had trouble understanding the words in Shakespeare performances, and found the text alone too boring to read straight up. But watching this on DVD with subtitles was fantastic! I could finally follow  everything that happened in the story, all the dialog! The DVD format is  extremely easy to pause and rewind as well, for the trickier scenes.
I  hope more Shakespeare performances make in onto DVD. This is really the  ideal format, although this particular DVD would have been better if  contained additional material beyond the performance video, such as  footnoted annotations from a Shakespeare scholar, and notes about what  parts were edited. (I suspect this is an abridged version of the play,  although I'm no scholar).",949104000,2,740,5.159663865546219
1045208,4,6305554420,"It is obvious the director had Max Rheinhardt's kitschy production from the 1930's in mind and attempted to outdo him. (Women wrestling in mud is going a bit too far!)The film also has strange casting with Stanley Tucci  as Puck and Kevin Kline as Bottom. These actors should have switched roles.  Bottom as a pathetic character robs the play of much of its comedy. The  rest of the cast are superb. The young lovers are suitably attractive and  Rupert Everett and Michelle Pfieffer are gorgeous as Oberon and Titania. I  don't why why someone was credited with composing music since Mendlessohn,  Verdi, Donizetti, Bellini, and Mascagni supplied the tunes. I liked that  however as they added additional lushness to an already lush production and  added to the fun. Casting and directing errors aside the film nevertheless  holds one's interest.",947203200,,846,5.028776978417266
1045209,5,6305554420,"As an English teacher and somewhat of a Shakespeare purist, I hesitated going to the theater to see  Midsummer Night's Dream, but oh ""what fools these mortals be.""  MSND has always been my favorite of the  comedies, and this production makes me remember why.  Even though the  language is kept ""pure,"" the actors brought the characters to  life - especially Kline with his role of Bottom.  This movie is a great way  to allow all people to have access to such a wonderful play.",944870400,5,477,4.595238095238095
1045210,5,6305554420,"When I went to the cinema to watch this film, I knew very well that it's fabulous and I want to buy it's DVD and keep it forever. Any time you feel down you can watch this film and join the world of spirits. That's what I  love.",944784000,,228,3.75
1045211,1,6305554420,"Oh no! They speak Olde Englishe. Therefore, I don't get the dialogues and barely understand what's going on. Only that it's some love confusion intrigue nonsense by that Shakespeare guy again, moved forward to the turn  of the century (not millennium).
It all is very dream-related and  incredibly beautifully done. Kevin Kline plays his part well, and Anna  Friel is sweet in A Midsummer Night's Dream - But that's all I want to  grant this movie a star for.
Apart from that, stay away from the movie  unless you need it to score.",944352000,2,531,4.666666666666667
1045212,5,6305554420,"This film was one of the best adaptions of Shakespearean play I have ever seen.  It was a treat for the eyes and ears.  The sets, lighting, effects, and oh yeah, the ACTING were fabulous.  I walked out of the theater and  could only think, ""I can't wait for it to come on video!""
Now  it's coming out soon and I am very excited!  In summary, I'd have to say  this movie is a must-see for everyone, not just Shakespeare fans!",938822400,3,424,4.160493827160494

1045421,5,6305554420,Love this classic Shakespearian play told in the most beautifully adapted way.  Great cast and wonderful cinematography and costuming to bring this fantastic comedy to life.,1479254400,,173,5.653846153846154
1045452,5,6305554420,Kevin Kline as Bottom is just as entertaining as Jimmy Cagney's a thousand years prior. There really is no comparison because as you know Shaespeare is an evolving allegory as it is acted contemporaneously. I would have casted Bill Murray as Oberon but Rupert Everrett gives a fine performance. The theatrics and stagecraft cannot be improved on in my opinion. This is a very entertaining wonderful production you'll want to see more than twice.,1478649600,,445,5.027027027027027
1045453,2,6305554420,"A far interpretation of Midsummer Night, and almost ideal for kids to watch if not for the copious nudity/near nudity, which really did nothing at all to advance the story narrative. The performances are all fine, although I can't watch Bill Irwin without hearing Elmo's shrill voice saying ""that's not how you act like a wall, Mister Noodle!""

The cheesiness and goofy special effects and corny makeup undermine the actor's performances, particularly those of Kevin Kline who really seems like the star of this. Otherwise there's far too much skin (and too much sleeping, which I don't recall that much of from Shakespeare's original play)",1477612800,,640,5.095238095238095
1045454,5,6305554420,"Excellent version of an old, classic piece of literature. Nice directing, acting, etc. and very amusing and entertaining, to those who appreciate theater and theatrical art. Very worth watching, at least once or twice on your life.",1473638400,,231,5.27027027027027
1045455,4,6305554420,I enjoyed the humor and fun that was put into this productions of A Midsummer Night's Dream.  Seeing familiar faces portraying the characters was more enjoyable to watch and it looked like they had a lot of fun acting out this familiar play.,1472342400,,241,4.604651162790698

1045768,5,6305554420,"I love this version of Midsummer Night's Dream...I previewed every version I could find on Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube and this is by far the best. First of all, Hermia and Helena have to be young and beautiful and Lysander and Demitrius have to be young and handsome...so how can you have a version when the lead actresses appear to be in their 30s or older...women got married young back then so it is ridiculous to even cast such actresses in the lead roles. In this version Hermia and Helena are indeed young and beautiful and Lysander and Demetrius are young and exceedingly handsome. The acting is very believable and unaffected...unlike acting done in movies by actors who are used to being on a stage and projecting their lines. The sets are amazing, the scenery breathtaking, the music moving and beautiful, and all the filming and lighting is gorgeous. It's a gorgeous movie overall and I really don't understand those who take issue with the points where it deviates from the original script...I felt it stayed extremely true to the spirit of the original play and included all the best lines from it...in no case was there modern language...it is Shakespearian language throughout, simplified a little bit at times when the meaning would have been obscured to most viewers. Michelle Phieffer is stunning as usual but absolutely radiant as the fairy queen Titania and the Puck in this version is amazing...just the right balance between mischievousness and good cheer. And Kevin Kline is absolutely brilliant as Bottom and his donkey get-up was the most believable and organic of all the other attempts to turn a man into a donkey. In short: bravo!!!",1439510400,,1662,4.897163120567376
1045769,2,6305554420,"I want to like any film with Kevin Kline in it, but having taught Shakespeare for 24 years and seen many stage productions of MND, including a
fine one last month at the Will Geer in Topanga, I have to say this version is bland at best, as my students immediately saw. In particular, Sophie Marceau's Hippolyta contained no hint of her character's Amazon Queen background, and Stanley Tucci's Puck totally lacked the physicality that makes this role a coveted one. I fault the direction. Where is the magic?  This play should be one of the easiest film adaptations of Shakespeare, but this effort falls flat.",1439424000,3,608,4.735849056603773

Yes, they take liberty with the text by omitting certain lines, but truly, if they included them the already two hour movie would probably be closer to three/three and a half and might lull the audience to sleep.

1045982,4,6305554420,"Good day to all. An thou wilt give me your attention, whilst I speak on this.
A midsummer nights dream is one of mine favorite Shakespeare comedic plays. The concept of higher power eavesdropping tis a jest. Michael Hoffmans A Midsummer Nights Dream portrays that faithfully. But as they doth put on a good show of his play concerning lines and maj'r plot themes, and scenes, 'twas as if they ta'en what was in script, what was on paper and put it on screen. Methinks all characters portrayed, except one, were flat.
Calista Flockhart as Helena was specially vexing.
t hath seemd the lady  wenteth about yelling and screaming and crying whenevr the lady hath felt like t whilst dragging a bike wherevr the lady wenteth, bringing nothing to the character.  Stanley Tucci, who I dearly love as a player, hath brought nothing to mine highest in favor character Puck. Methinks Puck hath been played two or three ways. Daring and mischievous, excit'ment and somewhat joyous, or dark. Stanley went feelin sanguine and somewhat joyous, which on the surface wast fine, but was not in good favor.
T may be twas cause the writer of plays divid a gross amount of Pucks marvelous lines or a players choice t  didst not accomplish mine spirit.
the one character whod a bit more depth and life was surprisingly nick bottom play'd by kevin kline.
The one character that no one very much payeth any attention to wast the one with actual life. The decision to has't the players and Bottom going ov'r whos playing who with Bottom going on about how that gent can playeth any role wast priceless.
Methinks on pap'r, Bottom hath seemd arrogant, one who is too full of himself , but at which hour the kids,, during this scene poor red wine all ov'r Bottom in which people start to chuckle thee see that gent is a player wanting to be successful and doth what that gent truly loves.
that gent goeth home to his wife and thee see the lady is done with his crazy dreams. Thy wonder if 't be true Hoffman wantd Nick Bottom to be like what some would imagine Shakespeare to be like.  that gent lookd coequal similar to Shakespeare,  we all knoweth the most wondrous Bard didst struggle as a player and playwright for a time. Kline hath brought a new life to Bottom I do not bethink I have seen and twas most wondrous.

Instead, although I had to do a fair amount of overlooking (which the producer could rightly call professorial quibbling), my experience ended with a positive attitude, pleased that I had bought the DVD.

1046231,4,6305554420,"I love this film adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream!  Strong performances from Kevin Kline, Stanley Tucci, and others help to temper not-so-fine performances from others.  I like Dominic West as Lysander.  This film is visually STUNNING and combined with the gorgeous soundtrack of fine, well-known classical pieces, I consider this film to truly be a ""dream.""  It transports the willing viewer into the beautiful world it depicts.",1401667200,,436,5.367647058823529

1046298,4,6305554420,"At times this well well-adapted romantic comedy moves a little too slowly, but overall it is light, fun, and carefree.

1046300,5,6305554420,"This film is the latter and is none the worse for that.  While much has been made of the Hollywood stars in this version, they are almost universally all engaging performances.  Of note are the performances of Kevin Kline, Rupert Everett, Stanley Tucci, Michelle Pfeiffer, and David Strathairn.  The rude mechanicals are all spot on, with a performance of ""Pyramus and Thisbe"" that manages to be funny, cringe-worthy, and poignant.

Liberties with the text are taken, but unedited Shakespeare on film can be tedious. The director and actors all understand the importance of puns in this play, and they are all executed faithfully.

Buy this DVD.  It is a joy.  If only it was available on Bluray.",1398556800,,696,4.897435897435898

1046303,5,6305554420,"I love the scenery, the costumes, the actors, everything. Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful as Queen Titania. The role calls for a great beauty who is NOT an ing&eacute;nue yet possesses the ethereal quality of a fairy. Who else but Ms. Pfeiffer could do that. And Kevin Kline makes Bottom funny, bombastic yet sad and sympathetic. The character can too easily become a caricature but not for Mr. Kline. I could go on singing the praises of this movie for many paragraphs but will end by simply saying this is one of the most perfect adaptations of Shakespeare on film that I know.",1395705600,9,578,4.676470588235294

1046305,4,6305554420,"Kevin Kline is so funny that his performance made me cry from laughing so hard, especially the scene where he performs the play Pyramus and Thisbe. His death seen was hysterical. I watched this movie because I had to write a college paper analyzing the character of Nick Bottom in the movie and compare it to reading the Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's dream. While there were obvious differences, the plot remained the same. However, Kevin Kline's character was very true to Shakespeare's character, and he added so much dimension to the character. I enjoyed this production very much  and recommend it.",1394668800,,611,4.990196078431373

I teach this play to middle school students, so they enjoyed watching some of the scenes from this version of Shakespeare's comedy and discussing why the director made some of the artistic choices.  Stanley Tucci and Kevin Kline as Puck and Bottom are absolutely amazing.",1393891200,,416,5.17910447761194
1046339,3,6305554420,"I recently took a course on William Shakespeare's comedies and not being familiar with these plays, thought I would purchase this movie to give me an idea of this story.  The film plays very well in color on the DVD played in a Blu-ray player on a 1080 P screen.  The scenic beautiful and magical  Italian countryside could not have been far more enhanced in Technicolor.  Here is wondrous photography with outstanding scenic cinematography.

Here we have Englishmen playing Italians written by and Englishman.  Stanley Tucci is the real deal.  I have never had a liking for Calista Flockhart, here is a delight; nor for Michelle Pfeiffer who is gorgeous in the film. Kevin Kline provides a fabulous performance.  But for the life of me where is the comedy?  I think not.

This film did not provided me with an inner appreciation with the course on Shakespeare.",1393113600,,861,4.795918367346939

1046344,4,6305554420,"The setting change to the Gay Nineties on a beautiful Greek (actually Italian, I think) estate is appealing and does no particular harm to Shakespeare's work.  The whole thing is visually beautiful.  Michele Pfeiffer is a complete surprise as she does a masterful job of Titania's long speeches and looks truly lovely.  Oberon is also very good, healthy-looking with a velvety speaking voice, but no depth.  I assume those in authority wanted to give Kevin Kline a wider range to act, so Bottom is given a sad clown back story and an angry wife chasing him through the town.  Stuff that is supposed to be funny is poignant instead.  The lovers are pretty good.  Calista Flockhart does her best in spite of being miscast.  One scene pivots on the fact that she is a tall blond which, of course, she is not.  The pace and acting are very good and it is very enjoyable. Purists will dislike the wide variation in accents from Sophie Marceau's French to Anna Friel's almost Cockney overtones and American here and there.  In spite of all that it is a very good movie with some interesting effects, and great musical and visual beauty.",1389657600,,1130,4.661616161616162

It was very well done, including everything from the phenomenal cast to the setting and accuracy in closeness to much earlier versions. The clarity was remarkable and I was hooked from the very beginning. This version was much more interesting than prior ones I have seen. I absolutely loved it!",1386633600,,370,5.183333333333334
1046389,4,6305554420,"A 1999 adaptation of A Midsummer Nights Dream by Michael Hoffman is a fine and entertaining movie. But, as any other adaptations of the play, it misinterprets the main point of the plot: the Bottoms encounter with Titania. Somehow, the theater and movie directors insist on having a sexual intercourse between this half-beast and the Queen of the fairies. This is definitively not so. Shakespeares plays contain plenty of such traps that may entice various interpretations driven by conditioned thinking or personal preferences. At the same time, however, Shakespeare always specifies the intended meaning. In this case it is Titanias comment that clarifies the situation:

The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
Lamenting some enforced chastity.

Titania points out that at this very moment the watery moon enforces chastity. As a matter of fact, the chastity enforced upon Titania is the most remarkable moment in the entire canon of Shakespeares plays. It is this enforced chastity that symbolically demonstrates the achieved progress. There are no more corrupted demigods or demigoddesses acting as the prime movers of human destiny. Now, it is a highly developed man who supervises the process. A sexual encounter between Titania and Bottom would bring the process back to the ancient times when demigods and demigoddesses were interfering into human affairs. Symbolically, it would nullify the evolutionary progress achieved over the time period of several spiritual millennia. So, the movie is entertaining, but the Bards message is lost.",1386201600,,1596,5.38
1046390,4,6305554420,"The cast of great actors helps to make this movie worth watching.  Kevin Kline and Michelle Pfieffer are especially good.  Stanley Tucci is an adorable Puck.  The costumes and settings are beautiful and really exude the fairy-like feeling of this whimsical tale.  Did not give it 5 stars because I found it a little slow in the middle, but the play given by the four male townsfolk is very funny.",1386201600,,396,4.614285714285714

1046425,1,6305554420,"I'm not a purist, but A Midsummer Night's Dream is supposed to be a rip-roaring comedy.  This movie took all the funny bits and made them melancholy and sad.  While it generally has a lush (i.e., Much Ado About Nothing rip-off) look to it, the fairies were a major disappointment.  They weren't magical, but rather looked like a bunch of science fiction/fantasy fans whose costumes weren't up to snuff. Since Shakespeare's dialog wasn't funny in the mouths of the actors, the director added slapstick sight gags (wine poured on a white suit, ladies wresting in mud in their underwear).  Even that wasn't particularly funny, as Kevin Kline's expressive face let the viewer know how hurt he was by the incident--again giving the film a melancholy feel. I have twins in first grade that I wanted to introduce to Shakespeare.  We read ""Bard of Avon"", and Bruce Coville's ""Midsummer Night's Dream), and followed this with the 1935 B&W film version of the play.  This much older version is incredibly magical and very funny (James Cagney gives a wonderful performance as Bottom).  Once they quit asking when the color would start, my kids enjoyed it and were laughing their heads off at the end.  Sorry, but the Kevin Kline/Michelle Pfeiffer version doesnt' do it. I can't believe that no one can improve on a 1935 version.",1384300800,3,1317,4.848214285714286

The acting was over acted and was over the top.  I did not really enjoy it.  However ANY movie with Michelle Pfeiffer can't be all bad.  She is truly a classical beauty and I have been smitten with her since her start.

The stilted arcane Shakespearian English and the actors always speaking in ryhme just did not do it for me. I only gave it a 3 because of Ms Pfeiffer.",1379721600,,542,4.223300970873787

I doubt a movie shot in the 1930's (the one most people seem to revere) would capture high-school students' attention as well as this more modern version does. It isn't perfect, but it did have excellent production values and was generally well acted.  The times I have shown this movie to my 9th-graders, they have for the most part enjoyed it, especially the lush sets and some of the effects when the Audience is transported into the fairy realm. For the more Victorian amongst us, there are a few titillating scenes that some reviewers objected to: a (clothed) breast being groped, the discovery of the young lovers were it not for several well-placed poppies...but there is no nudity in the film. Overall, a nice treat to end your Shakespeare/""MSND"" unit.

The only suggestion I would give (and I know I am in the minority on this issue) is to stop the movie after the discovery of the lovers/Bottom returning back to Athens. The Mechanicals' play before Theseus just isn't funny to me or the kids.",1371513600,2,1140,4.776649746192893

""The village of Monte Athena in Italy at the turn of the 19TH century.  Necklines are high.  Parents are rigid.  Marriage is seldom a matter of love.

The good news: the bustle is in its decline, allowing for the meteoric rise of that newfangled creation: the bicycle.""

The above is found printed on-screen at the beginning of this fun movie.

This movie is based on William Shakespeare's (1564 to 1616) romantic comedy ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (written circa 1595).

Like a dream itself, this movie (and the actual play) presents a mixture of opposing elements: homely and realistic characters are placed within a fantastic, almost surreal, plot; the lowest level of society mixes with the highest; prosaic speech is uttered along with sublime poetry; and the supernatural, the human, and the bestial commingle.

And, like a dream, this dramatic fairy tale initially appears to be a trivial diversion that has little connection to our waking lives.  Upon watching this movie, I discovered this is not true.

What this movie (and the play) does is bring together the following four elements in an enchanted, moonlit forest:

(1) two pairs of well-to-do young lovers: Helena (Calista Flockhart), Demitrus (Christian Bale), Hermia (Anna Friel) and Lysander (Dominic West)

(2) a troop of lowly and inept, amateur actors headed by Nick Bottom (Kevin Kline)

(3) a feuding pair of supernatural sprites: King Oberon (Rupert Everett) & Queen Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer) and

(4) a love potion gone awry due to the incompetence of Oberon's servile sprite (Stanley Tucci)

The result: a mixture of merriment, magic, and insight that only Shakespeare can deliver!!

Of all the actors mentioned above, I think Calista Flockhart as Helena, Anna Friel as Hermia, and Kevin Kline as Nick Bottom do good jobs in their roles.  However, I have to give special kudos to Stanley Tucci as the servile sprite named Robin Goodfellow or Puck.  In my opinion, Tucci's character with his horns (yes, horns!) and impish grin makes this movie truly enjoyable.

The costumes and cinematography, I found, were exceptional.

The background music added significantly to each scene.  Music was by the composers Mendelssohn (including his famous ""Wedding March""), Verdi, Donizetti, Bellini, Rossini, and Mascagni.

Filming for this movie was on location in Italy and studios in Rome.

Shakespearean purists will probably complain that there's stuff missing from this movie.  Yes there is.  However, they don't seem to understand that some stuff has to be left out or the movie would be way too long and tedious.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2003) is perfect in picture and audio quality.  It has one extra.

Bottom line: this movie deserves to be included in Shakespeare's cinematic canon.

1046683,3,6305554420,"Upon reading the many other reviews, both glowing and scathing, I find myself in the wishy-washy position of agreeing with those on both sides:  yes, Shakespeare has been done and done, and done far better and with far more gifted direction and nobler purpose than this;  yes, there is still ""something about it"" that, much like the hempen homespuns' painfully funny production of Pyramus and Thisbe, makes this glittery, insubstantial film charming.  Like eating sugar-laden sweets in place of a proper meal or watching a soap opera, a guilty pleasure.
  Most of us agree that Kevin Kline is superlative as Bottom:  vain, strutting, absurd, an idiot who fancies himself an intellectual, a spectacularly untalented dolt who styles himself an artist....and yet, a flash of self-awareness, a longing for the sublime, crosses his face every now and again, making him a sympathetic rather than a purely pathetic character.  And face it, there's something in all of us that wants even the utter losers to win sometimes:  to be undeservedly worshipped by someone who is way out of our league, to somehow rise to the top above many whose gifts eclipse our own; to be pronounced worthy after a lifetime of unworthiness.  Supporting him, his band of 'hard handed"" village laborers form an affectionate close-knit group, bringing heart and sweetness into their awful performance. The debut (and thankfully, only) performance of Pyramus and Thisbe before the duke, complete with slapstick dog-whirling and monumental hamming on Kline's part, is suddenly moving as the young man playing Thisbe casts off the falsetto and bad wig and speaks from his heart, bringing his noble audience to tears.

  A virile Dominic West and Gibson girl beauty Anna Friel make a charming, physically-compatible Lysander and Hermia;  Christian Bale does well as unfaithful and arrogant Demetrius, and he manages to convey a bit of realization that his character, spurned again by Lysander-doting Hermia in the woods, finally grasps the fact that one cannot force the love of another, even if the law is on his side.  A bit of a false note with Helena as portrayed by the older, frail-looking Calista Flockhart, whose accent is affected and speech stilted and whose manner seems to be intentionally precious and focused on showing everyone how much she can pucker her bee-stung lips.  Stanley Tucci is needling and charming as Puck; Rupert Everett, who obviously spent a great deal of time waxing, is a bit fey, if you'll pardon the pun, but so pretty and with that wonderful gravelly purr of a voice that you'd not mind if he were reading a cereal box.  Michelle Pfieffer does a fine job, and her golden and statuesque ice queen-turned-sex goddess loveliness nearly makes up for her lack of feel for the language.  David Straithairn as Theseus does seem a bit, ahem,wimpy and weak-chinned...but, as another review pointed out, they sort of cut off his....best lines.  You don't get the back story of the battle and truce-by-marriage of Theseus and Hippolyta;  all you see is the obviously hard-up Duke chasing radiant, pouty-lipped Sophie Marceau, who is moody and pensive and in a snit with her husband-to-be over his insistence on the letter of the law over the spirit.

  Ultimately, much more could have been made of the overarching play-within-play-within-a-play, in which the happiness and very lives of the small and the mortal depend precariously upon the whims and moods of the great and the omnipotent--a row between the Faerie king and queen wreaks havoc upon the natural world, stirring tempests and plagues, just as the lives of young lovers and workingmen depend upon the temperament of controlling fathers and stern and sexually frustrated dukes-- likewise Elizabeth I's many romances and rumored betrothals had the capacity to shake the foundations of her country, as her father's stormy love life destroyed many a family, rocked nations and tore the church asunder.  Shakespeare spoke the truth in parables, and got away with it, reminding the audience that this was but a play, a fancy, a dream, and not meant to be taken seriously.  And this is it--the viewer is allowed to take this film lightly.  It's allowed to be light and made of nothing but air and gossamer.  So quick do bright things come to confusion....let's enjoy a bit of fool's gold for its sparkle and let it be what it is.",1312588800,2,4375,5.0

This makes for a beautiful and lively environment.  The difficulty of course is that the play is actually located in Athens with no less than Theseus and Hyppolyta as central characters.  But then, much of the play occurs in a nearby magical forest filled with fairies.  Why not in that case have the court itself located in Italy?

Though some scenes, such as the mud fight, are somewhat excessive, many are actually hilarious, especially in the latter part of the movie.

Overall, this highly entertaining work is warmly recommended to all.",1306108800,,772,4.884615384615385
1046726,4,6305554420,"This movie production of A Midsummer Nights's Dream is like many other movies of well known works, whether they are books, plays, or something else. I've heard the complaint so many times that it's not the same, it's different.

In most instances that's easy to understand as the movie has time and audience constraints that must be factored in to a commercial for profit enterprise. The question then becomes; does the movie have any merit as an independent entertainment entity?

I believe the answer for this movie is yes, it most certainly does. Is it pure Shakespeare, no it's not, is it a legitimate evening's entertainment, I would say for most of us it is just that, pleasant entertainment.

I have seen the old complaints about movies not being like the book, play, fill in the blank with whatever comes to mind and the basic question always remains, and does the movie provide good entertainment in its own right? If it does just enjoy it for what it is and forget what it is not.

The first time I came to grips with that dilemma was when the movie ""Dune"" by Frank Herbert came out; I bought the DVD and was dismayed by how much it deviated from the book. I was almost ready to simply write the movie version off as a bad effort when I came to realize that although the movie was indeed different from the book, it had merit on its own and was really rather entertaining to watch.

Once I made that mental adjustment I was able to just enjoy the movie for what it was and put the book out of my mind while watching it.

If one can take that step with this movie I think many, if not all, will find it a light-hearted evening's entertainment.",1302480000,,1652,4.417763157894737

I'm not sure how far off this is from Shakespeare's original play. It's probably pretty far off. Most movies are very far off from the book or play. That's unfortunate, but it's just the way things are. If you are looking for a version of A Midsummer Night's Dream that is very close to the play/book, you'll probably never find it. So you might as well just stick with this,or just read the book. The acting is superb! With Christian Bale and Anna Friel in the same movie, you can hardly get any better than that. The music is excellent and the screenplay. Everything is done very well in my opinion. The movie is a little bit silly, but then it's fiction.",1296086400,,769,4.347222222222222
1046728,3,6305554420,"Film is set at the turn of the 19th century in Athens, Greece. In film, there are bicycles and Lysander and Hermia ride them into woods near Athens. Helena and Demetrius follow in pursuit. Also, in this adaptation, the fairies have records and record players (like from the 1950s) that play a particularly non-Victorian music (some Italian opera).

While floating around Athens, the fairies take the shapes of small white lights. Once they entire the woods of Athens, they generally transform themselves into live actors, although they are occasionally retransformed into white lights while in the forest. There does not appear to be any logical explanation/method to explain when the fairies are shown as lights and when they are shown as humans.

Noting some changes/alterations/limitations within this film adaptation:

- There is no evidence or reference that Theseus captured Hippolyta in his military conquest of the Amazons. In fact, Hippolyta appears very traditionally European.

- Lysander and Demetrius scuffle after 1.1.94.

- Hippolyta appears upset that Theseus plans to make Hermia marry Demetrius. [Note: In text, we do not really know how Hippolyta feels about Theseus. Yet, this adaptation seems to imply that Hippolyta is not particularly happy to marry Theseus yet is resolved.]

- Young teenage boys pour a few bottles of wine onto Bottom while he is roaring (after 1.2.68). This is problematic because any man's honor in that time could never have allowed such an insult to pass without payback. In this film, Bottom cowers to the laughter of the extra-textual pranksters.

- After 2.1.57, just before Oberon and Titania meet, an earthquake and other bizarre occurrences to the earth happen. The purposes seem to be (1) to show Titania's power and (2) to demonstrate that Oberon and Titania are not on good terms with one another. However, this scene appears quite fake - hardly realistic.

- Robin mimics Oberon's physical posture. The text provides no evidence that this occurred.

- After 2.2.34, as Oberon is going to give Titania the love potion, he meets Titania's guard and gives her a mirror with which to look upon herself. This prevents the guard from blowing her horn and calling for help. After Oberon places the potion into Titania's eyes, he leaves, never letting us know what happened to this guard nymph and the mirror. [My Note: Adding the scene with the mirror was probably a desire to make the scene appear more realistic to a modern audience. Some audience members might wonder how Oberon is able to place the potion in Titania's eyes without her guard nymph finding out. However, Shakespeare gives no answer to this, making the viewer simply trust that it is within Oberon's power to achieve this objective, as King of the fairies.]

- Helena is obsessed with Demetrius [in a similar way to how Silvius is obsessed with Phoebe in AYLI].

- Beginning at 3.1.110 when Bottom begins singing, the viewer is immediately aware that Bottom is singing in a manner much like the donkey-head he has become. One cannot tell based on the text exactly how good or bad Bottom's singing is, although one can speculate that it is probably quite bad.

- Nick Bottom appears absolutely astonished to be receiving Titania's love (even though he does not seem to realize that she is Titania, Queen of the Fairies).

- As Hermia and Helena fight, Hermia pushes Helena into a great mud pit. This mud pit clearly does not derive itself from the text.

- The fairies wash the clothing and repair the bikes of the 4 lovers. [This whole sequence is unnecessary because the text provides no evidence that clothing needed washed. Of course, no mud pit or bikes existed in the text either.]

- Hippolyta, at the beginning of the hunting scene, seems to show some dislike for Theseus (through her body language), as though she feels Theseus is not taking her into his confidence.

- In 4.1.125-135, Theseus, Egeus, etc. find the four lovers sleeping naked outdoors. In the text, it is pretty obvious that they were not naked as they slept. In fact, in this adaptation, Theseus seems to express little surprise of their all being outdoors sleeping naked together.

- After Demetrius proclaims his love for Helena, Theseus takes Hippolyta aside and appears to talk with her about how he should act (although one cannot be certain of this). This is the first time in the film that Theseus has involved Hippolyta in an important policy decision. After finishing his conversation with Hippolyta, Theseus agrees to allow Demetrius to marry Helena. [Again, Theseus taking Hippolyta into his confidence is extra-textual.]

- Egeus, during the marriage celebration, walks out. He seems quite unhappy that Hermia has married Lysander and not Demetrius. [Note: This is extra-textual. We cannot tell from the text whether Egeus is content with Lysander marrying his daughter or not.]

- The play within the play is intentionally performed very badly, worse than anyone reading Shakespeare's text would believe was possible. This is not to say that the play, within the play, in Shakespeare's text is a professional play. However, in this film adaptation, this play really is a disaster. That said, the play within the play is very humorous for the modern viewer and should certainly lead to laughter from the modern audience. As for how people in Shakespeare's audience would have reacted, well...let us not say too much about that.

Bottom line:

1046731,4,6305554420,"It's neither the best nor worst of Shakespeare's many comedies, but ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" definitely holds one honor -- it's the most fantastical of his works. And while the Hollywood adaptation has some flaws in its narrative, it's a remarkably solid little story doused in glitter, lush flowers, 19th-century clothing and sometimes mud-wrestling.

As the Italian city of Monte Athens prepares for the wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta, the fusty Egeus is demanding that his daughter Hermia (Anna Friel) marry the man he's chosen for her, Demetrius (Christian Bale). Her only other options are death or nunhood.

Since she's in love with a young man named Lysander (Dominic West), Hermia refuses, and the two of them plot to escape Athens and marry elsewhere. But Helena (Calista Flockhart), a girl who has been kicked to the curb by Demetrius, tips him off about their plans; he chases Hermia and Lysander into the woods, with Helena following him all the way. Are you confused yet?

But on this same night, the fairy king Oberon (Rupert Everett) and his queen Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer) are feuding over a little Indian boy. Oberon decides to use a magical ""love juice"" from a flower to cause some trouble for Titania by making her fall in love with some random weaver named Nick Bottom (Kevin Kline) whom his henchman Puck (Stanley Tucci) has turned into a donkey-headed man. He also decides to have Puck iron out the four lovers' romantic troubles with the same potion. But of course, hijinks ensue.

""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is another one of Shakespeare's plays that REALLY needs to be seen before it's read -- and as adaptations go, this movie is a pretty good one. The story floats along in an enchanted haze of fairy magic, forest groves, and lots of body glitter and plaster wings (just work REALLY hard to suspend your disbelief!).

The scriptwriters also adapt Shakespeare's poetry beautifully (""Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,/That the rude sea grew civil at her song""). But there's also plenty of his hilarious dialogue (""Since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear..."" ""DEVOURED!"") and equally hilarious problems, such as when both guys who were once in love with Hermia are enchanted to be madly in love with Helena. Even the fairies provide some comic relief (Oberon's oft-used ""This is all your fault!"" expression, usually aimed at Puck).

The cast seems a bit too Hollywood at first glance, but they're fairly good once you get into the story. Bale and West are excellent as the high-spirited, intensely jealous young men, Friel is both feisty and sweet as Hermia, and Kline is suitably hilarious as Nick Bottom (""Let me play the moon!""). Flockhart is a mild drawback, though -- she looks like she's being devoured by her dress and wig.

But the best performance here is Pfeiffer as the haughty, sensual Titania; few actresses have the beauty and presence for this role, and she has it. And both Everett and Tucci are excellent as the languid Oberon and a decidedly middle-aged-looking Puck.

""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is a shimmering little concoction of magic, romantic mayhem and fairy squabbling -- good acting, solid adaptation, and really gorgeous Italian settings.",1275955200,3,3215,4.996261682242991
1046732,5,6305554420,"This version is my absolute favorite. I wanted to rent or buy this since I watched the trailer, clips and even signed up to do the play. At the time I was in the play, I was obsessed with Kevin (Kline). So obsessed that I signed up and pretended that he was a fairy too. I laughed at first when I saw him in donkey ears. I thought for a second he was a bunny rabbit just by how the ears were sitting. Each time I watch this, I think of 2 things. 1 is about how I had great fun doing the play and the 2nd is about when Kevin on stage during the Q & A on April 14th 2012 said that he worked with Michelle Pfeiffer and then afterwards, he hasn't worked with her since. I pull off quotes from my high school play. And now thanks to it, this movie would go by fast. I laughed a little bit up to the scene where Nick Bottom as Pyramus was like ""Now am I dead. Now am I fled. My soul is in the sky."" Then I thought ""In heaven."" I thought a lot of things in this. I thought about how much I admire Calista Flockhart, when Rupert Everett played Prince Charming in the Shrek films, my video I made once where I put in sound effects of the lion growling/roaring like a leopard (which I don't have that anymore), and how I'm surprised that Michelle has a birthday just a day after I've had mine.",1273104000,,1283,3.9384615384615387

1046734,5,6305554420,"I personally feel that you should keep all of the dialogue from a Shakespeare play when you do a version of it.  However, that would create a huge problem.  It would last for a while.  I usually compare this version with the version done in the late sixties by the Royal Shakespeare Company, with Ian Holm as Puck.  While that version mainly tries to have as much of the dialogue as possible, this version puts in more visuals.  This also includes more incidental music, and moments where they set the scene up.

This movie has mainly taken dialogue out, but of what little dialogue they've added, they've only added one-word lines, and lines in italian with subtitles.  Like usual, they brought it to a more modern time, which gives them different things that they can do.  I feel that the acting and costuming is wonderful, and some of the scenes are done very well.  I have never seen such a great version of the play at the end.  I feel that having scenes without dialogue, just showing the settings of the scenes are done very beautifully.

I'm unsure what Shakespeare would think of this.  However, he would probably appreciate how his work is still being done today.  If you are willing to see Shakespeare being reinterpreted, get this, if you think that everything must be done exactly like the original, you won't like this.",1249516800,2,1333,4.645299145299146
1046762,5,6305554420,"There are many good versions of ""William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.""  Among which is this well played Michael Hoffman (1999) version.  The innovative use of the bicycle and being filmed in Tuscany adds to the magic.  As with earlier versions contemporary actors are used.  Only at first you say, ""Now where have I seen Puck? (Stanley Tucci)"", to realize it was in ""Undercover Blues.""  Or anticipating who will play Titania?  Later you will be so engrossed in the play that you will only see the characters for themselves.

Now the situation.  We have overlapping tales, which in the confusion become even more overlapping and confusing.  We have Theseus (David Strathairn), Duke of Athens, about to marry Hippolyta (Sophie Marceau), Queen of the Amazons.  Practicing in the solitude of the Woods is a troop of actors that will appear at the wedding.  One of the troops is a married man with a roving eye, Bottom (Kevin Kline); he is soon encountering with a group of fairies.  Now this is an interesting situation on its own.  However there is more.  Hermia is being forced by her father Egeus to marry Demetrius.  However Hermia (Anna Friel) is in love with Lysander (Dominic West.)  Wait there is more Hermia's friend Helena (Calista Flockhart) is in love with Demetrius, who ignores her. Yep into the wood escape Hermia and Lysander.  Hot on their trail is Demetrius (Christian Bale) doggedly followed by Helena.  Mean time back at the ranch the Fairy queen and king has a slight falling-out.  So the fairy king intends to correct everyone's situation and teach a few lessons along the way.  You get the idea.  Now setback and watch the fun. And stay tuned for the play in the end.

Yet, even with a fantastic cast, the director seems to be completely oblivious to that fact.  This production seems to have been directed by a man that, not only has never seen a production of the play before, was completely oblivious to the fact it was a comedy.

The cast is completely wasted on this laughless mistake.  Rupert Everett mumbles through Oberon's lines, rendering them devoid of emotion.  Michelle Pfiefer has one fleeting moment, but vanishes into the production values for the rest of the time.  Sophie Marceau is wasted as Hipplolyta.  Calista Flockhart, fully capable of slapstick hilarity as any fan of Ally McBeal will recall, is reduced to screeching and tears.  Christian Bale is miscast as a young lover.  And last but not least, the wonderful Stanley Tucci, is reduced to playing a world weary Puck, until he inexplicably rides around on a bicycle giggling like a little girl.

The final major scene features a group of incompetent actors performing a butchered scene to an incredulous audience of royals.  I have seen this done by first year college students with side-splitting hilarity the result, but here, a comic master, Kevin Kline, is forced to pitch a dog into the audience to try and get a laugh.

One of the saddest things I have seen on film.

As a last note, why has it become neccessary to throw some random boob shots into a movie just to get a PG-13 rating?  Just a split second of some random nymphs in a pond, topless, for no discernable reason.

1046767,5,6305554420,"First, the stars. No, not the astrologer's stars, the movie stars, goofy! Some of those high priced people can act! Of course, I'm in luck in that I see so few Hollywood movies that I don't recognize them, so it's easy to suspend disbelief. The one I did recognize was Stanley Tucci, the star of Big Night. Tucci was spectacular in the role of Puck; he stole every scene he appeared in. That guy Kevin Kline did a similar heist on all his scenes; he made Bottom the prime character of the story, with a little help from the editors and cinematographers, who played on his face - his foolish integrity, his dreams - almost any time when the script allowed. Whichever leading lady it was who played Helena was also ""picture"" perfect, and her scenes of squalling with Hermia were side-splitting funny. The only flop, as an actress, was Michelle Pfeiffer as the Queen of the fairies; luscious looking, yes, but she delivered her lines more stiffly than a seventh-grade cheerleader in English class.

The setting in Italy was completely convincing; after all, most of the Eizabethan comedies were based on Italian models, with commedia dell'arte roots, and Elizabethans knew rather little about settings in Athens. The little touches of Italian opera - both visual and in the soundtrack - were deft and charming. The whole air of opulence suited the magic of the midsummer night like the smile on a pretty child's face.

Oh yeah, and then there was the script. That Shakespeare guy has a future. [Yes, there were cuts, but the shortening of the play served one very useful purpose. It allowed the actors to defy the current notion that every line of Shakespeare has to be spoken so fast that no one can understand it well enough to be bored. Honestly, it was delightful to be able to follow every word for a change. True, the accents were a hodge-podge of Brit and American, but I for one didn't much mind.]

A film of a play by Shakespeare should be at least as enjoyable for a modern audience as we all assume the Globe Theater production was for the flesh-and-blood Elizabethans.

The only slight off note is that the director should have had Hippolyta wearing a uniform (she was the Queen of the Amazons, after all) because this would have helped the audiance understand the interaction between herself and Theseus- Hippolyta gives us Shakespeare's vision of the empowered modern woman- someone who has choices and does NOT have to get married if she does not want to.

1046850,4,6305554420,"This film adaptation of William Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is a star-studded and workable translation of the original play.  It has a movie's freedom of action with respect to sets.  The story moves easily from a Duke's luxurious Italian villa being prepared for a wedding, to a forest where two sets of lovers undergo a comedy of mistaken emotions thanks to feuding among groups of ethereal spirits, to the small town outside the villa where a group of workers is preparing a play to present at the wedding.  The sets are sumptious, attractive to the eye, and suitable to the story.

The cast is truly star-studded, all with very solid movie credentials, although few with real chops for a Shakespeare play. Kevin Kline easily steals the show as the hapless Bottom, an over-the-top actor who is bewitched by the spirit Puck (played with mischevious good humor by Stanley Tucci) into a love affair with the Queen of the Fairies (played by Michelle Pfeiffer).  Rupert Everett is solid as a spirit who while in search of revenge on the Queen unleashes much of the magical mayhem in the forest. Calista Flockheart seems least up to par as an hysterical Helena, one of the star-crossed lovers in the forest,

Perhaps the best portion of the movie is the play within a play, as Kevin Kline and his ham-handed fellow troupers struggle to put together their play.  The audience cannot help but feel sympathy as they wrestle with lack of talent, uncooperative sets, and the unintended consequences of improvisation.  Their determination is rewarded by an unorthodox but ultimately successful presentation that earns them the sincere compliments of the Duke.

1046859,5,6305554420,"Along with ""The Comedy of Errors,"" ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" remains one of my favorite Shakespeare comedies. Generally speaking, I don't like it when Shakespeare's plays are taken out of their time and place. But this is one case where in doing so, the beauty and dignity of the play was not marred in the least. The early 1900 Italian scenes and music seem to fit quite well. For those of you who haven't read the play, the story involves 3 subplots that Shakespeare intertwines quite well. The first is the 4 young lovers (Lysander, Demetrius, Helena, and Hermia.). Hermia's father wants her to marry Demetrius; Hermia loves Lysander; Helena loves Demetrius, but he is after Hermia. When Hermia and Lysander run away, we meet the 2nd plot. (Bottom and his actor friends.) We get to see them prepare a comedy that will be performed before the Duke Theseus.  There is one element of sorrow involving Bottom's unhappy marriage. In my opinion though, this fits rather well. (A little sadness seems to prevent a comedy from becoming a farce. And in Shakespeare's hilarious ""Comedy of Errors,"" there was the one sad element of Egeon.) The 3rd subplot involves the rift between the fairy king Oberon, and his wife Titania. Titania has stolen an Indian boy, and Oberon wants him for his servant. (A faint resemblance to a custody case?) Well, Titania refuses to hand the child over, and Oberon plots revenge. He will cast a spell on his wife that will make her fall in love with whatever she sees when she wakes up. Oberon's servant Puck runs across the actors in the woods, and Bottom will play a part (unknowingly) in Oberon's revenge. Oberon also runs across the 4 young lovers. He pities the scorned Helena and decides to interfere. He will have Puck work a spell on Demetrius to make him love Helena. But of course, since this is a comedy, things will not exactly go according to plan! But despite the mishaps, Shakespeare manages to fix everything and prepare a happy ending. Rupert Everett (Oberon), Stanley Tucci (Puck), Michelle Pfiefer (Titania), and Kevin Kline (Bottom) play their parts with a beautifully convincing style. Director Michael Hoffman is not exactly Franco Zeffirelli, but he does an excellent job in scenery, music, and keeping the content of the play in tact. (Taking a classic and putting to screen is seldom easy!) The best thing I can say about this movie is that while it is funny, it is also done with beauty, style, and dignity. It may be that this movie shows that a comedy and a farce are NOT the same thing.",1152662400,4,2539,4.7313769751693

Ancient Athens meets fairlyland,  which in turn meets Elizabethan tradespeople-turned-thespians...adding layers of 19th century Italy to the mix,  and bicycles,  and windeup gramophones, and a repetitive recycling of Italian opera's greatest hits on the soundtrack,  just muddies things up.  Lots of money went into this production,  and it does have some nice visuals.  But there is no genuine artistic vision here.  Less would have been more.  The two stars are for the director's concept,  not for author William S., whose best lines are just about impossible to ruin.",1144454400,3,631,5.536842105263158
1046891,4,6305554420,"This film is an able transposition of Shakespeare's comedy from ancient Athens to the tiny Italian village of Monte Atena at the end of the 19th century. The action takes place on an enormous estate run by Duke Theseus (David Strathairn of ""Good Night and Good Luck""). The acting troupe led by Kevin Klein's Bottom the clown is made up of locals who love the theater enough to neglect their other work. The forest filled with magical fairy-folk lies just beyond the carefully clipped meadows that signal the boundary between logic and enchantment.

The film is fun. The lovers (with Calista Flockhart as Helena and a pre-""Batman Begins"" Christopher Bale) are by turns love-smitten and repelled. They make their way around the forest on bicycles. The fairy-folk present a kaleidoscopic array of shapes, colors and sizes. It's fun to recognize influences -- from paintings by Waterhouse to Hieronymus Bosch -- that were used to depict them.

Special mention goes to the troupe of clowns that prepares a play for the Duke's wedding. Led by Klein/Bottom they are by turns committed thespians and incompetent oafs. Indeed, they are a play *within* the play-within-a-play as the film takes us inside Bottom's pathetic and unhappy marriage to a woman who has no use for his dreams of the stage. This gives the film a bit of a somber tone, but does it no lasting harm.

The all-star cast is generally up to the task. Michelle Pfeiffer is radiant as Titania. Flockhart is appropriately weepy, confused and irate as befuddled Helena. Stanley Tucci's Robin Goodfellow as appropriately ... puckish in his role as Oberon's servant. And Klein, after an enchantment that has turned him into an ass, incorporates a donkey's braying into his laughter and speech. The presentation of ""Pyramis and Thisbe"" was a high point of the film, played for all its comic pathos.

There are some qualifications to my praise. The musical score often obscured the dialog -- unpardonable when it comes to the Bard! And there was much unchaste behavior in the forest that could just as easily have been left out or dealt with in hints. In the discovery scene toward the end, the lovers are discovered sleeping in naked embrace by their parents and benefactors. The shock of such a discovery in 18-whatever was replaced by unconvincing resignation on the part of the observers. And some of the roles seeme to have been phoned in, notably Rupert Everett's dull, detached Oberon.

But these quibbles aside, ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" managed to capture the intensity of the lovers and the whimsical earthiness of the world of magic.",1142812800,8,2596,4.931350114416476

1046894,4,6305554420,"This is a very fun and somewhat hollywoodized version of the great classic play.  I got it because my daughter (10) likes a Shakespeare kids synopsis, so hoped to expose her to the language and the magic of a real production.  At this, the film definitely succeeds.  She has watched this, utterly rivetted, several times and will continue to do so for years; to my delighted surprise, her brother (6) watched it with her and laughingly approved.  I would much rather they watch this than cartoons or Star Wars, thought there is a place for those as well.

I do not believe this is a film for purists, which forms the basis of much of the snobbish criticism from certain reviewers here.  While I try to cultivate my mind, I am nowhere near their (self conscious) erudition and so cannot answer their criticisms.  However, this production is quite enthralling, with updates in Tuscany and many quirky details (demonstrating in my view how this is still a living work of art), and beautifully shot and acted.  That is where my crticism stops.

What really convinces me this is worthwhile is the reaction of my children, which was overwhelmingly positive.  They can later become Shakespear purists if they wish, which is an option I was hoping to help create for them.  Afterall, much of parenting is the opening of paths that children may someday find is for them, and this film is one small step along that way.

1046895,2,6305554420,"A quick scroll through the reviews shows a sharp divide. Some like this Hollywood-style rendition of Midsummer's Night while others, (to be polite) do not.  To make matters more confusing, several reviews are deceptive because the reviewer seriously misjudges his/her depth of experience with this kind thing.  To find out your probable reaction in less than 20 seconds, just answer these questions:

Do you see live Shakespeare every year or two?  Do you know who Iago is?  Who Prospero is?  Do you know what the Queen Mab speech is?  Have you seen a film with Ian McClellan in a Shakespearean role?

If you mostly answered ""yes,"" you are likely to squirm in pain throughout this movie.  (See Category B below.)  On the other hand, if you are not particularly conversant with Shakespeare (if you answered ""no"" to more than a couple questions above,  you're not, something many reviewers both in the newspapers and here fail to fathom), chances actually become much higher that you will be okay with this.  (See Category A.)

Category A:  If you enjoy movies and have read a few of the Bard's plays here and there, perhaps back in school, you might be enjoy this.  The Hollywood actors provide familiar faces, and a couple give respectable performances--Kevin Kline, for instance.  If you find Shakespeare too long, the play here has been lopped roughly in half.  If you find Elizabethan dialogue goes by too fast, several visuals have been inserted, generally slowing the pace.

The problem is this:  When you finish watching, you might be tempted to think this story is just a lark and that Shakespeare was just writing wierd stuff about faeries.  But that's just this movie's hacked-up version of the story, not Shakespeare's actual play.  If you're curious, watch the BBC version.  You will see just how much dramatic weight has been cut, and how the play is exponentially more poetic and thought-provoking than what this pedestrian movie would lead you to think.

Category B:  If you could answer most of the questions above (or have recently read this play), you will likely roll your eyes throughout this movie.  Despite its cagey marketing, this is NOT a Kenneth Branagh-type affair where Hollywood actors are tossed into minor roles for financial reasons.  This movie is Hollywood through and through, meaning inane special effects and actors, for the most part, way out of their league. (The exceptions, like Bernard Hill, appear to have been cast to give the movie at least a veneer of authenticity.)

Worst of all, the director, in typical Hollywood fashion, does not trust the viewer and does not trust the Bard.  So he has inserted several ponderous minutes of Hollywood-style back story for Bottom.  Silly sight gags, with no relation to the text, abound.  It's as if the director doesn't think the Bard  is actually funny.  All the while, some of the most humorous lines are cut or, worse, delivered with no understanding of their meaning.  Stick with the BBC version for real Shakespeare.

By the way, many reviewers have scratched their heads at why they shot this as 19th Century Tuscany.  Just follow the Hollywood thinking.  Branagh's Much Ado had just come out, set in 19th Century Tuscany just the year before....",1128643200,224,3236,4.9168207024029575
1046896,5,6305554420,"This is a fine version/adaptation of Shakespeare's classic comic masterpiece, with superior cinematography and fine acting, especially in actress Michelle Pfeiffer as the Fairy Queen Titania,Calista Flockhart as Helena, Stanley Tucci as the mischievous sprite Puck and Kevin Kline as Bottom the actor-turned-donkey. The setting has been changed to turn-of-the-century Tuscany, Italy, and the cast is mostly British and American actors donning Edwardian clothes (when they are not nude). It is still a good film and the magic of the original work is not lost in this strange twist in time period. The look, cinematially, is breathtaking, as we see lush vistas of the Tuscan countryside. The authentic Edwardian ambiance includes the newly invented bicycle and the much-loved phonograph, which constantly plays opera. Which brings me to another outstanding element in this movie- the soundtrack. It is gorgeous and will make you want to purchase the soundtrack itself. Besides spectacular classical music, like the Overture, Nocturne and Wedding March from Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream; the score features operatic arias sung by popular and talented opera stars Roberto Alagna, Renee Fleming, Luciano Pavarotti and Cecilia Bartoli. The most beautiful of these is Renee Fleming's interpretation of the aria ""Casta Diva"" from Bellini's Norma. Most people associate this Shakespearian comedy with English folk and Elizabethan times, it is a jolly comedy which reflected the gaiety of Queen Elizabeth's festive court, especially festive around the holidays. But no matter how you change this story to fit a diverse time period, it is still the same story. The actors are doing a fine job in their respective roles. It is still delightful to watch Puck making fools of the lovers who fall for each other's partners. The movie is even better on DVD, packed with some bonus features including trailer and commentary. The sound is superior than on VHS. This is a must have. I highly recommend it. Memorable are such scenes as when Helena and the other girl get in a mud-fight! I was very surprised that Calista Flockheart (from Fox's Ally Mcbeal) was in this movie and even more surprised that soprano Renee Fleming lent her voice to this. She is singing the earliest Casta Diva she has ever sung, and is in fine shape vocally.

Even Callista acted, and spoke, sufficiently well that I forgot to notice, once or twice, her malnutrition.  Only David Straithairn, who I usually love, seemed slightly miscast.

I don't understand the change of venue, century or mode of transportion, but it doesn't really matter.  Those things are not important to the story, the acting or the cinematic effect (although the bicycles were a clever way to get them into the woods).

1046899,4,6305554420,"`A Midsummer's Night Dream', adapted and directed by Michael Hoffman from the play by William Shakespeare is a `star studded' production which spared no expense to bring to the screen a lush interpretation of one of Shakespeare's most delightful plays.

With important roles being played by the likes of Rupert Everett, Calista Flockhart, Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Stanley Tucci, one has every reason to expect a truly great experience. Unfortunately, it is not as great an experience as it could have been.

Part of my problem may be traceable to the adapter's moving the venue from ancient Athens to 19th century Tuscany, in a villa outside a town of `Athene'. The dissonance between the Greek names and references in the Tuscan setting, with music (Mendelsohn) suitable to a Viennese concert hall in the background stretches my imagination even further than the original Shakespearean fantasy. Satyrs, nymphs, fairies, centaurs, and sprites just seem more at home in ancient Greece than in the suburbs of Florence. I do confess, however, that the addition of the bicycles does add an element of humor that has been overlaid on Shakespeare's own business.

My main problem lies in the uneven acting. I really enjoyed headliner Kline, as there are simply not enough good roles around for his special talents. This is a role where, as in his Academy Award winning role in `A Fish Called Wanda'; he can pull out all the stops to play a farcical character in so many different situations, including the great stint as a mule. Stanley Tucci does an especially good job as Puck and Flockhart plays her role of ignored lover to the hilt. The biggest problems seem to be in the performances of Everett and Pfeiffer. I am simply not a good enough Shakespearean scholar to divine how I think these roles of Oberon and Titania, the spirit world nobles, should be played, but I suspect these are two good examples of how they should not be played. Even though the plot makes then rather annoyed with one another, the actors play it with tight lips and surly miens. This is really surprising, especially for Pfeiffer who does such a marvelous job in another `period piece' as the young wife and seduction target of Vicomte Valmont in `Dangerous Liaisons'.

Overall, the very best part of the movie is the scenes centered on the amateur troupe of local actors lead by the role played by Roger Rees with the most ambitious Thespian, Bottom played by Kline. This is the source of most of the comedy in the play.

As with most of Shakespeare's comedies, there is an undercurrent of peril to at least one character, the young daughter to a Tuscan landowner who refuses to marry the man to whom her family has arranged a marriage. The alternative to disobeying her father is death, modified by the local Duke to a lifetime in a convent. This second story line opens and closes the play and drives most of the action.

The third and least well realized story is the plot between the failure of romance between the noble spirits Oberon and Titania. In the hands of this director, the most it does is provide mechanisms for moving the other two plots along by the actions of major domo Puck who creates then resolves great romantic confusion between both spirits and young Tuscans.

In spite of these weaknesses, I will watch this movie three or four times for every viewing I do of some modern dramatic efforts such as, for example, `Shakespeare in Love'. There are few good extras on this DVD, and I would have enjoyed a commentary by the director telling us of his decisions on adapting Shakespeare, whose plays have done so well on their own for these last 400 years, thank you very much.

Recommended, if you like Shakespeare, Kevin Kline, or fantasy in general. Also a good pick if you happen to want to understand Woody Allen's parody, 'A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy'.",1124755200,3,3866,4.76831091180867
1046920,3,6305554420,"The plot, as most know, centers on the mishaps of four young lovers: Helena (Calista Flockhart), Lysander (Dominic West), Demetrius (Christian Bale), and Hermia (Anna Friel). Helena is a frazzled but not unattractive young lady desperately in love with the rich and handsome Demetrius. Alas, he does not love her, and tells her so plainly. This does not have the desired effect; Helena admires him even more for his honesty and pursues him harder. Demetrius, however, has his sights set on the lovely young heiress Hermia. Hermia's father approves the match, but she does not; she is in love with the much poorer Lysander and makes plans to elope with him.

As if this were not all complicated enough, all four youth manage to all end up in the forest outside town, where - thanks to several cases of mistaken identity and misapplied Fairie magic - things go even more awry. Both Lysander and Demetrius mysteriously become strongly attracted to Helena, who thinks it is all a very cruel joke and decides she loves neither one. Hermia, meanwhile, is convinced that her erstwhile friend Helena has intentionally stolen her lover away, and swears enmity. A long and complicated fight ensues, which is eventually put right by the Fairie king, Oberon and his perhaps-trusty servant, Puck.

Meanwhile, a subplot is also at work involving Bottom, the members of his merchant class in town, a play, and (once again) the Fairies. The details of this are even more complicated than the other plot; suffice it to say Bottom ends up with the famous donkey's ears and the Fairie queen Titania falls in love with him thanks to a trick of Oberon's.

Eventually, as in all Shakespearean comedies, everything is put right again: the four young lovers wake up in their proper loved one's arms, the tradesmen's play is well-received, and the Fairies reunite and cohabit harmoniously. It is not the end, but how we get there, that provides the entertainment.

As with most Shakespeare adaptations, this one is done in by poor performances. It takes a particular brand of acting to get Shakespeare right, and some of the cast just simply do not have it. Michelle Pfeiffer and Calista Flockhart are particularly bad, respectively cringe-inducing and manically perplexed whenever they are onscreen. Pfeiffer is perhaps the weakest link in the cast; her Titania is grossly overacted, and her glittery eyeshadow does as much for her character as her delivery, which is stilted at the best of times and usually far better when watched with the ""mute"" button on. Surprisingly, Rupert Everett is also unimpressive as her Fairie husband, King Oberon; he usually acquits himself quite well in movies but here is so moody and overbearing that it is nearly impossible to watch him.

Stanley Tucci as Puck is a strange, but surprisingly effective choice. Sophie Marceau is elegant and restrained as the queen Hippolyta, who provides the voice of reason in all the love affair nonsense; she is lovely, though she doesn't seem much like Shakespeare's Hippolyta. Kevin Kline acquits himself extremely well as Bottom, going for a blend of subtlety and camp that works well, proving himself a capable Shakespearean actor. The four lovers are probably the best-performed in the movie; I expected a typically good performance from Christian Bale, but was pleasantly surprised by Dominic West as well. They both give admirable performances, as does Anna Friel. The only real problem I have with Calista Flockhart is that she looks quite unhealthy in the scene where the four lovers are discovered asleep quite nude in the woods after having, presumably, made up...she is wince-inducingly skinny. Apart from this she isn't terrible, and though she does give the most one-note performance of the four youth, by this time we have seen so much of Pfeiffer's horrendous Titania that she really looks rather splendid in comparison.

The visual design of the picture leaves a lot to be desired. Setting the film in Italy allows for sumptious landscapes and the requisite Tuscan-style golden piazzas, but it also jars rather badly with the audience's ability to accept the extremely dated notions of the play, like Hermia's father's threat to execute her if she doesn't marry Demetrius. In charming 19th century Italy, we wonder, would such things really happen? Bicycles and phonographs and fox-hunts are pretty to look at and used cleverly enough, but even these touches of whimsy are not enough to redeem the conception of the Fairie realm. The Fairies are frequently fat or ugly, and they wear body glitter and strange strap-on wings vaguely representing their names. They are, indeed, far more mundane and less interesting than their human counterparts; sad indeed in this most whimsical of Shakespeare's comedies.

All in all, it is not a terrible adaptation, and it is far better than some Shakespeare re-workings for the screen (Ethan Hawke's ""Hamlet comes to mind). It is not terribly engaging, but it is entertaining enough, particularly if one fast-forwards through the Fairie scenes and concentrates one those between the four lovers and the tradesmen's play.",1121558400,10,5122,5.061611374407583

Yes, the music is okay, the costumes gorgeous, the settings beautiful and elaborate, acting excellent. The story shines, too.  You travel through each characters journey-Helena feeling betrayed, confused, jealous.  Hermia full of joy, then anger, frustration.  Bottom, literally a fool, laughed at, and probably the only one who was truly touched for life by the magic of the fairies.  Puck, humorous, foolish, mistaken, sorry!

1046925,3,6305554420,"The biggest draw of the film, is, of course its top-shelf cast. Hoffman stuffed as many familiar faces as he could in his light, accessible interpretation of Shakespeare's work.

The story involves, lovers, jealously, magic and trickery. Calista Flockhart does a surprisingly good job as Helena, a woman who pines for Demetrius (a bland Christian Bale), and is a rival of Lysander (and equally bland Dominic West) for the love of Hermia (a nonexistent Anna Friel). While this is going on, King Oberon of the faeries (a suitably handsome and dashing Rupert Everett) is jealous that his Queen Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer, stunning) is not paying him enough attention. So with his right-hand man, Puck (Stanley Tucci), he puts a spell on Titania. Through complicated plot twists, Hermia falls out of favor with both Lysander and Demetrius, a troup of actors, lead by Bottom (Kevin Kline) plan to perform a play; Bottom is turned into an ass; and Titania falls in love with Bottom. The play's convultedness is dizzying, but pretty straight forward to follow.

The set is excellent in its appropriate lushness, and the all-star cast is hit-and-miss. Kline is the best of all, giving nuances to Bottom -- essentially he gives Bottom dignity and makes more than an ass -- Rupert Everett, lounging around half-naked as if he's modeling in a _GQ_ Spread is good as Oberon, though he doesn't have to do much but pout and look handsome -- both of which he does superbly. Flockhart surprises with a deft command of the dialogue and comedy; Tucci is suitably impish as Puck; Pfeiffer as Titania, is impossibly beautiful. Her performance is also very funny, and loose -- to be sure her screen time is limited, but she makes an impact, almost as impressive as Kline's -- and judging from the quality of his performance, that is quite an achievment.",1098316800,6,1832,4.887459807073955
1046926,1,6305554420,"First of all, I am not a Shakespeare afficionado.

The 1935 version of this film is the best one, as far as I am concerned. It is in fact, the only Shakespeare rendition I have ever truly liked. I have loved it since I was a kid.

I watched this new version with my husband when it was first released. I'm not saying it is a bad film, and Kevin Kline is just marvelous in anything he does.

The original film had wonderful cinematography, although I'm sure many people would think it crude and outdated. It was shot using soft focus filters, and other filters that added sparkle and star effects. This gave the film a very magical quality. The new version lacked that entirely. It was just ordinary. There was no magic to it.

Also, this film used only certain pieces from Mendelssohn's exquisite original music. The rest of the score was selections from various operas and other classical pieces.

I wish the original was available on DVD.

1046927,2,6305554420,"This director seems to like pretty colors.

If you are into pretty colors, and if you know nothing about Shakespeare, you will probably like this movie. Shakespeare is so good that even after one of his works has been butchered with a meat cleaver, it still holds up fairly well.

If you know quite a bit about Shakespeare, you will probably hate it. The movie should actually be much funnier than it is, because there are many laughs in the script that were either cut out or performed incorrectly. Particularly annoying is when something really good gets cut (presumably for time) and is replaced by some visual nonsense or discretely-naked people (there are leaves and flowers everywhere, always in just the right place) doing... well, nothing relevant! But there are other examples where characters are either reacting (or not reacting) in a fashion contrary to what Shakespeare meant. For example, in the first scene with Bottom, he should wear much more harshly on everyone's patience. Bottom is, after all, an ""ass,"" and his name is no coincidence. Bottom is the prototypical scene-stealing, self-important actor that Shakespeare warned actors NOT to be in Hamlet, and that Shakespeare obviously decided to make fun of in this play. That scene is extremely well written and should be 4-5 times more enjoyable than it was performed. All the added b.s. did was slow down the pace and distract from the basic gist of the scene. I don't see this as the actors' faults. This one falls squarely on the shoulders of a banal, unintelligent director, who probably didn't even realize all the damage he was doing.

In sum, if you know the play, you will be offended by deletions that seem blasphemous and additions that are pointless and irrelevant. If you don't know the play, you won't know the play has been sullied in this manner, and you may like the visual nonsense, discreetly-naked people, and various other cheap devices.

There is really no attempt to present what Shakespeare actually wrote.  Sure, they use some of his words, but everything is chopped up and made subservient to the visual images (most contrary to Elizabethan theater), and to the limitations of the actors.

It is interesting that the more able the actor the closer their lines match what is in the actual play, and the more we are dealing with a movie or TV star the more impressionistically are the words of Shakespeare used.

One of the problems most movies of Shakespeare have, and this one has in spades, is the variety of accents and style of delivery.  This polyglot casting creates a muddle of meter, rhythm, and pacing.

Am I upset that the movie is in 19th century Italy with bicycles?  Not really, that kind of thing might work, what I am upset about is the causal approach to the true text of Shakespeare.  Certainly, some cuts can work, but this kind of wholesale chopping is just bad and a disservice to our greatest writer.

1046929,5,6305554420,"I watched this DVD by myself, and I think this is the way one should watch movies; no distractions. English is not my native tongue, although I'm totally bilingual (Spanish-English), however I was absolutely enthralled and delighted by Shakespeare's Old English poetry and in the end I think I got all the meanings right. I will not dwell on the content, but in the feelings it provoked, all the time surprising in the plot and development of the story and also in the mostly gratifying performances of the cast. The settings were as they are supposed to be: fantastic and unreal. The final play-within-a-play was superlatively funny. In sum, the movie left me with an ear-to-ear grin and a wholesome good feeling that lasted me all evening and a good part of the next day. I will only say to the other would-be critics that this is a movie best judged by its ability to evoke feelings and less for its technical and/or acting/directing characteristics. A word of caution: Do not try to compare it to a stage play; this is a movie, with the constraints and limitations of movies and also with some advantages over plays, so, oranges vs. apples, different, no? Both can be delicious, each in its own way.

What is a movie for? My opinion: to make you feel something. NOT to satisfy supercilious and punctilious critics. Therefore I rate this as one of the best movies I have ever experienced and I heartily recommend it to most viewers.",1092268800,5,1435,4.67193675889328

I love the language in this.  Typically Shakespearian, it might be pretty hard to understand at times.  But the movie wasn't my disappointment with this disc.
There are NO extras.  You're getting a great, great story done by a star-studded cast and done admirably, but unless you happen to speak french, or just LOVE to tinker with your home entertainment system, then this thing is really lacking in special features.  As a matter of fact there's not even a ""Special Features"" link.  I don't think the damned trailer is even on this disc.
Now that I've griped about it let me reiterate that this is a great movie.  It's the story of 2 couples and some amateur players as well as woodland creatures such as fairies and satyrs.  Stan Tucci sparkles as the protaganist Puck.  Michelle Pfeiffer is radient as the queen of the fairies, Titania, and Kevin Kline is appropriately over-the-top as Nick Bottom.  Puck and Oberon play a joke on Titania by transforming Bottom and charming her eyes to see him as a beautiful creature that she's totally enamored with.  The two couples are involved in a web of he loves her, she loves another and another loves him.  Oberon wants to set the record straight.  Puck mistakes one for the other and the whole story gets turned upside-down and back again in this ancient comedy.  The ending brought a tear to my eye as the unknown actor playing a man playing a woman in a play before the lord of the land steals the whole movie in the final act.
The sights and sounds are euphoric and as star studded as this movie is, it comes as a surprise that not many went to see it in the theater.",1060041600,,1841,4.496987951807229

This isn't always a problem, but ""Midsummer"" is one of Shakespeare's shortest plays, and the text is replaced with an ""opera's greatest hits"" soundtrack and Michelle Pfeiffer's limpid gazing into the camera.  Kevin Kline was born to play Bottom and is worth the time spent watching, but why did the director have to resurrect the old ""Mrs. Bottom"" device to make him seem more ""thoughtful""?  Callista Flockhart is surprisingly appealing as Helena and Rupert Everett well-cast as a smoldering Oberon, but Stanley Tucci's Puck, although he speaks his lines intelligently, is just oddly cast.  I do like the way the fairies are depicted -- lusty, crusty, and musty.  But try the Adrian Noble video from the same year for more ""magical"" production.",1047254400,2,827,5.007299270072993
1046973,3,6305554420,"This production of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is more concerned with visual elements than with the story.  The cast was clearly chosen with an eye towards how they would look, and the costumes and sets drip with sensuality, light and color.  There are more naked scenes in this film than I think I have seen in any other Shakespeare production.  (Artfully covered, of course, but still gratuitous.)  A real Fairy Tale feel, like one would find in a soft-light photograph-series book.
The actors acquit themselves well, with Kevin Kline and Calista Flockhart giving the standout performances as Bottom and Helena.  Flockhart in particular is a pleasant surprise.  Michelle Pfeiffer lends a mature sexuality to Titania and is very appropriate for the role.  Stanley Tucci lacks the sinister quality associated with Puck.  The remaining stable of actors are pretty but not notable.  Max Wright (The dad on ""ALF"") puts in a good turn as Robin Starveling.
All in all, this is a light effort with good points outweighing flaws.  It is fun to watch, and I think that may be the most important thing when dealing with ""A Midsummer Night's Dream.""  Until a better production comes along, this DVD will do nicely.",1032134400,13,1204,4.940298507462686
1046974,4,6305554420,"""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is a fantastic but confusing movie. It's a chaotic film about love, family, friendship, and 19th century family traditions. There's a girl named Hermia and a guy named Demetrius. They're going to get married, but Hermia loves another guy named Lysander. Demetrius loves Hermia and wants to marry her, but before, he had told a girl named Helena that he would get married to her. Helena and Hermia had been friends since they were little. Now Helena's dying to marry Demetrius, and Hermia wants to marry Lysander, but only Demetrius has Hermia's father's permission to marry her, and in the 19th century, if a a daughter didn't want to get married to the guy that her father wanted her to get married to, then her father could kill her, or she had to stay single for the rest of her life. So Hermia and Lysander run away into the forest to be together. Demetrius wants to know where Hermia is, and Helena knows where, and Helena tells Demetrius where they are so that she could get some attention from Demetrius. So they're in the forest with Lysander and Demetrius going after Hermia and Helena going after Demetrius. There's these faries who are there, and the this farie sees this and he says it's all messed up and he tries to fix it, so he tells his ""messenger"" Puck, the put this flower-juice kind of thing on their eyes, and when they get up, they'll fall in love with the first thing they see. Puck messes up with the flower juice, and he puts it on the wrong guy's eye. So what ends up happening is that Demetrius AND Lysander are now in love with Helena, and no one's in love with Hermia. After the farie guy sees that Puck messed up, he asks Puck to fix the mess that he's done, and he makes Lysander fall back in love with Hermia, and now Demetrius loves Helena, and their father ends up finding them, and he finally lets them get married because Lysander loves Hermia, and Hermia loves Lysander and Demetrius loves Helena, and now Hermia, and Helena loves Demetrius. He also has these two ""important people's"" permission to get married as well, who wouldn't let them get married at first. The other story that's also going on in this film is that there's this guy that really wants to be a screenwriiter/actor and he isn't having any success. One day, Puck turns him into a half donkey-half human being, and puts the flower juice on the ""farie queen""'s eyes, and she falls in love with the actor. The guy faerie puts the juice on her eyes again, and she falls in love with the guy faerie. When the actor/screenwriter wannabe wakes up, he finds himself in the middle of nowhere, and he decides the write a story/play on what had just happenned to him. He peforms it, and the audience likes it. So his dream of becoming a screenwriter/actor comes true.",1025913600,,2790,4.526732673267326

The faeries make both Demitrius and Lisander fall for Helena and the other chic is left without a dude. In the end the faeries fix the mess and the two couples go get married and see a play with another high class couple.

1046988,3,6305554420,"I have always been fascinated by Shakespeare. Mind you, I did not say I always understood Shakespeare. When I was in high school, I felt like most of my acquaintances who professed to a deep kinship with the Bard were simply on a pseudo-intellectual head trip. If they weren't, then why did so many of them end up being accountants and bankers? What interested me was that all this playwright's known works remained in circulation for four hundred years. Later in life, I decided that it a combination of great story structure, the ability to write in all genres and a genius in making seemingly timeless observations about mankind's passions and obsessions.
Because of this broadness in Shakespeare's works, modern interpretations can take place in a time period far removed from Elizabethan England. So it is not so inventive that the makers of the new film version of A Midsummer Night's Dream set it in late nineteenth century Italy. The problem is that this setting adds nothing to the story. If anything, it makes the actions of some of the characters seem anachronistic. What saves the movie is the dream sequence, which is what makes the play so magical to begin with. This portion occupies well over half of the running time, and it is delightful. The rest of the film is merely tolerable and very pretty to look at.
For those who are unfamiliar with the plot, here is a quick rundown. King Theseus is about to wed Hippolta, and commands a royal performance be given by local actors. Meanwhile, Hermia's father orders her to wed Demetrius, but she is in love with Lysander. Helena is mad about Demetrius who can't stand her. So, Hermia and Lysander decide to run away. Helena decides to tell Demetrius, and they go off in pursuit. The four young people get lost in a forest at night. The woods are full of spirits and fairies. A spell is cast by the well-meaning Puck, but he bewitches the wrong person. And what about the King's wedding and Hermia's outraged father? All this commotion causes a frightful mess, but this is a comedy. As Shakespeare said, all's well that ends well.
The cast is good on the whole. Kevin Kline is amusing as Nick, one of the local actors. Michelle Pfeiffer is lovely and seductive as Titania, the Queen of the Fairies. The best cast members are easily Rupert Everett [Oberon], Stanley Tucci [Puck and David Straithairn [Theseus]. Quite disappointing is Calista Flockheart, who plays Helena as if she were Ally McBeale doing Shakespeare.
A lot of time and talent was invested in A Midsummer Night's Dream. The result is somewhat less than one would have hoped for, but this is a pleasant enough movie. It knows not to take itself too seriously. The emphasis is on the humor.",1016668800,3,2713,4.725738396624473
1046989,5,6305554420,"This is an absolutely stunning version of ""A Midsummer's Night dream."" In fact, I think it has become my new favorite film!  Hoffman's clear passion shows through in everything, the details and the gestalt.  You just feel that he and the cast were having fun making this dazzler.
Hoffman transposes the play from ancient Greece to 1890's Italy, with new-fangled bicycle almost becoming another character in the play.  Having lived in Portugal for two years, it was sheer eye-delight to seed the familiar old walls and cobblestone streets again!  The city radiates perfect atmosphere, and makes this film not only believable, but also completely watchable.
There is a trend to modernize Shakespeare, and I think it worked in Branaugh's ""Hamlet"" and ""Much Ado,"" and in the DiCapprio ""Romeo + Juliet.""  I think it underscores the timeless nature of Shakespeare's work, since the same situations of the ""Human Predicament"" keep repeating themselves over and over again.  Moreover, his plays are of the highest quality, so the not only stand the test of time, they withstand the test of time.
The center of the play is that weird night in the enchanted forest, which glistens and sheens with a smirk. The costumes are absolutely dazzling, and this film has set a new standard for future Dreams to come.  For some reason, I have always pictured Oberon and Titania as Nordic bullies, but they have cast Rupert Everett and Michelle Pfieffer as the classic Greek gods.
I must give several tips of the hat to Stanley Tucci for bringing new life into Puck.  A balding Puck-who would have imagined that it would work!  And his fuzzy puck legs would normally looks lame, but I am draw into the illusion.
Most people focus on Callista Flockhart.  Not being a fan of (that is never having seen) an episode of Ally McBeal, I can't compare performances.  However, the casting director got it right since, as the insults indicate, Helena was to be a ""painted maypole"" and Hermia was a ""puppet"" and a ""bead"" and ""acron.""  Of course, this Shakespearian insult fest does not compare to King Lear II.ii, but it does combine the verbal hack and slash with a low class, lowbrow, female mud wrestle.  And you can't find higher quality low humor anywhere else.
As to Kevin Klein, I quote from Rodger Ebert's Movie Guide:
""When Kevin Klein is sporting facial hair he must play an eccentric, offbeat goofball (A Fish Called Wanda, I Love You to Death, Soapdish).  To play a serious role he must be clean-shaven (Dave, Sophie's Choice, Grand Canyon, Cry Freedom)."" (p. 103)
Inasmuch as he plays the mule-headed Nick Bottom, this must be the most eccentric, offbeat goofball film he will ever make, barring any cameo as Chewbacca's grandfather in the Star Wars Prequals.
The only complaint that I have is that this film can get a little racy in one or two scenes, but that is why it is rated PG-13, instead of G.  But in the one scene in the forest, Hermia tells, in essence, for Lysander to hold off until they are married. ""Lie further off; in human modesty, Such separation as may well be said Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid.""  And that is the message we really need to get out.  There is more to life than you-know-what!
This is a good copy, and the DVD has the standards, such as chapter selection, subtitles, and, yes, those annoying commercials. Sigh!  There aren't any commentaries, or behind the scenes that would have been nice.  The makeup is incredible in this film, and I would have liked to see more about the evolving concepts of the costumes, and storyboards.

David Strathairn as Theseus has the look of someone  who's mostly thinking about something else--maybe what color upholstery to  get in his new Mercedes.  There is no Theseus here, so there is no grace or  justice in the world of the play.
All of the beautiful symmetry, the  harmony of opposites, the triumphant insistence on the redemptive and  creative power of the loving imagination is ignored or destroyed.  Instead  we get naked mud wrestling (I'm not making this up), a lot of long, loving  closeups of Rupert Everett looking wistful as Oberon, and a soundtrack  composed of every Italian opera chestnut the producers could remember  liking when they heard them in the original commercials.

Rees steals each scene he's in with Kevin Kline,  who just does not quite have the charisma to do Bottom justice. And did we  really need to see Bottom's wife (Who? ) and the mud wrestling? Nope.
Fox  seems to have thought that the play would not be strong enough to carry its  own weight, so they brought in Callista Flockheart and a few other ringers  to draw a younger audience. But by the end of the play, you learn to ignore  her and the others who need more experience before they try doing the Bard  again. I found myself enjoying, instead, the exuberant fun of scenes such  as the play-within-the-play, which is carried off reasonably  well.
Indeed, there are enough redeeming moments in this production to  make it worth a viewing. Michelle Pfeiffer is fabulous as Titania, Stanley  Tucci does an unusually low-key, but delightfully cynical Puck, and I  greatly enjoyed the relocation of the play to Italy at the turn of the 19th  to the 20th century.
