334323,1,6301570723,"Sony has taken note of Warner Archives's success and has now expanded their MOD program to include Blu-Rays. THAT is good news. BUT, the bad news, ...unlike Warners (whose MOD Blu-Rays are factory made, pressed discs), the Sony MOD Blu-Rays will be on BD-Rs. Aside from having a shorter lifespan than pressed discs, the other problem with BD-Rs is that you're paying FULL price for something you could literally make by yourself on your computer. Currently, these Sony MOD Blus are listing at even higher prices than Sony's factory-pressed, non-MOD titles. A shame....hopefully Sony will wise up and transition to pressed discs. Until then, I'll just import the titles I want rather than paying these prices for essentially a homemade product.",1471564800,21,743,5.148760330578512
334324,3,6301570723,"Let me start by saying that I absolutely love the first two Karate Kid film's. They were my childhood, and I would rate them both as solid 5 star movies. The same, however, can not be said for Karate Kid 3, and in truth a 3 star rating is probably a little too generous on my part. Unfortunately there's no option for 2.5, and I feel it's better than a 2, so it gets a 3. Every time I watch this movie I find more problems with it. Ralph Macchio's acting in 3 is his worst yet in the series. His performance is over the top, over dramatic, and for lack of a better word atrocious. I feel like the writer's took everything annoying about Daniel and amplified it by a thousand. He never listen's, and he never thinks before he acts. We learn early in the film that it's Mr. Miyagi's dream is to open a bonsai shop. Daniel suggests that they do it, but Mr. Miyagi says no. Daniel's money is for college education, not for bonsai shop. Daniel, of course, ignores this clear and sane advise, and without hesitation goes and leases a building. Seriously, who does this? Especially when the person they're leasing it for already said no? Daniel also can't seem to understand why Mr. Miyagi doesn't want him to defend his title in the All Valley tournament. Isn't it obvious? The first time he entered the tournament to prove a point, and to overcome adversity. Now it's just Daniel wanting to bask in the glory of winning, and get the attention that comes with being champion one more time (Daniel's reaction at the beginning of the second film when the two kids ask for his autograph more than supports this line of thinking). Yes, later on Daniel has a reason, but in the beginning when he's making a big deal about it to Miyagi he doesn't. Later in the film, after the bonsai shop gets wrecked by Barnes and his goons, and all the trees get stolen Daniel makes yet another foolish decision. Seeing how everything's gone, and they have no money to replace it Daniel decides all on his own to climb down to this cliff side where Mr. Miyagi planted the one true bonsai tree that he brought with him from Okinawa, dig it up, and then sell it to save the shop. Miyagi even tells Daniel that he planted the bonsai where he did so that it would be safe, and nobody would bother it. Daniel's flawed reasoning of course is that since a true bonsai can fetch a pretty penny, Miyagi will see him as a hero for having the forethought to dig up the tree and sell it to save the shop. This is, in my opinion, the stupidest decision Daniel makes in the whole movie. Even his new friend Jessica has enough sense to suggest, repeatedly mind you, that maybe Mr. Miyagi wouldn't want the tree dug up. Daniel vehemently refutes this though. In his eyes he's doing it to save Miyagi's dream, even though he's doing it without ever once stopping to ask what Miyagi wants. I just can't understand how any logical person could ever come to the conclusion that climbing down a cliff side, and digging up a tree that Miyagi obviously cares a lot about was ever a good idea. Then when Daniel finds out that Mr. Miyagi sold his truck to replace the lost inventory Danial has the audacity to ask Mr. Miyagi why he didn't tell him that was what he was going to do. Yeah, that's reasonable. Instead of attacking Mr. Miyagi Daniel should learn to take his own advise. Daniel does acknowledge his stupidity, but it's a small consolation when history shows that Daniel rarely, if ever, learns from his mistakes. The second biggest problem I have with this movie is the villain Terry Silver. This character is completely unnecessary. They should have just had Kreese and Barnes be the villains, and cut the character of Silver out entirely. Thomas Ian Griffith's performance is cartoonish, Maybe it's just the way the character was written, but I honestly cannot think of a word that accurately describes how bad Griffith's performance is, but it's not only that. The whole premise of the character in stupid. Silver's going after Daniel and Miyagi not because he has any real reason to, but because he's friends with John Kreese. That's it. It make no sense. Also, Daniel not being able to see that this guy was manipulating him is maybe the most unbelievable part of the whole movie, and that's saying something. They should have just took out Silver, had Kreese mastermind the plan, and then have Barnes (instead of Silver) pretend to befriend Daniel before ultimately double crossing him. As much as Daniel wanted to do the tournament anyway a little peer pressure from his new friend Barnes would have done just as good, if not better than Barnes bullying him into it. It still wouldn't have been perfect, but it would have been better than what we got. While on the subject of Barnes, Sean Kanan wasn't too bad. If the character had been written better, I think he probably could have done a lot better. He's not the worst part of the movie anyway. Another qualm I have is the under use of Robin Lively as Jessica. Instead of making her an actual love interest for Daniel, Jessica ends up being no more than a space filler, and then ends up leaving town before we ever even get to the tournament. What was the point of having her at all then? The scenes between her and Daniel are good enough. The two clearly had chemistry, but it's a shame that the writers instead decided to have them be just friends..There are more negatives to this movie, namely the cinematography in some of the more climatic moments, and to a lesser extent the fight choreography, but I've pointed out the worst. The best part about Karate Kid 3 is without question Pat Morita. It's sad that a top notch performance such as his ends up being overshadowed by how bad this movie is. Martin Kove as John Kreese also delivered a solid performance, even if he was severely under utilized. As good as the first two Karate Kid's were I feel like this movie had the potential to be good as well, it just failed miserably at it. I've heard people say that they should have stopped after two, but I disagree. They should have tried harder. When you see the end result it's hard to imagine that they were trying to deliver a satisfying sequel. It's hard to imagine that they were trying at all.",1470268800,3,6225,4.495145631067961

334361,4,6301570723,Karate Kid 3 is strangely disliked. I never really understood it personally. I think it comes very close to the greatness of the first 2. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because the end fight isn't very good. It portrays Daniel as not very good at Karate and isn't able to handle his opponent which doesn`t make sense considering how well he did in the fight at the end of part 2 with an opponent who was even more vicious. Other than that I think its a solid conclusion to one of the greatest on screen friendships in movie history. Thomas Ian Griffith is great and steals every scene he`s in as the head villain of the movie as well.,1457136000,5,642,4.185483870967742

334438,2,6301570723,"Most audiences can accept the fact that sequels are rarely as good as the original.  However, this film has several flaws and issues that make it difficult to enjoy.  One of the biggest issues is the development of the main character, Daniel.  Despite all of his challenges and experiences, Daniel has not matured or grown spiritually since the first film; he still lacks confidence in almost every aspect of his life, including his martial arts skills.  It would be a natural assumption that after his victories and training Daniel would be able to handle himself better.  Instead he comes across as an unprepared and weak kid, almost the exact same person he was in the beginning of the first movie.  He continues to act impulsive and indecisive, which is a little irritating since we've been seeing this behavior during the whole KK franchise.  It's as if Mr. Miyagi's training and philosophical lessons have been a waste of time.

The second major issue is the acting.  There are times when the actors seem to be going through the motions and other times when they seem to be overdoing it.  The confrontation in the dojo with all three villains just becomes ridiculous and the over the top laughter and goofy tone of the scene ruin the atmosphere.  The girl who plays Daniel's love interest just seems boring and she adds nothing to the film except filling the role of an obligatory female friend.  (Not to mention the fact that every girl who comes into Daniel's life breaks up with him, so it's getting a little ridiculous to add a love interest in this movie.)

The final climax scene in the tournament is just a rehash of the first movie's climax.  Daniel shows no technical proficiency or defensive expertise of any kind.  We're again forced to see some magical gimmick technique used to defeat the bad guy.  It was OK the first two times, but I was hoping to see Daniel step up and prove that he can win on his own merit without relying on Mr. Miyagi every 20 seconds.

To sum it up, this movie falls short.  For fans of the series, it's worth watching once. But it's not one for your collection.",1424217600,2,2106,4.615591397849462
334439,3,6301570723,"...the heading (and quote from the movie) says it all.

Bad acting.

Unintentionally funny.

Has a slight homosexual vibe to it that I wasn't banking on (not that there's anything wrong with that), due to the bizarre attention from Daniel-San's (many) male antagonists, who seem to have nothing else to do but completely fixate on him.  It's evil that's nearly orgasmic to the villains and cartoonish in its depiction, which makes this movie somewhat squirm-worthy to watch.

The Karate Kid is easily pushing 30 and has gained a noticeable amount of weight since the first movies.  He pleads, whines, runs around in a tizzy, blows his top, apologizes frantically, or seems to be always in an otherwise loud and overacted state of heightened anxiety for much of the movie. I saw somewhere that Ralph Macchio didn't want any romantic scenes with his ""girlfriend"" so his wife didn't get jealous...maybe the tension caused him to nearly explode from the stress?

Mr. Miyagi is the rock of the film, but is sort of a strange presence, glancing in a concerned way at Daniel and is antics, etc. In contrast to Daniel, he's Mr. Cool.

Terry Silver, the ascot-wearing Steven Seagal ripoff, and billionaire predator, hisses with laughter and casts many an evil glance as his clever, diabolical scheme unfolds!

The karate moves are geriatric in motion, scripted and stiff.

A sad ending to the Karate Kid franchise, which seemed to get it right with the first two flicks. But still, sorta fun to watch for a few laughs when catching a re-run. Three stars.",1423353600,,1545,4.862595419847328

First the moment they come back from Okinawa, the apartment complex is sold and MIyagi ends up out of a job. Daniel gives his college savings to Miyagi to start his own business, which fails immediately and both of them are impoverished. Secondly Daniel's new arch enemy, unlike the ones in the first two who are dead serious about coming after him, this one I find is a spoiled rich wise guy behaving extremely childish. Even the returning Sensei Kreese acts like a big baby in this one. I don't recall how this film did with critics and otherwise when it came into the theaters. As far as I'm concerned it's a flop.

334479,3,6301570723,"The Karate Kid Part III is the second sequel to the hit motion picture The Karate Kid. The story picks up when Daniel La Russo goes against the wishes of his mentor,Mr. Miyagi. He will defend his karate title in an All-Valley Championship match arranged by his nemesis Kreese,whose karate studio folded after his star student lost the championship to Daniel. Kreese's friend, Vietnam veteran and toxic waste dumper Terry, agrees to help his old pal regain the championship trophy. Mike Barnes,who happens to be his rival, is known as ""the bad boy of karate,"". For this reason, he feels he requires more training to vanquish him. But Mr. Miyagi refuses to help Daniel train for the tournament: ""Karate to defend life and honor means something. To defend a plastic trophy means nothing."" As a result, Daniel naively falls into the clutches of Terry, who takes him on as a karate student. But after Daniel finds himself trapped at the bottom of a cliff and Daniel's girlfriend, Jessica, has her life threatened. After this incident,Mr. Miyagi realizes the bad guys have gone too far and agrees to coach Daniel for the tournament. And everyone knows that Daniel fights Mike Barnes and beats him in the end.

The second sequel evidently has gone far off. It should have ended after the first sequel. The third movie just goes through the same elements of a Karate Kid movie. The screenplay has run out of steam that this film got nominated for the Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. As for the performances,both Macchio and Morita have already looked tired and weary performing the same roles. They lacked enthusiasm and interest which the viewer could feel as both actors earned a Razzies nomination for Worst Actor for Macchio and Worst Supporting Actor for Morita. Ultimately,this film is only good for fans of the Karate Kid Movies and it cult followers. Overall,it destroyed the third film is a disaster.",1415836800,,1917,4.880368098159509

334548,3,6301570723,"OK.  This really should have been the second in the series, since, like in my review for ""Karate Kid 1"" (KK1) I complained that Ralph Macchio didn't go all Charles Bronson on his ""friends,"" and in this one he almost does.  But without giving too much away, I finally got my wish in ""Karate Kid 3"" (KK3).

Well, maybe I didn't really get my wish per se.  But it is the thought that counts.  Mr. Macchio ""goes to the dark side"" here, kind of like Tobey Maquire did in ""Spider Man 3"" (SM3) and there are quite a few similarities between the two much-maligned films.

SM3 went a little slapstick, a little corny, and I believe that KK3 at least is a little corny.  Watch the over-the-top acting by Thomas Ian Griffith as an example.  Man, I tell you this:  if the Devil Himself ran into Mr. Griffith while this film was in production, Satan would have shook his head, put up his hands, and complained, ""Man, he's just TOO bad-a** for me"" and then just walked away.  Mr. Griffith played the character with a little too much caricature, but we needed the evil villain, so, I guess it worked here.

And just like SM3, I do think that Mr. Macchio had a love interest, but I can't remember too much of it.  After all, he was too busy creating his Evil Plans of Revenge to think about hanging out with somebody like, oh, why not Elizabeth Shue?  (That would work, although I would prefer Hillary Swank myself, who's been discussed before, and will be discussed again.  I promise you that.)  But I have complained many times before that Americans always demand a love interest in film, even when it's unnecessary; I think that a love interest sometimes just gets in the way.  Without giving other stuff away -- like I wrote in the first paragraph -- let's just say that Mr. Macchio may or may not have a change of heart by the end of this film when it comes to kicking his ""friends"" a**.

Blaming Daniel and Miyagi for the loss of his karate school, the revenge-obsessed sensei asks evil martial arts master Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith) to help him win back the All Valley Championship and avenge his honor.

334591,5,6301570723,"Karate Kid 3 is an underrated film, and I would even consider it to be a great film. You just need to really understand what it's about. Karate Kid 3 is, at its heart, a story about true friendship, loyalty, and the lengths that a true friend will go to help another friend, regardless of how far he's fallen.  It's a great example for us all, really.

The story centers around Terry Silver, President of Dynatox Industries and a man who has made the most of himself in every sense. It follows his efforts to help his friend and mentor who has fallen on hard times, Sensai John Kreese. The two work together (along with some help from Mamona) to pick up the pieces of Kreese's life and get him on the right track. They also look to balance the scales on the wrongs inflicted upon Mr Kreese by those two jerks, whatshisname Miyagi and that punk kid.

Terry Silver's generosity knows no bounds; whether he's sending his friend to Tahiti, giving 50% ownership of his new dojo business away to a 17 year old kid he just met, or giving some cash to a lowlife in a club that just got rejected by a woman, the man is truly magnanimous. He also shows the drive and dedication it takes to be successful in this world: while masterminding the harassment of the old man and that punk kid, he also finds time to bribe the grand jury, has Willie the DA over for pouched salmon, and arranges the dumping of the chloride sludge in Borneo (where no one knows what chloride sludge is). Along with being a great friend, he is also a captain of industry.

I don't want to spoil too much of the plot, but rest assured that seeing Silver's plan unfold is truly a joy to watch. Building on the theme of friendship, we also get to see a new friendship bloom between two other characters, Mike Barnes and Snake (and Dennis too!). These guys are just really cool.  You get the sense it would be a blast to hang out with these guys, whether they're visiting a bonsai shop or taking a drive out to the country to watch the rock climbers. Fun times had by all.

The greatest scene in the movie is in the Cobra Kai dojo, when the punk kid tries to back out of the tournament in a most cowardly fashion, and after Terry Silver had been training him for free! Turns out, nothing's for free, and the following scene makes for some great comic relief moments in the film. The viewer watching the film cannot help but laugh and cackle along with Silver and Kreese during this scene; their laughter is truly infectious. Even after the old man shows up and spoils the party, the friends still find a way to laugh, making lemons into lemonade once again.

My only critique of this gem is that I found the last 30 seconds of the film to be wholly unsatisfying. After watching Mike Barnes put on an amazing show of physical exhibition, the punk kid gets a cheap shot last second point that somehow wins him the tournament despite him not scoring another single point on Barnes or anyone else the entire night! Ridiculous and far fetched, but I think the intent was to show that the best laid plans often go awry, and in life sometimes we have to accept disappointment.

The rest of the movie is superb, powered by the performances of Kreese, Barnes, Snake, Dennis, and most of all Silver. It teaches us the lengths that a true friend will go to help another friend, and Terry Silver is an example for us all.  With the exception of the disappointing and improbable ending, this film is, in a word, perfect.",1365206400,2,3467,4.396255850234009

334594,2,6301570723,"I will admit that The Karate Kid III had its moments, like the very end of the movie when Daniel's graceful, finesse type-moves are superior to the overly-aggressive and physical showcase of his opponent. I thought this ending proved a point and was interesting. However, this movie fails in many ways. First of all, how stupid can Daniel and Miyagi be when someone suddenly appears on their property and tells a wild tale about an instructor dying, and dropping off a book, or this guy who happens to be everywhere Daniel is, and the things that always seem to go wrong in his presence. This movie isn't believable, simply put. Oh, and the insistence that Daniel sign the paper to enter him into the karate championship and the way it was accomplished (pulling ropes up a canyon cliff and stranding Daniel and his friend until it's signed) is very tacky at best, and again makes the viewer wonder how these guys have such mental powers as to people's whereabouts, even in the most unusual places. So, if you're wanting to get into the Karate Kid trilogy, I would definitely recommend the first movie. I pretty much recommend the second movie, though it has it's flaws, while the third movie could provide some comic relief, but not in a good way.",1359936000,2,1247,4.672727272727273

334651,1,6301570723,"I'm absolutely DISAPPOINTED. They took Danny and reduced him to nothing.

That's how I felt back then when I watched this GARBAGE, and that's how I still feel watching it today. After winning the tournament in KK1 and defeating a fearsome opponent in KK2, you would think Danny would come home stronger, wiser, more disciplined and tougher.

Unfortunately, this is not the case.

Daniel has gone from strong and courageous in KK2 (he almost killed Chozen) to an overweight, weak, whiny, immature and plain ANNOYING sad sack. He won't stop babbling, he's obsessed with Mac n' cheese, he seemed to forget all of Miyagi's training and you can't help but feel PITY for him. Not to mention, his once powerful sensei Mr. Miyagi has gone from peaceful, powerful motivator to an aloof standby who forgot how to teach Danny to defend himself from the SADISTIC henchmen out to force him into signing up for a tournament similar to KK1. Miyagi's fire has been almost extinguished.

Then there are the Cobra Kai adversaries (aka Satan's human henchmen). Terry Silver (Thomas Griffith) is a cackling, pony-tailed billionaire toxic waste dumper with nothing better to do than seek ""revenge"" against Danny for standing up for himself in KK1 and bankrupting his now-broke Vietnam buddy John Kreese's (Martin Kove) Cobra Kai dojo, whom all his students have departed from. Kreese seemed to reform, but gets brainwashed into Silver's evil scheme.

Silver hatches a plan to make Daniel suffer by feignly cozying up to him, while siccing his new fighter Mike Barnes (Sean Kanan) and his cronies onto Daniel daily, forcing him to sign up. Daniel's lack of cooperation leads to him being constantly pulverized, beaten and humiliated by Barnes. I had a very hard time watching our once glorious hero reduced to a rag doll on so many occasions.

The acting is very poor and WAY over the top. Aside from Daniel's annoying babbling, the bad guys are very one-dimensional and irritating in their own ways. Silver makes goofy smiles and laughs dementedly. Kreese shows some believable emotion at the beginning, but then became another sadistic chicken-laugher who gets joy from Daniel's torture. Barnes is only one channel: Angry-faced psychotic who just wants to kill Daniel because he's interrupting ""his financial future."" In KK1, some of the Cobra Kai showed compassion, and even Johnny did at the end. This added depth was absent in KK3, and it had a negative effect on me. It was all just flat.

As the movie (and the heartache) goes on, you're praying for Danny to finally stop taking the abuse already. You want Miyagi to give tough training and for Barnes to get destroyed in typical '80s fashion....But it never happens. The abuse continues well into the tournament until Danny pulls off a fluke kata move and wins with trophy in hand. But you don't FEEL the win like before. It's more like ""that's it??? Just a kata???"" I ended up hanging my head in disappointment.

It's just a shame that the series was ended off like this. Instead of our hero maturing into a stronger person, the producers went in the opposite direction.  Even the enemies could've gotten a character overhaul to seem more authentic.

Let this be a lesson to movie directors on how NOT to finish off a movie trilogy.",1301702400,4,3269,4.873873873873874
334652,1,6301570723,"Wow, they don't know when to quit making these do they?(To answer the question that should have been after the 1st one) By this film it became painfully obvious that Ralph Machio CANNOT ACT. He was beebopping all over the place in this entire film, he looked like a 4 year old with ADHD who had too much pixie sticks. His constant bouncing was the most painful thing about this film.

Next the girl was horrendous. Not even pretty, and had a boyfriend already! Why the crap is she taking up space in the film. I would have loved to see Mr. Muyigi pop out of nowhere when the girl said that she had a boyfriend, hear some action/badguy music playing, have Muyigi say ""Daniel Son, watch out!"", and then have Mr. Muyigi proceed to kick the crap out of her. Afterwards he would say ""You very lucky Daniel Son that Muyigi near. Now we do not have to waste anymore of movie on her."" ""Gee thanks Mr. Myuigi"" says Hyper Son as he bounces up and down.

Next the badguys: Way over-the-top. We have gone from Daniel fighting local highschool bullies to fighting Satan. These guys were just evil. At least Johnny had a change of heart in the first film. I suspect that these guys probably hung outside of the arena after the tournament, and waited with AK-47s. And what was up with these goons constanty harrasing Daniel, and the cops doing nothing? In real life you call the cops after the first time they harras you, and the police will hunt them down. Instead it was like ""Gee these guys are constantly vandalizing my store, and all I can do is sit here and watch my non-girlfriend get kicked in the stomach. Oh well.""

Finally, the final fight scene: We all know the formula, Daniel will bust out some ""secret, special"" move at the end to win it all, but did he need a special move? He went from being able to almost murder Chozen, a karate ninja master, second best karate fighter in Japan after Myigig, who's body looked like an NFL players, to not being able to put a finger on this new Johnny look-alike. So stupid. And what was up with his ""secret"" move? He starts doing kata, and the final bully is like ""Woa man. I'm all weirded out and confused."" I'm sure in real life that guy would have just given Daniel Son a hard kick right in his stomach. But instead it discombobulates the thug, and Daniel lands a puch to the chest. Daniel should have just put on a pink tutu and start prancing like a balerena to confuse him.

Some loser-looking multi-billionaire who was in vietnam spends ALL of his time with his seemingly love interest buddy Reese harass some kid (Daniel) just because he wants to sign up more karate students?  And they're over-the-top insane with it to the point of hysterical laughing, etc.  And kata wins the tournament?  Sheesh.

334657,1,6301570723,"This movie is so bad, that it always makes me laugh.

It's really hard to believe that only 1 year has passed since Daniel defeated William Zabka (kinda weird because Macchio looked like a high school kid against a full grown man from some university).

This time Daniel looks much much older (and really fat at 28) than just a year before, but even like that, he looks again physically smaller and weaker than Mike Barnes, our new thug... A too high-strung gorilla that kicks Daniel's butt almost 95% of the movie and keep screaming lines like ""I own you, Larusso"" (a really annoying guy that won't live much if he keeps being like that).

By the way, Daniel looked equally smaller and weaker than Sato's muscled nephew in KK2. But I guess his karate was better then and that's why he put the asian dude to sleep (temporarily) at the end of that movie.

Anyway, I keep wondering why the hell does Daniel keep Mr. Miyagi as his instructor?

Because his karate it's only good for tournaments. In real life it's useless against Billy Sabka (KK1 thug), Yuji Okumoto (KK2 thug) and the mentioned Barnes (KK3 thug), that keep banging his arse almost during the whole movies! And I'm pretty sure that those bastards waited for him outside, after the duel, to keep banging him like a big band drum.

I think he would have had better results joining the Cobra Kai Dojo.

Or maybe - this is a better explanation - Daniel as a student sucked bad, because Mr. Miyagi, being older and smaller, always kicked the whole bunch's butt by himself, in every movie, without help (?).

Finally, I hope Daniel San forgot everything about that damned karate and looked for a real job, because karate has only brought woe to his life: abandoned by his mother, trashed by bullies, dropped by girlfriends and stalked by psychopathic instructors.

The whole sense of this movie can be seen at the end, when everybody begins to throw Cobra Kai t-shirts over the heads of Terry Silver & John Kreese... Kreese, angrily overreacts and threatens the people near with the back of his hand. An old lady in front of him, just laughs in his face.",1280016000,2,2111,4.593085106382978

After the surprising smash successes of the first two ""Karate Kid"" movies(even the first one was not expected to be a massive hit)the staleness starts to creep in to the continuing story in this, the series' third installment.

Back for his final time as Daniel Larusso is Ralph Macchio, practically grimacing his way through the cliched script.  Also back are Pat Morita as Miyagi and Martin Kove as John Kreese, the violent leader of the Cobra Kai dojo in the first movie. Adding a new angle is Thomas Ian Griffith as Terry Silver, an old friend of Kreese's intent on helping him get revenge for his humiliation at the hands of Daniel and Miyagi.  Additionally, Robyn Lively plays the obligatory love interest for Daniel, and Sean Kanan is Mike Barnes, the thickheaded mercenary brought in by Kreese and Silver to torment Daniel and take his karate championship.

The main positive point of this movie is in the script's reinforcement of the remarkable relationship between Daniel and Miyagi, whose chemistry and love for each other is as strong as ever.  They even go into business together in this film, setting up a bonsai store, and the pain of later conflict is well-played by both actors.  However, huge weak spots in the script include the Mike Barnes character.  The presence of Martin Kove's Kreese underlines the absence of William Zabka's Johnny Lawrence, Kreese's main student and Daniel's top antagonist in the first film.  Mr. Kanan just does not have the same magnetism or acting chops of his predecessor to make the similarity between the characters work in a positive way.

While I am a fan of the ""Karate Kid"" franchise, this movie should be found lacking in many respects.  However, it is still better than the terrible ""The Next Karate Kid.""  Still, this movie is simply not necessary after the first two classic films.",1264896000,,1858,4.882165605095541

No more wax on wax off, it's time to break some wood and noses! Of course eventually Miyagi's way causes Daniel to win the tournament, but anyone who does Karate knows that Kata doesn't help you win a Kumite tournament. You can win a Kata tournament if you perform Kata well, but you certainly cannot win a Kumite tournament using the Kata techniques because it's a completely different ball game.

The fact that the uber-rich and powerful Silver drops everything in his life to focus on terrorizing a teenage karate tournament is just awesome.

334728,3,6301570723,"Karate Kid III has gotten a lot of play time on cable TV, which is where I first saw it. Not nearly as beloved as the previous two installments for a variety of reasons it's generally panned as being cartoonishly acted and using the same basic formula as it's predecessors. Ralph Macchio returns as the getting older but seldom wiser Daniel while Pat Morita resumes the role of the sagely guiding force of Mr. Miyagi.

First off, despite my 3 star rating, I actually *did* enjoy this movie. There are parts in the movie that really shine and then others that are slogged down by what can only be described as the result of over the top acting and in may ways a really weak script. It's a pretty simple plot that can be described in a single paragraph.

Daniel and Mr. Miyagi return from Okinawa (the events of which are barely mentioned) and Daniel is about to go to college. Mr. Miyagi discovers that his previous job, handyman at the apartment/motel of KK1, has essentially ceased to exist, so Daniel uses his college money to buy Mr. Miyagi a bonsai tree shop. The All-Valley Karate Tournament is due to begin again and while initially determined to participate Daniel eventually opts out so that he can help Mr. Miyagi with his shop. Meanwhile John Kreese, the villainous sensei of the Cobra Kai dojo (of the first film) loses his business and opts to move on with his life before being dissuaded by his Vietnam War buddy, Terry Silver, who happens to be some sort of free enterprise mogul with a focus on dumping hazardous waste. The two plot revenge on Daniel (and by extension Mr. Miyagi) by making him enter the tournament and adminstering an excruciating public arsebeating there.

First off, despite what anyone else has said Thomas Ian Griffith really shines as main villain Terry Silver. Despite his malicious intent the man had charisma in spades and I got a real kick out of watching him wheel and deal, and in the end found myself rather liking the guy. Say what you want, he is a man that is loyal to his friends, kind to his employees, and makes things happen, and that says a lot about him. He is able to do a real good job screwing around with Daniel's mind (which isn't that hard, really) and I found myself half pulling for him since the character of Daniel, played by Ralph Macchio, has not really developed or matured, despite this being his 3rd movie. Daniel really deserves his own paragraph, so here goes.

Daniel still flies off the deep end anytime anything happens and I find it extremely annoying that despite his having achieved peace through his karate, not to mention having the coolest sensei this side of the Pacific Ocean, he never really seems to learn. He is impulsive, impudent, immature, and ultimately just a general purpose pain in the (censored). In the Star Wars universe this kid would have turned Sith long ago. You get the idea. He needed a hardcore beatdown in this movie to put his head back in place and I'm glad to see it given, despite it being at the hands of uber-bully Mike Barnes (played by Sean Kanan). It just astounds me that as much time as Daniel spends with Mr. Miyagi he just doesn't seem to absorb any of his wisdom. Not to mention I think Daniel may have been stealing a few Mallomars in this movie as he's substantially more ""puffy"" than for the previous two incarnations.

When Daniel decides not to participate in the tournament he is hounded (some would say stalked) by Barnes and his henchmen ""Snake"" (not ""Snake Plissken"", although that would have made for a much more interesting plot), and some other guy who gets his behind handed to him several times. These three ultimately get Daniel to sign into the tournament through coercion and thus Daniel is forced to find a new trainer when Mr. Miyagi won't train him. That new trainer happens to be Terry Silver, who works his magic by really twisting Daniel's gi in a bunch. His training regimen is pretty sadistic and involves Daniel inflicting some pretty impressive power with the end result being that Daniel becomes something of a bigger jerk than he started. When Daniel has an attack of conscience Silver springs both Barnes and the believed to be deceased John Kreese on him. All this subterfuge (getting a different trainer without Miyagi's knowledge)on Daniel's part hurts the relationship between he and Mr. Miyagi and this element, and the eventual repair of it, makes up much of the movie.

Each movie seems to have it's signature karate ""move"" and this one is a little different from the previous two. Daniel practices something called ""kata"" with Mr. Miyagi and this is supposed to bring his fighting actions into focus. While not as catchy as the Crane from KK1 or the mega-dodge technique of KK2, this serves it's purpose for the point of the movie. I was half hoping to see Daniel wail on Barnes in the last round with some outrageous Pele bicycle kick style assault, or what not, but that's not to be found here.

KK3 isn't a bad movie. It is fun to watch and doesn't require too much thinking and that makes it a perfect popcorn cruncher for a weeknight. Thomas Ian Griffith was great to watch and I think that if you can get past his Snidely Whiplash laughter you'll find the guy is actually, for lack of a better phrase, kind of cool. Not as bad as many would have you believe, but not anywhere near a 5-star movie like others say too.",1227225600,35,5377,4.594791666666667

334731,3,6301570723,"3 1/2 would probably be more accurate. I think the biggest problem with this movie is not so much the content, as its bad timing. In the excellent Part 1, Daniel had to fight in a tournament to show he could stand up for himself. In the impressive Part 2, the stakes were raised, and Daniel had to fight for his life as well as the life of his friend. Part 3 has the difficult (if not impossible) burden of trying to create a plausible fear in Daniel over fighting in a tournament again after having fought a life and death battle. This movie would have probably done much better if it had been placed between 1 and 2. Moving on, the psychotic, but defanged Kreese goes back to his abandoned dojo and decides his situation is bleak enough to consider some new life. (Despite his psychotic cruelty in Part 1, we are permitted a moment of sympathy for him.) His friend Terry Silver promises revenge on Daniel and Myagi. While Kreese was psychotic, Silver is more of a smiling politician everready to backstab Daniel after winning his trust. Silver's plan is to hire this, for the lack of a better term (jerk) Mike Barnes to bully Daniel into a new tournament so Barnes can beat him publicly. (Kind of weak after the strong plots in parts I and II.) Barnes is REALLY the WEAK LINK in this movie. Unlike Part I's Johnny, Barnes has no redeeming moments to make him human. Unlike Part II's Chozen, Mike Barnes carries no charm. I may also add that we can speculate that Chozen (who Daniel beat in life and death) would have destroyed Barnes. Moving on, Silver's plan is to cause a rift between Myagi and Daniel, train Daniel himself, and watch him fall. Interesting, but there are flaws and questions. Why does Myagi refuse to train Daniel if he is being persued and threatened? Silver may be going against Myagi's training, but Silver is also giving Daniel a brutal edge he could use against Barnes. Without going on too long, Myagi + Daniel reconcile and we see the final conflict between the styles of Silver and Myagi. While III is not perfect, and certainly not as good as I or II, it is actually full of good moments as well as a theme on the corruption of the schools. I may also add that despite its faults, III is still much better than ""The Next Karate Kid.""",1210896000,2,2263,4.4423076923076925
334732,4,6301570723,"When reading several of the 5 star reviews, somehow I got the feeling I was being conned into thinking this movie was the best ever, or the ""reviewer"" was being sarcastic. Since I can't give it 3.5 stars, I rounded it up to 4.

Realistically, all the KK movies were playing to a younger audience. In my opinion young teens would enjoy them the most.  But it doesn't change the fact that the first 3 KK movies were excellent for what they were.  The 1st was original and unique.  The same formula worked in the first 3, but part 3 was my favorite for many reasons.

I first heard about KK3 because my boss's son, Sean Kanan (born Sean Perelman) played Mike Barnes, ""Karate's bad-boy"" in this installment.  I enjoyed the first 2 movies, so I borrowed Part 3 from my boss's brother (Sean's uncle).  I was pleasantly surprised with the entire movie.  It was very different and real... in the emotional presentation and conflict.  Same formula as the first 2.  The story was very well crafted and similar to 1 and 2, but different enough that it stands on its own.

The acting could have been a bit less cartoonish in some parts from the two dimentional bad guys, but it was the relationship between Miyagi and Daniel, and Daniel and his new female friend, which held the movie together.

The new girl in the movie wasn't a love interest.  She was only there as a friend, which I really appreciated.  They didn't force anything between the two of them. That is something rare in modern movies, for a boy and girl to just share some time together as friends ... in between Daniel's training and getting his butt kicked.

But what stole the movie was what was going on between Miyagi and Daniel.  Daniel was being bullied by Barnes into entering the All Valley tournament again, and to Daniel it seemed simple enough: enter and fight, win or lose, it was better than getting beat up over and over and over again.  But Miyagi's way is to not give in to terrorism, so he refused to train Daniel to fight his new adversary.  Miyagi believes that by giving in, those terrorizing you win.  But in the end, Miyagi and Daniel see the real reason why Daniel MUST fight this unbeatable opponent.

It comes together perfectly... for what it is... a KK movie.  I can see most reviewers might be comparing it to some high action or drama movies, which are in a different league than the KK movies.  I give Part 1, 4.5 stars.  Part 2, 4 stars. And part 3, 3.5 stars... Part 3 gets a lower rating simply because the main bad guy, Silver, acts as if he was plucked out of a bad episode of 60's Batman, playing the role of Riddler.

So, laugh at the typical over the top portrayal of Silver, but if you liked the other KK movies, this one wraps up the story of Daniel very well... until someone makes ""Daniel LaRusso"", Starring an old Macchio, coming out of retirement, still looking like he's 18, just to see if he can win the All Valley one last time.  Sorry, I said there would be no sarcasm.  I couldn't help it.  But seriously, I loved this movie.",1209945600,2,3029,4.410810810810811
334733,1,6301570723,"This is possibly one of the worst films ever made. There's not even the ""so bad it's good"" pleasure to count on. It's simply a grotesque mishandling of every truth laid down in the first (and quite wonderful) film. It's an ugly movie that basically has our hero Daniel being hounded by an ex-military buddy of Kreese's. They hatch a stupid scheme to get Daniel back for the loss of Kreese's students and school. Daniel is periodically attacked by warped students of the ex-buddy's (his name escapes me, so bad was this thing) who want him to defend his title in the tournament. After much abuse, he agrees, to the chagrin of Mr. Miyagi.
They throw in a pseudo love interest (that goes nowhere), Kreese's character, which was very interesting in the first film, has been debased to scary B-movie proportions, and poor Mr. Miyagi is the only one who comes off with any dignity whatsoever. The villain (ex-military buddy) is so boring it isn't even funny (not to mention the actor who plays him is awful).
This could have been an interesting film - it has some good potential plot points, such as Daniel turning against the truths laid down by Miyagi and shacking up with the villain. But it squanders them all - more like annihilates them in a nuclear fashion. This could have been a noble film, maybe to the point of having Kreese's character redeemed. Instead it's just a stupid, sordid, complete waste of time - I'd call it a C-film that wants to be a hammy B-film.

The story should've ended after the sequel it had nowhere to go. I thought the sequel was actually better than the first, It had more deeper story going into Miyagi's past and as opposed to being just about a tournament, this story was about life and death. Somehow in the third movie, Daniel went from the guy who beat Chosen a Japanese Karate master in a battle to the death, to someone who couldn't even  stand in the ring with this karate student under 18 chap back home.

334771,2,6301570723,"What better way to end the saga of Daniel LaRusso than a final installment in `The Karate Kid Part III'. There was only one major problem...it was a great idea done terribly wrong. The story takes place right after Part II, where a sinister plot is hatched by the true villain of `The Karate Kid' saga, John Kreese. John pays a visit to Terry Silver, fellow soldier turned millionaire scumbag and loyal Cobra Kai. Kreese tells Terry of his downfall thanks to Daniel and Mr. Miyagi and Terry is more than willing to help his friend get his revenge. They hire a violent up and coming fighter named Mike Barnes to force Daniel to fight him for the All Valley Tournament title. Daniel is still true to the Miyagido style of karate and would rather spend his days helping Mr. Miyagi with their new business in Banzai trees. When Daniel is threatened under unavoidable circumstances, Terry jumps in to pose as a friend and teacher to Daniel. Learning a new more violent style of karate from Terry causes extreme tension between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. For too long Miyagi taught Daniel that Karate was not about defending a title and Daniel is torn apart wondering why he has strayed from his friends teachings. No sooner when Daniel discovers that he was played for sap, Mr. Miyagi  re-unites with Daniel not for revenge, but to prove the point that has been shown throughout the entire saga. One must be pure in heart and true to his honor in order to emerge a champion.

I gave this film a low rating because the movie as a whole did not live up to the plot. What knocks Part III down from the rest of the story is the sub par acting. `The Karate Kid Part III' comes off looking a lot like `3 Ninjas', with its cartoonish villainy and Ralph Macchio just whines too much. Not even the heavy use of adult language and the major role of John Kreese could save this movie. This movie could have been made much better because the premise of this story is quite good and it does work. I guess it was the staff, letting the movie going public know it was time to put an old dog to sleep. Unfortunately they didn't, but I'm not even going there. If you are a fan of `The Karate Kid' as a whole you will watch this movie more than once and really make an effort to enjoy it.

334772,2,6301570723,"Well this was just bad.  I guess they felt as they had done a second movie, someone said we should just put a period on the sentance and make another.  But this was just bad, wrapping up all elements of the first and second into too neat a bundle.

Daniel (who is probably about 40 by the time this movie was made) and Miaghi have returned from Okinawa to California having settled the business in Miaghi's hometown.  While they were gone, Kreese, the evil sensai from the Cobra Kai dojo has hit rock bottem.  After being disgraced at the tournament by the loss as well as his sore loser behavior, Kreese has lost his shirt.  Cobra Kai has closed due to lack of enrollment, and he's bankrupt.  Out of the blue, he meets up with an old buddy (from his days in Nam, no less) who looks like a young, thin Steven Segal who not only takes him in but agrees to plot revenge against Daniel and Miaghi.  (I won't repeat his notable quotables, as they were just too corny.)

Daniel is once again the target of bullies, this time Kreese's renegad students who are causing havok among the town.  They don't feel any qualms about beating up girls and kids that are smaller than them.  What tough guys.  When Daniel asks Miaghi to train him again, Miaghi refuses because he wants Daniel to not aspire to title and reward, but to be a true artist.  In an uncharacteristic move, Steven Segal offers to train Daniel to become a killing machine, and Daniel accepts it.  Once the plot against him is reveiled, Miaghi trains Daniel to win the tournament.

The whole plotting and revenge was a little too hoakey for me.  By the time this movie got made there were a lot of action-revenge type movies out there (ex. Jean Claude Van Damme's and Steven Segal's movie careers), but as we felt we knew Daniel pretty well by then it was disappointing to see him give into evils and temptations.  There was the proverbial happy ending, but they had done the Rocky story so many times in these movies that you expected nothing but a happy ending.  If you feel you want to see Daniel triumph over the bullies yet again, then watch this because good will always triumph over evil somehow.",1131408000,4,2158,4.461734693877551
334773,3,6301570723,"And here's where the wheels started to come off. Macchio was in his late twenties when Part 3 went into production, and that's only the most obvious evidence that this unnecessary sequel was a low-rent money-grab of the flimsiest order. What's most noteworthy about Part 3 (indeed, it could be the only noteworthy aspect) is the hilarious cartoonishness of its villains. (I doubt that ""cartoonishness"" is an actual word, but I bet you understand its meaning. So that makes it a word.) Back from Part 1 (and the prologue of Part 2) is Karate Master Kreese, but if you thought HE was the pinnacle of prickitude, well you haven't seen anything yet. We also get Kreese's old army buddy, Terry Silver, who is A) an evil black-belt Karate Master, B) a cackling and self-admitted dumper of toxic waste (!), and C) played by Thomas Ian Griffith. PLUS there's a brutal new upstart in the world of tournament karate, so you just know that this kid's gonna get involved. AND we have sniveling henchman Snake...as played by the director's own son! Now that's one spooky legion of doom for anyone to face, let alone an elderly Asian man and the world's oldest teenager.

The best thing I can say about Part 3 is that it's a clear indication that SOME time and effort when into Part 2. Whereas the first sequel was just too quaint and familiar, Part 3 approaches the Karate Kid formula as if it's the world's last home-cooked meatloaf. There are only so many times we can see Daniel whimpering at the mistakes he's made while Miyagi stands around tossing out vague platitudes and wizened smiles. Part 3 trots out the same training montages, the same tournament finale, the same chaste little romance, the same 1980s cheeseball tunes, the same old song and dance. But this time it all feels cynical and hollow...which is NOT the vibe we still get from Part 1.",1131062400,5,1844,4.673846153846154
334774,5,6301570723,"I love Karate Kid 3, but not because it's a good movie-the movie's actually rather bad.  Storywise it seems to take a step backward instead of forward.  The plot is very similar to the first film.  John Kreese is back(yeah!) and looking for revenge coz his students abandoned him after his humiliating loss in the first film.  He turns to millionaire Vietnam buddy and toxic waste dumper, Terry Silver for help.  Silver devotes his life and fortune to getting revenge on Daniel and Miyagi.  The plan involves turning Daniel against Miyagi so Daniel will come to Silver to train for the next karate tournament.  Naturally, Silver's training goes against everything Miyagi teaches and Daniel basically becomes a Cobra Kai-type fighter.  Some badazz challenger wants to take a stab at Daniel in the tournament(of course he's working for Kreese and Silver).  This movie's pretty lame and unintentionally funny.  Daniel has always been a whiny, irritating wuss, and here it's cranked up tenfold.  Being the human punching bag he is, he's always walking around with a limp, black eye, etc.  It's so common now, we hardly notice.  There's also a terrible subplot involving a bonsai tree.  There's a chick, but she's barely worth this sentence.  The challenger/bully Mike Barnes spends about a half hour of the movie terrorizing Daniel into entering the tournament in typical Karate Kid bully fashion which consists  of destroying property, beating up Daniel and eventually getting beat up by Miyagi.  After saving Daniel's ass for the upteenth time, Miyagi decides to train him and the tournament is on!  It's not so thrilling this time because after fighting for his life in Karate Kid 2, another tournament seems like small potatoes.  Something else no one ever seems to mention about this film is the fact that the bad guys seem to win!  Sure, Daniel foils their plans to win the tournament, but so what?  He gets a lucky punch in during the ""sudden death"" part of the match, winning it, but he has had the ever living crap beat out of him up until that point.  Terry Silver's whole plan was to basically have Daniel bullied throughout the match, and he succeeds!  That's another point.  I don't know much about the rules of karate tournaments, but you cannot tell me that Barnes could do all that stuff and not be disqualified.  If you ask me, the best part of this film is the film debut of Thomas Ian Griffith, my favorite direct to video action star.  He gives us a sly, funny and rather crazy villian.

First of all the editing sucked, some scenes Daniel (Ralph Macchio) looked fat and other scenes he looked slim, and other scenes there after he looked like he was GETTING fat. His jeans were ridiculously tight in some scenes.

So you didn't know which was before or after. They were then merged together to confuse us...the overall result was ""fat"".

How and why would they get the girl from ""Teen Witch"" (Robyn lively) to play a love interest that was doomed before the movie even reached 30 minutes with the ""I already have a boyfriend"" speech...so why are you taking up space in this movie...you weren't all that pretty!!

Pat Morita is great as always but even his mentality was on ""Speed yawn"" for this movie...he was just going through the contract.

Apparently alot of reviewers giving 5 stars saw Karate kid 3 first and saw the Karate kid 1 afterwards (same story). This would I guess be perfectly normal because they showed part 3 ALOT in the late 80s and early 90s on cable and I can't remember seing part 1 in almost 10 years even on regular TV.

Tons and tons of unnecessary over-acting in this one by Thomas Ian Griffin (laughing uncontrallably..almost comically..something out of a cartoon almost)and the ""Johnny"" looka-like dude.

Was it me or did the bad guys who wanted Daniel to sign the Tournament contract to fight against him seem to not have lives and show up where ever he was at? He's in the middle of a Bonzai hunting expedition with Mr. Miyagi and then they show up?All Daniel had to do was sign the contract and the movie would've been 15 minutes...what a story they had for this one!

The music Score for this one was meaningless and no hits surfaced from the soundtrack...I don't think anyone cares to buy this soundtrack anyways.

In the last part with the tournament..almost the SAME EXACT scene as in part one...except Daniel was busting out of his Karate outfit due to him gaining more weight through out the film.

Maybe they can come with a Karate kid Reunion movie and use Ray Ramano to play Daniel?",1101772800,19,2198,4.6537467700258395
334776,2,6301570723,"The third series of Karate Kid is the least favorite among the series(including Karete Girl one). The plot itself is not bad.
Miyagi sensei in ambiguous manner warns against recent show-like atmosphere of the tournament itself and power-stressed styles. But it could have been much better presented in this film. Opening is really terrible. It ruins the whole plot. It's like rotten episode of 007 or Mitsukuni Mito the deputy-Shogun samurai drama. The previous series indicated some nice strategy so that Daniel-san could defeat the opponent in the end. But this one has none. It is quite unconvincing that Daniel san could win the Kobura-kai kids with latest Karate technics. I do not believe Kata alone can defeat the opponent.
Miyagi-san's love for Bonsai is very understandable but it took time for the movie too much.

334808,1,6301570723,"The original Karate Kid is a masterpiece; a cinematic work of art jam-packed with universal moral lessons, outstanding acting, and jaw-dropping cinematography.
The sequel, while not nearly as original as the first, maintains the intense charm, beautiful imagery, philosophical depth, and heart warming music made famous by the first.
Then theres part III...
I am at a loss for words in attempting to accurately describe the horror that is this movie. The acting is atrocious. The plot is paper thin. The ""philosophy"", if it can be called that, is total re-hash. The reccuring theme of Daniel having a ""secret move"" with which he is able to thrash the last boss (sound like any videogames you know of??)is intriguing in the first film, acceptable in the second, and totally inexcuseable in the third. What's worse, the secret move is a kata (Cringe..). I'm not sure how many reading this have ever formally practiced a martial art, but for those of you who have not, katas are not magical spells which confound enemies leaving them bewildered and vunerable to being tossed. Remember that if you are ever mugged.
What else is wrong with this movie, lets see...Well, Daniel talks to bonsai trees. Sure, some people enjoy talking to plants, some even says it helps with their growth. Such ""plant-talkers"" also may be found watering their living-room carpet or baking the cat for 3 hours at 350 degrees. All perfectly healthy behavior, yes, but a bit out of place in a karate kid movie.
I could go on about the absurdities scattered about this waste of a film: the karate instructors with personality disorders obsessed with Daniel, who spend the majority of their days threatening Daniel's life (which strangely enough is a crime in some states), the fact that Daniel's beloved mentor and father figure, who has saved his lfe, built him a very nifty shower curtain halloween costume, taught him self-confidence, self-defense, tolerence and discipline, given him a beautifully restored classic car, taken him to Okinawa, and remained one of the only positive influences in his life since his move from New Jersey to California...is abandoned and shunned for Daniel's pride.
But then I would be typing all day.
This film is an insult to the first two films. Literally, an insult. It is an insult to me, personally, and to everyone who knows and loves the characters of Daniel and Miyagi. It was most likely made in the spirit of Rocky V; a last ditch attempt by hollywood high-ups to squeeze the last drops of money-making potential out of a series that had already peaked, done at the expense of the series' reputation for quality. Shame on you, karate kid 3, shame!
(The one star rating is based on the fact that it does contain SOME nice scenic shots and DESCENT music. Other than those two barely redeeming features, the movie is a waste of space. It is unnerving to even imagine that such a piece of complete trash could be released by a major hollywood studio. This may sound harsh, but if you haven't seen it, judge for yourself. Rent it.

Mr. Silver is strangely obsessed over getting back at Miyagi and Daniel. I think he wanted it more than Kreese even for some reason. So he makes himself appear as a nobody, he even drives a little truck with no roof on it. Then he finds karate's bad boy, Mike Barnes...a performance that outshines perhaps any yet in the Karate Kid series. Barnes, and his two new friends, Snake and Dennis, eventually bully poor Daniel into signing up for the tourney. Silver finds a way to become friends with Daniel and basically makes him his puppet. He wills Daniel to fight without mercy and to go against all Daniel stands for by trying to convince him to fight dirty. Daniel doesn't really like it but he keeps studying under Silver for a while until he realizes the error of his way. At one point he asks Miyagi to teach him to sweep, in which Miyagi comes back with a broom and begins sweeping the steps. Brilliant.

The obsession that the old sensai from Karate Kid part 1 and the millionaire had with Daniel's title was disturbing.

Yet, with all that advice, knowledge, and some wisdom he gains by being around and living with Mr. Miagie (or however you spell his name), he totally gets played for a fool in the third. Also, even against Mike Barn's 2 henchmen, it's still somewhat like he hasn't even learned that much about karate to begin with. This movie was illogical. I mean, here's a kid who beats two No. 1 students in the first and second karate kid movies, and yet in the third, he just totally gets clobbered like he's a white belt!
Try to imagine Johnny and Chosen getting equally clobbered by Daniel's third opponent here, it doesn't make sense does it? It was like he totally lost all his karate experience. You'd think with Daniel going to Japan and learing 'traditional stuff' from the Land of the Rising Sun that he'd show Barns at least a thing or two and surprise him, but he didn't.

As with the second movie, Mr. Miyagi talks too much and Danny has yet again lost his girlfriend from the previous movie.
This time the girl is Jessica, who already has a boyfriend so she and Danny decide to ""go dutch"". How stupid is that? I think Elizabeth Shue should have come back for the sequels if they really had to make them. By giving Danny new girlfriends in every movie they totally void the original idea that he and Alli were in love. The sequels totally ruined that.
The worst part of the plot, however, was the psycho-guy who is obsessed with maiming Danny. He is doing this for the sake of the guy who owned the now-closed Cobra-Kai school. This obsessive psycho says he is doing this because the Cobra-Kai guy saved him many times in the Vietnam war, but he is so determined I personally think he must be sweet on him.

Years after Daniel-sahn has returned home from Japan, he has yet a NEW girlfriend, and resides with Miyagi somewhere in the U.S.A.  Daniel-sahn is overweight and looking at him walk and talk, one would never guess that he even ever SAW a karate move in his entire life, much less PRACTICED one.  He looks like a chubby nerd who probably couldn't defend himself against a scrappy chihuahua puppy, let alone an adept karateka.
In this flic, Daniel-sahn is coerced in numerous ways to begin training for a karate tournament that neither he nor Miyagi have any desire in entering.  Miyagi, in fact, initially refuses to train him and tells Daniel-sahn that he's on his own.  In comes Daniel's deus ex machina: One of the ""bad guys"" deceives Daniel into believing that he's a good guy that wants to train Daniel-sahn.  And he trains him by having Daniel hitting wooden boards so hard that they bludgeon his fists!  This aggressive training leads Daniel-sahn to break someone's nose, and finally the idiot gets a clue and realizes that he's been set up all along.
Finally, Miyagi comes into the picture and gets Daniel back into true form in time for the tournament where Daniel faces an opponent who is clearly much more confident and aggresive than Macchio.  The tactic of Macchio's opponent -in typical, predictable fashion- is to injure Daniel-sahn as severely as possible, scoring illegal hits, then score a legal hit to win.  In typical fashion, Daniel-sahn pulls himself together and wins the last point and the movie ends.
This is definitely a movie that should be submitted to Mystery Science Theater for review.  Don't get me wrong; there's plenty of comedy, but the only problem is that the producers of the movie didn't INTEND this flic to be a comedy.

The script is atrocious and none of the actors have any 'spirituality' on their minds with the exception of when their next paycheck will arrive--the first film was inspired, somewhat believeable, and fun.  The first sequel was sappy, but had the beautiful cinematography and background of Japan to compensate, not to mention logical character development.  This has nothing but greed written all over it.
By this point, there was no way we would believe Ralph Macchio looks remotely like a late teenager.  Cynically, the plot allows us to skip to the final because the tournament rules state that the defending champion 'only has to fight in the finals.'
If there was one redeeming moment in the film, it would have been to extend the training sequences, and ditch the lousy, third-rate attempt at romance.  As it is, the kata sessions seem almost perfunctory and superfluous.

Daniel would whip that dude around the world and back again, if the movie  played true to form.",967507200,3,1044,4.545945945945946
334918,1,6301570723,"This is probably one of the worst movies I have even had the misfortune to see.  The first Karate Kid was great, the first sequel was so-so, but this one is absolute garbage.  Horrible pacing, horrible direction, horrible  screenplay, worse-than-horrible acting, should I go on?
Ralph Macchio  looks like he munched on too many hoo-hoos to prepare for this role.  Even  Pat Morita can't save this disaster.  Don't even bother with this film.  Woof, what a dog.
If you *must* see this film, wait until it shows up on  Mystery Science Theater 3000.",963446400,4,546,4.78494623655914
334919,1,6301570723,"The story about the boy and his love life is just stupid.
Ali Leaves him for a football player, the Chinese girl leaves him for her dream. and there ain't much acting along when he exsplains these storys.
Ahhhh the acting  got very bad, Not even Morita (A GREAT person) can help this film  any.
Bad Film, Bad Sequel, bad Idea, Bad Acting, Bad story, Bad Plot, Bad  Action, Same Old Same Old etc. this film does Bad on everything it tries to  do.",961632000,4,445,4.261904761904762
7812692,4,6301570723,"I enjoyed the movie more than the second. The plotline was pretty good and the bad guys were pretty awesome. The relationship with the girl had nothing to do with the story and wasn't something I even cared about (unlike the first two movies). Also the ending fight was pretty ant-climactic. It did, as other reviews mention, show Daniel as weak. He was only able to land one strike in the entire movie.",1526256000,,403,4.534246575342466

7812701,3,6301570723,This is better then part two.  But it doesn't come close to the original.  There is one good thing.  Thomas Ian Griffith brigs the perfect amount of sleaze in his role of a trainer taking who is just setting Daniel up.  And one really dumb thing.  Martin Kove seeming coming back from the dead as part of that set up. The movie all in all is good.  But it doesn't work like the first one.,1498953600,,388,4.1066666666666665
