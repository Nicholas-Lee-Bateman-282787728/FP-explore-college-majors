8190554,5,B00065GX46,"My 5 year old daughter has become obsessed with Puss in Boots. It's been years since I've watched any of the Shrek movies, but I had to get them out since I'm so sick of watching Puss in Boots and thought she'd like Shrek as well. We used to have the whole collection, but Shrek 2 was missing (naturally the first movie Puss is in) so I ordered it and in normal Amazon fashion got it in 2 days. We immediately watched it and I forgot how much I really like these movies. They are really funny with lots of laugh out loud parts. I like that there is adult humor without it being crass.",1476576000,,584,4.086956521739131

8190561,5,B00065GX46,"I really enjoy the Shrek movies, as does my whole family. This one was a little more serious than the first, but just as funny, and introduces some great new characters, such as Puss In Boots. Definitely a must see for the family.",1356998400,,230,4.372093023255814
