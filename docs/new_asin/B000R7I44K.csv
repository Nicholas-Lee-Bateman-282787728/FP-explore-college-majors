2862123,5,B000R7I44K,"I started watching this show from the very beginning, mainly because it was a chance to sit and stare at Jennifer Love Hewitt for an hour each week. But, each succeeding episode raised the show in my eyes, and then with the shocking (well, I never saw it coming) ending of the first season, it became one of my ""can't miss"" shows each week.

Season two got even better. Sure, there were some episodes that didn't really contribute to the drama, but all were well done, and then the surprise ending of Season Two (again, I never saw it coming) made me wish the summer would end so we could get to Season Three.",1187568000,,609,4.342105263157895
2862124,5,B000R7I44K,"Ghost Whisperer is still a favourite of mine even though it's dropped from Australian TV radar (for whatever reason).  Through the magic of technology, I've now seen this whole season and I found it as great as the first season.
My favourite episodes are Love Still Won't Die (where Melinda has to deal with an ex, plus a shoplifting teen who's not sure why he's committing the crime), The Woman Of His Dreams (where a dream sends Melinda to her mother on the eve of surgery, but the dream transfers to Jim and he must find a way to help a ghost he can't see while Melinda is out of town) and also The Collector (Melinda comes across another ghost whisperer, and he may have some answers for her about shifts in the spirit world, but the information comes at a price).
You definately have to suspend your belief of reality when you watch this.  It's good escapism (although it's not always best to watch it right before bedtime), and I love the characters and I also love her husband Jim.  Overall, it's such a fun show to watch and I can't wait to get my copy ASAP.",1185062400,19,1066,4.373737373737374

2862126,5,B000R7I44K,"Ghost Whisperer is the best Sci-Fi Drama ever to grace tv. It has heartfelt storyline that allows every family member of any age to enjoy but with the effects to impress even big shot movie directors/producers like Steven Spielberg (E.T. and Back to the Future Trilogy fame) and scripts written by the best of the bunches that make even the guest-starring characters shine.

I'll admit even though Ghost Whisperer is my all time favorite show now it was a little hard to like at the beginning but once I got used to it's formate and excepted it for what it was, it totally did a 360 which is what you want in a series you don't want something to stay in a rut. So I advise those that judged it prematurely or never fully gave it a chanced and just based their decision to not tune it by friends comments then give Season 2 a shot IMO it's even better then Season 1.

Episodes I recommend from Season 2 are:
2.01 ""Love Never Dies""
2.04 ""The Ghost Within""
2.05 ""A Grave Matters""
2.07 ""A Vicious Cycle""
2.08 ""The Night We Met""
2.09 ""The Curse of the Ninth""
2.13 ""Deja Boo""
2.18 ""Children of Ghosts""
2.19 ""Delia's First Ghost""
2.20 ""The Collector""
2.21 ""The Prophet""
2.22 ""The Gathering""

If you watch any of those I can assure you that you won't regret picking up Ghost Whisperer - The Second Season in store shelves or ordering threw Amazon come this September 18.

Also on a final note, make sure to tune in for Season 3!!! on CBS Fridays at 8/9c come this fall, presumably late September.",1183852800,11,1488,4.41970802919708
2862127,5,B000R7I44K,"This season of Ghost Whisperer, continues to be a very good family friendly scare, just scary enough to make it interesting, but not enough that I don't let my youngest (tween-ager) watch it with my wife and me.

Although it is a bit edgier than the first season, a necessity to the continuity of the plot, and I do miss her partner from last season, we continue to look forward to each episode during the school year, and the DVD marathons when home for a weekend.

If you already have season one, then this is a must have!",1183420800,21,524,4.336734693877551
2862128,5,B000R7I44K,"I had previously written a review of Ghost Whisperer Season 1 and I'm proud to say it's still a great guilty pleasure for me on a Friday night.

Ghost Whisperer Season 2 resolves the cliffhanger from last season, wherein Melinda Gordon (the gorgeous Jennifer Love Hewitt) began ""seeing"" the passengers of a plane who had become ""earth-bound sprirts"" just before the plane crashed in the town of Grandview, where the series is set. She then has the task of sending all 200 passengers into the afterlife, or crossing-over. As well as convincing them not to follow the advice of a man in black with a wide-brimmed hat (guess who?) who clearly has other plans for them. She's also faced with the knowledge of why the plane crashed and trying to tell investigators in such a way that doesn't reveal her ability to talk with the dead. All this comes at a personal cost to her, in the aftermath of the plane crash it was revealed one of the victims on the ground was her best friend and business partner Andrea (Aisha Tyler) whom she must also guide into the afterworld.

As sesason 2 begins, Melinda has apparently won her battle with the man in the wide-brimmed hat, she's said her final goodbye to Andrea, things slowly get back to normal around Grandview. But the plane crash and its aftermath continue to figure in Season 2. Throughout this season subtle hints are given that a bigger story is coming. And what a story it is.

In Season 2, Camryn Manheim is introuduced as single mom Delia Banks who becomes Melinda's new business partner and brings with her a 12 year old son who accidentally discovers Melinda's abilities. And Jay Mohr becomes a recurring character as an eccentric Professor with a great interest in the spirit world and Melinda herself. The ""ghost stories"" continue to have that sorta-scary edge to them when first encountered. And we begin to find out little bits about Melinda's life too. I'd like to see more episodes like this, might sound dumb but they give Jennifer a chance to show she's more than just a hot brunette with a rack (note to CBS wardrobe designers, get this girl some better clothes please! As a guy, it does make Fridays a little more enjoyable, but that's another story!). She's got some acting abilities too, people. Let's see more of those! Just remember that one episode showed a flashback to her high school days get someone else to play her at that age. Sorry Jen but your 27, not 16! That one really stretched the belivability envelope.

And as for the big story, I said that throughout this season small hints were dropped as to what was coming in nearly ever episode. Mohr's charcter brings it all into focus showing how the number 5 and a man with similar abilites named Gabriel plays into several signs of a coming event, and it isn't a good one. I won't reveal too much but in the season finale Melinda crosses over, if only for a moment, and the tone for Season 3 is set!",1181347200,25,2924,4.58508604206501

2862183,3,B000R7I44K,"The storylines have devolved further into ghosts who are usually mean, even cruel, and are able to wield power in this world to hurt someone, and those abilities get rougher and more destructive as the series progresses.  I still watch now and then, but it's more and more difficult to swallow most of the action and acting as the capabilities of the ghosts are so contrary to accepted doctrine that powerful bad ghosts are extremely rare (if you even believe in them, that is).  Once again the costumes worn by Melinda are stunning and leave me wishing I could afford to dress like her, especially since she changes outfits several times a show.  Her shop associate, Delia, is a worthy successor to her co-owner of last year, and the addition of Delia's young son, who can also see ghosts, is inspired.  Delia also wears captivating outfits and jewelry, well worth the view.  The interaction between Melinda and Jim is still nicely played, and Delia's suitor is not only well acted but...even better....believable as a person.  Professor Payne is a blast, and I enjoy the slow evolution and buildup of his character who is more and more involved in the action.",1469318400,2,1161,4.78

Season 2 continues to increase in unnecessary scare factor (at least for me).  I was hoping for something more uplifting, enlightening and empowering like I found throughout Season 1.  It just seems to get scarier, darker and ominous as time goes on.  Really disappointed because I like some of James Van Praagh's work.  I wonder how thrilled he was with the way the series turned out.

""The Walk-In"" was the most ridiculous for me so far.  I'm beginning to consider not bothering with the rest of the story.  Not my cup of tea.  However, if you like horror, negativity, etc. you may want to go for it.  I don't need that stuff in my life.  Life's difficult enough in reality.

J-Lo , is perfect as the small town shop owner how help guide ""earth bound spirits into the light"".

Some may classify this show as Sci-Fi , but I classify it great tv , now of course I will be asked to review each episode , but I won`t.

All my episodic reviews would end up being the same , one of the more perfect shows that sadly had to come to an end.

Some episodes are better , but none are not worth seeing. For 45 min`s you can journey with Mel & Jim or Sam on adventures that truly shed light on the other side.

Will you see her ?

Easy to sit and watch or let run as you get things done around your house.
My only complaint, the main character (Hewitt) paraphrases very poorly for the ghosts she is speaking for.
A ghost will be trying to pass a message along to a living loved one, and the ghost will say something quite profound or meaningful, and she relays the message in a way more simple and unfeeling way. Why do the writers do this?

Aside from that, most episodes are good hearted and have the obligatory sappy 'walking into the light' ending (which is right up there with the endings for Touched by an Angel' entering the light, and Jessica (Murder She Wrote) tipping her head and shaking it at the murderer as if to say 'shame on you').  Of course, a few of Ghost Whisperer have the ghosts ending up turning from the light and going with the Devil's representative. So, don't get too comfortable.

So, this is what Jessica Love Hewitt is up to these days. I'm not a fan of ghost stories generally and would normally warn those who aren't to shy away from this series. However, if you can get by the ghosts, several of the episodes use the ghost story as a plot device to explore compelling HUMAN stories (somewhat like Hewitt's film ""If Only""). As such, even if you don't like ghosts, read on:

The good:
In the episodes I've seen at least, the story with the ghosts provided a segway into a far more compelling human drama. For example, in one episode I saw, the ghosts torment a father and daughter who feel guilty over the mother's death. The emotionally compelling part of the episode was seeing the father and daughter deal with their guilt and frustration. Hewitt, as the ghost whisperer, indirectly helps these catharses.

Now, the bad:
The ghosts aren't subtle. With a few exceptions (generally shadows in a dark room), the ghosts look and act just like normal people, only that ""only"" Hewitt can see them. There's no especially pale skin, glow, or anything else to make the ghosts seem supernatural. Admittedly, this varies by episode, and some ghosts seem to have supernatural powers. Still, don't expect freaky special effects.

In short, if you like the type of sitcom/dramas generally shown on the WE channel, you might like Ghost Whisperer. Don't be too turned off by the ghosts in the stories (even if the ghosts can get snarky at times). However, this isn't a sci-fi series or comedy sitcom.",1258502400,,1571,4.681159420289855

It like I was watching Melinda got up from the bed with that fluppy dress and hardly contain chest and done her shore with all the ghosts. It's really annoy me.

As addictive as the first; the relationships on the show are fantastic. Have to admit I do miss Andrea - she was a great character. But her new friends bring some other angles to the show with fantastic results.,1209859200,,454,4.2298850574712645
2862508,5,B000R7I44K,Again another great series on DVD. A must have if you like anything to do with ghosts. I am going to buy every single season they put out of this show.

2862509,5,B000R7I44K,"after the death of her best friend, Andrea.  She has to help her cross over as well which turns into a task in of itself as there are dark forces growing stronger with each day.  Trying to stop Melinda from crossing over the ghosts that come to her, some will even refuse her help and choose to stay in the world of the living.  I was saddened by the death of Andrea, but it was handled well and we also get to see her brother play a role in things.  Finally finding peace over his sister's death and Andrea crossing over.  Things start to ramp up towards of the middle of the season.

With more than a few difficult ghosts and more powerful forces that are growing ever present and trying to block Melinda from ultimate goal.  Let's just say that with a couple episodes left at the end of season 2, you'll be more than pleasantly surprised at the new developments and characters that come to Grandview to reak havoc on things.

2862512,3,B000R7I44K,"I thought the departure of Andrea would hurt the show, but was pleasantly surprised by newcomer Delia Banks. Along with other newcomer Rick Payne, and there's some positive changes amongst the cast. However, sadly, this change isn't enough to save the show becoming very formulaic in season two.

Every episode starts to follow a very predictable format: Melinda is doing something different (it could be going to a baseball game, going to a martial arts class, at an auction)... some how other cast members are involved there too. She then meets someone new... that person will be relevant to the story later. Bad things start happening, and normally they tie in with the theme of the show. By chance, that person she met earlier is involved with the ghost. Melinda asks questions, sends them to the light game over. It's very tiresome. The linking of themes is particularly painful. For example Melinda gets a piano in the store, and in the same episode she deals with the ghost of a musician. Fancy that!

It's also a problem that they try to bring the regulars into the story-of-the-week too often. It's a bit like the Simpsons, where it's the same few regulars involved whatever crazy story each week. It's okay for the Simpsons, but it makes Ghost Whisperer feel like it's in a bubble. Add to that Melinda tels all manner of people that she can see ghosts, except Delia, to create some fake drama.

Also disappointing is is that the story of the 'bad guy' featured in season one is all but dropped. They could have done more to keep that story alive.

Overall a disappointing season. The show has got stuck in a rut very quickly. Let's hope season three brings back some of the freshness and variety of season one; many shows go through a bad second year, and maybe Ghost Whisperer is just one of them. The episodes aren't awful, so the DVDs are probably worth a purchase but only after they've come down in price.",1195344000,3,1920,4.654867256637168
