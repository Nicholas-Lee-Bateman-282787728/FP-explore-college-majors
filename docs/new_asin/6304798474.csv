8/12: The staticity of The Night and the Moment will understandably turn off a majority of the viewers, but those who brave through the two-person dialogue will find it a charming film.

Films of this genre usually don't work very well because the audience want a breakup in the monotony through actions.

What makes The Night and the Moment a true standout are the performances of Willem Dafoe and Lena Olin. It's rather amusing for me to see who is seducing whom.

These two thespians are undeniably excellent whose acting are of the first order. Their expertness matches the richness of the dialogue, allowing themselves to transcend beyond speaking which thus eliminates the theatrical feel of the film.

The viewers who manage to make it to the end will be rewarded with a surprising but predictable twist.

So, that being said, it takes time to warm up (think of it as a foreplay) at the beginning of The Night and the Moment. Once they are ready, it becomes easy to get into the performances.

All in all, The Night and the Moment is a superb atavistic romantic picture.",1345939200,4,1099,4.692708333333333
7877430,4,6304798474,"Willem Dafoe and Lena Olin have the art of seduction mastered in ""The Night and the Moment""; and the art is in their words. The sensuous dialogue is the foreplay in this passionate period piece, set in the 18th century.

It is nighttime in the great estate of the beautiful Marquise(Olin). Her guests are roaming the halls, secretly meeting with their lovers. One man(Dafoe) prepares himself for a night of lust, and we are anticipating what he may have in mind. He slides quietly into her room as her maid is about to undress her for bed. She spies him in the mirror and with a slightly wicked smile, dismisses her maid. And the seduction begins.

She coyly asks him to leave; what kind of woman does he think she is? But yet she pulls him back. He tells her a story of his days in prison. How his heart beats only for the woman imprisoned in the next cell. Never seeing her face, or hearing her voice. They passed each other letters through a hole in the wall. He tells her of his erotic adventures(told through flashbacks) as he tries to find the woman. The Marquise is aroused by his words. They find themselves becoming more and more desirous of each other. She wants him to leave, but can't bring herself to let him go. He works his way into her heart and her bed. She has a story of her own.

Olin and Dafoe are hypnotizing as they draw you into their night and tales of passion. The erotic yet witty banter is the meat of this film. It's the supreme seduction. But the question is who was seducing who?

Steeped in symbolism, artfully directed by Anna Maria Tato, and wonderfully filmed. It's a film to appreciate for both the delicious dialogue, and the sensual performances. I'm not sure that it would be one that would be watched over and over again, but maybe when ""The Night and The Moment""...and the mood is just right!

7877431,4,6304798474,"A witty and comical drama, very much from the origins of today's romantic drama, of a marchioness who starts up a conversation with her philandering lover, who went to prison for a while, and makes him give an account of his pleasurable exploits. Slowly and surely, he captures her heart and soul as she discloses one of her amorous encounters. Quite a naughty film with naughty naughty sweet scenes. The scene where a young lady comes in the author's cell to seduce him and he refuses her is funny! Modern and eighteenth century elements are blended in this film. Not much of a structured plot and the film lacks intrigue. But the spell of both lovers will entice you and I trust the owl to keep a secret. You'll know what I mean if you see the film!",1068940800,7,751,4.449275362318841
