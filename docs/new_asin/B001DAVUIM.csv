8292528,3,B001DAVUIM,"My 3-year old saw Daffy Dave perform at the library. Unlike library story time and puppet shows where he wonders off after twenty minutes, he stayed put the whole time. I'm sure that most of the jokes went over his head, but he loved Daffy Dave's style and hearing the other kids laugh. So I ordered this DVD as a gift.
And my son enjoys watching the DVD as well as part of his library of DVDs.",1324771200,,394,4.12987012987013
