3736315,4,B001OSWOCO,"If you want to see Barbara Stanwyck in a classic ""Stanwyck"" role, this is the movie.  I found it light fun worth a lazy 1.5 hours or so in what would otherwise have been an unproductive afternoon.  The mystery is not too difficult to follow (or solve for that matter), the banter a little quick which forces one to pay attention and, hey, it's fun to retro back to the 40's for a movie like this at least once a month or so. Do it, particularly if it's part of your Prime membership at no additional cost.",1385683200,,505,4.195876288659794
3736316,5,B001OSWOCO,"Lady of Burlesque was filmed, distributed, and shown in front of movie-theater audiences at a time when many people in the film-industry gave 10% of their salaries--if not their entire salary from a film--to support the war effort of World War II. In addition, war bonds were sold in movie theaters at this time.

  Lady of Burlesque is a brave little film in time of war, offered to audiences who did not know if they would live or die, but who were determined to live.
  Filming began in early December, 1942, on a sound stage in Encino or Escondido, California, that had been rented from RKO.
 Filming was completed in late January, 1943.  About 90 days later, the film premiered in New York City at the Capitol Theater.
  Despite an uncomplimentary review in the New York Times, May 14, 1943, the film went on to bring in nearly 2 million dollars at the Box office (1943 dollars).
  Less than a year after its premier, Lady of Burlesque won(((or was among films nominated for))) an Academy Award for best musical score for a motion picture.  The award was presented March 4, 1944 at the Biltmore Bowl of the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, according to the records.

Two Members of the Songwriters Hall of Fame--Harry Axt and Sammy Kahn (also spelled Cahn)--

 wrote the award-winning songs, ""So this is You "" and ""Take it off the E-String""for the film. The orchestral arrangements were by very Well Known arranger Arthur Lange, whose book ""Arranging for the Modern Dance Orchestra"" was famous, and may still have a copy for sale on Amazon.

A 90-second trailer advertising this film in theaters suggests that the Box-office strategy for Lady of Burlesque was probably the two famous names of Gypsy Rose Lee as played by Barbara Stanwyck.  The trailer emphasizes  the film as an adaptation of Gypsy
Rose Lee's mystery novel, ""The G-String Murders."" (A survey of potential audiences before filming suggested that most people thought ""G string""related to stringed instruments like the violin, and so the word""G-string"" wasn't used in titling the film; this in addition to advice from censors.)

The film was Hunt Stromberg's first production independent of a motion-picture studio. This explains why Stromberg's name, and not a studio name, begins the film.

 Director William A. Wellman had previously directed many films,and  had just directed Barbara Stanwyck and Joel McRae in The Great Man's Lady (1942)

As you know, if you can obtain an enhanced or restored copy  with most of the deleted scenes intact--(the film has 3 running lengths, it appears)--
You will both see some special scenes and hear a wonderful pit orchestra with a hot trumpet, a hot clarinet, and drumming in all the right places.

 The film opens in a manner vaguely reminiscent of Hitchcock's film The 39 Steps:  someone steps up to purchase a ticket under a theater marquee, and the camera works its way--(in this case  past actor J.Edward Bromberg as he says, ""Girls!  That's what the public wants!"")

And into the theater we go...we see an audience, theater seats, a pit orchestra,a stage, and then  3 production numbers--one right after another.
  Much of the film is done as if watching a performance onstage, and this is to our advantage because we get to see Barbara Stanwyck handling dialogue and stuntwork (very fit...comic routines, splits, cartwheels, jitterbugging) on stage, rather than on location,  Or under a microphone boom.

Projection of the voice onstage is a special art, and we get to see  Miss Stanwyck and the supporting cast do this. Maybe a textbook, if you are into acting technique.

  The American Film Institute Online Film Catalog has a
Page on Lady of Burlesque; both the plot and the full cast are listed there.
The cast was very successfully supportive all around.

I had 2 small additional comments: many supporting cast members did well elsewhere, for example, Gerald Mohr appeared often on the Radio favorite Our Miss Brooks, and treated audiences to his wonderful voice.

Also, I notice that people who write books about Miss Stanwyck's film career often say next to nothing about Lady of Burlesque. Certainly the reviews on Amazon help to fill this gap, and we are lucky to have the Amazon reviews. In the books that say so little about this film, why not the following  question: --was Barbara Stanwyck the first movie actress to portray a character based on Gypsy Rose Lee?",1383436800,3,4391,4.886332882273343
3736317,2,B001OSWOCO,"Lady of Burlesque, 1943 film

This story is set in pre-war Manhattan before the lights went out. [Blackout laws kept cities along the coast dark to prevent submarine attacks against ships leaving port, and to save energy.] ""Dixie Daisy"" is the star at the Old Opera House. The show begins with dancing girls. Then a man sings,  girls dance before an all-male audience. Dixie Daisy appears and sings to music. Then she sheds her jacket. Men wear hats and suspenders. The comics wear funny clothes. The girls make catty comments, argue and fight. [Personality conflicts in show business?] They change into new outfits and perform again. The comics perform. The police arrive, it's a raid. One woman is attacked in the dark. The performers are arrested and taken to jail. Who tried to strangle Dixie? Who had a motive? A man shows up to meet one of the ladies. Dixie hopes to move up to the Broadway stage.

We see the girls again backstage. Men watch them. We see other events. A new actress appears. There are conversations. ""I am back."" There is a comic court scene. Men bring in barrels of beer. They play music to cover an argument. There is a dance on stage. The crowd applauds. Back stage they find the body of a strangled stripper in a locked closet! The police arrive. ""Who did it?"" Louie skipped town. The Police Inspector questions the group. Princess Lavinia was in her room. Secrets are revealed. The coroner says the victim was poisoned before she was strangled! [Are those conversations still funny?] What happened to the missing picture? A comic is caught with that G-string and taken in for questioning. A couple go to a hotel, they are followed by another woman, and she is followed by a man.

The manager explains his scheduling to Dixie. The police learned new facts and released the comic. Who did it? Then another body is found on-stage! ""Could it be suicide?"" Shots interrupt the conversation! Louis has returned. ""You won't get me, copper!"" [How many bullets in his revolver?] Louis takes a fall. There is another round of questioning. Mr. Rogers bought a box of expensive cigars. Where did he get the money? Will he confess to something? The Police Inspector advises the performers to stay away, the murderer is still out there. Dixie explains the notice: to shut down the theater. But they will continue to work so the show goes on. Another woman is attacked by the murderer! [Did you suspect him earlier?] Mr. Brannigan explains why he suspected the murderer. There is comic ending.

This is a below average murder mystery, aside from its unusual setting. It tells about a form of show business that is now obsolete, and its culture. This was adapted from the novel ""The G-String Murders"" by Gypsy Rose Lee. Murders are caused by love and money (or lust and greed). Hate is the obverse of love.",1383091200,,2818,4.719512195121951
3736318,3,B001OSWOCO,"I have had a DVD of this movie from another source.  Thought I'd try the one with noise reduction, etc.  When the DVD loads and comes up with the first menu, the stripper music is blasting.  Once you click on Play for the movie, the audio for the entire DVD is barely above a whisper.  The picture is excellent, however.",1382659200,,320,4.283333333333333
3736319,4,B001OSWOCO,"Barbara Stanwyck is one of least heralded ""great"" actress of the few ""great"" actresses of the so-called Golden Era in Hollywood, but only by some imbecilic lapse in judgement by the many over the few.  Those who truly love movies know her true value.  For me, she tops Davis in many ways (less showy), is clearly headlong ahead of Crawford, isn't as smarmy as Shearer (who is too arch even without her bra on under her Adrian vamp gowns) and so forth.  And here, in this crisp, sassy, fast-paced little murder mystery gem she shows off her terrific body, her native Brooklyn twang, gets to sing, strip, do burlesque comic turns, and performs a nifty set of cartwheels.  After all, she was a Ziegfeld Girl at 16!!  Great ensemble of many recognizable character actors and actresses (all playing strippers).  Love the big-busted blonde with the lisp.  Fun way to kill 90 minutes with someone who likes workaday Hollywood from the early 40s. Golly, they could churn 'em out back then and not make such a big deal about it all.",1381449600,7,1023,4.65

3736321,3,B001OSWOCO,"The cast strives to make something of the script which is a complex murder mystery that ultimately makes no sense.  Cleaned up from Gypsy Rose Lee's book ""The G=String Murders.""",1372377600,,177,4.9
3736322,4,B001OSWOCO,Really interesting story about a film version about stage vaudeville actors in the early days of black and white film.  Also interesting to see real characters and not the politically correct versions we have today.,1368144000,,215,5.142857142857143
3736323,5,B001OSWOCO,"This film is full of surprises. I saw it accidentally and thought it was much older than I discovered it is when looking it up on IMDb. It's like a peek backstage at a burlesque show where all of the aciton happens.  It actually catches your interest and manages to hold it, because of these historical artifacts if nothing else.

For example, you'll be surprised to see Barbara Stanwyck dancing and doing it very well, in long full body shots that show it's actually her doing the dancing.

Next you'll see Pee Wee Herman...then realize it couldn't possibly be him and you realize it's Pinky Lee, the one who inspired Herman's career.  You'll recognize all of the vaudeville routines from other comedians. Abbott and Costello's routines especially.  All in all it's a film worth watching, and watch for the surprises as well. You'll never realize how much you owe to burlesque and vaudeville and how you have laughed all your life at jokes that were written long before any of us were ever born.",1239753600,,996,4.7011494252873565
3736324,5,B001OSWOCO,"By 1942, the Burlesque movies were all but over thanks to the ""Production Code"" brought upon Hollywood by the Moral Majority.  However, Lady of Burlesque, based on the book ""The G-String Murders"" written by Gypsy Rose Lee, was brought to the screen.

Lady of Burlesque stars Barbara Stanwyck, alongside many of the Burlesque Stars of the day such as Dixie Daisy & Pinky Lee.  This movie has been classified as a mystery/thriller but has a lot of relationship drama as love triangles and rivalry between the stars crowds the backstage.",1232409600,2,534,4.911111111111111
3736325,3,B001OSWOCO,"I love Barbara Stanyck. The film overall is not great but, like most films, one great performance can turn a stinker into a rose. Stanwyck was a rose. If you like old films, even a little bit, you can learn a lot watching her films, from Baby Face onwards. She had it all in an era when actors had to deliver the goods, not special effects.",1427587200,,340,4.166666666666667

3736328,3,B001OSWOCO,"I love Barbara Stanwyck in anything she has done in the 1930's and 1940's.  I know how had she worked to get herself to get to where she was, but what a talent she was. She was used her beautiful body to dance and sign with and also to show off her sex appeal.  It certainly worked Barbara!  I enjoyed the movie very much.  If your a Stanwyck fan and like to see all her movies, you must catch this one as well. A very sexy one for her in the early 1940's.",1419552000,,456,3.870967741935484
3736329,4,B001OSWOCO,This is one of Stanwyck's fun roles unlike the dramatic turns she usually takes. The cast is marvelous and the murder at the burlesque house keeps you guessing. Mike O'Shea plays the love interest for Barbara. A shame that he never reached the same lofty heights as his love interest but his turn as the comic is so enjoyable.,1418774400,,326,4.5423728813559325
3736330,4,B001OSWOCO,"THE LADY OF BURLESQUE has been in the public domain for years. There are so many bad prints where the picture and sound are inferior. In fact, the picture has snippets missing, making it a bad experience. I purchased two versions. Previously, the version from Image is missing parts of the picture and the sound is uneven. Due to the great experiences that I had from Digi.com (LIFE WITH FATHER and FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND), I was pleasantly surprised with what Digi.com do with THE LADY FROM BURLESQUE. The sound is great and for the first time, there are no missing parts of the picture. Well done! I highly recommend this version for those who want quality. Finally, a good print of THE LADY OF BURLESQUE!",1418601600,2,709,4.68
3736331,1,B001OSWOCO,"This video is essentially useless.  It looks like a print ten times removed from the original video, very faded and blurred, with occasionally garbled and blurred sound.

3736332,3,B001OSWOCO,"This film is not up to the mark.  Barbara gives it her all as she always did, but the whole plot is rather transparent and really not worth the time to watch.  I think Barbara Stanwyck was a terrific actress and she deserved a better role than this one.",1390089600,,253,4.142857142857143
3736333,5,B001OSWOCO,The plot moves along fast enough to make up for a moderately weak story. Stanwyck is very believable as a smart Burlesque star.,1387238400,,127,4.565217391304348
3736334,5,B001OSWOCO,"I love Barbara Stanwyck, also the burlesque era was fun with a bit of naughtiness thrown in. This movie aside from the comic aspect of it also has the mystery of the G-string killings.  I did not have a clue who did it till the end.  This movie is not one of those hard thinking who done its.  It is fun and enjoyable with the mood of mystery thrown in.  I am going to buy this movie in the future because I have already watched it at least 5 times. Sit back , relax and enjoy a fun movie.",1386892800,,489,3.909090909090909

8331471,5,B001OSWOCO,Barbara Stanwyck is adorable. The movie is fun and flashy. Just escapist fun and the second bananas are great. Give yourself a well-earned break and watch Barbara before she did BALL OF FIRE.,1448064000,,191,4.818181818181818
8331472,5,B001OSWOCO,"Best mastering is DigiCom TV, cleanest image with good contrast.  Other best is Image Entertainment with slightly fuller sound.  Collectors will already know they must have this charming wartime camp who-dunnit based on a Gypsy Rose Lee novel, nominated for Best Score in 1943. The music is truly infectious, you will be whistling and humming it days later.  Tough Stanwyck and goofy O'Shea have an edgy romantic chemistry that sparkles.

I am a huge fan of old movies.
I really like the old golden age of mysteries and thrillers.
Barbara Stanwyck was an extremely underrated actress.
In every movie I've seen....  .
She delivers a great performance. This one does not disappoint.
This movie was based on a book written by burlesque Queen Gypsy Rose Lee. I won't lie to you.
There are flaws in the script and some of the camera work is a bit unprofessional. However it doesn't take away from the overall feel of the movie. I would recommend this movie.",1437955200,,546,4.46
