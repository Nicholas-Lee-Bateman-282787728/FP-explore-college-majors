I love edgy stuff, but I hate canned entertainment like the extreme sport show on TV. This documentary is exactly what I love - edgy, intense, but without the pretense. People who are feared of snakes or love snakes should watch this interesting documentary about this Thai village's dangerous engagement with the cobras. Beyond entertaining, I think the doc is also very informative on the creature and cultural background in Thailand.",1212278400,,662,6.975903614457831

I was alternately rolling in my seat with laughter and sitting at the edge in suspense! I can't beilieve the people in this small Thai village live such an unusual and dangerous life and Tom Tavee captures it so vividly, I felt like I was there in the audience watching first hand! So glad it's available on DVD!",1186444800,2,416,4.415584415584416

8502965,5,B000QGE81K,"I loved this documentary. Mr. Tavee takes us on a fascinating and courageous journey into a culture and practice so far from anything you will every experience in the West. Even if you hate snakes, you'll be riveted by how casually and playfully even the youngest of children handle them. A real treat.",1186012800,2,302,4.716981132075472
