8229721,2,6305337667,"This film had no effort put into it.  With so many great players to talk about, it was a particularily dry film.  The selection of clips that were supposed to offer insight into the players greatness were often poorly chosen, while little information was uncovered.  This movie only has a purpose if you want to know who was actually on the team, but nothing else will be gained from this film.  Noteworthy is the absence of Clyde Drexler and Christian Laettner, because this film was made in 1991---before the two were named to the team and a whole year before the team played their first game.",1014595200,10,595,4.584905660377358
