MATINEE is a fun movie about the movies. John Goodman plays a producer of monster films who premieres his latest, MANT in a Key West house called The Strand. This is right as the Cuban Missile Crisis is unfolding, so everyone's already scared to begin with. Goodman rigs the theater with a bunch of gadgets like joy buzzers in the seat cushions and Rumblerama, which shakes the hell out of everyone and he hires a kid to wear a Mant costume to run around in the audience.

Best thing about this story is Goodman's b&w movie, MANT. It's loaded with bad puns like, (Bill's wife:) ""Oh, why can't they see Bill as a man and just put the insect aside?"" Bill, who's been transformed into a giant ant panics and says, ""Insecticide??!!??""

The doctor in MANT is played by Wllliam Schallert (Patty Duke's dad on her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TV-sitcom/dp/B002ACKBU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TV sitcom</a>). Goodman uses two minor fright film actors to stir up trouble (and publicity) in town by bad mouthing MANT. One of them is Dick Miller, a Roger Corman favorite who ate flowers in THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS (1960)  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS/dp/B00006L94G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS</a>) (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B001BSBBGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>). The other man is John Sayles: actor, writer, editor and director of such films as EIGHT MEN OUT (1988)  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS/dp/6301257898/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS</a>)  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B000059TFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>) and PASSION FISH (1992)  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS/dp/0800127188/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS</a>)  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/0767821432/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>). This also marks Jesse White's last film appearance (he was the Maytag repairman on TV).

Although a point can be made that MATINEE is just a kid's movie, it's also for us older folks who can remember being a youngster in 1962, the music, culture and movies that enriched our lives but also events like the Missile Crisis, which so vividly reminded us in the words of John Kennedy, ""that we are all mortal.""
