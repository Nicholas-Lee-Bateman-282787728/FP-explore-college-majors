4194671,5,B003UAKEAS,"You don't have to be a Brit to love this film directed by Ken Loach. Middle-aged working class postman Eric Bishop seems to carry the weight of post-Blair Britain on his shoulders. All his life has been a dead run from responsibility, and yet he's saddled with two obstreperous sons refusing to grow into responsible men themselves. Only his daughter seems to be making something of herself, raising a baby and getting a degree at college.

As everything comes steadily unglued for Eric, he is visited by charismatic former footballer for Manchester United, Eric Cantona (played by lui-meme). A kind of life coach, he talks almost exclusively in homely aphorisms, which are enough to begin rescuing postman Eric from the train wreck of his life. Shared babysitting duties get him involved again with his first wife, whom he deserted 20 years before.

His attempts at tough love with his sons run up against the elder boy's serious involvement with a smarmy ex-con and his gang. I won't spoil the ending except to say that it involves embarrassing video footage on YouTube. Sounds maybe a bit far-fetched, but anybody who's felt his life go wobbly will identify big time. Great performances all around. For an American ear, you'll need the subtitles.",1286582400,4,1249,4.942857142857143
4194672,4,B003UAKEAS,"Hmm, this wasn't really what I was expecting to be honest, and I'm at a bit of a loss to review it, but I will plough on regardless.
Looking for Eric is not necessarily a search for Mr Cantona, the talismanic player for Manchester United in the mid 90s, although Mr Cantona assists in the search, but more the voyage of postman Eric to come to terms with his own life, the loss of his first love, and the regret he feels for his actions, and the struggles of trying to bring up his 2 wayward teenage step sons in today's Manchester, whilst he himself remains routed in the past.

Mr Cantona assists in this endeavour by appearing as an hallucination bringing Eric the benefits of his Gallic philosophies, as Eric struggles to come to terms with the situation he is in.
Thankfully, Eric has a good bunch of friends; both from his postman job, and from his football interest, FC United of Manchester, illustrates the other main point made in the film.

Eric and his friends represent the traditional working class fanbase of football, who supported Manchester United before they became the prawn sandwich eating ""Pride of Singapore"" and feel disenfranchised by the fact that whilst the local drug dealer has a box at Old Trafford, they cannot afford to attend the games any more. FC United of Manchester was formed by these disenfranchised fans, and these are the people who ultimately come to Eric's aid, when drug dealers threaten Eric's family.

So, the film is a commentary about a man reclaiming his past and his future, and about a group of football supporters reclaiming their heritage. It's quite prescient taking into account the teams in financial difficulty, and yet another Manchester United takeover battle in the offing.

The acting is top notch from this ensemble cast, and Eric Cantona, is, well, Eric Cantona, and his likeability, oddness and charisma come across rather nicely in the film.
So, I am still left feeling this is an odd film, but it charmed me enough to write a serious review about it, so it must have done something right.",1268092800,8,2053,4.726256983240224

8405750,3,B003UAKEAS,"Eric a Postman, sons fathered with women of various ethnicities, struggles to cope with a reality of a single dad and granddad while protecting his grown son from youngster's shadow economics associates by deploying delusive command of then French-British football star Eric Cantona.

8405751,5,B003UAKEAS,"This is one big, all cylinders firing, feel good with enough bitter sweet to choke a rat eating a hamburger. I loved the fat boys Mancunian mens' group. ""Close your eyes and tell us what yer thinkin like"". Yes, predictable there is alwys one thinking of a girl minus her kit-but the ensuing conversation had me on the ground clutching me belly. Shakespearean clowns riding along on that one. Its the working class humour, self effacing and on the make. Now Eric, what can you say. Not a fan of the mancuniuan ponies (away the Toon like and I never forgive them for stealing games and a title off us) but I like Eric. he's like Best, Law and Charlton. You own them regardless of who your tribe is because they were genius (please note Ronaldo is not in that sentence-cheers). So, in this movie Eric the maverick philosopher fits right in. Takes the piss out of hiself. See some of his magic at work on the theatre of dreams green turf. Kung fu anyone? But the man can also act and so he dovetails nicely with Steve Evets. This is a celebration of the resilience and plonkerness of working class men of a certain age (mine) which is why I relate to it. Didn't I just want Eric the postman to win at least one jackpot in life. Good man Loach!",1350604800,,1239,4.344827586206897
8405752,3,B003UAKEAS,"The premise of this movie is terrific--a man down on his luck looks to inspiration from his hero, Manchester United's legendary Eric Cantona who appears as himself in the movie as a sort of mentor to the other Eric the protagonist of the story.

What gets me annoyed most about the story is the progression is way too simplistic. Are we really supposed to believe that this depressed guy finally snaps out of what seems like a 30-year depression just because his friend introduces him to a ""visualization"" technique that opens the door to Eric Cantona offering him advice? It's funny and all but it doesn't quite explain his past 30 years.

Then the fact this scrawny guy can win back the love of his life so quickly is the stuff of movie scripts not reality. Not that I need a movie to be ""real"" but I think this movie is trying to present working class Manchester as a ""real"" place but often it seems more ""Coronation Street"" than anything.

Plus what is never explained is why one of the two sons who live with him is black. Is he adopted? Was Eric the postman married three times as he has three children in the movie?

The climactic scene is hilarious and makes the movie worthwhile (and I won't give it away) as do the Cantona hilite scenes (some of these goals he conjures up in a Utd shirt are the stuff of genius) and the scenes where Cantona offers his philosophy on life to Eric albeit in a mumbly sort of English that is hard to catch at times.

Lastly, you might need a degree in English soccer to follow some of the references. It helped that I knew about the FC United movement, the Selhurst Park incident that got Cantona banned for nine months and the ""seagull"" press conference statement (which you do get to see in the closing credits and is still as ironic and over the British press's heads as ever).

There are zero extras on the DVD other than the boring old deleted scenes and trailers.",1301702400,2,1910,4.427350427350428
8405753,4,B003UAKEAS,"For a middle-aged Manchester postman Eric Bishop (Steve Evets), life couldn't get any worse. Having to meet his first wife Lily (Stephanie Bishop) he abandoned about thirty years ago, Eric panics and causes a traffic accident. His two stepsons Ryan (Gerard Kearns) and Jess (Stefan Gumbs) wouldn't listen to him these days. Moreover, Ryan has involved with a local gangster. Eric thinks he cannot go on when something unusual happens to him.

Before Eric, an avid football fan, Eric Cantona (played by himself), iconic superstar of Manchester United, shows up. While recounting the days as the club's star player, the imaginary footballer gives philosophical advice to Eric, encouraging him to try again and start a new life. Eric Bishop, initially hesitant and not confident as the other Eric, stands up and gradually changes his life.

""Looking for Eric"" directed by Ken Loach (""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"") is much less political than the director's other works, though his naturalist approach remains the same. Some viewers may think it light-hearted for a Ken Loach film, and even call it (rightly) a comedy - and ""Operation Cantona"" is really funny - but the film works more effectively as a character-driven drama, just like any other Ken Loach masterpieces in the past.

The film is not without lulls at times, and those are not into football may miss some of the points the film makes (Eric's reference to the seagulls, for instance). Still, ""Looking for Eric"" is a well-made film with an uplifting message told in an understated way.",1295222400,,1548,5.01556420233463
