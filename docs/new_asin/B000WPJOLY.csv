8224977,5,B000WPJOLY,"This movie was filmed on the 30th Anniversary of the confrontation between the United States Government and its supporters on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, and a  coalition of traditional Indians and members of the American Indian Movement.  The 71 day Seige resulted in two Indians being killed, seven people wounded, and years of federal prosecutions of those inside.  One US Marshall was wounded.  It is a powerfully emotional documentary intended to show how this moment in American Indian history transformed those who were involved, and led them to serve Indian tribes and  tribal peoples all around the United States.  It is a compelling movie.  Highly recommended.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Tattoo-On-My-Heart-The-Warriors-of-Wounded-Knee-1973/dp/B000WPJOLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Tattoo On My Heart: The Warriors of Wounded Knee 1973</a>",1262304000,5,908,6.516666666666667
