8280812,5,B0000950ZO,BEST DvDs out there for kids who want to learn and have fun!! My oldest son and daughter are both Autistic and absolutely LOVE these DvDs. The songs are addicting and the kids learn so quick! Highly recommend!!,1414972800,,210,4.552631578947368
8280813,4,B0000950ZO,The series is fantastic. However these particular copies appeared copied to me. The price is low for a reason!!!! They play fine but are not original. Seller did offer to take them back however due to an unforeseen circumstance I was unable to follow through. And at this point and time I am not going to bother. The series itself is great and educational however if you insist on originals maybe look elsewhere.,1413331200,,412,4.657534246575342
