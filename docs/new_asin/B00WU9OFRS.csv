8714269,5,B00WU9OFRS,"First off, I see the ratings for this film are skewed due to someone complaining about a damaged PRODUCT. Note to GENIUS: YOU ARE REVIEWING THE FILM ITSELF!! NOT THE CONDITION OF THE PACKAGE YOU RECEIVED!! AMAZON, how do you allow a review like this?
Onto the film: this film carries the notoriety it does, due to a particularly gruesome scene that, back in the day, was TABOO. BUT IT IS ALSO A SOLID HORROR FILM REGARDLESS. A group of people are stranded on a remote island with no means of escape. They discover that the sole inhabitant is a deranged CANNIBAL KILLER. This is a tense, well-made slice of euro-horror that today, is virtually non-existent. VERY highly recommended!",1528243200,2,681,4.73109243697479

Tourists take a boat to a remote island, where they find that most of the people have disappeared, and something is stalking them and killing them,

This is a pretty cheesy old early 80's movie with allot of hype about being the all time video nasty, its really not! Don't get me wrong its still certainly a cult classic horror with a good cast and great locations, there is plenty of bloody gore here and there, mainly towards the last half of the movie, the acting is pretty cheesy most of the time, it doesn't help when the English soundtrack is slightly out in places throughout the film, and the entire opening of the film is terribly dubbed and not in English at all, this movie certainly has all the right elements for a classic horror/thriller mainly with the great gore scenes which is what makes it special, there are better early 80's snuff films out there but still check this out if your a fan as the features are worth the money too.

The 88 films release has a great Documentary called 42nd street memories: The rise and fall of Americas most notorious block, which talks about 42nd street and the memories various movie stars and directors-producers have of it, with interviews and footage from the time of the old movie theatres etc, great informative documentary (Over an hour long) Also trailers.
