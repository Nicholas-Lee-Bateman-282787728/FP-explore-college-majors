2458427,5,B000CCZR7M,Included all the years of the space age of Nasa in one tin. Exceded all of my expectations. Definately worth price.,1357603200,,115,4.523809523809524
2458428,1,B000CCZR7M,"I've bought other Madacy DVD's in the past. Each time, I hoped that the quality would get better...but it never does! I swore after this latest set that I would never buy another Madacy product.
  You cannot judge the titles on the DVD's...they were produced by NASA in the best quality.. However, the re-recording process they use is really bad. You would think the company could do better if they are going to produce these DVD's in the future. My advice? Look for the titles from other sources. These NASA documentaries are available in much better quality from anybody else!
  One positive thing about Madacy Video...they use good quality packaging, and DVD disk labels. Too bad thats' as far as their workmanship goes!",1269475200,11,723,4.853658536585366
2458429,3,B000CCZR7M,"The documentaries are interesting. However, the quality is horrible. The video is grainy and compressed even on the newer documentaries. The colors are faded. The audio sounds like it was played from a Vinyl LP. This is everything you would expect from a Madacy boxed set.",1242604800,6,272,4.934782608695652
2458430,4,B000CCZR7M,"According to another website, these are the specific documentaries included.  Many of these are available on other DVD products.  The fifth disc seems to have some newer material and might be worth the price of admission all by itself.

2458431,4,B000CCZR7M,"Very nicely presented gift set 0f 5 DVD's in a cool looking tin. A real thrill for all you space junkies out there, and I am one too!! Well organized discs, lots of menu options, and I like the little quiz at the end of each disc, to see if you've been paying attention!! Overall well worth the small $, even if you are ultimately very familiar with the subject matter and film clips. Have not seen the Ultimate NASA DVD's yet, but they have an extra couple of hours viewing, and we space junkies can always use more!",1204329600,7,517,4.232323232323233
2458432,3,B000CCZR7M,"We bought this set thinking we were in for some educational and informative entertainment. Not! We are NASA Buffs and we're let down by the ending. We followed every step of the Columbia, from take off to it's sad disater when it actually took place. But this DVD does not even explain ANY details of what happened to our heros. It covers their lives and how they gave their lives for mankind, but not anything about the disater. We didn't expect to see anything gruesome, but we wanted to know more about our lost astronauts. And it only spent about 5 minutes on the unfortunate fire onboard the Apollo 12. Such a let down.",1177372800,5,624,4.482456140350878
2458433,3,B000CCZR7M,"While this set presents plenty of very interesting NASA produced documentaries, its image quality leaves much to be desired. It is understandable that most videos are more than 30 years old, so one can't expect DV like resolutions. However, the image quality in the first 4 discs is at best comparable to a typical VHS tape.

The 5th disc -- which covers the ISS and recent shuttle flights such as John Glenn's and Columbia's disaster -- has better video, but it's still similar to a PAL video broadcast. So while the content is unique to DVD series, be aware that the transfer leaves much to be desired. If you're hoping to find high resolution footage of the space vehicles in all their glory (as I was), this shortcoming may be quite disappointing.

As an unrelated note, my set had no region encoding. This is reasonable since NASA material is released to the public domain and shouldn't be published in a restricted format.",1099699200,26,928,4.722222222222222
2458434,5,B000CCZR7M,"I have always been amazed by NASA and all of the moon landings and the space shuttles. This set is all a NASA fan could hope for. It goes into great detail on things like the Challenger disaster, Moon landings, the space shuttles and the Hubble telescope. I bought it thinking that it would be like the Discovery Channel shows but there is more to it. The 5 discs run a little over 11 hours long total. It includes some stuff about the Columbia disaster. It does a thing on the crew members and the shuttle itself. The only thing I did not like was it did not go in detail of the shuttle coming apart. It did not show it happening or did it explain what caused it to happen it just talked about it and showed what the crew did during the mission. The Challenger was given almost an hour on its disaster which was worth the 28 dollars by itself. Over all very interesting and informative. If your a Space and NASA kind of person you can not go wrong with this set.",1076716800,21,963,4.182795698924731

8097824,1,B000CCZR7M,"There's a reason this set is so cheap: it's nothing but raw public domain footage. Nothing is even remastered so the AV quality is terrible. No interviews, no context, no explanation of the programs, science or people involved. There are infinitely better NASA documentaries out there.",1405987200,,285,5.217391304347826
