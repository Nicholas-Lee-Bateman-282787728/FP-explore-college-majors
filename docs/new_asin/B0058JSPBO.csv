8461632,5,B0058JSPBO,Love it,1484265600,,7,3.0
8461633,1,B0058JSPBO,"I'd first like to say that I love this series. It is my absolute favorite anime. I'm probably a bit biased after watching it with third-party subs (many times over) long before watching this licensed English release. Also, based on what the other negative reviewers say, NISA might have re-released the set since a few things sound too different. I should also mention that I have a fair understanding of the Japanese language, but not strong enough such that I can understand all Japanese media. For the more hardened translation enthusiasts, let me also add that I prefer translator notes over poor localization. The set comes with Blurays, but I don't own a Bluray player so I have no comment on the BDs vs DVDs.

Now that that's out of the way, let me just say that this release is BAD. Not just bad, terrible. Awful. Unprofessional. Ugly. It boggles the mind how bad this translation job really is. Let me break it down a little bit.

Presentation:
The render of the actual subtitles is pixel-jagged and hard on the eyes at full screen.
 Contrary to the other reviewer, the subtitles may be too large, but not distractingly so.
The episodes begin to play right after inserting the disc, not bothering to go to a menu interface.
 I actually stumbled upon a main menu after hitting the chapter skip button too many times.
The subtitles can actually be turned on/off, being the sole option in the ""Setup"" menu.
In the DVDs, there is noticeable banding in the colors.

Subtitle Translation Job:
They way most characters are translated, it's like they speak as if trying to sound ""old"" or ""oriental"". There is a ton of awkwardness in phrasing and wording because of this, making everyone sound long-winded. It generally fails to sound genuine, as if they went into MS Word and constantly found the fanciest synonym they could for every word longer than one syllable. Example: In Japanese, someone in the shows says ""Wakaran."", a very short, informal way to say ""I don't understand/know."" A tool as simple and unreliable as Google Translate could tell you the same. This gets translated to ""I fail to comprehend this."" It's a joke of a translation, adding formalities and being generally long-winded.
The translator(s) seem to loosen up a bit maybe around episode 8 or 9, less awkward wording in general, but it's still there. Jokes and wordplay are left un-translated/localized. Unexplained puns fall flat to the English-speaking audience.
Sword names are never translated during viewing, even as reference for the audience's sake. For example, when the second sword, Namakura, is discussed, its ""blunt"" name's irony is unexplained. Hitei (Lady Denial)'s name is translated literally which normally wouldn't bug me so much. While watching third-party subs, her name is left as is, but having a good ear or figuring out eventually based on her speech pattern that she often denies things is at least made more obvious for the audience in these licensed subs. What bothers me is what doesn't get translated literally. Names like the Maniwas' names are untranslated, despite them being named after animals with perfectly fine translations existing. I just don't get their reasoning as to why they didn't translate names as simple and obvious as Bat, Butterfly, Phoenix or even Penguin, which is a borrowed word in Japanese to begin with. Again, consistency. If they want to do a literal translation job, like with Lady Denial, they could've at least done the Maniwa and even the sword names.
Many proper terms are left untranslated despite there being real translations that exist:
 -Ryu
 -Ryuha
 -Ningun
Many proper terms are given awkward translations:
 -Stratagemist (Yes, technically the joke is it's supposed to sound dumb and I'm probably biased towards the fan translations, but this is just a mouthful)
 -(Maniwa) Shadows
 -Shichi Ka Hachi Retsu: Neo (Neo isn't a bad for ""Kai"", meaning a new or redone version of something, but again, consistency in what is translated and what isn't)
Lastly, the most glaringly terrible translation, Mastercraft Klesha Bringers. No one I've talked to understands why they possibly chose this since there was no reason to translate it like this. The Japanese phrase is ""Kanseikei Hentaitou"" literally, ""Perfect Strange/Weird Sword(s)"", fan translated pleasantly to ""Perfected Deviant Blade(s)"". Klesha are apparently vices in Buddhism, but such things are not part of the story in any way and no swords really embody klesha. Bringers also seems like weird terminology.
On screen Kanji flashes for special attacks are translated on and off. Strangely, the Kyotouryu flower attacks are translated into their Romaji during the flashes, but this feels awkward because the characters always say the attacks aloud before the flash, but there they are translated in English.

Spelling/grammatical errors are somewhat rare, but present, possibly masked by all the long-winded language.

The Good:
Some (very, very few) subtleties in the language are translated well, maybe better than the fan translation.

Other:
The guidebook that comes with the discs includes a glossary of terms. Yes, a glossary. Let's be real here, there is little reason this series really needed a glossary to explain all of its terminology. Some terms are plainly obvious; you might have more trouble remembering names of characters that haven't been discussed or seen for a few episodes. That being said, some of the explanations and translations offered are helpful. The annoying thing is stuff like translations for the sword names are offered HERE, of all places, instead of on-screen.

The art books that come with the discs are nothing special. It has the wallpaper set for each episode, some promotional vector art from Take (the original character designer), and some character stills for the anime adaptation. However, the booklets themselves are so small, it's kind of unimpressive. You could find better scans of most of the content online with some Google searches or in the official art books for the show.

While it doesn't say it's in the set, I was asked this before so I'll mention it here: There is no original soundtrack (OST) included.

Conclusion:
Don't drop money on this. NIS America doesn't deserve a penny it gets from this mess of a translation job. I know some critics (like the ones on Anime News Network) use these (probably because they have to) when reviewing a show, so do me and yourself a favor and don't bother reading their reviews either. The experience is seriously tarnished by the terrible translation job, making me wonder how much of the plot a viewer actually comprehends if they hadn't already seen the third-party subs to make sense of everything, beforehand.

Fanboy last words:
This is an amazing series and it saddens me it got such a terrible English release. I read the other negative review(s) long before buying the set, mostly because I was interested in the art book, but even that was nothing too special. Third-party subs you can find wherever are much better and more thought was clearly put into the translation effort.",1411776000,4,7083,5.034158838599487
8461634,5,B0058JSPBO,"The book is great if explaining to someone about the show, definitely a collectors item. The price may seem like a bit much, but remember each episode is roughly 1 hour long, so in contrast to movies/shows of different prices it really isn't a lot. A lot of us first watched this video when it was fan subbed, and the name Deviant Blades was used. They have changed that name, but it is an official subbing. Some may not like this *one little thing* however I do not mind since maybe the fans that subbed for us were wrong.

Anyway I loved this series and so has everyone I have shown it to, ranging from 14-70 years old (9 people total). This series is absolutely beautiful from beginning to end. And if for some reason you are too soft/childish to grasp the ending, then please just stop watching anime and go back to hollywood shooter films.",1386115200,,844,4.410256410256411
8461635,4,B0058JSPBO,"Not really a fan of the big A4 format, but this is really a collector item !
I like the stong artbox, hardcover book with episodes summaries and artworks (not enough to my taste).",1370563200,,179,4.294117647058823
8461636,4,B0058JSPBO,"Just picked this up a bit ago, so I don't have a ton to say about it but so far what I've seen is impressive! The audio and visual are great and the story is interesting. The translation seems fine to me -- some of the phrases come across as overly formal, but that appears to be on purpose and seems fitting for the characters. I didn't notice any glaring grammatical errors and I write and edit writing for a living.

Also, I'm not sure why the other reviewer was so angry the subtitles couldn't be turned off. I cannot speak japanese (like most american anime viewers), so I didn't care if I could turn off or on the subtitles. I kind of need them to be able to understand what is going on!

Finally, the subtitles didn't seem to small to me. I watched it on a 42"" TV and it was perfectly reasonable. I wouldn't want to watch it on my iphone, but then agian my iphone doesn't have a blu-ray player. :)

Overall, this looks like another solid entry from NISA. I wouldn't let the 1 star reviewer's negative feedback scare you away from what is a great anime.",1318550400,8,1059,4.232673267326732
8461637,1,B0058JSPBO,"Ok, first off, let me say this: I actually really Like Katanagatari. I thought the ending was kinda a let down, but overall its a very good series. I would love to give this a recommendation, but NISA really screwed this release up. Visually it looks pretty good. NISA has a history of messing up something or another with the video on their releases, so it was nice to see it done right here. The problem is in the translation. Its VERY bad. I mean, borderline Chinese bootleg bad. I don't know what happened here. I had to constantly stop and rewind the show to try to figure out what they were trying to say. Togames lines were especially bad.

There's a lot of clunky lines like using ""ice burn"" instead of ""frost burn."" which make reading the subs painful, but the biggest problem are the myriad of lines in the show where there seemed to be no quality control or editing whatsoever. I swear this is a real line:
""I don't recall granting you to do such a thing!"" Look it up. Its on episode 05 at the 42.22 mark. Sadly lines like that are not a rare occurrence. They pop up constantly and really ruin the show. I don't know what happened but the translation and editing is an utter mess in this release

Some other prime examples of the poor translation:
-Do not translate any of the sword names
-Princess Hitei is called Lady Denial
-The swords/Deviant blades are called Klesha bringers (what?)
-Too many horrible horrible translation/editing errors. Stuff like: ""I have played the role of reprimand more than sufficiently"" (ep 6 30.31). These are everywhere, its really inexcusable. I feel like im watching a Chinese bootleg, or badly done fansub.

There's more but I don't want this to get too long. I checked the Translator and editor credits with this show against the one for NISA's Working! dvd's, which were done pretty well. The translator for both is Ryuta Sato. However for Katanagatari the editor is Nick Doerr, whereas for Working it was Steven Carlton. Im going to assume the screw up was on Mr. Carltons end, but im really not sure. Whatever the reason this release feels completely amateurish.

Its also worth mentioning 2 other big problems with the show:
First, the subtitles are VERY tiny. The smallest I've ever seen. They are very hard to read. Second, they can not be turned off! Thats right, this show is pretty much hard-subbed. There is no option at all to remove the subtitles. This is the kind of show you actually would want to take them off to watch the fight scenes, but you cant do that. Im assuming this was some kinda licensing agreement to prevent reverse importing but I wish I had been aware of this at purchase.

summary of positives and negatives:
-----------------------------------
+Video and audio is pretty good with no major problems to be seen. LPCM 2.0 though, 5.1 or something would have been nicer.
+packaging is great! art cards and book are neat
+Characters and story are endearing, If you can understand what they're trying to say

-Locked subtitles. You can not turn them off
-Subtitles are absurdly tiny and hard to read
-Seemingly no quality control with the translation. This is Chinese bootleg level bad. See the two examples above, there are MANY more. Typos, poor editing choices, and lines that just make no sense are the norm here.
-Inconsistent translation. I.E. translating some things but not others. Princess Hitei = Lady Denial, but they don't translate any of the Sword names? Klesha bringers for the swords?

Final Verdict: Pass/Do not buy
BOTTOM LINE: Great show, but this is an almost unwatchable localization job. I can not recommend people purchase this.

I really cant emphasize how bad this translation is. I honestly felt like I had purchased some Chinese bootleg instead of an official US release directly through the distributor. Other than flat out typos and mistakes, the wording is so clunky and piss poor that the show makes little to no sense. Coupled with the locked and tiny subtitles, I would not recommend this as a purchase at all. Do not buy this release. I hate to say that, because its a pretty great show, but NISA just screwed this release up far too bad",1316044800,56,4148,4.6960110041265475
8461638,5,B0058JSPBO,"With its truly unique style and fascinating story, I think  Katanagatari is destined to become one of my favorites.

I only vaguely remember having heard anything about the series (I'm not really all that big on following the new shows until they're licensed here) but couldn't help but want it after seeing the gorgeous artwork blown up to heroic size on a wall at the NIS America booth at Anime Expo 2011. After one brief look at a sample of the superb art book that comes with the Premium Edition Volume 1 set, I had no problem shelling out the $60.00 they were asking even without knowing about the show itself.

One additional bonus that I hadn't even recognized until I was reading the box on the train home, is that it's a Blu-ray/DVD combo set! And let me tell you, it is truly beautiful on Blu-ray. The anime style is really quite unique--the characters are done in very saturated, super-rich colors and an almost stylized, block color way, but the backgrounds are in a much softer and more detailed style--almost like watercolors in some places. The effect is truly striking, and a spectacle not to be missed (on Blu-ray especially).

But it's the story and format that are so compelling. This original 2010 series is composed of twelve hour-long episodes that were originally aired once a month in Japan. Set in a somewhat stylized Sengoku Jidai period, the main protagonists are on a search for twelve legendary swords scattered about the country--the so-called ""Mastercraft Klesha Bringers"". Togame is our heroine: an emissary of the Bakufu, a so-called ""Stratagemist"". Her first encounter is to enlist the help of the master of the Kyoto Ryu sword style--unique because although it is a ""sword style"", its practitioners don't actually use a physical sword. Instead, they themselves ""become"" the sword. It turns out that our main protagonist and last master of this school, Yasuri Shichika, has lived in exile on an island with his sister, only becoming the school's master after the death of his father.

I don't really want to go into a lot of detail with a review (trying all the while to avoid spoilers), so I will just say that Shichika agrees to become Togame's sword and accompany her on her quest. Each hourlong episode then, is the quest and battle for one of the missing swords. An hour also gives a lot of time to explore the rich story, steeped in Japanese history and legend--I absolutely love this stuff. With the stunning visuals and a constant musical background (another thing that is quite unique), it is an absolute feast for the senses. Not to mention that the story, plot and character actions engage you on a lot of different levels, including ones that you don't actually see on-screen but merely exist, perhaps only in the back of your mind. Some of the episodes are pretty straightforward, others leave a lot to ponder afterwards--and some are quite shocking and even surprisingly brutal (#4, Hakuto Hari, springs instantly to mind).

Premium Edition Volume 1 contains the first six episodes in two thin pack cases each holding a DVD and Blu-ray disc (4 discs total) and the aforementioned hardcover art book, all in a sturdy and attractive slipcase that is a hallmark of NIS America's premium releases. I would highly recommend this series--and cannot wait until part two comes out!",1309996800,21,3321,4.838028169014085
