1423168,5,B00005BHW6,"I really don't know where to begin.  This film is as nearly perfect as you can get.  Every facet of great filmmaking is flawlessly displayed to absolute perfection in Michelangelo Antonioni's, L'Avventura.  This is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.
L'Avventura is all about relationships.  The relationships between the main characters and also the territory they inhabit. Needless to say, topography plays an important role in this film and thus becomes an outside character in of itself.
When viewing for the first time, pay special attention to the deliberate pacing of the film.  It's very bold and lyrical in its approach.  Motion pictures aren't made like this anymore and you'll be pleasantly surprised that there is very little intrusion or manipulation by the director.  Antonioni really lets this film breathe naturally; nothing is hurried or out of place.
This is really the perfect film.
I won't talk anymore about this landmark motion picture; it would be sacreligious to ruin a great experience for you.",983232000,3,1030,5.168674698795181
1423169,1,B00005BHW6,"The same people who love this movie also probably enjoyed Fellini's  ""La Dolce Vita"" which is another piece of meaningless drivel. As  far as I'm concerned, Fellini's work is pure genius until the  60's--probably influenced by Antonioni's work on ""L'Aveventura"".  The scenery is certainly beautiful and the camera shots are very well done,  but I found the actors to be wooden at best, and the story to be  uninteresting.  The best part of the film--the Hitchcockian  disappearance--is never resolved, and it seems like a weak plot device to  get the two lead characters together.
Save your money and buy some of  Fellini's work from the 50's...""La Strada"" and ""Nights of  Cabiria"" are worthwhile films with moving stories that have a definite  beginning, middle and end.
L'Avventura never ends...at least until I hit  ""STOP"" on my VCR..I just couldn't sit through this 2+ hours.",969148800,17,879,5.062937062937063
1423170,5,B00005BHW6,"Oddly enough at the time of its release this film was highly praised but also booed. One of the main complaints is that nothing really ever happens in the film. The characters are presented with a problem; a lost woman in a  deserted island, after a while they give up the search and it never reaches  a conclusion. But the story really never was the attractive feature of the  film. The mood and the emotional rhythm are uniquely wonderful, it is also  a film rich with multi-layered meanings. Monica Vitti is ravishing as the  complicated Claudia, she is truly a sight to behold, the most fascinating  face and profile since Garbo. A subtle study of the idle decay of the rich  and bored. The scenes on the island are unforgettably beautiful, mostly  because of the haunting cinematography. Considered to be the flip side of  Fellini's 'La Dolce Vita', both portray the decay of the rich and both have  unsettling endings. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!",964224000,4,967,4.60233918128655
1423171,5,B00005BHW6,"Antonioni has conveyed the spiritual malaise of our age in a film that, granted, moves at a snail's pace and demands the attention and involvement of it's audience. The effort involved is worth the trouble because  L'Avventura builds into a powerful experience. Some have viewed the film as  Marxist tract against the idle rich but it is more than just that.  Non-caring egotism,spiritual emptiness, easy betrayal are some of the major  themes. The disappearance of Anna is more of a plot device than anything  else; don't get too hung up on it as it is not one of Antonioni's main  concerns. A worthy ""companion"" piece to Fellini's La Dolce Vita  and one of the masterpieces of international cinema.",964051200,6,700,4.88135593220339
1423172,5,B00005BHW6,"This director creates meditative films that are certainly not propelled by action or overt themes; his audience is, thus, small, but devoted.  The beauty of ""L'Avventura"" was not so apparent to me until I had the  great pleasure of watching a new print on a wide screen the way it was  conceived and intended.  Admittedly, I'm a big fan of Monica Vitti; I'd  probably pay to watch her sit and loll about in anything.  This film exerts  a certain pull over me because of its focus of spatial relationships and  textures, its lovely compositions which make the emotional barreness of its  characters all the more distressing.  Sure, it's an acquired taste, and  will probably not garner any new fans in the age of attention deficit  disorder, but the pleasures of letting it slowly work its understated magic  on one amount to much more than just surmising it's two and half hours of  rich people being aimless.  Antonioni cared about the beauty of the natural  world, about humans retaining virtue and honesty and meaning in  relationships.  It may not rank as ""entertainment"" to watch a  world where these qualities have seriously eroded, but it certainly does  approach and sometimes achieve art.",962150400,33,1197,4.89
1423173,5,B00005BHW6,"L'Avventura has a certain strangeness that goes beyond the archetypal film plot.

When I finally did, years later I was mystified as to why it was chosen.  Since then I've seen other Antonioni pictures and to me, his films are the  archetypes of the annoying foreign film pretending to reveal the deep  mysteries of life to you but delivering nothing.  The rich often lead  shallow aimless lives.  No kidding.  A dope like Kurt Cobain could figure  that out too and only take up three minutes of my time in saying it.

1423409,4,B00005BHW6,L'Avventura is only for those who enjoy watching people through film. It is true that nothing happens. It is all about character interaction.

1423410,5,B00005BHW6,"When cinema had been around for 50 years, it had a midlife crisis from being weighed down as an artform, mainly by stories, acting, and music. Cinema gets reinvigorated every so often by the Kubricks, Bergmans, Fellinis, Lynches, & Tarantinos, with films like Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Easy Rider, or Last Year at Marienbad, etc.. The first film to align cinema with contemporary consciousness was L'Avventura: (it was mainstream Italian, not experimental), thus the highest recommendation one can award it is all the vicious negative reviews it STILL garners from Philistines today as it did when it was released: THIS ALONE may let you know that it is your kind of movie- because you appreciate it for exactly what it is, and not complain about what it isn't. Granted, Antonioni does tacitly exploit the tired preconceived expectations of pre-1960 movies
to steer cinema into new unreassuring waters; because of l'Avventura, cinema is no longer merely theatrical, but can often be incidental and unpredictable like existence itself.
I find this dvd version of the movie SUPERBLY enhanced by the segment of the cerebrally stimulating insights of Olivier Assayas, as well as the running commentary. So if you like curious black & white movies that are absurdly well-framed, subdued yet interesting, challenging yet not jarring- like Marienbad, Dolce Vita, Night of the Wolf, Orphe, La Notte, or L'Eclisse, or just want to learn about cinematography, I would sway you to check out L'Avventura, especially this dvd version for the illuminating bonus features: other versions are listed with loads of damning dismissive reviews by viewers who didn't ""get"" it;- This should enhance your fascination; for the money, you're assured a purchase that you'll want to rewatch it often, and attentively (maybe even addictively like myself: everyday is a good day to rescrutinize l'Avventura, maybe even twice) which is the payoff from movies made so boldly and meticulously with great care and dedication by a maestro like Antonioni.",1440115200,4,2020,5.256965944272446
1423411,4,B00005BHW6,"A film I need to see again, and wouldn't be surprised to love more on repeated viewings. I appreciate Antonioni's magnificent framing and images, his bravery with unconventional plotting; (e.g. having his true 'main character' disappear 10 minutes in). It's legendarily slow pace didn't bother me at all, but I did find the insights into the characters, how empty and desperate they are somewhat repetitive over time. I'll admit to moments of feeling 'yeah, I got it already'.

Antonioni brilliantly uses lonely landscapes to show how isolated these people are. But some of the performances didn't thrill me (there's a key difference between playing a shallow character and being a shallow actor, and it sometimes seems confused here).

It stayed a very intellectual experience - an essay about the lack of humanity in the upper classes beautifully illustrated. But it seemed so removed and exaggerated, even from my own comfy existence, that I found I wasn't moved on a deeper level.

That said, all these same criticisms could be aimed at 'Barry Lyndon', a film I have come to love deeply on repeated viewings. Like that film, I suspect I'll see much more next time I watch it. The telling thing is I find myself anxious to re-see it, in spite of it's challenges.",1439510400,,1265,4.901869158878505
1423412,1,B00005BHW6,"Meandering, tepid story that goes on waaayyy too long.  The director apparently found this story fascinating but it isn't for the viewer.

Monica Vitti is remarkable, so beautiful and stunning. Watch it, and then watch it with the accompanying commentary. At the very least, you'll be prepared to discuss (or diss) it at your next cocktail party. (Do young people even care anymore about this sort of thing?)",1418083200,3,542,4.705263157894737
1423415,4,B00005BHW6,"LAvventura,"" directed by Michelangelo Antonioni in 1960, is about the enigmatic disappearance of a young woman, Anna (Lea Massari), daughter of an Italian diplomat, during a yachting trip off the coast of Sicily, and the search taken up by her disaffected lover, Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), and best friend Claudia (Monica Vitti). During the search, Sandro and Claudia fall for each other. The second part of the film focuses on the couples tortured affair, rife with guilt and regret. They go to great lengths to find out what happened to Anna, but their motivations have definitely shifted. If, after all, shes never found, they can pursue their affair unencumbered by guilt.

The films group of wealthy characters are privileged, easily bored, and incapable of expressing real love and respect. To them only lust and desire matter. These are not terribly likable people.

Antonioni paces the film slowly, reflecting the tedium of the pleasure-seeking hedonists on board the yacht. Annas disappearance seems more an irritating inconvenience to them than a serious missing-person tragedy. This movie paints a complex picture of decadence, questionable contemporary values, and rudderless youth.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray edition include audio commentary, a three-part analysis of the film, the 58-minute documentary Antonioni Documents and Testimonials, writings by Antonioni read by actor Jack Nicholson, and a critical essay.",1416787200,,1431,5.525114155251141

1423430,1,B00005BHW6,"I am in the minority opinion, but I found the film vastly uninteresting.  The characters are inherently unlikable; thus, I was left detached from any of their emotions, motivations, fates.  By the time a female character vanishes from an island, she had been characterized as so superficial I wondered why she would be missed or why anyone would go on a massive undertaking to find her.",1399420800,5,386,4.833333333333333
1423431,1,B00005BHW6,"This movie is endless - not timeless.
Praise is due to the initial audience  from Cannes which had
no problem recognizing a sham and booed it off the screen.
Unfortunately,  a few critics somewhat detached from reality
were later enough to sway the weak minded and so now we're
stuck with it years and years later long after it should have died.

The few well photographed scenes wouldn't have been able to save
the picture even if it were only half its length.  The characters are neither
likable nor sympathetic - they have only time and money on their hands
but no direction so they could spend an eternity and never make any
progress or achieve any self knowledge.

The film is not character driven - open them up and find that they are empty -
nor plot driven - how could it be, there is none.  It's simply a miscalculation
and it's about time we stopped pretending otherwise.

1423458,5,B00005BHW6,"Michelangelo Antonioni is a polarizing figure in the film community. You either love him or you hate him. Me? I absolutely love his films! L'Avventura is one of most enigmatic films I have ever seen. L'Avventura tells the story of the disappearance of a young woman and how (if) it affects the other characters in the film. The film stars Monica Vitti and Gabriele Ferzetti as the only two people with any conviction as to actually find out what happened to her. Along the way, even they lose interest with their missing friend, and become much more interested in each other. The fate of the missing girl is hardly a misnomer. The film is wonderfully acted and the script is so good it can cause a delirious side-effect of awesomeness. Most impressive is how L'Avventura looks, and the thing looks gorgeous, possibly the best camera work done in an Antonioni film.

The film's star, Monica Vitti is one of the most beautiful women ever photographed. You honestly can't your eyes off of her. In contrast to her stunning appearance, the character she portrays is soulless. Empty. Then you start to realize that's the point of it all. Everything looks beautiful in L'Avventura, but it's all empty. From the characters to the very world they inhabit, its all a heartless vacuum of emptiness. But God, it looks unbelievable. The emptier you are, the more beautiful you become. Antonioni communicates a great deal here about humanity. About vanity. About waste.

The acting is very impressive. Monica Vitti turns in the best performance of her film career, as does Gabriele Ferzetti. Another top-notch performance is given by Lea Massari as the woman who goes missing. In her brief amount of screen time she lays down a mesmerizing performance. She plays her character as displaced, jaded, and finally waking up to the world around her. To the emotions she is actually feeling. She is not as empty as the rest, its almost as if she can recognize the emptiness in her soul and it makes her sad. So when she finally does go missing, the audience really has no clue what actually happened to her. Massari plays the part so well that the cause of the disappearance could be wide variety of things. An accident? A murder? Did she kill herself? Did she run away? Her performance is so eerie that it haunts the rest of the film. Vitti's character treats her as you would a phantom, and so do we. Did she even exist? Did she actually exist at all? Lea Massari is the phantom, but Monica Vitti is the enigma. Why is she so mysterious? Why is she so damn alluring? Monica Vitti is an intoxicating force to be reckoned with here, and by the end of the film, you still never really get to know her. Because truthfully she isn't anyone. She is a ghost that's afraid of scaring herself. She is the ghost of a good thing. The most visually stunning haunt in the entire cinematic universe.

I actually always looked at L'Avventura as the Arthouse's most intelligent and legitimately scary ghost story. I always viewed the characters not so much as actual people, but as impressions of living things. A practical joke on behalf of the living. Monica Vitti seems to be the only one who isn't in on the joke, as she struggles with losing her humanity. But alas, she is so beautiful that she is unreal, she is ghostly, something so perfect she must be an apparition. A mirage. An imitation of life. And the film never judges its specimens. Not once does Antonioni pass any judgement on the characters whatsoever. You see what you want to see.

L'Avventura is also an Antonioni anti-mystery. The film sets you up for it, you think you recognize the give-away thematic elements, and then it takes you somewhere else entirely whilst the mystery takes a back seat. This would not be the last time Antonioni would take Hitchcockian themes and dissect them. He was known for turning film on its head. He was always exploring the boundaries of film, and he enjoyed it. He was an artist first and foremost, and L'Avventura was his Mona Lisa.

L'Avventura is one of the great treasures of the cinema. One of my all-time favorite films ever made, and one of the most mysterious films in my collection. I am awe-struck by Antonioni's vision, startled by it really. I am taken aback, my heart leaps out of my chest at such a beautiful sight when such an empty truth is underlying all notions of attraction. Attraction can be such an empty feeling. It's only when forced to live with said-attraction, that empty emotion, that it starts to haunt you.",1369440000,8,4510,4.667924528301887
1423459,5,B00005BHW6,"54 years after it was made, the film delights with subtle and mysterious beauty!

Contextual clarity is tightly interwoven with moral conundrum and esthetic elusiveness in this lyrical pulse of vitality, which produces an irresistibly passionate flow of emotional responses.

Of course, one has to approach it with yearning for something new, beautiful and not immediately discernible, i.e., how we usually approach art. L'Avventura still feels new and beautiful, but is now easily discernible through a great legacy of enchanted followers.

1423466,4,B00005BHW6,"""L'Avventura"" marks the beginning of Antonioni's maestro phase of the 1960s, after which he created other great works such as ""L'Eclisse"" and ""Red Desert"".  Although I still don't know if I love it--there is much about ""L'Avventura"" that I admire--especially the cinematography (by Aldo Scavarda) that makes use of architecture and the Sicilian countryside in the composition of its scenes.  How the picture looks is ultimately as important as whatever meaning it has for the viewer.  What was strange about this film in 1960 will probably be much more palatable in 2012.  That is if the ADD generation will have enough patience to slow down and let themselves become ""meditative"" while watching it.  The initial big event in the film--the ""Disappearance of Anna""--reveals to the viewer the various characters' indifference as to what has happened to Anna (Lea Massari), the lover of Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti).  Said characters are too caught up in their own dramas and intrigue to be concerned about anything outside of their respective selves.  Claudia (Monica Vitti) is the only one who seems to possess any compassion for Anna.  Questions abound--on the surface Anna seems tough, but her character is a mystery.  Does Anna disappear because she is too fragile to deal with her relationship with Sandro?  Is she too sensitive for the callousness of modern life?  Or is she too callous herself?  It's as if each of the characters--even Claudia--have an existential inner monologue that queries: ""Life goes on.  Too bad about Anna !!!  But what else can we do ???  We have to keep going.  Life is never fair.""  Which is frankly giving them too much credit--the characters are caught up in the routine of their upper-class malaise and are often as interested in suffering--as they are in enjoying light-hearted, jet-set-style insouciance of their cushy lives hanging out in 5-star hotels.  Simplicity is key in this picture--less is more--while the characters search for Anna on a desolate island--all one hears is the sounds of the waves and the wind.  There is a brilliant shot in chapter 12 of this DVD of Claudia looking out from the door of the island shack at the morning sunrise; even in L'Avventura's world of spiritual desolation, beauty abounds.  Although the pace of this film could be described as languid--in chapter 19 of this DVD there is an ""action"" scene involving a prostitute, posing as a writer, being mobbed by the paparazzi that reminds me of a similar scene with Anita Ekberg from Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" (""La Dolce Vita"" is heavily referenced among the other Amazon reviews of this film--for various reasons).  In closing--I have not yet watched ""L'Avventura"" with the commentary by film historian Gene Youngblood--though I plan on doing so--as I did not want his opinions to influence my review of this picture.

Antonioni brilliantly uses lonely landscapes to show how isolated these people are. But some of the performances didn't thrill me (there's a key difference between playing a shallow character and being a shallow actor, and it sometimes seems confused here).

It stayed a very intellectual experience - an essay about the lack of humanity in the upper classes beautifully illustrated. But it seemed so removed and exaggerated, even from my own comfy existence, that I found I wasn't moved on a deeper level.

That said, all these same criticisms could be aimed at 'Barry Lyndon', a film I have come to love deeply on repeated viewings. Like that film, I suspect I'll see much more next time I watch it. The telling thing is I find myself anxious to re-see it, in spite of it's challenges.",1297123200,3,1265,4.901869158878505

1423489,5,B00005BHW6,"With all the comments about this movie I thought it would be difficult and convoluted, but instead I found it to be a fascinating and enjoyable film about a group of rich people and what they do when one of their own, Anna, disappears on an island.  Mainly they wander about for a while and then go off to do other things, aside from Claudia, Anna's friend, and Sandro, Anna's boyfriend.  Claudia is the only one who seems really concerned about Anna, indeed, the only one who seems like someone I would want to know. Interestingly, she's the only one who grew up without being rich, which is clearly part of the point of the movie. She and Sandro get together soon after Anna's disappearance, although I have to wonder if something happened even before the disappearance - it would explain why Claudia is so stricken, perhaps even why Anna leaves.  However, that's not a key point.

Yes, it is about ennui, but that doesn't make it boring.  The fantastic clothes and beautiful shots, plus the over the top behavior of the characters kept me constantly interested. The scenes of Claudia surrounded by men watching her are full of eerie menace, and the part with her and Sandro on the bell tower shows a kind of frantic business to keep bad thoughts at bay.  Anna's gone missing, but most of the other characters seem to be missing a sense of direction and self, even if they are still around.",1294790400,4,1392,4.570281124497992
1423490,5,B00005BHW6,"In 1962, Michelangelo Antonioni (who has earned the nickname ""the Master of Alienation"") released the first film of his alienation trilogy titled L'Avventura.

The Italian modernist director was known for his radical new style, not following any convention of filmmaking and most of all, characters and events are disconnected.  The cinematography of his films were not only stunning but also artistic and also symbolic.  One can watch his films and literally come up with their own interpretation of a scene and how they relate to the state of mind of a character.

""L'avventura"" (1960) was an international success and would introduce the world to the actress Monica Vitti, Antonioni's muse who would appear as the main character in several of his films.

And when it comes to Antonioni films, especially the films starring Monica Vitti, many try to watch these films and try to see how architecture, objects and symbolism have their part in the actual film.  While those who understand Antonioni's films feel a connection and a deep meaning within his films, others may find his films infuriating because his films do not follow the traditional sense of storytelling.

VIDEO:

""L'Avventura - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #98' is presented in 1:77:1 black and white and the print for this film is absolutely gorgeous.  Granted, this is an older 2001 DVD release, so this is one title that I hope to see the Criterion Collection giving an HD treatment.

Just the visual imagery captured by Aldo Scarvada is beautiful and for those who are familiar with Antonioni's films, visual imagery is very important as various backgrounds and objects have a symbolic meaning.  Blacks are nice and deep and there is a good amount of detail that can be seen.  With that being said, as this is an older DVD release, combing can be seen at times, as well as some blurriness.  But for the most part, ""L'Avventura"" is a beautiful film that is deserving an HD release and hopefully Criterion considers it for Blu-ray treatment.

According to the Criterion Collection, ""L'Avventura"" was given a new digital transfer which was created from a 35mm composite fine-grain master positive on a high-definition Spirit Datacine. The MTI Digital Restoration System was utilized to remove thousands of instances of dirt and scratches.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""L'Avventura - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #98' is presented in Italian Dolby Digital monaural with English subtitles.  According to the Criterion Collection, the sound was mastered from a 35mm optical soundtrack.  Audio is very clear and noticed no hissing or any problematic audio issues.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""L'Avventura - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #98"" comes with the following special features:

DISC 1:

  * AUDIO COMMENTARY - Featuring an in-depth audio commentary by film critic Gene Youngblood.  Youngblood is very familiar with Antonioni's work and understands the symbolism.  Definitely one of the best Criterion Collection audio commentaries out there!

DISC 2:

  * Antonioni: Documents and Testimonials - The first documentary about Michelangelo Antonioni to receive his approval.  Produced in collaboration with the Film Board of Canada in 1966, director Gianfranco Mingozzi gives viewers the opportunity to observe the director on the set, listen to his close friends, colleagues and interpreters.
  * Jack Nicholson reads essays by Antonioni - Jack Nicholson worked with Michelangelo Antonioni on ""The Passenger"".  Nicholson talks about his work with Antonioni and reads various essays circulated to press and foreign distributors of ""L'Avventura"".  Featuring ""L'Avventura: A Moral Adventure"" (21:09), ""Reflections on the Film Actor"" (11:23) and ""Working with Antonioni"" (5:15).
  * Theatrical Trailer - (2:12) The original English theatrical trailer.
  * Restoration Demonstration - (3:31) A demonstration of the before and after look of ""L'Avventura"" through restoration and remastering.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""L'Avventura"" is a film that many Antonioni fans believe is one of his best.  And I have to agree, ""L'Avventura"" is indeed a true masterpiece but at the same time, it's a film that is not meant for those who are used to traditional film writing and those who are not used to watching scenery, trees, architecture and not looking at the symbolic meaning of those things that are in the background of the characters.

People want simplicity but Michelangelo Antonioni is not about simplicity.  It's about human communication, the lack of thereof.  It's about alienation, it's about the art of cinema.  Like a painting in which one can watch it and come up with a variety of interpretations, the same with an an Antonioni film, especially for his film ""L'Avventura"".

Yes, the story has a mystery of a woman missing under odd circumstance and although traditional cinema would try to focus on that mystery and add a layer of suspense, Antonioni is not Hitchcock and therefore one should not expect the obvious.  The missing and mysterious Anna may have seemed as if she was a priority at the beginning, but she was more or less a person that would feed the fire between the two characters Claudia and Sandro.

Sandro, a man who seems to find himself needing women not for the long term relationship but more for a sense of comfort and sexual needs.  While Claudia, knows that if she pursues Sandro, she knows she is doing wrong and when she does, there is a guilt that she doesn't want Anna to be found or for her to turn up because she wants to be with Sandro.

And for most films you would watch for this and see how the characters progress and wonder if Anna will be found, but that is not the intent of the filmmaker.

The cinematography plays a big part in uncovering the human emotion.  In ""L'Avventura"" and ""L'Eclisse"", these are two films in which the viewer must take into account of what is shown on screen and what it has to do with the character.  The characters of Antonioni's trilogy are shallow individuals, people who do not know how to communicate with each other.

Anna doesn't communicate with her fiance, fiance doesn't communicate with his girlfriend, Anna doesn't communicate with Claudia and Claudia doesn't question the things that Anna does.  The only time we see communication is through sex.  These are things that we see common in Antonioni's trilogy.  Passiveness, lack of communication and emotional connection, only through sexual communication are these people striving for.  Eroticism, which Antonioni has said in an interview is the decline of society and something he felt he wanted to address through ""L'Avventura"".  He doesn't fix them, he shows them as is and you, as a viewer are left to interpret it, like a painting.

When you see a shot of Sandro and a big building in the background is shown.  That building that looks like a phallic building definitely has its importance in symbolism.  When you see trees rustling in the wind, if Claudia is not communicating, then you know that tree is representative of what is burning inside her.  Claudia is one who is capable of loving, yet she is caught up with a man who is incapable of it.

Film Critic Andrew Sarris wrote in his review of the film (from Village Voice, 1960), ""For Antonioni, there is no solution to the moral problem created by the failure of contemporary behavior to meet the hypocritical standards of ancient codes.""

There is no solution, there is no closure.  It is what it is.

Sarris pointed out that ""Antonioni is demonstrating the inadequacy of sexual encounters as a means of moral communication.  The erotic disease subordinates the person to the process, and one's specific identity is lost"".

Film critic Pauline Kael's interpretation of the film was also quite interesting.  Kael wrote (in her 1961 review), ""`L'Avventura' is a study of the human condition at the higher social and economic levels, a study of adjusted, compromising man - afflicted by short memory, thin remorse, easy betrayal.  The characters are passive as if post-analytic, active only in trying to discharge their anxiety - sex is their sole means of contact and communication"".

Kael goes on to write, ""Antonioni's space is a kind of vacuum in which people are aimlessly moving - searchers and lost are all the same, disparate, without goals or joy.""

And I agree with both critics.  There are no goals, there is no joy.  It is what it is and how you interpret it.

As for The Criterion Collection release of ""L'Avventura"", this is a solid DVD release.  And is one of those releases that should be in their queue for Blu-ray consideration.  Granted, I would still love to see Antonioni's ""Blow Up"" or the second film the trilogy ""La Notte"" released as well, there is no denying that this is a beautifully shot film and a film that is so Antonioni that you can't help but watch it again and again and see what else you were able to pick up through the various images shown onscreen.  The film is an indeed a visual delight but with that being said, it's not a film mean for everyone.

The commentary by Gene Youngblood is one of the best commentaries on a Criterion Collection release and he goes into detail of his interpretation of various symbolic meanings of a variety of scenes and found his commentary to be in-depth, fascinating and well-presented.

And of course, you get a few special features especially Jack Nicholson talking about working with Antonioni and then a documentary of Antonioni up-front and personal and also interviews with childhood friends, talents and more.  Just a wonderful inclusion on this DVD.

Overall, I have enjoyed ""L'Avventura"" for a long time now.  It's one of those films that continues to challenge me because I always come up with a different interpretation of the symbolic nature of the film and yet, I find myself just amazed of what the filmmaker and his crew were able to get on film and yet challenging and catching the attention of the viewer through cinematography.  And it was done successfully.

Although a film more for the cineaste, if anyone is willing to discover the oeuvre of Michelangelo Antonioni, ""L'Avventura"" is simply a must-watch film and also a must-own film.

Highly recommended!",1285286400,3,10174,5.00059488399762
1423491,5,B00005BHW6,"The first in a trilogy of films about couples in a crisis, L'Avventura takes place in an Italy enjoying an economic boom. The couple in L'Avventura is made up of Monica Vitti and Gabrielle Ferzetti. Sandro (Ferzetti) is an architect ,an intellectual, as in all three films, with the story of the same couple almost. An event, the loss of Sandro's mistress(Anna),while out on islands of Aeolia,north of Sicily, precedes the coming together of Claudia (Vitti) and Sandro as new lovers. The sense of alienation and existentialist absurdity are captured by the framing of the scenes and the sense of drawn out time, and the way black and white contrasts play out over a range of greys. Feelings of love that have been around for thousands of years do not find easy accommodation in a consumerist world. The ancient vase that is found becomes broken, old fine buildings are made into a police station. All the characters look a bit lost, with the loss of middle class values. People do not relate easily to each other nor live their love affairs. Beyond the narrative, the framing captures the visual poetry of loss, the way empty spaces emerge through his compositions, the way he places actors in disharmony with their environments. His camera probes the trace of the loss on the couple's actions, within an in-between space,where things, people, close to emptiness, are about to change or events are about to turn, in this void or absence. Moving from frame to frame brings out a sense of uneasy vigilance and instability in the audience, viewing a world where feelings are adrift, where something(not nothing) is always happening on screen. His major innovation is a way of looking at things in the world. He explores states of feeling and breakdowns in communication, emptiness, alertness, vacancy,heightened awareness of others and oneself. We see bodies moving in space and a perception of the world no longer determined by a narrative framework. The thing filmed is the initial situation of loss and the echo of that loss. All Antonioni is filming(and why his films are hard to define) is what comes afterwards,the trace that's left behind. Truly a masterwork Seeing the world with new meaning.",1272326400,3,2197,4.940540540540541
1423492,5,B00005BHW6,"""L'Avventura""(1960) was directed by Michelangelo Antonioni. The story surrounds the disappearance of Anna(Lea Massari) on an island off the coast of Sicily. As the movie develops, and the search for Anna widens to the mainland, her lover, Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), and Anna's friend, Claudia (Monica Vitti) begin to become romantically involved. The central mystery of Anna's disappearance is allowed to drift away as Sandro's and Claudia's relationship slowly becomes the focus of the movie. And even though Anna is not presumed to be dead she becomes little more than a figment of Sandro and Claudia's imagination. This is a film about people who have so little connection (moral or otherwise) to those beyond themselves that they seem to float in and out of people's lives. Claudia attempts to fight this tendency, and puts up something of a struggle to avoid Sandro's approaches, but eventually she gives in. When Claudia fully accepts Sandro's advances it seems to awaken her to life, but this is fleeting and tenuous. When Claudia asks Sandro if he loves her he doesn't say he does even though he has asked her to marry him. His infatuation with her seems superficial, and spurious. And it is around this time that Claudia seems to withdraw from Sandro, and their relationship shows signs of unwinding. This is a world where people are portrayed as floating aimlessly in life. They lack goals and vision. These wealthy people are bored and spoiled characters who don't seem to have the desire, or ability to develop fulfilling relationships because they lack any goals or vision. They are all people who are on the brink of disappearance themselves, just like Anna, and they too will soon be forgotten. This state of being is complimented by the film's style which lacks any real structure or drama as the movie drifts along following these two lovers towards a kind of malaise where they meet head on their emptiness, and despair.

This particular collection has a remastered version of the film with audio commentary by film historian Gene Youngblood as well as a 58 minute documentary by Gianfranco Mingozzi produced by the Canadian Film Board, and various writings by Antonioni read by Jack Nicholson along with personal reflections, and a restoration demonstration. There is also a reprint of Antonioni's statements about L'Avventura, and a new essay by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith.",1266451200,5,2389,5.094387755102041
1423493,5,B00005BHW6,"This film challenges people because it challenges all preconceptions about narrative storytelling. It dispenses with any of the usual motivations that drive characters and their stories and, in the process, achieves an even greater sort of truth, as how many of us go through life living out a plot of some kind? What story there is in L'Avventura is built around a McGuffin (a lady vanishes), but the film is really just playing with our sense of space and perspective, building our awareness of what is going on in ways that are contrary to conventional narratives. Antonioni feeds us what we need to know, but in an elliptical way, and what we need to know is how human relationships are as random and impossible as neat storylines. The ultimate story is of a man's utter weakness, his compulsion for companionship married to an utter inability to commit. But, what is novel is that the story is told from the perspective of the woman, not the man. And what a woman!

1423494,4,B00005BHW6,"""The Adventure"" is a sibling of another Italian masterpiece shot in 1960, Federico Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" - if you have seen that one, don't miss this. The theme is similar; mostly unsatisfying life of the rich drifting from one pleasure to another at all cost. At about half-point in run time, ""Avventura"" gently and for a viewer almost unwittingly shifts from being a kind of mystery (search for a missing young woman) to a deep psychological study of Claudia (Monica Vitti in a breakthrough performance at one level with any work of her more famous compatriots, Sofia Loren and Anna Magnani), who finds herself in a romance with a man who once dated the missing girl. The characters' motivations are completely understandable, realistic and deep at the same time. Even a contrast between the rich and the poorer people occurs once or twice (indicating that money is no sure way to happiness) and the quietly powerful ending just indicates the strong confines the vain lifestyle is exerting on those indulging in it. The film is deliberately paced, but very rewarding and if you found ""Blow Up"" too artsy, ""L'Avventura"" may just be your cup of tea.",1233705600,6,1153,4.8578680203045685

1423507,3,B00005BHW6,"Some films that are labeled classics, or great films, are not even good films. Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless immediately comes to mind. Others, like Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura, whose title literally means The Adventure, as well as Italian slang for a one night stand, are not necessarily bad, but still only interesting failures, and not worthy of their reputation. L'Avventura was the first in a trilogy of black and white widescreen films Antonioni would make about alienation and personal anomy. The making of such trilogies was the rage at the time in European cinema, and, to an extent, still is. The trilogy was rounded out by La Notte and L'Eclisse in the two following years. When L'Avventura was released in 1960, it was greeted with catcalls at its world premiere, but won a Special Jury Prize at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival, and film critics championed it around the world. A few years later, one poll of critics listed it as the third greatest film of all time, after Citizen Kane and Battleship Potemkin. It now comes nowhere near Top Twenty lists. Both L'Avventura and Breathless were part of a claimed European revolution in film, where symbolism came to its apogee, and also included Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries, Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita and 8, and the rest of the French New Wave. The reality of the film lies somewhere between the extremes. L'Avventura is a film that attempts much, but, after its interesting first third, it totally unravels with bad characterization, and narrative anomy, which is the fault of its three screenwriters, Antonioni, Elio Bartolini, and Tonino Guerra.
  It follows a group of rich hedonists who are frolicking in the Mediterranean, off of Sicily, in the Aeolian Sea. The three main characters are Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), a playboy architect, his frigid and scheming fiance Anna (Lea Massari), and Anna's best friend Claudia (Monica Vitti), the archetypal gorgeous brunet and gorgeous blond. They sail to a deserted island, Lisca Bianca, and during the course of their adventure, Anna simply disappears. Before she does, we have seen that she does not love Sandro, is passive-aggressive towards Claudia, and generally disdainful of her life and all others in it. She solicits sex to fill her inner emptiness, and gets her jollies by playing her friends with false claims of a shark in the waters. Before the other characters realize Anna has disappeared, we see a small boast speed away from the island.... L'Avventura, despite its reputation for being innovative, fails for the exact same reasons that most less supposedly innovative films do- it has cardboard characters, does not follow through on an intriguing premise, throws in an unneeded romance that never convinces a viewer of its participants' sparks, goes on far too long, and is far too pretentious. On a more mundane level, I wish some of the money spent on the restoration could have been used to hire competent actors to dub the film into English. No DVD of quality should lack this feature. Film is a visual medium, and for a film which is supposedly so visual, this should be a must. If only this film's fans and apologists would actually take only what is seen onscreen, and not imbue the film with what they think is there, or feel was intended, then a more just and objective evaluation of this film as an interesting, but ultimately failed, attempt at something different, could be agreed upon.
  In short, in art, intent is meaningless, because if not, we'd have to believe that very recognition of Antonioni's intent to bore the viewer somehow obviates the natural reaction of boredom, and thus all dull films could claim that boredom was their actual intent, thus leaving them not open to criticism on those grounds. Fortunately, intent is meaningless, and in that way one can say that L'Avventura misses the mark as a work of art, and is nowhere near as good as its vast reputation. Whether or not it's an actually bad film may depend only upon how much you value style over content, or gorgeous Italian babes in bathing suits. There are worse things to have to ponder, eh?",1221350400,11,4149,4.939828080229226
1423508,5,B00005BHW6,"From the scenes of the sea and island at the beginning of the film to the portrayal of Claudia throughout it, the film is a visual masterpiece. Some of the scenes in this film are so breathtakingly beautiful - it's worth it to see this work of art for this reason alone. However, there are other reasons to fall in love with it.

The story begins with a group of wealthy young Italians out for a day cruise on the Mediterranean. They decide to explore an island. Anna, a girl from the group, goes missing on the island, and her devoted best friend, Claudia (the film's protagonist), begins the search for her (which lasts for the rest of the film). Rife with symbolism, that the plot follows Claudia's search for Anna, or ""adventure,"" first on the island and then elsewhere in Italy, serves to underscore the film's main motif - that of self-discovery.

1423509,5,B00005BHW6,"Like many of the best things in life, I came into the ownership of this film by accident.  I was collecting the noir titles of the Criterion Collection and this film was categorized in that genre.  This is not a noir film in any dimension.

I sat down and was spellbound from beginning to end.  First, the cinematography was visually stunning, the lush black and white imagery set the tone of story contrasts.  You immediately get the sense that something much more than talking heads spouting dialogue is going on.  Frankly much of the dialogue is incidental to the film.  Slowly, I began to grasp the grammar of the film, the contrasts between old and new, between substance and illusion and was drawn in.  You quickly determine that something much more than a mysterious disappearance is going on.  Ringing true, a character is there, and then she is not, with little or no explanation.

The theme is the transitory, opportunistic and shallow nature of ""modern relationships.""  The principle characters set out on a quest that ends in a stunning conclusion.  Film critic Joel Youngblood (passionate devote' of this film) provides a perfect narration of the film that should be viewed after you run through it first with just subtitles.  You will be amazed with the detail and what is going on in this film as he leads you through it.

The director, Michelangelo Antonioni created a trilogy of sorts of this special type of film.  My personal favorite of the three and the one I highly recommend L'Eclisse is also available in a richly narrated Criterion Collection version with a stupendous quality transfer.  Monica Vitti is the lead actress in L'Eclisse also.

La Aventura is a compelling film that tends to draw you into repeat viewings.  It is rich with visual nuance and camera shots that tell the story, instead of the actor's words.  The film is revealed in the imagery more than through the dialogue.  The lead actor Gabriele Ferzetti and the beautiful actress Monica Vitti sweep you away into their adventure journey.  The ending is at once is impossible but probable.  Wow!  This is a CD to own, treasure and watch too many times.

1423512,4,B00005BHW6,"L'AVVENTURA was director Michaelangelo Antonioni's first international hit, winning the Special Jury Prize at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival. Here a small group of rich Italian socialites takes a boat out to a volcanic island. Anna (Lea Massari) quarrels with her fiance Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), and subsequently goes missing. The police are brought in and divers scour the waters, but Anna never turns up. One would expect the film to develop as a whodunit, either revealing Anna to still be alive or putting the finger on the person responsible for her disappearance.

Instead, Anna never shows up, and the film goes off in a rather different direction. Anna's friend Claudia (Monica Vitti) is suddenly promoted from a background character to the very centre of the picture, with her interaction with Sandro driving the action. While the film lacks a traditional plot, and indoor scenes tend to be brief arguments between lovers, the main part of the film is held together with a series of long shots of landscapes. Appreciating Antonioni's style requires some work, but as in the lengthy late works of composers Morton Feldman or Toru Takemitsu, eventually the rewards come. The scenes of the ocean while the party is on the volcanic island are beautifully constructed and will have stayed with me after the film ends. Furthermore, becoming comfortable with L'AVVENTURA makes one all the more ready for Antonioni's later films, which further develop this theme of human beings unable to connect with each other or the changing world around them.

Antonioni's casting of Monica Vitti was brilliant, for in a film that requires the female protagonist to stand as a witness to everything going on around her, Vitti's statuesque beauty is just the ticket. Esmeralda Ruspoli plays a ditzy young lady well, adding a touch of humour to what otherwise would have been a deathly serious film. And though the plot is untraditional, and the existential themes take a backseat to the composition, I'd say there is some closure, with Sandro's inner self stripped naked by the end.

One further aspect of the film that I've only recently come to appreciate is its sort of exploration of Southern Italian culture. Antonioni was from Emilia-Romagna in the north of Italy, and his wealthy characters in the film come from Rome. The setting highlights the substantial divisions that exist within a supposedly unified country, as the south is significantly less prosperous, its people are of shorter stature, and of course Monica Vitti gets a lot of staring and wolf-whistles due to the south's culture of machismo. If you speak Italian, you can see how Antonioni uses the substantial difference between Italian dialect as another instance of people failing to communicate with each other.",1195948800,3,2775,5.107929515418502
1423513,2,B00005BHW6,"I love most of Criterion's releases and rate their release of ""Children of Paradise"" as the best thus far. That said, this is one film in their collection that I find hugely overrated and pretentious. I am usually a fan of Antonioni but he lost me here. I remember the first time I saw it, I couldn't finish it. When I saw it again yesterday on the Criterion DVD, the best thing I could say about it was 'Well, at least the transfers good'.

It is fatiguing that any old black and white movie released by Criterion is proclaimed a masterpiece by cinephiles simply because its released by Criterion. I do not get it. Any way you cut it, this is one lazy shot after another in this movie, as if the director knew that there was no plot so he decided to amuse himself with l-o-n-g shots of the harbor, the islands, and even lazier shots of the lead actress walking up and down hallways, taking a stroll down a road, ambling through bushes. Should be seen to be believed. I am all for this sort of languid pacing (it worked on ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"", if you remember), but here it gives you the impression that you're wasting your time.

Investing in artistic works from the past is a tricky thing. If you criticize anything by Carne, Fellini, Melville, you are considered lowbrow and uneducated. However, it is hugely possible that many of these directors did churn out substandard films, and this movie is a clear example. The 'climax', if you could call it that, was the icing on a very rotten cake. I did not buy these characters for one minute, did not empathize or feel their pain, and through it all I felt that the lead actress was on some serious medication. There is no other way to describe her loopy, inane performance where she whines and cringes her way through almost three hours of nothingness. If this sort of thing is your bag, I'm glad for you. It wasn't mine.

I would recommend ""Nights of Cabiria"" and ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" over this convoluted mess if you ARE looking to buy a new Criterion DVD.

Two Stars. A very disappointing movie.",1191110400,10,2059,4.453580901856764
1423514,4,B00005BHW6,"What a week it has been for the world of cinema! In one day we lost two of the world's greatest filmmakers; Ingmar Bergman and Michelangelo Antonioni. There is something oddly fitting about that since both men made a career focusing on films in which characters felt isolated from the world. Bergman I would agrue invoked religion a bit more in his films, while Antonioni's films were more social commentaries. More modern in a sense. Bergman's films were poetry, Antonioni's had a more ""every day"" feel to them.

 Antonioni is prbably best known to American audiences for his film ""Blow-Up"" (1967) which was nominated for Oscars and is seen as the inspiration for Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Conversation"".

 It has often been said if you were asked to describe an Antonioni film, you wouldn't be able to. There is some truth to that, but it is not a criticism. His films were more about emotion. They created a certain mood. Yes, there have been those you argue his films are boring. No plot. They go on way too long. Heaven knows I've been in heated debates discussing Antonioni.

 Of all his films I think ""L' Avventura"" may have been the best film to get his theme of alienation across. The film at first seems to be about a couple; Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti) and Anna (Lea Massari). They are about to get married but she doesn't want to. She has become bored with her life. The two, along with some friends, including Claudia (Monica Vitti), take a boat trip togther. They make a stop on remote island and while on that island Anna disappears.

 At this point in the film one would assume it is going to turn into some action film, the title after all, when translated into English means ""The Adventure"", but no, Antonioni pulls the rug from underneath us as soon the entire rescue theme is abandoned as Sandro and Claudia spark a romance while looking for Anna.

 One of the questions I always liked to asked when I watch this film is, what happened to Anna. Some may think she was kidnapped. Others, perhaps drowned. I think she ran away knowing that Sandro would not seek to find her. Their love was dying, if it hadn't already.

 Every character in ""L' Avventura"" is aimless. They have no direction. Just like their boat trip, which never at one point do we hear a character call out a destination, these characters are like the sea. They float along in society. They are literally drifters.

 But not everyone liked 'L' Avventura"" when it was first released. Stories are now legendary about the response it received at the Cannes Film Festival, it was meet with ""boos"". Some audiences members walked out. Despite everything it won the award for ""Jury Prize"" but lost the Gold Palm to Federico Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"". Some have even argued ""L' Avventura"" and ""La Dolce Vita"" are the flip side of each other. Both films revolve around characters seeking the ""sweet life"".

 Late in Antonioni's life he suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed. He was unable to speak and because of his declining health, producers would not want to work with him. In 1995 Wim Wenders co-directed one of Antonioni's masterpieces ""Beyond the Cloud"". Sadly, his last film to be seen in theaters, was part of a trilogy on erotica entitled ""Eros"". His segment, ""The Dangerous Thread of Things"" was unfairly criticized. Roger Ebert went as far as to call it ""an embarrassment"".

 Though now with his passing I suppose some may want to go back and look at and re-examine his films. If you do chose to do so, I recommend starting with this film. If you are still hungry for more, this movie was the first part of a trilogy on alienation followed by ""La Notte"" (my personal favorite) and ""L'Eclisse"". Afterwards watch ""The Passenger"" and ""Red Desert"".

 Bottom-line: One of the great Antonioni films and the one I think best gets his theme of alienation across. Antonioni will be greatly missed.",1185926400,4,3893,4.697058823529412
1423515,5,B00005BHW6,"Michelangelo Antonioni throws one love off a cliff (literally), but not before showing us its depth, and then walks us through the formation of another. I am reminded of Nabakov's Lolita in how we are led to empathize with what we would condemn if presented less obliquely and artfully.

This film does nothing less than expose the shallowness and flimsiness of our humanity -- how quickly ""friendship,"" ""love,"" and ""fidelity"" melt away when tested! Such mammals we are!

Be careful or you'll hate yourself for loving this film, as I do.",1181347200,4,537,4.8901098901098905
1423516,5,B00005BHW6,"Filmgoers seem to either love L'Avventura or hate it.  This picture is difficult.  Michelangelo Antonioni challenges us.  We are forced to work, to have patience, and, most difficult of all, to accept uncertainty.  He does not provide us with a groovy soundtrack to compensate for cinematic deficiencies or satisfy the modern movie audience's expectations of full sensory overload.  L'Avventura is meant to be watched, really watched.  And, in fact, Gene Youngblood, the film critic who supplies the commentary, refers to the protagonist, Claudia, as ""the witness.""  As the viewers we then witness Claudia witnessing the world around her.  She is also the only character in the film who sees anything outside of herself, be it art, architecture, landscape, or the fact that her friend, Anna, goes missing on a yachting cruise off the coast of Lisca Bianca, one of the Aeolian islands.  She is the only one who cries over the incident.  From the second we learn of Anna's disappearance, the plot of L'Avventura seems to be established.  With the exception of Claudia, the other crew members make half-hearted attempts to find Anna, but it is obvious they have better things to do because they are rich and have places to go and people to see.  It is this indifference that throws the viewer off course, and as the film unfolds we learn that L'Avventura is about something else entirely. Actually the film is about many things, which won't be revealed here.

Michelangelo Antonioni is a Zen-like director in that he depicts life as it is with all its contradictions, simple yet complex, soothing and disturbing, an adventure and a bore, beautiful but lonely.  He does not spare us.  Even though L'Avventura focuses on a group of wealthy so-called friends, the human condition is the human condition regardless of how much money one has.  The major difference, and what Antonioni might be trying to convey, is that those with money can buy diversions, a yacht, an Alfa Romeo, a villa.  And since these same people do not work they are forced to buy time.  Casual sex buys time, as well as endless parties and fancy dinners.  The point is that the more distractions one has the easier it is to bury the inevitable pain of loss, betrayal, fear, loneliness, to name but a few, that are a part of life.  However, the pain is still there for these people and maybe even more intensely, given the fact that all they have is a lot of toys but no genuine relationships, passion or meaning in their lives.

Gene Youngblood, mentioned earlier, is wonderful as the commentator.  He is enlightening and unpretentious.  He admits to having seen L'Avventura twelve times in 1961, so he knows his subject.  And his love for this film is contagious.  For those who have had or are having trouble with the picture, it is recommended to try watching again with the commentary.

The second disc contains testimonials from people who have known Antonioni and/or worked with him, so the viewer can gain further insight into the director's ideas, what he tried to say through his captivating images, and simply learn more about the man himself.  There is also a brief segment on the restoration of the film, which is interesting even for technophobes like myself.  Thankfully there are people with the skill and patience to take on this arduous process.  How sad it would be to lose such an innovative and exquisite film.  Buy this gem as soon as possible.",1179964800,9,3431,4.835334476843911
1423527,1,B00005BHW6,"After reading all of the reviews, I was so excited to view a great film.  However, after about an hour of waiting for something plausible to happen, it just drifted . . . and drifted . . . and meandered . . . and, oh here's a scene:  she says ""No"" to the main character advances, and he ignores her initial rejection . . . and then it meanders more into something so absurd that I started to laugh.

C'mon, people!  To all of you 4- and 5-star people, just because a film involves beautiful settings and artsy characters, that does NOT constitute a story!!

I'm sorry, maybe it's me, but message to the character Claudia in the movie:  If some cad starts coming onto you while he's simultaneously searching for his fiancee (and your friend) who may very well have drowned, then get a 1000 miles away from this scum . . . and to all viewers watching this exercise in self-indulgence and boredom, get a 1000 miles away from this farce of a film.

I am an enormous fan of stylish, artistic films, but just like those paintings at fancy museums that are being portrayed as elite art but instead are just simple circles and triangles on a blank canvas, this film is NOT art.  It's just boring, boring, boring, uninteresting.  I could not care about these characters any less, other than poor Anna who disappeared from that island . . . . actually, now that I think about it, Anna was the only smart one there!  She jumped off that island as quickly as she could so as get out of this ostentatious, boring, pompous, self-indulgent, uneventful, dreadful, meandering, dumb film!

Way to go, Anna!  You're the only one with any sense.  Even if you did drown, trust me, that is a better fate than having to survive this DULL film.

So, in case you didn't get my point, let me spell it out once again:  I HATED this film so completely!  I would rather watch water trickling from my sink.  At least that has a story!!

Aaaargh -- I want my 2 hours back!  I gave up 2 precious hours of my life to watch this pathetic film.",1176854400,21,2009,4.352150537634409
1423528,5,B00005BHW6,"I used to hate Antonioni's films when I was in college.  The teachers at my school used to rave about him (mostly about the film Blow Up), so I rebelled.  I loved practically every other Italian filmmaker I could get my hands on, except poor Michelangelo.  Having been out of college for a bit, I have shaken off the hatred of Michelangelo, and I really admire the hell out of his work.  This film really resonates better as I grow older.  Of course, we're told we should see something like this.  It's an ""important"" film.  It's a ""historic"" one.  But when you actually see it, it lives up to those words, and it goes beyond them.  The plot is rather simple.  Several wealthy people go on a yachting trip, and one of the women, Anna, disappears.  Her best friend, Claudia (played by the startling Monica Vitti), and Sandro, her fiance (played by Gabrielle Ferzetti), set out to look for her.  But while Anna is gone, he fills his sex life by dating Claudia.  Claudia is initially repulsed by the idea, but then ends up dating him anyway.  This is an incisive, brilliant, sad, and haunting take on the upper classes' hedonistic lifestyle.  The protagonists here just go from one hedonistic pleasure to another, without any sense of self, personal morality, or dignity.  It reminds me of the women from Sex and the City, except Antonioni is much more artful and truthful about what these people are really like.  Sex and the City showed its protagonists as basically nice people just looking for love, not the sad, lonely women they would be in real life.  The honesty and integrity of Antonioni's film startled many when it came out.  It was mercilessly booed at Cannes, but eventually was recognized as the classic that it is.  This is a great piece of cinema.  It shows Antonioni's extraordinary visual style.  You can probably watch it with the sound off, and still be aware of what is transpiring.  This film is still startling today.  It fascinates as well as infuriates.  The pace is very slow, the missing girl eventually is forgotten about (because the rich people really don't care about her, they can always find someone else to hang out with), and it doesn't have any real closure.  The film just ends, which angers many who see the film.  A masterwork.",1168214400,6,2264,4.651515151515151
1423529,4,B00005BHW6,"The circular story, the emphasis on isolation and futility, and the symbolic use of Sicilian landscape returned with greater strength in ""L'Avventura,"" the first film in a free trilogy (""La Notte"" and ""L'Eclisse"" followed) about restless, disillusioned unhappy women and sensitive, unreliable, soft men...

Some way into the movie and without a careful explanation, a central affluent character disappears without a trace from a yachting trip... Few of the group of socialites--wealthy, elegant, bored--come in sight bothered by what has occurred, and while the girl's neglectful sweetheart and her best friend (Monica Vitti) pair off in a search around a remote, uninhabited island, they embark on a spontaneous exciting intimacy...

The story is simple, but the greatness of the film, however, is in two parts... First, it analyzes the psychology of the two main characters in keen and penetrating yet doubtful tones... Second, unconcerned with the reasons for the girl's unexpected disappearance, Antonioni instead concentrates on the moral discomfort that drives forward their closest knowledge to betray her memory...",1166313600,4,1122,5.633136094674557
1423530,4,B00005BHW6,"If you've heard of L'Avventura than you've probably heard people say that this film is about nothing. This is true...Nothing happens in this movie. Two movies kept popping into my head during my viewing of L'Avventura and they were ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" and ""The Passenger."" The latter was directed by this films writer/director Michelangelo Antonioni. Picnic at Hanging Rock and L'Avventura have a similar event take place with a similar outcome. The Passenger and L'Avventura share the same sluggish pace that will turn a lot of audiences off. I think, overall, L'Avventura is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. It's got gorgeous cinematography and wonderful art direction; If you're willing to set aside what happens in the movie and let yourself get lost not in what's happening but what's portrayed, you'll find this film a lot more likeable. I, myself, don't love it. I think it's an overrated film (it's in Roger Ebert's The Great Movies), but despite that...It still weaves a spell on the viewer, if you're watching it. Oddly enough, for a movie in which almost nothing occurs, it's almost 2 1/2 hours long. It's running time is about 2:20. The movie is about a group of rich friends; Anna (Lea Massari) and her lover Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), Anna's friend Claudia (Monica Vitti) and some others. When they reach a small island, Anna and Sandro have a little quarrel and soon Anna has disappeared. Like Picnic at Hanging Rock, we will never see her again or find out what happened to her. This film offers up a lot more theories than that film did but, when Anna is gone, Anna is gone. Antonioni teases us a bit by letting us (almost) see a boat, leaving us to wonder if Anna left on it. Anyway, the group looks for Anna and calls the coast guard...Eventually, they give up and return to shore. The rest of the film is (more or less) built on the foundation of the characters trying to find Anna, but the film is not a search for Anna at all. Antonioni makes it very clear in the beginning of the film that Anna is gone forever. The plot, if one can call it that, has Claudia and Sandro becoming lovers. They don't fall in love, love seems to be nonexistent in this movie...I won't say much more than that. Truth is, there's not much more to say. The final scene of the film is, in my opinion, simultaneously the most beautiful and haunting shot of the entire film. To be honest, this is a movie I'll probably have to see again. I think most people will find that this film doesn't connect with the immediately (and may never do so). I actually liked it, which gives me hope for future viewings that I may come to appreciate what everyone else saw. As for now, the casual commercial-film viewer will not like this movie. That I can damn near guarantee. People who like film, The Criterion Collection, or Antonioni will. If you don't fall into either of these categories, you might want to check it out and see what you think of it. I've said all I can.

1423532,5,B00005BHW6,"L'Avventura was directed in 1960 by what many would regard now as one of the truly great directors of all time, Michelangelo Antonioni. `L'Avventura' is now regarded as being the first part in a quadrilogy of films followed by `La Notte' (1961), E'clisse (1962) and `Red Desert' (1964) all dealing with the themes of modern alienation and the human condition. The feature that sets `L'Avventura apart from the other three films though is that `L'Avventura still has a strong masculine, if immature and spiritually impotent, character. Later films would concentrate on the female character to a far greater extant.

L'Avventura is essentially a road movie with an objective that is not important to the film, so I won't say anything about that. What is important is that Antonioni is writing a whole new cinematic language in his use of camera angle and position within a scene, actors being filmed from behind and characters entering a scene from what would appear to be the wrong direction. The scenes and composition on the island are perhaps some of the best I've ever watched. Antonioni also uses architecture as a metaphor in many scenes and would be explored to a greater extent in his next two films `La Notte' and `E'clisse'. Saying that though, there are some Hitchcockian clichs in `L'Avventura' such as the train entering the tunnel as a metaphor for intercourse. It can sometimes be difficult for a younger audience to understand why `L'Avventura' is so important because so many of these ideas seem familiar to us now, but nothing was made like this before it. The audio commentary on this disc by film historian Gene Youngblood is an invaluable tool to a greater understanding of this films position and status in cinema history and is highly recommended. The transfer is superb and presented in 1.77:1 and enhanced for 16x 9 televisions.

L'Avventura starred Monica Vitti (E'clisse, 1962; Red Desert,1964), Gabriele Ferzetti (Once Upon A Time In The West, 1969) and Lea Massari (Mummur Of The Heart, 1971). Other similar films I would recommend are `La Dolce Vita' (Federico Felini, 1960); `Picnic At Hanging Rock' (Peter Weir, 1975) and `Paris, Texas' (Wim Wenders, 1984). `L'Avventura won the Special Jury Prize at Canne in 1960 yet still feels like a fresh and modern film and gets better every time I see it. It's in my top 5 greatest films ever made without a doubt.

Highly Recommended.",1160870400,2,2407,4.952970297029703
1423533,5,B00005BHW6,"With Antonioni's The Passenger having recently been re-released on DVD, and just having bought a new player and LCD screen, I've gotten on an Antonioni binge, and let me say, first of all, that this print is spectacular.  It is a beautiful remastering job, and I've got to say that this alone made the experience of this picture very different from when I saw it in college years ago.  The images are just gorgeous.

As with the much later film, The Passenger, the guts of this film are not in the plot.  The plot (which is well-described in other reviews) is, frankly, presented in a slow, ambling, and sometimes almost aimless manner.  As with The Passenger, the narrative thread is often enough not clear, and more questions are raised than answered.

But, at least for this viewer, that causes the focus of attention to turn more to the visual content of the film, and the rhythm.  In that way, it weaves it's magic.  And a print of this quality really helps make that happen.  Sure, I agree with those that find the ending unsatisfying.  But so can be the real world.  And with a willing immersion in Antonioni's visual language, we have the opportunity to see another way to view the world, and, perhaps strangely (in the midst of all of this talk of alienation and emptiness), that way can be very beautiful, indeed.  Strongly recommended, but give it some patience.",1147824000,4,1373,4.651452282157677
1423534,5,B00005BHW6,"For the few reviewers that seem disappointed and perplexed by this movie and the ""unresolved"" ending, all I can say is ""I felt the same way when I first saw this masterpiece"". Advice: watch it with the commentary after you see the film and then wait a couple of weeks and watch it again, you will be blown away.

Synopsis: Rich girl travels with some friends on a yacht, they stop on an island, she disappears. One of her friends goes searching for her with the missing girls boyfriend.

You see that is the way a movie studio or viewer today might say that this film is about. Yet it isn't really. It is really the ""adventure"" or quest of a young woman (the rich girls friend) into full womanhood.

I remember watching this film one day and getting to the end and thinking ""I don't get it"". A whirlwind of questions came to mind, and then I thought I should watch it with the commentary, see if that would help. And it did.

The imagery is so well explained that you think how is it that you didn't see that. The way the director used nature to say so much about his characters. Examples: the island they all disembark on is as dry and lifeless as the lives they all live. The boyfriend always seems to be surrounded in the background by incredible architecture , yet he has sold out of his dream to build great things. The close-up of rich girl and boy-toy having sex, and you can tell she couldn't care less. The last scene where on the broken boy-toys side of the screen all you see is a blank wall, but on our heroines side there's a volcano.

I mean how can you go wrong with scenes like these? And those are just a few. But then again you have to go to this film with the mentality that it is not just a bunch of nonsense on screen like unfortunately we see too much of today. You are actually watching a work of art, and like all works of art different people will have different points of view.

So give it a chance and don't go thinking you will find easy answers to the questions it makes. Life is full of questions, and would it be real art if it didn't make you ponder these questions?",1141171200,7,2098,4.219451371571072

L'Avventura is all about relationships. The relationships between the main characters and also the territory they inhabit. Needless to say, topography plays an important role in this film and thus becomes an outside character in of itself.

When viewing for the first time, pay special attention to the deliberate pacing of the film. It's very bold and lyrical in its approach. Motion pictures aren't made like this anymore and you'll be pleasantly surprised that there is very little intrusion or manipulation by the director. Antonioni really lets this film breathe naturally; nothing is hurried or out of place.

This is really the perfect film.

1423549,5,B00005BHW6,"Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni proved that he could stand his own against the likes of Fellini with this startling 1960 film which may just require more than one viewing to fully appreciate it.

As summarized in earlier reviews, L'avventura (The Adventure), spins the tale of young rich socialites who go off on a yaught trip, only to lose one of their party on a rocky island. After a half-hearted search, the bored elitists resume their vacation, leading to a controversial relationship between the lost girl's boyfriend and her best friend.

The film is not intended to be a straight narrative, as there are many scenes that seem out of place, and in one scene involving a crowd of deviant men, out-of-movie. Its lack of convention and resolution may unnerve some audiences, which may trigger a violently angry reaction to the film (it was booed at Cannes for this same reason). Antonioni's commentary about the boring and immoral lives of the wealthy holds up today, as does the shockingly good camera work.

Seeing L'avventura only once is like getting half the movie for the price of renting a whole one. A second viewing is essential, as is the case with most of Antonioni's films, with La Notte being a possible exception. Many people compare this to other Italian films of the same era unfavorably, but, in my own humble opinion, this is pretty much as good as it gets. Even most of Fellini's work don't hold up as well as this film.",1123372800,4,1451,4.772908366533865
1423550,4,B00005BHW6,"Except for an ugly black line from top to bottom of the screen for about two minutes toward the end, this is an essentially perfect transfer of the controversial film that made Antonioni famous in 1960. Its disturbing premise is that a woman, Anna, disappears and her friends gradually get tired of looking for her and give up. She is never found. More disturbing yet, Anna's lover, Sandro, tries to seduce her close friend Claudia (Monica Vitti) within three days of Anna's disappearance. The remainder of this long film is devoted to episodes that befall Sandro and Claudia during their rocky romance, the last of which is Claudia discovering Sandro having sex with a prostitute and having to forgive him for the very infidelity and concupiscence which made him seduce Claudia herself.

The opening scenes on the rocky island are justly famous, and deep focus is used to wonderful effect. There are a couple of hilarious scenes in which Italian men are shown flocking to a beautiful woman like bees to a hive. I think L'Eclisse shows better than L'Avventura Antonioni's very original use of time in film, but all three films of the so-called ""trilogy of alienation"" are utterly new in their use of time and imagery, which made Antonioni an icon among modern filmmakers.

My personal criticism of this story concerns Claudia's motivation. The dialogue makes clear that Claudia is the only character truly concerned about Anna's fate, and also the only character with a genuine conscience and real intellectual curiosity. I find it unbelievable that Claudia (the way Monica Vitti plays her) would fall for an obviously shallow philanderer like Sandro. This doesn't ring true for me.

Antonioni and his collaborators could have written the character as more shallow, or used a different actress, but obviously he was determined to use the beautiful Monica Vitti, whose face expresses complex emotions and great depth. This, I think, makes Claudia's surrender to the banal Sandro unbelievable.

1423580,3,B00005BHW6,"This film is hailed as a masterpiece, and I agree the direction, cinematography, acting, and the concepts and ideas portrayed are very good, but the film moves at such a slow pace, for so long, it becomes quite boring. I found myself waiting anxiously just to arrive at the end of the film. The film compared to others, isn't actually that long, but because of the slow pace, it feels that way. I feel the story could have been changed to add some fresh material to quicken it up a little, but still keep the same issues on screen.
The film begins as Anna, her boyfriend Sandro, and her good friend Claudia go on a trip in a yacht with their friends. Anna is afraid to loose Sandro, but she wants time alone, as she cannot seem connect with him anymore. Soon Anna is found to be missing, and they all search for her, Sandro and Claudia spending more time with each other. Sandro falls in love with Claudia but she does not accept him. After a while, she does, and they forget all about Anna. The rest of the film shows their relationship, and how quickly and paradoxically our opinions and feelings can change.
The characters are empty, they feel nothing. All they trick themselves to believe they are feeling is just an illusion. They do not understand themselves, and as a result they do not understand their relationships. Their emptiness is well portrayed, as is their selfishness. The acting is well done, and directing is superb. When this film was released in 1960 it was very influential. There are no real happy moments in this film. There is some romance but it is all for the characters to gain for themselves, it is not true love. If these situations interest you, and you can stand extremely slow, and long films, you may want to check this out. But I feel this is too overrated. 3 stars.",1037404800,15,1801,4.4939024390243905
1423581,4,B00005BHW6,"The virtues of this film feel overstated. Notably, its alleged innovations seem more like evolutions or, not always successful, exaggerations of existing techniques. Also, its insights into human emotion seem less profound than its pretensions; and its beauty, while ultimately undeniable, has an artificial and less than celebratory quality.
*
the film renders its characters' inner worlds largely through objectification in the outer world - that is, not simply through the characters' actions, but through the choice of the natural and built environment that frames them, and through the very framing itself. This technique was not revolutionary, but when coupled with Antonioni's use of extended takes, and the audience's consequent confrontation with cinematic time where 'not much happens', and with his diminution of other traditional cinematic effects, such as music, the experience might stand as unprecedented. But is it effective? Can the background settings and the compositional arrangement of figures within the frame, alone, serve to unveil the inner emotional states of the characters with any perspicacity? While 'L'Avventura' makes a brave case, I think it ultimately falls short. One reason perhaps being its failure to acknowledge that dialogue, action, plot are still doing a tremendous amount of work in the film, work which it pretends is being shouldered by more 'subtle' elements.
*
The Criterion edition has an illuminating commentary by Gene Youngblood - he is a self-confessed advocate of Antonioni, and he sees innovation in the use of 'metonymy' rather than 'metaphor' - this distinction he draws as follows: a part of an object stands for the whole of the same object, rather than for an altogether different object or concept. Cryptically, he asserts this insulates metonymy from being taken as 'symbolism'. Is his case convincing? Characters pass through untold archways and doors and corridors in 'L'Avventura', and lovers even lie on a grassy foreground as a steaming locomotive rushes into a dark cutting - whatever the 'metonymical' force of such images, they also appear crudely symbolic (don't they?). The film does rely on symbolism, not always eloquently, and that it does helps to explain its 'abstract' quality.
*
The emotional world of the film is said to be that of ennui and alienation. Sandro, the male lead, is particularly vacuous - but we know this from standard narrative devices: in dialogue he tells of his avarice winning out over artistic ambitions; he neglects women, as per his month-long absence from Anna, and from his subsequent actions; his facial expressions are bereft of depth (so much so it's tempting to simply label Gabriele Ferzetti a poor actor, although it's more interesting to compare his function with that of Rock Hudson in Sirk's melodramas). The composition and framing help, sure, but his inner emptiness is obvious in any case. Monica Vitti's Claudia, likewise, demonstrates her inner confusion through her behaviour - the plot, while rudimentary, reveals her character all too traditionally - here is a woman whose best friend has either died or gone missing on account of an emotional crisis, and within days she succumbs to the sexual allure of her friend's erstwhile lover, a rich, handsome and shallow man. Gene Youngblood calls this 'romantic', but melodramatic might be more apposite. He goes on to say that Claudia and Sandro share in one of the cinema's greatest romances! This is misguided hyperbole. Neither Claudia, nor Sandro, possess the range of emotion or experience to viably function as an everywoman or everyman. They are grotesquely stunted human beings. To universalise from these (un)emotional lives is problematic. Any 'insights' gained are thus limited in scope, and less profound than they wish to be.
*
The choice of such shallow characters may provide difficulties for formal characterisation, plot, and for audience empathy, but it might also facilitate Antonioni's theoretical intentions - after all it is easier to render Sandro's limited palette of emotions through 'objectification', than it would be Hamlet's.
*
At one level the beauty of the cinematography and composition is undeniable. Yet even here I feel other directors outdo Antonioni - for example, Satyajit Ray, Bergman, Tarkovsky, Eisenstein, and Dreyer. I disliked the very limited range of grey that fill so many frames of earth and sky and sea - intentional, perhaps, but not altogether beautiful. At times I found myself wishing he'd filmed in colour, something I never wished for with the other directors cited. The composition too contained a kind of compromised beauty. At times it seemed too artificial and too repetitive, so that it was in danger of being formulaic. In contrast, Ray's wonderful compositions feel organic and less contrived.
*
In sum, it seems reasonable to agree with the film's detractors as well as with its champions. A flawed work of art, but an extremely interesting one.",1034899200,18,4974,5.281565656565657
1423582,5,B00005BHW6,"L'Avventura is many things. But it is first of all a work of near despair. Like Antonioni's other masterpieces of the period (Il Grido, La Notte), L'Avventura is about the impossibility of relationship and the imbreachable solitude of the individual. Just as importantly, it is an intensely visual movie: it is about what is seen, what it means to see, to search, to witness.
L'Avventura is not a hard film to watch. Some may find it slow. I did not, but that said, I wasn't crazy about it on first viewing. But I couldn't stop thinking about it and re-feeling the sensations created by the visual affect of the film. The second time I watched it, I fell in love. Then I watched it with the excellent commentary on this DVD. I've sinced watched it about eight times.
And then there's Monica Vitti. I mean everybody's great in this movie, but Monica Vitti is a revelation from God. It is no accident that she - who doesn't start out as, but becomes the film's central character - is also the designated witness to everything the film wants to show us. In other words, she witnesses it first, and we witness it through her eyes.
The DVD package is excellent. Criterion is really improving it's DVD offerings. Disc 2 is not all that. I mean I could have lived without it. But it's got a lot of material that some will no doubt find enormously interesting. What I loved is disc number 1: the transfer, the extraordinary commentary, the sound, it's all good.",1028505600,5,1453,4.549618320610687

There is a brilliant commentary soundtrack, which comes-in quite handy. Listening to the commentary while watching this film shows just how detail-oriented director Antonioni was. Almost every scene, every prop has meaning and importance, and once you know what they are, you'll see just how brilliant this movie is.
They truly don't make movies like this anymore! The scenery is implicit, the photography is fabulous, the cinematography is worthy of Kubrick himself! (The women actors are gorgeous too).

But the entirley new perspective and enthusiasm that is provided by Gene Youngblood's commentary really elevated the film to a higher level for me.  The film definitely stands on its own as a great work of art, but the Criterion edition helped me to adjust to Antonioni's style and language much quicker.  A great film, transfer, special edition, and commentary.  This is well worth the cost if you're looking for something interesting and new.

1423606,5,B00005BHW6,"Some people seem to think ""L'Avventura"" is Antonioni's first 'Great' film. No Way! Antonioni was already up there with the all-time greats with his first two Fifties masterpieces ""Chronicle of a Love Affair"" and ""Le Amiche,"" (Glad to say ""Le Amiche"" is now available in a very good transfer on IMAGE DVD with removeable subtitles in all its rapid-fire Italian dialogue glory which you can freeze and study at your own pace) although he didn't become quite the Revolutionary of Cinema until about the time of ""Il Grido (The Cry)"" which hinted at everything that soon crystalized on the magnificent trilogy of ""L'Avventura,"" ""La Notte,"" and ""The Eclipse,"" & later even expanded into an almost romantic and transcendent view of the future (through individuation & discarding of outdated myths and customs) in the vastly underrated artistic coup-d'etat of American cinema & all of American commercial culture: the awesome post-Hippie tour-de-force ""Zabriskie Point"" (a multi-million dollar commercial disaster that severely crippled Antonioni's later ability to raise financing).
The superb ultra-dense and illuminating commentary on the first disc of Criterion's ""L'Avvenura"" by Gene Youngblood (author of the late '60s cinematic theory classic ""Expanded Cinema""; for a different take on Antonioni, that goes even deeper than what Youngblood has to say on this disc without becoming didactic or pretentious in any 'film-or-art-school gibberish' way, you cannot do much better than William Arrowsmith's long essay in ""Antonioni: Poet of Images"";), that alone, along with the pristine transfer of the film itself (only one negligable line in the final party scene which they've reduced to an absolute minimum) would easily be worth the price of 4 movie tickets.
But you also get a second disc which doesn't have too much on it, but what it does have is fantastic: a rare 1 hour mid-'60s French documentary on Antonioni & Jack Nicholson's passionate reading of 3 of Antonioni's most insightful essays (and later a recalling of a hilarious incident on the set of ""The Passenger"").
Now, for a superstar like Nicholson (who has never embarrassed himself as an artist or sold-out to the Hollywood mainstream despite a thousand and one opportunities & made the producers of ""Batman"" pay points through the nose for agreeing to appear in that fluff piece) to take the time to pay his respects to a director he truly admires, and promote the sale of this DVD, should teach some of the younger generation of actors something (or even Robert De Niro, who has for many years now, it's pretty friggin' obvious, gone completely mainstream, and is busy doing DVD commentaries for awful pieces of unfunny, brain-dead commerical putritude like ""Meet the Parents,"" that didn't need his commentary to sell a zillion copies!)! The documentary is in Black and White and among other things which are of supreme interest for cineastes, are the rare interviews with Cesare Zavattini (one of the founders of Neo-Realism), Ennio Flaiano (Fellini's and Antonioni's co-writer), Giovanni Fusco (the Rolls Royce to Ennio Morricone's Ford Mustang in the Paisano hierarchy of film composers), Monica Vitti (at home, in the early '60s with Antonioni himself, who doesn't talk to the interviewer & only throws in an occasional comment!), and Fellini (taking a break from filming ""Juliet of the Spirits"" to talk to the enquiring interviewer about his friend & co-writer on ""The White Sheik""). There are some rare, very revealing shots of Antonioni directing films which give you a rough idea of his style of interaction with cast and crew (in one scene, he is shown directing Princess Soraya, the former wife of the Shah of Iran, whom the Shah had divorced for not having borne him a son!). Last but not least, we also get to see the ridiculously vulgar American trailer for ""L'Avventura"" that tries to sell it to 'high-class' American audiences as some kind of 'sophisticated' European sex-exploitation film by showing every 'provocative' little snippet in the entire film!",1005868800,43,4035,5.180704441041348

This movie isn't just for those into cool, existential angst, however.  If you're willing to put aside all the preconceptions about icy European art cinema, this movie starts to work some magic. For one, it is without hyperbole one of the most beautiful films ever made.  Secondly, Antonioni's controversial experiments with cinematic language actually work, if you let them.  Those who dislike slow moving films will probably find nothing of value here---this one flows like cold syrup.  But if you're willing to be hypnotized, the slow, sneakily methodical pacing of this movie will grow on you.
For lovers of sheer craft, there isn't much better than this.  For those who prefer sense to sensibiliy, watch out.  This will very likely put you to sleep.

Of all the commentary offered so far by criterion this is by far the best though the film is not necessarily for everyone.  The pacing is a bit slow at times for the moviegoer who enjoys films with more action and overt sexuality(though the two lead actresses have beauty enough to leave you enchanted), but L'Avventura is always interesting for fans of film who want to learn more about the technique and art of moviemaking.

1423610,5,B00005BHW6,"...this Criterion DVD edition of L'AVVENTURA is a widescreen anamorphic 2-disc set, with the first disc movie-only and the second containing extras.  I applaud putting the movie on its own disc, so that there could be less video compression and the picture quality could be at its best (whenever I see a single-disc DVD fully loaded with extras, I immediately wonder if the higher degree of compression needed would cause any compression artifacts on the picture).  The picturesque photography of L'AVVENTURA really demands as perfect a video transfer as possible.  I'm glad Criterion has delivered on that regard, for this DVD has simply one of the best black-and-white transfer I've ever seen.  Efforts have been made to eliminate blemishes frame-by-frame, so this DVD is significantly better looking than Criterion's own laserdisc version made in 1989.  There is a ""restoration demontration"" among the DVD extras that shows how the picture looks before and after the clean-up.
Subtitles have been significantly rewritten compared to the LD.  With my limited knowledge of Italian I'm of the impression that the new translations are more literal, closer in meaning to the original dialogs, and have less paraphrasing and abbreviation.  For instance, in an early scene where Anna confides to Claudia, the LD subtitle reads, ""These separations are awful, believe me.""  On the DVD it becomes, ""It's harrowing having to be apart, really.""  The use of ""harrowing"" seems more suitable than ""awful"" in conveying the connotations of the the Italian word ""mostruoso"" (atrocious), and ""really"" is the exact translation of ""verimente"".  In another dialog later in the same scene, the LD subtitle is abbreviated into, ""It's not easy to keep going like this...at a distance,"" whereas the DVD's translation is accurate almost word for word, ""It's difficult keeping a relationship going, while one is here and the other there.""
The best extra on the DVD is a terrific 1-hour documentary about Antonioni's work.  It has numerous interviews of his collaborators (including Fellini) and acquaintances, all of whom give insightful answers about the genius of the director.  It mentions a wonderful anecdote: several reporters and writers at Cannes signed a letter of support in reaction to the hostile reception of L'AVVENTURA by others (the full letter is reprinted on the DVD booklet).  There is also a wonderful clip of a deleted scene from L'AVVENTURA.  My minor quibbles are none of his films is dealt with in any length or depth, and not too many of clips of his films are shown.
Three extras from the LD have been retained on the DVD: the English theatrical trailer, Antonioni's eloquent statement on science versus moral (reprinted on DVD booklet), and the audio commentary by Gene Youngblood.  Not on the DVD is the LD's photo gallery of then-and-now comparisons of the locations seen in the film.  The DVD also has 3 audio segments: 2 of Antonioni's writings read by Jack Nicholson, and one of Nicholson himself lavishing praises on the director.  Of the two Antonioni writings, the first is almost a duplicate of his ""science versus moral"" statement, and the second is an analysis of the purpose of a film actor.",992044800,41,3205,5.120921305182342
1423611,5,B00005BHW6,"Is there a more apt film made that represents modernism? This story of a woman's disappearance, two people's search for her throughout the duration of the film... sound familiar? It's still being echoed in fiction and film, especially in the latest of the post-modern offering of a Japanese master of fiction: Haruki Murakami's ""Sputnik Sweetheart."" The barebones of the book resembles the plot of 'L'Avventura'.  The themes of the instability of modern-day existence, and the moral bankruptcy/irrelevance are still haunting. Antonioni's direction is architectural and masterful. The vistas are captured in a ghostly sparse way. Movements and shots are resolutely metaphorical - We see people moving away in the distance in divergent directions after a conflicting discussion. Moments of beauty abound throughout... the way a woman's neckline slopes, a crowd of people spilling out from the church to the street... Everything is so well executed, yet doesn't feel clinical. A masterpiece of modernism.",990748800,7,1001,5.542483660130719
1423612,4,B00005BHW6,"For Antonioni, life is an ""adventure"" a quest for identity and meaning.
It is no accident or inconsistancy that the initial group of characters seem to forget all about their friend who suddenly vanishes on a barren volcanic island. The unexpected absence seems to open a void of speculation, which the balance of the film proceeds to explore.
It should always be remembered that the VISUAL aspect in Antonioni is as important as the verbal; and, often, it is more important. The characters continuously gaze at a landscape, run their hands along a rock or some other surface as if trying to see or feel what is under the veneer. There is something almost Eastern in Antonioni's aesthetic. His films seem to view the material world as an enormous surface illusion. People, the director has said, have lost touch with their true origin, as part of the natural world. Large cities and technology have cut us off, and isolated us from nature. The modern individual is constantly in search of a primal connection. This explains the preoccupation with sex in some characters, something Antonioni calls ""serial monogamy"". Since sexuality, as Huxley has said, is the only remaining link to the mystery of life, humans turn more and more to it as their world achieves greater sophistication and technological advancement.
Through a poetic use of black & white image and spare dialogue, Antonioni creates a world of strangely compelling and sympathetic characters. The viewer is compelled along with them on their ""avventura"".
The Criterion DVD release of ""L'Avventura"" is pretty much what it should be. The film itself looks better than ever, with the technology's ability to represent black level so well, it looks more like a 'film', not a video. The supplementary documentary doesn't offer many insights, but is completely fascinating as a document of a great period in Italian cinema. The behind-the-scenes footage is priceless, as is a short interview with Giovanni Fusco, Antonioni's composer for several key films. Jack Nicholson reads some interesting texts, but it's too bad only one image is displayed throughout the readings. As for the audio commentary, it is mainly useful for information. Youngblood's interpretation seems too generalized at times, while he passes over important moments without any comment. Simply saying a technique or a type of shot is ""typical"" of the director is not enough. What does it mean? Or how does it figure in the film as a whole. Still, Youngblood's enthusiasm must not be discounted: his commentary can spark the viewer's own imagination about the film.

More than even that, it is one of those revolutionary works of genius, like James Joyce's ""Ulysses"", that tear down boundaries no one else even knew were there and blaze dozens of new trails for an art form.
And, since movie revival houses have pretty much gone the way of the adding machine, there is currently no better way to attend its majesty than with this DVD edition. The all-important images have been meticulously restored to their pristine state of dazzling subtlety and beauty and the insightful commentary track is a virtually ideal primer in learning to understand and appreciate Antonioni's pioneering film language.
Criterion has performed a noble service for cinema with the creation of this DVD. Why not reward them - and yourself - by buying it right now?",983836800,3,847,4.888888888888889

The new Criterion restoration is vastly superior; I know because I have both versions and the difference is like night and day.
I paid about $24 for my new blu-ray version and it is great. Don't waste your money on an old DVD of inferior quality..",1499126400,,371,4.23943661971831
