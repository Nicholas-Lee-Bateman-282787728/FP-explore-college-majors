7669472,5,B01BUQ70OG,"Imagine the entire world's fate rests in the hands of grade school assassins and their teacher.  Now imagine the teacher is the one going to blow up the world and is the students target.  Next imagine the teacher is practicality unkillable and has a serious problem with morals and common sense.  Finally imagine the students are the failed rejects of assassin school, add milk, stir and bake at 350degrees for a season.

Follow along and learn the important lessons about life, friendship and murdering the insane creature that is teaching these lessons. Mayhem, math, and tentacles.

So just why are we letting a group of children defend the earth.  Cause he already blew up the moon, the combined militaries failed, and this is the only chance he's giving us.

 So on with the classes, guns, knives, psychological warfare and even more tentacles.  Save the world Kill the teacher!",1458691200,3,883,4.912162162162162
7669473,5,B01BUQ70OG,"Assassination Classroom is a pretty strange anime and that's saying quite a lot.  We have anime with food as the main characters, we have an anime that's ""food porn"", we have a detective that was shrank down to a child's age and body and now we have an anime that's about a classroom filled with assassins and their target: the teacher.

  Yeah the students are trying to kill their teacher but that won't be easy with the unkillable Koro Sensei that can move at mach speeds.  Koro Sensei is an octopus seemingly bent on destroying the world after he destroyed the moon.  Before destroying the world, the octopus wants to teach at a top school.....but it's a special class who were thrown out from the main campus due to low grades and other reasons.  The 3-E class is mercilessly harassed by the top ranking students and even the principal.

Koro Sensei seems invincible but he does have weaknesses; porn, big-breasted women and he's easily embarrased. Yeah this is a comedy.

Conventional weapons won't harm Koro Sensei; each student are armed with special anti-sensei knives and guns that shoot out BB's.

Can the 3-E class kill Koro Sensei?

The English dub is great but then I think that every dub is great. Certain people out there may  think otherwise and everyone is entitled to their opinion.",1470960000,3,1301,4.733333333333333
7669474,4,B01BUQ70OG,Bought after hearing good things and was not disappointed. The art style is very appealing and the episodes are very entertaining and fun to watch. With that being said there are a lot of characters with only a few getting actual screen time and then even more characters added on later in the series.,1470700800,2,301,4.592592592592593

7669480,4,B01BUQ70OG,I went to anther place to get mine. It's complete set but from Malayisa. It's good in both artwork and story. I would get from these guys but they asking a lot money and they split it up as well. It only 22 episode on 3 disc. I am glad that I got it. I been wanting to get it for some time. To bad it was to short. The episode was not long.,1462060800,,340,3.608108108108108

7669482,4,B01BUQ70OG,"At Kunugigaoka Junior High School, Class 3-E has just gotten a surprise - the strange yellow creature responsible for turning the moon into a permeant crescent is now their teacher! After destroying the moon, he declared the Earth would be up next - so now in addition to being taught by a yellow octopus, the students of Class 3-E are tasked with assassinating their teacher. To sweeten the deal, there is a 10 billion yen bounty to collect!

This is pretty fun show. It is brightly colored and well animated, filled with lots of fun characters, and delivers plenty of laughs. It also has a strong streak of drama, which balances out the show nicely. The students of 3-E are considered the worst in the school (they are even in different building to separate them from the other students), so many of the more serious elements of the show deal with helping these kids realize that they aren't hopeless cases and do indeed have their own strengths and talents. It was lots of fun to watch them go from apathetic and bitter to confident and happy.

The first season is 22 episodes (this set contains the first half) and at the time of this review the second season is still airing. I really liked the ending of the first season, but it doesn't answer the important questions, such as ""Where did Koro-sensei come from?"" and ""Can I learn to move that fast?"". But if you wanted to end there you could. Of course, if you enjoy the first season, you will like the second season too.

PS For those reviewers that are complaining that the set isn't worth $80, you are looking at the Limited Edition. The standard Blu-Ray is only $50 (at this time). Please stop writing reviews about the price.

UPDATE 7/23/16: I've just finished watching season 2, which ends the series. I just have to say that the way the story progressed, Koro-sensai's backstory, and the way the series ended, all made me like this show even more. I am now thinking it might be necessary for me to buy all of the DVDs :)",1459900800,10,1983,4.5307262569832405

8751531,5,B01BUQ70OG,If you are on the edge about this show well its pretty much a silly good time which tons of brilliant comedic moments and an interesting plot thrown in the mix. This show is about as outlandish as it gets but I absolutely love it.,1510012800,,230,4.133333333333334

8751534,5,B01BUQ70OG,"While this is technically an action series, I find it more like a sitcom that also makes references to other animes like Saint Seiya and NARUTO!!

The characters are wonderful, too, (especially Karma, Nagisa, Isoga, Rio, Kaede, Manami, Yukiko, Irina and Karasuma) with their reactions towards Korosensei! XD

It's also becomes relatable to us, because the characters of Class E are also victims of bullying; their class is considered the lowest-of-the-low to other students and teachers at Kunugigaoka Junior High...",1489622400,,516,5.4375

8751538,5,B01BUQ70OG,"This has got to be in my top 3 favorite anime of all time, and I've watched lots of anime. I just recently finished watching AC, and I already want to rewatch it; It's that addicting! I would watch this over other bigger series like One Piece, and Full Metal Alchemist any day!! The thing I love the most, is the shows's ability to emerse you, conncet you with the characters, and make you feel like your a part of class 3E.

To keep this review spoiler free a group of students who have the worst grades and are the most disrespectful in the whole school have been assigned to class 3E, and their goal by the end of next March is to kill their teacher. Why you may ask? Well, Koro Sense (problay spelt that worng) is no ordinary teacher. He will be destroying the entire Earth by March next year, and it is up to Class 3E to strategically assinate Koro Sense before he assinates the planet!!

I've recommended this show to a few friends I know who watch anime, and they come back to me in amazement! Would recommend this to anyone wanting to watch a great anime. I'm sure you'll be sucked in like I was!!",1474329600,,1105,4.257142857142857
