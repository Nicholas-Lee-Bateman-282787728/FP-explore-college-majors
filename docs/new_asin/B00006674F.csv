1711641,5,B00006674F,"I love the theme it holds, being set in the 80s around people who are huge in their respective industries is amazing. All of the keys to success this book holds could open doors for anyone who reads it. The character development is heart warming and fun, and the language they use really resembles those days of rock n roll and the beginning of rap.",1465862400,,349,4.384615384615385

1711644,4,B00006674F,"Small independent film with lots of cameos! I enjoyed the films story, it reminded me of the films from the 50's with the private investigator narrating his quest to solve the crime he was hired to solve. It was very funny at times.",1385942400,,232,4.4186046511627906
1711645,5,B00006674F,"i picked this up the other day in a value bin and was shocked, the movie is really funny and well written, and the cameos in the movie are awesome. anthony michael hall is just a misunderstood guy with a good german recipe. danny masterson is great this is better that many of the recent movies in theaters. i wold recommend this film any day.",1139788800,4,343,4.292307692307692
1711646,3,B00006674F,"Sure the film is lacking in visual and audio clarity, but the performances, writing and attitude are top-notch and original. Great little cult comedy. They should remake it with a bigger budget in fact.",1135900800,,202,4.970588235294118
1711647,4,B00006674F,"Ok, this has to be one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long LONG time.  The cast was amazing (even Jenna Jameson does a good job with her part) and the writing was witty and quick.  Plus the plot moves, all nudity and sex is handled tastefully (I honestly think there is only like ten seconds of actually nudity in the film, and most of the time it is hidden from view!).  Plus the fact that Anthony Michael Hall has one of the best cameos in any movie, ever.  Grab a copy soon.  You won't regret it.",1060732800,6,508,4.04
1711648,4,B00006674F,"Whether you want to refer to it as a 'B' movie or not, this movie is hilarious!  Although the production values are lacking at times, the script is smartly done.  The plot revolves around the capers of Dirt Merchant (Danny Masterson) trying to prove that he's innocent of a murder charge with the help of his buddies Sly (David DeLuise) and Sponge (David Faustino).  Toss in a few cameos by Anthony Michael Hall and a heaping helping of adult film star/mainstream goddess Jenna Jameson and you've got yourself an enjoyable little cult movie!

Pro:
- Smart and hilarious script
- Loads o' cameos
- Jenna!
Con:
- Sometimes EXTREMELY poor production value
- No extras on the DVD",1025568000,12,675,4.694915254237288
