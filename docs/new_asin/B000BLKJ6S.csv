2423577,5,B000BLKJ6S,These are great little gems that show James Dean working his craft in the budding new medium of Television. I'm glad to add this to the all too small collection of James Dean's works.,1206316800,16,183,4.411764705882353
2423578,5,B000BLKJ6S,"I have never reviewed a product before but I had to for this!  I am a huge James Dean fan and I have all the other documentaries out and this...by far is the best that I have ever seen!!!  The Director makes you feel like he's giving you a seat at James Deans family and friends dinner table.  It is much more than just facts on James Dean..it's his ""real"" life, dreams, secrets, loves.  I feel like I have been given a diary that I'm not allowed to read...I absolutely LOVED it!!!",1176076800,,481,4.195652173913044
2423579,4,B000BLKJ6S,"I bought this DVD just before the last guy from Norway left his review.  I have to admit, after reading his review I started to question my decision to buy this documentary.  Then I watched the dvd when it arrived yesterday and felt so relieved and happy I bought it.  First of all, the guy from Norway claimed that this wasn't a documentary because it was made up of interviews... Isn't THAT what a documentary is??  That guy was nuts, this had interviews and film footage and tons and tons of photographs just like every other documentary I have seen.  In fact, it had so much going on over the interviews that I felt I didn't see the photos long enough.  To claim there was no footage over the interviews is insane.  Maybe he saw a totally different documentary?  That guy also claimed there was no narration, yet I counted not only one narrator, but six (I think) narrators total. Trust me, that last reviewer is wrong.

All-in-all, the documentary was pretty good, but the dvd as a whole was incredible.  It left me feeling like I sat down and had personal conversations with these people who are probably not around anymore.  I really liked that.  What I liked best about this dvd is the fact that it had so much extra footage.  I still haven't watched all of it, but it kept me very interested and excited to see so much new stuff.  The trivia was awesome, I laughed so hard going through it that I had to play it again for friends!  The video tours were fine, I don't know what Norway was talking about?  Watching it, I had my own private video tours with people I would love to one day meet and I couldn't be happier.  The photos, wow, the photos are priceless!  They're even set to music so I even found myself tapping my foot.

I recommend this dvd, too.  If you're a James Dean fan, this offers more than any other documentary on him that I have bought by leaps and bounds.  Money well spent!",1171324800,3,1904,4.367521367521367
2423580,5,B000BLKJ6S,"This set has literally tons of info and cool stuff packed in it.  The first disc has the movie which is a great document of Dean's earliest years.  If you are a Dean junkie like me, you've seen the same images used over and over in other documentaries.  Born Cool has a  treasure trove of pictures I've never seen anywhere!  It debunks a few myths, and has testimony from the people that knew him before he became the legend.  There is also a great trivia challenge on this disc.  Disc 2 has a cornucopia of James Dean facts, pics, museum tours etc.  I spent 3 hours combing through the extras and I still haven't seen it all.  Definitely worth the money.",1133827200,5,655,4.347107438016529
2423581,5,B000BLKJ6S,"This is a very well done documentary on james dean. It has a lot of great photos previously  unseen and the tour of the Gallery and Museum was interesting, especially as I will never get to go there in person. The personal interviews with his relatives and friends were very good as well. If you are a big admirer of Jimmy Dean as I am, then this d.v.d. set is a must have. You won't be disappointed.",1368316800,,400,4.194805194805195
2423582,5,B000BLKJ6S,I'm sure my daughter is going to love getting this.  She will be happy to have anything with James Dean.,1356048000,,104,4.2
2423583,5,B000BLKJ6S,This is an awesome disc that actually shows full episodes not just clips of TV appearances that JD was on when he was in NY doing TV and Broadway love it and the cover is yummy,1354665600,5,176,3.9166666666666665
2423584,5,B000BLKJ6S,Gift for my daughter was a big hit.  She is a great James Dean fan and was quite surprised by this DVD.  Said she didn't know he had a TV career.,1294185600,9,145,3.6451612903225805
2423585,1,B000BLKJ6S,"Researched this dvd.  Despite the comment of the other reviewer, was led to believe that the Robert Altman documentary ""The James Dean Story"" WAS in fact, the full 80+ minute version.
Received it today via Amazon who sent it to me on behalf of one of their sellers.
1.  ""As new"" was NOT how I received it.  The dvd case was broken, the 2 dvds were SIGNIFICANTLY scratched/scuffed.  NO liner notes.  That alone merited it being returned to Amazon.
2.  More importantly (and this is why Amazon should remove it from their listings) - even though the dvd outer notes boast ""includes the full-length Robert Altman documentary"" - NOT !!!  The version here is 40 minutes - the original was somewhere in the region of 80+ minutes.
Thanks to the original reviewer who posted here - I should have heeded the warning.",1287619200,2,807,4.640845070422535
2423586,4,B000BLKJ6S,This hard to find DVD is not available in stores and the only place I know that has it online is the Fairmount Historical Musume hompage,1271635200,2,136,4.269230769230769
2423587,4,B000BLKJ6S,"'J.D.: The Fast Lane' is a nice, worthy set to showcase his TV Years. It may not have all of his TV works on it (some were lost and are not available in the archives for footage), but we get 10 full-length TV studio episodes on this set.  I will say that some of the earlier episodes (such as Hill Number One) have this sort of blurry factor to it that make it slightly feel like you're watching it through a screen, and not every episode available is in restored, pristine condition (there are a few that have small jumps and white flicker/lines on the screen at times).  Overall though, the presentation quality of these episodes are decent to good (for the time they were made, it's okay to give slack for them not being of a high-quality transfer).

**** The episodes available on this set, in order on both discs, are as follows:
- Hill Number One
- 10,000 Horses Singing
- Abraham Lincoln
- The Evil Within
- Something for an Empty Briefcase
- Sentence of Death
~Disc 2
- A Long Time Till Dawn
- The Bells of Cockaigne
- Harvest
- I'm a Fool
**** Included extras are:
- Pepsi commercial
- Highway Safety PSA
- The James Dean Story
- Trailers to his 3 feature films, as well as Fixed Bayonets, Sailor Beware, Has Anybody Seen My Gal, and Trouble Along the Way (all of which he had bit parts/cameos in)

> It is of important note* that 'The James Dean Story' (Robert Altman documentary) is a truncated, hops-to-the-next-scene-abruptly version, and is missing around 40 minutes from its overall runtime for unknown reasons (my guess is it was trimmed for time/space allotted on the disc). Luckily, I've seen the full version before, and noticed there are some interviews left out on this edited version (such as from past college roommates, etc.) - *overall runtime on this disc's version of it is 50 mins.
> Of particular note is the inclusion of episode, 10k Horses Singing, in which I personally feel was not needed to have included the whole episode (and just include his one minute scene instead). He only has 2 words as Bellhop in this, which are, ""Yes"" and ""To 1030"" which in-turn makes me feel that they could've put The Unlighted Road in-place of this one (which is available from archives), especially since it's one of my faves of his TV work (sadly, Unlighted Road and a couple available others are not on this set for unknown reasons).

+++  I did notice a few slight mishaps (which are barely noticeable) on the 2-Disc set, which are:
- On the Highway safety PSA synopsis, it has one tiny spelling error when it mentions J.D.'s Porsche - it has ""in his Porcshe Spyder 550"" in the description.
- On the Main Menu screen of Disc 2, the display icon to Cockaigne accidentally has the footage from Harvest shown in it.
- On the Menu for Trailers, it shows all titles available, but Rebel is slightly cutoff at the ""Without"" point, showing only ""With"" instead because the Menu screen is stretched and therefore doesn't show the full title selection to it.
- This is an episode flub, but somewhat noteworthy nonetheless...
On the episode, Harvest, during the beginning scenes, it shows an on-air live camera pan mix-up in the footage, showing Dean and gal being directed by a guy infront, of their scene under the willow tree, a few seconds right before their first scene is to actually air with dialogue, etc.

<|> Overall, I'd give this Infinity set a 7.5/10 for a good effort, but still not quite up to my expectations on what a truly Complete TV Collection is for James Dean.  Atleast this beats having to watch these episodes on YouTube when you feel the urge to watch his younger days. ;-]",1258156800,8,3606,4.545454545454546
2423588,5,B000BLKJ6S,"Hi guys,
I'm Jim Scholten, pres. of the former ""J.D. Memory Club Holland"".
I was so lucky as to purchase my ""cool"" copy from a sideline offer like new & used. My NEW copy was only for a third of the amazon price. Well, that's lucky indeed. For this kind of money that this product  is offered now by Amazon, I find it still worth wile.

As for my observations; this dvd is really a great item to have, a lot of info from Jim's childhood period that so far never had been shared with the ""public"". The 2 tours through the museums give one an even better, ""richer""  view of how much Jim was liked and appreciated, not only by those who new him but also by those who came to know him through the media. Really too bad that the product is being discontinued by the manufacturer.",1246147200,,774,4.181208053691275
2423589,4,B000BLKJ6S,"ALPHA VIDEO's JAMES DEAN: CLASSIC TELEVISION COLLECTION features two hour-length and two half-hour dramas that Dean participated in during the early 1950s. The less-than-great sound and audio quality of these vintage unrestored 16mm prints detracts only a little from some fine performances.

In the religious allegory ""Hill Number One,"" Dean has a minor role (John).
Dean portrays an accused killer in the highly regarded ""Sentence of Death."" Betsy Palmer is the socialite who believes him innocent.
""I'm a Fool"" concerns a young Ohio man (Dean); his lie meant to impress a girl (Natalie Wood) has serious consequences. Adapted from a short story in Sherwood Anderson's ""Horses and Men"" anthology.
A young stockroom worker (Dean) in ""Bells of Cockaigne"" has a sick child. He's befriended by the company janitor (Gene Lockhart)--  an older man who dreams of hitting the lottery so he can visit his native Ireland once before dying.

My PC recognizes it after a while but only as a storage with individual files, some of which seem to be segments of the shows advertised.  There is no way to contact the seller--to give you an idea of Customer Service--so I would have to initiate a return and the shipping would cost probably close to what the DVD did, minus shipping--which they charged.

I don't think there is a problem with the ""DVD"" other than it is a CD with a bunch of video files (which I hope were not pirated!).

Don't buy!",1439164800,2,547,4.3431372549019605
