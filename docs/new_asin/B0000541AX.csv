7930890,5,B0000541AX,"This dvd is a must have for any Stereophonics fan.  I had this bought me for christmas and i haven't taken it out of my dvd player yet.  The dvd contains all the videos for the singles on the first two albums (Word Gets Around and Performance And Cocktails), the video for Tom Jones and Stereophonics and behind the secene footage for certain videos.  My favourite videos on the dvd are for Hurry Up And Wait (The once with the war theme) I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio (the one with the motorbikes in the desert) More Life In A Tramps Vest (the one with the people with televisions on their heads) and Taffic (the one set along a roadside with Kelly Jones on the phone).  All the videos are excellent so it is worth buying and the behind the scenes footage is cracking, you get to see the personalitiy of the boys without the glammer that surrounds people in the music business.
