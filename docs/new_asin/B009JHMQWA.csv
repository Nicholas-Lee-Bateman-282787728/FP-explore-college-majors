I personally spoke with a leading expert on the Shroud of Turin and he responded ""I can tell you this, that no one put it there.""",1362700800,2,293,4.157894736842105
8542244,5,B009JHMQWA,"If you like celebrating the season for the real reasons, and enjoy the nostalgia of Christmases past, then this little DVD gem is the perfect way to enhance your upcoming holiday's. Six short, yet inspiring Christmas films of faith and family, spanning the years 1939-56.

The description in the listing for this item above does a fairly straight forward job of telling you what each of the films is all about. I'd just like to add that as a film collector and nostalgia buff myself, I'd never seen any of these films in any format previously! I'm sure they'll all be new to you as well. Star of Bethlehem, a half-hour film from 1954 that was not only produced and directed by James Mason, but also stars him (the same year he won acclaim as Norman Maine in A Star Is Born) is the real highlight for me of the whole collection and worth the price of admission alone.

The whole production is top notch. The films look decent for their age, and are seamlessly edited together in a slick, professional way. This is no cheap, bargain bin DVD you find in those giant tubs in a nameless large department store chain. This is a top notch production from start to finish. I'd highly recommend it. It's sure to liven up any holiday party this season.",1349049600,,1242,4.491150442477876
