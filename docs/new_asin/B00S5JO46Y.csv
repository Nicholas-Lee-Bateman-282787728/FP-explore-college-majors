8697378,4,B00S5JO46Y,"this  is  a  decent  reissue  of  the  first  chronicles  dvd  that  originally  came  out  back  in  2003,  THIS  version  is  a  bit  cut  compared  to  its  original  version  so  i  would  reccomend  you  get  the  original  2  dvd  set  as  im  sure  it  is  not  all  that  hard  to  find,  anyway  instead  of  getting  the  whole  wacken  2001  gig  like  we  got  on  the  original  dvd  we  get  most  of  it  but  saxon  opened  with  KILLING  GROUND  at  wacken  01  wich  is  missing  here,  instead  this  starts  off  with  the  classic  motorcycle  man,  also  the  first  edition from  2003  had  a  bit  more  footage  of  the  classic  early  to  mid  80s  line  up  wich  i  see  was  omitted  from this  edition,  outside  of  that  everything  else  is  the  same,  this  comes  with  a  very  nice  photo  booklet  with  liner  notes  THAT  DID  NOT  COME  WITH THE  FIRST  EDITION,  outside  of  the  wacken  01  gig  you  get  a  nice  documentry  of  saxon  on  tour  in  the  us  and  mexico  with  udo  in  2000,  it  pretty  much  consist  of  life  on  the  tour  bus  across  the  us  and  down  into  mexico,  hotel  bars,  getting  to  venues,  a  bit  of  soundchecking  and  just  joking  around  by  all band  members,  there  is  a  few  great  songs  from  the  danish  festival  esbjerg  from  the  dogs  or  war  tour  in  1995  wich  has  always  been  a  highlight  of  this  dvd  set  for  me  as  there  is  very  little  footage  on  video  of  saxon  from  1990  to  1998,  it  shows  how  saxon  went  on  at  like  11:00  am  or  12  noon  in  denmark  and had  to  be  back  in  the  uk  by  THAT  EVENING  for  a  show  in  the  uk,  that  is  some  nice  footage, of  coarse  you  get  the  great  interview  with  biff  talking  everything  that  is  saxon  as  per  2002  as  that  was  the  year the  interveiw  took  place,  you  get  the  other  basic  dvd  options  like  the  live  menu,  title  selection,  discography  as  per  2003, on  disc  2  you  get  the  36  minute  film  of  the  us  tour  i  mentioned  before,  the  danish  festival  footage  from  1995  and  then  you  get  8  promo  videos  starting  with  power  and  the  glory  in  1983,  now  i  know  as  a  fact  that  there  where  5  vidoes  that  where  promos  made  between  1981  and  1982  but  they  are  not  included  here  wich  was  a  shame  i  felt,  the  promo videos  that  where  made  for  mtv  run  from power  and  the  glory  through  requiem (we  will  remember )  1991  HOWEVER  missing  is  the  2  lousy  promo  videos  that  where  made  for  mtv  from  1988  from  the  disasterous  1988  opus  DESTINY  (  regardless  of  how  bad  that  record  was  there  cover  of  ride  like  the  wind  was  amazing  and  im  glad  it  still  stays  in  saxons  live  set  to  this  day)  its  not  that  i  need  the  i  cant  wait  anymore  video  but  i  feel  all  these  things  good  or  bad  should  run  in  chronicle  order  by year  on  any  dvd  history  like  this,  a  gem  i  always  enjoyed  on  this  dvd  is  they  then  skip  after  requiem  forever  free  and  the  dogs  of  war  videos  and  go  straight  to  1997  and  there  we  get  the  unleash  the  beast  video  as  well  as  a  small  documentry  of  the  making  of  that  video  wich  is  awesome  as  that  was  the  best  saxon  record  in  the  90s  next  to  dogs  of  war  and  solid  ball  of  rock  also  forever  free  was  great  as  well.  after  this  you  do  get  to  see  some  early  80s  footage  with  interviews  and  some  great  t.v  appearances  and  then  the  second  dvd  ends  with  some  photo  gallery  footage  of  saxon  memorabilia  and  other  photos  from the  1970s  going  all  the  way  up  to  2002  when the  filming  of  this  dvd  was  complete, as  a  bonus  with  this  package  you  get  most  of  the  live  album  rock  n  roll  gypsies wich  was  recorded  in  budapest  in  1988  during  saxons  lowest  period  and  that  live  album  has  been  reissued  3  times  since  its  first  issue  in  1989,  it  is  a  good  live  saxon  document  but  for  this  set  i  felt  they  could  have  placed  a  better  show  from  a  better  era  with  this  collection,  this  over  all  is  a  very  nice  reissue,  also  check  out  the  new  warriors  of  the  road  dvd  set  as  that  dvd  is  basically  a  2014  part  2  version  of  THIS  dvd  from  2003,  this  is  overall  very  good  and  belongs  in  any  die  hard  saxon  fans  collection,  last  decade  and  now  into  this  decade  there  has  been  a  lot  of  great  saxon  live  video  and  audio,  as  saxon  has  been  my  FAVORITE  METAL  band  since  1981  and  i have  stuck  by  them  the  past  34  years  even in  the  late  80s/ through the  mid 90s  when  a  lot  of  my  friends  told  me  to  give  up  and  grow  up  i  kept  my  faith  in  saxon  and  i  NEVER  SURRENDERED,  i  loved  and  still  love  records  like  SOLID  BALL  OF  ROCK,  FOREVER  FREE,  DOGS  OF  WAR  AND UNLEASH THE  BEAST  as  much  now  as  when  they  came  out,  when  we  got  to  metalhead  and  killing  ground  (during  this  era  of  the  filming  you  will  see  on  this  dvd  set)  i  felt  saxon  went  for  a  more  modern  approach  wich  was  another  mistake  but  not  as  bad  as  the  destiny  mistake,  anyway  by  2004  saxon  have  been  back  at  the  top  of  there  game  since  lionheart  and  the  records  still  keep  getting  better  with  there  age,  that  was  one  thing  that  helped  an old  stubborn  saxon  fan  like  me  in  the  90s  SAXON  KEPT  PUTTING  NEW  ALBUMS  OUT  EVERY  2  YEARS  OR  SO...................  NEW  MUSIC  ALWAYS  HELPS  anyway  i  own everything  saxon  but  if  you  are  just  a  casual  fan unlike  me  i  highly  feel  these  are  the  2  best  saxon  dvds  to  get  TO  HELL  AND  BACK  AGAIN  (2007)  as  well as  THE  HEAVY  METAL  THUNDER  MOVIE  FROM  2010,  sadly  you  can  only  get  this  one  as  a  bootleg  but  the  live  nottingham  1983  show  is  out  there  on  dvd  but  saxon  sadly  never  officailly  released  that  but  you  CAN  FIND  IT  ON  THE  NET,  anyway  i  have  to  have  it  all  but  as  i  said  if  you  are  not  as  die  hard  as  me,  GET  THE  2  I  MENTIONED  ABOVE  BEFORE  THIS  ONE,  also  warriors  of  the  road  from  2014  is  great  to  and  that  comes  with  a  bonus  audio  cd  of  the  2014  live  at  bloodstock  gig,  anyway  as  of  now  i  look  foward  to  saxons  next  record  and  there  upcoming  warriors  of  the  road  us  tour  with  armored  saint  in  a  couple  of  months,  glad  saxon  have  stuck  around  this  long,  it  has  been  a  great  24  years  with them  and  i  am  so  so  happy  they  made  such  a  big  comeback  in  europe  as  i  see  my  predictions  from  20  years  ago  seemed  to  be  correct  as  i  always  felt  saxon  where  as  good  as  priest  and  maiden..................................",1427500800,13,6991,4.017137960582691
