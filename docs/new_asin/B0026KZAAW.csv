Also, a great price for 3 DVDs!",1257379200,29,192,4.361111111111111
8352951,3,B0026KZAAW,"This 3-DVD set was interesting, with plenty of anecdotal stories and details of studies regarding conscious and subconscious reactions to what we see, hear and think. What I learned about the subconscious mind made it worth the price I paid for this set, @ $14.95 last year, but certainly not much more than that. I see the cost is down to $12.96 today - a decent price for what you get. But if you are hard up for cash then I think you can get more bang for your buck through some of the other sources I will mention below.

I am a nutrition consultant so the science of the mind fascinates me. But this isn't the DVD for those seeking instructions on how to make any real mental changes since this set does not address the how-to aspect. For the how-to, Mr. Tayor suggests getting his InnerTalk CD's. So in this regard, as stated in other reviews and comments, the 3rd DVD is an infomercial. The first two DVD's are more informative, and Eldon Taylor is an engaging speaker, so you won't fall asleep.

However, after learning from another reviewer about the negative content of the InnerTalk program of CD's which Eldon Taylor promotes, I knew I would never purchase any of his CD's (content reported as ""I am unafraid"", ""I am in control"", ""I control my facial expressions"", ""I am free of fear and anger"" - borrowed from the Happy Dad review.) I try to be very careful about what I download into my subconscious.

Unfortunately, almost all affirmation or guided meditation CD's I have purchased over the years (including well-known's like Kelly Howell, Steven Halpern, and Candace Pert) contain what I would consider some negative content - things like 'think of the fear you are holding onto regarding your lack of (finances, being alone, health...fill in the blank) and now feel yourself releasing it'; or another one where after being almost euphorically guided through a blissful, natural setting, the narrator wraps it up by adding...'now you are walking past a dark mountain which represents your fear of lack and (a sadistic description of your fears)... release these fears as you walk past the mountain.' Talk about a buzz-kill!

It's hard to believe these people think this is a healthy way of releasing fear, pain, lack, etc.... The last thing I want is to be in a venerable, meditative state and then be told to think of the very thing I am attempting to overcome. Makes me wonder if some of these folks are backed by big pharma, big business, big-ag, etc... who benefit from keeping people sick, depressed, anxious, poor, angry and confused.

I recommend anything by Joe Dispenza, Gregg Braden, Bruce Lipton or John Assaraf - books, DVD's and CD's. The Heart Math books are great too. Gregg Braden points out how the brain produces more electrical energy, while the heart produces higher magnetic energy. (And the Heart Math books teach you to entrain the two.) Dispenza and Assaraf teach how to think the thought or affirmation and then imagine yourself 'feeling' what it would really feel like to already have it. As Braden and Dispenza point out, you begin to manifest or draw it into your experience, through the emotionally-based heart chakra, like a magnet. They also present the science to support this premise. Basically, they all teach that it is not enough to simply mentally rehearse affirmations, nor is it enough to input subliminal affirmations (with or without binaural beats.) You need a good mix of mental and emotional self-management, positive thought or affirmations, emotional response, and of course action. This is where I believe Mr. Tayor goes awry... making it seem the road to changing your negative thought patterns is as simple as listening to brain-synchronized affirmations. There is little doubt that science supports the benefit of this technology - but for most folks this will need to be in conjunction with an entire mind and body change. However, the studies and anecdotal evidence he presents in these DVDs do illuminate the power of the subconscious, and they provide a good starting point toward understanding it better.

The Bible says ""...call those things that do not exist as though they already did"" (Romans 4:17) and this is basically thought as speaking our affirmations into existence. But what if it means more? After years of doing affirmations without getting any results I watched the DVD ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" soon after its release. This led to reading more from Joe Dispenza, which led to Bruce Lipton and many others. Even though I'd been a Gregg Braden fan for years, it took the science from these two doctors to pull it all together for me. End-story: I'm better able to imagine and feel the feelings associated with my affirmations, and release the negative patterns of emotions and thought I have developed over a lifetime of difficulties - and I have received some pretty amazing results. I'm not saying immediate results, as this is all part of a learned discipline: beginning with meditation to gain control over the influx of negative data streaming into our minds and emotions. Braden refers to this as ""emotional self-management"" in his CD set `An Ancient, Magical Prayer', and Assaraf brilliantly teaches the power of meditation to learn mental self-discipline with some excellent suggestions on how to begin this in his book `The Answer'.  The next steps are to decide or focus on what you want, then awaken your imagination to draw, like a magnet, the manifestation of your affirmations or thoughts into the material, tangible plane of existence through the use of your heart and emotions. For more on why and how the brain and heart were meant to work coherently together for optimal health, abundance, peace and joy, you might want to refer to the book `The Heart Math Solution'.

I have also found Ho'oponopono helps to ""clear the data"", allowing one to quickly get to a zero point where inspiration can take place (I recommend the book `Zero Limits: The Secret Hawaiian System for Wealth, Health, Peace, and More' as a good introduction to this). But this practice does not always keep the negative data at bay which, for me, often leaks back in; how quickly it returns depends on your self-discipline or ability to self-manage your emotions. Eventually you are supposed to learn to run the program, so-to-speak, in the background of your mind. Although I have yet to master this, it does remind me of the bible admonition to ""pray without ceasing"".

It's really all a subjective learning process as diverse as the people involved. I realize part of my review is off-topic, and I don't usually diverge like this, but maybe it will help point some of you in the direction of other authors and modalities you might have overlooked... especially since there isn't just one, single, road that will work for everyone, even though we are all seeking to get to pretty much the same place.

Thanks for your time -- and blessings to all on this incredible, if not challenging, journey of life. :-)",1397260800,6,6983,4.845766974015088
8352952,5,B0026KZAAW,Change Without Thinking is an inspiring and educational video. I found the information Eldon Taylor presented about the power of the mind to be very intriguing. I have started to apply the principles I learned from the DVD and I already notice a positive change in my life. I highly recommend everyone watch this film!,1307577600,5,318,4.8
8352953,5,B0026KZAAW,"I can't describe just how amazing this video is. At first I was hesitant to buy, but now that I have seen the video, I am certainly glad I did! Well worth the price.",1307232000,4,165,3.8823529411764706
8352954,1,B0026KZAAW,I couldn't get past the 1st dvd let alone 2 others. I was completely lost and bored. Was nothing like I thought it would be. Had to toss it. Money down the drain.,1304640000,3,162,3.9393939393939394
8352955,5,B0026KZAAW,"I've read and seen a lot of the work Dr. Taylor has produced on this subject, and I highly recommend these videos as a go-to.

But, as always, the books are better (this axiom, it seems, extends beyond novels and short-stories and really holds true to all levels of writing), so really I'd recommend both to those who are truly interested.",1300924800,5,339,4.557377049180328
8352956,3,B0026KZAAW,"The first 2 DVDs of this 3 DVD set was a basic overview of new information regarding the mind and some of its inner workings, though it was mostly old news to me. NO personal DIY techniques for change are given. The last DVD offers the solution: buy the author's subliminal CDs. ""Change Without Thinking"" literally refers to using Mr. Taylor's subliminal CDS to make personal changes. One could view the seminar as a really long infomercial. If I had paid to attend, I would want my money back. Mr. Taylor's style is a bit in-your-face and what I'd call ""New Yorker"" abrasive, but not intolerable. Seems like there is a slight conservative Christian bias in his thinking and presentation. If you really want unbiased info about the mind and changing your thinking, I'd suggest ""What The Bleep"" and ""Living Matrix"" for starters.",1299801600,64,827,4.79020979020979
8352957,5,B0026KZAAW,"When you see the live-seminar-recording setting at first push of the play button, I was not thinking this was a stellar purchase. The speaker also appeared kind of lackluster at first blush. However I quickly found him and the material to be pulling me in and for 3 DVDs, you can't beat the amount of content for the price.

It is simply a recorded live seminar with odd little bits of ""chapter breaks"" curiously edited in to break up the seminar. The production value isn't world-class. BUT... if you enjoyed ""What The Bleep"" or have any interest in subliminal materials and how your brain can be influenced & react without your awareness, you will enjoy this as much as I did.

Dr. Taylor's warm manner, proven track records and engaging stories of his own vulnerabilities and life make what could have been information overload of massive amounts of material into a very enjoyable experience.

I just finished placing an order for some of his Inner Talk CDs to reap the benefits of what I now feel is really possible for change in my own mind. I always secretly doubted, even though I also secretly hoped that subliminal self-help would work for me. Now I truly believe it will. He is such a sought-after expert in so many fields and has done so many studies to prove his results. For these DVDs to entice me to search out his website and make a purchase, his message really hit home. There is only a quick mention of his site, I had to go back and find it again on purpose. By the way, he has free samples of some of his materials there as well: [...]

I took pages and pages of notes and am already using one of his methods, the ""help someone else out diary"", to get my head out of my own habitual depression-focused neural pathways. It is easy to do daily and worth the time and money of the whole DVD set if you have issues with letting go of depression like I do. I was in tears as he discussed the patient he came up with this exercise for, I could identify strongly with parts of her story. I will especially watch the last DVD over and over again.",1299456000,13,2058,4.37958115183246
8352958,5,B0026KZAAW,"I cant say enough about the masterful way Eldon Taylor leads you through the massive amount of information gathered from years of training, and perfecting the programs he develops to inspire and motivate others towards discovering their greatness. He has a loving and down to earth approach that instantly draws in the viewer, I was glued to the TV hanging on to every word! I would absolutely recommend Change Without Thinking to anyone of any age. In fact the earlier we teach  our kids this stuff, the better. Eldon is a master teacher, and being a counselor myself, I am aware of the benefit of having information related in a way that makes sense without the need for deep reflection.
His radio show is great too, tune in, Provocative Enlightenment, on Hay House Radio([...]) every Tuesday at 11 AM PST. Keep stretching!

This DVD was very positive assistance in my life as well as Eldon Taylor's InnerTalk CD's which i used a month later. It helped me realize on a deeper level that I had the power to change anything about myself i didn't like or was uncomfortable with, as well as understand the influence of Negative subliminal messages from Corporations in every aspect of our personal and public lives is serious business NOT to be underestimated. I hope this review assists others to come out of the unnecessary 'closet of pain'. Be well and thanks for listening

Eldon Taylor covers a great deal of information, from the workings of the human mind to manipulation techniques to achieving your spiritual goals - and he does this in a very entertaining manner. I enjoyed this set immensely and would love to hear him speak in person! The DVD set would be worth it at 10 times the price.",1257379200,31,346,4.421875
