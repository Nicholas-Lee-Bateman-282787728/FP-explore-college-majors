4488361,5,B004WO9OR0,"If you're like me and you're a dude, you probably figure you could do reasonably well in a survival situation, but you often wonder how you would fare if your girlfriend was stuck with you. This show is GREAT in showing you what that would be like. The girl knows only a little about survival, and the guy knows pretty much everything. Not only is it a ""survival"" show, it can give you a small lesson on interpersonal relationships and how to handle an extreme situation where you may have to care for a loved one as well. This survival program is unique in that way, which makes for a fun and interesting way to spend your time. The two are VERY likable, and seem like very ordinary people, and like a very stable, ordinary, fun couple.

The other great thing is that if you have an fairly open minded girlfriend, she will enjoy watching this show with you, as she can relate to the girl on the show, who is just perfect as a strong woman; not too over the top prissy or too in your face authoritative. She's feminine but not ""girly.""  The guy is ""manly"" but not in an overly aggressive way. The show is pretty comical at times, the way they interact, and has enough variety and exotic locations to keep things interesting. Very realistic as far as survival shows go.

In all, both me and my girlfriend very much enjoyed watching this show, and I would highly recommend it to couples interested in survival shows or guys interested in survival shows that portray surviving with a loved one. Great show, great purchase!",1330128000,,1519,4.4765342960288805
4488362,5,B004WO9OR0,"If you enjoyed Les Stroud's Survivorman DVD series, you'll certainly like Mykel Hawke and Ruth England in Man Woman Wild. They're a married couple surviving in scenarios similar to Stroud, where there is the simulation of an outdoor adventure gone wrong. They have at least one cameraman with them, but otherwise the structure of the show is like Survivorman. This couple is an absolute unqualified joy to spend viewing time with. I'm very happy to have discovered this series.",1324166400,,477,5.050632911392405
4488363,4,B004WO9OR0,"Man, Woman, Wild is one of the best shows on television.  I now know that I can survive anything as long as I quote the Sergeant Major whenever I am mad at my husband.",1319932800,2,167,3.911764705882353
4488364,5,B004WO9OR0,"Ruth and Mykel Hawke's show on the Discovery Channel is another in the survival type reality show that is found on Discovery. ALthough Ruth and Mykel have a crew following them, their show is a different from Cody Ludin's and Dave Canterbury's Dual Survival, in that Ruth has very little knowledge of survival skills and depends on her husband's SF skills. She is willing to learn and does not shirk from what has to be done. That is what makes this show interesting because she is willing to try.
I also have a lot of respect for Mykel because he was willing to call for help when Ruth was going down with the heat in Mexico.
The show is enjoyable and the couple have good chemistry.",1317600000,11,684,4.436507936507937
4488365,4,B004WO9OR0,"Okay, we all know that the guys in these survival shows are not actually in emergency situations. They are surrounded by cameramen and there is a base camp nearby. I also find it hard to believe that in real life anybody would be so foolish as to go on day-long hikes or snowmobile trips or boat rides with no more provisions than a tiny bottle of water and a handful of raisins - and without a lighter! However, once I got past the not-quite-realistic premises, I found myself enjoying the episodes.

Unlike ""Dual Survival"", which pairs two survival experts from different backgrounds and thus different approaches to survival situations, ""Man, Woman, Wild"" is interesting because one of the characters, Mykel, is a survival expert whereas his wife, Ruth, is not.

In her role as apprentice, Ruth frequently has to step out of her comfort zone. She stands for all of us who would be truly lost and in danger if we ever had to spend more than a few hours outdoors without a tent, a cooler loaded with victuals, a port-a-pottie, and an air mattress (or, preferably, a fully stocked and air-conditioned camper, or, even better, an RV!). She shows us that it is challenging, yet possible to overcome squeamishness and inhibitions and, for example, cut up and eat an armadillo that got killed by a wildfire. Yes, she can be a bit overbearing, and, yes, she squeaks and squeals a lot and carries on about snakes and bugs and things that go ""boo"" in the dark, but I can identify with her. Although I greatly admire Mykel's skills and training, to me, Ruth is the more inspiring character of the two and the hero of the show.

On the other hand, she shows us that even the company of a survival expert does not guarantee survival: In the ""Mexico"" episode, she can't drink enough urine to stay hydrated; she suffers from heat exhaustion and Mykel has to call in the team medic to avoid a life-threatening situation. And ""Alaska"" would have killed them both.

ETA 10/04/11:

After watching a few episodes of ""I Shouldn't Be Alive"" for the first time last week I need to revise the first paragraph a bit. There ARE people who are stupid enough to go on day hikes into the desert with no water or drive into a snowstorm with no snow chains on board.

MWW is still a bit odd insofar as these guys always forget to bring lighters, but they never forget their survival knives, and Mykel seems to carry a pair of gloves around at all times (one has to wonder where he keeps the gloves and why there isn't room for a lighter).",1316304000,10,2510,4.529801324503311
4488366,5,B004WO9OR0,"I'm really glad I checked this show out. I wrote it off at first as another survival show, this time the gimmick being a husband and wife in tough situations. Then I came across Capt. Hawke's books, they're really great. This guy has seen and done it all. I checked out the show with a bit more open mindedness and really enjoy it. Hawke's role on the show is the information bank, he knows a ton and fills us in with his personality and style, his wife's role is the knowledgeable everyman, (not the squeamish female role I'd foreseen). My wife and I think Ruth is great, she's fun to watch and is a nice 'in-between' for the regular citizen and the more experienced survival/military oriented individual. One other aspect to the show we really enjoy is the human reactions throughout each episode. It gives a more realistic look at the stresses of survival between party members, even between family members in a survival situation, more so than any show I've seen. Definitely worth checking out and adding to your library.",1315180800,33,1025,4.668508287292818
4488367,4,B004WO9OR0,"Good, but certainly somewhat contrived.
My wife and I both enjoy the show, but she has noticed Nykel os usually clean-shaven even on day 3 in the wild. I guess he made a razor from rocks and shaving cream from something.
And her hair somehow stays nice and clean.
Either that or they go to makeup off camera.
But we'll still buy the DVD",1314835200,5,336,4.265625
4488368,1,B004WO9OR0,"This is one of the worst survial series I've ever seen. It comes off as somewhat contrived to begin with, and that, coupled with Ruth's constant ""Oh no I can't do that!"" and ""Oh! Be careful!"" and ""A snake, oooh a snake!"" makes this nauseating to watch. She doesn't do much for advancing the public opinion of women in the outdoors.
The show seems to revolve around Mykel finding something to kill, then trying to get Ruth to kill it while she whimpers and tears up over it. For example, in one episode Mykel (stupidly) risks his neck climbing a tree to knock down a possum, telling Ruth to pin it with her spear and then kill it with her knife. So he knocks it down, Ruth runs BACKWARDS and before the possum hits the ground she's wailing ""Oh no! It's escaped! It's escaped!"" (Meaning ""I have no intentions of doing anything to try to catch this possum because it's dirty and could scratch me!)
The show also falls flat on it's attempts at ""witty"" banter. At one point Ruth says to Mykel ""I know what a dirty beast you are."" and he replies ""I prefer knuckle dragger.""
Terrible show all in all, as bad as that other pretend survival guy...BG, you know who you are...
If you want a real survival show stick with Les Stroud, or even Dual Survival. This show needs to be cancelled.",1314057600,13,1277,4.3924050632911396
4488369,5,B004WO9OR0,Myke provides excellent information and the interactions between husband and wife are enjoyable.  Ladies will especially relate to the comment by Ruth during the Amazon episode regarding the problems of sending a husband to the grocery.

4488380,5,B004WO9OR0,"Great show! Mr. Hawke teaches a lot of good stuff in these shows. He teaches a lot more survival stuff then most of the other survival shows out there if not all. The man/wife combo is a very new and refreshing take on survival.  Let Mr. Hawke teach you.  He will teach you things the other guys don't. I would love to see more seasons of this. And he does not get on your nerves like Cody Lundin and Joe Teti can. It seems like a more realistic show with less scripted dramatic enhancements. For example in Dual Survival there is inevitably  a point where they try to make it look like one of them is going to go off a cliff or get lost in the rapids then they go to a commercial and when they come back it is always a very minor issue. It gets annoying. Mykel Hawke is not whiny and have a weird high pitched voice like Cody Lundin and he is not over dramatic and is not so preachy and psycho intense like Joe Teti.
  I also like how while Mykel teaches his wife things we get to learn from that. You are more likely to be in a survival situation with a love one who is probably a survival novice rather than an bush craft expert anyway. And on top of all that it is humorous, the definitely don't take themselves too seriously (learn from this Teti!).  Buy this!",1445990400,,1265,4.121951219512195

This show about survival can become annoying to watch , I gave it 3 stars only because there are some good survival tips from the Man in the show because he is the one who seems to know survival. The thing I hate about the show  is it seems like a yuppie couple stuck in the woods , The man seems too relaxed and he always calls his wife love or babe which is annoying and you get tired of hearing it. The staged productions seem way too fake and the woman is the worst part of the show and I am not anti woman but she gets on my nerves just watching her in these situations with the husband always backing her in a relaxed and calm manner of politeness .While all she does is talk too much and the show seems fake and unreal which makes it difficult to watch at times. This production seems geared for young married couples with similar attitudes not realistic situations for regular men and women in that situation of survival .The survival tips are good but that is it ,everything else about this show is boring.",1407542400,,1092,4.25

From the staged situations, ""trick"" editing, bad scripts, horrible attempts at pretending to not ""act"" (if you even can call it that), and outright lies it is very hard to watch. I fell asleep during nearly every episode. (At least Bear Grylls makes his magic show entertaining.) There's a reason that Amazon has this on sale for $7.99 and that's because it's complete garbage. Meanwhile, quality survival shows like Survivorman and Dual Survival are priced at 2x to 6x higher than Man Woman Wild.

Mykel Hawke... what a guy. He's like a parody of a ""manly man"" extracted from a Coen Brothers or Wes Anderson film. And the only thing Ruth England is good for is a few handjobs. Neither of their lives are worth more than the lives of any animal they took for the sake of their ""survival"" in this ""reality"" show series. Maybe I'm being too harsh... Maybe I watched the show from the wrong point of view. Maybe...this was meant to be black comedy. Hmmm.
