8463951,1,B003CTVUJQ,"DVD "" The Hell Ride of The Liberators "" produced by
[...] in Germany in 2010 which is now widely distributed in US and UK .
This film cost about $ 14 -18 is a 100% fake and the buyer will windup angry for being cheated .

The  producer claims to analyze in there new facts of Operation Tidalwave  failures , though none of the footage
are these of 9th Air Force from Libya , Ploesti or Rumania ......just fakes  from various old footage
of **** films of 8th AF  over ETO and these of 11 AF over PTO mid 1944-early 45 ,the narrative and footage
are for a school boy who is about  to learn about planes and WWII.

From the historical point of view this DVD is not only a disaster and an outrage for the buyer  but safely to say
a well orchestrated fraud of someone in Germany coze this DVD has a large advertsing campaign on the net.

By the way the bonus material is a 15 minutes copy of **** films "" Liberators over Europe "" and fairly speaking
i doubt that the owner in Calif . has knowledge about it.",1288396800,15,1002,4.071428571428571
