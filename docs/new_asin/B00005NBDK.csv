1631635,5,B00005NBDK,"This was a very informative video about the overall operation of Death Row records.  The lives of all the artists were forever changed due to the relationship they had with Suge Knight.

1631636,5,B00005NBDK,"I have watched this on cable and the internet so many times I decided to finally go ahead and grab this on DVD. There's no speculative narrative here, the film's story is told straight through the mouths of former Death Row Records employees, journalists, associates, and even some of the original investors who helped start up the company in the first place. Hearing these stories from the actual people themselves puts you right in the middle of the studio making for a documentary a million times more frank and true to life than I was expecting. In this, you go from the early high energy days when Death Row was a creative hotspot for some of the the best and brightest of west coast hip hop, to something akin to a gang hangout that was barely producing anything. This movie is an absolute must watch for any fan of hip hop and even moreso if you grew up on Death Row's 90's offerings.

The actual DVD itself really steals the show here. When I first popped the disc in I spent two days watching the incredible extended interviews and outtakes over and over because they were so captivating. Basicly it boils down to longer versions of the Harry O and Snoop Interviews and a wonderful D.O.C. interview that wasn't featured much at all in the film. I really wasn't expecting much feature wise with the disc, but it's really loaded compared to other more as is home releases. To top it all off, there's a complete director's commentary track which is worth the purchase within itself and there's a nice preview of Simone Green-English' photography book ""Time Served: My Days and Nights at Death Row"". The last cool bit is you get to watch the whole Chasen's Death Row promo clip, literally history in the making. Buy this DVD for the film and the incredible features.",1244246400,,1771,4.6044303797468356
1631637,5,B00005NBDK,"I love this movie!!!! It was so shocking to see how Death Row really started and where they got the money to start the label. It gives you in depth and specific details on how the label was runned, what went down, and how it spun outta control. It doesn't portray Death Row CEO Suge Knight as a bad guy OR say he was responsible for pac's death, but gives you a look on how he helped launch Dre and Snoop's career and how he got so caught up with the money and how it corrupted him. This is a Great DVD on THE GREATEST HIP HOP LABEL and how things are handled in the hip hop industy and how power & money can corrupt and tear friendships apart. I recomend it to not only fans of Dre, Snoop,Pac, etc. but to any fan of Hip Hop. It will change the way you look and think of  Death Row Records forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1176940800,,812,4.043478260869565
1631638,5,B00005NBDK,"I've been a fan of Death Row Records since 1992, when they dropped the LEGENDARY album The Chronic by Dr. Dre, and later Snoop's LEGENDARY debut album Doggystyle. Everything was all good until situations, planned or unplanned, caused the company to spiral out of control and crumble. Due to the legal problems, Dre leaving the company, and all things related caused Death Row's unfortunate and untimely demise. Now, normally I would review what's on the DVD, so what I'll do is basically talk about how AWESOME and REAL this dvd is, as opposed to giving aways what's on the dvd. The way the rise and fall of Death Row is told here by Suge, Dre, Snoop, Nate Dogg, and others in nothing short of amazing. We start in the very beginning to when NWA was formed in the mid 80s to the end when Dre left the company. All of the information here, I knew some of it before I saw it for the first time. But the information told here that I DIDN'T know before surprised me. @ times during this film, it's SO intense that you just can't help being captivated by the content. Don't believe me? In addition to the individuals telling the story, look @ the eyes of Lydia Harris and Simone Green. As you look @ their eyes when they tell the parts of the story, you're immediately drawn into the emotions of the storytelling. Also, all of the pieces of information are blended together superbly. NO history and incident is forgotten here, and you receive everything you could possibly know about the rise and fall of Death Row Records. Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dvd to any fan, long time fans, new fans, etc. You won't regret this purchase, and like me, after the first viewing, you're going to view this dvd repeatedly. It's just that good.
LONG LIVE DEATH ROW!!!",1149724800,,1754,4.5362776025236595
1631639,5,B00005NBDK,"This is an excellent collection of interviews and stories told by all the people who were there and experienced the rise and fall of Deathrow.  If you're at all a fan, or just interested in all the hype behind Deathrow, i advise you to check out this video.  You won't be dissapointed!  Peace",1132704000,,292,4.471698113207547
1631640,5,B00005NBDK,"While I already knew quite a lot about Death Row records before buying this, I was interested in watching this documentary after reading good reviews on it.  While there are no huge revelations included here, it is a fascinating insight into the notorious hip-hop label, that was running rap music in the early to mid 90's.  Most of the main players are interviwed here, Dre, Snoop, Suge and Harry-O.  It charts their massive rise after releasing The Chronic and then Doggystyle the next year and then where it all started to go wrong, when Suge Knight started to bask in his new found fame.  Some of the accounts show exactly how ruthless Suge was, though i suspect there are even more untold stories involving him.  The seocnd half of the dvd deals mainly with Tupac, and then how Death Row completely fell apart, with Dre leaving and then Pac's death.  If you have any interest in the hip-hop industry i would urge you to buy this, the only criticisms i have are that there are no interviws with David Kenner (Death Row Lawyer) or anyone at Interscope Records like Jimmy Iovine, though im not surprised they were unavailable to comment.  An excellent documentary.",1130803200,,1166,4.714285714285714

Very cool and enjoyable alot of Surreal Stories

My Only Prob with it: Not enough Focus on Both Easy-E and 2Pac

But, still a must see flick!

1631643,4,B00005NBDK,"If you have any interest in, or even curiousity about, the music business and the rise and fall of the record label that put Rap music on the map, you will find this movie well worth watching. Its put together nicely and keeps you entertained and interested from start to finish. Well done.",1110326400,,290,4.490566037735849
1631644,5,B00005NBDK,"If you're a fan of Tupac, Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg, etc., you should watch this documentary on tha record label that made them (except Tupac). The documentary tells the story of the label from before it was even created, to its demise. It contains footage of Tupac, Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Tha Dogg Pound, and interviews with other DeathRow artists such as Jewell, RBX, Pretty Ricky, etc. It talks about the conflict between Ruthless Records and DeathRow, rooting from the problem between Eazy E, Jerry Heller, and Dr. Dre., how Dre and Harry O (Michael Harris) helped to start DeathRow, how criminal lawyer David Kenner was involved, Suge Knight, Tupac, when Dre left DeathRow, and everything else that happened with the label. It's a really interesting and informative documentary, and I strongly reccommend it to any fan of hip hop.",1107561600,,839,4.915492957746479
1631645,5,B00005NBDK,"I actually seen ""Welcome to Death Row"" 'bout I don't know 6, 7, or some times on Starz which I have on Comcast (I know ya'll don't have cable like I do) This is one of the documentaries that changed how I feel about hip-hop and how its changing right now. I think of the matter of it is is we always have to watch ourselves when we say things to people that are not right or will not changed around the nation. People need to understand there is so much going on around this world who are sacrificing to live a free life. That's why the 2 rappers of today Tupac and Biggie have changed their history of becoming most hip-hop's biggest stars. Now they're not here, they definitely live on in our hearts. This story tells it all from the day NWA came out, how Snoop Dogg got in trouble of a murder he commit in '93 but was soon acquitted of the charge in '96, how Tupac became the biggest rap star in town to help create a masterpiece like ""All Eyez On Me"" and so and on, when he a success in the rap business, the beef going on with him and Biggie at the SOURCE Awards due to the East Coast/West Coast rap feud, etc.

I highly recommend this to those who like Tupac, who loves hip-hop more than I do, who are not big fans to the rap genre and/or never even heard a rap genre like this before. 'Cause it'll change your life literally.",1102118400,,1332,4.103448275862069
1631646,5,B00005NBDK,"When I first saw this I was like ""D@#$"" at the end! I'm a big Tupac fan and when I heard all this stuff and saw all these events it had me really thinking... and that is actually what this documentary gives you.. something to think about. Everything from the NWA break up to the dreaded night of the greatest rapper of all-time (2Pac) getting shot. And the man who is tied up to all of this is Suge Knight. I love this film but there are certain thing's I don't agree on, and that's not letting Suge tell his side, it seems like the makers and producers where making Suge look like a bad bad guy, but sometimes I wonder if they made him look bad or he's made himself look that way, but this is a very nice film, my blood rushes when I hear 2Pac giving that interview at the MTV music awards dissing Nas, and Bad Boy!!! A+++++, BRAVO!!!",1098748800,,835,4.128834355828221
1631647,5,B00005NBDK,"The ""Welcome To Death Row"" documentary is great for anyone who has ever wanted to know more about the history of one of the most successful labels in rap music. Included are many interviews and personal thoughts of many of the key players who are, or were, working with Death Row Records. Areas explored include the creation of Death Row Records, legal problems within the company, Suge Knight's behavior, Tupac's arrival and his relationship with the Notorious BIG, Dr. Dre's departure, the ""East Coast,West Coast"" rivalry, and Tupac's murder. This DVD is a great buy for anyone interested in this subject.",1089072000,,607,5.01980198019802
1631648,5,B00005NBDK,"Leigh Savidge takes a very insightful look at the controversial Death Row Records as well as the music industry as a whole. With never-before-seen footage and comments from several former artists on Death Row as well as many music industry insiders, ""Welcome To Death Row"" tries its best and succeeds quite well at piecing together all of the shocking details about what really went down behind close doors at Death Row.
""Welcome"" chronicles all of the major moments in the Death Row saga from its inception when Suge used questionable tactics to get Dr. Dre out of his contract with Eazy-E's Ruthless Records to its downfall following Knight's incarceration. It talks about all the politics and jealousy behind the scenes and details Knight and Death Row's involvment in the infamous East-West battle. It also showcases how producer/artist Dr. Dre helped build the company, only to be pushed to the side when Knight signed Tupac Shakur in 1996 and how Dre eventually chose to leave the multi-million dollar company that he had helped build with Suge.
While Suge has been very vocal in his disdain for this documentary, it should be noted that it does not focuss its entire energy on attacking the label boss. While there are some unflattering stories about him told by former employees, there are a number of people who praise him for being a creative genius and a very successful businessman. However, there are also a number of people including imprisoned former crime boss, Michael ""Harry-O"" Harris, who claim that they helped fund Death Row with drug money. Harris goes into detail about a number of violent incidents involving Suge and how he believes that the success transformed Knight into a different person. Vibe columnist, Kevin Powell, brings a lot to the table as well in his interviews as he provides a lot of insight into the careers of many of the Death Row artists. Snoop Dogg, one of Death Row's most popular artists, also provides some intriuging commentary as he explains what really went on at ""Tha Row"".
Even if you are only a casual fan of rap music, you should find a lot to like about this very well-made documentary. While some Death Row fans might be upset that it doesn't say much of anything about popular artists like Kurupt, Daz, DJ Quik, or The Outlawz, it really isn't trying to be an artist profile. It also does not feature any music by Death Row because the label wanted nothing to do with its release. Regardless, this is without question, one of the most informative documentaries ever made on the subject of Death Row Records.",1082851200,,2566,4.820861678004535
1631649,4,B00005NBDK,"this really is a well presented documentary on a controversial subject.the makers of this mustve had pretty thick skins to go and get interviews off of everyone they did,and present it the way they did.it certainly doesnt pull any punches about suge anyway.i really did learn a lot about death rows beginnings from this,and the mysterious harry o who helped bankroll death row originally.and thankfully,2pac is portrayed in the way he should be,and it goes some way to show how he changed from a political rapper to ""thug life"" rapper.a lot of this stuff you will know already,but a lot of it you wont.presented in first person narritive its consise and to the point.a few down points though,i got the feeling some of the interviewees were reading what they were saying off of idiot boards the producer had written.and you could tell dr dre didn't really want to talk about it much,he was trying to suck right up to suge on this.still,at least he wasn't wearing makeup,or was he?and snoops camp voice spouting a load of nonsense didn't help much either.but these are small points,the film is excellent.and the dvd extras make this an even better purchase.footage of 2pac suge and co leaving the boxing fight shortly before 2pacs murder is fascinating.i wonder what that guy whispered into his ear?probably,""you've only got one haven't you,one of them was shot out"".or maybe not.also,theres footage of death rows opening party,and a rubbish commentry.then again,ive yet to hear a good commentry.all in a great purchase,good value for money,and very entertaining.i definately suggest you buy it!!!! 4 out of 5.",1074211200,,1608,5.048872180451128

It also looks into the murder of Tupac Shakur and how he MADE Death Row Records. The only bad thing about this DVD is that Ruthless Records & Death Row Records refused to give music rights in the making of this documentary. This DVD is one of the best I've seen with 2Pac in it. It also has extended interviews, out-takes and if your looking for a DVD to keep you interested..this is the one. Even if you know nothing about Death Row you are going to love this one!

1631651,5,B00005NBDK,"Although not being the big rap fan I once was in high school, I have always been fascinated by Death Row Records and all of the controversy that surrounded the notorious record label since day one.  ""Welcome to Death Row"" is a thought-provoking documentary that tells the story of how a dangerous and popular record label changed the music industry, and how it all came falling apart.  The documentary is filmed with new interviews with Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and other former Death Row artists, as well as interviews with big names in both the music and media industry.  They tell their side of the story and reveal just what exactly went on while working for Death Row.
I found this documentary to be extremely fascinating and well-done.  It seems to stick with the facts for the most part, instead of reverting to a bunch of conspiracy theories.  There's enough respected people who appeared on the film, which makes it easier to believe.  While it answers some questions, it doesn't answer all of them.  We still to this day do not know who shot Tupac and for what reason.  And although it reveals most of what went on at Death Row, I am sure there are more untold stories that have yet to see the light of day.
The DVD is really impressive for a documentary.  It's shot in widescreen, which is something I wasn't expecting.  The picture and sound quality is really good.  The extra features are also very impressive and make their presence felt.  Some of the features are extensive interview outtakes, commentary from the filmmaker, the trailer, and more.
""Welcome to Death Row"" is an intriguing and interesting documentary.  Filled with things we had known all along and things we never knew, this is a documentary worth watching over and over again.  You don't even have to be a big rap fan to enjoy it.  If you know enough about the record label's history and you are a music fan, I think you'll really find this all interesting.  Very well worth the money and very well worth the time.",1043798400,,1992,4.6164772727272725

For folks who wanna learn about the rap game I recommend this video as a classroom and watch closely how suge rose to the top and then fell off and how interscope took his money and ran and left him in jail for 5 years don't expect no videos this is exclusive interviews and tells an important part of rap history and also features c delores tucker who ran campaigns against rap boy was she fake she didn't care much for woman's rights ther truth was she wanted money and shows how when you come up everybody start looking at you like you have [lots of money] when there was plenty of rappers outside deathrow using profanity.",1041724800,,839,4.454545454545454
1631653,5,B00005NBDK,This documentary surprised me. At first I saw it because I am a rap fan especially of the old Death Row. I was blown away by the style and production of this movie. Two huge things make this documentary worth wild. First off the film is completely impartial. You just get the facts and opinions of those directly involved and few from those outside. The other factor is that other people who aren't rap fans will find this interesting. After my viewing I showed this to many friends and all were deeply interested despite any real interest in rap music. Great topic because of it's controversy and it's impact over the nation. If you give it an honest shot you'll find it interesting and very well done.,1033603200,,703,4.543307086614173

Therefore, the only known song played in this film is ""Deep Cover"" by Dre and Snoop. This documentary is still outstanding but I would've surely given it 5 stars if we heard some of many amazing tracks done by the artists of Death Row.
By the way, it was Death Row who wouldn't allow any their tracks to be featured on this film.....Suge Knight....hahahaha.",1011830400,,603,4.69811320754717

1631659,5,B00005NBDK,"For me, this film raised a lot of interesting questions -- like for one, in the wake of the damaging press on Death Row's alleged ""drug money"" funding, why hadn't Interscope heads Jimmy Iovine or Ted Fields ever been questioned? When Death Row received all the bad press during the East Coast/West Coast feud, or when stories of Death Row's alleged brutality in their studios came to light, how and why did Jimmy Iovine and Ted Fields come away unscathed, with not so much as one speculative article? These two guys literally owe their fortunes (about $400 million from Death Row) to Suge Knight and the rest of Death Row records, who only saw about half as much. Interscope Records was going out of business -- the Chronic album saved it...
I have never witnessed interviews as candid and intriguing as these, and from such a wide variety of (as far as I can tell) credible sources. For me, the value of this documentary isn't so much in the slandering of anyone's name. Rather, ""Welcome To Death Row"" provides extremely valuable lessons on the pitfalls of show BUSINESS, because it is a business (Jerry Heller, David Kenner, Ted Fields, and Jimmy Iovine never forgot that!). Snoop Dogg has over 10 minutes of an interview where he discusses his very beginnings. We get to hear from a man named Michael Harris, and I'll leave that at that. Folks at S.O.L.A.R. records, (where Babyface got his start), early Nate Dogg, D.O.C., Death Row's launch party, it's all here. My man Kevin Powell (the only journalist to ever really get close to the late Tupac Shakur) also adds some great insights. Right now you are reading the words of a highly impressed reviewer.
Your viewing experience of this film will not be complete without the DVD extras. If you don't have a DVD player, buy a DVD player; Snoop's solo interview (DVD only) is by far one of the best segments on here. Also look out for clips of the Death Row launch party in Beverly Hills, and outtakes (featuring great footage) of the various sources interviewed. I cannot say enough about this film. ""Welcome To Death Row"" is not a music video -- it wasn't made to ""entertain"" anyone. If you're serious about the URBAN music industry, then this is required viewing...",1004745600,,2220,4.694871794871795

1631661,4,B00005NBDK,"This video is worth getting if you're a fan of the old Death Row. There is so much information and details about the rise and the fall of Death Row. It was interesting to see how Suge Knight went from being a regular bodyguard to being one of the music's worlds must notable names. The DVD traces Suge's history from being Bobby Brown's bodyguard to the infamous Vanilla Ice scandal. Not a single detail is missed on this DVD. There are also additional features aside from the Documentary, including an indepth Snoop Dogg interview. If you are interested in the deep history of Death Row, buy this DVD. If you're not a huge old school Death Row fan, it may be a little dull.",1001808000,,674,4.443548387096774
1631662,3,B00005NBDK,"Every damn Death Row documentary focuses on the same sh_t.  Come on, tell me about the early days and how DPG came to be.  Tell me how Daz met Kurupt, and how Dre signed all of them.  There was only 10 basic members to the first Death Row family.  And here they go again focusing on Suge (boring story heard a million times) and Dre leaving.  No talk about DPG & Outlawz???  Barely anything interesting on Makaveli & Snoop*.  Same East vs. West sh_t we been hearin'.  Tell me about how Makaveli created these masterpieces, not what he thought of Biggie.  I know that sh_t, its old.  Snoop* - there was a side interview in the special features that had Snoop talking about Daz, D.O.C., Above The Law.  Stuff I never knew, but it wasn't even in the main feature.  That is the reason why I gave it 3 stars.  Rent, don't buy it.  Go buy some DPG albums instead.",1001548800,,857,4.275
