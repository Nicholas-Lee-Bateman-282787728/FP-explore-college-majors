8140738,5,B000HP03XM,"This is an excellent dvd, the moves are explained and he shows you how to do them clearly. He takes you step by step with foot and then hand movement and puts them all together. I am a beginner and I grasped most of it first go around. After he teaches the step he goes over it a couple of times, and then at the end he does the whole routine. I bought the dvd  to learn so I could teach my kids, but adults will love as well! I also bought the book and the cd, but I haven't even cracked it open yet. I'm waiting on the next dvd!",1168214400,2,530,3.774774774774775
