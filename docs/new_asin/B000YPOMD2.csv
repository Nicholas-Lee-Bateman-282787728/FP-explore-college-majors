8233678,1,B000YPOMD2,"I believe that the owner of the DVD should place the word, ""SEMINAR"" on the front & back of the DVD case. The reasoning is that the DVD is a video of a seminar that was held in a hotel conference room.  The powerpoint slides should have been presented in a better format because the video screen is being videoed & the powerpoint slides cannot be read properly. There aren't any details that show a concrete methodology to predicting & profiting in the market cycle. I expected an educational, so that I can use the standards for profitting in the stock market.",1278288000,4,561,4.5
