8130273,2,B000GB7ZCE,"This DVD contains a good message but unfortunately is very short and leaves much to be wanted. I was looking for videos of the songs from the Revolution CD, but I didn't find that. Although some of the songs are included in the brief video, not all of them are. In the future I hope Inhabited will think to make a better DVD to better express their music.

If you are going to watch this DVD, make sure you first listen to the Revolution CD. That is one awesome CD that I recommend to all rock music lovers who like to get inspiration from the music they listen to!",1151107200,,565,4.18348623853211
