8289658,5,B001CU9BUW,"H2 is repeating the docu-drama ""Roman Vice"", a film that mines the depths of depravity of the Roman Empire as it begins to collapse. Sex with men and boys, women and girls, castration, executions, incest, murder, assassination, all topics that used to be hinted at in some adult oriented histories. Now they are explained in some depth, using contemporary writings, ancient sites, and video of sculptures, frescoes, and mosaics.

Does the beginning of the end of the Roman civilization involve these times and acts? The implication is that our current environment of depraved acts are marking the beginning of the end of the American civilization.

If you have been intrigued by stories of the Roman sex, baths, erotica, and slavery, here is a good description of all.",1345939200,,768,5.039370078740157
8289659,5,B001CU9BUW,"This is a real wake-up on how far a culture, unchecked, can go.  Young boys are forced into sex slavery, as are young women.  Their existence is to satisfy the unsatisfiable desires of the depraved and degenerate leaders in power in that day and culture.  These are the same people that could look on and be entertained by lions who would tear limb from limb another human being.  It's a stark reminder to always think about what we view as entertainment.  This film is powerful.  Why is it no longer available on the History Channel?",1309392000,,534,4.568421052631579
