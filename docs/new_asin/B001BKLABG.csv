The endangered birds are very graceful in flight for their size. Chris meets a woman that is a sailplane glider pilot attempting to win a distance award, and he takes up sailplane lessons from an instructor (Fred Harris). Eventually Chris can soar with his condors.

BEHIND THE SCENES AND TRIVIA:  The story is an episode of the Walt Disney World of Color television show.  The episode was produced by James Algar. The script by Homer McCoy is based on a story by Ken Nelson, who also served as a field producer and photographer of condors for the project.

Originally aired on television on NBC's Wonderful World of Color on February 19, 1967 and re-aired on May 28 of that year, and again on April 15, 1973. Sailplanes were also used in another television episode called ""The Sky Trap"".",1219622400,10,973,4.733727810650888

8283402,5,B001BKLABG,"I lived in Tehachapi and remember watching the shooing of this movie. I knew Chris Jury (young pilot) and his instructor (Fred Harris) very well.  They both incoraged me to fly, and both took me under their wing.  I later bought the flight school from Fred at age 20, and sold out and went into corporate flying as I am still doing that for a world know celebrity. I have purchased 6 of there DVDs for old friends that remembered this awesome movie.",1494633600,,449,4.397590361445783

8283405,4,B001BKLABG,"Even though it's almost 50 years old, it's still a good story and a good way to interest kids in flying gliders.  The writers took some liberties with their script; such as putting condors on the eastern slope of the Sierras, and calling a 1-26 a ""high performance sailplane.""  However it is still very much worth seeing.",1400803200,,321,4.614035087719298
8283406,5,B001BKLABG,"Great Movie, this movie got me started in soaring. I saw it on TV back when it first aired. I'm now a commercial rated sailplane pilot.
Even though its way outdated it still has some great flying scenes and includes Fred Harris, a pioneer sailplane operator I had the pleasure to fly with those many years ago.",1399593600,,310,4.456140350877193
8283407,5,B001BKLABG,"This Disney film was primarily the product of Ken Nelson Productions, under contract to Disney. My lifetime best friend, Ken Nelson, wrote the story, hired the local kids as actors, and, I believe, did all the cinematography, in the air and on the ground. My wife and I flew into the airport at Tehachapi to spend a weekend with Ken and his wife when they were staying there during the filming. Ken and I learned to fly in high school when we were in the Civil Air Patrol Cadets. Soaring popularity increased substantially after the release of this film. Ken made several films for the Disney ""World of..."" series, including films about sea turtles, river otters, storms, and a hurricane, and participated in filming ""The Great Whales"" for National Geographic. Previously, he had filmed some of the ""Danger is my Business"" TV series. Later he specialized in educational films. Ken died in 1998 after completing ""Voyage of the Manatee,"" about a young handicapped girl and a sailboat.",1362268800,5,982,4.88622754491018
8283408,5,B001BKLABG,"When I saw this way back in the 60's, I fell in love with flying, which lead me to want to learn to fly sail planes. Which I did. Every pilot should see this, dated but fun and there are so few flying movies..",1360886400,,209,3.772727272727273

8283410,3,B001BKLABG,"Like a lot of folks I remember the Walt Diney sunday evening family TV shows from my childhood. I was looking for a video to show the basic idea of what is involved in flying a sailplane, for my daughter. The video is a clip from the old show. It is dated as it is from a simpler time , but I enjoyed it and it does tell how a teeenage boy learns about gliders/sailplanes. Todays teenagers may turn up their noses but I was looking for my mom to bring me a grilled cheese and soup like when I was a kid! I am a pilot and the video was very technically correct. I would recommend it.",1231286400,7,582,3.940677966101695
