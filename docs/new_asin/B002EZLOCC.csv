3920600,1,B002EZLOCC,I couldn't believe what a waste of time this movie was. I love B movies but this one was beyond bad in my opinion.,1251849600,9,114,3.7916666666666665
3920601,5,B002EZLOCC,"I really enjoyed this movie. It has a great story line and all the action and suspense you could ever want in a horror thriller: Beautiful girls, violence, gore, dark secrets, and weird, sadistic characters. It's a must see, you won't be disappointed.",1247529600,2,251,4.8604651162790695
3920602,5,B002EZLOCC,"Fantastic ! Refreshing to see a small budget film have a final product able to take on the best. The film is all things horror, girls gore and a terrifing story with a greater lingering fear due to the ability to imagine this small town of kidnaping, murdering family members on a quest for family prosperity at the peril of others.",1247356800,3,332,4.459016393442623
3920603,5,B002EZLOCC,"Abduction is scary, campy and a little bit gory.  It's just a good film to kick back and enjoy.  For an independent film the quality is really high and so is the acting.

Five Stars!",1247011200,4,182,4.142857142857143
3920604,5,B002EZLOCC,"I love low budget films and being a follower of previous Orrichio films, this one is without a doubt on the forefront of his directing career. There is a little more gore (not overly done) then in his past films and more pretty ladies highlighted in the movies - Unlike other movies that are disappointing with a covers that have nothing to do with the movie - this one delivers from start to finish. With scantily clad women, an original story line (not just the same one person running around slasher)I would highly rate this film for any horror genre based fans.",1246924800,5,565,4.549019607843137
3920605,5,B002EZLOCC,"This movie has everything I was looking for: suspense, gore and beautiful woman. The storyline develops nicely and keeps you guessing. Well shot and directed too.",1246233600,9,162,5.269230769230769
3920606,4,B002EZLOCC,"Beautiful women are kidnapped and sold into slavery, they have their organs removed or are impregnated so that the babies can be sold on the black market...is this some foreign country?  Nope, it's New Jersey...

Abduction is a funny (and often-times scary) look at what happens when a small town bands together for the common good, even if their intent is evil.  It's low-budget and sometimes campy, but it's very entertaining and a great way to spend a weekend evening, curled up on the couch with a bowl of popcorn.",1246060800,18,518,4.733333333333333
3920607,4,B002EZLOCC,"A low budget film, to be sure, but as indie horror films go, it's a blast!

Funny, over-the-top acting + a lot of nudity and gore = the perfect Saturday night movie.  Check it out!",1246060800,16,180,4.114285714285714
3920629,1,B002EZLOCC,"Don't know what to think of all these mixed reviews? Well, before you spend one dime on this do yourself a favor and watch the ""trailer"" for it over on IMDB. Trust me, that will answer ALL of your questions.",1270771200,2,207,4.2
3920630,4,B002EZLOCC,"First, I live in Lansing, Mi. and have no affiliation or friendship with the movie's producers.  I found this to be an entertaining low budget film. However you need to enjoy low budget films and their limitations to like this or most any movie like this.  The story was creepy and the acting was about average for this caliber of film.  There were some attractive girls and some s/m type action. The film also contained some exploitation aspects for shock value. The ending was good. So my advice is to watch this if you enjoy ultra low budget movies and this type of subject matter.",1270166400,4,584,4.542857142857143
3920631,3,B002EZLOCC,"While this is yet another movie I own about people disappearing in New Jersey, it's nothing like Nothing But Trouble. This is not a wonderful comedy with a roller coaster of death, this is some kind of bizarre misogynistic bondage and psychological horror movie. It's pretty well made in terms of camera work, acting, etc. And it makes me uncomfortable to watch it. The treatment of women is horrific. They're just beautiful bodies for impregnating or organ harvesting. Men too, but not as much. The problem is that the abuse isn't portrayed stylistically. This movie portrays the abuse in a clinical realistic way. In the movie A Boy And His Dog, they strap the man down to harvest his sperm to impregnate women and its hilarious. In this movie, they kidnap men and kidnap women and they force to have sex with tasers, and they kill people who refuse to have sex or fail to achieve pregnancy by wrapping their heads in plastic and making them suffocate to death.

On the plus side, it has lots of nudity. On the down side: it's absolutely horrifying and patently offensive.",1268956800,23,1074,4.712765957446808
3920632,3,B002EZLOCC,I'VE READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS. BEAUTIFUL WOMEN (WHERE?) ACTING DONE POORLY BUT IT IS HILARIOUS. OF COURSE WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM A MOVIE MADE FOR ABOUT $2.00. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN A 'B' MOVIE HAD SOME REDEEMING QUALITIES BUT THIS ONE HAD NO PLOT NO GOOD GORE JUST ALOT OF NAKED WOMEN WITH HOODS ON AND THE FEW THAT THEY SHOWED FACES OF WERE WELL LET'S JUST BE KIND HERE ODD SHAPED AND NOT REAL CUTE. IF YOU CAN TAKE 1HR 18MIN WITHOUT THE FAST FOWARD BUTTON YOU HAVE DONE BETTER THAN ME. THE ONLY REGRET I HAVE IS THAT I ACTUALLY PAID FOR THIS MOVIE,1257206400,7,551,4.064220183486238
3920633,5,B002EZLOCC,"I like the movie,the girls were hot, sorry the actress with in this movie are hot. when they said that this movie was film in NJ, i did a little research for myself and this movie was filmed in New Jersey. I am not going to lie to you there was one ugly woman in the movie and she did scare me. You be the judge of how beautiful the actress are you can find them at this web site [...]
all in all the movie was good.",1255910400,4,416,3.7386363636363638
3920634,1,B002EZLOCC,Talk about a waste of time. This piece of trash DVD is also a waste of the plastic used to make it. The Plastic used in the manufacture of this DVD would be better used if it were the plastic in a suppository applicator. In other words....stick it up your a$$...or someones a$$....because this DVD is a total piece of $h! t. It got one star only because there isn't a lower mark.,1254355200,8,379,4.205479452054795

Have not received it yet...but, I have watched clips on myspace.  This is shot on video.  (need I say more).  I am sure it is a movie that I may only watch once.  I enjoy ""different"" films.  I feel that the low, low production values ""suck"".

8368538,4,B002EZLOCC,"This is an unapologetic exploitation film with better than average cinematography.  The acting abilities of the talent varies from very poor to very strong.

It tells fascinating story of a small uncharted Jersey town that is run by a crime family who are in the ""meat"" business. Think about how bovine cattle is managed from a business perspective.  Nothing goes to waste. Cattle for food, clothing, etc. Nothing goes to waste.  It's a similar process in this film except it's people instead of cows. People (most notably young women) are exploited in ways of human trafficking, organ transplants, soaps, wallets. Nothing is wasted. It seems implausible, but nonetheless very fascinating.  I dare speculate that operations like this do flourish in other parts of the world but unlikely in the U.S.

This movie ain't for the politically correct, or those who can only tolerate slick Hollywood productions. Fans of Exploitation / Sleaze, Intellectuals, and the open minded May find this movie enjoyable, or at least interesting.

I found the movie to be somewhat flawed, but Very Enjoyable.",1504915200,,1089,5.153409090909091

8368543,1,B002EZLOCC,"<strong>Abduction</strong> (John Orrichio, 2009)

What continually amazed me, while I was watching the horrific <em>Abduction</em>, was that Alice and Carmine Orrichio, whom I assume are related to John Orrichio in some way (mom and dad? sister and brother-in-law?), were listed as producers on this film. What were they thinking? One would assume that Alice, at least, would have had some trouble with the storyline, which is misogynist in the extreme; this plotless mess of a movie exists for the sole purpose of showing non-consensual sex and the occasional gore scene, with a streak of not-too-well-buried racism a mile wide running straight down the middle. It's offensive in every possible way. And yet some of Orrichio's relatives were not only willing to bankroll it, but feed the cast and crew (Alice is also listed as the film's caterer). One can't help but wonder why there wasn't arsenic in the chicken salad sandwiches.

What little plot there is: Process, NJ, is a small town in the middle of pretty much nowhere whose economy is based on selling illegally-harvested organs, breeding babies for adoption, and selling sex slaves to rich overseas businessmen. (We are told early on that the development of the Internet has greatly facilitated their cashflow. Haw haw haw.) Needless to say, these things don't happen in a vacuum, so the town's bed and breakfast is a black hole from which overnight guests never emerge; men end up as organ donators, while women are either tortured into submission as sex slaves or consigned to the breeding farm, where the local studs (who are on the town payroll, of course) work night and day to impregnate them. All well and good, at least by Process standards, until they recognize there's a rise in demand for mixed-race babies. Coincidentally, Bella, a Brazilian pop star (Omaida Aponte) and Donny, her African-American bodyguard (S. Freddor), stop in town. After the usual struggle-knockout gas routine, she is sent to the breeding shed, while he is offered a stud position. He's less than impressed with the setup, but when his best friend Sam (<em>In Her Shoes</em>' Dan Rush) comes looking for them and ends up on the town payroll, Donny is convinced by Sam's suddenly-flush bank account, flashy new car, etc. Things start getting ugly when Donny realizes one of the girls he's required to service is Bella, and he tries to find a way to get both of them out of there, assisted by the one guy in town who also seems less than thrilled with the setup--the doctor who concocts the drugs used to keep the breeders sedated (Gerry Kirschbaum).

Simply put: one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the script is worthless, the camerawork is amateur. Even the soundtrack is risible, though it's by far the best thing about the movie. Perhaps the one thing Orrichio actually researched was Brazilian pop? ",1325116800,,2876,4.960580912863071
8368544,2,B002EZLOCC,"The town of Process is where people come to relax. No phones, no television, no all-night gas stations and drug stores. Just lots of people, driving through. And in Process, that means cash. Not from tourism, from bodies.

The people of Process are all in the skin trade, and the business is quite diversified. Sex slaves, babies for sale, leather goods, organs for transplant--everyone has something that Process wants.

At a resort in town, a woman who has just broken up with her boyfriend is sitting next to the pool. Another woman commisserates with her until her back is turned, then hits her with a stun gun. When we see her again, there are beautiful women in cages all around. She's a difficult case; she hasn't become pregnant, so no babies to sell, she has tattoos, which makes her less desirable for leather work. They may just have to cut her up for parts.

So goes life in Process. The movie plays and looks like a soft core soap opera, with a screwy score that highlights the absurdity of Abduction rather than the horror. We never get under the skin of any of the victims or villains. In the town of Process, all relationships are superficial, and our relationships with the characters equally so.

About 2/3 of the way through Abduction, there is an attempt at a plot arc; one of the studs recognizes one of the women to be impregnated as an old girlfriend. Brought to his senses, at least momentarily, he tries to help her get out of town. And there are other fighters who make life difficult for the citizens of Process, but these brief rebellions seem to go nowhere. And the fact that so many people go missing in Process and yet there is never any police investigation adds to the improbability of the plot.

With a terrible score, an improbable script, and a complete lack of pacing, Abduction is too flawed to be enjoyable",1293062400,3,1845,4.595744680851064
8368545,1,B002EZLOCC,"So bad it may be worth a look.
This movie is just a big pile of T and A nothing more. To get the actresses the talent scout must have went straight down to the sleaziest strip club he could find and picked out the girls who could give the best lap dances. Nothing about this looks real the lead actress Bella the ""good-looking tourist"" looks like one of those trannies that should have stayed a man, please go back to the club and stay off film. If you can make it all the way through this work of art you are doing way more then most people would do. I started watching and my jaw dropped in amazement at how poor this is. Pure junk, poor story, bad acting, shoddy sound track and some really poor sets make this a real stinker so bad you may want to see it to believe it.",1292284800,2,773,4.025974025974026
8368546,5,B002EZLOCC,"*SPOILERS* I bought this film from Amazon a while ago and I really liked it! I've read some really positive reviews and some negative ones as well, but being an indie film fan and a fan of previous John Orrichio films - I bought Abduction. The camera-work is his best yet with beautiful outdoor shots and disturbing lighting and effects that show how the town is twisted behind closed doors, but picturesque and normal to the outside world.

It's the story of a remote New Jersey small town that is not on any map. Basically the townsfolk kidnap unsuspecting tourists and sell them into slavery, harvest their organs for sale on the black market or make leather goods out of them! Everything starts to unravel when an up & coming pop star from South America is kidnapped and her bodyguards come to town to find her. The whole town is in on the secret. The story is original and plays out well. The first 10 minutes are a little slow, but it picks up nicely from there.

As for the acting, Tony Rugnetta (Jacob) is excellent. His best role to date. Roberto Lombardi (Johnny) is perfect, convincingly evil & sexy at the same time! Christy Callas (Lilly) who is both vulnerable & sinister and Gerry Kirschbaum (Doc) who has the cool demeanor of a Doctor with a hidden mania. Other notable performances are Deana Demko (Rosie) and Christina Sampson (Myrtle). There is rarely a stumble by any of the actors.

I also think that to truly enjoy this film you have to take it for what it is. A very low budget, well made shock / thriller that is a little creepy, a little campy/funny and a little bloody. It's not a horror film per se and it's not for everyone. If you want the thrills of a ""Saw"" movie, pass on this. If you like movies that are more horrifying in content than horror (like Rosemary's Baby), this is right up your alley.

The film has gotten bashed, but I believe that is coming from former colleagues of the film maker who are bitter or by people who don't understand what the movie was intended to be.

Judge for yourself, but actually watch the film, give examples of scenes and write a proper review - good or bad!!",1273622400,4,2127,4.4575835475578405
