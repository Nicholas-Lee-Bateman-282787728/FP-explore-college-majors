Sad to see, only 2 reviews on this? this, dare I say, masterpiece?

You get 12 films (just her dancing in lingerie. but damn, each is fantastic!) I think the 12 films range in an hour's worth of time. with the bonus adding a little more to it? Even though all 12 are just her dancing, basically, it is still very entertaining to watch. And I am not someone who is easily amused. The 60 minutes went by so quickly. 8:30 one minute, ""wonder what time is it- 9:30?! *flips back to film- *over*""

Bettie Page just has the talent to make each dance fun to watch. Adding very little, but still keeping our jaws dropped, and toes a'tappin'! Its as if she's dancing just for us. You do really get sucked into it. So hypnotizing.

then 4 bonus films (making this set come to the 16 in all)

Another reviewer dismissed nudity in this.

That is partially wrong. There is a film on this (one of the bonus) in which Page is topless. but only topless.

Which is still fantastic. and, in color? 15 of them I think are all in black and white, but the topless one seems to be somewhat in color. Her bow/ribbon(?) in hair just kinda is too bright for black and white (i think it's pink). perhaps its sepia tone with some rose-tint. i do know one thing, certainly doesn't look just plain black and white. though, not fully colored, either. view for yourself for a final verdict.

I find the 12 main short-films to just be of Bettie Page happy, and innocently playing around, dancing. Very comforting, and arousing.

the bonus stuff I feel is a bit more sensual.

She is still playful and fun Bettie Page, but bringing out a more sensual side in each of the bonus short-films.

For those of you wondering just what your getting with this DVD set, I'll list the following short films in it-

- RETURN OF TEASER GIRL

- BETTY'S CLOWN DANCE, PART ONE (although the front cover lists her as Bettie Page, the films remove the ""IE"" with a ""Y"")

- BETTY'S CLOWN DANCE, PART TWO (her playing around with a little clown doll in both parts. fun stuff)

- FLIRTATIOUS DANCE BY BETTY

- PEPPY GRACEFUL DANCE

- BETTY WALTZING IN SATIN SCANTIES

- BETTY HIGH HEEL DANCE

- TAMBOURINE DANCE

- JOYFUL DANCE BY BETTY

- BETTY'S HAT DANCE

- DREAM DANCE BY BETTY

- BETTY'S LINGERIE TEASE DANCE, PART TWO (no part one before it. Though I am sure one of the films up above is part one to it. I really have no clue, though. Need to watch this again!)

BONUS FILMS-

- BETTY PAGE NUDE (topless. her chest is never right in front of the camera, but more at an angle. Which is still great. You see most all of her right breast, as well as leftie hanging around loosely behind it. you want full-frontal nudity, theres always the books.)

- BETTY PAGE IN BLACK LINGERIE

- BETTY PAGE IN WHITE LINGERIE

- BETTY PAGE IN RED LINGERIE

Oh, and all films seem to be in great quality. Not once did I have trouble trying to figure out what the hell was going on. Pretty clear picture, despite them being over 50 years old. Certainly isn't picture perfect, some grain throughout. but not too much to make it unwatchable. each film is also well-lit, never darkened and hard to follow.

Imagine an old '50s short film the best it could possibly be- this is what it is. i am not a quality buff, but all films seem to be in the best shape they can be.

also, the DVD case is much better than I had hoped for. Looking at the front-cover image online, its the same as the DVD you'll recieve. yet, looks so much more well-polished. the stuff on the back of the dvd is also a fine sight.

Overall, I find this DVD to be worth the 5, 10, 15, 20 bucks. Well worth it.

If you admire her beauty- get it. If you admire her playfulness- get it. If you need some comfort- get it. if you need a bit of arousal, but nothing trashy- get it. for pin-up collection, for Bettie Page collection- get it.

R.I.P Bettie Page, your the best!",1267574400,25,3906,4.283765347885402
8142303,4,B000HXDWUA,"I bought this DVD to add to my film collection.  I had the opportunity to see REAL burlesque at the ""Follies"" off Mission Street in San Francisco when I was a young man.  I also have a ""Pin Up"" model collection and Betty Page was one of my favorites.  The films have been restored and are fun to watch. No nudity so if you are looking for a ""Porn Flick"" then this is not what you want!  If you are a Betty Page Buff a Pin Up fan or love history then this is a great addition to any collection.",1265328000,7,493,3.9
