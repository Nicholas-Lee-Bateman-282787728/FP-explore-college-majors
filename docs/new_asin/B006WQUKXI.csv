5026171,4,B006WQUKXI,I really like James Cagney. I read mixed reviews about this movie and was a bit hesitant at first to buy it so I waited for awhile before I purchased. My wife and I were glad I bought it. We were not disappointed at all with the movie. If you like Cagney and his other movies you will not be disappointed with this one.,1388620800,,319,4.0
5026172,3,B006WQUKXI,"This film starts out rather implausibly. Sailor Bat Morgan (James Cagney) wanders into a Barbary Coast saloon and almost gets shanghaied by a trio dedicated to that business. He does manage to escape and is helped by a kindly Jewish tailor (George E. Stone as Sully Green). What's rather implausible is that Sully basically has to teach a sailor that has docked in the port of San Francisco what shanghaiing is and that the Barbary Coast is dangerous. Really? A seasoned sailor docking in San Francisco has never heard of the Barbary Coast or shanghaiing or why it is profitable for criminals? You'd think Bat Morgan was a common tourist from the Midwest with a defective GPS. What happens next was a little off-putting for a Cagney fan like myself. Naturally, Cagney's character decides to go back to the bar and teach those three thugs a lesson. How he did it left a bad taste in my mouth. Bat shanghais the shanghai-er as he is getting ready to take yet another unconscious victim to a ship. But he also shanghais the poor unconscious slob that was just a victim like he had been a couple of hours ago! Now I'm prepared to see Cagney's character rough up and victimize fellow bad guys in a film, but he usually shied away from making victims of innocent bystanders.

At this point the film makes a distinctive turn from where it's been going the first 15 or 20 minutes and becomes less surprising and more of a conventional action picture. Bat Morgan - who never goes back to his ship - begins to make his fortune on the Barbary Coast by more conventional methods. At first he works for Barbary Coast saloon proprietor Paul Morra (Ricardo Cortez), then he works his way up by enlarging the take of corrupt San Francisco officials, and uses his part of the pot to build an upscale establishment on the Barbary Coast himself.

Meanwhile, the beautiful owner of a newspaper dedicated to wiping out corruption (Margaret Lindsay as Jean) enlists an editor to help her in her goal of cleaning up The Coast and outing the corrupt officials that protect it. Donald Woods plays the honest editor she hired who never has a chance with Jean once Cagney's Bat Morgan gets a look at her and starts batting his baby blues. So here you have a corrupt guy and a beautiful classy girl dedicated to wiping out corruption falling in love. Rather predictable complications ensue.

High points of this production are, most obviously James Cagney, George E. Stone in an endearing role as Cagney's mild mannered and loyal friend the tailor, and Fred Kohler in a minor role as the aptly named Shanghai Duck who looks like he hasn't bathed in a month of Sundays. Ricardo Cortez gives an overly restrained performance as Barbary Coast big shot Paul Morra, and Lili Damata is wasted here as his wife. Unexpected is the viewpoint that a mob on horseback is lawlessness, but a mob sitting down in a large room is an acceptable form of government, and that common criminals going to the opera is an unspeakable breach of etiquette. Watch the film to see what I'm talking about.

This one is a take-it-or-leave-it proposition, largely made so because studios had to turn to period pieces like this one immediately after the production code took effect in order to blunt the interference from the censors without really knowing what to do with the material.

As for the DVD quality - Warners did absolutely no restoration on this one. It shows the signs of being a straight DVD/VHS transfer in fact. Odd that a Cagney film would get the no frills treatment and 1930's Bright Lights with an almost anonymous cast looks like it got a brand new transfer!",1368230400,,3622,4.661971830985915
5026173,5,B006WQUKXI,"James Cagney was hism usual self. I purchased this for Margaret Lindsay, and she didn't disappoint. Good, good movie for all us old folks.",1359936000,2,138,4.791666666666667
5026174,5,B006WQUKXI,"I've been looking for this DVD for years.  It's one of my favorite James Cagney movies.  It's a great narrative about life on the Barbary Coast, and shows the life styles of the City Fathers attempt to clean up the Coast.",1356220800,3,221,4.365853658536586
5026175,4,B006WQUKXI,"Although Cagney himself did not care for this film,( he called it dreck ) it is still an entertaining rollicking movie. Cagney plays Bat Morgan a penniless sailor, who after a series of incidents becomes ruler of the coast. His leading lady is the beautiful and talented Margaret Lindsay. His nemesis is Barton MacLane playing his usual cretinous brute,and the equally brutal and despicable villian of the thirties Fred Kohler. One of the highlights is the fight to the death Cagney has with Kohler. It is a savage and merciless fight and for its time very real. In the movie Cagney starts out as a nice guy with hardluck, but later decides its a dog eat dog world and so becomes a part of the corruption in order to survive. The film is action packed with fights, riots and vigilante mobs. Lloyd Bacons direction is assured and smooth and keeps the action moving. The film falters a bit with the love scenes, but then it picks right up with its tension filled action. The print is the best that is available and for the most part is clean. Fortunately the disc comes with the trailer to the film which show glimpses of its highlights. Cagney completists need this film.",1347580800,8,1170,4.6028708133971294

8505841,4,B006WQUKXI,"Jimmy Cagney is Jimmy Cagney to the core. The ending was ""worked on"" for the Chicago Board of Review, so it's a little ""soft"", but it's still a fun watch of an early VitaPhone Production.",1434412800,,187,4.371428571428571

8505843,5,B006WQUKXI,"Cagney in top notch form. His action scenes are terrific. The producer deserves credit for mise-en-scene, everyone wore mid-19th C American dress, to include Cagney himself, who had tremendous style. The heroine did well also. I enjoyed this film a great deal, since I've been a fan of his for decades, but had never seen it before.",1431907200,,332,4.842105263157895
8505844,5,B006WQUKXI,"Clearly a tour-De-force for James Cagney.  An exciting, well acted action film.",1419638400,,79,5.583333333333333
8505845,2,B006WQUKXI,"James Cagney cranked out so many programmers during the 1930s that an occasional misfire could not be avoided. ""Frisco Kid"" was a perfect example  lackluster Barbary Coast material ill-suited to the actor's dynamism. Hays Office compromises further prevented Cagney and director Lloyd Bacon from going full throttle. Without Cagney, this disposable Warner melodrama would remain in the studio vaults.",1416268800,2,400,5.779661016949152
8505846,5,B006WQUKXI,"I have read that James Cagney did not care for this film but I have to say he must have been hard on himself as an artist. I thoroughly enjoy this story. A penniless sailor who ends up doing very well for himself through determination. Margaret Linsay is fantastic as well. Put the two of them together, and you have a great story with a fun plot.",1392508800,,347,4.1940298507462686
