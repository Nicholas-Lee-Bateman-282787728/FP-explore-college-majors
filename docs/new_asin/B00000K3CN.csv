Oh did I say Funny I mean drop dead laughing I still laugh how Marv and Harry took those falls. But one thing still stands? How did they still get up after all those hits... lol  Home Alone 3 is ok....I guess.  Culkin is way better for the part.. Marv and Harry are part in that comedy...",1040083200,,441,4.057471264367816
1240641,5,B00000K3CN,"HOME ALONE is one of the best holiday trilogies you can own. Now finally, they put together this trilogy box set featuring all three films! My favorite film out of the HOME ALONE trilogy is HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK, particularly because it is the funniest one. HOME ALONE 3 is just okay, and HOME ALONE is a classic. Macualay Culkin was better for this kind of role, but Alex D. Linz was pretty good, too. Anyway, here are the plots of all three films:
HOME ALONE--this is the first classic. This is the film that started it all! In HOME ALONE, an eight-year-old misunderstood kid named Kevin (Macualay Culkin) is left behind at home by accident when his large family leaves on a Christmas vacation to visit some relatives in Paris, France. Then, just as Kevin starts to think being home by himself is so cool, he comes across two dumbwitted crooks named Harry and Marv who are after all the rich and big-looking houses in Kevin's neighborhood to steal all their valuables! Kevin wants the two crooks locked up in jail where they belong, so he sets up all kinds of boobytraps to capture Harry and Marv on Christmas Eve when the two crooks plan to robb Kevin's house! This movie is very hilarious. It never gets boring. I give this part in the trilogy *****[5 stars]
HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK--a lot of people find the first one to be the best in this trilogy, but I actually enjoyed this second one more! It's bigger on the laughs and has more of a crazy, complex plot. Anyway, it's a year later after that incident last Christmas at the MacCallister household. It's Christmas again, and this year, the MacCallister's are planning a trip to Florida. On the day of their flight, they get all nervous because of what happened last time. But they end making sure Kevin is with them. While at the airport (running to catch the plane - again!), Kevin gets separated from his family after getting distracted. He sees someone that looks like his father and runs after home, only this man isn't his father and he's getting on a plane to New York City! Of course, Kevin doesn't know that until after he's there. When he gets to New York City and discovers he got on the wrong plane, he decides to make this seem like his own vacation - and uses all his father's credit cards and cash money (he was holding his father's bag at the airport) to get into this fancy hotel. Life's a ball for Kevin until he comes across Harry and Marv again who escaped jail and now are after a big fancy expensive toy store in New York. Kevin overhears this plot and decides to stop the two crooks once and for all, using a whole new set of boobytraps and schemes. I give HOME ALONE 2 **********[10 stars] because it's the best one!
HOME ALONE 3--I was kind of disappointed with this one, but it is still pretty good. This one is about another young boy named Alex (Alex D. Linz), who is left home alone with the chicken pox. This time, four crooks (including a female) break into his house and it is up to Alex to stop them with the famous boobytraps. I give this one ****[4 stars] because it was okay, but not great or specatular.
All in all, if you love these HOME ALONE movies, then you have to get this DVD collection! All three movies have great acting by the entire casts, good solid funny scripts, and cool special effects. In my own personal opinion, HOME ALONE 2 is the best. But everyone has their own personal favorite! So buy this DVD box set today and you won't regret it!",1007596800,22,3467,4.401869158878505
1240642,5,B00000K3CN,"I will confess that this collection brings back tons of good memories of my life.  From Home Alone 1, all the way to the third.  Each film has its own magnificent score.  And of course, that score would enhance Christmas time. (And don't forget the hymns please!  LOL)
I started watching the first while I was in grade school.  I used to be a dummy and think that the violent parts were as funny as they can be.  But the humor had died down as time went by.  And the second film wasn't as funny, though it had more violence!  (And speaking of the second film, I had seen it on one of my most memorable (and yet very outdated) times in my life: my 8th grade trip to Washington D. C.  (Boy, I wish I got saved back then, being a Christian.)  And that movie will remind me of Washington D. C. every time I see it.  I didn't see the third until late 1997.  It wasn't about Christmas or Mr. Culkin, but still good.
I watched these films an uncountable number of times when I was in High School.  They are good any time of the year.
Each film has its own score.  I find the first and second the most magnificent, and a Christmas essential.  But the third is still good, though still wintry.  (And it had Dean Martin's ""Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.) I find ""Somewhere In My Memory"" the main highlight, with inspiring lyrics, sentimental background, and those magnificent bells at the end make you picture snow on the ground and those trees and houses decorated with lights.  I wonder what I'll come up with when listening to Christian Christmas music this holiday season.  I'll let you know.
Overall, you should at least give these films a try.  And if little kids see this, make sure they don't do the same stuff Culkin and Linz does in these films.  (It's all fake anyway!)
Until then, Godspeed!",996969600,4,1800,4.316417910447761
1240643,5,B00000K3CN,"This 3 pack DVD is good value. I grew up with Home Alone 1 and 2 and i consider one of those great comedy-family movies of the 90's. John Hugues and Chris Columbus did a absoulutely magnificant job working on these 2 movies. They are funny, heartwarming and have comic violence you can laugh at with your kids. Plus the movies really do come to live with the acting by the cast and music by John Williams. The movies are more magicial when watched around Christmas time. Now that i have praised the first two, i am undecided about Home Alone 3. I do LIKE the movie, it is not bad...it is in no way remotely as good as the first two. As Home Alone 1 and 2 fans may notice it does not have that 'feel' to it that made the first two special. It may be that Mac Culken is replaced or Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are not there. Or Chris Columbus is not directing, it could be a combination of those things but it is still a worthwhile addition and worth watching thanks to John ' i have been very quiet lately' Hugues writing which makes the movie fun. Two thumbs Up and Five Stars.",970185600,6,1076,4.15311004784689

7914142,5,B00000K3CN,"The first home alone movie was absolutely original family fun where a kid is left alone at home by accident and is the target of two bumbling burglars and now he must foil the burglars' plans.

 The second one is even better with Kevin getting on the wrong plane and ends up in New York City but is the target of the same dodo criminals once again and now he must pull off more shenanigans to foil the thieves' attempt to get even with him.

 The third one felt completely detached from the first two. A totally different character this time is on his own at home but is unaware that his toy car has been planted with a special top secret device and international criminals want to get their hands on it before the law does and now he must prevent them from getting it.",1091923200,7,769,4.2465753424657535
7914143,4,B00000K3CN,"Home Alone 1 and 2 both receive 5 out of 5 stars in my book for being very entertaining and also very funny.  If you haven't seen them yet, then get watching.
Home Alone 3 on the other hand...Didn't even compare to either of the originals.  It was completely horrible, I thought.  It lacked any comedy whatsoever, McCully wasn't in the film, and it was just a plain ole bad movie given the title of a great series of pre-existing, very good movies.  I don't even consider it to be a Home Alone movie really.  Don't bother watching it.....  I saw all three movies around the time when they  were released, so I saw them all as a younger child (17 at present.)  When I saw HA3 as a young kid I thought it was horrible after seeing the first two originals.  Now,  I think Home Alone 1 and 2 are better than I thought they were when I was younger and HA3 is worse.  I just don't recommend buying HA3(not even for younger kids.)
Buy the first two........and maybe.........just maybe...... you should rent the 3rd.",1070668800,9,1008,4.365591397849462
