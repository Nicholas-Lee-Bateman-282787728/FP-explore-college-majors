8450692,4,B00505E4WK,"I found out the original title to this film is called Dance With Destiny which you can find on Amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-With-Destiny/dp/B004J4XU8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance With Destiny</a>
Not sure why this is the same movie but it is a couple bucks cheaper. The film seems to be low-budget and independent for sure but it sure seems like
it could become a cult classic in the sense of seeing whats happening on the planet day after day and week after week. Dance With Destiny seems timely!",1379462400,,561,5.771084337349397
8450693,5,B00505E4WK,"This was definitely not what I expected, but in a good way. In all actuality this movie is about saving the earth from the destruction that is being done to it every day. All in all a worthwhile effort and message.",1368921600,,214,4.2439024390243905
8450694,5,B00505E4WK,There was so much hype around 2012 and the world ending I figured I owed it to myself and my natural curiosity to find out exactly what all the talk was about.  Having watched this I feel like I can have an informed discussion about 2012 and all its implications.  Not just for the conspiracy theorists.,1368835200,,303,4.392857142857143
8450695,5,B00505E4WK,"I loved this movie. It's so different than all the other 2012 things we are hearing and ultimately the message here isn't just for 2012, it's for the era we are in.",1354492800,,164,4.15625
8450696,4,B00505E4WK,"This is environmentalist propaganda, which I see as a good thing. It takes views from Native Americans (who are of course very in touch with the Earth) and makes the argument that we must DO SOMETHING to keep from destroying ourselves.  We will be our own undoing if we don't take care of our planet.",1353456000,,300,4.454545454545454
8450697,2,B00505E4WK,This movie was just preaching to the chorus. When they made vague of contraversial statements they should have tried to back them up with more information. I gave it one extra star than I had to becasue it did have a few words of wisdom. There is a part in the movie where they talk about 9/11. Not everyone agrees about why 9/11 happend so it was pointless and in bad taste to me. I don't know what the point of the movie was.,1348617600,,427,4.095238095238095
8450698,4,B00505E4WK,Less about the end of the earth than what we should be doing to appreciate it. This well-conceptualized documentary blends Native American and environmentalist sensibilities to give a sobering but real look at the evolution and possible future of our planet.,1338681600,,258,5.317073170731708
8450699,4,B00505E4WK,"This is a wonderful work of passion and quality, and the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because at 2 hours, it's just too much of a good thing.  Not what you'd expect from the exploitive title and cover art--less of a commentary on prophecy and more of a comment on the perils of our current course as a species--keepers of the Earth, whether we like it or not.  Filmmaker Bruce Weaver effectively utilizes stock footage from the last century with statements of Native Americans, both from North and South America.  Whether it's climate change, the poisoning of the water, the raping of the Earth, as one man says, ""the results aren't difficult to see, but those results don't have to happen.""  This film is a powerful call for action on environmental issues.  Tragically, I recall seeing similar films growing up in the 50s, but nothing was done then, and little is being done now.  The fact so many (for selfish reasons) refuse to even admit the destruction of the planet doesn't bode well for us.  Unfortunately, they aren't going to see this film.  Kudos to Mr. Weaver for the film and the magnificent lighting on the interviews.  This is a good companion piece to An Inconvenient Truth--it's too bad it won't be seen as widely as that Oscar-winning documentary.  The movie expresses a very positive viewpoint despite the laundry-list of humankind-killing crises we face immediately.  It points out that nothing else matters much if you can't breathe the air, drink the water or eat non-poisonous food.",1322870400,3,1516,4.792307692307692
