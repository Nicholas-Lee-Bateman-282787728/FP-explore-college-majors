4829064,5,B005LFQRT2,This is the second copy of the DVD that this Nana has purchased.  The first finally wore out.  Curious George DVD's are always a smart purchase.,1365724800,,144,4.5

4829066,5,B005LFQRT2,"My 2 year old loves watching Curious George on pbs while at home.  We must have several dozen episodes recorded.  Now when we go on road trips, we are able to watch Curious George thanks to the dvds.  They are the same episodes you watch on tv. Each DVD contains 8 shows totaling over 90 minutes of pure entertainment for our child to watch.",1355270400,,341,4.296875
4829067,5,B005LFQRT2,"We love Curious George! It is the only cartoon my husband and myself enjoy watching with our girls. There is something very endearing about George, this cute innocent little monkey who finds everything fascinating. We've bought most of the DVDs and our four and six year old watch them over and over again, topping their Barbie and Strawberry shortcake movies. With Curious George, a parent doesn't have to worry about anything questionable sneaking in (like some Barbie movies) and my kids have learned a lot to boot! Thankful for the series and always on the look out for the next installment!",1325808000,4,595,4.900990099009901
4829068,5,B005LFQRT2,"This new George DVD doesn't disappoint. There are some episodes on here from as early as Season 2 that I was glad to see are getting included finally! This DVD contains : The Fun-Ball Tally, This Little Piggy, Trader George, Downhill Racer, George Cleans Up, Scaredy-Dog, Up a Tree, and Bag Monkey. None of these are repeats on previous DVD's as far as I can remember. Enjoy!",1323129600,23,375,4.611940298507463

4829070,5,B005LFQRT2,"What's not to like about George!  The little guy is always into something, but somehow always comes out on top.  There are many lessons to be learned from each segment on this - and all other George DVD'S.  A good investment for a child's DVD library - or for adults.",1420588800,,267,4.3

4829076,5,B005LFQRT2,"A perfect video collection for young children.  Even though you can see these Curious George episodes through Netfix and PBS programming, the handy DVD is perfect for travel (if you have a video player in your car/van).  The episodes are geared for children as young as 2 years old, and they are a perfect tool for learning things in a quiet way.  They are calming and have simple story lines that are also teachable.  Curious George is such a likable character that children will naturally identify with him.  Because he does not talk, the visual expressions and sounds he makes are easy to understand his curiosity and problem solving.  I put these good programs of learning into my little grandsons life.",1400025600,,707,4.801652892561983
