8761867,5,B01FZ8KQ78,"Anime adaptions of Rumiko Takahashi's works are always done with great care and splendor by the animators. Rin-ne, once again brings Takahashi's work to a beautiful, animated existence. Part 2 wraps up the conclusion of season 1 with wacky hijinks by ghosts, damashigami, and of course the continuing poverty of Rin-ne. After finishing season 1, I will definitely be purchasing season 2.",1516752000,,387,5.258064516129032

8761869,5,B01FZ8KQ78,"Rin-Ne Volume 2 comprises the last 11 episodes of the first season of the Kyoukai No Rin-Ne anime. Though a bit shorter than the first volume this set contains some of the series best, and while the quality is not on par with the excellent season 2 (available to watch legally and for free on Crunchyroll I should add) I still found it worth my money. The music, story and animation all remain quite excellent.

The story of this second volume includes a further introduction of Ageha and the bureaucratic clerk (yes, the afterlife also has a complicated bureaucracy, there's just no escaping the endless forms) Kain. They're fun characters with all the quirks and interpersonal quarrels that you've come to expect from Rumic characters. The real fun though starts when the characters start playing off of one another, Jumonji and Ageha arguing with each other is a treat to watch. Sabato, Rinne's deadbeat dad and his conniving ways return while Rinne's constant attempts to win Sakura's affection and her largely blas responses to the chaos around her are always a source of amusement. As always the show takes it sweet time going anywhere or doing anything that in the end doesn't really seem to matter to much, but again self contained comedy stories is the Rumic way, so if you're not into that kind of stuff this show may not be for you. Don't expect too many big romantic moments or sudden character revelations. Episodes like ""Target: Sakura"", ""Christmas at the Derelict,"" and ""Spirited Ramen,"" have stood out as some of my all time favorites whilst the episode ""M's Tragedy,"" is to date, the only episode of the series that I actively despise, for it's ham fisted over expository nature if nothing else. Yet, the episodes are far more good than bad and I only wish there was more included on this set.

The art and animation has improved by this point in the series as the animators find their groove, some scenes still look odd and the fight scenes are, while not what I watch the show for still somewhat disappointingly lackluster. The music is about the same as part 1, nothing truly awe inspiring but really solid nonetheless. Also notable is the appearance of Fumi Hirano, yes the voice of Rumiko Takahashi's original leading lady Invader Lum has returned to voice Sakura's mother. Alongside Kappei Yamaguchi as Sabato Rokudo, the voice of Inuyasha and Ranma and Satsuki Yukino as Tamako, the voice of Kagome, the series sometimes feels like a big reunion...at least if you're a Rumic geek like me. The only real complaint I have in this department is the new intro which sounds ear gratingly annoying when compared with the first.

Also, this release lacks and English dub, same as the others, not surprising but still...I like my dubs m'kay. The extras are. as last time incredibly sparse, clean openness and closings, but that's also standard practice in the industry these days. If Sentai does decide to release a season 2 I would love to see perhaps a few more extras tacked on, concept art, promo's or trailers or character vignettes are all simple (at least I assume they're simple, I have no experience in the industry) things one could include that would really add extra value to the purchase. The picture looks crisp and clear as always and Sentai has done an excellent job with the bright packaging visuals.

Rin-ne Part 2 continues to please with it's engaging characters and at times legitimately laugh out loud comedy, it's a show that I thoroughly enjoy watching and even though you don't quite get as many episodes for your money this time around, but if you're a fan of the show this is still a no brainer to buy.",1478131200,,3645,4.753554502369668
