8040004,5,B0006809BG,The book is a joy to read to my students. We got many hours of classwork from it. I consider it a used classroom tool for first graders.,1338595200,,136,3.892857142857143
8040005,5,B0006809BG,"Simply the best Reading Rainbow episode EVER because it includes a behind the scenes look at Star Trek: The Next Generation!  It makes perfect sense since LaVar Burton is in both of these shows!  I remember watching it as a kid and was completely blown away!  I have MY copy, do you have yours?  Definately a MUST for Star Trek and Reading Rainbow fans alike!",1278806400,,359,4.476923076923077
