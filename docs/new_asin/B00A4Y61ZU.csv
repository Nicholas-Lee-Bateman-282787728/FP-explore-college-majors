There he falls in love with a bookstore owner as well as the quaint town itself, giving him new purpose and a sense of belonging that he has been missing in life.""  IMDb classifies it as a drama, rather than a romantic comedy.  Whatever it is, I enjoy feel-good movies that have happy endings and characters that you can relate to.  Does that make me a ""softie?""  If so, so be it.  I liked Jesse Metcalfe, Natalie Lisinska, Brandon Firla, Derek McGrath, and some of the other cast that had smaller parts.  Although I don't watch much TV, I remember Firla and McGrath from another Hallmark movie ""Daniel's Daughter.""

The small town setting was nice though and had some good scenery. The story was beyond predictable from the very beginning. I kept wondering if I should keep watching. The real downer was the poor acting. Jesse Metcalfe was great but everyone else seem to be not into their character. His love interest looked down a lot and looked like she was thinking about what was for lunch. Just no chemistry. The ""villain"" was (don't' want to do a spoiler) actually looked like your typical villain with beard, shifty eyes and poor lines.

Noah quits his job with the mayor so Noah's assistant has to run the Mayor's campaign - with constant telephone advice from Noah. With his new-found success, Noah pops the question to his long-time fiance, planning to start their new life together in Washington, only to find that she has another lover. So, the wedding is off but Noah has ordered the ring to be delivered at a romantic inn in Fairfield Road, Harpswell, Cape Cod, so he has to go there to collect it. On the way, he hears that the Senator is to be charged with corruption and embezzlement - so that job is now out too. The proprietors of the inn, Sam and Lillian Peabody (Derek McGrath, Chick Reid) are very understanding and encourage young Noah to stay with them anyway, sans fiance. That very evening there is a Preservation Society dinner at which the redevelopment of the town to include a huge new shopping mall comes up. Sam is against it and Noah gets drawn into the argument. Noah makes a convincing case to approve the development - but another opponent is local bookstore owner Hailey Caldwell (Natalie Lisinska) who is a confirmed environmentalist. Hailey shows Noah why she opposes the development by taking him to the local beauty spots. With the debate about the development hotting up and his increasing feelings for Hailey, Noah decides to stay - and has a new recipient for his engagement ring.",1375488000,36,1681,4.6824324324324325

There was a few utterances of mild crude language; drinking of beer, wine and champagne and a bar scene; a shirtless man, a man in his boxer shorts and an open shirt, and a woman with a low cut shirt; also, a woman is unfaithful to a man.  It is not rated and the Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for 12+.

I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again.  I originally saw this movie on Hallmark Channel and bought it as soon as it came to DVD.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".

I liked the two main characters, Noah and Hailey.  They were very cute together.  Although, I have to admit that I thought it weird that he became so attracted to her just hours after breaking off his engagement.  Granted his girlfriend wanted to get married just for the sake of getting married and so was manipulating/pressuring him into it.  Obviously she didn't really love him or she wouldn't have been cheating on him.  I guess it turned out how it was supposed to though, because he met Hailey.  I also love the small, quiet Cape Cod town and all the people there.  They all seem very loyal to each other.  Makes me want to live someplace like that.

Jesse Metcalfe(I like ""On the Other Line"" better for laughs and romance) plays Noah, an up and coming Boston political strategist, whose life suddenly crashes both career-wise and relationship-wise.  He ends up chasing a diamond ring up to scenic Cape Cod, off season, at the pretty little town of Harpswell.  It's simple bucolic existence threatened by development.

He discovers love (or is he just on the rebound?) and begins to question his life's goals.  Will he stay here in Harpswell or bail out to the big city and big dreams?  Stay tuned.

It's all very much done before. The actors are fine and likable, mostly.  The story is tepid, the romance gentle.  Hallmark clean- they do imply infidelity; however, the kiddoes will be bored silly with this film.  3 1/2 stars.",1361059200,27,990,5.006134969325154

8546779,5,B00A4Y61ZU,"I have become a huge Jesse Metcalfe fan ever since I saw him in the Dallas remake show a few years ago!
When this movie popped up on my Hallmark Channel offerings, I jumped at the chance to see him in action again.
This is a really well written, well directed movie. Not gooshy or 2nd rate at all. Sometimes I would just like to see a nice relationship work out..without being cookie cutter ""romance novel"" like and boring. Both leads were invested in their parts. They were given a good script from which to work, and the set direction was engaging and nicely edited. The conflict from which the movie pivoted was plausible and entertaining. I have moved this wonderful movie up to the top 10 of my "" I FEEL"" like enjoying a good move"" list. I can's wait to see the next projects for both of the leads. I rated this movie a wonderful 10 for the light heart and quiet joy it gave me even long after it was over.",1528588800,,911,4.241379310344827

8546781,5,B00A4Y61ZU,I loved the movie from the Get Go! Of course if it is a Hallmark movie you know it's going to be good. The town and the people were all so remarkable. All the elements that make a quaint small town were there. I thought all along that Noah would be a great pick for this towns manager. and he knew just what the town needed. I am a big fan of Jesse Metcalfe and  I am looking forward to seeing him in more great movies.,1523491200,,419,3.872093023255814
8546782,4,B00A4Y61ZU,"I confess the first time I viewed this movie I was not impressed. I thought the first ""live in girlfriend"" and the later love interest were polar opposites and that she and Noah did not have good chemistry. The second time I now see that Noah was very successful at what he did. Campaign. He gets a ring to keep the girl then leaves the girl after she makes a bad move. He has to drive all the way to another place to get the ring after he ships it to a B&B hoping for a romantic place to propose. Along the way he gets bad news but continues on to get the ring. When he gets to this small town he meets so many great people including a very headstrong woman who catches his eye. Meanwhile there is a great dogie story, two people in town competing for town manager and more great scenes between Noah and a former coworker. Noah seems like most young men trying to maintain success but as the story moves along we see his heart as well as the heart of the female lead. I am not really sure why a lot of people disliked this movie. I was glad more liked it. Jessie Metcalf was good here and adorable to watch. I do not want to give anymore away. Just watch and enjoy!!",1523232000,,1167,4.078260869565217

8546784,5,B00A4Y61ZU,Loved this movie. It stars Jesse Metcalfe who was Christopher Ewing on Dallas for 3 seasons. He is a talented actor. This is worth seeing. A good clean movie for the whole family. I'm glad i bought it.,1521936000,,201,4.315789473684211
8546785,1,B00A4Y61ZU,"When it comes to Hallmark, we know what were in forclean, wholesome, predictable and comforting. Characters are charming, mildly humorous, and willing to settle differences to rebuild friendships or find love. Some stories are 5-star masterpieces, like Sarah Plain and Tall and Mrs. Arris Goes to Paris. But for a rainy day or quiet evening at home, we don't want much from our Hallmark movies.
So youd have to go pretty low to make a bad Hallmark movie. Or do you have to be extra lazy, like whoever slapped together Fairfield Road? There was zero effort put into this color-by-numbers slog that should have been a movie-within-a-movie. Put a cute guy in the lead, make the girl spunky-yet-vulnerable, add a goatee-sporting developer as the villain and set on Pander for 93 minutes until done. It takes a lot to make me roll my eyes during a Hallmark movie, but they managed it.
Take Noah for instance. The actor playing him was woefully miscast. He pretty much screamed jerk from the get-go, and with no redemptive arc in sight I had no inclination to root for him. Yes he was boyishly handsome, but his acting was so weak I never bought him as a person, let alone the hero. It was a role I would expect Joey Tribbiani to get on Friends. The actor phoned it in because he knows the movie will be watched simply because hes cute.
Everyone acted like this was nothing but a paycheck. They didn't even mention Fairfield Road in the movie, except when the main guy asked for directions to the inn. The entire movie was an insult to Hallmark fans because hey, we love cheesy and were proud of it. What we don't like is lazy.",1519344000,,1621,4.554794520547945
8546786,2,B00A4Y61ZU,"Jesse Metcalfe overacts.  Unconvincing.  Sure hes a pretty boy who can be superficially charming when he is trying to get something from you, but its all too over rehearsed.

Boy gets job & gets engaged then has to face the truth.

He goes to Hartswell on Cape Cod where he finds himself",1516665600,,287,4.461538461538462
