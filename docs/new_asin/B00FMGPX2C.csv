8616952,4,B00FMGPX2C,In Sickness and in Health was a good film. Some of the acting could've been better. Smith's performance was a career low. However the themes of love and caring for someone with an illness rang true. This is a good date movie. To Love and to Cherish has a great cast. Mel Jackson does a great job as one of the lead characters. Many families today are mixed and this film addresses issues of fatherhood and stepparenting well. The script was well written and the acting was good. Highly recommended for fans of family oriented romantic comedies. Both films would be rated PG. They are clean family films.
