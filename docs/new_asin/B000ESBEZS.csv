8113892,5,B000ESBEZS,"Rio Rich does a great job at Carnival. You have to be there to know how difficult it is to film the schools and floats and beautiful women, with a steady hand. He captures so much fun and beauty, at such a great price. Thanks Rich for making my Masquerade party a major hit.",1298246400,2,274,4.092592592592593
8113893,1,B000ESBEZS,"Horrible quality video, not classy at all, they show only the worse part of it. I grew up in Rio and I found this video insulting because of how bad it was done. I think isn't worth a quarter, unfortunately. This was a amateur movie.",1284249600,4,233,4.2
8113894,3,B000ESBEZS,"The picture is excellant, but very shaky. I don't really blame the cameraman, because it is the dancing in the stands (were he is photographing) that causes the shaking. The women are out of this world beautiful. Rio, I gotta get there.",1200614400,8,236,4.642857142857143
8113895,3,B000ESBEZS,"A great parade spoiled by a very shaky cameraman,most of disk one was so wobbly that you felt like throwing something at the tv set. Were all those half naked dancers too much for the person behind the camera?,a pity really,apart from that glaring fault the rest of the two dvds were excellent and I would have given it high marks,as it is,I am reluctant to recommend it to any buyer.",1146787200,16,384,4.422535211267606
