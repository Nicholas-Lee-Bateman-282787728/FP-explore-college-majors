7909416,5,B00000I1RP,"This is the fourth installment of the action packed Wong Fei-Hong Series. After winning the ""Lion King"" competition in part 3, Wong Fei-Hung (Zhao) is invited to participate in another competition. This time, the different foreign powers making a stake in China will be taking on Wong and his team - which includes his sidekicks Fu (Mok) and Clubfoot (Hung) in a thinly veil sort of ""War game"" designed to scare China into submission. While training for the competition, Wong turns afoul of the Red Lantern Sect, a vicious group of women who are determined to get the foreigners out of China at any cost. Wong's love life also takes a strange turn when Aunt Yee's sister, May(Wang) falls for him.",1256083200,,696,4.760330578512397
7909417,5,B00000I1RP,"First off you have to look at this as not another Jet Li movie. The wire work is excellent, the skill is fantastic and the story line is great. This is Action packed. And you will not be disapointed. Its that good trust me. The writer who said its not worth watching has no clue about Gung Fu, this Star is a Star in his own right. And the movie wasn't not just put together. They took their time to show a very true boxer rebellion in China. Get this if there are any left. The is a discontinued DVD But there are a few left out there this is a Gung Fu Classic for sure!",1222387200,2,571,3.9310344827586206
7909418,3,B00000I1RP,"This film sees a new Wong Fei Hung and is akin to having a new actor playing James Bond. Jet Li made the part his own so any actor would feel the pressure of stepping into those kung fu slippers. In fact the whole film seems to be aimed at introducing us to Chiu Man Chuk, the new Wong. Elements of the first three films are blended into the story, which is the weakest part of the film but the fight scenes are great. One for fans I think. Best character has to be the horse punching Billy Chow.",1034640000,,496,4.02020202020202
