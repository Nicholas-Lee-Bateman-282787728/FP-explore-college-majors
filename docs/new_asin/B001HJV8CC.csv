8308806,5,B001HJV8CC,"It's a great film from all points of view - beautifull talented cast, interesting plot and NOT such a happy end which makes it real and touching (well, not for your regular Amercian viewer who, no matter what, is used to the main character rising out of the dead at the last minute of the film....) Really good for the learners of the Italian language as the dialogue is rich but not over complicated.",1328486400,,401,4.4324324324324325
