1053396,4,6305511675,This movie is really a good movie.....once you get through all the comedy. Like an obviously Chinese guy acting like he is a black guy....like they couldn't hire Jim Kelly to play the part. The action is still really  good. Samo is a good Bruce Lee inpersonator. He may not look like Bruce but  you can see and feel he is a good fighter in his own rite. All those whose  who are true martial artists will see that this is a good movie and even  worth paying for.,942969600,,462,4.157303370786517

7892268,4,6305511675,"This movie is simultaneously a tribute to Bruce Lee, and a scathing indictment of ""Bruceploitation"" flicks.  Director Sammo Hung plays a pig farmer, obsessed with Bruce Lee, who goes to the big city to help his uncle run a tiny outdoor restaurant.  He immediately gets into trouble, helping out a co-worker with some thugs.  Things pretty much just escalate from there.  The more Sammo tries to lend a hand to the folks around him, the more things go crazy.  I'm reminded of the irony in the mid-90's cartoon ""Eek the Cat"", whose main character's slogan, ""it never hurts to help"" always did.

The fights are a lot of fun and occur frequently.  Sammo does his best to imitate the movements, noises, and facial expressions of Lee rather humorously, and without insulting his memory.  This flick is full of comedy, and while most of it's not hilarious, it's not painful either.  You likely won't crack-up, but you may just crack a smile.  Lee Hoi San, doing his best ""Al Jolson"" in a giant afro, should produce a chuckle if you're not offended by it.  You certainly shouldn't be.

Crash Cinema's DVD is nicely widescreened with decent picture quality, but has no dub, and subtitles that blend in with the background about 30% of the time.  Honestly, it's not really that big of a deal.  This movie is easy enough to follow.  Some extras would've been nice, but I'm just happy to have finally seen it.  The rating is up for debate.  It's probably more along the lines of a 3.5, but this is one that I'd likely watch repeatedly, so ""4"" it is.  I may even go so far as to say that Sammo Hung does a better Bruce Lee than anyone else, right down to the nunchaku.  Recommended.

7892269,5,6305511675,"Indeed a guilty pleasure!  One of Sammo's greatest(and unjustly forgotten) films, Enter The Fat Dragon stars Hung as a pig farmer obsessed with his ""hero"" Bruce Lee and who spends most of his time getting into trouble and hamming it up(get it?  Pig farmer... ham?  Sorry, that's the last one I promise) while doing it.  Rarely has Sammo been able to balance action with comedy so flawlessly.  Don't get me wrong, I'm an enormous Sammo(get it?  Enormous... Sammo?  He's fat people, and THAT is the last one... I hope) fan but... we all know that he nearly always brings great action, but his comedy?  It doesn't always work so well, I mean there have been moments in his other movies but nothing like this, which plays out ridiculous scenario one right after the other that actually provide laughs... and when all else fails, he resorts to mimicking Bruce Lee in uncanny and amusing fashion(sure to induce smiles EVERYtime).  Now obviously my 5 star rating will be more than a little skewed for most.  I mean, can the movie really stack up to other so-called cinematic ""classics"" such as ET, The Godfather, or Citizen Kane?  The answer is ""hell yes!""  Well, for fans of Kung Fu and Sammo Hung at least... Sammo using Jeet Kune Do on a herd of unruly swine, Hoi San Lee(36th Chamber Of Shaolin, Last Hurrah For Chivalry, Twin Warriors) painted black and sporting an afro and puffy purple shirt as an African American fighter(not the most PC thing ever... but bizarre and must-see to be sure), and my personal favorite scene featuring Sammo breaking up the filming of a Bruceploitation film by taking on the main imitator and his entire entourage(in a matchup featuring plenty of Lee's trademark howls and posturing).  This film comes highly recommended for fans of classic martial arts mayhem or even those with any passing interest in this films star OR the man he obviously greatly admired.  As for the DVD from Crash Masters?  It's complete garbage unfortunately, with an awful print of the film and subtitles that are so small and light in color that they become near illegible oftentimes(and even when you can see them, they rarely read right... like the word ""is"" whenever ""have"" should be used), also no dubbed track is available here either.  An extremely poor, bare-bones release for a film worthy of far more... hopefully someday it will get the release, and viewing public, that it rightly deserves.",1203033600,6,2408,4.808252427184466
7892270,3,6305511675,"Terribly charming, that is.  Sammo Hung portrays a starstruck Bruce Lee fan, imitating him down to the haircut and monkey-like shrieks.  Otherwise a simple-minded man, he displays throughout the movie Bruce Lee-like fighting prowess which, coming from a man his size, is hilarious to behold.  The storyline is crap, there's no two ways about it, but the content is what makes it great.  The various stupid moments (Sammo trying to buy sunglasses that look like a Bruce Lee picture, the millionaire's ""revenge"" daydreams, any time Sammo goes into Bruce Lee mode, the terrible english, the Black-faced Asian) are incredibly corny and fun to watch.

Not only that, but the action scenes are actually decent.  Normally I hate watching Bruce Lee's fight scenes, finding them FAR too contrived and silly, but Sammo manages to pull it off quite well.  Maybe it's his funny and intense charisma, I don't know.  Not only that, but Sammo even chooses to integrate some traditional Kung Fu fight scenes in the movie, bringing its worth in my eyes way up.

The movie harkens back to the days when heros were idealized and worshipped, something severely lacking in today's society, with the dirt sheets and Hollywood scandals appearing everywhere.  Chuck Norris did a similar theme with Sidekicks, and ideal heros, unfortunately, has become a dying breed of people.  Something that endears the movie to me is that there's little swearing and the violence is surprisingly non-violent.  Sure there are kung fu punches and kicks and the like, but the reactions are always almost Loony Toon-ish in their reaction, the victims having huge and goofy-looking sores where they were hit.  And other than a single sex joke at the beginning of the movie, it's surprisingly clean, resorting to slapstick and farce for it's humor.

So why am I giving it only three stars?  Firstly, the movie quality is terrible in every aspect.  It's easily seen that there was no budget for the movie (blackfaced Asian?  What the hell?), although that definitely added to the campy silliness.  Secondly, the video quality is horrible.  The DVD claims to have it remastered, but it's incredibly grainy and looks antiquated, with even some marker markings showing up in some stills.  The subtitles, as well, are pale and fuzzy white, making them really hard to see a lot of the time.  Thank god the movie's plot is unimportant.",1131321600,,2384,4.984810126582278
7892271,4,6305511675,"a classic film that makes fun of all the Brucexploitation in Chinese Cinema in the 70's and early 80's. The movie is very funny and is a well done spoof. The plot is very similar to Bruces Return of the Dragon - a young country boy traveling to the city to help out a restaurant and running into trouble with local gangster types. Sammos hero in the movie is Bruce Lee and he does a great job copying all of the moves(occasionally throwing in some of his own)and can pretty much whip everybody until he runs into three bodyguards - one white dude(an expert in boxing), one chinese dude(an expert in kung fu), and one black/chinese dude(an expert in karate) this is when the movie

steps up the martial arts - the final fight scenes are very well

done as well. A great addition to any kung fu movie collection and a must for any Sammo Hung fan.",1102896000,,844,4.3354430379746836
7892272,5,6305511675,"Sammo may not look like Bruce Lee, but he sure does the best impression I've ever seen.  Sammo holds his own with a few of Bruce Lee's famous moves mixed in with his own style of martial arts.  At first this movie seems aged and low budget, but you soon forget that as the story develops and you see Sammo's skills come to life.  It's a martial arts classic, a homage to Bruce and a must have for any fan of the genre.",1027900800,,418,4.0120481927710845
7892273,4,6305511675,"I purchased this DVD because I love the richness and exemplary performance of Sammo Hung. My previous experience with Sammo includes Millionaire's Express and The Magnificent Butcher.
Enter the Fat Dragon is a befitting tribute to Master Bruce Lee by his friend Sammo Hung.
Sammo plays a loveable, eager, and starstruck fan. Bruce Lee is everything to him. Believably Bruce Lee-obsessed and fixated to do the right thing by the people he loves, Sammo's character more or less causes more problems than good.
While the movie was a blast to watch, the people who released this DVD are falsely advertising its quality. This is the only reason I didn't give this a 5-star rating. The DVD states this is a ""remaster"" but the film has an annoying graininess. The English subtitles also included several misspellings and at times were not always in plain view.
I may not be an expert on the technology of film, but the image quality should have turned out way better than it did.
However, despite this lackluster transfer to DVD, this Hong Kong Martial Arts film translates well. You will be amazed at Sammo's dedication in imitating Bruce. He is a true marvel to watch.",1019952000,,1163,4.82
7892274,4,6305511675,"Good gracious! A 70's Hong Kong martial arts film available in widescreen?! Let's hope it's a trend! While the movie is probably worth three stars, I have to tack on one more for the widescreen presentation.
A loving parody of Bruce Lee and his fans, this 1978 film follows the trivails of a young man who idolizes Bruce, and comes to the city in order to help his uncle run his food stand. Bad guys try to muscle their way to a free lunch, and Sammo makes them pay the check.
Then his girlfriend is kidnapped because she reminds a clownish rich bad guy of the only woman to turn him down. Enter three more bad dudes on the rich guy's payroll. One is a karate expert, and another is a redneck kickboxer. Most laughable is the ""black"" fighter, who's really an Asian gentleman with really bad make-up (complete with an afro that looks like a beehive hairdoo wig from the 50's, 70's sideburns, and blazing red bellbottoms). Obviously a parody of Jim Kelly in ""Enter the Dragon, the guy is sheer rediculousness incarnate.
Sammo is amazing, transforming from overweight buffoon to kung fu king with just a few quick motions. The idea, as far as I can tell, was to recreate some of the actual fights from Bruce Lee's films. If so, they appear seamless. Best fight scene other than the climax would have to be Sammo taking on a Bruce Lee impersonator and his movie stunt crew. Then, in the climax, Sammo uses found-objects in a warehouse to combat the three enforcers, much like Jackie Chan does in his films. Overall, this 1978 effort is most easily described as Jackie Chan-lite, and as such, gives the viewer an hour and a half of light martial arts comedy.
For those like myself, not really steeped in Bruce Lee lore, the movie is at the very least a fun time with a young Sammo battling bad guys. Despite all the kung fu action, the film is totally harmless if you want to give a copy to the kids. Nobody really gets hurt all that much, and they'll find the slapstick and kung-fu comedy enjoyable.",1008547200,4,1995,4.483516483516484
7892275,3,6305511675,"As the title suggests, Sammo once again shows the self-mockery that he's well known for. Naturally, this is part of his enormous charm. Unlike Hollywood's representation of the hero - who more often than not is  handsome and nearly always gets the girl - , 80's Hong Kong cinema usually  featured a hero with not much going for him and that wonderful innocence  that has sadly gone. In 'Enter The Fat Dragon', Sammo is naivity  personified, but is also blessed with extraordinary skill; his scene with  the nunchukas is worth the price on it's own. The poor quality of the Dvd  and the lack of remastered subtitles hinder the marks for this film, but if  you want to see the real Sammo (not the watered-down Martial Law one),  check this excellent cult-classic out",944438400,5,764,4.69172932330827
