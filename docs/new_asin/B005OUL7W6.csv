""Thomas The Tank Engine: Adventure On The Tracks""
(Hit Entertainment, 2011)
---------------------------------------------------------
This well-packaged 6-disc set gathers together six classic, previously-released ""Thomas And Friends"" DVDs: ""Thomas And The Jet Engine,"" ""Thomas Comes To Breakfast,"" ""Steamies Vs. Diesels"", ""Percy's Ghostly Trick,"" ""Rusty To The Rescue"" and ""Percy Saves The Day."" The discs are housed in a slim package, just over the regular width of a normal DVD, so if you are looking to save shelf space, this is a great option, as well as a great bargain. Also makes a super-fab gift for friends with a Thomas fan in the family... almost six hours worth of sweet, English train mania!
