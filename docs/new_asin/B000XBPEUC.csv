3000387,5,B000XBPEUC,"My kids have volume 1 and watch it fairly often.  They were very excited when they received the 2nd volume.  Is it helping them to learn Italian?  Yeah, it isn't  bad.  It covers topics they enjoy, they like the cartoon dog who walks them through the quizzes and it is easy for them (8-years old) to manipulate on the DVD player.",1357689600,,329,4.327868852459017
3000388,4,B000XBPEUC,"not really sure if this was worth the price.  I thought it would be longer.  My daughter is 7 and she liked it, but not enough to watch twice.",1338422400,,142,3.8620689655172415
3000389,1,B000XBPEUC,"We live in Germany as part of the military and I was trying to find something that my 7 year old daughter could use to help learn the language.  This was just awful! Don't waste your time or money. You can youtube the stuff that was on this video and have better luck.  They don't really give you a lot of time to try and say the word before jumping on to the next word or phrase.  Also, you only hear the word once and you are expected to get it from that one time. It was painful to watch and we just turned it off. Not worth your money. Trust me! Keep looking and find something else.",1322265600,2,587,3.957627118644068
3000390,4,B000XBPEUC,"Quite simple and easy to get started, I spent two 3 yr tours in Germany, loved the country, loved the people and FOOD!!!

 My daughter was taking German ins school, but the class she transferred into was too advanced for her so I bought these. She learned basic sentence structure and common words - a bib help in her class.",1288396800,3,324,4.383333333333334
3000391,5,B000XBPEUC,"I loved the DVD series so much that I also ordered their French and Spanish versions!  Charmingly made with native speakers, this series also has cute CGI cartoon characters that help keep kids entertained.  Interactive games, catchy music and songs, and a well-written dialogue make this a must-own for any parent or teacher who is helping their child learn a foreign language!  I still have some of the songs stuck in my head today.",1275955200,8,434,4.837837837837838
3000392,5,B000XBPEUC,"Like volume volume 1, volume 2 is simple, yet helpful and fun in teaching Italian!  I, as a student preparing to study abroad in Italy this summer, learned some more of the Italian language. In this volume, you learn Italian in the form of everyday situations, including telling time, naming things you see outside, and parts of traditional Italian dinners.  What makes learning it entertaining is that in between cute little songs play aboout the Italian words taught, and games presented in between to test your knowledge.  What makes this especially adorable is Marina's puppy Momo.  Momo provides cute & comical moments, and during the games, everytime you answer a question correctly, she will say ""Si! Molto Bene!"" which means ""Yes! Very Good!"".

The only unfortunate fact is that there are only 2 voluems from the Langauge Tree that teaches Italian. :(  However I enjoyed learning from tehse 2 dvd's and I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn Italian.",1263254400,5,972,4.969135802469136
3000393,4,B000XBPEUC,My children aged 6 and 4 have enjoyed watching this DVD.  Works in Australia.  They are starting to say words during everyday conversation and repeat the words while watching the DVD.  Beautiful songs and great interaction to test the kids are understanding.,1243296000,5,258,5.095238095238095
3000394,5,B000XBPEUC,"We have both Italian volumes 1 and 2 and they are both great! Both my children ages 3 and 7 enjoy the lessons with Marina and Momo.  I'm also enjoying it as well and have decided to take a refresher course in Italian.  Why do we love it?  First there's the character of Momo (an animated dog) who is just too cute.  And there are the Italian-speaking kids who are also cute.  Seeing other kids speak Italian seems to inspire my kids to speak it as well.  We also enjoy the melodic songs and games that come after each chapter.  With so much going on, the video just doesn't get boring.

Overall, it's a well-made quality learning product.  Hope to see more volumes on the way!",1217289600,7,676,4.301587301587301

8227750,5,B000XBPEUC,Great DVD. My son loves it and watches over and over. You can learn a few german phases but not enough to learn language.,1458691200,,121,4.083333333333333

8227753,5,B000XBPEUC,"Cute show for our kids, ages 5, 4, and 2. The repetition of the key phrasing helps them remember. However, the dog character (Momo) is very strange to look at. Our kids think the dog is cute, so I guess that's okay! The video has a selection to play without quizzing the kids, or to allow the kids to answer quiz questions using the remote control. I find our kids learn better when I sit with them and pause the show to recap and make them repeat. However, I can easily put them in front of this lesson and select ""play video only"" so that they watch without quiz interruptions. This allows me some free time while they soak in some Italian lessons. Overall: fun program with catchy tunes for the kids to sing along",1440201600,2,716,4.311111111111111

8227758,3,B000XBPEUC,"I bought this item for my grandchildren to help them learn Italian, but the first thing my granddaughter noticed was the ugly, scary looking dog!  It was an immediate turn off and I was so disappointed because I really wanted to find a video that would help encourage their opportunity to learn and speak Italian with us.  What a shame, because after that she lost all interest in watching the video and chose something more appealing.",1375574400,,435,4.7105263157894735
8227759,3,B000XBPEUC,"It's OKAY, but it's slow - and you get bored with it because of how slow it is.  I guess though, since it is for children, it might be okay.  I really bought it for myself because I learned Arabic from their version of Sesame Street and I was hoping this would similar to that.  It lacks the technology that I was expecting.",1367020800,,324,4.111111111111111
