7901764,2,9764247520,A must for vans of And Then There Were None. 1990s production filmed in Bulgaria with excellent adherence to Christie's book. My disc has a technical glitch at ending which is a bummer. Hope yours works better.,1498521600,,210,4.702702702702703
7901765,2,9764247520,"The movie is excellent-music, actors,scenery-the works. I think that it is very well done, and, no, it isn't exactly uplifting.:)

I really wanted to borrow it to see if I want to buy the DVD.

The DVD is defective..I got this one just as soon as the library bought it so I am the first viewer. Major issues with the sound, especially part 2, color fading out, freezing screen, sound disappearing, period, even subtitles disappeared. I couldn't finish watching it because it froze.  Make sure that you open and watch the DVD right away. I don't know if this us a defective copy.

The book is easily the best mystery Agatha Christie ever wrote and filmed some 6 or 7 times.  The 1945 UK version comes in a distant 3rd.  Desyat Negrityat  is the most faithful to the haunting book.  The actors are unknown to those of us in the West, but this makes no difference.  I have only seen two or three Russian movies with subtitles and wish many more were available.  If you want to see how wonderfully another culture can film an English mystery icon, Desyat Negrityat, filmed in 1987, is the one for you.",1465084800,,610,4.298245614035087
7901767,3,9764247520,"First off, I bought this as a gift for a family member, who is a huge fan of the story. We decided to watch it together. Both of us have seen enough subtitled shows to not be thrown off.
This movie had the worst English subtitles I've seen, laugh out loud bad. Names changing constantly, etc. You can get by that, though, and I've seen misspellings and the like in the past. But what was difficult to get by were the messages inserted at a few points in the movie, including:

RORO I LOVE YOU
Rohra is a wee bunny :)
Roro and RJ are good guys
RORO RORO RORO
Roro likes bunny under the bush
kiss kiss kiss you
Love to you yadijay

To me, that spoiled things. Even one message, I could get past, but that's seven off the top of my head.

So, if you really want to see this, by all means, go and get it. The family member loved it despite the sophomoric messages and the constantly flubbed translation (plus, I know some Russian, so I could tell there were even more mistakes than some might notice). Maybe the subtitles were done by a kid or someone's kid was able to slip a few in.

But if you can wait, hold off and see if a pro, or a semi-pro at least, does the subtitles in the future. This is one of the few films I've seen where there was no credit at the start or the end for the person who did the subtitles. With all the messages, I can see why.",1464652800,,1352,4.0335820895522385
7901768,5,9764247520,"SPOILER ALERT:  Agree with Grossman's review.  This is a movie that is more true to Christie's original novel than any of the popular films that have been made from the Louis Hayward/Barry Fitzgerald film through the Hugh O'Brien/Wilfred Hyde White film and beyond.  The Russian version made in 1987 is totally unromantic.  It reminds you of a popular song by the Gershwins -- ""But Not For Me.""  The lyrics include the line:  ""I found more clouds of gray than any Russian play could guarantee.""  Well, this film is cloudy, gray, and depressing.  It is a lovely production in terms of setting, scenery, background; but there is no relief in terms of comedy.  The victims are all guilty of their accused crimes, shown in many cases by flashbacks. The last victim is the most sympathetic because of her tears and anguish, yet she commits murder, and goes on to meet her fate as Christie wrote.  You are left with the realization that Christie was at base as unsentimental and hard-headed as the Russians who produced this movie.  It's Hollywood that provides the rose colored glasses.",1442620800,2,1081,4.820652173913044
7901769,5,9764247520,"If you love christy, get this version. it is the ONLY version that follows the christie book and not the play. the huston/fitzgerald version is turned into a comedy with an insipid  love story thrown in to sell more tickets.. this russian film has not one word of comedy and all the characters are very unlikeable. there is no one to root for. it is the longest and, for those that don't know the book, a stunner. great sets and great acting by some of russia's greatest actors make this a must. why doesn't robert osborne show this on tcm?",1436486400,5,540,4.4
