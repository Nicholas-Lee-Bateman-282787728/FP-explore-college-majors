515764,5,6302805406,"For those of you who read my review on this book, you know that  I gave the book 4 stars. Well, Neeson outdid the book! Neeson takes the book a BIG step farther. We see Ethan in his disfigured and isolated state, and then time goes backwards and we see how Ethan went from a somewhat normal state to this tragic and lamentable state. The priest adds a welcome touch of sympathy. The images are outstanding, and the background music flatters the images well. Comic relief moments are inserted in this lamentable tragedy well. One thing I must say about this movie is that even though it does not have lots of action or effects, IT IS NEVER BORING!! Ethan's quarrles with his wife are memorable, and his reluctant affair is unforgettable. There is even a wonderful scene in the middle that foreshadows Ethan's crippled state, the hostility between Ethan's wife and the housekeeper, and the tree that changes everyone's life for the worse. One brief, but vital scene is when Ethan and his wife argue bitterly, and the housekeeper along with one of Ethan's helpers overhear it. The final scene is likely to draw tears even from the most experienced person in drama and tragedy. Neeson deserves much credit for turning a 4 star book into an exquisite masterpiece. With all the movies I have seen, I can not boast of knowing more than 16 exquisite masterpieces, and this is one of them.",974505600,41,1380,4.655737704918033
515765,3,6302805406,"Generally, the adaption from the book to screen was well done. I thought Zeena could have been played as more of an excentric character and more of a hypochondriac - which worked well in the novel. Ethan Frome was played  well, and the cast worked well on screen. The chemistry between Ethan and  Mattie was well picked up on,from the audience's perspective.
Overall,  this film was a good one. I probably wouldn't recommend you rent it for a  Saturday night at home though - read the book, i found this more  descriptive and visual.",963446400,2,533,4.627659574468085

515844,5,6302805406,"Having read Ethan Frome last September I was captivated by the love triangle and the beautifully written narrative, which encompassed the stark landscape and the contrasting of each characters emotions and feelings was unforgettable. Edith Wharton evoked a lost world and through here vivid language and harrowing emotions it was a book that completely encapsulated me. And a twist at the end of the story I never expected! I was disappointed that Ethan Frome was not available in region 2 DVD, But fortunately Amazon had a VHS video available which would play on my Combi- player. The film arrived ahead of scheduled well packaged and in pristine condition. The film stars Liam Neeson and Patricia Arquette and is undescriably beautiful. The Video played perfectly, not always the case with VHS, and left me emotionally bereft in particular Neeson's' performance was truly epic. If you want an old fashioned love story with a twist then this is it!

The movie absolutely bored me to tears and the casting was really just a failure in my opinion. I've never been a huge fan of Liam Neeson in the first place, but Patricia Arquette and her fake accent just make it so much worse. The whole movie just drones on and on without nuance and I stopped about 3/4 of the way through because I felt like I'd already wasted too much time on it.

515897,2,6302805406,"I've read Edith Wharton's short novel on which ""Ethan Frome"" is based many times; it's definitely on my top 10 American novels list. This movie gets the bleak rural Massachusetts physical setting right. Liam Neeson and Joan Allen are well-cast as Ethan and his wife Zeena. But I don't think the finished product comes close to doing justice to the book, which is about how people get trapped in lives that are half-deaths.

Among the many faults: Replacing the book's narrator, a sympathetic surveyor, with an annoying preacher who keeps complaining that people behave better back in Boston, works against the film. The direction makes the hypochondriac Zeena, whom Ethan married out of guilt after she cared for his dying mother, too attractive and sympathetic. The audience's sympathies should lie firmly with Mattie and Ethan. Zeena is really a spectre of doom in the book, and Joan Allen is capable of having played her that way. Patricia Arquette plays Mattie as a squeaky, silly young thing; her nervous twittery giggle is excruciating! She's far from the Mattie of the book, a vibrant, worthy object of Ethan's longing for warmth and life. The direness of Ethan's poverty is not fully exposed. You don't get the depth of desperation that drives the lovers to prefer death to separation. The  cruel twist of fate at the end of the book is only hinted at.

I gave it two stars because it's a nice movie to look at and I liked Liam Neeson's work, but overall a disappointment. Wharton's novels all focus on their characters' inner lives in a way that makes filming challenging, but Martin Scorsese managed to capture her world in a very alive way in ""The Age of Innocence."" Unfortunately that level of film-making skill is not on view here.",1405987200,,1744,4.826086956521739

515934,4,6302805406,"I read the book recently for a bookclub meeting, & wanted to see how the movie handled the same subject.  I like Liam Neeson,
but wondered how some of the themes, like sexual tension, would be portrayed so many years after the book was published (1911).  In many ways the film followed the book closely, especially in the over-all events, but since the strong sexual tensions
in the book were never released by actual consumation, the addition of a sex scene between the 2 principles was inappropriate;
even had the early 20th c. approved of an actual ""fleshly"" relationship between them, the maintenance of their desire as
unconsumated was much more consistent with the book's main theme--what people (especially the poor) could have, & what
they could not, & what they could not have was freedom to make their own choices.  Duty, in the moral sense, was paramount.
Thus, although I'm glad I saw this film, some of the authenticity was lost in the irrelevant loss of the tension that dominates every
page of the (powerful) book; this tension cannot, however, survive the gratuitous scene added to pander to the 20th-c.

515935,5,6302805406,"A visually beautiful production of Edith Wharton's classic book, filmed before Liam Neeson was a household word.  His performance of a man with long-suppressed sensuality living an emotionally barren existence is riveting.  Trapped in a cold, emotionless marriage with an irritable, complaining wife who suffers from a mystery illnesses, his life is transformed by the arrival of a live-in helper from his wife's family.  Their slowly developing romance nearly jumps off the screen, & it's obvious Liam was a gifted actor destined for greatness.

If you're not familiar with the book there's a surprise ending.  For Liam Neeson fans this one's a testament to his superior acting chops.  I believe any movie fan will enjoy this production of ""Ethan Frome"".",1394409600,,755,5.25

515981,3,6302805406,"If a film was meant to depress its viewers and it succeeds and you are depressed by it, should you give it a low rating? If you would have liked that the hero in the film is happy at the end and he is not, but his sorrow fits in with the plot, do you have the right to complain? What if you are told in high school that the book is one that you should read and you find that it is well written and causes you to think, but is not the kind of book that you would have preferred reading, is the teacher wrong? All of these things applied to me about this film adaptation of a famous book.

I gave it only three stars, not because it depressed me or that I did not like its ending or because I like non-depressing films, but because I think that the movie moved much too slow. The acting is very good and the plot is an almost ""everyman-type"" of plot, but it develops at snail's pace.

I say ""everyman-type"" plot because I see the simple slightly educated Ethan Frome experiencing what all-to-many people experience. They go through life being drawn by forces outside themselves, not doing what they want to do, but what others see as right for them. Then sometimes they are lucky. Something happens to draw them out of their lethargy. They realize that this life of theirs is not what they want; they could have something better. Some snatch the chance and succeed making a better life for themselves and others. But other people, most people, like Ethan Frome fail, and life is even worse.

516034,2,6302805406,"The 1993 British-American television production ETHAN FROME is an adaptation of Edith Wharton's 1911 novel about star-crossed lovers in late 19th-century Massachusetts. Though Wharton was a wealthy New York socialite, she had glimpses of New England village life, and it was the harsh winters, dire poverty and cruel gossip of this region that she sought to portray. The eponymous character (played by Liam Neeson) is a young farmer in the fictional Massachusetts community of Starkfield, whose dreams of making something of himself are dashed by the early death of his parents and then his marriage to the sickly Zenobia ""Zeena"" Frome (Joan Allen). When Zeena's cousin beautiful cousin Mattie Silver (Patricia Arquette) comes to help out in the house, Ethan's heart is thawed, but ultimately the uncompromising conditions of Starkfield life bring Ethan and Mattie to a tragedy.

The plot of a pair of star-crossed lovers is rather overdone, but ETHAN FROME is interesting in its depiction of a Massachusetts village in the late 19th century, complete with characters speaking in dialect and a description of country farmhouses. This adaptation does a decent job of presenting those strengths of the novel. It also offers an improvement on the novel in that it tweaks Wharton's risible climax -- Ethan and Mattie deciding to escape this cruel world by sledding down a hill into a big elm tree, the stupidest means of suicide in all of literature -- to be more believable.

The adaption is flawed, however, by a number of factors. One is the decision to change the framing story of Wharton's novel. In the book, the visitor to Starkfield who spurs the flashback is an engineer who wonders why Frome is so taciturn. In this film, however, the visitor is the town's new preacher, just out of seminary, who protests against Frome being shunned by the town. Wharton's portrayal of a man who walls himself off by the world after multiple tragedies is replaced, then, by an element completely unknown to the novel: the castigation of the villagers as ignoring basic Christian charity. This has consequences for the ending, which is much less powerful than the novel. Another unwelcome change is that Ethan and Mattie sleep together, while in Wharton's novel the characters seem incapable under their dire circumstances of having even a physical relationship. Also, Liam Neeson offers some of the best acting in the film, but he's 10 years too old to play this role.

I first saw this film when it was shown on PBS nearly two decades ago, and it works well enough as passive entertainment on television, but this is a second-rate affair in many ways and I cannot recommend getting the DVD.",1332028800,,2681,4.979910714285714

All three put out stellar performances, in my opinion.  However, of the three, Joan Allen had the greatest impact on me.  I positively loathed her character; the manipulative, whining, self-absorbed female whose goal in life seemed to be to make her poor husband miserable. I'm not sure I ever saw her in another film until I bought the Bourne trilogy.  When she showed up in The Bourne Supremacy, my first thought was...Oh no, not that witch, and after watching (repeatedly) the two Bourne films in which she is featured, my conclusion is that in neither of those two films, as in the Ethan Frome movie, does she display a great range of emotion, but what she does, she does magnificently. As does Liam Neeson, whose portrayal of a simple late-19th/early-20th-century New Englander lingers all these years later. Patricia Arquette's character is only slightly more likable than Ms. Allen's, and although her performance was convincing, I found her just a bit more conniving than the story-line attempted to portray.

516042,5,6302805406,"Some of your critics are very harsh to a lovely masterpiece.  Yes, it is different, in ways, from the book, but that takes nothing away from the value of the movie.  I love the book, a top three, for the way it tells a tragedy with such perfection in language, character, and place.  The movie does likewise.

Liam Neeson becomes Ethan!  In subtle, tender ways, he makes this fascinating, yet simple character come to life.  Mattie brings a joy to the bleak existence Ethan lives.  One understands how her character can bring Ethan to life, when he faces such a dour wife and unforgiving landscape.  One is glued to the screen as the story unfolds.

The music, both yearning and laced with a sense of the tragic, is perfectly written for the film.  Finally, the landscape reaches the same goal as it does in the book - it becomes another character in the tragedy.

516085,5,6302805406,"I read the book by Edith Wharton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ethan-Frome-Signet-Classics/dp/0451531310/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ethan Frome (Signet Classics)</a>&nbsp;many years ago and did not realize that there was a film adaptation of the book until I came across the DVD at my local library. Seeing Liam Neeson on the cover prompted me to check it out as I admire his talent and I was not disappointed. Though the film adaptation is not a faithful retelling of Wharton's story, the main actors do an excellent job in their respective roles so as to make this a truly compelling and heartbreaking romantic drama.

The film is basically a story within a story, which is also employed in the book. A young and idealistic new minister arrives in the rural town of Starkfield, Massachusetts sometime at the turn of the 20th century. He sees a crippled man hobbling along in the snow and wonders why this man seems so isolated and alone, bereft of friends. It is only later that his housekeeper tells him the tragic story of Ethan Frome. Viewers are then taken via flashback to the past, about 20 or so years earlier, when Ethan Frome (Liam Neeson) is portrayed as a strapping young man who is burying his mother. His distant cousin, Zeena (Joan Allen) has been staying with them, nursing his mother until her death, and faced with the prospect of losing someone who has helped him in his time of need, Ethan marries Zeena. Their marriage however is not a success - five years later, there are no children, and Zeena has become a hypocondriac, who seems to catch any ailment there is to be caught. She persuades Ethan to allow another cousin, Hattie Silver (Patricia Arquette), a poor orphan to come and live with them. The objective is to get Hattie to help out with chores for free (a common enough custom for the time when impoverished relatives would be taken in to effectively work as household help).

Well, over a period of time, the initially sickly-looking Hattie blossoms into a vibrant beauty who enjoys dances and Ethan finds himself increasingly drawn to her vivacity, a stark contrast to his own sickly and taciturn wife. Zeena senses the growing affection between Ethan and Hattie and predictably disapproves and becomes even meaner and cruel. When Zeena decides to replace Hattie, the doomed lovers are driven to a desperate act that has catastrophic consequences for all.

I felt Liam Neeson excelled in his role as the sad and isolated cripple, who seems to have sunk into submission in the present - in stark contrast to his younger days. Joan Allen plays the role of mean and calculating Zeena with credibility and conviction. As for Arquette, she is tolerable in her role, but not very compelling. Perhaps this is due to my own bias, having read the book and not 'seen' the Hattie I pictured in the book being credibly played by Arquette.

The fictional town of Starkside is well depicted here with a high sense of realism - the harsh winter landscape paints a bleak picture that accentuates the flaws inherent in the characters. The score goes well with the story and I think this is a wonderful adaptation of Wharton's story, even though it does take liberties (there is no sex in the book, unlike the movie).

But if you have read Wharton's classic novelette, one of the finest pieces of work, you would dislike this movie immensely.  Wharton was born in 1862 and died in 1937 at 75 years.  She won a Pulitzer Prize in Literature for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Age-of-Innocence/dp/1593080743/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Age of Innocence</a>.

With a unique writing style, one that absorbs the reader into deeper thoughts and greater description, fine prose, and without rushing through the plot.

The 1993 film's cinematography was beautiful, characters were nothing memorable and the focus of the story was missing, the intense relationships, the gravity of suspense, the extent of the deeper personalities we so became used to.  Liam Neeson does a decent job at playing Ethan, but we really miss what and who Zeena, Mattie and Ethan are all about.  The book is not about sex or lurid romance, it is subtle.  That is what needs to come across in a Wharton based movie, and Hollywood doesn't do that, and you can't expect them to.  And reading the book, one can instantly recognizes ""movie scenes"", predicting which scenes Hollywood will use.  Ethan Frome is not meant for the big screen!

516089,2,6302805406,"CAUTION:  SPOILER ALERT!

Ethan Frome is the most poignant, beautiful, tragic story I've ever read, and is by far Edith Wharton's best work.  Yet somehow, despite the fact that Liam Neeson plays the title role and does very well,  the filmmakers managed to do a poor job conveying this story.

The decision to replace the book's level-headed, sympathetic introducer of the story with a whiny-voiced, invasive preacher was ridiculous.  Patricia Arquette's rendition of Mattie Silver(my favorite female character of all time!!) was completely wrong, although she did have a few good moments.  Arquette didn't have the dark hair or the luminous beauty of Mattie, and her acting did almost no justice whatsoever to Mattie's simple but profound character.  The nervous laughing in particular drove me crazy.  Mattie needs to be portrayed by someone who can fully express her personality -- so warm, intelligent, and vibrant against the wintry cold setting and Ethan's equally frigid wife, Zeena.  Ethan's character also needed further exploring through better dialogue and visual story-telling.

Joan Allen was pitch perfect as Zeena, Ethan's abominable hypochondriac wife.  If they ever do another film version of this story, I'd want to bring her back.  But again, they needed to play up Zeena's manipulative, vindictive, withholding, and silently watchful side even more than they did in order to increase the tension in the household as Ethan and Mattie become increasingly inseparable.

There are two things that I take the most serious issue with in this film.  One -- Mattie and Ethan do NOT have sex in the book.  At any time.  They kiss, in one of the most sensual moments in all of literature, but they do not have sex, Wharton makes it quite clear.  Which is why their story is so pure, so poignant, so frustrated, and so desperate.  And in this film, they do sleep together, twice.  One of those scenes is an appropriately sensual, tense moment, and the other is very sad and desperate but also very... weird and somewhat disturbing.  But my point is that changing a crucial factor of the plotline and character development works against the film -- if they were looking for greater intensity, they actually undercut it.  Ethan and Mattie sleeping together, especially with so little on-screen development of their romance, makes their love story look more like a lust story and takes away the gorgeous tension of the book.

Which brings me to number two -- the build-up to the lovers' attempted suicide is the most  emotionally intense literature I have ever read.  The film needs to make it clear that Ethan and Mattie are blocked at every turn by grinding poverty and social boundaries from being able to escape together.  A screen adaptation of this book needs to make their love so palpable, so fathomless, that the audience completely understands that they have no alternative BUT suicide if they want to stay together.  And then that scene needs to be tremendous.

There were other things that needed to be made perfectly clear, as well -- especially the state of Mattie's mental and physical condition at the end of the story.  This film version doesn't make it clear that she is made a quadraplegic with a completely changed personality through the head trauma she experienced in the accident.  That is the most horrible sorrow of the entire book, and it needs to be emphasized in order to show the terribleness of Ethan's suffering.

Finally, this book reads like the most gorgeous cinema you could ever encounter -- and a film version ABSOLUTELY MUST be visually stunning, drawn-out, and poignant with the most sumptuous direction, cast, cinematography, color palette, and music that can be found.  And this version just didn't cut it, I'm very sorry to say.",1226361600,54,3776,4.992

516104,1,6302805406,"The book Ethan Frome was incredibly good: the environment was created as a character, the people were characterized amazingly, and Edith Wharton (the author) forced sympathy toward Ethan and Mattie's ""affair"", which never extended beyond a kiss.

The movie is horrible. Patricia Arquette appears to need speech therapy, and Liam Neeson's ""limp"" is more hilarious than telling. Their affair is much less believable, and by the end of the book, the only character that seems to be worthwhile is Zeena. Poor acting skills, poor script, and poor filming techniques all contribute to one horrible movie.

It's too bad, really. They are quite good actors otherwise; this movie is just absolutely horrible.

The direction here is as good as it gets, since some of the scenes--which are not much to tell to a block-headed high-school boy--come alive in astonishing ways.  Patricia Arquette is amazing, so shy and appealing, hardly recognizable from her other roles.  Her singing a little song over the stove is enchanting, and it is easy to see how she steals the heart of her listener.  Many other scenes are equally memorable, and the acting is superb from all quarters.  It really feels like returning to that tiny Massachusetts town long ago.  If you categorically can't abide dark wintry tragedies, then flee this one also.  But if you really want to feel how a tragedy unfolds, including the joy that underlies it, then this is your ticket.

516107,2,6302805406,"During her Warner years, Bette Davis constantly lobbied the studio to let her play Mattie in a film of ETHAN FROME.  Jack Warner was sure no one would care to see such hopeless material filmed, no matter how starry or surefooted the treatment.  On the basis of this plodding version, I have to agree with Jack.  American Playhouse's theatrical wing has managed to turn the book every high school student hated (Wharton's novella has done more to kill the idea of reading for pleasure for generations of students than any literary work since SILAS MARNER was thrust upon an unwary world) into a picture that's more grim duty than pleasure.  A game cast struggles to animate Richard Nelson's bare-bones screenplay, but they're soon defeated, lost in an endless progression of drab scenes that sit there, inert, rather than smouldering with emotional subtext, as presumably was intended.  Neeson and Allen come off rather better than Patricia Arquette; very attractive in other films, she seems slackjawed and dimwitted here.  A pleasure to see Katharine Houghton, aging well and in there pitching in a thankless role.

516109,2,6302805406,"Ethan Fromme is a great romance book, however as books to movies go, this is one of the worst.  Most of the facts were there, but there were added details, and a few missing things which just destroyed the message portrayed in the book.
In the book, Ethan's crippled condition is only barely highlited, yet in the movie, it is dragged out to almost hillarious proportions.  This reduces the novels intended effect on viewers of the movie, as the fact that it is supposed to seem almost a punishment on Ethan is lost almost completely.  Zeena, the lifeless doll which we see with a certain sense of dread at her introduction in the novel, is a beautiful young woman when she appears in the movie, with only a little less charm later on, when, in the events of the novel, she is supposed to seem almost like death itself.  Zeena in the movie is constantly portrayed as being not as bad as we are led to see in the book, therefore making us care for her and almost wonder why Ethan would want to have an affair when he has such a 'good' wife.  Also, the character of Mattie, an innocent, vivacious character in the novel, is portrayed as a flirtatious... and almost instigates the affair more than Ethan.  In the novel, Ethan is the one who truely begins everything, secretly longing for her, but never able to express his feelings to her until he fears she will be gone.
All these changes destroy the tone with which the author of the book adressed Ethan, and ruined the message that we were supposed to get out of her work.  Instead of feeling for the characters of Ethan and Mattie as the evil Zeena destroys Ethan, we feel a sense of disgust at Mattie and Ethan's affair.  While the movie was true to the book in many ways, it was the ways in which it wasn't that make this movie sub-par, and almost disgraceful to the book.",1076544000,18,1825,4.410714285714286
