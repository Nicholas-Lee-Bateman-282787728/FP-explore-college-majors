8461190,4,B0057Z22VI,"""Resisting Enemy Interrogation"" was made in the US Army's ""Fort Roach"", which was the old Hal Roach Studios in Hollywood that was taken over by the military for the purpose of making war-related films. They made instructional movies, morale-boosting movies for the public, etc. They took the dry and boring military instructional films and made them much better through use of high quality acting, production, and writing. ""Resisting Enemy Interrogation"" is a classic example of this approach, and it was nominated for an Oscar in the category of Best Documentary Feature.

The movie tells the story of the members of a downed Allied aircraft crew who are sent to a German chateau for special interrogation. The Germans believe that their likely base of origin, Naples, is planning a larger raid against a German industrial target, and since these are the only crew members available to them, everything these flyers might know about the upcoming raid must be learned, and learned quickly. The script is based on the experiences of two American airmen who had been held and interrogated in a similar situation, then escaped to tell their tale. The set designers modeled the interior of the chateau on the airmen's memories, and the tactics of the German interrogators is also based on those used by the enemy. The chateau is only shown once from the outside, where the crew is trucked to the site, and this scene is actually filmed against a backdrop made by photographically enlarging a postcard photo of the actual building (I have to admit, as I watched this scene, I was thinking about the comment from Monty Python's Holy Grail, ""It's only a model!"").

According to the article, ""World War II: The Movie"", in the Smithsonian Air & Space magazine (March 2012), the production of this particular feature film created ""....a palpable buzz. Kind of like in a regular motion picture studio, ...you get involved with a film that everybody, the cameramen, electricians and the gaffers, the cutters, everybody, and the actors, know they got one. Everybody feels it and gets excited.""

""The film's purpose is to show airmen-in-training how wily [the enemy] interrogators can be, and how catastrophic the consequences of talking."" This movie will grab you from the first scenes, and hold your attention. All aspects from script, acting, production quality, musical score, are all done with the highest quality Hollywood was capable of at the time.

I thought that the actors playing the Germans were very convincing, and many spoke excellent German (maybe they were originally from Germany). The actors playing the five flyers also do an excellent job, each playing a 'different type' of man in the interrogators' views, and we see the Germans deliberatong on how to best approach each man's interrogation to crack him not only quickly, but with the best hope of gleaning useful and critical information. We see how easily each man can be tricked into giving up information, usually without knowing it, and how the Germans hold several meetings to piece together that they have learned so far and how to fine tune the rest of the interrogations as time quickly runs out.

This DVD comes from the Ron Irwin collection, which is building a library of 'on-demand' classic videos that cannot be obtained elsewhere, and the DVD is apparently 'burned on demand' when ordered from Amazon. The DVD has a nice printed top side (some sort of thermal transfer or silk screen, NOT a label), but it is still a recorded DVD. The video quality is fairly clean, but not great. The picture is often rather fuzzy or slightly out of focus, and this might be due to the tortured path the video have taken over the decades. I don't see any evidence of it being remastered. However, I soon forgot about the video quality and was captivated by this thrilling educational video that does not seem at all like an educational video.

This should be a 'Must' for all people who like WWII films, adventure and suspense films, etc.",1329696000,3,3997,4.922848664688427
