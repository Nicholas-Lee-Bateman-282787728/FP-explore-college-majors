3056287,5,B0010YVC9S,"I grew up on Scooby Do, faithfully watching the cartoons every Saturday morning. So, when I saw there was an update on Boomerang, I was skeptical...until I saw them.

Love these! The characters are updated but not so much that they're unrecognizable - they're still the characters I knew, loved, and grew up with. And they have some fun with the formula in a few episodes that are sure to make you laugh.

If you're an old fan like me, you won't be disappointed.",1263686400,4,462,4.488095238095238

3056364,5,B0010YVC9S,Scooby Doo is great in these movies. I would love to be able to purchase the rest of the Scooby Doo Show that was made back in 1969. I have some of them on the Third Season but there are more out there to have. Also the New Scooby Doo Mysteries that were made back in 1984. Where are these great movies!!!!!!!,1422748800,,309,4.0

3056368,5,B0010YVC9S,"I love Mystery Inc and this is it's forerunner.  The new Scooby Doo cartoons are creepier than the old ones and have the same mindless chase scenes, but they are much better than the original in writing and animation.",1411344000,,217,4.564102564102564
3056369,3,B0010YVC9S,"Kids like it, but it seems a little silly that this is more than if you buy them individually.",1409443200,,94,4.0
3056370,5,B0010YVC9S,"Each season consisted of 13 episodes and a special holiday episode. These are the bonus episodes contained in each dvd set. They are however all mixed up. The Christmas episode, on the third season disc, is actually from the first season. The valentines day episode, found on the first season disc, is from the third season. The Halloween episode, however, is from the second season and also contained on that disc. Not sure why the other two are mixed up. There's no continuity in this show so it makes no difference, just thought collectors would like to know.

This is a great series, second only to the original Where Are You! series. Each season contains a special episode for die-hard scooby fans, like in the first season when we learn the origin of the mystery machine. Or in the second season, when the Hex girls appear once again, and in the third season when there's a flashback to A Pup Named Scooby-Doo! Those were all really neat to see, having seen every episode of the classic scooby, and all the recent DTV films.",1409184000,,1030,4.628415300546448
3056371,5,B0010YVC9S,"Great Show, even better than the originals in my opinion, my kids love it.  The theme song is great, the stories are up to date, and they move along quickly, and keep you interested.  I bought this set and my kids just love it.",1399161600,,227,4.136363636363637

3056398,4,B0010YVC9S,"I bought these for my 6 year old. I figured I would go with the 2nd generation for graphics. While the graphics are good and the characters have same core values the ""ghosts"" are too much not ghosts. The bring in robots and animals and a fun house. Not nearly as much pulling of masks. But still a great purchase for newer generations",1369094400,,334,4.317460317460317
3056399,4,B0010YVC9S,I have two grand children who have gotten hooked on Scooby Doo. We bought a cheap DVD locally and they have practically worn it our.

3056412,5,B0010YVC9S,"As I've stated before I have been a die-hard fan of Scooby-Doo since I was a toddler, and I must say that What's New, Scooby-Doo? is a fun and entertaining remake of the original, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! TV show. The animation is stellar, the episodes are just laugh out loud hilarious, and the casting is great: Mindy Cohn (Facts of Life, anyone?) plays Velma. The Special Features are awesome, you even get bonus episodes. This has gotta be the best buck I've ever spent, and I won't regret it. I watch this show almost every day, and I don't get tired of it. If you and your whole family are avid SD fans, check out WNSD, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",1361318400,,653,4.360655737704918
3056413,5,B0010YVC9S,"I didn't think that What's new Scooby Doo would be any good until I bought Scooby Doo Chills And Thrills Holiday 2012.  There were a couple of episodes there.  I liked it, quite a bit surprisingly, so I ordered the entire series for a great deal at Amazon.  The packaging was a nice job.  And the entire series was watchable.  no scratches.  Ordering through Amazon is always a trust worthy source and the free super savings shipping and handling is always a good thing for $25 and over order total.",1360540800,3,499,4.488888888888889
3056414,5,B0010YVC9S,This was a birthday gift for my 6 year old grandson. He has become quite the Scooby-Doo fan and has been thoroughly enjoying watching the DVDs.,1359504000,,143,4.538461538461538
3056415,3,B0010YVC9S,"We were looking for something for our avid Scooby fan. This new version is not my favorite, mainly because the soundtrack drives me crazy.",1353801600,,138,4.791666666666667

3056418,4,B0010YVC9S,"I have to say, as far as scooby doo goes, ""Scooby-Doo Where are You?!"" was probably the absolute best of them all, but with all of the remake failures and pathetic straying, this really resets the standrd for scooby doo. I have to say, this is as far away from the original as I prefer to go. Just the right amount of cartoonishism, with a dab of elden day reminders. The only con is...WHERE is Fred's ascot?!?!?",1328486400,8,412,4.363636363636363
3056419,5,B0010YVC9S,My grandson really loves the Scooby-Doo series.  Since a DVD is hard to find in regular stores I was delighted to purchase it through Amazon.  We recieved the DVD in record time and he's practically worn it out all ready.,1326499200,,221,4.5

3056443,5,B0010YVC9S,"As a person who viewed the original Scooby Doo episodes as a child, I am watching my boys (7 and 4) get just as much enjoyment from the show.  As a parent viewing the updated versions with my kids I like the plots (relevant to today) and the new music works well-I agree with other reviewers who say this is a successful updated version of Scooby-Doo. I like how Daphne is not portrayed as ""ditsy"" when compared with the original version.",1294444800,7,438,4.407407407407407
3056444,4,B0010YVC9S,"This is a great modern day update of the classic Scooby cast and format of the show. I consider the pros and cons as follows...

Pros

- No Scrappy-Doo
- The modern animation techniques give everything a sharp polished look
- The self-deprecating humor and in-jokes in some of the episodes are nice touches
- Daphne has been given some brains and isn't just there taking up space
- Shaggy still voiced by Casey Kasem

Cons

- Fred seems to have been dumbed down quite a bit. While it could be said he's more 'fun' now, he's not quite the brave intelligent leader from the originals series.
- While a voiceover genius, even Frank Welker can't quite do Scooby as well as the late Don Messick, which might explain why Scooby doesn't seem to get much dialog at all.
- The series seem a lot lighter in setting than the original series (lots of day based episodes). It's not quite as dark and spooky, and the music not as atmospheric.
- The series follows the unfortunate (to me) format of the musical interlude mid episode. Made worse by the fact that the music here is very average punk/ska.

All in all though, very much a great update of a classic series, sticking pretty closely to the original, well worth a look.",1294185600,15,1213,4.470588235294118

3056447,5,B0010YVC9S,"My son (2 1/2) loves Scooby Doo, and so do I.  We really enjoy the What's New Scooby Doo episodes and buying the complete seasons was the most cost efficient option.  Delivery was quick, no complaints and I will order more from Amazon.",1290038400,,235,4.441860465116279
3056448,5,B0010YVC9S,"I grew up watching Scooby-Doo cartoons on Saturday morning and I still love watching the original series (thanks to the Boomerang network).  This series was updated but managed to retain the charm of the original.  I consider it the first true successor to the original series as it stuck to the familiar concept of solving mysteries (those meddling kids).  The animation and music is great (the theme song is sung by Simple Plan).  Frank Welker reprised his role as voice of Fred (Jones) and Casey Kasem as the voice of Shaggy (Rogers). Thankfully, no Scrappy-Doo or other silliness like some of the Scooby related shows.  Even the current show: Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, which is nice to look at but the story with Velma and Shaggy now having a secret relationship is bizarre.

Back to What's New Scooby-Doo... For such a great show, I'm shocked that it only lasted three seasons.  It is a cartoon the whole family can watch, which is getting harder and harder to find.

FYI: For some reason (as of 9/29/10), it is much cheaper to buy the individual seasons than to buy the Complete Series...",1285718400,29,1102,4.7936507936507935

For my money, some of the original charm is missing from this new set, but hey I guess that's what happens when a 40-year old series is updated. Even so, ""What's New Scooby Doo"" is great fun for youngsters and preferable to many TV shows on a Saturday morning. Recommended.",1285372800,3,432,4.4125

3290861,5,B0010YVC9S,Scooby Doo is great in these movies. I would love to be able to purchase the rest of the Scooby Doo Show that was made back in 1969. I have some of them on the Third Season but there are more out there to have. Also the New Scooby Doo Mysteries that were made back in 1984. Where are these great movies!!!!!!!,1422748800,,309,4.0

3290867,5,B0010YVC9S,"Each season consisted of 13 episodes and a special holiday episode. These are the bonus episodes contained in each dvd set. They are however all mixed up. The Christmas episode, on the third season disc, is actually from the first season. The valentines day episode, found on the first season disc, is from the third season. The Halloween episode, however, is from the second season and also contained on that disc. Not sure why the other two are mixed up. There's no continuity in this show so it makes no difference, just thought collectors would like to know.

This is a great series, second only to the original Where Are You! series. Each season contains a special episode for die-hard scooby fans, like in the first season when we learn the origin of the mystery machine. Or in the second season, when the Hex girls appear once again, and in the third season when there's a flashback to A Pup Named Scooby-Doo! Those were all really neat to see, having seen every episode of the classic scooby, and all the recent DTV films.",1409184000,,1030,4.628415300546448

TV show. The animation is stellar, the episodes are just laugh out loud hilarious, and the casting is great: Mindy Cohn (Facts of Life, anyone?) plays Velma. The Special Features are awesome, you even get bonus episodes. This has gotta be the best buck I've ever spent, and I won't regret it. I watch this show almost every day, and I don't get tired of it.

3290915,4,B0010YVC9S,"I have to say, as far as scooby doo goes, ""Scooby-Doo Where are You?!"" was probably the absolute best of them all, but with all of the remake failures and pathetic straying, this really resets the standrd for scooby doo. I have to say, this is as far away from the original as I prefer to go. Just the right amount of cartoonishism, with a dab of elden day reminders. The only con is...WHERE is Fred's ascot?!?!?",1328486400,8,412,4.363636363636363

As a parent viewing the updated versions with my kids I like the plots (relevant to today) and the new music works well-I agree with other reviewers who say this is a successful updated version of Scooby-Doo. I like how Daphne is not portrayed as ""ditsy"" when compared with the original version.",1294444800,7,438,4.407407407407407
3290941,4,B0010YVC9S,"This is a great modern day update of the classic Scooby cast and format of the show. I consider the pros and cons as follows...

Pros

- No Scrappy-Doo
- The modern animation techniques give everything a sharp polished look
- The self-deprecating humor and in-jokes in some of the episodes are nice touches
- Daphne has been given some brains and isn't just there taking up space
- Shaggy still voiced by Casey Kasem

Cons

- Fred seems to have been dumbed down quite a bit. While it could be said he's more 'fun' now, he's not quite the brave intelligent leader from the originals series.
- While a voiceover genius, even Frank Welker can't quite do Scooby as well as the late Don Messick, which might explain why Scooby doesn't seem to get much dialog at all.
- The series seem a lot lighter in setting than the original series (lots of day based episodes). It's not quite as dark and spooky, and the music not as atmospheric.
- The series follows the unfortunate (to me) format of the musical interlude mid episode. Made worse by the fact that the music here is very average punk/ska.

All in all though, very much a great update of a classic series, sticking pretty closely to the original, well worth a look.",1294185600,15,1213,4.470588235294118

3290945,5,B0010YVC9S,"I grew up watching Scooby-Doo cartoons on Saturday morning and I still love watching the original series (thanks to the Boomerang network).  This series was updated but managed to retain the charm of the original.  I consider it the first true successor to the original series as it stuck to the familiar concept of solving mysteries (those meddling kids).  The animation and music is great (the theme song is sung by Simple Plan).  Frank Welker reprised his role as voice of Fred (Jones) and Casey Kasem as the voice of Shaggy (Rogers). Thankfully, no Scrappy-Doo or other silliness like some of the Scooby related shows.  Even the current show: Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, which is nice to look at but the story with Velma and Shaggy now having a secret relationship is bizarre.

Back to What's New Scooby-Doo... For such a great show, I'm shocked that it only lasted three seasons.  It is a cartoon the whole family can watch, which is getting harder and harder to find.

FYI: For some reason (as of 9/29/10), it is much cheaper to buy the individual seasons than to buy the Complete Series...",1285718400,29,1102,4.7936507936507935

For my money, some of the original charm is missing from this new set, but hey I guess that's what happens when a 40-year old series is updated. Even so, ""What's New Scooby Doo"" is great fun for youngsters and preferable to many TV shows on a Saturday morning. Recommended.",1285372800,3,432,4.4125
