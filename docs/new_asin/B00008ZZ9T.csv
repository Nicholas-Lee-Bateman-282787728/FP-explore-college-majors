7988445,5,B00008ZZ9T,Billy Wilder was one comic genius. Quality is good. What's not to like?,1490140800,,71,4.538461538461538
7988446,5,B00008ZZ9T,"They don't make movies like this anymore
These are the types of movies you could watch with your entire family
Young and Old will appreciate these clean cut comedies",1372032000,,165,4.724137931034483
7988447,5,B00008ZZ9T,"Really, really, really enjoying the DVDs in this collection. I bought this because I wanted to own The Apartment and Irma la Douce, decided to splurge on the whole set. First movie I saw was Avanti! and it was very good. It is a Golden Globe winner. Have also enjoyed the Sherlock Holmes and the Dean Martin movie (good campy 1960s movie).",1327449600,4,339,4.483870967741935
7988448,3,B00008ZZ9T,"No Thanks...
This is not a complete collection.
The 'April Fools' In Cinemascope 1969 is missing and Billy Wilder's last movie  'Buddy Buddy' with Jack and Walter in Cinemascope is also missing. Get these on PAL and Have them Tranferred for a complete collection or just wait and wait and wait for Sony or whoever to make up their mind.",1326672000,,336,4.6
7988449,2,B00008ZZ9T,"One hundred and seven US Dollars!  No thanks Amazon.com.  I went to Amazon. UK and got the PAL region 2 versions of The Billy Wilder Collection (Vol.'s 1 and 2) for 20 pounds. You can use your Amazon.com account and even with the extra shipping costs to the USA, you'll save over $60.  Current price at Amazon.co.uk for both boxsets is 20 pounds 38 pence(10 pounds 19 pence each set).  These two sets together also contain 'The Seven Year Itch' which isn't in the above region 1 set and as the region 2 sets are also released by MGM I'm sure the image sources will be the same and therefore the image quality identical.  Do yourself a favour and ALWAYS check Amazon.co.uk before buying something on Amazon.com!

Zero stars for the price, 4 and a half stars for 'Witness for the Prosecution' and 'The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes' - total = 2 stars",1274054400,7,850,4.487012987012987
7988450,5,B00008ZZ9T,This is a great collection of films by the great director Billy Wilder.  And a great price to boot!,1264809600,2,99,4.2105263157894735
7988451,4,B00008ZZ9T,"Sunset Boulevard, Some Like it Hot, Stalag 17, Double Indemnity. No, they're not here. But The Apartment and Avanti are. And even a few so-so ones here are worth your time. Plus, look at that cute Mr Magoo-like graphic of Billy Wilder on the box's cover. Complete opposite of the tough, hard-working little genius the guy was.",1237161600,3,326,4.7368421052631575
7988452,5,B00008ZZ9T,"Every single one of these films (excluding Irma la Douce) is worth seeing, and more than a few of them are masterpieces.  The masterpieces:  The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, Kiss Me Stupid, One Two Three.  The very good:  Witness for the Prosecution, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes.  The merely ""good"":  Avanti.  The average:  The Fortune Cookie.  The embarrassment:  Irma la Douce.  If you are a fan of Billy Wilder, this is a must.",1207440000,5,438,4.706666666666667
7988453,5,B00008ZZ9T,"For Billy Wilder fans, this is a must.  Get this box set now before it is discontinued now that Sony distributes MGM's library.",1140739200,13,127,4.521739130434782
