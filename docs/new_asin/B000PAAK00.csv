2814749,5,B000PAAK00,This was a well organized program.  Being from San Antonio I am sorry it wasn't longer!  I probably would not have felt this way if I were from elsewhere!,1199577600,,154,4.275862068965517
2814750,1,B000PAAK00,"I am truly a spurs fan, but I am not a fan of the NBA dvds. However, I fault the NBA for getting me hooked, because the 2002-2003 dvd not only had extras but also the fourth quarter of the winning games for each of the Spur's playoff series. Its great to watch when Stoudiamer and the
Suns get their but kicked, Fisher and Kobe crying after the Spurs demolish the Lakers, Kerr's 3 point palooza in the Mavs series, Manu's steal in game six of the nets, and Stephen Jacksons unhearlded contribution. Stuff a fan might forget if they didn't have it on video. Unfortunately, 2004-2005 only had the fourth quarter of the finals leaving out some amazing games the Spurs had against the nuggets and Sonics, not to mention Hory's 3 point OT shot in game 5. How could you not have that quarter on dvd and still call it a championship edition. The 2006-2007 Dvd doesn't even have the final quarter. I am fan and a collector so I bought this junkie dvd, but I could not recommended on content this dvd  to anyone unless they are collector and fan.",1193616000,5,1037,4.373056994818653
2814751,5,B000PAAK00,"Call the Spurs boring, call them the ""asterisk"" team, call them dirty (The Spurs?  Dirty?), call them whatever as long as you call them champions!  Whoever thought that a small-market, fundamentally sound, not very exciting team led by a not very exciting superstar (Tim Duncan) would be a posible NBA dynasty?  Not very many but guess what, it's a good thing!  It's refreshing that a classy organization like the San Antinio Spurs are here to show everybody else that it isn't fancy slam dunking, showing out, tattoos, ESPN highlights, having a superstar with a fancy name or ""street cred"" that wins championships but unselfishness, fundamentals, defense and good all around team play that gets the job done!  Go Spurs Go!",1187654400,,723,4.991666666666666
2814752,5,B000PAAK00,This DvD was outstanding.  I LOVE my spurs and this DVD hit the spot in recounting thier championship season.,1187136000,,109,4.7368421052631575
2814753,3,B000PAAK00,"Let me say first off if you are a huge Spurs fan this is a must own, if for nothing else other than how often does your favorite team win a championship.  However it is the weakest of the 3 title DVD's in terms of it's content.  The chapters of the DVD are similiar to the prior DVD's they cover the Reg season the ups and downs that come with an 82 game schedule and then they transition into the playoffs.  They did a good job covering the Denver series which much like in 2005 had the Spurs losing game 1 and then winning 4 in a row.  They sucked as much drama as they could out of a 5 game series in the highlights.  However when it came time for the Suns series the DVD is all over the place.  They were fair in their take on the suspensions and the Spurs part in it but they did not deliver the drama in the highlights that was in the series.  Game 1 especially was an amazing game that had Duncan just killing everyone and he was barely featured at all in the highlights.  Game 6 same thing Duncan was the story of the game yet if you only watched the DVD and not the game you would never know that, they barely covered his play at all.  When they get to the finals it was pretty well done although i thought they tried a little too hard to make the series look competitive and tried to make Lebron look like he played well.  The bonus features are not Bad you get a couple of top ten lists one with all time great Duncan plays and another featuring 10 great highlights in the Spurs dynasty over the last 9 years.  A couple of pieces also featuring Tony on his Rookie season and Manu going back to Argentenia in 2005.  What is missing though is the clinching 4th qtrs that was in the 2003 DVD that most fans loved.  In the 2005 DVD you got game 7 of the finals 4th qtr but nothing else.  Getting all the clinching 4th qtrs of the playoffs in the 2003 DVD was probably the best part of it and i don't know why they have basically phased that out since.  So if you are Spurs fan you have to buy it, but if you are just a sports fan might want to just rent it.",1185408000,5,2064,3.9878345498783454
2814754,4,B000PAAK00,"Overall, I give the 2007 DVD a B+ because it does have some good bonus features and the main featured video is excellent.  Unlike past Spurs Championship DVD's, it DOES NOT have any ""clinching quarters"" from any playoff series.  The 2003 DVD was awesome because it had the entire fourth quarter broadcast for each Spurs close out game for every round.  Unfortunately, the 2007 DVD doesn't have this.  However, the bonus features are plentiful and well done.  The main video (featuring the recap of the season) is also very good.  It is over an hour long.  Sure, it does glaze over some key moments in the playoffs (mainly from the Utah series) but it does capture all the emotion of the season.  If you're a Spurs fan, buy it.  It's still a keeper.",1184889600,5,748,4.56390977443609
2814755,4,B000PAAK00,"I'm a big Spurs fan, but I think I can give a pretty unbiased review of this DVD.  On its own this is a pretty good video of highlights and commentary.  I think the previous DVDs (of Spurs championships) bested this one in certain ways.

What I liked:
* They included some of the drama from the regular season, when there were rumors of trading.  That really shows how much they've overcome this year.
* The series against the Nuggets and the Suns were covered pretty well.  They highlighted the dangerous combo of Iverson and Anthony.  Also, they gave plenty attention to Nash and the controversy of the suspensions.
* Despite the sweep, they made the finals against the Cavaliers feel like a real struggle.  Not to say the sweep was easy.
* The bonus features include a recap of their 1999 title, of which there was no DVD made.
* The bonus features also include highlights of Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili's careers.

What I didn't like:
* The series against the Jazz was only a footnote.  The Spurs didn't sweep them, they were blown out in game 3, Deron Williams gave his best performance of the playoffs until his injury (which should've been noted), Derek Fisher was absent during the first half of game 5 and there were two ejections.  This series deserved more than a measley 2 minute segment (yes, 2 minutes).
* I think they placed too much emphasis on Tony Parker in the finals.  Yes, he was the MVP and he deserved it.  I thought they could've mentioned more about Ginobili.  He was shut out in game 3 (excluding foul shots), his performance rivaled Parker's in game 4 and his final run and foul shots guaranteed the Spurs win.
* The last Spurs DVD showed the entire 4th quarter of the final game.  Some of the stuff I mention below could've been shoved off to make room for the final quarter of the season.
* They included a bonus section about Tony and Eva.  They were engaged and she was there all the time, but I don't think she made any important contributions to the team.
* They included highlights from the last two championships which is kind of silly.  I would've thought they'd leave that stuff out so you'd go buy the other DVDs.  I have the other DVDs already, so the previous finals highlights mean nothing to me.

The best Spurs championship DVD they could make would include every playoff game in full, but that's unrealistic.  This is definitely the next best thing though.",1184630400,15,2402,4.531322505800464
