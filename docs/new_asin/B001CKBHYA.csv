3514218,5,B001CKBHYA,I loved this movie it is funny and sweet at the same time. I will watch this movie again and again. I add this movie to my Mila Kunis collection.,1398988800,,145,3.8666666666666667
3514219,3,B001CKBHYA,"I remember seeing and being part of the live play in 2003 I believe - I remember dancing with the nun who was drunk and she never broke character - that was so amazing - it was a fun day!  On the other hand the the movie really got quite tiring.  Yes, I found some of it funny and such, but the disfunctionality of them all got to be too much.  Just to much anger for me between the characters.  On the plus side it was different then the play so that was nice to have it be like something new to me.  I don't know if this helps, so maybe  check it out for yourself, but I was glad to have seen it as I was very curious.",1252972800,,620,3.7674418604651163
3514220,5,B001CKBHYA,"Tony N' Tina's Wedding was a hilarious movie that really caught me off gaurd and kept me guessing.  I was a bit skeptical at first, and with the slow beginning.....but the moving had such a unique humor that it kept you wanting more.  Although I didn't experience this time period myself, I could see how this movie would really appeal to those who did!  I was laughing so hard sometimes....I was almost crying!  Definitely worth watching!!!",1242345600,,441,4.7631578947368425
3514221,5,B001CKBHYA,"This movie was very cute! The first 30 minutes or so was from their perspectives, so you don't even see McIntyre (Tony) or Kunis (Tina), but you hear them talking, so I thought it was supposed to be from their point of view, but then the scenes unfold and the chemistry erupts! The two main actors play off each other so well.

  Then add the explosion of the supporting cast. This is great because they all have ""conflicts"" of their own. Like the pregnant friend who is going through a midlife crisis. Also the ex boyfriend who goes nuts, well I've said too much about the plot, but if you haven't seen this movie then you are in for a surprising treat!",1230508800,4,654,4.344262295081967
3514222,5,B001CKBHYA,"Had been waiting for this movie to come out for a few years. Well worth the wait, esp for any Joe McIntyre fan. Would recommend!!!",1229472000,2,130,4.24

8288112,1,B001CKBHYA,"Poor sound quality.  I had a hard time following the conversations during most of the move.

In addition, there was no closed-caption option.

But in all fairness, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed the movie any more if I could understand what was being said.",1473638400,,259,4.586956521739131
8288113,1,B001CKBHYA,"Poorly adapted, thankfully I used credit for it but even that was a waste.",1473552000,,74,4.357142857142857
8288114,1,B001CKBHYA,"Coming from a big, Italian family, and having lots of experience with Italian weddings, I hoped this would be an ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" type comedy, but I was disappointed.

The only funny scene was the mother crying in the church, and that wasn't even very funny.  And then I waited.... and waited... but nothing else brought even a chuckle.

The acting was horrible, the plot lacking, and overall it was a bad movie.",1473465600,,421,4.739726027397261
8288115,1,B001CKBHYA,Worst movie ever...  does not even deserve a star,1473206400,,49,4.444444444444445

8288117,3,B001CKBHYA,"It was a rather predictable story line.  Not a waste of time, but nothing to rave about either.",1472860800,,95,4.277777777777778
