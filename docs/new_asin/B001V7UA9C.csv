8345552,3,B001V7UA9C,Bad video quality!,1479945600,,18,5.333333333333333
8345553,4,B001V7UA9C,"This is available in full HD on YouTube, so if you're looking for quality, this is not gonna beat HD quality. But this is a great add to your collection, the quality is DVD quality and the sound is as it was when it was aired on Showtime. I took back a star because the front looks great but the back looks like somebody used Paint to put it together.",1460764800,,351,4.0285714285714285
8345554,2,B001V7UA9C,"The video quality is really bad, even though it's 720 X 480. It's really blocky and fuzzy looking when played through a high end DVD player (Oppio BDP-93). The total size of the DVD is about 3.4GB so this was encoded at a marginal bit rate (most commercially released DVD's are about twice this size for the same time).

Wish I could return this dog. Video quality aside, her performance was ok, but the IQ of this makes it unwatchable.",1431475200,2,436,4.45
