2435249,5,B000BPL2EM,"The Flash is one of my all time favorite ""one season wonders"" although i always wished that the Flash cowl would've had a spot in costume stores next to the Batman cowl.

Sci-fi channel played the scarlet speedsters adventures back in 96 and I went nuts over it. still, my VHS tapes are wearing out and I'm looking forward to a fresh glance",1129248000,5,340,4.396825396825397
2435250,5,B000BPL2EM,"Glad to see this show finally hitting the DVD landscape.  Being able to purchase nostalgic entries from one's youth is justification in and of itself to worship the changes DVD has wrought to the home video landscape.

I loved the series, although except for the two Mark Hamill episodes I haven't seen any of them in over a decade.  Even the show turns out to not be as good as I remember (which is likely), this will have a home on my shelf.",1129248000,7,443,4.313253012048193

The following episodes have various villains and super-villains.  The episodes include illegal genetic experiments, mind control, a freeze ray, drug lords, corrupt politicians and feds, a Flash Clone, an Android, Time Travel, a Stealth Device, a villain awakening after decades of cryo sleep.,

I am a fan of superheroes and it was very exciting to have this collection at home, especially since we saw it as a young person.

When I saw the chapters again I realized that we all remember things better than they really are. Compared with the current version of Flash the scripts are a bit loose but I still enjoyed watching the series again in the company of my husband and friends making fun of the things we used to like and how we believed everything that appeared on TV.",1486339200,,480,4.263736263736264

2435344,4,B000BPL2EM,"This turned out to be more interesting than I thought.  For me the mix of nostalgia with the modern was cool.  Though when they crashed that '59 Cadillac into a pole I was ready to murder someone.  (Chuckles)  If your a car guy this is worth it just for the cars.  If your into comics and the flash its worth it as well.  My only real complaint about the writing is that the Flash is fickle when it comes to women.  He has Tina fawning over him and he ignores her to fall in love with a different girl every couple of shows.  That actually began to be distracting.  Ok onto what you want to know.  Good production value no skips or jumps.  Awesome video and sound.

Six discs with 22 episodes and no special features.  (Awesome with everything else but no special features)
Ok here's the episode list with spoilers.

Castillo blackmails Barry into becoming his secret accomplice, enabling Barry to acquire evidence of Castillo's crimes, including his plans to control the mob bosses and seize control of their business.

2435370,3,B000BPL2EM,"A friend loaned me his copy of this set when I told him I eas thinking of buying it.  My view of it is that this set is mildly entertaining but not greatly entertaining.  The acting(especially by the leads)  is good, and the special effects are very well done.  However, what hurts this series is the script writing.  The lab assistant, who works closely with the policeman who turns into the Flash, is not a realistic charcter.  The writers cannot decide if he should be comic relief or a serious ,close friend of the main character.  But the main turnoff was the romantic life of the Flash.  In the pilot, he is in love and engaged to a women, but as soon as he meets the lady doctor who works with him, the Flash loses interest in his first love.  Then the writters cannot decide if there should be a real romantic relationship between the two leads or just professional medical interest between them.  After watching this series, I have decided not to purchase it.  The series is not really bad-but it is not really good.",1471305600,,1025,4.456989247311828

2435409,5,B000BPL2EM,"Here is the the Original Scarlet Speedster. CBS's 1990-91 series was commissioned because of the popularity of Tim Burton's Batman success in 89. Danny Elfman did the theme song for the flash also and the tone of the series a bit lighter than Burton's Batman. John Wesley Shipp is an excellent Flash, Alex Dessert as Julio, Barry's co worker and best friend is great and Amanda Pays as Dr. Cristina Mcgee who is the head scientist at STAR Labs is perfect. the recurring guest Stars included Richard Belzer, Mark Hamill, Angela Bassett,  Gloria Reuben, Bryan Cranston and believe it or not Robert Shayne, Inspector Henderson from T.O.A S. that starred The Late Great George Reeves had a small recurring role as Reggie the blind newspaper vendor. As I write this review I am on disc 4 of 6 and I have seen Mr. Shayne in2 episodes so far.. I don't know why CBS did not pick this up for a 2nd season. They definitely made a huge mistake. If you like the DC Comic Universe you will really enjoy this series. As you probably may know J.W.S. plays Barry's father on the new flash and Amanda has played Dr. Mcgee on the new show also. Rumor has it that this FLASH may show up on The FLASH on the CW.  probably played again by J.W.S.In fact they actually showed him for a split second and Supergirl also as he was crossing over to earth 2.",1462233600,4,1330,4.424489795918367

2435538,4,B000BPL2EM,"I have a good friend who is attempting to collect everything superhero ever committed to TV or film.  If it weren't for him, I wouldn't even have known about The Flash, a TV show that aired on CBS from 1990-1991.  After a couple years of seeing the set sitting on his bookshelf, I borrowed it, and for the most part I enjoyed it.

The series is set in Central City and focuses on Barry Allen (John Wesley Shipp).  Barry is a police scientist who is working late in the lab one night when he is struck my lightning through a window and knocked into a bunch of chemicals.  When he wakes up, he finds himself with super speed.  It's a skill he tries to keep secret from everyone around him, including his partner in the lab and best friend Julio Mendez (Alex Desert).  Meanwhile, he starts working with Dr. Tina McGee (Amanda Pays) to try to understand the changes to his body.

But it's a good thing he has this sudden speed because Central City is about to be overrun with criminals.  From a motorcycle gang to a criminal from the 50's and an invisible man, The Flash will have his hands full.

The show was an interesting mix stylistically.  While the city streets were obviously sets, they are populated with a mix of classic and more modern cars.  It gives the series a bit of a timeless feel.  What doesn't feel so timeless are the fashions.  Can we say late 80's?  I thought we could.

Now my friend has yet to make it through the entire series because he finds it gets too cheesy as it goes along.  Personally, I felt the cheese level stayed pretty much the same.  There's some of it here and there, but usually coming from the over the top villains.  The main cast certainly keeps things realistic, and I'm including the cop characters they include in most episodes in that.  The most over the top guest star is Mark Hamill of Star Wars fame who appears in two episodes as The Trickster.  His over the top antics are pretty bad - more benefitting the 60's Batman than this show.  I'm sure that's how he was told to act, but it was a bit distracting.

The episodes themselves are certainly entertaining.  While not always the most suspenseful, I often found myself wondering just how Barry/The Flash was going to save the day.  They were certainly entertaining enough to keep me watching the next episode.

One thing I will praise the show for is the special effects.  While occasionally you can spot some trickery, for a TV show of 20+ years ago, they look good and hold up well today.  The Flash's speed running especially was well done.  I've also heard that the effects cost quite a bit of money, and that helped lead to the cancelation of this show after only the one season.

This boxed set represents everything that was made for the series.  (There are some movies out there formed from cut together episodes of the series.)  There are a total of 22 episodes, including the double length pilot.  They're all preserved in standard picture and stereo sound, which is how they originally aired.  There are no extras in the set.

While the cheese and camp got out of control a couple of times, for the most part The Flash is a fun show that can still entertain today.",1432771200,,3176,4.454861111111111

2435561,5,B000BPL2EM,"Ah, the 1990's. Not a helluva lotta good came out of that decades. It was pretty lame for the most part, especially for comic book fans. Except for this one little gem: The Flash. But, alas, many people didn't get to see much of the show.

91+2RFMQjmL._SL1500_The reason no one got to see much of it was because CBS was playing schedule roulette with the Flash, and then wouldn't even show the damn thing when it did manage to stay in one time slot for more than a week. I remember they put it up against both The Cosby Show  and The Simpsons on a Thursday night. Thursday nights were owned by NBC's sitcom block, so that was a losing proposition from the outset, and virtually guaranteed that an effects-laden, budget-heavy show was doomed. I remember at least two instances where the program was preempted for ""breaking news stories,"" meaning we missed out on 45 minutes of story (and on one night, the whole damn show). I know I missed at least three episodes when they were originally broadcast, which majorly sucked, since this show was fantastic! I heard that some of The Powers That Be at CBS went so far as to apologize to some of the cast for mucking up their chances for a hit show.

Re-watching this show, and doing so in color for the first time ( I didn't get a color set until 1992; don't ask), the show was, in my opinion, the best attempt to bring live-action comics to the small screen up to that time. The only better incarnation was Chris Reeve's Superman (at least the first two movies). Everything was garish; four color sets, older, stylish cars, not quite Gothic architecture. Watching it now reminds me a lot of Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy  movie; the creators of The Flash  seemed to use the same approach to the look and color scheme of the show. And it's a very good look.

The acting was pretty good as well. John Wesley Shipp, like Chris Reeve, was a soap opera veteran and played the role with aplomb and a certain goofiness that fit the proceedings perfectly. Amanda Pays was cast as Dr. Tina McGee, and manages to keep a steady head amid the strangeness. You also have some interesting roles for many noted actors and performers, like Richard Belzer, Alex Desert (as Barry Allen's best pal Julio), Brian Cranston, Jeri Ryan, Bill Mumy, and David Cassidy. And, of course, Mark Hamill playing the Trickster, which seemed to be as much therapy for him as voicing the Joker on the Batman cartoon.

The plot of the show was fairly true to the comic books, with Barry Allen being hit by lightning and chemicals to transform into the fastest man alive. The show itself is a grand, if unintended combination of all three then-current incarnations of the Flash --this Central City reminded me of Jay Garrick's roost in the original Flash Comics, and the science was similar to Wally West's mid-eighties run as the Scarlet Speedster. The show was a little corny, a little campy, at times, but it was a lot of fun, like a good comic book (or a good television show) should be. It wasn't as heavy on actual super-villains as the comic book was, with only a couple of the Rogues' Gallery making it to the small screen. But TV budgets could (and still can) only go so far. Especially in those pre-CGI days.

I'm sure a lot of folks have been watching the newest incarnation of The Flash  on the CW, a spin-off of Arrow. It's a great show, and features several stars of the original Flash series in supporting roles, particularly John Wesley Shipp as Barry Allen's father, and Amanda Pays as a new version of Tina McGee.

This set runs for around $16.00 on Amazon.com, and it's really worth the price - 6 DVDs with all 22 episodes of the show. The only drawback is that there aren't any extras on the making of the show. But I can live with that. I binge-watched the whole series over the course of a few mornings and afternoons, but if you want to catch the really good episodes first, the pilot, ""Watching the Detectives"", ""Sins of the Father"" (featuring M. Emmet Walsh as Barry's father), ""Ghost in the Machine"" (introducing the fifties' vigilante the Nightshade), and ""Done with Mirrors"" (featuring David Cassidy as the Mirror Master) are all great shows.",1425254400,5,4175,4.56951871657754

2435576,5,B000BPL2EM,"This series was made in the early 90s. It does not compare to the new Flash on the CW as of this writing. It was definitely inspired by the Tim Burton Batman movies during that time. the stories take place mostly at night and even the music is more like Batman. It's a serious series. The Flash's costume also resembles the Batman costume from Burton except for the color and no cape. It didn't make it past one season but one reason is that originally the network was always changing its time and day of airing. I don't think the network had faith in the show so it did not find an audience. But it's kind of cool to watch these episodes if you are a fan of the Flash, especially if you are watching the new series. This flash is now the father of the new flash Barry Allen. There are also a few actors from this series that make appearances on the new flash. It's kind of a nice companion to the newer show. Just don't expect much humor.

You could call this the ""Fastest DVD alive about the Fastest Man Alive.""

I love Superhero movies and television shows, but this one is a little bit different. You could say that Flash is the opposite of most superheroes, and that ""The Flash"" is sort of the opposite also.

Most superheroes chose to become heroes, but the Flash became a hero by accident. Before the accident, Barry was always running late, having a reputation for slowness when it was important, yet he becomes the fastest man alive after an accidental chemical spill caused by lightning.

I wish that they had renewed Flash for additional seasons, but alas, we must satisfy ourselves with these few gems and with the new FLASH series currently airing on CW on Tuesday evenings. In a brilliant example of casting, the actor who played FLASH 25 years ago now plays FLASH's father.

I highly recommend Flash to your viewing pleasure.

Yes, watching it today is very evident of how dated it looks in comparison to modern standards of special effects and computer technology but one thing that stood out was the near-perfect execution of The Flash's outfit. And watching the show now brings back great memories and always wondered why the show didn't last for very long. Although I bought my copy from Wal-Mart at a whim when I saw it on a display rack for 9.99. Didn't think twice about getting it. Great acting, great storyline - although some could get cheesy at times- and great presentation of visuals and ideas.

But I am having a ball with it! John Wesley Shipp was perfect; Alex Desert was wonderful as ""the sidekick"". Amanda Pays was an unexpected delight. I will continue enjoying the show, disc by disc.

I am surprised because the Flash costume is really awesome for that time period and this tv show I like more then the Hulk tv show they had...I can't believe they never made a 2nd season for this, this probably woulda have been bigger then the Hulk show ..IF it was given a chance, I heard when it was on tv no one knew when it was one, or every other week always a different time or different station ect... You can easily see how they didn't care to much because even the pictures on the dvd's and pamphlet don't match what's on the disc like there's a villain on the cover of the 2nd cd, and a picture of him on the DISC2 part of the pamphlet but he doesn't even appear until an episode on the 3rd disc, so pictures are in a random order.

The actors, the cast were amazing, really a ""Feel-Good"" type of show it was for me cause I could just wake up in the morning, put a few episodes of The Flash on and my day is set to be perfect..

Going into this series I was a bit worried, I mean really there was no way to know what to expect, but hey, I watched EVERY single episode, and you know what? This wasn't bad at all, in fact, I think that instead of making those awful 90's live-action movie's of Fantastic Four, Captain America, and The Justice League, they should have made them into a live-action series like The Flash! I recommend this series to anyone that is a fan of superhero's like me, admittedly, this will not be to everyone's liking, it doesn't have the best array of villains, and perhaps that's why The Flash isn't more popular, but hey, this was still a fun series, and surprisingly so, because let's face it, this show had more against it than going for it, not only that, but superhero or not, if you don't have great villains you almost always won't even have a show!

That of the Scarlet Speedster), everything was top notch. As a kid in the 90's I raced in front of my tv to see this show with excitement! John Wesley Shipp was a perfect Barry Allen, truly brought him to life & instilled a love for the character in me that exists to this day. They made the circumstances of his origin & his heroism so realistic, as well as the science of his super-speed. The villains were great, like Captain Cold & esp. Mark Hamill as a perfect Trickster.

2435709,5,B000BPL2EM,"I remember the Flash being on back in 1990 a little, but it was one of those shows that ended up moving time slots and as a result became hard to follow. That was in part what lead to its cancellation. Aside from the 1960s Batman series, this is one of the first attempts in recent times at a live action superhero show. It came on the heels of the Batman movie, and you can tell it was trying to cash in on that popularity. Even the soundtrack to the show was similar to what was in the original Batman move.

Because it had to be a special effects laden show (the effects by today's standards are pretty basic and even kind of hokey looking), it was a very expensive one to produce and as a result only lasted the one season. I think the story lines early on when the show was trying to gain a foothold were not all that great. I think it would have benefited from having a main villain that popped up every few episodes instead of the case of the week kind of thing. Also not waiting so long to introduce some of the comic book bad guys may have helped it, although I could see why they waited to do that.

As for the acting and writing, I think they were ok but not great. I think John Wesley Shipp (who would later go on to play the dad on Dawson's Creek) did a good job with the role. I also think Amanda Pays did well in her role as Tina McGee, although her character did seem somewhat forced in the beginning. The show did not seem to know if they wanted the two to be partners, her to be a sidekick, romantic interests or all of the above. The ancillary police characters were fine, but really never had the characters fleshed out at all and were really there for comic relief most of the time. There were some guest stars that showed up in very early roles (Jeri Ryan, and Angela Basset are a couple of them) and then some well known guest stars like Mark Hamil. The series ended abruptly because it was not cancelled outright until after the first season stopped filming. There were hopes to revive it for a second season that never materialized so it ends very much with a season rather than series ending feel.

Ultimately the show is not going to appeal to everyone. It was not given the leash that others of the genre would get later (Smallville) for example, so it never really got a chance to work out the kinks and establish the characters. There are no extras here. Just the episodes on 6 discs. It would have been nice if they could have got some of the actors to give interviews or a behind the scenes kind of thing, but there is nothing like that. It was a show that had potential that it was not really ever able to realize. If you remember the show when it was on and liked it then, it is worth adding to your collection.",1363132800,2,2745,4.185255198487713

2435711,3,B000BPL2EM,"Mostly a disappointment but probably worth what I paid for the things I enjoyed.

I agree with the Amazon.com Editorial Review 100%.  Too many common criminals and corrupt officials.  When they started using villains from the comic magazine it was already almost the end of the first season and there was no second season.  In my opinion it really was 'too little too late.'  One high point was seeing Jerri Lynn Ryan in a role before her masterpiece 7 of 9 from Star Trek Voyager.  She even got in the credits at the end of the episode.  After using $13 in points it cost me around $12 or so in cash, I forget the exact amount but the cost is even less now than when I bought it.  I've watched the entire set but I doubt if I will ever watch those first episodes again.  The ones with the Trickster, Captain Cold and Mirror Master will probably get played again but not very soon or very often.  The same goes for the Pilot episode.  All in all I guess I got what I paid for and it is worth it since I never watched a single episode when it was first broadcast on TV and I really wasn't sure what to expect.",1362009600,,1108,4.179245283018868

Not sure if ""needed"" is the correct term there.

This whole thing just kind of sits there.  Not really inspired, but not really sucking, either.  It's as if they got to the point in the production of this where they felt like they weren't doing any harm to the comic book...and just stopped there. (Although, truth be told, they stopped a little late for that.)  At times, it's embarrassing, and at times it's palatable.  I just can't help thinking, ""Poor John Wesley Shipp.  He had no idea how much harm he was doing to his career, did he?  And not ONE of his friends told him!  Sad, really.  Just sad.""

I always have problems with shows that can't figure out where they are in time. 1/2 the time they are in 50s (cars, certain fashions in the episodes) and the other 1/2 the time they're in the 90s (computers, other fashions, cars). the acting is a step above a high school production most of the time. the final episode was with mark hamill and it looked like he lost every bit of his acting ability. the stories are horrible, even the villains you know (trickster, mirror master, capt. cold) are terrible in the writing. I trading this pos on a site without a bit of remorse. it may bring fond memories of when it was on but wow, even shows I watch from the 80s now look like shakespeare after wasting my time watching this. if there was a way to give it negative stars, 100% would be doing it

The only cheesy bits were not related to the story or character, but rather the fact that it was the end of the 80's and I can't believe we used to dress like that... Blech!!! But as far as the story and portrayal goes, this was top notch hero television.

Note, there have been a couple mentions of a possible problem with disc one about 90 minutes in. I had no issues at all, and the playback was flawless.

It was fun, action packed, and pretty dark.
Nothing here was played for camp and it certainly wasn't corny.
Somethings are a tad outdated seeing as how it was made in the nineties.
But, the chemistry between the actors on this show is deep and unique and very fun to watch.
Style-wise it almost looks like Batman Forever, but with much better self control and less stupidity.
People complain that the high flying, colorful, and action packed adventure of 'The Flash' was over too soon; after 22 episodes i tend to agree, shows like the X-Files thrived past the nineties while shows like The Flash were all but left in the dust.
However, if you think about, there are more hours in the whole Flash TV series, than there is in all the Batman movies put together.

That was my first actual introduction of the Flash. Before that, the only super heroes from DC that I've known were of course Superman and Batman. But I find the Flash much more fascinating because of his expertise in 'speed', and of course he being just a man unlike the ""Man Of Steel"". I find the series much more delightful than ""Lois and Clark"" that was aired during the same period (locally), it's a pity that it ended so soon...

I believe that, had this show lasted a couple of seasons, it would've gained more of a following..much like shows like Wonder Woman and The Incredible Hulk did. The Flash was a pretty good show with the right amount of humor & seriousness that stayed closer to the roots of the comics than any other show had.

2435768,4,B000BPL2EM,"This set collects the entire run of ""The Flash"" live-action TV series, which ran for a single season of 22 episodes from 1990-1991. John Wesley Shipp plays Barry Allen, a police scientist who dons the red pajamas to protect Central City from assorted evildoers and villains. Also starring Amanda Pays as Tina McGee, the STAR Labs technician who assists The Flash.

Two decades later the stories feel quaint and the special effects rudimentary, but this is a pretty solid TV interpretation of a classic hero who often gets lost in the shuffle behind Batman and Superman. Much like the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JLKB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;it's not a page-for-page translation of the old comics but one that cherry-picks the right elements to add a fresh spin on the mythology. It's actually pretty surprising just how much feels ""right."" The costume, which could've been a total disaster, seems to be made from a molded material not dissimilar to the Tim Burton Batsuits (and much like 2005's Batman Begins, the show actually comes up with a fairly real-world explanation for what the suit is and why Barry should wear it). Each episode's backed by a rousing orchestral score from Shirley Walker, who went on to compose the music for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Complete-Animated-Series/dp/B001CTXUTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman - The Complete Animated Series</a>. Coupled with the Danny Elfman theme, each episode feels like a throwback to the serialized adventures of the 40s. And while the effects are dated, they get the job done - no matter how many times I see sped-up footage to simulate The Flash in action, the visual gags are worth the wait.

As mentioned the plots are pretty standard fare - from evil twins to blackmail, mind control to ""future shock"" episodes, you've seen it before. The characters don't evolve much beyond their initial roles, but for this kind of show they don't need to. The stories are probably most comparable to the Bronze Age of comics - that nicely balanced period right after the goofy 60s but before the grim and gritty period of the mid 80s and early 90s. Halfway through the season the show starts taking advantage of its comic book roots, with more fantastic setups and some supervillain appearances (including Mark Hamil famously performing The Trickster). One consistent highlight from episode to episode is the chemistry between John Wesley Shipp and Amanda Pays, who play the platonic hero/sidekick combo with just the right amount of romantic spark.

Even after all I've said the show still isn't for everybody, and if you just don't dig anything made before computer effects were there to spruce things up then there's little I can say to convince you.

2435798,3,B000BPL2EM,"I always liked the character of Flash. With the CGI effects and seriousness in comic book TV and movies, Flash could be a spin-off of Smallville. That's how good the character is.

Now back to this review, I liked this show. Yet, I can see why it failed. Partly the war in Iraq and partly the corny Batman-ish feel of the show was it's downfall. The blame is not so much with the actors as with the scripts, the lack of seriousness by those in charge of the show. Even in failed TV shows these days that have a comic-book connection or along the lines of comic books (Terminator Sarah Chronicles and Knight Rider) even with their failed attempts they tried to take the subject seriously. In 1991 comic books were much less respected. The best we had was the first two Superman films (way back in 79 & 80-something) and Tim Burton's dark take on Batman. That's it. Most of the rest of comic book attempts were silly, often stupid shows that was more comedy (or attempts at it) than comic-book.

Now I must state I really liked John Wesley Shipp as Barry Allen/Flash. Yes, a lot of times they gave him junk to work with, but with the right scripts he did well, like in the Pilot and when he went into the future and saw what became of his city and friends without him. Those moments stood out for me. Amanda Pays was good as Tina, but relegated to the annoying female sidekick (remember this was before Lois & Clark where Lois was more assertive). These were still the days when the woman had to be rescued almost every episode.

One of the hurtful things with Flash is, (forgive me Flash fans), I was never crazy about his rogue-gallery (villains). Yes, Mirror Master, Reverse Flash and a couple others were interesting, but he never had a Joker-type to be his ultimate enemy. Someone to the degree that they could oppose other DC heroes like Lex Luthor or some of Batman & Superman's villains. To make things worse, this show did not take the villians seriously or much else for that matter. When the show did take things more seriously it showed and was much better.

This TV show was too goofy to last, but it had promise. If they could have brought the main actors and sets and put it in today's CGI and with the seriousness of todays comic book TV or movie, it could have lasted.

If you saw the show and want to get it, go ahead. I waited til the price dropped to a little less than $20. If you are not sure about buying I'd rent it instead. I can't recommend buying this to just anyone, but just for those who are die-hard Flash fans or fans of the show who barely remember this. In it's day it was good wholesome fun. Just not on the level of Smallville or Heroes. Not close, but I liked it anyway.",1251158400,6,2705,4.33794466403162

2435811,5,B000BPL2EM,"When ""The Flash"" was announced as part of the 1990-91 season, I was excited. No doubt, a big part of the Flash's push to T.V. was the recent smash box-office success of ""Batman"". The influence is obvious: The Flash streaks through the streets of what seems to be a shadowy & neon glowing but streamlined version of Gotham City, which is Central City, the Flash's home turf. John Wesley Shipp did a fine job of portraying a ne'er-do-well, lantern-jawed hero, walking the fine line between heroic vigilantism & normalcy; a decent guy trying to do the right thing. The producers wisely stuck close to the hero's origin. The whole season kind of plays out as a two-parter: The first part had the Flash up against more human--albeit sinister & corrupt--baddies (Nicholas Pike, drug lords, gangsters, etc.); then the second half finally opened up full throttle as he was pitted against worthier opponents from the classic comic books. Michael Champion as the chilling & stoic Captain Cold. David Cassidy as the clever high-tech illusionist Mirror Master. And the loony, psychotic fun of the Joker-like villainy of Mark Hamill's The Trickster. Even Shipp got to play dual roles as the Flash's childlike twin (""Twin Streaks"").
And let's not forget the supporting cast: Amanda Pays as Dr. Tina McGee of Star Labs, who becomes the Flash/Barry Allen's ""right hand woman"", and Alex Desert as Julio Mendes, Barry's friend/lab partner at the police science division.
I won't go into a detailed history of why the show was cancelled after one season, since everyone has re-iterated that point again & again. Suffice it to say that after numerous interruptions from sports & the Gulf War & a bad night (Fridays), the Flash was kept from finding its audience.
You'll find several familiar faces passing through the show: Angela Bassett as a (supposedly) dead jazz singer; the late former child star Jonathan Brandis & an older former child star (Bill Mumy from ""Lost in Space""); Star Trek: TNG's Denise Crosby; veteran actor M. Emmett Walsh as Barry's retired policeman Dad; Anthony Starke as the 1950's-age villain ""The Ghost""; and ""Malcolm In The Middle's"" Bryan Cranston as a baddie.
I'm disappointed that Warner Brothers thought so little of the series not to at least add a ""behind the scenes"" featurette or even cast/crew interviews. It would've been nice to know how they created those laser-generated Flash effects of speed or get an update on the stars.
Who knows what might have happened if ""The Flash"" prospered beyond its first season. More classic Flash villains? Romantic complications for Barry & Tina? Barry's dog Earl gains super-speed? Had the show been rescued from its expensive price tag & put on a decent (and solid) time slot, it might've been interesting to see what the creators had done with Seasons 2, 3, and maybe 4.",1247184000,3,2827,4.9536842105263155
2435812,5,B000BPL2EM,"In the early 1990's Barry Allen returned as the Flash on CBS for a short run.  CBS pulled the plug on the show saying that it was to expensive to produce and was not cost effective.

Like ""Smallville"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slyaer,"" they would also show about 3 or 4 new episodes then to be followed by reurns.  Then to  e follow by 3 or 4 more new episodes and then more reruns.

It ran for a half a season on CBS.

The series was a combination of the Barry Allen and Wally West Flashes with the Flash being Barry Allen, Central City Police Scientist.

The show was produced by Warner Brothers.

Only two super-villains from the Flash comic books show up in the series.  One is Captain Cold.  The other who apears in two episodes is the Trickster played by Mark Hamil (Luke Skywalker from ""Star Wars"").  This is where Mark Hamil first came up with the voice and persona of what he would go on latr to use for his portrayal of the Joker in the 1990's ""Batman"" animated cartoon series.

In the series along with gaining super-speed from a lightening bolt hitting a rack of chemicals in the police lab, the murder of his older brother, Jay Allen (Jay as in ""Jay Gerick"")a decorated police officer of the Central City Police moves him to use his newly acquired super-speed to capturing his borther's murderer and to continue fighting crime as the masked mysterious super-speedster, The Flash.

Barry Allen is aided by STAR Labs scientist Tina McGee, a characer that appeared in the Wally West ""Flsh"" comic book series.

Iris West appears only on the pilot to go off at the end to pursue her career goals.  Leaving Barry Allen and Tina McGee to pursue a developing romantic interest.

Another character made up for the TV series is Barry Allen's fellow police scientist at the Central City Police Department, Julio, who does not know tht Barry Allen is secretly the Flash.

In my oung days back in the 1960's, I had always wanted to see Thef Flash in a live-action TV series like Superman and Batman had.  I would have even settled for a full Saturday morning animated cartoon series of The Flsh.  There were those few animated cartoons made by Filmation that appeared on occassion in the ""Superman-Aquaman Hour,"" but I wanted more.

I was glad to finally see a live-action TV series appearing in prime time on CBS.  But too bad that it was short-lived.  But now you can watch the complete episodes of the short-lived TV series in this great DVD set.

2435834,4,B000BPL2EM,"I bought this out of fond memories from high school when this was on TV.  Well, it didn't age well, but that didn't make the DVDs any less fun.  This is the Barry Allen Flash, and it's too bad CBS didn't give it a consistant time slot to build an audience.  They spent a lot of money on it and then let it flop in the wind.  At first, they didn't want super-villains, then they changed their mind.  Basically, this series didn't have a chance.
John Wesley Shipp does a good job as the Flash, and his supporting cast is pretty good, though Tina McGee's voice gets pretty annoying with her English accent after awhile.
The highlights include the episodes with Nightshade, a former vigilante, and the ones with Mark Hamill as the Trickster.  Hamill is even better as psychotic villains (see: the Joker in the Batman animated series) than he was as Luke Skywalker!",1217721600,2,860,4.516129032258065
2435835,5,B000BPL2EM,"This six disc set put out from Warner Studios is a welcomed addition to my superhero DVD collection and also contains the 90 minute pilot episode. This amazing six disc set also contains the entire 21 episode run of the much underrated, underdeveloped and short lived live-action 90's television series ""The Flash"". The packaging and disc artwork are well done and even though the discs overlap one another I find them easy to remove and replace in the package. For comic book fans and Flash purists this 90's live action version resembles the 1960's scarlet speedster and more than anything else it stays true to that character.

Struck by lightning during an experiment and doused with all sorts of chemicals police scientist Barry Allen (John Wesley Shipp) quickly discovers that his metabolism is rapidly changing and he now has the ability to move at incredible speeds. With the aid of a beautiful scientist Tina McGee played by Amanda Pays, Barry Allen AKA ""The Flash"" learns how to control his new found powers as he turns his efforts to crime fighting in Central City.

Watching this series all over again reminded me why I loved it so much in the first place. The series was full of great set designs, amazing special effects and a solid soundtrack from Danny Elfman. It's no secret that ""The Flash"" was an expensive show to create each week and a floating time slot by the network pretty much sealed its fate from the start. Where the show also faltered was in its development of villains to combat the Flash and wreak havoc on the citizens of Central City.

The show had a more human feel rather than comic book and the rogues gallery of high caliber villains didn't really surface until the show was almost over and by then nothing could save the flash. If the network would have taken the time to introduce the villains earlier in the series and kept the show in a solid time slot, the flash would have probably lasted a long time. I think the choice for John Wesley Shipp to play the scarlet speedster was a good one and only wish he could have played the flash more than one season.

Disc freezing during the pilot episode has been a problem with this set and I hesitated for the longest time to purchase it. Fortunately I haven't encountered that problem and I rate the picture and sound 7/10 on this set. The only crime with this set is there isn't any bonus features, commentaries or extras included. We all need heroes and I wish ""The Flash"" would make a speedy return to television.

2435836,3,B000BPL2EM,"Sure, the set was pretty bare-bones (seriously, would it have killed them to cobble together a interview segment with the cast and crew looking back on the show, or dig up some behind-the-scenes footage, or even throw in a single commentary track?), and some of the earlier episodes were somewhat cornier than I remembered, but the show definitely picked up speed (pardon the pun) pretty quickly.  In fact, one episode in particular, ""Beat the Clock"", was a surprisingly good dramatic story, and even featured a young Angela Basset.  (There's also the fun of spotting actors who became famous much later in their careers.  For instance, both Brian Cranston and Jonathan Brandis were featured in episodes, and Gloria Reuben and Jeri Ryan both had cameos.)  All in all, it's defintely worth owning, in my opinion.",1215043200,,811,5.029850746268656
2435837,4,B000BPL2EM,"I can't really say too much that hasn't been said already. When this show came on the air, I was afraid that the special effects would be cheesy beyond words, but in fact were top notch for its time. J.W. Shipp as the Barry Allen was very solid, as was Amanda Pays (yum) as Tina McGee, and Alex Desert as Julio Mendez (a bit under-utilized, IMO).

The stories ranged from the excellent: the two with the late Jason Bernard, and the ""Beat The Clock"" episode with Angela Bassett (yes!) in a cameo where The Flash has to save a condemned man in ""real time"", to the rather silly (the episode where Flash got blown 10 years into the future). But overall, the show really had potential. I faithfully taped them on VHS, but knew the show was in trouble as it bounced around from one time slot to another, and was interrupted for breaking news in the Gulf.

Another flaw in the series (besides, unnecessarily cheesy dialog) was the lack of usage of the Rogues Gallery from the comics. It took way too many episodes to get Mirror Master (a nicely cast David Cassidy), The Trickster (an amusingly over the top Marc Hamill, freed from The Force :-), and Captain Cold finally make appearances. Alas, a sort of Reverse Flash episode was one of the weakest.

The only down side to the DVD set is that there were no added features.

Be on the lookout for the various special guests and cameos. Angela Basset, Jason Bernard, Hamill, Cassidy, Jeri Ryan, and Richard Beltzer were just a few.

You know, with the explosion of the CSI genre, a police scientist (again, The Flash was ahead of its time) with super powers would make for a GREAT series. The cost of the FX work helped kill the series the first time. 18 years later (my god has it been THAT long?), perhaps those barriers have been lowered enough to bring it back.",1214179200,5,1807,4.463636363636364
2435838,4,B000BPL2EM,"In 1990, with a theme composed by Danny Elfman, the Flash made his live action debut.  However, his would be gone in a flash, nowhere near the hits Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, his fellow DC superheroes would become.  The pilot had him becoming a masked avenger similar to Batman who would avenge his brother's death.  It doesn't quite work because those like myself to knew the early comic books of the late fifties when Barry Allen was introduced, his job already is Police Scientist.

The supporting cast characters were not in the original comic book.  That includs Amanda Pays as his confidante scientist, Tina McGee, or Alex Desert as Julio Mendez, his police scientist co-worker.  There was also an irate police commisioner and two dim witted cops for unnecessary comic relief.

All is not lost though as there were some stand out episodes.  Unfortunately, Flash's excellent rougue's gallery were under utilized and those that did appear, Captain Cold, Mirror Master or the Trickster, did not wear the great costumes they wore in the comic book.  Mark Hamill as the Trickster did wear a crazy punk outfit and actually Hamill would have fitted the nerdy scientist that Shipp played but that's not how the casting went.

Regarding John Wesley Shipp, he was a good, comical, muscular guy at times hampered with cheesy dialog.  Not in the series were Iris West, Allen's girlfriend, Wally West as Kid Flash or Jay Garrick, the original Flash created shortly after the original Superman and Batman.

I forgive the series a lot due to my fondness of the character.  Episodes I did like; Watching the Detectives: Megan Lockhart through her investigating skills discovers Barry Allen and the Flash are the same.

Shroud of Death:  This episode introduces Comissioner Garfield (Mike Genovese) who wrestles killing the female killer while Flash intervenes.

Ghost in the Machine:  This episode starts with a 50's flashback and introduces the Night Slade (very similar the 40's hero the Sandman)  Jason Bernard as Night Shade gives the best performan in the entire series.

Beat the Clock:  Innocent jazz musiican is about to be executed at midnight.  My favorite episode.

The Trickster:  Mark Hamill gives a mad performance though he still has to mouth cheesy dialogue.  Megan Lockhart retuens.

Tina, Is That You:  The best showcase for Amanda Pays, who gets to play good and evil.

Twin Streaks:  A blue flash clone appears.  A total freak of nature and this one has the best showcase of John Wesley Shipp forced to stop his twin, an emotional man baby.

Done With Mirrors:  David Cassidy as the Mirror Master

Oddest episode: The Trial of the Trickster, especially the part where the Flash helps the Trickster destroy a police car.  Somewhat inventive at times, but the weird ending to the comic book series.

I'm not familiar with Danny Belson or Paul DeMeo and due to the cost of each episode, this series ended quickly.  Unfortunately, it ran at the same time as The Simpsons, the cartoon family that's still running at the time of this writing.  It's also a trip to visit a not too distant era when all the high tech shown has been upgraded and replaced.",1205971200,3,3164,4.881578947368421

2435851,5,B000BPL2EM,"I was excited when they were making the Flash into a series.  The Flash had been one of my favorite comic characters.  The result was a great series.  But unfortunately, I was able to see only six of the episodes.  Until this DVD came out, that is.

There are some differences between the comic version and the TV version.  The comic version could run up and down walls and on water, defying gravity with speed, and also was able to vibrate his molecues so he could pass through walls.  The TV version did none of the above.  However, the TV version had accelerated healing, which is not dealt with in the comics I read.  Also, comic book girl friend/wife Iris West showed up only in the pilot; second episode she was in Paris and not coming back.  This allowed Barry Allen to have several girl friends, possibly including Tina McGee (Amanda Pays).

This series was started on the success of the Batman movie.  Like the Tim Burton Gotham City, the TV Central City does not come across as real.  There is a mix of old and new cars unlike reality.

Comics often mix science fiction with fantasy, and this series is no exception.  Some of the fantasy is directed toward the male audience.  But there are plenty of good science fiction stories in here, dealing with cloning, androids, invisibility, etc.

The series made some innovative casting that paid off.  Could you picture David Cassidy (Keith Partridge) as a creepy villain?  How about Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) giving an over the top performance as the Trickster?  Both worked well.

As with any series, there are good episodes and bad episodes. In my opinion, the best written was ""Sight Unseen"", with ""Beat The Clock"" a close second.  ""Twin Streaks"" was another excellent episode.  My personal favorite was ""Captain Cold"", with ""Tina, Is That You"", and ""Double Vision"" being other favorites.  The stinkers were ""Child's Play"" and ""Alpha"".  ""Done With Mirrors"" is right in the middle -- I loved David Cassidy's character, but the episode itself left a lot to be desired.  I loved the portrayal of Nightshade, but the episodes were not the strongest.  And no, while I think Mark Harmon was very effective as the Trickster, I am not a Trickster fan.  (Though I thought his accomplice in the final episode was cute.  I know -- I've been married 25 years and I'm not supposed to notice things like that.)",1200182400,3,2358,4.69682151589242

It was awful!!! The creators/producers wanted the show to be faster than a speeding bullet but it's duller than a  rubber knife and dumber than a bag of rocks (and I've met some pretty dumb rocks). Coming off the heels of the 1989 blockbuster BATMAN, I see what they were going for...and certainly the score (by Elfman himself) and the overall look ofthe show hold up. However, the dialogue is cliche at best and the performances are painfully overwrought or just plain flat. Scenes that should be heartfelt are corny. Jokes that want to be funny are corny. Villains that are supposed to be manacing are...you guessed it...corny. Add in zero extras and this just isn't worth it. Trust me and save your receipt.

2435856,5,B000BPL2EM,"There is very little not to like about THE FLASH.  A super hero, lightning speed, and evil villains.  Best of all, the Flash appears on and off throughout the episode.  This is quite a change from those cheesy super hero television series of the 1970s where we were limited to a glimpse of our hero only twice during the show:  Once during the first 20 minutes and again in the final five minutes.

THE FLASH was a natural extension of Warner Brothers' success with the BATMAN motion picture.  In fact, THE FLASH shared many of Tim Burton film's elements:  A darker superhero, most of the stories taking place at night, and Danny Elfman music.  Comic book loyalists were quick to point out the deviations from print, but given the choice it was better to have THE FLASH for one reason than not at all.

CBS premiered THE FLASH during the 1990 - 1991 television season. As numerous reviewers have reiterated, the show was doomed to fail because of CBS programming mismanagement.  The early 1990s was a time when ABC, CBS, and NBC still held most of the cards as ""The Networks.""  As Networks they crowded their programming line up with series, sitcoms, mini-series, sporting events, and specials.  THE FLASH was often displaced from its time slot so often that fans could not keep up with it.  At times it also aired at the same time as other popular shows such as THE SIMPSONS and THE COSBY SHOW.  Contributing to the show's demise was that the first Gulf War, DESERT SHIELD/DESERT STORM, was constantly in the news and a regular source for special news reports.

The show should have been awarded a second season, but CBS had zero tolerance for low ratings.  A couple years later THE FLASH probably would have found better success on FOX or CW.  Alas, it was not to be.

Thus it was that I was surprised by the show when it appeared on the British satellite station Sky One in 1992.  At that time Sky One was also beamed to continental Europe and provided an additional, and sorely needed, English language television channel for US military personnel in Germany.  Unfortunately I was not able to catch the whole series.  By the time we added a satellite dish to our German apartment balcony THE FLASH was only a couple episodes away from finishing its run on Sky One.  A couple years later I stumbled on two video cassettes of the series, the pilot episode and a ""movie"" assembled from two episodes involving The Trickster, and was able to enjoy a little more of the series.

The DVD set is very affordable.  If your remember the series from 1990, now is your time to order the DVDs and enjoy them at your liesure",1172707200,3,2614,4.572043010752688

The Flash was one of my faves when growing up firstly because of his cool costume. No tights, just lightbolts, scarlet and heavy-duty boots.

This TV rendition was not unsatisfactory to me. The interplay between the 3 main characters was well done, and the cheezy comedy added to it's personality. The Flash scenes were not over or underdone, and I remember hearing that the show was cancelled because the cost of the special effects (in those days) didn't justify continuing the program. Some of the villains are hokey, but the show also puts the Flash in some hairy situations!

The art deco and neon style of the show is interesting, and the mixing of obscure 1950's cars with modern vehicles is a hoot.

2435874,4,B000BPL2EM,"I was fairly young when The Flash originally aired on TV, and while I see more flaws when I re-view these episodes today as an adult, the charm is still very much there. The series was and is entertaining, and the casting is generally quite good. John Wesley Shipp as the Flash is a good choice, as he seems to be able to convey the kind of character and humility necessary for a persistent do-gooder, even while managing to be a bit humorous at times. Even the supporting cast (characters such as Murph and Bellows come to mind) manage to come through time and time again, providing comic relief when need be, a sense of urgency here and there, even taking more central roles in some of the storylines. As one of the few heroes to make it to primetime (and remember, this was during a period when superheroes weren't quite as popular as they are now), it's a shame that the show lasted for a single season, thanks in part to the mismanagement of CBS on one hand (I can remember never knowing when it would air), and it's reportedly high production costs.

Now, some people like to harp on the fact that it's not faithful to the comics in each detail, but in turn I'd like to ask, what comic adaptation has ever completely been? I understand where you're coming from (you should have seen my reaction to the casting of Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man), but in this case, they still managed to bring an iteration of The Flash to the small screen who is instantly recognizable as the Scarlet Speedster. The same can be said of his Rogues Gallery (one of the best in all of comicdom), with Captain Cold, the Mirror Master, the Trickster and even a unique take on reverse Flash, all making appearances (The Trickster, played by Mark Hamill of Star Wars fame, appearing twice). New characters, such as the Nightshade, were often just as good.

Ultimately, fans of The Flash, and superheroes in general, will be pleased by this set. The lack of any real bonus features costs it a star, but if you're needing a hero fix between summer blockbusters, this will fit the bill.",1168041600,3,2064,4.501333333333333
2435875,4,B000BPL2EM,"The Flash is probably the most unappreciated super heroe series to ever hit tv. It stars John Wesley Shipp (Dawson's Creek, The Never Edning Story 2) as Barry Allen who's a scientist for the police. One night there's an accident in the lab that leaves him being able to move extremely fast. A scientist at Star Labs named Tina (Amanda Pays) helps him learn how to control his new powers. A former cop who now has a dangerous gang, kills his brother who was the head of police. So in the pilot, The Flash must put the person who killed his brother behind bars.

  The show is fun and one of the few comic adaptations that has the feel like you're actually watching a comic book being played out. The fact that Danny Elfman who has done the musical scores for comic based films such as Batman, Spiderman and the Hulk does the theme music helps the show out a lot as well. Don't get me wrong, not every episode works in this show but it gets stronger as it goes on. You have Mark Hamil as the Trickster doing a similar voice as he did as the Joker in the Batman Animated Series. Too bad they won't dub Heath Ledger's voice and have Hamil talk for the Joker in the next Batman movie lol. The 2 appearances by him are worth checking out. The Captain Cold episode is pretty good as well with a hired bounty hunter that freezes people to death. Ok he's not Mr. Freeze but certainly his character is better done than the Mr. Freeze we got from Batman & Robin.

  This show just shows how boring people are that watch tv lol. I mean how didn't this show get ratings. The sad part is that Smallville gets more  ratings than this show did. When the Flash is just a straight forward comic book show without whining and complaining more than action. John Wesley Shipp isn't a fantastic actor but he was a really good Flash anyway. He had the right look for the part and did manage to carry the show just fine. I'd love more straight forward comic shows that take the material seriously like this does. But if they were on the same night as a reality show, sadly they'd get canceled as well. Because if this show didn't make it in 1990, I'd hate to see it now against the lame and over-rated American Idol.",1167436800,4,2192,4.292978208232445

I was TOTALLY disappointed when I saw the show when it came out in 1990.  The only consistencies with the comic book was the alter-ego was Barry Allen and lived in Central City.  That's IT!!!  I think it was patterned more after the Wally West Flash from the mid to late 1980's comics down to the hair color and costume!  The villains were done terribly!!!  The costumes and outfits were ridiculous!!!  Can you picture the Flash of the silver-age comics opening a door and then running??!!!  Get real!!!  With computer graphics...get real!  It could have been done a WHOLE LOT better!!!  Maybe the producers and directors should have pulled some of the comic books and looked at the pictures.  To talk about the high budget...maybe if they got regular actors who looked more like Barry Allen, Len Snart (Captain Cold), Sam Scudder (Mirror Master) and James Jesse (Trickster) instead of David Cassidy and Mark Hamill they would've had cheaper expenses and a more realistic series for us Flash diehards!!!  Let's NOT forget the smutty women and the poor excuse for Iris...the obnoxious bimbo!

2435887,5,B000BPL2EM,"My biggest complaint with this series is that it lasted only one season.  I think it did the best job of capturing the ""feel"" of reading super hero comic books.  I grew up in the ""silver age,"" and The Flash was one of my favorites.

What really makes or breaks a show in any genre is the scripts.  The Flash was, for the most part, very well written, and the characters were well drawn and engaging.  Lt Garfield was a bit of a stereotype but not objectionably show.  The character was given enough individuality and depth to hold up.  The other supporting characters usually didn't play like they were lifted out of a hundred other shows you've seen before.  They were individuals, and seemed to exist beyond their basic story functions.

This show did an excellent job of hitting the right balance.  They fantastic elements are taken seriously enough to work as adventure / suspense, and yet there is just enough humor to keep it light and fun.  After all, there are inherent absurdities in any super hero.  It is basically fantasy, and it should be fun.  (Many modern super hero stories are unpleasantly dark and try too hard to be ""realistic,"" which only makes the fantasy elements seem even more ridiculous.  Super heroes are not part of the real world.  Too much phony ""realism"" cheapens the fantasy and destroys the point of the genre.)

The special effects are striking, without being overdone and distracting.  Too often, special effects seem designed to make you go ""Wow! Cool!"" and pull you right of the story.  A good special effect is one you don't recognize as a special effect until later -- at the time it is simply a part of the story.  The semi-abstract blurring effects they used to simulate Flash's speed work very well.

Most of the episodes were strong, though there were a few duds (true of most series).  One of my favorites is ""Ghost In The Machine"" which introduced The Nightshade, a retired earlier superhero (apparantly created solely for this series).  Nightshade put in another guest appearance later in the series.  If The Flash had gone on another season, it would have been nice to see more of him.

When the show first aired, I had minor quibbles of differences from the comics I grew up with.  Barry Allen is supposed to be a blond.  Several characters (primarially villians) have the same names but little else in common with their comic book counterparts.  Captain Cold was a particularly disturbing change.  It worked as an entirely new character, but I question the need to echo the names of the originals instead of creating new names for what are really entirely new characters.  In the pilot, I wish they had called his girlfriend/fiance (who dumped him and was never heard of again) something other than Iris West.  In the comic books, Iris eventually married Barry, and her personality was entirely different from this rather shallow, self-centered person.  For that matter it is hard to imagine Barry Allen (either the TV version, or the comic book original) ever getting involved with someone like the TV Iris.

As I said, these were mere quibbles, and certainly would bother anyone who didn't grow up with the comic book originals.  For the most part, the supporting characters were new with the TV series, and that was probably a wise decision.

Some have complained about the absence of bonus materials.  Well, a lot of times there really aren't any worthwhile bonus materials available.  The show itself is the important thing, and I'm delighted to have all the episodes.  While I usually watch bonus tracks, I have to admit, they are usually a waste of time, and almost never are worth watching a second time.

The episodes of The Flash are worth watching and re-watching.  And that, to me, is the only real reason to buy a DVD box set.",1146960000,9,3787,4.732415902140673

The character and storylines were true to the silver age Flash comics and John Wesley Shipp did a good job as the ""eager to fight for what's right"" Barry Allen.  An added bonus is seeing so many stars before they hit big, most notably Jeri Ryan (Seven of Nine on ""Star Trek: Voyager"" and Ronnie Cook on ""Boston Public"") and Denise Crosby (Tasha Yar on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""). Also, Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker in the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy) is in an episode and Richard Belzer also appears.  Amanda Pays is good as Barry's colleague and friend and the quality and clarity of the episodes is quite good.

2435909,5,B000BPL2EM,"I decided to replace my ""intial impressions"" review with a better one after watching all the episodes of The Flash. Here are my comments:

- There were many more than I remember seeing. I think I saw about six when it originally aired, missing most because of the changing schedule, student life, and the used VCR that I was trying to set to a moving target.

- The content: Most of the series is shot on a set which has large murals and giant wall art, with excessive use of colors (must have been trendy for the 90's). But, you get used to that easily. The special effects are still very good considering a whole decade and a half have passed.

- The episodes are good stories, bringing out the diversity you'd expect in a comic book. If you compare this with the Batman (Michael Keaton onwards) the stories here have a broader scope even though some basic crimes remain the same (bank robberies, fur coat robberies, etc) much like the comics.

- The character of the Flash is very true to the comic books, but adds a tad more reality not unlike the recent Spider-man movies, at times. Of course, financial issues are not of the same magnitude, but there are other social, personal and health-related things that remind you that this is still an ordinary man gifted with powers and cursed with the responsibility. Sometimes I keep expecting Spider-man's reflexes and spider-sense in the Flash. But I'm sure Marvel has those patented :-)

- While there are no deleted scenes or other bonus materials the DVD's are well laid out with the episode names, and then the content guide is in the DVD as well. You can definitely pick out the episode you want to watch, even read a brief synopsis on the DVD case.

- Initially I thought my six-year-old would enjoy these, but the content is mature enough (say PG or PG-13) and the story/plots are interesting enough that my wife and I ended up watching the DVD's and she's not even a big comic book fan.

For any fan of comic book superheroes, this set is really worth getting. I wish they'd make another season or five, or even a movie.",1143590400,10,2079,4.513297872340425

2435935,5,B000BPL2EM,"To all you potential buyers...""The Flash"" is the BEST live-action comic book adaptation ever to appear on television! I speak as a 'baby boomer' who grew up on ""The Adventures of Superman"" in the fifties, endured ""Batman"" in the sixties, and found ""Wonder Woman"" a 'mixed bag' in the seventies. ""The Flash"" is much, much better, and it has always been a tragedy that poor ratings (due largely to shifting time slots and the Gulf War) killed this series after a single season.

But what a season it was!

Produced by fellow 'baby boomers' Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo, to capitalize on the success of the Tim Burton ""Batman"" and visual style of the Warren Beatty ""Dick Tracy"" (with a theme by the composer of both films, Danny Elfman), the series focused on the adventures of the 'Silver Age' Flash, Barry Allen (played with boyish charm by John Wesley Shipp). A police scientist, Allen is struck by a bolt of lightning in his lab, and doused with an array of chemicals that alters his DNA, mutating him into a being of nearly limitless speed, superhuman regenerative powers, and an appetite for food to maintain his stamina that could keep pizza parlors in business for years! The death of his older brother, Jay (named after the forties' comic book Flash, and played by 'B' movie legend, Tim Thomerson) leads Allen to don a mask and costume, and fight crime, with his secret shared by scientist Tina McGee (Amanda Pays). Then it is literally 'off to the races', as the Flash uses his speed to combat street gangs, vicious killers, and the celebrated 'Rogues' Gallery' of costumed villains 'lifted' from the comic book (The Trickster, Captain Cold, etc.)

While the series never attempted to be 'real', it avoided campiness, and respected both the audience and it's comic book roots (with references to legendary ""Flash"" authors and artists cleverly slipped in). The FX were astonishing (and VERY expensive to create), and still 'hold up' extremely well against the CGI effects of today.

Among the memorable actors who appeared in the series were Mark Hamill (just seven years after the first ""Star Wars"" trilogy concluded, and developing the 'villainous' skills that would make him the ideal 'Joker' in the animated ""Batman"" series), Robert Shayne ('Inspector Henderson' in ""The Adventures of Superman""), Bill (""Lost in Space"") Mumy, Dick Miller, David Cassidy, a pre-stardom Angela Bassett, Richard (""Homicide"" and ""Law and Order"") Belzer, M. Emmet Walsh, and Alex Desert, as Allen's dreadlocks-coiffed sidekick, Julio Mendez.

Each episode of the series was vastly entertaining, with Shipp displaying not only a heroic physique, but a finely-tuned comic timing, and a dazzling smile guaranteed to melt your heart, as well. He made a character in a red 'muscle suit' not only believable, but as ingratiating as Christopher Reeve's 'Superman'.

While I'm disappointed that there are no 'special features' in the collection (it would be fun to learn of the work required to create the 'magic', and observations from the principals, after over a decade and a half), to have all the episodes, together at last, is a cause to celebrate!

But don't take my word for it; check it out! I promise that this is a collection you'll cherish!",1140480000,2,3232,4.963031423290204
2435936,5,B000BPL2EM,"In looking back on it I have to say The Flash series  was really ahead of it's time. While the special effects were too good for a series at that  time, it seem like the effects  were made for a motion picture rather than for Television.  They still do pale in comparison to fantasy adventures shows  of today TV...as classic Star Trek pales in comparison  to Modern day Battlestar Galactica.  If only The Flash would  have  waited a few years so that it could have been in company with such other superhero  series and movies as The X-Men, Michael Keaton's ""Batman "",  Smallville, Batman the Animated Series, Spider man or the current Batman Begins.

The Flash was still great entertainment  and stylist piece of television for  its time. Again comparing it to Smallville's super speed effect, who owes a debt to The  Flash for paving its way. . As a Superhero series, Flash  took itself pretty seriously (or at least didn't become a joke or campy with costumes or vehicle changes  like such TV's superhero fare 1960's Batman or The Green Hornet or 1970's Wonder Woman). It is dated in the late 1980 with the  hair styles, clothes, and music.. However this  is acceptable, too, adding  to the playfulness of the era which it was made. I hope we can say that with Stargate in 20 years from now

The Series  had a few name guest stars made appearances during its season run, Such actors who appeared are  Mark Hamill (Star Wars), David Cassidy (The Partridge Family) and Richard Belzer (Law and Order SVU). However It was about the story lines not the guests  that made it interesting  film making. With the quality of the show in rewatching these episodes, each show was like you were  watching  a mini Flash short movie.

Strangely though, I am not as amazed by yhe special effects of the early 90s, though it was a good effort.  The Flash's costume sucks, it hinders movement (he has to turn and look at something with his whole body when he can do it with his head...so stiff for an extremely agile superhero) doesn't really comply with the comic book equivalent, the boots are supposed to be yellow, not red.  Storylines are ok, some of them do go along with comic book scenarios...but one big drawback for me would be the Flash's reduced power.  The speedforce should be utilized with more speed and speed related abilities.  He can barely outrun a rocket? what's that all about? Barry Allen is supposed to be ""almost"" as fast as light (Wally West is faster than light)...and a rocket is way slower than that...hopefully when they make the new series (Back In A Flash), and the 2006 movie, they realize Flash's potential, and show it, he could be the most powerful superhero there is, saved the world so many times in JL and JLU, his speed dominating every other power the other heroes possess.",1140393600,,1147,4.575609756097561

""The Flash"" benefited from witty performances, great optical effects and the atmospheric look of the show (borrowed from Tim Burton's ""Batman""). The main flaw with the show was the lack of supervillains during the first half of the season. Luckily some of The Flash's colorful nemesis appeared during the second half of the season. I've read about some of the problems with the pilot and purchased this set with trepedation. I'm not sure if I lucked out (Warner Brothers still hasn't been able to pinpoint what the specific problem is with those discs that are defective). Luckily I had no problems with the pilot episode on the first disc. It didn't skip or freeze so I'm not sure if this is a regional problem with some discs made at certain plants. My guess is that these were made of faulty material. Warner is still trying to figure out the problem with the initial batch so if you're having problems run over to TVONDVD and let them know about it. They're trying to help Warner figure out what the problem is with the set.

Barry Allen (John Wesley Shipp) develops the ability to move at a supersonic speed after lightning strikes his lab and his body is covered in a mix of chemicals. The chemicals and lightning combine to change Allen on the subatomic level allowing him not only super speed but the ability to heal rapidly and pass through solid walls walls. When Barry's older brother Jay (in a tip of the hat to the original Flash from WWII)(Tim Thomerson)is murdered Barry swears revenge against the killer Pike who leads a motorcycle gang that has been terrorizing the city. The only person that knows his secret identity is Dr. Tina McGee (Amanda Pays)who helps monitor his changing condition (the Flash occasionally has bouts of weakness and exhaustion that occur inexplicably)and helps him fight crime.

While the pilot certainly looks atmospheric the show doesn't have the stylish direction and unusual camera angles of many other shows such as ""Twin Peaks"" that appeared at roughly the same time. The moody lighting on the show certainly added a nice distinctive look particularly when compared to other shows of the time. The writing varied from pedestrian to exceptional featuring work by comic book artist and writer Howard Chaykin (he did the comic book adaption of ""Star Wars"" among many others)on a number of episodes.

The image quality is pretty decent. The show had a dark look to it and the 90 minute pilot occasionally has some flecks and spots that occur also the images are occasionally soft as well but, on the whole, the show looks pretty good. The 21 episode season is packaged like the ""Superman"", ""Wonder Woman"", ""Kung Fu"" and ""Lois & Clark: The Adventures of Superman"" season sets in a fold out cardboard case with each disc sitting just on top of each other. The show sounds pretty good as well with dialog crisp and clear.

Sadly there are no extras with this set. Although this show never had the following of the popular ""Lois & Clark"" it still deserved a featurette on the making of the series, an interview or two (particularly in light of ""The Flash"" feature film that writer-director David Goyer is working on)or a commentary track.

It's a pity that ""The Flash"" wasn't given a second chance as the show improved with time. Later guest stars such as Mark Hamill, David Cassidy, Jeffrey Combs, Denise Crosby and others made the show more interesting as well. The show floundered as CBS moved it around with regularity and/or pre-empted it for updates on the Gulf War. Frankly given the great work that Warner has done on other TV series I'm a bit disappointed at the quality of the extras for this set. Still, I'm happy the show has finally shown up on DVD.",1138406400,8,4124,4.743375174337517

2435955,1,B000BPL2EM,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD SET RIGHT NOW...the first disc in the set WILL NOT play the entire pilot episode, and even Warner Bros admits it.  Read on and you'll see who I talked too at Warner Bros about this !!!

I'm a huge fan of The Flash.  Thus, I pre-ordered the set back in December and got it on January 11th.  Kudos to Amazon for being so quick about getting it to me.  Disc # 1, at 1 hr and 31 minutes into the Pilot episode, has problems.  It actually freezes and locks-up my Philips DVP-642 dvd player I got here about 2 months ago.  The only disc that player has a had a problem with!  I ran a check on the disc 1 of that set with one of Nero's tools (software for burning) and it says that the file ""VTS_01_4. VOB"" is bad and that 1.82% of the disc is unreadable.  If you have disc 1 and Nero, you might want to run a ""file scan"" and ""surface scan"" too.  I suspect that either the media used to create the sets is bad, or the duplication equipment to create the sets.

In any case, on Sunday January 22nd at 10PM, I went online to www.amazon.com/returns there's a ""Contact"" link there, that says ""Call Now"".  I figured for grins I'd click on it, and in about 2 seconds my phone rang.  I explained the issue and within 2 days I had my 2nd set (bravo to Amazon cust. svc...wow!).

Ultimately, I found that the 2nd set had the same exact error on the 1st disc.  I fast forwarded to 1 hr 31 min on the disc, and it locks-up my Philips dvd player, gets the dvd drive spinning endlessly in a loop, requiring the dvd player be unpowered to stop that.  I ran the Nero check again, file ""VTS_01_4. VOB"" on the disc comes back as ""read error"" and again, exactly 1.82% of the disc tests as ""unreadable"" with Nero.

With 2 sets of this in a row bad, and the same error at the same exact spot, one can't blame Amazon.  Thus I suspected Warner Bros. might have to recall this entire series, and/or fire the company responsible for creating the sets, as I believe there to be a major quality control issue that should've been caught, before this set hit retailers shelves.

UPDATE: Every year for over 10 yrs I kept hoping this series would be released, and I've waited too long for this series to come out, to let stupid playback issues go unresolved.  So I called some lame Warner Bros cust. svc. number in Tampa, FL (800-364-6928) and they didn't know what to do about this.  Next, I called Warner Bros in CA. (1-818-954-6000) about the issues everyone here, including myself, has with the disks in this set.  I was initially ignored, so I found a website with email addresses for all the big shots at Warner (CEO, Pres, VP's, etc).  I emailed them all about the issue, pointed them to the reviews here on Amazon with complaints about dvd playback, included screenshots of my test results, and Sherri Bogard (Sherri. Bogard@warnerbros.com) who handles ""Defective DVD"" issues for ""Warner Home Video"" emailed me within (2) hours stating:

""Warner Home Video is in the process of setting up a return program for this specific title (yes, we will be fixing the disc).  Right now I do not have an estimated time frame, but as soon as I do, I will let you know"".

I think that's about as close too a subtle admission of ""yep, it doesn't work, we screwed up, and QC should've caught it before it hit retailers shelves"" as any of us can hope for ;-)

You'd think WB would have some $8-$10/hr kid who sits in a room full of various dvd players in their offices, pops in discs one after another, and does nothing but look for playback/freezing issues on stuff like this, before its released.  Or at least they have some kind of software or equipment to scan the disk.  I now suspect they have neither, or they would've caught this.  Hint to Warner Bros...have a room full of PC's with DVD burners in them, install Nero, and use the Nero tool called ""CD Check"".  If WB had, they would've caught this!

If you own this set and you're frustrated about the ""bad media"" WB allowed this to be burned too, you might want to email Sherri and put your name on what's likely to become a long list of people like myself, needing a replacement for at least Disc 1.  In the meantime, I'm going to do software tests on ""file"" and ""surface structure"" of the other disks in this set.",1138060800,120,4250,4.319041614123582

Freezes.  My portable RCA?  Freezes.  Both X-box's?  Freezes.  Playstation 2?  Freezes.  I returned this thing twice to Best Buy and it still freezes in the exact same spot every time.  Approx 3 minutes before the end of the pilot.  If you'll go to tvshowsondvd.com and look up the Flash, they'll tell you that Warner Bros is aware of the problem and is asking for people to let them know if their's is defective and what kind of players they are being played on.  They are supposed to be working out a way to replace those disks.  I hope soon because this really irritates me.  Some of the ones I've had to take back?  Season 1, Vol 1 of Masters of the Universe, Vol 1 of Superman the Animated Series (still skips after taking it back once), Spiderman 2, Bourne Identity, Smallville season 3, Kingdom Hospital (took back 3 times!  4 total sets and they all freeze 15 minutes before the end of the very last episode.  15 hours spent watching this show and I still can't see the last 15 minutes of it.  I finally gave up.)  I think the problem isn't the quality of the dvd player.  The problem is lowest bidder.  These companies are getting these disks manufactured by the lowest bidder and that, like most things made today, seriously hurts the quality.
The show it'self?  I enjoyed it.  I still enjoy it and laugh at the cheesy moments.  They don't bother me.  It was a fun show and I'm so happy it's on dvd.  The lack of extras is kinda crappy and shows the studio only wanted the money this could make.  Even if there were no deleted scenes and extra footage available, they could've at least put together a featurette on the show or something.  Oh well.

2435970,5,B000BPL2EM,"With all the TV series that are being released on DVD, they finally had the wisdom to release the 1990 series ""The Flash"". ""Flash"" was an opportunity to bank on the success of the 1989 ""Batman"" movie, and the creators had developed a new ""comic-book"" style for their new hero. Set in the colorful, noir-ish Central City (great mural art, by the way), the series focuses on scientist Barry Allen (John Wesley Shipp) as a lab accident transforms him into the scarlet speedster ""The Flash"".

Fine performances from the main cast, including Shipp, Amanda Pays (""Max Headroom""), and Alex Desert (""Swingers"", ""Becker""). There are many surprise cameos throughout the series, including Mark Hamill as the psychotic Trickster, David Cassidy as the Mirror Master, comedian Richard Belzer as a snarky talk-show host, ""Lost in Space"" Bill Mumy, ""Star Trek"" alumni Denise Crosby and Jeri Ryan, and Angela Bassett(!). The stories are good, and very often keep to the comic-book origins. My personal favorites involve the Trickster, classic ""Flash"" villian Captain Cold, and the 1950s vigilante Nightshade.

The series was never given a chance back in 1990, due to the Gulf War and CBS's baseball contract, and was cancelled after one season. Though it had its slow moments, the series had a very campy style to it (like a 90s version of the old ""Batman"" TV series). The special effects, while not impressive, added to the camp and added some nice comedic moments (watch how Flash handles a punching bag). Also, musician Danny Elfman provides one of the best opening themes ever. Overall, it's a series that would've gotten better if they gave it more than a season.

Keep in mind - this DVD set has no extras at all. It's the entire season of episodes and that's it. Even so, ""The Flash"" is a cult classic that every comic-book geek should check out.",1137801600,,1836,4.878205128205129
2435971,4,B000BPL2EM,"After the astronomical success of the Warner Brothers' 1990 blockbuster BATMAN, CBS decided to get on the superhero bandwagon with a TV adaptation of another DC hero: the super-speedster known as the Flash.  With a huge budget and solid acting, the show debuted in September of 1990 to fairly decent reviews and, despite initially being aired opposite THE SIMPSONS on Fox Network, was given a full season order of 23 episodes.  Unfortunately, CBS surprisingly didn't show much for faith in the show.  With speed rivaling the title character, the network bounced the show from time-slot to time-slot, as well as pre-empted the show for continuing updates regarding the Gulf War.  As a result, the show never was able to build an audience beyond fans of the character. Add to that the huge expense of producing an effects-laden show, and it was no surprise when the network failed to renew the show at season's end.

For those not familiar with the character, THE FLASH chronicled the adventures of police scientist Barry Allen, who as a result of a freak lab accident, is doused with lightning charged chemicals and given the power of super-speed.  When his motorcycle cop brother, Jay, is killed by a criminal gang, Allen resolves to bring them to justice and adopts the identity of the scarlet clad Flash in order to accomplish his mission.  With the help of Dr. Tina Magee, a scientist and the only other person to know his secret, Allen continues to protect Central City with his super powers.  In the TV show, the Flash's opponents tended to run the gambit from corrupt officials, mobsters, and drug lords for the most part.  The series didn't start to dip into his classic foes from the comics, such as the Trickster and Mirror Master until late in the season.

Much of the appeal of the series stemmed from the simple fact that, unlike the grim Batman or the too-good-to-be true Superman, the Flash had an ""Average Joe"" mentality that made him more accessible as a character.  A lot of this was thanks to the wonderfully solid performance of John Wesley Shipp as Barry Allen/The Flash.  Shipp supplies the right mix of warmth and a wry sense of humor in order to create a likable, yet human hero.  He is also ably supported by Amanda Pays' Dr. Magee and Alex Desert as Allen's hip co-worker in the crime lab.  The special effects in each episode are top-notch and really capture the comic's sense of motion as the Flash zips along on his way to fight crime.

The DVD set contains all the episodes, including the pilot movie.  However, if you're looking for loads of special extras, you will be disappointed.  This is a bare bones set with only access to subtitles.  However, both the picture and sound are solid, providing for a great viewing experience.

With the success of such newer movies as BATMAN BEGINS and THE FANTASTIC FOUR, rumors have popped up of an eventual film adaptation of THE FLASH.  If it can come close to the quality of this delightful TV series, it should achieve the success that it was denied before. For fans of The Flash or superheroes in general, this is definitely worth your time.",1137628800,,3116,4.724584103512015
2435972,2,B000BPL2EM,"Remember that this series is over 15 years old now. Dated, and 1990 wasn't exactly ""The Nineties"" either, so this is basically a late 80's concocted Stab-In-The-Dark tv comic series. Think back, what did you see?

Trust me, watching this now is not like watching it in 1990. The dated-ness feel, and cheesy 80's style character arcs are just unbearable for me. Granted, many STILL like it, so maybe this is just the other half talking.

2435974,4,B000BPL2EM,"I am a fan of The Flash television series.  When it came out, I was in college and my friends would gather to watch it.  We lamented the fact that CBS continually changed their schedule, pre-empting it for other, less satisfying entertainments.  I missed several episodes due to that and to the hectic life of a college student.  Its cancellation was premature and ill advised in my mind.

When I heard that this set would be released, I rejoiced.  When I heard that it was coming out on my birthday, I was even happier.  I purchased my copy at a national chain because I was given a gift card and began watching it on Saturday night.

The episodes themselves hold up reasonably well for being about sixteen years old.  The speed effects remain fascinating to watch and the relationships between Barry and Tina and Barry and Julio are fun.  Murphy and Bellows remain two likeable officers and they play off of each other well.  I am not so certain about Barry's father; he comes off a bit two dimensional and stereotypical to me, but perhaps he would have been fleshed in further episodes.  The Latino youths in one episode were also a bit flat, but not so much so that it was truly a distraction.  There are also occasional moments when late eighties hairstyles show up and make the series feel slightly dated, but those times are few and far between.  In fact, like Tim Burton's Batman, much of the show attempted a timeless air by putting in classic cars and 50's activities/fashions next to more modern ones.

My favorite bit of acting was Mark Hamill's over the top lunacy when portraying the Trickster.  I enjoyed seeing him disguise himself in various roles for this part.  Mostly, I loved the fact that this part prepared him for doing the voice work of the Joker in the Batman the Animated Series cartoon.  Beautifully done, Mr. Hamill.

As for the collection itself, I was less than impressed.  First of all, I was nonplussed about seeing that Alex Desert was not on any of the DVD faces.  They put a non-recurring villain and an ex-girlfriend who barely appeared at all on instead?  Why?

Second, and more importantly, the quality of the DVDs left something to be desired.  I am not merely talking about the quality of the recording, although that itself was lacking.  The colors were poorly transfered and there was a graininess to some of the images.  No, I am talking about something mentioned in other reviews, i.e. the fact that some of the DVDs had issues playing.  Unlike most of the other reviews, my problems did not occur on the first disk, but the fourth.  I was watching ""Tina, Is That You"" when it began to slow down and finally ceased playing because the disk was unreadable.  Aargh!  I tried it in several players, all had the same issue.

Also, there are no extras in this set.  I was looking forward to hearing commentaries by cast and crew or seeing the history of the Flash, or deleted scenes, or outtakes.  Instead, there was nothing.

Finally, the episodes were out of the intended order.  The box says that the disks are in the order in which they played on television.  While this is possible, I really do not remember, it would have been better if they had put them on the disk in the order that they were originally intended to show.  For example, there was an episode where a character mentions events in the past tense that do not happen until the next episode shown on the disk.  This is disconcerting and annoying.

While I do recommend this show, I feel that the product itself would have benefitted from better production values, hence my mediocre rating for a television show that I enjoyed.",1137456000,7,3634,4.601246105919003

This time it did not freeze. The difference was this time the packaging did not include the comic book. I assume it was a different manufactured batch. It may be worth doing the exchange a couple of times and see if you get a good one. That is, assuming the store will allow exchanges. I do like the series a lot.

For those who gripe about how dated the ""Time Tunnel"" and such are, this set should satisfy even those folks.  I forgot how unique the show was, accommodating the latest technology at the time, i.e. cell phones, early Windows PC's, DNA testing all the while incorporating film noir settings with  automobiles from the '40's to the '90's.

I had also forgotten the high level of violence and the mild profanity, atypical of television 15 years ago.  For me this  rates a PG+ rating making it suitable for all except very young viewers.  Just an awesome series with great special effects, especially for TV.

Also special mention to Danny Elfman for his awesome music score!

2435988,5,B000BPL2EM,"OK, I have to say, I LOVE this show. I remember having my mom tape this show evertime it was on.  It is by far the BEST super hero costume ever made. I kept thinking to myself it was just my memory, but when I popped in that first DVD and got to the FLASH costume I was STILL right. That red suit is still incredible.

Ok I have no idea why the earlier reveiwer complained about the video quality being NO clean up of the Picture, NO clean up of the sound, NOTHING. I beg to differ. I think the image looks AWESOME and the sound is just fine. It is a little grainer from time to time, in dark/evening seens, but this is a TV show that is 20 years old and is filmed dark. Dark video tends to have more noise in it then highly lit video. But again, I don't really notice the grain at all.

As for the skipping  at the end of the pilot. I never experianced that. I'm on the second disc and all have played fine so far. I personally think people need to start looking at the quality of there DVD players before complaining that the studio has put out an inferior product. Buy crap and it's gonna play DVD's like crap. A GOOD dvd player is around $80 right now( Jan 2006).

OK, now back to the show. One thing I learned that I didn't know til I got this set was that Danny Elfman who did the Tim Burton Batman music did the sound track for this and has the same batmanish feel to the soundtrack.

Looking forward to DVD release. Was taking evening classes at the time so this will allow me to catch up on what I missed.
Having viewed the first two episodes I compare these with the middle Batman movies. Played pretty much straight, with over the top villans. The red suit could have influenced the anatomically enhanced Batman costume. And the mobile lab the lady doctor rides around end following our hero reminds of the support van that was in the Knight Rider series.

2435990,5,B000BPL2EM,"In 1990 CBS wanted to capitalize on the success of Tim Burton's Batman by creating a Flash TV series. Back then I was 16 and a huge comic fan. I also studied the time slots in that year's fall Preview in TV guide. I knew it wasn't going to be around for long up against both The Simpsons and the Cosby Show, so I religiously set my VCR on Thursday then Saturday nights to tape every episode. (Sometimes I passed on watching ol Cos to watch the Flash; Raven Symone grated on my nerves.) I'm so glad this great show is on DVD. I can finally retire my old VHS tapes and get two episodes and the pilot I lost back. I accidentally erased them trying to tape other shows.

The Flash was far ahead of its time, definitely the inspiration for quality comic book film and TV adaptations like Paul Dini and Bruce Timm's Animated cartoons, Sam Raimi's Spider-man, Smallville, and Chris Nolan and David Goyer's Batman Begins. It was the first faithful adaptation of the comic book, true to its source material origins. The show follows Central City police scientist Barry Allen (John Wesley Shipp) as One fateful night in the lab he's accidentally struck by lightning and bathed in chemicals. The accident gives him the power to move at super speed. Not sure what to do with his powers he goes to Star labs scientist Dr. Christina McGee (Amanda Pays) for help. After some tests, She offers him a crimson colored protective suit used by swimmers for high pressure diving. When a gang of bikers kills his older brother Jay he decides to put a mask and symbol on the suit to become the Flash and right wrongs in Central City for 24 action packed episodes.

The Flash TV adaptation has well written episodes with excellent production values from producers Howard Chaykin (writer of the great American Flagg! Comic), Danny Bilson, and Paul De Meo (Trancers, The Sentinel). Having these experienced sci-fi and comic book experts working behind the scenes give the show has a noir film look that holds up well over time. Even though the show is sixteen years old it still looks like a new show. The best episodes are the ones that feature the Deadly Nightshade, Captain cold, Mirror Master and The Trickster; longtime comic fan Mark Hammill is in top form in his two episodes this show.

The acting on The Flash is top notch, Daytime Emmy winner John Wesley Shipp is perfectly cast as Barry Allen and Amanda Pays has great chemistry with him as Christina McGee, a scientist at Star Labs who wants to help him understand and use his powers. Alex Dessert is great Julio Mendez, Barry's lab partner and the show's underrated comic relief. Recurring stars include a solid Mike Genovese as Lt. Garfield; Guest stars include Mark Hamill as the Trickster, and David Cassidy as the Mirror Master, Michael Nader (Dynasty, ex-Dimitri on All My Children) as Nicholas Pike and Joyce Hyser (Just One of the Guys, if you remember that movie I'm taking you WAY back) as a PI that figures out Barry's secret Identity. Look out for a pre-superstar Angela Basset in one of the episodes. She sings!

I've been waiting sixteen years for this TV series to show up in some form of boxset; I'm definitely going to pick it up. If you're a comic fan or a casual viewer, you'll enjoy The Flash. It's a great TV series and worth adding to your DVD collection.",1137024000,7,3313,4.591216216216216

Same as hundres of others (& those are just the ones who've posted).  Just as the pilot episode gets to the end it starts to skip & eventually freezes up.  It appears to be a big error in the disc itself as tons of different dvd players, computers, etc... report the same thing.  Looks like Warner Brothers will probably have to repress the first disc & have a tradein program.  Not every copy is showing this glitch, a few have reported no problems.  But, that could be the player & what happens if your next player shows the glitch up even if it plays fine now?  WB needs to redo disc one.",1137024000,14,701,4.148148148148148
2435994,4,B000BPL2EM,"First off, I'm a little biased towards this show as it was my favorite thing on television when I was eleven years old. I had all the episodes I could record (a little difficult with the timeslot changes and prolific pre-emptions) on now moldy videotapes. Needless to say, I felt compelled to pick this set up on its release date.

Watching it now, it's a little goofier than I remember. The dialog is appropriately straight up comic book dialog and the effects, while good for early 90's television, leave something to be desired by the modern eye. The series also features a heavy dose of 80's style cop drama techniques alongside the superhero theatrics. But as a comic book transferred to the small screen, ""The Flash"" holds up pretty well.

The first half of the season involves plenty of thugs and gangsters, but as the season progresses we start to see a few staple villains from The Flash's comic book rogue's gallery. A few of the earlier epsiodes can be a little dull, but the Pilot, Ghost in the Machine, The Trickster, Fast Forward, Captain Cold, and Done With Mirrors stand out as highly amusing, slightly campy entertainment.

The video quality does leave something to be desired, but the niche audience for this set is probably a little limited. I explored four different stores before finding my copy. If you're at all interested in ""The Flash,"" and/or a solid comic book adaptation, I'd pick this up sooner rather than later. I doubt a remastered version will appear anytime soon, and I can't picture this set staying in print too long.",1136937600,2,1553,4.7444444444444445
2435995,2,B000BPL2EM,"NO special features, NO clean up of the Picture, NO clean up of the sound, NOTHING. This DVD is 1 step up from owning the series on VHS. Everything with this set feels like it was hated from the moment of production.

What I don't understand is why it costs so much for this set. I could've done most of this DVD on my home computer and had better quality. It's REALLY sad to see that The Greastest American Hero actually looks BETTER than the Flash given that TGAH is almost a full 10 years BEHIND it.

Still, if you're looking for The Flash, get it. I seriously doubt WB will reproduce it.",1136937600,9,591,4.221238938053097
2435996,4,B000BPL2EM,"As a kid, I was never a fan of the comic book character, The Flash, because a hero with the power of incredible speed alone didn't seem interesting; HOWEVER, this show made a very strong case for the character, and I realized how wrong I was and just how much there was to this character.  When I learned that The Flash was coming to DVD, I put it at the top of this year's list of DVD acquisitions, because I knew my family would enjoy it.  Interesting stories, credible acting, a nice dose of humor, and the strong performance by John Wesley Shipp as The Flash make for some enjoyable TV, and I recommend this DVD to those eager for some live-action comic book fun.

However, I do have some comments for those who choose to buy it:

DVD quality:  The show is spread out over six single-sided DVDs--good news for those who've had trouble with double-sided DVDs.  Sadly, the very end of the pilot came to a shaky halt--presumably due to some small scratches on the disc.  I watched the next episode without mishap.  Still, I plan on exchanging the set for a new one in the hopes of getting a defect-free set.

Packaging:  This is a minor quibble, but not every main character gets their face on a disc.  The glaring omission is Julio.  Otherwise, it's a nice package.  Discs are stored similar to the manner seen with later seasons of Xena:  two discs to a panel, one overlapping another.  Each episode is briefly summarized on the packaging for easy reference.

Content:  I bought this show to share with my children, and I was a little uncomfortable with the pilot.  I didn't remember the minor expletives from the father and the relatively understated sex scene, which prompted my son to turn away embarrassed.  However, the humor and action were a big hit with the kids.  I haven't had time to view the entire series, but from what I've seen, the special effects are modest but effective, the stories peppered with good humor and interesting with moral dilemmas (e.g. revenge, helping the homeless) worthy of family discussion, and the characters likable (as I remembered them).  John Wesley Shipp made a very strong case for The Flash:  his performance and boy-next-door charm draw you in and make you root for The Flash, who, despite his speed, is still very human and vulnerable.

Overall, I recommend this series to those who remember the show fondly and those interested in live-action comic book fun.  John Wesley Shipp made The Flash a credible, sympathetic hero, and it's too bad the show never continued past season one.  It remains worthy of interest; check it out.",1136851200,9,2579,4.665188470066519
2436007,4,B000BPL2EM,"His justice is fast. And furious. Get ready for ""The Flash - The Complete Series!"" Developed by Danny Bilson & Paul De Meo (Viper) and a writing team headed by ""Alien Nation"" alums Steve Mitchell and Craig Van Sickel, and comic book scribes Howard Chaykin and John Francis Moore, CBS's ""The Flash"" was given a grimmer tone than its comic book source. Traditional comic book elements were told in a very straight manner. There's humor, but the show wasn't played for laughs as there is a lot of danger, violence, death, and redemption. The villains are twisted and bizarre. Most notably, Mark (Star Wars) Hamill as the Trickster, whose inspired performances would carry him to greater fame as the voice of the Joker in ""Batman: The Animated Series."" Central City is neon lit with a lot of art deco facades for a film noir look. Most of the show's music was scored by Shirley Walker (Batman: Mask of the Phantasm) with Danny (Batman) Elfman providing the rousing main title theme. The show also received solid support from John Wesley Shipp as Barry Allen/The Flash, Amanda Pays as S.T.A.R. Labs scientist Tina McGee, and Alex Desert as Julio Mendez, Barry's lab partner. Not to mention the sinister Flash suit itself, a 10-pound wonder created by FX wizard Robert Short from a Dave (Rocketeer) Stevens design.

The Flash - The Complete Series is a 6-disc (1088 min.) set featuring all 21 episodes from the 1990-1991 season plus the 90 min. pilot. Despite the lack of extras, owning the complete series of this slick, well-produced comic book adaption is still highly recommended.

2436008,4,B000BPL2EM,"Flash fans rejoice, the woefully underrated and short lived show is finally on DVD in all it's glory.  Originally aired on CBS in 1990, the Flash boasted some impressive effects and set pieces, but thanks to a constantly shuffled time slot and coverage of the Gulf War, ratings went downward, and the series soon followed.  However, the series did a lot right, namely casting John Wesley Shipp as police scientist Barry Allen who, through a scientific mishap, gains the ability to run at incredible speed and becomes the DC Comics icon.  He is teamed up with a fellow scientist (Amanda Pays) as he takes on crooked cops and crooks alike, with the later part of the series introducing fan favorite villains including Captain Cold, the Mirror Master, and Mark Hamil as the looney Trickster.  Had the show not been mishandled the way it was, this could have been something really special, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.  What's really sad here however, is that Warner Bros. has decided not to included any Special Features at all in this DVD set, which is a crying shame to say the least.",1136160000,18,1087,4.7

The Flash on the other hand is pure, simple comic book fun. John Wesley Shipp was great as Barry Allen (the Flash I grew up with in the comics) and I can't say enough good things about Danny Elfman's theme.  Every time I here it I get chills up my spine.",1136073600,18,576,4.433962264150943

2436011,5,B000BPL2EM,"It lasted only one season but the Flash on CBS was perhaps the most faithful of any televised superhero show ever made.  The producers stuck pretty close to the true DC comic hero first with his name, Barry Allen (played by John Wesley Shipp) and with his origin of a combination of lighting and chemicals that imbue Barry with superhuman speed that he uses to battle crime.  He's aided in his adventures by Star Labs scientist Tina McGee played by Amanda Pays.  They design the suit that he will wear as the Flash and again it stays true to the original character.

Considering it was 1990 the special effects were very well done, especially for a TV show.  Another thing that remained faithful (somewhat) was the Flash's infamous Rogues Gallery of colorful villains which would include Captain Cold, Mirror Master, and the Trickster, played by Mark Hamill of Star Wars fame.  One of my favorite episodes is when the Flash teamed up with a 40's era hero called Nightshade.  Played by Jason Bernard, Nightshade was a mysterious vigilante similar to the pulp hero The Shadow.  Nightshade would return a few episodes later teaming with the Flash against a Nightshade impersonator.

What really made this show work was first Shipp himself.  His portrayal of the Flash never came across as cheesy or campy and he truly captured the understated persona of Barry Allen.  It's  too bad that CBS didn't have more faith in the show.  This was a show that was several years ahead of its time.",1135814400,4,1482,4.7421875
2436012,5,B000BPL2EM,"After reading everyone's reviews, I just had to join in on the fun.  I was a big comic book fan in my teenage years, with the Flash being my favorite hero.  I was astonished to hear they were going to make a show featuring him.  The 2-Hour Pilot was almost worthy of being release as a major motion picture - it was that good.

Yes, there were a few shows that were a bit painful to watch (especially now), but overall the show was extremely addictive.  Amanda Pays and the guy who played Julio were just fantastic.  And John Wesley Shipp was spot on.  Just a really fun cast - not to mention all the guest celebrities that dropped in as villians - that made each and every episode a real treat to watch.  My favorite:  the episode about Captain Cold.  The actor who played him was brilliant and the special FX/production design were superb.

I recently purchase a crappy, apparently bootlegged DVD of the entire series and the quality of the video was truly terrible - but I was astounded after watching a few shows just how advanced it was for its time.  Even today it would be a real standout.  If you're into comic books or Sci-Fi/Adventure stuff, this DVD series is a no-brainer to purchase.",1135209600,5,1196,4.431192660550459
2436013,5,B000BPL2EM,"I remember trying to get the gang together to watch the show. When they'd mess with the schedule one of us would always tape it on VHS and we'd get together later. :-)

Anyway, the best aspect of the show was not just how they let his ""exposure"" to the world unfold naturally, it was that the network had the decency to give them a ""head's-up"" about the cancellation.  This let the writers tie up loose ends and who can forget the sign painters?  At the start of the last episode we see them working on the ""Welcome to Central City"" sign, at the end we see what they added: ""Home of The Flash""

After being pre empted several times by sports and news events, I sometimes would see only half an episode, and catch the rest in a repeat. For the year it was on, we got to see some great super hero stories without the camp. John Wesley Shipp was great as the Flash and I hope that somehow this show gets put back on the air. It was one of the best shows of its time.

It had all the major villians from the comics; Captain Cold, Mark Hamill's version of the Jester, a Joker like nemesis was the best two parter.

2436027,5,B000BPL2EM,"This short-lived TV-series was excellent in both its conception and execution. Too bad it failed to find a large audience, as there was quality in every aspect of the series. John Wesley Shipp (known now for his role on Dawson's Creek), breathed life into the speedy comics character; he played the Flash with respect and a touch of humour at the right moments. Fans of the comics will note that many various elements of the mythos were incorporated into the show, often with a twist. The special effects, revolutionary for a television series at the time, are still entertaining today. Many thanks to John, Danny Bilson, and Paul Dimeo for presenting a wonderful, well-thought out rendition of the Flash (and kudos to Danny Elfman for the theme)!",1132272000,2,747,4.889763779527559

2436029,4,B000BPL2EM,"From the pages of DC Comics, the Scarlet Speedster dashes to the rescue in the live-action adventure series ""The Flash"". A freak laboratory accident gives police scientist Barry Allen (John Wesley Shipp, Dawson's Creek) the ability to move at incredible speeds. With the help of a fellow research scientist (Amanda Pays, Max Headroom), the fastest man alive known as the Flash uses his powers to clean up the streets of Central City from menacing criminals like the Trickster, Captain Cold, Mirror Master and much more. ""The Flash"" first aired on CBS in 1990. Due to strong network competition and constant preemptions of breaking Gulf War news coverage, the live-action series recieved weak ratings and only lasted one season. Despite its short-lived run, ""The Flash"" was a well produced adaptation of the popular comic book character. The series features some worthy storylines, cool visual effects and a great music score. It also includes guest stars like Richard Beltzer (Law & Order: SVU), Gloria Reuben (ER), David Cassidy (The Partridge Family), Jeri Ryan (Boston Public), Bryan Cranston (Malcolm in the Middle), Angela Bassett (The Score) and Mark Hamill (Star Wars).

Fans who have waited for the DVD release of the live-action DC Comics series will be somewhat disappointed with ""The Flash: The Complete Series"" 6-Disc Box Set. All 21 episodes are presented in their original full screen format. Its picture quality is simple but reasonably clear. Its 2.0 Dolby Digital sound is rather enjoyable. Unfortunately, this 6-Disc set doesn't include supplemental extras.

So, as an idiot college kid, I called the producers of the show in Los Angeles. I don't even remember how I did it, but I read somewhere that the producers also created THE ROCKETEER, which was another of my favorite movies.  Anyway, I don't know how it happened, but I got transferred around and eventually I got to speak Danny Bilson, who was one of the directors of the show. He spoke to me at great length about the show, the ideas, what I liked, everything. He was one of the nicest guys I ever spoke to from the business. Here was this guy who could have just hung up on me and instead, he took me aside for about an hour and talked with me about the show as a fan.

The effects in later episodes started to either look extremely cheap and the ones that looked good were recyled from earlier episodes. I can almost see them canceling it with the direction it was going in, but the episodes that were good (I'm assuming the earlier episodes) were excellent.  The effects, the story, the acting, everything.  I am a fan of the show (bad and good episodes) and I cant wait to see them without in better quality than what I have.

2436032,5,B000BPL2EM,"One of television's overlooked gems! This show is yet another example of a network killing a promising offering by not letting it find an audience.

It was 1990. Pop culture was buzzing from the blockbuster success of Tim Burton's Batman. Star Trek: TNG was in its glory years. (X-Files and Lois and Clark were still three years off). CBS introduced this show in the fall. No problem, right? WRONG! CBS at the time had the rights to postseason baseball, and as a result, The Flash pinballed around the schedule, rarely appearing for consecutive weeks in the same time slot. It also didn't help that it was up against The Simpsons for part of its run. If they had waited until after baseball and parked this thing on a Friday night for a couple of years (ala Fox and The X-Files) it would have hit.

But alas, it was not to be. Even the head of CBS (Jeff Sagansky at the time, if memory serves) later apologized to John Wesley Shipp for mishandling the show. The viewing public mostly missed out on this top-shelf superhero adaptation which was faithful enough for the comic geeks (that'd be me), yet accessible enough for the casual viewer.

John Wesley Shipp played the character perfectly. Amanda Pays (of the also ahead-of-its-time Max Headroom) was a delight. Guests to look for: Richard Belzer, Mark Hamill, Jeri Ryan, Jeffry Combs. My favorite guest: the ever-reliable Jason Bernard as ""The Nightshade."" Watch his episodes, and you'll see how the creators of Batman: The Animated Series used Nightshade as an inspiration for ""The Grey Ghost.""

With Smallville, the Spiderman movies, and Batman Begins really showing us how a superhero might fit into the ""real"" world, you'll be amazed at how ahead of its time this series was. I think it's safe to say that until the debut of Smallville, The Flash was the best live-action superhero adaptation ever put on television.
