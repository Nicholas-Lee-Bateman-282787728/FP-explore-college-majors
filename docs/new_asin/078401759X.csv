74145,2,078401759X,"This video is only 26 minutes long ( only 18 worth of abdominal exercises). Even though Ms. Austin is very athletic and cheerful, I do not think it is worth its price. It is 6 minutes worth of exercise you have to  replay everyday for two weeks at a time. Not the variety I was expecting.",948585600,8,288,4.142857142857143
7790838,1,078401759X,My mistake but did not realize it was a video! Had to return.,1487635200,,61,3.769230769230769
7790839,5,078401759X,I've been using this for years with fantastic results! The tape I have finally died so had to get a new one. Wish they had this in a DVD.,1433635200,,137,3.7586206896551726
7790840,5,078401759X,"Good if you are short on time or just starting out. Only 6 min., that's all you need for this workout. And it Works. You can really feel your abs and waist.",1412294400,,156,3.90625
7790841,5,078401759X,"Six minutes a day is not a major commitment.  Rotating these three workouts each week really gets fast results, and they are easy to fit into any busy schedule. I travel a lot, and find that no matter how tired I am, I can convince myself that spending six minutes to keep my waist trim is well worth it. Anyone can commit to that.  Denise Austin's workouts are typically effective and this is no exception.",1186963200,,407,4.413333333333333
7790842,5,078401759X,"This workout is a great, short, 18 minute workout. The tape is divided into three 6 mintue sections, depending on the intensity - low intensity, medium intensity and high intensity. This tape is more targeted towards beginners to intermediates, but if you are advanced, it's great if you combine all three levels together. I saw results within the first week, and I felt a lot tighter around the middle area.

I'm used to doing Denise Austin, so her constant chatter doesn't bother me one bit - I find it much more encouraging and positive than annoying. I couldn't imaging myself trying to do repetitions alone without her voice or the music. In terms of the setting of the video, it takes place indoors, and Denise is alone, so when you do this video you're really one-on-one with Denise, and you're always focused.

I recommend this video to ANYONE who wants to work on their abs in a short amount of time!",1122940800,3,909,4.6397515527950315
7790843,5,078401759X,"I do a different ab workout five days a week.  I included six minute waist trimmers in my rotation and I love it.  It's split into three levels (beginner, intermediate, and advance).  The workouts are short but very targeted and extremely  effective.  I have definitely seen results.  Denise may sound a bit ditsy, but she definitely knows what she's doing.  This is definitely a 5 star workout.",1074556800,9,395,4.8059701492537314
7790844,5,078401759X,"This is an awesome video.  It's doesn't seem hard, actually, the first time I did it, I felt it was too easy, but man have I seen results.  My 30 yr. old daughter tried and loved it as well.  It's not the hardest workout to do, but it's very very effective.  I don't always have a lot of time, this video gives you a great workout in only 6 minutes.  I now do level 2 and 3 at least 3 times a week.  I love this video and would recommend it to anyone trying to reshape their waistline and abs (both lower and upper)",1073260800,2,515,3.9038461538461537
7790845,5,078401759X,"I like this workout because it's only 6 min(lol) and the techniques used while toning the abs don't put a strain on my back. And best of all, I'm seeing great results.  To sum it up the moves are safe for your back and effective with results!!",1068768000,11,243,4.170212765957447
7790846,5,078401759X,I found this video to provide a great time saving and effective workout.  Denise is encouraging and knowledgeable.  I am pleased and encouraged by this tape and have seen some results in a short 3 weeks.  I just ordered  another of her tapes and am anxious to receive it.,954201600,5,271,4.469387755102041
7790847,5,078401759X,"I found this video to be a very easy thing to do as far as just taking 6 minutes a day for abs.  Because it is a short video, I found it easy to take the time to do the exercise.  The first 2 weeks are one level, the  second get to a higher level, and the same as the 3rd two weeks.  Since I  hadn't exercised in quite some time, I was sore the first couple of days.  But, the results are worth it!",951523200,2,398,3.623529411764706
