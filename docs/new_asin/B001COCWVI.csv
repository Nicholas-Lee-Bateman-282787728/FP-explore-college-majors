8288476,5,B001COCWVI,"This is a sensational DVD of finger picking lessons from one of the best.  The song selection is varied and interesting, and the instruction, gently guided by Happy Traum, is excellent.  Two issues:  The printed material (which you have to print yourself off the DVD) is very dense, and it would have been helpful to include words under the music as a guide to exactly where you are.  Also, Jim K has a long and flexible left thumb that he can wrap around two bass strings in making chords.  Slightly more accommodation for those of us with more traditional left thumbs would have been nice.",1382918400,3,591,4.59047619047619
8288477,5,B001COCWVI,"I had held off buying this because I was afraid it was going to geared to the beginner. Well, it does start off as if it is going to be a beginner video, but Kweskin quickly goes into stuff that is far beyond that. So in that sense, it is hard to understand how this range of material all ended up in one video. So, this video would be appealing to quite a range of players, as the material -- which is included on an accompanying tab booklet -- is great.

Kweskin begins with a chart of different fingerpicking patterns for the right-hand fingers and this may be a little confusing, as when he discusses this, he goes into a discussion of which strings to pick based on the chord being played. Even if you have a pretty good understanding of this, you'll get something from the chart, which is to be used as a source of exercises to develop a real right-hand independence.

Then Kweskin goes into playing and explaining tunes from his repertoire, which you can see in the product description. He starts with Freight Train and Creole Belle, which are standards for 3-finger picking, and progresses upward to good versions of Lazy Bones (pretty similar to Leon Redbone's long version, which was what I was looking for) and Alexander's Ragtime Band. These are great/real/complete versions and nothing is held back, so you really can learn to play these songs. I think everything on here is within reach of a normal intermediate finger picker. A beginning finger picker can start with the chart and the first couple songs and keep going back for more as he progresses. The advanced player will find good arrangements for songs they might want to add to their repertoire, as well as some interesting discussion. Happy Traum does a good job facilitating the whole thing.",1285545600,7,1765,4.653846153846154
