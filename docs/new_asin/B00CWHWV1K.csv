5743495,5,B00CWHWV1K,"Neon's ""Liquid Gold"" gives you approximately 2 hours of open-level (good for everyone!) teaching...and although the instruction comes in Level 1 and Level 2, no matter how much of a beginner, or how much of an expert you are, you'll get something out of it. Since I'm 69, an ex-dancer, and treat myself very gently due to medical issues, this DVD is ideal for me. I need very low impact exercise, and with this DVD I can work at my own pace without ever stressing my body.
Low impact exercise: As we age, maintaining agility and balance are essential. The only exercise systems that fit this bill that I know of are Tai Chi and belly dancing. For those who find Tai Chi boring, belly dancing is perfect. The gracefulness, the lovely exotic music, the beauty of it! It can change your life for the better.
Neon is a master teacher, as well as a total, awe inspiring goddess. Her clarity in explaining every detail, and the aesthetic loveliness of watching her demonstrate the movements make all her DVDs a treat. Her musical, softly accented voice also helps...I find the way people speak often annoying, and good language skills goes a long way with me.
You can chose to view this DVD with/without voice instruction, you can chose Level 1 or 2, a flowing workout or detailed instruction. I love the final hands and arms tutorial! This section alone gets the blood flowing, the heart gently exercised, and the spirit filled with delight. ""Liquid Gold"" is a keeper. Very well produced, lit and photographed, even on my small TV I can see every detail. And the final performance by Neon is icing on the cake!",1391904000,17,1605,4.635087719298245

8586934,5,B00CWHWV1K,Neon is an excellent teacher. she breaks it down ( each move ) and starts the move slow and then quick. I have two more of her teaching videos on the way in the mail.  This video is good for beginners and intermediate dancers who haven't perfected all of the moves.,1420934400,,265,4.196078431372549

8586936,5,B00CWHWV1K,"I decided that I wanted to learn to belly dance last July.  It's now November.  I've been learning belly dance for four months.  Once I decided I wanted to learn, the rest was easy.  I made a commitment to practice.

I decided that I didn't want to start sinking money into a hobby too soon.  I started watching YouTube videos.  There are tons of free instructional belly dance videos on YouTube. Watch YouTube first and learn the very basics.  I watched and practiced every day.  I learned that Neon and World Dance NY are good for instruction.  I checked my local library for dvds and found 'Luscious'. When I first watched it, I hated it and thought it was too fast paced, but I didn't give up.  Little by little I learned the terminology and began to do some of the moves.  It was hard at first.  I renewed the dvd two more times.  I learned to love Neon and her method of teaching.  I didn't really master Luscious like I wanted to, but it was a good beginning.  I may purchase Luscious one day.

After much comparison and research, I bought Liquid Gold and Shimmy a month ago.  The first time I watched Liquid Gold, I thought it was too advanced.  Once I looked at the Level 1 instruction, I felt better about it.  It will probably take months before I become comfortable with the Voice Cues with music part, but I try a little most days.  I go straight to the Level 1 instruction which is probably the best place for a beginner.  I even do Level 2 instruction.

I'd probably learn much quicker if I took lessons, but I don't want to take lessons.  A key to learning from dvds is to learn to understand the names of the moves while learning proper execution. This is difficult since there are times you can't watch while you're dancing.

With Liquid Gold you learn the names of the steps and the correct way to perform them. I'm going to keep practicing Level 1 and Level 2 moves until they're second nature. Liquid Gold tells you everything you need to do in order to learn basic moves. You have to focus, just like Neon says in the beginning of the video.

I love Liquid Gold and highly recommend it. I'm sure there are other quality instructional dvds out there, but you can't go wrong with Liquid Gold if you stick with it.  It takes commitment and practice. You have to start somewhere.  Liquid Gold is a great place to begin.

I think I would have been overwhelmed with Liquid Gold had I not made a commitment to learn belly dance, and if I had not taken the three months to practice from YouTube instruction.

Belly dance has given me so much confidence and poise that I never had, even after years of jogging and doing other forms of exercise.

Neon has to have some of the most gorgeous dance costumes in the world!

Donate your old dvds to your local library.  You'll be sharing the gift of dance!",1415491200,5,2813,4.3687258687258685
8586937,5,B00CWHWV1K,Shes just too good I have all her dvds it really doesn't get any simpler you just have to make time to PRACTICE!!,1394236800,2,113,3.9565217391304346
8586938,5,B00CWHWV1K,"Liquid Gold really gives insight into how Neon creates her fluid, graceful dance style. There is so much in this dvd that helps one learn, in particular, how to make flowing transitions from one move to the next. Working with this dvd is not only sensuously enjoyable, but will deepen your ability to learn Neon's technique and make it your own.

Neon has put out many excellent belly dance instructional dvds aimed at the ""absolute beginner."" Liquid Gold is described as an open-level program and I applaud this because for those of us who have been using Neon's excellent dvds for years, Liquid Gold gives the intermediate dancer more to work with.  I hope Neon will go on making dvds for the intermediate/advanced level dancer. That said, the Tutorial on Liquid Gold will give the beginner a leg up and into its non-stop, compelling movement flow.",1393891200,9,850,4.815068493150685
8586939,5,B00CWHWV1K,"Step out of routine and boring workouts!  Neon presents her fascinating program LIQUID GOLD, belly dance workout and dance companion. This program brings instant awareness at improving or simply understanding organic belly dance movement. It is open level and offers a fantastic tutorial so beginners benefit greatly as well. Neon is a thorough instructor,graceful and precise in execution of fluid belly dance movement.

To begin Neon describes her program which is divided into a work out flow approx. 40 min with 6 sections in two levels and including tutorial run about two hours total.  This program does not have a warm up section.

Level one begins with circles section such as large hip circles, chest circles embellished by lovely arm gestures and hand flourishes, to name a few. These are layered on pivot turns and lovely side lunges to stretch out and sculpt the waist and torso. The infinity loops section features figure 8's, and hip rolls to work out the hips to varied music tempos. Full body undulations are next which are a full body workout and further more when topped on triple steps.

Level two takes the upper and lower isolations from above into  more challenging tempos and combinations such as pelvic circles layered with chest circles working upper and lower body continuously. Beautiful one hip circles are combined with undulations to beautiful music that makes it all seem effortless and delightful.  Upper and lower infinity loops in combined varied tempos continue the challenge for a fantastic but fun work out. Most of the work out involves very little footwork but is generous in lovely arm and hand gestures.
You may choose to navigate to the workout section if you have background in belly dance or use the tutorial sections for complete instruction of movement technique if you are a beginner. Neon breaks down the entire movement catalogue thoroughly.

I much enjoyed this program. The movement is sensual and mesmerizing and its easy to forget you are actually working out; however I felt it's a good workout for the core and upper body. Working the upper body has helped me define upper abs.  It is lovely to see large luscious movement even when layered as it is in this program. Too many layers at times appear undefined and look like wiggling. You can bet just about every muscle group will be brought to awareness. I also look forward to using it a a dance companion as I love sinuous movement.

Other good points:
 A great feature, voice overs or music only
Beautiful costuming, lighting
Lovely graceful, fluid movement
Detailed instruction, fun and easy to follow along
Nonstop workout movement flow
Lovely performance by Neon with combined fluid and staccato movement with beautiful embellishing.",1392940800,10,2744,5.008791208791209
