2487013,5,B000E3LGRY,Miracle of dogs is a real good movie for children and adults. It has a meaning behind it and it helps the sick too.,1227657600,4,115,3.8333333333333335
2487014,2,B000E3LGRY,"I bought Miracle Dogs and Miracle Dogs II because the concept of dogs helping with healing was interesting to me.  Unfortunately, the movie was focused more on a boy keeping some puppies hidden in order to keep them.  The healing concept was only  briefly touched on and not a major element in the plot.  The movie is definitely geared to young people (7-9) and very wholesome.  It is a good family movie to share with young children.",1208217600,7,434,4.584415584415584
2487015,5,B000E3LGRY,"The movie was very very good, but I wish it was longer.  I also wish that it could ALL be true!",1179100800,4,95,3.5238095238095237
2487016,3,B000E3LGRY,"If you like super family friendly films, Miracle Dogs Too will definitely fit your viewing bill. It's a happy, inspiring story for all ages about a young boy named Zack that finds a pair of ""miracle"" dogs.

Of course, there's more to the story than that. The boy just moved to a new town with his mother and sister, following his parent's divorce. The mother is working at a local nursing home and finding a romantic interest in a local doctor. The sixteen year old sister is being pursued by two separate guys (one played by Preston Jones, who manages to take the possibly innocuous character of Josh, the jock next door, and turn him into a memorable and realistic three dimensional person). Definitely keep an eye out for Preston Jones in other work. Also, Jaleel White shows up for a few scenes. (Remember him as Urkle from Family Matters?)

The DVD doesn't offer any extras, but for families looking for a feel good movie, Miracle Dogs Too is the way to go.",1172102400,4,962,4.554913294797688
2487017,3,B000E3LGRY,"This ultrasweet sequel to MIRACLE DOGS brings us two spaniels who have the miraculous ability to heal, and how they stumbled into a young boy's life.  Adults may find it saccharine-heavy, but it is a good film for the family to enjoy together.  A good cast consisting of Charles Durning, Janine Turner, Patrick Muldoon and an over the top Lesley Ann Warren bring some life to the pedestrian script, and all in all, should be entertaining as family viewing.",1147305600,11,456,4.7594936708860756
2487028,3,B000E3LGRY,Very sweet heartwarming movie. One that should be checked out at least once. Sure to become a classic for all to enjoy.,1369699200,,119,4.454545454545454
2487029,3,B000E3LGRY,"The original Miracle Dogs movie had a bad script, but at least the acting was decent.  Miracle Dogs Too, however...ug.  Plus, it's called Miracle DOGS, but the dogs are the least seen characters in the entire movie.

There are a few familiar faces:

The guy obsessed with ice cream?  Steve Urkel from the TGIF show Family Matters.  Doctor Jeff?  He played Jeff, the older guy that Kelly met at The Attic and broke up with Zack for on Saved By the Bell.  The red haired guy who works at the Curiosity Store?  He starred on the movie Firestarter with Drew Barrymore.  Nurse Natalie?  She played the part of Kelly in the original Miracle Dogs movie.  And then there's Lesley Ann Warren.

As much as I hate this movie, I'm giving it a three star because my daughter loves it.  And since it's a kids movie, her opinion is really the one that matters.",1361491200,2,845,4.437908496732026
