8196036,5,B000QFBTXQ,"The first time I experience Timothy Goes to School is on Ion/Qubo Channel. I only been watchin' it for the past 9 months. And I find it extremely interested. When I saw the preview of it, It immediately gotten my attention, so I decided to check it out. Needless to say I love it. I have seen all of the episodes. And now I'm building my DVD collection. There are 13 of them, well one of them is on they other Amazon website, Amazon.ca. That title is called: Just In Time. My concern is how come it's available on that other Amazon website and not this one. Doesn't seem to make sense. And I don't know nothin' about the CDN thing. Enough said. Of all the DVD titles that I've find, It leads me to believe it contains all 26 episodes. I have a good number of them and I'm on the verge of stop watchin' it on TV every Friday morning. Of all the cartoons that I have experienced, Timothy goes to school is one of my Top 5.",1411171200,,920,4.116666666666666
