7794219,5,0970547803,"I have long waited to get a copy of this instructional video, since reading about it years ago. Did not know it had ever been released until very recently. It met all my hopes and expectations. The pictures are clear, and the detail is well shown. This is one of those videos that you really feel you can follow and make the desired product satisfactorily, even the mistakes one might make are shown, and solved.",1319760000,2,412,4.506666666666667
7794220,5,0970547803,This video breaks it all down step-by-step so anyone could make these gorgeous enamel beads. And Pam never lectures you in a boring way. It's like having a best friend show you how to do something in your own kitchen rather than taking a class. A GREAT new hobby and you can get all the tools and supplies directly from her.,1011830400,2,324,4.327868852459017
