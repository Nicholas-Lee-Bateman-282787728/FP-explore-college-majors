2825736,4,B000PMFS5K,"Overall I'm pleased with the movies that are on here, especially ""Follow That Dream"" and ""Kid Galahad."" My favorite of the 4 is the often underrated ""Follow That Dream,"" which is a very funny and well-written film, with Elvis showing his flair for comedy and with a good cast supporting him. ""Kid Galahad"" is another good film about a corrupt boxing organization, with interesting characters and again a very good cast including Lola Albright and Gig Young. ""Frankie and Johnny"" doesn't have a great story, but visually the movie is entertaining, with colorful sets and costumes and a historic setting on an 1890s riverboat, along with a few good songs including the title song as well as ""Please Don't Stop Loving Me"" and ""Down By the Riverside""/""When the Saints Go Marching In."" The only film on here that I don't care for at all is ""Clambake,"" which is just poorly written and directed.

The picture quality of these films is overall quite good, although some could be improved. ""Clambake"" is by far the worst looking. Even though it's in 2.35:1 widescreen, the movie obviously has not been restored AT ALL and is scratchy, blurred, and faded. ""Frankie and Johnny"" in widescreen at 1.66:1 looks very good, better than any other in the collection. ""Follow That Dream"" looks quite good even though I doubt that it has been restored, and it's in widescreen at 2.35:1 on one side of the disc, and in full screen on the flip side. ""Kid Galahad"" looks fine, but there's something wrong with the aspect ratios given on the box, since ""Kid Galahad"" is supposed to be at 1.85:1 and ""Frankie and Johnny"" is supposed to be 1.66:1, yet Galahad appears to be the LESS widescreen of the two, although the aspect ratios imply the opposite. Perhaps the ratios accidentally got switched on the box. Also, some reviewers on here complain that although all of these films are in widescreen, most are not in anamorphic widescreen. Nevertheless, the only movie here that I have a big problem with the picure quality of is ""Clambake."" I watched them on a widescreen, high definition TV. Sound quality of the movies seems fine, although I listened only though the TV and not through a separate audio system.

In sum, I see this as a pretty good collection, but it has its shortcomings. Two other similarly sized collections that have several of Elvis's good films in them are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis-Presley-The-Signature-Collection-It-Happened-at-the-World-s-Fair-Speedway-Spinout-Harum-Scarum-Jailhouse-Rock-Viva-Las-Vegas/dp/B0002OXVE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis Presley - The Signature Collection (It Happened at the World's Fair / Speedway / Spinout / Harum Scarum / Jailhouse Rock / Viva Las Vegas)</a>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis-Collection-Volume-One-Roustabout-Girls-Girls-Girls-Fun-In-Acapulco-G-I-Blues/dp/B004YVO60Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis Collection: Volume One (Roustabout / Girls Girls Girls / Fun In Acapulco / G.I.

2825738,5,B000PMFS5K,"I LOVED THESE MOVIES!  ELVIS IS ALWAYS A GREAT CHOICE TO WATCH!  HE MADE ""CLEAN"" MOVIES (NO CUSSING, NO NUDITY, NO BAD CONTENT).  THE WHOLE FAMILY CAN WATCH AND ENJOY HIS MOVIES.  FOR ANY ELVIS FAN, THIS IS A MUST HAVE COLLECTION!",1228608000,3,230,4.404761904761905
2825739,3,B000PMFS5K,"Two of EP's better films along with two of his worst. I enjoyed Elvis in ""Follow That Dream"" as well as, ""Kid Galahad"". ""Clambake"" and ""Frankie And Johnny were pretty lame.",1212364800,,172,4.580645161290323
2825740,3,B000PMFS5K,"All these movies are available in widescreen, so I don't know what the previous reviewer is complaining about.  Yes, Clambake is one of the worst, but Follow That Dream and Kid Galahad are quite good.  And Frankie and Johnny is an interesting concept and not bad.

The only movie not available on DVD is Elvis on Tour, though it was available on laser.  Come on MGM, where is it???",1187049600,3,381,4.478260869565218
2825741,1,B000PMFS5K,"Even the most dedicated Elvis fan will admit that the king made some pretty rotten movies, and 2 of his worst are here CLAMBAKE and FRANKIE AND JOHNNY, along with the (at best) mediocre FOLLOW THAT DREAM and KID GALAHAD.

Elvis may have been an ""MGM MOVIE LEGEND"" as the box infers, but none of his ""MGM"" movies are anywhere to be found in this set...they're UNITED ARTISTS movies. Why? Because ""MGM"" is merely a name affixed to a company that doesn't own the great old MGM library...Warner Brothers owns those films...so if you're looking for the best of Elvis at MGM (like JAILHOUSE ROCK, WORLD'S FAIR, VIVA VEGAS, THAT'S THE WAY IT IS) look elsewhere.

If you are an Elvis completist and don't mind spending your money on this ill-conceived collection, have at it!",1186444800,9,767,4.674074074074074
2825742,2,B000PMFS5K,"I was really hoping that MGM would have remastered these DVDs to give us anamorphic widescreen versions of these movies, but alas, it was not to be. I can't compare this new box set to the previous DVDs (since I didn't own them), but it looks like what we have here was just ported over from previous releases.  So, while we have ""Kid Galahad"" looking marvelous in anamorphic widescreen, we also have an absolutely miserable non-anamorphic transfer of ""Clambake.""  The other two movies fall somewhere in between: ""Frankie and Johnny"" is supposedly in its correct, anamorphic aspect ratio (and looks great), but with a 1:66 ratio there's very little ""widescreen"" to talk about, so it's hard to say if this is, indeed, the correct ratio.  And ""Follow That Dream"" is a mixed bag, with a full-screen transfer on one side (why??), and a non-anamorphic widescreen on the other (WHY?).

So, MGM absolutely blew it.  They had a chance to issue the definitive versions of these films on DVD, but chose instead to recycle lame product just to milk a little more money out of Elvis fans.  Track down the ""Kid Galahad"" and ""Frankie and Johnny"" DVDs (assuming that F+J is, indeed, in the correct aspect ratio...anyone know for sure?), but there's no reason why, in 2007, we should have to suffer with non-anamorphic transfers, particularly one as bottom-of-the-barrel bad as ""Clambake.""  My old VHS tape looked miles better than this pathetic DVD. Hey MGM, tell me where I can send these DVDs so that I can get REAL remastered versions someday!",1185753600,23,1531,4.842911877394636
2825743,4,B000PMFS5K,"It's been 30 years since he left the building, but the King's legacy lives on. Elvis has been dead (or may not be) for 30 years, and this collection offers cinematic proof of his influence on pop culture--and we don't mean just the signature sneer and perfectly-coifed pompadour. Despite the silly titles and something sillier plots, Clambake, Kid Galahad, Follow that Dream and Frankie and Johnny showcase the man Who Would Be King in performances that are crisp and clever. Kid Galahad, a remake of the Eddie Robinson flick, is perhaps the best example; this departure from the typical Elvis frothy fare spotlights his true acting ability, not just as song-and-dance man filler. And we still eat up the savory ""Clambake""--a hip version of The Prince and the Pauper as Elvis relinquishes his oil-baron father's fortune and trades identities with a penniless water ski instructor to learn about life from the bottom up. It's a rock and roll romp that co-stars our fave Shelley Fabares and the always underrated Bill Bixby. Rock on!",1185580800,8,1031,4.965317919075145

I am very satisfied having this set.......Clambake is not as good as far as picture quality as the other 3 movies, but still watchable.
This set brought me closer to having a complete Elvis movie collection. I think I am still 3 movies short.
Overall this set is just fine, so don't be too swayed by some of the reviews.
We as consumers can only buy what is available and this is it.
So yes I would definitely recommend this set.
Their are no more Elvis movies coming out so get these while you can.
Also the price is very good for a 4 movie set.",1340841600,6,650,4.336065573770492
