8377796,1,B002QH4R4K,"This blu ray is rated for all regions, but would not play. Doesn't seem playable in the us, at least for me. Buyer beware. Amazon was great and issued a refund but exercise caution before you buy",1443139200,,195,4.297297297297297
8377797,1,B002QH4R4K,I had to give this 1 star because it would not play in my Blu-ray player. Quite sad because it is a fantastic show! Info said it was for ALL REGIONS but that isn't accurate.,1440115200,,173,3.9714285714285715

Now if I want one that will play (hopefully) I will have to pay 3x as much. Gave it a 3, I had to give a rating.",1341964800,5,196,3.477272727272727
