2379758,5,B000A88EU0,"It makes me so happy to find out that another season of ""Tales From the Crypt"" is not just in the works, but is going to be released this coming October! Well, it's about time a series was released fast enough; it seems like forever for some people to get another season of a show out. Also, this was formally released before the First Season was even publicly released, so I quess Warner/HBO has a lot of faith in the sales, if they aren't even looking at them to see if more DVDs should be produced. Lets just hope the rest of the series comes out just as fast with more special features in the works. There is supposed to be another documentary on the third disc but nothing has been given so far. Well, I quess we'll just have to shortly wait, and see...",1121385600,4,758,4.23448275862069

2379766,5,B000A88EU0,I was impressed with the Arnold Schwarzenegger directed episode The Switch. Its a great story that gets pretty hilarious actually.  And it stars Rick Rossovich from Top Gun so how can you go wrong!  Cutting Cards ep is one I remember seeing as a kid too that I always liked. A lot of big time actors in this season. The Patricia A. one was just okay but worth it for the creepy clown scarecrow they threw in. I love it when the show added those eerie horror elements.

2379782,5,B000A88EU0,Here are more reasons why this is the best season here are a few episodes to name off The Switch Directed by Arnold Schwarzneger and one of my all time favorite episodes about eternal life and it shows that Arnold can do more than just Action and Comedy he's actually cool with Horror especially as Director. Next is Threes a crowd one of the most Darkest and realistic of the Episodes and just watch it it's awesome. Than there is Lower Berth a very Weird but shocking Episode with the origin of our favorite Corpse The Crypt Keeper so check Thease and a lot more Episodes out,1413936000,,577,4.401869158878505

2379785,5,B000A88EU0,"I must say that I really enjoyed revisiting the past with this Season 2 from Tales From The Crypt.

I was an adolescent when this series was on television. Some of my favorite episodes were and still is Dead Right, The Switch, For Cryin' Out Loud, The Ventriloquist's Dummy & Korman's Kalamity.

And, those were the episodes I remembered. There are a few episodes that are worth checking out that I didn't see because I was in school or my mom wouldn't let me because of the content.

 Judy, You're Not Yourself Today
A woman is warned by her husband not to open the door for strangers but as most wife's do or should I say don't listen decides to let in an elderly woman that seems harmless. Well, that's where everything starts and she switches bodies due to an amulet that intrigues Judy.

Four-Sided Triangle
Let me start off by saying, "" I love Patricia Arquette(Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors)"" is the reason why I got to know this actress. A teenage girl is being held captive against her will but comes to grips with her situation because of a scarecrow that she believes comes to life. It was a little twisted[plot] but all and all a great episode.

Fitting Punishment
I enjoyed this episode because it was the only one with a predominantly all black cast. And, it definitely shows how tough it is being black in America, especially after losing both parents to a tragic accident. Then, having to go live with a relative that doesn't really care about that individual's problems. Also getting put to work in the family business for room and board.

Last thing, if you've ever been a fan of the show its a must have because it makes up for such a short Season 1(6 Episodes) and it's very funny...",1411344000,2,1715,4.512903225806451

2379787,5,B000A88EU0,"This second season is remarkable fun! and has one of the first episodes I ever saw, Television Terror, (It was recorded straight from HBO on an old VHS tape) I wore out the tape it was watched so much, these are absolutely fun, and even MORE humorous than the first season, especially the episode 'Til Death. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this! The cast of this show is surprising at times, heck, even the director's, like Arnold Schwarzenegger! So kiddies, have a ghouliciously good time! Hehehehe! My favorite episodes of this season are: 'Til Death, Television Terror, and The Switch.

Grew up catching these I suppose on re-running on some cable channel as a kid, they were obviously spectacular back then. A lot of them are slap-stick & the same plot re-hashed of a man kills woman/child/weak person & they come back from the grave and exact their revenge.

But the nostalgia, awesome cameos, & genuine fun of these shows outweighs the pitfalls so I picked this up when it went on sale along with S3 & S4.",1305849600,3,528,4.333333333333333
2379805,5,B000A88EU0,"If you asked most fans of this show.. what is your favorite season? More often then not they would tell you SEASON 2.  For good reason, Tales From The Crypt was sooo fresh when the 2nd season aired. There hadn't been a great horror anthology show on tv since The Twilight Zone. So this was a major breathe of fresh air.

Episodes

Dead Right - I love this episode. I have seen it so many times and in my opinion it is one of the best season openers ever. Demi Moore gives a dynamite and cold performance that works so well. Jeffrey Tambor in a fat suit does sooo much sublte work to his character that he becomes it. This episode also has a shocking finale and a great final twist. 4 out of 4

The Switch - Directed by.............. Arnold Schwarzenagger!!!!! Don't worry he handles this episode very well. This episode is just alot of fun and feels so much like an actual comic. Light and entertaining. 3 out of 4

Cutting Cards - One of the weaker of season 2 but still pretty dang good! This one may have you cringing at times. 2.5 out of 4

Til Death - A total freaking fantastic episode. Grisly and horrifying in a almost comic way. The climax is outstanding and will have you on the edge of your seat. Love it. 4 out of 4

Three's A Crowd - The season's darkest and sad episode. It's quiet and unnerving.  It's also easily the most disturbing of the season in some ways. The final shot will make you gasp. 3.5 out of 4

The Thing From The Grave - A very simple zombie story. But it is done with such fresh style that you don't care that it is so thin story wise. Teri Hatcher stars! Great episode that feels so Crypt. 3.5 out of 4

The Sacrifice - Weakest of the set but still really good. Not really horror but a revenge thriller. It works quite well and has good acting all across the board. Not very memorable in ways though. 2.5 out of 4

For Crying Out Loud - One of my favorites of season 2. Yes it's absurd. But it is sooo much fun and odd that you cannot stop watching. Interesting and original for sure. Love it. 4 out of 4

Four Sided Triangle - Another one of my easy favorites of season 2. This involves a scarecrow that may be coming to life. Patricia Arquette stars. Well done in every area. 4 out of 4

The Venriloquist's Dummy - A gross out episode. Very horryfing in every aspect. Don Rickles is great and so is the climax. Very messy episode but one of the standouts. 3.5 out of 4

Judy You're Not Yourself Today - What can I say... it's a real odd ball. Whether that is good or bad... you can decide. Carol Kane is typical Carol Kane and the whole thing is amusing. 2.5 out of 4

Fitting Punishment - Maybe my favorite of the set.  Fitting Punishent is a disturbing revenge tale. It will make you cringe and it will be hard to watch at times. A great episode with amazing performances. 4 out of 4

Korman's Kalamity - Very light, highy amusing and off the wall tale. It is funny from start to finish and never scary. Good. 3 out of 4

Lower Berth - This is classic, at the end you will see why. I loved it. They could have almost done this for season 1. 3.5 out of 4

Mute Witness To Murder - Yes! Another classic. One of the most suspensful for sure. I was hooked from start to finish. It's one of those tales you cannot wait to see how it will wrap up. 4 out of 4

Television Terror - The scariest episode on season 2. Really. This is one great haunted house tale. The atmosphere and music are spot on. So is Morton Downey Jr. All is great here. Flawless. 4 out of 4

My Brother's Keeper - Weaker for a season 2 tale but still a great watch. Not much to say. It's good though! 3 out of 4

The Secret - Great vampire story. One of the most entertaining of the set easily. A great episode. 3.5 out of 4

There you have it! Tales From The Crypt season 2 is a must buy.",1297555200,,3792,4.094594594594595

2379809,5,B000A88EU0,"If you were thinking of adding the Tales From the Crypt DVDs to your collection, Season Two is where you should start. This set has 18 episodes and most of them are essential TFTC installments.

*POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS*

1. ""Dead Right"" - Starring Demi Moore and, hey now!, Jeffrey Tambor in a fatsuit. Demi plays a 1950s waitress with an extremely accurate psychic advisor. This is a great episode. Features a very gruesome murder and a pretty cool twist. 4 Stars.

2. ""The Switch"" - Solid episode about an old man who spends his fortune modifying his body to win the affections of Kelly Preston. Arnold Schwarzenegger directed and he also hangs out with The Cryptkeeper for a while. ""Do you want to be a 90-pound weakling for all of your death?!"" 4 Stars.

3. ""Cutting Cards"" - Classic Tales... about gambling rivals that take things too far. Reminds me a similarly themed episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. 4 And a Half Stars.

4. ""'Til Death"" - This one is about a guy who marries a rich woman in the Carribbean. Unfortunately he was also hooking up with a voodoo priestess played by Aunt Viv from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The rich wife goes nuts and it's fantastic. 4 Stars.

5. ""Three's A Crowd"" - OK, here is one of the weaker episodes of the set. It's about some married guy with a rich friend who pays for everything and hangs out with his wife all the time. I found it borderline-annoying at parts, but the end is very TFTC. 3 Stars.

6. ""The Thing From The Grave"" - Excellent zombie episode with the smoking hot Teri Hatcher. Miguel Ferrer plays a terrific sleazeball in this as well. 3 And a Half Stars.

7. ""The Sacrifice"" - Here is one of the most common themes you will find in TFTC: the love triangle. This one's about a murder plot that isn't all it seems to be. TFTC regular Michael Ironside is as evil as ever here. 3 And a Half Stars.

8. ""For Cryin' Out Loud"" - Fabulous episode about a rock promoter who won't listen to his conscience. Katey Sagal and the voice of the great Sam Kinison star in this one. Iggy Pop also appears and the lead is played by Lee Arenberg, who is famous for getting his thumbs broken in an episode of Seinfeld. 4 And a Half Stars.

9. ""Four-Sided Triangle"" - I love the premise to this one. A scarecrow that appears to be coming alive. And Patricia Arquette is also cute as the little hick girl. Unfortunately, the execution wasn't all it could have been. Still a very good episode. 4 Stars.

10. ""The Ventriloquist's Dummy"" - No summary needed here, probably the most famous episode of the series. Don Rickles turns in a blockbuster performance as the old ventriloquist. Bobcat Goldthwait plays a particularly awkward, sweaty character in this. But it's the dummy who steals the show... PHENOMENAL. 5 Stars.

11. ""Judy, You're Not Yourself Today"" - This is a weird installment about a makeup saleswoman. Carol Kane stars... it's too bad this isn't as scary as the movie she was in where that guy was calling her on the phone. I guess this can be a good one to watch to get yourself prepared for the truly disturbing episode that comes next. 3 Stars.

12. ""Fitting Punishment"" - The only TFTC to feature an entirely black cast. This one's about a funeral home director that is one of the most hateful and demented characters ever in any TFTC. Actually tough to watch in parts. 4 Stars.

13. ""Korman's Kalamity"" - Absolute classic. Harry Anderson's an artist for Tales From the Crypt magazine. His art begins to take a turn for the realistic after ingesting FDA-unapproved fertility pills. I have watched this episode at least 20 times and it's great every time. 5 Stars.

14. ""Lower Berth"" - The secret origin of The Cryptkeeper. You actually meet the CK's mom and dad in this and they are quite a handsome couple. Any episode of TFTC that takes place at a carnival is a guaranteed classic, this one set the standard. 4 And a Half Stars.

15. ""Mute Witness To Murder"" - A Rear Window-inspired piece about a woman who witnesses a murder but can't seem to tell anyone about it. This particular installment required a lot of suspension of disbelief from me. Things just couldn't happen this way, even in the TFTC universe. The atmosphere is perfect though. 4 Stars.

16. ""Television Terror"" - The late Morton Downey Jr. accomplished at least one thing in his career that no one can ever take from him. He starred in the scariest episode of Tales From the Crypt. Downey plays, get this, a TV shlock host named Horton Rivers (an amalgamation of his own name and Geraldo Rivera's). He is investigating a notorious haunted house in LA and the whole thing is broadcast live on his show. Everything about this episode is perfect. The Cryptkeeper's intro is very unnerving. Easily a top 5 TFTC, in my opinion. 5 Stars.

17. ""My Brother's Keeper"" - Here's a theme that became common in this show: conjoined twins. Timothy Stack is in this and he is wondering if he should get a risky operation to seperate himself from his brother. Good episode. 3 And a Half Stars.

18. ""The Secret"" - Awesome season finale about a 1950's boy who is adopted by eccentric parents. I like this one because it is a tribute to the classic horror monsters. They have a secret, but he has one too. 4 And a Half Stars.

Beginning with Season Two, each volume appears on 3 single sided discs, and is overall very nice. This particular volume appeared as a digi-pack set, as did the first season. Every season after this came in slimcase DVD boxes, each with 3 discs. Season Two also features a decent documentary, though not as good as the one featured in Season One. After this, the season sets become very shallow in terms of special features. One other thing to note is that the much loved TFTC episode opening and theme are NOT present on this set. Obviously, that makes zero sense. Hardly any TV DVD will leave out the episode openings, yet here you have it for a show that had the BEST opening and the BEST theme. HUH?

2379811,5,B000A88EU0,"Tales from the Crypt takes me back to when I was a kid. The stories always drew me in right from the intro through the dark mansion into the basement where the Crypt Keeper awaited. I just could never get enough of the show and remember being really let down when they decided to cancel it. Thankfully they released every season on dvd so you can relive the show all over again. It has certainly stood the test of time by being as entertaining as it was so many years ago. It's a must for every fan, and here are my highlights from the second season release:

Cutting Cards: Realizing the town isn't big enough for the both of them, two rival high stakes gamblers face off against one another in deadly games of 'Russian Roulette' and 'Chop Poker'.

Three's a Crowd: For their tenth anniversary, a down-on- their-luck couple are invited to a cabin owned by their wealthy former best man, but the unstable husband is convinced that his wife is having an affair and in turn, he commits an unbelievable faux pas.

For Cryin' Out Loud: A crooked rock promoter hosting a benefit concert plans a scam to run off with all the money but complications arise when he starts hearing his conscience in his head.

The Ventriloquist's Dummy: Wanting to be better at his craft, a ventriloquist seeks out his long retired idol and discovers a shocking secret.

Fitting Punishment: A nasty Alabama funeral home director, who uses any illegal cost saving means necessary to garner an extra buck, gets an unexpected new addition to his home when his 16-year-old nephew shows up.

Television Terror: An arrogant television tabloid host, trying to get big ratings decides to take his crew inside a genuine haunted house rumored to be haunted by an old woman who killed half a dozen victims.

My Brother's Keeper: The relationship between Siamese twins becomes strained when the sensitive one refuses an operation to separate himself from his slob brother.",1247788800,2,1934,4.738095238095238

2379818,5,B000A88EU0,"Tales From the Crypt was the best show on TV, hands down. I remember watching these on HBO when thay aired back in the 90's and loving the show as a kid. I haven't seen it in a while and decided to pick up season 2 to see how it hold's up. My feelings haven't changed a bit, and as an adult I love it even more than I did then.
The shows on on season 2 are filled with gore, sleaze, murder, sex, decapitations, dismemberment, splatter and black comedy. Some of the effects in this are great, even by todays standards. Even as a seasoned gore-hound I was very impressed with the amount of red stuff on screen.
This DVD contains 18 shows that are roughly about 20-25 minutes long. Most of them deal with adultery, gold-digging wives or just revenge in general, and are very clever little plots (most of the time).
This is a 3 disc set that runs about 486 minutes and is well worth the $35 asking price.
Tales from the Crypt is an excellent TV show for fans of horror and I can't wait to pick up the rest of the seasons on DVD.",1192233600,,1024,4.125
2379819,4,B000A88EU0,"The Cryptkeeper is back with his usual set of puns and an overall entertaining second season.  Here's a quick rundown:
DEAD RIGHT:  Demi Moore plays a golddigger who marries a grossly unattractive man (Jeffrey Tambor, virtually unrecognizable in all his latex) because a fortuneteller told her he's going to be a rich man and then die.  Nice twist.  ****
THE SWITCH:  William Hickey plays a wealthy octogenarian who is obsessed with young beautiful Kelly Preston, but she wants a younger man.  He doesn't tell her he's rich because he wants her to love him for himself.  Hickey goes to a doctor who initiates a bodily switch with muscular Rick Rossovich, but things don't go as well as he thought and he exhausts his fortune with further surgeries.  Twist is predictable but Hickey and Rossovich enjoy themselves. ***
CUTTING CARDS:  Over the top story of two gamblers who go to extreme measures to outbest each other.  Lance Henriksen and Kevin Tighe chew up the scenery effectively.  **
TIL DEATH:  D.W. MOFFET stars as a greedy land developer who'll stop at nothing to get money.  Voodoo ensues.  ***
THREE'S A CROWD:  Effective tale of a jealous husband who can't get his wife pregnant and suspects her of having an affair with his best friend.  Good performances from Gavin O'Herlihy, Ruth DeSosa and Paul Lieber.  *****
THE THING FROM THE GRAVE:  Nasty Miguel Ferrer murders his fiancee's photographer boyfriend (Kyle Secor) but didn't count on eternal love.  Teri Hatcher is the femme fatale.  ****
THE SACRIFICE:  Kim Delaney sparkles as a dangerous woman who helps her lover (Kevin Kilner) bump off her rich hubby, only to find a blackmailing Michael Ironside in on their scheme.  ****
FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD:  Lee Arenberg is very good in this modern take on THE TELL TELL HEART as he battles his conscience while robbing a concert for a charitable cause.  Katy Sagal also appears.  ****
FOUR SIDED TRIANGLE:  Tedious and uneffective tale of a strange girl and her love for a scarecrow.  Even Patricia Arquette can't save this one.  *
THE VENTRILOQUISTS DUMMY:  Hilarious special effects and Don Rickles' strong performance highlight this tale of madness and murder.  ****
JUDY YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF TODAY:  Weird concoction saved by the delightful Carol Kane's performance as the victim of a scheming witch.  ***
FITTING PUNISHMENT:  Predictable and mean spirited tale of a murderous mortician and his naive nephew, given some strength from Moses Gunn's performance.  **
KORMAN'S KALAMITY:  Colleen Camp's over the top performance ignites this whimsical tale of a comic book writer who is finding inspiration from his fertility pills which results in bringing his murderous monsters to life.  Fun.  ****
LOWER BERTH:  The origins of the Cryptkeeper are explained in this tale of a carnival freak show and the tragic romance between two of its stars.  Jeff Yagher, the late Lewis Arquette and Mark Rolston star.  ***
MUTE WITNESS TO MURDER:  The best of the season features the remarkable Patricia Clarkson as a young woman who witnesses a murder and then is suddenly struck mute and horrors, when her doctor arrives, HE'S THE MURDERER.  And its good old John Boy Walton (Richard Thomas), who locks Clarkson up in a looney bin.  Excellent change of pace episode.  *****
TELEVISION TERROR:  Gruesomely funny look at how far television will go for ratings.  Morton Downey Jr. is himself and he's perfect for the role of the sleazy talk show host who investigates a haunted house.  ***
MY BROTHER'S KEEPER:  Siamese Twins Jonathan Stark and Timothy Stack just might get separated when one falls in love with Jessica Harper.  Some weird but effective humor in this one.  ****
THE SECRET:  Spooky tale of a young orphan who is adopted by strange parents who have a dark secret; but so does the young boy.  Effective performances from Larry Drake and Grace Zabriskie.  ****",1182038400,12,3871,4.9485981308411215
2379820,5,B000A88EU0,"This one's got some great episodes:

""Dead Right"" starring Demi Moore as a gold-digger looking for a quick cash fix by wedding a fat slob (Jeffrey Tambor). Very entertaining episode.

""The Switch"" starring William Hickey as an old man searching for the fountain of youth (figuratively) in order to make himself attractive to the woman of his dreams. Directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

""Three's A Crowd"" starring Gavin O'Herlihy as a jealous husband who suspects his wife is running away with his best friend for their anniversary. Definitely one of the best ""deadly serious"" TFTC episodes ever made.

""The Thing From The Grave"" starring Teri Hatcher as a supermodel whose agent/ex-boyfriend (Miguel Ferrer) kills off her new beau.

""For Cryin' Out Loud"" starring Lee Arenberg as Marty, a crooked concert promoter whose nosey and annoying conscience decides to speak up. Also starring Katey Sagal, Iggy Pop, and Sam Kinison as the voice of Marty's conscience.

""Four-Sided Triangle"" starring Patricia Arquette as a girl trapped on a farm who insists that her boyfriend, the farm scarecrow, is alive.

""Fitting Punishment"" starring Moses Gunn as a dishonest, penny-pinching funeral home director who takes in a lifestyle-cramping relative.

2379821,4,B000A88EU0,"The second season of Tales From the Crypt continues in the same vein as the first with more tales taken from the pages of Tales From the Crypt and other EC horror comics.  By being true to the originals the series manages to remain stable without trying to improve and change the format.

As is typical, these stories combine horror, humor, gore, justice, fear, sexuality and monsters in an entertaining fashion.  Entertaining, that is, if you were ever entertained by the EC comics being showcased here.  The shows are very rewatchable which is part of their charm.  Nudity is down a bit this season although there are still flashes (both male and female).  The story twists are sill there (my favorite being in the first episode where Demi Moore marries a slob who is fated to inherit a fortune and die shortly after).  Also typical to the series is the huge amount of talent present from directors to cast.

Each story is well presented and true to its original.  Many maintain their original time period while others have moved to a more modern time.  Included in this season are two important episodes, one involving the Cryptkeeper and one involving the Tales From the Crypt staff.  A wonderful tribute to the pre-comics code stories.  The stories are presented on three disks with a couple of interesting extras.",1150070400,,1319,4.787610619469026
2379822,5,B000A88EU0,"I remember watching ""Tales From The Crypt"" re-runs as a kid, Tuesday nights at prime time on FOX, and then Saturday nights after MadTv (1995). Around this time, I started collecting the VHS compilation tapes until I had all of the volumes (they did not contain all of the episodes of the series). Then the re-runs came back on the Sci-Fi channel, and now they are nowhere to be found on basic cable. So, I am very happy that Warner Bros. is finally releasing all the ""Tales From The Crypt"" seasons on dvd.

Another great season of HBO's ""Tales From The Crypt"". There was not a season (1-7) that was the best, each season had great episodes and even the episodes that were not great were well worth watching....

My individual episode rating system:

4 out of 4 stars is great

3 1/2 out of 4 stars is very good

3 out of 4 stars is good/enjoyable

2 1/2 out of 4 stars is okay/fair/decent/not bad

2 out of 4 stars is not very good

1 1/2 out of 4 stars is poor

1 out of 4 stars is bad

2379825,5,B000A88EU0,"The second season of HBO's Tales From the Crypt piled on the gore and gallows humor, not to mention the guest stars and those behind the camera as well.  John Kassir is once again the voice of the Cryptkeeper as he provides 18 bloody tales of murder, mayhem, the supernatural, and other things you'll have to see to believe.  Standout episodes here are ""Dead Right"", in which Demi Moore stars as a gold digger who gets everything she wishes for and then some; ""The Switch"", a tale of an old millionaire looking for a new lease on life (which was directed by none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger!); ""Korman's Kalamity"", which stars Harry Anderson as a cartoonist whose horriffic drawings are coming to life; and ""The Secret"" which features a young orphan given a life of luxury, but both his foster parents and he have some deadly secrets.  The aforementioned episodes are some of the best the series ever offered, but it's ""Cutting Cards"", ""Fitting Punishment"", and the brilliant ""Lower Berth"" that are landmarks of the series, as well as ""Television Terror"" starring Morton Downey as a trash TV host who gets much, much more than he bargained for when he investigates a haunted house.  For fans of the series, this entire DVD set is a must own, but it's a shame that there weren't many extras thrown in.

The following stories are ""Dead Right"" which deals with a lovely woman who visits a fortune teller as her fortune is true as now she must marry a obese man but it might be a disaster. Next is ""The Switch"" which is about a old man who is obsessed with a beautiful girl as he begins to sell his body with his fortune to a mad doctor for a new young body in order to impress her but finds more than he bargained for. ""Cutting Cards"" is about a gambler who plays a game of literally loosing a limb in a game, then with "" Till Death"" has a yuppie land owner who's girlfriend buys a special potion from a island voodoo lady as she won't literally stay dead. ""Three's a Crowd"" about a husband who thinks his wife is cheating on him but on their anniversary he goes insane, "" The Thing from The Grave"" is about a model's fiancee who abuses her as she falls for her photographer as he kills him but unfortunately revenge from beyond the grave starts.

""Four-Sided Triangle"" is about a perverted farm owner who falls for the young farm girl as she lusts a scarecrow who she thinks is actually alive, ""The Ventriloquist's Dummy"" is about a ventriloquist who's dummy controls himself as it leads to a terrible fire that happened years ago, a former fan of his seeks him for help he discovers what really is behind the dummy. In ""Judy, You're Not Yourself Today"" is about a married woman who tries on a magic necklace that switches her soul to a witch's body, next is "" Fitting punishment"" has a urban feel to it as the story is about a orphan who works with his unkind mortician uncle who cripples, cuts off his feet and kills him as later he seeks revenge from the grave. ""Korman's Kalamity"" is a strange but interesting story about an artist who is married to a rotten wife but his creations literally come to life causing murders and falls for a beautiful cop, ""Lower Birth"" is the origin story of the Cryptkeeper and a story of a two-faced sideshow freak falls for a new carnival attraction which is a buried alive ancient mummy. ""Mute Witness"" is about a woman who witness the murder of a neighbor done by a man as it traumatizes her as her doctor maybe behind this, ""Television Terror"" deals with a tabloid television who takes his crew to film inside a haunted house, next is "" My Brother's Keeper"" is about Siamese twins when one of them falls for a woman but the other goes completely mad to kill and finally the last story is "" The Secret"" is about a 12 year old orphan that has been picked up by a rich couple that feeds him whatever he wants and befriends a kind butler, but later he will find what their secret is.

The extras are lacking on this DVD, and as far as I could tell, there were no easter eggs added. However, I do enjoy the two extras we are given. Fright and Sound: Bringing the Crypt experience to radio is a short but sweet minidocumentary on disc 2 featuring Tim Curry. It's basically watching how Curry and a handful of others did a live Tales From The Crypt radio show in New York five years ago. This only lasts about five or six minutes. The Behind-the-scenes shockumentary featurette is about a ten minute long look at the making of the series, mainly dealing with how John Kassir became the cryptkeeper and how they came up with the way the Cryptkeeper would look.

Overall, fans will love this DVD. It has excellent episodes hosted by our favorite host or should I say ghost. I just hope we see Season Three released!!",1132272000,,1228,4.405286343612334
2379829,5,B000A88EU0,"Based on stories from the deliciously depraved E.C. horror comics (TALES FROM THE CRYPT, VAULT OF HORROR, HAUNT OF FEAR, etc.) of the 1950s, TALES FROM THE CRYPT was a TV horror anthology that, like most TV anthologies, had a lot of both hits and misses. Originally airing on HBO and then later in syndication, some of the episodes fell short, but when a story was a hit, it was usually dead on (excuse the pun). This DVD features the complete second season of TALES FROM THE CRYPT.  Following the critical and popular success of the abbreviated six-episode first season, season two was green-lighted for a full 18-episode complement, and all 18 are offered here in their original uncut form (in syndication, episodes were edited to remove non-cable no-nos like nudity, severe profanity, and ""excess"" gore).

Although not as uniformly strong as the first season, all of the episodes from season two are pretty entertaining.  Still, a few stand out above the rest:

""Cutting Cards"" stars Kevin Tighe and genre regular Lance Henriksen as rival professional gamblers who face off in a small-town casino.  The two eventually agree to a game of ""chop poker,"" a high-stakes game where there is no ante and no pot, but losing could literally cost an arm or a leg. Ultimately the two of them wind up in the hospital, each limbless but still vying to be the best of the best.

Demi Moore and Jeffrey Tambor star in ""Dead Right.""  Moore plays a money-hungry waitress who visits a fortune teller and learns that she will meet a man who will inherit a fortune and die soon thereafter.  True to the prophecy, Moore does meet such a man (Tambor), but he is rude, crude, and grossly obese.  For the sake of financial security, however, Moore marries him.  What the prediction didn't make clear, though, is that Moore gets the money first.  Now independently wealthy and with no need to stay hitched to a penniless slob, Moore tells Tambor that she is going to divorce him.  Enraged, Tambor murders Moore and inherits her fortune, and he is soon after executed for his crime.

An episode reminiscent of a Stephen King story, ""Four-sided Triangle"" stars Patricia Arquette as a young runaway named Mary Jo who has become an abused servant to a milquetoast farmer and his cranky, sadistic old wife.  To find occasional solace, Mary Jo escapes to the fields and ""confides"" in the scarecrow there.  On one such occasion, she has a vision that the scarecrow actually reaches out to comfort her, and she begins to have the delusion that the scarecrow is her lover.  When the old farmer discovers the straw-stuffed identity of Mary Jo's ""man,"" he decides to disguise himself as the scarecrow.  His plan backfires, however, when his jealous wife drags Mary Jo into the fields and runs the scarecrow through with a pitchfork to prove to the young woman that her man is not real.

In light of the current popularity of today's ""reality"" shows, the episode ""Television Terror"" is more poignant today than it was when it first aired.  The late Morton Downey, Jr., stars as Horton Rivers, a sleazy, sensationalistic TV tabloid journalist who will do anything for big ratings.  This time Rivers is broadcasting live from within a purportedly haunted house in which an old woman murdered a number of unsuspecting boarders.  Initially, Rivers and his steadicam operator encounter some minor preternatural activity, but since the viewers are eating it up and ratings are soaring, Rivers decides to plunge deeper into the eerie edifice.  When his cameraman is suddenly decapitated, Rivers finds himself alone and at the mercy of a passel of pernicious phantasms.  Ratings are now through the roof, though, and his remote crew, watching from a van outside the house, refuse to help him escape.

The DVD set from Warner Home Video offers fairly clean digital transfers of all 18 delightful second-season episodes of this popular show.  In addition, it also features a couple of pretty cool extras, the best of which is an hour-long ""shockumentary"" that discusses the history of EC comics, the rise and fall of its popular horror line (of which TALES FROM THE CRYPT was a central part), and how famous fans of the comics eventually brought TALES FROM THE CRYPT to the small screen.

In short, TALES FROM THE CRYPT--THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON is a must-own for all serious horror fans.",1131408000,4,4346,4.847090663058187
2379830,5,B000A88EU0,"The Tales From the Crypt series was some of the best television airing back in the final year of the 80s and into the early 90s. Deliberately over the top. Deliberately funny. Deliberately campy at times. Deliberately scary. Deliberately gory. Deliberately one of HBO's finest creations.

The episodes are all based on EC Comics of old...mostly from the self titled Tales From the Crypt and Vault of Horror comic books. But I'd guess that 90% of you reading this already know that, and you're here as I am delighted that it is finally out on DVD.

For those that have not seen these wonderfully entertaining episodes of dark humor and horror...if you're into the genre this collection and any of the other HBO seasonal Tales From the Crypt releases are for you.

The CryptKeeper!  I've tried to master that digitally enhanced laughter all my life!  I'm so jealous of that guy who did the voice and had that wonderfully creepy, evil voice and that cackle that he no doubt worked years upon years to master.

The shows themselves were great, evil little stories you can't help but like.  Since this was cable TV they were free to use liberties (language, nudity, etc.) that networks didn't allow, which made it a touch on the naughty side.  Most of the make up and special effects were good, and since this was reminiscent of an actual comic book the general appearence was that of a comic strip.  There was a certain campiness and silliness about them, while applying to real life situations so mundane and trivial.

I give this dvd realese of Tales from the crypt-season 2 a five star rating without taking one moment to decide otherwise. I grew up watching this on HBO and i always watched it late at night all alone with all the lights out, which makes the whole experience of watching this great t.v. series 10 times better, especially when i was 10 or 12 years old. As far as i am concerened it is about time this great series was finally released onto dvd, and now because it is on dvd it is imortilized and will never loose picture or sound quality like VHS, I really hope Warner Brothers plans to make this whole series onto dvd, there is absolutly not 1 single episode in this entire series that wasen't in some way cool. This season number 2 has lots of classic episodes that i love. I would say, if i had to pick my absolute 2 favorite episodes from this season 2, they would be, Television Terror And Three's A Crowd, but these 2 episodes are just a few of many great episodes in season 2. Since the day i found out that Tales From The Crypt was being released onto dvd ,i think i was the most stoked person alive, and i can only hope that Warner Brothers gives us CRYPT fans (boys and ghouls) the gift we have all waited for far to long and realeses the complete series of this classic t.v. series onto DVD.

I've been eagerly waiting for this series to come to DVD in season sets. Unfortunately, there were a few bad decisions that kinda ruins this set for me.

(1) Who's brilliant idea was it to put the security sticker BEHIND the plastic disc holder and right on top of a photo printed on paperboard? Not only was it hard to get off without breaking the case, but the sticker glue ripped off part of the photo.

(2) Each episode is INCOMPLETE, as each episode does not have it's own series intro/title sequence (which featured the journey through the house accompanied by the Danny Elfman theme), and it isn't part of the menu either as it was for season 1.

If you're curious as to why the episodes on Seasons 1 and 2 are missing the title sequence, read this article.

Tales from the Crypt - Missing intro - Studio Explains
Posted by Gord Lacey (8/27/2005)

Some fans were upset with the first season release of Tales from the Crypt because the episodes didn't feature the standard intro to the series; a journey into the creepy house, down the stairs and then an encounter with the Crypt Keeper.

I called Warner Bros to ask about season 2, and whether we'll see the intro returned to the episodes. The second season will not have the intro, so I asked why. The removal of the intro was a specific request from the producers of the series for the season 1 set. Warner went back and asked about season 2, and the producers still wish to have it removed; no further explanation could be obtained.

(source: [...]

What the hell were the producers thinking! Why on Earth would they make such an odd request? What benefit could they have from not having the intro at the start of each episode? The same theme and almost all of the same footage appears under the end credits, so it can't be because they don't want to pay Danny Elfman for his theme music.

The series of videotapes released by HBO Home Video and Time-Life in the mid-1990s, featured an intro/title sequence on EACH of the three episodes contained on each tape. If it was done before, there's no reason it can't be done now.

Thankfully, enough fans complained to Warner Bros. to make the producers see the error of their ways.  These two problems are now only resigned to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-1/dp/B0009ETCOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-2/dp/B000A88EU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season 2</a>.

2379837,5,B000A88EU0,"Oh, the horror, the horror!

  The one thing that some of the user reviewers are not addressing about Tales From The Crypt is the adult nature of this former HBO presentation. There are a lot of you out there who have never seen or heard of this program, have seen sanitized versions in syndication, or have just heard whispers of the legend of its reputation as scary stuff. I am here to tell you that this is for the adults in the crowd.

  There is SEX and full NUDITY in some of these episodes. There is adult language in many of these episodes that would make the cowboys in ""Deadwood"" blush. The gore effects - the splattered blood and the slicing and the dicing and the cutting and the chopping and the everything else you can think of - still looks like state-of-the-art horror/terror fun. And to top it all off is the fact that several of the top-level horror/fantasy/action directors, and many A/B level actors/actresses participated in making this a fantastic show with very good acting performances. I'm talking about Richard Donner, Walter Hill, Robert Zemeckis, Tom Holland, and several real surprises.

  I am pro-Tales From The Crypt! If you love horror and terror tales this is the show for you. Buy it, love it, and never look back. Just be prepared for the adult content. This show WILL give young children nightmares. It would be child abuse to let a child under the age of thirteen watch the episode ""All Through The House."" And that is my opinion on one episode from the FIRST season.

  As a fan of this kind of stuff you will be amazed when you read the credits of some of the episodes because of the who's who factor.

  Have fun. Now all I need is Tales From The Darkside and Friday The Thirteenth The Series on dvd box set. Oh yea, while you are here on Amazon.com, type in Alfred Hitchcock Presents for one hell of a surprise!",1123459200,19,1854,4.492537313432836
