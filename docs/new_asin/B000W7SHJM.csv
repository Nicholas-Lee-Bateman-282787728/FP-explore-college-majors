2963091,5,B000W7SHJM,"He delivered on his promise.  If anyone saw his original audition, they have to be rooting for Paul Potts.  THis was a humble man, spending probably his last money on his 35 pound suit.  And when he opened his mouth and sang, it was a revelation.  He is inspiring and he really delivers in this album.  They were probably careful in selecting the cuts he made but they are beautiful.  I hope he makes another and has a long and wonderful career.  He is the 'everyman' who had a talent that was discovered and hopefully will be nutured and supported.  BUY THIS ALBUM even if you don't love opera... it is relaxing and wonderful to listen to!",1191110400,64,640,4.410256410256411

2963095,1,B000W7SHJM,"I am a huge Paul Potts fan and, after seeing him live, was very excited about a DVD.  The first disappointment was that the desciption for the DVD states a 55 minute running time, when it is actually only 22 minutes.  The second disappointment was that in that 22 minutes, it repeats some footage and is basically the same song over and over.  Spend your money more wisely and purchase his audio CDs.",1296000000,3,400,4.4520547945205475
2963096,5,B000W7SHJM,"Since I live in the USA, and am an occasional American Idol viewer, I think it is exciting to see new and talented people, who are every day people. Those who one would never guess that they have a talent. Watching YouTube on occasion, I have checked out 2 shows that are similar to American Idol. The UK's X Factor, and Britain's Got Talent, demonstrate that there are people out there, and there are quite a few, who do have talent.
I caught Paul Potts by accident, him being a former winner on Britain's Got Talent, I was interested in what he had to offer, despite the rather average look he possessed in the picture on YouTube. Curiously, I checked out his audition. To say the least, he was (and still is) a humble man, who believed he could sing. When he did sing, and opera no less, brought me to tears. His voice was a little rough in spots, but overall he blew me away with his majestic power, and clear phrasing.
Despite the fact that this dvd is a little short, it does give us a little more insight about him, and the audition that made him a force to be reckoned with.
The price is more than reasonable for this dvd, so check it out, and become fan, as I and millions more have.",1274400000,,1192,4.255506607929515
2963097,4,B000W7SHJM,"This DVD contains only about 25 minutes of material, and none of it is new.  It has Paul's famous appearances on Britian's Got Talent, plus a music video, and that's it.  You can see all this on YouTube.

However, the reason you may want this DVD is because of the superior audio and video quality.  I watched Paul's first audition for Britian's Got Talent many, many times on YouTube, but when I watched it from this DVD, it was like I was seeing it for the first time.  You can clearly see a tear running down Amanda's cheek on that first audition, something that's just not visible on YouTube.  You can see the true detail in Paul's face, Simon's, etc. Little things like that make this a great DVD for people who are really into Paul and his story.

But if you're not a big fan, you may be disappointed with this DVD.",1234396800,,821,4.326797385620915

This humble man has enormous talent and will be a huge success all over the world.  I've seldom been this excited about a new CD and I've listend to Paul's all day long and still have not grown tired.

2963100,1,B000W7SHJM,"Extremely disappointing DVD.  The story of Paul's discovery and rise to fame is surely worth telling but this DVD fails miserably.  It features short sections of the 3-4 stages of the talent show that led to his fame but NO EFFORT has been made to add anything at all to these short edited TV sections.
If you buy the music CD you'll see that Paul's most important note of thanks is to his wife Julie-Ann for being his constant support.  She isn't mentioned once on the DVD - how's that for disrespect to this remarkable man.  You'll learn as much about Paul and his beautiful voice from the notes on the DVD box as you will from the short excerpts from the TV shows (each is only about 3-4 minutes).
And the price of said DVD.........ridiculous ..... you could create this program by editing at home - must have cost about $5 to produce.
In summary, the great shame about this DVD is that we would like to know much more about Paul but you'll learn next to nothing.",1196380800,51,966,4.379888268156424
2963101,5,B000W7SHJM,"If you weren't lucky enough to get this dvd along with the One Chance cd at Walmart then this is worth the money. The dvd presents the sequencial and now historical discovery of Paul Potts and his rocket rise to fame. It stops just short of the release of One Chance which at this moment is history in itself- the fastest produced album in history, selling over one million in about a month going to #1 in all countries. The best thing about this dvd: It is perfect history of the discovery of Paul Potts to show future generations and no explaination needed when shown to the rare (at this moment in time) person who has not heard of Paul Potts. Example: Visited 86 yr. old shut-in. While having tea, I slipped on the dvd. About one third way in to it, she said ""Who IS this man? I have goosebumps!""
