8032711,3,B0002VEOYA,"This is a set of the remake of the program from the 1970's and not the original.  Having watched the original as a young child, the remake just does not 'cut it' for me.",1153958400,6,169,3.9705882352941178
8032712,4,B0002VEOYA,I think this show box set is good except that Lew Anderson is in this and not Bob Keeshan as known as Captain Kangaroo. He was the funnest and everyone laughed like hell when he was in the show. He deserved to be Clarabell for the whole series.  Bob Keeshan died almost a year ago. Everyone will miss him and because that death he should have a box set of him Buffalo Bob Smith and characters.,1107043200,8,393,4.171052631578948
