5424533,1,B00AGKHBZ6,"""Highlander 2: Renegade Version"" makes its 2nd appearance on Blu-ray courtesy of Olive Films.  I had hoped the video problems from the previous LionsGate release would be resolved.  Instead, they persist.  Plus, everything else that made that last Blu-ray worthwhile has been removed.

At a glance, the video transfer appears to be identical to the first edition from LionsGate.  For those unfamiliar with that release, the image is very uneven.  There are moments that look quite good, but they are few and far between.  The bulk of the movie looks to have been poorly upconverted from a 4x3 letterbox source, resulting in a massive of amount of jagged edges (aliasing) throughout the presentation.

Making it worse, the movie's new, high-quality visual effects have often been overlaid on top of those upscaled segments.  In other words, the video problems go all the way back to the actual 2004 ""Special Edition"" re-edit.  So, when this version was created in 2004, the producers must have opted to work from the existing 1995 ""Renegade"" video master instead of making a new film-to-video transfer from which to create this ""Special Edition"".  And, they considered this acceptable for high-definition.

Additionally, there is some banding...some very soft scenes...uneven framerates on added visuals from the 1995 ""Renegade"" version...and a moment during the ""above the shield"" scene where added effects disappear for a frame.

Where the original LionsGate edition excelled was both in audio and extras.  Sadly, both of those LionsGate contributions are absent.  The 7.1 DTS sound mix from the previous Blu-ray has been replaced with a lackluster 2.0 mix.  And, the wealth of informative extras from that release have been removed.

In summary, what we have is a barebones release of ""Highlander 2: Renegade Version"" with the same atrocious video transfer from the prior edition...but at a higher retail price.  If you're set on owning this movie despite its video limitations, it would behuve you to locate the LionsGate edition.",1363132800,21,2033,5.241486068111455
5424534,4,B00AGKHBZ6,This blu ray alone has now been triple dipped! I would have gave it % but because the movie studios released this in different single version and it could have contained this version as well plus they shortly after releasing 1&2 as single versions put both together so no I will not be buying this!,1361059200,,298,4.4363636363636365

5424540,1,B00AGKHBZ6,"An excellent sequel to the original sci-fi Classic
but there's 2 versions of this Renegade release
the barebones Olive films version which has no special features at all & a terrible stereo mix

and the now Deleted Lionsgate blu-ray version which has an incredible 7.1 Master audio mix in
plus a very long 90mins retrospective Documentary
about the making of Highlander II, filming Highlander II, the different versions of the film, restoring the Renegade version
the special effects, the movies reception

the Olive films version is waste of money
so try and buy the Lionsgate blu-ray, you'll have to try buy a copy of ebay",1431043200,6,624,4.933333333333334
5424541,5,B00AGKHBZ6,"This movie is a legitimate 11 out of 10.  It is, without any shade of doubt, the single greatest piece of cinema ever committed to celluloid.  This movie is a tour de force of the human condition.  Please, allow me to expound a bit on its achievements.
Right off the bat, the acting is superb.  I especially love the attention to character detail and depth by the actors. When Michael Ironside, as the villain Katana, says Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. If you don't take it out and use it, it's going to rust, you can feel the ennui that permeates him, right down through his soul. Also of note is the brilliant work by John C McGinley.  Through his line intonation alone, you can tell where his character is in life and what his hopes and dreams are.
It has fantastic plotting and massive scope.  It makes lesser epics like Lawrence of Arabia seem narrow and constrained. How many movies can so effortlessly change fundamental plot details with subsequent edits?  Depending on the version watch, you can be dealing with either extra-planetary beings or time travel.  Movies like Apocalypse Now, even with the substantial changes in its Redux version, only manage to slow down the pace and add questionable character development with such efforts. It also looks toward the future like no other movie with ideas like hover-boards.  Not even movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey, with all its uppity pseudo-science, were so bold.  I was also very fond of the environmental themes that permeated the entire subplot.  Its brilliantly poignant stuff, even in 2015.
Its such an amazing piece of film, and I haven't even touched on the most brilliant piece of the puzzle, The Quickening, yet. And I won't talk about it.  Do you know why?  Because words are an inadequate means of conveyance for such a beautiful and abstract concept.  It puts trite, faux-intellectual dreck like Blade Runner to shame.
I am still consistently amazed that mere human beings could come up with something this magnificent.  So much so, that it almost begs the question of divine inspiration.  It puts humanity into sharp perspective and makes you realize just how menial accomplishments like the pyramids and space travel are in comparison. The movie truly was the herald of a new age of cinema, one defined by these princes of the universe.",1430697600,3,2311,4.797979797979798
5424542,1,B00AGKHBZ6,"Not just bad but, disappointing! I had to watch fast forward otherwise could not get through it!",1426032000,,96,4.705882352941177
5424543,4,B00AGKHBZ6,"I absolutely love the Highlander series, both the movies and the TV show of the 90's, and was upset originally when they changed the plot when this movie first came out.

After seeing this upgraded addition I found this movie to be very watchable.  There are some problems with this film so really one has to take it for what it is, and what it is not because this is certainly NOT Academy award winning material.  Originally before this version came out the writers had seriously did a hack job on a masterpiece that was the first ""Highlander"" film, with this nonsensical alien plot (Planet Zeist"" that had nothing to do with the material of the first film.  That first version of this movie has a number of tremendous continuity errors that it could be an example for film makers on what not to write for a sequel to a very good first movie.

Now that this film has be re-edited this ""Episode 2"" can be included with in the cannon of the other ""Highlander"" franchise material. Takes place in the future, where the world is a dystopia and Christopher Lambert has finally aged since his last battle with the Dark Lord he fought in the other film. He finds that he is summoned for another mission to save the planet (& reunite with Sean Connery) after these alien or rouge villain assassins are sent to kill him. Then with Connery's help, and a new girlfriend, he has to save the planet and fight this evil General.

This movie could have been a thousand times better but I did like this Renegade cleaned up version.

For the life of me I have ZERO idea why this film is rated R, because I would have rated it PG because other then some violence and stunts nothing in this is at that level.",1421884800,,1689,4.411575562700965
5424544,2,B00AGKHBZ6,Best Cut of this Movie. But this Blu-ray contains only the movie and no bonus materials. Very poor.,1416787200,2,99,4.555555555555555

5424549,3,B00AGKHBZ6,"With this movie, it is what it is. If you order it, you most likely know about the history of this film and know what to expect when you sit down to watch it. I was disappointed that there were no extras at all included on this disc, not even the commentary that was on the DVD Renegade version. The blu-ray transfer is good, the special effects look better, but there are some wires visible that you couldn't see in previous versions. Kind of adds to the campiness if you ask me.",1406592000,,480,4.228260869565218

5424553,1,B00AGKHBZ6,"I'm sorry, but I must submit a complaint to Amazon's top executive
management staff.

As I write this review I immediately noticed that the Vote menu, only let's you to pick voting from 1 till 5 out of 5 stars. I'm quite sure the reason behind this is that all Amazon's developers and managers thought every single movie ever made would fit their rating within that interval from 1 to 5. Well, starting today I formally request that an option for users to pick ""0"" must be coded into the website, because the first movie to earn that rate has finally been done, and it's called Highlander 2: yes my friends, this movie deserves ZERO out of 5 stars.

ZERO OUT OF 5 STARS! That's 0 out of 5! (yes, no stars... NO STARS AT ALL).

Now why does this movie receive the lowest rating of all time any movie has received on Amazon? The simple answer is that there is a reason that made it lose the remote possibility of getting a 1 out of 5. You want to know which is? Richard Wagner!

How dare these guys to begin a movie SO BAD, with a Wagner Opera? Richard Wagner could have single handedly:

-write a better script
-act as main character
-act as supporting character
-act as female character
-direct
-produce
-do special effects

10000x times better than ANY of the people involved that worked in this movie. Instead, we got Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery and a bunch of people who apparently were drunk, stoned or simply failed the 3rd grade at least 4 times in care of making this disaster.

I have NEVER seen a movie that gets bad BY THE SECOND. Yes, that is BY THE SECOND. Each second that passes by this movie gets worse and worse. It never tries to redeem itself, it just keeps getting WORSE with every scene, every spoken word, every single moment. Just when you think the movie hit rock bottom, something amazing happens that digs a new lower standard. This movie tanks so bad, it could be used to dig a tunnel through the Earth's core to reach China by travelling through the
center of the Earth.

Speaking of Earth, I would like to know WHO on Earth thought:

-this movie was going to be a worthy sequel
-this movie was going to be a classic
-this movie was going to gross huge at the box office
-this movie was going to win an award (any award)
-this movie was going to establish the careers of Lambert and Connery
-and last but not least, this movie was WORTH MAKING ?

who were the executives that thought $30 million were well invested in this?

Any Shannon Tweed movie would swipe the Academy Awards winning 15 Oscars if it had to compete against Highlander 2. For example: at the end of Act I, there's a scene in which a rejuvenated MacLeod ""skate-chases"" a minion sent by Katana, who's flying in a sort of ""Bobba Fett"" turbine- mechanism. The scene is a perfect parody of Marty McFly's Back to the Future's 1 and 2 scenes in which he skates away from Biff Tanner, only that it's so boring it feels like your watching someone play Microsoft's Flight Simulator. Right immediately after MacLeod disposes of the minion, Sean Connery's Ramirez pops up right in the middle of a Hamlet play and is almost ran over by a dump-truck. I kid you not! It's one of the most puzzling... wait, what am I saying, it THE MOST PUZZLING switch scene I had scene in history! But wait, remember what I wrote earlier about this movie getting bad BY THE SECOND? Well, the immediate NEXT scene is even MORE MIND-BOGGLING! I won't spoil it because I urge you to watch it with your own eyes: you won't believe it.

Whoever worked in this movie deserves to pay perpetual reimbursing tickets and fees (with interests) to those people who bought tickets or rented this film. There is nothing anyone can say to justify their relation with this piece of junk.

Seriously, what a great way to disrespect Wagner and Rossini, and the only way to make up, is to allow Amazon to let users vote a score of ZERO OUT OF 5 STARS ON THIS MOVIE.

FINAL RATING: 0 OUT OF 5.",1377475200,3,3944,4.414600550964187
5424554,1,B00AGKHBZ6,"Their should have only been one is a common joke about this franchise, but it is true.  It's not just that its a bad movie, but it goes out of its way to try and spoil and wreck the premise of the first movie. No charm, no appeal, no magic--a soulless, pathetic attempt to milk money after the first movie created a loyal following.  Widely acknowledged as one of the worst sequels, if not worst movies of all time.  Save your money, and your time.
