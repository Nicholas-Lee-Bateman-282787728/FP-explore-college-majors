Don't expect high drama, just fun and a happy ending.  I love the movies of the 50s.  Great cinematography.",1522281600,,270,4.782608695652174

7804791,3,6300207978,"Typlical Guy Madison movie, but always find them entertaining! Wishing the Charge at Feather River comes to DVD/Blue Ray soon!",1442448000,,126,5.35
7804792,5,6300207978,Another favorite.  Guy Madison was a true cowboy.  Rhonda Fleming was beautiful!,1426291200,2,80,5.583333333333333
7804793,1,6300207978,"There were dead spots throughout this VHS tape.  It was more than a tracking problem, just an old, worn out tape.",1391212800,2,113,4.380952380952381
7804794,1,6300207978,"I was looking forward to viewing this movie, a favorite from long ago. However, the old pan and scan method
appears to have been done by an amature. Meaningless scenes, as people talking are thrown out of the picture
and a table and two pairs of hands are in the scene (an example). Also, the sound was muffled. I realize this
is one of the older movies, not made yesterday. But many movies much older than Bullwhip, do not have the
muffled and distorted sound as this version of Bullwhip.
  Althought I enjoyed the story line, and the beautiful Ms. Fleming's acting, the obvious defects took away
from the total enjoyment I might otherwise have discovered while viewing this film.",1306886400,5,681,4.666666666666667
7804795,3,6300207978,"This is very loosely adapted from The Taming Of The Screw, but only the characters and a two line plot summary survive. Apart from that, it's quite an original piece of writing from Adele Huffington (surely a pseudoym!), Flaming Readhead Rhonda Fleming looks great in Cine Color, and makes us laugh too. A good-looking guy in a white(ish) hat, former Wild Bill Hickock star Guy Madison slips easily into the role of wrongly accused, wrongly condemned, and fraudulently married man. His casual smile brings a confidence to the role that reminds us this is foremost a comedy and that we ought not to be too worried that our hero will end up hanged. But the villains are not so clear cut. fur trader Parnell is just an unscrupulous businessman and never tried to get anyone killed. The hired gun is neither good nor bad, more amoral, but this presents an interesting potential for him to either help or hinder the hero at the end of the movie. There's western clichs all through the film, the camp fire harmonica, the Indians smoking um pipe of peace. There are also a few bits of carelessness. The wagon train keeps stopping so they can film the stopped scenes in a park, and how does Cheyenne fit her bed, a desk, and all her fabulous dresses into that tiny wagon? But it's not fair to judge it by today's expectations. This is a simple comedy western, and on that basis, it is a lot of fun.",1005609600,14,1390,4.51984126984127
7804796,3,6300207978,"The picture on the box, with a beautiful woman sprawled in the dust as a man with a bullwhip towers over her, makes this look like a sex 'n' sadism flick. Nothing could be further from the truth. This reissue of a 1956 Allied Artists movie is almost a comedy. Rhonda Fleming (in the movie, she's the one who wields the whip) needs a temporary husband for legal reasons, and gets jailbird Guy Madison (TV's ""Wild Bill Hickok""), who is scheduled to hang, to marry her. But Madison has been framed, breaks jail to clear himself, and ends up reunited with his new wife, much to her distress -- for a while, that is. This picture is no world-beater but it's kind of fun. Gaunt deep-voiced James Griffith also scores as an enigmatic gunman hired to get Madison until he, too, changes sides.",976752000,16,784,4.489510489510489
