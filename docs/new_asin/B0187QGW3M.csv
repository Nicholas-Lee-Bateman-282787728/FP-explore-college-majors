7541138,5,B0187QGW3M,Haven't had time to watch all the DVD's but have watched the Blue-ray and it is amazing! Gave me chill to see the Word of GOD defended and proven beyond a doubt.,1458691200,10,161,4.0625
7541139,1,B0187QGW3M,"No real conclusion to anything.  We had been anxiously awaiting this to be done. Kept thinking it was going to go somewhere but it didn't!  By the end of the DVD, we felt like it was a road to nowhere. Was hoping we could use it for an evangelical tool.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Wanted to return it as $60 was a lot of money for us to spend on this (in fact we debated if we should spend this much, before buying it), but unfortunately, we were past time of allowed return.  We HIGHLY RECOMMEND the exciting, $35 DVD set, EXPLORING ARABIA's SINAI, by Jim & Penny Caldwell (a 4 hour, 2-DVD set.)  If not still available on Amazon, go to splitrockresearch.org to buy.",1458259200,6,661,4.333333333333333
7541140,5,B0187QGW3M,Great Extended DVD Set with tons of information for those who want to know more about the Exodus of the Bible. Great faith builder.,1456876800,10,131,4.5
7541141,5,B0187QGW3M,"This COLLECTORS EDITION BOX SET is absolutely a must have item. Regardless if you have Patterns of Evidence: The Exodus or not, I would strongly suggest buying this box set. It is a splendid supplementation that rounds-out the original Patterns of Evidence: The Exodus documentary with complete interviews and very informative reviews and more informative and descriptive context. It's no exaggeration that I give this a standing ovation!",1451174400,28,438,5.455882352941177

8741681,5,B0187QGW3M,Awesome! This is one of the best documentaries if not the best one I have ever seen.,1496880000,,84,4.0
8741682,5,B0187QGW3M,Excellent! The best biblical archeological series I've seen yet! It totally unmasks the ignorance & intolerance of most archeologists against new data & debates. I Highly recommend it to educate yourself on the data whether you believe in the exodus or not. You've got nothing to lose,1491436800,,284,5.0638297872340425
8741683,5,B0187QGW3M,"I found the original film, Patterns of Evidence, to be engaging and convincing, particularly when combined with David Rohl's more detailed work in book form.  Tim Mahoney does a remarkable job in interviewing multiple experts in the field, exploring the options of interpretation of archaeological data with an open mind, and finally nudging the viewer toward the more reasonable view in light of the evidence examined.  Certainly Rohl's new chronology is favored by the film, but it's not necessarily presented as an open and shut case.  Mahoney wants the viewer to connect the dots.

Production values for the film are generally very good.  There are some nice 3D reconstructions of the sites in question, and the 3D timeline that is the common thread through the film is extremely helpful for visualizing how different views of the chronology affect how we understand the evidence.  Mahoney himself is a bit boring as an interviewer, and doesn't have much of a screen presence.  But he is asking the right questions, so it still works.  Kevin Sorbo is a bit of an odd addition to the mix as the token celebrity voice over, but he does a passable job.

The Collector's Edition is well worth the extra cost.  The additional interviews and discussions on the 2 additional DVDs really flesh out the argument and are great for the viewer who really wants to dig into the issues in a more detailed way.  The production values are maintained in these ""extra features.""",1473724800,2,1464,4.886639676113361
8741684,5,B0187QGW3M,Enjoyed everything about it.  All the information I was seeking regarding the biblical account of Exodus was there.,1467072000,5,115,5.388888888888889

8741686,4,B0187QGW3M,There is a lot of information here. There is a good balance from both sides of the issues. This is a great DVD for people who are still on the fence.,1461283200,8,149,3.838709677419355
