891609,2,6304462522,"This series is not solid history.  There are two essential facts you must get right to start with in order to interpret the Vietnam war. First you must understand who Ho Chi Minh was and second you must understand the nature of the Geneva Conference of 1954.  Third, in order to understand why the U.S. lost one must be understand the critical importance of two decisions made during the administration of John Kennedy.  First, the 1962 Geneva Accords which created the ""facade of Geneva"" and prevented the U.S. from selecting a winning strategy (i.e., cutting the Ho Chi Minh Trail).  See Norman Hannah's book, ""The Key to Failure: Laos the Vietnam War.""  Second, you must understand the unethical decision made by the Kennedy administration in backing the coup against Ngo Dinh Diem that resulted in his assasination and a deeper immersion of the U.S. into the military government we created without even knowing the makeup of the characters in it. Read ""A Death in November: American in Vietnam, 1963"" by Ellen Hammer. The point is the war is hugely complex and the video series is not. It is extremely biased, Ho Chi Minh, a dedicated international communist is the hero! and the U.S. is the villain. The
It is only in video 13 that the producers discover that the communists are bad guys and it is a belated discovery! So they killed one third of the population in Cambodia, subjected Vietnam to hellish re-education/prison camps and produced millions of deaths, not to mention two million or so boat people who fled the country.  This is the regime of a nationalist?  But they constantly produce a dialog heavy in ideology, communist ideology.  Perhaps that is a concidence, like their land reform program that killed off the landlord class or their police state.  Just coincidences I am sure, after all, Uncle Ho was a nationalist wasn't he?  The video series never takes the trouble to examine the Soviet Union or Communist China's role in the Vietnam war in any depth. It is as if all of history is understood by psychoanalysis of the what goes on in Washington. I use this series in the classroom to teach students how to detect bias in a badly flawed historical series and while there is some good history in it, there is far too much that is poorly done and now, outdated, given new information. Even communist histories belie some of the points made in the series. Hanoi now admits that planning for the war in the South began in 1956 and was well along in 1959, when the 15th Party Plenum ordered armed struggle in the South to begin. For example, Communist Party Politburo member Le Duan was responsible for the formation of 37 guerilla companies by October 1957.  The respected Soviet diplomat, Andre Gromyko, said of Joseph Stalin in his Memoirs, ""it seems to me that the nature had endowed him with the ability to hide the harsh side of his character, and very effectively so. He also seems to have had the capacity to appear at times even gentle and sensitive to others. The conversations he had with some foreign personalities, especially writers, confirm this."" These words could have written about the man who called himself ""Ho Chi Minh"" or ""He who enlightens.""  His frail and gentle manner belie the harsh, ruthless man beneath the veneer. In fact, having studied him for many years, I would have to say he was one of the greatest actors of the twentieth century and one of its most evil men. The key to understanding him lies in understanding what brought tears to his eyes.  It was not the nation but rather Lenin's ""thesis on national and colonial questions"" which called for international communist liberation of oppressed peoples from colonialism.  The trouble is so many fail to study this and therefore miss the import of Ho's ardor for the doctrine. Nationalism is the foe of internationalism and communism embraces only the latter. This is clear from Lenin's writings. Recommend you read Lenin!  There is a video series that attempts to correct some of the errors (Television's Vietnam: The Real Story) in this one and although, it carries some biases of its own, it does help to bring out some of the worst features of this seris.  It is put out by Accuracy in Media and is worth your effort to investigate if you are going to view this poorly done series. On the Tonkin Gulf incident, the Canadian series, the Ten Thousand Day War, is far superior. It seems American film makers are more enamored with Uncle Ho than his own people. Ask them if you don't believe me.",1036281600,50,4500,4.727969348659004
891610,3,6304462522,"This video set is OK for what it covers, but needs the rest of the story.  The only time South Vietnamese appear, with the exceptions of former Premier Ky and a refugee, they are former VC to brag or civlians to mewl  about the horrors suffered -- always at American hands.  American policy is  -- ad nauseam -- footage of presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and  Nixon on the domino theory.
As a six-year project completed in 1983, it  is probably what is to be expected in that the Hanoi government was not  about to let former ARVN officers or So. VN government officials in front of  a camera.  In that context, one wonders how much the content was edited  (censored or permission to interview denied) by Hanoi.  Meanwhile, all NVA  and VC always fought as heroes and heroines.
The NVA/VC side still use  the same tired rhetoric about defeating ""imperialism"" as if the  US gained anything in land, materials or other resources from South  Vietnam, as an imperial power would.  No clue of this is demonstrated, or  any comprehension how much it cost; hence the communists interviews show no  idea they were fighting politics of idealism, as an opposite to economic  imperialism or colonialism.  Had they still not figured this out in the  early 1980s -- so immersed in their own propaganda version -- or was this  just the expedient side of saying it?
Were the subject not so tragic,  some of the interviews, especially the communists, would be humorous.  One  claims to have killed three Americans in a single battle with his bayonet!  Why bother to leave such content in the interview, unless one wants to  discredit the interview without stating the obvious or to illustrate the  over exuberance of victory?  Any idea how rare American bayonet deaths were  in Vietnam?  Another says communists never killed anyone who surrendered to  them!  Another says he led the team that temporarily captured Saigon's main  radio station during Tet.  One of his wounded SUBORDINATES TELLS him to go  find out if they should stay and fight -- when out of ammunition -- or set  off their explosives!  This is his reason for not being still with his men  when they blew themselves and the building up.
Khe Sanh almost does not  exist and then as a sideshow of Tet.  General Giap repeatedly is  inteviewed.  The carrot of similarities to Dien Bien Phu were raised by the  Americans and he took the bait.  Four NVA divisions, a total of about  40,000 troops, plus more as support personnel were not available for Tet.  They were sucked in and chopped up so badly by the Marines and by air power  that they never again confronted Americans in a conventional large land  battle even when they had superior numbers.  Giap never says anything about  this; he apparently was either never asked or the answer was edited out,  and nothing is said about it in the commentary. Giap got three of four  divisions shredded. Are we to conclude he still did not understand a dozen  years later?
While the villagers permitted to be interviewed all  complain about the Americans and to a lesser extent the ARVN troops, there  is a decided lack of complaints about the assassinations,  ""taxes,"" theft, conscription, forced labor, torture, rape and  abuse by the other side.  Again, what happened to the rest of the story?  Curiously, two interviewed veteran raises important points; but there is no  answer. The subject simply changes.  Why did the civilian population always  use the roads when they knew them to be mined?  Indeed, why so few civilian  mine casualties on trails and roads?  Would the VC warn neutral or  opposition civilians of all mine locations? When the civilian population,  willingly or unwillingly, had the VC in the village, disguised as civilians  in the middle of a war, why did they think it legitimate to complain about  being treated with distrust?  Do the uncooperative villagers -- indeed,  liars (""I know nothing. No VC here."") expect better? Again  curiously, while being told of treatment ranging from harsh to atrocious,  footage being shown in three places is of suspects smoking while held for  interrogation. (What is wrong with that picture?) Rather than visual images  contradicting the words, why not skip both?
Without going further into  specific examples, this is good for overview, for the other side's  perspective, for the U.S. government's perspective, and for general history  as an intro -- allowing that 'television history' is an inherent oxymoron.  Take its content with lots of grains of salt and look to other sources for  details and for the parts of the story omitted from here.  One wonders what  the content would be like if this project was redone after more time has  passed, if the interests not presented are included, with more depth, with  less selective editing out and with more thoroughness.",961286400,128,4835,4.8654320987654325
891611,5,6304462522,"I remember when this documentary came out about 17 years ago--I was allowed, even encouraged to watch it, because the memories of Vietnam were still terribly recent. With the passage of time, however, there has arisen  an entire generation farther removed from it, and with recent involvements  in the Balkans and the Middle East, the possibility of another such  ""situation"" is even greater-->just look at what is happening  to Russian forces in Chechnya.
  What this series did was go back to  the roots of the conflict that lay within the brutal nature of French  colonial government, and the maelstrom that toppled it in World War two. A  big issue (in hindsight,) was revealed to be more concerned with  nationalism than communism per se, even though the communist victory did  not bring Vietnam into better days. What it also did was look at the  consequences of involvement in the Vietnam conflict, namely the  destabilzation of Cambodia and Laos, and the ascent of the murderous Khmer  Rouge later on.
No matter what one thinks, this series laid it bare, for  all to see, and felt no need to indulge in prostyletizing, rather merely  presenting the situation for the muddled affair that it was.",957312000,8,1202,4.9054726368159205

I find this regrettable; it would have been better to add to the series to explain why interpretations in the original broadcast are viewed differently today.

That being said, this is still an excellent series and a phenomenal educational resource.

I sometimes compare this series with the BBC's ""The World At War.""  Both series did a good job of getting interviews from all (nearly) sides, and both made excellent use of archival footage.  But most importantly, both demonstrated the point that the ideal time to make a good historical retrospective over a major historical event is between 20 and 30 years after the fact.  With time comes added perspective; make the series too early, and it's really not possible to gain a good, solid vision for the impact of what happened.  But 20 to 30 years is not so late that memories have faded and key people have all died.  Series like ""WWII in HD"" are great, but ""The World At War"" and ""Vietnam: A Television History"" were able to combine interviews ranging from child eyewitnesses through ground troops all the way to high-level officials.",1447459200,3,1240,4.784037558685446

The edited-out material is too good to be trashed, people. The nature of the cuts does seem to point to a type of ""corrective"" treatment, as stated in other reviews.

I strongly disagree with the current trend toward revising history, both in entertainment and educational materials; I think it is immoral bordering on criminal, and --as it has often been a device implemented by history's most notorious fascist regimes-- very unwise. I often hear the argument, ""certain groups of people will be offended if they see that..."" Well, I have been offended many times in my life, and expect to be offended many more, and you know what?

891871,5,6304462522,"I thought this 4 DVD series was well done. There are 3 episodes on each DVD; each episode is about 50 minutes long (and the time went by quickly for me). It starts with a history of Vietnam before the USA got involved, and I found that to be very helpful. It gradually walks through the beginnings of the war and follows it through to the end, including the unrest within the USA regarding the war itself.

Sometimes there is overlap between episodes...not the same footage, but similar topics.  However, it didn't occur enough to be annoying or repetitive. There is about 2 minutes of introductions and commercials at the beginning of each episode, but it's easy to fast forward through it.

Some of the images are quite graphic and disturbing, but I'm glad they included them in the series, since they help to underscore the tragedy of war.

The narrator is easy to understand. The volume level is even. When there is music, it is appropriate.

If you are unclear about the Vietnam War, then I recommend watching this series. For me, it definitely helped piece together what happened.

891873,5,6304462522,"Vietnam: A Television History is an excellent piece of video journalism. I had seen it before, on PBS, and had read the book. I had forgotten the impact the visualization of history can carry, and this production carries a big bang. I was especially pleased with the episodes on ""America's Mandarin,"" and ""America Takes Charge."" My first tour in Vietnam was in late 1966 and through 1967. It was obvious that we Americans were running the show and the South Vietnamese were to do as they were told. That came back to haunt in Tet 1968, when the brunt of the fighting fell to the Americans, while the ARVN was relegated to a subordinate role. After that, things never improved. Nixon ran on his claim that he had a plan to end the war, even though he didn't. For me, by now the Weapons Officer on a DDG, the end became inevitable with Tet 1972, after most of our combat troops had been withdrawn. The only thing that ""saved the day"" was the remaining U.S. Artillery Support, much of it from Navy ships on the gunline, and the air power we retained in the region on aircraft carriers and bombers from Thailand and Guam. The NVA never figured out how to operate under such massive firepower. I left my DDG in January of 1973 and found myself with a job in Naval Intelligence, monitoring, among other things, the continuing war in Southeast Asia. In early 1974, I predicted the fall of Vietnam to the NVA, but was told by my superiors that ""our government"" would never let that happen. I disagreed, but was outvoted in the discussions. That taught me that once senior military officers make up their minds about something, even the facts on the ground don't persuade them.

891918,5,6304462522,"I really like this series.

It presents the Vietnam War from both sides--giving the long background to the Vietnamese experience, and the much shorter-term outlook by the U.S.

For the U.S., the war was a subset of the Cold War.  U.S. Presidents really believed their Domino Theory.  (This is absolutely clear in press conferences with Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon.)  They thought that stopping Communism with worth just about any cost.

For the Vietnamese (or most of them), the war was just another in a long string of struggles against colonial domination--against China, France, Japan, France again, and finally the U.S.

The series rightly stresses the U.S. refusal to allow a nationwide democratic vote in Vietnam in 1956--because the U.S. knew Ho Chi Minh, a revered anti-colonialist since the 1920s, would win.

Thus the U.S. was in the absurd position of preaching democracy in words but denying it in fact.

The U.S. supported a string of anti-democratic rulers in South Vietnam--some more obedient to Washington, some less, but all completely dependent on U.S. backing, since they did not have the backing of their own people.

One of the most telling moments comes when Earhardt, a volunteer private in the Marines who joined early and was fully convinced he was helping his country, comes to the stunning realization, ""I was a Redcoat.  I was helping keep these people from running their own country.""

In general, those with negative reviews tend to take one of two positions:  1) the series upholds an anti-American stance or 2) the DVD series has been cropped from the original VHS version and has added commercials from Liberty Mutual and Scotts, causing some even to be suspicious of a link between the latter two (i.e. that certain parts were edited out in the name of commercial interests).  I have seen the VHS series before (twice) and yes while I would have preferred that the whole thing was reproduced, I never for a second got a sense that the documentary felt different in its approach.  Second, as others have mentioned you can fast forward through the two 30-second spots. There are more important things in this world to protest: this seems quite trivial to me.

Now, when you read some of those reviews it becomes clear that ""reviewer"" did not even bother viewing either both versions or at the least the DVD version.  Again, casting judgment on something before even being exposed to and experiencing it personally does not make for a strong foundation for offering a critical review.

Finally, with regard to those who claim that this is not ""objective"" and has a bias, I would refute such a point by positing that no documentary or book is truly objective. However, in my estimation this documentary is very well-balanced.  We get interviews and descriptive accounts from players on all sides:  U.S. politicians and diplomats, U.S. generals, military officers and privates, North Vietnamese leaders and generals, South Vietnamese leaders, NLF operatives and Viet Cong soldiers, and unaffiliated civilians.  And not all of the U.S. officials and soldiers are apologetic...many still express pride in what they accomplished.  Thus I believe the producers do a good job of letting the players speak for themselves and letting the viewers develop their own conclusions.

One of the best examples of this is two-sided coverage of one particular sweep of a village trying to root out Viet Cong.  We get side-by-side running accounts from participants on three sides (U.S. soldiers, Viet Cong, and the local inhabitants).  This gives us something of the ""Roshomon"" affect, reflecting different perspectives, but we can begin to make sense of how things descended into chaos (as they often due in military situations) as each of the points of view come across.  In sum, those who claim that there is a bias this way or that, I would charge, may be interested in a narrative that more closely approximates their own point of view and offended by any footage that challenges such a narrative.

Aside from the interviews with virtually all of the major figures (most whom were still alive in 1983 when this was produced) as well as a bevy of non political and military elites (i.e. from U.S. infantry to Vietnamese civilians) and the depiction of growing doubts among U.S. politicians in the mid-late 1960s, the series is particularly valuable for its rich footage of the ravages of war in the country. Whether its watching the bombs unload from the bellies of B-52s and explode over the jungles, the destruction of Hue during the Tet offensive, the attack on the U.S. embassy, the point blank shooting of a VC by a South Vietnamese officer on the streets of Saigon, or missions for clearing VC from villages, the viewer really gets a sense that he or she is there while learning about the complexities that led to the conflict and continued to fuel the resistance.

In sum, there is a tremendous amount of information presented and whole host of complex developments carefully depicted.  Unless you are a Vietnam War buff, I believe that the series warrants several viewings -- there is simply too much to take in in one viewing.  If you are relatively new to the war as an area of study or have just a little background, I heartily recommend this series in conjunction with three written works:  Stanley Karnow's Vietnam: A History, David Halberstam's The Best and the Brightest, and Neil Sheehan's A Bright Shining Lie.",1243814400,28,4186,4.910638297872341

I have previously reviewed Stanley Karnow companion book, Vietnam-A History, that goes with this ten-part series. I have reposted that review below for the convenience of the reader. Most of the political points that I have made there apply here as well. I would only add that visually some of the footage brought the message home more clearly that on the printed page and I would bring to the attention of the reader some of those highlights here.

This series spends much less time than Karsnow does on the long history of struggles against foreign invaders of Vietnam, particularly the Chinese. It really starts with the 19th century French occupation and more forcefully the take-over by the Japanese. When the dust of World War II settled there were massive forces in Vietnam who cried for independence but the vagaries of world politics and French imperialist designs to keep Indo-China as a colony frustrated that and led to the first of a series of post-war armed struggles for independence.

The Vietnamese fighting against the French occupation that culminated in their historic victory at Dien Bien Phu and the French withdrawal and the partition of Vietnam in 1954 is well-documented here, as is the then shadowy American presence. President John Kennedy's early 1960's commitment to counter-insurgency as part of the global American-led fight against the expansion of the Soviet influence is explored. His initial escalation and the later increased escalation of President Lyndon Johnson are given full play here. Moreover, there are more than enough `talking heads' high officials from various American administrations to give viewers a clue as to why, when the deal went down in Vietnam they were all, more or less, clueless- except the few, very few, who saw a quagmire in the making.

Something that is done in great detail here is an examination of the morale of the American soldier as time when on and the reasons for continuing the war seemed hopelessly inadequate. Along those same lines, and for comparison's sake, is a rather nice introduction to what the `enemy' thought about the whole thing, including interviews with General Giap, the military architect of the North Vietnamese strategies. Of course, no study of the course of the Vietnam War can be complete without an analysis of Tet 1968, both as a battlefield and in its relationship to a turn in American public opinion away from overt support for the war. Yes, for those who refuse to listen today in Iraq, Tet was a military defeat for the North Vietnamese. They admitted as much. However, in the modern world exclusively military objectives are not the only factors that will determine an outcome. Politically, the North by showing that this was indeed a strange adversary by American standards, moreover one committed to taking heavy casualties to achieve its goals, demonstrated that an American victory was no longer possible.

Or so one would have thought in 1968. Again American politics intervened with the election of one Richard Nixon. The war dragged on for five more years. As a result, as graphically documented here, the American army was almost broken in the process of the Vietnamization of the war. The part devoted to the collateral results in Laos and Cambodia in the early 1970's produced by American actions bears close watching as well as this has not received nearly enough detailed attention.

For those who want a case study in the limitations of a heavily armed army in modern warfare against a determined enemy this series is the place to look. If one solely wants a ten hour crash course into the Vietnam War era this is also your stop. This period of American history was part and parcel of my political coming of age and I found it informative and, as almost always with PBS productions, technically well done.

<strong>BOOK REVIEW

VIETNAM -A HISTORY, STANLEY KARNOW, PENQUIN BOOKS, NEW YORK, 1983</strong></strong>

As the current Bush Administration-directed quagmire continues in Iraq it is rather timely to look at the previously bout of American imperialist madness in Vietnam if only in order to demonstrate the similar mindsets, then and now, of the American political establishment and their hangers-on. This book, unintentionally I am sure, is a prima facie argument, against those who see Iraq (or saw Vietnam) as merely an erroneous policy of the American government that can be `fixed' by a change to a more rational imperialist policy guided by a different elite. Undeniably there are many differences between the current war and the struggle in Vietnam. Not the least of which is that in Vietnam there was a Communist-led insurgency that leftists throughout the world could identify with and were duty-bound to support. No such situation exists in Iraq today where, seemingly, from the little we know about the murky politics of the parties there militant leftists can support individual anti-imperialist actions as they occur but stand away, way away from the religious sectarian struggle for different versions of a fundamentalist Islamic state that the various parties are apparently fighting for.

Stanley Karnow's well-informed study of the long history of struggle in Vietnam against outsiders, near and far, is a more than adequate primer about the history and the political issues, from the American side at least, as they came to a head in Vietnam in the early 1960's. This work was produced in conjunction with a Public Broadcasting System documentary in 1983 so that if one wants to take the time to get a better grasp of the situation as it unfolded the combination of the literary and visual presentations will make one an `armchair expert' on the subject. A glossary of by now unfamiliar names of secondary players and chronology of events is helpful as are some very good photographs that lead into each chapter

This book is the work of a long time journalist who covered Southeast Asia from the 1950's until at least the early 1980's when he went back after the war was over and interviewed various survivors from both sides as well as key political players. Although over twenty years has passed since the book's publication it appears to me that he has covered all the essential elements of the dispute as well as the wrangling, again mainly on the American side , of policy makers big and small. While everyone should look at more recent material that material appears to me to be essentially more specialized analysis of the general themes presented in Karnow's book. Or are the inevitably self-serving memoirs by those, like former Secretary of War Robert McNamara, looking to refurbish their images for the historical record. Karnow's book has the added virtue of having been written just long enough after the end of the war that memories, faulty as they are in any case, were still fresh but with enough time in between for some introspection.

The first part of Karnow's book deals with the long history of the Vietnamese as a people in their various provincial enclaves, or as a national entity, to be independent of the many other powers in the region, particularly China, who wanted to subjugate them. The book also pays detailed attention to the fight among the European colonial powers for dominance in the region culminating in the decisive victory for control by France in the 1800's. That domination by a Western imperialist power, ultimately defeated by the same Communist and nationalist forces that were to defeat the Americans and their South Vietnamese allies, sets the stage for the huge role that the United States would come to play from the time of the French defeat in 1954 until their own defeat a couple of decades later. This section is important to read because the premises of the French about their adversary became, in almost cookie-cutter fashion, the same premises that drove American policy. And to similar ends.

The bulk of the book and the central story line, however, is a study of the hubris of American imperialist policy-makers in attempting to define their powers, prerogatives and interests in the post-World War II period. The sub-title of the book, which the current inhabitants of the Bush Administration obviously have not read and in any case would willfully misunderstand, is how not to subordinate primary interests to momentary secondary interests in the scramble to preserve the Empire.

Apparently, common sense and simple rationality are in short supply when one goes inside the Washington Beltway. Taking into account the differences in personality among the three main villains of the piece- Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon- the similarities of response and need to defend some sense of honor, American honor, are amazingly similar, individual rhetoric aside. There thus can be little wonder the North Vietnamese went about their business of revolution and independence pretty much according to their plans and with little regard to `subtleties' in American diplomacy. But, read the book and judge for yourselves. Do not be surprised if something feels awfully, awfully familiar.",1215129600,9,9091,5.052
891995,1,6304462522,"I was set on purchasing this series.  I'm currently listening to the audio book ""Vietnam, a History"" by Stanley Karnow.  Have just begun, so I can't form an opinion yet.
I was really psyched to get this series but after reading some of the reviews I think I'll pass for now.  I find it ridiculous to recommend this series (as some other reviewers have done) while acknowledging ""minor' shortcomings, such as missing episodes and complete left-skewed presentation.

Needless to say the ""peace accord"" that gave the North Vietnamese carte blanch to wage a unrestricted terminal war against the SOL South Vietnamese is accorded its usual high praise. Ironically enough President Johnson is the embattled sympathetic patriot juxtaposed to the compliant Nixon complicit with Congressional cowards who shamefully desserted our ally to the mass murders, tortures and other heinous barbarities of the communist dictator ""liberators"". Its truely one of the most disgusting chapters in American history. This along with the near defeat but ultimate celebrated stalemate in the Korean War marks the beginning of perversion of American values wherein treason is patriotism, cowardice is bravery, moral fatigue is virtue, weakness is strength, and defeat is victory.

Nonetheless the combat footage is interesting, depicts the undeniable brutality of war (similar to the unbelievable yet conveniently uncovered brutality of the carnage on our highways - to both humans and animals - yes you know as well as I, the dismemberments, decapitations, immolations, and disembolations).

Most of the combat footage, unintentionally, no doubt,  actually shows our soldiers as good and brave men. Never will I forget the footage of our weary grizzled soldiers firing away at the enemy during the hectic days of the Tet offensive. I saw some of that footage as a child and despite liberal anti-war parents and what to me even at that age was a brazenly biased evening new anchor, Walter Concrete, it made an indelible heroic impression on me. I wanted to be a soldier and I wanted to fight in VietNam.

Since the narrative and production bias in this series is so patent as to laughable if the subject were not so serious, it is to be recommended for its cinematographic flair alone.

891999,5,6304462522,"To give this documentary a one-star review simply for the PBS re-editing saddens me.  I walked away from this DVD with a vast knowledge about the war I never had before.  While I haven't seen the original, and would very much like to now, this bare-bones retelling of the entire war from A to Z is absolutely one of the best documentarys I've ever seen.  There is no flour, no sugar, no flashy History Channel editing with heroic music in the background, no interviews with anyone not personally involved in the war (i.e. Historians or war analysts) and simply no misinformation.

They're the sort of message you see before most shows on PBS these days and are virtually unnoticable to anyone who is exposed to media on a daily basis.  Given the annoying studio adverts we have to watch before every conventional movie these ads are lost in the noise.  Furthermore, you can fast-forward them!

The issue of the ommissions from the original is more difficult for me to address, but although I also remember watching the series years ago I haven't noticed even the slightest change in the overall theme.  It's still nearly 11 hours long, which should keep you out of trouble for a while.

Some reviewers have predictably attacked this series for it's content, but I am under the strong impression that in most cases it is because of the fact that it does not fit within a preset world view.  As a historian myself, I can vouch for the fact that all historical works (even those created with the best intentions) are at least somewhat biased.  It is dangerous to expect any work of history to be completely comprehensive.

The harsh truth of it is that Vietnam was a truly unique war in how it was recorded.  Never before or since has a human conflict been given such attention both during and after, and because of this we get a unique glimpse into what war does to people.  We now live in an age where spin has been perfected and those that would ask us to march off have learned their lessons about controlling information.

Yes I agree with the others, they could have left out the commercials, which are only at the beginning I might add, but overall it has given me tremendous insight on the Vietnam war as well as provided excellent film coverage. As far as accuracy and bias, does anyone writing a review on Amazon have some top secret knowledge, the rest of us don't have access too? If there is a some bias, I think it would be impossible to create a documentary without a little. But I do plan on following up this series with more literature and more videos.. A long series, I watched the whole thing in one day. Its just unfair to give low ratings for this CD set. I really feel these low stars are coming from those with a personal ideal regarding the Vietnam War... Personally, after watching the series, my opinion has changed a little, but I intend to watch more, in order to support or not support my opinion.. I honestly think we obsessed to much with Communism at the time, and there were those who TRULEY believed they were doing the right thing. I didn't know much about Ho Chi Minh before watching this and respect him much more.. I also respect Ngo Dinh Diem from the South, though I think he wasn't the right leader for the South at the time.. If I was to point any fingers at anyone its definately France.. I feel they indirectly got us in the mess, and eventually it was hard for us to leave and/or ignore.. The one thing in the beginning that I feel we should have done was let the election take place between Ho and Minh, north and south, and then exit the country with whatever the outcome. The video did make it sound like Ho really wasn't crazy about Communism but it may have been best, AT THE TIME, for Vietnam..So if he had won, which Im pretty sure he would have, the whole of Vietnam would have been Communist, but who really cares.

892059,2,6304462522,"Several reviews on the web have described this documentary as free from bias.  I'm wondering if they're joking.  Sure, for every big controversy the documentarians haven't omitted obvious information from the perspective of each side, but there's more to bias than just getting this part right.  Bias also has to do with sequencing, juxtaposition, and emphasis.  For example, make up a crime--give a classroom ten facts--seven which work against the defendant and three which work for the defendant.  Now have different members of the class string the facts together in different sequences (not changing or embellishing any of the facts).  Note that merely changing the sequence of facts can impact (in a big way--why else the need for high priced lawyers?) the listener's emotional reactions.  With this context in mind, it becomes obvious when a reviewer says that these videos are ""free from bias"" he or she is engaging  in some fairly wishful thinking, because ""free from bias"" is actually an incredibly forceful, vigorous statement--one which would be very difficult to defend in just about any documentary, much more so for one on a highly politicized subject such as this.

Aside from delving into the philosophy behind the impossibility of a bias-free production of this sort, these videos make me--I'll admit it--upset and angry.  The North Vietnamese are always shown as triumphant and unambiguously positive about what they did.  When Americans did things wrong (and in any war, both sides commit atrocities), the EMPHASIS on such wrongs is very strong; North Vietnamese atrocities are glossed over, couched in explanations, greater ""context,"" or simply not brought up.  Cameras hone in on American abuses using ""stop and pause"" techniques, whereas such techniques don't seem to be used as much for North Vietnam abuses (which, as I mentioned, aren't brought up nearly as much).  One instance of biased juxtaposition:  American soldiers in a field beating up (presumably) North Vietnamese operatives--then in the very next scene we cut to them having a good ol' American time eating hamburgers around the grill.  (You know how it is in the South--torture people and then have a cookout!  Yeah!)

To summarize, the idea that this documentary is free from bias is downright obnoxious.  People who suggest this are infantilizing those who are just learning about this subject.",1136678400,14,2384,5.228947368421053
892060,1,6304462522,"Typically, DVDs offer added features that are not found on a film's/program's earlier VHS version. At the very least, one expects a DVD to offer the same content as the video. The producers of this DVD set, however, evidently decided to buck that trend. If you are looking for the same content that the original historical and influential video series contains, DO NOT buy this item.

The first episode alone reveals several omissions, such as the ""red termite"" remark mentioned by another reviewer. (The remark, a memorably racist statement by a French official, clearly depicted the attitude of at least some of the French leadership at the time, who saw the Vietnamese rebels as ""termites"" --vermin to be exterminated. Not an unusual mind-set in colonizer/colonized relations.)

Another blatant omission concerns the French exploitation of Vietnamese rubber plantation workers. Here, the DVD not only edits out footage of workers in a plantation (with extremely vivid images of the slicing of tree bark to extract the rubber), but it omits an entire interview with a Vietnamese national who describes the brutal treatment suffered by rubber workers. This man recalled a popular expression of the time in which the plantation workers were known as ""fertilizer,"" because so many of those who died were buried beneath the trees among which they toiled. Unless you see the video, though, you'll never know this--because the DVD cuts all of it out.

The edits I have seen so far (episode one) clearly seek to minimize Vietnamese suffering under the French colonial system. I can only imagine what the later episodes omit. The producers seem to want to put a fresh ""spin"" on their documentary-watering down harsh imagery and language, and thus sanitizing the war. This is a shameful achievement, and one that I find hard to believe PBS condones. It is all the more appalling given the stature of the original program.

If you want the real thing, then get the VHS. And put pressure on PBS to release the series on DVD in its true, original form. It's worth noting that, on the PBS website for the documentary, even the official program transcript has been altered to reflect the ""new and improved"" version. Why would this highly touted documentary seek to rewrite its own lauded history? Are there political pressures at work? Who knows-maybe these questions will lead to the creation of a new documentary.

It certainly is one-sided coverage and there is virtually no coverage from the South Vietnamise side compared to the plethora of interviews with the 'heroic' North Vietnamise.  All told after the victory (which in itself is a rewriting of history).  So when they re-edit the already edited history to further an already distorted presentation how can teachers fall for this as I noted they did in many reviews.

And, if anyone thinks PBS is objective I wonder why they are called the voice of the left by everyone else.

I think it is watchable as the 'communist viewpoint' but hardly objective.  Still what war documentary is?  They are all colored.

I have been repurchasing older titles on DVD (I am sure this makes Hollywood and everyone else happy) but after learning that two hours are missing and commercials are added I am going to pass this one up and this regardless of my political leanings and regardless of how I view the series objectivity).  The only way to change things in the way movies, tapes and DVDs are merchandised is to stop accepting whatever they throw at us and to stop buying anything with a commercial in it.

892063,1,6304462522,"In the 1980s when I first viewed this PBS series, from Boston's very liberal WGBH and produced/directed by a well-known leftist, I was somewhat ambivalent about it, not fully comfortable with its presentation, but unable to put my finger on what bothered me about it.  Today, some 15 years older and wiser, having studied history in some detail and being aware of Communism's 100 million victims during the 20th Century, I decided to take a fresh look.  I purchased the series on VHS videotape through eBay, as the DVD version was not then available -- which was a good thing as those videotapes preserved a lot of stuff which was NOT transferred to the DVD version.

Notably, at the time of the first VHS release, there was some protest against the PBS ""documentary"", claims that it was highly biased towards the Vietnamese communists, and so the producers added short notes at the end of the videotapes, indicating where one might find those sources of contrary opinion, and rebuttals to the PBS series.  Those important end-notes have vanished from the DVD version, which I subsequently purchased to have a better quality reproduction for my historical archive.  The DVD version will therefore leave the viewer with the false impression there never was such a loud howl of protest as actually happened.  So I will repeat here several of the more important corrective end-notes, as have been censored off the DVD version, and to which the intelligent reviewer will naturally want to consult.

Firstly and foremost, there is the book ""Losers Are Pirates"" edited by James Banerian, with contributions from ""Vietnamese refugees living in the USA"".  This book goes through the PBS ""Vietnam TV History"" series, section by section, stripping away its phoney objectivity, revealing the lies and half-truths, and more seriously the Lies Of Omission (the worst kind of lie, as Orwell noted).  For specific example, the PBS-WGBH series hardly informs the viewer of the vast evidence of Ho Chi Minh's deep commitment to Red Fascism, his years of study with communist cells in Paris, and later in Moscow and Beijing.  Nor does it educate about Ho's assassination program , which he participated in and later led after his return to Vietnam, during the chaotic years of French colonial rule, exterminating most of the pro-Vietnamese nationalist leaders who held democratic sentiments.  Ho wanted a communist totalitarian state from the get-go, but none of the documentation on that is ever presented.  Instead, Ho is falsely misportrayed as a ""Vietnamese Nationalist"", even as he was guilty of assassinating nationalist leaders.  Not to blame American leftists entirely, this was the cover story fabricated by the Vietnamese communists themselves.  Capitalizing on legitimate Vietnamese nationalist fervor, Ho Chi Minh created a gigantic illusion and lie about himself and his motivations, leading his people into a communist nightmare, leaving behind a trail of corpses,  complete with ""land reform"" programs which basically turned all colonial lands into state lands, abandoning the peasants except to forcibly organize them into communist agricultural communes, complete with thought-control, neighborhood spy systems, village level ""people's trials"", and with the inevitable firing squads.  Mass graves began to fill in Northern Vietnamese regions controlled by the communists, with anyone who dared to object, including whole families who tried to flee to French-held non-communist territory.

None of this is detailed in the series, however.  Similarly not described, the repeated communist violations of treaty agreements made with the ""capitalist enemy"" of the south -- the Geneva Accords, the Paris Accords, and minor truces of all sorts -- were nearly immediately violated by the North Vietnamese, and their created Viet Cong cadres in the South.  The evidence for the Viet Cong being fabricated, controlled and by the North Vietnamese communists also is never detailed.  While many discontented Vietnamese nationalists joined the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, often as not, after being exposed to their propaganda and methods, the flow of desertions in the other direction was just as brisk.  But none of the testimony from Vietnamese officials or citizens on this important issue is revealed.  No hint of dissention on such issues ever appears, which are nearly uniformly cast as ""fact"" purely on the basis of testimony or claims from communist sources -- revealing how the PBS producers were NOT interested in objetivity, presenting both sides, but only that which would support the communists, and misportray the French and USA as villans.  Likewise, the NVA/VC terrorism in South Vietnam always exceeded, by perhaps a factor of 10, anything ever done by the USA during Operation Phoenix.  Viet Cong massacres of entire families of South Vietnamese officials, with public beheadings and disembowlments in the nature of the Fallujah criminals,  are never mentioned, even though this was a major terror tactic of the Viet Cong -- and one of the pre-existing factors which led to the creation of Operation Phoenix, which aimed to assassinate Viet Cong leaders.  Likewise, the massacre at Hue -- where NVA and VC forces executed something between 3-5000 civilians in cold blood -- is but one of many similar examples which are glossed over in the Vietnam TV History series.  Old communist thugs, sneering with pride at their butchery, are interviewed in such cases, without identifying who they really are, and it is misportrayed as if ""ordinary civilians"" are being interviewed, rather than high-up communist party officials, or spies who lived in Hue only to emerge after the NVA forces took over, helping after to ""round up"" the government workers and their families who would be shot in the head and dumped into pits in the jungle.  And so on.  ""Losers Are Pirates"" is filled with documentation and eye-witness testimony on the events NOT covered in this phoney PBS ""TV history"", which was a heart-break for all the refugees who survived the nightmare of communist aggression in SE Asia.

Events DURING and AFTER the fall of South Vietnam are likewise obliterated from open discussion. For example, the full-scale NVA invasion (who were fully equipped with Soviet and Chinese tanks, artillery, troops, etc., in total violation once again of every treaty agreement) are NOT covered in the DVD version, supporting the overall lie that a communist victory was inevitable, and no treaty violation was worth to mention if that violation brought the communists closer to power.  In fact, the entire last segment  of the PBS series, titled ""Legacies"" which appeared in the VHS version, is NOT repeated on the DVD version.  Why would the PBS-WGBH producers leave out an entire segment of the original production?  Because ""Legacies"" was produced late in the series, after the first segments had been shown on USA television and after those segments had triggered the legitimate outrage from so many American military and Vietnamese refugees, who had lived through all those terrible events, and knew what was being lied about, and omitted.  So, ""Legacies"" was created to present at least some of the ""dark side"" of the communist victory.  It detailed some aspects of the miserable Boat People, hundreds of thousands of ""liberated"" Vietnamese risking death on the high seas just to escape the communist paradise.  You can still buy ""Legacies"" on VHS, separately, but even this small begrudging admission of communist crimes (white-washed as they were in ""Legacies"") was ""too much"" for PBS to include today.  ""Legacies""  also details the communist genocide in Cambodia -- sort of -- like Noam Chomsky, they cannot quite bring themselves to admit that millions were massacred by the communists, and of course they try to blame it all on the USA, even though it was communists who were pulling the triggers, and strangling victims in every case.

The facts of Pol Pot's totally communist origins, his links to the Vietnamese communists and hence to Moscow and Beijing, is again glossed over and distorted, with emphasis placed on his much later disagreements and power-struggles with fellow Vietnamese communists.  Likewise, Sianouk's hate for democratic America, and love of the dictatorial communists is totally ignored.  Even ""Legacies"" fails to mention such ""small details"" as the tens of thousands of ordinary Vietnamese who were slaughtered during the last months of the war, in Vietnam, being deliberately machine-gunned and pounded by artillery as they fled along narrow roads leading south, away from the advancing NVA military.  The ""Highway of Terror"", where one had to carefully step over the corpses of women and children scattered mile after mile along the roads -- perhaps 50,000 dead civilians within a few days... but really, the photos of that atrocity are buried in North Vietnamese archives, never released to the public.  Much easier to point to Mai Lai.  But... this is ""ancient history"", and nobody wants to hear it today.

Vietnam TV History instead displays numerous interviews with self-righteous communist cadres and old war-criminal Vietnamese generals, who give their ""heroic"" side of things, always with the smear against the USA and French, and distortion of fact and events -- as if only North Americans are liars, while Vietnamese communists can always be trusted to tell the truth --  but the producers don't even make the slightest attempt to counter their bald propaganda by  interviews with non-communist Vietnamese leaders, or by US generals or troops, except in ways that are calculated to make them appear as evil, stupid, cowardly, sadistic, and so forth.  No such prejudicial treatment is afforded to the communists, however!  Even the occasional racist or rapacious statement by a communist official is translated into English so as to ""tone it down"", always to make them appear as ""rational"", ""feeling"", ""knowledgable"" and ""honest"".  Only native Vietnamese-speakers will pick up on this, which is where ""Losers Are Pirates"" educates.  Exactly the opposite treatment is given by the PBS directors to American and South Vietnamese officials.

The producers even use old East German and NVA propaganda movies, without identifying them as such, as if they are ""real"" battle-scenes!  And of course, how heroic the VC and NVA appear -- one never hears Ho Chi Minh roaring that ""he"" would willingly sacrifice the entire generation of Vietnamese Youth, and fight for 20 or 30 years if necessary, to secure a Red Fascist communist paradise., much as Hitler or Stalin screeched from their podiums, nor do we see any quotes from Chairman Ho praising Stalin and his cruel methods.  And one also never hears much about Laos, which was gobbled up by the Vietnamese communists, nor about the very many good things of South Vietnam -- its chaotic but vital democracy, the freedom of speech and of the press which existed, the higher GNP, food production, standard of living, etc., etc., which they held over the communist North... all that is distorted as well, as the South Vietnamese are misportrayed as drug-pushers, prostitutes, parasites living off American military encampments, secretly sympathetic to the communists, and cowards on the battlefield.  One wonders why the Tet offensive failed so miserably, as NOT ONE South Vietnamese city rose up to join the communist forces against the Americans -- perhaps because the VC during Tet had the bad habit of shooting rockets and mortar shells into residential neighborhoods of the cities they wanted to ""liberate""? -- and even after the fall of the South, so many Vietnamese took to boats or fled on foot, to escape what everyone knew was coming when the communists took over.  Many died in the escape attempts, and others who were caught trying to escape also faced death. Death camps (excuse me, ""re-education camps""), totalitarianism, controls over press, speech, thinking, actions, work, neighborhood spys, restrictions on travel, listening to foreign radio, etc., etc.  ""Vietnam TV History"" mentions nothing of any of this.  Any wonder why ordinary Vietnamese often behave so friendly towards Americans who visit Vietnam?

Ho Chi Minh is always misportrayed as a gentle old fellow, loving of his countrymen, in his heart wanting a Jeffersonian democracy for Vietnam, but thwarted by those mean old Americans --- one wonders how it went so wrong, how Cambodia slipped into genocidal butchery, and so forth with so many well-intentioned enlightened communists being in control, and all the evil capitalist being driven out.  Of course, this is balderdash, and the butchery which gripped SE Asia after the fall of non-communist South Vietnam is totally the responsibility of the victorious communist forces, who after the war could have shaped events however they wished.  And they did, which is why genocidal butchery occurred!  That is what they wanted!  History shows, that is fairly standard practice whenever communists take over.

Another rebuttal documentary is the VHS production ""Television's Vietnam: The Real Story"" and ""Televisions's Vietnam: The Impact of the Media"", which detail how our major news figures -- such as Walter Cronkite -- basically repeated the communist propaganda, helping to seal the fate of the South Vietnamese.  Don't believe it?  Get these documentaries and judge for yourself.  Both are available on a single VHS casette from Accuracy In Media [...]  This VHS, and the ""Legacies"" VHS, and the ""Losers Are Pirates"" book are necessary reading, assuming you want the facts.

Don't take my word for anything, but don't believe the ""standard lies"" of the left-wing on this subject either. Educate yourself, by reading the penetrating analysis as given in these rebuttals.  Dig  deeper than the shallow propaganda presented in this PBS series. That is, assuming fact and truth hold meaning for you.  For the producers of this PBS series, fact and truth meant nothing.",1114214400,54,13983,5.22973578145992
892064,1,6304462522,"Vietnam, A History:  Not even close.  This compliation ""documentary"" is no more than typical PBS diatribe.  Very little if any factual information is conveyed.  The only redeeming quality of this series are the film footages although these are highly edited to give the anti-American stances of PBS and Stanley Karnow.

892123,1,6304462522,"This is the usual journalistic mixture of important, trivial, direct falsehoods, and falsehoods of omission.  It is the usual flash, trash, hype, and jive.  Rare events are featured which gives the viewer the impression that they were common.  Here is a hypothetical example.  A police officer kills an innocent person on purpose.  The program then implies that this is commonly done and is the official policy of the police agency and the US government advisors and the reason you never heard about these widespread killings was that there was an official government coverup.  The most useful thing you can do with this is to compare the information presented with the memoirs of Henry Kissinger and the books listed below.  This should cure you of ever believing what is presented in the news.
 Here is one example of the misrepresentation in the program.  You may remember the famous photo of the captured person being shot in the head.  This program calls him a Vietcong.  In reality this person was a regular North Vietnamese Army officer whose assignment was to kill the family members of South Vietnamese officials.  The Geneva Convention on Land Warfare requires combatants to wear distinctive uniforms.  It allows the killing of captured members of the other side who were not wearing distinctive uniforms.

Another example of stupid comments is on one operation where the Marines went into an enemy stronghold to destroy the supplies and tunnel complexes and then leave.  The narrator makes the stupid comment that the enemy soldiers returned to the area after the Marines left as if the Marines had not accomplished their mission.

It is common for government heads to say one thing in speeches and do another in private.  Saudi Arabia is an example in the recent middle east war.  Public speeches said that they would not help the US forces.  In private they allowed use of their bases.  This program shows similar speeches without commenting on what happened in private.  Cambodia is an example where they wanted out help against the North Vietnamese presence but gave speeches to the opposite.

The Pentagon Papers
A Rumor of War
Decent Interval
Decision for Disaster

You will learn from The Pentagon Papers that President Johnson was quite aggressive in escalating the war against the advice of the CIA and other agencies and that he would make decisions on his own without consultation.  This program gives the false inference that President Johnson was pulled into the war reluctantly and by others.

The book Decision for Disaster is by an insider on the Bay of Pigs invasion.  You will learn about how unskilled the Kennedy white house staff and appointed state department officials were.  This same poor judgement carried over into the administration's policy in Vietnam.

892125,5,6304462522,"I rarely watch television but I have made an exception for this wonderful series of PBS shows about the war in Vietnam.  This series ranks up there with Ken Burns Civil War and the BBC World at War.  This covers the war in Vietnam from all angles.  Not only is the French war included, but the interlude when North and South Vietnam were separated.  Of course, the concentration is where it should be--the American involvement in a difficult and costly war.  The one gripe I have is many of the GIs were from the Boston area (including John Kerry), and so one didn't get a snapshot of the entire country.

One moment I remembered is when the story is recounted of Marines storming into a South Vietnamese villiage.  At least one and possibly more villagers were shooting at the Marines and killed some.  When the Marines entered into the village, they tossed grenades into occupied houses, and shot villiagers.  From the Vietnamese perspective, the villagers were just innocents going about their everyday existence, and no one mentions the armed villagers killing Marines.  From the Marines perspective, somebody killed their friends and someone was gong to pay.  This demonstrates the fog of war.

I was young when this war was going on, but even now it is a controversial subject to discuss with anybody.  I really did disagree with some of those being interviewed, and can see why the Vietnam War is still difficult to discuss today.  However if one sees the DVD, one has a better idea of the subject and why it was such a hot topic.

After seeing this DVD and reading Karnow's book, I now better understand the Vietnam War.  This is truly a must see, for those wanting to better understand why the United States got itself into such a difficult war.  Highly recommended.",1102464000,12,1775,4.711038961038961

(They only recieved American assistance when they were out of power and a small part of an ad hoc group of armed bands harassing the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia; during their oft-denied - by anti-war leftists like Noam Chomsky - autogenocide of millions of their own citizens, the Khmer Rouge were squarely in the communist bloc.)

Yeah there are 2 commercials before each episode - tacky I know but with dvd its very easy to fast forward and get to the program....

Bottom line is that this documentary was put together in scope and timeline with the footage, interviews and narration that is second to none.....I particalarly liked the episode that focused on ziem and how the US gave the go ahead to assasinate him....

The end of the tunnel episode really captures the essence of a country being overrun and conquered by the enemy - the panic, chaos and deterioration of the chain of command was depicted with great insight and passion.

Every episode is interesting and there are no ""boring"" moments...all the footage and interviews tell an interesting story about the war....its almost like watching a drama series and waiting to see what happens next episode.

892130,2,6304462522,"I was a huge fan of this series when it first aired on PBS in 1983 and I taped the whole thing. So when it came out on DVD I thought I'd invest in the new format, seeing as my tapes were now 20 years old and I wanted to be able to watch it again and share it with others without fear of it disintegrating.

 Boy, was I in for a letdown. First of all, this edition is loaded with commercials. That's right, commercials. That was the last thing I expected to see on an expensive DVD set. But no, every episode is prefaced with no less than 2 commercials: one for Liberty Mutual and one for the Scott lawn care company. I could have lived with a brief mention of the companies that funded the series, but not only are these full-blown commercials, they aren't even the companies that funded the making of the series! WGBH has sold commercial time to companies who had nothing to do with the making of this docmentary. If that weren't enough, we get to see the same commercials at the end of every episode, followed by a plug for PBS. I paid $60 for this???

 But the most shocking thing about this set is that it's been edited down from the original series. I couldn't believe it. I haven't had a chance to compare every episode on the DVD set with my old tapes, but there is a segment near the end of episode 1 that has been deleted. In the original episode 1, a French colonel being interviewed about Dien Bien Phu talks about the end of the infamous seige and refers to the Viet Minh as ""Red Termites"". This has been lopped off the DVD version. I can only dismay at the thought of other expurgations. Was it purged for political correctness or to make room for the commercials? I can't say. I don't yet know if the other episodes are similarly truncated, but in my opinion none of them should have been. This series is too important to let commercial expediency diminish its journalistic integrity.

 Thank goodness I still have my old tapes. Now I think I will digitize them onto DVD so I can preserve the work in the form the film maker intended.",1091145600,506,2048,4.2927461139896375
