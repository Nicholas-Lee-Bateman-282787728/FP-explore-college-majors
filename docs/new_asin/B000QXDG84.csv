2850510,5,B000QXDG84,"Fans of Inuyasha will not be disappointed. The animation is clean and clear with no complaints and as always the voice actors/actresses for both the Japanese and English cast did great. Inuyasha is more than just a story it really has a great deal of characters that come together. A jealous love triangle of Inuyasha, Kikyo and Kagome, and to many traps and foes, Inuyasha shows that fighting, love and courage conjuration all. Making friends along the way and keeping his head held high.
This was another great season though it is mostly filler. With Naraku hiding, many demons are now coming out in the open making things very stressful for the group. Like the rest of the seasons, this blends action, romance in humor perfectly.",1479254400,,732,4.817460317460317

2850548,5,B000QXDG84,"My first InuYasha DVDs were in Japanese voice format only, and they were already ""old"" when I discovered InuYasha in 2006.
Though I finally learned to speak passable Japanese, I thought that I should also purchase these contemporary ""English-speaking"" versions, for the future.
Yes, I do love this ""Feudal Fairy Tale""; ""InuYasha"" was my first anime love, and you never forget that one.

2850637,5,B000QXDG84,"These reviews are all copies, because what else can I say about a great series that has many seasons?

These repackages are literally the same products and episodes, just condensed in terms of packaging and price.

Standard definition - so 4:3 ratio with obvious static and other SD flaws, but that's cool. There isn't much you can do when upconverting an original SD work.

There are Bluray discs of the final act and the movies, but that is probably all there will ever be.

Japanese Audio with English subs is indeed available on these discs.",1433116800,,545,4.705263157894737

2850670,4,B000QXDG84,"I am a huge Inuyasha fan! I am on the mission of owning the whole series and I'm almost there thank god! This season 4 set is just as good as the past 3. It has a nice cover and has 4 discs inside with all the episodes. Now a lot of people are complaining that it doesn't have a box cover and that is true it does not. However I don't see how that is a problem? Yes it is just a plain DVD case and it doesn't have a fancy decorated box slip but that doesn't affect the actual DVDs.

The DVDs themselves are nothing special either just colored DVDs with the episode numbers on it but again thats just looks. They play really smooth with no glitches or skips. The picture is clean and really high quality for not being Blu Ray The menu is really easy to navigate through and like the others you can choose to listen in Japanese or English. Now the reason I am giving this a 4/5 stars is because they still don't tell you anywhere on the case or DVD the names of the episodes! This can get frustrating because if your not someone with a good memory it is easy to forget where you left off and then your forced to go through all the previous episodes til you find the one you last watched.

Other than that one downside though this DVD is really great for any Inuyasha fan who is like me trying to collect all the seasons. I haven't bought one DVD that I regret. Which is a plus given the price. Which some may say is cheap but I'm on a budget so when I spend 20 plus bucks on a DVD I expect great quality results especially since this isn't Blu Ray and so far theses ones don't disappoint. I say it's a must buy if you love Inuyasha!",1427414400,,1630,4.027777777777778

The plots of season four are interesting as the story makes a pivotal transition. This season does go a little quickly though since it is only 4 DVDs (18 episodes) versus the prior seasons with 5 DVDs (~25 episodes). As with the other seasons, I suggest watching it in the original dubbing (w/ subtitles if necessary) since the English version sometimes is not perfectly accurate to the original (naturally).",1345680000,,514,4.8522727272727275
2850943,5,B000QXDG84,"Very happy I got this season, I was unsure because of some of the negative comments - it's hard to know what to believe when passionate people praise or attack a program they like.

Yes, it is ""lighter"" than other sets. I'm happy about that, though. I do not always want to view lots of tension and intrigue, especialy before going to sleep. It is nice to be able to play an episode or two and just be entertained, or laugh.

For example, the episode ""Mysterious, lecherous monk"" is about Mirouku getting in trouble because Hatchi (raccoon spirit) impersonates him. There is one with ""the 3 sprites of the Monkey God"", where Shippo is more of a dominant character. It's really cute, and there are jokes you must know a bit about Japanese culture to get. For example, what happens to the stone that is a relic from the monkey god's shrine ... hysterical, if you know the reverence due such an object, and the solemness a shrine's protectors should show.

A few more plots: There is one where Kagome's school admirer visits at the same time as Inuyasha, because she has a cold. Another has Shessomaru meeting Koga ... also funny, more so if you know how wolves and feudal Japanese should act to one another. There are episodes featuring Kikyo and Kagome working together, Koga and his young fiancee, and one with Kagome's little brother falling in love. There's one focusing more on Rin and Jaken. One focuses on Kirara disappearing, and ""the black Kirara"" stars another 2-tailed cat, a little girl, and Shippo. I like them all, and I liked seeing their personalities more than when focus is on the usual main characters.

I think, as a writer and a fan, that it is good to see more of the supporting characters than usual in an episode. It helps understand them. Why do they react - or don't - to certain events? How do they relate to each other, and how did their relationships blossom?

The disks fold out, and have a slipjacket. There are subtitles, but I had problems switching those off and resuming the episode. I have had to reset the subtitles and then select the scene I want to go to, instead of using a ""resume"" option. Otherwise it just plays from the very beginning episode again.

If you're impatient to get to the Naraku-fighting parts, skip to season 5.",1341964800,5,2268,4.573891625615763

2850980,1,B000QXDG84,"I love the InuYasha story, and have been addicted to the other seasons, but this was a total disappointment.

The problems
1.  It is twice as expensive as the other seasons
2.  It is short, only 18 or so episodes
3.  It is all fillers
4.  They really don't even seem like good fillers- I didn't learn any more about the characters
5.  There is nothing in the fillers that even really relates to the main plot- Everything that is ""new"" in this entire season is revealed in the first minute of season 5.

So... if you have plenty of money and time to just be occupied, there's nothing wrong with this.
But for twice the price, just buy season 5 & 6 and use the money and time you would have wasted to do something more enjoyable- you won't miss anything from the story.

Of course, I would have bought it anyway, even if someone had warned me about how lame this season is... but I probably would have bought a used version to save on the cost.  If it had cost half as much as the other seasons and not more, I would not have felt so disappointed.",1262044800,7,1045,4.185

These episodes are still good even with being filler episodes. Jeesh people. Yes they are fillers, but where is the problem with that? Is more episodes of Inuyasha that bad? Not for me. I absolutely love it. The producers of the Inuyasha series simply started early and caught up too fast with Inuyasha's creator Rumiko Takahashi. So, they had to do some improvising and instead of waiting for her to get further enough along, they created fillers. This is the same thing that happened with season 7, but they decided not to make another season full of fillers, so they dropped it. Now, answer me this: Would you have preferred them to drop it after Season 3. I certainly wouldn't and I really wished that they would have gone ahead and made another season after 7 of fillers instead of dropping it. Besides, this isn't a bad season IF you like the show. Believe me this is a good season. I love Jaken Falls Ill. It is so funny. Take it from me. It is worth the buy, but not for full price.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inuyasha-Season-4-Box-Set/dp/B000QXDG84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inuyasha - Season 4 Box Set</a>",1250121600,,1332,4.898230088495575
2850982,5,B000QXDG84,"Alright, let me start off by saying:

I bought this DVD set from Best Buy, and paid... I think 95.00 for it. BUT.. i thought it was because it came with ""Miroku's Prayer Beads"" A little re-creation of the beads Miroku wears around his right arm. They were fun to play with, and if I bought them, I would have paid 12.00 for them... so all in all, i didn't feel too jipped by the price of this season.

Anywhoo.. I saw a lot of negative complaints about this season, and here are my thoughts:

Yes, this Set contains about 18 episodes or so. This was the biggest dissapointment to me BECAUSE.. the bulk of the episodes were really light-hearted and silly. In most of the seasons i feel i HAVE to watch episode after episode because they end so abruptly, in the middle of a fight. These episodes stand alone very well, and there were no Naraku heavy episodes (since he was in hiding). The reason this is my favorite season is because of that. I wish it was a longer season, but im glad that the episodes weren't all linked together to the point where you have to keep watching and watching.

Long story short:

- If you wanted a LOT of episodes for your money, you will be dissapointed.
- If you like episodes that are more up-beat, cute/silly, or back in the ""present"" time, this is a great set for you!

I love my prayer beads though... i've not seen any others for sale, so im wondering why I got some on my Season 4 set o_o; Maybe it was Viz's way of making up for the lack of episodes, lol!",1230249600,6,1493,4.221052631578948
2850983,2,B000QXDG84,"This Inuyasha box set contains four DVDs, and has all eighteen episodes that comprise the fourth season of the series.  The first two discs contain five episodes, the third disc contains four episodes, and the fourth disc includes four episodes and the special features.

The first special feature is labeled as ""Character Introductions.""  This is a roughly three-minute piece that introduces the characters of Kagome, Inuyasha, Kikyo, Sesshomaru, Myoga, Shippo, Miroku, Naraku, and Sango (although Sango is never mentioned by name).  By seeing the characters that are featured in this piece, as well as the footage used in it, I assume this was put together after the first season of the series.  It feels like this feature was included because they needed something to fill out the special features menu.  The thinking that probably went into this was that since this wasn't used for any of the previous box sets, to go ahead and throw it on here to say there are three special features instead of two.

The next feature is ""Textless Openings.""  These are textless versions of both of the openings that appear on this box set, and they are put back-to-back as one piece.  However, the textless version of the first opening already appeared on the box set for the third season, so it seemed rather pointless to include it here as well.

The last feature is ""Textless Endings.""  Just like the ""Textless Openings,"" this includes textless versions of both of the endings that appear on this set.  The textless version of the first ending already appeared on the box set for season three, so I question why it was included.

This particular season of Inuyasha didn't seem to progress the story much, if at all.  While some of the episodes were entertaining, they really weren't that important to the overall story.  This was rather disappointing, especially after all of the character development and story progression that took place during the third season.  In a lot of respects, the fourth season of Inuyasha feels more like a ""filler"" season than anything else.

If you're a fan of Inuyasha and want to have all of the episodes on DVD, then you need to acquire this set.  However, I'm not entirely convinced that this particular set is worth the retail price (as of this writing, the set is retailing for around $90, which is the same price as the first three sets).",1225152000,,2368,4.833746898263027

It gives our heroes some time to rest and provides time for some more InuYasha and Kagome moments.

There was no search for a higher technique (wind scar, backlash wave, barrier breaker).  The love triangle has really taken a backseat(Kikyo was barely in the season).  Totosei, Myoga, and Kikyo had reduced screen time, and the total lack of Naraku made things a little less exciting.  There were some bright spots such as the monkey sprite episode that was full of humor.

2851022,4,B000QXDG84,"In the Inuyasha Season Four DVD Box Set you will recieve 18 interesting and fairly good episodes of the series on four DVDs. Naraku has disappeared after being pushed to the brink of destruction. Now our heros must find the fiend and finish him once and for all. However, it's not as easy as it sounds.

Let me begin by saying that Season Four of this series is probably the weakest one in regards to quality and length, unless you count a Season Seven made from the last seven episodes of the series, in which case that would be the weakest, though I believe all those episodes are better than these 18. All other seasons of Inuyasha,(1-3,5,6) have 27 episodes.

Really, these 18 episodes are more so on the light side of entertainment as the majority of them are based off of comedic plots. By the end of the season they don't find Naraku, in fact he never even appears in the season, though he is mentioned MANY times. This lack of Naraku is a huge weakness to the season, as is its length and large number of seemingly pointless episodes that barely advance the plot if at all.

Despite this however, I must admit that every comedic episode is funny in its own way, from the Three Sprites of the Monkey God to Sota's Brave Confession of Love, and even Jaken Falls Ill, though that last one is more heartwarming than anything. Other funny episodes include Kirara Come Home! and Nursing Battle of the Rival Lovers. This season does have a few interesting and important episodes such as the introduction of Ayame, and of course the most important episode of the season plot wise, Kikyo's Lonely Journey. Information from this episode will play a huge role in Season Five, what I consider to be the best season of the series.

Extras are lacking as is usual for these box sets and to pay 80 dollars is ridiculous in my opinion. I found this for 35 at a nearby Wal Mart which I believe is a much more appropriate price. Still, while there are less episodes and most may seem pointless, they do have their charm. Overall, this set is a must own for any Inuyasha Collector.

As a matter of fact, one could skip this entire season, go on to season five and not really miss a beat. That being said, these episodes aren't particularly bad, they just seem to follow the same formula that many shonen anime tend to follow when their storylines catch up to their respective manga releases' (every antagonist or problem encountered is solved in a way which leaves the current state of the central characters completely unchanged). This should be enough to tide fans over until season five is released and The Band of Seven saga marks the evil Naraku's return to the fold.",1193356800,2,818,4.892086330935252

2851062,4,B000QXDG84,Well its the filler season of InuYasha! I'm a little upset that its only 18 episodes. I was expecting them to at least led up to the Band of 7 arc. I do like the skinnier box. ( I guess since there are only 4 discs instead of 5 like season 1-3) Also I got this at Wal Mart for only $40. A amazing deal when you compare it to the price everywere else. The batch of episodes in season 4 are good as far as fillers go and some are hilarious. I recomend this for any fan of the series.,1190851200,,481,3.772277227722772
2851063,4,B000QXDG84,"I love Inuyasha, but the previous three season box sets contained 27 episodes each and this one has only 18 episodes (for the same price). I was expecting the season to end just before the Band of Seven saga began, but it ends WAY before that. I don't know what they were thinking, but if they keep putting less episodes per season box set, it'll be ten years from now by the time they are all released! In the meantime, I just watch Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, which keeps airing all the episodes ever made.",1190332800,7,510,4.378947368421053
2851064,2,B000QXDG84,"I am not too pleased. This product is overpriced for the amount of episodes. Don't waste seventy dollars buying this - take your money to Wal-Mart where they have it for forty. The episodes are good, but the price is too high. I'll save some money and shop somewhere else.",1190073600,4,272,4.46
