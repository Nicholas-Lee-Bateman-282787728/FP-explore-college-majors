Having enjoyed Don Knotts as Deputy Fife in ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and as Mr. Furley in ""Three's Company"", I wished to see how he was in full-length feature films. ""The Reluctant Astronaut"" was a scream, and I highly recommend it to any body who enjoys good, old-fashioned, wholesome humor.

751743,5,6304005555,"Here is a family film to be watched over and over, and it's still funny after all these years.  Don Knotts runs a Kiddy-to-the-Moon ride at the local carnival.  He gets word that Cape Canaveral wants him to work for them, and everybody thinks he's going to be an astronaut.  He's the town hero and given much fanfare. But when he arrives, they only want to hire him as a janitor. He is afraid of heights anyway, so it's okay with him, until pals from home visit and he pretends he is in the astronaut program. Creating chaos to impress the folks from home, he is fired.  The Russians are about to send a monkey to the moon, and the US wants to hurry and send someone the least likely to be an astronaut up, to show how simple their space program operates.  Of course they pick Knotts. An excellent film that was made to entertain, and definitely does.",1398902400,,851,4.327044025157233

751747,3,6304005555,"Silly 1960's goofiness with Don Knotts sent up into space.  You can almost see the producers back in the 60's talking about this one:  ""Let's take Don Knotts, send him off into space, and, haha, make him afraid of heights!""  It works.  It's utterly mindless and made the kids laugh.  The story is fairly predictable: Knotts is a complete goofball who is volunteered to be part of an experiment sent into space (as part of an implausible US experiment to send someone completely incompetent into space to prove that... I dunno, they can send anyone into space, so there, Soviets!)  I was half expecting this to be a ""Spacecamp"" formula, and it did seem to be heading that way at times, like when Knotts dons a spacesuit to show off for his Dad and friends.  I was half expecting him to get hurried off to a ship and sent out.  Like I said, it's all mindless fun.
One observation about the music: not sure who composed it, but the repeating theme throughout the film sounds just like the ""muffin man"" song, and I had that jungle stuck in my head for a long time after watching this.",1394064000,,1080,4.446700507614213

751861,2,6304005555,"Excruciating to watch because it's sad not funny.  From the outset Don Knotts character (Roy) can only be viewed as hopeless as that's the way he's been written: afraid of heights, hitting on a pretty girl who obviously has no interest in him, coddled by his mother and held down by his father, 35 years old and his job is a spaceship that goes nowhere.  It only keeps getting worse after that introduction.  For reasons purely selfish, Roy's father applies for a job at NASA in Roy's name (in essence, enlists him to be an astronaut!).  After telling Roy this, his father (played with a maniacal glee by Arthur O'Connell) marches Roy off to his room so he can take a nap...and Roy goes!
Once Roy arrives at NASA and finds he's a janitor one has to wonder what kind of application Roy's dad filled out, how did he get a hold of it in the first place, and wouldn't someone in personnel notice the difference?  The story is filled to capacity with no end of aggravations meant to be funny (how many times can they milk his fear of heights?).  The whole time Roy was at NASA, miserable with his janitor job, I had to wonder why he took a job he didn't like and why did he stay, no one was keeping him chained there.  As written, Don Knotts character is basically just a big kid.  As written, his father is either insane or pathologically stupid.  As written, poor Jeanette Nolan (playing his mother) had nothing to do except periodically faint (the whole time she was probably saying to herself, why am I doing this?  I once worked with Orson Welles in Macbeth!).  As written, Leslie Nielsen's role could have been played by anyone known or unknown; he didn't leave an impression one way or another.  The only time this movie took off, literally, was when Don Knotts was alone in the space capsule.  Left to his own devices, Don can be quite amusing, but stuck in a lifeless story with little to do, not so much.

Not a keeper.",1300406400,4,1924,4.4289772727272725

This cute movie of ""The Reluctant Astronaut"" is among my favorites and I'd encourage you to get a copy and relive those fun years of the 1960's all over again in it's theme, fashions and overall, for the sweet story line of a son who always wanted to please his parents......no matter how SCARED he was in doing it! ;o)",1274745600,,539,4.546391752577319

Don Knotts goes on a drinking binge, there's more than one scene w/drinking and smoking, and most of the humor is based on the audience concuring that Knotts' character is unintelligent and unworthy of basic respect. Even w/out the child-viewing consideration factor it's more of a one-time rental than anything worth owning.",1249084800,3,411,4.885714285714286

information about the plot, stars and directors etc. in the Product Description and other reviews.

Viewed on high quality DVD player and 86cm Plasma screen.

Packaging plain and simple with no inserts. Menu system is simple, static and has no music or sound. Bonus materials are just the trailer and other recommendations, which are pics only. The trailer looks pretty good though. I can remember seeing this trailer on the big screen, when I was a kid, on a Saturday afternoon at the movies.

When the movie finishes, the menu goes to the Bonus Materials screen. Obviously to try and sell you more stuff.

Sound is brilliant with perfect synchronization.

DVD transfer is excellent. Film quality is absolutely superb.
The picture sharpness is one of the best I've seen on DVD.

A great Saturday afternoon matinee family movie.

Do yourself a favour. You won't be sorry.",1188345600,3,945,4.832298136645963
751906,5,6304005555,"The Reluctant Astronaut is one of the truly classic Don Knotts films, consistently hilarious while also sporting some touching scenes between a father and his son.  Roy Fleming (Knotts) is just about the last person you would want to shoot into space: I seriously doubt he could pass NASA's physical requirements, for one thing; he knows next to nothing about the requisite technology; and he is so terrified by heights that he can't even stand in a chair by himself.  Fleming is just a below-average regular guy simulating space flights for kids at a carnival, trying to win the heart of the hot dog girl, and still living with his parents at the age of 35.  His father has what you might call a dominating personality, and poor Roy proves unable to convince him that he does not want to be an astronaut.  His father submitted the application for him, though, and he has already spread the word all over town that his son has been accepted.  With great trepidation, Roy leaves for Houston (which is a funny bit all by itself), meets up with famous astronaut Fred Gifford (Leslie Nielsen), and is more than a little surprised to find out that he is actually going to be an assistant janitor.  He tries to tell his father the truth, but the old man is so proud of his astronaut son that Roy begins living a lie.  Of course, the truth will out in the end, and it looks like there will be no happy ending in sight.  Then, in the depths of failure, a light of opportunity suddenly shines on Roy, and he gets the chance to make things right- if he has the courage to do what is asked of him.

This was a role seemingly tailor-made for Don Knotts.  He's thoroughly convincing as the small-time loser pretending to be something he is not.  While the film itself is openly silly, Knotts plays the scattered serious moments in a wonderfully sympathetic way and transforms his character into a hero of sorts even before he sets foot in the space capsule.  It goes without saying that he is a comic genius, as well, so you can imagine just how funny his outer space scenes are.  I wish I could catalogue every funny moment in the film, but that would deny viewers the pleasure of experiencing them all for themselves.  Suffice it to say that The Reluctant Astronaut features one of history's funniest actors in one of his funniest movies - and it's good, wholesome entertainment, to boot.",1101513600,10,2377,4.5362997658079625
751907,5,6304005555,"The Reluctant Astronaut is as worthy of repeated viewings as The Ghost and Mr. Chicken. I watched both of these films thanks to a summer movie program offered in my town during my childhood. Both films were written by people who wrote the classic Andy Griffith Show episodes. Classic character actors from the Andy Griffith Show appear throughout both films as well. You should own these two finest of Don Knotts' movies.
  My favorite moment from The Reluctant Astronaut (as a child AND as an adult) is the absolutely surreal scene where Royal Fleming (Knotts) has a welcoming home party, and Pingo the dog jumps in the cake and starts eating it. Everyone at the party is shocked except the lady who owns the dog. She seems delighted. When I saw this scene again for the first time in 25 years, I laughed so hard I cried! This is great writing, a great cast, and CLASSIC Don Knotts!",1071619200,4,883,4.582278481012659
751908,4,6304005555,"One of the all-time classic Don Knotts films from his heyday in the mid-to-late 60s, ""The Reluctant Astronaut"" is reliable family fare on a Sunday afternoon.
Knotts plays Roy Fleming, a lovable loser who suffers from vertigo, but ironically runs a moonshot kiddie ride at the town park. When his ex-military and hyper-controlling father submits an application for his son to become a real astronaut, havoc ensues when Roy is accepted! But not is all as it seems when the newly-minted town hero finds that he is not actually an astronaut trainee, but a custodial trainee! Naturally, the kindly Roy is under pressure not to hurt his father and the whole hometown crowd by revealing the truth.
The plot and it's solutions are hardly a surprise to anyone by the time the picture ends. In fact, the only standardized element missing here concerns Roy Fleming's girlfriend. She starts out by ignoring the hapless Roy because he's a nobody, but when he becomes an astronaut, she's all attention. Pretty shallow, but so far so good. What's missing is the alternate/new girlfriend, who likes Roy for himself, not for his fame. That's usually the way romantic entanglements work out in this kind of picture, and it's kind of disappointing that Roy winds up with the ""fair weather"" gal.
But while the movie is fairly standard, the ""space fever"" and intense interest in the space program the characters display at every turn clearly reflects just how Americans felt about the program and its astronauts at the time (unlike today!). The movie will be a fun ride for those who recall those heady days as America's pride was in full force, and we good guys were battling Russia for control of space.
One think I liked here was the interesting and relatively rare NASA footage that pops up from time to time. The rocket sled sequence is especially notable for space program afficianados, as we get a good pilot's eye view of what it looked like to run down the sled track. We also get to see a few early rocket booster launches in real time, as opposed to the super-slow motion shots we're more familiar with.
If anyone threatens to steal the picture, it would have to be Arthur O'Connell as Roy's dad, Buck Fleming. Gruff, boisterous, and ultimately poignant, O'Connell gives the character just the right amount of stature and sympathy to compliment the awkwardness and desperation of Knott's Roy Fleming.
Jesse White (probably most famous for his role in ""Harvey""), plays Fleming's gruff boss, and ""Wagon Train"" alum Frank McGrath is on hand as one of Buck Fleming's pals. Jeanette Nolan plays a relatively small and understated role as Roy's mother.
Fans of Leslie Neilson will get a kick out of his presence in the picture as the good-natured pilot and astronaut, Major Fred Gifford. In a way, his inclusion in the cast seems like a friendly wink to his landmark space role in ""Forbidden Planet"".
I have to ding the DVD one star for the lack of extras. We get the trailer, and while fun (and containing original material shot for the promo), that's about it. Some production notes on the crew's NASA interactions while filming would have been a huge win, but it's missing here.
While the film is typical of light space program comedies from the time, ""The Reluctant Astronaut"" is probably the best of the bunch, and certainly better than most.",1063411200,10,3331,4.804878048780488
751909,5,6304005555,"This great movie played in theaters as a double bill with THE GHOST AND MR. CHICKEN in its second run. Naturally I went back to see it again. I will also watch the DVDs this way to re-creat the original effect.
Don Knotts only did two WIDESCREEN pictures for Universal, this is not one of them. However it will be 'matted' to give a wider screen look, the way it played in the theaters.  The full frame look it gets on TV shows the entire 35mm frame.",1060732800,6,450,4.172413793103448

751911,5,6304005555,"I read Mr. Maltin's brief review and was astonished that somebody who is in the business of reviewing films could so easily write this movie off.  This film is hilarious; it has an innocence that we don't see much anymore.  Don Knotts was a comedic genius, I'd without hesitation put him on a par with Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, The Three Stooges, Jim Carey.  He plays the nerdly goofball brilliantly, and we can all see a bit of ourselves in his various awkward moments. This movie skillfully mocks the Cold War tension with it's parody of the Space Race, and there's even a little romance as Don lusts for a beauty who barely acknowledges his existence until she hears that he's going to be an astronaut.  The soundtrack is great as well, very happy stuff and it reminds me of the old Sunday night Disney show's music.
My wife and I watched this on Septemeber 15, 2001, four days after September 11, 2001.  It was exactly the ticket for helping us to forget for a moment the ugliness of the real world.
I've never been very impressed by Mr. Maltin.  He gives terse conclusions which are unsubstantiated by specific references. I'm 41 years old and this movie entertained me like few others.  Don Knotts is an undervalued classic; my bet is that after he passes away there will be a big revival for his work.",1000771200,46,1317,4.555084745762712
751912,3,6304005555,"You gotta love Don Knotts. . . always the nervously dimwitted goof-up! There is something endearing about his naive harebrained ways. Knotts plays a humble small town carnival ride operator by the name of Roy Fleming. His father, Buck, who has bigger aspirations for his son, signs Roy up for the space program. Despite the fact that Roy is happy living his simple life, he heads off to Houston to follow his father's dream. As it turns out, Roy lands a job as a janitor. What a relief for him considering he is deathly afraid of heights! But fearing what his parents will think if they find out about his menial job, he manages to keep up the facade of being a big time astronaut. And when NASA decides to send a regular person to space to test out a new spacecraft, not only will Roy get to live up to his father's expectations, he will also get a chance to confront his own fear of heights. This is one goofball comedy that may be a little nonsensical to some, but for someone like Gulliver, whose all-time favorite sitcom is Three's Company (pre-Ralph Furley), I'm sure you'll find this no-brainer a riot to watch.",974419200,10,1118,4.485294117647059
