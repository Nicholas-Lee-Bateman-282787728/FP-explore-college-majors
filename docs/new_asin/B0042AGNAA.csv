8413326,5,B0042AGNAA,I purchased this DVD set to give me ideas to use to motivate my team members.  Get Coached has surpassed all my expectations.,1300233600,,125,4.434782608695652
8413327,1,B0042AGNAA,"I watched this and didn't get anything out of it, except annoyed that it wasn't produced better. The motivational message seems geared toward teens with very short attention spans. I suppose some adults could get something out of it, but I'm pretty sure everyone has heard all of this advice already by the time they are out of high school.

The total time of each segment is around 1 minute on average and there are about 21-23 segments per coach. Another 20-25 minutes or so is filler. The coaching advice is along the lines of: Work harder. Believe in yourself. Make a plan. Aim high. Stay focused. Risk = Reward.

Each of the 20+ segments has the same producer introduction that detracts from the message by being incredibly annoying. The video would be improved 100% if those introductions alone were all edited out, but then the total video would only be about 15 minutes long.

I thought the lighting and camera work were poor. Clips of coaches with sweaty faces and strange shadows over the faces make them look like zombies. Many quick cuts and a lot of jerky hand-held camera movements. I thought that went out of style 20 years ago. I guess not.

The music mix is too loud at times and occasionally you can't hear the words.

The NFL film is just snippets thrown in here and there of a player catching a ball, falling down, grimacing, etc. They are trying to make the NFL video as part of the reason to buy this, but you will feel cheated if you think you are going to see plays analyzed.

The sound editing is particularly annoying. Sometimes a single sentence is chopped up into 5 or 6 sound bites where each part (sometimes a single word) is obviously from a different take because the cadence of the voice is different.

It often...  sounds like... this...  when you... are listening... to the...  video.

It is really a shame that such a good idea for a motivational series was totally botched up in the process of making it.",1296864000,4,1941,4.5488505747126435
8413328,5,B0042AGNAA,"We use these at my company to inspire and train my team.  NOTHING compares to using Get Coached.  For the first time my team members and associates in my company are truly excited and enthralled to watch training videos at a meeting.  Even better, they've been taking the discs home and watching them during business travel to get ""pumped up"" before sales presentations and pitches.  We operate under a fast-paced high-pressure environment in my company, among peers in industries known for high rivalry and fierce competition.  ""Get Coached"" helps my team keep their killer-instinct.  This is NOT a product for sissies.  Get Coached is about how to WIN and BEAT THE CRAP out of your competition.  If you're a little girl, don't bother buying this.  If you compete among sharks, however, and you're thick-skinned and tough on the field of competition -- this box set will make you even tougher and more ambitious and confident.",1296604800,,927,4.929032258064516
8413329,1,B0042AGNAA,"Get coached is a rehash of all the PMA dribble in bad format!  I like the PMA material, but not in the way it was presented here.  They try to breakup each subject into its own sound bit and it doesn't flow.  Plus these guys are yelling at you and I prefer to have someone talking to me.

If you want good PMA forget this presentation and go back to Tony and Zig!!",1293753600,5,364,3.9452054794520546
8413330,5,B0042AGNAA,"Just got this boxset two days ago and have watched all 5.  Pretty powerful stuff and each coach is totally different.  They all include a ton of great NFL Footage to pound home the messages and the coaches are in full on NFL sideline gear that they wear in game.  Each segment from each coach is anywhere from :30 seconds to 3 minutes so I was never bored.  The kind of ""call to actions"" and ""get psyched"" messages that I'm guessing I will use whenever I need to get ready to rock.  I'm a Pop Warner coach so I'll also show to my kids.  It's weird nobody has ever thought of this before.",1289952000,7,587,4.150442477876106
8413331,5,B0042AGNAA,"This is one of the best motivational tools I have ever come across.  The applicability of the messages are incredible, and the inclusion of some of the greatest football minds in the World enables the messages to be driven home with great effectiveness.  This is a fantastic product that will make a great gift for the Holidays.  A must see for anyone looking for motivation, both football fans and non-football fans alike.  I only hope there are more DVDs of this type planned for the future!",1289260800,5,493,4.6976744186046515
8413332,5,B0042AGNAA,"This is the perfect gift for the holiday season!!  It's always so difficult for me to find something for my brother who of course loves ALL sports!!  He is a faithful every weekend for whatever sport is on TV.  I foundthis DVD collection and am so excited because any sports fan would love it, but so would any man/woman looking for inspiration and movtivation.  It's great to hear straight from these winning coaches their secrets to success and winning!",1289260800,4,455,4.7215189873417724
