7879942,5,6304952589,"In 1975, Eduard ""Billy"" Meier, a humble Swiss Farmer, began a series of personal contacts with extraterrestrail beings from a cluster of stars known as the Pleaiades.
This is a great Alien Species Documentary, especially since Ancient Aliens hasn't covered this contact thoroughly yet only seam to talk about The Greys & Reptillians.

Contains 2 features : The Pleaiadian Connection & The Meier Contacts(must watch after you seen the first discs before you cast your judgement)",1513641600,,477,5.276315789473684

7879946,1,6304952589,"""The Meier Contacts"" is a poor-quality PowerPoint presentation with an absurdly high volume level.  Michael Horn reads a script with a low-quality microphone with lots of popping.  It sounds like it was recorded in his bedroom.  Plus, the presentation has the artistic value of an eighth-grader's book report.  Buy it at a yard sale for 25 cents if you're interested, but don't spend any more than that.",1303603200,,403,4.970149253731344
7879947,3,6304952589,"This story is very strange, interesting but strange? Cannot decide whether to believe it or not! if not  true it still remains very entertaining. I gave it 3 stars due to the fact the commentator is so monotone and can make you fall asleep. Shipping was a bit slow.",1260921600,,265,4.408163265306122
7879948,4,6304952589,"My opinion of these films is very different from that of the former review.  It is true that the two movies included in this package are extremely low-budget productions, but if one understands the context of the story, he or she will understand why such low-budget films are necessary, and maybe, that person can look past this.  Those who have sufficiently investigated the Meier case in the past and who sought to have the case brought to the public's attention were usually individuals who later received much criticism and rejection from the public at large for even giving any attention to the case at all.  If they tried to make any profit from this, they certainly couldn't have succeeded in making much at all since the overall majority of the populace still remains in the dark about this case or passes by it without giving it much consideration at all.

No major filming companies that would have sufficient resources to produce a high-budget film would ever do so with this particular case.  Randolph Winters and Michael Horn, the two who made the videos in this package, would have had to have done so through their own means and resources, without the assistance of those who could fork out very large sums of money to make the videos much like the mainstream movies of today.  Even though Michael Horn may have received more funds since then to be able to produce a much higher budget film, he likely did not have those funds at the time of these films' productions.

That being said, I would encourage inquirers into this contact case to look past this and, instead, look at the films from the perspective of what you desire to get out of them.  The product description given above does a great job of successfully summarizing the main contents of these DVDs.  Do you desire to know about some of the scientific evidences that the Meier Case produced?  You will be well-informed about this through these DVDs.  Do you desire to hear what some of the alleged ETs have actually said to Billy Meier?  You will find much of that here. Do you want to ponder about prophecies that were given to Meier many years before the events fulfilled themselves and about how Meier could have known this information?  These discs will provide you with plenty of opportunities to do just that.

I just want to leave the reader with the fact that buyers should expect to receive what they are looking for.  If one wants to enjoy a high-budget film, that one shouldn't look here.  But if he or she desires to learn more about an ET-contact case which hasn't received much attention in the past, apart from that of some dedicated individuals, then don't pass these productions up.  The price for these DVDs as of 6/23/09 is very reasonable if one desires to receive the information about Meier as has been explained above.",1245715200,13,2818,4.683569979716024
7879949,1,6304952589,"DON'T BUY IT!!!

I bought this dvd because I thought this might be the dvd version to ""Contact"", that in Mexico was released in vhs in the 90's with the spanish title ""Contacto desde las Pleyades"", a interesting documentary made in the 80's about Billy Meier and his experiences (maybe true, maybe false) with extraterrestrials. However I've been fooled by the package of this dvd: the're two discs of practically nothing! Such a waste and what an ugly and poor presentation! In disc one a suit clothed guy appears talking to camera 95% of the time, the rest are a few still photos (many of them old images of galaxies and planets) and a pair of artist's conception of the events. What a waste!! But wait, the worse is in store! Unbelievable: the disc 2 is a simply and mediocre powerpoint presentation barely added with a slide show of images of people, rivers, citys, lakes, animals, stars! Can you believe? A SLIDE SHOW OF STILL IMAGES IN THE DVD ERA! A pps slide show almost without images, only plain text (and a voice reading it word by word). The only footage of ufo's in flight hardly last less than  20 seconds in a cellphone-screen-like quality. What a mistake I had! I want my money back! Please do yourself a favor and don't waste your money in garbage like this! Instead look for the vhs ""Contacto desde las Pleyades"" (as far as I know it was not avaible in an US version) or watch this movie at YouTube, searching under the theme ""Billy Meier"".
Oh my God, $26.99 (plus shipping charge) direct to the trash!!! Don't worths not even the 1% of its price. Disappointing from start to end. I proclaim this one as the worst dvd and videodocumentary made ever!",1203552000,26,1667,4.553333333333334

This video isn't worth the money. It looks like a cheap documentary and the flying saucers look terribly fake!!!!!
Buyers beware! Save your  money!
I was highly dissapointed. I bought it and got upset when I saw the video. It was so cheaply done.  I'm glad I was able to get rid of it by selling it on E-bay.",967507200,,311,4.166666666666667
