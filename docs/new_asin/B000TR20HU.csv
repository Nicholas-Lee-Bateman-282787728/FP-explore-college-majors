8210400,5,B000TR20HU,"I saw ""Porquoi Pas"" maybe thirty years ago and loved it.  It's one of two movies I constantly search for and can't find anywhere.

A menage a trois goes critical when one partner tries to go straight. Wackiness ensues.

It's no use, you'd have to see it.  Except, whoops, you can't, because IT'S NOT OUT ON DVD!

Please please o powers that be, please make this movie available again!",1307577600,8,384,4.507246376811594
