8223207,5,B000WGIFAE,"There's always something to love when Bob starts a painting.  Whether it's the unconventional 'method' painting he uses, the specialized brushes for effects, or his soothing, gentle manner, he inspires confidence that anyone can paint if they truly have the desire so to do and are willing to take the time to practice.  Of course, just picking up the supplies and the CD doesn't automatically make us Michelangelo, but the method is so effective that our work will be something of which we can be proud and inspired to create more.  And the more we create, the better our paintings become.  Painting is used as therapy in many disciplines, and is a restful hobby for those who enjoy it.  And the best part is that if we do NOT enjoy it, we haven't spent $$$$ on lessons with someone with whom we may not have a nurturing bond.  Bob IS the consummate nurturer and encourager.  Even if one never picks up a paintbrush, watching his videos lower the blood pressure by 20 points, his manner is so relaxing and watching his work, so enjoyable.",1424736000,,1039,4.614130434782608
