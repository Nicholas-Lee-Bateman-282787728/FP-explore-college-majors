1904094,5,B0000A5A1L,"I have just finished watching this brilliant adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky's 'Crime & Punishment'. The three episodes last seventy-five minutes each, a total of just under four hours. In my opinion, the first episode is  the best, but I enjoyed the entire DVD immensely. I do not know how faithful it is to the book as I have never read it, but I certainly shall now.

The wonderful Jack Pulman adapted this for BBC TV in 1979, shortly before his death. Again he manages to produce an impeccable script, full of both drama and humour. Interestingly, as with so many of his works, his wife Barbara Young makes an appearance as the eccentric Amalia Ivanovna - or at least that is what she calls herself.

The cast is outstanding and features many well known and hugely talented players. The amazing John Hurt is simply riveting as the tortured Raskolnikov. Sian Phillips and Frank Middlemass are both very moving and Timothy West is masterfully subtle and understated. Other standouts include David Troughton and Beatrix Lehmann as the Pawnbroker. In fact, the only member of the cast who was not particularly good was Yolande Palfrey as Sonia, but even she was acceptable.

The sets and locations are very authentic and there are some unforgettable scenes. The story is dark and bleak, but enthralling, thought-provoking and simply fascinating.

All in all an excellent production - one to keep beside 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' (BBC TV 1979), 'Anna Karenina' (BBC TV 1977) and 'The Mayor of Casterbridge' (BBC TV 1978).

But why on earth is there a picture of Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul in 'Pride and Prejudice' (BBC TV 1979) on the back cover? I am surprised that no previous reviewer has commented on this.",1107475200,26,1722,4.88013698630137
1904095,2,B0000A5A1L,"I just finished re-reading the book; it is a masterpiece. I wish I could say the same for the BBC series. For one, the musical score is either absent or irritating. So much of what is compeling in the book goes on inside of the Characters. How about voice-overs or something else (music?)? Let the audience in on the torment and conflict of Raskolnikov (the main character) and interplay of the characters that is so powerful in the book. What I saw was an acceptable theatrical production on film. I've written much more but it's unfortunately been truncated. Simply read the book instead or view this and know that this pales before the book. This is a dreary protrayal.",1101513600,8,672,4.65546218487395
1904096,4,B0000A5A1L,"How very disappointing!
My boyfriend and I were VERY excited to get this DVD. We both read the book - he did a long time before I did - and we were looking forward to see the mini-serie.
It was great to see the characters, and see the similarities or differences they had with those that our own imagination had made up. For example, yes John Hurt was a little too old or looked too old to play Raskolnikov, and I had imagined him to be a little more charismatic than that (sorry for the John Hurt fans)... He was a good actor though. He delivered a great performance, and he does look conflicted like I figured Raskolnikov would have been. I didn't especially like the actress that played Sonya, and at times it seemed that she was just plain ""bad"", especially in one scene where Raskolnikov went to see her at her place, but her voice was as soft as I imagined Sonya's to be. Porfiry was close to how I imagined him though! And Razhumikin(darn Russian names, I'm not sure about the spelling and I don't have the book with me) was close too.
The ONLY AND ULTIMATE thing that spoiled the experience was the ENDING. How dare they! I'm sure Dostoevsky would have turned in his grave if he saw that. It just ruins the whole story. One of the best parts in the book was the ending, when he went down the stairs at the station, and out, and saw Sonya, smiled and went back. It's NOT in the DVD! NOT! And Sonya does not go in with him at the station in the book. And he does not go to see Porphyre(Porfiry in English), but Ilia Petrovitch. It makes a big difference to me anyway.  There's also the part where  Svidrigailov kills himself... that lasted all but 5 seconds! It was also one of the most ""poignant"" parts of the book. ""Tell them I'm going to America""... Would it have been that hard to include it? Also where was the gun when Dunya went to see Svidrigailov... Those part are a bit disappointing (the ending is EXTREMELY disappointing), but overall it was still a good adaptation of the book. There's so much philosophy going on in the book which you can't easily include in a movie, but I think they did a good job. Just the ending would justify giving that movie ONE star, but I'll be honest, I loved watching it up to the end.",1093564800,15,2233,4.30166270783848
1904097,5,B0000A5A1L,"Read the book -- but this _is_ a superb miniseries.  John Hurt is a little older than is ideal for the role of the student Raskolnikov, but otherwise is a fantastic choice for the part.  The story is absorbing and thought-provoking, and, at least in the marvelous scene in which Raskolnikov taunts a police inspector --- funny!
Crime and Punishment was preceded by an adaptation of Dostoevsky's The Possessed.  I hope that will become available.",1076457600,23,445,4.906666666666666
1904108,4,B0000A5A1L,This BBC production of Crime and Punishment (featuring John Hurt) is simply extraordinary. Presented the details with all the gripping tensions of the original text. Any fan of Dostoyevsky will love it.,1343088000,2,202,5.34375
1904109,5,B0000A5A1L,"Felt obliged to balance the low rating given by one reviewer who registered disappointment thinking this was another version.

Hurt's Raskolnikov is a fascinating read of character, in my opinion. And the period and place are rendered convincingly by the whole cast.

I'm hoping all the episodes will soon become available on Amazon, since this is a wonderful introduction to Dostoevsky on screen. There are of course so many points of view from which any such attempt to  so render literature can be criticized, and I won't begin to make my own attempt since it has been many years since reading the novel.

But there's nothing to be lost in taking a look at these episodes, at least as a reference point of comparison. And here everything is in English without the trouble of subtitles. I'm looking forward to some of the other productions of this masterpiece in Russian and English, and may come back to edit here. But one star is simply not a fair rating at all on the merits. I'm hoping some other reviewers jump in to balance things out.",1319587200,,1043,4.683060109289618
1904110,5,B0000A5A1L,"I recalled watching the final episode of this compelling screenplay when it first aired on PBS some thirty years ago and was disappointed to see that it hasn't been released as a DVD while VHS versions are commanding collector's prices. So I'm glad to have the option to rent the series from Amazon at a very reasonable price. The quality is excellent as is the ease of watching because it bookmarks wherever I pause and resumes on cue even after shutting down for extended periods. As for the performance, well there are few available to which to compare it so I would be grateful if someone knows and reports on a superior version of this literary classic. John Hurt as Raskolnikov is convincing but Timothy West's portrayal of Porfiry Petrovitch is the undisputable highlight and worth the price of admission. Since all of their dialogue takes place in the final episode one may begin there before deciding whether to rent the others.
I bought a Russian version available on DVD thanks to some favorable reviews that promised it was the ultimate but while the atmosphere of the black and white is effective as is the Russian soundtrack with subtitles, its treatment of the interplay between the principle characters leaves much to be desired compared to the BBC/PBS version.",1310342400,2,1277,4.862385321100917
1904111,5,B0000A5A1L,"Here we have a very excellent mini-series, all-inclusive, three episodes on one DVD (225 minutes total running time), of Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"". This movie is simply terrific and, by having twice read the book (two different translations), I can say that this film is totally true to its origin, with just a few of the less notable scenes omitted which is what one would reasonably expect.

Now, the reason for my cautionary title is that ""Crime and Punishment"" is a story about the extreme misery of the Russian people, and to put this theme into historical perspective, it transpires during the era in which the U.S. Civil War was just reaching a conclusion. To summarize the Russian social environment of that same period, serfdom had just been reluctantly abolished (1863) but it actually continued on in pocket regions for a time. And times for the masses were incredibly difficult in the larger Russian cities such as St. Petersburg which is where this story mostly transpires. Large portions of the population were starving, alcoholism was rampant, and revolution was in the air, (this finally came to a head in 1905 and, successfully for the Bolsheviks [Communists] in 1917 but those two events are not directly a facet of this particular story.)

So what I'm telling you is that this tale is mostly one of extreme misery and is largely responsible for the egregious myth that ALL Russian literature is equally gloomy, (a myth which can be immediately dispelled by reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Inspector-General/dp/1595477918/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Inspector-General</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Souls-A-Novel/dp/0679776443/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Souls: A Novel</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oblomov/dp/1583228403/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oblomov</a>, etc.) But ""Crime and Punishment"" is pretty depressing which is actually why it's such a great life story. So if you cannot endure such films, you'd best skip this one because in addition to all the gloom, this mini-series is quite lengthy so there's a lot of it!

THE STORY: Briefly, Raskolnikov is a rather contumacious, off-and-on Russian student who faces multiple problems: his personal ethics are grossly distorted; he has no money, and; he is emotionally and physically ill.

Almost at once, while raising a few kopecks by way of pawning some personal trinkets, he has an encounter with a spiteful and venomous old woman, the local pawnbroker who continually takes an abhorrently unfair advantage of everyone with whom she does business. This dreadful old hag also has a half-sister living with her, a girl of very limited intelligence whom she psychologically abuses.

It's no spoiler to say that, based upon his personal philosophies about the value of various people's lives, Raskolnikov murders the old woman with a hatchet to the forehead. But unfortunately the half-sister makes an unexpected appearance during the murder and he makes the hasty decision to kill her as well, an actuality which begins to haunt him from the moment he commits the act.

The entire remainder of the story is based upon this horrific act of violence, albeit there are some sub-plots, all of which heap even more burdensome stresses upon Raskolnikov. One of these side trips involves an older man by the name of Marmeladov. This venerable fellow would be a fine man were it not for his extreme and endless drunkenness which has resulted in the ruination of his entire family. In fact, his alcoholism has driven his own daughter to become a prostitute, a blameless girl with whom Raskolnikov falls in love.

Finally, the highlight of the story involves the local police inspector, a man by the name of Porfiry, who epitomizes the ""Columbo"" of the Russian police! His mild and indirect (but irritating) manner of interrogation drives Raskolnikov to extreme emotional reactions and Porfiry's character adds as much to the film as it does to Raskolnikov's mental burden. It's just short of comic relief.

I will have to stop at this point to avoid any major spoilers but, rest assured, this is a complex tale which is well-told via this marvelous mini-series. John Hurt plays Raskonikov and he's perfect in this role. The film is in color, the scenes and sets are nothing short of excellent, and the aspect ratio is full-frame. This last feature is the only item I'm curious about -- the packaging states ""full-screen version"" which conveys to me that there might actually exist a widescreen version, which I would very much love to view! The mini-series was directed by Michael Darlow and, of course, this is a BBC Production so all the actors are British and thus one should not expect to hear Russian accents.

Highly recommended for appropriate audiences.

1904112,5,B0000A5A1L,"Fyodor Dostoevsky wrote a masterpiece when he published Crime and Punishment. The book demonstrates an incredible understanding of human nature.

Crime and Punishment surfaces the mental anguish and moral dilema of a highly intelligent man by the name of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov. He is poor, a former student living in St. Petersburg, who, in search for a change of luck, develops a plan to kill a usurous pawnbroker who is hated by the whole town.

He expects to change his luck by obtaining the great fortune she has been accumulating under her bed from the pain and troubles of those who had no choice but to pawn their possessions.

The book details conflicting human emotions of pride, hatred, envy, shame, guilt and redemption. The plot is set in 19th-century Russia and the characters for the most part are from the working class.

We took the opportunity to see the series with young adults and we were delighted to see how they learned from understanding the consequences of actions that can and will change the lives of those who execute something as horrible as murder.",1196121600,6,1086,4.885869565217392

1904115,5,B0000A5A1L,"Dr. Phil: My first guest tonight is a man who has some impulse-control problems.

Raskolnikov: What do you want? When will you leave off tormenting me?

Dr. Phil: Hold it right there. Seems to me you need an attitude adjustment.

(Raskolnikov turns abruptly and stares at the wall.)

Dr. Phil: Says here you murdered an old lady for her money. You murdered her, and then you murdered her sister. What were you thinking?

Raskolnikov: (Making a violent effort to understand what it all means) I murdered myself, not them! It was the Devil that killed them. Enough, enough! I killed a noxious insect of no use to anyone, so what is the object of these senseless sufferings?

Dr. Phil: You need to get a grip on yourself, and you need to take some responsibility and make healthier choices.

(Applause from studio audience.)

Raskolnikov: (Breathing heavily, his upper lip twitching.) My choice was to be a great man dedicated to improving the lot of humanity. The vast mass of mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some mysterious process to bring into the world at last one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence.

Dr. Phil: Let's talk about the independence thing, since you brought it up. You're still receiving money from your mother, isn't that right? And you have a college degree but no job? And recently you've embarked on a life of crime?

Raskolnikov: The extraordinary man has the right to find in his own conscience a sanction for murder, if it is essential to the practical fulfillment of his idea. Our rulers destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue. They are knaves and scoundrels.

Dr. Phil: Ho ho, well I'm not an expert on politics, but don't you think you have enough problems of your own to keep us busy here? I understand you're in love with a prostitute?

Raskolnikov: Sonia is a woman of the utmost purity whom I love with a Christ-like intensity that drives me to torment and humiliate her.

Dr. Phil: Be honest with me now. Don't you think she'd prefer a relationship in which two healthy people come together because they complement each other on an equal footing of respect and love?

(Applause from studio audience.)

Raskolnikov: (Grinds his teeth.) A dull animal rage boils within me.

Dr. Phil: We need to extinguish these self-defeating behavior patterns of yours.

Raskolnikov: Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart.

Dr. Phil: I one-hundred percent disagree. You can do better than that. Now I understand Sonia can't be here tonight because she's ministering to the needs of plague victims, but once you get out of prison for those murders, supposing this Sonia's still waiting for you, what do you think

you'll have to do to repair the damage you've already done to the relationship?

Raskolnikov: My mind is clouded and I am almost unconscious of my body.

Dr. Phil: I'm sending you to the green room to do some figuring.

Raskolnikov: Why must you persecute me with kindness, when I would rather boil over with a rapturous agony. (Laughs insanely.) Perhaps I am really mad, and all this happens only in my imagination.

Dr. Phil: Nope, you ain't getting you off the hook that easy. Fact is, you are accountable for your actions. What I'm asking you to do is take responsibility. Are you willing to give that a try?

Raskolnikov: (Bows down to kiss the earth.) Good God, man is a vile creature.

Dr. Phil: Do we have a deal or not?

Raskolnikov: I could strangle you at this moment. Why must you torture me? I feel a physical hatred for you, cannot bear you near me, and am becoming convinced that you are the most aggravating bully on the face of the Earth.

Dr. Phil: You see, now we're getting somewhere. Pain, once it's acknowledged, can be a powerful motivator.

Raskolnikov: Be silent, I beg of you. (Shuddering nervously, a malignant expression in his black eyes.) I am a louse, a wretch, a fool.

Dr. Phil: It's time for you to identify and confront the behaviors that are making you unhappy. I always tell people, you don't need a diploma to hose down a mule.

(Standing ovation from studio audience.)

Raskolnikov: I feel sublimely indifferent to your opinion. (Walks toward the exit.) No, I retract everything I have said, your words make perfect sense, you are a seer, a god. (Bounding out of the studio, his voice carrying from afar.) If only I had met you before I became an axe

murderer, perhaps I would now be among the saints.

Dr. Phil: Oh boy.

(Raskolnikov returns after a tumultuous inner struggle, pushing his way through a dense crowd of peasants.)

Dr. Phil: We're going to take a break now.

Middlemass was the definitive snob in that picture. I've only seen the first third of C&P so far but find the show well-done and worthy of the novel.

Seeing this again 30 years later, this production still impresses me; I also see things today that I wasn't able to appreciate as a younger person.  I thought the judicious use of the background music in this production was particularly excellent, intensifying the atmosphere of tension and inner anguish.

(Note: this is a different production from ""Crime and Punishment"" with John Hurt and Vanessa Redgrave -- that was a later film and I haven't seen that one to comment on it.  This one I'm reviewing now is the TV series made right around the time ""I, Claudius"" came out, in the late 1970's - early 1980's when really top-notch TV programs were coming from UK to PBS in the U.S.)

John Hurt is magnificient in this production and his acting is truly riveting.  The cast is stellar, with Sian Phillips, Timothy West and Frank Middlemass.  In particular, the cat-and-mouse ""interrogation"" scene between the magistrate (played by West) and Raskolnikov (Hurt) is really quite unforgettable -- probably because the script adaptation was excellent.

 There is no doubt that ""Crime and Punishment"" would have been one of the greatest novels of the century had not Dostoevsky leaned towards the more acceptable sense of morality related to the weak tenets of Chrisitanity. In doing so, he made Rasknolikov a caricature of himself, lethargic and yet redeemable by accepting Christ's pathetic suffering. It was more appropriate to adapt Nietzsche's figure of ""the noble superman"" but Dostoevsky, at the time of his writing, was a destroyed soul, drinking and plagued by debts, a gambling and morphine addiction and on top of that, he was a converted Christian, which is to say he resembled a ""spineless worm"".

There is a powerful beginning in which the bold character Rasknolikov conceptualizes the murder of an old aged hag who serves no purpose to society but beyond that, Dostoevsky tortures us with the conscience of an obstinate man who is shattered by an insignificant crime. In all effect, Dostoevsky became an apologist not only for bourgeois values and the Czar with his corrupt regime, but for Orthodox Christianity, which not only supported the exploitation of the Russian population but welcomed it. The end of the novel, which portrays a once proud, noble, and intellectually superior young man weeping before a prostitute and the image of the bible, brings about the demise of Dostoevsky's credibility.",1391472000,,1405,5.1
