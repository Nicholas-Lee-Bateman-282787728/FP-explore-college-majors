It is very simple and has no real animation to speak of; the video consists of illustrations, music, and narration, with perhaps a tiny bit of narration.  My kids loved the video and eventually outgrew it (I thought.)

Just recently my 15 year old daughter was having fits because she wanted to watch this again and discovered that I had - gasp - given it away years ago. So, I had to hunt it down and amazingly found it here on Amazon.com.  Yes, I purchased this video AGAIN for more than I originally paid for it...for my 15 almost 16 year old.  She was THRILLED and DELIGHTED when it arrived.

Whatever...it is a classic. Hope the VHS lasts long enough for her to show it to HER children one day... :)",1334793600,,803,4.291390728476821
