7951992,2,B00005R28E,"I have seen alot of hebrew barney productions but this one was by far the worst
Not only did they reproduce the worst episode from the america version of barney but the sound quality gave me a headache everything seemed so high pitched in this one",1411948800,,247,4.391304347826087
7951993,5,B00005R28E,"the reason of i bought this was so i could learn the hebrew language and the only way i could learn the hebrew language was by re-watching my kids shows in a different languages and i'm 22 yrs. old fixing to turn 23 on April 24 this year. and just so you know, about what Y. sHAPHIR ""acu4stars""said and the songs not about grabbing a gun, it's telling them they don't have a gun, the bear tells them to run considering they didn't have a gun. not about grabbing your gun if you watched the English version from the backyard gang campfire singalong or the English version of this aleph bet, which the title of the English is alphabet soup and the lyrics from the campfire singalong goes like this: the other day i met a bear, a great big bear from way up there, he said to me, why don't you run, i see you ""ain't"" got any gun and so i ran away from there but right behind he was that bear and so i ran away from there but right behind me there was that bear that's all there is ,there ain't no more unless meet that bear once more and in the barney and friends version the ""ain'ts"" are turned to don'ts. and that's what that first song was about.",1390867200,,1145,4.116071428571429
