3702270,3,B001MVYUP2,"This show is definitely a case of ""right show, wrong network"".  I was able to catch 2 episodes while it ran but then stopped seeing it in the listings so I assumed that it'd been a mid-season test show and would return in the fall but was sad to hear that it'd been canceled.

Julianna Margulies was great in the lead role and her delivery of the pulled together ""with it"" attorney by day vs a woman who is falling into an alcoholic stupor by night connected with me as a viewer.  I could feel her pain as a mother who had looked away for a moment as her child is kidnapped, I could feel her hope that the child is alive & would return to her one day and wanted to see more of her story - would she completely fall apart or keep it half together or eventually move on?

I liked the ensemble cast and was especially happy to see Keith Robinson (since I developed a crush on him after seeing DREAMGIRLS).I wish this show had been picked up by the TNT network since they seem to have a commitment to tv shows with strong female leading characters and I think that they certainly would've given the show more than 6 episodes to succeed which leads me to my final comment about this dvd ""set"" - it is too expensive for just 6 episodes of a now canceled show. Initially I thought that viewers would be getting at least 13 epis but I can't recommend the purchase but would highly recommend renting it because it had the makings of a good series but just didn't get enough of a chance to cultivate an audience.",1242950400,16,1502,4.2229965156794425
3702271,3,B001MVYUP2,"A legal drama with an edge, ""CANTERBURY'S LAW"" was a series that had so much potential but was cut too short with only six episodes in the DVD complete collection.

The drama which aired during the Spring of 2008 featured Emmy Award Winner  Julianna Margulies (""ER"") as the feisty defense attorney Elizabeth Canterbury.  A woman who seeks justice for the people she defends even if it means breaking the law.

Running the law firm Canterbury & Associates, she is joined by her partner Russel Krauss (Ben Shenkman) and her two attorneys Chester Grant (Keith Robinson) and Molly McConnell (Trieste Kelly Dunn).  They take on cases which seem impossible and a grand slam for the District Attorney but Elizabeth Canterbury has always outbest the Deputy Attorney General Zach Willliams (Terry Kinney).

But Elizabeth's personal life is anything but good.  Her marriage to her husband Matt, a law professor has gone down the drain since their son was kidnapped.  Three years ago, she took her toddler Sam to the playground and answered her phone for business and next thing you know, she lost sight of him and they don't know if he is dead or alive.

Despite being successful as a defense lawyer, her life has been spiraling down hill.  She has become a drunk after hours, she has been having an affair with Frank Angstrom (James McCaffrey) and because her husband has held his pain of feeling that she is responsible for their son's kidnapping, he wants to move on with their lives and declare him dead.  But Elizabeth believes her son to be alive.  And thus, her marriage life is in shambles.

To make things worse, because she has broken the law in order to win a case, now she is being investigated by the District Attorney and Grand Jury for jury tampering.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""CANTERBURY'S LAW"" is featured in 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  The video quality is similar to a lot of dramas that are on DVD which has a bit of grain.

As for the audio, the audio is English 5.1 (Dolby Digital) and the series is primarily a dialogue-driven drama series with the occasional rock music that is played during certain scenes.  But the dialogue is clear and I had no problems hearing the audio.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features on this DVD unless you count ""previews"" as one of them.  Previews are for ""Damages"", ""The Lazarus Project"", ""Rescue Me"" and ""The Shield"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

""CANTERBURY'S LAW"" is a legal drama that had a lot of potential and Julianna Margulies did a really good job as Elizabeth Canterbury, a defense lawyer who is strong, feisty and a woman that no one wants to mess with but to show that behind that tough demeanor, her personal life is just in shambles.

With this series coming from Denis Leary and Jim Serpico who are responsible for ""Rescue Me"", I expected the potential for something explosive for the first season.  But it's really unfortunate that FOX canceled the series with only six episodes.

I definitely gave this series a try and I really felt that ""CANTERBURY'S LAW"" had so much potential and what urked me so much is that by watching these six episodes, there was an ongoing storyline about Elizabeth hoping that her kidnapped son is still alive. And to know that with no conclusion, we're left with an open ended series with no closure.

It's very unfortunate that the creator/director Dave Erickson was never given the opportunity to finalize the series.  Even if there was one last episode to tie up loose ends, at least it would have been some sort of closure to the series and its characters.  It's a shame to watch these characters taken to such highs but then taken to the lowest of low's and that glimmer of sunshine will never come.

I actually enjoyed Julianna Margulies performance and it was great to see her play this type of role.  After watching each of the six episodes, I really got into the main characters (the partner and attorneys at Canterbury's law firm) and seeing this battle of wits between Canterbury and the Deputy Attorney General.

I enjoyed ""CANTERBURY'S LAW"" but with only six episodes, the series definitely had potential. Unfortunately, the network canceled it too quickly and thus, the series never had any true closure to the series storyline or its characters.  And as entertaining the episodes were, you are left with wanting more but knowing that there is no more.  What a shame!",1235001600,60,4369,4.76595744680851

3702292,2,B001MVYUP2,"I purchased this DVD series. It arrived promptly to New Zealand and the packaging was perfect. I did not enjoy the DVD  series. It was disappointing because the characters were not likable. As attorneys/lawyers they had no joy or fun in their lives or moments of happiness. All the lawyers mostly seemed miserable in their personal lives and in doing their work and everything was hard going for them. Their lives were a grind it was hard to see the motivation and passion for why they would live their lives as like that. In the professional lives their were serious ethical lapses of judgment problems and the people were not nice people that one would want to know if they were real people. Lots of striving for wining cases at cost of legal ethics, morals and happiness and the people mostly all seemed judgmental.  The setting for the office, the city and their home lives was dreary. No one would want their lives or to live and work at that firm. A second season would not be worth watching if there was one.",1456790400,,1015,4.540983606557377

3702296,3,B001MVYUP2,"You can see shades of Alicia in the last episode of this also ran courtroom drama that
ended when it should have.  I'm probably biased though as I think that The Good Wife is
one of the best shows that TV has had to offer in a long time, and I think that JM is almost
typecast for her role in that show.

She's too cocky in Canterbury's law, and the whole Porsche thing is too much for what Alicia would
be.  Alicia is also a better attorney and a better person, so we're talking about a radical tangent in
writing, as well.  I'm not unhappy that I bought CL, but it pretty much played out the way I expected.
I'd loan these discs to a friend and not worry about when I got them back.

3702303,5,B001MVYUP2,"Thanks, Amazon, for putting this DVD set on my ""recommended for you"" list-- although I've been a fan of J. Margulies since her ""ER"" days,"" I somehow missed the 6-episode lifespan of ""Canterbury's Law."" Margulies' portrayal of ""dark and twisty"" Elizabeth Canterbury is a fascinating foreshadowing of some elements of her Alicia Florrick character. Both are powerful professional women who fight for justice (and for their clients), even if the fight sometimes requires bending rules (something Alicia has become more comfortable with over time). Alicia isn't as troubled in as many ways as Elizabeth, so I enjoyed watching Margulies' all-out, drunk-and-depressed emoting, particularly in the final scenes of the third episode of ""Canterbury's"" when every element of Elizabeth's life falls apart.

It would have been great if ""Canterbury's"" had not fallen victim to low ratings and the Writer's Guild strike-- even if it had been a one-year-and-done series, I'd appreciate having another 7 or so episodes to view, with further development of the characters of Elizabeth and her husband, as well as her law firm employees, all of whom seemed to be coming into their own by ep 6. On the other hand, if ""Canterbury's"" had been a success, who knows if ""Good Wife"" would have been made-- and that would have been a tragedy!",1438387200,5,1316,5.120930232558139

Her marriage (to Aiden Quinn) is falling apart despite attempts at marriage counseling.  Margulies plays a tough, quick-speaking and hard-nosed attorney who defends her clients to the max.

I was pleasantly surprised to stumble across this gem of a series. I agree with others that the show had so much potential. The acting was brilliantly played out. The theme and recurring events patterning through the show kept you waiting and wanting for more.

It's obvious that the wrong network had the rights to air it. If this had been on primetime tv such as the likes of an awesome show, ""The Good Wife"" that Julianna now stars in, it would have soared in popularity and would have been given a real chance to succeed.

I'm into the fourth episode, wishing there was more than six. However, fortunately I can also watch Julianna shine in her latest endeavor.

I liked this show so much I also bought a set for Christmas. If you like Julianna Margulies, you will DEFINITELY enjoy this short lived show!",1256428800,34,1034,4.603260869565218

8322237,5,B001MVYUP2,"If it weren't for the Good Wife I probably would have missed this short-lived TV show on DVD. Its good, sometimes similar to the Good Wife but also very different.

Canterbury is a complicated lady who is having difficulty in her marriage and pushes the envelope of the law which got her into trouble but we can see that she found a way out.

It's too bad it didn't last longer as it would have been an interesting series. I suspect because of this she was noticed and got the role in the Good Wife which was also an excellent series.",1517356800,,534,4.2772277227722775

8322242,5,B001MVYUP2,"As good as The Good Wife, but grittier and often more intense in the courtroom; I'm surprised this series wasn't picked up for more seasons.....Julianna looks her natural self (unlike in The Good Wife where she wears wigs of straight hair) which adds to the less polished and grittier sense of each episode; and the supporting cast is top rate as is the writing for these wonderful actors......",1503878400,,394,4.8088235294117645
