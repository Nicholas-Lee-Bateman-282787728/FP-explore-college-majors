8086169,5,B000BFIJUC,"Hey I know the humor is sophomoric and some would say cheesy but I really like the whole show. The girls are hot, usually, the guest stars are extraordinary, the music is good. I wish I could get all 585 episodes.",1355184000,7,213,4.219512195121951
8086170,5,B000BFIJUC,This was a joke for my husband and he loves them. His friend borrow them to play too. My husband plays them over and over.,1303689600,2,122,3.92
8086171,3,B000BFIJUC,"The few episodes that Time Life released are ok, but this show deserves being released in complete season box sets on DVD. Hopefully this will happen in the future.",1246752000,19,164,4.689655172413793
8086172,1,B000BFIJUC,"Very simply, I orderd the product in good faith thinking Amazon screened those vendore with whom they did business.  the item never was received and the independent vendor never delivered the product. I will not order on Amazon again.  I've had no asssistance in resolving the matter, nor for that mattter only a passing of the buck to the vendor for whom they claim no responsibility.  Not a good standard or model to continue what has been avery sucesssful online franchise. I will accept responsibility for not having known now about Amazon's operating pprocedure. However, you live and learn.",1227484800,17,596,5.0
8086173,5,B000BFIJUC,"This collection is NOT complete, which would take a suitcase of DVDs (who cares, they do it for Dr. Who. Why not Hee Haw?).

This collection brings Hee Haw Episodes 1, 2, 72, 124, 152, 210, 240, 372, and ""A Salute to Hee Haw"" and a few other snippets DVDs together in one box set.

For fans, video and audio quality is fine, although given Dolly Parton's incomparable voice, and that Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Buck Owens, and Roy Clark are all featured at the peak of their abilities and musicianship we'd love it if the musical features were somehow remastered and improved.

But the best part of the collection is that it contains elements of all the things you loved from the original series: corny but clean humour, wonderful comedic and musical talents, and a cast who clearly were having the time of their lives putting the show together. And what a CONSISTANT cast! The same faces year after year was a comfort, and reflective of the small town ethos projected by the whole ensemble. Such innocence is lost from the modern world of television production, and I look forward to introducing my children to this national treasure of American broadcasting.

These DVDs feature ""KORN News"" ""Where Oh Where are you tonight"" ""Pickin' and Grinin'"" ""Sample Sales"" (featuring the master of comedic understatement Junior Samples) """"Gloom, Despair and Agony On Me"" ""The Gossip Girls""

""Now, we're not ones to go 'round spreadin' rumors,
Why, really we're just not the gossipy kind,
No, you'll never hear one of us repeating gossip,
So you'd better be sure and listen close the first time!""

""The Fence""  ""Hey Grandpa! What's for supper?"" and ""The Cornfield.""

And any former members of the HEE HAW cast who read this: thank you. You provided happy memories for me from my childhood...a show where innocent fun and patriotism and uniquely American cultural values were not deprecated but embraced with laughter, joy, reverence, and love for our fellow man. You enriched our culture.",1199664000,41,1980,4.88955223880597
8086174,4,B000BFIJUC,"I thought the description was a little misleading, stating that you get ""everything ever made"" in this set.  585 Hee Haw episodes were made, it ran weekly for many years.  In this set you get about 24 episodes I believe.  Still, my father loved the show.  He is getting a lot of enjoyment out of this set.",1132617600,101,305,4.298245614035087
