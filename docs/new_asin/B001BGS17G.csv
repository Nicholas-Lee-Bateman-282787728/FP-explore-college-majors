3492240,4,B001BGS17G,I will say that this season was darker than the last two but otherwise it is great.,1226361600,,83,3.9411764705882355
3492241,5,B001BGS17G,"Robot chicken is great !
Even though I'm from Germany the differences between nerds in the state and here are little-to-none ;-)

I hope the show never ends.",1225843200,,157,4.607142857142857
3492242,5,B001BGS17G,"With the third outing of Seth Green's Robot Chicken, once again a collection of random stop-action toy skits lasting about thirty seconds a piece, the animation is even more smooth and the funny ideas keep coming.  They continue to plumb and parody ideas mostly from 80s toys with a few more modern references, so it helps if you know the period (MASK is a pretty obscure reference, as well as the non-lion Voltron).  Yes, that is Stan Lee and the Micro Machines guy.  At about ten minutes an episode, it's great TV for the ADD generation in small doses, and works well when you can see them together and pause at a few scenes.",1224201600,,627,4.482456140350878
3492243,5,B001BGS17G,"The 5 star rating is for the show itself, but I'm on my second copy of this DVD set and I'm experiencing the same weird defect. The subtitles pop up at the beginning of each skit for about 10 seconds or so and then disappear. Otherwise the discs play normally. I haven't seen anything reported about this online, and I can't imagine it's isolated to the 2 copies I got. So it's back to Best Buy to try out a 3rd copy.",1224028800,,417,4.097560975609756
3492244,5,B001BGS17G,"If there's nothing that can satisfy your hunger for a sketch comedy show that is actually funny, smart, and never gets old.  Robot Chicken is that show and this box set includes over 20 episodes, Unrated, a load of special features.  The third season shines with more hilarious sketches and fine-tuned writing that promotes hilarity.  If you own previous seasons this is a must-have, don't think about it just buy it. Nothing is sacred in this blockbuster cult smash-hit of a sketch comedy show.  Seth green and company have dedicate a level of intensity to make the comedy funny and memorable for years to come.",1223856000,,612,4.8
3492245,5,B001BGS17G,Robot Chicken season 3 is probably the best comedy show on adult swim! The episodes are great! The special features are really good too.,1223424000,,136,4.708333333333333
3492246,5,B001BGS17G,"You can't help but love Robot Chicken.  The brainchild of Seth Green, Robot Chicken never stops being anything but funny, and the episodes featured in this third season collection are no exception.  Featured here are more skits featuring your favorite subjects of nerd-dom, including seeing Soundwave from Transformers cope with being a boom-box in the modern day, a re-creation of a famous G.I. Joe battle, a 24-spoof starring Dracula, a chicken-fied take of Law & Order, The Shield's Vic Mackey joining the world of the Fantastic Four, He-Man getting murdered, a zombified Kool-Aid guy, and a more than memorable Christmas themed episode which is a highlight of the entire series, and features a vengeful nerd getting transported to Narnia among other vignettes.  This season also isn't short on voice talent either, and features contributions from regulars Green and Breckin Meyer, as well as Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, Mila Kunis, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Michelle Trachtenberg, Ginnifer Goodwin, Dave Coulier, Kelly Hu, Snoop Dogg, Emma Caulfield, Katee Sackhoff, Stan Lee, Hayden Panettiere, Donald Faison, Michael Chiklis, Chris Evans, Julian McMahon, Rosario Dawson, Skeet Ulrich, Mark Hamil, Masi Oka, Amy Smart, Billy Dee Williams, Malcolm McDowell, Matthew Lillard, Nathan Fillion, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon among others.  The only flaws of the third season of Robot Chicken lie in the DVD itself, which is a little scant on special features compared to previous seasons.  That aside though, Robot Chicken is still a hilarious blast, and you already know that this is an essential addition to your Adult Swim library.",1223337600,4,1658,5.361538461538461
3492257,3,B001BGS17G,I enjoy robot chicken and look forward to any new episodes. I don't like every episode in this season 3 DVD. not that its bad and overall I had a good laugh at most of this series.,1424044800,,180,3.891891891891892

3492289,4,B001BGS17G,"Buying the DVD is so much better than watching it on Adult Swim. There are no commercials, it is not censored, and there are many options. I'm very happy with this product.",1260144000,,172,4.40625
3492290,4,B001BGS17G,"If you like Robot Chicken, then you will buy this and nothing I write here is going to change your mind.  This is NOT for young kids in case anyone is unfamiliar with the series as there are be profanity and crude situations featured.",1254441600,,234,4.318181818181818
3492291,5,B001BGS17G,"I really enjoyed this season of robot chicken, my favorite episode is bionic cow when sylar steals a magic trick off an old guy and ends up with explosive diarrhea. I also love the opening of the zombies dancing to thriller and fraggle rock finding a new home. I think unlike family guy robot chicken has either stayed on par or progressed.",1253836800,3,340,4.5
3492292,5,B001BGS17G,"If you have seen my reviews on the past two seasons then you really don't need to read this. If you want to see you all your favorite toys and nostalgic posessions make fun of current events pop culture and hump one another. First buy the first two seasons watch, love and laugh and pick up season 3. It only gets better with season 3. Oh yes, the famous question 'where do I go from here?' need not apply with Robot Chicken.",1250640000,,425,4.195121951219512
3492293,1,B001BGS17G,"This show must have hard core fans no matter what the material is. If you enjoyed the past two seasons you will probably like this one as well depending on your ability to decepher art from trash. The first couple episodes started out bad I notice they recycled everything from the first two seasons to this one, same shows and commericials to make fun of. The Ted kennedy/jenna jammeson skit was one of the dumbest. The writers had no original material so they made it up with excessive cursing, violence, and gut wrenching vulgar scenes that were not even funny. Hopefully the next season will have well written material and not just recycled trash.",1247875200,,651,4.719298245614035
3492294,4,B001BGS17G,"Robot Chicken has always been amazingly funny to me, the skits have always been witty and clever with enough nostalgia from toys of my past to make this a great series.

Season 3 is really more of the same, the same voices, the same amusing little sketches. Einstein in marriage counseling - ""You know what the smartest thing to ever come out of your mouth? Mien doodle!"" - Pure genius.

If you haven't been a fan of the first 2 seasons or you have only been a casual fan this season is really nothing that you haven't seen a million times.",1247184000,,540,4.336633663366337
3492295,3,B001BGS17G,"this is the 3rd season, and after enjoying the previous seasons, it
struck me in this season that they might need some new personel to do
some of the voice overs.  Im starting to hear the same character voice
in many different sketches and its becomming anoying to a point...
Anyway ...the show is original and hope to see season 4.",1236556800,2,332,4.442622950819672
3492296,5,B001BGS17G,My wife and I can't get enough of this show!!! We pre-order every season and it always arrives the same day it comes out in stores.,1234483200,,131,4.076923076923077
3492317,5,B001BGS17G,"While I myself am unfamiliar with this show, the receiver of this gift was thrilled with it.  He was shocked also as he did not know that a third season was available on DVD.  Upon receiving it, he immediately popped it into the DVD player was glued to the computer watching it and laughing loudly and non-stop.",1231200000,,311,4.43859649122807
3492318,4,B001BGS17G,"My husband and I love Robot Chicken. The first time he saw the show he laughed so hard our neighbors in the next apartment woke up and started banging on the wall. Our only gripe with this third season is that it is uncensored. I never would have thought this was a problem, as it is an adult show, but dropping the F-bomb more times in a 15 minutes show than most R-rated films do makes the show less funny. It makes it seem like it's trying too hard. It's excessive and distracting. It was way funnier when all of the swear words were beeps. All of the nudity is also uncensored. This mostly consists of Barbie boobs which aren't erotic in the least. It was funnier when they were blurred out because it made it seem like it was something inappropriate, instead of a child's plaything.
Some people might think we are just prudes that are offended by the language, but if that were the case, we wouldn't watch the show at all. My point is Robot Chicken was funnier when they didn't need so much uncensored language. The show can carry itself without it.",1230681600,28,1054,4.38265306122449
3492319,5,B001BGS17G,"Almost endlessly imaginative and hilarious! The robot chicken crew has again come through with beautifully-made figure-and-clay animation shorts that elevate, then skewer a mix of pop culture, dream life, and ""real"" life. You've got to see their take on the manger scene, or members of the Justice League of America living life between acts of heroism! Only Star Wars is sacred; everything else -- watch out!",1229731200,2,408,5.196969696969697
3492320,5,B001BGS17G,"I received this as an early Christmas present a few hours ago and I watched them all! There are all very funny and I laughed 'til I cried! There are a lot of awesome skits like Popeye being addicted to Spinach, The Worst HALLOWEEN, President Bush dealin with a Gremlin, Jesus Christ stars in 'The 33 Year Old Virgin, being raped by a ghost, movie trailers, celebrate Christmas, and much more! If you love the series, you'll love ROBOT CHICKEN: SEASON THREE!!!",1229385600,2,459,4.609756097560975
3492321,3,B001BGS17G,Season 2 I thought was better. Season three had it's moments but I personally liked season 2.,1229040000,,93,4.529411764705882
3492322,5,B001BGS17G,"This season is even better than the second one, Highly recommended!
The only aspect I did not like is the cheap carton packaging.
This ""save the world"" campaigns are making companies to throw merchandise wrapped in a banana paper carton. Damn hippies!",1228176000,,251,5.0
3492323,3,B001BGS17G,"The first and second seasons were genious! All of it. But season 3 is somewhat disappointing. I've tried to forget some of the images that have entered my head, but cant.
However some if it re-captures it's old charm.",1227484800,2,217,4.589743589743589

3492326,5,B001BGS17G,"A perfect blend of pop culture insanity!!! You can tell that the creators of this were 70's to 80's children. Crude stop motion animation is just fun as heck to watch! I've bought all 3 seasons released so far & the only ""bad"" thing I can say about any of the season sets is being upset when the last episode is over & I want more!",1226534400,,331,4.03030303030303

8283212,1,B001BGS17G,Didn't get original case. Got a random DVDs case with the title printed stuck on front. Looked dumb and also the inside clips to hold the disc in place were broken so the DVDs were loose bouncing around in it since they tried to double stack them. Wow guys really??,1428624000,,265,4.32
8283213,3,B001BGS17G,"The problem I tend to run into with Robot Chicken is it becomes the same joke over and over and over. The ""Star Wars"" special was nice, as was the first DC one, but the season sets reveal the show's weakness when watched in binge fashion.",1426896000,,238,4.195652173913044
