7886676,4,6305280851,"CARDIAC ARREST (1980) is the story of the notorious ""missing heart murders"". The killer has just struck again, and homicide detectives, Clancy Higgins (Garry Goodrow- INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS '78) and Wylie Wong (Michael Paul Chan) are on the case. Meanwhile, Leigh Gregory (Max ""Wojo"" Gail) and his wife Dianne (Susan O'Connell), are listening as a doctor tells them of Dianne's terminal heart condition, and that a transplant isn't possible. The distraught couple soon receives a call from a mystery man, claiming to be able to provide a heart transplant for Dianne. Is there possibly a black market that deals in human organs? Is the killer one of the suppliers? Leigh visits the caller, and is told to raise a certain amount of cash. Higgins and Wong gather evidence and run down clues. The more they find out about the case, the more complex it appears to get. Is a conspiracy afoot? An enjoyable movie w/ an interesting plot. WARNING: CARDIAC ARREST is a true late 70's / early 80's film, complete w/ mile-long cars, every fashion fiasco of the day, and extreme chain-smoking by just about everyone! Co-stars Fred Ward (REMO WILLIAMS), w/ a cameo by Marjorie Eaton (THE ATOMIC BRAIN)...",1503878400,,1198,4.906403940886699
7886677,2,6305280851,"Despite the cool cover, this film doesn't deliver the gore whatsoever. The bloodiest scene in the film is a tame and quick glimpse of a guy getting stabbed later on in the film. The violent content in the film is really low, and you see no gruesome remains at all from the small amount of dead people that are lying around. There's also no nudity. The movie is about black market organ transplants, and some detectives are trying to solve the case. I thought it was decently directed, and I had no problem with the acting. It also has a nice nostalgic type look and feel, but it was too talky and slow. I didn't notice this at first, but when I was watching it again, it seemed that the sound went off for just a moment during a minor curse word. If it did this again then I didn't notice because the film still had trouble holding my attention. If you're an avid fan of retro horror, you may have some interest in it because of the feel and retro California scenery. However, I think it's best described as a film that most will dislike and find boring because not much stuff happens. It has an R on the back of the case, but I'm not sure if that's correct. By todays standards, it's like a PG-13 film. On ebay, I saw that the MEDIA VHS version is rated PG.

This looks like it's mastered from a VHS source. It looks a little old and is not very clean, but the quality is pretty good for a VHS source. There's no menu screen, chapter stops, or extras; you just get the film.",1420070400,2,1475,4.212014134275618
7886678,1,6305280851,"CARDIAC ARREST should be arrested:  the writer, director, cast, everyone involved with this intensely boring crime caper should have been put behind bars and given limited probation possibilities.  Even Fred Ward who must be making one of his earliest screen performances as co-owner of an ambulance service that has more dire deeds in mind.  Ditto Maxwell Gail (Barney Miller) who is cast as a distressed husband who will do anything to get a heart for his dying wife (Susan O'Connell).  Garry Goodrow has the lead role of a renegade detective named Higgins who is trying to find the serial killer who is extracting the hearts from his victims.  The script plods along at a snail's pace and has so many holes, it looks like Swiss Cheese.  A grainy transfer to DVD with foul language bleeped out, this howler should never even been put on DVD.  It's an early seventies movie, and that explains the hairdo, the Granada, and everyone lighting up cigarettes at a moment's notice.  Incoherent and dull, avoid this cardiac clunker.",1106524800,2,1026,4.890173410404624
