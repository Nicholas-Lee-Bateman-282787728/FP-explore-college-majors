6899155,5,B00R5TAX9C,"While the movie itself is nowhere near worthy of a 5-Star rating, this brand new Blu-Ray release from Olive Films deserves it based on video/audio improvements. I recorded this off the late show in 1989, bought the official VHS in the 1990s and the MGM Midnight Movies DVD in 2004 but THIS is the copy to own for true fans of this film with crystal clear audio and eye-popping colors. The night scenes are most improved with much more detail and better lighting. **NOTE** See the screen grab comparisons I posted in this review. They do not do this release justice.

For me, the real draw here isn't Frankie or Annette, but watching Candy Johnson frug up a frenzy in an early scene on the beach and over the closing credits theme sung by Stevie Wonder; and seeing Mr. Peter Lupus [credited here as Rock Stevens] in all his muscled glory. Though he's not as ripped as some of the other competitive body builders that appear in Don Rickles' stable of beefcake, as his character himself states, Lupus' character Flex Martian is ""the biggest, the strongest, the handsomest"". I wholeheartedly concur!",1424476800,7,1095,4.732984293193717

8694223,4,B00R5TAX9C,"Fun in the sun, beach babes, songs and a bit of a  plot. Notable for a pre-Mission:Impossible Peter Lupus under the short lived stage name of Rock Stevens. an enjoyable romp.",1475884800,,174,4.612903225806452
8694224,3,B00R5TAX9C,The viewing quality is surprisingly clear and somewhat higher definition than expected. I really only bought this movie for the famed Runnin' Wild dance off scene with Frankie and a few of the surfer girls. Mission accomplished!,1453334400,,228,5.1891891891891895
8694225,5,B00R5TAX9C,"Although this isn't my favorite Frankie & Annette ""Beach Movie"", Olive Films did a bang-up job with this Blu-ray. The picture is crystal clear, the colors pop right out of the screen and the audio is as good as it's ever been. I have no doubt that Muscle Beach Party looks better on my big LCD television than it ever did during its theatrical run in the 1960's. I also bought the Beach Blanket Bingo (a far superior film) Blu from Olive Films and it's stunning as well. Hopefully we can get Beach Party and Bikini Beach on Blu-ray soon!",1435449600,2,537,4.38
