921718,5,630469623X,This is even more real than American History X in my opinion. When you watch real movies it makes you think about the society we all live in. Menace 2 Society is very deep and meaningful. From beginning to end you stayed glued to the tube to see what happens next. This is a film that should be seen by anyone who is old enough to watch it. I would recommend that you check this film out if you already havent.,998265600,,410,4.074074074074074
921719,5,630469623X,"This has to be the best ""gangsta"" movie that I've seen yet. It's way better than Boyz In Tha Hood. There is alot more action it this movie.",982108800,,139,4.0
921720,5,630469623X,"menace 2 society is one of the most real movies of all time, considering everything in this movie has probably happned sometime. the characters are all realistic. the things they do, they way they act. the movie makes you think about categorizing Compton's inner city blacks about crime. they gotta do what they gotta do, every event that happens in this movie is just looked at as another homicide or another gang related act, but from the characters points of view its revenge, getting juice, stayin real, and ""not goin out like a chump"". the movie is definately the best. my favorite quote is ""make that a double burger WITH cheese"", watch the movie and you will see what im talking about",980208000,,691,4.672131147540983
921721,5,630469623X,"Okay, since im from London, i cant accuratly depict if this is, or is not the real situations encountered by members of the LA public.  But upon  watching this for the first time, it really hit me that the horrific things  portraid in this movie could happen to anyone of us.
 Caine, the main  focus of the movie, was brought up in a drug filled home, his father was a  drug dealer, and his mother a heroin addict.  Caine first saw someone be  shot when he was just a child, as shown in the films early scenes.  Following this his father is murdered in a fixed drug deal, and his mother  overdoses, and dies.
 Caines best friend O-Dogg is a 16year old, who,  as is said in the movie is 'Americas worst nightmare', hes young, Black,  and he just don't giv'a F***.
 I won't spoil the movie by saying anymore,  but take it from me this is one of the the best movies you will see in a  long time, especially if you like the whole gang thing, it also has  historical content of the 'Watt's rights'.  I say buy it as soon as you  can.",966124800,5,1028,4.153061224489796
921722,4,630469623X,"Powerfull and Dramatic yet bloody and gruesome, this movie is without a  doubt the best hood movie of all time. It shows two totally different sides  of life in the hood. Caine is trying his best too make something of himself  and get out of the hood. His friend O Dogg is a thug who likes to brag  about the men he kills. The film starts as Caine and O Dogg go into a store  to buy a bear. The Asian clerks fear that they may steel so they hurry  them. The male clerk tells O Dogg that he feels sorry for his mother so O  Dogg kills both of them. There are some especially bloody scenes. This is a  must see for fans of Boyz N the hood and Friday.",965952000,,648,3.8931297709923665
921723,5,630469623X,"The Hughes' brothers depiction of inner city life is graphic in nature, but that's what they use to make their point.  It's a vivid look at the lives lead by the youth of America's inner cities.  It looks at how these  youths, particularly the males, see the glamour of hustlin', but are blind  to the repercussions of leading such a life.  The movie's main character,  Caine, finds out all about these repercussions in the worst possible way.  This movie is not a glamourization of gangster life as many people believe.  It is a realistic portrayal of life and death in the 'hood.  Bravo!",957830400,,589,4.640776699029126
921724,5,630469623X,This movie was a harsh and realistic protrayal of life in the ghetto.  The acting was top notch and the plot was great.  I liked how the story is told from a first person perspective.  It really adds a lot.,943747200,3,206,4.1

921979,5,630469623X,"This is a classic movie that will correlate with the struggles many African-American males living in the inner-city may experience for years to come. Some have said it is a stereotypical portrayal of black males....but as we know, some stereotypes are based in fact. Very sad but very true reality expressed in this movie. Someone borrowed my original and I didn't even want it back, opted to just re-buy the Director's Cut. Sits side-by-side with Boyz In The Hood, and South Central and Juice.",1504656000,,494,4.892857142857143
921980,5,630469623X,"When you think of good coming of age movies that came out during the early 90's, you can't compile your list without naming Menace II Society. I love this movie, not just because I'm big on nostalgia and everything 90's, but because like Poetic Justice, South Central, Juice, Boyz n the Hood, Above the Rim, Strapped and many others, this movie showcased what was occurring in many urban areas across America...it may not be glamorous but it's what reality was for so many.",1502755200,,473,4.710843373493976

923457,5,630469623X,"This is one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen in my life.  I haven't watched it since I was a teenager.  I remember being thoroughly entertained by the movie when I saw it at the theater back in 1993.  Still, when I watched it yesterday I was surprised at how incredible it is.  All of these years later - and after viewing thousands of movies during the past 2 decades - I can honestly look back and say that this movie ranks among the all time great films as far as I am concerned.

I put this up there with The Empire Strikes Back, Do The Right Thing, To Kill A Mockingbird, Goodfellas, The Godfather (Parts 1 & 2), Die Hard, Taxi Driver, Akira and a handful of other movies that I have come to respect as the best of the best.

The mix of drama and comedy is not rivaled by any other movie that I have seen.  As serious as the subject matter in the movie is - I don't think that I have ever laughed so hard at some of the scenarios that play out in a film.  The characters are realistic (I knew somebody like every major character in the film when I was growing up) and despite the comedic output the grim tone of the film is somehow preserved throughout the entirety of its' running time.

This is a classic film and deserves to go down in history for the delightful performances by the leads, the insightful writing and direction that captures the danger and excitement of the lives of these characters and the incredible cinematography.

The film received widespread critical acclaim at the time of its' release.  It won a best film award in 1994 and an Independent Spirit Award for Best Cinematography in the same year.  If you look at the list of movies that came out in 1993 you will note  that those are incredible achievements for a film with the modest budget that Menace II Society was created with.  22 years after the debut of Menace II Society I think it should be looked back upon as the cinematic masterpiece that it is.

This is more than upper echelon film making.  This is one of those times when all the stars lined up perfectly for a project and everything fell into place to create something that exceeded the bounds of perfection.",1427587200,,2167,4.3399503722084365

What makes ""Menance II Society, (along with ""Boyz""n The Hood"") different is that you actually (kinda) care about these individuals because they know they need to change their ways but don't know how to or feel it won't matter anyway. I'm not going to give a detailed review because I assume most on this site have already seen the movie.  The blu ray edition is crystal clear and the audio commentary was interesting.",1366588800,,600,4.555555555555555
924105,4,630469623X,"I remember seeing this film years ago when it first came out. It was quite disturbing then and still is now. While some has changed over the 20 years since this movie's release, you can bet there are still plenty of young, black men dealing with all that this movie tells you about the ghetto. In a lot of ways, you already know how it's going to end, but you still want to see it all play out in front of you.

I grew up around people similar to the characters portrayed in this film and I have to tell you this story rings very true. Now that I am 35, I look back at all the people I knew then and thankfully, a lot of them got out of that lifestyle and turned things around. Sadly, some stayed and sure enough, the hood ate them alive.

You'll see a young Jada Pinkett Smith here as well as Lorenz Tate who pulls off ""America's Nightmare"" rather well. The cameo by Samuel L Jackson is amazing. It took me a moment to realize it was him, but when I did, it sort of made sense for him to be in the film. Charles S Dutton also plays a smaller role, but he does a very good job.

The film itself is gritty, violent, and real to life in Watts. There is plenty of cussing, drug use, drinking, and some incredibly violent acts. While some may think this film glorifies this sort of behavior, it also shows you how you can expect your life to turn out if you don't find a way out of the game.

As far as the Blu Ray disc, the transfer was decent and the sound was better than some discs. You don't have to turn up the volume to hear the dialog which is a plus. I know the studios purposely do that so you can get more of a theater experience, but more often than not it's just a hassle. The picture looks alright and you can still see the grain of the film the movie was shot on back in the early nineties.

The soundtrack is very good and has songs from an assortment of the popular rap and R&B artists of the time. In fact, most fans of rap music look at the tracks and consider them as part of the golden age of the gangster rap genre (Approx: 1988 - 1994).

In some ways, I wonder if this might be a film you'd want to show the so called gangsters of today. While the world has changed, there are still kids that think this is the kind of lifestyle they want, even those who do not live in a bad neighborhood. In a way, this is a movie they might be able to learn from.

So many social sciences are at play in him, everything from looking for confirmation from male peers, and needing the involvement of a father, to parenting and financial response. The Hughes Brothers made the film to explain these very items, to white America who always misunderstood us. The cherry on the cake was Caine dying. On Boyz in Da Hood, the star Trey lives and goes to college. The Hughes brothers frowned upon this, as it is not accurate to inner city boys. Instead, Cain, the star of Menace to Society dies, sharing with viewers the story of all of the other people who never make it. The sad ending was on purpose.

There will be images of intense violence, you will see the shattering of innocence, and cruelties of lives taken. But there is a message.

924454,4,630469623X,"Man, 1993 passed by so fast.  It's almost 20 years ago!!

Ever since Blu Ray came out, I have been fiendin for some black films (mainly from the 70's.  Shaft and Superfly remastered with 5.1!) and they have taken their time!  Finally Do the Right Thing came out, but I guess that does not count as 'they' see that as Spike Lee's cinamatic masterpiece.  Well, now Friday, Set it Off and Menace II Society have come out.  I guess this will have to do until some of those 70's films come out...

Looking at this film now, you forget that it is only a hour and a half!  The picture quality looked like Friday.  It had a film look, but not an exceptionally sharp look to it.  It was clear with film grain, but not dirty.  Detail was there, but it was no Kingdom of Heaven or The Incedible Hulk quality!  In fact, it looks like Do the Right Thing on BD, but slight less detailed.  So if you know how that is, then there you have it.  It is good quality and somewhat 3D, but not like blockbuster films.

Now the sound, which is in Dolby TruHD and is on point!  I always felt like I was in the scenes that were being shown!  When they go to the prison or through a home with music playing and exit it, the music goes behind the action and is where it should be no matter the direction.  Once Caine leaves the house, the music is behind him.  In the prison, the people talking on the side stay on the side that they should be on regardless of orientation.  This is how surround sound should be done!  I was not expecting it from this film.

If you like the movie, get it.  If you are expecting Sean Connery James Bond quality, then you may want to pass.  It looks like film and you feel that you are at the movies.  I guess that is what we want.

Update:  I forgot to add that there is posterization in the film.  Most natably in the New Line Cinema logo at the start, in Jada's room and on the making of HD version.",1252627200,,1907,4.094850948509485

O-Dog takes offense and shoots the Korean storekeeper and his wife, and takes the video surveillance tape of the shooting, before he and Caine flee the scene.

I just never felt any attachment to any of the actors to the point where I didn't give a hoot if they lived or died.  The main charactor is sympathetic in one scene, then a total maniac in the next.  There is never a common theme throughout the entire film, and every charactor has split personalities.  The dialogue is pretty lame and the basic plot of the movie is revenge.  This one is getting that one and that one's getting this one back.  Just kind of juvenile and boring.  I'll watch Dead Presidents again just to get this bad taste out of my mouth.

Actually I am lucky to own the VHS version. You see one night while I was sleeping an ex-girlfriend decided to assault me with my VHS copy of the film Seven staring Brad Pitt and a human head.

I awoke to the tape bouncing off my noggin...when I realized what was going on it was too late for SEVEN, the tape had been pulled from the plastic rectangle and all I could do was jump to my feet to see what was happening outside my bedroom. What I stumbled upon was pure horror!

The soon to be ex had my copy (my most prized movie possession) of Menace to Society in her clutches and was about to begin dismantling the movie I had come to love. I bolted forward and grabbed the tape from her and escorted her away from the property.

Now most of you may not see this review as a review of the movie, but having a crazy woman try to break your most prized possessions and twarting her efforts on Round 2 (since she won Round 1 with Seven...a film I didn't particularly care for, but stole fair and square from a buddy we call Lunch Box) is a victory for me.

Meet Caine Lawson (a brilliant performance from Tyrin Turner). As a boy in the Watts, California hood with his heroin addict mother and murdering drug dealer father Tat (Samuel L.

Fresh out of high school, Caine hits the streets as a drug hustler trying to make money for expensive cars to attract the ladies and to take care of Ronnie (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Anthony, the family of his childhood role model Pernell who is in prison. It is a struggling situation between family/role model man, and the lure of the streets for Caine. Despite the preaching from his grandfather, trouble is always around the corner for Caine, especially when he's with his best friend O-Dog (a very convincing performance from (Larenz Tate), who is basically a don't give a f**k ticking time bomb waiting to explode. Besides being involved in a fatal convenience store shooting and being stalked by the police, Caine also struggles to keep himself alive. When his cousin gets killed and he himself gets shot, Caine realizes after talking with Ronnie that he needs to make a fresh start in life before it's too late. Traveling to Atlanta with her and Anthony may be the only thing that would save him. But there's no fighting the lure of street trouble; selling drugs, getting into mischief of O-Dog and the gang, getting back at the guys who killed his cousin and possibly impregnating a woman. But by the time Caine decides to go away with Ronnie and Anthony, his mistakes may have stirred up a hornet's nest that will come back to haunt him in the most tragic of ways. For Caine, it may be too late to redeem himself for good.

This movie is an eye-opener and sends a very harsh and true message about upbringing, lifestyles and choices. Boozing, drugs, shooting, attacking, cruising and all the while trying to survive, get respect and rise above, not to mention being a role model. These are just a few of the things that mirror inner city life. You can run from the streets, but the streets will always be in you. This is what Caine must face. Awesome funky hip-hip soundtrack and some serious intense acting make this movie great. The street-wise lingo, the clothes, the attitude; all this pulls the movie together. Special features include an in-depth interview with the Hughes twins who directed the film, as well as the theatrical trailer, and more. Watch the film, get engrossed and recognize!",1168732800,14,2889,4.752988047808765

Menace II Society and Boyz In The Hood are the two best black movies related to the hood that you will ever see, and they both present a good message to young people while providing great entertainment!",1168300800,,277,4.245283018867925
924620,4,630469623X,"Menace II Society was the debut film from the directing duo of the Hughes brothers, released in 1993 at the height of popularity of ""hood movies"".  As most other reviewers have stated the film is an extemely powerful look at growing up in L.A in the early 90's.  The movie grabs your attention straight away with the robbery of the liquor store and the controversial shooting of the Korean owners, and the pace never lets up throughout.  Caine (Tyrin Turner) is basically a bystander in the opening scene as O-Dog (Larenz Tate) goes on a rampage, and this continues throughout the film, Caine is a good person but very much a victim of his circumstances, whereas O-Dog just ""doesn't give a f**k"".

Without going into plot details the events in the film all conspire against Caine and it all catches up with him in the inevitable ending.  There are also good performances from Jada Pinkett and MC Eiht and a small role at the start from Samuel L Jackson as Caine's father.  While the film is very powerful and a sad and realistic take on ghetto life, it is not without it's faults, the main one being the lack of depth of some of the characters.  They never really explain Caine's relationship with Parnell, though he regularly refers to him as ""like a dad"" throughout the film.  Also several of the other characters are hard to sympathise with as their background is never really explained (something I felt was done better in Boyz N The Hood),and I find it hard to believe Parnell would be cool with Caine's relationship with his girl.  Despite these minor faults the film is still great though and the ending in particular was tragic and inevitable.  One of the better hood movies of the early 90's, if your into them you should definetely check this out.",1157932800,6,1757,4.620578778135048
924621,5,630469623X,i love this movie. its called menace II society because it shows how a lil boy can grow up to be a criminal. he was influenced to that life. look at the other characters look at his mom and dad.,1148169600,5,194,3.875
924622,5,630469623X,"Roger Ebert called this film one of the most powerful movies he'd ever seen. And yeah, I guess it is. This movie, directed by The Hughes Brothers

(From Hell, Dead Presidents) portrays life in the hood as no other movie has done before. It's powerful, unapologetic, and presents us with characters that we should have no sympathy for whatsoever. Oddly enough though, we do.

The movie begins with Caine (Tyrin Turner) and O-Dog (Larenz Tate) walking into a liquor store to buy some beer. The store is owned by Korean's who follow them around mysteriously. Caine and O-Dog go about their business until they're about to walk out and O-Dog shoots and kills both of the Korean's and takes the tape of them doing it. The scene shows us the violence unflinchingly. We then see Caine's back story. His father (Samuel L. Jackson) died in a drug deal and his mother died of a heroin overdose. He lived with his religious grandparents since then and was, for the most part, raised by Pernell (Glenn Plummer) who's now serving life in prison. Caine, meanwhile, helps take care of Pernell's girlfriend Ronnie (Jada Pinkett) and

his young son Anthony, who reminds Caine of himself at a young age. The rest of the movie is events that happen in the lives of Caine and his homies

O-Dog, Doc, Wax, Sharif, Stacy, Lew-Loc, and Chauncy. Drug deals, drive-by's, rim stealing, car jacking, cold blooded murder, you name it. None of it's off limits. Through all of this, however, you like the characters. O-Dog, no matter how violent and sadistic he gets is still a great and sympathetic character. Tate's performance is so good, I'm surprised he didn't get a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Tyrin Turner, who I've never seen in another movie, is amazing as Caine; Playing both the violent street thug and sensitive guy perfectly. A pre-Will Smith, Jada Pinkett is also great as Ronnie

and should have gotten an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

This is an important movie that needs to be seen by a lot of people, since it confronts a lot of social issues in a simalar way movies like American History X, Boyz in the Hood, and even Scarface have done before. The Hughes Brothers have crafted a masterwork, a powerfully entertaining movie.

GRADE: A+",1145491200,3,2254,4.778920308483291
924623,5,630469623X,"I've probably seen this movie 20 times since it came out and I still watch it when it comes on television. I must say that some of the acting seems a bit corny now, but the images, characters and the story are still as gripping as ever. MIIS is basically a remake of the gangster classic Public Enemy from 1931. At that time Warner Brothers studios had directors that were interested in telling real stories. Another example also from 1931, I think, was I'm a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. Basically these films were about how life was in the early thirties for some people, like gangsters or poor people.

Anyway MIIS does this too. People compare it to Boyz 'n' da Hood and Do the Right Thing. Why do the Right Thing? That movie has a completely different theme than this one. It deals directly with racism, MIIS deals indirectly with racism, but is about living a life of crime in the ghetto. Boy 'n' the hood is similar, but is a morality play and also coming of age drama. Just, because black people act and direct a movie doesn't mean it's exactly the same subject. MIIS is more a tragedy, as soon as you hear the voice over of Caine and he begins to tell his story you know that this is not going to end well.

Furthermore the major part of the acting is great. Also a good thing is the dialogue in the script, it's all slang. When I first saw this movie I couldn't understand a word they were saying for the first ten minutes. This makes it more realistic, but also gives an almost Shakespeare like feel, because you have to listen with more effort to get the dialogue.

Lastly for those people who say this film is racist and stereotypical. Please look a little bit further. Stereotypes are put forward yes, but not to characterize all young black men in the hood, they are stereotypes of individuals that exist, the nut, the player, the religious fanatic, the hustler etc. And even though they are stereotyped the actors do a really good job in deepening ther characters. I can't find any racism in this film with the best of my ability, I think the directors just wanted to make a film that would be very impressive and they succeeded in that. Maybe you would like to see a more Mr. Rogers type of movie which Caines grandparents watch as O-Dog visits. A movie about a world where everything is hunky dory.

On a last note the point the movie makes is that it is not only your actions, but also your environment that inevitably lead to your fate. Even if you take the right actions the odds are highly stacked against you in places where there is little opportunity to get out of the mess you're in.",1141430400,3,2608,4.393374741200828
924624,3,630469623X,"I was pretty young when this came out, I saw it in the movies. I saw it with a few of my friends, and I remember walking out of the theater wanting to blow someone away. I'm afraid that this is the depth that this movie has. One reviewer made a comment that there were too many characters that could have had more of an impact if thier stories were explained in more detail. In effect, if they were PEOPLE instead of just characters. I agree with him. At the end, when Kane (Tyrin Turner) is talking to Pernell (Glenn Plummer), **is there an ""urban"" flick that Glenn Plummer is NOT in?** when he says, ""When I was growing up, you were like my dad."" Now, the only other scene Glenn Plummer is in, is when he shows Kane at around the age of ten how to handle a gun. All I'm saying is if we had a little more background of Pernell and Kane, maybe we could have appreciated their relationship more. Instead we know next to nothing about it. I mean, how close were they if Kane has to ask Ronnie (Pernell's girl; Jada Pinkett) how he's doing in prison, and he never goes to see him? Some  scenes that might have supposed to have been powerful were actually laughable. For example, at the end when Ronnie is tyring to persuade Kane to leave with her, she goes from, ""Do you know what Anthony (her son) asked me the other day? If you were gonna die! If you were gonna die, Kane!"" to, ""Are you gonna go with me or what?"" Way to finish that off. The whole relationship between Kane and Ronnie is kind of icky anyway, Pernell being his ""dad"" and all. And also, earlier in the film when Kane is showing Anthony how to use a gun, (the only parenting skill he aquired) and Ronnie catches him, she immediatly flies off the handle; ""I don't want my son learning how to do drive by's!!"" She must all of a sudden forget that situation because her next line is ""How many times do I have to tell you to stop giving us money?"" Apparently her pride overpowers her motherly insticnts. I don't know if this was the Hughes Brothers first film, or even if they've made more since, but for what it was, it was an appluadable effort. I gave it three stars because of the nostalgic value it holds for me, as I have with other movies I've given three stars to.",1138752000,2,2231,4.224824355971897
924693,2,630469623X,"ok, I've only just seen this film for the first time, so it's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect, but this is not a particularly good film.

I mean, it has its choice moments where it really comes together. the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed. any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status. samuel jackson's in it. and if you're a fan of dave chapelle's tyrone biggums crackhead character, the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity.

but that's really my problem with this film. serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting. and they're ALL here: the homey black grandparents, the nation of islam convert, the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine's road... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth.

take the french film 'la haine', for instance. it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment. rather than just running through a laundry list of problems, one-by-one, scene-by-scene, it really gets to the heart of something bigger, some grander alienation that urban youths feel, which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do. plus, if you can believe it, the hip-hop in 'la haine' is quite a bit better.

so while I would definitely recommend seeing this film, keep the remote aimed and ready, finger on the fast-forward button. maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching, whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising. oh yeah, and there's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason. oh, also, the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees. in a film that didn't try to carry so much social weight, that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking, but it really just cheapens this one.",1136419200,4,2253,4.798969072164948
924694,5,630469623X,"Rather than ""Menace to Society"", this movie should be titled, ""The Unfortunate Victims of a Racist Society"". My heart bleeds for the real-world counterparts of these young men, caught up in the unending battle for survival in South-central LA, and other such areas all around the country.

I understand that we all make choices, but how many do these young men have? It is a racist, exclusionary society that has condemned them to their fate; to die violently at the hands of their own brothers. Its sickening. Society is more of a menace to these young men, than they are responsible for being a menace to society.

Having said that, the movie itself is excellent. It's gritty and real to the n'th' degree. Movies like this should be a huge wakeup call for the 'powers that be' in this country, but the reality is that the grave lessons it teaches will pass unnoticed.",1134691200,5,869,4.673202614379085
924695,5,630469623X,"Menace II Society is one of those films that leaves a powerful message that is not forgotten long after you have seen it. The story focuses on a teenage street thug who is caught in the middle of gang life and drugs but doesn't know how to escape it. After getting carjacked while cruising with his cousin on the streets of South Central LA, the main character swears revenge on the gangsters who killed his cousin.

This movie is very violent and has a lot of language, but it should be shown to every teenager entering high school to show them what can happen if they decide to hook up with the wrong people and make the wrong choices in life. Although I did not like the ending very much, the impact of the film was very powerful and left quite an impact. It showed me that if you mess with the wrong people and don't take responsibility for your actions, you will get dealt with and quite possibly, killed.

The main character gets murdered because he sleeps with some chick and gets her pregnant. She tells him, and he's like ""What the heck are you telling me for? I had the plastic on extra tight."" Condoms are not foolproof. They can slip and they can break. If you are gonna be with a woman for one night, make sure she is on something else, or pull out.

JACKSON (one of the greatest actors of our time), when he's at the table playing cards when the guy across from him gives Tat some attitude.

924798,5,630469623X,"Menace II Society Movie Review

 There have been many things stated about the movie I am reviewing.  I have heard so many things from people about it.  Yet still many people have never even heard or seen it.  It is one of those movies that you have been just awed by it.  It has so much character and content, it leaves audiences feeling as though the have missed something.  This film which is none as Menace to Society is probably one of the best if not the best films depicting black youth and culture in the early 90's.  This film is thought of as the new generation for the Boys-N-The Hood.  This movie was filmed right around the time of the Rodney King beating.  When there was a lot or racial profiling and racism going on in California.  There was so much crime and crooked cops at the time; it was the perfect setting and a perfect story.  Directed by the Hughes Brothers who also wrote and directed From Hell staring Johnny Depp, this film will be an all-time classic for society.  If you ever wanted to know how the ghetto can be, and how it is molds an African-American male.  Then this is the movie you need to see.

 The movie stars Tyrin Turner as Cane the main star.  He grows up having to see his father murder a guy when he was just a child.  He also later has his father shot killed in a drug deal gone wrong and his mother overdose on heroin.  He stays with his grandmother and grandfather.  The movie picks up on his last day of high school before graduation.  Where after that his life seems to kind of go on a dangerous adventure.  He is accompanied by his friend O'Dogg who is played by Lorenz Tate.  This character labeled as Americas worst nightmare a young black dude that don't give a F*** about nobody.  Also, staring as his love interest Jada Pinkett-Smith, this movie has a up and coming actors and actresses.

 This movie is an all-time great classic gangster movie.  This is a movie that shows the ghetto and society as it is around that time.  This is the Cornbread Earl and Me for my generation, the Boyz-N-The Hood.  This represents what many people outside the black urban community do not see.  This film to me is right up there with all other gangster movies; Scarface, Hoodlum, and all Godfathers.  This movie represents the struggles the problems the consequences that black people in the urban community encounter.  There is a part in the movie when Cane's grandfather sat down with him and O'Dogg.  He asked them what were they going to do in life, he told them that the streets are not there forever and the only thing out there is jail or death.  Neither one had an acceptable answer then he asked do they care whether they live or die?  This is how everyone feels coming out of the ghetto, it's like the ghetto has a hold on you and there is hell to go through to break it.  I know too many people that have gotten caught up in the ghetto and who may never make it out.  It's a shame that it happens like this, but this is my main reason for identifying with the movie.  For the rest of my life this may be the best black gangster movie representative of my African-American generation.",1096416000,2,3133,4.365684575389948

Tyrin Turner(Kaydee) did a excellent dabut about a man who gets cought up in a situation he wants to get out of.  Larenz Tate(O-Dog)  is more of a straight up gangsta, but did a real good job at acting.  Movies with strong messages like this make up for a excellent drama.

This film was used in my ethics class and everyone had nothing but the best to say about it. Larenz Tate was also in a man apart with vin diesel. I know the reviews were bad, but he is very good in that one too. F the critics man, give this boy his props. He was also in Dead Presidents, a fantastic realistic movie about war and delaing with poverty. It is also directed by the Hughes Brothers. Keep it up Tate, you da man!

Probably one of the best scenes in Menace II Society, Cain and O-Dawg are buying a beer at the corner store and trobule springs when the Asian clerk makes fun of O-Dawg.  Not all hood movies have as good as characters as Menace II Society or plot lines too.  You do not really have to follow to much in this movie and it is not conufsing.  Menace II Society is a powerful movie, but there is a little bit of comedy in it too.  The only question I have and this really bothers me is, Why did someone have to come out and make fun of this classic along with Boys N The Hood and other hood movies ?(Juice, SOuth Central)Whenever I talk to someone about Menace II Society, they always say, ""Oh yeah, Don't Be a Menace To South Central?""  And I just shake my head, ""No! Menace II Society!""",1064016000,10,843,4.204968944099379
924869,5,630469623X,"Im am a 14 year old and I want to talk about the Movie Menace II Society. Menace II Society is the tightest Movie I ever saw since ""Boyz N The Hood"" & ""South Central"".It all started out as a young boy name Caine (Tyrin Turner) telling a story about surviving the streets for good. My favorite Scence is When Caine & O-Dog(Larenz Tate) was in the liquor store when these two got evloved in a murder by O-Dog kill the korean grocer and also killed the korean lady while O-Dog threatens to get the video tape from her. In The Movie, They mention O-Dog as ""The American's Worst Nightmare"" and They also mention that O-Dog is Young, Black, And Don't Give A [care]. They also have a cool soundtrack with MC Eith(Streith Up Menace) and all other cool artists. I Recommend this movie to everyone. If U love hood movies and u have not seeen it yet, nows it the time to spend your money and buy this classic. On the internet, they also mention the ""Director's Cut""(which is Unrated and the orignal verison is an R-Rated Movie).So if you Moviegooer and u have not seen that movie yet, now's the time to get that movie. One more thing,The Directors Allen & Albert Hugues(From Hell,Dead Presidents) did an good job on this movie.",1049241600,,1216,4.433035714285714
924870,5,630469623X,"Menace II Society is the story of Caine (Tyrin Turner) a young man living in Watts, Los Angeles. From the very beginning of the movie we follow Caine with an early flashback to his childhood to start . Caines narrative voice is found all throughout this movie. Things start off violent, and never really stop, from beginning to end there is bloodshed, but theres alot more than just violence in this movie, Caine lives a day to day existence, and its only in the end that he realizes whats important to him- Ronnie (Jada Pinkett), her son, his family and living. Other main character is Caines best friend 0-Dog (Larenz Tate) who is young, black and doesnt [care], his presence in movie is really a powerful one, and his lack of conscience contrasts with Caines. Movie also stars  Vonte Sweet, Samuel L. Jackson and Glenn Plummer. Produced by Darin Scott & the Hughes Brothers. Tyrin Turner a still virtually unknown actor is excellent in this movie, and in my opinion deserves alot more credit than he has gotten. To say this movie is just powerful is an understatment, and to compare it to Boyz N the Hood is wrong too. There are some similarities, but Menace II Society is alot darker, and wasn't made to please the masses. Maybe thats why I like it so much, because the story is realistic and the makers don't play down the violence to get mainstream appeal. Would like to talk about some of key scenes but you don't do that when writing a review for people who havnt seen the movie, all I will say is this movie is definetly worth watching, and if your like me and really enjoy it, its worth having in the collection.",1047600000,60,1622,4.517006802721088

924872,5,630469623X,"It seems that there are two distinct camps when it comes to Menace II Society. Those who either love Boys N the Hood and completely hate Menace II Society, and those who love Menace II Society and think that Boys N the Hood is okay or watered down. Unfortunately, the division of these two camps has placed both movies in categories that I don't think are appropriate for either one. Menace is more graphic and violent then BNTH, but both films are equally good.
Menace is a good film. The acting is a bit tried at times. Tyrin Turner is a virtually unknown actor with little under his belt. There were also a lot of unknown actors with very little experience. Yet, there were some extremly noteworthy performances. In particular, Larenz Tate, Jada Smith, and...suprisingly....MC Eight. I had a chance to meet Larenz in college a while back and it is almost hilarious how far removed from the character he actually is.
The storyline is extremely moving and graphic. For those living the life it is predictable. For those unaware of the street life it is shocking.
Overall, the entire movie will have you glued to your seat. I give this movie 5 stars because it moving and true to life.",1038528000,4,1185,4.62085308056872

This movie was very realistic in the fact that young people in our community have extremely short tempers. One bit of criticism that I do have is about the part where Cane (the main character)steals the rims from the guy while in the drive-thru. That type of stuff just doesn't happen around here. But, the drug use and violence is very accurate, I know from experience. A great movie!",1017100800,3,530,4.53125
924958,5,630469623X,"I grew up in the inner city of Washington DC during the 80s and 90s so I'm pretty familiar with inner city poverty and the violence that goes hand in hand with it. Menace II Society is set in the Watts district of South Central LA but it may as well be set in any poor inner city in the US. The film's protagonist is Caine, an 18 year old black kid who has just graduated from high school. His summer vacation gets off to a rough start as he goes to buy a beer with his pal O-Dog and ends up being an accessory to murder after O-Dog kills and robs the Korean merchant. ""Menace"" plays almost like a video. It begins with a random act of unnecessary violence and it ends with a random act of unnecessary violence. In between we get an amazing film that gives us a look into the world of the young poor black men growing up in the inner city and all the obstacles they face both real and percieved. Tyrin TUrner as Caine is a fantastic actor, who gives a very realistic portrayl. IN some parts the film almost looks like a documentary its so realistic! Larenz Tate as O-Dog is incredible! He's ""America's nightmare, young, black and doesn't give a f**k"". The plot is basically just life in South Central LA during a summer. We follow Caine as he explains his upbringing. His father was a drug dealer and his mother a drug user. His father was murdered and his mother overdosed. As a result, Caine lives with his devoutly relgious grandparents who have no control over him. His one role model is in jail. His friends (""homies"") are all small-time criminals looking for their next score. Its a roller-coaster ride of drive-by shootings, car-jackings, and assorted crimes. A great great film which can be watched over and over again. One of the best movies of the 90s and an important piece of American culture.",1013472000,,1805,4.407185628742515

For those of you who never grew up in the ghetto or a run down neighborhood, this movie maybe a little too graphic and extreme. To me this movie was just how people live everyday life. There was tons of action in the movie, right from the start you see about two people die. If your into gang movies or movies about urban teens growing up in rough neighborhoods, this has got to be the movie to own. I've watched this movie over 30 times and it still gives me that same awe effect. Add this to your collection if your not queasy about blood.

Everything was so fake, and you could see the ending coming 10 minutes into the movie. No doubt the story is believable (though you KNEW what was going to happen), but the acting was... well, acting. These guys try to sound tough but they're not. It comes off as very amateur acting. The story line is so-so, but having to sit through these guys reciting their lines just plain kills off whatever's left of the movie. I expected to feel terror looking at these guys, but the whole time I was just thinking, ""Where'd you guys learn to speak like that? Gee, thanks for trying, but really, you should've spent some time listening to how real LA gangsters speak."" This whole movie is so watered down. The only good and realistic part is the opening scene of the shooting in the liquor store. Everything else just goes downhill after that.",1003795200,2,993,4.461538461538462
924963,5,630469623X,"Menace II Society.  An odd name for a movie, you think on initial glimpse.  Why II, and not to?  Who's the menace?  You pick up the box.  There's a picture of two black kids on the front.  OK, you read summary.  It doesn't tell you much.  So, by this point intrigued, you rent it.  Good for you.
Menace starts out in a convience store.  There's confrontation, and soon, two people are dead.  The gunman is smiling and opening the register.  His friend, Kane, screams at him and shivers with panic.  We fade, and begin the story of Kane's life.
If you're the average white person living in America, what you hear in rap music and see on the news must be very distant from you.
Allen and Albert Hughes grapple us with their genius storytelling skills, and quickly, show us what we're so secure not to know.  The daily living, the blood, the drugs, the not caring.  What do these mean?  The main character, Kane, is mixed up in all of it.
To himself, he wants out- way out- of his hoodlum life.  Externally however, he wants in.  He's never shot anybody, he's the clean one.  But he sells drugs.  He knows how to kill someone.  He's been friends with people who have.  Here we see his internal struggle to get out in stunning visual perspective.
The film itself has an expert way about it of opening our eyes to the culture, the environment, the lack of consequences, the police brutality- All of it, while still maintaining assemblence of structure in where it wants to go.
Most of this movie is painful to watch.  Seeing Kane fall down his path of righteousness and commit sins he scoffed his brethren for commiting just days earlier.  Seeing innocent lives be torn by misunderstanding.  Seeing utterly meanless death.  It should hurt to watch- the directors made sure of it- that's why it's so poignant.
The aforementioned sins that Kane commits jump into his future as well.  Every time he has a chance to escape, he's pulled right back into the circle by something he himself did.  As Kane matures and finds his way, the circle flows into it.  It's reminicent of Michael Corleone in The Godfather.
Some other noticible traits of the film- it's incredibly stylistic when it wants to be, but graphically gritty others.  Also, it does a good job of displaying irony- like a scene when Kane and friend walk down the street speaking of how the Bible won't help them- with crosses dangling from their necks.  The use of fades, especially toward the beginning of the film, is well-timed and welcome.
Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe Menace II Society is a worthless piece of garbage about violence far from home.  Maybe we don't need to see it.  But that violence is real- and it's not so far away.  I don't think I'm wrong.  I think, that after this movie is finished, you'll be very glad you rented it.",1002585600,14,2790,4.543259557344064
