3557381,4,B001EUSYIA,"'Wendy and Lucy' is the story of a young woman who, while traveling from Indiana to Alaska in hopes of a new life, gets stranded in Portland, Oregon, and loses her dog, Lucy. It's a timely story of loneliness and sacrifice directed expertly by Kelly Reichardt and acted beautifully by Michelle Williams, whose screen presence is overwhelmingly vulnerable. While many may accuse this film of being too nuanced or too quiet to the point of boredom, I implore you to see it for yourself. It's not like this is a silent film. There is dialogue, and it isn't even sparse. Whenever there is no dialogue, the film is still involving all the way up to its heartbreaking final scene. I honestly had no expectations going into this film. I like Michelle Williams and thought it'd be an interesting film to say the least. I was wrong-so wrong-it's way more than that. There hasn't been a film that has made me sob, not just tear up but sob like a baby, in a LONG time, maybe ever. This is one film that will stay with you long after it ends.
So, do you have one hour and fifteen minutes? I know you do. Do yourself a favor and experience 'Wendy and Lucy.'",1241568000,8,1144,4.42654028436019
3557382,4,B001EUSYIA,"Travelling to Alaska to find work, Wendy (Michelle Williams) finds herself stranded in Portland with a broken down car.  While trying to get her car fixed, she experiences further mishaps, including losing her beloved dog, Lucy.  Indie director Kelly Reichardt wisely tells this simple story in a straight-forward, unadorned manner.  The minimal dialogue means that most of the story is told through Williams' expressive face; indeed, Williams is the entire show.  With short hair and no makeup, the normally glamorous actress convincingly pulls off the role of the homeless young woman.  Her sorrowful eyes and pixie-ish features show us all we need to know about the character.  Williams received several award nominations, including Best Female Lead from the Independent Spirit Awards (she lost to Melissa Leo in ""Frozen River).  Although some people may find the plot boring, lovers of indie cinema are likely to find more here to appreciate.

My reviews are usually much longer, but I think the length of this review is appropriate for ""Wendy and Lucy.""",1241568000,,1058,5.218934911242603
3557383,3,B001EUSYIA,"This is the other movie I watched on the plane ride (on a double feature with Nick and Norah). Wonderfully depressing movie, about a aimless loner with no money, no job and no personality. I had a hard time feeling empathy for the lead character, which means I had hard time liking this film. Michelle Williams does a terrific job conveying the desperation and loneliness of Wendy's life, and her minimilist acting is pitch-perfect for the role. I wish I could swap her out with Jolie in the 'Changeling' - one is a great movie with a decent actress, while this is a mediocre film with a great performance.",1238198400,6,606,4.568807339449541
3557384,5,B001EUSYIA,"'Wendy and Lucy' is not just a film about a young woman who loses her dog. Kelly Reichardt's film explores Wendy as anyone you know who is living paycheck to paycheck, or who loses their job. One thing goes wrong and you're living in your car. If you don't happen to have a family support system, what do you do? There are so many ""Wendy's"" out there, and especially in these economic times. But, what makes 'Wendy and Lucy' so special is the way it unfolds at its deliberate, mesmerizing pace. Each shot is chosen carefully. Every nuance of Michelle Williams' terrific performance is carefully modulated. What you end up with is a rare film that manages to be both nuanced and spare, both profound and simple, both emotional and engaging. Definitely a must see!",1237852800,2,762,4.651851851851852
3557385,1,B001EUSYIA,"I had the misfortune of seeing this film last night.  I really loved Old Joy, but after seeing this movie with my girlfriend I had to apologize to her for taking us to see it.  It is truly awful.  Oldham's in it for about 60 seconds, and his part is just silly.  The rest of the movie has the simplest of storylines, and a main character about whom we know nothing and care even less.

While Old Joy was a fantastic, easy going exploration into middle class American friendship during the Bush era, Wendy and Lucy is worse than watching an unemployment queue for an hour and twenty minutes.  At least the unemployment queue is full of people trying to get work, rather than endlessly wallowing in self-pity.  Great films this year like Frozen River or The Wrestler maturely handle American poverty issues with much greater respect, sympathy and realism, while this film seems content letting its main character beat her head against a wall for 80 minutes doing nothing to improve her situation.

Everything I liked about Old Joy was completely absent.",1237334400,9,1051,4.704918032786885
3557386,1,B001EUSYIA,"SPOILER ALERT: ""Luuuucy!  Where are you?  Luuucy!  Come here, girl!""  There, now you don't need to bother watching this movie (unless you are a total dog fanatic).  Wendy travels across country with her dog, Lucy; loses Lucy; spends the next hour of the film hunting for Lucy; finally finds her; and then decides to hop on a train and leave her behind.  Whaaat?  Boring and pointless.",1235952000,9,384,4.7272727272727275
3557387,5,B001EUSYIA,"Michelle Williams delivers a very understated performance as a down-on-her-luck Wendy, who brings her loyal dog, Lucy, along with her to a journey for a supposed prosperity. It is a very quiet and subtle performance that, Wendy, with little money and no dog food, and an incident which prompts her to lose Lucy, meshes along with her surroundings: a dry and monotone small town, where the sun shines to merely beat down the lumbering, sluggish skins of the inhabitants. This is a very important work, especially in light of today's economic situation: ""You need an address to get an address, and you need a job to get a job."" succinctly says the kind-hearted security guard who provides help to Wendy during her descent into financial and emotional ruins. ""Wendy and Lucy"", directed by Kelly Reichardt, emphasizes the many possibilities that are available to an individual by virtue of how everything could be wiped away by being in a little mishap that triggers a chain of unfortunate events, each worse than the previous ones. The dire circumstances that Wendy finds herself in may not be grandiose or explosive, but her plight is all the more heartbreaking and terrifying: just a few more dollars for a bag of dog food for Lucy would have made all the difference. Along with ""The Wrestler"", though this one is on a simpler and quieter scale, ""Wendy and Lucy"" is visual poetry that examines a broken and fragile character that perseveres through life's many disappointments. Very ethereal and melancholic; it is simply beautiful.",1235952000,44,1531,4.961089494163424
3557388,3,B001EUSYIA,"At 80 minutes long, this has got to be the shortest movie not actually called a short film I have ever seen. I found myself wishing for a bit more (or any) backstory. We find Wendy and Lucy in a park in a nameless town in Oregon. We soon find out that Wendy is from Indiana and is on her way to Alaska in hopes of finding a job. She and Lucy are living out of her car, an old honda accord, and are on an extremely tight budget. Wendy has just a few hundred dollars to her name, and it is going fast. Things go from bad to worse very quickly, and worst of all, Lucy goes missing. The bulk of the movie deals with Wendy trying to get things back on track and find her dog, who she clearly loves.
 This is a very understated movie to say the least. There is virtually no soundtrack, unless you call Wendy's humming to herself a soundtrack. It feels almost like a documentary, I think director Reichardt was going for simplicity and realism over sentimentality, maybe too much so. It is beautifully shot, however, and has a few moments that go by quickly but are worth appreciating. This is obviously not a high-budget movie where things explode and gorgeous people say carefully scripted things. It is a very simple tale of a young woman on the fringe of society, someone you might well ignore or fail to notice if you encountered them in real life. Michelle Williams gives a fine performance as Wendy, and though Reichardt seems to almost deliberately avoid trying to make you care about what happens to her and Lucy, you may just find that, by the end of the film, you do.",1235347200,7,1571,4.3254237288135595
3557389,4,B001EUSYIA,"Let me first say after I saw this film, I had to think about it and digest what was going on, before I knew what I thought about it.  My initial reaction was a feeling of indifference.  I liked and didn't like the characters.  More later.  ""Wendy and Lucy"" is a slow-moving, character-study film.  IT REQUIRES PATIENCE.  There's not a heck of a lot of dialogue so you have to read between the lines.  It's simple and spare storytelling--much like in the style of Hemingway.  It's essentially about a girl who is trying to find her American Dream in Alaska.  She feels once she gets there, her life will get better.  She reminded me of the guy in ""Into the Wild"" and Tom Joad in ""The Grapes of Wrath.""  However, this is not a road movie.  The whole film takes place in a suburb of Portland, Oregon.  She has one mishap happen after another: her car breaks down, she gets arrested for shoplifting, she loses her dog--you get the picture.  For the greater part of the film, she is searching for her dog.  This may wear on the patience of some viewers.  Hang in there.  All I can say is this film is not about what happens at the end but rather--how it gets there.  Appreciate and understand how Wendy reacts and behaves because I think that is the key to understanding the film.  Now let me talk about my feelings of indifference to the characters.  At first I thought the security guard at Walgreen's was a jerk because he was sorta like ""evicting"" Wendy from the parking lot.  I thought, what harm was she doing sleeping in her car in the parking lot?  It wasn't as if they needed her parking space because there were a sleuth of cars waiting around the corner.  But then he tried to help her find her dog and I thought differently of him.  The same thing goes for the auto mechanic.  At first I thought he was trying to rip her off, but then he proposed a more than fair deal to her regarding her car.  I even felt indifferent to Wendy.  I thought she was kinda stupid to sleep alone in a deserted park at night.  Wasn't she afraid of some crazy people coming up to her?  And sure enough--someone did.  But then I saw other signs of her that showed how responsible she was, such as keeping track of how much money she spent, etc.  So what did I think of this movie?  I liked it very much.  It is one of the best films of the year, and Michelle Williams turns in one of her best performances to date.  She should win the Oscar for Best Actress.  She is the main reason why I liked this film so much.  The Wendy character is a complex role.  She has shades of being a hippie from the '60s: independent and free-spirited.  Yet, she's also practical and resourceful like someone from the Great Depression.  I liked how there was a ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" side to Wendy.  Is the director foreshadowing our President-elect in light of his recent nominations for his Cabinet?",1230336000,15,2873,4.367424242424242
3557390,4,B001EUSYIA,"When a story is referred to as a Slice of Life, I usually take it with a grain of salt because the term is often used so generically. What exactly does Slice of Life mean? I think it means that the story is simple, direct, and realistically represented, with very little attention given to dramatic enhancements. ""Wendy and Lucy"" works on those levels, so I guess calling it a Slice of Life film would be accurate. What intrigues me is that it's a deeply heartfelt movie that doesn't beat you over the head with obvious heartfelt elements; there are no tragic death scenes or lovelorn pleas, nor is there a sweeping musical score that's mostly made up of strings. It's a character study that intentionally reveals as little as possible; director/co-writer Kelly Reichardt wisely chose to let the course of events speak for the characters. It's relies on small, quiet moments of drama rather than a series of contrived, overblown occurrences.

On the surface, there isn't much to analyze or even describe. Wendy (Michelle Williams) has left her home in Indiana to find work all the way up in Alaska. After her car breaks down in the middle of Oregon, she loses her beloved dog, Lucy, a loyal Golden Retriever mix. She then spends the rest of the film trying to find Lucy, all the while having to deal with a dwindling cash supply, which wasn't all that large to begin with.

I'm reminded of an episode of ""The Jack Benny Program"" in which Benny appeared on a panel show with two other people. The host asked them about the significance of Ernest Hemingway's ""The Old Man and the Sea."" The two guests felt that the story was a profound example of man's struggle against nature. Benny felt that it was just about an old man that went fishing. Some will see ""Wendy and Lucy"" and think it's just about a girl and her dog. Maybe it is, although I tend to doubt it. Wendy is a character I cared deeply about, and this is despite the fact that I knew virtually nothing about her. Somehow, I don't think I'd be able to care if the plot was the extent of the film's depth; there must have been something lying beneath the layers, something that allowed me to look past the stark, subdued nature of the story.

That being said, I'm not sure what that something is. Maybe it's a simple matter of not wanting to see Wendy lost and alone in such a lifeless town, where people speak to her in as few words as possible. Then again, it's quite possible that she was lost and alone to begin with; the circumstances that led to her leaving Indiana are never discussed, but a brief conversation with her sister and her sister's husband hints that she was never close to them. It could also be that the town itself is symbolic of the dead zone in her life. I'm speculating, of course, although there's evidence to support it. Consider the fact that she can't bring herself to spend her money on simple things like a motel room; she would rather sleep in her car and freshen herself in the bathroom of mechanic's garage. It's one thing to save your money--it's another thing to deny yourself access to basic amenities.

Most of the people Wendy runs into are lethargic, monotone, and dull, the unfortunate products of the town they grew up in. When Wendy is busted for shoplifting, even the stocker didn't sound convinced by his own assertion that the store has to set an example. She then meets the local mechanic (Will Patton), who's not interested in her car troubles and gives her the usual spiel about how much such and such a part will cost her. He pauses to take a call from his bookie, and even then, he sounds detached. Wendy also encounters a homeless man when she makes the mistake of deciding to sleep in the woods; it was hard to see him in the darkness, although I heard every word of his truthful but frightening speech about why he hates people.

There is, in fact, only one character that Wendy gets along with: An old, lonely security guard who never tells Wendy his name (Wally Dalton). While he doesn't do much in the way of getting to know her, he's compelled to help her out by letting her use his cell phone for periodic calls to the local dog pound. This may or may not be the film's only attempt at contrived drama. The reason I'm not sure is because the security guard is, in most respects, just as dead inside as everyone else living in that town; he stands alone outside a building that no one ever seems to go into, so it's possible he sees Wendy only as someone to talk to. Then again, would someone in need of human contact even consider lending out his cell phone? From my point of view, that seems like an actual friendly gesture.

It would seem that a lot of ""Wendy and Lucy"" is open to interpretation. The only clear aspect is the relationship between the title characters, which is the sole driving force of the plot. But does there need to be anything more? After all, the film does have a definite beginning, middle, and end, and this is despite the fact that there's so little emphasis on character development or even basic narrative exposition. And somehow, we're made to care for Wendy, a troubled young woman who only wanted to get to Alaska with her dog. The fact that we don't know where she came from or where she'll end up may not be all that satisfying, but hey, that's what you get from a Slice of Life.",1229385600,6,5330,4.4727646454265155

3557394,3,B001EUSYIA,"The movie is a bit dark and seemed to end prematurely. The film quality was a little grainy and the camera had long spans of little to no movement, witch gave the sensation of ominous style, as if something was going to jump out and scare the watcher. And then, surprisingly, the movie abruptly ended.

If you are after a movie that leaves you with a feel-good sensation, this will not be a good option for you... there is no resolution to the movie's plotline and in all, it was a bit vanilla.

3557397,5,B001EUSYIA,"A wonderful movie, fueled by a very good performance by Michelle Williams. The film sometimes has the feel of an academic project, but consistently rises above pat conclusions and easy solutions. Emotionally full, Wendy's character is revealed slowly, with great empathy. The supporting cast is solid. There is a moment int the middle of the film, when fears and night terrors are realized, and Michelle's amazing work as a very young actress in this scene is nothing short of breathtaking.

3557401,2,B001EUSYIA,"If you're like me, you found out about this film after seeing ""Old Joy.""  This is not ""Old Joy.""  Same director, same snail's pace, but this time director Kelly Reichardt gives us very little to care about.  We care about Wendy's lovable Golden Retriever, Lucy, but not about Wendy.  In fact, in the end, Wendy doesn't care about Lucy either, but I'm getting ahead of the story.

 First, about Wendy.  Wendy is on her way to Alaska to get a job in a canning factory.  Why she has to go to Alaska to get a job is never revealed.  She's short of money, she was informed prior to the trip that  her car had a problem, and when her car does break down in a small Oregon town, she's without transportation, or a place to sleep.  Yes, she sleeps in her car.  She gets caught shoplifting dog food to feed her dog, gets fingerprinted by the local police, is fined $50, and when she returns to the store discovers Lucy has run off.  She blames the stock boy for catching her stealing, as do a number of people who have reviewed this film.  That's beside the point.  She shouldn't have been shoplifting in the first place.  Later, she decides to sleep outside in a secluded wooded area near the railroad tracks where no person in their right mind--man or woman--would choose to sleep, but she does.  A homeless guy wakens her with his rambling speech.  She escapes, frightened and tearful, lucky not to be raped--or killed.

 Wendy decides to let her car be scrapped because she doesn't have the money to fix it.  Prior to leaving, she decides to leave Lucy in the yard of the people who found her and have been caring for her.  She tells Lucy she will return to get her when she has more money, but she doesn't bother to tell the people who are caring for her.  Who knows what will become of Lucy in the interim?  And, do we really believe Wendy will ever return?

 Bottom line: Wendy makes a number of bad decisions, beginning with her decision to go to Alaska.  Do we really sympathize with her predicament?  Do we really care?  I don't think so.

 Michelle Williams is absolutely believable as naive, hapless Wendy, and, of course, Lucy is adorable as she was in ""Old Joy.""  Great cast, bad script.",1396483200,,2192,4.416040100250626

3557407,5,B001EUSYIA,"Sometimes a story's simplicity can be interpreted different ways, one of the fascinating aspects of Kelly Reichardt's 2008 indie film ""Wendy and Lucy."" Moving with the minimal, unpolished pace of life, the film follows the young woman Wendy on the road to Alaska. She stops in small-town Oregon and soon becomes stranded by a series of Dickensian misfortunes. Wendy is played by Michelle Williams, and compare this performance to her 2012 turn as Marilyn Monroe in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Week-With-Marilyn/dp/B0076NKLRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Week With Marilyn</a>&nbsp;for an idea as to her enormous range. Wendy's travel companion is her dog Lucy, a yellow-haired mutt as loyal as the best of pets.

The film opens as they hover near a railroad track campfire where an assortment of youths adorned in tattoos and piercings smoke marijuana, kick cans and participate in the timeless habits of the homeless. Wendy, tentative and wary, is separate from them, mainly because she has a destination and car. But as the film shows, she's not separated by much. She counts her dwindling money and sighs deeply. As anyone who has driven to Alaska knows, Oregon is a long way from the 50th state, and gas these days is anything but cheap.

Wendy falls asleep in her car to be awakened by the window-tap of a flashlight. She wipes sleep from her eyes and a security guard says simply, ""You can't sleep here."" She attempts to start her car but it will not turn over. The security guard then replies, ""You can't park here."" Wendy, out of dog food and confronted with a stranded car, makes the fateful choice to steal from a grocery store. Thus begins her struggles as she is arrested, is separated from her dog and attempts to have her car repaired.

Reichardt is one of the more fascinating talents of recent times. ""Wendy and Lucy"" was preceded by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Old-Joy/dp/B000N2HDG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Old Joy</a>&nbsp;and followed by the haunting pioneer saga&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meek-s-Cutoff/dp/B006C599FE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meek's Cutoff</a>. Her films are connected by a unique vision of desperate souls searching for hope within an isolated world. Wendy's stage is an overcast town (filmed in Wilsonville, Oregon) suffering through financial depression, where the local ""mill"" has closed and residents stumble through a passionless grind. There's little empathy to be found within the quiet horrors of Reichardt's modern America. Grocery store clerks relish Wendy's arrest, police officers ignore her pleas about Lucy and local mechanics attempt to charge $50 to tow a car less than a block away. Each roadblock is instantly identifiable.

Everywhere Wendy treads she's engulfed by cars speeding past like so many beetles. She brushes her teeth in weathered gas stations. When walking on empty sidewalks (usually searching for Lucy) she passes numerous parking lots. The security guard (well played by unknown Wally Dalton) quietly stands watch over the parking lot in front of Walgreen's. What exactly is he guarding? She strolls through the local pound in search of Lucy, passing endless tiled cells where listless dogs bark and pace, hours from doom. With a few subtle strokes, what ""Wendy and Lucy"" details is systems of rigid control, ensnaring unlucky souls without the protection of cars or money. A harmless girl and her dog have barely a chance.

I was once traveling cross-country by car and had been on the highway for 12 hours. I pulled off on a service road in pitch black darkness to sleep somewhere in Colorado. I too was awakened by the tap of a flashlight. A young police officer searched my car, shined the light in my eyes and checked my license. Chagrined after 20 minutes of fruitless nothing, he told me there was a truck stop 10 miles down the road where I could sleep. It didn't matter where I was at that moment was complete desolation.

3557411,5,B001EUSYIA,"This little film about a wayward traveler captures its character in such a realistic light, it is sometimes hard to accept that this story is entirely fictional. A large part of this film's success is the astonishing performance from Michelle Williams - onscreen nearly the entire time, Williams gives a subtle, emotionally profound performance. It is possibly her best-ever. This film is worth seeing just for her, but the story itself is rich and moving, and may even move some viewers to tears, even if they say they don't cry at movies. This is minimalism done right.",1353888000,,571,4.896907216494846
3557412,4,B001EUSYIA,"""Wendy And Lucy"" has a simple story that's not to be confused with simplistic.  Girl has dog.  Girl loses dog.  Does girl get dog back or not?  That's the whole skinny of it.  If one is looking for any hidden metaphors other than life is hard then they were totally lost on me.  The movie is compelling and economic in telling its story in eighty minutes.  Michelle Williams demonstrates here in her performance as a young drifter who has little else but her beloved pooch why she is one of our best actresses working today.  She utilizes few tricks in portraying a desperate girl who is stranded in the middle of nowhere with a broken down car and little money.  I recommend this film with few reservations but it is a little too basic for me to give it the full five star treatment.",1349395200,2,784,4.388888888888889
3557413,3,B001EUSYIA,"<strong>Wendy and Lucy</strong> (Kelly Reichardt, 2008)

So it seems like everyone I know went wildly in love with <em>Wendy and Lucy</em> at some point in the past three years. They're not the only ones; the movie has an impressive 84% rating on Rotten Tomatoes as I write this. In the face of such blinding opposition, I will say from the outset that I can't be sure my main criticism of this film is something that's actually there or something I'm reading into it, and that probably hinges on the answer to a single question. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Plot: Wendy (<em>Brokeback Mountain</em>'s Michelle Williams) and her dog Lucy are on a cross-country trip in a ramshackle car to Alaska, where Wendy is hoping to get a job (or a job is waiting for her). She makes it as far as Oregon when her car breaks down. She's already economizing something fierce, but it seems that if she shifts a few things, she should be able to cover the cost of repairs. After dropping her car off at the garage, she takes Lucy over to the local grocery store, ties her to a post outside (since dogs are not allowed in), then conducts a ham-fisted shoplifting attempt that gets her detained--during which Lucy is taken to the local pound. The rest of the movie details Wendy's quest to recover her dog.

And here's the question: what was Kelly Reichardt's intention with Wendy's character? How I feel about the entire first hour of this movie hinges on that question. If we are supposed to be seeing ""Wendy made her bed, and now she has to lie in it,"" that's all well and good, and you've got a mediocre, if well-shot, slice-of-life drama. But there are indicators that this is not the case. The largest of them is Larry Fessenden's cameo, which steers the movie in a somewhat different direction (and is the movie's first truly striking scene, which adds to the <em>gravitas</em>): it's the first point at which something happens to Wendy that is entirely out of her control, and it's here that it crystallized--perhaps erroneously--in my head that Reichardt does <em>not</em> want us to see Wendy as a character who is making increasingly bad choices and is being forced to live with the consequences, but wants to show her as some sort of indie/counterculture/hipster antihero archetype. And if that is truly the case, the first hour of this movie is loathsome, patently offensive, and no longer justifies the final fifteen minutes, which are a great deal better (and during which Wendy finally makes the single logical, objectively-right choice she makes during the entire course of the movie).

Your call; I'm giving it the gentleman's C. ** ",1347321600,2,2639,4.765864332603939
3557414,3,B001EUSYIA,"""Wendy and Lucy"" is one of those films that has a more interesting backstory than plot. Michelle Williams, fresh off her Oscar-nomination for ""Brokeback Mountain"" and newly broken up with Heath Ledger, came to Portland, Oregon to make this film and lived unrecognized for months. She pulled this off because she looks much more like a Portland Street Angel than say, Keanu Reeves did in ""My Own Private Idaho."" Filmed in the seedy SE part of Portland, ""Wendy and Lucy"" follows Williams as she suffers one misfortune after another on her way to find a better life in Alaska. In the process, she is seperated from her pup Lucy and spends the majority of the film looking for her. If you are a dog lover, as I am, you will feel a connection, but there isn't much else here. Williams is fine, but the one-dimensional focus of the script doesn't allow her much range. Animal lovers will be better served with Art Carney's Oscar-winning performance in ""Harry and Tonto.""",1346630400,3,964,4.710059171597633
3557415,4,B001EUSYIA,"It's not a movie for everyone...because it makes you look at yourself and how you view/JUDGE people and for some that's not Pretty.

The girl is hard on her luck and trying to get somewhere to improve things when EVERYTHING goes WRONG.
Her car breaks down.
She's low on money.
Her dog gets lost.
She ends up going hungry and sleeping in the woods and totally dependent on the kindness of strangers. In our current world, ""the kindness of strangers"" is RARE...
She's really just a KID and doing the best she CAN and Fate seems to bash her at every turn, no matter how brave she is.
I cried several times watching it because it broke my heart to watch the struggle...but I cried watching Dances With Wolves and Tim Burton's 9.  Just because something is DARK and SAD that doesn't lessen its merit or make it less worth watching.

Beautifully acted, well written, well directed.  You get a sense of WHO Wendy IS within the first 10 minutes of the movie and YES your heart bleeds for her the rest of the film.
Maybe the bad reviews are because THIS is becoming increasingly common in our society and it's just too ugly to think about.  We are no longer
The Land of Opportunity but are looking more and more like we did during The Great Depression.

3557416,5,B001EUSYIA,"Wendy and Lucy is quite the sad movie.  It's sad because it shows you a very simple and easy to comprehend story concerning a young woman who's homeless, living in her car that happens to break down in a small town in the middle of nowhere, and doing whatever it takes just to get by from day to day.

Wendy's dog means absolutely everything to her.  One day during a shoplifting incident, she goes to jail and upon returning to the supermarket discovers that her dog is missing.  She calls out for her dog but much to Wendy's disappointment, she's nowhere to be found.  The question then becomes, what happened to the dog and will Wendy ever see Lucy again?

The film is a devastatingly realistic outlook on the life of a homeless person and the many struggles such a person has to endure every single day of their life.  The entire setting takes place in a small town, and focuses around only a few characters (besides Wendy- including a security guard and a mechanic).

That's all the film honestly *needs*.  It tells such a touching story and the simplicity of the plot development is simply RIGHT on the money and easy to fall in love with.  You really feel for Wendy's character.  She's someone you just want to go out of your way to help because you're able to witness how her world is falling apart around her, and as a viewer, I was sitting there really wishing I could reach out to this girl.  That's how you know when you're completely caught up in a storyline- when you feel like you can connect to the characters on screen.

Overall, some may dislike the simplistic nature of the film, but I personally have yet to see a terrible film that tells such a short and sweet story, and if there's a special category for such films, surely Wendy and Lucy deserves to be at the top of the list in quality and overall enjoyment.  Simplicity wins again.",1315872000,3,1856,4.452662721893491
3557417,4,B001EUSYIA,"Kelly Reichardt has a penchant for uncovering simple moments in the lives of seemingly insignificant people, treating them for just what they are - life in the ordinary lane of living when something goes awry and makes us notice (Old Joy, River of Grass, Ode, Then a Year, Travis).  As in the highly regarded 'Old Joy' this film was based on a short story by Jonathan Raymond who aided Reichardt in adapting it for the screen. The theme of this and other Reichardt films is the breakdown that occurs when something unsuspected disrupts the quiet lives of quiet people. it is not an epic drama: it is a closely observed moment in time to which everyone who is sensitive can relate.

Wendy (Michelle Williams) is a young woman about whom we know very little: she is driving her old car from Indiana to Alaska in search of a job in the fisheries to survive. She is alone in the world, except for her faithful dog Lucy, and the degree of mutual love is palpable.  Wendy's car breaks down in a little town in Oregon, she is discovered sleeping in her car with Lucy by an elderly  security guard (Wally Dalton) who sympathizes with Wendy's plight, suggests an auto repair shop run by a trustworthy mechanic (Will Patton), and recommends a good store where she can buy food for Lucy and for herself.  Following the Security Guards advice she gets a quote from the mechanic (too high, but she must salvage her car), goes to the little store where she ties Lucy to the outside bike rack and enters the store: she shoplifts some food for Lucy and is caught by a cold and rigid young man Andy (John Robinson) and is turned over to the police.  Jailed for a while, she returns to the store to get Lucy, but Lucy is gone.  Wendy's money is dwindling, she has no car, she has no place to sleep and she has lost her beloved Lucy.  The security guard directs her to the humane society pound, offers her the use of his cell phone, but there have been no reports about her dog. Distraught, she makes little signs to place around the town about her lost Lucy, then settles to sleep by the train tracks, but is awakened by a psychotic hobo.  At dawn she returns to the store where she lost Lucy, meets the security guard who informs her that there was a call from the pound during the night about Lucy.  The security guard gives her some cash out of friendship and Wendy is off to the pound to claim Lucy, only to discover that Lucy is now in a foster home.  Wendy visits the address where Lucy is now living, sees that Lucy now has a big yard and food, and makes a difficult decision that proves her devotion to her dog.

One of the themes in this tender film is the importance of the kindness of strangers wiling to look beyond appearances and see the needs of their fellowmen. Yes, there are some flaws in the story - we know too little about Wendy's past and must rely on her current behavior to figure her out, behavior that doesn't always seem reasonable - but making sweeping judgments does to seem to be part of Reichardt's purpose. This is a simple moment, a story that might go unnoticed, and the performance by Michelle Williams glows.  Grady Harp, August 10",1281744000,3,3149,4.417962003454232

3557419,5,B001EUSYIA,"Wendy and Lucy is an intimate look into the life of Wendy, even if it is just for a brief moment. We don't hear about the background story, and we don't find out what happens in her future, but we see a small moment of her life in the present.

The movie itself seemed very realistic, which is rare in movies. The story seemed to have truth behind it and nothing was glamorized. By watching it, it felt as if I was experiencing everything that Wendy was experiencing but through my eyes rather than through my actions. The relationship between Wendy and her dog seems as if Lucy really is Wendy's only friend, so the feelings that Wendy feels towards Lucy is easily transferred to the viewer.

It was a brutally honest and true look at being poor and lonely. Michelle Williams did a fantastic job portraying Wendy. Much of the movie was based on her facial expressions and emotions since it was mainly her being alone or interacting with her dog, Lucy.

I'd recommend watching the film to experience the simple, yet engaging story.",1276646400,,1031,4.562162162162162
3557420,5,B001EUSYIA,"She is a drifter with a dog in a car, from Indiana heading for Alaskan work,whose car breaks down in Wilsonville, Oregon. She gets done for shoplifting, and loses her dog. She sleeps rough when not in her car. She carefully budgets what money she has left, about $500. She has two main contacts here, the mechanic(Will Patton), and the elderly guard who watches the car park at the store back..The story is sensitively rendered, and Wendy is an undemonstrative, goodly soul, whose family are portrayed as indifferent to her plight, when she calls them. Her relationship with her dog, Lucy, is the closest she has. We see them in various scenes in the woods or in town together. This performance by Michelle Williams,shows a fragility of character, is subtle and understated. She finds the limits of the world she lives in, between the poles of the uppity store clerk, who thinks she should be made an example of(he wears a cross), and the kindly old guard,who loans her his mobile to call the dog pound (Dalton). This is a story about the marginalised, unemployed, without home or job, whose identity is almost non-existent, and is dependent upon the kindness of strangers. There are scenes of moving stock and train carriages, winding railway lines, and shots of graffiti on the sides of buildings, with finely restrained cinematography. Her car is too expensive to fix, and she finds her dog has been adopted by a good person with a yard. She realizes she has to make sacrifices. This film has the barest of outlines of a plot, and the majority of it occurs stranded in a small north western, Pacific, town where there are no jobs. Williams underplays to bring out the realism of the world she inhabits. Although I found it strange for a young girl travelling in a car, without a mobile phone, I believed in her character. Reichardt has taken a leaf out of Rosetta and Not One Less, world films of grim realism,that work on a thin trail of hope and exploration. Thank God, Hollywood didn't get hold of this:pumped-up scenario,sex and sentimentality. A good film not made from a European original.",1272153600,,2098,4.750684931506849

But if you can appreciate an understated, poignant indictment of the alienation caused by deprivation you should find yourself gripped from start to finish. All but the truly unsympathetic will want Wendy to rise above her desperate situation, and will root for her wholeheartedly.

3557423,2,B001EUSYIA,"If you don't feel like slitting your wrists before watching this film, afterward you certainly will. And I don't say that in the sense that WENDY AND LUCY was purely a bad film, because some areas were okay. It's just that the story is so downright depressing that I felt I needed a Prozac the size of a football after viewing it.

I'm a fairly big Indie film fan, so I felt obligated to watch this ""American Film Institute Best Picture Winner of 2009."" Multiple film critics hailed it as ""a stunning achievement.""

Really?

Stunning?

Maybe I'm losing my grip on film as a medium, but I found nothing in the film ""stunning."" In fact, it is so ordinary, the story so plain, the events so ...uneventful, that I was hard-pressed to keep my eyelids from forcing themselves shut.

But all was not lost. Michelle Williams (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Land-of-Plenty/dp/B000HC2M20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Land of Plenty</a>) plays the part of a homeless vagabond quite well. Her situation is pitiful, if not acutely accurate in today's struggling times. Williams is the only ray of success in what is otherwise a purely nowhere script. The only exception to this would be her experience of having to sleep in the woods and being presented with the possibility of rape or injury at the hands of a delusional man; the only tension in this otherwise relentlessly boring story.

Even the dog seemed to just be going through the motions, being told what to do, when to hit her cue, when to bark.

Most people go to the movies as a form of escapism. They want to be transported to another realm, another time, or, at the very least, into someone's interesting life. I know. I know. Some film makers want to show us ""the real world."" But we LIVE in the real world. Why would we want to experience something that we see or live everyday? The simple answer is, ""We don't."" And this is where Wendy and Lucy let me down. There was so much of ordinary life in here that it made the entire film unremarkable.

I'm not saying lives can't be made interesting. Take a look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Wild/dp/B001GMH8SI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Wild</a>and you'll see what I mean. And that's just one example. But watching a car break down, a girl make phone calls, and befriend an old security guard just aren't things that appeal to me. Yes, there's more to Wendy and Lucy than that (the dog, Wendy's struggle to get her back only to realize she can't get her back, etc.), but the progression of how all this happens is, again, exceptionally boring.

I'm still an Indie film fan, and probably will be until the day I die, but I won't be a fan of this flick.",1262476800,6,2752,4.926565874730022
3557424,4,B001EUSYIA,"Wendy is old enough to be on her own, but not yet wise enough to manage things alone. She's got a plan, to find work in Alaska, but doesn't have a clue what to do if things don't work out as she expects. Her car breaks down, and she can't afford to get it fixed. She makes a series of bad decisions, but things really break down for her when she loses her dog, Lucy, her companion, her friend, her security, the only one she really trusts.

Kelly Reichard's second film is grimmer than her first, but maybe even more assured in the simplicity of its style, and in the muted beauty of the landscape against overcast skies, and in the remarkably immersed performance of Michelle Williams. In Old Joy, it was nostalgia for lost friendship, the feeling of growing old and being too late. In Wendy and Lucy there is a deeper malaise, almost despair, over the loss of possibility, the grim economic realities facing a young woman who, for whatever reason, can't go home and wouldn't find welcome there if she did. She knows, moreover, that she is not alone in being alone, without help or hope, without much trust in anything. Jobs are scarce everywhere, and even if she finds her dog she can't say whether she can care for her. If Old Joy was about the fading away of the past, Wendy and Lucy is about the uncertainties of the future. Still, in spite of some hesitation, the film takes and reworks a classic American theme, of traveling West, to the frontier, in the hopes of making ends meet and getting away from it all to remake oneself.

It's a simple film, told simply and authentically, about people who are neither simply bad nor good, but getting by as best they can, and reminding us that the line between well enough and desperate is not so far these days, that sometimes all it takes is an accident or mistake, and dreams and plans are no longer enough. Then you have to make hard choices in order to carry on. A very nice work from an important and distinctive voice in American independent cinema.",1261958400,,2005,4.460490463215259
3557425,5,B001EUSYIA,"I have some difficulty understanding those who characterize this film as ""boring"" or say that it ""lacks a plot.""

I will not restate the plot others have detailed so well here. WENDY AND LUCY is the right film at the right time in our collective lives. It's a sensitive, heartfelt study of the ways in which others help or dismiss us when we face struggle or failure.  It's also a tribute to the four-legged creatures who stand by us when others reject us. Michelle Williams' superb performance -- as a young woman on her way to find hope and work in Alaska with her dog, Lucy -- runs the gamut from stoic to grief-stricken as she survives the very worst in life.

Wendy is resilient in a manner both ideal and human. Her ability to withstand the selfishness of modern America is inspiring and wrenching.  Her inner struggles with the lapse of brotherhood/sisterhood becomes evident as, each day, she washes her face and stares at herself in restroom mirrors during her bout with homelessness. The movie is also mythic because it describes the process each of us confronts as we age, as we fail at times and attempt to recover our footing.

All is not lost in Wendy's life, though. The friendship of one human character is redemptive and life-affirming. That, and the ultimate love she shows Lucy in an unforgettable segment of the film, are hope-giving.

This movie rose to my top-25 after one viewing. Despite its low-budget feel, it has gorgeous cinematography and sound, and one could not better Michelle Williams' unearthly performance. While my DVD copy had intermittent lines running through the frame, the issue didn't impact my enjoyment for a second.

Half way through, I became aware of the lack of music, and how that magnified the action.  I wanted to stop watching at many points, knowing that Wendy's mistakes were going to catch up to her, but I couldn't turn away.  I could easily see those sorts of things happening to me if I got on the wrong track one day and didn't have a support system to help me get right.

Although this story is about Wendy, it tells how important her dog Lucy is to her, so I wish the camera had spent more time with Lucy.  I know it was the absence of Lucy that drives the story, but still....

As a volunteer working for the Missing Pet Partnership, I found it difficult to watch all the things Wendy did wrong before and after she lost Lucy.  I kept wanting to yell at her through the screen, ""Don't do that!""  Judging this movie not on its artistic merits but on its demonstration of how to retrieve your lost dog, I give Wendy a 10 for desire but a 3 for her methods.  I would be just as bereft as Wendy was, if I'd lost any of my three dogs, which is why I've taken many redundant measures to make sure it never happens.  If you do lose your dog, check out the many good tips at the Missing Pet Partnership rather than following Wendy's example.

I still can't decide if I liked this movie.  It was compelling and beautiful, but sometimes just too horrible to watch for someone who loves dogs as much as I do.

Movie watchers addicted to action and Hollywood glamour will not have the patience for this ordinary tale of a young woman and her beloved dog.

Wendy, traveling from Indiana to Alaska with her dog Lucy, ""medium size, yellowish brown, floppy ears, smart eyes, friendly face"" has run into some bad luck and made some poor choices on her trip to find work in the canneries. Yet, she appears to be painstakingly careful in many ways, keeping a journal of expenses, washing her face and brushing her teeth each morning, taking Lucy's red and blue water and food bowls from her car's trunk, searching for change in the car cushions and cleaning out bits of trash.  You notice the small ladies black leather wristwatch, her few personal mementos in the trunk, and are aware that she did leave a life behind, but here she is now.

Then Lucy disappears and Wendy's life starts to unravel, as this is her only form of companionship. This is the gist of the story with a few interesting characters along the way. A dirty train-hopping bum (Will Oldhan) provides the nuance for the ever dangerous outside world and the car mechanic that breaks the bad news of expenses to Wendy (Will Patton) is the form of the ever dangerous inside world. Only an elderly Walgreens security guard shows a concern for Wendy and her dog. Even he has a few surprises in this road trip.

This was directed by Kelly Reichardt and is her second film. It was nominated at several world-wide places and won for Best Picture and Best Actress at the ""Toronto Film Critics Association Awards"". The scenery is less than glamorous as it should be, but there was an opportunity to portray the wilderness in a more dynamic way. Trains through the forest can be a metaphor or at least create a frightening presence. Indeed while Wendy and Lucy are train-hopping there is a sense of danger, but it was mostly filmed darkly with little or no dialogue. This is the same for the entire film. There is sparse dialogue and Wendy is always shown with the same morose, defeated look, with no chance for changes in mood or expression.

There is only one plot twist that I thought was rather interesting, but this is more of a `slice of life' film rather than a strong story in itself.

3557436,4,B001EUSYIA,"Most movies are made to entertain. Even most indie/art films. They usually put an artistic twist on reality to provide escapism, even if it's dark escapism. Art imitating life. Wendy and Lucy is not this kind of film. This is nitty-gritty reality, warts and all... but it's well done.

Unless you have actually experienced the kind of loneliness, bad luck, and desperation that Michelle William's Wendy is dealing with in this film, then you may not get it. If you're expecting a happy-go-lucky road trip movie, then forget it. The movie clocks in at a whopping 1 hour, 20 minutes... and though the dialogue is sparse, the emotions run deep. If you've ever been desperate and had to make sacrifices in your life, at a time when you have had little experience in dealing with the ""big, bad world"", then this movie should make your eyes water. The Wendy character is flawed, as she should be in a movie this realistic. Her troubles are part bad luck, and part her own doing, but hey... that's youth. You were expecting an American kid with perfect decision-making skills? If you're one of those people who HAS to have a character to sympathize with in order to enjoy their story, then don't bother. Go watch a Disney movie instead. Without giving too much of the story away, let's just say if there were a lesson to be learned from this film, it's:

 ""Never shoplift if you still have cash in your pocket"".

Wendy and Lucy is also a profound portrayal of post-Bush America, though it is never made clear exactly how desperate Wendy's situation was at home in Indiana for her to subject herself to the extremes that she does. Still, the callous behavior of the grocery store staff and the town police are all too accurate an assessment of the modern American mindset.

Bottom line: This movie is an excellent slice of present-day American life, but it almost plays out more as an un-narrated documentary than a movie. In my opinion a very well done indie film, very unpretentious and realistic... but it may leave a few viewers feeling flat if they've never experienced what the movie's main character is going through.",1246579200,3,2116,4.708108108108108
3557437,2,B001EUSYIA,"Slow moving ""slice-of-life""  film which revolves around the loss of Lucy, Wendy's dog, and her subsequent search.

Wendy and her dog, Lucy, are on their way to Alaska where Wendy hopes to find work when Wendy's car breaks down.  The next morning, after a night sleeping in the car, they are hungry.  Time to go shopping at a nearby store.  Lucy is tied up outside to a bicycle rack.  That, in itself, raised my stress level, which increased as Wendy slowly meandered the grocery aisles and I imagined Wendy finding Lucy stolen when she finished her ""shopping.""  But no, Wendy is arrested for shoplifting and driven off to jail looking back through the rear window of the police car at Lucy, still tied to the bicycle rack.  That is where I lost sympathy for Wendy.  She had money for the dog food she shoplifted.  Why risk arrest, jail and the separation and ultimate loss of her dependent and loving companion?

Wendy, the main character, was well acted, but seemed basically depressed, which I guess, would explain her poor decision.  Would have loved some background to explain her emotional state.

Since the premise of the film  ""... addresses issues of sympathy and generosity at the edges of American life, revealing the limits and depths of people's duty to each other in our modern times,"" the film maker could have used some other calamity, other than the loss of the dog, to illustrate the theme which would have made Wendy and her plight more sympathetic.",1246147200,6,1467,4.747035573122529

This movie starts with Wendy and Lucy already on their trip north and having some difficulties, but hey, a determined person and a loving dog --they have a chance. As long as they are together.

But that unravels in Oregon, as do other elements of Wendy's plan. Others have noted that this is a
very appropriate movie for these very tough economic times. And that is true, to some extent.

But people have had that burning desire to get to the Last Frontier long before this current recession.

We are very fortunate in the U.S. to have a place like Alaska as a frontier --even though surviving there can be tough.  You can't beat the people, beauty, wide-open spaces, mountains, glaciers, Arctic Ocean, northern lights. Also, another chance for people who might have hit a dead end in the ""Lower 48.""

While Wendy and Lucy run into very serious obstacles to their dream, we can wish the best for them, and keep in mind how helpful we can be to other people and dogs who might pass through our life on their way to a dream.

A great movie worth seeing. And then I hope each and every one of you can get to Alaska someday and enjoy!

3557440,2,B001EUSYIA,"This was a sad movie.  For anyone who loves the companionship of animals and to have to be separated from something you love so dearly and sometimes that animal is all you have in life can be heartwrenching.  But this film is supposedly about struggling through life with not much money or a home.  In today's economy, I'm sure many can relate to that.

But it was hard to feel sympathetic towards Wendy or her life.  I cannot understand why she would steal a can of dog food for $1.99 when she had $500 in her possession.  She went to jail, got convicted of a crime and had to fork out $50 to get out of jail.  Was it worth all the trouble?  Then she takes a cab to see Lucy which looked like it cost more than $10.  If Wendy really wanted to get to Alaska to start earning money, she could have taken the Greyhound to Seattle and got on the Ferry from there for less money than she spent dealing with her car, jail, and searching for Lucy.  And I know how expensive car repairs can be and to lose your car and your travelling home is pretty tough to imagine.

This film would be a nice college student film.  It really had nothing to say about a very serious, socially debilitating subject.  I'm sure that wasn't the aim of why the film makers wanted to do the film to somehow expose the rawness of how terrible being homeless with no job and not much money can be.  Otherwise, it would have been longer than 80 minutes and there would be some insight as to why Wendy is in this situation but maybe that wasn't the point either.  It just fell flat.  I would not want to be in Wendy's position because her life in the film is just poor choices.  I would like to think that there are people out there who put up a better fight to make it through the hardships life throws at them. You cannot be naive and not forsee consequences in your behavior when you're living on the streets in this day and age.

I did like the starkness of the film and the cinematography, but it just didn't hit all the right notes in the places it needed to.  Michelle Williams did a good job in portraying Wendy, but the lack of emotion in her character left me empty, just like Wendy's sad life.",1244073600,8,2172,4.202898550724638
3557441,5,B001EUSYIA,"Wendy (Michelle Williams)and her dog Lucy are making their way to Ketchikan to work in a cannery. When Wendy stops in an Oregon town, her car breaks down and she loses Lucy. I'll just say up front, this movie is difficult. You don't know what it is to be on your own until you watch Wendy and Lucy. Homeless, dogless, carless, jobless, friendless and more or less without a family that cares.

Some reviewers have complained about the minimlist style of this film. Wendy's backstory isn't explained and it left some viewers unsatisfied. I loved the fact that this very clean film isn't muddied with expository background. Wendy doesn't have a solid future and no ties to her past-so why take the viewer backward or forward? It was very effective for the screen writer to force the viewer to simply sit with Wendy and live the moments of her life as she was living them. Wendy is just passing through town and we are just passing through her life. Is it more important to know why she ended up where she is or is it enough to just focus on what it's like to be her?

3557442,5,B001EUSYIA,"Sometimes simple can say so much, and that is the case with this independent gem.  `Wendy and Lucy' quite simple tells the story of Wendy and Lucy, a young woman and her dog.  Wendy is virtually homeless, sleeping in her car as she makes her way to Alaska where she feels her life will be better.  Lucy is her faithful `yellow gold' dog who sticks by her side and proves to be the only sunlight in Wendy's life.  The film opens with Wendy and Lucy walking through the woods playing fetch as a consistent and almost tranquil hum embeds itself in our ears and it is that simple imagery that tells us all we need to know about Wendy.

Without Lucy, she is lost.

The film doesn't have much plot depth, for it can be summed up in one sentence:

""Wendy loses Lucy and desperately tries to find her.""

Trying to cast the film off as nothing more than that though is a shame, since despite the shallow plot points the film has such rich depth of character here.  The real story is not Wendy's attempt to find Lucy but WHY Wendy must find Lucy.  There is a statement on the back of the DVD that makes the accusation that the reason this film has an R rating is that censors don't want children to realize that people are lonely and that life is not always peachy.  Well, honestly, this film is rated R for the F-words that are spoken (sure, there aren't a LOT, but there are more than 3); but I think that there lies some truth in that statement as well.  We (and by we, I mean the general adult public) try so hard today to shield our children from pain that we don't prepare them enough for the actuality of that said pain.  When they come face to face with the harsh realities of the world outside they may, sadly, be unable to cope with it.  I'm not saying that allowing your children to watch this particular film is going to help them be better able to tackle life's eventual hard-times, but I do feel that more films like this need to be made, with a lighter rating (no need for the language at all here) in order to instill in children the need for a thick skin in this often grim society.

Life is not always peachy; in fact, it rarely ever is.

Michelle Williams is a revelation here, sinking so far into her character that she becomes in recognizable.  The way her face contorts when she is hearing the worst news ever (just watch the way she crumbles with subtlety when she is hearing about her car) is just so soul reaching.  She is the opposite of showy but she never fails to touch us.  We understand why she needs to find Lucy because we can see in her eyes, in her mannerisms, in her voice that this dog is all she has left to hold onto.  There are few films that require an actor or actress to carry every scene, and when that film comes along it takes a special actress to actually do just that.

Michelle Williams does JUST that.

The film is not going to be for everyone.  With the simple plot progression some will find this boring, but that is a shame in my opinion.  These small films are very important in getting to understand ourselves inside and out.  `Wendy and Lucy' has been hailed as one of the best films of 2008, and I agree wholeheartedly.  It is a story that will touch your heart with its honesty and sincerity.  `Marley and Me' may have been a sweet and touching story of a family touched by the life of a dog, but `Wendy and Lucy' is an even more honest and poignant depiction of the deep-seated need for friendship and loyalty in ones life; even if it's from a dog.",1242864000,21,3497,4.251134644478063
3557443,4,B001EUSYIA,"I thought the movie was very compelling and enlightening. For me it illustrated that many of today's youth (in their late teens and early twenties) are like Wendy: living on the fringe, without the benefit of a supportive family, an elaborate education, a skill or craft, or money behind them.

However, Wendy has a work ethic and a desire to better her position, evidenced by her long trip to find a job. She does not have the sense of entitlement that you see in more priveledged young people today. Again, many people in Wendy's straights are just one blown car engine away from a change in the course of their lives.

It is a simple story, beautifully told and filmed in Ms. Reichardt's visually engrossing style. The long camera-panning scenes of the landscapes and the way the camera follows Wendy as she walks and runs thru the town at night are absolutely beautiful while also serving to move the story forward. Visually, the movie is stunning.

Three other impressions:

- Walter Dalton as the security guard gives a fine and subdued performance. His character illustrates a similar plight (and work ethic)  as Wendy's. He is an elderly man working 12 hour shifts and states that the job is better than his last.

- It seemed to me that many in the movie would have liked to have helped Wendy more than they did, but because of the system and economic situation they were in themselves, they could not. (For example, the store manager and the auto mechanic, and even the security guard).

- Michelle Williams is wonderful in the movie. The long silences did not bother me. Her expressions and movements demonstrated to me that she is a girl who is down on her luck but has not despaired yet. She is thinking of the best solution for the problems she faces. Wendy may have made a couple of bad decisions. However, look at how young and on her own she is.

Overall, a fine movie by a fine director. I highly recommend.",1242691200,2,1925,4.591836734693878

Homelessness is crude, factual, nonromantic and filled with mundane issues of surviving a life of where to sleep, getting food & money and socializing with like situated compadres. On the whole the movie and acting portrayed Wendy's journey and encounters fairly accurately although most homeless youth would have dumpster dived before risking such an obvious shop lifting. Where I have issue with this movie is this cutesy-fashionable ""leave-it-up-to-the-audience"" to finish the story. That, supposedly suspenseful yet incomplete, writing style works only rarely in literature and has no resemblance to reality -  everything has a naturally occurring beginning and an end. The audience shouldn't be creating endings for someone else's beginnings. If we did then we might as well write the whole story.",1242604800,6,944,5.465753424657534

At any rate, this is a meditation on what can happen to someone who leaves home in pursuit of a dream that wasn't all that well thought-out to begin with. Wendy leaves the Midwest to try to get work in Alaska, but has failed to consider that things could go very wrong.  She runs low on dog food, has to use money to try to fix her car, makes the stupid error of trying to shoplift, gets stuck in jail and has to pay a fine, then finds that her dog is gone, and so on.  All this time, she's stuck in Oregon, frustrated and alone, washing up in  a gas station bathroom.  She even foolishly tries sleeping out in the open one night.
Michelle Williams is appealing in a very non-glamorous role, while the dog Lucy is equally watchable.  There is no tear-jerking music, thank goodness, and no propaganda.  If there's a point here, it's that we should plan and invest much more carefully before setting out on such a journey.  Wendy's greatest flaw is her naivete.",1242518400,2,1135,4.376190476190477

In the almost aggressively noncommercial ""Wendy and Lucy,"" Michelle Williams plays Wendy Carroll, a cash-strapped young woman who's driving from Indiana to Alaska in search of a job.  Riding shotgun with her is a yellow German Shepard mix by the name of Lucy, the most reliable and trustworthy companion any drifter could possibly wish for.  Wendy's situation goes from bad to worse when the beat-up `88 Honda Accord she's driving breaks down in a small town in Oregon and, not long after, Lucy herself goes missing.  Wendy spends a sizable portion of the movie simply searching for the dog, while she endeavors to survive on an ever-dwindling supply of cash.

That's about all the ""plot"" there is to ""Wendy and Lucy,"" which is more of a stripped-down, slice-of-life mood piece than an actual drama.  Writers Jonathan Raymond and Kelly Reichardt focus almost exclusively on the moment-by-moment struggles Wendy goes through as she attempts to make her way through the world, sans money and virtually all meaningful contact with other human beings.  Director Reichardt recounts Wendy's plight with an air of noncommittal detachment, allowing the drama to arise organically out of the simple observation of daily life.  There isn't even a musical score to help heighten the drama or tug at the heartstrings.

While I admire what Raymond and Reichardt are attempting to do in ""Wendy and Lucy,"" the fact of the matter is that the movie is almost too ""small"" for its own good (even in its running time, a mere 80 minutes).  Without a sufficient back story to help explain how Wendy ended up in this predicament - and what, if anything, she is running away from - the movie fails to register the kind of emotional and psychological impact it might have had we gotten to know Wendy better.  As it is, she remains an intriguing but frustratingly superficial character throughout.

There is, however, one very good reason for checking out ""Wendy and Lucy,"" and that is the tour de force performance by Williams, an actress who, up to this point, has done extraordinarily fine work in secondary roles (the most noteworthy being Heath Ledger's wife in ""Brokeback Mountain""), but who has never been called upon to ""carry"" a whole feature film on her own - until now.  The good news is that she proves herself more than equal to the task, imbuing Wendy with a believable amalgam of strengths and vulnerabilities, along with an innate intelligence that serves the character well in the situation in which she finds herself.  Williams is richly complemented by Wally Dalton as a compassionate bank guard who offers Wendy the hand of friendship when she needs it most.

Stripped down to the barest essentials of dramaturgy and filmmaking, ""Wendy and Lucy"" is an ""art film"" in both the best and worst senses of that term.",1242432000,14,2812,4.90295358649789

There isn't much of any explanation about who she is or where she is coming from in life, but you get the impression that nearly all of those details would be bad in some regard or another.  I was left with the impression that she was travelling this great distance just because she felt like she had no other option.  She isn't expecting anything fantastic, she's just expecting SOMETHING, which is far more than what she is accustomed to.

The movie follows what happens to her, and her pet dog Lucy, when her 1988 Honda Accord breaks down in a sleepy little town in Oregon.  Without ruining things with details, suffice it to say that it is one bad turn after another.

Despite the incredible degree of sadness and hopelessness that the film inculcates in the viewer, I loved the movie because of the incredible amount of emotional depth and honesty.  It might be hard for some people to imagine, or perhaps just to sympathize with, but for quite a few people in this world things like your car breaking down constitute an outright crisis.  Especially for her, given that she was sleeping and living in her car and using it to travel a great distance.

One of the things that lets the viewer keep her or his head above water, so to speak, is a supporting character in the film, a security guard who patrols the Walgreens parking lot where her car initially breaks down.  In keeping with the film's realism and honesty, he is a good guy in the sort of way that people might actually encounter in real life:  he helps her out, but he's no hero.  He's just a nice guy doing a little to help a little.  There is so much hardship and tension and hopelessness in the movie, that seeing his character here and there is a welcome reprieve.

I would not recommend this film to anyone who has been suffering from a depression, because it is very bleak.  Moreover, if you've lost a dog or any kind of pet and that emotional wound is still fresh in you, you might be better served by not seeing this movie.  Further still, if you are the type that cannot sit still for movies of a slower pace, then you might not enjoy this either.  But for most people, I think you will feel as I did and become overwhelmed with empathy for Wendy and Lucy more or less immediately.

8299572,5,B001EUSYIA,"A small, very small introspect into a few day's life of one young woman lost in America. She's headed to Alaska with her dog, then runs into financial and legal troubles which leads the loss of her dog. Things are rough but through the random kindness and small assistance of an old timer she finds some bittersweet conclusions.

Typical of director Kelly Reichardt, she leaves us to write the final part of the script which is always intriguing. We also have only a few clues regarding her past, possible reasons for her current road trip, and the extent of family attitude and support where she's from.

Michelle Williams does a great job carrying the entire film, giving us a believable character. The supporting cast is up to the job too. Note this is not a Hollywood movie nor is it meant for those with 2 minute attention spans. There're no special effects, violence, sex nor visually stimulating bling like monster truck rallies or warfare genocides. This is a character study and a human interest story so it won't appeal to all nor many.",1458432000,3,1046,4.7103825136612025
