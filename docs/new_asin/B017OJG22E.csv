7512404,5,B017OJG22E,"Steven Wilson has produced an incredible set of songs here. You wouldn't think, given that these pieces were leftovers from previous albums/tours, that it would not be cohesive, but it is. I can't stop listening. If you have the means, I highly recommend getting the BluRay version so you can hear the DTS-HD Master 5.1 surround mix. It's impeccable. The opening chord with it's Yes/Roundabout-like reverse sample into a chiming guitar chord-- I've never heard it's like.  It's a perfect combination of artistry and technical know-how. He has some of the best musicians in the world (especially Marco Minneman and Chad Wackerman on drums).

The album opens with ""My Book of Regrets."" A widely varied song in every way. Driving, powerful and emotional. Then we go to ""Year of the Plague,"" a beautiful, arpeggiating song in 3/4 time using the Lydian mode-- this is one of the most excruciatingly beautiful pieces of music that I've ever heard. The rest of the album is fantastic too. This is the future of music.",1486339200,,1010,4.900584795321637

7512411,5,B017OJG22E,"This isn't Steven Wilson's best work, but it still merits 5 stars as it's better than 99% of today's music. Steven is a master of multichannel music.

7512416,4,B017OJG22E,Only going to give opinion because their are 100 reviews already and I would only be repeating the same thing so....This is a good Blu-ray of decent tracks that were leftover H.C.E. Nice reworks of Don't Hate Me and Lazarus. The other pieces are good but I can see why some of it didn't make it on H.C.E. (which is definitely a classic.) But Mr. Wilson's leftover songs are better than some Prog artists could ever dream about creating.,1470441600,,436,4.531645569620253

Understand it's an EP, not a complete CD release, so it's only 6 songs (plus a bonus disk if you bought the blu ray version, which I did). But, it's really thoroughly enjoyable!!

7512452,5,B017OJG22E,"Good but not great.  Wilson's solo stuff is top notch, but it has migrated towards too mellow and ""deep"". Porcupine Tree was his best effort  and they are missed.  Good thing there is plenty of old material to listen to, but imagine a new PT album...

Seeing him next week in NYC--also worry he is not doing justice to old PT tunes in his set list. Sad.  (but you can't argue--one of the most talented out there).

Update: OK, he lost his voice in NYC, but still came through. Also, I updated this disk to five stars--liking PT better doesn't change the fact that his solo stuff is not great as well.  This and hand cannot erase are pretty amazing",1456617600,,647,4.341666666666667

7512458,3,B017OJG22E,"okay well lets look at this for what it is, a full priced ep, I love SW from Porcupine Tree to Sand Snowman but this album didn't wow me. All the songs on it are songs that didn't make the cut for a full studio album, that being said these songs are ones SW decided disjointed the album or just weren't up to par compared to the other songs he wrote for the album. Now its not bad but i see this album as nothing more than a cash grab, just as Transience was, if you're one of those people who HAVE to have everything then go ahead and pick it up, that audio quality is on point and its worth a couple spins but overall i decided to sell my copy.",1456185600,,646,3.9015151515151514

The songs on this album are great, I enjoy the diversity of them since they were written in different time periods. I'm not the biggest fan of the new version of ""Don't hate me,"" (would rather his vocals during the chorus) but it still gets a 5/5. Buy this album!",1455926400,,373,4.194444444444445
7512462,5,B017OJG22E,"This is a fantastic EP.  A great way to tide us over until his next release.  Glad I got the Blu-Ray version, the extra tracks are well worth it. The 5.1 is beautiful to the ears.",1455926400,,179,3.9444444444444446

7512471,4,B017OJG22E,"Steven Wilson is the founding member and leader of the Alternative Rock group Porcupine Tree, my favorite band.
Since persuing a solo career, I was a little skeptical at first, but have come to love his new compilations.  I hope he still makes music with the other members of PT in the future, as he is not sure he will.  I would hate to see this, but continue to follow Steven's career and he continues to amaze!

  I have his first 4 solo albums and each new venture, IMHO, seems to trump the previous release.  His newest recording, 4 1/2 (named so as this is considered an EP, not a full length effort, between his 4th & 5th release) just didn't move me as much as his previous.  Don't get me wrong, this is a hard feat to keep raising the bar higher, this is still worthy of being in my collection.  It seemed to get better as I listened for the first time.  Each song, brining a more rounded fullness and presence as I auditioned it.

  I purchased the Blu-ray version to take advantage of the high-rez, 5.1 audio, and many extra versions.  Mr. Wilson has become known as the 5.1 production guru.  His mixing and production, in general, take a back seat to noone in the business.  He is a true maestro of audio production!

  If you are a fan of his, you are definitely going to want to purchase this.  And if not, if you like his previous effort HANDS.CANNOT.ERASE you will enjoy it.  I liked 4 1/2, just not as much as his previous releases.  The most remarkable track on it is his remake of the PT song, which I already loved, ""Don't Hate Me"".  WOW!  It is even better and is a remarkable recording on it's own!  Ninet Tayeb, the female vocalist that is on HCE, sings the chorus in a beatifully haunting gravel-tone that raised the hairs on the back of my neck!  Different than the original, but in a great way.  He also did a 2015 version of Lazarus.  Also a very good version, but I like the origanal better.  This one seems a bit rawer.

  I have only listened to 4 1/2 two times, so it may grow on me as I continue to take it in.  All in all it just seems like a compilation of tracks which didn't make it on the 2 previously released The Raven..... & H.C.E. and that is precisely what is.  Being such a workaholic, Wilson released a 30min EP w/extras before writing and finishing his 5th full effort.  But, being SW, it still shows his craftsmanship as he continues to persue his solo career!",1454976000,10,2406,4.285077951002227
7512472,4,B017OJG22E,"Great material that just didn't fit within the ""H.C.E."" theme. Not at all an after thought, excellent work. Also a nice live rendition of ""Don't Hate Me"".",1454976000,,154,4.7407407407407405

7512481,4,B017OJG22E,"A nice follow up to HCE, and a good filler / keep the door open / release. Maybe a bit boring after a few listens though, but overall, a must, as SW continues to do great work in the progressive world of music. Although both versions are good, I definitely like the full SW sung version of ""Don't Hate Me"" better than the female / male duet.",1454371200,2,341,4.104477611940299

7512494,4,B017OJG22E,"As is usually the case with Steven Wilson EP's, seems like some of his best music almost ends up on the cutting room floor.  Excellent bunch of tracks, especially My Book of Regrets and Happiness III.  The instrumentals are all really nice, and the remake of Don't Hate Me is almost perfect.

Almost.

I think Ninet did a fantastic job on the vocals for Routine, from Hand. Cannot. Erase.  However, that squeak she makes at the beginning of practically every line in Don't Hate Me makes her sound like Cyndi Lauper, and really grates on my nerves.  Sorry, Ninet.  You have a fantastic voice, but, well, this was not your finest performance.",1453766400,3,640,4.660714285714286

7512496,3,B017OJG22E,"Don't get me wrong. This is a good album. It's basically the leftover tracks from his last two projects. But his unused songs are better than most everything else out there. But, because of the nature of this collection, it is kind of random. I wouldn't suggest this as a first album of his. For that I would suggest The Raven that Refused to Sing. But this one does still show his range, from catchy pop to somber goth or proggy goodness. Enjoy.",1453680000,4,446,4.385542168674699
7512499,4,B017OJG22E,Excellent selection of songs.  Steven Wilson continues to grow as an artist.  Can't wait for the next project!,1453593600,,110,5.055555555555555

7512504,5,B017OJG22E,This EP is the summation of some great work by Steven Wilson and the artists who performed with him over the last 4 album. If you have the opportunity to see this man live make it happen you will not be disappointed,1453507200,,215,4.142857142857143
8739957,4,B017OJG22E,"This is not Steven Wilson`s most consistent work. But, it is at least listenable and worth checking out. The major problem that I find here is the length (only 36-37 minutes), which would be fine for an EP. The other problem I see here is that there are only 6 tracks,four of which are the major highlights: My Book of Regrets, Year of the plague, Vermilloncore, and the remake of Porcupine Tree`s Don`t Hate Me.
Track list rating:
1) My Book of Regrets: 4.5/5

8739961,5,B017OJG22E,I should not admit to this but... I purposely wanted to hate any solo effort from Mr. Wilson due to the fact that Porcupine Tree was never getting back together. I am upset at myself this is an awesome album ! AWESOME !!!,1504396800,,221,4.162790697674419
8739962,5,B017OJG22E,"Calling ""4 1/2"" a ""music record"" is an incredible understatement. What Steven Wilson has done here transcends generations and genre barriers. Rather than a collection of ""discard pile"" songs as some fans seem to think, Wilson has compiled a seamless soundscape journey that must truly be heard to describe it. Every song connects with the next in such a way as to blur the former's ending and the next one's beginning. The EP is surprisingly varied and encompassing for such a short work, and satisfies many sensibilities: from the more prog-oriented opening track, to the heartfelt and understated follow-up ""Year of the Plague."" ""Don't Hate Me"" is an extraordinary cover of Wilson's band Porcupine Tree's famous song with Ninet Tayeb providing a strong and pointed response to Wilson's subdued vocals.

Wilson has TOP NOTCH instrumentation in this ""filler"" album (it's called 4 1/2 because it was launched between his 4th and 5th records). Minneman's drumming is exquisite, solid, precise, and highly organic. Guthrie's solos take front and center in My Book of Regrets, sparing no expense with melodic phrasings while also incredible technique. However, it is truly SW's compositional prowess that shines here. As I stated before, Wilson writes and arranges looking at the big picture and the effect the album as a whole has on the listener. Every track takes its time to develop and lead you by the hand through the complex yet at the same time accessible journey Wilson has constructed. SW also is a very very talented sound engineer. This album is perhaps among the top 10 best sounding albums I've heard, with a very organic, albeit precise sound. It is pleasing yet punchy, with a very clean, wide mix that has excellent soundstage and separation. Every single ghost note, every pick stroke is audible. Wilson does something with the reverb on his voice in the verse of ""Don't Hate Me""  where he sustains his last notes for several seconds until the next verse line starts... You literally can't distinguish where he stops singing and where the long reverb begins. Unbelievable. You have to hear it to understand.

He also takes immense care into detail. The artwork of this EP is GORGEOUS and haunting at the same time. You can't help but wonder what those two girls sitting on the bench mean. As for the 5.1 version, a perfect product is simply taken a step up. Instruments are divided along the different channels, with vocals on the front L&R plus Center. A great 5.1 setting is necessary to truly enjoy it as cheaper systems may sound distant and empty, lacking clarity. Overall a strong release, improved only by the higher quality format and 5.1 sound separation.",1503273600,,2678,4.946666666666666
