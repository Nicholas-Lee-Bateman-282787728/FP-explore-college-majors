7796819,4,1567301444,"This is a film from 1996 by legendary film maker Claire Denis, who shot to fame in 1999 with the art house `Beau Travail'. It tells the story of the brother and sister in the title, Nenette has been at boarding school after the divorce of her parents, she ended up with the father. Boni hates his father and is currently scratching a living selling pizzas from a van and living in the old family home.

Boni is nineteen years old and has the hormones to prove it; he lusts after the wife of the local bakers wife and gets through rather an alarming number of `French sticks', and the pun was fully intended. Then his sister turns up with a story to tell and carrying more than just `emotional baggage'. His initial rejection of her and the father is something he has to face up to and also what he is doing with his life. Just caring for a pet rabbit and selling pizzas when he can be bothered in between episodes of writing filthy odes of lust to Mr Baker's wife, is hardly anything to brag about.

This is not really art house it is more of a coming of age tale but has Claire Denis all over it, she gets `Tindersticks' to do the music which are toned down versions of a lot of material from their second album, they also collaborated on `Trouble Every day' with more original music. It is quite sensuous at times, check out the pizza dough rolling episode and you will ever quite think of `Dominoes' in the same way again. Boni is played by Gregoire Colin who went on to be in `Beau Travail' and is just finishing his latest film `Opium' where he plays Jean Cocteau.

The acting is all excellent, the cinematography is realistic but not exceptional and the music is great, but I love Tindersticks, so am seriously biased. It is nearly all in French with very good sub titles and a run time of 103 minutes. I found this extremely rewarding but it will not be for everyone as it is far from being action packed but it does have its moments and when they come they are powerful enough to pull the whole thing together. One for Euro cinema fans and anyone who appreciate Claire Dennis, but this is nothing like `Beau Travail' so if that is your preferred genre i.e. real art house then this may not be for you.",1365811200,4,2209,4.3180722891566266
7796820,4,1567301444,"IT SEEMS TO BE A DEFINITE FORM OF ARTISTIC EXPRESSION ON FILM BUT THEN I READ THAT THIS TYPE OF WORK IS CONSISTENTLY FRENCH  MINIMALISM. Less dialogue but lingering shots on the mundane or the important as a clue telling the story.  Denis' films have a way of taking your mind out of your theater seat and bringing it into the mood and sense of the characters and you just go around following them watching every detail they provide because it really does appear that they are not really doing anything much at all but then you do come to realize that the characters are telling you a story and Denis may be leaving you some clues.  Or, she's leaving it up to you to interpret.

I HAVE A COLLECTION ON 15-YEAR OLD GIRLS and what happens to them at home and in society.  I have written that the 15-year old girl is the most important female in a human society and I was shocked that most women, even women in the boardroom agree with that statement. If there is no society to nurture the 15-yr old to maturity then there is no society for females to be in a boardroom.  Nannette's story is rather typical in the lives of girls who have been bombarded by an event in their lives that is ALL NATURAL and LEAST IDEAL.  Her 18yr old brother tells her something so startling that it would be a wonder if she could ever heal from it. I know of a young girl who heard something very similar from her gyn doctor nearly fifty years ago: ""Why didn't you just have it in the woods like any other animal.""  She says she never recovered from that. And, she was raped and didn't tell anyone.

That's the kind of depth that Claire Denis films will take you. It makes you feel the characters, who really aren't saying much, and it makes you sympathetic. Denis is raw to the bone.

I first bought the dvd: 35 Shots of Rum: a father & daughter question.  I wrote three reviews and I still don't feel I can say I know what I experienced or saw. Denis implies idealistic values; she doesn't rely on idealism to tell her story.

She uses her actors over and over. I don't blame her. They will become vintage minimalists: Denisites, doing flawless Claire Denis performances. She does use attractive people or people with ""face"" presence.

The father left the children after their mother died young. The father tells his son Boni that his dead mother did not behave as a true woman to him--she was not interested in stuff like that-- then Nannette is seven months pregnant and runs away from home; her classmates do a fundraiser for her to get an abortion but when it comes time for all this Nannette discovers she is actually seven months pregnant. The son, Boni, wants to kill the father and he is constantly firing a pellet gun, but then his father owes a lot of money to men who come to strong arm him; altogether somebody shoots and kills their father.  Nannette is so cold toward the baby allowing not even the least acknowledgement--she says things do not exist that she doesn't want to exist...It does seem unnatural but reasonable if she has had an event of incest in her life. But it is no way clear that this is what happened.  Her brother ends up having a big emotional problem with letting go of a baby that came out of his sister's belly.  He behaves very irrational. He mashes dough...and when I looked at what Claire Denis did with that scene I could only think and feel that this is what males may feel inside when they touch the female anatomy and adore it.  That's my interpretation of this scene.  He seems to have rather natural young male sexual fantacies says expert Nancy Friday in her books but they are a bit grotesque and concerning when he stares at the wife of the baker as the target for his big, long, hard, grand-slam penis debut; he describes the debute in his poetry.

The story closes, returns your mind to reality and you still don't know what happened.  You will have to think about it long and hard and you will be thinking about the clues you think Denis have left for you but you won't feel sure they were clues. YOU WILL STILL FEEL THAT YOU HAVE HAD A MOVIEGOING EXPERIENCE THAT YOU LIKED--MO",1343520000,3,4109,4.402906208718626

7796822,5,1567301444,"This film was excellent.  The director allows the viewer to become comfortable with the characters, and then adds abstract information to complicate the plot.  The viewer feels uncertain and confused at some points in the film, but that is the brilliance of this piece of work.  This film keeps the viewer stimulated by using visual effects.  Also there is a strong sense of motion. Sometimes it is difficult to understand what is suppose to be a dream, and what is actually reality.  The film is basically centered around a brother and sister relationship with a few added complications.  This relationship is very odd, but realistic and touching.  The ending is very vague, but that is reality.  The viewer is left with a deep feeling of some kind, it is very difficult to explain.  This film is a pure representation of society, economy, and morality. The director puts the viewer face to face with the hardships of everyday. life.",974505600,9,934,4.860759493670886
