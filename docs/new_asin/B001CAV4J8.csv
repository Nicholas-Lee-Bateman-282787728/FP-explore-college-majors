3506942,5,B001CAV4J8,"This is a great program for pregnant women. It is very comprehensive and provides modifications as you move through various months of your pregnancy.  I wouldn't recommend this for those new to exercise.  It is intense and you need to be in good shape to tolerate the program safely.  The entire program is quite long, but there is a shorter version also offered on the DVD which is nice for when you do not have 90 minutes to exercise.",1264982400,3,436,4.493670886075949
3506943,5,B001CAV4J8,"Finally, an excellent but tough prenatal workout! I have been working out for years but my muscles were acutally sore after finishing this dvd for the first time! I would not recommend this to women who have never worked out before. It really got my heart pumping! I'm definately buying Teddi's postnatal workout to get me back to pre-baby shape.",1264464000,2,346,4.783333333333333
3506944,5,B001CAV4J8,"This video is one of the best workout DVDs I've tried since the start of my pregnancy (17 weeks).  The full video (there is an option to shorten it on extra busy days) is 90 minutes of conditioning, cardio and relaxing stretches.  There are different circuits that work on all the major muscle groups (glutes, thighs, shoulders, triceps, biceps, back).  There are lower back focused exercises, abdominal breathing techniques, and a lovely and long stretch at the end of the video.
Teddi (the trainer) has a soft and sweet voice but she is able to motivate you to push you through the workout.  The three models used in the video are each in a different trimester so you can see the modifications that each one makes to make themselves more comfortable while still getting a great workout.
I'd highly recommend this video to any woman at any stage of pregnancy.  I'll definitley be buying the postnatal workout once the baby comes!",1262304000,2,930,4.751552795031056
3506945,5,B001CAV4J8,"While this dvd is not super intensive (prepregnancy I was in to Taebo and kickboxing 5-6 days a week) it is a total body conditioning workout.  The main workout itself is about 90 minutes long (no joke) but includes some cardio, weight training, stretching, and breathing exercises.  It is also nice that there is an option to do a shorter version of the workout (which will still take you about 50 minutes) or you can choose to just do the breathing work.  The set is stark with a totally white background and just Teddi and 3 pregnant women and their equipment.  (The equipment you will need: dumbbells and a step.) It is nice that each of the pregnant women is in a different trimester so you can see the modifications you can perform depending on your energy level and trimester.  The dvd does look like it was shot professionally though and Teddi is very easy to watch and follow along with.  Overall I definitely recommend for any pregnant woman in any trimester.",1238025600,,969,4.604651162790698
3506946,5,B001CAV4J8,"I was always a workout enthusiast but during my first 3 pregnancies at ages  24 , 25,and 32 I put exercise on hold and practiced lots of self- indulgence making it a very long road to shed the excessive pounds of those pregnancies. I had a lot of backaches and swelling and overall fatigue during those pregnancies so decided that this pregnancy at the ripe age of 39 would have to be more fitness and nutrition oriented. I started by buying Erin O' Brians workout which is good but not really intense enough as I was doing Thai kickboxing, running , and lifting weights before pregnancy. I have a great prenatal video by Rocky but I needed a more intense cardio and strength workout. Hot Mamas looked good so I ordered it. It is a really thorough and professional workout. Teddi's instructions are precise and I find myself still absorbing her instructions even after doing the workout many times. It's like having a personal trainer in your home. I also like that the exercises are repeated in sets of three and the belly breathing and stretching exercises after the strength workout are also really thorough. It is a long workout at an hour and a half but there is also a shorter one included. I do this workout 2 or 3 times a week and supplement it with the Erin O Brian and yoga DVD's. I can say that I feel better during this pregnancy than I did at 24. My backaches and bloating don't bother me and I haven't become a dimpled mass of cellulite yet!",1233014400,,1455,4.449438202247191
3506947,5,B001CAV4J8,"This video is like no other. If you want to really bounce back after your baby, doing this workout during your pregnancy  will really help you. This is a great way to stay in shape while pregnant. Fun & exhilarating for all moms!",1226448000,2,229,4.325581395348837
3506948,5,B001CAV4J8,"I've been training with Teddi every week for over two years now and this DVD is as effective as having Teddi train you in your own home. The shorter workout is great for days when you just want to squeeze a little something into your day; the tutorial helps you understand what movements you can expect in the workout and the other women that are participating in the workout make it look doable. All women, no matter what stage in life can benefit from this DVD.",1224547200,2,463,4.395348837209302
3506949,5,B001CAV4J8,I'm so glad to see a workout made specifically for moms unlike alot of others that are just generic moves. I love how motivating (and tough) Teddi is and it keeps me going.,1219795200,,172,4.242424242424242
3506950,2,B001CAV4J8,"The things that make this workout INTOLERABLE for me are
1)The white background.  It is very distracting for whatever reason.  It is just boring and blank.
2)The sound quality is TERRIBLE.
3)Teddi Bryant just stands there giving instruction and never participates in the workout.  This is a pet peeve of mine.
4)She makes quite a few references to labor.  I do not want to think about labor, I just want a workout that is safe.  I know I am pregnant and do not need hokey tips about doing squats and later using that to propel myself through labor.  Also her low tone is too soothing; I need more pep than this offers.
The workout itself would be OK if it weren't mind-numbingly dull.  I bought this based on the positive reviews and am very disappointed.  I consider myself having been an advanced exerciser prior to pregnancy.  This workout, along with most of the other prenatal workouts I have tried, was a DUD.",1278460800,,915,4.598765432098766
3506951,5,B001CAV4J8,"I had been searching high and low for a prenatal workout that was challenging and this is definitely the winner. It's 90 minutes, but there is a 45 minute short version of the workout as well.
I don't think I've ever done more squats or lunges in my life, but it definitely makes a difference to how you look and feel. There are modifications for all trimesters, and yet, even the third trimester modifications feel like a good workout.
The only issue I have is with the core exercises, as most are performed while lying on your back. My doctor has told me not to lie on my back since the 18th week. I have altered these exercises by doing the core work on an exercise ball, so I am not flat on my back. It's not exactly the same thing, but I think it works ultimately the same.
I strongly encourage anyone looking for a challenging prenatal workout to purchase this DVD.",1276646400,2,871,4.3496932515337425
3506952,3,B001CAV4J8,"I like this workout because they have three pregnant women, each in a different trimester, doing the workout.  It's nice to have a visual for the various accomodations for the exercise.  The workout itself isn't too hard.  I didn't break a sweat at all, but got a little out of breath in some parts with the lunges.  You need a light weight, and they recommend a step, but it isn't necessary.  Teddi Bryant's voice is a little too soothing for me--not very energetic at all!",1274659200,,474,4.529411764705882
3506953,3,B001CAV4J8,"I will say this is a sweat inducing and challenging workout which is refreshing. There are a few way too easy prenatal workouts out there.
However, the workout is long and in my opinion does not give an adequate warm up.  I got bored with the three sets of just a few exercises.  She also offers very few modifications which I find especially troublesome with the abdominal section which is done entirely flat on your back.
She also does not always do the same number of reps or the same pace on each side of the body.  I get a 45 second stretch on one arm while she babbles away and only 15 seconds on the other.
The short version is also about 45 minutes if you include the core work and the stretch which should be included in every workout. I don't find that very motivating for a day when I am really pressed for time. I prefer my quick workouts to be complete with a warm up and cool down in under 30 minutes.",1274400000,,915,4.1875
3506954,1,B001CAV4J8,"I own seven prenatal exercise dvd's: I'm on my third pregnancy, and I like the format of the exercise dvd, I do them a lot -- very convenient with kids.  BUT, this particular dvd is my absolute least favorite.  It does give you a reasonable amount of exercise (I'm in pretty good shape, and want a real workout even when pregnant; this does make me feel I've done something when I'm done, which is good.).  But there are others out there that make your muscles work as hard or harder, without the various annoyances; I'd recommend ""Long and Lean"", for example.  Here's what's wrong with Hot Mamas:
1. The exercises themselves are very boring, repetitive, and sometimes borderline uncomfortable to do while pregnant.  It's based on a very old-fashioned boot-camp model, lots of push-ups and marching and (modified) jumping jacks.  That's ok, but those type of exercises were developed for men, and they really don't feel all that great, to me, to do while pregnant.  I get bored and depressed when it comes time to do yet another set of same old same old push ups.  You can get the same upper-body workout with a lot more variety, by breaking up the push-ups with other stuff.  I much prefer routines that incorporate yoga and dance and pilates, instead of always with the boring boot camp thing.
2. The flow is horrible.  I've done both the long and short versions, and in both cases, you go from one set of exercises to another without any continuity.  Instead, you have to waste valuable exercise waiting around to be told what to do next.  Other routines don't do this.  It's a problem, too, because your heart rate goes down in those seconds; and it adds to the boredom.
3. Cuing is also horrible.  After I've done the dvd a couple of times, I like to watch with the sound off, so I can listen to my own music or radio.  In this dvd, a lot of the time you're just watching Terri, standing there doing nothing, telling the other women what to do.  The camera goes away from the exercise, to focus on Terri, standing there.  That's not inspiring, and doesn't give me the right kind of peer pressure to keep going.
4. I wouldn't bother with mentioning this if everything else was great, but the aesthetic is also horrible.  I know it sounds mean to say it, but Terri has a bad dye job and too much make-up.  The exercise takes place in a whited-out nowhere.  I'd rather see an actual studio, a real place.  In both cases -- the make-up, the whiting -- it seems try-hard and fake.  It's just not good to look at.  Also hate that they use a step; I don't have a step, I don't want to do things for which I supposedly need equipment.

So: I figure that most people who gave this good reviews haven't done that many other pregnancy dvds.  You really can do better!  Try the 10-minute pilates, or long and lean, or the perfect pregnancy workout, or even Leisa Hart.",1272499200,18,2861,4.474903474903475
3506955,5,B001CAV4J8,"This is my third pregnancy and with both previous children I gained 50 pounds.  And, I lost all of my weight in between births (they were born only 17 months apart)....I am determined to keep some 'semblance of a body for AFTER the baby comes versus me just feeling fat and flat:) ....not beautiful, womanly and pregnant like during pregnancy....Plus, I already have 2 small children so I don't have as much time after to workout and get the extra weight off.
So, I bought Teddi Bryant's Hot Mamas and Summer Sanders'.  I like Teddi's better because it is more challenging.  But, Summer's DVD is more cinemagraphically pleasing and the set is better.  Teddi's set is boring but it is easier to see sometimes what exactly is going one...i.e. placement of feet, etc (Black suited women on a totally white background).
This DVD also does very, very well with things like 'foot placement', stomach muscle engagement and posture alignment reminders and tips for understanding the correct exercise form and movements.  I have been watching fitness DVD's for over 10 years (I prefer to sweat in private :) and this one is the best one as far as instructional...and, overall it is WORKING! :) My butt has gotten ...smaller using this video and I feel very strong.  My sciatica does not act up nearly as much and she teaches you a stretch that has really empowered me to help myself when I feel like my right side is trying to tighten up.  I had pelvic girdle pain with my second child and I suspect I pulled something during one of my prenatal videos (pilates).  I never, never feel that as challenging as this video is that I am at risk for hurting my body.  I also go to a chiropracter which helps out a lot and unbeknownst to me, I could have gone to one with the pelvic girdle pain and gotten relief but I didn't know anything about Chiro. then).
I am also having to eat every 2 hours b/c of low-blood sugar so this video is encouraging and very well made with quality and it makes me feel like even though I am having to eat (healthy) I am still in good shape and healthy for the baby...I was an average weight/BMI before getting pregnant, but my butt actually feels and looks better now because of the exercises for saddle bags and backward lunges!!

I rated it 5 stars but the music is lacking in interest and originality (I listen to my MP3 player out of one ear and listen to her with the other)but I guess it is good for people that don't have alot of rhythm? ;)
I started with this video but use the Summer Sanders too(twice a week and Terri's twice) just so I can get in better shape before trying out Teddi's whole 1 1/2 hour video (her short session is 50 minutes with stretching.  This video also has a much better stretching segment than Summer's.  I felt that Summer's video put me at risk for pulling my hip/back out of alignment if not done 'perfectly' or too fast...I just do Terri's stretching during these 2 leg stretches on Summers' video. This video is good cardio because you are safely working out and exerting yourself~You sweat and your heart rate goes up.  It is still more a conditioning based DVD versus a true 'cardio' video...but it is for looser ligamented pregnant women so I understand that.  Overall, I very much like the video I just didn't read any reviews before I bought it that pointed out the lacking music (it does have some obviously but very monotonous) but this isn't the main point of working out.  The video does tone!! I am a pair shape that becoming more of a 'coke bottle' and user-friendly.  I felt like between Summer's video and this one, I like Teddi's more.  She really asks you to work at a challenging but SAFE rate.  I feel like I have really asked myself...Am I asking enough of myself?  Am I really challenging myself and that is a great feeling...to be more empowered after the video! Summer's is challenging and I do it twice a week, just not as much and her video doesn't even give you variations (her trimesters are split up into totally different segmental DVD's) versus seeing 3 women all working the same muscle groups and Terri helping you decide where you are at and what you are capable of.  I felt a little annoyed by Summer Sander's excessive talking and kinda of smart-alec comments at her sister-in-law but it was good natured.
Teddi has a more serious tone and a very soothing voice.  She knows you need to concentrate to work out and keep form.  Hope this helps!",1269820800,5,4432,4.506866416978776
3506956,5,B001CAV4J8,"I bought a few prenatal workouts and this one is the most like a standard workout DVD. Weights, a mat and a step are kind of necessary. Not too hard, but still effective. I would recommend this DVD.",1269820800,,198,4.2368421052631575
3506957,5,B001CAV4J8,"This is a great workout video for those who are already in shape. I am in my third trimester but have been working out consistently throughout my pregnancy, and this video is definitely a challenge. I love the variety of movement incorporated and the great deal of lower body work. Teddi is positive and easy to follow. My only complaint, and it is very minor, is that the women shown exercising never take a water break. You definitely need to have some water while doing this video. If you are looking for a video that will make you feel like you are working out hard, as well as give you a good stretch at the end this is it. You will feel strong and empowered after completing this workout! I'm looking forward to Teddi's postnatal workout after the baby arrives.",1269820800,2,767,4.485714285714286
3506958,5,B001CAV4J8,"I had been working out regularly before I got pregnant (3-5 days a week)and was ""benched"" by my doctor for the first trimester.  So picking this up at 16 weeks made for a pretty intense workout. (Read: holy crap!) Might have been less so without the 3 month hiatus, but this workout felt like starting over.
  This is my forth pregnancy and having come from a pilates/yoga only practice through my last two, I can say this is a thorough, make-you-sweat workout.  I would say it is the pre-natal equivilant of the hardest class I took at the gym.  This is in keeping with Teddi's philosophy that women want to feel as much like
""themselves"" as possible during a period when so many things are changing.
  While this is still too long of a workout for me (6 or 7 circuits, I think) I plan to alternate the first half and second half during the week.  It's also easy to just go as far as you can into it and work up to adding another circuit every week or so.
  The icing on the cake is the stretching/abs work segment which fills my void for a yoga class: the music is soothing and still maintains a beat, Teddi is a calming influence and I often find I'm doing the work with my eyes closed.  Looking forward to Teddi kicking my not-so-widened rear post-partum, too!",1267660800,7,1264,4.358974358974359

8286361,5,B001CAV4J8,"I bought 3 prenatal WORKOUT-workout DVDS (plus 3 more gentle yoga/belly dance/pilates workouts) - this DVD is the one that gives THE BEST workout!  This is the only DVD that I feel could substitute a gym workout; the other prenatal workout DVDs I've tried are effective but not that strenuous.  This gives me that post-workout glow of accomplishment from my pre-pregnancy days.  Note that I am experienced exerciser who does 3-5 weekly cardio & strength workouts.  The workout consists of several circuit segments; each segment works a few body parts & builds up on basic moves.  You get such an overall great strength & cardio workout.  I like that trimester variations were shown as they also helped me get a good workout despite the occasional knee pain I sometimes get.  Yes this is a long workout - over an hour - but you can do one or a few segments at a time.  In fact, the ""shorter workout"" is just one of the segments, so when you want a short workout, you can do any of the segments.  It cracked me up when she started one segment of bicep curls with holding a carseat - that really brought home WHY we were working out - to get in & maintain great shape to be better equipped to handle our coming parenthood, in addition to maintaining our health for ourselves!  One thing I'm less than crazy about are the ab exercises at the end - they're on their back but not flat (legs are bent), but they just didn't feel that comfy for me so I did planks on my own during those.  I did this workout during my 2nd & 3rd trimesters, LOVED it.  I'm soo grateful to have found this DVD in a sea of just-ok, barely strenuous prenatal workouts.  I rotated this with other DVDs & trips to the gym.  If I had to recommend just 1 DVD to an experienced exerciser, this is it.  Thank you, Teddi, for giving us a [...]kickin' AND pregnancy-safe workout!  I gotta get me the post-natal DVD now...!",1291593600,2,1885,4.404624277456647

It gets to be a little long in the end - the back, belly breathing and stretching - but the actual work out part I really enjoy.  I sweat and you can make it as hard or easy as you want.  The background is boring and she has a really soft spoken voice, which near the end of the DVD gets to be a little too much.  But overall I really enjoy this work out.  And, because it is done in circuits you can just advance ahead if you don't have time for the whole thing.

I was a little sceptical about the level of difficulty of the exercises (push-ups, etc.), but three excercising 'hot-mamas', each one in different stage of pregnancy (1st, 2nd, 3rd trimester) were reassuring.
The program is a little long and the lack of music (motivation) is a bit of a drawback. But the exercises are well explained, including the importance of breath (in, out at specific moment), plus the frequent references to the labor and breathing during the labor. In general - challenging, but seems to be worth the effort. Thanks a lot.",1279670400,,608,5.09
