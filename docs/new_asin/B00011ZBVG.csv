8005360,5,B00011ZBVG,This DVD is very good it explains and shows one the use of acupressure for different problems. The DVD is a good beginning for one learning acupressure.,1379635200,2,152,4.666666666666667
8005361,1,B00011ZBVG,"Since there's no option of zero stars I have to give it one in order to post my review.  I can't believe I wasted $10 from ebay on this pathetic imitation of accupressure techniques AND over an hour of watching it hoping it would get better.  There's no chart as promised, what I really wanted to start with. It's so slow moving and long-winded with only the occasional example of accupressure, which are all filmed so far from the camera you can't see a darn thing.  I guess she expects you to understand just from her talking?? which by the way is soft mumbling and running so fast through a row of points none of it makes sense.  There's the most irritating 'music' which consists of about 10 notes repeated over and over through the whole thing that makes you want to put it on mute, but then you are left with nothing since the camera is too far away to see anything, and most of the time isn't even focused on her hands so you really have to imagine what they are doing.  While she's 'demonstrating' a pressure point, her hands are out of sight on the other side of the subject's body from a long camera shot. ??? What's the point????  A few glimpses of a chart on a wall, but they are all so far away you can't make heads or tails of them.  I made a HUGE mistake by not checking amazon first for reviews before throwing my money away.  Now I gotta start over looking for one as good as this one promised to be.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!",1341964800,,1435,4.227106227106227
8005362,1,B00011ZBVG,"The dvd did not work, no replacement option and I have to paid shipping for a refund. Product cost $4.99, shipping $2.99. Not worth shipping back. Basicly I lost $5.00",1320969600,,167,4.6
8005363,4,B00011ZBVG,"I rented this dvd and found it helpful.  If you are taken Acupressure classes (Beginning to advanced);
you would understand that it takes times to correlate the points and their uses.
Therefore, you can add this to your book of knowledge.
It is better to have something simple, yet understandable at the same time, as you
can add this to your book of learning/knowledge.",1278374400,,370,4.78125
8005364,1,B00011ZBVG,"This DVD is the most horrific product on acupressure ever made. It was short and not informative in any sense. Don't buy it... President Brooklyn Institute of Massage Therapy ( Brooklyn, NY )",1201737600,10,191,4.818181818181818
8005365,1,B00011ZBVG,Very amateur video. Poor technique examples. Pointless. Waste of time and money.,1127174400,31,80,5.75
