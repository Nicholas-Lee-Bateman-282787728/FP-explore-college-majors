7800626,5,1629970549,"The Great Courses lecture series are one of my preferred ways to continue learning as an adult.  The Thermodynamics: Four Laws that Move the Universe DVD collection is my 15Th DVD set in the last six years. The professor for this lecture is Dr. Jeffery C. Grossman, Ph. D., is a Professor in the Department of Material Science and Engineering at MIT in Massachusetts, he has done over eighteen other lectures. I have seen at least eight other course lectures. He is among my favorite lecturers. This course is no exception, there are twenty-four lectures that are around 31 minutes in length, I had no trouble following the flow of the lectures and the DVD series used animations and graphics and to get across the some of the important points. Overall I am satisfied with the lecture series and will look for future series by Dr. Grossman.

7800627,4,1629970549,I am currently a student majoring in Broadfield Science Education at university and I can honestly say that thermodynamics is NOT just for physics!  Throughout my biology and chemistry courses we often referred back to the laws of thermodynamics when discussing the why behind the content. Although I have a familiarity with the main concepts behind thermodynamics I have never studied it in depth. This dvd and book set help to bring the classroom and lab into my living room while being instructed by a professor from a very prestigious university!  I really love how he is able to connect the concepts to real world application as well as how he brings the concepts to life through demonstrations that you would find durimg the lab component of an in person course equivalent.  This course covers the most important ideas in thermodynamics in 24 lessons on 4 dvds with an included guidebook that acts like notes on each lesson.  Although the actual content of the course is great the overall production quality is a bit less than exciting and visually stimulating. That minor flaw aside this is a fantastic course. I look forward to expanding my knowledge of such a fundamental part of science. I received this item for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.,1467158400,,1288,4.867579908675799

I had to opportunity to purchase this product Thermodynamics Four Laws That Move The Universe. By Professor Jeffrey C Grossman

I was excited to incorporate this into our curriculum this year. I was also glad I could preview this information before so I could refresh my memory about these concepts prior to viewing with my daughter.

This set come with 4 CD's that include 24 Lectures. The information was presented in a easy to understand easy to apply approach. It also has a book that outlines key information topics covering all 24 lectures.

I really enjoyed previewing this product and would recommend it for all audiences. It is a well thought out easy to understand presentation. I am seriously considering purchasing other Lectures by Professor Jeffrey C Grossman to incorporate into future curriculums.

Disclosure. I received a discount in exchange for my honest review. The discount does not effect or influence my opinion of this product",1466812800,,1044,4.948571428571428
7800629,5,1629970549,"I will be teaching middle school physical and earth science next year and needed to brush up on my physical science a bit.  This lecture series is really good and easy to listen to.  There are 3 DVDS with 24 lectures that are interesting and interactive with great pictures and easy to relate to ideas and images that make understanding the laws of thermodynamics easy to understand. There are some great experiments that would be easy to duplicate as a demo in the classroom to help the students better understand the ideas being presented.  This series would be good for people wanting to learn thermodynamics or brush up on it as I am for my teaching. While, I received this thermodynamic lecture series at a discount for an honest and unbiased review, I choose what I want to review useful for everyday use by me and my family. I also read these reviews for honesty and buy from them so I hope to this for others as well.",1466726400,,925,4.494047619047619
7800630,1,1629970549,"Just to be clear form the outset, this is not a review of the course, but of the DVDs I received. One of the DVDs cannot be played completely -- the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th lectures on the 6-lecture disk simply freeze up. I've tried the disk on three different DVD players, with the same result. These were used DVDs, and there isn't anything obviously wrong with the DVD -- no visible residues or bad scratching. Disappointing, as I was really enjoying the series, which I would give high marks.",1423440000,5,490,4.455555555555556
