3792433,5,B001TLZ2ZW,"Bohdan Sl&aacute;ma wrote and directed this sensitive and tender story about public versus private views of sexuality in the Czech Republic: his gifts as an artist of cinema are formidable.  He knows how to tell a story, how to create a fascinating group of characters that with little dialogue speak loudly about human rights and understanding of differences.

THE COUNTRY TEACHER ('Venkovsk ucitel') opens with a young teacher from Prague who has joined the faculty of a small country school - an environment completely at odds with the rush and high life of the city. Petr (Pavel Liska) is a quiet, withdrawn, seemingly depressed young man who immediately connects with the students in his Natural History class.  The students and community accept this new gift to education in the provinces but wonder why such a fine teacher would leave Prague. Petr finds housing in a curtained room of a meager household and begins his quiet cloistered life away from what seems to be a traumatic escape from his home in Prague.  We soon learn  that in Prague, Petr had problems with a relationship and his fellow teacher mother cannot understand why Petr cannot find happiness as a normal married male.  He confesses to her that he is gay and his mother (and elusive father) begin to understand why Petr 'escaped'.  Back in his new country home Petr makes friends with a single mother Marie (Zuzana Bydzovsk&aacute;) who serves as both mother and father to her 17 year old son Lada (Ladislav Sediv), a funky lad in love with a girlfriend whom he sees as his intellectual superior.  Marie hopes to attract Petr but when overtures are ignored she instead engages Petr to tutor Lada.  All goes well until Petr's ex partner (Marek Daniel) visits and disrupts the environment of Petr's closeted safe life.  As Petr and Lada grow in their relationship as tutor and pupil, Lada discovers he can indeed succeed academically.  After a night when the two drink too much an incident occurs that unveils Pter's growing love for Lada and Lada leaves in disgust.  The world explodes for Petr but gradually his honesty as presented first to Marie and then to his faculty begins a course of healing that leads to a touching closure of the story.

The cast is first rate and capably convey the spectrum of emotions that surround this little tale of discovery.  How Bohdan Sl&aacute;ma is able to keep his story aligned in transferring between Prague and the little county province demonstrates a sensitivity to human interaction that is equal to the finest writers and directors.

3792435,4,B001TLZ2ZW,"This is a low key, but very beautiful Czech film. A talented young teacher leaves his prestigious teaching job in Prague to teach in a small rural school and locals are somewhat suspicious of his motives, but never-the-less welcome him into local activities. It is later revealed that Peter is gay, but wants more meaning out of life than offered by casual city hookups. The major focus of the film is not Peter's gayness, but on the relationship between Peter, a lonely widow Marie and her rebellious 17 year old son. The film's portrayal of pastoral farm life is spectacular and leads an element of visceral truth to the film. This is a heartfelt drama that deals with very human issues.",1250985600,10,689,4.702479338842975
3792436,4,B001TLZ2ZW,"Bohdan Slama is becoming the new voice in Czech cinema. In three films he has shown himself to be a major talent. His film The Country Teacher presents a simple yet powerful story about unrequited love and the human power of forgiveness.

A teacher (Pavel Liska) moves to a small rural village in order  to take a job teaching natural science at the local elementary school. He is a quiet introspective man who does not seem to fit into the setting that he has placed himself in after having taught in Prague. He soon becomes friends with a lonely widow Marie (Zuzana Bydzovska) and her rebellious 17 year old son Lada (Ladislav Sedivy). As the friendship progresses the audience learns that the teacher has no sexual interest in Marie but no reason is given. When a former boyfriend of the teacher arrives in the village a chain of events is set off that willlead to painful revelations about all three of the main characters.

The film concentrates on characters not on convoluted plot lines to get its story across. There are long takes that focus on individual faces.  Director of photography Divis Marek does an admirable job filming the bucolic landscape  with long lenses in order to force his viewers into the story. If there is a flaw with the film it is that the ending is a little contrived but the message that forgivness is necessary for us to evolve as humans is universal. There are also messages about the diversity of life that are played out in the daily lives of the characters..

This film had a limited screening in my location but I was able to view  the Film Movement DVD. The standatd definition disc presents the film with no real issues and the subtitles are easy to read and seem to get at the nuances in Slama's script.

This one is worth checking out if you can find it. The film was an official selection at the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals and won the Audience Award at the Cottbus Film Festival.",1247270400,15,1932,4.563583815028902

3792441,5,B001TLZ2ZW,"For Czechophiles, Bogdan Slama`s latest film, `The Country Teacher`(Venkovsky Ucitel), is a must see.  With its panoramic shots of emerald forests and sapphire lakes, the film captures the magic of the Czech lands.  Moreover, `The Country Teacher` radiates that indescribable Central European essence much like a Hrabal novel.

And yes, there is a story as well.  A timeless and beautiful one at that,  a fable about love, self-acceptance and our indestructible need for others. The `teacher` in question has left a prestigious teaching position in Prague, transferring instead to a village elementary school.  The locals are glad to have such a learned person teaching their children.  Yet, they can`t understand why he has come.  Self-effacing and bookish, the teacher inspires his new pupils. Soon, he makes the acquaintance of a simple peasant woman and her teenaged son.  Helping the son with his math lessons, the teacher soon becomes a regular at their dilapidated farmhouse.

Yet, cracks begin to appear in the teacher`s seemingly enigmatic mask.  He is lonely and stand-offish, yet he rejects the romantic advances of the farm lady.  He confesses that he is fresh from a break-up and needs time to be alone.

The real reason behind the teacher`s confusing behavior soon becomes clear.  Back in Prague for a short vacation, he comes out to his parents.  It turns out that he has escaped the temptations and disappointments of big city life and has sought out an idyllic refuge in the country.  Soon the teacher`s former life catches up as an ex-lover pays a visit to his science lesson.  The teacher must face his true identity in his new environment.

Caught in this dilemma, the teacher suffers and soon succumbs to his desires.  He attempts to seduce his young student.  Rejected, the teacher suffers a personal crisis.  He alienates both the boy and his mother and fears his `secret` will destroy his new life.  How the teacher chooses to deal with this situation is the crux of the film.

The power of `The Country Teacher` lies in its masterful portrayal of self-deception and its terrible cost.  Slama has called his film a study in `forgiveness.`  While forgiveness is central to the film, `The Country Teacher` examines our inexplicable need to be accepted and loved, by ourselves and by others as well.  The film artfully portrays our human hunger for connection, one that can lead either to disaster or to intimacy. The film explores both consequences in depth.

The acting here is impeccable.  The two leads, Pavel Liska as the tormented teacher and Zuzana Bydzovska as his kind-hearted and ultimately forgiving friend, bring these troubled characters to life with precision and power.  Yet, the film`s greatest strength is the camera work of Davis Marek.  With his sweeping shots of the Bohemian countryside and intimate close-ups of the locals, you feel transposed to some forgotten hamlet of Mitteleuropa.  Finally, the film`s score is perfect, blending the most disparate musical genres (punk & classical harpsicord) to enhance each scene.

`The Country Teacher` is a short-story brought to life on film.  Echoes of Maupassant or Flaubert can be heard throughout `The Country Teacher.` For those searching for a moving study of human character, `Venkovsky Ucitel` is an excellent choice.  With its subtle touch and deep empathy, the film has much to say about the human condition.",1357257600,7,3404,5.084837545126354
3792442,2,B001TLZ2ZW,"This film is not worth watching, as it is not written well, the characters are not well developed, and altogether it does not hold your attention.

I turned it off after a whole hour of waiting for something interesting to happen.

What also got me T.O.'d was a quite graphic scene of a dead baby-cow. Unnecessary.

It is not the worst movie ever, but I'd say, find something else to watch.

A great movie from the Czech Republic is 'Kolya', for instance.  5 stars out of 5 for Kolya.",1337126400,2,484,4.393258426966292
3792443,3,B001TLZ2ZW,"""The Country Teacher"" is an understated drama about a gay teacher who leaves the big city for a position in a rural school district.  There he befriends a widowed farmer and her troubled, teenage son.  A complex triangular relationship develops among them, with the woman falling in love with the teacher and the teacher developing inappropriate feelings for the boy.  Meanwhile the boy is struggling with typical teenage angst and a desire to escape from his dull rural existence.

It is all very earnest and well-intentioned, but it is so slow-paced as to be almost moribund.  No, we don't need car chases and explosions along the way, but a little action would be helpful, or at least a bit more interaction between the characters.  There are lots of poignant silences that finally become so much dead airtime.  The script is rather murky as well.  A little more exposition would be helpful.  At the end of the film I knew little more about these characters than I did at the beginning.  Why did the teacher leave Prague?  To escape from his domineering mother?  Because he broke up with his loser boyfriend?  Or is he in fact a serial pedophile leaving one mess behind only to get himself entangled in another?

And then there are the characters themselves.  The teacher is pretty much a non-entity, quiet and mousy to the point of invisibility.  The mother is completely unbelievable.  Her behavior stretches the bounds of credulity.  She blithely stands by while her teenager drinks and smokes pot and has sex with his girlfriend.  (Okay, I know, there are parents like that!)  Worse yet, her infatuation with the teacher is apparently strong enough that she is willing to overlook his own admission that he molested her son, and to persuade her son to do likewise.  It is all about forgiveness, I suppose, which is very noble.  But would you ask this guy to move in with you?  And is the shared experience of helping a cow give birth really going to mend the problems these people face?

The film is well-acted, and beautifully photographed, but it isn't enough to overcome the diffuse story and languid direction.  A major disappointment.",1333929600,6,2146,4.813698630136987
3792444,5,B001TLZ2ZW,"This 2008 Czech film is focused on a gay theme, told in a caring and sympathetic manner.  A quiet science teacher, Petr (Pavel Liska) leaves Prague to teach at a rural elementary school.  Petr  meets a hard working farm widow, Marie, with a young testy 17 year-old son, Lada.  The teacher and the widow form a strong relationship.  But the teacher's desire is soon directed at her son.

Things get complicated when Petr's ex boyfriend makes a visit to insist their relationship can resume.  However, Petr is adamant there is nothing there anymore.  The ex-boyfriend seems set on creating havoc.

There is a beauty in the manner the story is told, particularly with the sexual approach.  It is a simple story about familial love and hard work, sexual desire of a gay man, friendship and loneliness in the human condition, betrayal of love, and simple forgiveness.  The acting is done well and this lengthier drama comes through the Film Movement, which brings award winning independent and foreign films.  If you are one to enjoy foreign film, see those provided by Film Movement, good directing, good storytelling.

Ironically, to my surprise, this film is directed by Bohdan Slama whose previous work was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Something-Like-Happiness/dp/B000MD8ZJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Something Like Happiness</a>, which I found totally opposite in film quality and certainly not a favorite.  .....Rizzo",1308009600,3,1465,5.6
3792445,3,B001TLZ2ZW,another gay film that was not very gay.  the main character was rather depressing and not one you would want anyone to emulate.  did not live up to the hype i read about it.,1290124800,2,173,4.0588235294117645
3792446,4,B001TLZ2ZW,"I enjoyed this film of an intellectual, depressed, introverted gay science teacher in modern-day Czech Republic.  Although the film is slow in revealing that he had thrown over a gay male lover, a good teacher job in a high-level high school in Prague, and a better standard of living over in Prague, he seems content - in a moody way -with his day job teaching, quiet and reading in a rented room at night.

No one mentioned the music in their reviews - very nice Czech folk music on accordions, to which the village people dance and drink; sad vocal female singing back in Prague visiting his parents, quite emotional, excellent mood set.

The single farmer and her teenaged son, a 17-year-old boy, with whom he begins to spend his free time, give this lonely teacher a sense of friendship.  Naturally, without her knowing that her new friend is gay, she is very hurt when he refuses to respond to her physical overtures...up on a haystack in a glorious countryside of green grass, cows, a lake.  His new life looks blissful, if he were only straight!

But alas, his thrown-over city lover drops in, a scoundrel and a drunk, who causes enough trouble with the boy and his girlfriend that the hidden truth of gayness comes out.

He has been helping to tutor the less-than-confident son in his math exams, and the boy is unaware of any physical attraction on the teacher's part.  Older males in the village think the teacher is a very good fellow to help a fatherless and directionless boy so much, what a wonderful influence he is!

As a native of San Francisco, I watched this film carefully, since I know that elsewhere, especially in former East Bloc and Soviet nations, gay male life was often hell.  This sensitive teacher hides his orientation very well.  He seems to be determined to stay celibate and simply study, read, have an intellectual life on his own.  The villagers do not suspect, the schoolchildren and fellow teachers don't, and he doesn't tell anyone.

What is NOT quite believable is the ""rape"" scene when the teenage son, Lada, with whom he thinks he's in love, has to strip off his wet clothes and go to bed, while our protagonist reaches under the covers, boy asleep, begins to touch him...

The teacher knew full well the consequences of touching anyone.  I was surprised indeed that there were not worse consequences for him, the least of which is losing a job, possibly a career, if no one could trust him with male students again.  I was also surprised that Lada's mother would have him back as a friend; most parents are afraid of their boys getting ""corrupted"".  She is cast as nimble and able, quickly moving and smiling, but not good-looking, calling herself an ""old lady"".

The curse of drinking permeates the village; lots of beer is normal for these people, young and old.

This is a film interesting to those who've been to the EAst Bloc nations, those interested in the pastoral beauty of Europe, the life of farming, the life of a single mother and a son, and above all, to gay males interested to see how their orientation is handled differently, seen less tolerantly, than in the USA.  Suffice to say that in Communist countries before 1989 such men were in prison or in ""psychiatric"" hospitals, forced onto drugs.  Hiding was their main obsession, although East Berlin had its scene in underground bars.

It could also be called a drinking film!

And above all, a film of platonic friendship winning out in the end, a lovely Happy End as the GErmans would say.",1285027200,7,3502,4.6677524429967425

8342041,4,B001TLZ2ZW,"Other reviewers have done justice both to the story and the themes conveyed in this film, so I won't restate their comments, with which I agree. I will, however, express my gratitude for a complex and nuanced study of the life of a gay man in an unconventional setting --- so very different from the silly, superficial, clich-ridden gay-themed crap being produced in America. For those who appreciated the virtues of ""The Country Teacher,"" I recommend ""In the Name Of,"" a Polish film similarly rooted in national culture and complex characterizations that make it more than just another gay coming-out story or a mindless exercise in camp.",1499904000,,639,4.981308411214953
