8423299,4,B004CNK538,"It was so fun to watch the young Betty White in this very early example of television. The producers were still testing the possibilities of this then-new medium, and White's creativity was just as hilarious in this her first show as she's remained throughout her long life (she is not only the star but one of the writers and the producer). It is also a time capsule of what ordinary American, middle-class life was like over half-a-century ago.",1492819200,,446,4.730769230769231
8423300,5,B004CNK538,"Well, it's Betty White in her prime. She's ALWAYS been in her prime! Smart, funny and intelligent humor. My wife watches Golden Girls ad nauseum. Betty is the only one ALIVE! She's a HOOT. My wife hates her. I love her style (Betty's)",1456876800,3,234,4.465116279069767
8423301,5,B004CNK538,"These really old TV shows are not for everyone. This collection is from the early to mid '40s when tv was just beginning as an entertainment medium. They have a sort of innocent, awkward feel to them, which for me is the whole point. And Betty White is both funny and sexy and seems to have a native intelligence that's a tad above the material. I love this set.",1425254400,,362,4.260869565217392

8423305,5,B004CNK538,I loved this show as a child and still do. Betty White's brilliant brand of comedy hasn't changed from her beginnings in the early days of television.,1334880000,4,150,4.592592592592593
8423306,4,B004CNK538,"""Life With Elizabeth"" is a forgotten gem. The stories are more realistic than many sit-coms and are among the funniest of the 1950s. Betty White is a delight as a wise-cracking, slightly ditzy wife of a man who loves her but does not find her funny. We do! The format of three skits per show, with the last one ending in hopeless confusion, can be a little off-putting, but the series is better for it because the episodes are not strained or diluted. The show is like peeking into a marriage -- possibly your own.",1307232000,7,514,4.421052631578948

Running between 1953-55, LIFE WITH ELIZABETH revolved around ordinary housewife Elizabeth (White) and her husband Alvin (Del Moore). In quite a bold step, storylines took on a non-linear pattern, with the on-screen narrator (future game show host Jack Narz) taking us through various ""incidents"" in Elizabeth and Alvin's marriage, as opposed to regular 25-minute, self-contained stories. In the early days of TV sitcoms it was highly unusual, and still is largely unheard-of today! This was, at least, partly done because the producers weren't sure if they wanted to syndicate the whole show or just highlights from certain episodes....remember this was the early days of television production and ground was still being broken.

LIFE WITH ELIZABETH originated at the Los Angeles station KLAC-TV in 1952, where both White and Moore were employed at the time. The show started out being aired live with a studio audience as part of a larger, five-hour block of variety entertainment. White won her first Emmy Award for her performance as Elizabeth.

Betty White's charm shines through in every single episode; not to mention her strong chemistry with co-star Del Moore. Loie Bridge has a recurring role playing the couples' interfering old neighbour, Chlorine Skinridge. The humour is very benign; not like the slapstick of ""I Married Joan"" or the crowdpleasing, laugh-a-minute ""I Love Lucy"" by any stretch, but still very worthwhile.",1290124800,6,2351,6.875838926174497
