8635720,2,B004O1GRVC,"This Korean film about an autistic boy whose mother tries to get him determined and trained to run a full marathon ALMOST got it right.  As the parent of a severely autistic child and a frequent marathoner, so much in this film felt personal and familiar to me, and at points it moved me to the verge of tears.  The divorced mother trying to find meaning for her life and her son's, the struggling second son who feels taken for granted and neglected, the cruel world that cannot understand.  The film showed complexity and depth.  And the acting was truly wonderful.

But then they got it wrong--so, so wrong!  I must admit that I did have my initial doubts about the dissolute coach who ""won the Boston marathon"" (really??  This would make the character based on Lee Bong-Ju, the 2001 winner...  But I wonder how HE feels about being portrayed as a lazy drunk who cares for nothing and no one?  And no athlete with the discipline to win Boston would ever let himself go quite like that, would he??)  These doubts were slammed home in the final marathon segment, and I scoffed so outrageously that I had to turn the film off.  The film immediately soured from complex realism to sentimental pap.

It would have been enough to have the boy finish.  He had failed to finish an earlier race that he was better trained for, and had stopped running and started a rudimentary job.  Halfway through the race, reality hit, as he sat down on the road, his legs giving out under him.  OK, I thought, this is tragic, but this is real.  To run 26.2 miles takes a whole lot more than will and hope.  Whatever your spirit, when your body is done, it's all over for you.  But let him get up and finish, I thought.  A four-and-a-half hour, a five hour marathon, that's still an amazing accomplishment for anyone.  Let him get up and limp across the line.

But oh no, that wasn't enough of a victory for this film.  Suddenly the boy magically revives, gets up and starts running with a vigor he didn't even show in the first miles of the race, where he was jogging at what appeared to be 9-10 minute mile pace.  Now he's going at 7-8 minute miles, as though the physical collapse never happened, and he's looking good.  Hurrah for the kid!  It's a miracle!

Well, let me tell you, life doesn't work this way, reality doesn't work this way, and marathons DEFINITELY don't work this way.  Couldn't the filmmakers have conferred with a single runner about their tale?  Based on a true story or not, the boy's finishing time (2:57??!!) utterly fails to match with what we saw him doing in the film.  Have you ever run a sub-7 mile?  Do you know how relatively fast that is?  Can you imagine stringing 26 of them together?  It's an achievement, worthy of bragging rights, and definitely not something that you can do just by willing it.  Definitely not something you can do by jogging the first 10 miles at a leisurely trot.  Definitely not something you can do when you collapse on the road and can't get up for minutes.  But oh no.  Reality went right out the door to make a sentimental story of triumph, a story about running that understands NOTHING WHATSOEVER about running!

So close, and yet so disappointing...  I wish I had turned this off and imagined the race.  It would have made the experience so much more meaningful.  A film so unsentimental and meaningful in so many respects, ruined!",1416528000,,3379,4.511551155115511
