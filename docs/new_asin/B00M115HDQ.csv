6546158,5,B00M115HDQ,"Remember Oh Yeah! Cartoons?  It was an anthology series by Nickelodeon.  Much like the What a Cartoon show for Cartoon Network, it was used to test pilots for new cartoons (it was how Cartoon Network hits like Dexter's Lab and the Powerpuff Girls started).  As far as I know, there were 3 shorts that were turned into series; The Fairly Odd Parents (which seems to be spotty; the few episodes I've seen range from hilarious to horrible), My Life as a Teenage Robot (which I haven't seen yet but really want to see as the original short was one of my favorite episodes), and of course this wonderful little cartoon.  Funnily enough, the very first cartoon that Oh Yeah! Cartoons ever showed was Chalkzone (it's included as a flashback in the first episode).  I loved it so much that it ensured that I would watch it whenever I could lest I miss another gem like that one (and there were some other great episodes that really should have been made into shows, like the brilliant fairy tale/X-Files mash-up F-Tales and the incredibly funny Dan Danger Show).  I was always happy whenever they showed another Chalkzone short.  When I saw that it got its own series, I was ecstatic.  I loved it, from the opening (which is by far the greatest opening to any Nicktoon ever) to the unique art style to the cute, creative and funny stories.  I have waited a long time for this to come to DVD, and I still would rank it in my top 5 Nicktoons.  It's not as laugh-out loud as Angry Beavers, Kablam! or Rocko's Modern Life and it's certainly nowhere near as awesome as the Avatar series (at least until season 2 of Korra; I'm sorry but aside from the 2 episodes about the origin of the Avatar I think that season is mediocre), but apart from those I would rank it over every other Nicktoon (you can keep Rugrats and Doug; I liked them when I was a kid but I can't stand them now).  Sure, the songs are pointless for the most part and the execution could be better at times, but there's always something about the stories that stands out.  Even as a kid I could have told you that this show had more heart than that new (at the time) one about the talking sponge.  Sigh, to think I thought that one wouldn't last very long.  But at least now I finally have Chalkzone on DVD, as well as all my other favorite Nicktoons (Avatar, Angry Beavers, Rocko's Modern Life and the Wild Thornberrys), except for Oh Yeah Cartoons and Kablam!  Seriously, why hasn't Nick done MOD DVDs for those shows?  I would buy Kablam! in a heartbeat, and eventually I would have to get the complete Oh Yeah! Cartoons series. Not every short was good, but that's to be expected in an anthology show.  Like I said, there were some truly outstanding shorts.  My favorite episodes are so good that a complete set would still be a vital part of my Nicktoon collection.  Anyways, I still love this show and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

6546196,5,B00M115HDQ,I can't find any other way to watch all the Chalkzone episodes so this DVD is perfect if you want all the episodes. But no special features sadly also a few discs have a very minor glitch. I wish there was more Chalkzone merchandise on Amazon.,1486944000,,243,4.304347826086956

And now you won't have to break out the old VCR to do it.! I just wished Nickelodeon had all their old movies and TV shows like this, but unfortunately a lot of them were lost in the vault. Disney too",1484438400,,322,4.046875
6546199,5,B00M115HDQ,"This was a good series.  It brought me back to my childhood, and the episodes are in good quality.  The only thing I do not like is the fact that the DVD's are in DVD Rom format, where the menu is not the same, but it's still a great series, and great quality sold by Amazon!  Thank you, Amazon, for putting this out!!!!",1481241600,,320,4.0476190476190474

6546204,5,B00M115HDQ,"Boy does this show bring back memories. I loved watching this show when I was 10, and I love it even more watching it as an adult. This show helped steer me towards my eventual love of sketching, and showed me just how far creativity will take you if you strive toward it. The show itself may not be for everyone if you didn't grow up on it like I did, but the show itself is great for anyone with a young one that has taken a deep interest in any kind of drawing, really. I'm sorry that isn't very descriptive, but I bought this purely off nostalgia and I'm enjoying it all over again.

When it comes to shipping/packaging, the product arrived on time with no issues and I am very satisfied with what I received.",1463184000,,713,4.204379562043796

6546206,5,B00M115HDQ,I loveChalkzone. I wish there were more of it. With this my daughter and I can at least watch the whole series as it is though. Definitely worth the cost.,1462147200,,154,4.166666666666667
6546207,5,B00M115HDQ,"I've been searching for this for forever. Anytime I mentioned it to anybody, they had no clue what I was talking about. I loved this show as a child and I'm so glad I have the series at a reasonable price!",1459382400,2,205,4.024390243902439

6546210,5,B00M115HDQ,"Chalkzone is a rare creative gem of a classic Nicktoon from 2000's (double-zeroes), even though it originated as a series of pilot shorts from Oh Yeah Cartoons in 1998, right from the very first episode, all integrated into its own series according to Wikipedia. The Fairly Oddparents started out the same way; it's a wonder Chalkzone didn't become as popular or long-lasting as The Fairly Oddparents, even though the former is easily better, and a lot more bearable and creative, in my book. Fifth-grade BFFs Rudy Tabootie (voiced by E.G. Daily, who also played Tommy Pickles of Rugrats AND All Grown Up, and Buttercup of The Powerpuff Girls) and Penny Sanchez (voiced by Hynden Walch, who played one of the Teen Titans, Starfire, and also Princess Bubblegum in the modern cult hit, with fans, Adventure Time, but Penny's singing voice was by someone else entirely) get into all sorts of wacky and surreal adventures behind the chalk board at their school or at home or anywhere else, with Rudy's superhero-like creation Snap, hence the name of the show. There's 40 episodes in all in this 5-disc set, 8 shows apiece, with Rudy and Penny on them, with Snap sandwiched in the middle on disc 3. But there's a few small drawbacks to it; the 2 lost episodes that never aired haven't surfaced here either, causing them to be inaccessible to Amazon; and the short episode The Smooch was omitted, due to legal complications with the music being used in it; other than these, you get the rest of the whole enchilada in this set! Most of the shows contain short music videos at the end, in a similar manner to the music videos Tiny Toon Adventures had, only with original songs made for this show sung by the main cast, and not lip-synched to famous singers' songs (such as Respect or Yakkity Yak). Despite being BFFs, it was proven in it somewhere that Rudy secretly wanted Penny to be more than a BFF to him, if you know what I mean. I'm galderned sure Digimon fans have been going ON and ON for years about wanting other boy-girl BFFs in it to be more than that, such as T.K. Takaishi and Kari Kamiya or Mikey Kudo and Angie Hinamoto. But I digress, you never know what kind of creative, surreal, wacky, musical escapades these 3 best buds will face next, in Chalkzone or anywhere else, even at holidays like Halloween, Christmas, and New Year's, as their teacher has always hated toons (even more so than my Mamaw, on my mother's side of my family, causing this Nicktoon to appeal to my own talents and sensibilities)! Just like with Rugrats, Hey Arnold, CatDog, The Angry Beavers, The Wild Thornberrys, SpongeBob and The Fairly Oddparents, Chalkzone also started in the 90's, via Oh Yeah Cartoons like The Fairly Oddparents did. If this show's to your liking, go ahead and add it to your own Nicktoon DVD libraries today!",1443916800,9,2818,4.683467741935484

6546212,4,B00M115HDQ,"Me and my kids love this cartoon and we were so happy to get the entire series on DVD. Every episode is there (as far as I know) but I really wish there was some kind of special features such as commentary, behind the scenes, missing scenes, goofs or maybe just a photo gallery. Anything extra would have been nice. If they do happen to add special features i'll give them that fifth star.",1430352000,2,389,4.27027027027027
