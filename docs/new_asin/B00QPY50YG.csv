Do yourself a favor and watch Offspring!!!",1520380800,,336,4.349206349206349
8692265,5,B00QPY50YG,"This is one of the best shows I have EVER seen. I usually prefer Crime shows (Wallander is one of my favorites, Cold Case Shows, Shetland, Bordertown, Dicte, The Fall), but occasionally I'll watch a drama (Big Love, Parenthood, Gilmore Girls, Gavin and Stacy), and even more rarely, I'll watch a sitcom (Arrested Development, Absolutely Fabulous, Keeping Up Appearances). This is absolutely one of the BEST shows ever. It's perfect- you will laugh, cry, squirm, swoon- all of it- in every episode. The humor is adult, but it is always perfect. My sister put it best- when we both finished watching it, she said, ""I feel like my best friends have left me."" Please watch this show. You will not be sorry.",1518652800,,702,4.762295081967213

8692270,4,B00QPY50YG,"This is one of the best series to come out of Australia; it is very well written, well acted, with good production values.  You can easily believe the characters, even though some are a little out there; and you can become emotionally invested in them.

For the most part, the language is okay, but there is swearing and an occasional ""Oh, God.""

Many of the situations are sexual; and the set up is, the Proudman family is a very sexual family.  However, despite all of the inappropriate sex, there is very little nudity and none by any of the principals in the show.  If I recall correctly, there is some very limited nudity in season two.  So do not buy this thinking this is some R rated sex romp; it is not.

Because of the material, this show is completely inappropriate for children and teens; and would most be appreciated by young adults (and by some old adults).

This is probably the worst set of extra features of the many DVD's I have seen.  The first season with ""The Nurses"" is outstanding; but most of the special extras are poorly thought out, poorly executed, and often poorly shot and miked.

Also, you need a region-free player to water this show.  It will not play on a typical DVD player.",1480982400,,1210,4.47945205479452
8692271,5,B00QPY50YG,I found this show on Hulu and I wanted to have it in DVD format. It's funny and definitely has it's emotional moments. I was happy that it worked with a U.S DVD player. Also the set arrived in great condition.,1469923200,3,209,4.121951219512195
8692272,5,B00QPY50YG,Awesome show! Awaiting 6th season!!! The whole ensemble together made this show amazing! Kudos to Asher Keddie on bringing another season!!!,1448064000,2,140,5.714285714285714
8692273,5,B00QPY50YG,"Pure genius.  Rarely do the stars align to create a magical masterpiece like this Australian tv series, Offspring.

Get ready for contemporary, unexpected story lines and great romances, a few tears along the way, but oh so very much laughter.

Sharp and imaginative writing, crisp and artistic production, and acting so real you're left quite sure that if you visit Melbourne, you will surely bump into these Proudmans.  The Proudman family - what love looks like.  Asher Keddie - colossal talent cloaked in humble grace.  You will fall in love with this entire cast.  You will love spending time with these beautiful crazy people.

Perfect to every last detail, from the gorgeous art on the walls, to lovely clothes, and even homemade songs (""it's difficult to stay aroused, when you're surrounded by a thousand owls"")... you've reached across oceans and deserts with your shining brilliance - please give us many, many more seasons - the world needs more Offspring!",1447027200,4,968,5.044025157232705
