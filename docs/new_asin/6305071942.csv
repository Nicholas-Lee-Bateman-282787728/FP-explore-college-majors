960029,4,6305071942,"I guess we have more Blues Clues videos and DVDs than any other character.  He's been a favorite of my son's since before he was one year old.  Now he's almost 2 1/2 and has begun to develop more serious tastes.  He'll actually watch many more programs geared towards older kids, and even adults, but he still likes his Blues Clues now and then.

Blues Birthday was always one of his favorites.  Kids of course love birthdays so it's fun to watch Blue's party as he is joined by Steve and the rest of Blues friends for the celebration.  Steve also teaches kids the the birthday candle dance.  Good fun for your young ones.",1107734400,2,622,4.4035087719298245
960030,5,6305071942,My son is 2 now. He's alway's loved blue even as an infant. I have older children who enjoy watching also. It's something he can relate to. He's also learning so much from blue and her friends. Also from Steve and Joe. Any kid will love this video.,1083110400,,248,4.1875

My son was given this video during his Blue's Clues obsession.  He loved it and I even got some great ideas for his 2nd birthday party.
Now my second son is enjoying it.  Guess I'll have to have another Blue's Clues party. :-)",1078531200,,249,4.276595744680851
960032,2,6305071942,"I was disappointed to see that the first half of the show was with Steve and no Blue. My almost 3 yr old son went around saying, ""oh no, no Blue"" for the first 20-25 min. Although it is a fine move, I'm glad I only paid little at Target for it since we only watch half of the movie all the time.",1033948800,2,295,3.6984126984126986
960033,5,6305071942,"My kids love Blue and Steve...I bought this video because they don't show Blues Clues at night..This video shows children how to use there minds to solve a puzzle involving Blues Birthday..U know, with a Handy Dandy Notebook..My kids favorite thing on this video is Mailtime..This video has great songs and little skits by children..",1000944000,2,333,5.072727272727272
960034,4,6305071942,"My 2 year old son adores blue's clues; with this in mind i purchased the Spanish version of Blue's Birthday. Even though he doesn't quite understand the Spanish yet, he was still captivated by the birthday theme and familiar characters.  Steve's voice is different, but still quite soothing and clear. There are two birthdays celebrated, so you get two stories with the same theme; which further helps understand the birthday celebration concept. Blue's Clues videos in English or Spanish have great series of events which essentially teach problem solving and creativity, with cute appealing characters.  Am trying to teach my son Spanish, and keeping his attention is the toughest part-this video has solved that problem---my son started repeating a couple of Spanish words after his second viewing of this tape...perhaps it's not beginner's Spanish, but children have such great learning capabilities!",994809600,2,904,5.404255319148936
960035,4,6305071942,"All the Blue's Clues series is a must for preschool children. By focussing on specific concepts and themes throughout each show, children learn the basics through repetition and creative playing. The characters are adorable and a nice relief for parents used to the annoying Teletubbies. At least this series teaches your children something and they speak audible english. Kids are positive and big grins on their faces when they are told they are ""smart"" and ""excellent"" etc, by Steve. We have a 2 year old and she absolutely adores these videos. We even bought her the Handy Dandy Notebook, which is a nother positive reinforcement for added learning within this series. If you don't enjoy this we guarantee your kids will.",992304000,3,725,5.0
960036,4,6305071942,"This is our first exposure to Blue's Clues.  I find the backgrounds inviting and different; the skiddoo concept (through which Steve catapults  himself into different settings) fascinating and the story is manageable  and well done.  This series has a common theme:  items marked with Blue's  pawprint are ""clues"" to a mystery, which the children resolve  after discovering the clues.  In this episode, Blue is having a birthday  party.  First, Steve learns the birthday dance; next, he shops for  presents; then, he helps Blue with the table and finally, they have the  party.  At the end, Steve gets a present of his own from Blue.
This is  a sweet little story; the characters are cute and there is certainly some  learning going on.  That said, this is a tape that evokes the dreaded  ""again"" refrain. (Then again, all the good ones do that).",965952000,,846,4.845070422535211

After he learns the dance Steve skidoos back to his house and the episode begins.  Excellent for young children learning about birthdays.  Most importantly parents, this tape does not include Joe!",1228089600,,373,4.967741935483871
7882117,5,6305071942,"My 2 year old LOVES Blue and Blue's Clues.  We rented this one from the library and she wanted to watch it over and over - I think there's just something magical about birthdays (and other holidays for that matter) for small children.  So far this week she has been at her play kitchen making ""birthday cakes"" for everyone in the house and wanting us to sing the birthday song over and over.  Sure  my husband and I are sick of the songs but Blues Clues is positive and encourages learning for kids so I say, deal with it.  Repetition is how kids learn, and if she loves it, who cares???  I give this one an A+++!!!",1137801600,,615,4.213675213675214
