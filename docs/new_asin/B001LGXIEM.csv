8318047,5,B001LGXIEM,"This DVD is a great value, what with about two hours and 20 minutes of music over 14 tracks.  It features the great Kenny Davern and Bob Wilber at the 1994, 1995, and 1996 March of Jazz gatherings in Florida produced by Arbors Records.  Among the musicians ably supporting the leaders are pianists Ralph Sutton, Derek Smith, and Dick Hyman, bassists Milt Hinton, Jack Lesberg, and Phil Flanigan, drummers Tony DiNicola, Joe Ascione, and Jake Hanna, and guitarists George Van Eps and Bucky Pizzarelli.  The last selection, from 1994, includes saxophonist Flip Phillips, guitarist Howard Alden, and drummer Bobby Rosengarden, with Kenny and Bob just sitting in at the end of this version of ""Cottontail.""  The video production for the 1994 set was poor, but was relatively better for 1995 and 1996.  The audio is fine throughout.  If you want perfection, you'll find it in the music.  Those who enjoyed the collaborations of Davern and Wilber in the '70's, '80's, and '90's should add this typically traditional-swing-mainstream gem to their collections.",1422230400,,1052,5.116959064327485
8318048,4,B001LGXIEM,"This is some real nice live swing jazz from the great clarinet and soprano sax duo of Kenny Davern and Bob Wilber. As a guitarist myself, this is an extra special treat because of the footage in the first set which includes the great George Van Eps on his seven string Gretsch. George's playing is perhaps a bit understated and under-recorded(I deducted one star because the footage was made on a handheld video, moves a couple of times and has less than studio quality sound)but still wonderful to see and hear. And he plays here with the equally great bassist Milt Hinton--The Judge, as he was known. Check out YouTube postings of George and Howard Alden playing in guitar duo,  George was the undisputed king of the seven string and of chordal jazz guitar. Of course, Kenny and Bob are just so musical and swinging . And the other sessions feature Bucky Pizzarelli on guitar(also on a seven string) so it is a double bonus for the guitar fans of jazz and swing.",1363737600,,964,4.572254335260116
8318049,4,B001LGXIEM,This a very nice collection of video from the great soprano sax and clarinet duo Kenny Davern and Bob Wilber at various jazz festivals in 1994-1996. I deducted one star because the video is a bit shaky in a few spots  because of the use of a handheld camera I suspect. What is extra special is the footage of seminal jazz guitarist George Van Eps playing in the first sequence in the band with the group. Also on bass was the great Milt Hinton--The Judge. George plays his Gretsch  Seven String and has several solos in the context of the band. Later Howard Alden released on Youtube a lot of his duo work with George and we love that also. The rest of the video features the great Bucky Pizzarelli with the band so this is a no lose purchase. And of course Bob and Kenny are marvelous and swinging.,1363737600,,799,4.32
