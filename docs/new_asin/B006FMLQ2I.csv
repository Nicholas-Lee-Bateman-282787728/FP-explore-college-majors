8497101,1,B006FMLQ2I,"This dvd is not informative at all, it is clips of the author making bows, and he even says I don't measure it i just eyeball it. this video would not be fit for youtube.",1446854400,,170,3.8857142857142857
8497102,5,B006FMLQ2I,This dvd is great - It takes you step by step on how to make a bow with just hand tools! As close to the way our ancestors did it as you can get. Nice info about the pitfalls and things to watch out for that will ruin a good bow. Got to love those knots in the wood; but Ty explains how to work with and around them. Tough ability to master but if you're going to do it this dvd will help your quest!,1415491200,,400,3.6627906976744184
8497103,1,B006FMLQ2I,This video is short on the details of making a longbow.  There are others that do a better job explaining the process.  I would not recommend this video.,1371945600,4,153,4.428571428571429
8497104,5,B006FMLQ2I,"After watching the Lord of the Rings for the fifteenth time..finally decided to attempt to make a longbow like the one that Elf guy, Legolas, uses.  After watching this guy make his own long bows that are extremely legit, I am trying to make my own following his techniques. While I'm not at nearly the high enough skill level to make an effective and good looking bow..this video is definitely going to get me there with a lot of practice! This guy's approach to teaching and examples on screen make it easy to understand and follow. Preciate it real life Legolas!",1324684800,5,565,4.594059405940594
