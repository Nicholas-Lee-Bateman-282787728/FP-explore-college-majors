7776870,5,B01H4F4IEW,"My absolute favorite show from the Syd & Marty Krofft library. A camp classic inspired by the 60's live action Batman tv show. They truly are the female version of Batman and Robin. Same exciting cliffhangers, awesome gadgets and lair, plus a cool car. Don't forget their loyal associate Frank, a one man Alfred/Commissioner Gordon. And their scary rogues gallery weren't slouches either. Spider Lady was my favorite. There was just something about the Krofft shows in the 70's that were so magical to me and this dvd reminds me of that time. Kudos to Beyond Home Entertainment for making this dvd region free - which is playable in dvd players in the U.S. H.R. Pufnstuf, Land of the Lost and Sigmund and the Sea Monsters are also available by this same manufacturer in Complete Series sets. So happy to finally own the entire Electra Woman and Dyna Girl series. Those remakes cannot compare to the original . P.S. Check out the tribute to Syd & Marty Krofft on the TV Land Awards on youtube where Cyndi Lauper sings the Electra Woman and Dyna Girl theme song dressed as one the show's villains.",1487980800,4,1095,4.678756476683938
7776871,4,B01H4F4IEW,I remember the show I think its a cheep knock off from Batman 1966 tv show but I do like the show that I remember on Saturday morning I just pick up my copy of Batman 1966 tv show at Wal-Mart that I saw there the price is the same like at Amazon.com I do believe I will pick this one up soon on DVD.,1487289600,,299,3.6153846153846154

7776873,1,B01H4F4IEW,Was a total waste of my money.,1484006400,,30,3.4285714285714284
7776874,5,B01H4F4IEW,"Wish it was in HD/Blu-Ray. For me this is pure guilty pleasure. I recall this from my childhood, I doubt I ever caught the entire short run of the series back then but always had a crush on Dyna Girl lol. It's a children's show but I love almost anything from the 70's since I was born in 1966 most of my good childhood memories are of the 70's and my brother passed away in 1979 in a tragic car accident. Pure nonsensical super hero fantasy escapism, low budget children's TV but if taken in the right context it's a fun time for those of that generation.",1484006400,17,556,4.205607476635514
7776875,5,B01H4F4IEW,"Alright kiddies, don your capes and pour yourself a big bowl of sweetened cereal! It's time for Electra Woman and Dyna Girl! Fans of the Saturday morning cartoon lineup of the 70s will enjoy this campy superhero show from the minds of Sid and Marty Krofft. Video transfer to disc is pretty good for this little piece of American television history. Electra Woman and Dyna Girl never looked so good! All 8 original episodes are included here. Enjoy!",1483574400,3,448,4.756410256410256
7776876,5,B01H4F4IEW,"I have waited years for this release and got it in yesterday 11-30-2016 and I loved every minute of it. Looks like someone did a fantastic job on restoring the original footage. Really happy now because at one time the only footage I could find on this show is what seemed to be bad 4th or 5th generation copies on the internet or Youtube but with the new dvd release, its all there and its all great down to the original theme song opening.  First thing I looked at was the bottom of the dvd to see if this was a print on demand disc but looks 100% legit. I would highly recommend this to those who love their childhood nostalgia of the best decade in the world, the 1970's;",1480550400,5,675,4.1923076923076925

7776878,1,B01H4F4IEW,"i watched this growing up and wanted to enjoy this dvd , but the one i received on the corner of the picture,you could see lines while watching .
maybe i received a bad copy ,but i am not happy.",1477180800,5,194,3.875
7776899,5,B01H4F4IEW,I grew up watching this every Saturday morning when I was about 7 years old. I love it then I love it now too bad it only did one season it really should have gotten a second season. It's amazing how much I didn't remember when I watched it the only thing I remember was the theme song I had no idea Cyndi Lauper sung it when she was really young. Dyna girl reminds me of Robin and how she acted. I do recommend this DVD for anybody in their early forties with kids! They gonna love it.,1505520000,,486,3.9693877551020407
7776900,5,B01H4F4IEW,The complete series which was incredibly short - only 8 episodes. Get your fill of Saturday morning nostalgia with this live-action series that is just wall to wall fun.,1505088000,,169,4.862068965517241
7776901,5,B01H4F4IEW,"The World of Sid and Marty Krofft has made great series for Saturday mornings between the late 1960s to the mid 1970s for every late '50s to mid '60s baby boomers to enjoy and this series was one of them. Electra Woman & Dyna Girl was among the few S & M Krofft series that aired the Saturday morning TV screens during the mid '70s. It's all here: 16 episodes[Eight two-parters, that is] packed with fun and excitement. It's a good thing I found this since I got this for my girlfriend who loved shows like this back in the day. I, too, would personally prefer this original version to the current version that was released last year which displeases me whenever they turned on old favorite of a series then make it lame or, worse yet, trashy. So I decided to stick with the original which really makes sense and my girlfriend would also agree. That made her day when I got this for her.
For all you enthusiasts of Sid & Marty Krofft shows, get this today and you'll truly love it.",1503705600,6,981,4.336956521739131
