8640012,5,B00I94KONC,"A sumptuously photographed slice of life drama about a man and his ten year old son coming to terms with a change in their circumstances. The scenery is both stunning and stark in turns. The writing is spot on; it is astutely observed and achingly accurate. And above all, the acting is first rate. It is so natural that you forget that they are actors. Beauty and heartache abound here, and you will love Jojo, and, at times, hate his father Ronald. And you will wonder why Jojo tries so hard to reach his father. And you will wonder where the mother is in all of this. But throughout, your perceptions will be constantly contradicted. And yet the ending is perfect.",1451692800,,667,4.520661157024794
