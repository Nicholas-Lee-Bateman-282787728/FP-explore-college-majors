8357600,1,B0029760WO,Sorry to say a total waste of money.  The woodgrain tutorial is useless.  Not a professional faux video in the least.  It's basically nothing but a Sherwin Williams ad with hardly any useful information beyond the needs of most basic hobbyist.,1414627200,,243,4.878048780487805
8357601,3,B0029760WO,"I could have learned the same information from some free videos on youtube.  The ""instructions"" are very basic.  about 3 minutes worth of woodgrain video total.  I expected a lot more for $20.",1379116800,,192,4.757575757575758
8357602,2,B0029760WO,"I guess I should have paid closer attention to the cover of the DVD on the web page as I didn't realize that the DVD just covered Venetian Plaster, Woodgrain Finishes and Marble Finishes.  I was expecting all of the Faux Finishes to be included such as leather, sand grain, crackle, etc.  For the price of $29.95 I don't feel that this DVD really gives value for money.  The ad for the DVD should highlight better the three areas of Faux Painting featured on it. I was very disappointed.",1299110400,,487,4.449438202247191
8357603,4,B0029760WO,"wood grain tutorials weren't really available in the internet searches so i chose to purchase this dvd. The dvd is really short but tells you what you need to know and exactly the products hes using and generally likes to use.  He will show you quickly how to create a wood grain of no particular species but it will be a wood grain, it kind of looks like cherry ill be using the style on speakers so it will still be pefect for what i bought the dvd for. I believe a person could figure out how to make the grains i listed below if they gave it a good bit of thought with the information he has given. if your looking for oak walnut or maple keep looking because hes doesnt teach  a specific grain; i found a dvd set for multiple types of grains elsewhere but it came out to about $20/grain with all the techniques this dvd was a good price coming out to $10/technique.
it seems hes going to make another dvd on faux topic since this one just came out it may be a while before he makes another one.",1244246400,,999,4.1179487179487175
