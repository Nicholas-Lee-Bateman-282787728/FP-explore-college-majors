1908391,5,B0000AINIV,"Almost everything affects people differently partly because of their life experences.

  Well, I was grown up around Jim Reeves' soothing voice. Uniquely, this voice is for me and happens to be for many others as well.

  Must I try to describe why? I could give it a try, but right now I'm kind of not wanting to, howerever this I'll say.

  Music as a whole is an illusion, it can make you feel all kinds of emotions. And where does it gets you? Maybe no where geographically, but psychicly it can covers millions of emotional distance.

  Some music can just irritate you when you're tired or in some other discontent frame of mind, but I've got to say Mr. Jim Reeves has a voice you might want to stay away from, if you're afraid falling in love with a sentimental and peaceful mode.

  If you have never heard

Jim, and I would even have to asked, ""where have you been?"" just listen to any song emits from his vocal cord, its easy to become a Jim's favorite listener. He's really kind of addictive.",1142294400,29,1003,4.398907103825136
1908392,4,B0000AINIV,"I was so pleased with this DVD on Jim Reeves.  It really showed the man himself in action and his wonderful voice.  It was fun to learn more about him.  However, I would have liked to have more PERSONAL information - like from his wife (what kind of husband he was? Did they have children?).  This DVD is definitely worth the purchase and I plan to play it over and over again.",1109203200,24,377,4.194444444444445
1908393,5,B0000AINIV,"I have been a fan of Jim  Reeves from the very beginning of his career.  Not only does the man have a beautiful voice , he has the ability to reach down into your soul with his music.  I would highly recommend this video for anyone who is a fan and is interested in his biography and music.",989798400,11,290,3.9655172413793105
1908394,4,B0000AINIV,"Good background data on Jim Reeves but, would've been great if more songs were on the playlist at the end of the video.",1406505600,,119,4.217391304347826
1908395,5,B0000AINIV,"On YouTube there are some Gospel Collections of Jim Reeves where you can listen for 2-hrs to just gospel songs. I recently discovered him and found I loved his gospel songs. I just got my DVD yesterday and haven't watched it yet, will update this review later. But wanted to say, since I don't see that anyone else has, that the DVD has a 50-min bio, and also 45-min of songs. It doesn't look like any of the included songs are gospel songs.",1406160000,2,441,4.325301204819277
1908396,3,B0000AINIV,It would better if it could include two other favourates like I LOVE YOU BECAUSE and I WON'T FORGET YOU.,1384732800,,104,4.25
1908397,3,B0000AINIV,"It shows the now non-existent Jim Reeves Museum from 1989-90,which is quite interesting. The bonus videos of Jim singing are good,too,however,the quality is not the very best.",1374451200,,175,5.518518518518518
1908398,3,B0000AINIV,"Great documentary, but with bad bonus material. The 17 full-length songs seem to have been transfered from VHS and are available elsewhere in a much better quality. This is strange, since the archive footage in the documentary looks very nice. In fact Jim's phone booth performance of 'He'll Have To Go' is both in the documentary and in the bonus menu. In the documentary it looks so much better.

The cover of my DVD looks slightly different from the picture on Amazon. On the back of the inlay it says the package design is from e-Digital Design. DVD author is: ITFC. Packaging: DD Home Entertainment.

The 17 bonus songs are:

In A Mansion Stands My Love
Blue Boy
Yonder Comes A Sucker
Scarlet Ribbons
Am I Losing You

1908399,4,B0000AINIV,"Good quality Video for VHS, Disappointed that there was not more video of jim reeves in action, good interviews from those who worked with Jim!",1356825600,,143,4.76
1908400,5,B0000AINIV,"Jim Reeves has always been my utmost favorite singer of all times.  There are a lot of great singers from the past and present, but nobody's voice has made me sigh from the first note to the last of anything he sang.  That voice will never be replicated.  This video is a great prize to have for anyone that is a fan of Jim Reeves.  Although I was astounded to  learn that he was more popular in Africa than he was here.  He most assuredly should have had more fans here and am very grateful to Mary, his wife, for continuing to put out songs he had taped before his untimely death in 1964.",1355961600,2,590,4.131578947368421

7997641,5,B0000AINIV,"The Story of a Legend- How True. It is over 50 years since Jim Reeves was killed in a plane crash. His music lives on but without this incredible movie, few people would remember what the real Jim Reeves was like. The addition of 17 of his best songs is truly a bonus. For anyone who enjoys good music, country music in particular- this DVD is a must. Brilliant.",1461542400,2,362,4.260869565217392

7997648,5,B0000AINIV,"Learned things i didn't know and enjoyed knowing them.
You can't go into any music store with a country section
and not find Jim Reeves and Patsy Cline recordings
They were great.
I happend to be stationed in Japan when Jim died.  I
was attending a show by his cousin Del Reeves and
Del did a good show but you could tell he was very
broken up about Jim's death.  The show has to go on.",1419033600,4,386,4.065789473684211
