Everything about it is outstanding, the music, the audio, the staging, the video, the performers, the musician, the effects, the background movie....damn, everything is excellent! I am surprised that it has not been released in Bluray in the US or broadcast. It is worthy of much wider attention in the US.",1413158400,2,347,5.0

5707534,4,B00C97AXXQ,"I'm a huge fan of Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds. I love the '78 album and the '06 Live on Stage DVD. The update from '06 to '13 is a mainly a bunch of superficial changes. In fact, it's as though they took my personal list of minor things that could've been better with the '06 release and fixed them, but then they continued fixing things, and perhaps went too far. So, my review is a little mixed:

So, the good changes include some spiffier on-stage effects including some impressive pyrotechnics, some much-niftier CG, more interestingly-designed Martians, a new tripod, Jason Donovan's amazing Parson, Ricky Wilson's very charismatic artilleryman, Liam Neeson's awesome holography (because the Richard Burton head from '06 was just downright creepy), some nifty new audio equalizaton (more percussion, more prominent strings in areas), and, lastly, a cool twist to the second epilogue.

...but then, the guy replacing Justin Hayward completely butchered the most iconic song from WotW: Forever Autumn. I mean, I was pretty taken aback at just how awful this guy-- Marti Pellow-- was. In the end, in Dead London, they replaced just him singing the reprisal (""The chances of anything coming from Mars..."") with the entire cast singing it, and I was so grateful, but by then it was too late.

Some other changes-for-the-worse include some of the updating. I appreciate that they're trying to render things more ""steampunk"", but the costume changes are really grating (not everybody in the 19th century wore goggles, and just what are you wearing, Jeff Wayne?) and the bridge piece for ""Brave New World"" is a little jarring-- they took the '06 bridge and modified it a bit for the worse. More importantly, the singer of ""Brave New World"" (the same guy from the CD, Ricky Wilson), couldn't seem to hit the high note (""all over again!""), and it hurt my throat to hear him try. The camerawork is a bit dizzying at times detracting from the really cool CG and pyrotechnics. Another gripe is the ending of ""Spirit of Man"": I'm trying not to spoil anything in this review, but after a character died, there was a really, fantastically cheesy visual effect that destroyed the mood built by the song. Next time, I'm looking away for those ten seconds or so.

One last negative comment: there were added scenes before each act. Both of them were unnecessary, irrelevant, and kinda bad.

So, let me get back to the good. Like the '06 stage version was mostly faithful to the '78 recording, this was mostly faithful to the '12 New Generation CD. It's a good piece to own for anyone who likes the musical. It's beautiful in what it gets right. It's awesome seeing Jeff Wayne grooving while conducting his masterpiece and all the technical achievements that this performance offers. It would've been a blast to see live!

The take-away here: This disc is a necessary addition for any fan. For folks just getting started or who are curiously passing through, I'd recommend the '06 DVD instead. It's got many singers from the original album, and it has a lot more heart.

A note to my fellow Americans: this DVD is Region-2. They haven't released it in the US yet. Don't buy this and gripe that it doesn't work in your DVD players. :)",1397088000,10,3221,4.782374100719425

5707538,2,B00C97AXXQ,"I used to listen to this musical on 8 track, and on every media type since.  I am assuming that all the great reviews for this video (2013 BluRay) were first time viewers of this concert.  I agree totally with the bbrown review, especially concerning Justin Hayward.  I won't re-hash the criticisms, but I do wonder if there is a digital master of the 2007 concert with JH...well duh, they play it on PBS fairly regularly.  So, the question is....where is the 2007 BluRay version?  I don't understand.  Very frustrating.  OK, I will even take a region1 DVD of the 2007 over the BluRay of the 2013 concert. The only way to understand what we nay sayers are talking about is to listen to the original musical or catch the 2007.  If you do, your 2013 BluRay will end up on a table in your next garage sale.",1441238400,4,803,4.378378378378378

5707540,2,B00C97AXXQ,"I'm not sure if people are going to be a little upset with my perspective on this version of War of the Worlds. I owned, and loved, the original 1990 audio of the musical. I say owned because my wife mistook those two CD's as cup coasters. That's a whole other story. So let's move on to the video version. Recently, I saw the 2007 version on TV, truly amazing. I decided to purchase a Blu-ray version of that concert. So, I did order it. Not realizing there were multiple versions, I ended-up purchasing this 2013 version. The quality is excellent, both visually and sonically. No complaints there.

Here's where it all started to go downhill. I didn't realize this version did not include Justin Hayward, lead singer for the Moody Blues. By the way, I have every Moody Blues album up to and including Octave. And when I say album, I do mean album(s). When it came time for Hayward's song, Forever Autumn, I saw a figure walk on stage who clearly wasn't Justin Hayward. He then sang Forever Autumn. I would be very kind in saying his version of Forever Autumn was a disappointment. I just couldn't get past this version of the song. It was like the band Yes not bringing Jon Anderson back into the band. You can't have an essential ingredient like Jon Anderson (and Rick Wakeman) missing from Yes. It's like removing the apples from an apple pie. It might look like an apple pie, but it's not an apple pie.

Justin Hayward is an irreplaceable voice, an essential ingredient to the War of the Worlds musical. That void is clearly difficult to overcome. I realize Hayward can't be around forever, although it would be nice. So, if for whatever reason Jeff Wayne had to replace Justin Hayward it would've been nice if he at least used someone with a similar style of singing to allow for a smooth transition. Unfortunately, he did the opposite. It is mostly because of this, I cannot recommend this Blu-ray version of War of the Worlds. I do have some other quibbles, but what's the point?",1439942400,11,1987,4.5474860335195535

5707544,5,B00C97AXXQ,"First I must state a fair warning that this is region locked for PAL 2,4 (meaning if you live in the US, you will have a difficult time finding a device that will play this DVD). If you do have a way to watch this, however, you are in for a real treat. Probably the finest musical I have ever seen. The music takes you on an out of this world experience and the stage effects brings everything to life; the hologram of Liam Neeson is the icing on this already divine cake. Even if you have no way to watch this, I highly recommend buying it anyways. That's just how good it is!",1427760000,4,577,4.0701754385964914
8578856,4,B00C97AXXQ,"The picture & audio fidelity are all great. The execution is top notch. These things said, the absence of Julie Covington's voice, Justin Hayward's voice & Phil Lynott is notable (understandable, but unfortunate). As much as I enjoy this production, I can't help but wonder how it might come off as more of a Savatage/TSO production than the (Moody Blues-esque/70's flavoured) tone it has. I would enjoy a bit more edge, still, stellar to have a visual interpretation to go with the audio..",1500336000,,490,4.9156626506024095

8578858,2,B00C97AXXQ,Sad. Great staging and major technical improvements over previous stage version can't make up for the loss of Justin Hayward - and the pitiful awkward croakings of the new guy. Don't want to know his name. Should be sent to work on the Trump campaign with other losers.  Shameful.  Awful.  Unlistenable.

8578861,5,B00C97AXXQ,"After a year and a half of trying to piece this musical concert together from YouTube videos, I was thrilled to find it available on bluray. It is, as anyone who is familiar with the album from back in the late 1970's will attest; phenomenal! I only regret it never made it to the states. It must have been a great live experience. One minor quibble: during its many revisions over the ten years of shows, Jeff Wayne had added a beautiful song at the end of the program entitled "" Life Begins Again "". For me, the song added a needed upbeat resolution to the overall piece. A hopeful,happy ending to a story of emotional struggle and survival. The song is sadly missing from the ending as it now stands. Hopefully, should this wonderful show see yet
 another incarnation, he will consider putting this effective and beautiful little moment back in. Still, this is a masterful piece of musical and theatrical entertainment. Thanks, Jeff Wayne.",1476057600,2,942,4.674698795180723
