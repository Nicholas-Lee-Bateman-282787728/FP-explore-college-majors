A dying old lady dying in today's world tells a tail of two brothers in the old west who cross paths and purposes as in most families. We have love, and bullies, and wars. What seems like a fantastic tail that intrigues the listener turns out to be more real than he imagined. Now the listener is on a mission part of which is to carry on the story. And you must carry it from there.",1500595200,,653,3.984732824427481

I realize we all have different tastes in movies.  I rate it on the following. First , the use of four letter words was a little over used. The sex parts seemed just thrown in for shock effect and served no real purpose in the story ( If it had one)The film jumped from  b&w to color and from old times to modern randomly through out. Very disconnected.  More like a Sci-Fi than any other kind of film. I found myself fast forewarding to try and connect the parts in the story, but had no luck. It's a long movie ,so I wasted a evening trying to make some connection with it. The acting was poor and over done as was the gory parts. I decided there was no one I knew who would want to see this movie so opened the lid and cut the tape and threw it in the garbage because thats what it is,  GARBAGE.",1205280000,,926,4.016304347826087

Eventhough he has been educated in the USA, the euro scent is just unbeatable. The time is beggining of the 20th century, protagonits are basicly one 'new world' gunner, and a tough local rebel ... both with no common needs or intentions ...seemingly. On one hand this movie so historical, but at the other, more important one , is so modern. Watch this movie once, and it will hunt you to watch it twice ...or at leste it will force you thinking of it:)",1081814400,,567,4.461538461538462
