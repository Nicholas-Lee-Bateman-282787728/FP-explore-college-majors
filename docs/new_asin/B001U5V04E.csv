3796734,3,B001U5V04E,"Three stars for the excellent singing, good acting, effective use of blu-ray visuals. I haven't seen the regular DVD version but I doubt that in it, Elsa's floral bouquet and dazzling white wedding dress in Act II would have the same impact.

I am afraid that my prejudices and preconceived notions prevent me from accepting anything but a fairy tale version of Lohengrin.  Anything else is just plain silly.  In the accompanying 68 minute documentary, we learn that the aim here was for a ""psychological"" version.  So in the bridal chamber, Lohengrin composes music on a mirror imaged piano, with treble and bass reversed, meaning he is an artist from another universe and the forbidden question is about the true meaning of art.  O brother!  There were plenty of other inanities.  Gottfried is restored to human form as a 9 year old, wearing long undies and just stands there.  Wagner's directions have Elsa dying in his arms, but oh well.  Vogt's Lohengrin seems somewhere between helden-tenor and counter-tenor which indeed does give the title character an other worldly nature.  In the documentary his speaking voice suggests he is a natural baritone or bass.  Maybe the singing voice is supposed to suggest the real reason that Lohengrin doesn't perform on the wedding night (HeHe).

Another star gets docked for the sound balance between soloists, chorus and orchestra.  I chose the lossless 5.1 PCM track.  This is the first time I have had to continually fiddle with the volume and bass controls in a BD.  I rarely do it even with an ordinary DVD opera.  A real effort was made not to cover the singers with the orchestra.  But they over did it.  Now as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau has pointed out, in Wagner, the orchestra carries the melody and the singers ornament it.  In contrast to Italian opera where I concentrate on the singing, I mostly listen to the orchestra in Wagner and in this BD, they sounded like they were behind the stage instead of in front.  It also was a strange effect to hear the chorus making about the same volume of sound as the soloists.

To sum up, I am not sorry about my two day rental of this item but would not buy it and will turn to other versions for my next Lohengrin.",1257465600,12,2212,4.693506493506494
3796735,5,B001U5V04E,"I rarely review items for Amazon, prefering to leave that to others. This production is, however, of such high quality I feel it deserves all the recognition it can get.
Staging is sparse, but appropriate and meaningful to the flow of the story line. Costumes are not necessarily modern, but certainly not 'period correct'. They are very striking though, and lend brilliance to the effect.
The singing is spectacular from all the characters.
Musical direction is first rate. Most of all, the sound and picture quality in Bluray is magnificent.
This is , for my money, the best available version of 'Lohingrin"" available. Wagner's work is allowed to speak for itself, without imposition of any outside agendas. Highly recommended.",1247356800,34,729,5.1344537815126055
8342901,5,B001U5V04E,"These are my impressions after streaming this opera via Amazon Prime.  This production, in glorious HD color and sound, manages to fuse Wagner's inspired score with wonderful singing actors and a great conductor in an unforgettable performance.  All lovers of opera will be inspired and emotionally immersed for its entire 3.5 hour duration.  That such a marvelous experience is free to Prime members is a real blessing.  So invite a friend who shares this passion and watch it with them, it will enhance your pleasure all the more.  Let me repeat for emphasis--""Unforgettable!""",1454544000,,578,5.172043010752688
8342902,5,B001U5V04E,"This production has it's quirks but to date is my favorite. Having purchased a handful of Lohengrins, I've decided this one is my favorite. There is a clean mix of the modern with the traditional---the piano scene is a bit weird---but for the most part it stays true to the intent of the composer.

I am not too picky about the sound quality of a DVD unless it's very poor. Great sound comes from a studio, not a production of singers bouncing around a stage. That said, the sound is decent. The performances are excellent. I would give the singing a solid B+ and the acting an A. The acting in Lohengrin is very important. I doubt Wagner would tolerate sub-standard performance in any area, music, singing or acting. I do think that bad acting can destroy this opera and the acting here conveys the story's deeper meanings very well.

Here's what I mean. Elsa approaches mental imbalance. There is a tension with her character from the beginning.  Is she the virtuous maiden or just a bit nuts? The King's herald is appropriately aloof and sterile. He serves as the referee between myth and reality. The king seems really conflicted. War is breaking out and he's got this divided territory and he must rule on whether Elsa is nuts or Friedrich is working a ploy. We feel the tension. The king looks conflicted unlike in other productions I've seen, this king looks really torn. Then this knight shows up. Is he really a good guy? The king asks that question---and in this production, he has the look of Montezuma.  Is this the return of the god-knight or some evil force? Meanwhile, Ortrud is blowing a gasket and conjuring up anything to help Friedrich prevail. The closing of Act 1 really is a mad house scene. It's beautiful. There is a coming together, an agreement, but it's chaos too as Ortrud shrieks, Friedrich crawls  off, Elsa is smitten, our magic knight croons and the king, at the top of his lungs, is basically singing ""Let's get on with things!""

The other DVDs seem to dilute this very weird opera. They either stage it so screwy the original philosophy is lost, or it's so bland it ends up a watered down Arthurian story. This is a profound treatise on good, evil, virtue and conflict. In my opinion, the DVD allows those themes to play out. I liked it.",1406592000,2,2271,4.58128078817734
8342903,5,B001U5V04E,"I have been collecting opera and classical music on video for over 5 years now ... and this particular offering from Opus Arte is as good as any.  Coinciding with the 200th anniversary of Wagner's birth, 2013 has been the year I finally learn to appreciate his musical genius (even though I've been aware for decades of his influence on one of my favorite composers, Gustav Mahler).

This production of Lohengrin, along with the Meier/Barenboim/La Scala Tristan und Isolde from 2007, are among the treasures in my collection.

The entire cast is excellent, both musically as well as dramatically, especially Waltraud Meier, who is brilliantly captivating (as always) in her role of Ortrud.

The production is somewhat minimalist, but the staging is nonetheless visually pleasant.  Costumes are essentially modern although generic and do not distract from the experience.

Technically, the glorious musical accompaniment blends in beautifully with the singers' performances to provide a top-notch HD 5.1 PCM audio mix ... the blu-ray video is equally outstanding.",1390521600,,1062,5.367469879518072
8342904,4,B001U5V04E,"With a discussion of the production included in the DVD as well as in the notes, this production makes sense: 19th century, psychological, from the view point of Elsa. I thought that the Lohengren was weak while the other singers more than passible, with attention given to the acting.",1359158400,,285,4.836734693877551
8342905,3,B001U5V04E,"A brilliant, imaginative production of Wagner's most popular opera. Excellent singing, faithful conducting, superlative direction and great video management. My only quibble is with the sound engineers: the orchestra sounds as if it is in the next room, with the singers set well forward on the sound stage, relegated to a secondary, accompanying role rather than an equal partner with the vocalists. A pity: but for that imperfection this would be the best Lohengrin in the catalog. This is not a version for audiophiles.",1307318400,12,522,5.226190476190476
8342906,5,B001U5V04E,"This romantic opera from the end of Wagner's early period, just before embarking on his more mature work, is rather more conventional and accessible than, for example, the romance of Tristan und Isolde, but by the same token Lohengrin doesn't have the conceptual weight of later Wagner dramas.  The characters are rather one dimensional, divided quite clearly as being on the side of light or darkness, and the score is not as refined as later Wagner.  On the other hand, there are some wonderful singing roles, some dynamic scoring that colours the difference between the physical and the spiritual, a terrific drama, and of course the opera is of great interest for the thematic links it has with the composer's more celebrated works, to say nothing of the fact that the traditional Wedding March originates from this opera.

Lohengrin starts off like a courtroom drama, but it's one that, being a Wagner opera, is dressed up in regal grandness, heroic declamations and with a strong element of ancient Teutonic mythology underlying it all.  On the eve of going to war against Hungary, King Heinrich calls a tribunal meeting to settle a dispute that has arise over the territory of Brabant.  Friedrich von Telramund has accused Elsa, the daughter of the late Duke of Brabant, of murdering Gottfried, her brother and the rightful heir to Brabant.  Elsa defends her position and calls on a heroic knight of her visions to take up arms and defend herself in combat against Telramund.  Her knight in shining armour (quite literally) cannot reveal his name, and begs her not to ask of it, but it transpires - no surprise here since it is the title of the opera - that he is Lohengrin, the son of Parsifal, guardian of the Holy Grail, who is himself the subject of Wagner's final opera.  The themes of this opera deal similarly - if not quite as abstractly - with questions of virtue, purity and innocence, but above all here with the noble virtues of complete love and unconditional trust.

Nikolaus Lehnhoff's 2006 production for the Festspielhaus Baden-Baden, conducted by Kent Nagano, brings a new dimension to those themes.  His use of the stage, as ever, is simply magnificent, the use of props minimal, the sets nonetheless majestic and impressive, yet simple and not overly ornate.  The stage is immaculately lit, balancing light and shade, foreground and background, using colours to highlight and give appropriate emphasis.  Whatever angle you look at this from - and the cameras do a fine job in their coverage - the stage and the positions of the characters within achieves maximum impact.  At the same time, by making the period non-specific, although certainly more modern than its middle-ages origins, Lehnhoff downplays the fairytale trappings of a heroic knight borne on a chariot drawn by a wild swan (as well as leaning it well away from any troubling National Socialist conceptions that could be applied to the themes), while still remaining true to the opera and its purpose, without over-emphasising or lessening the impact of its musical strengths.

Solveig Kringelborn's Elsa doesn't have quite the power of the other singers, nor indeed does Klaus Florian Vogt's Lohengrin, but the nature of their characters is purer than the others, with a bond of trust between them that their counterparts Ostrund and Telramund do not possess, and consequently their voices are softer - more angelically toned than the more typical Wagnerian heldentenor in the case of Lohengrin - but clear, ringing and forceful where required.  Tom Fox, as Telramund and Waltraud Meier as Ostrund are however terrific, playing their baddies to the hilt and with delightfully over-the-top almost pantomime eye-rolling madness in the case of Meier's sorceress - both perfectly appropriate nonetheless for this particular opera and for roles that shouldn't be underplayed.  Kent Nagano conducts the Deutsches Symphonic-Orchester of Berlin for similar dramatic force, but the dynamic and subtle tones are there also, brought out in the fine PCM surround sound mix that comes on the Blu-ray.

The Blu-ray quality cannot be faulted either on its image quality, or the manner in which it is filmed.  It captures perfectly the qualities of the stage sets and the lighting and allows you to get right up close with the performers.  A 68 minute documentary is also included on the 2-disc set which looks at the opera and its staging in some detail with interviews from most of the principals involved, but it is overlong in its walk-through description of the plot, extensively illustrated with scenes from the opera.  Kent Nagano however provides interesting analysis on the tone and complexities of the score, particularly in the preludes to each of the three acts.",1298592000,14,4750,5.026751592356688
8342907,4,B001U5V04E,"This is one of the best performances of Lohengrin available in video. Nagano's conducting, the playing of the orchestra, the singing of the chorus and the vocal performances are as near perfection as one might expect. Klaus Florian Vogt in the tile role is a revelation: he is handsome, which suits the role, and his voice is the sweetest I have heard as Lohengrin. The rest of the cast is also excellent; Waltraud Meier one of the best Ortruds I have ever heard. As for the staging, I have some difficulties in accepting modern stagings of Wagner's operas. It is difficult to associate what is being sung (the story of the opera, which, in the case of Lohengrin, include witchcraft, adoration of old Gods, a character who comes from the sacred realms of the Grail) to the modern clothes worn by the characters and the chorus. It is also strange to see Lohengrin sitting at the piano composing while the bridal chorus is sung. Is the character a composer or a knight coming from Montsalvat? By the way, I did not understand why the bridal chorus was not entirely sung; the second part was ommitted, and first one was not repeated. In spite of my complaints, this is a wonderful version of this opera with first class image and sound, though I would like to have DTS HD Master Audio or Dolby True HD track instead of 5.1 PCM.",1275782400,16,1324,4.543933054393306
8342908,5,B001U5V04E,Wagner operas are never easy to cast and produce. The length and technical demands place huge restrictions on all areas and compromises are almost inevitable. Not in this case however. I thought this production was just magnificent. Updated somewhat but without the dreaded DJs and discount store rejects so many producers seem to favour these days. The picture and sound quality are demonstration and the casting is superb. Not a weak link anywhere. For the first time I felt Lohengrin flowed with life and logic and I enjoyed it so much I immediately sat through it a second time. For anyone wanting to try out a Wagner opera this is the perfect choice. For Wagner fans and Lohengrin addicts in particular do not hesitate. If only we could get a Ring done to the same standard.,1266278400,6,779,4.735294117647059
8342909,5,B001U5V04E,"I completely and thoroughly enjoyed this production and DVD !  If you are hung up on some antiquated idea of Wagner's operas, you may be entirely at a loss.  For myself, the INTELLIGENT and THOUGHTFUL updating of this old warhorse was enlightening and a delight.  The acting by all is first rate - as is the singing!  The orchestra was right on !  My only regret is that seeing what can be done to make Wagner's hack stories relevant to today will ruin any future Ring, etc. for me.  This is not only the best Lohengrin on DVD - it might be the best Wagner available today ... and probably for some years to come.  With over two dozen complete Rings under my belt, dare I hope that such a considered and inspiring team as represented on this Lohengrin might consider the Ring!  We can only hope!",1265241600,6,795,4.360544217687075

The performance was a marvel.. Strong performances by all major participants... and the clarity and brilliance of sound made me feel that I was right there at a live performance'''- Better than being there , actually-
