8220300,4,6305293872,"Okay. This tape was a little different from the first tape. The first episode was more like they get a vacation and it's at that beach. It was little sad, because Carrot was used by a girl. The next episode is sad too. Carrot met this girl named Lake, but I don't want to give the flat line. The last episode is where they have another mission asigned by Big Momma. It was about the love bewteen a brother and a sister. Also Marron gets a little scary near the end. It was the different from the first volume, because there weren't those little looking triangle things on the socerer's foreheads, but there really was only one sorcerer in the whole tape. It's funny as the first one, oh yeah, and Carrot gets hit on the head alot. You got to get this tape. You'll enjoy it!",1003968000,,773,4.26530612244898
8220301,3,6305293872,"What? Only three stars? Yeah, that's right. As much of a Bakuretsu Hunter  nutso as I am, I had to rate this one down a little bit. The three episodes  on this tape are very similar to those on the first. They've got the humor,  the scantily clad women, the perversion, and all the other things I've come  to love about this anime. So why three stars? Well, basically, it's 'cause  there's no plot! As in the preceding volume, each episode is a self  contained individual story with no real effect on any of the others. That  was fun in the first tape because we got to meet the characters and  experience their crazy antics. But by the fourth or fifth episode, I want  some plot! ^_^
As for the episodes, here goes. In episode 4, 'Fireworks  Competition of Love', the Hunters get a day off at the beach! Carrot meets  a lovelorn young girl who wants her to meet him later that evening (ooh la  la!). Carrot gets excited, but Tira and Chocolate aren't too pleased...  Next is episode 5, 'A Lovely Girl at Lakeside' in which Carrot meets a  little girl at a hidden lake. While she seems perfectly nice, Marron  discovers that his brother may be in danger... Then there's episode 6,  'Heresy of Love is Crystal'. Finally, an episode with a Sorcerer to beat  up! ^_^ However, it's not as simple as finding the sorcerer and being done  with him, not when he wants his sister back. And all the bishonen hunters  will be happy - it stars Marron! Wahoo...
All in all, I liked it! The  stories get a little more intelligent (but still no plot! ^_^) and were  very entertaining. If you don't really care much about plot, and you just  wanna laugh your bum off, this'll be good for you. And if you're a  Bakuretsu loon like me, then you should buy it too...",964656000,2,1747,4.373831775700935
8220302,5,6305293872,This is a funny video for teenagers and is histerical.  Its about a group  of people who kill sorcerers.  But its funny because of Carrot. He is  perverted and is always after a girl.  I give it a 5 star rating because of  the first episode when Carrot was chasing girls and I would find out that  he would go through anything for love.,961632000,,336,4.15625
8220303,3,6305293872,"The first episode on this tape was one I liked because it was funny how the two girls, Chocolate and Tira, kept torturing poor Carrot. The end of the 1st episode was also nice because it showed Carrot's dedication to  helping out a friend in need. He was triumphant in the end because he did  get to the girl to help her set off the fireworks, despite all the  obstacles in his way. Also, I think the 2nd episode on this cassette was  the best on the tape. In ""A Dreamy Girl at Lakeside"", Carrot  meets a little girl at a lake and shows humility and kindness by  entertaining the child and doing everything to make her happy. Throughout  the whole episode, the girl visits Carrot and he is always able to identify  her, even though it only takes her hours to become years older. The third  episode on the cassette was a disappointment. It was dull and wishy-washy.  But all in all, this volume was pretty good!",955670400,,910,4.363095238095238
8220304,3,6305293872,"Sorcerer (Bakuretsu) Hunters is a really awsome series -- there's a lot of humor blended in with just enough action as well as sword and sorcery.  Volume 2 was really good; just as hilarious as the rest of the series.  Still, I think Volume 1 was better by far.",948153600,,261,4.3061224489795915
