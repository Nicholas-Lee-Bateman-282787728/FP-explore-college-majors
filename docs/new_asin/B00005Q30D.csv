7949644,3,B00005Q30D,"I had great expectations of this film due to my great interest in Cimarosa's operatic adaption of this play, ""Il matrimonio segreto"".  The acting was top notch, the farce and satire well played if a little on the gentle side for a Rococo comedy of errors such as this.  Collins did a great job in her role as the overbearing aunt but the performance was tainted by what sounded like a re-dub of her lines in post production.  The production itself, from costumes, to interiors, to the exterior gardens is respectful of the times.  The narrative action propels forward relatively well with little to no hold-ups.

In conclusion, I would have to say that my expectations where a bit over stretched.  I prefer Cimarosa's adaption to this film because of the poignancy that this composer is able to place on the imbroglio of the plot.  Even though there are far less characters in ""Il matrimonio segreto "" and the action is thinned by recitative and show piece aria's, the theatricality of opera allows for developmental scenes like the fist and second finales that you can't quite reproduce in this kind of film.  Therefore I would suggest that anyone who enjoys this classic play give Cimarosa's opera a go; you may be surprised at how much you enjoy it as well.",1179532800,3,1260,4.695454545454545
7949645,5,B00005Q30D,"Anyone familiar with the English and French farce plays of the 16th-18th centuries will again revel in the delicious twists and turns of this excellently crafted comedy of misguided and unrequited loves and passions. In a day when family marriage contracts were the accepted norm for wealthy families to keep and create more capital for themselves,thus retaining their respectibility and place in Society,the Noblemen Lord Ogelsby,too, hopes to secure his families'fortune,nearly now in bankruptcy,by marrying his son,John,into the Sterling family via the eldest daughter,Betsy. Upon arrival at the Sterling Estate, Ogelsby  and his son both fall madly in love with Betsy's sister,the ever-lovely Fanny,who is clandestinely already married to Lord Sterling's clerk,Lovewell. To tell you more is to unveil all of the hidden and secretive motives and behaviour of all of the scheming players in this piece. A MUST FOR ALL PERIOD PIECE LOVERS! The film NEVER drags and clocks in at a brisk 87 minutes of wild fun and frolic. The soundtrack composed by Stanislas Sgresvicz is an absolute MUST for lovers of fine film composition,not to mention the lovely end-credits song,SECRETS,sung by MIRIAM.

The cast is SO easily recognizable to anyone who is a devotee of both film  AND live theatre. Of note:the role of the head housekeeper,Mrs. Tersey,is played by Jenny Galloway known for her role in LES MISERABLES:THE MUSICAL in London. Other performers of note are Emma Chambers of THE VICAR OF DIBLEY fame,Nigel Hawthorne from THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE,Timothy Spall from NICHOLAS NICKELBY and Natasha Little of VANITY FAIR.Everyone already knows Joan Collins who plays with frivolity and her now famous bitchiness Lord Sterling's ""nouveau riche-acting"" sister,Lady Heidelberg.

Great COMPANION FILMS to view that are similar in time frame and subject matter are TRIUMPH OF LOVE,VATEL,THE SERPENT'S KISS,A MIDSUMMER'S NIGHT DREAM,PRIDE AND PREJUDICE,VANITY FAIR  and ultimately GILBERT and SULLIVAN's H.M.S.PINAFORE.",1169856000,9,2010,5.555555555555555
7949646,3,B00005Q30D,"Not bad at all - a movie starring Joan Collins always has the possibility of being a dicey affair, and she may have produced and starred in this one, but that doesn't stop it from being a charming, mannered comedy of errors. Collins has some big ol' surprises up her sleeve for us - for her first trick, she does not play Alexis Carrington, or any variation on her, in this movie. And, as if that weren't earth-shattering enough, she - I kid you not - plays a woman approximately her own age, who also looks her age. That's right, no black eyeliner and no raven tresses. It is amazing. Don't get me wrong, though - we're still dealing with Joan Collins here, so she's still pretty glam, in her own way, and certainly her character is as over-the-top as any Joan Collins character is supposed to be - but she actually acts as part of an ensemble in which she is not center stage at all times. Nigel Hawthorne, who excelled in *The Madness of King George*, capably plays her elderly brother in this English period piece of arranged marriages and un-arranged marriages. Set in a spectacular 17th century country estate, Stanway House, with all the requisite gorgeous accoutrement, the film does exceptionally well on what was obviously not an enormous budget. The costumes, hair and makeup are beautiful, and though the story gets somewhat messy in the middle of the film, the cinematography and art direction keep the eye glued to the screen. The supporting cast also serves the film well, with a variety of skilled actors who make the best out of minor roles. It is a fun movie to watch and it looks like the kind of movie that the cast and crew had a great deal of fun making. This is a valuable quality that is imparted in the finished product, and makes it easy to overlook any weaknesses.",1106438400,10,1791,4.530864197530864
7949647,3,B00005Q30D,"I loved the roles of Mr. Lovewell and Fanny. I assume having a secret marriage in a London prison was as desperate an attempt for young couples without their pesky guardians knowing about it. I loved the costume design on this film and the house was just beautiful. However, I seem to notice that on these British films, the picture is different from regular movies and they should have given the film that clear imago. The lines were hard to follow along and I sure wishthe DVD would provide english subtitles so we could follow along. But where so many men fall in love with Fanny and she's already sold, makes it harder for both the young couple. I loved Lord Ogleby's character. He's played with such innocence and brilliant light. I hate Mrs. Heidelberg! She should have been exiled from the house and she's an odious demonic evil creature herself and I dislcaim Mrs. Heidelberg as a top likeable character!",1099267200,5,912,4.670807453416149
7949648,4,B00005Q30D,"Nigel Hawthorne's adapation of the classic Garrick-Colman play is a delight. Wonderful ensemble acting and period flair--including beautiful shots of eighteenth-century landscape that bring Pope's poem ""On the Use of Riches"" to mind. And there are wonderful touches such as the turnspit dog in the kitchen juxtaposed with Mrs. Heidelberg's lapdog--there's the century summed up for you!",1035158400,8,386,5.7894736842105265
