1126207,5,7884063387,"Released in Japan in 1984, Nausica explores many of the themes later visited in Princess Mononoke, and proved highly influential to modern day anime, from plot elements to even the mecha design (the ""Evas"" from the series Neon Genesis Evangelion, considered by many to be the best anime released to date).  This film is certainly no mecha anime; the young princess Nausica finds herself torn between her people, mankind, and nature, the brutal, ascendant force on earth after the fall of man.  Is humanity doomed to extinction, or is the equilibrium that Nausica espouses the ultimate answer?  Nausica herself is a blend of Greek heroine and nature-loving adolescent, and strongly foils the other, Machiavelian characters.  Though in a post apocalyptic future, Nausica feels little like Mad Max and more like primordial civilization as seen in Princess Mononoke.  Hayao Miyazaki goes into even more depth and creates an even more epic tale in the manga (graphic novel) Nausica, so if you cannot wait, look it up.  An incredible story, it is unfortunate that Disney has not decided upon a full theatrical release...",1082678400,6,1114,5.12707182320442
1126208,2,7884063387,"I would disagree with many who would say that this is one of Miyzazaki's best works.  Nausicaa is not a bad movie, but it is most certainly not Miyazaki's best movie.  It possesses many of the traits that many have come to love in Miyazaki's movies: fantastic worlds, original creatures, real people.  However, nothing seems to work as well in this early work.  The bizarre creatures and plants would be more at home in a B-movie sci-fi flick; they seem more silly than enchanting.  The character will seem to be very similar to the familiar characters of Miyazaki's later movies, but they seem to have less depth than other Miyazaki's movies.  The strong-willed princess seems less a human being and more an archetype.  The villains do not possess the same kind of human quality that other Miyazaki villains have; they are just leering vicious, two-dimensional bullies.  Similarly the moral lessons lose any kind of impact because they demonstrate a black and white attitude to the subject manner, and furthermore the whole environment has been created as a contrivance to validate the moral argument.  How is one supposed to take a lesson about conservation to heart when the deck is blatantly stacked to prove the point.  Princess Mononoke succeeded in its message because it showed, in addition to the importance of nature, how human technology and progress can help people when used with sound judgement.  Lady Eboshi who led the forces of Irontown was far more human than the villainess in Nausicaa.  Princess Mononoke showed that there are no easy answers.  Overall I believe that Nausicaa should be seen as nothing more than an early work by Miyazaki; a prototype for the Princess Mononoke masterpiece that would succeed in every way that Nausicaa failed.",1082505600,11,1763,4.976109215017065
1126209,5,7884063387,"This is the movie that started it all. Without this, Hayao Miyazaki wouldn't be where he is today. There would be no ""Princess Mononoke"" or ""Sprited Away"".
(ok , maybe that's wrong. But wouldn't be as big as they are)
  ""Nausicaa"" has all the ingredients a Miyazaki movie needs. Beautiful pictures, rich human characters, complex but highly relatable and understandable themes, amazing imaginations made into reality (almost.. But you likely will forget that you are watching a ""CARTOON"") , great music by legendary Joe Hisaishi, and above all this, the flying sequences!  There's no good or bad in this story. There are people just like us trying to survive on the edge of collapse. Even though it takes place in distant future (2000 years later), you can see the same is happening in today's world.
  This was made 20 years ago, so that the graphics maybe a little primitive compareing to his later work. But I know you will be totally sucked into it once the openning credits starts. ( Be aware of the openning theme tune, too. It's hauntingly beautiful )
  Mr. Miyazaki reportedly isn't as fond of this movie as his fans are, because of the religious imagery in the end. But If you liked his other work, This movie is a MUST SEE!  I'm very happy that It's finally going to be released in the states, and the rest of the world (I assume?), because this movie carries a very important message, especially since the state of the world now is more alarming than ever. Also because I get to see it again!

 Thank you Disney.  Can't wait 'til August.  But I wish this would be released in the theatres.",1081728000,16,1600,4.614840989399293

1126704,4,7884063387,"This movie was honestly great. I have not watched an animated movie in quite a while but although this one is old it is one of the best movies I have seen. The plot of the film was very interesting. I was really impressed with the art work in the movie because I found out that it was all hand made. This film wasn't just like any other animated film, it was one with a message. The message that the film was trying to give was also very interesting to me. The environment is very important, and the film shows how important in can be to some in comparison to others. It also attempts to make people realized that taking care of the environment should be a priority because we depend so much on it. Although the film is animated the Japanese director, Hayao Miyazaki, aimed to tackle some real-life issues with his movie. One of them being war and the other being pollution. The deeper meaning of the movie is what makes this film so great. I honestly recommend this movie to anyone because besides it being a great film it gives a really good message and it could change ones perspective on world issues. I wouldnt recommend it for very young ones because the film does portray the use of guns and it has some violence in it but it sure would be a great movie for those who are a bit older and in presence of adults.",1522540800,,1317,4.272

1126707,3,7884063387,"I have always had a love for anime! this movie was extremely interesting and what I expected. Lohman gave the viewers an interesting topic about a princess who was stuck between doing the right thing for her people or doing what is expected. feeling so wrong about loving whats totally unapproved by most of the people. the usual war within other nations and trying to test who is the most powerful. I loved this new storyline of her going against other nations AND creatures that look like large caterpillars/maggots with colored glowing eyes making it hard for the viewers to feel sympathy for them like Nausicaa does adds more and shows her caring and loving character a lot more. as this is happening, they are in an environmental crisis. As much as I enjoyed this anime film, I felt as though it was too political for me. either I was analyzing it too much or it just stood out, I was always aware of why Lohman added certain scenes to back up their meaning. as most films should have a super objective, some of them took away from the film itself. I felt constantly reminded of the environmental issues happening and discrimination a minority group. as well as the film itself being predictable, I was almost certain of the next move in the film, perhaps this comes from watching older anime films but i was slightly disappointed at how predictable such an interesting was going to make her next move.",1522108800,,1407,4.632

1126867,4,7884063387,"I did not expect this animated film to be interesting based on the beginning of the film. I mean giant bugs and old-fashioned voices didn't leave a great first impression in my opinion. Maybe because I was tired when I first saw it But I didn't know it would be so well put together.
I was proven wrong when I watched this animated film when I was trying to understand the concept behind this film.  I like how Nausicaa is a strong female character that was able to do what was needed to be done without having to rely on a love interest. What I received while watching this film was that the Omes were there to purge the earth and get rid of all toxins for the sake of the environment. Although the omes themselves produced spores that were toxic to the human race they were helping the environment that the human race destroyed with war and greed. The whole concept of the Omes was admirable and the princess Nausicaa who had such a big heart to be able to understand everyone even an enemy is even more admirable. If I was put in that place I don't think I would have been able to have such an open heart to help the enemy who is trying to destroy anything in their path. The film is well constructed and animated and I would recommend.

1126868,4,7884063387,"After watching Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind for my college English class, I was glad to have seen the movie! I enjoyed the animation, the subliminal messages, and the inclusion of a strong women as the lead. Hayao Miyzaki uses Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind in order to talk about world issues such as pollution and classism. The Valleys princess, Nausicaa is kind hearted and beautiful while also being strong willed and determined. Nausicaa definitely was my favorite character. In addition, I also enjoyed the character Asbel who helped Nausicaa fight for what she believes in. Asbel went against his own tribe in order to do what was right, which I found honorable. I will say however, in the beginning the movie did start a little slow for me. I wish the movie was a little more entertaining in the beginning but I will say the ending of the movie made up for its slow start. Maybe Im just a huge animation fan which made me enjoy the movie so much. Overall, I would definitely recommend the film to anyone.",1521936000,,1022,4.559782608695652

1126871,5,7884063387,"Hayao Miyzaki never disaapoints! Such an excellent animated film, really had me feeling multiple emotions. The Valley's princess, Nausicaa has such a genuine kind heart for the people of her village and yet truly a ferocious warrior who is so skillful and has mastered flight and weaponry. We Cannot forget about Lord Yupa, easily my favorite character in the film, a matchless swordsmanship with wise character and loyalty to his village. But the storyline truly brings out a powerful message as the film shows reminiscent actions of WWII and destruction of environment and pollution which to me, really sets out the tone of the film. I really enjoyed the psychosomatic animation and loads of action warships throughout the film, truly brought out an excitig feel that gave the film so much detailed brilliance. This film gets 5 stars from me, and I don't really enjoy watching movies but I could not get enough of the desirable action!",1521676800,,937,4.974522292993631

1126873,4,7884063387,"I saw the film Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind in my English class. At first i thought it was weird because of the way it is seen but then I remembered it was hand drawn and that the artist actually did a great job. The plot was unclear at first but it slowly got interesting when I understood what was going on. I liked Nausicaas character very much, and so did everyone in her valley. She was the perfect princess. She was kind, caring, adventurous, smart , honest and loyal. The valley was like her family, she cared for it very much and wanted nothing but the best for it. She saw things in a different way than anyone else. In the film the world is infected with big toxic insects. Everyone saw the insects as a threat, as something bad. Nausicaa saw them as animals, and hated when they got hurt. She was very good at problem solving, any time the valley or a person in need had an issue she would quickly think of a solution and save the day. The whole bugs taking over idea was cool to see, but I did not like that how it happened was not mentioned. It is still unclear to me how the insects turned to be so big. Besides that, I liked the film a lot, the plot was cool and interesting to watch. If someone likes movies about different kind of worlds than this film would be a good choice.",1521331200,,1299,4.138339920948616
1126874,4,7884063387,"Being a big fan of anime film, I could really respect Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. The only reason I would not give this movie a 5-star rating is that I am a really big fan of Hayao Mizayaki's Spirited Away, and I expected more from Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. I also watched the dubbed version which I am usually not a fan of. What I enjoyed about the movie was how Hayao Mizayaki was able to tackle subjects of gender and environmental awareness while still being able to make an engaging story. It held a lot of important life lessons that was relevant in the world during that time and even till this day. It is timeless. Also, the animation was absolutely outstanding. It was way ahead of its time, with its close attention to detail every frame felt like a work of art. I also enjoyed the cast, it was diverse and had many dimension to them. The movie included action, adventure, likable characters, etc, which keeps the audience captivated for the whole movie. Though at times, the story seemed kind of slow and predictable. Still, the movie had an enchantment with its elements effortlessly moving along together. This movie subconsciously represents what was happening in the world at that moment (nuclear bombing on Japan), while still taking elements of science fiction to make a great anime film. I very much enjoyed this film, and looking forward to watching the original Japanese version of it.",1521244800,,1440,4.673228346456693

1127131,5,7884063387,"This movie is an amazing description of how people should come to the realization of how much of an impact we have on the planet. We are slowly polluting our word past recovery and people that make money off of their harmful businesses would do anything to keep their industry in power. Greed has gone past the result of caring for the future of our own civilization. The movie even touches upon racial divisions that are happening in our world without even having to fully being about racial division. Sadly the film hasn't recently come out and therefore doesnt have much publicity that can actually carry out the important messages that are presented in this amazing movie. Some people may not like the anime style that the movie is made with but the story can honestly sway those that haven't really gotten into this style of animation. Nevertheless this movie can open some peoples eyes to the darker side of innovation through methods of destructive production, and continuous use of non renewable fuels such as gas to power cars. Even though the film was made over 10 years prior to me watching it, it still carries the a lot of weight that It did back then today. Good movies are meant to outlast the current climate that they were made into truly be considered an iconic film and I truly believe that this one really does. I highly recommend taking the time out of your day to watch this movie and it has really opened my perspective on witch way the world is heading",1520812800,,1476,4.59469696969697
1127132,4,7884063387,"For someone is not into anime films, Nausicaa was pretty good. The idea behind this film was regarding the environment. this film was created in 1984 and what I found amazing after watching it was that it had all been hand drawn. Point is that you really got to see how someone can really care for their environment and Nausicaa played this role of a teenage girl who was like some type of science nerd because when she figured out that the toxins where from the soil was pretty cool of her. One weird thing in which it took me time to get use to were those creepy crawling bugs. Everyone else hated them but not Nausicaa. She was an animal lover. Her characteristics is something I found empowering and the people of her valley loved her. She was always brave and kind to all. she loved her Valley and during the film it had been the only town to not have gotten the toxic soil yet due to the wind. The wind was something that all the people in the town were very thankful for. there was a point though that the valley of the wind was in trouble because the wind had stopped. this was very bad because it meant that the toxins of the jungle would definitely spread over and would have killed all those lives who had been living there forever.  even after all the good and then all the bad the overall outcome was good because Nausicaa as always solved the problem without any violence, nor negativity. The moral of the movie was based on a time of history and that there is ways to solve even the worst of problems without the use of violence.",1520640000,,1544,4.305841924398625

1127135,2,7884063387,"I did not find this movie to be interesting. The story seemed forced and got boring very fast for me. When they tried to fill in on the background story it seemed out of place jumbled because they kept adding in random fact. I also felt that some scenes where over dramatic and went on for way too long. They also had so many important charters that looked similar it was hard to tell who was who. Even though I don't enjoy this artistic expression I do give much respect to the artist as it very good work. You can tell that the artist spent there time picking the colors and focusing on making them flow. To me this is the only thing this movie has going for itself. I would not recommend this movie to my friends or watch it again. I also find the political message behind this movie to be over the top. It was extremely hard to find a copy in English and wasn't worth the hunt. The movie didn't have me wanting to keep watching. It was a movie where you get up to get something , but you don't pause it. Just because it was made by a well know animator doesn't mean it will be good.

The differences overall are noticeable in PQ, but are not night and day, though without a doubt I prefer the look of the GKids version. I would say it looks around 15-20% better.

1127816,4,7884063387,"Anyone who is a fan and lover of animation has (and should) seen at least one film by Studio Ghibli, and its acclaimed writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki. His beautiful and stunning movies are known the world over, and has inspired artists everywhere. But although I've grown up with many of his films, there ARE still a few I have yet to see for various reasons. And I'm embarrassed to say this was one of them. For how famous this film is, it's only now that I'm finally watching it. And the journey I was taken on was nothing short of breathtaking and introspective.

One thousand years have passed since the Seven Days of Fire, an apocalyptic war that destroyed civilization and created the vast Toxic Jungle, a poisonous forest swarming with giant mutant insects. In the kingdom of the Valley of the Wind, Nausica, the princess, explores the jungle and communicates with its creatures, including the gigantic, insect-like armored Ohm. She hopes to understand the jungle and find a way for it and humans to co-exist.  But  one night, a cargo aircraft from the kingdom of Tolmekia crashes in the Valley. Its sole passenger, Princess Lastelle of Pejite, pleads with Nausica to destroy the cargo and dies. The cargo is an embryo of a Giant Warrior, one of the lethal humanoid bio-weapons that caused the Seven Days of Fire. Tolmekia, a military state, seized the embryo and Lastelle from Pejite, but their plane was attacked by mutant insects and crashed. The next morning, Tolmekian troops, led by Princess Kushana, invade the Valley of the Wind, kill Nausica's father and capture the embryo, with Kushana planning to mature the Giant Warrior and use it to burn the Toxic Jungle. But Nausicaa knows there's more to the Jungle and its inhabitants than what meets the eye, and with the help of the friends she makes along the way from each of the three kingdoms, it's up to her to make everyone understand that humanity will have to somehow make peace with nature if they're to survive.

The visuals and animation, as per usual in a Miyazaki film, are utterly breathtaking to look at and watch. The amount of sheer detail put into every background and character movement is incredible, and the various magical creatures are imaginative and unlike anything you've ever seen before in a fairy tale, from giant insects to fantastic flying machines. All the characters are well developed and/or three dimensional, mainly Nausicaa herself, who can be reasonably afraid of certain danger, but is extremely brave and resourceful, and uses her knowledge of nature to help the rest of humanity understand just how much they've abused the environment. She believes in the value of life regardless of its form, and through her actions, stops a war.

The English dub voice cast also does a fantastic job. Most, if not all the actors, fall into their roles perfectly. The only hang up I have is with Patrick Stewart. He IS a phenomenal actor, and his voice work is fantastic....but his voice is just so recognizable, it can get just a teeny bit distracting (but that's my own problem, not the movie's fault). About the only real negative I can give is the choice of music. I'm not sure if the version I watched was all the original Japanese soundtrack, or if some of the music was swapped out for an Americanized version (as some dubs are won't to do), but in any case, there's more than a couple action sequences that utilize these weird techno tracks that instantly date the movie for me. Rather than anything orchestral, it sounds like it came out of a 1980s arcade game.

Still, I'm glad I finally gave this movie a watch, as it carries fantastic environmental messages that don't beat you over the head. If you're interested in Miyazaki's work, then definitely check it out.",1511395200,,3767,4.769938650306749

1128008,3,7884063387,"I bought this after seeing ""Spirited Away"" at a local film festival and being overwhelmed by Miyazaki's vision.  This simply isn't in the same league. Too many desperate battles (with our heroine always emerging victorious), too many protagonists struggling for not always intelligible causes, a few non-sequiturs (for example in how the trees absorb toxins but then fossilize and break down into pure sand;  at least, that's how I understood it), generally too much going on for too long.  And not a trace of humor, which was always present in ""Spirited Away"".  I'm glad I got it (and, contrary to some other reviewers, I found the Blu-ray quality excellent), but I'm not in a hurry to watch it again, and I'm unlikely to use it to introduce others to Miyazaki's work, for fear of disappointing them.",1510012800,,801,4.867647058823529

The titular Nausicaa herself is a strong protagonist with a tremendous appreciation for the value of lifea character you can't help but root for throughout.

This title was adapted from a much longer manga series and it shows. The climax is followed by an abrupt ending with virtually no denouement. This is disappointing because it would be great to see what becomes of the Valley of the Wind after the end of the film, but the world Miyazaki brings you to in this title is mysterious, alien, a bit frightening on the surface, but altogether one that wishes to be understood.",1494201600,4,745,4.775193798449612

It is remarkable in many ways, especially for some of the artwork. Considering that the story is over thirty years old, I was pleased to see how much the ecological message was part of the film. Also the anti-technology theme, blaming the devastation of civilization on the effects of technology being used for warfare. Princess Nausicaa, seems to be almost the only one who has tried to understand the way the world has changed in the wake of human-triggered catastrophe, and the only one willing to try to find a way to come to terms with the new dominant life-forms (giant insect-like creatures who live in the fungus forests). The disheartening notion that humans still have not learned, and are only trying to repeat past mistakes by warring with each other must be one of Miyazaki's obsessions, but he tries to find a heroine to counter that primitive urge in humans (and insects). Her goodness, and example, seem able to inspire even non-humans to admire her and want to help her. For me, however, it was a shame that it took almost a super-heroine to bring some rationality into the story. Why weren't more people ready to learn from the past and to find ways to co-exist with each other and their transformed world?",1486684800,,1340,4.658227848101266

1129540,5,7884063387,"Over 30 years ago, a film director predicted how the world would be like quite precisely, and his extensive knowledge, ideas, thoughts, and imagination were tried to reflect on this film. However, this attempt did not result in complete success, because the film could not accommodate his too much big ideas due to substantial reasons at that time.

His excellent predictions imaginatively described a devastating future resulted from nuclear wars, atomic energy, and abuse of technology, as you can easily imagine living in this century. Nonetheless, Nausicaa does not fully solve the mystery of this world, and this film suddenly ends when Nausicaa resurrected by big insects which she soothecalmed, meaning that the peaceful world has come. Despite of whether this ending are satisfying, note that this is not the original ending in the comic, he really wanted to depict.

In the original story of his comics, the relationship between insects (or rotten woods) and people reverses again. Like, polluted airs are actually clean, and clean airs will afflict people. This makes readers be more confusing, ""which side is truly right?"". The director told his producer about this changeover, ""this is life"". At the end of the abstruse tale, a destiny finally made Nausicaa a dramatic decision.

This reversal of values well represents the 21st world which we live in. Around globalism, religion, wealth...people should face and deal with these multiple ambivalent confrontation axes. Moreover, no one can tell the easy answer of these complicated questions, exemplifying political events in England and US.

Hence, this historical magnificent tale tells us how the destiny of selfish mankind will become. This tale is not a fairy tale, but an incredibly realistic prediction for us, who are likely to forget nature and misuse technology. This is why this tale is often regarded as an epic poetry, like Odysseia, from which the name of Nausicaa derives.",1485388800,,1949,5.237179487179487

1130196,5,7884063387,"You can read about this movie eveywhere else, so Im focused on the bluray edition here.

Details, colors and motion are flawless... in the previous release I had, many of the darker scenes were a muddy mess, highlights were blown out and colors inconsistent. This BR from Disney is as close you'll get to the actual animation cels. Simply stunning. Nausicaa's light trousers and her skintone are finally distinct enough, you won't be asking if she's soaring without pants. :-)

The stereo soundtrack uses the full dynamic range, so youll be riding the volume up and down A LOT. The noisier scenes pack a wollop and the quieter passages you'll need to turn up a bit. Playing this through a proper stereo is a must -- tiny flatscreen tv speakers cant keep up.

The extras are easily ignored fluff... aside from the unique 'storyboard' that shows each major scene establishing sketch. That was a lovely surprise.

English subtitles work but you have to activate them from the disc's own menu -- our players' CC would be set to on, but wouldnt show. Captions appear unobstrusive and accurate.

1130567,5,7884063387,"This movie is a classic. It is one of the most important anime films ever made, especially to those of us in the west; without it, Studio Ghibli might not have ever been founded, leaving us without some of the best films ever made. This version preserves the original, unlike that Warriors of the Wind monstrosity. It has both the English dub (which, while I dislike dubs in general, is really quite good) and the Japanese audio for us purists (I think it also has Spanish and French). It also includes a DVD version, which I actually kind of don't like since I feel it just allowed them to jack up the price for something most people probably won't use. But English-translated anime is nearly always super expensive, so it's not all that big of a deal. The movie itself though, which while certainly not Miyazaki's best, is fantastic. It kind of feels a little rushed at the end, but that's to be expected considering it was based on roughly a volume and a half of the manga (if you haven't read that, definitely do, it is much better than the movie, one of the best things I've ever read).

IT was called ""Warriors of the Wind"",,, This was the version I fell in love with as a child, and when I bought the Disney release I was disappointed by the dubbing of the new voices, mostly for the princess.  The princess's voice was pretty, (weak in my opinion), ordinary, but in the old release it was full of character and individuality.  I watched the first 15 minutes of this video and I turned it off, because I didn't want to ruin the memory I had when I was a kid.

I'm not the typical anime fan, but I've lived in Japan before and studied the language since 2009. As a filmmaker, I view Japanese animation as any other medium; there's fantastic anime and there's shoddy anime. This film falls into the former category. Even the English dub is great, the amount of work Disney put into giving it a faithful dub opened up the rest of Studio Ghibli's films for american releases (For those unfamiliar, there was a non-disney dub that intercut this with another show, completely changed the story, and created film so bad that Hayao Miyazaki refused to let any of his work be translated for many years).

1131700,5,7884063387,"Taking place more than a thousand years in the future, the environment in many parts of the Earth has been destroyed by the past actions of mankind. A massive toxic jungle covers much of the land, but it is too poisonous for humans and is infested with giant insects. Nausica (Alison Lohman) is the princess of the Valley of the Wind, an area where the air is clean and human life is possible. Nausica laments what humans have previously done to the environment and lives in peace with the toxic jungle. However, she gets involved in a conflict between two warring factions, the Pejites and the Tolmekians, and must take action to do what she sees is right.

This is the movie that would lead to the creation of the famed Studio Ghibli and it has much in common with their films. I found the animation to be well done in this movie with some interestingly designed creatures and great action sequences. The music is also top notch. The main theme of the movie, the importance of environmentalism, is also handled well and is told through an engaging story.

This Blu-ray/DVD set contains as bonus features the original Japanese soundtrack, storyboards, and a short documentary on the early history of Studio Ghibli.

This is good movie to check out for fans of animation and the works of Ghibli.",1444089600,5,1295,4.671052631578948

1131884,5,7884063387,"""Nausica"" is probably my favorite Miyazaki movie (sorry ""Totoro"" and ""Princess Mononoke""). Ultimately, it's because the story line of ""Nausica"" appears so much more vibrant and whimsical compared to many other movies, and while the characters may be less memorable than Howl or Totoro or somesuch, the backdrop that they're placed in is all the more interesting.

When I was very young I received the first English dub DVD of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. I thought it was weird, I couldn't get past 5 minutes, and the bugs were scary.
I gave it another chance when I was in my teenage years.
This is by far, Miyazaki's best work.
Yes, the animation is a bit primitive (it was made in the early 80s!), and yes, the soundtrack sounds somewhat odd. But this is by far the best story created by Miyazaki. It doesn't tell a story of a 16-year-old girl who is admired for her looks, who chases a boy and falls in love. It is the opposite. Nausicaa is the most special character I have ever seen in a film. She is brave, smart, has a truly caring and empathetic heart, cares for everyone and everything, is strong, powerful, humble, and values all life.
The supporting characters are wonderful as well. The brave and mysterious Lord Yupa, the strong and witty Obaba, the adorable Teto, the passionate and lively Asbel, the quirky and responsible Meto, the slick and comical Kurotowa, and the sexy and powerful Princess Kushana. The voiceovers for all of these characters are outstanding as well.
One thing that is very important to realize about this movie is the following: I have heard more than a handful of viewers complain about the bugs. The fact that Miyazaki chose bugs is the ENTIRE reason why Nausicaa is such a beautiful human being. Bugs are the most despised creatures on the planet, and Nausicaa has true empathy and the deepest care for understanding and protecting them from the harm of humans. So when I hear people say, ""EW but the bugs are weird..."" This is completely what Miyazaki wants you NOT to think (at least, that is my inference!)
Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind will always be my favorite movie. Nausicaa is my hero. She is far wiser than any adult I have crossed paths with, and she is 16 years old.
Watch it a few times, and I couldn't see any reason why you wouldn't at least mildly appreciate it.

On a final note, the fact that some viewers were bothered by her ""not having underpants"" is beyond my comprehension. We are all humans with bodies and there is NO NUDITY in this film.
Also, for the few reviewers who have stated ""Oh, but I loved Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away SO much better!"" Nausicaa is not another love story like Howl's Moving Castle or a story that is bursting with fantasy and color like Spirited Away. But it is so much more than that.",1406073600,,2625,4.434782608695652

1133922,5,7884063387,Everything I expected a Miyazaki film to be.,1404345600,,44,4.625
1133923,5,7884063387,"""Nausicaa"" is set in a post-apocalyptic world thousands of years into the future. After an event alluded to as the Seven Days of Fire, civilization as we know it is destroyed and humanity's remaining population scattered into isolated communities. Most of the globe is overrun by toxic jungles that produce spores deadly to human beings, and explorers must use gas-masks to protect themselves whenever they venture out into the wilderness.

Added danger comes from the insect life that now dominates the earth, particularly those known as the Ohmu. They look rather like giant pill-bugs with bulbous eyes that change colour depending on their moods, and it is their corpses that produce the poisonous spores that make life so difficult for what remains of humanity.

In this dangerous new world there are only a few pockets of civilization left; cities such as Torumekia and Pejite, who are constantly at war with each other, and the Valley of the Wind, favourably located to take advantage of the wind from the sea. Not only does it keep the poisonous spores from settling, but it powers the windmills that supply water and energy to the farming community.

The film begins when Lord Yupa, a master swordsman, runs into the eponymous Princess Nausicaa on his way back to the Valley. Yupa claims that he's trying to unravel the mysteries of the eco-system, though there are rumours that he's searching for the subject of a prophecy: ""a person clad in blue standing in a golden field who will find the bond between humanity and the earth, and lead the people to a pure land.""

All seems peaceful, but that night an airship crash-lands in the Valley, attacked by a swarm of infuriated insects. Nausicaa uses her glider to try and help, only to find a young girl in handcuffs thrown clear of the destroyed ship. With her dying breath she gives Nausicaa a message: ""burn the cargo.""

The war-like Torumekians arrive to reclaim their ship, garrisoning the Valley while they're at it. Nausicaa soon learns that their mysterious cargo is a weapon that they claim can obliterate the toxic jungle and take back the world for humanity - though the neighbouring Pejites are horrified at the thought of such a dangerous weapon in the hands of their enemies, and are fully prepared to sacrifice the Valley in order to destroy it once and for all.

With Nausicaa taken hostage and the Valley endangered from humans and insects alike, it all comes down to discovering the symbiotic nature of the ecological system to prevent further destruction from taking place.

As you can probably see from this summary (and I've barely even scratched the surface of what actually goes on) this is a very dense film in terms of its world-building and character development, and at times you get the sense that you're watching only a very small part of a much larger story. That's unsurprising considering the story was originally conceived as a long-running manga series, which naturally had more time to delve into the politics and biology that can only exist in broad strokes here.

But it still remains an engrossing and sophisticated film, with a strong female protagonist, an anti-war and environmentalist message, and a conflict that's depicted in varying shades of grey. What passes for the film's antagonists all have good reasons for doing what they do, and though ""protecting my own people at all costs"" might not totally justify their actions, it does make them understandable.

But it is the character of Nausicaa that headlines this movie from start to finish, and I wish there were more female characters like her in the world. She's efficient, cool-headed, intelligent and compassionate, and her heroism is not based on being a warrior but a peacemaker. Although Miyazaki's films often have a wide range of three-dimensional characters, Nausicaa is unique in this context simply because the rest of the cast pale in comparison to her. Though interesting, none of them are quite as compelling as she is, and few make as much of an impact on the plot. Still, there's Lord Yupa, the old swordmaster who dispenses sage advice, and Kushana, the princess-commander of the Torumekian army, both of whom provide interesting foils to one another in their abilities and motivation.

The film boasts animation that beautifully captures fantastical animals, foreign landscapes and the exhilaration of flying, but also some of the more mundane aspects of life: children playing, windmills turning and farmers ploughing their fields. One of the best things about Miyazaki's films are their ability to create wonder out ordinary events, and that's very much the case here.

""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" is a good place for newcomers to start exploring Miyazaki's body of work. Though the soundtrack can get a bit heavy-handed at times, it epitomizes everything that's exciting and creative and memorable about his films.",1402704000,,4900,4.992647058823529

1134056,5,7884063387,"A crowning achievement of human talent..... this is 80's animation and I personally find it better than anything being done today. This is hand sketched, frame by frame animation... and it's insane that such precision is achieved. There are so many details to be found on every scene, that you will be amazed at the subtlety of some things. It's just a constant flow of life on the screen at all times, whether it's background characters moving a certain way while having a conversation with another, or the incredible background of the nature of the world... it's just insanity. I used to think Japanese stories were super cheesy and made too much effort to sound philosophical but the more and more japanese exposure that I get, the more amazing I think it is. Unlike american film that tries to cater to the ADD community, Miyazaki likes to take his time to characterize everything and doesn't assume the audience is retarded, like most of american film does. This is a very smart story with an incredible and beautiful message for people of any age... just the perfect family film basically. I would also like to add that watching this made me realize that James Cameron copied this and Princess Mononoke, another Miyazaki masterpiece and pasted most of the story elements into Avatar... and the deadly plant spores were also used in the game The Last of Us. Genius is often imitated and copied I guess.",1394582400,2,1407,4.770491803278689

In this film, people are at war with each other and the environment, which they see as the greatest threat (toxic plants and bugs with attitudes).  It's quite complicated; a heady mixture of blame, enough to go around.
You can definitely see what influenced Miyazaki in the making of this film (Earthsea, Brian Aldiss's Hothouse, Isaac Asimov's Nightfall, even Dune).  All of which he freely admits.  The results are a spectacular achievement in animation.

Across all Studio Ghibli movies, the enduring common theme seems to be:  Respect everyone and everything around you, and you will find peace and balance.  I love that this theme carries over regardless of which Studio Ghibli (Hayao Miyazaki) movie you choose.

The flying machines in Nausica are wonderful.  Combine all the beautiful creations from Howl's Moving Castle, Castle in the Sky, and Porco Rosso, and you have a wonderful collection of form before function machines that bubble in your imagination.  Set these machines against some of the most lush and surreal backgrounds you'll ever encounter, and feel your pupils dilate as you bathe in the purity of the moment.  I can't imagine the amount of thought and imagination which goes into creating just some of the simple, fleeting, albeit beautiful scenes which frame a stupendous plot and characters.

And finally, there's the story.  And what a story it is!  If you have enjoyed any of the other Studio Ghibli/Hayao Miyazaki masterpieces, do yourself a favor and give this one viewing.

I always saw Nausicaa as quite the hero in my young mind. Her courage, ability to be one with nature, and desire to save her people at any cost was very touching to me.
I also appreciated the Valley people having common sense and doing what they could to mount a resistance against their enemies. THANK-YOU! For once, peasants who don't run around stupidly and just get shot.
As for the villains...I thought the Queen was pretty conniving, but her second in command was the kind of weasel you'd just like to thump.

The voice dubbing was pretty good, held emotion, and was in sync with their lips. The animation is smooth.

It did have a funny part, when three old soldiers take a tank for a spin. But mostly, it's a serious show, and it honestly still makes me cry at the end. (But don't worry, it ends well.)

A bit of a warning here for parents: some of the bugs are scary to look at, there is blood, it gets pretty gory when a large creature melts, and there's one point with Nausicaa opens her shirt and shows some cleavage as she lets her little pet Tito jump in to keep him safe from harm.

Nausicaa cares deeply for not only her people but for everyone including the supposed enemy of mankind.

The animation is fairly sophisticated and smooth-flowing, not as overly simplified and rushed-looking as some of the more recent works in the genre. The sentiment expressed in the plotline is overtly heroic and romantic without being overwrought; the arch of the story unwinds in such an unrushed fashion that the ""mesage"" is conveyed naturally, not at all overplayed.

The version sold by Amazon incorporates some scenes and incidental material absent from the version I recorded from a television broadcast aired in the late 1990s, but neither version suffers unduly because of these minor differences. The additional material is surprising, but not upsettingly so.

1135470,4,7884063387,"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind
Disney/Miyazaki

Plot:
A million years ago, a world-wide conflict, known as the ""Seven Days of Fire"" engulfed the human race, leaving behind only a remnant of what was once a flourishing planet and prosperous people. The survivors of the war grouped into isolated colonies where they struggled to overcome barren wastelands, ever-encroaching poisonous forests, and the dangerous, forest-dwelling Ohmu--creatures that resemble gargantuan pillbugs.

Nausicaa is the princess in the Valley of the Wind, one of the isolated colonies fortunate enough to survive the ancient war. Seemingly gifted with a soothing, enchanting presence, she has the ability to tame the anger of everything from a rampaging Ohmu, to a hostile fox-squirrel. Her talents even seem to affect the other humans around her...

But Nausicaa is different than the others, even then. She longs for peace--a peace that will allow the humans, the forests, and the Ohmu to live together in harmony. While many in her colony share this vision, neighboring civilizations have other plans...

When an attack from the local Torumekian Empire results in the death and destruction of her homeland, Nausicaa bends to the will of Princess Kushana and willingly gives herself as a hostage in order to preserve her people. Torumekia has plans to obliterate the forests and its creatures in order to reclaim the planet for mankind, and Nausicaa can do little but put up silent resistance and make plans to stop her...

As Nausicaa's adventure continues, she discovers that the conflict encompasses far more than Torumekia. Other nations have become involved as well, and something seems to be stirring the Ohmu into a warlike rage...

My thoughts:
Nausicaa is certainly one of those lesser-known Miyazaki films, especially when compared to a movie like My Friend Totoro or the award-winning Spirited Away. While there's a reason for that, Nausicaa also has a lot to offer with its story and characters, which are at the heart of the film.

Having just come away from Howl's Moving Castle, I found that I had to adjust to the animation of Nausicaa, which was certainly more traditional and less vibrant than a partially CG film like Spirited Away. The voice quality is muddy at times, and dialogue consists of many ""talk-to-myself-to-clear-this-up-for-the-viewer"" moments, as well as some pretty cheesy stuff. Music is mostly off throughout the film, either because it just doesn't fit the moment or the track just lacks the right instruments to bring the scene home.

As may have been revealed by the plot description, the movie has a certain focus on ""environmentalism"" and finding the ""special bond"" between man and nature. Since the setting appears to be an entirely fictional planet, the message is easier to ignore and never really gets too preachy, which I was thankful for. If viewed simply as an engaging plot about a girl with a compassionate heart, the environmentalism stuff kinda diminishes.

And... Nausicaa needs a darker pair of pants. They're the exact same color as her skin, which leads to some very deceptive moments...

Moving on.

But the reason I truly found Nausicaa worth watching was the characters and the plot. The heroine is truly admirable; she's tough, but gentle; firm, but kind; relentless, but courageous; and even in the face of severe pain and loss she never stops following what she believes in. Nausicaa isn't so outstanding as to be ""inhuman,"" but she isn't a weak or flawless character either.

Of course, the supporting cast is quite alive as well--lending humor, wisdom, originality, or simply backup, to the plot. It's really a shame you don't get to know them better. Alas, screentime (like bombs) must be used wisely.

Along with these excellent characters is an original and engaging plot about man VS man, nature, beast, and self. While it's a bit difficult to get into at first; and there's a plethora of names, cultures, and concepts to get familiar with; those who are able to grasp the basic structure of the story will find something to love. Creativity certainly isn't lacking here, as is expected of Miyazaki, and the atmospheres, creatures, and characters all offer something different.

The cool stuff:
Original, interesting plotline
Creativity runs throughout the story
Humor is a nice touch
Characters are unique and likeable
Heroine is strong and relatable
Satisfactory, powerful ending

The ""meh"" stuff:
Dialogue often resorts to characters self-explaining concepts/thoughts/etc.; sometimes cheesy or unnatural
Animation is a bit sketchy, although the film is around 25 years old...
Music is often inappropriate for the moment or just awkward in general
Scenes can be of questionable reality (i.e.--small, single-man fighter plane taking out three enormous battleships?)
Theme of environmentalism is present but bearable
...Nausicaa needs different pants O_o

Final Verdict:
I totally loved the characters in Nausicaa, especially the name-sake of the movie. If you love anime, and you're looking for a deep, original plotline, you'll probably want to give Nausicaa a watch or two (two or more if you really want to nail all those names and plot devices). As is typical of Miyazaki, there is a running vein of environmentalism, but if you can stomach it, or look past it and focus on the compassion and courage of the lead characters and the originality of the plot, you'll probably still enjoy the story.

Nausicaa isn't without some prominent faults, but you can certainly see the potential it could have if things like cheesy dialogue, misplaced soundtrack, and awkward moments were removed. If you love Miyazaki, it goes without saying that you should certainly see Nausicaa at least once. If anime isn't your thing, then you may still find the story and characters immersive, or you may not enjoy it at all.",1369872000,,5856,5.140904311251314

The toxic jungle is supposed to clean the soil, but the soil seemed fine before, and all the toxic jungle seems to be doing is being, well, toxic.
Characters: 2/5 Don't get me wrong, Nausicaa is likable enough. The other characters, particularly some allies that she picks up along the way, I found hard to relate to.

I really couldn't like the insects, even though Nausicaa did. They just seemed too gross.

1135888,5,7884063387,"When I purchased Princess Monomoke, I didn't also purchase Nausicaa because I guessed that it would have the same story as Momomoke, but with insects instead of wolves and pigs.  Recently, I was able to watch Nausicaa on television and I was wrong.  It's a different story and it's a good one.  It has some similarities to Origins, but it's not the same as Origins either.

I didn't feel that Monomoke was a likeable heroine.  Many times, she acted like a brat that needed a spanking.  Nausicaa is a very likeable heroine.  You want her to win and you hope that she doesn't end up in pieces strewn across the landscape.  Fortunately, that doesn't happen to her.

The story has a great deal of action and some of it is aerial combat.  It is a compact story and not a scene is wasted.  There aren't any times when you wonder when something is going to happen.

The animation is not as awesome as Monomoke, but it is very good.  The scenes where Nausicaa is flying her powered glider are well done.

Is Nausicaa, like Origins, a story that the next generation will want to watch?  I think that it will be, and for that reason, I gave it five stars.",1359244800,,1145,4.385714285714286

First, this is an older film (originally released in 1984) so the animation may not be as good as current standards.  The second (if you are considering buying this as a Disney fan as opposed to being an anime/Miyazaki fan) is that some of the Japanese content/ideology may not translate very well.  When I look at the animation I'm blown away.  There are several films I've seen recently that are no where near as beautiful as some of the scenes in this movie.  The environments are detailed, and the characters are expressive.  The musical score was great, and fit the scenes well.  As for whether or not the content translates well or not, I think it does.  It feels like a classic sci-fi movie, but with a bit of eastern flair.  I only recognized some of the hidden meaning after watching the short documentary on the dvd.

1136053,2,7884063387,"BLU-RAY review.  I am upset.  Disney has overstepped the line.  I love Miyazaki's films.  This one in particular is my favorite.  First off, I watch all of my Miyazaki films in Japanese with English subtitles. One of my favorite parts of all of his movies are the opening credits.  I don't care that I can't read them because they are in Japanese, they are all design masterpieces in my eyes. Between the drawings and the beautiful Japanese characters, they are a sight to behold.  Well, thanks to the arrogance of Disney, the credit sequence on this blu ray has been altered.  There are English names in a completely ridiculous font messing up the credit sequence.  It ruins the film for me.  I am going to try to import the Blu Ray from Japan, and hopefully Disney doesn't have a hand in that version.

I would like to add that on The Castle in the Sky Disney blu ray, if you select Japanese audio, you get the Japanese credits, so someone had the right mind to fix that. Hopefully all of the future Disney / Miyazaki releases will have this correction.",1358294400,4,1055,4.5

1136229,5,7884063387,"First, I must admit I am not a big animation fan. What got me kept watching it is its excellent storytelling style as well as the universal environmental theme, a theme for love, care and connection. Many may find it simplistic, but as Tolstoy once said in one of his short stories, maybe to reach the heaven of our human myth, we must relearn the naivette and innocence of a child. Throughout the movie, the young pricess tried her best to connect people and groups, as if she were a symbol of our tortured humanity--torn by environmental disaster, war, mutual yet unnecessary hostility. There is an appeal for the rise of divine feminine and it's interesting to see two of the lead characters are females. Without being neither too political or New-Agey about it, one can clearly see a salient message in the movie's depiction of secondary positions of the male characters and the female characters to be superior position. They are the one who cry out for tolerance, understanding, (except one power hungry female commander), and defy their own tribal rules when needed.
I think the movie pleads our good sense to prevail. Although, at the end of the movie, you will clearly see the director had one magic scene that blurs the gender divide, and he shows our humanity as a whole. You will find out what I mean, just watch the show.",1354233600,,1334,4.680851063829787

1136232,5,7884063387,"Nausicaa... this movie is no stranger to Ghibli fans but for the average viewer, it seems to be often overshadowed by other Ghibli works such as Mononoke, Spirited Away, Kiki, Totoro, and Laputa (Castle in the Sky). It's the movie that started it all. This is my second favorite Ghibli movie after Laputa.

The details are in the other reviews but I will say this - definitely read the manga (graphic novel). You'll see this recommendation throughout other reviews as well.  I first saw Nausicaa the movie and thought it was a decent movie but a few things did bother me, especially in character development and the exposure time (or lack thereof) of the giant warrior.  Then I read the manga. Whoa and I mean WHOA. There's a huge difference. The story is so much longer, the characters are so deep, and the giant warrior plays an integral part for much of the story... Side note: The manga reminds me of Akira... the movie came out before the Otomo finished his manga work and only captured a slice of the entire story (if you've not read Akira, highly recommneded). Nausicaa the movie is similar in that sense as the manga ran from 1982-1994 but the move was released in 1984. You will think Miyazaki's a genius and a true artist, having created and drawn such work during his syndication.

1136234,5,7884063387,"This 1st Hayao Miyazaki - Ghibli Study movie is a classic. Even after so long time, everybody can relate to Nausicaa and cheer for her.

Nausica is the princess of Valley of the Wind. But unlike the princesses one is used to, she is like the kings of the old, when kings would fight alongside its folk. She even do repairs in machinery in her kingdom.

But she unlike princess Kushana, Nausicaa does not crave for war. Her fight is for life, and not for death.

The world they live is trying to purge away all poison that humankind poured upon Earth. It is pictured by Sea of Decay, a deadly ocean of death, where nobody - humans, convencional animals and plants - can live.

There are few no-poisoned lands. And in there, humans fight agains each other, as well fight against Sea of Decay.

Nausicaa in the other hand is not a fighter. She is most likely a scientist, as she loves even that mortal ecosystem. She does not hates even if that world have sickened her father, she tries to understand in order to find a cure for him.

And like scientists, her fight is even harder than anybody else, because she fights with no weapons. Only knowledge and love.

I known no person who can not be moved to tears at the final scenes, in her struggle to save her people, to save Nature, and even save her enemies.

The beauty of her heart, and the beauty of the songs - unlike disney princesses, she will not sing for you - are overhelming and powerful.

There are similar themes in most of their product line, usually a respect for nature that modern industrial imperial economies have forsaken in ignorance of the usual karmic aspects from such disrespect. There is a price to be paid, a cause and effect relationship, whether you know and understand it or not. This film is a nice telling of that price on the people even as the tunnel vision empire builders keep repeating their mistakes endlessly in their ignorance. This makes the story rather timeless given it is the human tradition for the past many eons that continue today. The names change, but the practices remain the same.

1136416,5,7884063387,"Nausicaa, released in 1984, is one of the best movies ever made. It can be enjoyed at many levels, and by children and adults. Nausicaa is a profound statement about the resilience of man and nature, and of the good that is at war with sickness of spirit. It teaches how good and evil war within man, creating the potential for small disasters and global disaster, and that our better side can triumph, both in small and great things. Nausicaa learns that sometimes good has to defend itself, and even kill, but there is more strength and wisdom in moderation and understanding, and there is virtue in community and tradition. Nothing, including the Toxic Jungle - which cries out to be shown in 3D- is what it seems on the surface. Life goes deeper than that. A girl shows the way. She should be the role model for daughters, and sons.

Does Nausicaa wear underpants??  oh. the horror, the horror...
But she probably does, so not to worry. Her little skirt is just an outfit on an anime character and well suited to aerial acrobatics. In Kubrick's 2001 our great to the nth power ape grandparents are shown completely  naked.

1136572,5,7884063387,"I first watched this film back in 2004 and it left an impression on me then that there was something special about it. Perhaps it was the soundtrack, which is one the more hauntingly beautiful ones that I have heard. Since then I have watched about half of the Studio Ghibli films (Castle In The Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, and Ponyo). Though technically speaking, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is not a Studio Ghibli film as it was made before the founding of the Studio, it still feels like one, especially with its themes of ecological balance and living in harmony with the environment.

Now I plan on writing a review of all the Studio Ghibli films (and watching them all), in chronological production order. Why? Because Studio Ghibli's canon of films is one of the best of the world, but also sadly not as well known in the US.

A thousand years after the near destruction of human civilization, humanity struggles against the encroaching Toxic Jungle. Eking out lives at the edges of Toxic Jungles that are inhabited by giant insects, life remains a struggle for most. In one kingdom, the bucolic Valley of the Wind, Princess Nausicaa and her people are thrown into the maelstrom of a war when a bellicose Tolmekian (another Kingdom) warship crashes into their valley. Aboard that ship is a relic of the war that almost destroyed the Earth and human civilization 1000 years ago.

Suddenly the peaceful Valley of the Wind and Princess Nausicaa must struggle for their existence as a war over the future of humanity and of the Earth plays out in the Valley. While events are shaping up for a war, Nausicaa learns of the secret of the Toxic Jungle and its connection to humanity. And so the future of humanity is caught between the knowledge that only Nausicaa possesses and the plans of the militaristic Tolmekians, who are set to try to destroy the Toxic Jungle.

Ultimately this film is a great introduction to the Studio Ghibli canon. It's message about environmental collapse and environmental harmony continue to resonate almost 30 years after its creation.

Even over 25 years later, it still holds up - I'd test it side by side with any Anime since it's original release, and Nausicaa will probably win.

Just watch it. You'll see numerous scenes that look familiar. Why? So many other mainstream movies have ""borrowed"" from it.  Ideas, shooting style, sometimes it seems like the director just did a frame by frame reconstruction.  This movie is that good. From Dragonball to Cloverfield, you'll see the Nausicaa influence.

The Film 5/5

When it comes to animation, my favorite director by far is Hayao Miyazaki. If you have read my Top 20 animated list, you'll see how often his name appears. Studio Ghibli has been responsible for many good films, but Nausica of the Valley of the Wind was actually released in 1984, just before the studio was founded. It remains Miyazaki's most ambitious work because of its epic scope.

Nausica is set approximately a thousand years in the future when pollution levels have threatened to destroy life on the planet. The land is dominated by the Toxic Jungle which is filled with poisonous plants. The jungle is protected by giant insects and other creatures.

We meet Nausica (Lohman) early in the film when she discovers a discarded ohm shell. Ohms are giant creatures which seems wiser than any humans they may encounter. Nausica recovers one of the parts of the shell and takes it home. Ohms are not always calm and their eyes grow red with rage when they are angry. Nausica helps save Lord Yupa (Stewart), a master swordsman, from an enraged ohm.

Yupa knows Nausica well and has a present for her; a small fox squirrel which she names Teto. Her first encounter with the creature shows us her true nature. She says that there is nothing to fear, but the fox-squirrel bites her. She makes no move, but simply repeats that there is nothing to fear. It stops biting and licks the wound. It's such a touching scene and gives a hint at how Nausica interacts with strangers later in the story. She's an easy character to love.

Nausica's life is peaceful. She lives in the Valley of the Winds where everyone works together in harmony farming the land. Although her father is the king, princess Nausica doesn't put herself above other people. She lends a hand repairing machinery or whatever else is needed. Her people love her; especially the children. For any parent thinking of showing the film to their children, Nausica is a good role model.

The film has quite a few battle sequences, but they are brief and involve misguided people who think their causes are just. I think Miyazaki is showing us what could happen if we continue to pollute and exploit the planet without giving any thought to the future. It's a common theme in his stories and is more prominent here than in later films.

Unlike any other animated film I have seen, Nausica of the Valley of the Wind shows us a vast world. We explore some of it and see Nausica discover secrets about the world and the creatures inhabiting it. She has a way with animals and insects and seeks solutions that avoid killing any kind of creature. She seems to empathize and realize how to stop seemingly wild creatures from attacking. People around her are frequently amazed by her actions.

The film shows the futility of war and the power people have to change their lives by thinking about their course of action. So much happens in the two hour running time that the film seems to move at a breakneck pace. There is always something happening, whether it's action or a discovery of some kind.

Joe Hisaishi is again responsible for the music, and it's one of the best scores he has ever produced. There's a particular scene with a piece of music using children's voices which has me in tears every time. I'm not sure why, but the music is powerful and fits the scenes perfectly.

I know I haven't revealed much of the story. That's because I want you to discover the secrets for yourself. Nausica of the Valley of the Wind reminds me of scenes in Avatar and Star Wars, but the story is arguably more powerful than both. If you have seen other titles from Hayao Miyazaki, be aware that this contains more adult themes than most. That said, it can and should be enjoyed by the whole family.

Video Quality 4.5/5
If you have seen any of Miyazaki's films, you'll know that his animation style looks nothing like modern studios such as Pixar or Dreamworks. He's an artist in the true sense of the word and the frames of the films look like watercolor paintings. It's been 27 years since the film was released, so the animation style looks a little dated. Some of the supporting characters in crowds won't move, but the overall effect is still wonderful. Disney has delivered another great transfer. Colors improve dramatically over the DVD version. Some scenes look slightly soft, but that's partly due to the animation style. This doesn't look like Up, Ratatouille or Rango, but detail is strong and any Miyazaki fan will be delighted with the result.

Audio Quality 4/5
The film comes with three audio mixes. Disney failed to provide a lossless Japanese option for Ponyo, but purists will be happy to see the Japanese: DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 track included this time. Other versions include English and French: DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Although a 5.1 mix would have been welcome, I'm not disappointed by the options on offer. Dialogue is clear throughout, while battle scenes pack a considerable punch. Ambient sounds such as wind in the valley come across well, as does Joe Hisaishi's score.

Special Features 3/5

The additional features are split between the BD and the DVD.

As with other Miyazaki films, Nausica of the Valley of the Wind includes the option to view the entire film with the original Japanese storyboards. It's interesting to see how Miyazaki's original sketches developed.

Enter the Lands of Ghibli gives the viewer the option to click on characters from some of the other films. There's not a huge amount of content, but it's nice to see.

Behind the Studio: Creating Nausica (12 minutes, HD) - A brief feature which includes thoughts from Miyazaki.

The Birth Story of Studio Ghibli (28 minutes, SD) - A TV documentary from Japan talking about Studio Ghibli's origins.

Behind the Microphone (8 minutes, SD) - The American cast is shown recording some of the scenes and talking about the film.

Original Japanese Trailers and TV Spots (8 minutes, SD)

Nausica of the Valley of the Wind includes a lot of themes and elements that we have come to expect in a Hayao Miyazaki movie, but it's more epic in scope. Like Avatar, this makes me feel like I am stepping onto another world. Unlike Avatar, the dialogue isn't dumb in any way. I like Nausica as a character because her intentions are always good. She sees the best in everyone and is a positive force. The whole experience makes the film one I love to revisit and it's always rated among my favorite animated titles. Disney's Blu-ray presentation does the film justice and is highly recommended as a story that can be enjoyed by the whole family.

I saw this just as my love for anime was beginning. At the time, I only had Spirited Away, the first season of Kenshin, and Fruits Basket. My sisters friend let me borrow it, and I fell in love with it. The story line, the art, but mostly, it was the music, it was the music that captured my love it. It's wonderful.

The style of the films animation on this and some other aren't earth-shattering but with the story, in depth characters and some very good voice acting it's just the kind of film everyone can enjoy and the journeys the characters go through in these movies are amazing for the movie run-time without making 'cookie-cutter' types into the line up of characters. The deep respect for the natural world is something else I love. There's just so much good you can say about his films and I haven't seen a bad one yet or even one that I wasn't fascinated with. The well known American actors gives it an extended accessebility for the people that don't like reading sub titles or hearing the same person doing every other voice.

1136904,4,7884063387,"This review is of the Disney Blu-Ray release of NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF WIND.

Disney has blown the doors off with this wonderful transfer of a somewhat-obscure Miyazaki animated classic.  Many will point to the refinement in animation of latter Miyazaki works, but if you are a fan of that hardcore CASTLE IN THE SKY fantasy style then this one is a real gem.  This film is as concerned with ecology as POM POKO but is full of adventure and political intrigue.  The female lead is an outright super-heroine.  I would have paid the full $40, but with the discounted Amazon price I found this to be a no-brainer.  Truly beautiful.",1304121600,,631,4.589285714285714
1136905,5,7884063387,Just a superb movie all around. The yard stick by with I measure all other animation. The only down side I have found is than it makes me long for a full movie version of the entire manga.,1303776000,,188,3.973684210526316
1136906,3,7884063387,"I Love this movie.  I own the original VHS (when it was called ""Warriors of the Wind"") as well as the 'restored' DVD with new voice actors and added content (which cleared up the story a bit).  AND, on top of it, I also own the Manga series, so believe me when I say that I REALLY love this movie, and I'm an enormous fan of Miyazaki's.

Now the bad news... The 3 stars I am giving are NOT for the movie, but for the BluRay release.

I'm seeing a disappointing trend in BluRay titles regarding older titles.  I may be expecting too much, but if you're going to do something, do it right.  I was hoping the technical issues that were glaring on the DVD release (frame jitter, soundtrack dropout, etc..) would have been fixed or at least reduced in the BluRay version.  Or, as I said before, my expectation level is unrealistic and a complete restore is impossible.

I hope the latter is true, as I would hate to think that other great movies wouldn't get the effort they deserve when transfered to BluRay.  However, I do NOT regret purchasing this BluRay, and highly recommend fans of the movie to do so as well.  Why?  I want to see more of this genre on BluRay (at least the quality films), and lend my support when I can.

That being said, I hope 'Grave of the Fireflies' is next on the list.",1302652800,15,1294,4.279835390946502
1136907,5,7884063387,"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is my favorite animated film.  When I was a child my family owned a videotape of this movie called ""Warriors of the Wind.""  I thought it was the greatest cartoon in the world, and loved the character of Princess Zandra.  Then when I grew up and went to college, I discovered to my horror that my favorite anime movie had more than half an hour of its plot cut out of it for American audiences.  I quickly found a subtitled version of the original Japanese film.  It was better.  With this American release of the film, everyone can watch Miyazaki's animated masterpiece the way it was meant to be seen, with talented voice actors.  The film came out in the 80s, so some of the animation and music can seem dated.  I know some of the people I lend my copy of the film to seem to prefer the more modern Ghibli films.  (They're wrong of course--this one is the best.)

The story is epic.  Young Nausicaa is the princess of a tiny kingdom trying to survive on a post-apocalypic Earth.  Her home, the Valley of the Wind, is caught up in a struggle between two powerful warring nations and the terrible threat of the Toxic Jungle and its giant insects.  Her quest to bring peace to her world on every front is spectacular and moving.

Princess Nausicaa is the greatest anime heroine ever.  She is strong and kind and noble.  There is something otherworldly about her.  Which is perfect for the kind of mythical hero she is.  Not just an action heroine, she is also on a messianic journey to bring peace to the world.  The film's climax is emotional and pure.

And then there is the song.  La la la la la la la la...it seems to reach inside you and lift you up.  Just beautiful.

Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a beautiful, epic, post-apocalyptic fantasy.  It has deep themes of harmony with nature and one another, and the hero of the tale is such a wonderful character.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.  (And for those of you who like graphic novels, the series ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" is actually even better than the movie.  It runs for seven volumes and actually goes beyond the plot of the movie in volume 2, so you can see that there is much more story to tell.  To do true justice to Nausicaa's journey would probably require a trilogy of films.)",1302566400,,2301,4.388625592417061
1136908,5,7884063387,"Perhaps in part because this Tales from Earthsea, the directorial debut of Hayao Miyazaki's son, Goro, this Blu-Ray version of Miyazaki's first feature directed for Studio Ghibliis has also been released (I would assume an Earthsea Blu-ray is forthcoming).

Completely by coincidence, Nausicaa takes on a staggeringly prophetic tone in the shadow of recent natural and man-made disasters in Japan, making it all the more hard-hitting as allegory.

Virtually all of Miyazaki's film convey this theme with varied intensity. In Nausicaa, pollution and industrial waste is the major element as this fantasy world is plagued by a deadly poisoned jungle and the relation between people and animals, in this case bug-like creatures that young Princess Nausicaa understands and champions.

The film is lentgthy for an animated feature, yet does not flag or sag. It's an overall dark story without much humor, but the subject matter holds little room for flippancy. The voice cast, showcased on one of the bonus features, matches that of a major Hollywood live action movie, the case including Patrick Stewart, Uma Thurman and Edward James Olmos.

For DVD owners, you will find that a few of the bonus features have been moved to the new disc. But Blu-ray especially accentuates that remarkable, meticulous detail of the world of Nausicaa and the imagination of Miyazaki.",1300406400,,1362,5.23394495412844
1137017,5,7884063387,"If you are familiar with some of the newer Miyazaki films (Sprited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo), you might be in for quite a shock with this film.  Princess Mononoke is a little out there, this is waaaaaaaaay out there (in a good way).

When Miyazaki tells a story, one can't help but be drawn into the realm of his imagination.  This film is based on a series of manage (Japanese adult/young adult comics).  The theme boils down to this question: can humans truly coexist and find an equilibrium with their environment.  Set in the distant future of earth, this story gives a warning as to the futility of war (violence begets violence; killing begets more killing) and shows that despite the seeming difficulty, peace can often be more powerful than violence.

Though the animation is dated, I enjoyed taking a trip down memory lane, having grown up in the 80s and familiar with Dragon Ball, Thundercats, G Force, and other fun little 80s anime titles.  For the time, this was cutting edge, and despite the lack of computer editing, the quality of animation is superb.  I do enjoy traditional hand drawn animation and this doesn't let me down.

With the new Blu-Ray DVD combo, I hope that this film can be re-introduced to audiences and gain new fans young and old.  The message in this film is one of hope, and we can all use a little lift in our spirits every now and then.

These are the Bluray special features:

* Behind The Studio: Discover the film's fantastic origins in this fascinating documentary, including an interview with Hayao Miyazaki!

This is a cool featurette about 20 minutes long about the movie and a little with Miyazaki on his inspiration for the film.  It goes into detail about how some of the themes in nausicaa later become signatures of his work.

* Enter the Lands: Explore the many worlds of Studio Ghibli through this interactive map!

This feature has a really cool map of all of Miyazaki's biggest films and you can click on them and it will give a brief description of the movie and all of the characters.  Looks great in HD but all though it has animations on the map of all his movies you can only look at Nausicaa, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Tortoro, castle in the sky, and Ponyo (Porco Rosso, Howls moving castles, spirited awake and princess mononoke are on there but there aren't interactive parts)

* Studio Ghibli Trivia Challenge: You're your Knowledge

On the ""Enter the Lands"" map when you click nausicaa instead of seeing its story and characters description it pulls up this quiz.

* Original Japanese storyboards

great stills of a lot of the art work used to make the movie

These are all the features on the bluray side, the Behind the Microphone: With A-List Voice Talent, The Birth Story Of Studio Ghibli Featurette, and Original TV trailers are all on the dvd so you will have to switch to watch those features.  Overall great and worth owning but if you all ready own the two disc dvd than i would just keep it and not bother upgrading to bluray.  the movie looks clear on bluray but since it is over 25 years old even in high def it doesn't look any better than the bluray does quality wise.  the new bluray features are cool but not worth rebuying if you all ready own it.  if you don't have a copy of this movie all ready definitely but this bluray since the dvd version will run you roughly the same price.",1299715200,2,2231,4.455665024630542
1137019,4,7884063387,"This review is for Nausicaa on Bluray, unfortunately I have to specify since amazon has compiled reviews for Warriors of the Wind, Nausicaa on DVD, and also Nausicaa on Bluray all under this Blu Ray release.
Also, this is not a ""movie review"" it is a review of the BluRay edition of this film. If this was a movie review it would easily earn five stars since this is one of the greatest works of animation ever created, but has it been treated so with this BluRay release? read on to find out.

I couldn't be more excited upon hearing that Nausicaa as well as some other Studio Ghibli films would be released on Bluray in the United States!
I bought this release day at my local Target, it wasn't easy to find at least for its initial release, it took a few tries at other major retailers to find it. And even when I did it wasn't on the shelves they had to retrieve it from the inventory room, the man told me they only recieved 3 copies.
I was very pleased with the chosen artwork for the front cover, a beautiful hand drawn nausicaa with a very minimalistic brown and blue color palette.
Unfortunately, The packaging has no more surprises up its sleeve.
I was a little bummed with the obvious lack of effort that went into this packaging. When opened you will find only Disney advertising inserted inside. No collectable artwork like the new releases of Totoro, Kiki, and Laputa?
nope, you get no inserts that pertain to the movie, just two ugly discs with the same artwork on the disc as the front cover! lame, could this have been any more lazy? It is great artwork don't get me wrong, but repeated 3 times!
The strange thing is the printing on the DVD is really good with high resolution and DPI. But some lazy designer tried to add some really lame design patterns over the BluRay disc art and the image is low resolution and blurry. Thats right, it looks like it was printed on low setting on a home printer. I was very dissapointed with this.

Now on to the BluRay version of the film.

Video

After watching the bluray version a few times I can honestly say this is the ultimate version of this film, but that still doesnt mean it is as good as it could have been.
This is by far the noisiest bluray film I have ever seen. And by ""noise"" I mean digital picture noise. Its really bad. Some scenes look very nice and the Noise level is down, usually on the darker scenes or scenes with a blue tone palette. But some of the day scenes, especially the very beginning of the film and the dust storm look awfull! I would actually prefer watching some of those scenes compressed, and blurred over.
But, on the other hand I realize this is  now a pretty old film, about 27 years old now yikes! So I can give them the benefit of the doubt and understanding that converting this film to bluray isn't always going to be a seamless transition.
But just so im clear, there is far more eye candy in this movie watching it in high def, enough at least to forgive some of the noisy textures. The planes and rigs, as well as some of the scenes from the sea of decay look phenomenal!

sound

The jump to BluRay also doesnt really help with the sound catagory of this film at all. So if you are buying this hoping to watch this film in booming surround sound you wont. Though the english dubs are fairly new recordings the music and sound effects are mostly original and so you are still playing early 1980's recorded music and sound. It still sounds compressed. The quality lacks but the actual musical score is still in my opinion one of the best of Joe Hisaishi.

Extras

The extras are very lacking in this realease, there is nothing new here that isn't on the DVD version of this film. The"" Enter the lands"" world of ghibli is nothing special and is essentially just ads for other ghibli films. The only new addition is the trivia game. It will ask various questions about the film and give you a ranking of your knowledge. Its only mildly entertaining the first time through.

overall 4 out of 5

If your a fan of Nausicaa you are still going to want this release, but if your on the fence about upgrading from the DVD  remember your really only spending the extra money for slightly better picture. If you don't own this film at all I would still recommend this version.
I hope with the future ghibli BluRay releases a little bit more care and effort will go into them.

p.s. the menu screen is really lack luster and at least for me its a pain to load! also the sound effect for the buttons is mixed really load, even when the sound is only playing from the tv speakers the title screen music will be really subtle and the buttons go BOP! BOP! BOP! yikes Disney.",1299628800,14,4661,4.349827387802072
1137020,5,7884063387,"It seems to me that Ghibli find it impossible to create a bad film! Nausicaa is yet another addition to their already high quality catalogue of animation. It follows a princess from a remote kingdom as she tries to save her people, the planet and keep the peace between the warring factions around her. The animation is outstanding and is less cute than 'The Cat Returns' or 'My Neighbour Totoro' and less fantastical than 'Spirited away', it is very gritty yet still as lush and detailed as all Ghibli animations. I'd say this is one aimed more at the adult audience and will make for a couple of hours great viewing. If you enjoy this film I highly recommend the seven series books, they expand the story and lend it a greater depth than the film and really give a good understanding of what the film is trying to achieve.

This is the original japanese version, but dubbed very well into english with big name actors. The animation is sophisticated and sweet by american standards. Overall, its a masterpiece. It tells the story of the last few remaining human ""kingdoms"" gradually being overwhelmed by the toxic jungle, unstopable giant insects - and each other. A thousand years previous, the human race destroyed itself in a single night. Nausicaa is  the main character, a very practical princess in her tiny kingdom. She seems to have a ""way"" with the giant insects.
The story chiefly concerns revealing how the toxic jungle and the insects evolved and why. There is a prophecy that humans and nature will be at piece again one day. That is their only hope. The toxic jungle has consumed all the land and its spores are lethal. The backdrop is the last few remaining kingdoms fighting over ancient weapons. Lots of plot turns - like any japanese tale. And as usual, there is always a small furry pet. I wonder why? Maybe this has meaning in Japan - like a spirit or soul? Anyways, You will love it.

Although costly, it is a very nice upgrade and I have to disagree with the reviewer below who stated that there is not a substantial upgrade over the dvd. First off, the japanese blu-ray is not windowboxed (black bordered) like the dvd version is, and while there are some shots that look fuzzy or out of focus, a large majority of this looks incredibly sharp and detailed with much warmer colors.

HOWEVER, this is all in reference to the Japanese version. There is no guarantee that Disney will use the same transfer for the U.S. release, but if they do then I think the fans will be content.",1294358400,11,720,4.538461538461538
1137026,3,7884063387,"The Nausicaa story was a Manga that Miyazaki wrote between other movie projects during the 70's.
It's a sprawling, wonderful story told in around 1300 pages - possibly the best Manga I've ever read, very comparable
with The Lord of The Rings with a lot of interesting philosophy and plot-twists and future sci-fi details that touch on
artificial intelligience, people attempting to live forever through science, Post-Apocolyptic tribal-warfare, etc.
It has a lot to say.

The movie version is a cut down fragment of the Manga.
Aside from the dazzling visuals, it's not very interesting.
The plot is very nature-earthy Do - gooder etc, but it's not very thoughtful.
It's really aimed at younger kids.  It's a shame they couldn't animate the whole thing.

1137077,3,7884063387,"As a major fan of Nausicaa, this blu-ray release was at the top of my most-wanted list for BR releases of 2010. As soon as the Japanese release date neared this past summer, I could hardly wait. Until I began to read interviews with Studio Ghibli that said (paraphrasing here) that it wouldn't look as crisp as people expect because Ghibli wanted to retain the look of the film when it was first released in theaters. Now, that would be nice, except that 1) few people will have remembered the theatrical release, either because they weren't in Japan, or because they're too young to have seen in back in the mid-80s. 2) Even if you did see it in theaters then, how are you expected to remember it now, anyway, almost 20 years later?

The reviews on the Japanese version of Amazon have been brutal, too, lashing out at the studio for producing a blu-ray transfer that does little to show off the abilities of the medium and media. After I received my own retail copy, I discovered that while the movie is certainly sharper in some areas, there is little to distinguish this version from the previously-released DVD versions. It's not an upgrade worth re-buying if you already own either the Japanese or U.S. Nausicaa DVD. Fortunately it looks like the North American version will ship in a less disastrous blu-ray case than the Japanese version. The JP version featured some beautiful, minimal art showcasing the distinctive silhouette of Nausicaa on her Maeve, but the cardboard housing was useless at keeping the disc in place. The North American version eschews that cover image for more conventional Miyazaki artwork (for better or worse), but presumably ships it in a standard BR box, which is definitely preferable. IMO, the best combination would have been the new school Japanese BR cover art combined with a standard BR case. Maybe the European version will offer that.

If you don't already own Nausicaa on any format, you might as well get the BR. But for anyone looking for a crystal clear, upgraded visual image, you will walk away severely disappointed.

The story is awkwardly compressed, and frankly a bit of a wreck. Despite the nice animation, I didn't enjoy it very much at all.

Mind you, I have no problem with book-to-film translations in general- I thought Lord of the Rings was wonderfully done. This movie just isn't very well written or translated to the screen, though. Frankly, Nausicaa would have worked much better as a one-season tv series.

His stories always reach the hearts of viewers and the imagination, musical score and characters are some of the best in animation. Miyazaki uses very human-like movements in his animation. In addition, much of the art is done using water colors. These stories offer heart felt compassion, strong moral values and a sense of respect towards nature and man.

Nausicaa is among my all time favorites of Miyazaki's films.
The Main protagonist, Nausicaa is a young and fun-loving princess of the serene Valley of the Wind. Viewed by her followers as charismatic and peaceful, she is adored by all. With an uncanny ability to communicate with the giant insects that thrive in the forest around the village. The Forest has been stained with poison, which infested the plant-life and takes to the wind in the form of spores. The guardian of this Poisonous Forest is the Ohmu, a larger than life armored caterpillar-like insect. The Insects come in many shapes and sizes with the Ohm being the most feared and revered amongst them. The insects are able to communicate with each other and sense threats in the forest. When the insects become filled with rage their eyes glow red, and when returned to a state of calm they radiate blue. Thanks to Nausicaa's persistent visits to the Poisonous Forest to gather supplies and research the toxic nature of the valley she calls home. The inhabitants of the valley have become accustomed to living with the insects and forest. Nausicca is an adept fighter taught by Lord Yupa a wondering samurai style character. Who mentors her in fighting skills and wisdom. Nausicca takes to the air on a glider with jet proficiency. Her ability in ""Wind-riding"" serves her well in her exploits and offers a peaceful get away from the hustle and bustle of valley life.
  But when an airship crashes into the valley things begin to take a turn for the worst. Nausicaa rushes to the wreckage to find a young girl shackled to the burning airship. The young girl turns out to be a Princess from another kingdom, who warns her that the cargo of the plane must be destroyed. The cargo, a ""Giant Warrior"". An ancient evil created in a time of war. When a form of Military intervenes and tries to rid the forest of the poison and insects alike, the valleys wise woman Obaba warns that doing so will anger the Ohmu and a catastrophe will follow. The people of the Valley of the Wind are in for tough times and Nausicca leads the way to peace.
Legends tale of a fabled man in blue, that will appear surrounded by a sea of gold and reunite the people of the valley with the nature that surrounds them.

1137180,4,7884063387,"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is really the first feature film effort from Studio Ghibli, and while good, it also has its faults. Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a big Miyazaki fan and that I have seen all the films available in the U.S. already and am belatedly reviewing this one (and I've seen it several times already).  Also, there will be spoilers, so be warned.

The story follows Nausicaa, a princess from a kingdom in ""the Valley of the Wind"", and is set in a post-apocalyptic world filled with a poisonous forest and giant bugs.  Humans struggle to survive in this harsh world, clinging to pockets of safety far enough away from the poisonous forest to stay alive.  Basically, Nausicaa's home is invaded by the warriors from the kingdom of Tolmekia, who plan to burn the toxic forest down in an attempt to reclaim the land.  Of course, Nausicaa believes they should try to live in peace with the forest and bugs and attempts to stop their plans.  And that's the basic plot right there.

First, let's discuss the good things about this film.  It's very nicely animated.  The forest is fantastically drawn and the creatures that inhabit it are varied and creative in appearance.  It's truly a feast for the eyes.  It's also very entertaining as a fantasy film; there's lots of action to keep the viewer engaged.  The third good point about this film is that the villains are very well developed and have a lot of depth to them.  Because of this, the film can spark a lot of room for discussion, which is always good.

Now, on to the negatives.  The biggest negative here is probably Nausicaa herself.  I've heard other people say she is a bit Mary Sue-ish, and it's true.  You may find yourself hating her by the end of the film.  She's just a little too perfect--she tames wild animals within minutes, she single-handedly learns the secrets of the toxic forest, she's the only one who can seem to keep the giant bugs at bay, she's a princess beloved by all, she loves everyone SO MUCH it sometimes causes her to burst into hysterical fits of tears, and to top it all off, she ends up being the chosen one from myth.  And, she's always right, and she loves all the animals...who normally just kill people except for her, cause she's speshul! Yeah...quite a nice list of accomplishments there, princess.  In other words, she's a Mary Sue.  She has no character flaws whatsoever, and none of her ideas are ever wrong, even when they fly in the face of logic.  The only character flaw she has is that she's just too compassionate and caring (which we all know doesn't count!).  To be fair to Miyazaki, he really improves his techniques in later films, which have much better developed main characters.  In fact, you may find that Kushana, the princess of the Tolmekians, is a more interesting character.  Indeed, she may be a villain but she's far from one-dimensional.  On the one hand, she can be ruthless and cruel, but on the other hand, she's intelligent and even respectable in a way.  She has some very good arguments for why she wants to destroy the forest, even if her methods are misguided.  You also get the feeling that she has a biased hatred of the bugs since she was attacked by one in the past, which ate off most of her limbs (she now has cyborg limbs).  Despite her clear bias (which may have clouded her judgment), you get the feeling that her plan to kill off the murderous bugs might have worked if it had come to fruition.

That brings me to the second negative point with this film.  It's clearly an environmentalist film, which isn't in itself a problem, but here it's a little preachy and heavy-handed.  The viewer is meant to side with Nausicaa and her ""we should all live in peace with the forest"" mentality, but I found myself less and less convinced as the movie wears on.  I think the problem is that the villains often bring up very good and valid points which are basically answered with rambling insanity by the ""good guys"".  For example, Kushana asks some of the people from the valley of the wind why they want to coexist with the forest when it's clearly killing them.  The toxins basically give them a disease which kills them off earlier than they'd die naturally.  They answer with a rambling speech about how humans can destroy things quickly but it takes the forest several years to grow back.  Umm, not a valid nor on-topic answer guys.  Or how about another scene where the Peyjites (another kingdom which was invaded by the Tolmekians) wish to fight back against the Tolmekians by baiting a bunch of giant bugs into The Valley of the Wind, since they can use them to destroy the Tolmekians positioned there.  Nausicaa objects of course, to which the Peyjites reply, ""what are we supposed to do, become slaves to the Tolmekians?""  Rather than try to point out how unethical it is to destroy her people in the process, our princess just bursts into a hysterical fit of tears and shrieks out ""so much killing!""  Truly she is a wise ruler.  The biggest problem of all is that this film really doesn't make you feel empathetic towards the bugs or the forest despite it's numerous attempts to do so.  I know some people might disagree with me here, but I didn't feel it.  Of course, I'm no tree-hugger, and I feel that given her situation, I'd rather the humans try and go out fighting rather than slowly be killed off by the forest and it's deadly bug inhabitants.

Miyazaki has really improved his film making in terms of good environmentalist films which don't hit you over the head with the message since he made Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.  The cute Totoros (which are tree spirits) in My Neighbor Totoro did more to make me want to save forests than Nausicaa did.  Even the more adult film Princess Mononoke is a better environmentalist piece since it is less one-sided in its portrayals.

Overall, this is a decent film, and definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of Studio Ghibli.  It's even worth owning since it has a lot of good points to it.  As for the current dvd release itself, it's worth owning for the  lengthy ""history of Studio Ghibli"" segment in the special features.  It also has a section of interviews with the English voice cast.  None of the other special feature are worth it (just trailers and storyboards), but the history is very interesting.  So anyway, if you're a hard-core fan of Ghibli, go ahead and buy this.  If you're just a casual Ghibli fan, you might want to just rent this one.",1263513600,3,6491,4.553925798101812
1137181,5,7884063387,"American pop-actor voice-overs.  I did it this way with Spirited Away, and this one as well.  If we could get English voice-overs with the quality of say Rankin and Bass's The Hobbit, I'd be more into voice-overs.  The only problem with modern day Disney is they'll try to use ""Little Mermaid"" or ""The Incredibles"" style English over a beauty of a film like a Miyazaki which is a little bit like having ketchup on a good steak.  I didn't see this one with the English voice-over so can't comment on it.  I did see (and hear) the voice-over with Spirited Away, and preferred the mystery and vibe of the original sound (Japanese) better.  Whatever.  I suppose it's nice to have the option of both.

Nausicaa is in the same league as Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke.  The graphics in this one are mind-blowing. There's a depth and a spaciousness in the characters and slithery creatures that inhabit this world.  Somewhat symbolically perhaps, pure water lies below the forest of toxins.

The messages are nothing trivial. Human struggle for survival, arrogance of power, evil often as a result of fear rather than bad intentions, values of hard work, sacrifice, respect and cooperation, harmony with the nature through her understanding by intellectual inquisitiveness, yet while retaining awe and respect for the mystical, love of life, people and living creatures.

Three kingdoms feature prominently, and the people of the Valley get caught up in a war between two other kingdoms over control of an ancient warrior that all believe can destroy the jungle.

The protagonist, Nausicaa, is a brave, heartwarming, albeit naive character, and the vocal characterization by Alison Lohman is on target. Also memorable is the vocalization of Patrick Stewart as Lord Yupa.

Miyazaki's pacing is perfect, which is what I like most about him. He gives us plenty of time in the beginning to drink the scenery in. The scenery is beautiful and the music totally immersive. The pace speeds up in the end, and it is a little difficult to keep up with all the things going on at once, but after a couple of viewings you get the picture.

1137368,5,7884063387,"This was the very first Miyazaki film I ever saw. It was on either HBO or SHOWTIME in the early 1980s when VCRs were still rare things in the average home. I fell in love with every aspect of the film - the artwork, the story, the music. I made a copy which I watched until it fell apart. And then it was gone. Lost. I thought I would never see the movie I knew as ""Warriors of the Wind"" ever again.
It was not until comparatively recently that I learned about the man behind the film. It was in a review of ""Princess Mononoke"" that I learned the origin of this wonderful epic.
I was shocked to learn that the version of the film I had seen had been butchered to make it ""more palatable to American audiences"". All the names had been changed. Nausicaa had been changed to Zandra. The Omu were called Gorgons. And key scenes had been chopped out. This DVD restores the film to what it's original form. For this we have John Lasseter of PIXAR animation to thank. Without his friendship and respect  for Mr. Miyazaki, this film, as well as his other masterpieces, might never have been seen in this country in their proper form.
If you love this film as much as I do, you should check out the original manga series on which it is based (drawn and written by Hayao Miyazaki of course). The manga is even richer and there are many more factions vieing for power in the post-apocalyptic world of the Toxic Jungle.

1137373,5,7884063387,"This is one of my favorite movie from Studio Ghibli. Nausicaa is one of my favorite main character and she travels using one of my favorite flying machine, mehve, which is known as a glider. A fox-squarrel, named Teto, is a very cool ""pet"" that I like to call it since Teto is a friend of Nausicaa. Nausicaa cares for the environment and the laws of nature. During the flashback, I love the child singing, which is quite silly to my mind, but I don't let that get to me. However, after I watched the entire movie, my mind still wanted to listen to that sing over and over again. It's just hauntingly beautiful!!! So, during the time when I still have that movie rented from Netflix, I kept watching it again and again the next two days from when I watched. Thus, I was having a hard time mailing the movie back to Netflix, so I bought the movie. Ohmu, a friend of Nausicaa, cares for her at the end of the movie. Hayao Mazaiki (don't know the correct spelling) did a great job with the movie!!! I enjoyed the music and this really helps tell the story of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind! It just matches perfectly with the scene the director intended.

I'd like to thank Disney for not including the introduction as part of the movie when the movie watcher selects ""Play Movie."" In my opinion, it's probably just a spoiler.

I watched the movie in Japanese version and the motions that the director intended to convey is not lost: if you select the Japanese as the soundtrack and enable the English subtitle (not the ""English for the hearing impaired,"" as the dialog can be a bit different), you can watch this movie and still read the captions. This is even if you don't know Japanese.

Personally, I like Japanese version of the soundtrack because I like it with less voicing, but that does not matter. In comparison to other movies: Castle in the Sky's English soundtrack has much more voicing than the Japanese soundtrack, which I do like the Japanese version better. If there's one character's voice I like in the English version of Nausicaa of the Valle of the Wind, it will be Lord Yupa. But that doesn't mean Lord Ypa's voice in Japanese needs to be improved, since the movie has originally been released around 1982, which is the year of when I was born. Choosing a voice for a character is very important, in my opinion, so I like the teenager's voice for Asbel in Japanese version of the movie better than the sound of an adult in the English version. I can easily say the same for Castle in the Sky, but this movie is no big deal.

Will I watch this movie again? Sure I would! I love this movie a lot because-- well, it's excellent!!! I watched the movie in a 57"" HDTV with my home theater system, and it's amazing looking at Nausicaa in the main DVD memu.",1229126400,2,2771,4.40625

1137606,5,7884063387,"My first experience of a Hayao Miyazaki movie was Castle of Cagliostro way back in the early 80's. My second exposure to the same director ( not knowing it was also his work at the time) was the edited version of Nausicaa called Warriors of the Wind, the 1985 VHS release. I thought Warriors of the Wind was good, but much later when I did finally got a chance to experience the original Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind movie I changed my mind and viewed the cuts and edits to the original as some kind of crime.

The characters in the original Nausicaa of the Valley Wind movie are fully realized and very appealing in its full 1 hour and 57 minutes time frame. The story and drama of the film unfolds slowly and almost peacefully, but later the drama and action builds to an epic adventure and to a (jaw-dropping) climax. The structure and pacing of the movie, I thought at the time I view it (the mid 80's) was very rare for an animated film, and, I realized then, that it was not a film done for marketing toys and not done for dancing, singing, or funny kiddy cartoons. Instead, it was an animated feature with a serious straight-forward story about adventure, science fiction, fantasy, and also about human beings and their conflicts.

Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley Wind is not only a remarkable animated film for its time but also a timeless cinema classic for the ages.",1218758400,2,1390,4.490118577075099
1137607,5,7884063387,I recommend this movie highly for children seven and up.  My son and I selected this film rather than go to the theater to see the latest summer blockbusters.  The message of the piece about respecting nature and not taking it for granted was definately worthwhile.  I viewed the film as did two nine-year-old boys and a twelve-year-old girl and we all enjoyed it.  The children agreed it was one of the best films they had seen in a long time.  There is some violence and it may not be appropriate for children younger than seven.,1218585600,2,531,4.489583333333333
1137608,3,7884063387,"I wonder what my impression of this movie would have been if this were my first encounter with Miyazaki.  Yes, Nausicaa has the same remarkable imagination of Miyazaki found in all his films.  Fascinating and grotesque creatures abound throughout.  Unfortunately, this film simply does not hold up in comparison to the three other Miyazaki films I have yet seen (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle).

The real problem is probably that Miyazaki had not yet matured as a feature director.  There is too much dialogue when scenes would work just as well, or even better, if we were just allowed to be drawn in visually.  And as a whole it is poorly plotted.  Two hours was not too long for Spirited Away, but it is too long here.  I suspect that part of the problem was transitioning from the original serialized story to a longer piece.

One of the greatest reasons that Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle are more mature films is because they didn't take themselves so seriously.  The comic moments in both of those films easily survive translation.  Nausicaa also pales beside Princess Mononoke, in this case because the two films are so similar.  Hero works to save the remaining humans from rampaging forest creatures filled with rage at human abuse of the environment.  In the case of Mononoke, the ecological message serves the plot and characters.  In the case of Nausicaa, the ecological message is preachily rammed down our throats.

In the end, Nausicaa is more than decent, but it not Miyazaki's best.  The problem is that it does not distinguish itself enough from other anime films.  Don't watch it assuming that it will be another Spirited Away.  Watch it to see where Miyazaki has been, and to realize how far he has come.",1215043200,15,1763,4.82
1137609,4,7884063387,"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a landmark anime film directed by Hayao Miyazaki.  The film is based off of a manga by the same name that was made by Miyazaki.

The film takes place one thousand years after the ""Seven Days of Fire.""  This catastrophe destroyed human civilization and most of Earth's original ecosystem.  A few scattered human settlements survive, but they are isolated from each other by the Sea of Decay (a lethally toxic jungle of fungus that is swarming with giant insects).

Nausicaa is the princess of the Valley of the Wind, and she possesses an unusual gift for communicating with the giant insects in the Sea of Decay (where she will go, while wearing a mask, to conduct scientific research).  The valley is threatened when another state unearths a God Warrior embryo; the God Warriors were one of the giant, biological weapons used in the ancient war.  The embryo is stolen by another state, and this state's ship crashes into the valley while transporting the embryo.  The people of the valley are forced into armed resistance, and Nausicaa must find a way to bring a resolution to the situation.

This DVD release contains two DVDs.  The second DVD just includes the storyboard version of the film.  The first disc contains three extras: a ""Behind the Microhpone"" documentary (interviews with the English dub cast), a documentary entitled ""The Birth of Studio Ghibli,"" and the original theatrical and TV trailers for Nausicaa.  The documentary was very informative, but I was disappointed that Disney decided to overdub English over the Japanese audio, instead of leaving the Japanese audio and putting subtitles on the screen.

The film is wonderfully done, and utilizes its environmental undertones well.  The writing, storytelling, lush animation, and music combine together to make this film a masterpiece.",1214956800,2,1844,5.042904290429043

Being a fan of the more popular anime shows and movies such as Dragon Ball Z and Akira I knew that these magical films would soon be seen.

In 1984 the very first film by this group of talanted animators was born. 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind' tells a story of a far off future where a strange toxic jungle is engulfing the entire planet Earth. Through time there were many battles between the insects and surviving human kingdoms trying to keep both worlds far from one another. Then there is the kingdom of the valley of the wind ruled by Princess Nausicaa a fearless and caring girl who had always been able to find the beauty in everything, even the toxic jungle. Suddenly her kingdom is invaded by one of the most ruthless of human kingdoms. Saying they are there to protect her people she along with a cunning young prince find that the humans are hatching a plot that only Nausicaa can prevent.

1137613,4,7884063387,"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1985) - Hayao Miyazaki

There really needs to be something said about the work of Hayao Miyazaki.  His completely unique vision and overall creativity has manifested in possibly the most amazing streak of great animated films ever produced.  In fact, it even gives early Disney, renaissance era Disney, and modern day Pixar a fight.  His body of work is truly astounding.  He just about never fails to deliver an extremely engaging story filled with wonderful characters and amazing visuals, and with Nausicaa, he succeeds once again.

This is without a doubt one of his best films, although it has an overall different feel and tone when compared to some of his later masterworks.  I have read a few critics calling it less refined than some of his later works, such as Mononoke and Spirited Away, but I don't think they really know what they're talking about.  I'm almost certain that the more subdued overall feel is a choice, and never does the film feel ""clunky"", which is what one reviewer called it.  Now, what does this overall slower pace and muted tone lead to?  For one, it leads to a more meditative feel, which fits this film perfectly because, thematically, Nausicaa is probably Miyazaki's strongest.  It deals with the situation of man vs. nature and pacifism vs. war.  It's clear that Miyazaki strongly believes in pacifism over violence and he displays it beautifully through the main character of Nausicaa, who has to be one of the greatest heroines in all of film.  The choices and sacrifices she makes throughout the narrative create a genuine inspiration within the viewer that is hard to contain.

Oh, and there's the visuals.  Miyazaki is a master of visual art, bottom line.  His creativity is absolutely amazing; he is able to create worlds filled with so much detail that they almost appear real, even if they occur only in dreams.  The cavern of petrified trees below the Sea of Decay, in particular, is absolutely stunning.  Thus, in summary, please buy this movie.  You will not be disappointed.

On an interesting note, all of my friends that have read both the manga and watched the movie unanimously agree that the manga is infinitely superior, which is a little frightening, considering how good the movie is.",1205884800,3,2278,4.852331606217617

This time around Studio Ghibli told Disney they could distribute it if they kept their mitts off it. And it shows, the voice actors are top-notch and the story line is kept intact. If you are looking for some classic anime you can't go wrong with this version.  I've read that the animation looks dated but i have to disagree here. It's nice to see olde anime as you can get an idea of how anime has progressed thru the years.
While it's no AKIRA as far as anime goes it still holds up quite well in today's anime circles. If you've enjoyed any of Studio Ghibli's work such as Kiki's Delivery Service , Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away then this is a must for your collection.",1203984000,,947,4.344632768361582
1137847,3,7884063387,"Once again, Studio Ghibli proves that art is often more important than story. The animation and backgrounds of this film were truly impressive, but the convoluted (and frankly nutty) storyline sucked some the life juices out of the visuals. I was left with red eyes of rage after I sat through my first viewing. My family wanted to watch it to see what could have transformed my eyes into red-hot coals of fury, so I prepared them for the eco-blather that they would soon be subjected to and played the tripped out acid lake-laced animovie. Instead of turning a frightening sanguine hue, my familys' eyes took on a glazed, ""what the ..?"" muted tone.

The best thing to do to make watching Nausicaa a little less nauseating is to turn off the sound.

Key things to remember when watching a Studio Ghibli film:
- Hand-drawn and painted animation is still superior to the best computer graphics
- Man is always bent on the destruction of the Earth
- Everything organic is good for you
- Technology is bad, unless it flies

Now I have to say that I'm a big, big fan of Hayao Miyazaki's stuff, usually. But every once in a while he does something that I just can't wrap my head around. Everyone but me is insanely fond of Princess Mononoke. I saw it once, and have had no desire to see it again, even when I've seen Kiki's Delivery Service more times than I can count, and Spirited Away probably a dozen times more than that. Then there is Nausicaa.

What should have been a great story is turned into a political polemic. Nausicaa (voiced, in the American version, by White Oleander's Alison Lohman) is a princess in a post-apocalyptic world, living in the Valley of the Wind, one of the last remaining outposts of humans in a world ruled by the Ohmu, huge insects who protect the Toxic Forest from human encroachment. Nausicaa wants to find some way to bring the humans and the ohmu harmony, but another faction of humans, the warlike Tolmekians, want to revive the Flame Giants to destroy the ohmu and allow humanity to rule the planet again. Along the way, we're treated to knee-jerk environmentalism, pacifism, and various other isms that are quite popular until people actually start thinking about them.

While, technically, it's just as fine as any other Miyazaki film, its syrupy sweetness and staunch refusal to treat the subjects it addresses with any depth whatsoever are hard to choke down, like cake that's little sponge and much frosting. The token ""victory pulled from the jaws of defeat"" ending is just the poisonous berry that tops it all off. For Miyazaki completists only. * ",1199318400,9,1629,4.725352112676056

Distributed by Disney, Disney wishes they could find such compelling story lines and flawless cell-based animation.

The imagination behind this film is incredible.  Epic in scale, it seems to belong to something far bigger than the already vast landscape you see on the screen.  Even without the dialog, I understood enough of the story through the visuals alone that it swept me along right up until the near-catastrophic ending.

Now I have the DVD.  I still prefer to watch it in Japanese because the English voice-overs don't get the characters quite right.  I like Miyazaki's brand of feminism, where the female lead is strong not in spite of her female sensitivities, but because of them.  Her strength comes from kindness, compassion, self-sacrificing, curiosity, and a quiet courage that allows her to give in when giving in is best for others.  Although it is cool to hear Patrick Stewart as Lord Yoppa, I felt that the girl who voiced Nausicaa didn't quite get it.

Unlike some of the other Disney DVD releases of Miyazaki's films, this one includes a documentary about the making of the film.  It isn't as snappy as some making-of documentaries I've seen, but I found it very informative.

I do think that whoever decided to put Nausicaa in tight, nearly skin colored leggings made a poor style choice.  That disturbed me for the first several minutes until I realized she actually was wearing pants (whew!).

Borrowing its apocalyptic scenario from Miyazaki's own manga originals, this dark fantasia pits a band of warrior activists against the encroachment of a poisonous environment. As always with Miyazaki, this is a world where good and evil coexist, sometimes in the same character. Splendid visuals, great voice acting by Thurman, Stewart, and Lohman, and an absorbing finale make this a science-fiction film with a heart, mind, and message.",1183939200,,655,5.4950495049504955

Don't be afraid that Mr. Miyazaki is trying to insult you in this movie. Miyazaki did not create this film to preach about global warming at all of us un-enlightened fools, he made it because it is a great story. The environmental message is that mindlessly destoying the earth is bad, not that driving a car is going to melt Antarctica.  This film showcases the power of human creativity, not our evil treatment of the earth. Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is set in a world where a horrible war devistated the planet and now it must heal. The environmental problems of Nausicaa's earth are immense, not like the possible issues that some people think might be happening and/or might happen on our earth. Nausicaa is a wise, careful girl that actually understands how to deal with environmental problems and she ended up saving the world because of her patience. She shows how despite our human imperfections, we can still do great things. She is not a flawless, she gets angry in multiple scenes and is certainly not perfect, which shows how human this whole story is. And some other characters demonstrate how human sinfulness can cause abysmal mistakes. This is a classic among classics and whether anime is your thing or not, you will love this movie (I would know, I don't like most anime). Miyazaki never made a bad movie, so anything by him is recomended by me, especially Spirited Away.",1182988800,,1545,4.680147058823529

So I thought to complete the collection I would get Nausicaa (and of course the other two eventually). However, when I watched Nausicaa, from the first 20 minutes, mostly from when I saw her nude to the end of the movie, I was bored. I tried to like it but it made little sense to me. I liked the graphics and I liked the main theme of music. But the other music was kind of weird. I felt like I was listening to an 80's music theme. I didn't feel like I could connect with the characters and they all seemed flawed. I would suggest at least renting this one first, but I am glad I bought it anyway because I want the whole collection of Miyazaki's movies. I'll just say it was an early anime when he started out.

Nausicaa tells the story of Princess Nausicaa who helps rule the valley of the wind, one of the last places for humans on earth.  This is because 1000 years ago the world was destroyed by war bringing on an onslaught of poisonous plants that covered the earth.  Peace loving Nausicaa desperately tries to find a way to restore human's connection with nature and bring an end to the war around her.

Despite the fact this movie is definitly one of the better decisions I've made in my life, I have to say I hate the music.  There are times when it can be completely corny, and almost ruined the movie for me.  To put it this way, it's the kind of music I'd expect to find in a video game as opposed to an epic movie like this.

The plot is simple: a story about a girl, Princess Nausicaa of The Valley of the Wind. This minute, windmill-filled town is one of few places on Earth untouched by the Toxic Jungle. Due to horrible wars and tragedies among the human race, most of the Earth is covered by a mutated, poisonous forest that no human can survive in without a breath mask. To make things worse, enormous insects called Ohm live in this worldwide jungle--when someone disturbs the Ohm, everyone pays for it.

However, Nausicaa does not hate and fear the Ohm like the rest of humankind does. She is a sort of 'Doctor Dolittle'--someone who loves and understands all animal and insect life. She dares to venture out to the Toxic Jungle, exploring its nooks and crannies.

But the remnants of past conflicts still remain hidden on the Earth. Several gigantic creatures, doomsday machines of sorts, were put into hibernation at the end of the last war. Now, power-hungry kingdoms, still untouched by the Toxic Jungle, lust after those creatures and begin planning to awaken one, intending to use it for domination of the world. Nausicaa becomes irrevocably involved in this drama.

This story is classic to anime--incredibly convoluted and filled with commentary on humankind's mistakes. It remains a perfect fantasy that can be enjoyed and understood by everyone.",1175644800,,1570,4.890977443609023

Eventually I got the real japanese version on EBAY even before it was released domestically. I watched it at least 100 times. It's one of the few films I never seem to tire of. laputia by Hayao Miyazaki is also way up there alongside this film. All his films are so great. Still Nausicaa is my favorite. It has a great story, amazing characters, fantastic landscapes and creatures, wonderful music, and is beautifully animated. I have since tracked down the CD score, as well as an amazing book, The Art of Nausicaa.

1138597,5,7884063387,"Nausicaa is the first original full length animation film Miyazaki did. Back then, Studio Ghibli wasn't even a viable business. I am a terminal case addict for all Miyazaki/Ghibli films, but this is the one made me that way. The story so original, so powerful, and the graphics so stunning, accompanied by such beautiful music by Joe Hisaishi, no one ever produced something like Nausicaa, ever. Animation or live action.

In my humble opinion, not even Miyazaki himself surpassed this great work.

Yes, I love Spirited Away, Porco Rosso, Princess Mononoke, Castle in the Sky, Howl's Moving Castle, Totoro (though English version could use some work) and the like, this is still my unflenching number one choice.

What's even more stunning about this story is that the film features only 1/3 of the whole epic saga of princess Nausicaa. When he propose this full length animation film, the movie studio blasted at him, that how can they invest on such project when it doesn't even have an original story. So Miyazaki wrote the original epic saga featuring the kite flying princess. Only the first 1/3 made it to the movie. Now that the maestro is retired, there is no hope that the rest of the story will ever be made to the silver screen, but the English translated version of the books (there are six volumes) are released in the U.S.

Like most of the other Miyazaki movies I've seen, the animation is a gorgeous feast for the eyes; there's simply nothing like it among today's crop of computer generated animated fare.

Beyond the rich visuals, I think the storyline of Nausicaa translates for American audiences better than many of the other Studio Ghibli productions. A more serious work than Totoro, making it appealing for older kids, it also avoids some of the more graphic and at times startling images and themes found in Princess Mononoke and Sprited Away, although I was a little surprised when I first realized that Nausicaa apparently wears no underpants.

It's as though the viewer never gets to relax and just view.  In Japanese animation there are often lulls of  musicless movement that are very active but almost in a meditative internal sort of way.

""One of the Best Films of Any Type Ever Made.""

""Greatest Animated Film of All Time.""

""Best Movie I've Ever Seen.""

Please help me!

This film story is about a young female heroine (who can't afford underpants) with a good heart and a desire to stop all killing in a future world dominated by giant worms. And a worm is a perfect mascot for the tedious, snail crawling pace of this film (everyone viewing almost fell asleep). The plot is slow to develop, character development lacking and animation primitive at best. Of the three Miyazaki films I own, this is the worst. Does it matter who wrote the screenplay? When you put your name on it, it's yours. ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and ""Spirited Away"" (which won an Academy Award) have qualities that are totally lacking in this film. These films had characters who's evolution touched my heart, a storyline which captivated me and animation that made me forget that this was animation. Not so with ""Nausicaa"".

The reviewer who claimed that this is ""One of the Best Films of Any Type Ever Made"". has obviously never seen ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Ten Commandments"", ""Ben Hur"" or even ""The Wizard of Oz"".

The reviewer who stated that this is ""The Greatest Animated Film of All Time."" has probably never seen ""Dumbo"", Pinocchio"" or the new ""Over the Hedge"" or ""Open Season"" (the animation of the bear fur is beyond realistic).

So if you're an animation freak like I am (and not someone who's been paid by Miyazaki to praise his inferior work), who lets the eyes and heart decide what's a good film and if you want good Miyazaki film, pass on this one. If you want great animation, buy ""Dumbo"" or ""Pinocchio"". And if you want great films, buy any of the classics like the four movies mentioned before or ""King Kong"", ""Godzilla"" or any of the other top 100 films listed by the American Film Institute.

""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"", so don't let the myopic vision of reviewers blind you to a bad movie choice made by people who really don't get out much.

Princess Nausica is the very epitome of the Studio Ghibli / Hayao Miyazaki ideal - a strong, spirited, rational, intelligent, compassionate and gentle young woman, who dominates the film.

We find ourselves a thousand years in the future and an earlier global war has made almost all of the earth uninhabitable by humans. Various despotic and rogue states vie with each other for the meagre resources and habitable spaces left for mankind. Remnants of an earlier highwe level of technology are left over, but most of the what is left of the human race has reverted back to a pseudo-Medieval state, with its associated level of technology. Mutated insects and plants now rule the earth.

The film is also a morality tale and a warning about our treatment of the world in which we live. Yes, it is an animation, well, an Anim, actually!, but it is a film probably better suited to older children, teenagers and adults.

Nausica: Valley Of The Wind is a sustained and powerful film from the master film maker, Hayao Miyazaki. You should see it at least once!",1161388800,2,1168,4.74384236453202
1138861,5,7884063387,"I first saw Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind when it was shown on cable TV in the late 80s.  I remember being amazed at the artwork, the design of the aircraft, the way the insects and the jungle were brought to life.  I had seen Star Blazers and was watching Robotech but this movie was on a whole different level.  Now the masterpiece is back.

The story, like many Studio Ghibli would make deals with mankind and how we treat ourselves and our Earth.  We have poisoned the planet, by either war or other reasons, and now it is trying to heal itself.  A toxic jungle tries to cleanse the soil while giant insects, the biggest being the Ohmu, guard the jungle.

Nausicaa, voiced by Alison Lohman, is a Princess of the Valley of the Wind who is studying the jungle and the insects, trying to understand what is happening, why it is happening and if she can protect her people from it.  For as the trees clean the soil they also poison the air - this seems to be a byproduct of the process.  Asbel, voiced by Shia La Beouf, is a Prince that she helps see that warfare and violence, against other people or against the forest, is nothing but a dead end.

Other voices include Chris Sarandon, Mark Hamill, Edward James Olmos, Patrick Stewart and Uma Thruman.

Fox-squirrels can also be seen in Castle In The Sky, so I am not sure if the events in Nausicaa, the movie, happens after or before the events seen in the later one or even if the two are somehow linked.  It could just be an inside joke.  They have them in most of the movies made by Ghibli.

1138862,5,7884063387,"I don't know anime, but I know what I like. I've always said it, and probably will always say it. ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"", a 1984 film by Hayao Miyazaki, is a film I like a lot. It's unique, it's got atmosphere, and it's got a great message, I thought.

Nausicaa is the pretty, caring and well loved princess of the valley of the wind, a communal little place who get by on their crops and various wind powered devices.  They live in a world far into our future, a world where civilization as we know it has been destroyed and reinvented. It's a world of giant insects, poisonous forests and deadly spores, of petrified trees, of rival kingdoms, of prophecies and complex ecosystems. It is a very interesting world indeed.

It's a colourful and unique work, and the curious creatures in the film are intriguing. It's all very well drawn, and well paced, there's enough time to soak it all in, to consider what everything is and what's going on. Though it's used sparingly, (which is a good thing) I quite liked the music. There's some organ, some synths, a bit of orchestral stuff and some pretty 1980s drums (I think its a drum machine). Fitted the film well, I thought. Nausicaa is a sensitive yet strong girl, and she's as fascinating as everything around her as a character. The themes are pretty fascinating too. Even in the far future, it seems that man is still the same here, squabbling among itself, misunderstanding the environment that keeps it alive. The idea of nature itself being able to solve its own problems (by forcing a threatening species to become extinct) was a notable one, too.

When I heard Disney signed a deal with Hayao Miyazaki to bring out all of his films, I was excited. Was alittle disappointed when Nausicaa was not in the first batch of films to be released but I did in enjoy the first set(Castle in the Sky was my favorite from the first batch).

Nations war with each other over the remaining space and resources.  The idyllic life of the Valley of the Winds comes to an end when it is conquered by the warlike Tokumekians, launching the princess Nausicaa on an adventure that will enable her to save her people and reestablish a bond between the humans and the land.

This early effort from the masterful animator Hayao Miyazaki offers imaginative visuals, stirring action, and a provocative theme, although it does not quite rise to the level of some of his later efforts.  Thematically, it compliments Miyazaki's later ""Princess Mononoke,"" a story of the distant past in which man and nature were becoming estranged.  ""Nausicaa"" shows them coming back together again.  The hallmarks of the Miyazaki style are evident here: resourceful heroines, humanistic themes, strong relationships, and fantastic creatures.",1142035200,,1019,5.298136645962733
1139110,5,7884063387,"Miyazaki Hayao's first big film Nausicaa of the Valley of the Winds was released in 1984. Based upon Miyazaki's manga, it follows the futuristic barren wasteland that Earth has become, ravaged by industrial toxins and radiation. Small pockets of civilization perch on the edge of the Sea of Decay, among them Nausicaa's Valley of the Winds, untouched by toxic mold spores. Nausicaa is a young princess with the ability to talk to animals and insects, using charms to keep them from destroying themselves and others. She is a fearless leader of her people, who wants to stop the bloodshed between warring factions and stop the murder of giant insects such as the Ohmu. Although altruistic, she possesses a dangerous, unpredictable rage. There is a prophecy in the land that a ""...a person clad in blue standing in a golden field  will find the bond between humanity and the earth, and lead the people to a pure land...""

The Valley is threatened when a ship from neighbouring Pejite crashes and releases toxic mold spores, along with a much more dangerous foe: one of the Giant God Soldiers responsible for the Seven Days of Fire, in which the world was nearly destroyed by nuclear radiation. Nausicaa finds the princess of Pejite inside, chained and mortally wounded.

The Valley is threatened by the appearance of Princess Kushana of Torumekia, who seizes power in a coup, killing Nausicaa's father. She seeks to resurrect the Giant God Soldier, whose nuclear weapons can destroy both enemies and the hordes of destructive insects that ravage the land. Nausicaa escapes, and must save her beloved valley from a stampede of enraged Ohmu...

The story, visuals, music, and sheer creativity are simply amazing. This is one of Miyazaki's most original, moving efforts, and I've seen nearly all his films from Nausicaa to Howl's Moving Castle. His frequent lament on the destruction of nature is at its most poignant here, the small seeds of hope blossoming into renewal. Visuals are strongly drawn from medieval costumes and castles in the Valley, the ships look like something from Star Trek, and the insects gave me nightmares (and I thought the giant cockroaches in my office were scary (!). I hope to get my hands on a copy of the original manga (in Japanese) to read more fully into the lush backstory of Nausicaa.

1139116,5,7884063387,"I'd say Nausicaa of Valley of the Wind.  Its flying machines, settings and creatures, all wonderfully created that can make you believe, for a second, that these things exist.  These elements all show you a glimpse of how far imagination (especially Miyazaki's) can go... anywhere and everywhere.

As for the storyline, sure, there has been many movies about how we must save the environment and anti-war, and many more storylines dealing with a post war society, but Miyazaki does it in a purely non-preachy way.  Also, the storyline is not just anti-war and pro-environmentalism, but also attacks the deeper questions, such as ""What kind is sacrifice is really okay?"" when those retaliating the military plan on sacrificing other people for the 'good' of everyone. It also has its elements of differences from other movies with the same storyline, such as the misunderstanding of the mutant bugs and the Toxic Jungle, which deviates from the common ""they are here to destroy the humans"" plot, but instead take a beautifully role in the movie.  This movie was made in 1984, and it still applies to the world today.  Pretty impressive for a movie that old.

Last but not least, Joe Hisaishi does the music, which matches every single shot of the movie, communicating the feelings and emotions of the story.  If you don't appreciate the movie, at least you'll enjoy the music, although I seriously doubt not liking the movie is even an option.",1139788800,4,1442,4.929752066115703
1139314,5,7884063387,"I don't know what it is but there's this thing that happens with Hollywood where when something is big or something upcoming, then you re-release the previous stuff, and sell it as ""special editions"". So after Spirited Away won the Oscar, is it any surprise that Hayao Miyazaki's films got a bigger release than previously? But that's ok since Nausicaa is actually a very good film anyway but still, it's odd how we get wind of it only after he won a big award.

Years after the Earth got decimated by the Seven Days of Fire, people live in fear of a jungle, which happens to contain poisonous spores and massive insects. The princess of the Valley of the Wind, Nausicaa, wants to investigate and study the jungle rather than exterminate it. This poses a problem since a well meaning but wrong way kingdom wants to resurrect a giant Warrior, huge beasts that are incredibly powerful. So Nausicaa and her friends have to stop not only the kingdom from using the Warrior but saving the Earth from poison.

With Miyazaki films, you can obviously expect big wondrous locales and extravagant worlds and of course Nausicaa has them all. With airships, giant insects and an ecological message, it's undoubtedly a Miyazaki film. Even character designs are quite similar with big eyes and small noses. In fact in one scene, a character is able to slip by a guard by pretending to be somebody else even though he's basically the male version of her face.

What's quite a good surprise is the English VA's. Alison Lohman is perfect as Nausicaa and for once there's a strong female protagonist and Alison is quite capable. Then we have also reliable Patrick Stewart, Edward James Olmos, the Bride herself Uma Thurman and Chris Sarandon, best known probably for doing Jack the Pumpkin King. Each actor doesn't overplay their part and if a line of dialogue may be up to snuff, at least the emotion is.

You can probably make a strong case that many of Miyazaki's films are rewritten: many of the films are characters experiencing or living in a world beyond simple reality with fantastic elements and taaalll things. But that's ok, Nausicaa's a great film anyway and an anime highlight.",1139702400,3,2172,4.753315649867374
1139315,3,7884063387,"'Nausica of the Valley of the Wind' is a curious movie - it's got all the elements of a true animated classic - great storyline, lovable heroine, scary monsters, and so forth - and it's got more than enough clever parallels and morals to make this one enjoyable on an adult level, too - expounding on the virtues and evils of things like environmentalism, war, forgiveness and xenophobia - but all in all, it doesn't really manage to capture the imagination in the way that Miyazaki's later classics 'Spirited Away' and 'Porco Rosso' did.

To synopsise the plot, briefly: in the distant future, man is reduced to living out a bare sort of existence on the outskirts of the deadly, creature-spawning Toxic Forest. Nausicaa, a princess of the Valley of the Wind, is suddenly caught up in a war between neighbouring kingdoms to gain control of the ultimate weapon to destroy the forest - which, she discovers, is helping, not hindering, man's progress.

I didn't watch the English dub on this DVD, so I can only assume that the vocal talents of high-calibre actors such as Uma Thurman and Patrick Stewart are, as dubs go, top-notch. I prefer to immerse myself in the original, as-intended-by-the-creators atmosphere of the movie, and so, in Japanese, the characters in Nausicaa come across as a relatively run-of-the-mill bunch - beautiful young heroines sound like beautiful young heroines, sychopahantic bad guys sound like sychopahantic bad guys and grizzled old ladies sound like - that's right! - grizzled old ladies. On the whole, it's a likeable, if somewhat perfunctory, audio atmosphere, and the 80's synth score is, sadly, a little flat by today's standards.

Animation-wise, while not in the same league as 'Spirited Away', 'Nausicaa' is still a jaw-droppingly beautiful thing to look at, and must have been doubly so on its initial release. The imagination and innovation contained in the designs of the characters, weaponry and surroundings is matched only by the sense of awe we feel in witnessing the simplicity and elegance of these moving pictures. As with any good hand-drawn animation, this is like watching poetry - a fluid and absorbing sense of movement and rhythm, thrown into high relief by our appreciation of the fact that someone had to all this by hand.

This 'mixed-bag' feeling of the audio/visuals is played out, too, in the storyline. Yes, it's got a universal appeal, in that both adults and children will be able to appreciate and learn from the plot - more recently, cross-generational entertainment like the Harry Potter books and the Lord of the Rings movies supply the same thing - but here, I can't help wondering if the story could retain the interest of the casual viewer long enough for those lessons to be learned. While the 'Warriors of the Wind' cut of this movie stank, I must admit that there were points in 'Nausicaa' where I found myself wishing for the pace to pick up, or for a new set of circumstances to look at. It's an oddly-paced movie - the action sequences at the beginning of the film, though event-laden, are slow-moving enough to almost (but not quite!) approach dullness.

But for all of that, please don't think 'Nausicaa' is a bad movie, because it isn't, and far from it. It's an elegant, beautiful-looking piece of animated cinema with some elements of sound and situation that, unfortunately, don't match the quality of those set down in later Ghibli productions.

But it comes with my recommendation, just the same.",1139443200,4,3480,4.909863945578231

1139317,5,7884063387,"Quite possibly the best animated film made during the 1980's, ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"" crosses science fiction with war scenes of palpable emotional impact. The end result is more ambitious than expected, as the movie reflects on the hypocrisy of war, and mankind's capacity of terrible acts during times of conflict. Even without too much graphic human suffering, ""Nausicaa..."" leaves a mark the way ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" left theirs. Yes, the movie also contains flying airships, strange creatures, and psychic powers, but writer/director Hayao Miyazaki merely uses them as context for the issue that's really preoccupying him.

The movie takes place one thousand years after a fiery cataclysm decimates humanity. All remnants of the human race have dispersed, and a ""Toxic Jungle"" serves a natural barrier between nations. This enchanted forest contains giant insects, trees that would dwarf the redwoods, and plants that release strange white spores. Inhaling the spores over long periods of time can prove fatal, as the people of the Valley of the Wind, who used to live closer to the ""Toxic Jungle,"" know all too well.

In hopes of finding a cure for the lethal powders produced by the flora, Princess Nausicaa, pride and joy of her people, makes regular journeys to the ""Toxic Jungle."" A top gun behind the controls of her jet ski/hang glider hybrid, the princess is even more likable for how much she clearly cares about her subjects. When she stumbles across the abandoned shell of an Ohm, an elephantine mollusk whose shell features translucent skylights for ""eyes,"" Nausicaa's first thoughts have to do with the potential benefits for the valley. Unfortunately, casual activities such as this, and saving her friend from a ticked-off insect that chases him halfway across an adjacent desert, eventually give way to a more serious story. Very soon, war arrives at the doorstep of her home.

The kingdom of Tolmekia does not formally declare war on the Valley of the Wind. However, some very important cargo crashes down nearby, and their army rushes in to secure it. The siege leaves Nausicaa's father, the king, murdered, and her people inducted into the Tolmekians' master plan. Unfortunately, Tolmekia's main enemy, another relatively advanced kingdom called Pejite, cannot separate unwitting foes from genuine ones, so they plan to wipe out the entire valley using a very clever strategem.

Miyazaki, who has addressed the topic of war in other features (most recently, ""Howl's Moving Castle""), paints the conflict in ""Nausicaa..."" as a potentially endless cycle of atrocities. Ironically, those who inflict there terrible deeds, the director argues, sincerely believe that humanity will benefit from their actions. For example, the Tolmekians plan to use the cargo, which they stole from Pejite, to destroy the ""Toxic Jungle"" once and for all. The way Princess Kushana, the officer in charge of the Tolmekian army, sees it, the forest must be destroyed, or mankind will spend the rest of eternity living at the mercy of the insects.

On the flipside, Pejite is ready to unleash a glowing, red-eyed Hell upon the Valley of the Wind. Their main purpose, however, isn't preventing their rival's machinations, but getting the cargo back, so they can level the ""Toxic Jungle"" themselves. Like the Tolmekians, Pejite also wants to return mankind to its former, loftier position. However, they are deathly afraid of Tolmekia being the sole possessor of a power as destructive as that cargo. To Nausicaa, who spends time as a prisoner of both kingdoms, the mutual willingness to kill innocents to achieve a goal makes Tolmekia and Pejite equals in her eyes. But Asbel, a vengeful young pilot/prince from Pejite, takes umbrage. ""All the Tolmekians want is to take over the world,"" he says. ""We are nothing like them."" His words only serve to underscore his naivete. After all, since when does any participant in a war not view themselves in a superior moral light compared to the enemy?

Luckily, Miyazaki constantly reminds the audience what ""fighting a just war"" really implies. As the conflict between the two nations draws in creatures from the ""Toxic Jungle,"" it's the weak who suffer most, while those in power get to indulge their most sadistic impulses. Whether it's images of women and children huddled together, hungry and scared, while the menfolk prepare war plans; the old adage ""burning a village in order to save it"" brought to startling reality for heroes returning home; a battlefield littered with the corpses of soldier dragonflies (an allegorical shot that's just as potent as what Miyazaki intended them to represent); or, most appallingly, a display of near-unbearable cruelty visited upon an innocent life for the expressed purpose of stirring up its comrades, trust that in ""Nausicaa...,"" war contains enough pain for everyone, regardless of gender, age, or species.

Indeed, like most modern war movies, ""Nausicaa..."" is a veritable minefield of moral transgressions. Even the titular heroine commits one. It's out of character, of course; through most of the movie, she shows nothing less than absolute respect towards all living things. This one action becomes a blemish, something she spends the rest of the movie trying desperately to redeem. Interestingly, Miyazaki won't excuse her simply because it is wartime. Human beings are not animals, he seems to be arguing. Our ability to rationalize, to accept the complexities of a given situation, sets us apart from the beasts, who are slaves to their baser instincts.

These baser instincts, such as the need for revenge, cause Nausicaa's people to take up arms against the Tolmekian invaders. It seems that their doomed airship carried spores from the ""Toxic Jungle,"" spelling the end for a beloved orchard. Can Nausicaa save her people's souls, lest they become beasts, or worse, standard-issue characters from a war flick? Miyazaki's other films during the same decade (""Castle in the Sky,"" ""Kiki's Delivery Service"") tended towards happy resolutions, so don't expect the writer/director to deviate this time, either, even if that makes ""Nausicaa..."" less tragic, and radically different, from just about every other lock-and-load epic that came before.",1137801600,3,6269,5.206144697720515

  NOw to my actual review...

  Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is the timeless story of a young princess desperate to save her peaceful valley from the warring kingdoms of man and nature in an apocolyptic future world.

  This is certainly a gorgeous, gorgeous film worth watching in any sense. Miyazaki has a beautiful gife for storytelling and will keep you entranced with his epic storytelling and unforgettable characters.

  Headed by reknown stars such as Patrick STuart, Uma Thurman, and even Alison Lohman, the vocal performances are strong and the script well plotted.

  THough My personnal favorite still remains ""Castle in the Sky"", I found this film highly engaging and thought provoking. In this movie I could see hints of future characters such as SHeeta and San (from Princess Mononoke).

  Some may argue that Nausicaa is a little too perfect, however, I find her perfectly relatable, unlike the sterotypical characters of modern films. THough I am not exactly into animals, I found her care for the forests and their inhabitants touching as well as her pleas to end the violence. In todays world and society I find this a highly encouraging message and this is certainly an excellent film for even some younger viewers (six or seven and older).

  If you enjoy this film, please be sure to look into this artist's other works such as PRincess MOnonoke, SPirited Away, Howl's moving castle, and my favorite, Castle in the Sky!",1137196800,,1630,4.8545454545454545
1139320,5,7884063387,"I first saw this anime when I was a pre-teen.  It was the first Japanese anime I ever saw.  I was absolutely captivated.  Now at age 27, I am still as captivated by it as the first time I saw it.  The first version I saw was the abridged English dubbed version.  I also had possession of the Japanese version but without subtitles.  Both were bootlegs and I watched them both several times (despite my inability to understand Japanese).  Before the Disney release hit the stores, a friend of mine found a boot leg copy of the Japanese version with English subtitles.  The subtitles were sloppy and inaccurate.  There was some dialogue that was never even translated.  However, with the understanding provided by the additional scenes in combination with a more accurate portrayal of dialogue than the English dub version, Nausicaa took on a whole new and deeper level of meaning and plot.

I recently watched part of the Disney release with the modern dubbing.  I did not particularly care for the voice talent and acting.  Worse was the translations chosen for some of the dialogues.  Nausicaa, the main character, IS the ideal woman.  She is brave, strong, hopefull, compassionate, loving, gentle, intelligent, humble, and very human (she, despite being wonderful, has weaknesses just like everyone else).  I felt that the modern Disney English dialogue played down several of these strong virtues in Nausicaa's possession.  Being that her character is the central attraction of the movie, down playing these virtues is detrimental to the emotional impact of the movie.

Tonight, I just watched Nausicca on Turner Classic Movies (TCM).  They showed the film in the original Japanese dialogue with English subtitles.  This was not the same version as the boot leg that I already own.  The version the TCM showed was by far the best rendition that I have ever seen of Nausicaa.  Her inteligence shines in the dialogue, more so than any other version and her sweetness and humility are just a strong as the older English dubbed version.  I am not sure which edition TCM showed (perhaps it is the Disney release but with the viewing options of Japanese with English subs instead of English dubs?), but it was by far the most excellent rendition of the dialogue.

If you want the full impact of this wonderful story, the version shown on TCM is what you want to get.  Be sure to sacrifice English dialogue and read the English subtitles.  It is well worth it.

In the scope of all movies, animated or not, this is the movie that holds top place in my heart.  If you want a story synopsis, read some of the other excellently written reviews.  As for me, I will tell you that it is a wonderful and inspiring story.  Definitely a breath of fresh air in a world that is often gloomy and cynical.

1139322,5,7884063387,"Today's computerized animation cannot begin to hold a candle to the gorgeous hand-drawn animation of days past (well, almost past). That may change someday, but until it does some of the most beautiful animation currently created comes out of Japan's Studio Ghibli. And the team that created Ghibli started out with this movie. ""Nausica&auml;, of the Valley of the Wind"", released in 1984, explores themes and characters that appear throughout Studio Ghibli's films (particularly those of Hayao Miyazaki). Including powerful lead female roles, nature versus technology, domination through technology, the diminishing returns that can occur when humans try to control nature through their creations, and redemptive villians. Thus, it provides an appropriate starting point for the now world famous studio.

The story revolves around Nausica&auml; herself, the last surving daughter of King Jil of the valley. The Fukai, a poisonous forest threatens this valley (and slowly ossifies the bones of its residents), and giant insects of many forms roam the earth. Humans no longer possess the top spot on the food chain. Of course some humans miss thier dominant place, and attempt to destroy the Fukai. A Tolmekian ship, carrying dangerous and mysterious cargo, crashes near the valley. This prompts an invasion of the valley by the Tolmekians. Their leader, Princess Kushana (whose husband ""will see much worse""), reveals that the Tolmekians will attempt to destroy the Fukai with an ancient soldier-God and give the earth back to humanity. One big thing (or more accurately, many big things) stand in the way: the enormous insects called Ohmus. They have thwarted all attempts to take over the Fukai. But, as the Tolmekians point out, no humans before them possessed an ancient soldier-God. The people of the valley do not agree with the methods of the Tolmekians (they think humans should try to live in peace with the insects), and so Nausica&auml; is taken hostage as insurance. The film climaxes with a huge battle scene in which Princess Kushana uses the reconstructed soldier-God against the furiously stampeding Ohmus.

The DVD also includes a great documentary on the beginnings of Studio Ghibli. It tells the story of just how difficult it was to get a Japanese studio to produce Nausica&auml;. Miyazaki and others tried to make this movie without an accompanying Manga (unprecedented for the time; most movies then typically went from Manga to film). The solution was obvious: they made Nausica&auml; into a highly successful Manga and then the studios agreed. After the subsequent film also became a huge hit the people involved decided to form their own studio. So Studio Ghibli was born. But the documentary doesn't stop there, it goes on to summarize all of Ghibli's films up to ""The Cat Returns"" (and, according to this documentary, ""Castle in the Sky"" was actually the first ""offical"" Ghibli release). All Ghibli fans should see this piece.

Anyone who has enjoyed ""Princess Mononoke"" or ""Spirited Away"" should also check out ""Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Winds"". It presents a great story with incredible animation. The amount of work that goes into these films must be staggering. But the effort pays off, as the detailed animation and backgrounds never lose their magnificence even after multiple viewings. And as the years went on Ghibli just kept releasing amazing films. Hopefully they'll keep on going.",1135987200,5,3428,5.217785843920145
1139483,1,7884063387,"OK, I know a lot of self loathing environmentalist love this film. Humans are evil, humans are bad and untrustworthy, animals are inherently good and superior to human beings and therefore animals should have dominion over our precious god, mother earth. That's the theme of this film. Watching this film makes you want to die, literally. After all, the earth would be so much better off if we humans weren't around mucking it up.

I am quite sure that the self loathing creator and the self loathing lovers of this film had no issue with using the DVD player to view this film, which by the way is powered by electricity which was made possible by burning eeeeevil fossil fuels. I wonder if the creator ever rode in an earth polluting automobile or airplane and yet has no problem telling us how eeeeevil and stupid we human beings are?

1139484,5,7884063387,"This classic anime by Hayao Miyazaki pits a spunky, loving princess against those who misunderstand the precarious balance of nature in their diseased environment.  Like most Miyazaki heroines, Princess Nausicaa is an independent girl, full of wisdom despite her young age, and one who approaches life with both awe and determination.  When well-meaning but ignorant invaders from another land threaten to destroy the Valley of the Wind, Nausicaa must rely on her special understanding of nature to save them all.

Some of the themes and undertones of later Miyazaki works can be seen in this earlier film. In particular, the environmental interdependence of man and his environment that later defines ""Princess Mononoke"" begins in ""Nausicaa.""  The ""ohmu,"" giant armored bugs who attack when one of their own is injured, have the mysterious inner lives that many of the fantastical spirits/gods possess in ""Spirited Away.""  His fascination with wind and flight , lush and complex scenery, and the dynamic ""acting"" of his characters mark ""Nausicaa"" as an archetypal Miyazaki work.

Although I watched this anime in the original language with subtitles, Disney has assembled a remarkable cast of voices:  Uma Thurman, Chris Sarandon, Patrick Stewart, Edward James Olmos, Alison Lohman, and Mark Hamill.  (The extras in the DVD contain interviews with these English-speaking actors about their dubbing experiences.)  I watched bits with these voices, and they are actually quite good in that they capture the emotional force and rhythms (to a degree) of the original.  For those who get too distracted by reading subtitles , the high-quality dubbing should be appreciated.  Still, I am a purist, much preferring the original language.

Because of its larger issues, Miyazaki's animation appeals to adults perhaps more than to children.  His intense battles and ominous creatures will probably frighten younger kids, hence the PG rating.  Highly recommended.",1133654400,49,1954,5.427152317880795
1139485,4,7884063387,"If you do, then watch this movie!

When I was younger, I got the entire set of Nausicaa books from the library, and read them straight through. Looking back, they are one of the few manga I actually read through, and thats some five hundred pages of comic. Ever since, I've died to see this movie, and it didn't disappoint. It's a lot tamer than the comic version, which was not written with young children in mind, but it certainly has the enviromental and heritage themes intact. In fact, Miyazaki wrote this comic because they said his movie would fail unless he had a comic to base it on. So, he wrote it and it became the most popular comic to ever run in Animage magazine. To this day, one of the most beloved and recognized comics (besides akira toriyama's stuff) in Japan.

 As an action animation, it still portrays its message, and has enough plot that you won't have to read 500 pages of comic to understand whats happening.

-Being Miyazaki's first film, it has many of the nuances and plot devices of his later works. (First if you don't count the Lupin the Third work)- We start off with a young girl who lives in the Valley of Wind, and knows everything about the wind. She can control a small glider with jets through the air, and rides currents all over. But, everything is not just fun and games. A thousand years before, the people of the planet had great technology, and used it for everything, polluting the air/water/ground (think near future). But, they became power hungry and went to war, creating large 'God Beasts' that fought and brought on the Seven Days of Fire (Miyazaki's analogy for nuclear war). After the seven days, everything was destroyed, and out of the ashes a toxic forest arose, full of vile bugs that destroy everything living in their path. Nausicaa is special, and feels she can communicate with the bugs, especially the Ohmu, a giant caterpillar that is generally kind and gentle, but when provoked becomes a raging beast. The valley is on the fringe of the toxic forest, and her people have come to coexist near the forest, even as it poisons them. The king, Nausicaa's father, has succumb to the sickness. Soon, Torumekian soldiers come to their valley, hiding a secret from a warring state called Pejite. With this secret, comes bugs and poison seeping into the valley...

This story is so in depth, yet it's about a fourth of the books. I suggest to anyone who likes this movie, or wants something to write about in an enviromental studies class, get them. All four Perfect editions. As for the movie, the same great art is preserved well in the dvd transfer. Obviously, for an '84 animation this one could be pretty bad, but disney gave a little retouch it would seem, or Studio Ghibli (miyazaki's design house) was just this good. Colors are vibrant, lines are sharp, little fuzz. The sound is crisp, in both languages, and the music is a sweeping score (great in surround sound).

The reason this disc gets a star taken away, is special features. Disney did this and two others at the same time, (The Cat Returns, Porco Rosso, and Nausicaa) and they mostly have similar features.

On the movie disc is a featurette called Behind the Microphone, featuring the english voise talent from the film discussing their experience and being all excited. This is nice, considering the all-star talent (Mark Hamill, Patrick Stewart, Shia Lebouf, Alison Lohman, Edward James Olmos, and Uma Thurman [almost another star taken away for her]). Next is a great featurette called ""Birth of Studio Ghibli"", told from producer Isao Takahata's perspective. This guy has been Miyazaki's main man since the beginning, and influential in Ghibli's success. Four japanese trailers, one english, and other Ghibli movie trailers are nicely implemented. The second disc is, again (same as all new two disc disney editions), entirely storyboards set to the audio tracks. Interesting for up-and-coming artists, enthusiasts, and comic fans. Otherwise, you'll probably pop it in for a few minutes, then turn it off. This is where the extra star went. I was expecting something special from this new version, and on two discs, I'm sure there were more features they could have translated...

Overall, one of the great Miyazaki films. I'll be showing it to my kids for sure.",1129248000,10,4293,4.7840755735492575

1139488,5,7884063387,"I first saw this movie as a kid.  My sister's boyfriend, who eventually worked for a game magazine reviewing imports and anime, had it at a time when anime and 'Japanimation' (I don't like that word, just use anime!) were relitively unknown, obscure, and badly copied from copies of copies.

Part of my misses that era of anime, when a new episode of Ranma 1/2 or the Project A-Ko movie was fan-subbed and somewhat blurry to watch.  Tenticle porn was everywhere and hard to advoid.  Certain people knew certain series, and trading tapes was a form of currancy.  This movie makes me feel nostalgia for such an era, but also instills in me a deal of awe.

This movie has held up, unlike the other anime I used to watch.  Ranma became the same story over and over, Bubblegum Crisis a cliche piece, A-Ko a nice little parody that I never watched again and so forth.  Only Nausica' and a little less then a handful of others really stand out.

Nausica' beats out almost any animation on the shelf today, and simply shines.  And that's not just the nostalgia talking, either.  It's intelligent, action packed, and if God could dub, he would dub this.",1125964800,2,1144,4.5588235294117645

To tell you the truth, ""great"" is just not good enough for it. In fact I looked it up in a thesaurus. ""Excellent, Splendid, Swell, Grand, Top-notch, Favorable, Noble, Superior, Fit for a King"" all this and more.  I bet I could watch this over and over without getting bored.

In this movie Hayao Miyazaki included it all, action and drama, magic and war, peace and understanding. ""He surely got it all and stuffed it in one darn wonderful story"", as one of my best friends would say.

 For all you people who haven't seen it, I'll try not to spoil it for you.  In this movie ""A courageous princess leads her people in the struggle against a powerful insect race determined to take over their land."" -the back of the Blockbuster case. At the beginning of the film this line is said by Patrick Stewart-""A thousand years have passed since the collapse of industrialized civilization, a toxic jungle now spreads threatening the last of the human race."" (So many big words) In my words, ""Princess Nausica must defend her people from giant bugs trying to destroy everything.""-Me, Katy It's just easier that way, you see.

 If you are like me and like action and drama, war, guns and tanks and all that stuff you should see this movie.  The first time I saw it (I was 11) I even cried!  If you like Howls Moving Castle, you will love Nausica.

 If you are also like magic and peace, love and all that mushy crap, you should see this movie. (Even if you have to close your eyes and plug you ears during the tragic parts) (That was not me closing and plugging, it was my seven-year-old sister)

The film is a lovely summation of his pet themes. Environmentalism, brave girls with noble souls and conflict with few clear ""bad guys"" (every group in a miyazaki film will show some shred of nobility).

The visuals are perfectly stunning and the best suprises are always a concert of elements, plot + character + visual.

I in no way mean to diminsh the film when i say that it obviously represents an early stage product from Miyazki.

This storyline inparticular would be vastly improved upon, without being repeated, a decade later with Prncess Mononoke. A true refinement of a masterpiece cannot diminish the masterpiece.

Naussica stands apart from the rest of Ghibli as a perfect distillation of what the studio in general and Miyazaki in particular are capable of.

1139682,5,7884063387,"I had only seen one other movie of Hayao Miyazaki, ""Spirited Away"". I fell in love with that movie, so my friend recommended me to watch ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"". After watching Nausicaa, I am glad to say that my admiration for Hayao Miyazaki's movies has only become stronger.

The story is about Nausicaa, the princess of the Valley of the Wind. The human civilization is near extinction, because there is a toxic plague spreading in the air, killing everyone. These poisonous fumes come from the spores, which are protected by giant insects called ""Ohms"". The villagers of the Valley of the Wind are safe since the air of their land is protected from this poison. Nausicaa, the fun, loyal and courageous princess of the Valley of the Wind, feels that everything can be solved without resolving to violence, and tries to find a cure to this poison. However, as their land is invaded from Tolmekians, who feel that they have another solution to saving the human race, even if it resorts to bloodshed, it is up to Nausicaa to save the people, even if it means putting her own life on hand.

While this movie starts off with a simple storyline (a girl trying to find a cure for the fumes of the sea of decay), it slowly introduces more characters along with more plot lines, making it an adventurous rollercoaster ride for the viewer. We get to see how people turn against one another during hardship, how things are not always what they seem, along with a girl who shows courage, bravery, trying to spread peace and love by ending a war, convincing people, while risking her own life in the process. It is clear to see that Miyazaki's imagination is flowing throughout this movie. We get to see new gadgets, a new world, with strange looking creatures, as well as a steady storyline to keep us focused.

I am surprised at the wonderful quality of this DVD. When I saw this movie, I had no idea it was a 1984 movie until I came online to write this review. There is an audio track to listen to the movie in Japanese as well as in English. Along with this, we also get to see original trailers, and two featurettes of the movie: Behind the scenes of the English voice recording, where they interviewed the cast of the English version of the movie (such as Patrick Stewart and Uma Thurman), as well as a ""Birth of Studio Ghibli"" featurette, where, being a newbie to Miyazaki's movies, I learnt a lot about Miyazaki's works in a chronological fashion.

This is a wonderful movie that a person of any age will enjoy watching. Therefore, I recommend you to get the movie and watch it, because you will not be disappointed.",1121472000,5,2628,4.549682875264271
1139843,5,7884063387,"One of the earliest stunners from masterpiece-maker Studio Ghibli, ""Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind"" takes place centuries in the future in a world covered by a globe-spanning super jungle that grows thousands of feet into the sky.  Various human settlements still exist here and there where the jungle hasn't choked them out, and gigantic, dangerous insects called the Ohmu are among the strange and fascinating creatures inhabiting this altered new world.

With the human settlements linked together in co-operation by only a tenuous peace and with the toxic jungle continuing its envelopment of everything in its path (kind of like the human jungle is doing to the natural world today come to think of it; this movie is full of allegory and metaphor, both envirornmental and otherwise) the fragile semi-balance is upset by the discovery by one of the other settlements of an ancient, incredibly powerful weapon from the distant past and the war that basically destroyed the previous world and ushered in this one, and has the potential to dominate or destroy again.  Naturally, humanity being what it is, gaining control of this new discovery becomes top priority for one of the less amicable and more powerful of the small civilizations.

As with all Ghibli material - gorgeous animation and seemingly unlimited imagination intertwine in bringing this world to life; this is one of the first Ghibli films, predating ""Castle In The Sky"", ""Spirited Away"", et al. so the techical aspects of the animation are not quite as advanced as later efforts but were still a quantum leap at the time and remain impeccably gorgeous today; basically the only big difference is there's not nearly so much movement in the backgrounds as in later Ghiblis, which reached the pinnacle of full animation.  A minor point; when it still looks this good and is this effective it's not even a flaw.  The color combinations used in creating the various fungus lifeforms that make up so much of the jungle, including almost all of the undersections where sunlight wouldn't reach (one of the ways in which even the most fantastic of Ghibli worlds maintain a strong believability and realism), and the quick darting motions of the enchanting small animals are just magnificent.

Filled with enough memorable, fully realized characters and enough concept to easily pack an 800-page fantasy novel, and with surprises both beautiful and terrible, ""Nausicca"" is most similar to ""Princess Mononoke"" and to a lesser extent ""Castle In The Sky"".  Includes a heart-stopping final fifteen minutes or so; this is a movie for Every movie lover, but big people, you should sit in with your wee ones on this; it's more intense and frightful than western animation (not that there's anything wrong with Disney and their peers!).  Even after the final credits start to roll you'll want to keep watching even if you're not one of the viewers who, like myself, insists on sitting through to the very end every time anyway - not to give anything away, but more short scenes pop up.

1139844,4,7884063387,"The box on the DVD says that this is Miyazaki's masterpiece. While this movie was a huge influence on my life with movies, I don't really think that this movie would be the crowning jewel on his celebrated career.

I have seen the movie ""Warriors of the Wind"" which was the first release of Nausicaa in North America. It was so cut up according to Miyazaki that he refused to put his name on it and refused to release more movies unless he had total control. In the 1990's he then relented, releasing Totoro through Fox Pictures and then made his deal with Disney to re-release his other movies either through a theatrical release or video. Nausicaa, his second feature, comes direct to video.

The movie takes place a thousand years after the seven days of fire that destroyed the modern world. The land was scorched and eventually replaced with a toxic jungle poisonous to mankind. The creatures of the seven days of fire represent the nuclear capabilities of man and the toxic jungle represents the response of the nature to protect them from Man. There are some disparate kingdoms and one of them is the Valley of the Wind. They are blessed with the wind from the sea, which keeps the deadly spores of the jungle away and the people have developed a symbiotic relationship (some would even say a love of) the jungle. The daughter of the king, Nausicaa is one of those people. She often travels into the jungle, trying to find a way to live in harmony with the jungle, while others find ways to destroy it. One day, she meets Lord Yupa, a traveling warrior/philosopher unlike Gandalf in the LoTR, who is a friend of the King, who has taken ill. Right after his arrival, an airship from the Kingdom of Tolmekia, a war like nation who conquers others in the name of unity and protecting them under their umbrella for the good of humankind (ahem, that sounds familiar). They are on their home from a recent conquest of the Kingdom of Pejite (which is represented as a vaguely Arabic nation) after finding out that the Pejite recently discovered a demon responsible for the seven days of fire. The ship, of course and infested with creatures of the jungle, crash lands and they discover the demon (in a hibernating state). Soon, the Tolmekians take over the Valley with their vast military army, kill the Valley's King and plan to take Nausicaa back to Tolmekia.

On the way back, the Pejite launch a counterattack, led by their Prince Asbel. Asbel and Nausicaa go back to Pejite, and discover the Pejite military have launched counterattack which involves destroying the occupying Tolmelkian army in the Valley of the Wind. The death of the valley would be collateral damage.

While this seems like a plot driven movie, there are two underlying themes throughout the movie. The first is the pettiness between nations to conquer others in the guise of protecting the weak against an evil foe (the toxic jungle) and the evils of this power against a fragile world that will defend itself from man's intervention. It is this geo-political-environmental theme that plays out in say Princess Mononoke (the natural world vs. man). I believe that Miyazake portrays this more subtlety than he does with Mononoke, where they have animal gods roaming throughout. The animation has become a touch outdated as the years have gone by, Miyazake has been outdone in person animate by anime auteurs such as Otomo and Oshi but in terms of creative design on an epic scale, I will say that no one comes close. I think the design of the Ohmu and the Ushiabu creatures were simply amazing at the time.

Miyazake also fleshes out his celluloid characters and gives Nausicaa lots of character that is missing nowadays in an era of Diva's who would rather portray themselves than dive into a character. Nausicaa is a contradiction, being a pacifist and a warrior, a mature adult and child, girly yet strongly feminist, etc. She is voiced extremely well by Alison Lohman, who seems accurate in her voicing. Lord Yupa's voice was an inspired choice. Patrick Stewart has a deep, masterful and wise voice and it bodes well for the well worn traveller. Other actors like Uma Thurman, Chris Sarandon, and Edward James Olmos do a great job as well. The only voice I didn't like too much was Prince Asbel, voice monotonously by Shia LeBeouf (where was the beef in that performance Shia?)

The movie is a little too violent for children and the Disney version is very clean with a good (but not great) sound transfer. It is a two disc, but the second disc is for Nausicaa nutz only because the only feature is the full length storyboard.

Compared to Miyazaki's work, it ranks in the lower middle of his works. It was better than Lupin III and Porco Rosso and I liked it the same as My Neighbour Totoro and Princess Mononoke on story, but I feel it was inferior to Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, and Castle in the Sky. Still, even though it is not his best, it is better than any other direct to video animated movie this year.....Rating B+",1120694400,2,5017,4.68140589569161
1139845,5,7884063387,"This was the film which introduced me (and many others in the 1980s) to Miyazake, and even in the form of a poor quality VHS on an ordinary TV, it was amazing. By 1984 Miyazake was already well known in Japan for his anime work in film, TV, and for the comic strip that this film was based upon.

In this early full length film he really got to spread his wings. There are fantastic aerial sequences like the jet-glider evading the flying snakes, which (this predates computed 3D, and aerial sequences are present in most of his work) are just a tour-de-force of imagination and geometry. And yet this is a world that feels very organic, not geometric, with a cast of characters drawn in a unique cross between hobo, samurai, and pirate - totally blending in to an imaginary post apocalyptic world where humans scratch out a precarious life in villages hidden in the few green valleys left in a world of desert, where the only remaining resources are wind, sunlight, and humans.

But it is also a world of enormous dangers, including airborne bandits and the strange, mutated creatures that have evolved to control the barren and scarred earth. When our heroine's valley home is attacked by raiders, she embarks on an adventure against them that will lead her, and some unlikely allies found along the way, to an eventual confrontation combining warring armies of bandits, ancient machines of infernal destruction, and the implacable, mysterious, threatening beasts which roam the badlands. The pace is swashbuckling - if this were a book, it would be one you could not stop reading.

It has the feel of the original comic books, but plays out wonderfully on the screen - you don't need to know the comics. The style is very unique. Even though it is very stylized (no photorealism here), you immediately get the feeling of the world and the characters. The story works for children of all ages (mine both first saw this before they were 6, and have memorized it long since), and combined with the wonderful visuals it is a treat for adults too. As a genre I would classify it as soft (no attempt at scientific correctness) sci-fi rather than fantasy, though some might think it more a work of fantasy. It is fascinating partly because its roots in style and action are unexpected for a western viewer. Japanese manga and stories had evolved in their own way, and although this is early Miyazake, it is already a product of that mature and distinct art form.

As always with Miyazake - if you haven't seen his work, well you haven't seen anything like it, and it is time you did.",1119571200,,2579,4.661538461538462

There is one person trying keep the peace between different parties that want to kill everything and each other.  The film comes to its climatic point at the very end and good overcomes evil (in a general sense).

Still not better than Princess Mononoke, but definitely a flick worth picking up.",1118793600,2,369,4.630769230769231
1139847,5,7884063387,"Wow! I've finally got to see the uncut version of Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind, the very first masterpiece by the great Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli! Sore wa Sugoi Desu Yo! (Japanese: It's so awesome and amazing!) Alison Lohman and the rest of the English cast have really done their homework to portray their roles respectively. I especially love Ms. Lohman as Princess Nausicaa and Patrick Stewart as Lord Yupa, because they both have regal bearings too! Wow! They're as good as it gets!

Everything is so awesome; the soundtrack, the voicework, the story, the action scenes, the art work, and everything else is so perfect, and well done too. Everything has been refined to the state-of-the-art level, which is what Studio Ghibli has been famous for. What's more, the message for peace, perseverance and prosperity, along with harmony and enviornmental protection and balance, have really touched deeply in my heart right from the start.

Overall, I'd like to say ""Doomo Arigato Gozaimasu"" to the great Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli for their great masterpiece, and shall give them 5 out of 5 stars for outstanding performance! Sayonara!",1118707200,2,1153,5.031413612565445

Going back through the Miyazaki catalogue after Spirited Away, Mononoke, and Lupin I hit Nausicaa first.  Like the prior mentioned two, this is another 5 star effort with nature and personal growth at its heart.  A young girl, a princess, attempts to save her peaceful agri-centered valley from twin dangers.  The industrial complex of a warring nation and the monstrous slug like insects that are treated as apocalyptic harbingers.  As usual, a young beau is thrown into the mix and they must rely on their wits and inner courage to save the day.  Sweeping once again with glider rides and war machines of the air, Nausicaa doesn't disappoint.  Highly recommended.",1118620800,3,729,4.878048780487805
1139849,5,7884063387,"Even though Nausicaa is the first full-length film made by Miyazaki, it is the last one I watched.  In fact I have watched Howl's Moving Castle before watching Nausicaa.  If Howl is the most beautiful hero Miyazaki created, then Nausicaa is the most beautiful heroine.

Miyazaki's later adventurous film usually start with a bang and the story reach a climax after a few minutes into the film e.g. Spirited away and Howl's moving castle. With Nausicaa the story moves more slowly in the beginning to pave way for the climax toward at the end of the film.  I highly recommend you to watch Nausicaa because it is one of Miyazaki's best work.",1115942400,3,639,4.678571428571429
1139850,5,7884063387,"I was a little hesitant to buy this version of ""Nausicaa"".  This is my absolutely favorite Miyazaki film.  It was the first movie of his that I ever saw, and made me an absolute fanatic for his work.  I have two fan bootlegs and an (*ahem) import Chinese version of this movie.  I even imported the soundtrack from Japan over 15 years ago.

There were two reasons I was hesitant to buy this.  First, infamously, when ""Naussicaa"" was first released in the U.S. as ""Warriors of the Wind"", it was ridiculously edited, missing large portions of the movie.  That release was so awful that Miyazaki did not release another movie in the U.S. market until the early 90's video release of ""My Neighbor Totoro"".  Second, with the bare bones release of Disney titles, I didn't know what else this movie would have to offer over the other versions that I have.

I am so glad that I bought this!  First off, the voice overs are very impressive.  Uma Thurman, Patrick Stewart, Edward James Olmos, and Mark Hamill all do a wonderful job, and match the characters very well.  Standing out in the cast, though, is Alison Lohman.  She matches the inflection and emotion of the Japanese voice artist very well.  I am an avid subtitle fanatic, but with this impressive cast, it was no problem watching the movie in English.  As a bonus, there is a Japanese soundtrack for purists, with subtitles having a more exact translation.  Did I mention that the video transfer is beautiful?  It is.

For a bonus feature, there is a featurette on the history of Studio Ghibli, starting from its inception, up to the release of ""Monoke Hime"".  As an avid Miyazaki fan, this alone was worth the price of the disc.  Seriously!  I haven't even watched the second disc of bonus material, but any anime fan will want that featurette.

For those who have stumbled across this film because they have seen ""Spirited Away"", or they see the Disney name, I think you will be happily surprised by ""Nausicaa"".  I don't have kids, but there are some sophisticated themes in this movie, as well as a demon and some violence; so I think you'd probably be safe showing this to a 10 or 11 year old.  As with most Miyazaki films, the main character of the film in an incredibly strong an complex girl, which I think is a wonderful thing for the younger generations to see in a movie.

For those who have never seen the movie, Naussica takes place far in the future after the world has been virtually destroyed by environmental damage as a byproduct of war and industry.  Poisonous forests and giant insects have taken over much of the world; yet, some kingdoms and small villages still survive, managing to stave off the advances of the forest.  The Valley of the Wind is a small kingdom that has managed to survive by trying to find a balance with the forest around it.  (These are themes that Miyazaki will visit again in ""Princess Monoke"".)  The embodiment of this attitude of balance and respect for nature is held in the young princess of Valley, Nausicaa.  Soon, outsiders come crashing into the little village and disrupt the life in the Valley, and Nasicaa is forced to grow and deal with situations beyond her control.

This is a simply wonderful, and magical film.  18 years ago I was a fan of loud, violent, nasty, and grotesque anime.  Then, when I saw ""Nausicaa"" at an anime convention, it opened me to an entire new world of film.  Miyazaki is the master of making movies that people of all ages can enjoy.  In my opinion, he does this better than Disney.  He never dumbs-down or panders his films for the younger audience.  He creates young characters who are strong, and yet still show the weakness, indecisiveness, and playfulness of youth.  His young characters are never sappy or, even worse, precocious.  This is a film for everyone, whether you love anime, animation, or film.",1114992000,5,3847,4.626292466765141

1140052,5,7884063387,"In the early nineties, one of my pre-school daughter's favorite videos was something entitled WARRIORS OF THE WIND.  As an adult, I found much in it to be of interest, and much of the animation to be of an exceedingly high quality, but overall the film lacked balance and a cohesive structure to make it a truly great animated film. Later I learned that the animator/writer/director Hiyao Miyazaki had been horrified with the way his Japanese original had been transferred into English and that many of the ecological concerns of the film had been muted by aggressive editing on the part of the American distributors.  During the past two decades the English-language revision of NAUSICAA AND THE VALLEY OF THE WIND, the film which through reediting became WARRIORS OF THE WIND has generated as much anger as any film ever made.  Now, however, arguably the greatest injustice in the history of animation has been redressed with a marvelous new edition of what is easily one of Miyazaki's greatest achievements.

There is a lot of debate about where NAUSICAA AND THE VALLEY OF THE WIND stands among all of Miyazaki's films  Even while there has been a growing consensus that Miyazaki is the greatest maker of feature length animated film ever, there is controversy as to whether this film is or is not his greatest film.  I'll confess my bias that it is his finest film, though I certainly can understand why someone would defend the assertion that THE PRINCESS MONONOKE or SPIRITED AWAY deserves that designation.  Both of those films are a bit more polished and even more lavishly and elaborately drawn.  My own reasons for preferring NAUSICAA are several.  First, I personally believe that NAUSICAA is the first truly great Miyazaki film.  Although he had done many superb films before this one, it was at this point that his art reached an apex that he has matched on other occasions, but never unquestionably surpassed.  Second, I loved the story, both the scope of Miyazaki's vision, the cohesiveness of his narrative, and the richness of the moral message underlying the film.  Finally, the animation of the film just blew me away even in the bowdlerized version of the film, and does so even more in this fully restored version.  Miyazaki pioneered in animation the framing of images in cinematic fashion.  For instance, Miyazaki manipulates in scenes in which Nausicaa flies her glider beside a larger ship to be from the same point of view a camera would be if it were a live action scene.  His perspective is always driven by an imaginary camera, unlike, say, the Disney films, in none of whose films from the forties to the eighties can be found a similar manipulation of perspective.  Several Disney films from the late eighties to the present display such perspective at times, but I would suggest that it is not an accident that these were made after Miyazaki had perfected the technique in a number of films.  Perhaps Miyazaki has made minor improvements in his films since NAUSICAA, but none represent the quantum leap forward that this one did.

One reason my daughter watched and rewatched WARRIORS OF THE WIND, until she literally wore out the video, was the lead character.  If my memory serves me correctly, they changed the central character's name from Nausicaa to some far blander name, a change that is emblematic for the production as a whole.  But even in that version, Nausicaa stood out as not merely one of the most compelling heroines in animated film, but in all films.  In fact, even today Nausicaa compares favorably with such characters as Ripley from the ALIEN films and Buffy Summers as a compelling heroine.  She is at moments subject to the kind of preciousness that mars many moments in anime in particular and Asian film in general (think of key moments in films when Jackie Chan ceases his chase of the villains to save a baby in danger, or the way in this one where Nausicaa cuddles with the half cat/half fox creature that attaches itself to her), but all in all, she is utterly courageous, amazingly inventive, unstintingly moral and compassionate, fiercely uncompromising in her principles, and unfailingly resourceful.  In scene after scene after scene, Miyazaki invents new and strangely believable ways for his diminutive heroine to resolve seemingly impossible crises.  By the end of the film, one has as much confidence in Nausicaa to save the day as Superman or Batman or Indiana Jones.  As the father of a girl I can't express how important it was to her when she was young to have such a female heroine to enjoy.  Male or female, heroic characters do not come any better than Nausicaa.

No review of this film would be complete without adding some praise for the score.  Although I had a tad bit of trouble with the childlike voice that intentionally intones lyrics slightly off key (Sarah Vaughan would famously sing out of tune when she would sing the Ira Gershwin line ""The way you sing off key,"" but she even sang off key musically in a way that enhanced the song as a whole) to produce a decidedly irritating effect, the score as a whole is amazingly effective.

The wonderful thing about the entire series of new issues of the entire Miyazaki catalog is that they consistently provide both the original which can be watched with subtitles and an extremely high quality dubbed version.  In live action films I am an unstinting purist.  I simply won't watch a dubbed version of a film with live actors, since one gains so much from hearing the actual voices of the actors.  I always get a kick on the X-FILES DVDs listening to the various foreign language dubbings and chuckling at the gap between, say, the voice of Gillian Anderson as Scully and the voice of the low-voiced actress dubbing her into German.  But with animation it is a different matter.  For one thing, the animated characters do not possess actual voices, but have only what any actor gives them.  Additionally, animation is even more than live action films driven by the images on the screen.  I find I always enjoy the visual aspect of the film more by not having to focus both on what is on the screen and on subtitles.  Luckily, one can with this DVD set do both, watch it first in the dubbed version and then in the subtitled, or vice versa.  I very much enjoyed the actors used to dub the English version.  There were some obligatory big names-Patrick Stewart, who is outstanding as Lord Yupa, Alison Lohman (who voiced Nausicaa), Uma Thurman, Edward James Olmos-but most of the people were highly appropriate for the character they were dubbing.

My only complaint with the DVDs is the way that Disney programs the DVDs to try to steer you to an endless series of Disney commercials when the discs are first inserted.  Such spamming is just not appropriate to DVDs and especially not to an otherwise high quality version of a Miyazaki classic.  Still, I applaud Disney for taking the effort to make almost Miyazaki's entire incredibly impressive corpus available.  Only a few years ago, before the release of PRINCESS MONONOKE, Miyazaki was still unknown to most American filmgoers.  He still doesn't enjoy the reputation that he deserves, but the release of his films on DVD is treated as event even by Wal-Mart and Target.  He truly is without his peer in the world of feature length film animation, for not only does he do an amazing percentage of the animation himself, he also writes the stories, and acts as both producer and director.  No other great animator has involved himself in his films at such great length and in such detail.",1113350400,14,7575,4.77897160399079
1140053,5,7884063387,"One night when I was about 14, I was staying up late watching HBO as I often did, when a movie came on that captured my imagination, Warriors of the Wind.  At the time, I was not an animation fan outside of the cartoons like The Transformers I stopped watching at around 12, OK 13.

Anyway, at 2 a.m., sitting alone in a dark room, I was drawn into the mind of Master Miyazaki and his amazing vision.  I was completely amazed by the alternate world this story took place in and the characters involved.

After the movie was over I tried desperatly to find the name of the movie, since I had picked it up after about 15-minutes.  I found it in the HBO guide and proceeded to tell all my friends about the movie.  None of them had ever heard of it.

Up to just a few months ago I continued to mention it whenever the topic of animation came up.  I could never find a copy of the movie and few spoke to had heard of it.  The film always represented this phantom thing that I could share with no one or find out more about.  Until just a few months ago a co-worker, and real anima fan, told me how this movie was a bad redoing of an original creation by Master Miyazaki.  She told me the original name and mentioned it was supposed to be released in its original form.  When it came out, I rushed for my copy.

Needless to say at 31 I still find the concepts and images of the movie amazing and I can't wait to share it with my young daughter when she is old enough to watch.

Now the movie I always tried to find out more about has a name and sits in its proper place in my video collection.",1113264000,6,1588,4.048076923076923

1140055,5,7884063387,"I found this masterpiece like so many of us in the United States badly chopped up and limping from the ungainly cuts made to the original vision of Master Miyazaki.  That being said I carried the love of this piece with me for twenty years, always hearing from those who had seen the original Japanese version about how lacking it was when it was the Warriors of the Wind.  I did not care, this vision of the tenuous and hostile future was populated by the perfect heroine for a 12 year old girl who had never seen a truly strong and dedicated female role model in any anime until Nausicaa herself.

When Disney did the only honorable thing it could and released this polished original I bought it the first day it was available, I knew that I had to have it.  I was expecting to still love it the same as I did when I was a young girl, but now as a mother and a grown woman.  I find that love Nausicaa even more.  The scenes that had been brutally removed from Warriors in the Wind took my breath away.  The animation is timeless, no matter how advanced we become, it will always be beautiful.

The new voices for the characters work as well, James Patrick Stewart is unmistakable as Lord Yupa, the other cast members do a wonderful job of conferring emotion and the proper spirit of the film.  This is one that must be bought now, who knows how long Disney will allow it to be out so snap it up.  Enjoy and treasure this wonderful work for a long time to come.

A spectacular and unique animated fantasy Sci-fi epic from Hayao Miyazaki, one of the world's greatest animation directors has created his second best movie with ""Princess Mononoke"" being number one and ""Spirited Away"" being third.

1140059,4,7884063387,"As an avid hater of Anime cartoons and having a bias against the majority of films which fall into that category, I must say...Nausicca of the Valley of the Wind is definately an interesting flick.  Prior to viewing it, I had watched two other Miyazaki films: Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke, both of which had blown me away. When I saw his name on the cover of the dvd, I knew it couldn't be too terrible.  Luckily, it wasn't.

In Nausicaa, Miyazaki displays the same attention to detail that has always placed him a notch above other animators.  Even now, with all the leaps and bounds in animation that computers have made, they still struggle to equal the quality that is present in Miyazaki's work.  One can genuinely see the emotions on the characters' faces.  The many environments which are shown in the film also never fail to convince.

One thing I noticed was the similarity between the basic storylines and elements which made up Nausicaa and Princess Mononoke.  Were you to replace the toxic jungle of Nausicaa with the forest of Princess Mononoke, replace the giant insects which live in the jungle with the giant animals which live in the forest, replace the warring villages with the warring samurai, and move the time period back about 1400-1600 years, then you would have the overall shell of Princess Mononoke.  However, similarities are to be expected when the same author created both stories.  Yet that's not to say that the story is bad or that the movie is not worth watching.  Far from it.  Although the same level of depth isn't present in Nausicaa as it is in Princess Mononoke, Nausicaa remains an excellent film, never-the-less.  In fact, you'll probably be left wanting more after you finish the film.  If that is the case, then there is a series of Manga which go beyond the film, as the film covers less than half of the full story.

The full manga are available here.  [...]

And, while I despise anime, I must confess, I have been convinced to order all of them.",1111968000,2,2001,4.671428571428572
1140060,5,7884063387,"The film Nausica and the Valley of the Wind is the timeless tale of a pure, goodhearted person trying to do what's right during a time of uncertainty. With a post-apocalypse as the backdrop, quite popular during 1980s anime (see Akira) due to the Cold War, we are introduced to a world where human technology and power has destroyed our land. Sparse kingdoms are seperated by an ever-growing forest of deadly spore-emitting plants while the beasts which protect them swarm. Nausica lives in a peaceful valley by the sea until an airship crashes with two things of importance: a captured princess and the hibernating form of a destructive monster which ravaged the land 1000 years ago during a time called The Seven Days of Fire. Soon, an empire sends their troops to recover the monster, and Nausica is pressed into hesitant action to prevent the destruction of both her people and the actually gentle creatures of the forest.

While watching Nausica, I noticed many hints at characters Miyazaki creates later in his career. Our title heroine reminded my own mother of Kiki in Kiki's Delivery Service. I saw San (see Princess Mononoke) in her spirited defense of her people and the forest. Azabel, the young prince of a kingdom trying to prevent the monster from falling into the wrong hands, reminded me of Pazu from Castle in the Sky.

Although the movie itself is quite good, I found the music odd. Too electronica, influenced by the 80s. I would love for Joe Hisashi to orchestrate a new score to this terrific movie.

Overall, the movie is almost a giant sketch for forecoming works Miyazaki would create. While a fantastic film (especially with the strong pro-nature and anti-war theme), I feel many of Miyazaki's works later on are greater in their execution. That should not prevent one from watching this film, on the contrary, do so now. Just don't expect the movie to be the director's best.

I got this movie locally. And it was redubbed wonderfully. Never did I know Patrick Stewart (Picard on STTNG) Would turn out to be the perfect Lord Yupa, as apposed to the original voice.

I discovered at least 30 minutes had been cut from this movie in the dubbing of Warriors of the Wind. Which left more gaps than many would have realized.

Disney also went back to the original Japanese names. Which I loved. They kept the same score as you would hear from the older version. I loved the one line they kept from the old dubbing. ""That's Lord Yupa! Kill him and you'll be famous!"" ^_^

Nausicaa is one of Hayao Miyazaki's (creator of Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, etc.) earlier films. To be frank, it came out in 1984, I believe. However, don't make the mistake that because it's a little old, the animation isn't very good. It was gorgeous! It gave that indescribable feeling of it being REAL, unlike so many animated works today (including Japanese animation).

The characters are realistic and inspiring. The main character is Nausicaa, princess of the Valley of the Wind. She is a sweet sixteen-year-old girl who is not afraid to fight for the good of others. Being an older teen girl myself, I found myself almost cheering out loud for Nausicaa. She has become a sort of role model for me. Another good character is Asbel, prince of Pejite. He's a strong character; a good role model for the men watching.

Since there are so many other reviews, I won't go into detail about the plot, but PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE! It has a beautiful message woven into its lush world that will leave you really thinking. Also, Joe Hasaishi's soundtrack is absolutely beautiful.

The dub work was great, with Alison Lohman as Nausicaa, Shia LeBeouf as Asbel, Uma Thurman as Kushana, and some other famous names.

All in all, Nausicaa presents some very real messages and characters that make you want to watch it again and again.",1111104000,4,1537,4.656826568265683
1140223,5,7884063387,"First off, credit must be given to Walt Disney Studios for allowing us to finally get a chance to see this amazing work of animated art.  Also, I give a nod to Pixar here because many executives at Pixar encouraged Disney to pick up the rights to Miyazaki's films.  Thanks go to both of these great family oriented entertainment giants.

""Nausicaa"" is the first real effort of the animator called Hayao Miyazaki.  It is an amazing and detailed work of animated art that can be enjoyed by the whole family.  This film established all of the familiar themes of Miyazaki, which are :

1. Anti-War : Miyazaki dislikes violence and shows war as a destroyer of not only people, but also a destroyer of society and the planet itself.

2. Everyday Life : There is a constant theme of simply enjoying everyday life, the normal work, toil and rest of an ordinary day.

3.  Showing the feminine as an integral part of creation : the Miyazaki film always shows feminine figures as something other than shallow fashionistas and/or weak victims.  Usually, the main protagonist is a heroine who saves her society (and/or her friends) in some way.  However, there is usually a ""evil"" woman somewhere in the film who is a foil to the heroine (in Nausicaa it is the brutal woman who seeks to destroy nature to ensure Human survival).

Please give this film a rental and see what you think.  If you enjoy this, please consider Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke.  Thanks for taking the time to read this!",1111017600,4,1486,4.64367816091954
1140224,5,7884063387,"Not being an expert critique of this producers works like so many others, I originally purchased the VHS copy of this movie (""Warriors Of The Wind"") for my son when he was small and we watched it many times together and enjoyed it.  A short time ago I introduced this same video tape to his son, my grandson and was able to also enjoy it again thru his eyes.  I was unaware that it was being re-released on DVD under the name ""Nausicaa Of The Vally Of The Wind"" until I saw it for sale and then I was confused as to whether or not it was the original we had loved or a sequel to that story due to the re-naming.  For those apparent few, like ourselves, whom knew no better and still loved the story in it's original release form; this remake will be a miracle and a minefield.  It is extremely well done and I definitely recommend it's purchase - but the dialogue is drastically different from the original.  Not bad, definitely not worse; but VERY different from what we veterans of only the VHS release expect based on that original release.  The hardest thing for my grandson to accept is that it is the same film, and yet so very many things are now called something different and (especially) that the name of the princess/heroine is different - he is not happy with my explanations that Princess Zandra is now Princess Nausicaa.  In looking over the existing reviews for this release, I don't see that this small fact has been mentioned before.  So for anybody else out there that is wondering like I did; the video and audio are done extremely well - but the movie will be jarringly different simply because of all the additional video ""bits & pieces"" that have been restored and because the dialogue is so completely re-written.  You will love it - but it will take a bit of getting used to if you, like us, are expecting what you watched before to be unchanged.",1110758400,4,1870,4.412790697674419
1140225,5,7884063387,"Before I start my review, let me state that I did manage to see this film subtitled at an art museum in New York.  For me, it was a very interesting experience to discover Miyazaki in his youngest days.  While some may find the quality of this film to be a bit dated upon initial glance, it is important to remember that NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND was made back in 1984, so the animation, likewise, does not have as much polish as Miyazaki's later work displays. But this is not to say that NAUSICAA is unwatchable because of that. This is a deeply complex, imaginative tale set in a post-apocalyptic world that will remind many of PRINCESS MONONOKE, only the protagonist is a girl. Nausicaa is a compassionate princess who prefers to solve problems with peace, not vengeance. Her struggle to resolve a bitter conflict between two warring kingdoms and prevent them from reaching her home valley is not a good vs. evil tale. The characters are all flawed, believable people with their own agendas and redeeming qualities.

In a testament to Miyazaki's admiration of nature, the film offers a sub-plot involving a supposedly poisonous jungle. The product of a terrible global war, this thick, lush forest not only showcases Miyazaki's imagination (those insects sure are creepy-looking!) but also emphasizes the dangers of world pollution.

While NAUSICAA is an older movie from Miyazaki, it manages to hold surprisingly well--most classics have such staying power.

Its long journey to America is a story in and of itself. In 1985 (a year after the film broke records in Japan), NAUSICAA debuted in America--renamed WARRIORS OF THE WIND, drastically altered, and cut by a quarter of its two-hour running time, much to the outrage of Miyazaki and his colleagues. Since that time, Miyazaki declared that any adaptations of his films for American release must be done under the supervision of his company, Studio Ghibli.

As much as some folks love to hate Disney these days, one can credit them for taking the time to strike a deal with Miyazaki to distribute his films globally. While the Mouse House has made their share of marketing mistakes with his films, the dubs they've produced thus far--KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, PRINCESS MONONOKE, SPIRITED AWAY, and CASTLE IN THE SKY--all have maintained a quality of excellence and strong performances from a solid cast of well-known actors and actresses. This brand new English version of NAUSICAA is no exception.

As the title character, Alison Lohman provides commendable sincerity, compassion, and vulnerability, and is amply supported by a grand cast of side characters, which include Uma Thurman (the embittered empress Kushana); Chris Sarandon (the sneaky, smarmy Kurotowa); Edward James Olmos (feisty, loyal Mito); and unexpected appearances by veteran character stalwarts Tress MacNeille, Jeff Bennett, Tony Jay (who does a brief opening voiceover), and the Little Mermaid herself, Jodi Benson. Shia LaBeouf's Asbel sounds a bit rocky at first, but he grew on me. Mark Hamill, fresh from his outstanding turn as the evil Muska on the brilliant yet underappreciated (on some places anyway) CASTLE IN THE SKY dub, plays a small role as the Mayor of Pejite. He only appears in two scenes, and consequently, his performance here isn't as remarkable as his work in CASTLE IN THE SKY, but it's nonetheless great to hear his golden voice in another Miyazaki dub. Arguably the highlight of this dub is Patrick Stewart as Nausicaa's mentor, Lord Yupa. He speaks with strong Shakespearian diction and carries the dub as a whole through his subtle, charismatic rendition of this skilled swordsman.

Miyazaki declared that any new adaptation of his masterpiece should be nothing but a straight translation and no cuts. English dub scriptwriters Donald H. Hewitt and Cindy Davis Hewitt (who worked on Spirited Away) honor his wishes through their adaptation, remaining faithful to the story while tweaking a bit of terminology for comprehension purposes.

As with Miyazaki's other works, Joe Hisaishi provides the music score. Compared to the more lush soundtracks he composed for Miyazaki's later films, his score for NAUSICAA, while undeniably beautiful, occasionally comes off as a tad primitive, notably when it breaks into sometimes jarring techno-synth jingles. For better or worse, his score remains intact in the new cut of NAUSICAA, which will no doubt please purists. I was a bit disappointed, however--especially when his ambitious reworking of the CASTLE IN THE SKY score (composed exclusively for that dub) turned out so well IMO. A film like this deserves a 5.1 remix! Nonetheless, it's my one quibble of this otherwise top-notch English track of Miyazaki's most revered masterpiece.

The DVD sports a near flawless visual transfer and a humble serving of extras--which include the typical English voice talent featurette we saw on Disney's previous wave of Miyazaki's films, trailers and TV spots, and a second disc devoted entirely to storyboards. The most noteworthy feature on this disk is a 30-minute long documentary, ""The Birth of Studio Ghibli"", which is undistractingly dubbed into English. For fans that are curious about the upbringing of this animation studio and wondering which of their films have yet to be released, this is a must-see.

As someone who has been very pleased with Disney's releases of Miyazaki's works so far, I am delighted to say that they have done yet another bang-up job on polishing this legendary classic for new generations to cherish. Don't be fooled by its primitive looks; NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND's status as a masterpiece resonates from the first minute to the last.",1110672000,14,5681,5.110991379310345
1140226,5,7884063387,"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is probably one of my favourite movies of all time and I am incredibly delighted that it has finally seen the light of day uncut in North America. The horribly altered Warriors of the Wind (an early dub of the film back in the '80's) had rekindled an interest in Japanese animation in me that picked up where Battle of the Planets left off and I have been a fan of director Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's output ever since.
Miyazaki's later films (all of which are great)certainly look better than Nausicaa (such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away) and there's no debating that, but considering this was only his second job as director for a theatrical film and it was made in something like 3 months (his later films have taken more than a year) it still holds up pretty well. It is starting to show its age of course, 20 years after it was originally released, but Miyazaki's story telling still stands tall.
I have mixed feelings about the new dub, which to my ears is the worst sounding of the Disney releases of Miyazaki's films. It is an improvement over the Warriors of the Wind dub where Nausicaa sounded like Rocky the Squirrel (and it is an urban myth that it was the same voice actor as Rocky), but it does suffer from a lot of Explaino (a comic book method of explaining the plot details to viewers things that would be immediately obvious to the characters themselves).  However, a lot of that is present in the Japanese script, so it can't be solely blamed on Disney. Most of the actors are fine in their roles (where else can you get the Captain of the Enterprise and the (new) Cmdr. Adama together in one sci-fi related film?). However, Alison Lohman has a tough job in trying to convey the intricacies to Nausicaa'a character and while it's not bad, just doesn't convey it as well as her Japanese counterpart.
Commenting on some of the other reviews I have read for this film, there seems to be a lot misinformation out there. The music in Nausicaa is unchanged - it's exactly the same as the original Japanese release (the CD is available on Tokuma 35ATC-3 and is great as well). The script is faithful to the original and for the most part is the same as most fan translations I've seen and my limited Japanese language ability can tell. The complaints about the slow pacing in parts are valid, but this type of introspection is common in most Japanese cinema, from the classics of Kurosawa and Ozu, to even other weel known animations such as Ghost in the Shell. It's a cultural quirk that makes Japanese movies unique from their US counterparts and I for one don't have a problem with it. A lot of these scenes were cut in Warriors in the Wind, and while it made for a tighter, action packed film, it removed a lot of details in what motivates Nausicaa to do what she does. Without character, there's no heart.
Also, there are a lot of people who compare the film to the manga (comic) version by Miyazaki. The film was created about 10 years before the serialization of the manga was completed, so obviously there are going to be huge differences between the two. Only about 2 volumes of the 7-volume work were completed at that time. Comparing the two is like apples and oranges. The scope of the film is by necessity limited, but that doesn't make the end result better (or worse) than its source material.  The manga is a sprawling epic and is much darker and mature than the film would lead one to believe however. It's well worth checking out as well. It's highly unlikely that the entire story will ever be animated and with Princess Mononoke more or less a sequel in spirit (since it touches on the same themes as Nausicaa -- the film and manga) I think Miyazaki may have said all that he wants about the subject.",1110585600,4,3784,4.498546511627907
1140227,4,7884063387,"I admit, I came late to Miyazaki's work. I first saw things like Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and now I'm working my way down the list of his older movies.

Nausica is a welcome addition to that list. It has the Miyazaki trademarks of a strong young girl as the lead character, and a fascination with flight. This time, the girl (she's Nausica) is princess of a small band of people. The live on the edge of the Toxic Forest, a lethal piece of ecological wreckage from some hinted-at catastrophe a thousand years before. Nausica has a unique affinity for the beings in that forest, including the Ohmu who guard it. The forest and village come under attack, and she discovers just how her people depend on that forest despite its hazards.

This movie is a very likeable and reasonably kid-safe, despite some monsters, fighting, and mildly graphic injury. It's also clear that this is one of Miyazaki's earlier works, a step on the way to his current greatness. A lot of the plot, especially early on, is driven by a ""talking to myself"" mechanism instead of real visual storytelling. The Nausica character is closer to the long-legged, micro-skirted anime standard than his later characters, and the animation lacks the fluency of his later work. These are minor problems, though, and it's interesting to see how Miyazaki outgrew them.

This is another enjoyable film from Miyazaki. I fault it only for not meeting the standards that Miyazaki set in his later work, but it's still miles ahead of most other animation.

1140229,4,7884063387,"A technical complaint first, and then the real review. :-)

I'm not sure what it is about Disney's DVDs, but the ""widescreen"" format never quite works correctly on my system. I have to play with the zoom setting to see the whole picture, but by then it's much smaller than the screen on ALL sides; playing it without the zoom cuts off the sides and it looks like any old FULLscreen cut. EVERY Disney DVD that I own does this and it's quite annoying, as the rest of my widescreen DVD's work just fine from any other studio. It's a real headscratcher.

Aside from that complaint, the film itself is beyond perfection! Gorgeous animation, strong characters, amazing story, BRILLIANT film score, wonderful voice cast for the English track. Just to have the entire movie, and not the horrid U.S. edit (Warriors of the Wind), is a wonderful WONDERFUL thing. I had no idea this was coming out, so my surprise at seeing this on the shelf in the video store was such that I had a few tears welling up in my eyes and I bought it immediately. I'm so happy Miyazaki's films are getting a well deserved release here in the US! ^ . ^

Also, Joe Hisaishi is one of the most brilliant film composers of all time; every film I watch with a Hisiashi score, it's the music that I remember the most; it is so touching and beautiful, and affects me in powerful ways - as GOOD music should.",1110153600,2,1368,4.399209486166008

1140420,5,7884063387,"Miyazaki's movies extol virtue.  The lead character in this work derives her power from an understanding of the world in which she lives and from her unselfish service to others.  Interestingly and in contrast with most movies this director rewards the good characters and punishes the bad without ever seeming formulaic.

This movie is set in a post-apocalyptic world and reflects a strong environmentalist mindset--take care of the Earth and all that--but it is much more.  As opposed to written works, movies do not have the time to explore characters and have to use shorthand to clue you in--the Japanese do this well.  You would have to go as far as Kubrick's 2001 to find another movie as bizarrely imaginative as this one.

My wife shakes her head when I keep bringing these Miyazaki movies home, but I've got to say that I find them so much more enjoyable than the typical movie offerings because they are so imaginative.  Whether about bathhouses for spirits, flying pigs, evil cat kings, etc., these movies all demonstrate the value of being good and honorable--they are worthy entertainment.",1110067200,5,1103,4.961956521739131

With lush landscapes that will come to no surprise to devotees of Miyazaki's work, Nausicaa is filled with a vivid palette of colors, and vivid colorful characters.

The English dub is fantastic, as well. Alison Lohman is perfect as the gently brave Princess Nausicaa. Patrick Stewart is a perfect fit for the wise and revered Lord Yupa. Edward James Olmos is utterly believable as the loyal and feisty Mito. And Uma Thurman is fabulous as the cold and cynical Kushana.

If you see a twisted character and assume that they are the villain you will most likely find out you're wrong towards the end of the film. Miyazaki doesn't follow any formulas when making his films. There doesn't have to be a love story. There doesn't have to be a good guy or bad guy. But in all his films there is this imaginative journey you're taken on and you become swept up in these worlds Miyazaki has created for you.

1140428,5,7884063387,"From the director of academy award winning Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki brings to us his personal first, Nausicaa of The Valley of The Wind.  This epic fantasy is based off the manga, and shortend to bring it to the delight of fans everywhere.

Nausicaa takes place a thousand years after a global war which left many parts of the earth covered in toxins an unihabital to humans, but not to bugs which are literally the size of houses.  Nausicaa, the princess of the Valley of the Wind, leds the people of the Valley of the Wind, which is one of the places still populated, with courage and heart unlike any other. The people look to her for strength and reasurance when they are invaded by an empire looking to awaken one of the Giant Warriors to exterminate the bugs they view as the problem of the toxins.  This remains untrue due to Nausicaa's discovering it is in fact that these bugs protect the forest which are slowly cleansing the earth of the toxins.  it is now left up to her to stop the empire's that threaten the vally from angering the bugs and destroying the world.

This epic fantasy focuses on the environment and a possible future which could happen years from now if nations keep waring and destroying the earth.  Its a touching tale one sure to keep you on the edge of your seat, and im not just saying that.  It goes from one susupensful scene to another as you watch Nausicaa strive to save her home and her people: she sacrifice everything to save them.  The music in this film is also absoluting enchanting, i love films with great music and this one tops it off. Plus it has such vivid color and imagination that you forget that its a movie and not the real thing.  Its simply breath taking.

I personally love the japanese voice track myself, but with an all star cast doing the english track, and you can tell the hard work they put into it to make the story flow right and stick to the original script, it makes it doubly enjoyable.  While i do think they could have gotten a better voice for Nausicaa in the English track all the other voices are A+.

1140521,5,7884063387,"Nausica of the Valley of the Winds is loosely based on an old Japanese legend known as The Princess Who Loved Insects that has its roots in the 12th century.  In this tale a princess openly displays her liking for insects, especially caterpillars.  However, her mother finds it repulsive and demands that she quits her unlady-like behavior, but she refuses, as she desires to enlighten that all creatures are wonderful and have an important function to mankind.  Same theme is used in Nausica, but with a fantastic adventure where the destiny of the world is at stake, as the young princess Nausica spreads her compassionate and affectionate love without boundaries.

Nausica is a fearless young teenager that has deep affection for the natural beauty of the world.  This affection roots within her morals and values, which are based on trust, compassion, and understanding.  This is an understanding that all creatures live on the same terms under the same sun despite appearance.  However, it is how things appear that brings birth to fear in the people of Nausica's world, as a vast poisonous jungle is expanding its boarders into the realm of human beings. Inside the jungle exists gigantic insects that when threatened are consumed by rage, which roots itself in fear, as they attack the threat without mercy.  Recognizing the power of fear elevates Nausica's understanding that fear is the source of evil, and if fear is eradicated then harmony can exist.

Different kingdoms within the futuristic world of Nausica fight for power to control the world, as they all believe their concept of peace is the correct answer.  The leaders of each kingdom are willing to wipe out each other in the quest for peace, which includes burning down the poisonous jungle and all the insects despite historical evidence that war and burning down the poisonous jungle is ineffective, and in the past it has brought mankind closer to extinction.  This destructive concept is essentially a uniform belief within all leaders of the world while they rely on their might in firepower.  However, Nausica acknowledges the importance of harmony within the world and between all beings, but others are not willing to listen.  The leaders turn their deaf ear to Nausica, as they firmly believe, a belief rooted in fear and other emotions, that they are right while they unknowingly are about to bring the world to extinction.

Hayao Miyazaki who is best known for Spirited Away (2001) directed this magnificent tale about Nausica, which in many ways is groundbreaking.  The hero of the story is a confident young girl, which was almost unheard of before the film was made.  Through this character Miyazaki brings important notions for the audience to ponder such as environmental issues, war, and a positive life philosophy that stems in acceptance and love.  Nausica of the Valley of the Winds uniqueness radiates through its multifaceted moral lessons that can be hard to follow for young audiences.  Nonetheless, Miyazaki remains true to the purpose of storytelling without using cinematic clichs from other films, which is to elevate understanding and wisdom of how to better one's own life.  In essence, Miyazaki's visual journey lays the ground work for later wonderful anime films such as Grave of Fireflies (1988), Whisper of the Heart (1995), and Princess Mononoke (1997), which was developed through decades of hard work.

The story of Nausica's adventure brings several interesting notions for the audience to contemplate.  Many of these ideas are not foreign, but are presented in an appealing way, which could be easily accessible for adults and teens.  Young children might enjoy the animation, but miss the complex message.  Yet, these children will remember the film through its wonderful animation together with the films score, which will echo in their head for months after having seen the film.  An interesting thought would be if the United Nations would make Nausica of the Valley of the Winds required viewing for all of the world leaders, as a lesson to help making better decisions in regards to humanity.

1140523,5,7884063387,"(*****) for the Japanese-language track on this long-awaited Region 1 release of Kaze no Tane no Naushika on DVD. Compared to grey- and black-market DVDs and VHSs to which Miyazaki fans have had to resort, this new DVD mastering and cleanup with remastered Hisaishi soundtrack is like a newly-polished gem. Bravo, and about time!

(  **1/2) for this boo-hiss Disney-fied English-track mess foisted on North Americans! Judging by the mangled pronunciations, soundtrack ""enhancements"", dramatic-element telegraphing and noticeable character & plot alterations, we-all Yanks must be too stupid to understand what Miyazaki-san originally had in mind. Or maybe, like other Disney repackagings, somebody really, totally missed the point and just doesn't ""get"" the original story and presentation.

Bizarre changes abound:
-Since when did Ohmu become ""Ohm""?
-The God Warrior has been renamed ""Giant Warrior"" -- why, so deists & theists wouldn't be offended?
-Why oh why is the city-state of Pejitei (peh-jee-tay) pronounced pedge-ite?
-Why is Nausica voiced by an actress with a vocal palette of sobs, anger, and monotone?
-Why was Yupa to choose the name of a child without first being asked to be her godfather?

Extra soundtrack compositions intrude constantly, spoiling the dramatic feel of what were tender or sad/dramatic moments. Evidently nature abhores a vacuum; so do obtuse soundtrack directors.

Insufficient voice talent coaching and direction (except for Patrick Stewart), questionable translations, elective plot surgery and gratuitous tinkering-by-focus group have made this an annoying, shameful product. Not as bad as ""Warriors of the Wind"", maybe, but in the same spirit, if not extent.

I can recommend this to anyone over about ten years old. The themes are mostly adult, and the situations of extreme violence, threat, death and loss are pretty intense. Despite the Disney veneer and American kid-vid standards, this is just not for the kiddies.",1109203200,8,1960,5.516666666666667
1140524,5,7884063387,"I have loved this movie since I was a child and was greatly looking forward to its new release on DVD.  I was especially looking forward to the addition of those scenes cut from the originally English dubbing and the corrected storyline, and was not at all disappointed in them. In fact they were exactly what the original release needed and should never have been cut in the first place.

However except for the voice acting by Patrick Stewart, the English dubbing is far from superb.  Naussica and others come across as dry and unfeeling in the film compared to that of their original counterparts.  Whether this is due to the actors themselves or translation issues from the original I don't know, I am even willing to chalk it up to my nostalgic remembrance of the original voice work.

Either way I definitely recommend this movie for any home library.

the best movies of all time, in any genre.

The new Disney DVD release is good.  The visuals are wonderful --

great color, very crisp, very clean.  The transfer does justice to

Miyazaki's sweeping, highly detailed visual style.

The English dub is also quite good.  It's quite faithful to the

original dialog, with only a few cringe-inducing moments.  The

voice acting is sometimes rather flat, though, lacking the

emotional intensity that it deserves.

The audio is quite good, though the sound effects sometimes get

pushed farther down in the mix than they should.

Overall, the English translation, voice acting, and audio mix is

significantly better than that of the ""Castle in the Sky"" DVD.

Not quite as good as the original Japanese audio track, but very

listenable.

who needs extras?

1140526,5,7884063387,"First of all - I have loved this movie since I saw it in 1986 in Japan as a kid. I first saw images on a huge screen inside a mall in Tokyo. I gasped and oo'd and awe'd until my Japanese host family decided they had to take me to go see it. It is truly awesome on a big screen, even if you don't speak Japanese.

That being said, the disney release is the best of at least 3 translation/subtitled versions of Nausicaa that I have seen. They did a very good job of expanding the dialogue a little bit so that the plot is comprehensible.

I will admit it has huge appeal to chicks. Being a chick I love the theme, love the heroine and I love how she's basically on no one's side - she's on the side of reason and sanity! How many heroes in most action flicks shout that the killing has to stop - how many stand up unarmed against what is wrong? That is what makes her so appealing to me.

The big powers in this world are nuts. Though some have commented that they seem dated and cold war like, I think some of it is quite topical to this day and age. These powers are fanatical and willing to kill each other indiscriminately and at any cost - that is probably a familiar thing in any era.  There are always little countries being threatened by bigger ones. There are always powers who think they are good, right and justified in what they do, no matter how powerful or big they are.",1109116800,5,1382,4.088560885608856
1140527,4,7884063387,"It took a while for me to start liking this film. It starts with presenting the setting: a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Greed has caused a global ecological disaster. Only a few places are still fit for humans to live. The Valley of the Wind being one. Even there there are dangers of climate extremes and mutated animals, but it will have to do. Nausicaa's people try to build a new society, one that is in harmony with nature, but they do not know how. Only later in the film do they learn that even they are causing great damage to the environment, and misunderstanding the signs.

While Nausicaa's people try to learn from their mistakes, others try to revive the old and dangerous technologies and use them for conquest. Like so many other would-be world conguerors they cloak their ambitions by claiming it is all for the common good. When Nausicaa escapes the invaders she learns the awful truth of her world. Humanity has misunderstood everything again, but this time there is a chance of redemption; that is if she can make anyone listen before it is too late...

One thing that is interesting in this film, and in Princess Mononoke also, is the Japanese ambivalent attitude towards authority and duty. If I understand the Japanese attitude correctly you cannot do anything wrong for as long as you honourably do your duty. Since even the conquerors sincerely believe they are acting in the common good they cannot be totally evil. Therefore you do not see this manichean division into good and evil as you see in all Hollywood films. The problems and solutions described in the film become more complex and more interesting.",1109030400,3,1633,4.787234042553192

My brother in law had rented the movie for his son. The entire family watched the movie and loved it. When I first saw this film, I thought even then, it was a great movie.. even for a cartoon. In those days, I had no real appreciation for animated films as art as I do now. This movie helped change my views of these kinds of movies.

Even in the edited, bootleg, incomplete version of the 80's ""Warrior's"", few animated films can match it.

1140720,5,7884063387,"I am glad that Disney has decided to release this movie in Region 1, enabling me to view it on a Region 1 player.  I understand that Miyazaki initially began work as an animator in 1963 at Toei Animation and there met Isao Takahata (Anime Explosion, the What?Why? &Wow! of Japanese Animation, Drazen, Patrick, Stone Bridge Press, Berkeley, 2003).  Together, Miyazaki and Takahata with Yasuo Otsuka, made an animated feature, Prince of the Sun, Hol's Great Adventure (hint..hint... will someone release this on DVD? Will some anime festival please show this in the United States?).  Lupin III, Castle of Cagliostro was co-written and directed by Miyzaki for Toho Studios in 1979/1980.  However, I think it is safe to say that this is the first Ghibli Studio full-length movie.  But enough of history...

Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is my favorite Miyazaki film.  I am sure that other reviews will summarize the plot, so I will not discuss that in this review.  Instead, I will say that as in Princess Mononoke, there are strong ecological overtones and strong female roles in this film.  The Princess Nausicaa exhibits independence, intelligence, kindness, compassion, bravery and leadership.  Nausicaa has a strong interest in animals, including insects, which Miyazaki apparently cites as supported in Japanese folklore from a story from the twelve century collection entitled Tsutusmi Chunagon Monogatari (Drazen, 2003).  What more could one ask from a role model, let alone a female one.

The animation is superb.  While perhaps a little simplistic, remember this is circa 1984, it is still very enjoyable.  The attention to detail, realism and color, stand the test of time and are watchable over and over again.  Miyazaki's flying machines, as in Castle in the Sky, are a treat. Another production note is that this movie marks the arrival of composer Joe Hisaishi who contributed the film score, the first of many Ghibli movies he scored (Drazen, 2003).

There is a plot.  There is a story.  There is character development.  Perhaps not enough plot twists.  Perhaps too predictable.  There is some violence.  This is a story of a prophecy.  This is a war story, a war between the animals (the Ohmu) and man, between men (the different nations), between loyalty to one's own values and one's homeland (Asbel).  It is a relatively complex story, animated or not.  I am only sad that, not knowing Japanese, I wonder if I am losing something in the translation and dependence on the whim of the dubbing script? (Drazen, 2003).  Sometimes the film might also appear a bit preachy.  However, despite these caveats, I think this film deserves status as an essential anime in any collection.  I am glad that Disney has finally released this for viewing in Region 1 (the United States).  At least we won't have to depend on Quinton Tarentino to force Disney's hand or watch an American reissue a la Shall We Dance or Point of No Return [La Femme Nikita].

Then one day I lost my beloved tape and so began searching for a copy on the internet. Only then did I find out the film wasn't the whole of the story, but was actually inferior to the original. I found a rather poorly subtitled Japanese version, and gobbled up the suddenly new film. As I was searching for a copy (not easy to find, btw) I came across stories that Disney was going to re-do the english version and release it in the states in the near to distant future. I was bouncing off the walls! I'm so excited to see it coming out now. I do think Disney should have gone to theatres though. I can't wait to see what has been done to this special story of mine.

1140723,5,7884063387,"For a lot of Miyazaki fans from 80s, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind gave them the defining moment of anime experience.  In Japan, though a lot of people did enjoy it, anime had always been seen as a sort of geeky pleasure, only kids and those adults who were a bit recluse and anti-social really got into it.  The quality of Miyazaki's films did really change that landscape (at least for Miyazaki's films).  You'll see why after watching this classic --- Miyazaki was already doing it in early 80s!

The theme of the film reflects the days when Cold War was still in progress, and Miyazaki's own struggle in reconciling the world shared both by the strong and the weak --- he was made deeply uncomfortable by Darwinistic thoughts back in the day.  The world dominated by the poisonous plants and mutated insects instead of human being is the reflection of the thoughts.  Human's greed and misuse of civilization led to their own demise, and it is the human who became the weaker in the world of Nausicaa.  How do the human survive in the world dominated by now antagonistic mother nature?  You'll find out by watching this film!!

If you have seen Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke, you will see the common underlying theme.  However, Nausicaa is much more satisfying in that the film was completed when Miyazaki was still unsure of how human can reconcile their destructive thoughts and actions with the mother nature, of which they are only a tiny part after all.  To me that ambiguity made Nausicaa less preachy.

It is true that the *true* Nausicaa story does not end the way the film version does.  When Miyazaki had to finish the movie, the graphic novel version was still in progress, so the film version does not really end the way Miyazaki really wanted to end; I think he wasn't sure at the time if ending it with a resurrection of messiah of some sort was the best idea.  Anyhow, if you really come to love Nausicaa, I really recommend the graphic novel version.  The story is a few orders of magnitude more elaborate and enjoyable.

I definitely recommend this film to anyone, not just kids.  This is the film that made Miyazaki a very well respected film maker.",1108598400,3,2174,4.619791666666667

This is Hayao Miyazaki's second film, and the first one he really wrote with his own character designs.  It is one of my favorite films of all time and is based on his long running manga (which seriously expands the story, in case you are interested).  Yes, it is not like Loony Tunes, but rather a mix of Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings.  It is not to be confused with typical Japanese anime, though.",1108598400,4,671,4.512396694214876
1140725,5,7884063387,"Nausicaa has always been my favorite Miyazaki film. I'm not a big fan of post-apocalyptic future stories, but Nausicaa is the one major exception. The scenes of flight have not been matched in any film, animated or live-action.

Although US parents may feel it is a little too violent for children, they may want to consider it first before rejecting it off hand. The ultimate message here is that violence is futile and pointless. It is only when Nausicaa completely gives up and makes a selfless sacrifice that anything in the movie is solved. Never since Lord of the Rings (the books) has there been such a moralistic story touching upon tolerance, compassion, environmentalism and love for living things told without preaching or beating the audience over their heads. By the end you're completely unaware that any messages have been transmitted at all, yet they are there.

Nausicaa is so much wiser than the adults around her and they respect her for that. Which teaches kids another lesson in responsibility and maturity as well.

The later Miyazaki film Mononoke Hime tried to revisit these same themes (with the same Nausicaa character designs!) with a lesser effect.

Though it was released in the US in the 80s as 'Warriors of the Wind', it was abridged and most of the drama of the film was lost.  It has been a source of wonder to me that such films, so much more intimate and sincere than nearly anything our own animated film creators has procuded, have remained viewable only to those willing to struggle with the original Japanese language or second rate fan-subtitlers.

This film, and several others also of Miyazaki's creation, remain some of my favorites.  Disney bought the rights to release them, and it is flatly astounding that so few have been released as yet.

At any rate, this is a simply wonderful film, as anyone who has seen it will say, and I can't recommend it enough.  Further, support of these recent studio Ghibli releases will hopefully cause the other, more obscure films to be released as well. One can only hope.",1106438400,5,984,4.5

Finally, an American version of Nausicaa that isn't edited for the American short attention span.  This magical film works on all levels, a wonderful children's story that has some serious issues and can be explored very deeply.  Not to mention being beautifully animated and like all Miyazaki works; extremely imaginative and inspirational.  A must have for any Miyazaki fan.  FYI, a unedited English version of Nauiscaa is a huge deal because the first time Miyazaki released the film in the US it was butchered in the editing room.  He was so upset by this that he has forever had a bad taste about America as a audience.  Now we can finally enjoy the work the way it was meant to be viewed.",1103587200,3,955,4.603550295857988
1140729,4,7884063387,"Nausicaa is almost legendary in Japan, as it was Hayao Miyazaki's first film.  It often tops lists of Japan's best-remembered films, and for this reason it's been probably the most highly anticipated of all of Miyazaki's back catalog here in the United States.  While it is an excellent animated film in its own right, it is not nearly as refined as Miyazaki's later works, and its political message is both dated and a bit ham-fisted compared with the slightly more subtle approach Miyazaki has taken with later films such as Porco Rosso or Spirited Away.

Nausicaa is a film adaptation of a manga (Japanese graphic novel series) that ran seven volumes over the span of 13 years.  The film itself only covers parts of the first two volumes, and you do get the sense while watching it that you're only seeing a small part of a much larger story.  The duration of the manga also meant that both the politics of the world (which are relayed in allegorical form in the film) had changed during those 13 years, along with Miyazaki's own viewpoint on what he wanted Nausicaa to be.  This makes the film feel a bit more locked into early 1980's real-world politics - as a tale of two warring superpowers who nearly destroy each other with super-weapons - than the more sweeping scope of the original manga.

The end result is a film that shows great promise on the part of its director, but that feels a bit incomplete and that hasn't aged as gracefully as some of Miyazaki's other films.  It's a film that's remembered in Japan as a landmark - and it was, in 1984 - but out of its original context and when compared to Miyazaki's later work, it just does not hold up quite as well.

Worth seeing, and of course a must-own for any Miyazaki collector.  But not his best film, despite its reputation.",1103500800,,1792,4.554517133956386

This movie has been though a lot though. This movie was released a long time ago,

without Miyazaki's permission, as a horribly cut up version of the original film called

Warriors of the Wind. I have Warriors of the Wind on VHS. Even horribly cut up, this

greatest feeling I got was from the ending (I will not spoil it for those of you who haven't

seen it). This movie has the same gorgeous artwork that Mononoke has, the same

wonderful uplifting music, and I think good voice-overs (mind you I saw the Warriors of

I truly believe this movie was the turning point of Anime. Or perhaps the movie was made in such an era. Anime had never been so sophisticated and beautiful before that era.

Nausicaa, as it may be typical in Miyazaki's movies, is a character with a high moral standard and capabilities of carrying out the act of helping people and the harmony of all things. If one is Miyazaki's fan, ""Nausicaa"" is a must see movie. When Miyazaki started being recognized in the US or other countries, ""Nausicaa"" was already an ""old"" movie, and that's why it is not as known as the other recent ones, but I know, as a Japanese, that Hayao Miyazaki is and will be always ""Hayao Miyazaki of Nausicaa"" no matter how many great movies he has made or will make.

About 20 years passed since the film was made, but we can look at Nausicaa with very pleasure, excitement etc. I am not able to believe that the film making was more than 20 years ago, very real animation, for instance the scene that Nausicaa helped the old man Yupa riding a animal who was followed by a holy insect, Oumu is that. At that time, Nausicaa helped Yupa by letting him know the escape way with riding a unique airplane, Meve. The scene that Nausicaa overlooked the surface from Meve was incredible real animation. Even if I consider that the movie is a old movie, the animation is marverous, that is, the scene that landscape aprroached near and near.

The story of Nausicaa was wonderful. The movie implyed Miyazaki's anti war principle by using the intro scene,[Death Seven Days War caused by Gigantic Army], by the war, the world covered with Daath Acid. I think that Miyazaki made the scene while he knew the truth that there were a lot of falling acid after atomic bombs fell at Hiroshima in Japan under World War 2. I think that he not only made just a animation movie, but also was included the movie the important message. And the point is different to Disney movie. And when I looked at Aumu first time, I disliked Aumu for the grotesque looking. But as I felt the Aumu's deep tenderness, my emotion changed. Maybe Miyazaki will want to say what should see thorough the inner things, not outer things.

Anyway, this is a great movie that I am thought about many things, peace, love, tenderness, friendship and familyship, not only the real animation.

Thank you for reading my poor English.",1101081600,8,1829,4.604294478527607
1140896,5,7884063387,"Unlike like quite a bit of the general populace (although I hardly think of myself as general), I have seen the subtitled original release of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.  I am also a huge fan of what Disney is doing for America's exposure to anime (if not a huge fan of Disney itself).  I've seen the original subtitled, as well as the dubbed, versions of all of Miyazaki's films brought to America by Disney and I have no complaints.  Most of the voice actors that Disney chooses are fairly accurate for what was originally portrayed in the Japanese releases and Disney didn't butcher the translations (well, not in too many cases).

Anyway, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is one of my favorite Miyazaki films (if not THE favorite), and I am ecstatic that Disney is bringing it to us.  I love this movie and I have illiterate adult friends that couldn't watch the subtitled version and I was afraid they might never be able to.  I'm surprised Disney hasn't done this sooner, as they brought Spirited Away very quickly to the U.S. despite containing some of the more abstract Taoist beliefs that most children wouldn't understand.  Nausicaa seems to be right up Disney's alley, sporting some of the more environmentalist ideals prevelent in some of their other films. As you may have noticed, I have no intentions of giving you a synopsis of the movie as that's what online film databases are for.  Just rest assured that this is a fun film that is easily enjoyed by people of any age.",1099526400,5,1497,4.601503759398496
1140897,5,7884063387,"I have long awaited this release on DVD and am so excited to see it FINALLY come out.

About 17 years ago this film was on HBO quite a bit, but aired as ""Warriors of the Wind."" HOWEVER this DVD has footage that was originally cut out of the film by the US distributor....20 minutes worth!!

A great environmental message, and although it's from way back the film is a masterpiece. If you like it, you should check out the graphic novel that Miyazaki did - it's what the movie is based on!

Like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, the central character is a strong woman who fulfills an ancient legend to end all wars and ""tie the strings of the earth together.""

A must have for anime fans and environmentalists alike!",1093996800,9,720,4.431818181818182
1140968,5,7884063387,"Absolutely, BUY THIS FILM.  IT IS ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF ANY TYPE EVER MADE.

Disney, after originally having scheduled the release of this masterpiece for August 31, having moved it to Feb. 22, and having taken it off the release list, has now reinstated its release on Feb. 22.  It will be released with Porco Rosso and The Cat Returns; originally, it was to be released with My Neighbor Totoro, but The Cat has been substituted.  This is mistifying, because Cat is a sequel to Whisper from the Heart, a sweet and endearing film that has never been released in the U.S.; a studio does not usually release the sequel first. What is Disney thinking, and what is to be done with Totoro?

That said, Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind was Miyazaki's first full-length original film (I don't count the Lupin films because they're part of someone else's work), and it is utterly superb.  It is adapted from the epic manga series that he created in between projects while working for other directors, and only covers about 30% of the enormous story.  It has a heavy ecological message, and shows Miyazaki's trademark fascination with flight and unusual animals.  The story is deep, rich, emotional, and satisfying.  The soundtrack, Jo Hisashi's first for Miyazaki, is one of his best; it is not extremely varied, but it is rich and emotional.

A version of this film was introduced as Warriors of the Wind in the late 1980's in the U.S.  While the dub was excellent, twenty minutes of cuts made in the film infuriated Miyazaki to the point where he refused to allow any more U.S. sales of his films until Disney agreed to release the films uncut and to do their prodigious best with the vocal talents for the dubs.  I still do not feel that their choice of voice actors has always been the best; some of the performances in Castle in the Sky and Princess Mononoke were at best lackluster, but there's always the subtitles and original Japanese soundtrack for purists who aren't happy with the results.

This film is an absolute must-have for any animation fan.  Even being Miyazaki's first film, it is a detailed, mature work far beyond the scope of most animation directors and storytellers.  I just hope that Amazon will release this film in a 3-pack with Porco Rosso and The Cat Returns.",1093305600,271,2283,4.658354114713217
1140969,5,7884063387,"after announcing the release dates for studio ghibli films dvds ""NAUSICAA"", ""TOTORO"" and ""PORCO ROSSO"" as 31st august, disney has postponed the release indefinitely for reasons best known to them. maybe disney is too busy with films like ""lion king3"", pocahontas4 or aladdin5 and their special edition dvd releases. films like ""lilo and stitch"" and ""pocahontas"" are available on dvd everywhere in the market. still disney is re-releasing their ""masterpiece"" editions early next year. disney is one company which surely knows how to make money out of its own crap!! one thing which everyone would like to know is why disney and buena vista is afraid to release these ""hayao miyazaki- studio ghibli"" gems to the west inspite of aquiring their rights years ago?? they have all of studio ghibli films in their possession for years and they have just been sitting on it!! how disgusting!

according to the website nausicaa.net the release has been postponed purposely till january 2004 to coincide with the u.s. release of miyazaki's latest film ""howl's moving castle"", which is already making waves. how shameless.. just to sell few more copies, why do they have to act so cheap?? or is it just the fear that after watching these gems, everyone will get to know how bankrupt disney and its fims have become?? disney never does such things to their own films. even their cheapest ""direct to video"" releases, which is mostly crap, is never postponed. so why do such things with studio ghibli classics which everyone is dying to see and own?? or have they got the ""idea"" of making their own ""totoro"" and ""nausicaa"" first?? remember ""atlantis""....???? disney's blatant rehash of miyazaki""s classic ""laputa:castle in the sky"". unfortunately the dvd of laputa was released in u.s. by buena vista long after atlantis was released (and bombed, of course!!). nonetheless everyone now knows from where disney got such a brilliant concept for ""atlantis"".

and that's just not all. beuna vista and disney have not been faithful to the english world when it comes to the relase of hayao miyazaki-studio ghibli dvds. just check out the same title which have been released in japan, BY NONE OTHER THAN BUENA VISTA ITSELF...

here are few of the major differences i found in their releases in japan and us:

1. now we all know what disney did to the english track of""laputa:castle in the sky""  by getting the score recomposed even for those silent moments. ok...padonable..at least they included the original japanese track but on the extra disc, unlike in japanese release, you cant view the film in storyboard mode using angle feature. so you just cant switch between the real film and the storyboards. also in japanese release, there's one very interesting alternate opening and closing for the film that has been included, which unfortunately is missing from the us release.

2. ""kiki's delivery service"" dvd release by buena vista japan includes a special documentary on the art of urusura, which was used in the film. sadly the people at buena vista u.s. found it lesser interesting than even john lasseter's introduction (which they never forget to add in any of ghibli's release and the worst part is you cant even skip it!!).

3. the lesser said would be better for ""princess mononoke"". this stunning piece of art enjoys a well deserved 3disc deluxe edition dvd release in japan which features a long in depth documentary on the ""making of"" the film besides other features like complete storyboards with angle feature and multi language track option. they even have a separate dvd release named ""how mononoke hime was born""...sigh!!!! any chances of it seeing a region1 release...??? forget about it..but be prepared for special editions of lion king5, aladdin6....and so on...!!

i just don't understand why disney is being so indifferent to the english audience.  i only wish ""NAUSICAA"" and all other upcoming dvds (including ""TOTORO"") are worth the wait....and i hope they include the ""special documentary on the recently opened miyazaki meuseum in japan"" as in japanese release of ""totoro"".

everyone in the west and around the world loves and adore miyazaki and studio ghibli as much as their own people. disney has absolutely no right to deprive us of such great stuff.its about time disney released studio ghibli masterpieces in a timely manner with all the respect and honour they deserve.",1093305600,16,4386,5.020632737276479
1140970,5,7884063387,"This is my favorite Miyazaki movie; I like it better than Laputa (Castle in the Sky), Spirited Away, or even Mononoke. As amazingly imaginative and touching as those movies are, I found Nausicaa to be even moreso. It just moved me in a way that is hard to describe. Visualy, the film is just plain beautiful. Even by today's standards. The music, as someone else stated, is haunting. Miyazaki's wonderful inventiveness is at its greatest here; the unusual post-apocaliptic world the film is set in is alive and unique.

The great tragedy is that I've only been able to watch this movie as a poor copy-of-a-copy fansubed bootleg. It simply has not been available in the States in any other form. Hopefuly we'll soon see what we were missing; props to those responsible for finaly getting this movie released here.

If you've liked any of Miyazaki's other films, or if you are an anime fan in general, check this movie out.",1091232000,20,921,4.714285714285714

Though each of his films might be an opus unto themselves, only one was able to touch me so significantly at that early age nearly two decades ago - this film.  It is long overdue and well worth the investment.",1090886400,6,584,4.4485981308411215

No word yet on when this batch of DVD's will actually be released; hopefully sometime in the next few months!
On a final note, I have not seen this movie, so please disregard the rating (I gave it 3 stars to be neutral). However, I have read the comic series (or ""manga"" as it is properly called) and I highly recommend it (there are four volumes all together). In fact, all of Miyazaki's work has been fabulous; check out ""Princess Mononoke"", ""Spirited Away"", ""Castle in the Sky"", ""The Castle of Cagliostro"", and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", all wonderful films.",1088553600,17,1072,4.5595854922279795

Miyazaki's films have a far reaching social impact and often touch on topics of environmentalism and the human impact.  His mastery of making the viewer relate intimately is amazing.

1140974,5,7884063387,"I've seen the R2 version, and was blown away.  Sure, we're talking a 20 year old animation here, but the story and characters are marvellous.  We may not have state of the art CG dodads flying at us, but the quality, and the creators involved are first rate all the way.
  The R2 disc featured comments by Kazuyoshi Katayama, a production assistant, later responsible for ""The Big O"", ""Appleseed"", and ""Argento-soma.""  It also features the legendary Hideaki Anno.  A Key Animator, who designed the Giant Robots for Miyazaki.  Anno is, of course, famous for directing ""Nadia, Secret of Blue Water"", ""Wings of Honneamise"" and his claim to fame, ""Neon Genesis Evangelion.""
  The music is by Joe Hisaishi, and it has touches that bring to mind things he does later in ""Castle in the Sky"", ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away."" The music was done under tight budget constraints, so they seem to have used a lot of synthesizers.  But hey, it's the 80's, so it's understandable.  Overall, a must have DVD by one of the great artists of our time, with a veritable who's who of anime supporting him.

1140975,5,7884063387,"I have been an animation fan all of my life. I've seen almost every Disney animated flick countless times. I've studied the work of Chuck Jones and marveled at the best of Don Bluth.

I have been a fan of Japanese animation in particular for years. I have seen countless animated films and studied them in depth. I own almost every Studio Ghibli film ever made (including Whisper of the Heart, the Cat Returns, Castle in the Sky, and Castle of Cagliostro). I am here to tell you that Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is without a doubt the greatest animated film I have ever seen in my life...

First of all, this is the first film that the animation genius Miyazaki ever attempted through his own studio. It is also a greatly condensed story, being adapted from a manga that it's creator wrote which was quite lengthly. That being said, this movie is PERFECT.

The animation may be old, but it rivals, and sometimes even demolishes, animation released in the theaters today. The action sequences (and particularly the flight sequences) are truly amazing to behold. The sound effects are marvelous. The music is mind-blowing. The pacing is perfect, the voice-acting beyond perfect. The quality of the artwork continues to astound. But that's not why this is the greatest animated film ever.

At it's heart this is s complex story of man vs. nature and man vs. man. How many times have we been over the topic of how man's meddling is threatening to destroy the world, and how perhaps one day the world will fight back? In the world created in this film, the world has been destroyed by what can only be described as an apocalypse (of man's doing). In response, plants and giant bugs are taking over the whole world and inhabiting vast patches of wasteland. Various countries are fighting endless wars with each other in a quest to survive. A new danger arises though, as one of the ancient weapons which destroyed the world is found. The nations all claim they want to use it to destroy the bugs that would destroy humanity (not to destroy each other, as each nation claims it's rivals would).

Toss into this mix an oasis from the harshness of the desert wastelands where everyone lives in peace and harmony...and a young girl may hold the secret to ending the eternal battle between man and nature.

The story in Nausicaa is incredibly stong, and the plot is quite deep. What really holds this movie together though, is Nausicaa herself. This young girl is the single greatest anime character ever to grace film. The key lies in something Miyazaki himself once said. A man who is the protagonist would destroy his enemies and defeat them. But the real world is not like that. In the real world, empathy and understanding is the only thing that can save us. And so rather than fight everyone to the death, Nausicaa takes on the far more dangerous goal of making everyone stop fighting before they annihilate everything worth saving. The Japanese are very in touch with the theme of the futility of war (having experienced its effects first-hand), and this film is a perfect example of the pinnacle of where that philosophy can take us.

Miyazaki has changed in his views over time, and this film is not what he considers his best work. I find this to be the ultimate irony. The man doesn't even realize the magnitude of what he has created...

I said it before and I'll say it again. This is the greatest animated film of all time. It covers the full range of emotion, from friendship and understanding to death and destruction and the chance of forgiveness  and renewal. I can often tell whether I will enjoy a movie by it's beginning. This movie has the best beginning of any movie I have ever seen. I always know if I will continue to love a movie when it ends, and this movie has the best ending of any movie I have ever seen...",1085702400,418,3834,4.5854014598540145
