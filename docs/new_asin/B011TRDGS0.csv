8725103,5,B011TRDGS0,"It's difficult to see ""The Forecaster"" in the United States.  It has shown up in a few theaters but soon disappears again.  There seems to be a distinct effort coming from somewhere to suppress the documentary.  It's doubtful that the formal DVD release will even take place within the U.S.  Fortunately, we have companies like Amazon to push against such unofficial sanctions and obstructions.

The bottom line is, here is the documentary, in English, for those who are interested (at least my copy was).  Just ignore the initial disc menu and get the movie playing, then, choose alternate audio tracks and choose English.  I would buy this disc quickly and wouldn't be surprised a bit if this offer disappears.  I wanted people to know that there was a English track as I apprehensively purchased a copy hoping I could find an English track (or at least an English subtitle option).  I'm glad I took the $20 chance.

As far as a review goes, I will say that the documentary is very good.  It's in the top 10% of documentaries that I have seen and was entirely watchable.  The only issue is the lack of counterpoints, at least giving balance to the assertions made.  The producers mention that they tried, but at least fleshing out the opposition would have been better balanced.  There are in fact guys like Bernard Madoff in the world so not all prosecutions are underhanded.  The result is Armstrong appearing to be a victim, which may be the truth after all.  Everyone I know is growing in distrust over the machinations of government so the timing of this documentary is near perfect.

At any rate, the treatment Armstrong received is in no way commensurate with the alleged crimes, even if he had committed them.  That really stands out and shows ulterior motive.  That aspect cannot be ignored.  The result is what we have seen in history countless times.  Now that he was very nearly killed through his incarceration, he is no longer playing nice.  Armstrong is no longer mincing words and tells it like it is.  I won't post his site but just search his name and you will find a brilliant but brazen rhetoric that has become fearless.

Martin Armstrong himself is an Economics Historian and clearly has substantial insight into the markets.  I need to see a counterargument or intelligent criticism of his ""Socrates"" program before I can even begin to comment on such a thing.  Amazing if true and if this program really does what he claims it can do, Martin's work is worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize.  He is certainly worth following and his opinions (through his site and YouTube videos) are truly exceptional.  Even Jim Rogers openly claims to follow his articles and writings.

Worth buying and watching and a great introduction to Martin Armstrong.  Highly Recommended.",1447286400,,2781,4.781512605042017
