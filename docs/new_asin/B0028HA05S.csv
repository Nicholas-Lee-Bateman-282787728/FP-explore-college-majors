8356246,5,B0028HA05S,Bought this series to help my daughter who is training to compete in high school barrel racing. She has greatly improved from watching and implementing the techniques taught by Clinton Anderson and Sherri Cervi. I would recommend this series to anyone wanting to better their skills in barrel racing!,1369612800,,300,5.142857142857143
8356247,5,B0028HA05S,The videos are great.  Came on time and in great shape.  Clinton an Sherry provide terrific barrel horse training instruction.,1359590400,,126,5.25
8356248,3,B0028HA05S,"This series is good in some ways and not in others. I find Clinton to be really informative if you can stand to listen to him talk for a LONG time. He repeats himself a lot but it helps you remember what he did and how he did it later when you get in the arena. Sherry is one heck of a barrel racer but definitely not much of a teacher. She has a hard time explaining herself and I found her hard to follow. The techniques they use are good but like anything everyone has their own style. I would definitely buy this if you can get it cheap enough, I wouldn't have paid full price for it.",1303084800,5,588,3.9495798319327733
8356249,2,B0028HA05S,I would NEVER buy from this supplier again! I was completly disappointed with my purchase.,1253923200,3,90,5.066666666666666
