4262391,5,B00450AG1Y,"This film is based on the true story of a group of monks during the recent civil war in Algeria.  There is a beauty in their devotion to the poverty stricken local residents, whom they serve with warmth and simplicity.

As the real world intrudes on their quiet labor, they must confront some essential questions that could affect their prospects of survival.  Should they accept an armed guard from a government with little legitimacy?  Should they leave?  Should they attempt to build a respectful relationship with the fundamentalist rebels who menacingly visit them?  Can they abandon their mission?  Their struggle with these questions forms the basis of the film's plot.  While slow if you are used to hollywood action, it is completely believable, with every scene pregnant with psychological nuance and internal turmoil.

With subtle elegance, the climax of the film occurs when the monks come to their decision over a meal, together listening to music on a crude cassette player and weeping at their intimacy and commitment to the community.  Even though I am not a believer, it brought tears to my eyes to witness the holiness and devotion of these men as they labored in obscurity and accepted their fate.

I saw this in Paris, where it was much discussed as an ""event film"".  The Parisians took this as art that made an important statement and deserved to be viewed seriously and debated.  This is an interesting contrast to the film experience elsewhere, whether you think it pretentious or not.

Warmly recommended.",1298678400,160,1529,4.968503937007874
4262392,5,B00450AG1Y,"Just watched the movie twice on board Singapore Airlines. This movie is slow for todays world but if you are patient enough you will be greatly encouraged. It is a true story and the commitment and the love that the monks display is great and brought tears to my eyes. I would say a ""must watch"" and I look forward to see it on DVD or itunes.",1298505600,75,342,4.119402985074627
4262393,4,B00450AG1Y,"What is refreshing about the popular and critical success of Of Gods and Men (winner the Grand Prix at Cannes 2010) is not that it is particularly experimental or challenging, but rather that it avoids going either for the populist crowd-pleasing angle or the tear-jerker that its real-life inspiration seems to demand.  The film is based on a true story of a small community of Cistercian monks in Tibhirine in Algeria caught up in the country's political troubles during the 1990s.  The monks regard it as their duty to bring aid and provide medicine for the local villagers who are suffering because of the local unrest and the battles between the national army and Islamic fundamentalists, but they risk incurring the wrath not only of the fundamentalists through their spreading of Christian beliefs, but also the Algerian army who believe that they may be giving aid and medicine to wounded militants.

It would be all too easy to let the divide that exists in this situation and the choice that is faced by the monks to remain simplistic - should they stay or should they go?  Even though there are some reservations expressed, there is never any doubt that the monks will come to the logical Christian conclusion and stay.  What is rather more impressive however is how the director refuses to allow this decision to be seen, as it would in a more conventional film, as simply an act of heroism or bravery.  The situation is not exploited shamelessly for heavy-handed sentimentality as it would be in a Hollywood production, but rather it goes deeper into the qualities that lie behind courage and potential martyrdom.  What the monks have to grapple with are their own doubts, their own flaws, their own fears - their very humanity.  It is not weak to confront these fears, but the true measure of the men is in how they come to terms with their human weaknesses without denying them.

Beauvois manages to draw the essential truth and beauty out of the film, and at the same time protect it from the intrusive elements that could indeed diminish its force, simply showing the closeness of their brotherhood, their willingness to understand and forgive, and their ability to reflect deeply not so much on the decision that must be taken whether to stay or to leave, but on a deep search into themselves for the heartfelt truth.  These kind of reflections and questions are not so easy to put up on the screen without troublesome exposition, but Beauvois manages to show simply and effectively how the monks find this truth in their daily routines and in the simplicity of their lifestyle. It all comes down to life and the love of life itself, and the simple pleasures that can be gained from it.",1298505600,335,2704,4.7585470085470085
4262394,5,B00450AG1Y,"An extraordinary film. Xavier Beauvois is a remarkable talent. Watching him as an actor play one despicable character after another, it is ironic to find him authoring and directing a movie that aspires to, and, in my opinion, reaches heights of spiritual epiphany. Lambert Wilson and Michael Lonsdale are both superb, as is the entire contingent of monks.  The dialogue, particularly the spiritual exhortations of Lambert Wilson in th latter half of the film, is inspirational. The Last Supper scene is Not to be missed. Set in Algeria, the film stunningly conveys the vastness of the landscape and the barrenness within which the monks tend their gardens and their Muslim community. The camera returns often to capture the beautifully austere prayers and chants in the sanctum of their abbey. One of the most affecting films I have seen this year!",1511827200,3,849,5.064285714285714

along and help one another but then soldiers come and tell the monks they must leave or risk being killed and they must decide whether
to stay or leave.  The deliberations they have are very moving.  A wonderful story about people choosing to see ""people"" instead of ""labels"".

4262397,5,B00450AG1Y,"Exquisite... it is respectful of both the story and the viewer, demanding and unusualu quakity of the viewer than in most movies, rapt attention, with the masterful poise of 'taking a breath' quiet and often times, a question or observation that otherwise may have salacious currency is instead one of restraint. The story is one also of the realities of our world where dangers cannot be wished away or kept at bay with false adages and hopes- that threat is real and inherent. One of the most simply elegant movies have ever seen, however, please, ONLY watch in French with the subtitles, it does a terrible disservice to do otherwise. The 'last supper' is poignant, wrenching, beautiful and powerful.... Hollywood and the sentient viewing public can learn much from this movie.",1501372800,,780,4.961832061068702
4262398,5,B00450AG1Y,"Eight French monks live a contented and contemplative life in a remote African village. They pray and work to support themselves, producing food both to eat and to sell at the local market. Brother Luc is a doctor who gives physical and spiritual aid to the local population, who seem to be entirely Muslim. The relations between the monks and the villagers is congenial--the monks move freely throughout the village, participate in celebrations, and chat with the locals. The line at the monastery for the clinic is always long. Local Islamic terrorist activity threatens the village and the monastery. The monks have to decide whether they will stay in the face of possible martyrdom by the Islamic xenophobes or leave the village in search of a safer life.

The drama of the story is that decision. The monks live in community, meaning decisions are often made by voting. Personal differences and preferences make unanimity hard. The local government offers protection, but will the military be a help or a hinderance to the work of the monastery? Jesus has called us to love both friends and enemies, something both hard and dangerous. The terrorists come to the monastery on Christmas eve to take the doctor to their wounded soldiers an hour away. Brother Christian (the head monk) refuses, causing a tense moment and, later, a hard discussion for the monks.

The depiction of the monks' life is beautiful. The balance between work and prayer is shown throughout. They live in simplicity and modesty. They suffer from human frailty and do their best to support one another. They serve each other and the locals with humility and grace.

The film is a quiet but powerful masterpiece.

4262455,5,B00450AG1Y,"""Of Gods And Men"" a.k.a ""Des hommes et des dieux"" is a French film that centers on the monastery of Tibhirine. During the civil war in Algeria in 1996,nine Trappist monks lived in harmony with a largely Muslim population until seven of them were kidnapped and died to unknown circumstances. It features a cast led Lambert Wilson and Michael Lonsdale. The title of the movie was taken from Psalm 82:67 that states, ""I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.""It was also loosely based on the experiences of the Cistercian monks of Tibhirine in Algeria from 1993 until their kidnapping in 1996.

This is a touching movie about a group of monks who live ordinary lives that goes through a tough test when the civil war in Algeria happened. Their faith was tested when they were kidnapped by religious extremists and they have shown they are willing to give their life for God and for self-sacrifice when religious violence occurred. It was also a good spiritual film that is compelling as it will allow the viewer to undergo self-introspection especially when it comes to their spiritual life and how much as they willing to sacrifice when it comes to God and this aspect of this life. It also deals very well with the negative effects of the hate that people have for each other due to differences in spiritual beliefs. Overall,we are treated to a good film about spirituality and religious hatred.",1433203200,,1486,4.650190114068441

4262466,2,B00450AG1Y,"I just saw Of Gods and Men. I thought I was going to love it  it is based on a true story of Trappist monks who died in the 90s in North Africa. They are peaceful, and treat the sick at their clinic, regardless of religion; hence they get criticized by the government for caring for the anti-govt rebels as well. In the end, they are beheaded in a bungled hostage deal. I thought I was going to be inspired by it.

Instead  augh  I sat there watching it, and feeling like a horrible new atheist. I kept feeling like the Abbot was an ego-driven wannabe-martyr who was emotionally manipulating/pressuring his fellow monks into dying a pointless death with him. One monk, Brother Christophe, made your heart bleedhe was younger and didn't want to die. He also seemed genuinely puzzled by why they had to dieand at one moment he asks the Abbot is this just so we can be heroes? My heart screamed, yes, yes, Christophe, get away from this scheming Abbot who wants your death for his beatification! In the end Christophe trustingly accepts the Abbots decision, for some vague religious explanation that had nothing to do with helping other people at all just being a hero. The film did not portray their motivation as concern for the local Algerians, but rather, merely the Abbots desire to be a dead hero, and his arm-twisting of his fellow monks into it through gentle religious instruction that was nine-tenths guilt trip (e.g. if you really loved Jesus.) .

And it wasn't a martyrdom of we did the right thing and got caught (e.g. hiding Jews in WWII) or even a we are backed against the wall and have no choice (e.g. refusing to start a civil war which gets you deserted by your impatient army, and then getting assassinated with nowhere to turn). Rather, this was more like a I didn't jump in front of the truckI just didn't get out of the way."" So it was passive suicide instead of active suicide. Now, if they had been taking care of someone who was sick, so they didn't leave to save that persons life.their deaths would have had a point. But instead, most of them just stick around to take care of farm animals, oh, and also tell a teenage girl that falling in love is important.

And then, in the one moment where the Abbot can actually do goode.g. when the extremist-stabber-of-15-yr-old-girls turns up to be a Nice Guy with Religious Feelings.does the Abbot try to convince him of peace and love and the gospel? Nope. He just sits around and waits to be killed. Look, if you really love someone who is violently murdering people, you would try to get them to change their ways. It isn't loving to be the codependent enabler revelling in your own heroism while making no effort to actually help real people.

I know everything I just typed in the above paragraph sounds like a new atheist. Woe is me. I don't want to feel this way, but I do.

Oh, of course the movie is extremely well done, well acted, beautiful music, beautiful cinematography, enchanting slow pace, vivid portrayal of human emotion. It just makes you want to be an atheist.

Disclaimer: This is a criticism of Xavier Beauvois' portrayal, not of any actual person. All words of criticism above is just how the MOVIE'S PORTRAYAL made me feel.

course), or Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ (2004), or go to theaters to see Hop.
Of Gods and Men is the story of a French Christian living among Muslim villagers in the mountains of North Africa in
the 1990s. They run a health clinic, harvest produce, and generally help the village with very basic necessities. When
a crew of foreign workers is massacred in a nearby town by an Islamic fundamentalist group, fear overcomes the
region. Political figures offer armies for protection, but the monks refuse. These eight monks are urged to leave by the
government, but the villagers urge them to stay. They debate among themselves, not all are predisposed to staying
under threat of death. Despite their own doubts, all slowly grow to realize that they have no choice but to stay. This
film is based on events of the Cistercian monks in Algeria leading to their kidnapping in 1996.
This film offers a gripping tale of commitment and service no matter the circumstances. There are powerful acting
performances from an ensemble of characters beautifully developed. The film does drag at times, and you wonder
why the director needs to take you through one or two scenes when sense of place and character have already been
well established, but in the end it is a moving story of loyalty that can be shaken and courage that can be disturbed.",1408406400,3,1686,4.699324324324325

The weathered hands and faces sometimes seem like a part of the landscape, and the camera lingers to allow the viewer to take in each detail.  Virtually the only music is that of their chants, which is very effective.  The faith of these men is obvious, and for Catholic viewers the familiarity of their liturgies makes for an especially powerful connection.

Those who enjoyed ""Into Great Silence"" should also enjoy this. Some violence is portrayed, as might be expected, but much of the film is quiet and reflective. Martyrs come in all temperaments, and while these monks come across as exceptionally meek, they all have steel in their backbones. Contrast them with the more boisterous martyrs in ""For Greater Glory"" and you will see what I mean. There is even quite a variance among these Cistercians: some are adamant about staying, some undecided, while others prefer to leave. And with the bad guys (Taliban-like Islamists) about to storm the gates, they can hardly be blamed. One, presumably the youngest at less than 50, first considers the option of staying as sheer lunacy. In time, however, he sees that his community's role in helping its distressed Muslim neighbors clearly outweighs any individual preference. The final vote bears this out and with that, the film draws to a close, not with fanfare, but with a profound sense of mission fulfillment. Fr. Dennis",1405123200,5,1148,4.922680412371134

4262509,4,B00450AG1Y,"The plot is fairly straightforward: a group of monks in war-torn Algeria have to decide whether to leave - and thereby ensure their survival - or stay, as their way of life has been threatened by a group of insurgents.  What gives Xavier Beauvois' film its extraordinary power is the way in which it shows how some human beings cannot be brow-beaten into doing anything they don't want to.  The monks have nothing on their side except the power of prayer and an unshakable faith in God, but they make the best of these qualities to put up stern resistance.  Compared to them, the insurgents are presented as unsubtle, believing as they do that the gun can persuade anyone to do anything.  As the elected leader of the monks, Lambert Wilson's Christian is just brilliant; his expression seldom changes, but we understand the power of his resolve.  The supporting performances are equally good, especially Jacques Herlin as Amde, one of the oldest monks who doubles up as a doctor caring for members of the community around him.  Director Beauvois makes subtle use of Gregorian chant to point up the theme of the movie.  What I particularly like about OF GODS AND MEN is its refusal to make generalizations; it does not posit Christianity as being in any way superior to other religions (e.g. Islam), but suggests instead that any religion should be a force for peace rather than a pretext for violence.",1386028800,,1401,4.764462809917355

This is a popular theme (monks) in many modern movies. However,  I could not even watch past the first scene segment.  It began with  a quotation from Psalm 81 and it looked odd on first glance. We decided to get out a couple of Bibles and read the verse for ourselves, we couldn't find the quote.  So, then I went and got out my Catholic Bible and it wasn't even in there.  How dare the church promote a blatant falsehood, a direct addition of scripture.  Your quote could be the only Bible some of the lost ever read and you failed them.  Now you might say that the quote was not an important key verse or that it was added for enhancement of the theatrics and these cases or excuses are still invalid because according to the Bible this type of sin would warrant you being stoned to death or you receiving the plagues mentioned at the end of Revelation.

As a former religious, the characters are believable because of the ordinariness of their lives, including, at times, occasional strained relationships within the monastery. The monks struggled over a period of years with the decision to leave or stay. The Algerian government wanted the monks to leave for their own safety, but these brave Christian men decided to stay and live with the daily atrocities their Muslim neighbors could not avoid, because the locals  could not leave. With all the recent negativity focused on a few Catholic priests and religious who have violated the trust and lives of those they were to serve, this story of a group of Christian priests and brothers, who willingly put their lives on the line in order to support and serve their Muslim neighbors, is a breath of fresh air.

One actor cries as he recognizes the interaction of faith, culture, and deep friendship explored on several levels.  The older monks serve the health needs of their neighbors who are of a different faith while both are caught in a war between France and native Algerians mixed with terrorists who have another faith that destruction is the way to purge their lives of the burden of exisence in a hopeless world.  The focus is on the monks as they try to walk the narrow path between the four realities: The French army trying to save Algeria for themselves, the Algerians fighting for independence, the terrorists who are hiding from both while killing them when they can, the local Islamic people who have no where else to go and no access to medicine, healing, and food that the monks provide and the monks themselves who through their comforting presence provide for everyone's needs including their own need to serve their Christian God while finding fellowship and life meaning.  The French government (they are, of course, French citizens as well as Algerians) want them to leave because the goveernment can't guarantee the monks safety (or anyone's for that matter).  So here you have the plot: he government wants them to leave, every other group want their medicins and their care and are jealous that the monks accept even the badest guys as needing their healing.  You as the audience know there is no winning way out.  But the monks find one anyway: stay committed to service, ask for God's forgiveness, and remember the sacrifice of Jesus as they contemplate the inevitability of their sacrificial demise while doing what they can to appreciate their friends and their opportunity to serve even the most destructive of human ends.  I know of no movie which has so capably shown so many needs and so much goodness all in the same script while giving the audience a chance to fit oneself into the real word of conflict and the kinds of resolution of that conflict that are available to those who strive for goodness while others practice destruction their defined enemies and themselves and maybe even the whole world ultimately.  Yes there are two monk survivors who add another dimension to this multidimentional scenario as well as the observation that no one knows who actually did away with the monks while leaving the doors of their monistary to wave in the wind of the winter leaving the viewer to feel the coldness of death,the chill of their fear,  the warmth of monks faith and the goodness of their gifts cast on the world of ignorance, selfishness, while providing a vision of the ignominy of human life with its need for purpose, vision, and faith.

There are few films this natural in progression and distilled in emotional influxes.  It isn't to say that the film isn't effecting, because it truly is (and the finale is flawlessly instilled) but there is a quiet storm brewing between the frames of this film that will take the average viewer time to decipher.  It isn't like the majority of films out there.  It doesn't capitalize off of heartbreak the way most films would.  There are no sharp outbursts of dramatized displays of emotional confliction.  Instead, we are presented with a very internalized portrayal of spiritual complexities that ultimately make a greater and longer-lasting impact than the immediate result of a well-acted crying fit.

`Of Gods and Men' bleeds naturalism.

The film tells the true story (or I should say that the film is inspired by the true story) of eight Cistercian monks who are living in Algeria during turmoil in the early to mid-90's.  After an Islamic fundamentalist group massacres a group of foreigners, fear and panic set in and the monks begin to question their moral, ethical and spiritual obligations.  Action barely escapes the confines of the monastery, as the film lingers in the dwellings of these eight men and fleshes out their conundrum.  Do they stay, do they leave, do they accept help from the army?  It all boils down and comes to a head when the insanity of the outside world infiltrates their holy ground and winds up taking them hostage.

With minimal words spoken, this breathtaking look at the intimacies of faith really settles into the heart of the audience.  It takes its time, but by the end of it all there is no denying the power and strength of every facial expression.

Xavier Bouvois wanted to make a film about the reasons behind the monks deciding to stay. They knew how dire their position was and yet continued to minister to their flock, providing, advice, comfort and medical help. They lived an almost subsistence lifestyle, selling their excess produce at the local market and living life as piously as they could.

When hostilities get closer they have to face up to Islamist extremists and their own cowardice in the face of what could be a certain, horrible, death.

This is a slow burning powerful film, which is beautifully shot and framed. The acting is superb in its understatement especially by Lambert Wilson as Brother Christian and Michael Lonsdale as Luc. It is in essence a film about faith and togetherness, the monks are all supportive of each other and that strength seems to pull them through. Even though they are democratic they have an agreed leader, but still feel at home in questioning him and it is through that process that we get to see more of who these extraordinary men were. It received masses of critical accolades even getting a 92% rating on `Rotten Tomatoes', as well as the more serious Cannes Grand Prix prize.

""Far from a Masterpiece"" says Over-educated lit junkie!

Yes, in America  we all find ourselves `over-educated'.  In one study, when asking 1000 college age young adults, 90% found themselves in the top 1% of intelligence.  In concluding, they found that those that were the most intelligent were not amongst the 90% who found themselves so very bright.  Our efforts to build self esteem in the U.S. Schools has surely proven a success, we all feel great about ourselves.  On the admonition of Ralph Waldo Emerson's ""imitation is suicide"" we are all original and our own source of truth goodness and beauty.  In the City of Man, this movie must surely be a clunker, a bore, a collosal waste of precious seconds when we could be rocking the wii just dance II or spilling a fantasy of what we would like our life to be on facebook.

This is not a movie for the citizens of the City of Man, but for the aspiring citizens of the City of God.  It is a masterpiece, and exposition of Christ's call to love God with all our hearts, minds, strength and soul and our neighbor as ourselves.  The protracted silences and seeming pauses are beautifully done moments to reflect on the profundity of this beautiful expresion of our full humanity.  I shudder at the thought f the city of man trying to love neighbors as ourselves, by exporting birth control and abortion with plastic surgery coming with the new wave of rights.  But no, we are to pick up our cross and follow Him. This movie is a beautiful example of the glory of the way of the Cross.

This movie succeeds magnificently in portraying the true essence of the 3 theological virtues of Faith Hope and Love and the difficulty we mere humans have in cultivating them.  It is one thing to espouse them by oath, and another to mean it, but still quite another to act on our oath after stating it meaningfully.  But for the Grace of God in communion with the Saints and the assent of the will such courageous love is all but impossible.

The concluding letter is a masterwork of Christological anthropological theology.  A more beautiful and sanctified letter we are not often going to come across outside of the scriptures and writings of the Doctors and Saints of Mother Church.

4262566,5,B00450AG1Y,"One film style is far more difficult to achieve than all of the others: A simple, understated naturalism that would presume to no more than honestly render a time and place. It is almost never done well, and the usual result is a mockumentary travesty. When a sincere compassion for all the suffering fomented by the encounters between Islam, Islamic fundamentalism and the good heart of Christian monks living side by side with a Muslim community is woven through the film's agenda, the odds of getting it right, of hitting all the grace notes clearly and without pretention . . . well, fulfilling such lofty intentions it is such a long shot, it almost never happens.

Regrettably for Terrence Malick, because he fares so shabbily in the comparison, the evening before, I had screened the Tree of Life, which superficially is as far distant from Of Gods and Men as one might travel on the cinematic band width. Yet oddly enough, and despite their wildly incongruous budgets, Mr. Malick's intensely moral theme is almost identical: the question being how to live a life in harmony with God while continually battered by the insurmountable contradictions of life. Pathetically enough, in this high-aiming realm, Malick's magnum opus comes off as naught but that sound and fury signifying nothing of which Shakespeare well-warned all future dramatists everywhere.

On the other hand, Of Gods and Men, among the lowest of the low-key and even lower budget films at Cannes last year, walked away with THE Grand Prix of the international film world's most intensely observed gathering, and rightly so. The scale is deceptive. It is no small film. This is the biggest movie I've seen in many a year. Everyone in the entire cast and crew deserves our profound gratitude for such exceedingly fine work wherein the end result far exceeds the sum of modest parts. 30xii11",1325289600,4,1862,4.945686900958466
4262567,4,B00450AG1Y,"I really enjoyed this deeply religous movie yet, ironically, I am not religous at all. That is how moving the story is.

""Of Gods and Men"" is the story about how a group of monks, living in a monestary, and aiding a nearby Islamic village deal with a certain threat of death because of a political climate that they cannot control. I believe it takes place in Algeria and is based upon a true story.

Due to the political instability in the area, fundamentalist Islamics (terrorists) emerge, are fighting with the current regime and start to encroach upon the monestary and village. The monestary exists purely to help out the village, especially for medical issues. As the presence of the terrorists increases, it becomes painfully obvious that the monks lives are in danger and that they must get out of the region or face perishing at the hands of these terrorists who have been committing widespread violence and murder.

Although the movie does display the war time conflict going on in the area, that is not the focus of the film. The premise of ""Of Gods and Men"" focuses on whether these monks leave, what logical reason they have for practically committing suicide and how the monks interact with each other. It is obvious to the movie viewer that these monks are doomed yet the knee-jerk reaction of ridiculing such a tragic decision is rationally explained and justified as the movie progresses and, thus, that is the beauty of the movie. In a nutshell, these monks believed that once they joined the monestary they already surrendered their life and , they are more concerned about how they LIVE as opposed to how they must inevitably die.

The director shies away from action and focuses more on the strong fraternal bonds, genuine righteousness and committment to faith. This is not a movie for everybody. Many of the scenes dwell on the monks prayers, which, upon the end of the film, illustrate that they live their life exactly how they preach. The highlight of the film is when these monks know that their days on numbered (possibly enjoying a ""last supper""), they all share a bottle of some type of liquor, listen to beautiful music and weep as they feel confident as to their tragic decision yet feel satisfied with that decision.

This is a French film with subtitles. The limitations created by the subtitles actually enhances the movie since there is no needless dialogue. As beautiful as the story is, concerning the relationship among the Monks, it's also a tragic horrro film that shows the evils that humnas commit upon each other.",1325289600,3,2557,4.789115646258503
4262568,4,B00450AG1Y,"I seem to fall between the two camps of critical reaction. The majority who feel this is a classic, great film,
or the sizable minority who call the film boring, historically inaccurate, and all surface. I lean strongly
to the positive, but I understand the complaints, e.g., being bothered that the film never really examines
how hated the French were for their earlier colonialism. That larger context is part of what makes these
Brothers targets. One passing mention is hardly enough to deal with a huge element of the underpinnings
of the story.

Exploring that would only make the Brothers seem even more brave and help us understand that they took
a huge risk just to be there even before things get 'bad'. At the same time it would make the hatred they
faced from the terrorists and the Army not just seem like random 'evil' but something that had roots.

To be clear, that hatred and violence is unforgivable. But understanding how something happened, or why
your enemy hates you is part of the path to peace. It is something these wise, well-read monks would have
known about and must have been part of their thoughts and discussions, though its largely avoided here.

I also agree that the film is slow in parts, sometimes needed to establish the rhythm of the monks' lives,
but other times getting repetitive with no seeming advantage.

In addition, besides the two main characters, the other monks are largely one-note sketches, and the
sudden turn around of those who wanted to leave - maybe the most fascinating action in the film - is
largely under explored. Some of the time spent used on repeated rituals or re-tread conversations could
have been used to deepen the understanding of those men and their heartrending confusion.

It also bothered me that those who wanted to leave are never given strong or convincing arguments.
They're almost made to seem cowardly, or 'wrong'. The film could have gone further in it's compassion
towards these men, understanding that this was a complex decision, even on a theological level. When
does God want us to martyr ourselves and when would God rather we not sacrifice the gift of life to find
a way to live to fight another day? I can think of a number of third choices between surrender and simply
running away. These men must have examined those options, but there is little sign of it here. I have no
problem with the film's conclusion, but I wish it had felt both sides presented with equal weight and
seriousness, as I assume must have happened among the real monks.

But my biggest problem is that the film's style, while inviting thought, is somewhat emotionally distancing, so
while my brain was deeply engaged, my heart was less so than I wish it was. I wanted to weep for these men
and for the world, but I found myself more caught in mind than in emotions. I believe the story was strong
enough to carry both sides.

Now, all that said, I still think, unlike many of the professional critics that raised these points, that this is a very,
very good film, made with intelligence and passion. It is visually simple but stunning to look at. Its slow pace adds
to the meditative feel that eschews inflating drama for its own sake, and allows us a taste of the peace these men
experience by living in their simple, giving way, even in the midst of war. And there are scenes of sheer brilliance,
where whole stories are told on peoples' faces with little or no dialogue. Scenes where a combination of photography
and acting capture a huge range of complex emotions. We watch fear, joy, transcendence, defeat, and loss run through
the hearts of these men within seconds of each other without a word needing to be said, That is film-making of a high order.

Ultimately, this is a film that deserves and needs to be seen. A plea for peace and courage in the face of hatred. But that
doesn't mean it isn't a flawed work, or that acknowledging those flaws dismisses those very good things the film does
accomplish.",1324080000,20,3973,4.6657142857142855

towards these men, understanding that this was a complex decision, even on a theological level. When
does God want us to martyr ourselves and when would God rather we not sacrifice the gift of life to find
a way to live to fight another day? I can think of a number of third choices between surrender and simply
running away. These men must have examined those options, but there is little sign of it here. I have no
problem with the film's conclusion, but I wish it had felt both sides presented with equal weight and
seriousness, as I assume must have happened among the real monks.

But my biggest problem is that the film's style, while inviting thought, is somewhat emotionally distancing, so
while my brain was deeply engaged, my heart was less so than I wish it was. I wanted to weep for these men
and for the world, but I found myself more caught in mind than in emotions. I believe the story was strong
enough to carry both sides.

Now, all that said, I still think, unlike many of the professional critics that raised these points, that this is a very,
very good film, made with intelligence and passion. It is visually simple but stunning to look at. Its slow pace adds
to the meditative feel that eschews inflating drama for its own sake, and allows us a taste of the peace these men
experience by living in their simple, giving way, even in the midst of war. And there are scenes of sheer brilliance,
where whole stories are told on peoples' faces with little or no dialogue. Scenes where a combination of photography
and acting capture a huge range of complex emotions. We watch fear, joy, transcendence, defeat, and loss run through
the hearts of these men within seconds of each other without a word needing to be said, That is film-making of a high order.

Ultimately, this is a film that deserves and needs to be seen. A plea for peace and courage in the face of hatred. But that
doesn't mean it isn't a flawed work, or that acknowledging those flaws dismisses those very good things the film does
accomplish.",1324080000,4,3973,4.6657142857142855

The cast is very effective and well chosen. The film portrays the lives of these monks with respect for their faith and day-to-day way of life. One of the most moving scenes is when the monks sing the ""Salve Regina"" (Hail, Holy Queen) in the solemn mode of Gregorian chant at Compline, the Night Office. In the midst of the details of everyday life, the monks are men of prayer and Christians.

4262574,5,B00450AG1Y,"This is an excellent film on a timeless subject with great acting. This is also a powerful movie dealing with the highest motivations of mankind but resulting in the contradiction in which sacrificial love so often ends. The small Catholic Cistercian group in North Africa struggles with the decision to stay on in their little community in the face of mounting violence from Islamic forces. All does not end well, and one never is quite sure who was responsible for the death of these members of a community living out their lives in service to a community not of their own faith. But here is a greater contradiction - especially in the face of the history of the growth of Catholic monastic life of Europe. In the West the monastery was founded on the love and service of God with the secondary impact of service to community it served. Indeed, history will show that the Monastic communities were the preservers and transmitters of civilization; knowledge and material assistance to those around it. These great monastic centers helped convert and then refine the Christian population around it. In this instance, the small group is serving those of a different faith and one in which the sword had always been used to convert and cleanse its own communities. In the story each member of the monastic community is faced with a decision - it is peculiar that some center on themselves instead of the higher priority of God's will but this is not unlike human decisions  - God's will is mysteriously accomplished in circumstances appearing to defeat His purposes.  Although the small band of brothers were doing their best for their neighbor - no matter how different that neighbor was from their own Faith - it still would have been a wiser choice to leave and begin anew in a friendlier place; a place where conversion and the Faith could grow. Behind the drama is the question dealing with Islam: Why do the more extreme or corrupt elements predominate if the religion is at its core ""merciful""? Well, maybe the core is not so merciful, and in that understanding might be the answer to the small community's choice - it can be looked upon as a true waste of love and sacrifice - a not so wise choice to stay.",1323043200,3,2212,4.698453608247423
4262575,3,B00450AG1Y,"This film chronicles an important historical event, and the nobility and gravity of the subject matter are undeniable. On the surface, this film examines the struggle of a group of Trappist monks who must decide whether to remain at their monastery to face terrorism or flee to their native France. On a more profound level, this film problematizes the depth of belief and conviction--the power of abstract faith--when it's pitted against very real and practical dangers. Given all that, I really wanted to like this movie. On an intellectual and philosophical level, I do--I appreciate its complexity and the importance of its subject matter. But as a work of cinematic art--as an act of storytelling--this film falls short. There is very little action to speak of, and much of the film depicts the monks in prayer, reciting religious articles, debating the strength of their conviction, theologizing, philosophizing... and contemplating the virtue of religion against the ugly reality of politics. Sadly, I was quite bored for most of the film--it's essentially a drama that's dramatized in a very undramatic fashion--through voice-overs, prayers, and debates.

Regardless of faith, or lack of faith, this was one of the most spiritually uplifting films I've ever seen. The presentation of devout Christians living in harmony with Muslims was profound by itself, and that was before everything else happens in the film. The entire production is first rate, especially the cinematography, and the veracity in every single acting performance.

4262578,3,B00450AG1Y,"Of Gods and Men is a film based on a real event in Algeria of 1996,the story of a group of Cistercian monks living in the Atlas mountains. They offer pastoral care to the villagers nearby,which includes medicines and first aid. Some of them have been there for up to 50 years,following the ejection of the French colonialist government and armed forces from Algeria. Their leader,Brother Christian,sees no conflict between the Koran and Christianity, that they should be the best of friends. The film depicts the daily rituals,routines,prayers and hymns of the group as they enact their deep beliefs. Sometimes singing to blot out the hovering of a helicopter.

Into this scenario an Islamist fundamentalist group massacres a team of foreign workers and fear sweeps through the region. The group invade the monastery one day to ask for medical help for a wounded man. They want medicines or Luc to travel with them to heal the wounded man. Christian doesn't go along with this,saying they don't have the medicines to spare and Luc is too old to travel. They declare their faith and friendly relationship with the local Muslims and the Koran. The group leave. After this the government minister and the army offer themprotection, but they decline. The tension within the order deepens as they debate whether to stay or go. Some feel by going they would be abandoning their beliefs,the monastery and the community who depends upon them. Others feel they would be like sheep to the slaughter,they didn't come to be sacrificed.

Once they decide to stay their courage gives them peace. There is a moving climax where they unite around the table in a Last Supper and listen to Tchaikovski's music. The only trouble I had with it is it doesn't dig deep enough into the complexity of the religion and politics. Who did the killing? Why only their heads were found,not bodies,maybe due to the evidence of how they were killed and by whom. In attempting to sell this to the French audience have glossed over issues for a mass market. Although beautifully paced,acted and filmed,there is a lack of depth and substance.

The monks, though devoted, show moments of fear and doubt, each individually, but remain devout in their purpose. The argument that Islam and Christians believe in the same God has never been more clearly explored. Exquisite photography, and a deliberate sense of dread prevails.  I simply can't say enough about how moved I was by the efforts of all involved. Most highly recommended.

Shot without dialogue and Tchiakovsky's dramatic, ""Romeo & Juliet"" as the score, each of them raises a glass and smiles, as if to say that soon they will all meet in heaven. Then, slowly, the smiles fade and are replaced by looks of sadness, pain and abject terror as if to say that soon they will all be dead. These are not plaster saints, but real men. Men of faith yes, but also sharing all of humanity's fears of the unknown, of death, suffering and pain. Holy people are often idealized in film or theatre but these men are truly flesh and blood.

But life finds them and they are dragged into a conflict that has nothing to do with them.  In the end they must make a decision - whether to leave their monestary or stay.  For the first time in their lives they are stripped of everything but their essence - something few humans ever experience.  This essence is the only thing between them and the abyss.  The questions they face are stark, and there is no outside guide post to assist them.  Useless notions such as bravery, and cowardice are revealed for what they really are - social constructs hardly worth considering.  There is no outside force to give their decision meaning - they are faced with the fact that they are each totally and inescapably responsible.  If they go, no one will care.

4262600,4,B00450AG1Y,"This deliberately paced, Grand Prix winner at Cannes recounts the true 1996 story of a group of French Trappist monks who lived peacefully for years in an Algerian monastery.  Doing the Lord's work in the former French colony in North Africa, ministering to the local villagers, offering spiritual, agricultural and medical aid to the grateful population, the monks are threatened by local Islamic fundamentalists, who want them gone.  Do they stay or do they go, and what are the consequences of either choice?  OF GODS AND MEN is a beautiful, reverently told tale of faith and duty in the face of fear and violence.

With its religious setting, ascetic style and Gallic tongue, OF GODS AND MEN recalls some of the work of the towering French auteur, Robert Bresson (DIARY OF A COUNTRY PRIEST, AU HASARD BALTHAZAR).  But while Bresson usually focused his unblinking cinematic eye on the spiritual redemption of individuals, director Xavier Beauvois (LE PETIT LIEUTENANT) is dealing with a religious group dynamic in OF GODS AND MEN.  One of Beauvois' great accomplishments is to have each of the monks emerge as distinct characters with their own thoughts, feelings and rationalizations about the mortal dilemma in which they find themselves.

Led by Christian, subtly portrayed by Lambert Wilson (THE MATRIX), the contemplative monks must decide whether or not to carry on their works and devotions after the local terrorists demand medical assistance following their cold-blooded killing of a group of Croatian workers in the area.  Christian refuses their request, and at that point, he and his brothers realize it's only a matter of time before the fundamentalists return.

The film then turns on a series of conversations among the men of the cloth interspersed with their everyday routines.  They are far from uniform in their opinions about putting their lives on the line by staying at the monastery or leaving while they have the chance.  Beauvois' approach to the material is quiet and reserved, reflecting the characters' lifestyle, so that the few moments of violence we do see have that much more impact.

Though the real-life incidents depicted in the film were a national turning point in France, and this film was a huge box office success, the issues Beauvois and writer Etienne Comar raise in the movie reach beyond the specifics of this particular story.  With Western nations intervening in Islamic countries throughout the Middle East and Africa, one has to question the wisdom of these actions.  Though the peaceful monks in OF GODS AND MEN are far from the military machine of the United States and its allies, one person's saviors might very well be another's infidels, there to impose outside religious or political will on the local population.  Of course, the irony is that's exactly what repressive, murderous, self-righteous Islamists are doing in the name of their God.

It's all enough to make one wonder if John Lennon had it right:  ""Imagine no religion / It's easy if you try / No hell below us / Above us only sky.""  Imagine...",1312156800,,3063,5.019762845849803
4262601,5,B00450AG1Y,"For many years and even now, the kidnapping and assassination of seven Roman Catholic Trappist monks (all of French descent) living at the monastery of Tibhirine in a Muslim area Algeria still remains a mystery.

What is known is that the incident took place during the time of the Algerian War (which lasted from 1991-2002) in which the Algerian government and Islamic rebel groups have been at war and various groups have taken responsibility.  From the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) claiming responsibility for the kidnapping and assassination to retired General Francois Buchwalter, a French military attache, who reported that they were killed in rescue attempt, beheaded in order to place blame on the GIA.

No matter what happened, one thing is fact and that these monks who were murdered remained dedicated to their faith, despite the killing and murders happening around them.  Despite having fear of what may happen to them, instead of leaving, they knew the people living near the monastery needed their help, medical assistance and look to them as a symbol of peace.

In 2006, a film was commissioned by Etienne Comar for the tenth anniversary of the incident and as a Catholic and film producer, Etienne who was fascinated by the monks, felt that their death had overshadowed by what he found interesting, the monks willingness to stay in Algeria despite the rise of hostilities.

And Etienne and filmmaker Xavier Beauvois would work together on the project, researching the material and even Beauvois would live for six days with the monks at Tamie Abbey in Savoie.  And after years of research, the script was sent to the relatives of the deceased monks and each were positive about the depiction of their loved one for the film.

In 2010, the French film ""Of Gods and Men"" (Des hommes et des dieux) directed and written by Xavier Beauvois (""House of Tolerance"", ""Meeting with an Angel"", ""The Chameleon"") would create a film focusing on the men and their faith but also focus on the breaking down of relations between the Christians and Muslims and the difficulties of the Monks had faced prior to their murder.  Would they believe in the government authorities or the Muslim rebels?

The focus of the film was authenticity and even the talents who played the monks practiced for a month for professional training of Cistercian and Gregorian chants.  As Beauvois had done at the Tamie Abbey, each actor would also spend a week living with monks and learning the lives of the men.  And each actor would have different perspectives on how they would portray their character and fit that role perfectly.

Filming began in 2009 in Moracco and the film premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival and won the Grand Prix and would later win the Lumiere Award and Cesar Award for Best Film.  The film was critically praised around the world and is noted for its powerful story, acting and the film's wonderful cinematography.

VIDEO:

""Of Gods and Men"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Picture quality is fantastic!  You can see the detail clearly on the men's faces.  Wrinkles, stubble, detail of their clothing, you name it...absolute clarity, detailed textures, just a wonderful film that showcases its PQ on Blu-ray.

Colors, especially skin tones are natural, while there is an emphasis at times of blue sand greens, black levels are inky and deep and no sign of any blemishes, scratches, banding, artifacting, etc.  The PQ is absolutely wonderful!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Of Gods and Men"" is presented in French DTS-HD MA 5.1.  The lossless soundtrack is wonderful as you can hear the ambiance of the environments around the monastery.  The birds, the insects, the leaves, the rain, the crowds near the market, you name it.  Dialogue is crystal clear and while there are sound effects such as a helicopter flying above and scenes of gun shots, the film's strength is its dialogue, the men singing their chants and the ambiance.

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes."" - Book of Psalms, Psalm 82:6-7

The following is a spiritual testament made by murdered monk Christian de Cherge if there was an occurrence of him being killed.

It was producer Etienne Comar's goal to create a film that is not so focused on the deaths of the monks but to showcase their life during the breakdown of government relations, the escalating problems between the government and the Islamic rebels and how the monks were just men who lived in peace but yet were caught in the middle.

These monks were about peace and helping those in need but yet, prior to their deaths, because of the high emotions on both sides of the Algerian war, these men were put in a predicament that as audiences witness, are the men's belief in their faith but also their emotions of man. The fear of being killed, the fear of not knowing if they should leave or stay but knowing that their presence in the area was important.  They were the symbols of peace and in the end, both sides would claim responsibility for the murder of the monks.

To create a film of faith, writer/director Xavier Beauvois spent years of research and it was his dedication of keeping things looking authentic, becoming authentic is the film's true efficacy.

The pacing of the film was masterfully done, the mise-en-scene was carefully planned, the cinematography was lush and beautiful but also capturing the monks in various emotional situations, as well as when the darkness had come at times to showcase the murder of the Croatian workers in Algeria to the eventual kidnapping and murder of the monks.

One scene features the monks in a sequence that is fitting of a ""Last Supper"", enjoying each other's company, listening to ""Swan Lake"", drinking red wine but as a viewer, you know what is to come.

""Of Gods and Men"" is wonderful cinema and perhaps will be Beauvois masterpiece.  It's a film that showcases the fine balance between cinematography, acting and directing and most of all, a wonderful drama that captures the faith of the monks without focusing too much on what would happen to them.  It's their dedication for peace even during a time when they know the worst may happen to them.  Showing a human-side that even these men, dedicated to faith, also had fear.  Watching this film, it felt real and accurate and it is no surprise that the film has achieved success.

Overall, ""Of Gods and Men"" is unique and masterfully done.  Its Blu-ray release is absolutely beautiful and even the audio quality is well-done.  Highly recommended!",1312156800,,7326,4.913008130081301

Hmmm....good question.
We have a group of monks from France who are stationed in Algeria.
When Islamic insurgents come knockin' our monks must decide if they want to stay or leave.
That's it really.
The movie is so quiet it might as well be a silent film.
At two hours I was scared it would drag.....and drag.
But it really didn't.
The acting was excellent.
The score, well....there really isn't any score except for the monks singing which is absolutely beautiful.
What really kept my interest was the cinematography. Simply stunning.
All in all a superb movie about religion, tolerance and what it really means to serve your fellow man.
Not an action or an adventure movie.
A silent and beautiful look at the good and bad humanity is capable of.

4262606,5,B00450AG1Y,"Adding my few thoughts to the many already expressed about this outstanding film.....I was wonderfully surprised at the attention my very busy 12 year old son gave this foreign film that he had to take the time and effort to read (he is a dyslexic)and not simply watch. He really appreciated the whole story and asked to see it again. The creators and actors have gifted us all with a truly fine portrayal of the lives of these men. The cast and crew capture not only the community life of these monks, (our family volunteers monthly at a Franciscan Friary in one of the highest crime & poverty stricken cities in NJ, so we have first-hand experience with the life of brothers and priests living in poverty for the sake of the Gospel and love of neighbor) but they reveal to the viewer the hidden personal Real Flesh and Blood Men that religious are! Outstanding! As a priest I know commented, ""Just because you enter an Order or take priestly vows doesn't make you an instant Saint. You are still a real man, a sinner, struggling to become like Christ. And it IS a STRUGGLE!""  This film is one that grows on you and takes shape in your heart and mind for days after viewing.
I had rented it on Netflix. Now I am buying it.
Thank you to all who contributed to the making of this work of prayer and art. Thank you for remembering these holy men who strove to Love God with all their being and their neighbor as themselves. I have already prayed to Br. Luc asking him to help be love and serve my own family with greater gentleness and mercy.",1310774400,3,1540,4.384615384615385
4262607,5,B00450AG1Y,"You have to invest yourself in the beginning of this movie in order to make it through (there is a lot of singing and praying according to the Catholic tradition throughout the movie and my version was subtitled) BUT if you do the payoff is worth it! Most are familiar with the (true) backstory of a community of monks living and working through a time of increasing terrorist violence in Algeria and their struggle to know whether to stay or go as their very lives are being threatened.

Watching each man work through his own thoughts and fears and come to a place of peace in their faith and work is powerful. This film gives you that sense of tension and fear that those living under the constant threat of violence must feel everyday AND does it without all the theatrics that most movies use to invoke emotion. It is the selective nature of the dialogue and even the scenes chosen to tell the story that give this movie an ethereal quality that somehow also burns with intensity! It is the kind of movie that leaves you sitting in your chair long after you should have hit the eject button... I highly recommend this movie!",1310428800,6,1129,4.507317073170731

4262609,5,B00450AG1Y,"Inspired by John Kiser's nonfiction book The Monks of Tibhirine, Of Gods and Men is a moving depiction of French monks living in Algeria in the tense 1990s. This film features the darker parts of human existence, including fear and despair, and yet is more about goodness than evil.

Locals invite the monks to tea and celebrations. One monk, the amiable Luc (Michael Lonsdale), is a doctor who sees a constant stream of patients and occasionally passes out clothes as well as diagnoses. The brothers take turns gardening, sometimes pausing to appreciate the scenery. The film's soundtrack consists solely of what the monks hear, which is mostly beautiful liturgical music.

Their peaceful life is threatened by terrorism and the legacies of French colonialism (mentioned only briefly). They debate whether they should leave and save their lives or continue to help the villagers and possibly die. This question is more difficult for some than others. One of the youngest, the middle-aged Christophe (Olivier Rabourdin), struggles with his faith. Even Christian (Lambert Wilson), the handsome and headstrong leader, has troubles, reaching out to nature in times of contemplation.

The characters have a deep love for one another, and both religious and nonreligious audiences can identify with the monks' search for answers and fulfillment. Characters are subtly drawn and acted. The lovely countryside is shot in natural light, reflecting the monks' inner turmoil or joy. Their simple lives are evoked in snatches rather than drawn out scenes, making the movie's pacing slow but not tedious.

Of Gods and Men is emotional but not dramatic. Its message of forgiveness comes across as neither nave nor patronizing, and its statements about tolerance in relation to Christianity, Islam, and religion in general are particularly timely. This uniquely lovely film is unsentimental but tender, gentle but powerful, and refreshing in every sense of the word.",1306108800,15,1952,5.327922077922078

The storyline is excellent.  A true story with historic events which create an intense human drama that is skillfully portrayed.

The acting is superb by every cast member.

A well-crafted script where an economy of words proves less is better when every word carries significant impact.

The cinematography is the best I recall, where each scene speaks more clearly than words.

The direction is all-inclusive of every detail, bringing the characters up-close and personal.

And the underlying allegory is superbly reflected in more than a few scenes.

To describe the movie as inspirational is of great understatement.  It is like participating in a spiritual retreat within two hours.

Of Gods and Men is the hallmark of cinema as art.  A movie worth seeing again.",1302739200,33,806,5.123076923076923
4262611,5,B00450AG1Y,"Something happens to the human heart while experiencing OF GODS AND MEN: the reminder of our responsibility to not only those we love but also to the betterment of the human condition no matter the cultural differences is overwhelming.  Would that this film could be required viewing for every global citizen! We might, just might, begin to grow not only more tolerant of other people's beliefs but embrace them as fellow beings and in doing so, end the clangorous need for war.

Xavier Beauvois both wrote (with some assistance from scenarist Etienne Comar) and directed this film that is as much a work of art as it is a deeply moving story.  The film was first released in France as 'Des hommes et des dieux' to high acclaim: hopefully it will have the same impact here in this country.  Based on a true story, the time is in the 1990s, the place Algeria during their Civil War.  A Trappist Monastery is the home of eight devout elderly monks, each performing the duties to allow them to exist off the land and serve the poverty stricken Algerian village near by.  The head of the monastery is Christian (an elegant and tender Lambert Wilson), the old physician Luc (Michael Lonsdale) serves the physical needs of the impoverished Muslim villagers, and the rest of the monks tend the gardens for food, and study, and rise each morning to begin a day of prayers and masses.  These gentle, wise old men are Christophe (Olivier Rabourin), Clestin (Philippe Laudenbach), Amde (Jacques Herlin), Jean-Pierre (Loc Pichon), Michel (Xavier Maly),  and Paul (Jean-Marie Frin). A group of terrorists crash the monastery in an attempt to get medicine and food and challenge the 'heretic' monks (the terrorists are Islamics), but the strength of the monks and the quiet faith of Christian manages to head them off.  As the radical Islamic terrorists begin killing foreigners the monks must make a decision to flee to safety or remain at their posts as nourishers of the little village they tend. The human side of the monks shows in the fear of survival , but the strength of their faith and their commitment to their people makes the decision to stay unanimous. The fact that the terrorists are Islamic is not seen as a difference in their humanity. History has already provided the ending, but the manner in which the monks are driven away from their monastery is not only desperately moving but also uplifting in the manner in which these devoted men face their fate.

Every actor in this film is an  experienced French actor and their performances defy description except to say that to the man they are brilliant.  Lambert Wilson and Michael Lonsdale are particularly eloquent. The film is in French but with little spoken dialogue: much of the film is the camera (by cinematographer Caroline Champetier) pausing on the monks at prayer, singing masses, or simply close-up face shots of these  well-worn faces. Almost every frame of this film could be a Renaissance painting.  The music for the film is limited  to the chanting and singing of masses (breathtakingly beautiful) except for a small but poignant Christmas celebration when the monks share a glass of wine from Luc and listen to an old tape of Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake'.  The simplicity of the lives of these Trappist monks, their spiritual faith, and their bonding to the villagers they serve and to each other is powerful.  Understatement rules, especially the indescribably beautiful final scenes as the story disappears into the snowy fog.  Few films will move the viewer as deeply as this miracle of a film.

""Of Gods and Men"" relates the martyrdom of Catholic monks in 1996.  On the web site of the National Catholic Register, there is a 3/9/11 review by Steven D. Greydanus, which I would highly recommend.  Greydanus calls this film ""A transcendent spiritual portrait of faith, love and martyrdom.""

To me, one of the things most striking about this film was the paplable, psychological agony of the monks, in anticipation of their eventual torturous martyrdom.",1301788800,35,614,4.990196078431373

Of all the films that I have seen, this is perhaps the most compelling and hopeful portrayal of religious faith and of good men struggling against their own humanity to do what they feel is right. It's interesting how divisive the monks' final decision is; I've read many reviewers who simply don't understand why the monks would choose to stay, and believe their decision (as portrayed in the film) was tantamount to a passive suicide. I think the film did an amazing job of explaining the monks' decision, and of showing that it was not one they came to lightly, but only after a significant period of prayer and discussion as a community. They chose to resist violence passively by maintaining their community and continuing to love and serve their neighbors. Their choice to passively resist is not that different than the message of non-violent resistance preached by Gandhi or Martin Luther King, but they chose to do it quietly, not as a political statement. It's beautiful that their sacrifice is now so widely known, and this incredible film helps to convey and commemorate the message of their lives. Every time I watch this film I feel compelled to be a better, more courageous, and more compassionate human being; I don't think there's much higher praise that can be given to any work of art.",1520640000,4,1425,4.704
