5510221,5,B00AU740H2,"This is a blu-ray two-fer of action/comedies from the folks at Mill Creek.
I really enjoyed both Hudson Hawk and Hollywood Homicide, but I enjoyed Hudson Hawk  with Brice Willis more.
But Hollywood Homicide with Harrison Ford was fun as well.
The PQ and AQ are great with this release, both are in thier correct aspect ratios.

5510223,4,B00AU740H2,"Hudson Hawk is a underrated gem. They may have spent a small fortune on the making of this movie, and the budget may not be reflected on screen, but what does remain is a fun, brainless romp. Hollywood Homicide, on the other hand, is a dreadful bore. Blu-ray picture quality on both is very good.",1367366400,,296,4.4
5510224,4,B00AU740H2,This is a good Blu-Ray Transfer I loved Hollywood Homicide very funny film that gets so much hate from people it's sad. This is not a terrible film I've seen a lot worse. This was just a fun film that both Harrison Ford & Josh Hartnet enjoyed doing. As for Hudson Hawk that was a very bad Bruce Willis film I mean damn. Get this simply for Hollywood Homicide.,1367280000,2,359,4.217391304347826
5510225,5,B00AU740H2,"this arrived 5/4/2013. i could hardly contain my self.after tea i settled down.which to watch first.i settled for hollywood homicide...harrison ford it's been a long time but after a slowish start with  them  both developing their persona's the movie started to take off.going at a fair clip of knot's chasing bad cops.gangsters. killers.until the madcap chase at the end,i was quiet breathless
but really enjoyed the journey well worth a visit.  NOW FOR SOMETHING ELSE  hudson hawk bruce willis this is black comedy at is best ably assisted by a hoard of stars danny aiello.andie macdowell (beautiful)richard e grant.sandra bernhard james coburn and a appearance by caruso.from the moment bruce steps in front of the camera its his movie to the end.with help from all of the above
they played it to the hilt. absolutely non stop.there was swearing (a lot) but the film was so outlandish it didn't matter (no little ones)
a good double but im glad i saved bruce for the second choice if you haven't  seen it where you been 5 stars",1365120000,,1030,4.829545454545454
5510226,3,B00AU740H2,"If you want to see two of hollywoods bigget bombs in the last 20 years on one blu ray then this is for you. The picture on all these double releases are great too.  A bomb is a film the studio spent alot on but hardly made any money back on. Hudson hawk is a infamous movie in that regard a musical spy movie! It's so bad that few people could image it. bruce willis is the star here , along with screen great james coburn. It's a bizaare movie and it had a high budget to boot. This movie is truly bad by almost everyones opinion as far as a list movies go. But bombs have their charm for movie fans.  The next movie drove josh hartnel from the a list to b list actors. It wasn't his fault though , it's a bad cop movie that has tons of rap songs on it. Most people are not fans of bad rap music and few harrison ford fans go to see his movies filled with a rap soundtrack. This is just a average movie but people walked out in droves due to the soundtrack. Until this  jh was a rising star , and now he's fallen even from the b list sadly. Harrison Ford, like bruce willis survived this disaster , and this was a clunky movie in many ways. remember these were a list movies and not horror movies which have low budgets and their own standards. Still if you want two bombs that do have some charm in some ways then this one is for you and the pictures look great!",1358467200,3,1364,3.9708029197080292

5510228,5,B00AU740H2,I'm glad to see Hollywood Homicide on bluray. That's why I bought it. I'm a huge Harrison Ford fan and I'm still waiting around for a few of his films to make it on bluray. When I saw this I knew I had to jump on it.,1462147200,,216,3.617021276595745

It is not a movie for everyone; pretty much one of those vanity movies, but still seems like it should have gotten a 5.1 treatment for Blu-ray.

5510234,4,B00AU740H2,"Fun movies at a great price! I enjoyed both and glad to own them.  Hollywood Homicide is an action comedy starring Harrison Ford & Josh Hartnett as LAPD detectives investigating the murder of a rap group. Kind of an offbeat film for Ford, but his star power saves this film, which is basically a popcorn flick and not meant to be taken very seriously. Same with Hudson Hawk, starring Bruce Willis. It's a fun popcorn picture which has a similar theme, tongue in cheek action comedy.  I enjoyed both.",1447545600,,499,4.595505617977528

5510240,5,B00AU740H2,"Amazing!
I saw ""HUDSON HAWK"" upon its theatrical release. I suppose I didn't recognize it for BEING a dramedy-farce.
I thoroughly---indeed---enjoyed BOTH of these movies. Just remember that you CANNOT, actually, fly a
several-hundred-year-old glider; or, jump out of a three story building, land on the sidewalk and walk away,
unharmed.
""HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE"" didn't feature the kind of music I like---rap DOES rhyme with crap though---pre-
ferring Jimi Hendrix and ZZ Top, I just cranked up my 5.1 Bose Surround System and that ""music"" blended
in with the gunshots and automobile chase accident noises.
All-in-all, I'd've GLADLY paid three-times what I paid for this excellent double-bill!
HIGHLY recommended!",1426118400,3,708,5.564814814814815

5510249,4,B00AU740H2,"Bought it for Hudson Hawk, was pleasantly surprised by Hollywood Homicide.

Hudson Hawk is an underrated film. Maybe that type of humor just didn't work for people, but that's their fault, not the films. Way better than a guilty pleasure, Hawk is one of the best caper films of all time.",1406592000,,287,4.627450980392157

5510252,4,B00AU740H2,"This is a review for the Hollywood Homicide Bluray Transfer.

Video:
 The Video transfer is actually quite nice.  Reading the specs on the back and being a combo, I figured not a lot of time would have gone into this transfer, but as I hadn't owned the movie already, I figured I wouldn't really be losing out.  From start to finish the image is crisp, only on a couple of shots did the picture look slightly out of focus, and I do mean slightly and only a couple times.  The Video looked fantastic, everything looked well lit, the black levels looked good.  I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary while watching this.  Nothing stuck out like they missed something or didn't do a great job when transferring it to HD quality.  I didn't see any noise either which was nice, not not really expecting to see any but some transfers do tend to show a little from older movies from time to time.  Over all I liked this transfer a lot.

Audio:
  This is 5.1 DTS with multiple languages.  From where I normally have my surround volume set, I had to turn down a little.  Everything was nice and clear, used all 5 speakers respectively.  With enough gun shots, and an explosion or two, you would hope they would utilize it nicely, and they succeeded.

If you like the movie and looking to upgrade, this is a great deal.  Though I haven't watched other movie, and not sure if it interests me.  This is a great transfer, and not having it in my collection already made it an added bonus.  If you don't have it and liked it or are a fan of Harrison ford or josh Hartnett, well this could be a pleasant surprise for you.",1384128000,2,1612,4.348993288590604
5510253,5,B00AU740H2,"I don't care so much for Hollywood Homicide, but I have always loved the greatly underrated and hilarious Hudson Hawk.  The timing sequences are great, and combined with the dolphin laugh are worth the price alone.  The critics hated this film, but everyone I know who's seen it (but one) found it hilarious.  It's not deep, and it doesn't pretend to be.  It's just a fun ride.",1384041600,2,377,4.582089552238806
5510254,1,B00AU740H2,"There is a bad monosound on both films. Even though they are presented ind Dolby Digital and DTS.
