8332097,1,B001P4Q3D8,"Bad movie. Poor script, poor acting, poor directing, and even worse sound. At one point an old timer tells a kid to ""Go back into the motel."" This is a Western set in 1874. The word 'motel' was not invented until sixty years later. The actor should have said, ""Go back into the house.""",1357948800,,285,4.296296296296297
8332098,1,B001P4Q3D8,"I SEE SOMEONE WHO WATCHED THIS SAID THAT THE ACTING WAS OK I MUST HAVE MISSED THAT LINE. SOMEONE ELSE SAID THAT THEIR COPY THE TRANSFER WAS BELOW AVERAGE MINE WASN'T BUT IF IT HAD BEEN IT MAY HAVE GOT ME TO TURN IT OFF. THE SOUND ON THE COPY I BOUGHT NOT FOR THE LOW PRICE OF AROUND THREE DOLLARS BUT FULL PRICE WAS RECORDED SO LOW THAT THE REMOTE WAS FOREVER GOING UP AND DOWN AS SOME PARTS OF IT WERE BARELY AUDIBLE BUT THAT ALSO WAS AN ADVANTAGE AS THE ACTING IF IT COULD BE CALLED THAT WAS PATHETIC. LORENZO HAS MADE QUITE A NUMBER OF B GRADE MOVIES BUT TO APPEAR IN THIS HE MUST BE REALY DOWN AND OUT. ITS A SHAME AS I LOVE WESTERN BUT THIS, HELL JUST WATCH IT AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I AM ABOUT.

Could not watch the whole thing... bad acting and just bad everything.

Pass on this one.",1258502400,6,167,4.1875
8332100,1,B001P4Q3D8,"Good script about a sheriff in a small western town determined to bring to justice a serial killer determined to get his hands on a horde of gold supposedly kept in a safe located inside a former prison now used as an institution for mental cases.  Mediocre acting, but enjoyment of the movie is largely spoilt by the extremely poor DVD transfer, at least on the disc I received.  The audio was so unintelligible at times I had to bring on the subtitles and gunshots sounded like fire crackers popping.  Daylight scenes are often so dark one simply cannot see into the shadows.  Increasing the brightness on your display is of no use, since the following scene may then look washedout.  So, buyer beware!",1255305600,5,704,4.645161290322581
8332101,5,B001P4Q3D8,"Well acted, holds your interest and has a surprise twist.  Waiting for the sequel to the cliffhanger.",1238803200,4,101,4.9411764705882355
