Pretty basic movements nothing ""awesome"" I guess it works for students The therapist should have done a whole body massage at the end camera guy could have gotten a little closer to see it up close as well",1283904000,2,303,4.333333333333333

8350088,5,B0023W65EI,Received the product very quickly.  It's a very helpful DVD.  Shows how to work on certain areas of the body and also includes techniques that will help you apply more pressure without hurting your hands.,1265328000,4,204,4.8
