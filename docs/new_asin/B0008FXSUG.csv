2259134,5,B0008FXSUG,"I just saw ""Brother to Brother"" on PBS as part of its Independent Lens series.  What a well-written, mature, thoughful film Rodney Evans has made!  Perry is such a real and developed character.  His relationship with Bruce Nugent is the foundation of the film.  Throughout the second half, Bruce takes Perry back in time to the Harlem Rennaisance.  Bruce's literary and artistic peers from that era come to life, allowing Perry to see the life that Bruce knew then and the reality that he knows now.  The relationship is sensitive without being overly sentimental...Bruce teaches and Perry learns and they are both the better for it.  Perry's final act of friendship to Bruce will bring tears to your eyes and will remind us all how the most meaningful relationships can come from unexpected origins.",1119052800,5,800,4.925373134328358
2259135,5,B0008FXSUG,"Rodney Evans has created a wondrous little independent film, that sort of film that is born out of insight, devotion, research, and passion for the story.  This is a fine work of art on every level from the research, writing and directing by Evans to the consistently superb cast.

The Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s was a period during which African American artists bonded and overcame a doubting world to produce some of the finest work of the past century.  Some artists of that period and the years following included Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Wallace Thurman, Bruce Nugent and (stretching the time frame a bit) James Baldwin and Malcolm X.  But the driving force of the intelligentsia of Black America was solidified by the first four who managed to be proudly Back, write about the taboo gay aspects of the community, and come together in the Journal FIRE! produced by the brilliant Thurman.

The film opens in contemporary times with Perry (Anthony Mackie) as a young gay artist, disowned by his family for his sexual preference, living in Harlem as a painter while supporting himself by working for a Homeless Shelter.  Perry's friend Marcus (Larry Gilliard, Jr) is a poet and a firm supporter of Perry and even is supportive of Perry's involvement with a white young man Jim (Alex Burns) who becomes his mate.  Perry thrashes about his homophobic environment, struggling with oppression and artistic block, until he encounters an old man at the Shelter who happens to be Bruce Nugent (Roger Robinson), a giant of a poet from another era.

Nugent informs Perry about the same issues of being black and gay that he had during the Harlem Renaissance and this is done through a series of effective black and white flashbacks where we meet the young Bruce (Duane Boutte), Lankston Hughes (Daniel Sunjata), Wallace Thurman (Ray Ford), and Zora Neale Hurston (Aunjanue Ellis) along with clips of the real James Baldwin, Malcolm X etc.  It is this circle of continuity, relating historical social problems and artistic successes between the old and the present Harlem, which brings this film such resonance.  The bond of brotherhood as personified by Perry and the older Bruce is pure magic, especially as portrayed by Mackie and Robinson.

The DVD includes a wonderfully informative commentary by Rodney Evans which is a stimulus to watch the movie again immediately.  The film has message, style, class, and quality that make it one of the finer films about class, gender, and racial dichotomies and how very wasteful those prejudices are.  Highly Recommended.

2259136,5,B0008FXSUG,"Brother to Brother isn't a film so much about a young black gay man coming to terms with his sexual identity as it is more precisely  a story about a young black man who inspite of the prejudices against him for being black and gay manages to live life and create art on his own terms without fear and shame and the bowing down to prejudices of a hostile world that expects him to conform to a stereotype and fetish to others peoples ideas.

As the story begins, Perry (Anthony Mackie) has already been thrown out of his father's home for being gay and has just had a heated discussion with another classmate during Lit class after volunteering  information that a black male literary legend from the past was gay.  This classmate of Perry's represents a segment of the black community hostle to the idea that black gay men do exist and are sometimes unwelcomed.  Balancing out this hostile classmate is Perry's long-time straight friend, Marcus (Larry Gilliard) who kinda goes against the popular notion that every person of African decent is a homophobe.  He is dependable and supportive, but he does not quite understand where Perry is always coming from when he talks about the ill treatment of some ""brothers"" but he can understand the obstacles Perry is facing as a black artist in the artworld who much like the world of publishing is often both intentionally and unintentionally prejudiced (!). All this and Perry beginning a brief relationship with a white peer who may have a kinda of fetish thing for black guys.

In walks a figure from the past, a ""black"" undiscovered gay hero of the Harlem Renaissance, Richard Bruce Nugent (the great Roger Robinson) who teaches Perry that every thing he is now dealing with in his life were the same issues face by a group of talented young black writers of 1920's Harlem Renaissance heyday.  Nugent tells stories that bring to life the whirl of days of Niggerati Manor and its inhabitants like Langston Hughes (Daniel Sunjata) who was black and proud and celebrated black beauty long before the black protest movements of the 1960's and in whose coded poems sometimes celebrated the love, ""Beauty,"" and admiration of one black man for another black man,Zora Neale Hurston (Aunjanue Ellis) whose talent and charisma is capture well in the film, Wallace Thurman (Ray Ford) who was gay and possessed of an surperior intellect that rivaled anyone past and present and black and white, and of course Nugent himself as a young man (Duane Boutte) who was talented but refused to deny his identity and make the same sacrifices Langston Hughes did to become a well known writer and the Dean of Black American Letters. Through Nugent, Perry learns pretty universal thems as believing in yourself, not compromising your vision and integrity to cater to someone else's idea of how they think things should be done, and self pride despite prejudices.

I am happy Rodney Evans made this movie his way without compromising his beliefs and values to do it.  From such a small budget to make the film came a movie rich in texture and meaning, especially with the absence of gay men of color often being ignored in the media, mainstream and mainstream gay, baring the ocassional tokenism of a mouthly gay magazine and film.

In Makie, Robinson, Sunjata, Ellis, Ford, and Boutte and Rodney Evans's care and skill, I saw my face and its inherent beauty that is often denied. That was nice!!!",1112227200,29,3421,4.791171477079796
2259137,3,B0008FXSUG,"This film is about a young black gay man who meets Richard Bruce Nugent, the first African-American to publish a fictional story on homosexuality. The film is pretty and a great effort for a first-time director. However, folks in the audience were furious. In this film, every black gay character has a white lover. Viewers were non-plussed by the interracial coupling, but they viewed the lack on ANY black gay couples as problematic. The movie implies that a defining trait of being black and gay is to have a white partner. In this film, blacks can be friends, pro-gay allies, or homophobes, but they never love each other romantically. This film is set in New York City where there are countless black gay male couples. This film was wrongly titled ""Brother to Brother."" It should have been called ""Black Man with White Man"" because that was the coupling which the movie focuses on and celebrates. Brother who love brothers don't exist here.",1112140800,21,945,4.839506172839506

Being a white man, I found it hard to follow lots of the sub-plot especially in the middle that went from color to black and white to color again ( maybe it was the editing or even the script ) and with too much of the F-word used for the black street guy reality but the highly emotional screen play kept me loving the main character and his old man side kick to the end! Beautifully emotional and gut wrenching for the finish. I loved this movie but had to cut off one star for TOO MANY F-Bombs.

2259216,4,B0008FXSUG,"I was completely captivated by this low-key indie about Perry Williams, a gay black college student navigating his various relationships and forging his own identity as an artist, an African-American, a homosexual and a man. After being thrown out by his parents, landing his first group show and embarking on a doomed sexual relationship with a (straight, white) friend, he meets Richard Bruce Nugent, a destitute elderly man who turns out to have been a central figure in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920's. Nugent's fascinating story is told in B&W flashback sequences juxtaposed against the various tribulations faced by Perry in the present day. Beautifully acted (particularly Roger Robinson's Nugent) and sensitively written. Refreshing to find a film that gives equal time to two different minority groups, highlighting the similarities in the issues they face. Plus, Anthony Mackie's doe-eyed Perry is utterly radiant.",1204502400,,929,5.458333333333333
2259217,5,B0008FXSUG,"Wow, I had heard about this extraordinary and eloquent film from a friend and certainly wished that I had not delayed so long in seeing it. My very open minded Mom who unfortunately died September 07 would have been as moved by this exquisite film as she was by the other gay themed films I had watched with her such as ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Cowboys and Angels"", ""The Sum of Us"" and ""The Adventures of Felix"".

I can certainly understand the frustration of some who complain that the black gay male characters in the film seem drawn exclusively towards white boyfriends or prospective lovers, HOWEVER, I do think they are overlooking the fact that the most meaningful relationship in the film, although not sexual, is between a young gay black man, and an an older gay black man. The more mature gay man who defends himself by referring to himself as ""Legendary"" when confronted with the description of being ""Elderly"" is truly an oasis in the desert for this starved young man. This young man of course has encountered a very cruel reality so often a part of being gay in the USA. His horrendously homophobic father catches him with another boy in his room and ejects him from his house and his life. This ""Legendary"" man comes along, who of course is not a fictional character but patterned after the very real Bruce Nugent, who is down on his luck, and living in a shelter where the young man works while attending school. He is so much better a role model for this young man, who could have easily given up and taken his life in a weak moment given the rejection of his family. There are some cute moments of playful flirtation on the part of Nugent towards the boy, but it is not at all threatening. The young man soaks up the experience of the older man and learns so much from him. It is so sad our society for the most part does not revere the elderly as the young man in this film does, the elderly have so much to impart on the young but our culture with its obnoxious
values, it's obsession with youth and beauty and money, does little to encourage these kinds of relationships.

I felt that the blending of black and white reflecting those Harlem Renaissance days with modern day New York City in full color was flawless and fascinating. The editing was perfect.
These brave men such as Nugent are part of the reason we have our freedoms today. They dared to be themselves at a time not known for it's enlightenment. They paved the way for us.

Anthony Mackie was magnificent in the role of the young man who is the main character. I found it interesting that the director wanted him for the part of the straight male best friend and Mackie wanting to stretch as an actor, informed the director he was only seeking to play the lead.
This took much courage on the part of Mackie, who it is emphasized by the director, is not gay, to take on this challenge. I'm certain he found out who his true friends in life were when he took this role. We all remember how risky it was for an actor back in the 80s to play a gay part, it could destroy their career, so fortunately times have changed.
I thought it was gutsy for Russell Crowe to play gay back in the early 90s in ""The Sum of Us"" and he is such a brilliant actor he made us all believe he was truly gay. I thought Mackie handled this so beautifully and now want to  see "" She Hate Me"" and his other films. It must be wonderful for young gay people to see this film where the gay guy is portrayed as an articulate black man who is certainly a winner, while a straight black male classmate who is threatened by the main characters sexuality, comes off as abusive, immature, and obnoxious, and I was not surprised that his fury would lead to his being part of a ""fag bashing"" scene. He is a total coward and a wimp hiding behind his hooded sweatshirt while his buddies beat up the young gay man.

Also excellent were Roger Robinson as the present day Bruce Nugent, and
Duane Boutte, as the younger Nugent enjoying the Harlem Renaissance. I thought the scene where you see the fatasy the older Nugent has of approaching a handsome and sexy young black man who is seated waiting for a subway train  was excellent. On screen the younger Nugent makes the advance offering to paint his portrait, and the picture goes back and forth from black and white to color. There is no risk as it is only in the imagination of the present day Nugent, so we forgive the fact that it seems a bit far fetched that the stranger is so charmed by the approach, especially when he is seated alongside two other men. I am not aware of having seen either Robertson or Boutte in other films but will keep and eye out for them. They are also very credible as the same person.

I must also finally commend the skills of the director Rodney Evans who did a wonderful job giving birth to this amazing film. He had a vision in his head and it obviously took lots of hard work to get this done. I enjoyed the special feature where he explained all that was involved and the process. I understand he is a new director so I will be watching to see where his path takes him. I was fascinated when he spoke of showing this film to an audience of students who initially expressed blatant homophobia and outrage and how those sam kids stayed with it, and by the end he had won them over and they viewed the gay character sympathetically. He felt there outrage may have been in part due to the fact the main character was not a obvious stereotype which they could have dismissed as a clown, but he resembled them. He was masculine, and was a cool brother.

One last thing before I close  the MUSIC was phenomenal,it just went perfectly with the film. It just drew you in an created a wonderful atmosphere. I can certainly see why this film drew the praise and the awards it did. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has an open mind and an open heart, it made me cry, it is so touching and I can't find fault  with any of it!!!!",1195776000,3,5957,4.353735373537353

Surely, this feeling sustains an intense urge to watch the NY-shot movies in which as much New York City as possible. It is definitely being shared in common by millions NYC admirers worldwide, and a very beginning of the movie does gratify viewers and from a very start scores a positive credit by gradually dismantling a panoramic picturesque icon of The Big Apple seen through a window of a Bronx-bound D-train approaching Manhattan via Brooklyn Bridge.

From a DVD black-and-brown jacket's summary prepared to see a next story of an American boy coming on age - usually, drugs, fighting, possible shooting, bad-good girls, some sex and car driving madness, - was surprised by a real context of a story about an art college student coming out of closet, searching the right man, while befriended by a mature at the time locally prominent impoverished writer having suddenly passed away in his room.

Enchanted with homoerotic romantics, this sad cheerful tale differs very much from of contemporary NY films such as, for instance, an anti-AIDS musical ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rent-Fullscreen/dp/B000E1YW0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rent (Fullscreen)</a>"", near classical ""only in America"" TV serial ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City-The-Complete-Series-Collector-s-Giftset/dp/B000ASDFJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City - The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)</a>"" and even W.

But what is their connection, to life in the 1920's, to life in Harlem, and their role in the pre-Civil Rights Movement? And what is their role to us today? Rodney Evans' inspiring independent picture, ""Brother to Brother"" atttempts to answer that question.

Anthony Mackie plays Perry, a young, gay, black artist struggling to find his place in this world and his own community. Supported unconditionally by his best friend Marcus and another friend Jim, Perry spends the early part of the film wandering around, seemingly going through the motions, but unsure of the meaning behind it all. Then he meets Bruce Nugent, an aging artist and writer, who attempts to guide Perry through this tricky path of self-discovery. In doing so, Bruce illuminates his life back in the 1920's, in Harlem, during the grand renaissance when blacks, unprecendentally, began to blossom in all areas.

The film is the most effective in these moments of flashback, an oft-overused convention that works very well in this film. As Bruce tells his stories, we see parts of Harlem, and the people who worked to buck conventions in trying to produce art that accurately reflected their authentic experience. The actors playing the main people of Bruce's social set are incredible, from Daniel Sunjata  who plays Langston Hughes to Aunjanue Ellis who captures the zeal and life of Zora Neal Hurston. It is baudy, risky, and works to great effect. As we see Perry affected by these stories, we, as an audience, are also equally affected. This definitely has all of the hallmarks of an independent film,  adding a rawness of realism to the story.

Rodney Evans first work is a promising, affecting tale, one that reaches beyond race lines, and will land deftly into your heart. Soon after watching ""Brother to Brother"" I found myself on Amazon, looking at the works of these people and ordering them for myself. You will too, as well as wanting to add this treasure of a movie into your collection.",1124755200,18,2046,4.936046511627907

2259257,4,B0008FXSUG,"""Brother to Brother"" packs a lot of ambition into its compact running time. Director Rodney Evans has interwoven the modern-day story of Perry, a young gay African-American artist (Anthony Mackie) living in New York, struggling to find love and a sense of identity, with nothing less than a brief film history of the birth of the Harlem Renaissance literary movement, with its seminal figures Langston Hughes, Wallace Thurman, Zora Neale Hurston and Bruce Nugent shown in black-and-white flashbacks. An aged, destitute but still witty and unbowed Nugent (Roger Robinson) befriends Perry in the present and becomes his touchstone.

""Brother to Brother"" is perhaps at its best in the flashbacks, which vividly capture the excitement and sense of limitless possibility that briefly existed for Nugent and his compatriots as they founded the radical literary journal ""Fire!"" They make one want to know more about these people. The present-day narrative has its virtues as well, shedding light on the special problems of gay African-Americans as well as the struggle to maintain one's artistic identity and integrity. The frankness with which male/male sex is treated, without prurience or heavy guilt, is most welcome. Curiously, as another reviewer has mentioned, however, the couplings shown almost exclusively involve black with white men, which undercuts the film's contention that black gay men should celebrate their uniqueness. Moreover, Evans' protagonist has too many issues to contend with--homophobic parents and classmates, trying to make a living as a painter, boyfriend troubles--for everything to fit comfortably within the short allotted time. Finally, it must be said that an actor with greater emotional range than Mackie may have been able to bring out more facets of Perry, who too often seems merely a handsome, glum cipher. Still, despite its flaws, ""Brother to Brother"" succeeds at illuminating corners of the human experience long neglected in mainstream filmmaking, and for this certainly merits praise.",1121558400,22,2024,5.487179487179487
2259258,5,B0008FXSUG,"I bought this DVD with some trepidation as some of the reviews I had seen had been less than complimentary on the whole. But I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did I find the movie deeply engrossing and highly entertaining, I also couldn't fail to be moved by its (in my view) huge historical/cultural significance.

Anthony Mackie was truly mesmerizing... and achingly beautiful to watch. Just the kind of black gay character I'd been yearning to see on screen all my adult life. He played the part with absolute conviction and, thankfully, he did this while managing to completely avoid any of the grotesque and stereotypical caricatures that we see oh so often, in so many other gay parts. I felt he played the part with a quiet and honest dignity, and showed us a talented, young black gay man who just wants to live and love. I have no doubt that many black gay men will identify with him. He is us and we are he.

The director made a point of stating Makie's heterosexuality in one of the bonus pieces but I feel his real sexuality is irrelevant. Straight, gay or in between, he's a young, black, American actor with (no doubt) a long and successful career ahead of him. Taking on this role showed courage on his part and I take my hat off to him. Denzel and Will, take note.

Roger Robinson was a joy as well. I'd not seen either he or Mackie prior to this and will be going in search of other works by these actors almost immediately. ""She Hate Me"", which I had hitherto avoided, and ""Million Dollar Baby"" are first on my list.

I was also pleased to see Larry Gilliard, Jr and Lance Reddick in this movie. After two seasons of ""The Wire"" (still waiting for season three on DVD), I feel like they're family. Great actors both of them.

The end was very poignant and the Langston Hughes poem that accompanied it, very fitting. I cried. And yes, it was unfortunate that all the black gay characters in the movie seemed keen on white men only. In the light of Marcus's ""evil white men"" rants, this aspect of the movie, not to mention Marcus's later attempts to pimp Perry off to a (white) Soho art gallery owner, seemed rather contradictory but all in all, I thought the points around the issues of interracial relationships had been well made. I look forward to future works by the director and all his leading actors (male and female).",1119312000,48,2344,4.492957746478873
2259259,5,B0008FXSUG,"I had the pleasure of viewing this film on PBS, as part of their ""Independent Lens"" series, and I truly can say is that it is moving beyond words. It is superbly written, directed and acted. Rich in heart, thought, and wit, Rodney Evans's fictional work undoubtedly does justice to the art, intellectual ancestry and the strength of perseverance in the face of social injustice. Both an artistic and political achievement, ""Brother to Brother"" offers a rare glimpse of what it means to be a black, gay artist today as well as during the Harlem Renaissance, and marks Evans as a brave and unique voice in American cinema. Perry Williams is a talented young artist working and studying in New York. Art world success is knocking at his door, but Perry is afraid of selling out to a white privileged world. At the same time, community and family support is elusive as he endures homophobic barbs from his black classmates, rejection by his father, and a disappointing shallow relationship with his handsome white lover. Then Perry meets Richard Bruce Nugent, a living relic, who was a poet and painter of the Harlem Renaissance, along with Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Wallace Thurman. Surreal narrative turns land him in the middle of scandalous parties and dinners in 1930s Harlem, and Perry learns that his struggle is not new and what is most important is a strong self-image and a commitment to preserve truth and nurture his artistic spirit. Thank you, Mr. Evans, for your strength of character and undeniable power to give voice to such a profound blend of Fact and Fiction.",1119139200,5,1589,4.845588235294118

8056099,5,B0008FXSUG,"Nine Things About the Film ""Brother to Brother""

1. This is perhaps the best movie I've seen on the intersectionality of race and sexual orientation.

2. It's about an openly gay black art student named Perry who works in a homeless shelter. While there, he meets an old man named Bruce Nugent. The young man and the old man strike up a friendship, and compare the struggles of being black and gay in the 1920's to what it was in the early 2000's.

3. The movie is kind of a history of the Harlem Renaissance. Bruce Nugent was a real person; while many gay people participated in the Harlem Renaissance, Nugent was one of the few who were openly gay.

4. Through Nugent's character, we get a feel for what the Harlem Renaissance was like. About half the movie is told in black-and-white flashbacks of 1920's Harlem, where black artistic icons such as Langston Hughes, Aaron Douglas, Wallace Thurman, and Zora Neal Hurston all come to life.

5. Anthony Mackie plays Perry. This movie was made in 2004, so Mackie was still a decade away from becoming the Marvel superhero, Falcon. He won several awards for this brave and open portrayal of a young man who tries to not only raise the racial consciousness of his white peers, but the gay consciousness of his black peers - while also trying to find a boyfriend. I've seen about a dozen of Mackie's movies, and this is probably his best performance.

6. Instead of contrasting the black and gay experiences of Depression-Era America to today's culture, the movie focuses on the parallels.

7. There are some great scenes that call out white gay men and their unconscious racism. There are also some great scenes that call out straight black men and their more conscious homophobia.

8. I learned more about the Harlem Renaissance in this 90-minute movie than I did during all of my years in school.

9. Whether it was on accident or on purpose, this movie was kept on the cinematic down-low, and that's a shame. This is an important piece of the American experience, and the type of story that doesn't get told nearly as often as it should.",1457654400,,2086,4.616216216216216
