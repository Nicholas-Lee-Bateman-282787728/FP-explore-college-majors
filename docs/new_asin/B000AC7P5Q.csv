2384528,2,B000AC7P5Q,"Having just seen Anthropophagus: The Grim Reaper on DVD for the first time, I was hoping for a lot more gore. But I didn't get it. I have no idea why this movie was banned so much. It's not that gory. Even uncut, it isn't that sick or terrifying. Just a little creepy. In fact, the gore scenes that are here are really not that great. Even the one where the ripper rips a fetus from a woman's womb and eats it isn't really all that disturbing. The fetus was just a dead rabbit the producers bought at a butcher's shop. This film had a real bad reputation when it debuted, but, watching it today, I really don't know why. It's no big deal. George Eastman, the guy who played the weird cannibal, moves about like a really slow zombie. Except for his complexion, he's hardly a threat. Or at least, he shouldn't be. The people in the film he catches and kills must be really stupid if they let a slowpoke like him get to them.",1143936000,3,922,4.214689265536723
2384529,3,B000AC7P5Q,"...ok, this was a huge disappointment.  The movie started kinda slow, now that should not matter, if it had picked up aand made up for it in the end, but it didn't.  The first time I started watching it put me to sleep, for over an hour nothing really interesting caught my attention.  So I decided to finish watching it two days later and still was unimpressed.  I gave it three stars thogh because the DVD presentation alone deserves some credit.  The cover looks cool, and it comes with an extra DVD of special features.  The Joe D'Amato documentary is interesting enough to make up for where the film lacked.  Overall I was not impressed with this film, there were two memorable scenes, but that is it.  I'd recommend this as a rental, if you can rent it anywhere.  I would only recommend buying it if you are into these types of movies and you absolutely have to have it in your collection, which was my case.",1143590400,2,914,4.425149700598802
2384530,5,B000AC7P5Q,"Really suspensefull...Not for GORE Hounds but it does have it's moments. Following in mystery and who done it as other Italians, this is not for the faint at heart...Give it a look. I have the two disc and extras are very interesting and informative.",1143504000,2,250,4.704545454545454
2384531,4,B000AC7P5Q,"If you're like me, you've had to view this film via crapola vhs copies called The Grim Reaper.  It's funny how Italian horror films used excessive gore over the U.S. to get an edge on their films, yet this edge was always edited for American release, leaving the film rather pointless.  Thankfully our buddies at Media Blasters decided to take this one on.  You knew it was only a matter of time before someone did.  It's more or less the same film I remember with a few bits of bloodiness thrown in.  It seems like almost every Italian horror film is known for some notorious gore scene, whether it's a splinter in the eye, a woman being hung by hooks in her breasts or vomiting up their intestines.  Anthropophagus is known for the fetus eating scene.  This scene consists of George Eastman strangling a pregnant woman while reaching inside her and pulling out her baby, which he then takes a bite out of in front of it's father.  In realistic terms, this is probably the most vile act a human could do, but for some reason it comes off as a little more comical than anything.  Plotwise, this seems like an Italian stab at a slasher film.  Tisa Farrow(from Zombie of course) meets up with a group going out on a boat, and convinces them to give her a lift to an island community she's supposed to be visiting.  Upon arrival it looks alike everyone's gone, and the group investigates only to get slaughtered by ""The Grim Reaper"".  The Reaper is in fact, Italian regular George Eastman.  Why is he doing all this?  You're just gonna have to watch.  You don't see much of him til the final act, but he actually does look creepy.  Surely not the kind of guy you want to find standing on your doorstep at 2am.  The structure of the movie is much like a slasher flick.  The first hour consists of alot of investigating, false scares, and rotten attempts at character development.  Things don't really kick into gear til the last half hour.  I didn't really find it boring though, there was enough junk thrown  at me to keep me tuned in.  Aside from the aforementioned famous scene and the killer's demise, it's not too much of a gorefest.  Joe D'Amato actually tries to be suspenseful, and succeeds moderately at one or two points.  Media Blasters did a fantastic job with the picture, but apparently the audio is beyond total salvation.  The dialogue is kinda muffled at times, so you might find yourself cranking the volume during talking scenes(not that the dialogue is of the least bit important), and having to turn it down when the scene changes and the volume is now mind shattering.  There's a couple of cool features on the 2nd disc, but like with most 2 disc sets, they could have fit on one with no problem.  A documentary on D'Amato and an appearance by George Eastman.  Anthropaphagus is a film that's only gonna appeal to a small band of people, and they know who they are.  It's certainly worth the price, especially if you're sick of those awful Grim Reaper vhs tapes.",1140307200,2,2980,4.538461538461538
2384532,2,B000AC7P5Q,"Of all the gore-miester, gun-for-hire directors Italy produced in the early 80's, who enjoy a cult following, Joe D'Amato has to be the worst and most undeserving. Anthropophagus is supposed to be one his best, along with equally so-so Beyond The Darkness. Void of style or suspense, all Anthropophagus consists of is a handful of shock kills, and a tedious, nearly incoherent framework to fill out the run time. The ghoul-man is creepy to behold, but few who sit through the whole film are going to walk away feeling fed.

D'Amato's films often feature hard-core sex, and he would later focus exclusively on porn, which makes sense when you consider his ""money-shot"" and filler style of filmaking. Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are porn films, but my standards for horror are a little higher, and I choose my hacks with greater care.",1138752000,5,848,4.808219178082192
2384533,3,B000AC7P5Q,"Most of the reviewers are reviewing the wrong release. Most of u guys have the DVD from some obscure distributor (the one that has no chapter menus and is the R-rated version which was titled only The Grim Reaper). Anthropophagus : Grim Reaper by shriek show/Media Blasters is the official rerelease with chapter menus, extras, uncut, etc..  So stop reviewing the wrong DVD release version. Reviewers need to do their research b4 putting a very negative posting for the wrong rerelease. Amateurs !",1136764800,12,497,4.9879518072289155
2384534,4,B000AC7P5Q,"Finally! ""Grim reaper"" edition was severely cut, japanize edition was very hard to get and it was rather expensive, latest german or italian editions had technical problems... Now we'll have it as it was supposed to be - and here at Amazon! And rather cheap! Amazing! I've been waiting for this moment for so many years!

 Now ""Anthropophagus"" may not be a masterpiece but it has become a cult classic very long time ago. In the beginning of 80s violence on screen were measured by the standards of ""Friday the 13th"" and so on. And only Italian filmmakers seemed to dare making something utterly different. They brought gore to the extent when it was really nauseous. In ""Anthropophagus"" you can see two scenes (one of them is an infamous fetus-eating scene) that are truly disgusting. By the way they were cut from many previous releases of the film. But excepting gore and guts I can say the movie has a really horrific atmosphere - a dreamy one like in many italian horrors. Watching ""Anthropophagus"" you have a feeling of fear, irreversibility and death - very unpleasant feeling which appears even when everything seems to be calm on screen. I'm pretty confident this is the best work of Joe D'Amato who's known for making cheap exploitative flicks. If you have seen some of them, don't make up your mind about ""Anthropophagus"" - it's totally different.

If you're in for horror, if you like giallo and such names as Argento, Fulci, Lenzi, Deodato and Bava mean something to you - this movie is for you. I repeat it may not have a big cultural value but you MUST have it on your shelf if you call yourself a horror buff",1125187200,56,1624,4.631944444444445
2384535,2,B000AC7P5Q,"This movie is pretty corny imo.

What kind of composer in their right mind makes such silly music that you hear when this film starts???? MY GOD!

George Eastman is a regular italian trash film guy, and this is no exception.

There are certainly worse italian horrors out there like the ones made by Jess Franco,

(who passed away recently unfortunately, RIP)

I personally find zero replay value in this one.

To be honest I even watched this film a 2nd time, and my opinion stands.

The sequel to this is a little better imo.",1377820800,,527,4.484210526315789
2384536,5,B000AC7P5Q,"This movie is great.

The antagonist wastes no time at all, he just goes right up to people and starts chowing away.

Also, the whole vibe is great, you know, grainy film quality, totally muffled voiceovers, eerie 70's-style music.  Its a must have for any cheap horror fan.

It gets very suspenseful at times, and some scenes are really shocking.

Gore fans need apply too.

Its just a really good, creepy, scary film in general.",1228262400,,430,4.666666666666667
2384537,4,B000AC7P5Q,"I remember seen this this movie with friends in Chicago when it was first released. It's one of the movies that still scares me! It builds suspense and the blood, guts, cannibalism, etc. are one of the most graphic ever filmed! NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!",1226448000,2,255,4.446808510638298
2384538,3,B000AC7P5Q,"Straight to the point, this is an ok exploitation movie from Joe D'Amato. Not a bad idea, but the script remained poor. About the DVD edition, it is indeed the uncut version. Note that the lenght of this feature is about 90 min and not the 88 that is advertised on the DVD package. I recommnend selecting the Italian sound with the English subtitles so you will not appreciate the bad English dubbing and translation. The extras include an interesting documentary mostly about the non porno filmography of D'Amato that include enterviews to director Joe D'Amato and script writer and ""actor"" George Eastman. In both you will be able to appreciate some of the conflicting relationship between both. The enterview to D'Amato is particularly interesting as he comments about his adventure, horror and erotic films. He also talks about other Italian directors of the genre including Lucio Fulci and Michele Soavi, among others. In short, the material included in this 2-disk DVD release is probably good enough to please exploitation and D'Amato collectors.",1217116800,,1053,5.092485549132948
2384539,1,B000AC7P5Q,"This is an extraordinary film -- one of the best Italian horrors out there.  Two scenes in particular of unsurpassed gore -- and I've been watching horror for 30 years.  (No, I won't write any spoilers.)

I saw this film when it was first released in the theaters in the early 1980s, and then on VHS, and then on this DVD set.

But this 2-DVD set is POORLY MANUFACTURED.

I bought this 2-DVD set last year.  It kept freezing in my JVC DVD player.  So I returned it for a refund.

But this is such great film, a year later, I ordered another 2-DVD set.  Maybe I'd gotten a bad batch before?

AGAIN, the DVD froze in my DVD player.  So I tried it on another DVD player.  It froze in that one too.

I had to wait for the DVD to jerk past the scene, and nudge it along, trying to get it to play smoothly

Great film.  It's sad they have such a low quality control at whatever factory they're using.",1214697600,,894,4.086705202312139
2384540,1,B000AC7P5Q,"Many individuals have certainly heard of this cult classic.  After a painful viewing, it was discovered to be slow and very boring.  There is nothing that could save this film.  Missing this film is an asset, but do not take my word for it.  Go ahead and waste the money to see it for yourself.  Then you could write a bad review.  I did read some of the good reviews, but I just do not get how anyone could find this movie better than one star.  No stars would be a better score for this snail.",1195776000,,495,4.09375
2384541,2,B000AC7P5Q,"I am not sure, but I think that this movie is still banned here in Germany. The more I was looking forward to see it in its original, that is uncut, form.
However, the quality of this edition is rather poor. While it seems to be uncut, the sound and picture quality (even considering the fact that this whole thing was shot on 16mm) is a major nuisance.
The opening sequence (with a young girl being killed in the water by the cannibalistic George Eastman) was shot in German language, but it took me (as a native speaker) a while to realize that this was neither Italian nor English! That's how bad the sound quality is.
The movie as such besides its technical flaws, is...also a disappointment, at least in my book. Bad acting, bad directing, a minimum plot, quite passable special effects...this is not enough to satisfy me. (I have to admit though that I am not too much into late 70s/early 80s Italian horror flicks, so my opinion may not be of too much relevance here.)",1187827200,4,975,4.48314606741573
2384542,5,B000AC7P5Q,"If your looking for the same old Hollywood ""pop-horror"" crap, then you might as well stop reading this review now. If you are looking for some good extreme horror that pushes the envelope (which all GOOD horror does), and is actually scary, unlike movies that come out of ""Wussy-Wood"", then you should definitely check this one out. Although it has it's flaws (cinematography, dubbing), overall it is a great Italian horror movie with great acting, great scenery, and of coarse gore galore.

The story is about a man that ends up having to eat his family after being stuck in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean (got to do what you got to do). Not only does he eat his family but devours a whole town on a small Italian island. How cool is that!? a group of friends decide to take a trip to this island only to find out the whole town is dead and there is a cannibal lurking around.

Gore includes: fetus eating, multiple stabbings, zombie-esque neck-biting, clever to the head, a hanging, and a dude who eats his own entrails.

If your just as sick of Hollywood as I am and want to see some real horror , check out Anthropaphagus.",1186099200,13,1133,4.4375

2384544,5,B000AC7P5Q,"Joe D'Amato's masterpiece Anthropophagus is both one of the finest and the least appreciated of the Italian Horror Golden Age. D'Amato had already established himself as the master of raw gore in Blue Holocaust (aka Beyond the Darkness aka Buried Alive), and the snuff movie footage in Emmanuelle in America (the inspiration for Videodrome). In his entry into the slasher genre, he enriches Anthropophagus with a steady build-up of layered atmosphere until he has recreated the old dark castle effect of the classic Universal monster movies of the 30s. Then he lets the blood flood. Released butchered in the states as Grim Reaper, this version is uncut and contains the films two highmarks: the scene where a fetus is pulled out of a pregnant woman and eaten, as well as the pull out your fingernails climax where cannibalism is taken to it's most extreme. Most haunting is the flashback explaining where the flesheater came from, it makes your stomach drop. This movie establishes D'Amato in the ranks of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci as one of the masters of the spagetti nightmare.",1174953600,11,1085,4.967032967032967

Gross and interesting Italian cannibal flick that is a little slow sometimes but does warm up on the memorable gore such as the abortion sequence and eating the fetus scene with some nasty flesh-eating here. It plays like a mystery-horror thriller but fails a bit for scares or good pacing, Tisa Farrow (Mia's sister) whom some horror fans know her as the main woman from ""Zombi 2"" does a good performance. It's an all-right effort that kind of capitalizes on the successes of ""Zombi 2"" and ""Cannibal Holocaust"" as it's nowhere as good as those movie.

2384552,5,B000AC7P5Q,"""Man-Eater"" is a legend among the fans of italian horror movies. Surprisingly, it has different qualities than you might think. While I awaited a gore-feast with a lack of atmosphere and real schocks- I got the OPPOSITE ! This is probably one of D'Amatos better films. He succeeds in building up a cruel atmosphere and has an eye for both schocking and good looking sequences. Of course it has some gore, but it isn't really that bad. The only sad thing is, that D'Amato kind of wastes the presence of the Anthropophagus. While he carefully builds up a scary atmosphere, this is ruinde by the Anthropophagus walking slowly right in front of our hereos, like a zombie. But overall, this is one of the better italian horror-flicks.

But one thing is sure, this is probably one of the best DVDs I've ever seen. The film might by cheap and old, but Shriek Shows provides us with very interesting extras and some easter-eggs, including a trailer-reel for the most popular D'Amato-movies. The documentary also features footage of rare and unavailable flicks.

2384553,4,B000AC7P5Q,"I like this movie. It's just so damned screwball. You just don't, all that often, see defeated cannibals eating their own guts in anthropophagic effigy. It's just not an everyday occurrence. I know what you're thinking. I've tried all the other options, but is cannibalism really right for me?

The movie is bottlenecked on an island that has mostly avoided the wiles of civilized (1980) technology. Apparently, by the time our intrepid cast arrives, the cannibal, Nikos, has assaulted nearly everyone with his anthropophagic fervor. However, a note of admonishment: Nikos is extremely wasteful, leaving whole corpses, mostly uneaten, to lie around and rot. This is an affront to all the starving cannibals in the world.

It takes a while for the horror to regenerate its presence after Nikos' initial slipshot murder of two non-related tourists at the beginning of the movie, but it gets there eventually. One by one, the cannibal stalks and kills his prey. Down they go, a bite here, a bite there. During the mausoleum/gobbled fetus scene, Nikos actually suffers a flashback to the impetus of his anthropophagic transformation. Stranded at sea on a tiny inflatable raft with his voluptuous wife, he contemplates using his dead son as sustenance and the wife, so repulsed by the idea, throws herself onto Nikos' knife, demanding that he cannibalize her instead. Utilizing Nikos as an anthropophagic archetype, cannibalism will impart to its host the following: hair loss, rugose forehead, superhuman strength and endurance. (Consult your physician immediately if you experience nausea, constipation, dizziness, ocular bleeding or sleeplessness.)

Finally, Nikos meets his demise at the business end of a rusty mattock. Humbled by the blow, he slumps to his knees, then matter-of-factly loops his raw pink intestines through the grievous wound, and eats them with vigorous anthropophagic contempt. Cut and print! Look for Nikos' triumphant return in Anthropophagus 2: Electric Boogaloo, where he has to use his anthropophagic skills to save to local rec center when an evil tycoon threatens to replace it with a vegetarian farmer's market.",1149552000,30,2139,5.322485207100592

8077764,3,B000AC7P5Q,"WARNING SPOILERS!!! I've been watching a lot of Italian horror films lately, so I decided to revisit this film, which I originally saw in a theater in late-1981 (as THE GRIM REAPER) in a severely truncated R-Rated edit from Film Ventures International (who also released the film under the title THE ZOMBIE'S RAGE!). Sad to say, my opinion of this film hasn't changed, even though it is totally uncut and in anamorphic widescreen.
  The film opens with a young German couple (and their dog) walking through the narrow cobblestone sidewalks of a Greek village (filmed in Athens, Greece). They end up at the beach, where the lovely young woman strips off her clothes to reveal a skimpy bikini and the guy puts on headphones and listens to disco music. The girl goes into the ocean and she notices an unmanned row boat drifting in the distance. She swims to it and sees something bloody inside, when someone pulls her underwater and drags her to her death (her boyfriend can't hear her screams because of the headphones). We then watch as someone plants a meatcleaver into the boyfriend's skull (the dog runs away).
  We are then introduced to the pregnant Maggie (Serena Grandi), who is riding in a cable car in Greece with her husband Arnold (Bob Larson; ANGELFIST - 1992) and friends Carol (Zora Kerova; THE NEW YORK RIPPER - 1982) & Daniel (Mark Bodin; ALIEN 2 - 1980). When fellow cable car rider Julie (Tisa Farrow;...AND HOPE TO DIE - 1972; ZOMBIE - 1979) overhears that the group are going to take a boat to a Greek island, she asks if she can come along for the ride because she was hired to chaperon the 15 year-old daughter of a French couple for the Summer and they live on that island. The group agrees and they all meet Andy (Saverio Vallone), the pilot of the boat and good friend of the group. Once on the boat, Carol reads Maggie's future by using Tarot cards, but refuses to tell Maggie what they mean (Carol tells Julie that Maggie has no future). When they get to the island, Maggie sprains her ankle getting off the boat and decides to stay on the boat with a deckhand, while the others walk to the village. Julie finds it strange that the French couple didn't come to greet her, but when they get to the village they find out why: the village is deserted.
  Meanwhile, back on the boat, Maggie discovers the deckhand's severed head in a water bucket and she herself falls victim to the unknown killer, as we see him dragging her body away. Julie discovers a mutilated corpse in the village (""It looks all chewed up!""), so Arnold and everyone else run to the boat to make sure Maggie is OK, but they find someone has pulled up anchor and the boat is slowly drifting off to sea. Everyone is now trapped on the island and must make the best of a bad situation. Julie discovers that her 15 year-old charge, Rita (Margaret Donnelly) is hiding in a barrel of wine. Rita jumps up and stabs Daniel with a knife (it is only a flesh wound) and all she can say is, ""Blood! The smell of blood!"" Carol catches Daniel putting the moves on Julie, becomes jealous and runs away. Julie chases after her and Carol locks her in a cemetery. Daniel, who is keeping a close watch on Rita, hears a noise downstairs and goes to investigate (Rita yells out, ""He's here. I can smell him!""). Rita screams and it is at this time that we get a good look at the killer: A hulk of a man named Nikos Karamanlis (George Eastman; ENDGAME - 1983) who kills Daniel by taking a huge bite out of his neck. Nikos has become The ""Anthropophagus Man"", or a person who loves the taste of human flesh. It seems he became that way when his boat capsized and he and his family were trapped on a rubber raft with no rescue in sight. The only way he could survive was to eat his young son and wife!
  Julie finds a diary in the home of the Karamanlis', a family that have lived on the island for over a hundred years. It explains how Nikos became a flesh eater and why Ruth Karamanlis (Rubina Rey) has just hanged herself in front of the group. Andy and Arnold search the island hoping to find a way to get to the drifting boat. They split up (always a good idea in a horror film) and Arnold finds one of Maggie's shoes on a path that leads to an underground catacomb. Arnold finds Maggie alive, but she won't stay that way for long, as Nikos traps them in the catacomb, stabs Arnold in the neck and, in the film's most notorious scene (which is not in the R-Rated version), he rips the baby out of Maggie's womb and eats it!
  Now it is Julie and a semi-comatose Rita's turn to fight off the flesh-hungry monster. Who will survive? It also answers this question: What will the Anthropophagus Man eat when there are no more humans on the island? Why, he will eat his own intestines (as we watch as Andy plants a pickaxe into Nikos' stomach and his innards fall out!).
  The fact of the matter is that this film is rather boring, even in its uncut form. Director Joe D'Amato was never a man to make a really understandable horror film, his best one being the exercise in bad taste BURIED ALIVE (a.k.a BEYOND THE DARKNESS - 1979) a gore-filled tale of necrophilia, as well as TRAP THEM AND KILL THEM (1977), an Italian cannibal film. D'Amato became known as Italy's purveyor of sleaze because he always mixed sex with horror (but, strangely, not in this film) and when Italian horror movies no longer became popular, he made over 150 porn films before his death in 1999. The screenplay, by D'Amato (using his real name, Aristide Massaccesi) and Eastman (using his real name, Luigi Montefiori) is too leisurely paced for its own good and the gore doesn't begin to flow until the finale, as we see Nikos pulling Rita's head through a hole in the roof, the skin on her face peeling away as it comes out of the small hole. Or the baby eating scene (it was actually a skinned rabbit!), which doesn't have the power it once did in the early-'80s. Rumor has it that Tisa Farrow (the sister of Mia Farrow) was so disgusted with this film that she retired from acting. When viewed today, the film is very boring and offers few surprises or jolts. What was considered gory nearly 40 years ago seems old hat today. D'Amato made a semi-sequel, ANTHROPOPHAGUS II (1981), better known on U.S. shores as MONSTER HUNTER, once again starring George Eastman as the hulking monster, but it, too, was a dog.
  ANTHROPOPHAGUS was known under a slew of alternate titles. It was released on VHS in the R-Rated theatrical cut under the name THE GRIM REAPER by Monterey Home Video, with that same fullscreen version released on budget DVD from Digital Versatile Disc, Ltd. This review is based on the uncut anamorphic widescreen 2 Disc Special Edition DVD from Shriek Show that was released in 2005. It is heavy on extras, which may make this the preferred version for people that want to know more about Joe D'Amato than they could possibly hope for. It was also released on Blu-Ray from 88 Films. Besides the lovely Greek scenery, this is really nothing special, just an uninteresting relic in early-'80s Italian horror film history. It gets more publicity than it deserves, but other people may disagree. Also starring Simone Baker, Mark Logan, with a cameo by D'Amato as a bearded man exiting the cable car.

8077766,3,B000AC7P5Q,"Collecting the ""Video Nasties"" became a priority for me as they began coming out entirely uncut. The DVD boom of the early 2000's brought out some seriously lost in time cinema. To complete ones horror collection, you find titles that you remember growing up, others you will discover for the first time. Regardless, I had to own every title on the notorious nasties list. I absolutely love Italian horror so I didn't hesitate to order ""Anthropophagus"". The movie moves pretty slowly along, but Tisa Farrow always manages to keep me engaged <3 The atmosphere in ""Anthropophagus"" does not compare to most Italian horror, and after about 40 minutes in you begin to wonder ""why is this on the nasties list...""
Then we see the Monster pull an unborn fetus from a woman's vagina while squashing her face!
The gore and Tisa Farrow are what make this movie. You gotta sit through some uninspired cinematography and typical plot devices, but it pays off for the climax. ""Anthropophagus"" is not one of the best Italian horrors, but it's a worthy contribution to any collection.
Joe D'Amato has some fantastic entries to horror and sleaze cinema from a great time gone.",1455926400,,1159,4.858585858585859

8077769,4,B000AC7P5Q,"This 2 Disc Shriek Show release was a pleasant surprise for me. An italian horror movie that was full of atmosphere, and some nice gore added to it.

The picture and audio are great. Plenty of grain that looks good, and not much print damage. The english track sounds fine, if at times a little hard to understand.

The slipcase the DVD came in is of good quality, and looks gorgeous!

The DVD has many extras but the ones that got my interest the most were the 8 trailers of other Shriek Show releases that piqued my interest, and a documentary with the director where he discusses his filmography.

This DVD is now out out of print since Media Blaster closed Shriek Show's doors awhile ago, so it seems to have gone up in price on Amazon but if you shop around the internet you should find a decent copy for about 10 dollars like I did at this moment.

There is a few other releases of Anthropophagus but they all seemed to be edited heavily, so it seems this is the only way to truly watch the film. While not a horror classic like Nightmare on Elm Street, or Halloween, it's a great 80's horror movie. Not a must get, but for fans of Italian films this is one to get, especially before prices go up.",1410825600,,1203,4.28193832599119

8077772,5,B000AC7P5Q,"Story: Vacationers take a trip to an island. Unknowingly to them the island's inhabitants have been consumed, by a crazed cannibalistic man- Nichos (George Eastman). On the island they find a blind woman, and bloody mayhem ensues.  Strengths and weaknesses: some performances are good, others are bad. The story although some what simple, has interesting elements. The film from beginning to end has foreboding atmosphere and suspense. The architectural scenery in the deserted village is grim and beautiful. The score is brooding and fantastic. The gore effects range from bad to gloriously graphic. The makeup for Nichos looks great. Some characters are interesting while others are dull. The film's climax is suspenseful and great.  How it made it on the Video Nasties list? Only 2 scenes in particular, the cannibal fetus consumption abortion, and the self consumption scene.  My Thoughts: Anthropophagous is a suspenseful slasher that I love, and in all honesty it is my favorite Italian horror film. It in my opinion is wrongfully accused of being a video nasty as the film has no other grotesque qualities, just 2 scenes in particular which are done legally.
Fun Facts: The film was made for the soul purpose to make money. The fetus in the baby eating scene is a skinned rabbit, bought from a butcher shop, bent in a fetus shape and drenched in fake blood. It was a deemed a video nasty. Alternate titles include, The Beast, The Grim Reaper, Anthropophagous, Anthropophagous: The Beast. The film spawned a sequel, Absurd aka: Horrible.
Disc 1 content: Main feature, audio selection, scene selection, trailers, and other trailers.
Disc 2 content: Documentary, George Eastman public appearance 05, alternate US opening, photo gallery, more trailers.

My rating: DVD- 5/5 Film- 4/5",1393113600,,1786,5.16955017301038
8077773,5,B000AC7P5Q,"Most fans of D'Amato or grindhouse flicks have probably already seen this, so a review may not be necessary. It's a great nostalgic horror film that captures the charm of 80s exploitation. In the beginning, we've got an off-screen death with a woman being pulled underneath the water with lots of blood rising upwards. Something then rises up, and It approaches the beach in a well directed POV sequence where it kills a guy who is laying around the shore with a meat cleaver. This fast-paced start then slows down, and characters are introduced. These people board a boat and head to an island where they later encounter a deranged cannibal who was seemingly normal long ago, but he apparently ate both his wife who he killed accidently and his dead son in order to survive when they were stranded on a raft at sea. After the beginning gore sequence, the film concentrates on filming the locations and developing some great atmosphere. You see them travel to get the boat, and then you see the sea and them sailing. When they arrive at the deserted island, an emphasis is placed on filming the locations and then developing some excellent atmospheric scenes. The deserted island with some of its structures, the sea, and some effective and creepy atmosphere give the movie a great midnight movie feel. We later get the gore, like a neck biting and that sequence when the fetus is pulled from a pregnant woman; However, the movie doesn't have non-stop gore. The sequence when the fetus (I read that the FX for this part was just a skinned rabbit) is pulled and eaten is more violent and intense than actually gory because the camera cuts away after he sinks his teeth into it. Another notable sequence involves a man traveling through the cannibals cavern which shows the skeletal remains of his victims; this is done with some excellent errie music. I thought the film delivers some really good but cheap gore, and I personally think the movies replay value is excellent; although it's slow in parts. If you don't like gore, you might still like the films locations, the atmosphere, and the suspense that it delivers at times. I'm a fan of D'Amato, so I personally thought it's really well directed; it's a got a great early 80s style Italian exploitation feel. Another thing that should be noted is that there's no nudity in the movie.

The DVD quality is excellent. There's a good extra where Zora Kerova and Eastman talk about the film. There's also Shriek Show trailers and some nice grindhouse style trailers for Anthropophagous, as well as a photo gallery. There's the alternate opening titled THE GRIM REAPER, and another opening titled THE SAVAGE ISLAND plays after that. The best extra is the Joe D' Amato documentary. You can watch the movie in its original Italian dialogue with English subtitles.",1384128000,4,2809,4.7917525773195875
