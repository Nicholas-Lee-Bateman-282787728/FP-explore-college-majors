2023679,5,B0001Q4BLW,"My 19months old son loves Thomas.

He watches these DVD again and again everyday.

I can playback these DVD by Japanese DVD player.",1156723200,5,131,4.6521739130434785
2023680,5,B0001Q4BLW,"My son, almost 4, watches these over and over.  He knows them all by heart.  Percy's Chocolate Crunch is his favorite.  They really give him story ideas for his make believe play with his trains...  Buying the set saved some $$$$, always a good thing, especially when you must pay so much for the actual wooden Thomas toys - but oh so worth every penny....",1143331200,5,356,4.430769230769231
2023681,4,B0001Q4BLW,"The Percy's Chocolate Crunch video is a big hit with my grandson and with me.  However, the other two are just okay.  I still think the several disc sets are any easy way to start a Thomas collection or to get aquainted with the series, and this set does that well.",1127952000,4,265,4.176470588235294
2023682,5,B0001Q4BLW,"My 2 yr old son has just recently become a Thomas fan.  I purchased a cheap tape at Kmart and he fell in love with it.  Now we purchased this set and it's wonderful!  The best part is that all three are narrated by Alec Baldwin, who in my opinion, is the best narrator!  I have found that he does not like those narrated by others and refuses to even watch them.  If you are considering buying this set...DO IT!",1124409600,4,411,4.0875
2023683,3,B0001Q4BLW,"I always preface my kid reviews by saying that my 2 year old approves of the content---there were some tense moments in spills and chills, but otherwise, my main issue is with Alec Baldwin....was it really necessary to make James (who used to be my favorite engine) sound like a big, whiny queen??  My brain is still scarred from his ""OH HEEELLLP!!, Goooo Away!"" and his ""OH, PUHLEEZE!"".  Over and over I ask myself, ""What happened to the days of Ringo Starr??? What happened to good narration?  What happened to quality production?""  As you can see, I'm probably asking myself too many questions!! :)  Anyway, the stories have their good points, but the real downer is Alec Baldwin which is enormously disappointing to me because as an actor I find him to be quite good. Oh, and the previous gripe about the unskippable ads which seem to be more prevalent in Thomas DVDs is totally legit!!  It is dreadful to have to sit through hyped up commercialism that most parents are trying to eliminate these days.  If Disney did this, their stock would take a dive! Let's hope the dismal outcome is just in this collection!",1097971200,15,1116,4.663265306122449
2023684,2,B0001Q4BLW,"My son loves Thomas. He can operate the DVD player just fine. However, on these Thomas DVDs, there are 2-3 minutes of advertizing (Spam) for other DVDs before you can get to see the content. They can't be skipped although some players let you fast forward through them. This totally sucks. It's hard to explain to a small child that he'll have to wait. Although cheap for 3 dvds (~$25 at the time of writing), since this set only contains about 30 minutes of ""actual content"" on each disc, I find that I have paid in full and shouldn't be forced to sit through the spam. Again, the content is fine - it's just unbelievably rude that they don't let you skip the ads.",1096156800,32,665,4.370967741935484
2023685,5,B0001Q4BLW,"These 3 dvd sets are a great value.  Not only do you get the originally released VHS material on each dvd, but there are numerous bonus features added to these dvd versions which will captivate you children for hours!  Any parent knows at times this can be a life-saver!  The dvds are also great because there is no constant rewinding of VHS tapes; plus your child can access their favorite parts of the dvd without your help with the dvd remote.  The Thomas series really teaches children some great lessons.  As an adult who often watches with my kids, I still crack up at the sight of Ringo Starr or George Carlin!  A must for any child's dvd collection, so add to cart ASAP!",1091836800,29,678,4.42741935483871
8016044,5,B0001Q4BLW,This was for our grandson (3) who loved Thoms the Train.  We highly recommend this for your little one.  Enjoy.,1394582400,,111,4.5
8016045,5,B0001Q4BLW,"If you're child loves Thomas like so many do, then you'll want to get this set. My son watched them over and over and over again. It's fun for parents to watch as well.",1250812800,,168,3.9705882352941178
8016046,4,B0001Q4BLW,"My son and I greatly enjoy this box set.  It has a lot of nice features, and very interesting stories.  The only downside is that there are a few uninterruptible commercials that start up every time you put in the dvd.",1221696000,,218,4.2926829268292686
8016047,5,B0001Q4BLW,This a a very good value. I've purchased Thomas DVD's individually for upwards of $13.00. This is definitely a bargain!,1219017600,,119,5.0
8016048,5,B0001Q4BLW,"Hours of fun.  Our grandson, Antonio is almost 2 y/o and loves his Thomas toys and videos.  The videos give our daughter a little extra time during the day as she is able to sit in the living room with Antonio and work with her lap top as he watched Thomas.  She can get some work done and he is always in sight.",1215216000,,312,3.9206349206349205
8016049,5,B0001Q4BLW,My son got these for Christmas and we have only watched Sills & Chills and Percy's Chocolate Crunch. He's watched the same movies over and over.,1199232000,,144,4.576923076923077
8016050,1,B0001Q4BLW,"I'm sad!  My grandson loves Thomas and when these DVD's arrived, the cases were all cracked and 1 of the disc's kept freezing!  Needless to say, I won't be buying anything from this seller ever again!",1196640000,,200,4.527777777777778
8016051,4,B0001Q4BLW,This is a great package! Three Thomas the train DVDs at a special rate. While not all parents might like this the kids will love this set.,1180483200,,138,4.148148148148148
