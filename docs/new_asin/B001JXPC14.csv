3660637,1,B001JXPC14,"this dvd is too advanced for beginners, i have a lot of other cardio dvd's i use and thought i'd try this one out but it just sits around collecting dust. I have even loaned it out to friends, it is to fast paced to keep up with. she moves to fast and then coreograghs it all together so quickly, before youv'e even learned the moves. I wouldn't reccomend for beginners.",1250208000,11,370,4.225352112676056
3660638,5,B001JXPC14,"I thought that this dvd was AWESOME.  I had so much fun and for the first time doing it, I did all four.  If you are at all familiar with aerobic steps, you will totally do fine.  The dance combos build on one another, so by the end of the 20 minute ones you are doing a routine that is about two minutes.  I really enjoyed it and also appreciated the first ten minute segments.  They give you an idea of what to expect in the 20 minute routines.  It is easy enough but I did build up a great stinky sweat (ha ha).  Also, please note that this is coming from a woman who honestly needs to lose about 75 pounds.  I do walk about a mile and a half a day but knew I needed to get my butt in gear.  I was sick of cardio machines and thought I LOVE TO DANCE, LET""S DO IT PETRA!!!!",1247356800,7,775,3.8238993710691824
3660639,5,B001JXPC14,"I learned about this product from a review on [...] and thought I would give it a try. Very well done! The video was clear, has two 10 minute segments, which I recommend for a first time workout and to get to know how Petra works, and two 20 minute segments with stretching segments as well. This video has something for everyone.",1243641600,2,330,4.338709677419355
3660640,3,B001JXPC14,"I had recorded a session off Fit TV with Petra Kolber and really loved her energy and enthusiasm, and the session I recorded had GREAT music.  This DVD is good, but is truly for beginners.  If you're just starting to exercise, you will probably like this a lot because she tells you everything she's going to do before she does it, which makes it really easy to follow from the get-go.  I've been exercising to walk or dance DVD's for years and it was just a little too simple for me, with very routine steps that I've done a million times, plus the music was just so-so.  I still love Petra though!",1242864000,15,599,4.321428571428571

Love this Dvd. When I seriously started to committ myself to exercise I found Petra Kolber on FITTV cable station. I love her upbeat ,encouraging ,and sincere attitude. This workout is challenging without being complicated .Petra shows you a movement and builds upon that foundation by reviewing that movement and adding another which creates ""combos'.She is not hard core ,so instead of screaming or using language to intimidate or shame you into compliance she'll make statements like""Do the best that You can do ,today"" or ""We're almost done if You can join us to the finish ."".She always gives the option of marching in place ,reminding you to breathe or get a sip of water. Like any other workout DVD one attempts ,it is always advisable to preview the workout before performing the exercises ,so you know what to expect before you actually start trying to execute the moves. You don't have to have studied at Julliard to do this workout. The more you intelligently, patiently,and diligently  perform  a task the better you'll become at that task.
I would recommend this DVD for exercisers at any fitness level because it is challenging for a beginner while being safe,an intermediate will easily be able to get his/her heart rate up by doing any one of the four workouts and the advanced exerciser can get a decent ,customized ,safe and ""light"" day workout in ,yet still feel accomplished.

I give this DVD 5+ stars.",1241481600,3,1580,5.358870967741935
3660642,1,B001JXPC14,NO  sireee...not  for beginners  I  think.  Ms Kolber should slow down a bit on the moves step.... quite difficult to follow the moves. This is not recommended for those who are new to exercises.  This would be more suited for those who are familiar with aerobics moves.,1240963200,11,270,4.638297872340425
3660643,2,B001JXPC14,"Although the instructor is very enthusiastic and energetic, the program is not easy to follow.  The routines are changed too fast, with not enough repetitions.  It is not fun and safe to change from one routine to another so fast.  I tried to do the program once, slightly hurt my back, and changed to another instructor afterwards.  Definitely not for beginners.",1240531200,3,363,4.901639344262295

For one, I have no rythem what so ever but Petra makes is so easy, the only drawback I have is she doesn't show the steps first before doing them. You can pick it up really easy though. I love this dvd, have been doing it every day since I purchesed it three weeks ago. I recommend it to the extreme beginner.",1239148800,20,390,4.012820512820513
3660645,5,B001JXPC14,"I recently got this video and really like it!  I'm really not a beginner, but thought this video would be a good one for my library and give me something different to do...as we get tired of doing the same routines over and over again.  The steps are easy and varies from my other DVD's...and I love the energy...gets me going too!",1237939200,7,331,4.32258064516129
3660646,5,B001JXPC14,"As my title says, this DVD is great for beginners because the choreography is not difficult, and, as always, Petra Kolber is an inspiration.

The DVD has 4 cardio segments:
1. 10 minute sport routine
2. 10 minute cardio dance routine
3. 20 minute sport routine
4. 20 minute cardio dance routine
5. 5 minute stretching segment.

The sport routines consists of hamstring curls, step touches, and other easy moves.  The dance routines have more fun choreography.  The different length segments are great if you're short on time or you are a beginning excerciser and don't have the stamina for longer workout routines.

Miscellaneous information about the DVD:
1. The music is catchy and up beat.
2. The set is not the best...but who works out for the set?
3. One annoying thing is that there is no option to play all of the segments.  If you want to play all 5 segments, you have to go to the menu and click on every segment.

About the instructor:
Petra Kolber is full of energy and is encouraging without being annoying.  I'm an intermediate to advanced excerciser and I bought this DVD strictly because I'm a huge fan of Petra Kolber.  If you're an intermediate to advanced excercisor, I would recommend Petra's 3-2-1 Dance, as you might get a tad bored with the Cardio for Beginners DVD.",1237766400,52,1288,4.663716814159292

3660729,5,B001JXPC14,"Great video for beginners!  She is a wonderful instructor and does routines.  The routines are easy to learn.  The warm up is ten minutes and the work out is twenty minutes, wish it was longer.",1434326400,,193,4.457142857142857
3660730,5,B001JXPC14,Love this DVD. Great place to start out when your new to cardio. Love the option to pick & choose which segments you want to do & what order.,1433808000,,141,3.896551724137931
3660731,4,B001JXPC14,"I am currently going through all of my workout DVDs to see which ones I will keep and which ones I will let go. I'm trying to keep a variety of options for when I need easier workouts and when I work up to harder workouts.  I've been coming back since the begining of the year from a really bad fitness year last year and I would say that I'm up to a high beginner or into intermediate - depending on the day and the workout.

This DVD seems to be a great one for me to keep because of all of that. It seems like it would be a good beginners to intermediates. This is a beginner workout can be used by both newbies and experienced exercisers who are restarting, dialing things back, facing time crunches, or just wanting easier workouts. There is some minimal choreography, but Petra's cueing is so good and it's not very complicated, so it should be accessible to most people.

I was just so glad to see a DVD that takes advantage of DVD techlology. (Go figure.) The dvd includes four different segments, two labeled as athletic and two labeled as dancey, and you can program the DVD to play them in any order.  Each segment starts with a quick warm up and then builds into one big combo after Petra teaches a few steps together at a time, and then youll TIFT (take it from the top). She builds the combinations slowly, taking it from the top as she goes, and then she does the final combo serveral times.

There are two background exercisers who do the work out as is.  Once in awhile, Petra does an easier version of a move while the background exercisers do the harder verion (as in a mambo vs. a pivot).  The music is typical instrumental.  A couple of times, Petra talks about working out to ""some great music"" and I kept waiting for it, but it never started.

The best part of this workout is Petra herself.  Her cuing is excellent and constant; generally, she cues just ahead of the move.  she also mirror cues except for a couple of times she apparently forgets about it. She's enthusiastic and is very supportive of you doing what is good for you.  Throughout the workout, she encourages you to do what is good for you (whether or not to add arms to the leg movements, adding more intensity or not, etc.)

Overall, I like this workout, although the TIFTing does get to me sometimes.  I use this workout when I'm in a tired place and don't have a lot of energy.  Petra keeps me with her and motivated to finish the workout.  When I have more brain power, I find the TIFTing can make the workout seem longer than it is.",1431561600,,2527,4.310782241014799
3660732,5,B001JXPC14,"Petra has created a great DVD for beginner cardio (or for days you don't have much time). There are two 10-minute options and two 20-minute options (you can choose athletic style, which sometimes my husband will do with me, or dance style). It's great to start with the 10-minute workouts and work your way up to the 20-minute ones, and the different styles keep it from getting stale. Low-impact style aerobics, easy on joints but gives a good heart-pumping workout. Recommend for people who haven't exercised in awhile and want to start back up gradually.",1430524800,,557,4.873684210526315

3660744,4,B001JXPC14,My wife and I are trying to get into better shape and this is a great video for those who have been away from cardio training for a long while (ie me). I docked a star because it is difficult to stream constantly and there is no sort of chaptering in the digital version that will take you to the different work out sections.,1424390400,,325,4.09375
3660745,4,B001JXPC14,I liked it but it was a little bit to quick for me to be able to keep up with her & it just went to fast for me. I didn't like that she didn't show what to do before she started it. the woman that she had behind there were way to young & they had no problem keeping up with her but I did & really don't want to use it that much right now. I will try one of the others that I have purchased from here until I can build up to this high tech video.,1424304000,,445,3.46
3660746,4,B001JXPC14,"I am a clumsy non-dancer and I struggled mightily with this video the first several times. In fact, the first time I did it I was in tears. I thought, if this is basic I'm not going to be able do ANY cardio videos. However, with some encouragement from my husband I stuck it out and after about a week, I got the moves down.

Here's the deal though, these really are basic. I watched a number of other videos for cardio and was in shock over some of the things that they expect people to do. Since I can barely move my arms and legs at the same time (outside of walking), a more comprehensive routine would be awful for me.

Overall, I really like this DVD. For my workouts, I did the 10 min athletic cardio, 10 min dance cardio and two 20 minutes athletic cardio. I never was able to master the 20 minute dance cardio. It was too fast for me and a bit too complex. Again, I need to stress that the grapevine is a challenge for me LOL.

After about a month, the hour workout was no longer a challenge, I could do the whole above mentioned workout without feeling like I was working out. As such, I moved to another program that is more challenging. However, for a beginner I highly recommend this cardio workout.",1423526400,,1212,4.2155172413793105

3660831,4,B001JXPC14,"Just a warning - the instant video version has no menu option. It is arranged - 10 min cardio, 10 min dance, 20 min cardio, 20 min dance, 5 min cool down. So if, for instance, you want to do the 10 min cardio, 20 min cardio, and cool down (like I did today) you are going to spend a good amount of time in the middle of your workout scrolling around trying to find the correct segment. Glad I rented rather than purchased this version- I will definitely be getting the DVD with its menu option.

That being said, I enjoyed the workout very much. I wish there was a little bit more of a warm-up, but the steps will be familiar to anyone who's ever done a cardio workout (step tap, grapevine, lunge, squat.) The steps build upon themselves so that by the time you put the routine all together, you've done them several times. Petra is fun and motivating - not annoying, like some other instructors can be. I can see how this workout might get boring over time, as it is very repetitive, but it will get your heart pumping in the meantime.

Looking forward to trying the dance segments tomorrow.",1373414400,,1092,4.321951219512195

I usually look at the negative reviews and decide not to buy but I am so glad I tried the routines for free before ordering.  Now that I've seen all the negative reviews for this DVD, I cannot believe people are saying it's not for beginners.  Most of the complaints have to do with not being able to follow and not having enough reps of the routines to learn the different steps.  Yes, I must admit, it was hard to follow at first, because I am truly a beginner, but I did not give up.  After a couple of days I had all the steps down and was following just fine.  Also, doing the same steps over and over again is, in my opinion, is very boring.  Having her go from one step to another quickly and then putting it all together is fun, and, by the time you realize it, you're already at the end.  This is the only exercise routine that I've been able to stick with for more than a week and that says a lot, for someone who has not exercised since her teens, now 40 years old.

Instead of having you do one move for 10 - 15 seconds (to actually get some exercies) the dance moves changes every 1 - 2 seconds.

3660892,4,B001JXPC14,"I like this video quite a bit.  I'm mid 40s and quite a bit overweight, but I found the level doable. I worked up a sweat but didn't feel at all like I was going to die.  However if you aren't a ""dancey"" person, you might find it a bit hard to follow at least in the cardio dance part.  I've done some zumba, taken ballroom, done international folkdance..when someone says ""grapevine"" I know exactly what that is. But I found myself fumbling a bit. None of the steps are hard or complicated..the issue is she transitions to fast. Sometimes there are only two of a thing before the next thing, and that's just too fast. I'm sure I'll get it after another few tries, but with the other stuff I've done I tend to expect I'll get most of it right off.

That's one of the big differences between her and Leslie Sanson, Leslie always does several of a thing before the next one.  One of the good things I like about Petra though is she does cue well and she's enthused and encouraging without being over the top or annoying about it.  Most of her talk is about the cueing, not a lot of extra chatter.  I like the music and the set, and that there are just 3 dancers so not a lot of visual clutter.

 It's also got a handy feature where you can program a workout ahead, selecting from the options on the dvd (10 minute cardio, 10 minute atheletic, 20 minute cardio, 20 minute athletic).  I also like that there are 10 minute options. While 10 minutes may not be a great amount of time, its hard to get motivated sometimes and with this option I can talk myself into it ""well just do 10 minutes, its only 10 minutes"" and who doesn't have 10 minutes and with 4 workouts you can adjust the length and work up.",1362528000,2,1699,4.216049382716049

There are 10 minute and 20 minute intervals of exercise cardio or dance cardio so you can mix the time and type up to your mood.  The moves are easy to follow and with a little practice you are doing the routine.  I mix this DVD up with my Chris Freytag cardio workout which uses weights and the mat to get a total workout.  I just wish I could locate more of this type of exercise from Petra Kolber as she is pleasant to follow.  Not alot of mindless talk like Leslie Sansome.,1359590400,,543,4.133333333333334
3660936,5,B001JXPC14,"Very easy low impact video. The dance moves are fun and you'll really enjoy working out! I've tried other dance videos and they were a little to hard for me, but Petra Kolber does a great job in cueing.",1359072000,,202,4.205128205128205
3660937,5,B001JXPC14,"I am generally NOT a choreography person. I shake at the thought of doing ""steps"". But this workout video has changed my view of ""dancing"". I've always felt like a total clutz, preferring to do general (boring) exercises. But I liked the title ""Cardio for BEGINNERS"". It did take me about a month to be able to mirror Petra's groove but now I do feel like Ginger Rodgers! For all of you out there who fear dance as much as I did, keep at it, you will feel absolutely heroic when you finally get it. Wonderful workout!!!",1357516800,,519,4.360824742268041

3660939,4,B001JXPC14,"I have several of Petra's videos some are so old they are on VHS! She consistently has great workouts. This one is very good, it is for beginners but you still get a pretty good workout. I do use this dvd on days when I want to take it a little easy. She has great cueing so you are never lost. Some of her moves are repeats from older videos but I guess when you have been doing this for about 20 years that will happen.",1347667200,,421,3.9069767441860463
3660940,5,B001JXPC14,"This is a great workout for beginners, or folks who may have ""fallen off the wagon"" and just need to restart their workout programs.  The steps are easy to learn, but fun enough to keep you interested.  Petra brings such energy, and before you know it the workout is over.  I highly recommend this dvd!",1346889600,,302,4.454545454545454
3660941,5,B001JXPC14,"I am 45 Busy Mom & working full time.  Needless to say, I put everyone before myself and it has caught up with me.  Recent issues with blood pressure and ""stuff"" made me realize I need to take better care of myself.  I used to do Arobics years ago & loved it.  Living in Arizona I become a hermit in the summer time and this DVD gets me going after I get home from work.  There are 4 different workouts, 2 ten minute ones & 2 twenty minute ones.  After 2 weeks I am doing the 20 minute ones.  I love it!  Petra is very motivating, I know it sounds silly, but, it is like she & the other girls are right there with me.  I am not bored with it at all!!  I really like the 5 minute stretch at the end.  I know I will end up doing 2 twenty minute workouts back to back one of these days.  I am sticking with it, no problem.  I highly recommend this DVD if it has been a while since you have worked out.  I know it will help you get back on track to a better you.  Nobody else will do it for you.",1345939200,,991,3.765853658536585

3660963,3,B001JXPC14,Maybe Im just not that coordinated but I could not keep up with it.  I found myself just fumbling around looking dumb trying to keep up.  However I was moving around and it was definately a cardio workout.,1332115200,2,205,4.368421052631579
3660964,4,B001JXPC14,"I love this instructor. Been a great fan for many years. Now with instant on demand,no wait period for arrival for DVD. Purchase her workouts, you will not go wrong.

Thanks Amazon.",1329609600,,181,4.65625
3660965,5,B001JXPC14,"This is the 1st workout DVD I've ever used and I LOVE it. I have 2 left feet, no rhythm, and am very slow to pick up routine moves so this dvd is quite a challenge for me already BUT that's a very good thing as I won't be bored with it for a very long time and will continue using it until I can finally do all the moves with Petra and her team. It's not intimidating, however, and I love Petra Kolber as a workout instructor. She's attractive to look at, very fit, and energetic with a great speaking voice. I finally realized I need workout DVDs to workout at home since I no longer like speed walking around the park, am just not a gym bunny, and can't fit a treadmill into my room. My advice is to watch video clips of these DVDs here or elsewhere online to make certain you like the instructor, the moves, and the set before buying. I like everything about this DVD. The set is nice and wide open and perfect for a background so you focus on Petra. The choice of the 2 background females is good as well as they are not distracting so you focus on the moves. What I ended up doing was trying to copy Petra but failing often and mostly doing my own moves for a great short workout. I like that she does not do the same moves for very long as that gets really boring and monotonous and really isn't enjoyable for someone like me I realized. I even just ran in place after getting energized while watching her finish her 10-min cardio dance workout routine I couldn't follow along to. It's so nice to workout with others working out right in front of you on tv so there's no embarrassment if you can't do a move or look silly trying unlike real life.",1328313600,,1652,4.149532710280374
3660966,5,B001JXPC14,"I have purchased a lot of workout DVD's over the years, tried them once, got frustrated and stopped.  I needed a workout DVD that was a good basic, and I could figure out quickly.  This is the only one that fit the bill.

For me, the title should be, ""Cardio for those of you that used to do aerobics 20 years ago, and haven't done it since"" :)

PROS:
-> Customizable.  Because the sections start fast, and end fast (last section is stretching/cooldown), you can do one or many workouts to fit in your timeframe (from 15 minutes (10 min. workout + cooldown), to 25 minutes, to 45 minutes, to an 1:10).
-> Basic moves, easy to follow
-> Good sweat, but didn't look like I ran a marathon the first time I did the routines.
-> For those of us with basic dance/aerobics moves under our belt (even ones from the 80's), the DVD moves quickly, without a lot of commentary for instruction.  This means you can workout again and again without being frustrated with dialogue and slow intros.

CONS:
-> If you have not done aerobics before, or not taken dance classes as a kid, there aren't any instructions.  My advice: watch once doing the moves slowly (not a workout).  The moves are catchy enough that once through you'll have it down.
-> Typical skinny workout models.  These ladies don't even ""shine"" in the camera.

Good purchase; pleased with the product.",1326931200,,1352,4.522633744855967
3660967,4,B001JXPC14,"I really love petra's down to earth attitude and i love her energy. BUT...if you're a beginner and have no aerobics experience you have to pay close attention to keep up with memorizing choreography. Don't worry its not too complicated. I consider myself a beginner. I don't usually work out. But the workouts weren't so hard to do. I found myself struggling near the end to not give up. But that's because i don't usually work out.
The plus side, is that Petra does a great job at explaining things and not making you feel stupid. I totally recommend this video if you don't normally exercise but want to start somewhere. This is a great addition to a beginners collection.",1322611200,5,674,4.625
3660968,2,B001JXPC14,"I have been using walk at home DVD's since the summer.  I decided to get this DVD along with a few others for a variety to my workouts.  I found once she started, that even though the moves were easy, there were very few reps of each move.  She jumped from move to move so quickly I couldn't keep up or remember which moves I had just done to repeat them once they were connected.",1317859200,4,380,4.04
3660969,5,B001JXPC14,"Ok, I am truly out of shape and needed something that really was for beginners. I bought a few other dvds and was let down when I couldn't make it all the way through the routine. What a buzz-kill.

The great thing about this dvd for me is that I actually made it through the routine. Some might think ""Well then it must be too easy."" But this is not the case since you can mix and match the routines on the dvd and excercise anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour, plus a 5 minute stretch.

Knowing how out of shape I am, I have started with the 10 minute athletic routine and the 5 minute stretch. The great thing is that I don't dread doing it everyday so I keep coming back for more. Soon, I will add to my routine - maybe I'll do the 20 minutes of athletic cardio and the 5 minute stretch.

It feels great when you work-out but don't totally kill yourself with days worth of sore muscles. Every day, I feel stronger and more energized. I'm extremely pleased with this dvd.",1315699200,3,974,4.142857142857143
3660970,5,B001JXPC14,"Two great things happened for me this past year.

First, I discovered the books Seasoned Romance, Dr. Ruth's Sex at 50, and Grandpa Does Grandma, each of which helped me realize (to a larger extent than ever before) that seniors could still be excited about sex and romance. One of the main common threads running through each of SR's extraordinary chapter/story, I noticed especially, was the importance of exercise and fitness as a prerequisite to great lovemaking. Needless to say, that got my attention.

Which leads me to number two: I discovered several great exercise DVDs and books specifically for seniors, including  Petra Kolber's Cardio for Beginnings, as well as the Step by Step Strength Training. While both are not specificially for seniors, what I liked is that each is cohesive part of the process to take you from beginning to more advanced strength training.

More than ever, I've become such a cheerleader for seniors to (1) get back in the romance game and (2) focus on fitness.

Thanks, Petra, for the great work you are doing for seniors like me!",1312243200,2,1070,4.889502762430939

3660972,1,B001JXPC14,I agree with other 1 star reviews..this DVD is not for beginners...or for anyone other than the instructor and her team for that matter. I have tons of cardio DVDs and I consider myself at intermediate to advance level. The routines are too fast paced and it looks like you will need to watch it over and over and over just to get the moves right ! A cardio DVD should burn a lot of calories..but MUST be simple to follow - which this isnt. This applies to both the Athletic and Dance routines. It was a waste of money and time for me.,1298505600,5,535,4.153846153846154

I have tried other cardio videos from Jillian Michaels and Dancing with the Stars, and I found that either the moves were too difficult for me to follow or the workout was too hard for me as a beginner and I would just get discouraged. If you are like me, this video is definitely for you. I actually had fun, and Petra shows you all the moves for you before she puts them together in a routine. It seems a little old school, but if you are a beginner or someone who has had trouble keeping up with other cardio videos, then I think you will like this. Simple, but effective and fun! I definitely would recommend it.",1288828800,,720,4.077464788732394

Though she is really one of the best at cueing, meaning telling the exerciser WHAT to do, HOW and WHEN...and though this is easy to follow, basic and adjustable (both as a DVD and with choices in routines)--it also is that. Too routine. The stretch was so quick--it hardly was worth a mat on the floor. For a new person--this is a fabulous place to start.

  My exercise record is spotty, at best, so I'm very grateful for the sensible approach taken by ""Cardio for Beginners."" In addition to the longer programs offered, it also has two 10-minute routines.
These shorter sessions helped me build my stamina to where I can exercise for longer periods of time.
 Other cardio DVDs didn't work for me because they required much more stamina and strength than I had.  I would become discouraged and just stop trying.
  Thanks to the common sense approach of ""Cardio for Beginners"", I am now getting a workout that will do me some good.
  This is the best cardiovascular program I've seen so far and I have no hesitation in recommending it, not just for heart patients, but for those sensible people to want to prevent becoming that.",1254787200,5,897,4.6265822784810124

I used to be in good shape but the last 5 months I have let several things get in the way and now my cardio needs work. I can still run 3-5 miles (10 minute mile) without to much effort but I need additional cardio for variety, to help my endurance and for cross training. I was looking for a beginners cardio DVD that would talk me through all the moves and move at a slow beginners pace building up to a faster pace, this is not the DVD. When you start the workout she is already moving and before you can get ready she moves into the first move. Granted they may be beginner moves but the pace she is doing is advanced beginner. I have Tony Horton's Power 90 (not the PX90) and the cardio is great, but I want more routines. In Tony's video he leads you through a 5 minute warm up and dynamic stretch routine, then he takes you through a 30 minute cardio routine. The cardio is good and at a beginners pace, plus he talks you through alternative moves.
