6429506,3,B00KHJUVNK,"This film is a modern American tragedy. Beto (Mario Ardila Jr.) is in a gang and doing quite well. His family doesn't like the fact he is in a gang. When the army shows up at their door and waves the citizen carrot in front of the family Jesus (Manny Perez) orders his son Beto into the army. What starts out as a life filled with hope quickly crashes. The younger son (Angel Amaral) is coerced into a gang as the worse of all worlds come together.

I was actually expecting a war film watching a brigade of Latinos fight above and beyond the call of duty. However, this doesn't follow the Hollywood formula, for better or worse. The characters were done well, but the plot didn't seem tight, i.e. the film was missing a few scenes. Vivica A. Fox had a minor role as the mother of Angel's girlfriend (Paige Hurd) another aspect that developed rather quickly.

Parental Guidance: F-bomb, sex. No nudity.",1411776000,,902,4.4939024390243905

8659012,1,B00KHJUVNK,"There are not 20,000 illegal immigrants in the U.S. army 'desperate for US citizenship'.

To be allowed to enlist - you already stated that - one has to be a U.S. Citizen or a Permanent Resident.
In 2014 a special pilot program was started, MANVI, that allowed non-resident aliens (these are legal immigrants !) and illegal aliens to enlist IF they had unique/specialized knowledge. Eg. fluency in a middle-Eastern, Asian, or African language, or if they had needed medical/nursing expertise. MANVI was started, stopped, and restarted for a short period.
In 2015 Dreamers (DACA's) were allowed to enlist.
Ms. Kruishoop probably saw advertising for one of these programs.

Disappointing is that most journalists who saw the movie and reported about it, did not pick up on this incorrect information. They simply believed the story as given incl. the dishonest recruiters.
If there was indeed a case of a too young undocumented immigrant illegally recruited, who subsequently got killed in action, that would have been news. Any movie based on such a unique occurrence should have stated 'based on true events'.",1458518400,,1109,5.155555555555556

8659018,1,B00KHJUVNK,"Not realistic. The movie's states goal is to tell an authentic story about the struggle for naturalization and military service. The depiction of soldiers carries so many false realities:

1) The recruiter has a full goatee. Everyone who has done even a little research knows that NO soldier has a goatee. The other recruiter appears to be a man over sixty years old. This is also false. No Army SSG is over 60 years old.

2) the son joins the army and then right away is killed in combat. This is also not possible. New recruits must go through training and then are assigned to a unit and when that unit goes to war he goes to war too. This will at least take months but in most cases will take more than a year.

3) Illegal immigrants can't even join the Army in real life. It is illegal and the military thoroughly checks your background. In this movie an illegal alien joins the army. This is not possible.

I get it. The producers weren't shooting for accuracy. But their mistakes are so big that it leads me to believe ZERO research went into the main aspects of this movie.

It's pure propaganda for a low information group of people. Sorry.",1432857600,,1149,4.42654028436019

8659020,3,B00KHJUVNK,"This was a very interesting movie. The story kept my interest. The only problem was that it was a very depressing movie. In the end  everything goes terrible wrong and no one gets a happy ending. The lesson of the film seems to be trust no one. Recommended for fans of gritty, urban dramas.",1417046400,,290,4.37037037037037
