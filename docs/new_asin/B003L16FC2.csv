4134495,5,B003L16FC2,"Our Family Wedding is a good, clean cut film about a culture clash between Mexican and African American families who must come together as their kids are getting married.

The film includes Carlos Mencia, America Ferrera (Ugly Betty), Forrest Whitaker, Regina King, and Lance Gross (House of Payne).

Gross and Ferrera are set to get married and haven't yet told their parents about their plans until 3 weeks before the wedding. What begins is a culture clash between the two families, with the Mexican family taking over with their classic Mexican Catholic wedding traditions.

Overall, the movie is great. It's not an instant classic like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but it's up there. As a Hispanic myself, i couldn't help but laugh with how accurate they were with some of the traditions. The movie is a great comedy, and the reception seating parts are the best.

For a good laugh without the cussing and odd ""what does this sex scene have to do with the movie"", i would recommend Our Family Wedding. Good cast, good acting, and great overall movie, and Mencia is great in the movie.",1279324800,6,1086,4.76063829787234
4134496,2,B003L16FC2,"This movie is enjoyable but nothing too special to it.  The most interesting is the blending and interaction between two cultures that often times clash.  The cast does a good job of being believable and down to earth.  However, this is just another wedding love comedy similar to those you'd find from Tyler Perry.

The typical story arch where man and woman are in love and decide to get married.  However, families are different so there is instant friction.  Overcoming these barriers is a difficult task as everyone has doubts.  At one moment, the wedding appears to be off but finally, its on again.

Again, nothing special.  You get some good laughs, you'll enjoy the acting.  Nothing else.",1279324800,,697,4.830508474576271

Our Family Wedding was good, but it was barely good. As has been the case countless times in comedies and romantic comedies lately, it's the film's actors that save the film. Is it the writing or is it the directing and producing that is continuously falling short? It's often tough to say, but regardless of the condition of the screenplay, it's the producers, editors and directors who are the last ones to touch the project; I'm just saying.

Forrest Whitaker, as is probably to be expected, out-acts everyone in the film. He is just brilliant, and can steal any scene from any actor bold enough to share it with him. Here, he plays Brad, the father of Marcus (Lance Gross).

Marcus is happily engaged to Lucia (America Ferrera) and the two are madly in love. There's just one little problem; neither of them have told their parents. To make matters worse, they are both worried that the fact that
Marcus is black and Lucia is Hispanic, may play a part in causing an issue between their folks. Oh, and they are leaving the country, and have been secretly living together as well, which is a big no-no in Lucia's family.

Carlos Mencia plays Lucia's somewhat obsessive father, Miguel. If you know anything about Mencia, you will be blown away by him in this film. He really is a talented actor. However, I could not help but feel this part should have gone to George Lopez. Lopez is a master at this kind of comedy, and I felt that Mencia was being held back in the film, comedic-ally. He's got a dirty mouth, and not to type-cast him, but I'd rather see him in a film where he could use it frivolously.

There is a pretty funny scene early on in which the two dads meet each other, not knowing that their children are dating one another. Miguel owns his own towing company and Brad is a successful DJ. Living in California, the filmmakers clearly wanted them to be very good at their jobs, because they both have a ton of money, based on their extravagant homes and accessories. It's a stretch, but - okay, whatever. Miguel ends up towing Brad's nice car and the two get into a juvenile racial spat in the middle of the street.

Later that night, we meet the rest of the family and discover that Brad has a thing for younger women, as his date (Shannyn Sossamon), is about the same age as his son's fianc. Of course everyone is already sitting at the table and has been introduced to one another, by the time the two unsuspecting fathers join them and realize their unwanted debacle. More racial tension and some pretty descent laughs ensue.

Perhaps my favorite element the film had to offer was a side relationship that brews between Brad and his longtime best friend and lawyer, Angela, played by the amazing Regina King. Regina King, is long overdue a starring role. Do you hear that Tyler Perry? Sign her up!

Marcus's mother has been out of the picture for years, and Brad and Anglea are a very flirtatious couple of friends. We know right off the bat that they are into each other and that inevitably they will end up together. What I loved, is that the film doesn't painfully drag it out through a series of mindless tid-bitts, only to have them end up together in the last five minutes, for the sole purpose of an, ""ohhhhh"" moment. They get intimate somewhere in the middle, and this was a nice refreshing turn. King and Whitaker's chemistry together was extraordinary.

There are several good laughs to be found in the film, but there are plenty of missed opportunities as well. The one thing I definitely would have changed was the goat showing up to ruin the ending. Well, that was okay, but did it really have to eat Brad's Viagra and dry-hump Forrest Whitaker? Where did this come from? It was funny, but belonged in a Ben Stiller movie.",1272499200,7,4126,4.620218579234972
4134499,3,B003L16FC2,"A good movie, however there's no soundtrack info available. That's what I enjoyed the most of this movie, the music.",1269734400,3,116,4.85
4134500,3,B003L16FC2,"Our Family Wedding is a good movie, just know in advance that it's not a flat-out comedy.  Shot by the same director as 1999's ""The Wood"", it's mostly a warm movie about love and marriage, with a few funny scenes thrown in.

The best part about the film is its cast.  A gorgeous America Ferrera shines as Lucia, wife-to-be of future doctor Marcus Boyd (Lance Gross of House of Payne).  Great acting and chemistry between the two offer warm scenes that will make viewers both laugh and cry.  As a long time fan of Forest Whitaker, it was refreshing to see him in a comedy.  And is it just me, or does Regina King get even more lovely with each film?

While Chappelle Show veteran Charlie Murphy has limited screen time in the movie, he steals every scene that he's in.  Warren Sapp, Noel Gugliemi and Taye Diggs also make for funny moments, though all three get ""blink and you missed them"" roles (Diggs oddly isn't credited).

My biggest complaint with the movie is that the story has been done before.  Boy meets girl, parents get involved, culture clash ensues, all leading up to a predictable ending.  It's more Meet the Parents than Hangover, with only a few laugh out loud moments (though the reception seating montage is funny and clever).  What's interesting is that they really don't milk the ethnic differences as much as you'd assume that they would.

It isn't a comedy blockbuster, but it's still a good film, especially if you enjoyed movies like The Wood.  A good cast and some feel-good moments make it worth watching at least once before you decide on buying the DVD.",1269475200,19,1581,4.6

Instead, Black male and Mexican female got together and LET THE EXPLOSION BEGIN!!!  Whitaker's character didn't want it, because he thought his son was too young and he still couldn't forget his wife divorcing him and letting him have the son, with no argument or fight for him.  Mencia's father may not have liked Whitaker's son, because he wasn't Mexican, but he really didn't want to lose his daughter.  Especially one who didn't work and was going overseas to work for free.  Yeah, the stereotypical jokes were there, but this movie didn't rely heavy on them.  It did rely on the heart and the feelings of losing the child that a parent has taken care of for all those years.  I really dug this family movie!",1434326400,,846,4.593333333333334

For the first time in my life, I didn't want a romantic movie to end with happily-ever-after. The cliches were awful --- from the weak female protagonist to the goat that ate Viagra to the guy who didn't know how to use the lavatory ... it is better to take years to write an intelligent and entertaining script than to present viewers with something like this movie.

4134745,4,B003L16FC2,"Here's the deal:  OUR FAMILY WEDDING is predictable, often forced, sometimes contrived, nonsensical, cliche-driven, and even lame in spots--but you'll still watch this heartwarming comedy with a grin on your mug.  As love birds Marcus and Lucia (Lance Gross and the spectacular America Ferrera) plan their nuptials we witness a titanic clash of cultures, as Marcus is African-American, Lucia Hispanic.  And both papas (Forest Whitaker and Carlos Mencia) can barely disguise their inherent biases, believing their respective child can do much better.  Accordingly a mano-y-mano contest takes place, with both fathers going overboard to comedic contentment.  Both Whitaker and Mencia have some hysterical moments; I'm still giggling over the 'Boys Night Out' scene at the local watering hole.

Naturally the tension and lack of consensus over the wedding ceremony create a degenerating strain on Marcus and Lucia, culminating in predictable plot turns.  Yet OUR FAMILY WEDDING has such a feel-good silver lining you're looking forward to the inevitable butterflies and kittens ending.  Just be prepared for some really outrageous behaviour on the part of a goat before the ceremony begins.  Alas, even goats need some luvin'. . .

spicey hispanic father. Someone like Antonio Banderas who is too funny for words,and
he's fine as all hell. But all I want to know is why is there no Soundtrack for this movie. All of the music was slammin,but except for Earth,Wind and Fire I would like to know who the other artist are like the woman who was singing that great""two step"" song while Regina King and Forrest Whitaker were dancing to during the wedding reception. I can't get the song or the womans voice out of my head. I found that a lot of movies that come out are so-so, but they never have a soundtrack or at least
let us know who the artists are. I tried to see who they were while watching the ending credits. But the print was so small that you could not read it. So if anyone out there or even the folks behind this film could supply us with the names of all
of the artists who participated in performing on this film I would love to hear from you as to who you are and whether we can obtain all of the songs from the movie. We should start a website for the Unsung artists that perform songs for various movies and never get any recognition or at least to promote the songs so that we may purchase them from the artist themselves.

4134752,5,B003L16FC2,"The movie is touted as a comedy, but I found the serious sides more affecting, and in this way it reminded me of the great 70s films of the new American cinema like NASHVILLE.  The director must have been watching some Altman films to get across the special blend of inconsequential chitchat with real heartbreak, like the scene where the two sisters are dissing their mother at the bridal shop, not realizing that she's there listening it--the camera makes a slight lateral movement, revealing the mother's stricken face as she learns what the girls really think of her (that she's a fool with an empty life) and suddenly all the sadness she's been holding back manifests itself on her face.  Diana Maria Riva simply shines in this scene, and it's not the only one.  It's as if the screenwriters were thinking of it as her movie.

Though the others get some good scenes too, even when the acting's not so good.  Like Anjelah Johnson, who plays one of the sisters.  Kept thinking, what is she getting at? through the whole picture.  She is so unappealing I couldn't imagine why Lucia wanted her to be her bridesmaid.  Bt that's not really fair, it's just the part that was badly written, almost as though the original script had her playing a lesbian but halfway through the producers nipped it in the bud figuring that the target audience wouldn't care for it, and just left her character high and dry without any real story.

Forest Whitaker and Carlos Mencia were OK in their parts, but really it was the actors in the background who give the movie its edge.  My favorite, once-popular Shannyn Sossamon, is terrific, hilarious, playing a brief part as one of Forest whitaker's super young conquests, ""Ashley.""  I kept wishing she'd be back in the movie, but alas, she was just there playing a glorified cameo.  Here's looking at you, Shannyn Sossamon, and I hear great things about ROAD TO NOWHERE, maybe that will lead you back to being a fullfledged movie star once again,",1306713600,,1977,4.698550724637681

4134773,2,B003L16FC2,"This movie was surprisingly bad.  I say surprisingly because there were some very talented actors starring.  To get through the premise - as has been stated this was about a young African-American doctor to be getting married to a young Mexican American woman.  The two go through different kinds of 'culture shocks' and have to juggle their family, and some not-so-secret secrets to their respective families.  The end of the movie culminates in what's supposed to be laughs and tenderness all rolled up into one. But it fails on a variety of levels.  This movie's so forgettable that I don't even remember the character's names, just the actors that played them & the rolls.  BE WARNED though - I have some spoilers below.

First, the stereotypes were drab and the jokes weren't all that funny.  The talented actors mailed it in here but I wouldn't put all the blame on them because it quickly becomes clear that the directing in this movie was CRAP!  Terrible takes, terrible cuts, terrible moments.  This movie flowed like a 'first run' of an already played out, un-inspired script.  And that's a shame considering there was talent to work with.  In addition to this, the story was terrible.  All throughout this movie you could picture how un-imaginative the directors/writers were.  They didn't care about character development (""Uh, let's say he's going to Laos to help needy people or something so viewers like him..."").  They didn't care about building the past, even going into the respective cultures that they were dying to use as comedy.  NEITHER culture was adequately on display!  These clowns knew how they wanted the movie to end so they just tried to find a way to occupy the time leading up to the moment while throwing in a few 'laughs' for good measure.  The side stories were non-existent and not interesting.  Everyone in this seemed like a boring supporting character including the main characters.  Even America's sister in the movie... she could've had a decent role if she did more than just 'exist' in the eyes of the director/writer.  The movie was so bad I would've even accepted the over-played role of 'bitter angry sister that hates the groom' or something.  And what of the main character's (guy) mother?  What was the point of her even being in the movie?  Estranged and all... no development there either so why even bother?

The more I think about it the more I wonder how this was even turned into a movie & I want the dollar back that I used to rent it.  I hate to give too much away but in the case of this movie... LOOK AWAY NOW IF YOU STILL WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE--SPOILER... what the heck was up with the guy going to Laos?  Charlie Murphy was in it too - and Taye Diggs made a brief - like 2 second appearance - where he played a wishy-washy dweeb.  The girl?  She's not passionate about law & probably isn't sure what she really wants so it sure sounds like a great idea to get married and move to Laos with this guy that's just now meeting your family and that apparently she doesn't know so well.  Has to be assuring too that the guy's father was diddling one of her chilhood friends (of course she's older now... like maybe 23 or so?)  And then in the end Mencia warms up to him and gives his blessing?  Really?  Whitaker's character's near impossible to like too.  The goat scene was as forced as they come; par for the course in this movie.  I actually ended up fast-forwarding through it... too painful.  I mean this movie found a way for me to lose respect for Regina King's character (in the movie) too.

Two stars, mainly because the raw talent (not applied) of some of the actors made it somewhat possible to struggle to the end.  But I mean... what the heck were these actor's thinking?  This was terrible.  Bribery?  Cashing in an IOU?  What?  You can see better comedy by staring at ant-hills.  Want drama?  Be cruel and bring a magnifying glass...",1283990400,,3905,4.595652173913043

4134779,1,B003L16FC2,"Pretty stupid movie, badly directed, stupid dialogue, totally artificial, it became more and more annoying until I finally had to just turn it off. How these moron comedies get made is beyond me. What happened to intelligent romantic comedies like When Harry Met Sally, Goodbye Girl (the original), Tootsie, Sleepless in Seattle, Sideways, Hitch (one of the all time best written comedies), the great character comedies, i.e., Napoleon Dynamite? Juno? Annie Hall, Manhattan, Wedding Banquet, Five Funerals and a Wedding, or funny very comedies like Ghosbusters, My Blue Heaven, Father of the Bride, Anger Management, Dan In Real Life, As Good As It Gets, Spanglish, Something Gotta Give, Analyze This, Analyaze That, Broadway Danny Rose, Hannah and her Sisters, Phat Girlz, great Brazilian comedy If I Were You, action comedies like the Rush Hour series, or comedies like Norbert, White Chicks, classic Midnight Run, Foul Play? Or classics like Billy Wilder's still amazing Some Like It Hot. Those were cleverly written, terrific comdies unlike this fake-nothingness-pretending-soooo-hard-to-be-clever-but-actually-an-unfunny-supposed-to-be-comedy-that-falls-flat-on-its-butt.

4134782,2,B003L16FC2,"I really like America Ferrera and Forest Whitaker and consider them both good actors, but I did not like this movie. It tried way too hard to be funny - and it missed the mark completely.  I never laughed once during this film, and the scenes that were supposed to be ""touching"" were stale.  I spent most of my time looking at my watch and waiting for the movie to end.

Centering around the surprise, impending marriage between a nice Hispanic girl and an African-American soon-to-be doctor, the movie tries to expose the humor between the two cultures when they attempt to become family.  The result is shallow characters, predictability, and stupid situations.

4134785,2,B003L16FC2,"I recently rented this movie via Comcast's OnDemand service because the preview made the film look really funny.  Unfortunately, the preview included all the ""good parts.""  The rest of the movie appeared to be a copycat of My Big Fat Greek Wedding (""MBFGW"") slanted a bit so as to include some more raunchy jokes, a sprinkling of ethnic humor, and some random ""filler"" scenes (such as an extended baseball game scene and a bar scene with no point).  It didn't reach the humor of Wedding Crashers/American Pie ""raunchy"" nor did it reach the clever, ironic humor of MBFGW.  Instead, it just floundered around, going nowhere.

Storyline in a sentence:  Black man and hispanic woman want to marry and their family initially freaks out because of the culture clash and eventually deals with it.

The jokes were sporadic and mostly related to sexual humor and/or the culture clash. For instance, the hispanic grandmother cracks jokes in Spanish about being one Mexican short for a Mexican wedding.  Likewise, Carlos Mencia jokes about black people and credit scores.  At another point, a goat is brought to the wedding and it devours a bottle of Viagra and humps the black guy's dad.  None of it is particularly funny.

Also, unlike MBFGW, the characters in this film are not very intriguing.  Indeed, the father of the groom is a metro-sexual, ladies' man addicted to Viagra and young girls.  He is shown sleeping around constantly and having issues with marriage in general.  He goes nuts about Carlos Mencia touching his car the wrong way and using his personal bathroom.

For some reason, it didn't strike a chord with me because it seemed like they were trying too hard to craft this character.  It just wasn't funny.  Get a better plot if you're venturing into the raunchy humor.  As to the racial issues, the same problem.

Overall, I'm disappointed.  This is a mediocre film.  I give it a ""C -"" because, while bland, it was not so terrible that I had to turn it off (i.e. Lower Learning; Wicker Man -- two of the worst films ever produced).",1279497600,6,2042,4.760683760683761
