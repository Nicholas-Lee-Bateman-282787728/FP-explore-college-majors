1188334,5,B000005XN6,"I saw this movie on TV many years ago and while it wasn't the scariest of horror shows, I thought the acting was great.  The acting in this movie wasn't obviously acting -- the actors were natural and acted like anyone would act under the circumstances. Paul LeMat was great and was believable as a man who was trying too hard to get the son of a girlfriend to like him.  Anyone who's dated a person with a young child would relate.  The son was believable as a kid who wasn't particularly impressed with his mother's boyfriend, and a kid who was trying hard to not like the boyfriend, and a kid who would be perfectly happy if the boyfriend disappeared out of his and his mother's lives.  A fun creep show.",1371168000,2,707,4.333333333333333
1188335,2,B000005XN6,"I remember watching part of this flick on TV when I was a kid. I never finished it and I was always intrigued by a horror movie that starred Ralphie from A Christmas Story. Though I'm happy Shout Factory released this, I must say this is not a very good movie. It has a certain charm, but there are some really odd camera angles, the dialogue seems pretty stilted, there are some great leaps in logic, and the 'surprise' at the end could've been executed better. I will say that Stephen McHattie plays a great 'bad guy', and I wish more time was spent with his 'character'. But I don't regret my purchase, I've wanted to watch or at least finish this movie for years and now I have. The disc lacks a lot of special features, but with a flick like this why bother? I can't recommend this, but if you're dying to see it like I was, wait till the price point drops a bit. $21 is a bit steep for this one, even if it's on blu ray.",1364774400,,926,4.121546961325967
1188336,5,B000005XN6,Peter billingsley is a great little child actor here. I never thought this movie would ever be out on DVD. But with bluray and DVD combo it's even better.,1359763200,,154,4.344827586206897
1188337,4,B000005XN6,"A young boy named Billy (Peter Billingsly) is on vacation with his divorced mother Sally(Catherine Hicks) and her boyfriend Mike (Paul LaMat) to Death Valley but what seems like a harmless fun vacation at first until Billy discovered something in an abandoned RV which was the scene of a hideous crime as now the family is being stalked by a deranged maniac.

Co-starring Wilford Brimley and Stephen McHattie, this is an exciting and quite overlooked 1982 psychological horror thriller that has gained a small cult following over the years thanks to cable and TV to rental viewings. It's avery well acted especially by Peter who made his debut film appearance before becoming more famous in the next year's Christmas Story. Catherine Hicks is quite lovely as usual here and Paul La Mat is likable as the mom's boyfriend, the film is Hitchcockian at times yet violent too. I saw this movie on cable when i was 5 and thought it was creepy and still do think it's an enjoyable chiller no doubt, worth seeing.

Scream/Shout Factory has done a nice solid transfer to blu-ray with very good picture and sound yet the only extras is an audio commentary from the director, trailer and TV Spot.",1356652800,,1185,4.775609756097561
1188338,4,B000005XN6,"I don't know how the timing could be more perfect for Shout Factory to release the 1980's thriller ""Death Valley"" on Blu-ray. This is the film that introduced the world to little Peter ""Ralphie"" Billingsley of ""A Christmas Story"" fame. Is it destiny or great marketing foresight that brings this lesser-known gem to store shelves during the very season the actor is seen the most in?

""Death Valley"" centers on a young boy named Billy who accidentally stumbles upon a murder scene while taking a road trip with his mother and her new boyfriend. He unknowingly picks up the only thing that can tie the killer to the location of the crime - a necklace dropped during the struggle with the victim. Billy's mother and her boyfriend attempt to bring the psychopath to justice before the murderer tracks the child down.

This is one of those forgotten films of the 1980s. It's not bad by any means. It just didn't make enough of an impact on moviegoers to grant it cult classic status. Many would consider it a slasher film and they have every right to. There are graphic scenes of blood and violence, but not enough to place it in a category with ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween.""

The cast of ""Death Valley"" is relatively impressive in hindsight. Many of them hadn't hit their successful strides yet and were still on their journey to stardom. Catherine Hicks (""7th Heaven,"" ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"") plays Billy's mother. Veteran actor Edward Herrmann (""Gilmore Girls,"" ""The Lost Boys"") has a bit role as Billy's father. Wilfred Brimley (""The Firm,"" ""Cocoon"") plays the town sheriff.

The audio and video quality for this high-definition edition of ""Death Valley"" will thrill viewers. Anyone who's seen it either in the theater or on video will attest to the fact that it's never looked so great. It would've been nice to get a 5.1 surround sound mix out of the new release, but you can't win them all.

There's not much here in the way of special features for the movie. Audio commentary is provided by director Dick Richards. A theatrical trailer and TV spot that gives away entirely too much of the film's plot are also included. If I had seen this trailer before watching the movie, I would've been furious.

The ""Death Valley"" Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack will provide genre fans and ordinary movie viewers some thrills and entertainment. It's interesting to see Peter Billingsley perform in this type of atmosphere after spending so many years seeing him as baby-faced Ralphie in the safety of ""A Christmas Story."" I might have to have a ""Three Degrees of 'A Christmas Story'"" party this year and screen ""Death Valley,"" ""A Christmas Story"" and ""Black Christmas,"" which were both directed by Bob Clark.",1354838400,4,2707,4.773504273504273
1188339,4,B000005XN6,"I've been looking for this movie for quite a while now, I knew Peter Billingsly played in it but for some reason couldn't find it until today.
 it will have you sitting at the end of your seat,  because you don't know what to expect next (the part i especially remember is the  greedy baby sitter, and also when the young guy hid in the back of the car).also the  twist that you couldn't have foreseen.
A must see, believe me you wouldn't be disappointed.

1188340,5,B000005XN6,"""Death Valley"" is by far one of my favorite 80's slasher flicks,
The plot is very believable and the acting is above par with actors such as Paul Le Mat'The Burning Bed',Catherine Hicks' Childs Play',Peter Billingsley 'A Christmas story' and Stephen McHattie who is perfect as the slasher.

A mother and son go to Death Valley with The mother's new boyfriend hoping that the son and her new Beau will make nice with each other. The boy is very inquisitive and nosy resulting in him getting too close for comfort to a Serial killer who's very handy with a switchblade.

It becomes a cat and Mouse game between the two all the while he is trying to get the adults to believe him. It isn't a gore fest the kills are good,effective and the action and suspense are superb. There is a little some comic relief in the form of an obese babysitter who manages to wrangle all the kids candy and food away from him,her question of the night ""Are You Going To Eat That?"" am delighted that this Gem is now on not just DVD but Blu Ray.
it's a 5 Star film.",1167436800,8,1041,4.333333333333333
1188341,4,B000005XN6,"I have search high and low for a new copy of this without spending a fortune.  Nonetheless, I had to go with used for a small price.  The reason I like this film is I remember seeing it when I was a young kid and I like the desert, out of cities movies.  This is a great family vaction slash horror flick.  The acting is not so great but the story and flow of the movie keeps you going.  I hope to see this one come to DVD.",1019606400,5,423,3.7613636363636362
1188342,3,B000005XN6,"I don't know about most people but I tend to like this 1 star movie for once.  I think its great Its not boring at any time, and its not dull its just a good movie not scary. When it was released in 1982 it received horrible reviews.  Thsi is Peter Billingsley's first movie he is the kid who is in the all time favorite christmas movie "" A Christmas Story"" as if like nobody knew that.  It has a great cast though Paul lemat, the mother from Childs Play, The guy from the quaker oats commercials,and many more. Country western movie I like those kinds of movies when they go out of the city and film in the desert I just like the movie and its not shakespeare or anything the acting is just like any regular person would act a good movie though.",993081600,5,746,4.13103448275862
1188343,2,B000005XN6,This is a standard stalk n'slash type film from the early 80's but what I liked about it is the fact that instead of having a female college student as per the course the main character is a young kid.  Peter Billingsley is refreshing to watch as the boy who encounters a maniac while on holiday in Arizona.  In one scene his overweight and continually hungry babysitter goes out for some ice cream not knowing that the killer is lurking nearby.  Having a desert location made a nice change of scenery too.,981072000,,506,4.478260869565218
1188344,5,B000005XN6,"I really enjoyed this obscure movie! It took years to see it finally released to a Blu Ray/DVD combo pack. It was well worth the wait! If lots of blood and gore are your thing...then stay away! As well, this plays more like a thriller...even though there are elements of a slaher genre movie. This movie has a simple premise: The young actor from 'A Christmas Story' does a fine job as Billy, a child that lifts a piece of evidence from a crime scene. Then the serial killer targets Billy and his family! Needless to say, Billy's vacation turns into a fight for survival!
I think it's original in the fact that the killer's primary target is a child. However, this is NOT a stupid kid...he's intelligent!
The acting is fine and the plot keeps you interested throughout! It's good for what it is! Check it out!",1414022400,,809,4.472972972972973

It was directed by Dick Richards and written by Richard Rothstein.

1188353,4,B000005XN6,DEATH VALLEY is a decently engaging slasher movie with good acting and an eerie atmosphere. However the out-of-nowhere ending leaves a bad taste and prevents this film from being a true genre gem.,1377388800,,196,4.96969696969697

7903465,5,B000005XN6,I remember seeing this movie when I was younger late at night on tv. There are no other movies compared to this one...there's so much suspense that it keeps you engaged with every scene. Stephen Mchattie's role as the killer is great...his chiseled features and sly look gives him that villain facade. Peter Billingsly role as Billy is great and cute....There are very few movies where the killer is on a mission to murder a child. I recommend this film for horror lovers looking for suspense and a little gore...there's some throat slashing in this film. And there's a twist to the ending...there is more than one killer.,1429660800,,622,4.768518518518518

7903468,1,B000005XN6,When I was little this movie use to terrify me. Watching it now doesn't scare me at all & I wish I knew why it use to. It's an almost boring Horror flick that's only worth watching to see Peter Billingsley in a completely different role than A Christmas Story. I sat & watched it now because it was free & it's been a couple of years since I last saw it. I think the best thing about the movies was all the memories it brung back while watching it,1423785600,,447,3.977777777777778
