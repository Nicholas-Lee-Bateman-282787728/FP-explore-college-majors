8565296,2,B00BBCIPXA,"Stunningly bad thriller about a couple whose lives are torn apart after the death of the wife's father.  They bring his ashes home and the husband becomes convinced that his father-in-law is haunting him and possessing his wife.  The acting is hilariously awful, especially during the more overwrought scenes in the second half--but unless you enjoy so-bad-they're-funny movies you should stay away from this one.  If you do decide to watch Cruel Will a few drinks first might enhance enjoyment.",1404086400,,495,5.1625
8565297,1,B00BBCIPXA,"The acting in this is absolutely terrible, by far one of the worst I have seen in awhile. Do not waste your time or your money on this one. I would have given this less than one star if possible.",1402531200,,195,3.9
8565298,1,B00BBCIPXA,"Sorry to disagree with Video Views, but this was horrible. The screenplay was completely idiotic and random, the dialog was horrible and the acting was forced and completely amateurish. Like the other reviewer, I quickly grew impatient and had a hard time getting through this mess. For the sake of context, I love horror movies and therefore never have high expectations regarding elements such as plot, character development, dialogue, etc. But this was just too much. Stay away from this one - there are plenty of others out there and most of them will satisfy much more than this one. If I hadn't paid to rent this disaster I would have turned it off after 30 minutes.",1402444800,2,672,4.752136752136752
8565299,1,B00BBCIPXA,"Lily (Marissa Pistone) is married to Paul (Arron Kinser) and attends culinary school. When her father Adrian (Doug Jones) dies and is cremated, Paul believes he is haunted by his evil ghost. Lily blames Paul for separating her from her father as the two did not get along. The film is filled with odd going-ons and a multitude of flashbacks with uneven performances.

The film is presented in a way that doesn't grab and hold your interest. After an hour of the same old stuff, I found myself growing impatient. A 2013 film and already it is available at Walmart in a 15 pact of films, ""15 American Horror Stories.""

No sex or nudity.",1388448000,3,634,4.552631578947368
8565300,5,B00BBCIPXA,"Tragedy strikes married couple Lily and Paul, when her father dies. Lily brings home the urn, housing her father's cremated remains, forcing Paul to, on a daily basis, face his despised father-in-law. Soon after, the lid to the urn mysteriously disappears and Paul experiences unearthly events which, like a twisted joke, only he can see.

""Cruel Will"" tells the story of Paul and Lily. We are not given much of a background regarding their marriage but you assume they are a happy couple. But their marriage soon becomes shaken after Lily receives a call with news that her dad has died. After the funeral Lily brings her dad's ashes home with her in an urn but when the lid somehow disappears it is Paul who begins seeing things and acting strange.

Some of the flashbacks indicate that the father was somewhat abusive to Lily and he did not like Paul at all which seems to be the reason Paul is the one being harassed. To talk more about what happens in the film would only spoil it for those waiting to see it so I am not going to go into anymore details here but I can tell you that the story does have a few twists and turns along the way which you won't see coming. ""Cruel Will"" is a fast moving psychological thriller that keeps you on the edge, there's also some frightening moments in the film as well.

Acting wise everyone did a terrific job in the film. Arron Kinser has perhaps the most difficult role playing Paul since it is him that is effected and haunted, Arron does a terrific job and his range from being normal one minute to being on the edge of insanity was brilliant. Marissa Pistone is also amazing as Lily, she too has her fair share of emotions to express and she really delivers here. The supporting cast all did a great job in the film as well including the always incredible Doug Jones who plays Adrian, the father who is determined to wreak havoc even in the afterlife. Production wise the film looks fantastic considering it was done on a small budget. First time Writer/Director, Arthur Romeo deserves a lot of credit here as well. Not only does he have the ability to tell a scary and convincing story but his direction was flawless as well.

""Cruel Will"" is an effective, solid thriller from beginning to end, it generates plenty of suspense and scares and it keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The film also has an amazing ending as well which really topped off an already terrific film. If you like this sorting of supernatural/psychological thriller then I highly recommend checking this out when it comes to DVD on April 2nd.",1363219200,4,2581,4.5203426124197
