1831018,4,B0000897DY,Cheats is a great movie that most people won't probably see.......I was watching HBO one day and came in the middle of the movie.......I thought it was a great movie......watched it from the beginning another day........and loved it...this is a great coming of age movie.....it reminded me of the movie Cheaters.  4 guys that make it through high school and just barely getting away with it.  Trevor Fehrman is great as Handsome Davis........and the 3 others......Watch for Mary Tyler Moore in this movie too.....,1054598400,,513,5.095238095238095
1831019,5,B0000897DY,"This movie is really funny. It's packed with tons of funny quotes and moments you won't forget. While the DVD doesn't have many extras except a short film about the real Cheats who based the story on their life.
The story goes like this: Handsome and his freinds are cheaters, they get into trouble when they stop cheating and conflict between the freinds grows. It is a funny comedy with no real meaning but it's definately gonna make you laugh.
Bottomline: If you like old adam sandler movies (ie: happy gilmore & billy madison) and enjoy a good comedy this is definately one you will like.",1049846400,3,592,4.59433962264151
1831020,5,B0000897DY,this movie should inspire all teenagers to work smarter not harder. I was sooo inspired that I increased my cheating accomplishments by 75% now Im cheating my way to the top and not stopping for anything! Crib sheets are the best invention since they rock! My best friend just legally changed his name to Na-Na-na- Napplebee! Thats how much we love this movie! Cheats Cheats Cheats Cheats! Long live the cheats! Hoo-raw!  Buy this movie~ Itll change your life.,1049846400,2,460,4.822784810126582
1831021,5,B0000897DY,"This is the best movie ever! It is a laugh a minute comdey.  The boys in the film had the best plans so they could cheat on every test.  It is great.  They do a great job acting and it is just a fun film.  Every teenager should see this movie, it is the best!",1048982400,,259,3.6545454545454548
1831022,5,B0000897DY,"i usually hate teen movies, but i happened to catch this on [tv] last week and loved it. it has everything thats great about a comedy: very 3-d characters (like Handsome and Cribmaster, for example), a witty script, great plot, and its completely hilarious. you just cant help liking every one of the characters in some way, whether it's the completely anal principal, the ""i hate everything"" Victor, or, of course, the all around ""nice guy"" Handsome, who can pull off just about anything when he wants to. all in all, i think this movie is definitely worth watching and even buying, and i cant wait until the DVD comes out! and by the way, it actually has underlying morals etc. and the end is great. they did it PERFECTLY. anyway, this movie KICKS...",1046304000,5,752,4.619402985074627
1831023,5,B0000897DY,"I loved this movie.  It was very entertaining to see how Handsom, Victor, Sammy, and Applebee would get themselves out of the holes they dug themselves deeper and deeper into.  Which includes pretending they're gay, promising 15-year-olds sexual favors from girls they don't know, and my favorite: taking off their shirts.  This movie was so funny!  I was laughing out loud almost non-stop.  Another reason to watch this movie: Trevor Fehrman!",1045094400,,443,5.183098591549296
1831054,5,B0000897DY,Was happy to get these product as i cant find it anywhere else and have added this to my collection gleefully,1395878400,,109,4.238095238095238

1831056,5,B0000897DY,"I'm really not sure why this movie isn't more well known. Cheats is a ridiculously funny film based on a true story, and it has some really perfect moments. It's not a really 'feel-good' ending (it's vaguely ""Stand By Me""-ish, inasmuch as a high-school comedy can be compared to a Stephen King story). My copy arrived quickly and in excellent shape.",1391299200,,349,4.737704918032787
1831057,5,B0000897DY,Thanks for the getting me my movie quickly. It was in perfect condition and was the perfect movie for a movie night. Thanks,1385424000,,123,4.391304347826087
1831058,4,B0000897DY,"if your in the mood for something light, funny and entertaining - then you should def watch it. The movie does not have any love interest plot - Minimal sexual references to the pt that its not uncomfortable to watch with a parent. overall a cute movie",1378166400,,252,4.382978723404255
1831059,5,B0000897DY,very good funny movie.. based on actural events.. amazing.. very funny movie. Iam glad I now own it.. there should be a part 2.,1362182400,,127,4.333333333333333
1831060,3,B0000897DY,I bought this because the story line sounded intriguing and it had Joey Lawrence in the cast.  Everybody has different reasons for watching a movie and you may love this for the subject matter.  I just expected better acting and role/story development from the cast and movie description.,1359676800,,288,4.979166666666667
1831061,5,B0000897DY,My husband loved this movie in high school. I looked everywhere for it and glad I finally found it here. I got it on time and it works fine. It made him happy that I found it.,1327017600,,175,3.7567567567567566
1831062,5,B0000897DY,"It did not take to long for it to come in the mail, and the movies is one of the best high school comedy's you could ever see. Not only is it unique and not about getting laid but the movie is more accurate to the subject of cheating because the guy who wrote and directed the film was the one that cheated so its more truthful then most other movies about cheating",1235260800,,365,4.013698630136986
1831063,4,B0000897DY,"This story is a basic one.  It's about the kids we all knew in school.  It's about the three or four schemers who would do anything to shirk responsibility and flout the rules as they cheated their way through classes.  If it wasn't a crib-sheet, it was writing on their hands.  Maybe it was getting to class early and writing on the desk.  We all knew that guy, and in this movie that guy is a master the likes of which we never experienced.

Handsome Davis (Trevor Fehrman) is the leader of a foursome of cheating friends.  He's a charismatic figure who has been cheating with one friend, Sammy, since Kindergarten, and has picked up two accomplices in High School, Victor and Applebee (who writes crazy small).

They are legendary at school, like Ferris Bueller, and everyone knows of their exploits.  But when the principal has a locksmith change the locks on every door in the school, the boys secret weapon, a duplicate janitor's key, becomes a paperweight.

Before the boys move towards graduation, they will find that cheating on everything will require more than they had imagined.  They'll have to lie, steal, and trick people into helping them.  They'll also learn some harsh lessons about growing up along the way.  If it isn't tricking the foreign janitor, or coming up with a ridiculous story about a candy bar alibi, it's some other insane, wacky situation that the boys manage to wiggle out of like Houdini.  Watching Handsome play his Physics teacher, the principal, his friends, little kids, and even his own father is hilarious.  Fehrman nailed the role with his suave confidence and conniving leadership abilities, a persona that commands more attention than any school administrator, let alone any students who dares consider themselves a peer.

For the final cheat alone, I think this movie is well worth it.  Even if the movie teaches an eventual lesson about the perils of cheating, it also happens to teach the viewer something serious, something beneficial.  The boys make wonderful use of audio mnemonics to pull off the greatest cheat of all time.  It's a great instructional tool for studying, and a technique that should be more widely used throughout academics.",1212537600,,2192,4.89159891598916
1831064,4,B0000897DY,"true story  thats a plus, good actors, another plus.
dont recall seeing many girls in this
a plus to some.
fun storyline
not behavoir I would encourage--but have no problem enjoying it in a movie
deffinatly worth a few bucks, as long as these charters don't turn into role models for youngsters
grinably funny, not lol",1210377600,,318,4.678571428571429
1831065,5,B0000897DY,"well i liked this movie, it is one of my favorite almost unheard of comedys. I would also like to add that the guy Bob Loblaw needs to spend his time doing something better with his life... i mean who besides someone who is middle-aged, living in their parent's basement, and waits on line all day took get a harry potter book, even bothers to write something that long.",1178755200,,370,4.3768115942028984
1831066,3,B0000897DY,"I do not understand why reviewers have to insult those who liked this movie. Is it a classic comedy? Not by any means, but it worked for what it was.

I like many other reviewers stumbled upon this on television (HBO). I laughed pretty hard. My wife watched with me and she also found it hilarious.

HBO goes into ruts with the movies it put on, and we ended up watching this a few times, b/c we simply found it funny and enjoyable.

The writing is fun, the acting is good, and it was shot pretty well. If you want a comedy that has a good chance at making you laugh, and do not expect a masterpiece, you just might find this movie as fun as my wife and I did.",1155600000,,660,4.022900763358779
1831067,5,B0000897DY,"This movie is without a doubt, a hidden classic of recent years that hardly anyone has heard of. Reminds me of 80's classics like The Chocolate War and even Three O'Clock High. You can't even compare it to Ferris Bueller. Bueller stands alone. And I am not saying it is as good or better than the above mentioned films but it makes a valiant effort. I applaud the cast and crew of this film for attempting something different. The world needs another awful Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson comedy like we need another ice age.",1125014400,5,520,4.484210526315789
1831068,1,B0000897DY,"Cheats is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen. Besides the mind-numbing absence of plot and meaningful character development, the humor is also painfully trite. I knew this movie was horrible 5 minutes in, but I continued to watch it only to see what Martin Starr was up to after Freaks and Geeks. In the end, I felt embarassed for the writer/director of this miserable endeavor. Please don't waste your time on this nonsense. Learn from my mistake.",1122163200,4,464,4.7407407407407405
1831069,1,B0000897DY,"I wanted to write this for two crucial reasons: 1) to warn off any Freaks and Geeks fans hoping for one last look at Haverchuck and 2) to counteract the fact that this feces currently had perfect ratings.

Go ahead and pick this one up if you hate yourself and want to make certain that at least an hour and a half of your life is filled with inane dialogue, plot holes that have achieved their own gravity (um, doesn't a principal review the awards given out at graduation?), and a costly disregard for logical connection.

Throughout the majority of the film, I pictured the director/screenwriter (because no one else would likely touch this cesspit) as a stoned, delusional twit who felt his memories of being kick ass in high school would sustain a film. To hell with character, plot, and all that other b.s. that ""the clones"" want... I've been unfortunate enough to know far too many of this type, but usually, they just bother you at a bar or when you're trying to work. Somehow this one's been allowed to write/direct a movie about his asinine life.

I was drawn to watch this solely because of the depression associated with the loss of Freaks and Geeks. I needed more Bill, and in a few shining nanoseconds of the film, Martin Starr delivered. He's the only thing that prevented me from turning it off and scratching the DVD with my bare fingernails. If only someone else involved with this film would have really watched and understood that show...

Finally, if what I've said hasn't deterred you, look at the positive reviews. Nearly all of them start with the same anecdote of psuedo-slackerism - ""I was so wasted, and I pict [sic] up this killer litle [sic] flick,"" or ""me and my buddys [sic] used to act just liek [sic] these dudes..."" - do you really want to be counted among this crowd?",1122163200,4,1802,4.569659442724459
1831070,5,B0000897DY,"This has got to be one of my favorite movies ever, I don't think I've ever laughed as hard as a I did while watching this movie. Everything in it was just so hilarious, especially the song at the end ""Crippled elves do dance around a devil covered by blue dress,"" the things they get themselves into is great. I reccomend this movie from anyone looking to get away from those regular movies!",1110412800,4,391,4.36986301369863
1831071,4,B0000897DY,"I kind of stumbled across this movie just recently, and I loved it! Luckily it had barely started, and it just looked interesting so I stuck around.

1831088,3,B0000897DY,"This movie wanted to be Ferris Bueller, but it didn't quite make it.  It could have been better, but the script just didn't make it.  I have no doubt that the cast was up to the challenge, but the solutions some of the characters used to get out of their situations were just stupid (""I'll take the test RIGHT NOW!"" while ripping his shirt off? Why is this funny?).  I would have found the movie a lot funnier if the schemes the students were up to came across as something that could even remotely work.  This movie comes across as a story written for 6th graders by a 6th grader.",1057449600,3,581,4.254545454545455
1831089,4,B0000897DY,"On the surface, Cheats may look like just another teen movie, but look more clsoely and you'll see why it's becoming a cult classic for people of all ages. The movie follows the lives of four high school students who attempt to cheat their way through high school at any cost. The leader of the pack, Handsome Davis has cheated his way through school even since Kindergarten, and now has it down to a science. The boys have a janitor's key, which makes it easy to break into any classroom and steal every exam. but what happens when the principal catches on and changes the locks? The boys are determined to pull off a huge cheat in order to show others in the school that they are still the Kings of cheating. What ensues is a brilliant, bizairre and completely hilarious romp through what these teens hope will be their final year of high school. The genius of the movie is matched in its characters. Handsome Davis, the leader of the pack, who will not back down, refuses and study and will go to any length to pass the tests he deems ""unpassable"" (all of them). His best friend Sammy, a fellow cheater since Kindergarten, who decides he wants to go legit, Applebee, the invaluable ""kid who writes crazy small"" and Victor, a particularly incendiary teen who stops at nothing (even forgoing human decency) to continue cheat will delight you with their sharp wit and sense of mischief. You can't help but feel a slight sense of envy for these boys who can get away with anything, and you'll love finding out what happens when they don't.",1055808000,5,1538,4.555956678700361

They have a scheme going on between em and they take a teachers grade book,then piss on it and then their teacher cancels their senior trip. The crib master and the muscle have back and forth issues with each other but Martin Star(Applebee the cribmaster) goes in and confesses that his buddy did the wrong.
