7794039,1,0967752558,"That's all I can say about this set. If I could give it zero stars I would.

I bought this when it first came out.

Wish I'd waited for others to buy it and review it first.",1346284800,,173,3.6486486486486487
7794040,2,0967752558,"First, I must point out a blatant lie listed in the editorial description of Krav Maga as "" the official system of self defense for U.S. Law Enforcement"". IT IS NOT. There is no self defense system designated as such.
After you get past the false statements and hype you discover a system of BASIC martial arts. The system named Krav Maga is an eclectic blend of oriental techniques of self defense from several traditional styles of martial arts. This system was designed and put together after the formation of the country of Isreal in 1948. It is not a bad system of techniques and tactics of self defense. It deals primarily with armed encounters, which for the most part are a losing battle by the best of martial artist.
If you must learn practical and effective techniques for realistic self defense then you will need to train several times a week and with a dedicated training partner. These tapes can act as a guide to assist in your training; but not as a substitute to  your training and practice. A qualified instructor is always the best option.
Good luck in your quest for effective self defense; may I refer you to my ""Listmania"" (Self Defense) of several books related to your search.",1014163200,19,1201,4.63849765258216
7794041,4,0967752558,"I am currently a Krav Maga student and have studied numerous martial arts for years.  If you're new to martial arts, or just thinking about it for self-defense purposes, this is a good set for you.  The beauty of Krav Maga is that they don't waste any motion; there's no fanciness, fluff or ""traditional"" moves that are useless.  It is hardcore and to the point.
The tapes are expertly produced and the techniques are clearly and repeatedly demonstrated from various angles, in slo-mo and real time.  They definitely know how to make martial arts videos.  Of course, they also adhere to the maxim that all martial arts video sets must contain schlocky 80s metal music, but hey: a small dent.
You don't have to be an acrobat to practice Krav Maga and I recommend it to any of my students who want to learn street self-defense.  A couple of disclaimers on this set, though, because I want you to know what you're getting:
a) This set is geared towards people with little or no martial arts/fighting experience.  An entire tape is devoted to how to punch, kick, elbow, etc.  If you have some experience, you can probably skip this one.  I already knew all this.
b) There aren't a ton of hand to hand techniques.  Really, the one tape deals with grabs from a variety of angles and the pluck defense/counterstrike.  Don't get me wrong: they're GREAT and some of the best I've seen, but they don't move much beyond that.  Everybody should have this tape of the set, though.
c) The three remaining tapes are: knife defenses, gun defenses and Krav Maga history.  The history one is interesting if unnecessary; the knife and gun defenses are solid.
Make sure you have a training partner when you buy tape sets; sure you can watch it, but if you don't drill it you really don't know how to do it.  It can be your buddy or your wife, but physically DO the stuff.  Repeatedly.
A good start, but for those of us with some experience, I hope the next set is more geared towards having tons of different techniques--a progressive, patterned move from beginner level to intermediate, etc.",1004054400,51,2072,4.607629427792916
7794042,5,0967752558,I work at a school that teaches Krav maga.  I teach kung fu their.  When I'm not teaching or working I sometimes wach a class.  I'm continually amazed at how praticle and simple the defences are.  It floors me.  I'm not out to bash other arts.  But in my time I have seen some defences that will more likely get you hurt or dead than anything else.  Krav Maga contiualy take into acount the danger and finds a logical safe way to combat agenst it. What ever it takes to stay alive.  It isn't  perfect but I have never seen anything so practical and simple. By this tape it may truly save your life.,998524800,5,598,4.175438596491228
7794043,3,0967752558,"I've had the fortune of training in several quality arts over the past 27 years, earning belts in a few (which really doesn't mean anything in the streets). Coming from a hard street background, with alot of exposure to gangs, made me a bit critical. Isreali Krav Maga, which I observed in Isreal as a member of the NEPSAW anti-terrorist program, is good. Unfortunately, this video program DOESN'T depict true Isreali Krav Maga. High kicks are shown as defense against knife attacks, each exposing the inner thigh to the opponent blade. Various other instances of training turned me off, to which the chief instructor told me that these tapes represent only the basics. I firmly believe that you start with the right stuff to end with the right stuff. Higher teachings must build upon the basics rather than contradict them, especially where people's lives are at stake.",982368000,39,870,4.925170068027211
7794044,5,0967752558,This is the best trainingvideos I have ever seen.  Top quality in the production and the best system for defensive tactics.  A must for anybody interested in self-defense.,950313600,9,171,5.071428571428571
