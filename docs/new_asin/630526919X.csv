1001619,2,630526919X,"I'm really getting fed up with you, Don Wilson. So far, I've seen fifteen of your movies, and the payoff hasn't been great. Yet you keep convincing me to come back because of this spark of potential I see in you. ""Terminal Rush"" here has that spark, as it was one of the few films of yours that I was actually excited about. I should have known that you were likely to let me down again, with this humorless&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>&nbsp;knockoff that makes the works of Jean-Claude Van Damme seem stellar by comparison. When will I learn?

The story: When the Hoover Dam is overtaken by hostage-holding terrorists (led by Michael Anderson Jr. of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Greatest-Story-Ever-Told/dp/B0002BO05S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Greatest Story Ever Told</a>&nbsp;and Roddy Piper of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/They-Live/dp/B0000AOX0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">They Live</a>), it's up to Native American policeman Jacob Harper (Wilson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>&nbsp;series) to infiltrate the monument and disarm the criminals.

I'm not very tolerant of racial miscasting, and the fact that Wilson's character is so very boring doesn't help. The real attractions here are Michael Anderson and Roddy Piper, though their appeal is likewise limited. At the best, they echo Gary Busey and Tommy Lee Jones in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Siege/dp/0790732238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Siege</a>, but Piper isn't given much room to play with his character and none of their deeds are quite nefarious enough to make them stand out. The entire film's like that: the premise is interesting enough to warrant a look, but in the end, the movie is directed so lifelessly (and yet so seriously) that it's going to take a very specific fan to like it.

The same goes for the action, but with ol' Don, I've come to expect that. ""Terminal Rush"" has fewer fight scenes and generally less action than the average Wilson flick, with a bit of kicking and shooting but only three full hand-to-hand fights. The movie presents Don with two ready opponents - henchman/karateka Michael Bernardo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Virtual-Combat/dp/6305473463/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Virtual Combat</a>) and pro wrestler/judoka Roddy Piper - but though one showdown is marginally better than the other, they're both basically crud.

Among the Don Wilson films I've watched, this one ranks low, because it's just no fun to watch. Even the other movies had greater appeal based on their silly scripts, but ""Terminal Rush"" is a sleeping pill for me. At the 12-minute mark, I was already bored, and I would've stopped watching had I known it wasn't going to improve. Don, no doubt I'll end up watching a few more of your features, but if we ever meet in real life, I might just demand my money back.",1336435200,4,3207,6.382488479262673
1001620,3,630526919X,This was an entertaining movie. The acting was alright. A good watch when nothing else is on.,1238544000,,93,4.529411764705882
7886498,4,630526919X,"This marks the 2nd time that I have watched a Don Wilson flick, the first being Ring of Fire 3. Terminal Rush is vastly superior to that. The action in TR is pretty good. I have seen fight clips from many of his other movies and the camerawork during these skirmishes allows you to see most of the moves which is a big plus and improvement. Most of the actors do great in their roles. The one guy sounds exactly like Samuel L. Jackson. The movie has great cinematography. The movie is quite cliched but there is a nice twist at the end. Recommended if you are a fan of Don's kicking abilities or are a fan of comfortable cinema that understands its identity and relishes it.",1515715200,,674,4.31496062992126

7886501,1,630526919X,"I've like some other of Don's movies, just fun martial arts action, but this one is both really poorly scripted and poorly acted.  And Don's moves in this movie look slow and silly, as well, for some reason.  Couldn't get past about half way.",1470268800,,242,4.4772727272727275
