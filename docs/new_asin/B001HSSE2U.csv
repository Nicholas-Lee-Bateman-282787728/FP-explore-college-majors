8309503,5,B001HSSE2U,"Amongst the budget DVDs that you find on the $2 shelf of retailers who aren't known for being DVD retailers, you sometimes find a really entertaining film.  This one isn't relying on some unknown star at that time who has gone on to become something big who was in it for two minutes to put on the cover.  This one actually is full of actors who you've never heard of.  But they do a pretty decent job (for a likely made for cable TV movie).  This was made in 2008 so there's still time some of these unknowns may become successful.  The writing in parts is a little weak, the story is about a woman approaching her 30's, obsessed with becoming more than just a professional worker, and friend to her boss who she is the personal assistant for in his public relations agency.  At times she shows glimpses of being a bit insane, especially at the end, I think it would have been better if she was simply mentally normal but obsessed, and prepared to do whatever it takes to get her man.  By the way as is often the case with these budget DVD cover images, there is no scene of her in a boardroom with a knife behind her back in the entire movie.  I don't know if there has ever been a US release but you can also get this with region 4 (Australia), if you are American you would still need a multizone DVD player to view it, but it doesn't have subtitles and is in English which seemed to be an issue with some of the other reviewers on this movie's page.

I liked the Rachel Partson (main) character, as I mentioned other than her becoming more and more insane at the end, she was quite a good villain.  Some of her methods weren't exactly ones that wouldn't get her caught in their aftermath, such as ringing the nanny from the office phone, but the movie never really goes in that direction to have realistic consequences for her actions. But Josie Davis does a great job, as does Chris Potter, as David Wescott the object of her obsession as does the little girl who plays his daughter.  Rachel Hunter has a few scenes (probably the only person you've heard of but more as the young New Zealand model who was married to Rod Stewart for a while than as an actress).

Spoilers follow if you haven't seen this yet - I actually wonder if she wouldn't have been successful if she'd simply given it a bit more time and hadn't forced the issue with the kiss in New York.  David's wife had only just died within a week or so ago, and he was obviously not yet at the stage where he even thinks about anyone else other than her.  If she'd just sort of moved into the unofficial mother role for the daughter, who adored her and was just a good friend for David while doing that for a while, perhaps he might have developed feelings for her, I mean she was good looking and seemed to come across as being intelligent and everything.  I also think David didn't handle that whole thing very professionally. You've got to remember he had no idea she murdered his wife, and he should have taken on board that he's sent the wrong signals when she gives him a kiss on the lips, such as not booking her a separate hotel room so it was clear when her role as temporary nanny was over for the day, buying her a watch inside a necklace style jewelry box, inviting her to dinner or to the petting zoo thing just because his daughter asks. Really he would have been up for wrongful dismissal firing her the next work day after unsubstantiated accusations by a female employee who he should have picked up was also flirting with him at times so perhaps may also be manipulating him. The whole final scenes with the gun in the hotel just didn't seem consistent with Rachel up until then.

I found the roommate to be a bit odd and wondered if there were some deleted scenes that told us she was brain damaged thereby acting like a spoilt child whose parent has got called into work with her opening scenes tantrum when Rachel wouldn't go see a movie with her there and then.  Then later she is using some dating chat site and a message tells her a virus has suddenly infected her computer so instead of thinking, gees I better not use this site anymore, she uses her roommates laptop and loads it up.

But Perfect Assistant is definitely a fun movie, you should check it out!",1448064000,2,4251,4.325786163522013

I checked my invoice only to find out later that the seller mentioned it would not play in a standard US dvd player but a multi region one! It was my mistake for not reading the whole description but at the same time the seller could've stated that in BIGGER print! However the movie itself (which I watched on tv) is a classic Lifetime ""chick flick"" full of the usual and more often predictable twists and turns of a woman who tries to manipulate her way into a man's heart!

8309508,4,B001HSSE2U,"Rachel (Josie Davis), 30, is the perfect assistant to her boss David (Chris Potter), 42. For the past 3 years, she's done everything in her power to help David manage everything that comes with running a boutique advertising agency.

The problem is... she's fallen hopelessly in love with him in the process. She's never acted on her feelings because David is married to a beautiful woman named CAROL, 38, and has a young daughter, ISABELLE, 7. But when Carol contracts encephalitis, an impatient Rachel begins to feel that maybe this is her chance to show David that she should be the one he comes home to every night.

Rachel does her best to help David through his wife's illness, gets closer to his daughter, and even orchestrates situations where she can be alone with him. David welcomes her help, unknowingly fostering a growing obsession in Rachel that will ultimately end in disaster when she finds out he doesn't feel the same way... ...The Perfect Assistant ( Secretary 2 )",1390521600,3,984,4.816568047337278
8309509,4,B001HSSE2U,"Rachel Parsons (Josie Davis) is the perfect assistant to the company boss, David Wescott (Chris Potter). The only problem is that she has become infatuated with him and wants to be his wife - but he already has a beautiful wife Isabelle (Veronique-Natale Szalankiewicz) who is seriously ill, and a lovely little daughter Carol (Jennifer Marcil): Isabelle is easily disposed of in hospital. Rachel shares her house with her cousin Nora (Deborah Pollitt), who becomes aware of Rachel's obsession, confronts her, and is pushed down a flight of stairs as a result to silence her. David also has a partner in the company in Judith Manion (Rachel Hunter) who could prove troublesome so is poisoned, though not fatally. The Wescotts employ a nanny for Carol, so she has to be got out of the way so that Rachel can spend a weekend in New York with David. Judith and company employee Wally (Jason Harper) also now become suspicious and tell David. Although David fires Rachel she deludes herself into believing that it was so that he could romance her without her being an employee of his company. The main shortcoming of the plot in my mind was the almost complete absence of police, despite these sinister goings-on. Otherwise it was quite an intriguing movie, which was directed by Douglas Jackson.",1351382400,,1292,4.877272727272727
8309510,4,B001HSSE2U,"I didn't think she was anything but annoying on Charles in Charge, but this movie shows Josie Davis as a capable adult actress, if not bearing more than a passing resemblance to a brunette version of Kirsten Dunst.  This movie features William R. Moses as her ""love"" interest, as is common in a lot of Lifetime movies, but this one is so much fun that you can't give it a bad rating!  I see the DVD is region 2, but that's okay, because it's worth waiting for.  Josie is by far the best thing about this movie because she is funny--be it intentionally or not--and I love the fact that she hates Rachel Hunter's character.  Hell, I hate Rachel Hunter because the only hot thing about her is her legs, so I'm naturally rooting for our humorously appealing psycho queen.  If you like Rose McGowan in Devil in the Flesh or the Tori Spelling vehicle Mother, May I Sleep with Danger--both humorous Lifetime movies in their own rites--you will LOVE The Perfect Assistant.  A fun time to be had by all.",1325462400,,994,4.464088397790055
8309511,5,B001HSSE2U,"Don't know what to do after your boss fires you? Go audition in the next sequel of ""Single White Female"":&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Single-White-Female-Single-White-Female-2-The-Psycho/dp/B000ASDFJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Single White Female/Single White Female 2: The Psycho</a>!

That is what the lead actress, Rachel, could have done when her misconceptions about a perceived love-relationship with her boss David met with an end.

Movie starts out like a slow afternoon soap opera on TV but picks up pace steadily as you follow obsessive-stalker-personal assistant Rachel into her inner reasons for pursuing her married boss, David. She thinks he loves her when in fact he merely treats her like a ""friend"" (that naughty word!), and as his personal assistant whose life evolves around work. Rachel's overbearing kindness turns out to be obsessive, misconceived notions of a ""love"" that doesn't exist. She wriggles her way into David's life by murdering his wife, comforting him ad infinitum, clinches a company contract for him through blackmail, poisons her female co-worker and lies to his daughter's nanny - just so that Rachel can be close to him. Coincidences pile up David fires Rachel from her job as his personal assistant. She doesn't take it too well, stalks him, declares her love for him at his house and even after being rejected again, she turns up unannounced at a company dinner with a gun, shoots a female co-worker. Rachel ends up in prison, writing to David that soon, they will be together.

Part 3 of SWF is waiting for Rachel. Stop obsessing about married men, Rachel. This woman is quite good-looking enough to ensnare any man she wants but prefers only David - a married man. Strange inner workings of a would-be mistress who fantasies of becoming a wife of someone already married.
