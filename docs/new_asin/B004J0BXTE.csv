4389853,5,B004J0BXTE,"I laughed so hard! If you are worried that this isn't as funny as their old show from Comedy central then let me put your mind as ease these episodes are easily in my opinion tighter and better then the old Mystery Science Theater show! The jokes are spot on, striking at the psychological moment of hilarity! I am from L.A. so seeing my home town chopped up by lousy editing until it makes no since where people are or how either slowly or quickly the ended up there was awesome! If you are a fan of this sort of thing pick this up it will knock your socks off for real!",1364083200,3,571,4.107142857142857

The chemistry amongst the cast, and between them and the crowd really make it more than just another good movie riffing.  I would love to see them live before they stop touring.  (Bought tickets to see them last year and the theater cancelled the show, so pissed)  I adore MST and this is a great reincarnation of the riffing art form.  I wish all the CTs were live, seeing them perform is even better than the silhouettes!",1362614400,,546,4.4646464646464645

4389856,5,B004J0BXTE,"This is like the Mitchell of Cinematic Titanic, in my opinion anyway.

Mitchell is definitely my favorite MST3k episode.  And I'm pretty sure this is my favorite Cinematic Titanic (although ""Danger on Tiki Island"" is still in the running.

I don't think any other episode (or even this movie) has made me laugh as much as Mitchell did.  But as a cheesy 70s action movie with killin' and fightin', it's got the same energy as this movie.

At first, I didn't like the idea of them doing a movie in front of a live audience, but this movie totally changed my mind on that.  It was really cool watching their interplay.  At one point, Mary Jo messes up a joke (to the point where I still don't know what it was supposed to be).  After she sheepishly says ""Sorry,"" Frank says ""That was a good one too.""  Great moment.

Mary Jo:
I did not like her as the unpleasant Pearl Forrester character, but listening to her in this movie reminds me of her as the cute girl writer who can still remember the first joke she wrote for MST3k.

J. Elvis Weinstein:
I got into MST3k after he left the show, and couldn't quite get into him when I finally rewatched the oldest episodes.  But here he is very funny.  He and Mary Jo fit in so perfectly with the rest of the group.

Joel Hodgson, Trace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff:
I don't think any MST3k fan needs to be told that these guys are awesome.  Of course I want to hear them riffing together again.  And when Trace makes a joke so inappropriate that everybody complains...  it's awesome!

The live audience:
At one point, the audience laughed, and I realized I had missed the joke, so I rewound back.  But it turned out there was no joke.  They were just laughing at something preposterous within the movie itself!  A very pleasant surprise.

If someone had given me this movie for free, I still would have spent the bucks on it, just to be sure these guys keep doing more movies.

I can't wait for Doll Squad!",1348358400,15,1941,4.390449438202247
4389857,5,B004J0BXTE,I love the Cinematic Titanic movie riffs. East Meets Watts is laugh out loud funny and it has a good re-watch factor. Definitely worth fifteen bucks.,1342483200,3,149,4.769230769230769
4389858,5,B004J0BXTE,"""East Meets Watts"" is 1974's retitled ""Dynamite Brothers,"" here given the business by the good people at Cinematic Titanic. Cinematic Titanic is a reincarnation of some of the original minds behind Mystery Science Theater 3000, headed by MST3K creator Joel Hodgson, and also featuring Trace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff, Mary Jo Pehl, and J. Elvis Weinstein. This particular installment was filmed live in front of an audience, and I think that really adds to the enjoyment and dynamism of the viewing experience.

The film was directed by Al Adamson which is enough to make veteran B-movie aficionados run for cover. This film was designed to capitalize on both the martial arts craze and the blaxploitation trend that were both staples of mid-70's B-movie fare, and was filmed on location in Watts. The plot is inconsequential to the humor of the movie, but concerns Larry Chin (Alan Tang) coming to California to search for his brother. Chin meets up with Stud Brown (Timothy Brown, who you may recognize from the ""M*A*S*H"" series) who are shackled together and join forces against both drug dealers and Burke (veteran B-movie actor Aldo Ray,) a sleazy cop. Needless to say there are romance angles, lots of action (much of it pointless,) and an amazing finale that just about everyone will see coming.

The movie itself would be quite painful without the Cinematic Titanic treatment, but with the humor added by the riffmasters, it's a real treat for MST3K fans or for anyone who likes a little levity and suffering with their action movies.",1307232000,,1540,4.988326848249027
4389859,5,B004J0BXTE,"Cinematic Titanic - Live, ""East Meets Watts"":  I'm honored to leave the first feedback for this title.  I have all of the Cinematic Titanic releases, and this one is great.  I was reluctant to buy it - the title didn't grab me. This one is ""live"" -which means the 'gang' performed the riffs in-front of a live audience.
Lots of great thought out riffs.  I don't want to give any of them away, I will say - at one point in the movie - someone says the 'N' word - and Trace gives a brilliant physical reaction.
I find too many do not know what Cinematic Titanic is.  It's the original cast from Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or MST3K), with creator of both Joel Hodgson and other cast members, Trace Beaulieu,
J. Elvis Weinstein, Frank Conniff and Mary Jo Pehl. There are other DVDs of Cinematic that are 'studio' versions - and in those - the five stand in sillouette in front of the screen (no puppets here).
There are some trailers on youtube - so you can view a taste of these great and clever shows.  My favorites (besides this one) are ""The Doomsday Machine"", ""Santa Claus Conquers The Martians"" (different riffs than the MST3K version), and my ultimate favorite (including MST3K's Volumes 1-20) is Cinematic Titanic's ""The Oozing Skull"".  The riffs on that one are just supurb!
I was at Cinematic Titanic - Live in Concord NH, and I loved the meet and greet afterward.  I spoke with Trace, and he is even nicer in person! He said there will most likely be more Cinematic Titanic DVDs in the future.
I love this DVD, and think you will too.

4389867,5,B004J0BXTE,"This was hillarious.

Between this and RiffTrax Live - Sharknado, I think this was the better live riff, probably because of the audience and the nature of the movie. This seems more like the classic MST3k type episode. I look forward to seeing more from Cinematic Titanic.",1437264000,,273,4.808510638297872

East Meets Watts, a typical 1970's Kung Fu drive-in staple provides plenty of great opportunities for snark. I was laughing out loud at the commentary.

The movie, set in the 70s, is about two fugitives from the law, and Asian and an African American guy, traveling from SF to LA for some reason (it's not really clear why).  It's chock-full of awful racial insults, horrible acting, ridiculous kung fu fights....oh my goodness it's just great in it's 70s-esq awfulness.

Sometimes the comics can't get the jokes out because they're laughing too hard, sometimes it sounds like a little adlibing is thrown in. Even though they're all reading off a script, these little things add to the fun of the show. The reviewer who equates this as CT's Mitchell is dead on and I rank this DVD right up there with that MST3K episode. Both movies are unintentionally hilarious in their own right too and that helps makes them both instant classics.

Highly recommend this even if you're unsure of the live aspect of the show. I was at first and I was pleasantly surprised with the performance.

PS The legendary jazz organist Charles Earland did the soundtrack to this movie. It was a shock to hear an incredible artist who made genuinely great albums like ""Black Talk!"" do the score to this.
