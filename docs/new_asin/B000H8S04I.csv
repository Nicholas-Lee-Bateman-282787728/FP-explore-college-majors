8137676,5,B000H8S04I,"A female cousin of mine had a hernia when she was young.  Because of that, I had no idea that mostly men get them.  So this is a male-dominant problem like autism, prostate cancer, and some paraphilias.  The work shows more male hernia sufferers, but a woman is included.
While I sympathize with any senior facing Alzheimer's, when I watched that installation, I could be distant as I am a younger person.  However, this segment said that 10% of all males will have it in their lives.  It also said overweight men are especially prone to it.  Since it hit close to home, I especially paid attention.
If you like hairy-chested men, this may delight or frustrate you.  The work is full of doctors whose chest hair can be seen outside of their V-necked tops.  This may feel like a tease to some.
The good news is that hernia surgeries are becoming quicker.  The bad news is that a person can keep having them and for some it's congenital.
In other installations, all the doctors were from North Carolina.  Thus, I assumed the series was made by some news channel over there.  Unlike that, most of the doctors seen here live or work in my hometown of Chicago.  The work does show one physician who works at Brown University, the best college on the planet.
The work says $3.5 billion is spent on hernia operations each year.  I wish that they gave an estimate to how much an individual operation costs.  This work, like many in the series, encourages viewers to be pro-active.  Unfortunately, if one doesn't have good health insurance, or no health insurance at all, one may be very likely to push this off, I imagine.",1203552000,,1614,4.555555555555555
