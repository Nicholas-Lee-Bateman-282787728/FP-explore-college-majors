5967947,5,B00F5ZHI14,"My girls (ages 3 and 6) love Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and we have a ton of the episodes on our DVR, including all of the episodes from this DVD. The show is great and a big hit in our house. It always has a positive message and teaches kids about a variety of subjects through the gang's adventures and interaction with your child. This is a great episode and my 3 year old is always asking for ""Super Mickey"".

Super Adventure is a fun episode about the gang transforming into super heroes to battle against super villain Megamort and his sidekick, Power-Pants Pete.  The bad guys are shrinking everything and the gang springs into action to stop them.  The episode has a very ""Super Heroes"" feel to it and is done very well.

This DVD contains the main title episode plus three great bonus episodes. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:
1. Super Adventure!
2. Aye, Aye, Captain Mickey - The gang must find Mickey's lost lucky coin using a submarine.
3. Mickey's Mousekersize - Pete gets a lesson in exercising from the gang.
4. Mickey's Little Parade - The gang must find some wind-up toys that were wound too tight and ran away.",1386115200,48,1214,4.479638009049774

5967949,5,B00F5ZHI14,"The main show on this nearly two-hour DVD is about Mickey and his Friends being granted super powers to transform their town back to normal after Power-Pants Pete shrinks everything.  With the help of each other, the mouseketools, and input from your child, they can conquer any obstacle!  I expected my five year old son to be comfortable with talking back to the television, but I was surprised to see my seven and nine year old daughters chiming in as well.  In fact, they asked to watch it multiple times.  My kids love all four episodes on this disc.  The included trading cards are a nice bonus too!",1385164800,14,605,4.564814814814815

5967980,5,B00F5ZHI14,"I originally bought this DVD because my husband loves superheroes and so I thought this would be a great combination between that and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse which would be perfect for our two year old daughter.  I was right - they both love this DVD.  My daughter loves this DVD and it's one of her favorite that she watches more than some of the other ones.

There are 4 episodes on here:
1. Super Adventure
2. Aye, Aye, Captain Mickey!
3. Mickey's Mousekersize!
4. Mickey's Little Parade

Overall, the DVD is almost two hours long and it's great.  I love that the Mousekersize episode makes my daughter want to imitate the characters and exercise with them.  And she also loves singing and dancing with the other episodes.  This is a great buy and I would highly recommend for any children that love Mickey Mouse!",1483488000,8,815,4.618055555555555

5968003,5,B00F5ZHI14,"For the past 6 months I have been making bi-weekly trips to our public library and take out 4 children's DVD's for our 2 day a week babysitting of our now 18 month old grandchild. Of all the different DVD's we have viewed those with Elmo, Baby Einstein and the Mickey Mouse Club are the favorite of our grandson and have, in my estimation, the best production values and stories. Unfortunately library copies are subject to damage and mishandling so I have decided to acquire new copies of the favorites. Certainty there is an expense involved but with another grandchild due in a few months these DVD's will get good use and there is a thriving market for good condition videos on a certain auction site I frequent.

The MM Clubhouse series features very colorful animation, catchy songs and story lines that educate and entertain. The Disney folk have put a considerable amount of creative talent into making these videos and I recommend they for your young children.",1454889600,2,969,4.767857142857143

5968059,5,B00F5ZHI14,I never ever thought I'd say anything positive about a Disney children's show but Mickey's Clubhouse has proven me a liar. The characters are the traditional Mickey characters (no odious princesses) and the show is engaging and teaches some important toddler/preschool skills. It's a shame a whole season costs more than a pair of shoes.,1394928000,,337,5.1454545454545455

2. Aye, Aye, Captain Mickey!
3. Mickey's Mousekersize!
4. Mickey's Little Parade
