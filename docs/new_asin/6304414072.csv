876702,4,6304414072,"I love the steely, snowy look of this movie, and its bizarre, infinitely compelling love story.  Diane Keaton, one of the best screen actresses ever, here portrays a woman who is teetering on madness; that we never  really know her state of sanity or Mel Gibson's true intentions only adds  to the mystery and desperateness of the story, which by all accounts is  true.  The warmth of the warden's home, at Christmastime no less,  contrasted with the chill of the Pittsburgh snow and the brutality  contained within that prison, is remarkably effective.  Gillian Armstrong  directs like a painter with a brush, and every scene contains a stark  beauty.  I thought the chemistry between Gibson and Keaton was electric.  Mark Isham's spare and original score punctuates the tragedy and isolation  in these characters in a very effective way; it is a musical score that  never panders or overstates, but quietly does the trick.  It is not a  classic film, but it does pull you along, and there are plenty of wise  choices along the way.  If you do not mind taking an emotional journey  without an uplift, this is for you.",945993600,20,1118,4.7894736842105265
876703,3,6304414072,"I bought this video because I wanted to complete my collection of everything Mel Gibson has ever made. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie.  People who think it is slow have to realize how repressed the times  were, and how repressed Mrs. Soffel herself was. The darkness and slow pace  reflect Mrs. Soffel's spiritual and personal emptiness and depression. In  the movie, she has just recovered from a three month bout of intense  depression. Ed Biddle himself has barely escaped a suicide attempt, and  talks continuously of his own death. Both these people are desperately  unhappy and lonely. They turn to one another in their desperation and cling  to one another for what they both know is just a brief, brief time, one  last futile attempt to grasp some beauty and truth and meaning in their  lives. I found the character of Ed Biddle to be richly contradictory and  complicated. He was a very confused and lonely person. So was Mrs. Soffel.  Their flight from their own emptiness is so poignant and sad, I don't see  how anyone could fail to be touched by this movie.",943142400,2,1079,4.705882352941177
876754,5,6304414072,"I simply love this film.  This was one of Mel Gibson's earlier performances and came out around the time I really discovered him.  Everything about this film from the winter scenery and sleigh rides to the haunting beautiful music, stirs my soul.  I can imagine Diane Keaton preparing for this role and playing the suppressed female of 1901.  Women had no rights nor voice, you were simply seen and not heard, not taken seriously.  Ed made Mrs. Soffel feel special, feel needed and wanted, and possibly loved. In a sense they both fulfulled each others needs in a way which changed history.  The film has a cozyness to it as well, the part where the trio is at the Peterson house.  That scene gave the Biddles a human aspect, it showed them as normal loving people, shedding their criminal persona just for a short while. Mrs. Soffel gave them a chance to look inside themselves and be something different, something special.  And who can resist Mel Gibson?",1454371200,,957,4.688622754491018

I enjoyed this film so much because these were the early years for Mel. I never cared for most of Mel's movies that followed. Yes, he did  win awards for ""Braveheart"" and ""The Last Temptation of Christ, but some of is action films didn't honor his talent. I will always consider this film some of Mel's best work.

876761,5,6304414072,Young Mel Gibson and beautiful Diane Keaton.  Base on a true story that takes place in and around Pennsylvania's Eastern Prison at the turn of the 19th century.  A tragic love story that compels you to watch to the very last moment. Mel GIbson is at his vulnerable best and Diane Keaton turns in a fine performance as a woman struggling with in a marriage that is crushing her heart and spirit.,1409961600,,394,4.458333333333333

876763,3,6304414072,Diane Keaton showed her talent as Mrs. Soffel with a strong dramatic role.  Mrs. Soffel is the wife of the warden of a prison where Ed and Jack are being held until their execution.  (Mel Gibson and Matthew Modine play the brothers convicted of murder)  Although married with children she falls victim to the charms of Ed and as the romance blossoms he convinces him to aid in their escape and go on the run with them as they attempt to flee to Canada.  Good performance by Edward Herrmann as her husband who can see it coming and feels helpless to stop it.,1408233600,2,557,4.378640776699029
876806,5,6304414072,"The fact that this is based on a true story seems to deepen the sad beauty of this film.

876809,5,6304414072,"Mrs. Soffel, 1984.  This dark and gritty 112 minute romantic melodrama is a prime example of the wonderful pictures made by Hollywood in the 1980s.  The movie is set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1901, still repressive Victorian times, and recounts a true story that then shocked society.  (And quite likely still would.)

Kate Soffel (Diane Keaton) is married to stuffy Warden Peter Soffel, (Edward Herrmann), of Pittsburgh's Allegheny County Jail, then as now, a handsome structure designed by noted architect Henry Hobson Richardson.  (Constructed between 1884-88, it was a jail until 1995; is now used by juvenile and family courts.)  Mrs. Soffel regularly creeps around her husband's jail, attempting to reform the convicts.  Feminists must believe she is unhappy, and unfulfilled; middle-class women with a servant or two hadn't much to do in those days.  Still, she apparently doesn't know she's unhappy.  But, she would then have been called a ""neurasthenic:"" a nervous, anxious, often depressed middle-class woman who vents her unhappiness in mysterious illnesses.  (Kate is just coming off a three month layup as the film opens.) However, on her rounds she meets the dangerously attractive working class death row murderer Ed Biddle (Mel Gibson), a young man who claims he's been wrongly convicted.  She is reborn, helps him and his brother escape, and flees with them.

The film, which was written by Ron Nyswaner (PHILADELPHIA), and directed by the Australian Gillian Armstrong (MY BRILLIANT CAREER), was, inexplicably, neither a critical nor a commercial success at its release. Viewers apparently hated the beautifully presented, dark look of turn of the century Pittsburgh, but that's historically accurate: the city was one of the earliest exemplars of the Industrial Revolution on this continent - you can see the smoke stacks belching dark--and paid for it in environmental degradation.  The city fathers had to keep the street lights burning 24/7.  The film also doesn't do a lot of explaining: it never really tells us just how guilty the Biddle brothers were,  makes no moral judgments on the love affair at its heart.

The cast of this crime drama is superb.  Keaton carries it with a complex, many-layered portrait of a woman initially as imprisoned as the men in her husband's jail.  She was already an Oscar-winner for her famous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie-Hall/dp/B002XZNHG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie Hall</a>, made with her former lover at the time, Woody Allen; she made a slew of other comedies with Allen, too.  But she was an important character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather-Collection/dp/B000NTPDSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather Collection </a>, and made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reds/dp/B00367XA1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reds</a>&nbsp;with her later lover Warren Beatty.  There's no question but that she's got movie star voltage, and a thousand watt smile that lightens and tenderizes her material.  The young Australian-American Gibson was  beautiful; the camera often lingers lovingly on him, and, as he had recently made the terrific anti-war movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gallipoli/dp/B000J420W8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gallipoli</a>, and the fine&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Year-of-Living-Dangerously/dp/B000NIDS12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Year of Living Dangerously</a>, he still had a lot of credibility, which the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lethal-Weapon-4-Film-Favorites/dp/B000U1ZV8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lethal Weapon: 4 Film Favorites</a>&nbsp;series had not yet begun to damage.  As the warden, Edward Herrmann, who worked with Keaton on REDS, gives us another of his clueless upper-class gentlemen. As Ed Biddle's brother Jack, Matthew Modine, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight-Rises/dp/B009LRE040/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight Rises</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transporter-2/dp/B000I9YX7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transporter 2</a>), gives us a good picture of a younger brother not always happily in thrall to an elder, forced to be a voyeur at his brother's romance with the warden's wife.  Detective Buck McGovern was played by Terry O'Quinn.  And, as one of the prison guards, we have the recently-passed Canadian supporting actor Maury Chaykin, with his sharp comic timing,(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Cousin-Vinny/dp/B00517F03Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Cousin Vinny</a>).

The director ably uses the comic timing of all her principals in telling her dark tale.  Furthermore, Armstrong and her cinematographer Russell Boyd give us beautifully composed, but oppressive visions of Pittsburgh. Then crisp scenes of a train journey through snow, filmed in Michigan.  And joyous-in-their-own-way scenes of the manhunt for the fleeing trio; all horses and horse-drawn carriages, filmed on the fresh snow of Elura, Ontario, Canada, where a very old, closed, unused bridge was refurbished for the movie, and now serves as a pedestrian bridge. This powerful film also can take you to another place: you know you need to see it.",1367539200,3,5492,6.718926553672317
876810,5,6304414072,"The reason I purchased this movie is because I like historical stories especially if they are true.  A warning however, this film was deliberately shot darkly, trying to present the darker interiors of Victorian buildings of that period.  It is not the fault of the DVD manufacturer.  I had this movie in VHS years ago and it too was dark.  Some might think it is a ""chick flick"" because there is an element of romance between two of the main characters.  It may start out sort of dull, but picks up momentum with an exciting but bloody ending.  I'd say to anyone who likes prison stories, this is one with a twist and an early Mel Gibson work before he became a director/producer.",1365984000,,681,4.495934959349594

876813,4,6304414072,"Well acted, well filmed and based on a true story. The studio likes to promote this one by saying both Mel's character and Diane's are seeking and finding freedom. In reality and figuratively, though, throughout the film it show's Mel's character's struggle to escape prison, while Diane's--deceived into thinking she needs freedom--is spiritually deceived into finding a prison in her sins, as well as one to physically sit in.

Movie features some nice Biblical allegory and Scripture for discussion and a nice score by Mark Isham. For family friendliness there is a scene or two to fast-forward.",1327363200,,598,5.164948453608248

876815,5,6304414072,"Keaton and Gibson shine in bringing this true story to life.  The depressing issues of prison life and death row in the early 20th century are easy on the viewer because of the outstanding characterization, both as written and acted.",1325376000,,233,4.825

876863,5,6304414072,"Mrs. Soffel (Diane Keaton) is based on the true story of a emotionally starved Mother of three.  Her prison warden husband is not unsypathetic, but hasn't a clue as to what she's feeling.
Her daily routine of reading the Bible to the inmates can no
longer fulfill her emotional void...that is until the day she encounter's the new, guilt-in-question, death row inmates Jack Matthew Modine) and Ed (Mel Gibson) Biddle.
Rules of society were strict in 1901, but with death at stake, Ed Biddle begins a methodical plan to seduce the warden's wife to help them escape.
Black and White turn grey when it comes to just who is seducing who. Once the Biddle's escape the confines of their cells, it is Ed(Gibson)who doesn't want to leave ""Kate"" behind.
After the breakout is discovered the next morning, it seems only a Sheriff with a mind that can think the ""unthinkable"" suspects the warden's wife has escaped with the two deathrow inmates and not as their hostage...
On the run, Kate and Ed's passion grow until most certainly, one feels death is the only thing that can break them apart.

Gibson up to a pretty face with not much depth, BUT...",1034640000,10,1265,4.693693693693693
876864,4,6304414072,"An excellent movie. A little gloomy.  It seems to me that the major sufferers in this movie were Mrs Soffels children.  She left her 3 children, sacrificed is a better word, for the sexual pleasures of a murderer.  That aside, Diane Keaton was wonderful in the part of Mrs Soffel.  She was exquisit.  I doubt that the real Mrs. Soffel looked anything like Diane. The movie ended without telling us what happened to her or her lover and his brother.  I wish I knew.  I can only guess that the brothers were executed and Mrs. Soffel died in prison.  Why didn't the movie tell us?",1008979200,3,577,4.428571428571429
876865,5,6304414072,"Yet ANOTHER film to add to my favorite list of films! Could Diane Keaton be any more appealing and exquisite?!?!?! This beautiful movie deserves much MORE credit than it got! On a basic note, this movie is about a prison warden's wife, Kate Soffel, who meets and falls in love with a prisoner, Ed Biddle, on death row. Of course, that's very intriguing because how can two people on total opposite sides of life be together?  I cannot say how emotional I was at the ending. It's impossible to sum up this exceptional movie in a few words.  More or less, this story only applies to every person who have experienced true love, but also felt pain. Despite the conditions, the lovers manage to find a way to be together forever, and that's true love in its purest. The landscape, winter, contributes to the emptiness and instability of Kate and her husband's marriage, and the violet poem contributes to the youth and beauty of Kate and Ed's doomed, but beautiful relationship. It strikes your emotional chords at very opportune times, and it also gets you thinking about love back in the 1900's and the real Kate Soffel. Simply remarkable. I cannot put any of the words I'm thinking about the movie in clarification- I am telling this abstractly and undefined, because it's the way I felt. I felt the way I felt, and this is the best I can do.  I am still emotionally attached to this movie, and of course, no clear explanations come with emotions.  I have to admit, I found the ending S A D and unpredictable. It still brings tears to my eyes whenever I think of it. It's beautiful and painful. When Kate felt pain at the very ending, I also felt pain, too, for the doomed lovers. It's just so sad. I found the very last minutes striking. A voice sounding out lines from the violet poem while the camera looms down and swoops past prison cells... ""A little violet from across the way came to cheer a lonely prisoner in his cell one day...."" and from there, unfolds the heartbreaking story of Kate Soffel and Ed Biddle. DO  N O T  MISS IT.

876866,5,6304414072,"This movie is one of the best dark romantic movies that I have ever seen.  A woman (Diane Keaton)who is not happily married finds renewal in life and for the first time in life falls in love with a prison inmate (Mel Gibson).  She realizes how much she loves him and he realizes how much he loves her and their only wish in life is for God to allow them to be together.  I don't want to ruin the movie by telling too much but, if you get this your getting a great movie full of love, lust, action, religion and a journey over feelings and how you must follow them to be happy.  This movie reminds me of the dark romantic tale Romeo and Juliet.

876868,3,6304414072,"Mrs. Soffel is a dark, compelling movie set in a  Pittsburg prison in 1901.  Diane Keaton plays a warden's wife, desperate for hope and pleasure within the prison walls.  Mel Gibson and Matthew Modine play the Biddle  brothers - two young men who are sentenced to death for a crime they did  not commit.  The gloomy landscape is also a major character in this movie -  accentuating the hopelessness of the characters that inhabit this film.  I  was affected by the bond that grew between Keaton and Gibson as Mrs. Soffel  (played by Keaton) entreats Ed Biddle (played by Gibson) on the need for  prayer and preparation for death.  As they spend more time with each other,  they spend less time talking about death and more about love and hope.  She  assists in his escaping, and the movie takes off from there.  Diane Keaton  is my absolutely favorite actress; honesty pervades every move in all her  roles.  Mel Gibson is an actor I largely ignored; however, after seeing  this film I recommend he play more seriously romantic roles.  The sexual  and emotional attachment between these two characters was intense.  I wish  I could have changed the ending in this love story.  After seeing Mrs.  Soffel, I am interested in learning more about the actual woman who boldly  escaped from her own repressive environment to follow her heart.",954547200,10,1336,4.770925110132159
