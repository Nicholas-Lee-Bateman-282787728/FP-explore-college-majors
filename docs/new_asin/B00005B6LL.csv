Liked Christy Yeung also, and the movie was able to be followed relatively easily, not always the case when I'm dealing with subtitles. Last watched it long time ago,am clearing my review requests,so won't bother to elaborate about plot.",1386374400,,331,4.627118644067797
7936802,4,B00005B6LL,"You should watch this movie if you are a Shu Qi fan. If you are an Ekin Cheng fan, you should not watch this movie. The storyline is interesting, the execution is horrible (they tried to make it funny but it is way too corny). The only good thing is that Shu Qi played 3 roles and in my opinion she acted out well on all 3 roles. Ekin constantly wore an annoying white open jacket (Groovy!).",1133222400,5,391,4.090909090909091
7936803,2,B00005B6LL,"Director Raymond Wai Man Yip is given almost everything that he might require for preparation of a satisfactory film, a daunting exception being coherence within the script, since writer/producer Manfred Wong has not focussed upon any particular genre,  romance, humour, mystery, drama, martial arts, science fiction, and CGI fantasy all being included in random and unblended fashion, an inevitable result being this largely uninvolving mishmash.  The Bad Boy Squad, a variety of private detective agency, is composed of King (Ekin Cheng Yi-kin), Queen (Kristy Yeung), and Jack (Louis Koo Tin-lok), whose primary source of business is the reuniting of clientele with their first flames, and when the trio of young operatives returns to Hong Kong from an assignment in Thailand and the Squad's next three customers supply photographs of lost loves, the women in the pictures appear to be the same individual.  A more than adequate budget provides for above-standard production values for the work that took four months to complete, with location shooting in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, and Macau, while the actors do their best with a surfeit of silly scenes, Shu Qui being the most impressive with her task of playing multiple characters including an androidal clone with a mentality of a ten year old, and a middle-aged paraplegic.  The DVD version includes a lightweight ""making of.."" segment, and the subtitles, including those in English, are quite accurate; original dialogue is in Cantonese, with frequent usage of Mandarin and U.S. English.",1119225600,5,1549,5.336065573770492
7936804,2,B00005B6LL,"And that is to gaze upon the loveliness of Shu Qi.  This movie features some of the most inept film-making I've seen in a HK movie.  And that is really saying something.  The opening scenes in particularly are garishly lit, ugly, and amateurish.  Much of the movie seems barely scripted.  A waste of some good young talent.",1117238400,3,323,4.5964912280701755
7936805,1,B00005B6LL,"seriously, what were they thinkin??
King(Ekin) Queen(Kristy), and their friend Jack(Louis)own a firm that is specialized in finding lost loves. Which is kinda weird because King is a player with no conception of love. And Jack has a gf( Kelly Lin), whom, later on, dumps Jack, and Queen is in love with Jack.
All goes to hell, when King meets Eleven(Hsu Chi) at a club, it turns out that there are 3 grlz that looks like Hsu Chi in this movie( she played 3 characters) And they are all related in someway because the Japanese government is trying to make clones.
hows that for a good script??
i admit Ekin gives a fun not too annoying performance, and Hsu chi wasn't too bad either. Louis( whom i think is the future 'Chow Yun Fat' or "" Tony Leung') and Kristy both had their moments. But overall, this movie had no script, direction, and mostly importantly point. Toward the end, there's a part where Louis shoots Ekin by accident, but nothing happens to Ekin, i mean i know HK cinema is known for its creativity and wackiness but come on....
so please....dont watch this movie....you will not regret it...rather spend the money on something else...try dare i say ' return to a better tomorrow?""",1031184000,2,1196,4.619718309859155
7936806,2,B00005B6LL,"The plot is weak, the script is horrible and bad directing. A big disappointment for a HK film and the film has no originality especially when they incorporated the dodging bullet scenes from the Matrix which spoils the homage of Hong Kong Cinema. Apart from that, they even incorporated a scene from Spider-Man O_o. It happens when E-kin fell off the trailer and he then shoots some kind of string from his wrist to keep him from falling. I can't really explain it though, so sorry.
Don't waste money on this DVD, rent it if you like....I seriously recommend Jet Li's Kiss of the Dragon. It really kicks ... and Jet Li really make bad guys cry....hehehehehe! Or catch Spider-Man : the movie when it is release on DVD......the movie is a big success and they did a very good job! Can't wait for the sequel!",1028764800,,806,4.527397260273973
7936807,5,B00005B6LL,"I am a big fan of HoNg Kong movie, and i also a big fan of Kristy yang. The movie didn't talk much about her though, but it was a happy ending for her. I know you might want to know an overview here it is:
King ( ekin cheng) is sorta a playah, he has many girlfriends, but after meeting Eleven ( shu sQi) he realy inlove with her. Jack ( Louis koo tin lok) always expect a 100% girlF. So his girlfriend got tired of him, so she dumped him. Queen (kristie yang) has been loving jack along time, and she finaly expresed it out after he broke up with his girlf. fist he didn't except her, but after all he realize dat he likeher. so it is sorta happy ending. Wellz King didn't have quite a happy ending but he still happy. Want to know more?
WAtch it!!!!!
it is an excellent movie, i saw it more than 5 times alredy. have fun!",1018828800,,823,3.963855421686747
7936808,4,B00005B6LL,"This was ok, maybe it dragged a little and the story was normal but intreasting. Ekin (king) was very different from his usual caracter. And Louis (jack) seemed his old self. Kristy (queen)was ok, but her voice is so wierd, it's so high and pitch. It kindda annoyed me during the movie. Shu Qi (shadow, eleven & sum athletic) played 3 different charcters here. The cloned character, eleven really annoyed me, she acted like a dummy (well she did have a micro chip brain) but she has way too much lipstick which made her look ugly. But when she played the long lost girlfriend shadow she looked way better. Over all, it was pretty good, sum funny scenes and jokes, but there was too many kissing scenes with Ekin and all these girls. And i like the idea of King, Queen and Jack. You should watch this movie if your a fan of Louis or Ekin (Yes, i'm a huge fan) and if you want to pass time.",1010188800,,888,4.291666666666667
7936809,5,B00005B6LL,"This movie sort of contain the funny side of Ekin Cheng.  Ekin character (King) is a big flirt.  Louis  (Jack) character is a person who is looking for one perfect girl (If there really is such a girl).  Kristy play (Queen) as Ekin's younger sister.  This is wierd because most of the movie I watch, they have always been a couple.  Kristy have a huge crush on Louis, but Louis already have a girlfriend, which eventually they will broke up.  What's so wierd about this movie?  I think that the girl (Eleven) who play with Ekin is really ugly.  I don't know how he fall for her in the first place.  Eventually Louis fall in love with Kristy.  I like the ending, sort of.",1003104000,,670,4.32258064516129
7936810,3,B00005B6LL,"I thought that the first twenty minutes of this movie were pretty weak, even amateurish in some points. To tell the truth, I thought it was badly directed during those few minutes. But it gets much better when the story really begins.
The movie centers on a private eye agency formed by two guys and the sister of one of them. They take a case in which they have to find their client's missing girlfriend (played by Shu Qi from Gorgeous). When they find her, they realize that's something is wrong since she doesn't know who is their client and she's always pursued by a strange and evil organization.
Expect funny moments, romance and action sequences (with one sequence being a parody of The Matrix). Ekin Cheng, the womanizer of the trio, plays a cheerful character who is far from his roles in A Man Called Hero and Hot War.
Not the movie of the year, but very refreshing.",986947200,,876,4.515723270440252
