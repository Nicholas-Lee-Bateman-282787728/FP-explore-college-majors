8193604,3,B000PWQP8E,"I was looking for something different to watch and saw a couple of actors I liked in this movie but almost everybody gets killed in it. Probably the truth only the Kremlin would know so well. It reminded me of Mission Impossible and I liked the music during the credits. No it isn't the best movie ever made but its a good one for somethimg different. I got on the Internet trying to find that song played during the credits and this outfit is pretty big world wide. I connected with the Russians in this movie. They did not downplay the US's power. That airplane was coming out of the sky either by them or by the US, but I won't spoil the ending for you. Watch it with a good attitude and it might grow on you too!",1314576000,,716,4.158273381294964
8193605,4,B000PWQP8E,"This is a good action film, it shows a plot about global terrorism, espionage, counter-intelligence and all these stuff. It's really interesting for the lovers of aircrafts that they used real Sukhoi fighters for this movie. European productions never use this kind of elements and they don't often invest in high budget action movies. The weak point was the acting, they did it good considering they were most beginners, but not a big deal. I highly recommend this movie for action/airplanes lovers.",1243209600,3,500,5.109756097560975
8193606,3,B000PWQP8E,"This is a movie you will either enjoy once or complain about.  There is a plot line (not the best but it is there) sub plots and some decent action.  If you can watch Fire Birds, use the same IQ setting and you might find some the action fun to watch.  I love the look of the Sukhoi so I tend to tolerate the mediocrity of the film.  I've seen worse films on DVD and in theaters.  At the price of a used copy, it is worth having in a collection of aviation films just for a non USA point of view.",1231459200,,496,3.823529411764706
8193607,3,B000PWQP8E,"I have to say that this movie is not a brilliant piece of work. For somebody who knows and wants better, this movie will probably not satisfy that person. But I think if you watch that movie without any assumptions and expectations you might like some of the important scenes in the movie. For me it's like the slim, russian version of ""Fighter Pilot:Operation Red Flag"". The plot and acting aren't really the best but the few aircraft scenes are sweet for thous people who like the Sukhoi planes. For the record, I think this DVD isn't for everybody but for some it could become a nice, foreign extra piece in their otherwise western orientate collection about flying. But everybody has to decide for themself.",1211932800,,711,4.696
8193608,5,B000PWQP8E,"It looks like to me a refreshing movie; as always the European movies giving a point of view different from the North American. For someone who is tired of a Pro-North American argument, this is a good option.

Friends of Amazon, I invite to you to have more titles from European movies.",1205798400,,287,4.519230769230769
8193609,1,B000PWQP8E,"Well, by the looks of the cover, it's kinda cool.  Saw it at Blockbuster and there was nothing else, so I tried it.  I figured it had to be somewhat cool since it was about fighter jets.  Also, Armand Assante is a pretty good ""B"" lister, and so is Rutger, albeit past their primes.  But, I couldn't make it through the whole thing.  The plot is hard to follow like the other reviewer says, and the voice dubbing is absolutely the WORST quality ever!  The voice track was enough to make me want to shut it off. The actors voices sound a little behind the mouth movements and the voices sound like they are being recorded in a studio, yet the people are out in the forest and on MOVING airplanes at times.  There's a hotshot young pilot who engages in a cheesy love affair with some greenpeace lady.  The two seemingly fall completely in love in a matter of minutes; in fact the girl takes a bullet for the guy. There are two bonehead, clunky, bumbling, ""elmer fudd type"" spies on the hotshot's tail following him through the movie.  I couldn't understand why they were trying to follow him but it was so unprofessional. Also, assante is investigating the russians and that's about all I got out of it.  If this is the best russia can do with an action movie, they should not be in American stores.",1186444800,2,1296,4.384937238493724
8193610,1,B000PWQP8E,"If there was ever an instance where Amazon needed to seriously consider allowing a product to be given a negative rating, this is it.

This abomination of a movie was produced, written, and directed by a Russian crew, but watching it, it felt more like it was created by a truckload of lobotomized monkeys.  Russia - the culture that gave us Dostoevsky, Peter the Great, and Nabokov.  It boggles the mind that something like Mirror Wars could originate in the same gene pool.  But... coming from a country that's given the world both Mark Twain and Jerry Springer, I guess I don't have room to talk.

At any rate, this was an atrocious movie.  Absolutely horrible.  The plot, as far as I could tell, revolved around a terrorist (played by Malcolm McDowell, in what is surely some sort of career death-wish) who decides to steal a new Russian stealth jet-fighter prototype so he can use it to assassinate the US President.  What this guy's motivation was, I really couldn't tell you.  Perhaps it was lost somewhere in the really bad over-dubbing.

Also mixed into the plot is the naive young pilot of the stealth jet, who falls madly in love with an American ecologist in Russia to save the Siberian tiger population.  (Huh?)

Throw in a little Armand Assante as some sort of CIA operative who may or may not have been involved in trying to prevent the terrorist plot (again, the story line was a bit... shall we say... vague), and a mystifying 40-second cameo by Rutger Hauer, and you have pure movie magic.

Unless you're some sort of sick celluloid masochist, avoid this at all costs.",1184112000,9,1586,4.661870503597123
