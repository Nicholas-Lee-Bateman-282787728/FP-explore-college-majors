8155552,4,B000KC8KR8,"The other reviewer who complains that he didn't see the author in the interview with Tom Wolfe has something.  But Charlie Rose doesn't do lifetime achievement awards.  The interview is about what was going on with Wolfe lately (this was 1998), which was open heart surgery and the publication of A Man in Full.  I found Wolfe's discussion of depression interesting.

(I didn't make it through the Kenneth Branagh interview.  He should have stuck with the English stage actor schtick like Patrick Stewart rather than going Hollywood.)",1263081600,,534,5.091954022988506
8155553,3,B000KC8KR8,"I expected something completely different from what was given here. I had many years before read Wolfe's first essays. They were to say the least flammboyantly original wild wild wild. They had brilliance and originality in them even though there was a bit of mean- spiritedness there. The power of mocking satire can be funny but it also can be extremely cruel.
This interview presented a much tamer creature. Wolfe had a softness about him I did not expect. And above all the conversation is not scintillating. He may well be one of those people who can only really let go properly when he writes.
In any case if I had skipped this I don't feel I would have missed much of anything.",1194393600,,684,4.569105691056911
