4162407,3,B003ODIUZC,"Other reviewers stated that this was a mediocre Flynn film, but I'm such a fan, that I ignored those reviews.  Unfortunately they were right!  This is a very mediocre film from both the acting and script angles.  I would recommend to rent this, but not buy it.  It is not something most people will want to see a second time.  It's also in black and white.",1374192000,,356,4.333333333333333
4162408,3,B003ODIUZC,"Routine adventure flick finds an aging, rather tired looking Errol Flynn as the captain of a salvage boat involved in murder and sunken treasure. It's passable entertainment until the last 15 minutes when it goes all sanctimonious on us. Raymond Burr is the villain and Ruth Roman is the dish desired by both Flynn and Burr. The most interesting character is the detective for hire who plays both sides against the middle played by Paul Picerni. The B&W cinematography by Robert Burks (an Oscar winner for TO CATCH A THIEF) is decent enough but the film could have benefited from Technicolor. Max Steiner's score helps out too.

The Warners Archive MOD DVD is a nice transfer.",1318291200,10,676,4.827586206896552
4162409,3,B003ODIUZC,"This is a great old movie, after all it is Flynn. Too bad WB did the dvd. I noticed that, AGAIN,like their other archive films, the dvd is not CAPTIONED. Another cheap product by WD. If the dvd is like the other WD flops, there is no extras involved, either. I will have to wait until someone at WD is willing to spend an extra buck to caption the film. SOme of the WD transfer are from VHS that was captioned, Why did they leasve this feature off their product? Cheap!!!!",1289433600,6,472,4.197802197802198

8401590,5,B003ODIUZC,"Mara Maru was released in 1952. It starred Ruth Roman,with good support from Raymond Burr. A search for treasure goes bad when the partners try to kill each other. More romance than usual in an adventure film. Fans of Ruth Roman will like this the most.",1482796800,,253,4.521739130434782

8401594,3,B003ODIUZC,"There was a feel to this movie that seemed like it changed plot line mid stream.  Errol Flynn walks through this standard plot line as a deep sea diver out to make his fortune and only caring about that big score.  His drunken partner who had won the girl (Ruth Roman) from him and is now rambling on about finding a treasure worth a million dollars is killed.  He looks like the murder is going to be pinned on him, but a witness steps forward to save him.  There seems to be something between the villain Raymond Burr and Ruth Roman which is never revealed.  The first part of the film the treasure is diamonds, but when it is rescued it is a religious cross and a question of whether it should be kept or given back to the church comes up.  The uneven feel of the film and flat acting keeps the film from getting good.  Although Burr does do a good job as the villain.
Not a bad movie, just not a real good one.  Just a decent older film to pass the time with.",1426118400,2,963,4.112299465240642

8401596,5,B003ODIUZC,"I am getting tired of people reviewing movies based on the DVD quality. Can people just get it through their heads that they need to step back and think about the fact that back in the time these movies were made, they did not have all the features we have taken for granted today. With that said, I am going to base my review on the movie and not of the DVD features or lack there of. Errol Flynn plays a salvage diver names Mason. He and his partner do not see eye to eye and soon his partner is murdered and Mason is framed. He is later released as someone comes forward to claim they saw the murder and that Mason was not the guilty party. When he thinks he is free, he comes to realize there is a cost for that alibi. The man soon forces Erool Flynn(Mason) to go on a dive to locate a very precious item and soon the cat and mouse chase begins. I found this movie to be entertaining and fun. If you are a fan of old movies, there is nothing wrong with this one regardless of others opinions.",1395360000,11,996,4.060913705583756
