8013118,5,616181160X,"A surprisingly faithful adaptation of the first season of the Assassination Classroom anime.  Better effects, voices, and subtitling than expected, particularly for a live-action movie version rushed so quickly after this series exploded into popularity.  The biggest downside is that this is TOO faithful -- it attempts to pack in all the events of the episodes, which doesn't allow these story arcs to get enough time and depth to show the care korosensei has for his students -- thus the movie is a great fan-pleaser for those who have seen the anime, but feels rushed and emotionally shallow to people new to the story.",1466812800,,623,4.980769230769231
8013119,5,616181160X,"This was a fun movie - someone was certainly enthusiastic about the production and it definitely shows. The movie is, in many ways, true to the material on which it's based.  The CG for Koro-sensei was a little distracting on occasion (and certainly the movie might be a little longer than I expected initially) but it was certainly a pretty fun watch.  The subtitles are reasonable and so is the image quality - definitely planning to watch it again. They packed a whole lot of storyline in and there were a couple of slow points, but all in all, it was enjoyable.",1466467200,,565,4.529411764705882
