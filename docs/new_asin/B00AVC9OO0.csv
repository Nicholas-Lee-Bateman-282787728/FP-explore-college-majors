 Joel is right on with his questions, they illuminate the differences between old school enlightenment where emotions are viewed as energies or mysterious phenomena, and the new school enlightenment where emotions are viewed as the root of our being and don't have to be transcended in order to live an enlightened life, as offered by Daniel Barron.
Joel doesn't take any positions, he gives space to the viewers to feel what is true for them. All in all a remarkable movie that I highly recommend for anyone who wants to get a taste of how spirituality and emotions are dancing to the same music, the melody of the soul.",1360195200,10,882,4.617834394904459

Also the music is beautiful, it holds meaning and helps support the words and gives us  deeper meaning, bringing us to a  higher place of understanding.
Great job David, I feel your truth coming from your music!",1358899200,3,275,4.956521739130435
8558054,5,B00AVC9OO0,"This film breaks new spiritual ground by accessibly approaching spirituality from a meta-to-spirituality place. In other words, most treatments of any subject come from too much within a paradigm, and not asking the hard questions that might threaten a model's assumptions or explanations for phenomena.

In other words, rarely do you see a treatment of spirituality that actually sees models for what they are: models. Listen carefully to what is said here and you will see the limits of the models many of these teachers do not see, because they are unwilling to look at their own systems as possibly incomplete. The director has done a wonderful job asking the hard questions in a respectful, earnest and passionate way and the result is a body of work that ought to be appreciated by many seekers who maybe don't know the questions to ask yet.

This film one day will be part of any metaphysical, philosophical, or spiritual higher education program.",1357948800,4,954,4.95625
8558055,5,B00AVC9OO0,"'Tears of the Buddha' is a highly important movie, because it deals with an issue of life - our feelings and emotions - where are so many questions and where I never got a sufficient answer from my Advaita and Buddhist teachers.

Of course Joel Lesko, director of the movie, does not give the 'right' answer.

But Joel chose a unique setting to illuminate this area of the human heart in a new and productive way. First he identified ten essential questions about emotions, e.g. what are emotions, who am I? Then he asked those questions twelve spiritual teachers and presented their answers side by side. The answers are striking and specific to each teacher, so that the observer can distinguish the different positions and make up his/her own mind. This is a beautiful possibility that has not been existed before.

Because 'Tears of the Buddha' is so comprehensive it is sometimes difficult to 'understand'. I had to watch and feel it in steps. In either case I recommend discussing it with friends.

It was a surprise to me that each teacher had his/her personal opinion and that there was such a wide range. On the one side some teachers regarded emotions as neutral energies belonging to nobody, on the other side Daniel Barron suggested that emotions are essential to our self. This position that emotions and self are compatible with nondual enlightenment is very important for me, and I believe that a real discussion about this issue is overdue.

Finally to say that 'Tears' answered many of my old questions. That's great!",1357171200,4,1534,4.817490494296578
