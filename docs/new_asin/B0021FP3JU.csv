3831857,4,B0021FP3JU,"Mary Elisabeth (Allison Brie) is having a very bad day.  It starts off with her mother's graveside funeral service followed by a freaky hallucination and ends with her being pregnant the next morning.  The weird thing is that she's already has a prominent baby bump and is having the worst morning sickness ever.  Oh, and did I mention that she's a virgin?  And the proud papa happens to be the Demon Asmodeus (Kane Hodder), who, when he was human, happened to be her brother. (Eww!) It seems that Asmodeus has brokered a deal with Ol' Scratch.  This incestuous encounter is supposed to make him human again while his chip off the old block wrecks havoc on Earth and then take his place in hell.  And you think your family has problems!

  I have heard that this movie stinks, but I have to be honest, I enjoyed it.  First of all, it's Kane Hodder!  Without the makeup!  And with decent lines!  And way more than just a few scenes!  If any of you have doubts that he can act, throw them away.  I knew he had it in him, but the few times I had seen him not as Jason Vorhees from the last four Friday The 13th movies, he's been underused.  Which is probably for the best, 'cause the movies (Dead Noon, Dark Wolf) were awful.  But not only did he do well, so did the rest of cast.  The gore effects are well done and the cgi demon baby is cheese-tastic!  Not only that, but when Miss Brie character is possessed by her fetus, she is over the top hilarious. (""Baby be born!  Baby be born!""  ranks up there with ""Jumby wants to be born.""( ""Unborn"") ).",1338076800,,1546,4.298611111111111

3831859,2,B0021FP3JU,"Born (Richard Friedman, 2007)

This is a movie that wanted to be big. Really, really big. And somehow, Richard Friedman (Doom Asylum) managed to blow it in every possible way-- the script, the casting, the direction, everything. This is a movie that should have stayed in the womb. Better yet, it should have never been conceived.

Mary Elizabeth (Mad Men's Alison Brie, the film's only bright spot) gets herself in the family way, despite being a virgin. Her fundamentalist sister Catherine (Star Trek: The Next Generation's Denise Crosby) is really unhappy with this development, though their father doesn't seem all that concerned. Now, I should mention that this story is being told in flashback by a guy (Friday the 13th's Kane Hodder) who claims to be the devil. He's talking to a psychiatrist, Dr. Sammael (Joan Severance). Are you starting to see how this thing was just derailed from frame one? In any case, it seems Mary Elizabeth is either pregnant with the second coming or the Antichrist, and she has to figure out which one, who's working for which side, and whom she can trust. I could have told her one thing-- she can't trust either Richard Friedman or screenwriter Alex D'Lerma (who also has a small role in the film as a priest). Friedman, at least, shows us her best side now and again. She's a pretty good actress, when she's not being coached to go way over the top, and she's certainly easy enough on the eyes (that's one good thing about this movie-- there are quite a few very attractive actresses in it). Unfortunately, unless that alone is reason enough for you to take in a film, this won't do it for you. The plot is there, but it's razor-thin and tends to fade into the background. The actors are, in the main, not awful, but they're not given a great deal to work with. And the special effects are just plain laughable.

It could be argued that this is a movie that gets so terribly off base in so many ways that it achieves a kind of greatness, in the same way Night of the Lepus or Beware! The Blob does, but that's a matter of personal preference. I wasn't quite impressed enough by its badness to elevate it to such a status; you may be. * ",1277337600,5,2175,4.540816326530612
3831860,2,B0021FP3JU,"Satan gets busy again and impregnates a young virgin.  This time he uses a surrogate and the impregnator is a demon torturer from the 13th level of hell and the preg-nee is his human virgin sister Mary. Incest.  Good, wholesome family fun. And the mother-to-be is named Mary.  Hmmmmm.....coincidence?

What does the movie have?

Kane Hodder without his Jason hockey mask as the demon.
Severed heads.
Human hearts eaten demurely off a china plate.
Denise Crosby playing her specialty, a hysterical, demented broad.
A pasty-faced rubbery red-lipped albino named Ivan.
Twin chicks who appear dressed in slinky gowns the first half of the movie.
The same chicks naked the second half of the movie.
A assassin priest who walks around with a semi-automatic and silencer in his hollowed-out bible.
A pregnant belly trap-door to visit a hand-puppet demon child.
Actors sticking their heads through floor-boards to pretend their heads are severed.
Satan in high heels.

What does the movie lack?

A story that makes sense.
Good actors.

To sum it up-the movie is not even worthy of a night of MST3K, but I'm glad I watched it. Sometimes watching a stupid movie may even save your soul.....NOT.",1275091200,4,1184,4.974619289340102
3831861,1,B0021FP3JU,"As with most of today's movies in the horror genre, this one has plenty of gore for fans. The storyline was not as predictable as I thought, but the acting destroyed the movie for me; along with the cheesy special effects. Kane Hodder today's superstar boogeyman, was at least interesting to watch without a hockey mask or distorted makeup. The lead, Alison Brie, just isn't strong enough to carry the movie, particularly a bad one. Veteran Denise Crosby has done better work. Actually, she is the only good performance in the movie next to Hodder.

I don't recommend this film. The explicit use of gore is used as a substitute for tension and interest from a shoddy script. The scenes with the heroine talking for the demonic baby are unintentionally campy and hilarious.

I'm glad I rented it for only a buck. Otherwise, I would have felt really cheated.

I gave it one star because Amazon has nothing lower. A total zero.",1254268800,,924,4.691358024691358

3831863,3,B0021FP3JU,"Having a baby is no easy task.  If your baby happens to be a demon child, you can't even imagine what you're in for.  ""Born"" is a D-level horror film that attempts to capture that experience.

A young virgin awakes one morning and is miraculously pregnant with a demon child.  The father of said devil baby is one of hell's demons, who needs the child to be born so he can regain his soul.  What unfolds during the hour and forty minutes of labor (pun intended) is never truly explained.

""Born"" is a mediocre horror film at best.  The potential was there for this film to be much better than average.  But, the poorly written dialogue, sub par acting and numerous plot holes were to overwhelming to go unnoticed.",1250899200,5,713,4.4728682170542635

Essentially, if he can get his sister pregnant with a demon child, have her kill six people, and then present the child to Satan, he believes he will be freed from the thirteenth level of hell, where he enjoys employment as a torturer.

The first part of his deal works, and soon Mary Elizabeth (Brie) is pregnant, having gained 15 pounds during the first night. She is, it is verified, a virgin, and so the church sends a priest to spy on her. Gradually, her fetus grows (as we see repeatedly on ultrasound), and Mary Elizabeth begins to claim the victims her fetus requires. Meanwhile, two blond twins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Julie-Costello/dp/B001J4AV7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Julie Costello</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shawnie-Costello/dp/B0000CDRVX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shawnie Costello</a>&nbsp;wander about silently, wearing silver gowns in the first half of the movie and nothing in the second half.
