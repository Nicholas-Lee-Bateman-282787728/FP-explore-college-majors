8458140,2,B0055E7KUO,"This is actually mostly a grip-n-grin production with some decent moments of fish porn. However, is it worth the scratch? Nah. There is no story, no real tension, just a series of disconnected episodes fishing for and catching permit on the fly. The thing is, fly-caught permit are bloody hard. There must have been all kinds of opportunity here to tell a great story (or stories) of the pursuit of the flats' most frustrating gamefish. But, nope. None of that. Just randomness and more hookups than you'd expect with these fish. They make it look too easy by editing out most of the failure (of which I'm sure there was a lot). Constant hookups is not what permit fishing is about.

On the plus side, the filming is decent and there are some great shots of permit following and taking a fly. There is also the obligatory conservation message at the end, pointing out that these amazing fish have no gamefish status in the Florida Keys. Great message, but I didn't need to pay to learn that.",1351296000,3,991,4.598870056497175
8458141,4,B0055E7KUO,"Entertaining video of the ""gold standard"" flats fish. A brief overview of tackle and presentation technique would have been appropriate, but, this is more of a ""grip and grin"" film as opposed to a ""how to"" presentation; overall, worth the purchase.",1335916800,,248,5.073170731707317
