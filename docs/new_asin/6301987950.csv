7819507,2,6301987950,"Sorry to disagree with the other reviews, but I think Seinfeld got much better later, as a stand-up
comedian, especially if you compare this 1987 video with his later ""I'm Telling You This for the Last Time.""
The material on this older stand-up routine was pretty thin, and the parts in between the stand-up are very unfunny, I think. Surprisingly weak humor. It's interesting to see how he was as a stand-up comedian back in the 1980s, though. He became much better later when he slowed down his delivery, and polished his stand-up humor.
I'm still a big fan.",1276905600,2,560,4.666666666666667
