8702994,1,B00TS7U4R0,"At approximately the 27:40 point on the first DVD, we're shown a publicity photo from the movie ""La Bamba"" featuring Marshal Crenshaw, and then incredibly, led to believe that it's a photo of rock legend Buddy Holly.

This is a colossal, bumbling amateur mistake.  Shame on the producers for using the photo of a guy who once played Buddy Holly in a movie, when there are dozens of great photos available of the real Buddy Holly.",1532131200,,429,4.631578947368421
8702995,5,B00TS7U4R0,Happy with sale.,1481414400,,16,4.666666666666667
8702996,5,B00TS7U4R0,A decent double DVD set that contains a lot of very good interviews with Neil himself - God knows where these came from as Ive never seen them before and they aren't on You Tube or any other similar paltform as far as I'm aware. Looks also at the artists that inflenced  Neil most across the years. A worthwhile set in very nice fold-out style packaging.,1459036800,2,354,4.363636363636363
8702997,5,B00TS7U4R0,A very good 2 x DVD Documentary set about different aspects of Neil Young's music and career. Well worth picking up.as it has  lots of very good footage included and lots of NY interviews.,1454112000,2,188,4.529411764705882
8702998,1,B00TS7U4R0,"Did not give me or anyone else an open valid evaluation about Neil and his work. Very disappointing, he certainly is honest with us and very thoughtful.",1439856000,3,152,4.666666666666667
8702999,3,B00TS7U4R0,"I enjoyed this film, although I was disappointed at the lack of interviews with Young himself. I got the distinct impression that this feature wasn't officially sanctioned by the man or his people, as it contains mostly footage of other influential artists and interviews with journalists.",1433548800,8,289,5.304347826086956
