500344,3,6302696941,"Have been waiting for this DVD, for this lady has shared my interest for many years now + recorded at Carnegie Hall What more could one want????
Great concert but poor audio, hallow and very little life from what must have been a great band. Vidio so, so. As reference good, but why not spend some time editing the tapes so we can get the best from a concert like this?SHAME",1193097600,,374,4.28169014084507
500345,5,6302696941,"This is a video with a young Bill Walton, Greg Lee and Walt Hazzard, who played for John Wooden at UCLA. The video has some footage from old UCLA basketball games.  The advise is as good then as it is now. Walt Hazzard coaches some kids on the fundamentals and a coach can watch his teaching techniques.  I'm wondering if Walt Hazzard's coaching style is based on John Wooden. Bill Walton is an excellent coach, I can tell that he is coaching from a players point of view.  This is one of the best teaching videos I brought to date. It has so many coaches and player tips that I'm afraid I'm going to wear my video out by watching it. This is a long well done video.",1121040000,,666,4.1875
500346,5,6302696941,I enjoy watching this show over and over again. Ms. Nancy Wilson will always be in a class alone. The duet with Carl Anderson add addtional glamour to this awesome show.  I hope this will soon be release on DVD for all of Nancy Wilson supporters.,990748800,,246,4.3478260869565215

7830034,5,6302696941,"Wilson was at the top of her game for this memorable concert, held during the 1987 JVC Jazz Festival in New York City.  She's most ably supported by a piano trio, a string orchestra, and a series of outstanding arrangements.  The program is nicely balanced between standards and more contemporary tunes, with the high points probably being Wilson's moving rendition of one of her staples, ""Guess Who I Saw Today,"" as well as her two rapturous duets with Carl Anderson, a fine singer who never really made it big and was perhaps best known for his backup vocals with Weather Report, a starring role in Jesus Christ Superstar, and several TV appearances as an actor.  At 52 minutes in length, this DVD may or may not contain all of this Wilson concert, but since it appears that none of the music was ever released in CD format, this DVD is the only way to go for her fans and / or lovers of high quality vocalizing in general.",1503964800,,925,4.494047619047619

7830041,5,6302696941,"Miss Nancy Wilson at her best. After a resurgence of her career and some admirable music made in the early eighties this concert, part of a series that year (1987) Miss Wilson's portion of this series was a major highlight and more than adequately showed why she has always been named in categories such as class, sophistication, top drawer song stylist. Hints of Ella, Sarah, and Dinah all show themselves in every song she sings. From standards to her duets with Carl Anderson she shines brightly. This is a concert worth watching.",1260489600,,533,4.804347826086956
7830042,5,6302696941,I bought this to show at a Movie Marathon of Divas of Jazz at the HUD sbusidized building that I work at and live in.  Nancy Wilson brought the house down.  She was beautiful and gave an incredible performance.,1235260800,,210,4.358974358974359
