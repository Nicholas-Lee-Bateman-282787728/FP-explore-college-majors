4049325,5,B0031O8S2E,"THE CRIMSON GHOST, is a bit of a classic with Cliffhanger Serial Lovers, starring Clayton Moore and the lovely Linda Stirling. Made in 1946 in 12 chapters ( 2hrs 50 mins ) this dvd i have is b/w but i believe some versions are in colour, lots of car chases / fist fights / fires / explosions / smoke bombs / missiles being thrown and of course THE CRIMSON GHOST. Obviously it's a bit of a gimmick having a skeleton running up and down ( he wears a gown just his face and hands are visible ) this is a super serial i enjoyed a lot. This dvd available from AMAZON has stunning art-work on the front cover- the reverse is not bad either, nice picture & sound, interactive menus, plus an extra bonus chapter 3 of the cliffhanger serial Black Hawk. This release is highly recommended, i started collecting American Cliffhanger Serials 2 years ago so far i've got 120- must have collected most of the best ones available - American cliffhanger serials are pure entertainment - enjoy.",1399593600,4,977,4.4636871508379885
4049326,5,B0031O8S2E,"I have always loved this ""cliff hanger"" serial from the first moment I saw it on TV.  It's very well paced and holds your attention.  No dull moments. The stunt men certainly get a workout in every episode.  Clayton Moore plays the chief henchman to the Crimson Ghost with great energy.  Nice to have seen the future Lone Ranger without his mask!  The chemistry between the hero and heroine, Charles Quigley and Linda Sterling, is believable.",1385683200,3,442,4.7631578947368425
4049327,1,B0031O8S2E,"ALL SERIAL FANS. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SERIALS,BUT YOU ARE ADVISED NOT TO TAKE THIS EDITION AS THE VIDEO AND AUDIO QUALITY ARE AWFUL.
YOU WILL BE SORRY. WAIT FOR THE OFFICIAL RELEASE FROM THE STUDIO (WHENEVER THAT MAY BE).",1349222400,11,227,4.428571428571429
4049328,3,B0031O8S2E,"One of the last truly memorable Republic serials, ""The Crimson Ghost"" (1946) features an iconic criminal mastermind and the usual robust stunt work. Charles Quigley makes a rather bland hero, but the villains are fun (including a pre-Lone Ranger Clayton Moore). The Lydecker Brothers maintain their high standards in the visual-effects department. Director William Witney ended his cliffhanging career on a vigorous note with this 12-chapter romp. Avoid the badly edited feature version titled ""Cyclotrode X.""",1284336000,9,509,5.7105263157894735

8387122,5,B0031O8S2E,"You just can't get any better than a Republic serial. All serials are great but Republic will always be king of the serials. This one was billed as a ""Super Serial"" and it certainly held up to that billing. There are more fights, car crashes and the best ever chapter cliffhangers. The added treat was the queen of serials, Linda Stirling and Clayton""The Lone Ranger"" Moore playing the head bad guy. All twelve chapters will keep you on the edge of your seat and as always, its in glorious black and white.",1436140800,2,506,4.510869565217392

8387125,2,B0031O8S2E,"The video quality is very mediocre.  I have a VHS set of the same series, and the video quality on that is quite good.  So, I assume that someone simply copied the series from the VHS source and wasn't concerned about the attendant loss in quality.  Wouldn't buy this set from ""Smarty Pants Productions"" again.",1411776000,2,310,4.6

8387127,5,B0031O8S2E,"Here we see Clayton Moore, TV's Lone Ranger. seduced
by the Dark Side. A merciless killer, he is shot dead in
one chapter, but pops up in the next to help that master
of evil The Crimson Ghost vent his fury on the world.
An unstoppable madman,  panic and terror in the streets --- what
more could you want in a cliffhanger?",1400803200,2,323,4.209677419354839
8387128,4,B0031O8S2E,"How could anything so amateurish, with such poor special effects (or lack thereof) cause an 8-year-old kid to get down under his seat in the movie theater? I don't know because I'm not an 8-year-old kid any more but I will tell you that to this day I look at cliffhangers as an art form that needs to be preserved, as do ALL old films.  We need to keep these for posterity and I did my part by making it part of my collection.",1400457600,4,426,4.071428571428571
