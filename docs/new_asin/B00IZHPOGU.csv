8646841,4,B00IZHPOGU,"Released in the summer of 1990, The Hemingway Papers is the second Lupin the 3rd made for TV movie. Lupin discovers that writer Ernest Hemingway wrote a final book (or I guess handful of pages) prior to his suicide describing the location of a fabulous treasure. The pages are located on the Mediterranean island of Colcaca in an impregnable box but as luck would have it two rival military factions have been at war for a decade trying to get the treasure for themselves. As if this were not enough of a mess the two factions have hired Jigen and Goemon as enforcers. Lupins staunch allies each have their own motivation for getting involved far beyond any monetary inducements.

Despite its age this is a pretty good Lupin movie. The animation is well done but where The Hemingway Papers shines is in the plot. One of the failings of a lot of the Lupin movies is unnecessarily complicated plots but The Hemingway Papers keeps things simple to its great benefit. The biggest moments of the film were the two face-offs between Goemon and Jigen. In the first battle the two did a rather unconvincing sumo style fight that left both seemingly unconscious. In the second fight their employers set up a situation where they are forced to fight to the death. Fans of Lupin the 3rd probably recognize that although Jigen is a fantastic gun fighter, Goemon is generally portrayed as practically invincible so it would seem like the fight would be completely one sided but the movie manages to make it exciting.

I would put The Hemingway Papers among the better Lupin movies. The Lupin films directed by Osamu Dezaki are generally some of the more fun and lighthearted films. As always we get plenty of screen time from Fujiko Mine and Inspector Zenigata and Lupin naturally has a love interest that we will never see again. An irony of the Lupin series is that the super thief, Lupin, can never actually get the fantastic fortune lest the dynamics of the series be completely thrown off. The Hemingway Papers has probably the most clever and appropriate means for Lupin to not get the treasure despite his unparalleled thieving skills.",1441670400,5,2129,4.751351351351351

8646847,5,B00IZHPOGU,"The Hemingway Papers, the second of the Lupin III television specials, continues in the proud tradition of Japan's favorite thief. Everything you love about the series is here in abundance. Over the top gadgets? Check. Gunfights and swordplay? Check. A mysterious treasure that everyone's fighting to uncover? Check. A nice mixture of humor, drama and action? Check. The Lupin formula is a simple one but over the past 40 years it's managed to endure, keeping things fresh without every straying too far from what made the character popular in the first place. There's a reason why some refer to him to as the James Bond of Japan.

This special is unique because Lupin spends a majority of it on a single island. Often I find these kinds of stories to be the most interesting and more character driven. This special is no exception and we get a bit more insight into what drives these characters and how they relate to each other. Along the way Lupin meets a bartender named Maria and also discovers that Jigen, Goemon and Fujiko are all after the treasure for their own reasons. Add into the mix two rival military factions and you have an island rife with craziness and danger. What better place for Lupin to be than right in the center of the action? The pacing is excellent and the story features some fun moments, particularly a scene with a fake gun early in the film that's quite humorous. Zenigata is pretty much useless in this one but he does get in a few good scenes. It's not the most memorable special but it's a lot of fun and fans of the series will no doubt be thrilled to finally own this.

There's no dub for this special like there was for Bye Bye Lady Liberty and the extras are serviceable, with the commentary by LupintheThird.com's Reed Nelson and Anime News Network's Mike Toole being the highlight. There's enough here to satisfy any fan and I'm so thankful to see Discotek continuing with these releases. As long as they keep churning them out I will be more than happy to scoop them up and keep enjoying more Lupin adventures.",1401840000,4,2053,4.60655737704918
