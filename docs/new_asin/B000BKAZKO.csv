8087672,5,B000BKAZKO,"I bought this at the post office way back when! Love it as it has all my favorite sing along songs from the classic Christmas movies:
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Frost the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, Put One Food in Front of the Other, Holly Jolly Christmas, First Toy Maker to the King, We Are Santa's Elves, The Most Wonderful Day of the Year and more!
My son wanted to watch/listen to this over and over when he was a toddler. I highly recommend. Only problem is someone needs to put this out on DVD! I would love if Amazon could get his on DVD and sell it. Wonderful tape that all should enjoy- young and old.",1389312000,,629,4.25
