6453840,5,B00KYL7Y40,"This is the perfect pregnancy workout for anyone beginning-intermediate. There are detailed modifications if you are a beginner or advanced. I actually feel sore after the workout, which is great. Makes me feel like I'm getting a good workout compared to some of the other pregnancy videos out there.",1424304000,3,300,5.142857142857143
6453841,4,B00KYL7Y40,"As someone who lifts very heavy weights between pregnancies (squat 160ish, deadlift 190 etc) this is the closest any prenatal workout has ever gotten to feeling like a challenge. I recommend this to the ladies who have been disappointed with so many other workouts feeling like a warmup.",1420502400,10,287,5.0
6453842,5,B00KYL7Y40,"Most informative pregnancy workout I've seen.  Karyne shows you by demonstrating, and her outfit makes it easy to see how to do it.  You should only use pregnancy workouts being demonstrated by a pregnant instructor, like this one.",1392422400,3,231,5.052631578947368
8662660,2,B00KYL7Y40,Meh. Don't see why this video gets such good reviews.  Didnt do anything for me,1518480000,,79,4.266666666666667
8662661,3,B00KYL7Y40,"I'm not really a fan of this workout. Although the moves are challenging, the video itself is a bit weird, clunky and old. The music and commentary are both strange and it's hard to follow the modifications during the video. Because there are so many modifications, the workout is a bit slow - I feel like the workout could be done much more quickly but is drawn out to 45 minutes.

Two workouts that I really have enjoyed doing during my pregnancy are Joy Southworth's Body by Trimester and Tracy Anderson's The Pregnancy Project. I feel like they are more fun and easy to follow, while also being challenging.",1511136000,,611,4.605504587155964
8662662,4,B00KYL7Y40,"If you see the older version, get it and save money.  I bought the older version with my 1st pregnancy 9 years ago. I purchased the new version when a pop up said the latest was version was available for my 4th pregnancy. Do not waste money! Just buy the old one. They are exactly the same!

About the workout: It is a good (about 45 minutes) work out to put in your rotation for pregnancy. I would consider it intermediate. There are for sure some parts that are challenging but if you are used to Julian Michaels, its not going to be on the same level. I  am in my second trimester and still rotate with Jillian (level 1 at this point), this DVD, and a few other pregnancy DVDS. You do get a good little burn of your shoulders and triceps and lots of  Kegals. Its not my most challenging pregnancy DVD but you still get an excellent workout and is not a waste at all. I highly recommend it. I only gave it 4 stars because the latest version is a total rip off.",1509062400,3,962,4.128342245989304

8662665,4,B00KYL7Y40,"excellent workout for someone who wants to stay in shape while pregnant. I did sweat a little, for someone who was active and regularly did 3-4 times weight lifting , it  should not be challenging. Overall it is good.",1439424000,,217,4.564102564102564
8662666,5,B00KYL7Y40,"Awesome instructions especially the options of beginner, intermediate and advanced for each exercise.",1436918400,,101,6.846153846153846

8662668,4,B00KYL7Y40,A good prenatal workout. I have done it many times during pregnancy. The instructor is in great shape and the workout is sufficiently challenging to make me feel like I earned my haagen dasz bar afterwards. Definitely worth the rental fee.,1435881600,2,239,4.853658536585366
8662669,5,B00KYL7Y40,"Easy to follow, multiple levels and easy to do at home. I recommend!",1425513600,2,68,4.3076923076923075
