The way the film was made is very unique, and I got the feeling I was there. I was actually surprised at some of the things I saw and learned, but that's what makes an exciting film. Get this video! You will love it. It's a keeper for sure.",1058745600,2,408,4.1125
7882815,2,6305073007,A badly made fan film that gives facts and shows fans giving their opinions on various things.  Basically Idalis runs around like a preteen trying to find Leo's house and goes crazy when she spots his car.  You  follow her and see a supposed Leo-look-alike.  The lowest point of the  video is the footage of his highschool when Idalis takes a piece of gum  under Leo's old desk and puts it in her mouth.,923788800,2,403,4.378378378378378
