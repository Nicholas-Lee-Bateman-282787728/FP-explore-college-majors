7922733,5,B00004TJOU,excellent interview with one of the great directors of horror and suspense. time well spent I must say. I was alittle worried about the quality of the dvd after reading the other reviews but my copy was very clear and clean.,1430352000,,224,4.487804878048781
7922734,3,B00004TJOU,"I always loved to hear Hitchcock speak - not just his tone, but his choice in dialogue, all unique. You can tell the man has a pretty high intelligence level (not to mention a wicked sense of humor.)
A Talk with Hitchcock is a two part chat (divided into two week segments) from an 1964 archived interview with the show `Telescope.' The host, although a bit stale for this day and age, asks some pretty thorough questions.

Through their exchanges, I learned some interesting trivia, such as Shadow of a Doubt being Hitchcock's favorite work. The director remained serious and eager to answer questions. He spoke of, among other things, how he got into directing in the first place (kind of just fell in his lap), the art of suspense, what fascinates him about film in general, a little about Psycho, and relationships with screenwriters (although mainly in general without specifics here.)

You can certainly tell it's an older documentary so the style in the way its presented is a bit bland. The setup in general seemed slightly stiff, but this doesn't matter. The content is what counts in this case. The DVD image is grainy but this is to be expected; the quality wasn't bad for its age.

One thing that did peeve me was that there was no subtitles. If the whole thing is constant chatter, aren't including subtitles plausible? Even though I adore Hitch's way of talking, at times I felt I missed a little here and there.

There's not much more I can say in way of comment here without summarizing everything that was asked and answered, but I thought it would be nice to include some little snippets of dialogue that I found impressive, that stuck with me.",1379635200,,1662,4.662116040955631
7922735,4,B00004TJOU,"It was rare for Hitch to do interviews and this is quite a good one.  Definitely a must see if you are in any way a fan.  I found his comments about film in the year 3000 with hypnotism being used quite fascinating.  The only weakness is the ""interviewer"" who seems to be very pleased with himself and speaks in a effected and cockamamie television interviewer voice that grates on you after awhile.  It also could have been longer.  But Hitch is the reason to see this and as always he delivers.  On a sidenote there is some very cool footage of Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery on the set of Marnie in this and one segment where Hitch discusses the tricks of editing(they cut from Hitch smiling and looking at a mother and her child to Hitch smiling again the same way but this time a cut to a young woman in a bikini)left me laughing hysterically.",1099008000,4,847,4.329113924050633
7922736,1,B00004TJOU,"I am very sorry to report troubles with this DVD.  The encoding is not up to par, causing serious jerkiness, and the interview stops dead in its tracks about 15 minutes into the film.
I have never had any problems with other DVDs, and am very dissapointed that this one was so bad.  From what little I heard of the interview, it seemed to have been very good.",973555200,11,359,4.264705882352941
