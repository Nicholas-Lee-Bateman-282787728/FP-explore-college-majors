8622747,5,B00GG7VKRS,"Image Entertainment put out awesome LD and dvd's
Blu Ray's not so much weird

I had this LD for a long time up until i was able to get the Arrow Home video blu ray Import
The cover art alone is just awesome looking
This is by far the best home video art (from the vhs to the blu ray)  it pops-out at you and looks so cool

The PQ is really strong (But, it's Full Frame) i'd go as far as to say Anchorbay/Starz bought this transfer and used it on there special edition dvd
The laserdisc is also bare with no special features something that's really rare for Image
The audio was decent (Think it was Dolby digital stereo i forgot)
This is a must have for any laserdisc collector's out there
I'm very tempted to buy it again  9/10",1450310400,,727,4.098591549295775
