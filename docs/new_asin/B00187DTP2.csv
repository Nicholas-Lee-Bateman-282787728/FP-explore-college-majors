3412216,4,B00187DTP2,"The first thing all people need to know and this has been previously stated do not pay good money for these films. ToeTag the producers happily sell their series for a bit under 20 dollars per movie. The movies are off the wall and grainy. They are disturbing. Do not expect a lot of plot turns and twists from  this movie just killing and gross stuff. I rated it high as it was what I expected it to be. I am one who has gone into a cinematic psychosis and I want to see stuff that really cause me to fear, or to be grossed out or some emotion beyond the normal tripe that is being produced now. If you want dark and disturbing get it and be prepared. Also do not spend big money on this one.",1310601600,22,693,4.021739130434782
3412217,2,B00187DTP2,"I read these reviews and I was excited to see what this movie was about. When I finally saw it, it was such a let down. The opening scene is good, the first ""victims"" if you will. After that first area, it goes downhill fast. It's extremely boring. I found the killers to be really annoying. I wish the killers were interesting, like the girl in Mordum- the second movie in this trilogy. They aren't interesting, all they do is laugh and heckle. Don't buy this, you'll regret spending money on it (find some other means of watching this). If you decide to defy me and order this, for your own sake don't order it from here, it is extremely overpriced here. Just go to the toetag site and order their films from them directly, they are mostly under 20 dollars and you can get them autographed in most cases.",1290902400,17,806,4.38
3412218,4,B00187DTP2,"If your looking for a movie thats off the wall and like nothing you have ever seen before this is the begining of a film series that is just that.director fred vogel and toe tag pictures delivers one of the most sickening and disturbing films to come around.great for fans of extreme gore and horror, not for anyone with a weak stomach or whos faint of heart. Most people probably won't even like this movie.theres not any real plot its filmed blair witch style with just a lot of clips of murders taken place. But who needs a plot when you have lots of blood and gore. So for those of you who are into the most extreme gore go ahead its well worth a watch.",1285286400,3,657,4.222222222222222
3412219,5,B00187DTP2,"Vile, REALLY vile! It's sick, disgusting and extremely REALISTIC (the acting, the effects, etc...)! In fact, it's the most realistic horror movie I have ever seen and I've seen over 1000 horror movies! It could easily be real! I really don't get why it has such a low rating on IMDB... If you can't handle realistic violence, don't watch a fake snuff movie, idiots! Anyway, it's not entertaining in any way, but it's not supposed to be, it's supposed to be shocking and it REALLY is. It's definitely one of the sickest movies ever!

You ""like"" sick and/or disturbing movies? Watch it and Penance, but I really don't recommend Mordum! It's *beep* crazy, depraved, vile, sick, disgusting, evil and etc... etc... etc... like everyone says, but it's also unrealistic (it's just too over-the-top) and boring as hell! Yeah, it has a lot of really messed up *beep* that should be disturbing, but it all feels like the makers told themselves ""let's film the most depraved acts of sex and violence ever (even if they're totally unbelievable) and show people how depraved we are"" and because of that, it just doesn't feel serious and it's not disturbing. It feels like a gross-out contest. The first one is disgusting and disturbing, Mordum is just disgusting.",1257638400,6,1250,4.868544600938967
3412220,1,B00187DTP2,"First, the makers of this film got carried away with the shake-the-camera-to-make-it-look-real ploy. If you are prone to motion sickeness in the slightest, you cannot watch this without developing severe nausea and headache!

Anyone that would believe this movie to be real would be a true cretin. The Blair WItch Project was scary because it was realistic, but this movie cannot even come close to making that claim as well. In my exploration of the gore and snuff genre a few years ago, I found this movie was hyped up more than any others. I found it interesting that on their site, they claimed the Canadian border guards arrested them because they thought it was a real snuff film. Ya,right.

If you can stand the ridiculous camera shaking throughout, you will see one of the dumbest films ever made. A guy with a camera giggling while he films another guy picking up a hooker, and then punching her out. Then more giggling as you see the hooker-puncher has a gal tied to a chair in his house. She is naked and has had a nipple cut off. They play with her crap. Then you see they also have a dead guy in the bathub, which apparenlty smells bad as one of the guys vomits. Then they go to a bar and get in a fight outside.  That's about it folks. No plot,nothing.

Imagining someone glued to the screen, taking notes for an impending call to the police, is absolutely ludicrous. It just shows how you can sell anything and I do mean anything if you whip up enough hype for it.

PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!",1243728000,13,1504,4.454545454545454
3412221,5,B00187DTP2,"this is by far one of the sickest and most vile films ever made, a must have for gorehounds, true gorehounds, not any people who think final destination was the best movie ever. this 2 disc version also has an exclusive audio commentary that will make the film seem like an entirely new movie. highly recommended.",1226361600,2,313,4.607142857142857
3412222,5,B00187DTP2,"Imagine walking along the road and you see a DVD and there is no packaging or name on it to speak of. You take it home and sit in your comfortable chair and on this DVD is some home video footage of someone pouring a beer out, the quality is rough and the photography is shaky.  You see another character come into view and then you are walking down some stairs into a basement and when the light is turned on you see...

That's the movie, period.  Except what you see after that 20 seconds will have you squirming in your seat, as you see graphic murder and rape and stuff too vile to speak about here.  That's the plot of the film.  2 serial killers stalking and killing and laughing about it all. The rest of the 70 minutes is simply murder and mayhem but it's shot like you are watching someone's home video.  I watched the 3rd August Underground Penance DVD before seeing this one but it really doesn't matter the order you see them in, they are all similar and don't necessarily have to be viewed in order.

You follow killers around that have no compassion and are simply out on a ""killing"" streak.  I have to say that the 3rd one I think is a little better than this one but both feature similar material.  It's very well done and the reason for that is that Fred Vogel (the director, writer, killer etc) was a teacher at the Tom Savini school in Pennsylvania so you'll see very graphic special effects and they only get better as you go through the series.  This is not for everyone.  If you are looking for plot, don't look here.  If you are looking for great characterizations, don't look here.  If you are looking to see the most depraved (almost snuff like movie ever made) you are looking in the right place!

That is what you'll get, everything I heard about this film series is exactly what everyone has said it was going to be.  This is what you could classify as Transgressive Cinema, that's the only way to describe it, leave your morals at the door and expect to be shocked. If this is not your cup of tea then I would strongly advise you don't see it.

I gave it 5 stars because this is the first time that all of the hype actually lived up to what was displayed.  The DVD has a TON of extras and I bought the Special Edition with 2 DVD's and it has a couple of different director's commentaries and is full of previews of other ToeTag Pictures films.

If your into the extreme you won't be disappointed, if you aren't, steer clear.  When I get August Underground 2 - Mordam, I'll review it.  That one is supposed to be the most depraved of the entire trilogy. I'm ready!",1224201600,10,2592,4.294238683127572

That is the most misleading description I have ever read.  This is one of the dumbest movies I have ever watched.  I am most disgusted with the time I spent watching this movie, which is now wasted from my life.  Do NOT waste you r time or $ on this BAD movie.",1404086400,6,414,3.869047619047619

3412226,5,B00187DTP2,"TRUE HORROR. THE MOVIE THAT STARTED IT ALL FOR ME. THIS MOVIE INFLUENCED, INSPIRED, AND REVIVED THE HORROR (AND GORE) GENRE FOREVER!!!

  I am disgusted at some of the reviews here on amazon for the August Underground and the trilogy. This movie is obviously not for everyone (and kind of hard to find) so I am surprised to see such harsh reviews from people who ""apparently"" stumbled onto these films. Fred Vogel, first and foremost, is a makeup/prosthetic artist who was even an instructor at the famous Tom Savini school for horror makeup. I mean the guy is as legit as they come. He is a true film fan. Like most of us horror lovers he loves to see gore. Let me rephrase that...he likes to see the gore done RIGHT!!! So much that he spent his life learning how to be the absolute best at doing this for fans like us. And that he has become...the best. Period. His attention to detail is the absolute best you can find in gore fx. His ability to work on a small budget and give a REAL movie is incredible. Now I will say I have watched a couple other films by Fred that have not been as good as these, but how can you top something that is so perfect and can never be touched on its level? I am not writing this review to tell you about what happens in the movie. This movie is much more effective without knowing the details going in. What I CAN tell you is that if you are looking for something to disturb you...to sicken you...to terrify you with its reality...this is the movie you need to see. The most accurate and honest depiction of murder/serial killing that I have ever seen. To be honest it's probably the most accurate depiction that even exists. It's holds nothing back. The movie is so real that the main characters may sound like YOU at times (not specifically during the killings or anything just in general). Sometimes even their actions and jaded behavior can make you laugh a bit yourself inside. This terrifies you even more because that's when you realize that these people can be ordinary people like you and me...but capable of such extraordinary evil. I promise if you are a fan of gore, torture, extreme violence, disturbing content, anything like that...this will be your all time favorite movie and trilogy. It will never get old. It will always be as horrifying with each viewing if not more. Do yourself a favor watch them in order. It's the way they were meant to be seen. And please if you haven't seen these films, prepare yourself for the nastiest guiltiest pleasure you've ever feasted your eyes on. Pure cinematic horror. Pure genius.",1400025600,8,2572,4.515021459227468

3412228,3,B00187DTP2,"It's alright I guess, the opening scene is pretty brutal and I do like the snuff film style of filming. The acting is pretty good too but I think a lot of the intensity of the movie is just from the characters shouting at each other. Not actually as brutal as you would expect. I would recommend The Human Centipede 2 or Flower of Flesh and Blood if you want some serious sickness.",1391904000,5,381,4.232876712328767
3412229,1,B00187DTP2,"Not worth even twenty bucks, this movie is complete garbage, I understand trying to be hard core and graphic, but this is no good, Salo was made in 1976 and was more realistic and believable than this film, I would say pass on the other two movies they have made as well, check out Lucifer Valentine's trilogy of a rare ""vomit gore"" genre, now that's worth twenty or more dollars",1388880000,3,379,4.428571428571429

3412231,3,B00187DTP2,"August Underground, a 2001 shock film directed by Fred Vogel, is quite possibly one of the most pointless films ever made. There is literally no plot, and the entire film just focuses on these two sadistic idiots who go around town getting into fights, picking up women and offering them money to look at their private parts, and then beating them afterwards, torturing people in their basement, and overall acting like a bunch of depraved retards. They constantly laugh and jeer, which had the odd effect of making me laugh alot as well. It was hardly disturbing, only a few scenes made me queasy, but I was expecting alot worse. The film was filled with tons of dark humor, I don't know if it was intentional or not, but it was funny to me, so if you enjoy dark comedy, you might like this, otherwise don't waste your time.",1364601600,6,825,4.543624161073826

8268724,4,B00187DTP2,"Aptly including ""underground"" in its very title, this shot-on-video found-footage horror is WAY too over the top for the average viewer, who will simply not be able to stomach even its first five minutes. At the same time, it pursues a realism and slowness of pace that mimics everyday life. Many scenes seem as of if they truly were filmed just as two vicious and disorganized young serial killers turned their camcorder on in a hurry. Others seem to fizzle, until upon further viewing one might see a deliberate depiction of the awkwardness of reality in them. Unlike most movies of any kind, the filmmakers here do not tell their sick characters' stories to your face and spell them out for you. Inferences about them may be drawn from the video action on your screen, and nothing else. Not stilted dialogue, not fancy-schmancy camera angles, nothing - just the dirty and horrifying video unfolding before you. This is a technique that bespeaks a seriousness not found in many low-budget works of horror. Like many no-budget underground films, this one seems to stumble upon its art by accident. But that is not likely the case here, as August Underground works as a depiction of hell no less effectively than Dante's Inferno. Followed by two increasingly hellish sequels.",1473465600,,1275,4.907407407407407
8268725,2,B00187DTP2,"Saw it online.  It is disturbing for sure.  It may help that the picture quality is so poor you can't see all the detail.  It may be more annoying than disturbing.  This applies to this and part two.  I haven't seen the third, but read the picture quality is a lot better.  It is about as dumb as a movie can be.

8268727,1,B00187DTP2,"""August Underground""(2001) is directed by Fred Vogel. This is the first in a trilogy of films. In the tradition of films like ""A Blair Witch Project"" we get a movie with a handheld camera and evidently the portrayal of real events as seen after the fact as viewed on a tape. One question to be asked is does this really give us a feeling of reality or is this just a crutch for those that have little talent. The film gives us a random series of clips that amount to a glimpse into the lives of two amoral psychopathic delinquents who go about doing what ever they want to those around them. There is no plot, or pacing, or character development, or story, or interesting use of camera angles, or editing, or tension. The film doesn't add up to much on many levels. All in all it amounts to a lot of tedium even though it is obvious the director was trying hard to gross out his audience.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" wasn't the greatest film in the world but at least it had some tension, and some intrigue. Maybe instead check out some films with similar themes like ""A Clockwork Orange"", or even the ""Saw"" series.",1443139200,2,1114,4.381642512077295
