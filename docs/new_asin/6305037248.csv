7881426,5,6305037248,"ROCK AND ROLL HEART was a term (and TITLE) or Lou Reed's own coinage, of course, and it was an apt a self-description as he'd ever come up with...and therefore a perfect one for any documentary on the artist.  And this AMERICAN MASTERS entry is a pretty darn good one.  Not a lot of new info for aficionados, I suppose, but very well put together and edited.  And not everybody is aficionado.  Me, I followed the Velvets at a distance (I was a Smalltown USA based fan) and read everything I could about Lou, Andy, Nico, the Factory scene and all that stuff.  But even the best-illustrated books and articles couldn't convey the excitement and the reality of it like a well produced film.  I always knew there was great footage out there, and always hoped that somewhere somehow it would surface.  Turns out, there probably wasn't ALL that much--at least of live performance--with creative editing (thank you, director Timothy Greenfield-Sanders) what footage IS included establishes as a good a feel for the Zeitgeist as you're gonna get.

There is a fair amount of performance footage from the ROCK'N'ROLL ANIMAL era, which is revelatory.  I was one of the purists who didn't care for ""Arena Rock Lou,"" even though I knew it was a smart career move.  Watching the performance clip of ""Sweet Jane,""  I can't help see that work in a new light.  Very professional, of course, we always knew that.  What's interesting is seeing a guitarless Lou,  moving so smooth and lithe and so dam n natural you'd think Iggy Pop had copped moves from HIM.

Much of the second half of the video WAS new to me, so I'm NOT listing myself among the true aficionados.  I've never been entirely sure why I only listened sporadically to Lou's post-80s work.  It's not that I wasn't interested in what he was up to.  So I need ""Lou Reed 101"" as much as anybody.  Particularly touching is the section from the MAGIC AND LOSS era,  a time when the darkness is no longer the romanticized  one of post- adolescent, neo-Romantic English majors but one stemming from the pen of  a true poet facing the very real specters of age and death.  With the passing of this true ""American Master"" with the purist of ""rock'n'roll hearts,""  a revisiting of this concise, but comprehensive treatment of the artist's creative life and provides us viewers necessary perspective. This 1998 documentary demands an epilogue at this point, however.  I hope that can happen.",1388188800,,2425,4.716666666666667
7881427,4,6305037248,"For the fact that there is no other 'biography' or documentary about Reed, this is a must-see for Velvet Underground and Reed aficionados.  The highlights are seeing interview footage with Reed, which I believe is a fairly big deal as he generally avoids such things, the old concert footage, and two of the people who ""Walk on the Wild Side"" were about.  It was also nice to see his peers and followers espouse on his greatness and influence.  I'm with the reviewer who would've liked more focus on his early career and I was severely disappointed that the early 80s period that he spent with Robert Quine was only quickly highlighted by concert clips of ""New Sensations"" (a masterpiece of a performance as Reed and Quine's guitar interplay SLAYS the record version, can be seen in full on the ""Live in Jersey"" VHS) and ""Kill Your Sons"" (seen in full on the DVD ""A Night with Lou Reed"").  Quine himself did not even get an acknowledgment which is sad as he was the person to get Reed to pick up the guitar again and get him to release the best album, ""Blue Mask"", that he had done since ""Transformer"".  I know that their split was not amicable but it would have made for a greater story about Reed overcoming drug and alcohol abuse and making brilliant music, albeit for a short time, once again.",1245542400,4,1297,4.5256410256410255
7881428,4,6305037248,"I really enjoyed this DVD, I have always liked Lou Reed's music but did not have much of an understanding of his history. This is a good documentary style DVD that gives you a feel for the man, the times and what influenced his music. Interviews with friends, colleagues and other artists give you a good feel for what he is about. If you like his music and want to know more about the most difficult person to ever interview this is well worth while.",1127088000,4,451,4.317647058823529
7881429,5,6305037248,"Lou Reed's Rock n' roll Heart documentary is a sensitive and revealing look into the prince of darkness.
We get incredible live footage of Lou doing ""Kicks"" and a sample of Lou and his rock n' roll animal band tearing thru ""Sweet Jane"" with Lou dressed all in black with collar entering the stage as someone screams out ""play Heroin"" and he screams back ""shut the f##k up"".
We also get to hear an acoustic take of ""Heroin"" live from Italy which is pretty terrific and a hard edged rendition of ""dirty blvd"" is included as well, so from a performance standpoint this program delivers.
The basis of the program covers how Lou got started in music from his first guitar lessons to his high school bands to his songwriting job for a company that catered to whatever fads were happening at the time.
Lou also discusses his joy of meeting one of his mentors by the name of Delmore Schwartz in college and how his poetic genius helped shape Lou's art.
The program then goes into the beginnings of the Velvet Underground which obviously follows the band's acceptance into the Andy Warhol factory.
Here we get to see that whole wild scene where art,dancing,film, and music all came together thru Andy Warhol's artistic eye with revealing interviews from people who worked in the factory and performance footage.
One of the best bits of the program is where 2 of the original characters who make up the ""Walk on the Wild Side"" classic discuss the song then sing the song with such touching adoration and nostalgia.
A segment about Lou's insane ""Metal machine Music"" project follows then they touch lightly on a few other ventures then discuss in length the ""New York"" album and so on.
Interviews from Patti Smith,Thurston Moore,David Bowie,David Byrne, and Jim Carroll are all entertaining and informative as they tell us what part of Lou Reed influenced and touched their life.
The video ends in a most special way as the camera focuses on each individual who participated in the program.
The individual has to stare at the camera without moving just like Andy Warhol used to do in his screen tests and it's a hoot to see people like Jim Carroll and David Bowie just crack up in the middle of their pose.
There's other goodies that make up the program but i don't want to give it all away because it's truly a wonderful and heartwarming documentary.
I've seen it many times and it's always fresh and sincerely moving so if you love Lou then you will love his rock n' roll heart.
As Lou said ""My life was saved by Rock n' roll!!! Rock n'Roll!!!"" and i hope your life can also find the salvation...

7881430,4,6305037248,"This PBS video makes the case that Lou Reed is not just a guy who makes thrilling rock music.  He is an Artist (with a capitol A) in the great modernist tradition who experiments with his life in order to test the  limits.  This sounds forbidding, but this documentary is fun and  unpretentious and exhilarating.",959817600,9,312,4.618181818181818
