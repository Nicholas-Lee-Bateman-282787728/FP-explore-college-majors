8455693,5,B0053TWVYQ,"HOLY MOLY, this is a masterpiece. This is my The Room. I absolutely love the absurd goofiness of this horror flick. This is proof that James Hong needs to make more films and at the same time proof that he should not.",1506470400,,217,4.190476190476191

8455696,3,B0053TWVYQ,"I don't know what possessed me to buy this - it was somewhat amusing but that's about it.  Horrible acting, terrible special effects and makeup.  Gives a new meaning to low budget.",1395532800,,180,4.59375
8455697,5,B0053TWVYQ,"James Hong is great and funny actor, writer, director, producer.  The movie is a good time and makes you happy.",1364083200,,111,4.55
8455698,1,B0053TWVYQ,"This movie looks like it is going to be good gem about black magic and stuff, but the acting, budget, set and characters are so bad it's hard to watch it all the way through.  It has asian african american and caucasian people interacting in ways that are unreal.  It seems like they walked up a street and found people to fill in parts for the movie.  You never get the feel that this is a real movie and you never feel for the actors.",1346716800,,436,4.105882352941176
8455699,3,B0053TWVYQ,"I have to say I've seen similar plots: someone killing people in order to stay young forever.  It's not an original idea by any means.  And while it did have some interesting elements (the dead who won't stay dead or in their place), I just couldn't get past the bad acting or the dj vu feeling I had throughout that I've seen this before and a lot better.  It didn't even have the high camp factor going for it.

Stale by any name, call it what you will, it's still just a moldy retread.",1338422400,,488,4.159574468085107
8455700,5,B0053TWVYQ,I've been looking for this title a long time and found it here for a good price. New and unused. Great service by seller. Very fast international shipping. Highly recomended seller. Would buy from again.,1209859200,,203,4.828571428571428
8455701,4,B0053TWVYQ,"This movie has a sort of unusual atmosphere about it.

I think it may have something to do with how the lighting was done.

The story itself is also rather unique but it brings in many tried and true horror movie ideas such as magical pendants, zombies, and a mysterious god that grants eternal youth to people (for a price that is).

This is sort of a fun movie to watch.  Because of the dark humor you never really take it too seriously.

James Hong is actually quite comical at times and never really becomes a frightening character in this movie.

Don't get impatient and turn it off before the last 30 seconds or so which contains the most dramatic scene in the entire movie.
