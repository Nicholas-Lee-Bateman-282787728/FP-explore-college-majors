3895202,2,B002BORF4C,"I watched this with my daughter because she is reading the book for her class. The movie was just ok, though it did stay fairly true to the book. If not for that, I would not watch or recommend this movie.",1385769600,,205,4.024390243902439

3895206,5,B002BORF4C,"In my opinion greatest dog movie ever! Maybe even better than Where the Red Fern Grows! The only decent version of this film in my opinion and every bit as good as I remembered from when I was a kid in 1976 when this first aired!
It is different from the book but the story as it is in the book I believe needed a little embellishing and it is very little. It, if possible, tells the story even MORE from the dog's perspective than the book does and I don't feel at all in a cheesy way. <3 <3 <3 <3 <3",1438560000,,501,3.8737864077669903

3895209,4,B002BORF4C,"Jack London's classic story of two men driven by gold fever, battling the elements in the frozen Klondike. John Beck stars as John Thornton, an adventurer who depends on a canine companion for survival in the hostile environment of an Alaskan winter. John Thornton and Francois team up and pool their money to buy a magnificent, powerfully built dog, Buck, to lead the team pulling their sleds as they plod their way across the harsh, snow-covered Alaskan wilderness in search of gold. Along the way, Thornton and Francois clash and Buck fights a deadly battle with a rival dog. The drama was filmed on location in the California High Sierra, Southern California and Wyoming. ""Exciting and suspenseful family entertainment.""",1433376000,2,724,5.092436974789916
3895210,1,B002BORF4C,"Was not what I thought.  Had to order the entire movie just to be able to skip ahead to figure out if it kept with the written story.  It was a waste of money because the story clip on the trailer did not show how much the movie did not keep with the story.  So, when I found out I was very upset how much it did not keep with the story.  I tried to cancel my order but was not allowed since I supposedly watched it already.  Anyway, I would not recommend this movie at all.  It does not keep with the story.",1433376000,,508,3.8365384615384617

8361794,1,B002BORF4C,"There are many ways you can successfully adapt this book to screen, but changing the main character's (Buck, the dog, to Raphael) is completely distracting to anyone who has read the book, or like me showing it to students who would just be angry about the name change because they love Buck so much.
