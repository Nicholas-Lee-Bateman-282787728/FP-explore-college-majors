Some people will likely be turned off by this film due to the violence, and the surreal & gloomy feel which rarely lets up. I happen to like that sort of thing, so it worked out pretty well for me. This film actually reminded me a lot of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive (vise versa actually), with their great film noir like feel. Reading some of the other reviews, I saw that a few people said they were turned off by the 'homoerotic nature' of the film. The movie has a few 'not-so-straight' (Amazon won't let me use the G-word :) characters (including Takeshi, who is excellent!), but it's nothing I would label as 'homoerotic'. I'm as straight as they get and the film didn't bother me any... It's nothing anyone hasn't seen before in Pulp Fiction or The Crying Game. Anyway, Gonin is a great film which I do recommend... Though some of you may want to rent it first :).",1089504000,2,945,4.405714285714286
7934498,2,B000059XU9,"This movie is perfect for all you bisexual guys out there.  If you get turned on by homerotic films, this is for you.  But me, like most people am not bisexual.  I do not recomend this to most people.  I bought this crap in chinatown, thinking WOW!  A Beat Takeshi movie $5.  I am a fan so I had to buy it.  Little did I know it turned out to be a little bit too far out for me.  My advice don't get it.  I have since, given this movie to a bisexual guy next door.  Instead get Violent Cop or Fireworks.",1036454400,2,503,3.843137254901961
7934499,2,B000059XU9,"Gonin is a homoerotic picture masquerading as a heist film. The heist means very little in the scope of the picture, since director Ishii seems preoccupied with homoerotic themes, phallic symbols, and sadomasochism. In writer/director Ishii's world, men senselessly beats each other and uses other methods of violence as a thinly-guised excuse to express their repressed homosexual desires towards other men. I suppose it is a great movie for sociologists fascinated with the link between male aggression and dormant male eroticism. Unfortunately, I do not care for either topic, and find the movie to be incredibly stupid and lacking in common sense. I am also turned off by the Japanese version of nonchalant violence, where men shoots each other while showing as much emotion as a Buddy Lee the doll. The most disppointing thing about Gonin is that director Ishii is an incredibly talented filmmaker, and there are bursts of brilliant cinematography and mise-en-scene that is just inspiring.",1013212800,,994,5.2974683544303796
7934500,4,B000059XU9,"When I first saw this movie on TV - and the movie seemed to be heavily cut - I only thougth that Takashi Ishii is really a director with talent and the ability to create something special and unique.
The fighting scences looked sometimes very improvised, but were in fact strongly choreographed and filmed in a stylish way that gave you an intense feeling while watching.
But there were also scences where I didn't get the point. For example: The ex-cop is sitting in a restaurant, his wife and daughter are at the restroom, so he is waiting. Then a cut and suddenly everybody in the restaurant has disappeard - no guests can be seen anymore, no waiters and so on. The wife and the daughter come back and the action begins... and where is the rest? That was definitely a directional flaw.
2. When the man with the glasses comes home he sees his daughter - all fine. He goes in the room of his son, but he can't even see, that his son is lying dead in the bed. His wife has obviously left him, so he is phoning a prostitute and 2 secs later the action begins again. Exscuse me, but that's terribly directed.
3. The two desperates are attacked by the two hitmen, escaping in a restroom, waiting there behind a door made of wood. The hitmen fire through the door, they scream and seconds later, the hitmen are away. That's sheer nonsense in my opinion...
The characters seem to be underdeveloped. What's up with their background story? Nothing can be found... Especially the gigolo. I still don't know what's up with that person.
First and last an interesting movie with some flaws but a great atmosphere, never before seen acts of violence and a very bizarre
ending.",1006300800,,1664,4.513245033112582
7934501,5,B000059XU9,"This is a remarkable and unique Japanese anit-Yakuza movie.  An old story really (are there any new stories) about 5 desperate men who decide to rob the local Yakuza to solve their personal-financial problems and subsequently suffer the consequences.  Told in a flashy, neon lit visual style and shot in semi darkness on slimy urban streets, there is no breathing room in this exciting thriller, no quiet time for reflection or contemplation, it's flat out action start to finish.  Wow.  It moves with the relentless momentum of classical tragedy and once the ball is rolling we just have to wait and witness the carnage and inevitable outcome.  The violence is graphic and effective on a personal level.  Filled with actors who are familiar from the Japanese cinema, the legendary Beat Takeshi has a supporting but pivitol role as an assassin involved in a brutal sado-masochistic relationship with his assassin-partner dispatched to off the tragic heroes (the five of the title).  You've never seen Beat Takeshi like this before.  Written and directed by Takashi Ishii, the man responsible for the script of Evil Dead Trap, this movie is mature, complex and effective on a human level in ways that Evil Dead Trap is not.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed.  This is a unique take on a familiar story as we follow the lives of five men, trapped in lives of not so quiet desperation.  Tragic and passionate, this is a movie you won't soon forget.  The white subtitles of this Hong Kong import are less than perfect and the truncated, shorthand translation leaves much to be desired.  Even so, check it out.",996537600,3,1612,4.86080586080586
