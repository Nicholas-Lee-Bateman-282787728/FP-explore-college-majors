8331116,5,B001OPUWQC,"This is one of the best music DVDs I have ever purchased. Every solo in the group played great. The only thing I disliked is the fact that there were no extras. No behind the scene extras. No bio's about the members in the group. But, overall the play of these cats are great.",1323561600,2,276,4.12962962962963
8331117,2,B001OPUWQC,"I saw Maynard twice live, and I also own the DVD ""Live from the Top"".  I have yet to see any DVD that captures what I saw in concert, but this has to be the worst attempt I've seen.  The band sounded bored, Maynard was not at the top of his game, and overall it was an extremely lackluster performance.  ""Live from the Top"" isn't great, but it's a better alternative than this.",1291593600,6,377,4.136986301369863
