The author (Gwen), provides easy to follow steps and techniques anyone can learn, I really like her method of instruction. My girlfriend was amazed from what I learned. A great way to improve the relationship with your partner!",1427760000,,333,4.758620689655173
8689601,5,B00PX0BGKK,Gwen is fantastic. My wife and I have both learned so much from her workshop. Her direction has helped us connect and communicate better as well as learning really meaningful and thoughtful methods of massage.,1422662400,,209,5.0
8689602,5,B00PX0BGKK,"My husband and I had the good fortune to attend Gwen Guarino's Couples Massage Workshop several years ago.  We have also received individual massages from Gwen.  She is the consummate professional and a very caring massage therapist who tailors her massage work to her clients' individual needs.  When I saw that she had a DVD available that explains her couples massage techniques, I was thrilled to purchase it.  The video is very clear and well-paced and explains all the steps and techniques of her workshop in perfect detail.  My husband and I have used it as a refresher course to the in-person workshop that we previously attended.  If you are looking for a great explanation of massage therapy that you can share with your partner, I highly recommend this video.",1422316800,,770,4.884615384615385
