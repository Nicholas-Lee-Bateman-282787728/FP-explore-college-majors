8351182,5,B0025UTVFI,"Incredible documentary that I viewed years ago on PBS long before DVDs were available and I am overjoyed that this rare documentary about Herman Melville's life was finally released to dvd.  Thank You! Originally there was a manuscript of this documentary that I had previously purchased but was lost in transit while moving from upstate NY to SC.  I would love to purchase another copy of this written ""Dammed In Paradise"" transcript again but have been unsuccessful in finding one.  Please let me know of any feedback regarding availability of this transcript .  Thank You!",1379635200,3,575,5.021052631578947
