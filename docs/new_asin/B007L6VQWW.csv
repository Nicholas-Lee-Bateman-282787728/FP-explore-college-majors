5097230,1,B007L6VQWW,"I hated this movie.  It was so silly.  The girl made the cult look more stupid than they already were.  Come on?  She was from the future???  I can't stop laughing.  Maybe, I missed something.  I don't think I did.  When it first started, I said to myself:  What am I watching this for?  I thought it was stupid, stupid and then more stupid.  I kept watching, trying to make sense of it, but to no avail.  I didn't want to waste my $1.00 rental fee.",1349395200,4,449,4.093023255813954
5097231,4,B007L6VQWW,"Sound Of My Voice is a contemplative movie that looks at two journalists investigating a cult.
Throughout the film the viewer is left in doubt as to the nature of the cult, are they good or do they have bad intentions?  Are the fantastic claims of the cult leader true?

The acting among the three leads is excellent, especially Brit Marling as the charismatic cult leader.  She really does pull of an interesting character that you can believe would pull people to her.

The films goes at a slow pace but you couldn't call it boring.  That said it was missing something that would have made it a better film.  While I'm open to endings that leave you with questions this films ending left more questions than I liked.  It almost felt like an act was missing.

I rated the film 4 stars but I think it deserves a 3 1/2 but amazon wouldn't let me do that.  Just to put my scoring in context I think most Amazon.com reviews are too generous.  It seems like everything has 4 stars.  This film hovers somewhere between above average and good, but nowhere near great.",1349222400,,1061,4.44559585492228
5097232,5,B007L6VQWW,"The casting was perfect.
The cinematography was perfect.
I cannot believe there have been no review's written of this - so, I'll give it my mediocre attempt.

Just when you think you've got it all figured out...psh! I love this kind of movie! I would have followed her voice anywhere! I do not wish to spoil it for anyone else...and I hate to compare it to 'The Sixth Sense'...but it was like seeing that for the first time and going ""What the-OH!???!"" but a million times better!

Amazing job on this.

Thank you for opening my narrow mind...even for as open as it is.",1349222400,4,569,4.451923076923077
5097233,4,B007L6VQWW,"Having seen and been impressed by Brit Marling's other work Another Earth, it was with some enthusiasm I ventured forth to see this movie. As much as Another Earth has the ability to put on the appearance of being a bigger than Indie movie, The Sound of My Voice is clearly in the Indie tradition, and perhaps the reality tradition, yet manages to convey a sense of the mystical as well.

A documentary filmmaker Peter, and his girlfriend penetrate the mysterious, inner workings of a cult. The members shower, are blindfolded, and driven to a secret meeting place. He is a schoolteacher with dreams of being a director. The mysterious and charismatic cult leader Maggie played by Brit Marling, has returned from the future, to save a select group of people, her followers. She breathes through a tube in the nose, yet occasionally removes the tube and seems to breathe with no bother.

How one can get a camera in without being seen, and film without being noticed is a rather interesting question.

On the surface she seems genuine and legit, though, if you're like me you will wonder, if she is a deluded soul or something more sinister. She appears to have extraordinary empathic and intuitive powers, yet some of what she does raises questions. She punishes bad behavior, and rewards compliance. I found it rather engaging, as when one member is ejected for asking questions, yet she claims this is not the reason for his ejection.

Yet other members clearly become more compliant when she reacts like this. These tactics appear to work on the Peter, when she makes a very strange request of him, and she alienates him from his girlfriend. Maggie remains a mysterious character even to the end, with some intriguing twists and I loved the end.

If you are new to Brit Marling's movies, I recommend Another Earth more highly. It won two awards at the Sundance Film Festival.

Like Another Earth this is quite thought provoking, there are a few parallels such as the search for meaning, and in this case the search for truth.

Sometimes necessity is the mother of invention and Brit Marling who was struggling like other actresses to get roles decided to go a different route and write the screenplays for the characters she would play and work with the directors she knew.
I really admire that type of entrepreneurial spirit and this type of accomplishment.
Last week I saw her in the Richard Gere movie Arbitrage so her strategy appears to have paid off.

I do hope she will continue to make these types of movies as it brings a wonderful diversity to our moviegoing experiences.

I think you will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.",1348272000,28,2641,4.723913043478261
5097234,4,B007L6VQWW,"""Sound of My Voice"" (85 min.) brings the story of Peter (played by Christopher Denham) and his girlfriend Lorna, who in true ""investigative journalism"" mode are infiltrating a small cult of some sort, with a view of making a documentary to expose the cult. The cult is led by a young woman called Maggie (played by Brit Marling), who claims to be from ""54"", as in... 2054. (Please don't ask yoursel how Peter and Lorna found out about this new small cult or how they were able to infiltrate it, it is never explained in the movie.) The cult seems to be made up of about 10 people who are brought blind-folded to the basement of a non-descript house somewhere in Los Angeles.

In his ""other"" life, Peter is a substitute teacher of an all-girl class of 8 year olds. At a key point in the movie Maggie asks Peter to bring one specific girl from his class to her. How did Maggie know of this girl? Will Peter give in to this request, which amounts to kidnapping? To say much more about the plot would be to ruin your viewing experience. I thought this movie, which clearly was made on a nickel and a dime, was done quite nicely. There is a certain amount of tension from the very beginning that doesn't let up at all until the end of the movie (when Hot Chip's Thieves of the Night plays over the end credits).

Special kudos to Zal Batmanglij (director and co-writer) and of course also to Brit Marling, who also co-wrote the script for this movie. This movie is MILES away from your typical Hollywood main fare. I have no idea why it took over a year for this movie to be released in the theatre (it created quite a buzz when it premiered at the 2011 SXSW film festival), but better later than never I suppose. If you are in the mood for a good indie movie, I can readily recommend ""Sound of My Voice"".",1341446400,36,1800,4.322485207100592

They begin to question their skepticism, and wonder if it may be for real. This is a unique film that walks a fine line between documentary style realism and dramatic filmmaking. It has a very realistic feel to it, and is well-scripted and well-acted. The conclusion has everyone involved curious about the validity of the claims of the cult leader, including the audience. If you are looking for a movie that is interesting and unusual, seek this one out.",1340841600,5,606,4.62037037037037
5097236,5,B007L6VQWW,"I drove 70 miles to see this movie.  I wish it would have had a wider release but as of four weeks after the April 27th release date the closest was 70 miles.  Great movie overall.  You really feel as part of the action.  The extraneous events were tied together beautifully in the end.  I didn't think Brit Marling could come up with an ending as provocative as she did in ""Another Earth"" but she certainly did.

I hope Brit Marling and the directors she worked with here and in ""Another Earth."" Keep making movies like this.  They are so innovative like the Apple Computer of movies.  Please don't try to go mainstream.  Do things like this and you'll become mainstream.  Brit if you ever read this Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.",1339459200,6,733,4.443609022556391

5097291,2,B007L6VQWW,The ending was horrible. After watching and really getting into the OA we found this movie after looking up the main character and reading about her rise in Hollywood. Maybe my expectations were too high since I enjoyed the OA so much. Or maybe it was because she played a character in the movie that was too similar to the character she played in the OA. I wouldn't recommend watching the movie if you like the OA because The movie ruined it to me a little. Maybe it will wear off over the coming year long wait for season two.,1483401600,2,528,4.29

After watching The OA on Netflix, my feeling is almost that this was an early ""sketch"" for that show.  It examines some of the same themes.  If you've seen and enjoyed Marling's other work then you will probably enjoy this.  If you don't know her work, you might want to try some of the others (I'd recommend The East, and Another Earth) first.",1483315200,4,500,4.166666666666667

5097296,5,B007L6VQWW,"When investigative journalists, Peter Aitken (Christopher Denham) and Lorna Michaelson (Nicole Vicius)  gain access to a super-obscure cult, they believe they've hit documentary gold. It's the perfect, bizarre story for their talents, complete w/ ultra-devoted followers, a secret handshake, and Maggie (Brit Marling), the enigmatic leader of the group. All goes well, until questions arise between Peter and Lorna -who also happen to be in a serious relationship- as to just how deeply they are becoming involved w/ Maggie's ""teachings"". Maggie claims to be a traveler from the future (2054 to be exact), which, though seemingly absurd, is made quite believable by Maggie herself. Peter appears to be swept away by her, but reassures Lorna that it's all part of the ruse. Or is it? Eventually, Maggie calls upon Peter to do something for her that is dangerous, illegal, and totally insane. The whole movie hinges on his decision, and leads to the unexpected, mind-F-ing climax! SOUND OF MY VOICE is a quietly menacing film, never overplaying its metaphysical hand. Highly recommended...",1468713600,,1087,5.319767441860465

5097336,5,B007L6VQWW,"A more nuanced film than I expected - the title drew me in, but that's obviously intentional with the subject matter and how that phrase is used within it.  Yes, investigative reporters find weird things in a cult.  Yes, there's creepy behavior and cover-ups.  And yes, it's a tension of ""real"" vs ""crazy or charlatan""?
But the artistry of the film plays with all of this so well, played along the acting and lines, and how sound is used to separate, isolate, open and close in various scenes.
It may be an imperfect film, but may we be faced with so many more lovely imperfections.
To crib one of the reviews in the WIki article:
""a delicate, mesmeric thing that dances darkly along the edges of psychology, religion and science-fiction, raising questions about faith, identity, self-betterment and romantic connection.""",1445731200,,821,4.892086330935252

5097377,5,B007L6VQWW,"I am giving this movie 5 stars because I really enjoyed it and I couldn't wait to see how it would end.

But the ending left me with so many questions.

Some spoilers.

I think that the ending was a twist -- that Maggie actually was from the future.
The ""cult"" really was a group of ""chosen ones"" -- chosen by Maggie (because she knew them from the future) to bring to a ""safe place"" which is back to the future.

In addition to Klaus, there were other men (driving the van, acting as bodyguards, appearing from upstairs) but we never really get a good look at them. I think that there were many people living upstairs from the basement, all ready to go to the safe place, so Maggie was just choosing and organizing the last of the new group members, which would include Abigail.

How did Peter and Lorna find out about this ""cult"" that they were investigating, and how did they manage to get invited in? The cult was obviously very strict and secretive, so you couldn't just walk up to a member and ask to join them.
The movie starts out that they are doing a documentary voluntarily and secretly, but I think that they were actually chosen by Maggie, and they don't even know or remember how they really got in. I think that they were led to believe that they joined for a documentary by brainwashing. The secret filming was abandoned too quickly because it just didn't really matter to them.

How did the other members get in? My guess is that they were indeed ""chosen ones"" just like Lorna and Peter, being tested for loyalty and whether they were good enough to go to the safe place. Cults are known for having members that are mostly young girls, mostly runaways, but this cult took married couples which was strange. Also, cult leaders are always men (who always have sex with all of the young girls) but this cult did not have that purpose -- the cult's purpose was to fix the past and fix the future.

Was Maggie actually having trouble breathing and, therefore, needed the oxygen tube? Was she really allergic to every food and, therefore, was growing her own food? This would be a lot of trouble to go through if it wasn't necessary and true.

Why did Abigail always wear a hat?  Was it a coincidence that Maggie always covered her head?

Who was the man (it was assumed that he was her father, but maybe not) who came to Abigail at bedtime? I think that he was training Abigail to be a terrorist.

Why did this man give Abigail an injection in her foot?

Why was Abigail lying on the floor in front of the bus stop, and the teachers were saying that she did it all of the time? Was Abigail sick, just like Maggie?

What was Abigail doing on the floor with all of those tiny black building blocks? Was she building something really important and not just playing? She was doing it until the room got dark (the sun went down) and it looked like a mission.

Why did Abigail and Maggie look so much alike? Abigail really was Maggie's mother.
Maggie was too intent on kidnapping a specific child, not just any child.

Was the plan to bring the group to a ""safe place"" really to bring them back to the future? And Abigail too? But Abigail would already exist in the future, as her older self. My guess is that Abigail died in the future, and then Maggie time traveled, and then Maggie wanted to find Abigail and bring her back with her to the future. Something horrible happened to cause Maggie to time travel, something so traumatic that Maggie lost her memory for a while.

Was Carol really with the Department of Justice? I think that Carol was also from the future, and her mission was to prevent Maggie from meeting with Abigail. The photo that Carol showed to Lorna really looked altered -- it looked like a black-and-white photo with Maggie's picture added in. Carol told Lorna that Maggie was a wanted criminal, but that was only Carol's word, so she could have been lying. I don't remember if Carol showed a badge, but if she did, it could have been a fake. It was strange that Carol followed Lorna into the sauna at the gym, to actually put on a towel and watch her -- she could have spoken to her in a dozen other more professional ways. Why didn't Carol also talk to Peter? What was Carol doing in the hotel room with the secret Bloomingdales box and the ammunition?

Carol told Lorna that she would tell her what Maggie really wanted Abigail for -- but she doesn't tell (because she was lying -- there was no other reason).

Carol ""arrests"" Maggie and takes her away. I don't think that she took her to jail at all, but somewhere else, like back to the future for her own purposes. Why wouldn't Carol also arrest Peter for kidnapping if she were really from the Department of Justice?

Lorna's comment did not make sense -- ""So that's why she never leaves the basement.""  Criminals don't normally hide away, they are out all of the time, doing new crimes. Maggie was in the basement because she was sick which is why she needed oxygen and special food, not because she was hiding.

What was Maggie going to talk to Abigail about, if they had not been interrupted?
I think that Maggie was going to kidnap Abigail and take her along with the cult back to the future.

How did Abigail know the handshake?  She must have created it and taught it to Maggie.
However, why would an 8 year old create such a secret handshake? That didn't make any sense.
It would only make sense if Abigail created the handshake in the future when she was older.
I also found it strange that Abigail was not afraid when she was kidnapped.
Did the handshake have some special meaning in the future?
Like Carol said, the military, or some other secret group?

How did Maggie know that Peter had a child in his class named Abigail? How did Maggie have the school's yearbook with Abigail's picture in it? Peter must have been ""chosen"" because of his connection to Abigail and his ability to kidnap her. Maggie must have been from the future, able to research the ""past"" so that she would know where Abigail (her mother) was and would know Abigail's teacher (Peter) and, therefore, she chose Peter to be in the cult. Lorna just happened to be his girlfriend.

How did Maggie know about Peter's past so that she could make him cry about it? Again, she must have been from the future so that she was able to research Peter.

I think that Klaus was from the future also. He knew what Maggie's tattoo looked like and what it meant. Why else would he rescue her from the streets? He probably had a tattoo also. And maybe Carol also had one. Maggie must have traveled into the future, and then Kraus and Carol followed.

I think that when Lam recognized the song, it was a test. Maggie knew the song from the future, but she also knew that it was from the 90s. Songs are re-made all of the time. It was a test of loyalty, like all of her other tests, like eating worms and poisoned apples and the vomiting scene (which was so unnecessary and disgusting).
Maggie was right -- if she told Lam something that would happen in the future, what would Lam do with that information -- wait a few years to see if it really happened? Either Lam believed in Maggie or he did not. How could Maggie actually prove that she was from the future?

5097386,4,B007L6VQWW,"This movie really hooked me. Brit Marling is a revelation for me. A stunning beauty, she plays an otherworldly cult leader here, Maggie, a woman who claims to hail from 2054 with scary but important news about the future. We meet her thanks to the endeavors of Peter (Christopher Denham) and Lorna (Nicole Vicius, an amazing beauty), who are out to strike it rich by making a documentary about Maggie and her cult. Peter, especially, has some skin in this game, because his mother died after joining a cult.
But as time goes on, Maggie seems to be getting under Peter's skin. ""We wanted to make a documentary about a cult,"" Lorna complains to him. ""And now we're in one.""  Things escalate when Maggie demands that Peter prove his loyalty by kidnapping one of his eight-year-old students.
Scanning the reviews I got confirmation for something I'd suspected: the ending of this movie is the major flaw. It's just too darn abrupt, with no follow up. I'm almost positive it had to do with the budget. This film had a shoestring budget and yet still it looks and feels really good. Such a shame about the ending. But even then, you really should see this! Cults are such great fodder for powerful horror. Think of the original Wicker Man. Or the excellent new movie, The Sacrament.

Those expecting a typical fast-paced science fiction movie with aliens and monsters and lots of scary action, will be very disappointed, especially as each of these films develop very slowly.  These are intimate dramas.  Fortunately Brit Marling is absolutely captivating and we don't mind observing the slow revelation of her characters.

Brit Marling is one of my favorite newer actors, and I really like the two main characters (the couple) as well. After reading some of the other reviews, I am going to re-watch and pay more attention to the sound.

Others have pointed to the plot feeling incomplete or undeveloped, or the ""something is missing"" angle.

I was fortunate enough to catch ""Sound of my voice"" on HBO, and it was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I would put this movie in the same category as ""Memento"", in that it is a surreal mystery and journey of the human condition. Movies like this are not only entertaining, but are also thought provoking and life changing.

""Sound of my voice"" is about a couple that join a cult with a leader who professes to be from the future. The couple joins the cult in an attempt to investigate and document the claims of the leader. What seems like a simple investigation, becomes increasingly confusing and dangerous, as the leader ""Brit Marling"" seems to prove her claims and test the dedication of members. Brit Marling does a spectacular job portraying the beautiful and strange cult leader. This movie had me wanting to see what happens next, and when it ended I was upset, as it left me still wanting to know what happened. ""Memento"" also left me with many questions at the end, but I think that's the beauty of a film like this: It forces you to think about the movie and makes re-watching more enjoyable.",1376784000,3,1316,4.460580912863071

5097444,4,B007L6VQWW,"Information-deficit dogs the steps of ths indie film about a cult. To say it casts shadows over a very decent effort by writer-actress Laura Marling and writer-direrctor Zal Batmanglij,is to say any more clarity would have entailed greater cost and more thorough development. There is the question of cults and what are they,how we approach them,what makes them distinguishable from religions. What do we have to do to give our lives meaning?Cults have got a bad press(eg we have the example of Scientology setting itself up as a mainstream religion for the tax breaks). They are nebulous,they depend upon secrecy and charisma,codes, rituals (showering,handshakes)inexplicable phenomena like time-travel,or coming from the future. Are they masking something sinister?The acting is great,the menace and tension unbearable. Marling is stirring as the beautiful leader of a cult who has to live in this basement,claiming to be from the future. She has to grow her own food and can't venture out. She depends on the blood of her followers. The question of how the documentarian duo investigate a cult they are part of. Dialogue is brilliant in ten sharply written episodes. What is vague is that plot strands remain untied,the ending seems a cop out. Design is low key,simple. The form is crackling. The set upis intriguing,the atmosphere is increased by the unpredictable direction,uncertainty.

What better way into this cult than having 2 documentary film makers, Peter (Christopher Denham) and Lorna(Nicole Vicius) entering to find out what they can,but masking this with the desire to join the cult. Maggie the cult leader makes an entrance trailing an oxygen tank,suggesting vulnerability,fear of infection,delicacy, high-borne purpose. The guru has come to initiate and test her would-be fellow-travellers. Softly spoken,giving hope,feeding off their mutual curiosity. She claims to be from the future(2054),with no proof save a symbol on her leg and a pop song she sings from the past. These leaders depend upon your faith,any questioning scepticism, withholding, is perceived as cowardice,makes them angry. The news she has come to tell them is the future of wars and famine,their need for preparation for it. Their selection for it. Peter thinks her exposure would prevent all these people killing themselves. He'll make tapes of cult gatherings.""To see her is to believe her,but that's how all these cons work"".His glasses have inbuilt video,he swallows a receiver. Our argument about this cult are influenced by Peter and Lorna's waverings,fluctuations,fallings-out,disagreements. Peter is against at first then he's for. Lorna accepts it at first but then aids and abets the DoJ in reporting it and trying to bring it down. Peter is asked to abduct a child to meet Maggie,he being a teacher of the child.

Each person who sees the film receives it differently,sees something else with no one meaning. Tying up loose ends would do away with its multi-dimensional scope. We're dealing with group formation of like-minded people,one or two of whom enter sceptically(as our duo of detective journalists to make their documentary to expose the cult and blow its' cover) then find themselves in over their heads. To stay in the group requires `trust' and `faith' with reason in suspension. We tell ourselves this is a scam,what is this ,a reverse mother-daughter situation?How far are people tested to ensure their selection?In this film,ostensibly about going on a journey into the future, journey more important than arrival. What do we have to do to give our livesmeaning? If she is not from the future(likely) has she been indoctrinated as a charismatic leader of a survivalist cult?Is the DoJ lady not what she seems? Does she enlist Lorna's support to encourage Peter to bring Abigail to Maggie?Does Maggie after being seized by the Police get to meet Abigail outside?Are Abigail and Maggie sisters who suffered similar abuse and grooming,learning the handshake in common?

Why are children abducted for this cult(we never find out)?Maggie remembers waking up submerged in a bath(after a drug experience/escaping grooming by a cult?) and is picked up by Klaus, returned,fed and revived. Abigail is being injected between her toes by her father who appears to be indoctrinating her using a labtop. She often goes to sleep in public and builds strange lego buildings. Peter's dislike of cults springs from his mother being in a cult and her dying when he was 13 from cancer. The future is a maguffin,Maggie's in hiding for felony and arson. The idea she's from the future is lame as there is not enough backing for this idea in terms of evidence, production costs. Has she been groomed(like Abigail,her sister,daughter,mother???) to lead this new militia movement in the coming civil war?Lorna has been shown how to shoot a gun in the woods by one of the cult members. What the film required was a rewrite by David Mamet the master of the art of scam and con scenarios. The snap of action would have adrenalised it. As it is a series of individually brilliant scenes,loose beads without a connecting thread. Well worth seeing but it could have been so much better with not much more effort. Batmangklij has made a superb debut. Marling has created a complex female character, but she needs to get it housed in a good story.",1374451200,3,5330,5.15242494226328
5097445,4,B007L6VQWW,"I'm the fat guy with glasses & beard that goes in for the ""Group Hug"".. near the end of the movie.

Why am I in this film (not really but) It's because I strongly believe somebody within the production of ""Sound of My Voice"" based many of the characters you saw on real people.  Please keep in mind that the two wannabe journalist/documentation leads and the crazy cult lady leader wasn't based on anybody I know.

There is what I like to call a ""Meditation Retreat"" I visit on and off for nearly 15 years.  I will NOT say which meditation place I'm talking about.  It is a really special place and (believe it or not) can be magical for many people who visit there.

Deep breath - here we go..

I have read nearly all the ""Cult"" books available.  And sure any blockhead can look at the funny people holding hands and yell ""Cult!"" or what not.  The word ""Cult"" is used way to often to my sensibilities.

What this film does is demonstrate some of the scary realities that still exist out there.  Not enough time was given to the woman who entered the hotel room.. then began wiping it down like a ""CSI"" police tech.

The ""Handshake"" is a literal demonstration of how real ""Cults"" make their followers feel special, belong, etc..

I nearly fell off my couch when I saw.. what I would call a real ""New Age"" ""Twit!"" It was the actor at the front of the line doing the secret hand shake.. Skinny, hairy face, glasses guy.  The ""REAL"" guy the film makers were copying exists.  If he had his way.. he would start his own cult because he is unfit for any other way of earning a living. REMEMBER this is only my opinion, and the filmmakers might have seen these characters/people elsewhere or actually made them up on their own.  (which would be pretty interesting actually)

I will add a bit more to my review as soon as I can.  (Sorry.. I'm really tired)

Below is the reason they didn't get a five star rating out of me. :(

The ""End"" of this film was really dumb.  I mean.. I was all happy that the filmmakers took the time to get nearly every part of modern ""Cult"" BS in their film.  Then to see it fizzle away into nothing at the end?  Even Marshall Applewhite went out with his shoes on!

For those of you curious about ""Cults""?  This movie ""Sound of my Voice"" scores relatively high on my list.  Right up there with Saul Rubinek in ""Ticket to Heaven"" 1981. ""Ticket to Heaven"" was a very well made movie on cults that is ""Old School"" compared to today. Also many young faces that went on to big careers. Worth watching if you get a chance.

Thanks for reading and I will add more when I get a chance.

5097460,4,B007L6VQWW,"I was a really big fan of `Another Earth'.  I thought it was intriguing and captivating and had so much individuality.  It breathed its own air and felt fresh and exciting.  With that feeling looming over, and decided that `Sound of My Voice' was going to be a similar film and sunk my teeth in.  Conceptually, I really has a lot to offer, but I can't help but think that it didn't develop its themes and its premise in a way that wholly works.  It is satisfying up to a certain extent, but the ending (while lavishing in the same ambiguousness that made `Another Earth' so provoking) just doesn't drive home the film's point or narrative in a way that compels me to think much about this after the fact.

It was a letdown of sorts; that ending.

`Sound of My Voice' follows a couple, Peter and Lorna, who have fully immersed themselves in a secret cult in order to expose it as a hoax, as a con.  The leader of the cult, a young woman named Maggie, claims to be from the future (the year 2054) and claims that she has been sent to help save the people she loves.  Her claims are vague and her purpose is even more vague, something that I took issue with.  She kept speaking of a place they were leaving for but never explained in depth or even minor detail what or where that place was.  The story takes an interesting turn when it broaches on Peter's home life.  A substitute teacher, Maggie preys on this aspect of Peter and asks him to get a girl from his class for her.  This is where the film starts to pick up and some of Maggie's intentions are made clear...

Or are they?

That's what I don't get.  They flirt with letting you in and then completely pull you back.  I think I understand (it makes perfect sense in a way) and then again, I'm left somewhat unaffected by the outcome because it isn't fully developed.

That said, the atmospheric tones are exceptional.  The use of sound is remarkable here, really pulling you in to every scene, and Brit Marling is a truly talented actress who manages to make Maggie feel compelling and truthful while constantly plucking at the fraying edges of her identity.  She always seems slightly off, like she's lying, but she's a really, really good liar.",1365552000,4,2203,4.405940594059406

A pair of documentarians (Christopher Denham and Nicole Vicius) infiltrate the cult to get their story.  Both obviously skeptical at first, one then the other begin to question their own notions of Maggie's premise of time-travel and her thoughts of what is to come.  Things get real interesting when Maggie wants to meet a 7 year old girl who she says is her mother.  Yikes!

Maggie's calm demeanor leaves you scratching your head for a while.  But she can also be demanding of her followers, subjecting them to numerous ""life lessons.""

5097478,2,B007L6VQWW,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  Brit Marling, star and co-writer of 'Sound of MY Voice' was also responsible for 'Another Earth', a 2012 Spirit Award nominee for Best First Feature. Both films are similar in that they have an ambiguous ending which has sparked vast debate on the internet message boards. The ending of 'Sound of my Voice' is even more integral to the plot than 'Another Earth', since viewers are led to expect a big 'payoff'.

  That payoff involves whether the film's antagonist, Maggie, a cult leader, who claims to be from the year 2054, actually is a time traveler from the future. Before dissecting the ending, it's important to realize that the film is also about the power of cult psychology. The film's protagonist, Peter, along with his girlfriend, Lorna, are documentary filmmakers who decide to risk all by infiltrating the group. I had a hard time with the idea that Peter, knowing how dangerous the cult is, still is intent on going ahead with his project. You have to suspend your disbelief over Peter's stubbornness, since the average person (working in a vacuum as Peter and Lorna do) would probably not take such a risk.

  The film's main conceit during the 'Second Act' of the narrative is that even the most steadfast skeptics such as Peter, can be seduced by a talented manipulator. He and Lorna are subjected to a series of 'loyalty tests' including eating worms and poisoned apples, culminating in Maggie's ability to break Peter down emotionally during one of the sessions (she alludes to one of Peter's upsetting childhood memories). While Peter tells Lorna it was all just an act, later Peter agrees to assist in the abduction of Abigail, the young girl Maggie claims is her mother. Peter argues that he just wants to finish the job he started since so many people never do that. The scenarists of 'Sound of My Voice' argue whatever Peter's ultimate motive is, in the end he's been manipulated into committing an egregious act (the abduction of a child).

  While hardly any of the mechanics of cult indoctrination can be termed 'suspenseful', Ms. Marling and her co-writer keep dropping hints that there's something a lot bigger afoot. The big 'twist' at the end has Abigail giving Maggie the secret handshake, leading to all kinds of speculation. Interpretations of the ending have been broken down into multiple camps.

  One camp basically holds that Maggie is indeed Abigail's daughter and a time traveler. Adherents of this point of view point to the fact that when Abigail asks Maggie how she knew the secret handshake, Maggie replies, ""you taught it to me."" In this scenario, Abigail has been trained to be a terrorist and later Maggie receives the same indoctrination. Maggie's aim is to save her 'mother' as well as herself from those people in the future who have abused them. Carol, the self-declared 'Department of Justice' investigator, is actually a bounty hunter from the future, who is assigned to thwart Maggie's plans, as she will prevent both Abigail and Maggie from turning away from the cult in the present and the future. Camp #1 points to the fact that if these were real Department of Justice investigators, Peter would have also had to have been detained on charges of complicity in the kidnapping.

  Another camp holds that Carol is a cult follower who pretends to be a Department of Justice Investigator. The cult cons Lorna into believing that Maggie has been arrested but in reality she has been simply 'taken away' by cult followers. With this belief, Lorna is no longer a threat. The 'secret handshake' has been arranged by the man who has been indoctrinating Abigail and Maggie is in on it. Peter, the skeptic, suddenly becomes a 'true believer' in the cult, as he's been conned into the whole time travel scenario.

  And another camp holds time travel is impossible and it's Klaus who's the true Svengali here. He found the drug-addicted Maggie on the street and brainwashed her into believing that Abigail is her mother. Nonetheless, Abigail may indeed be Maggie's daughter and old lost memories may be breaking into her consciousness. Something inside her is telling her to save Abigail and when Peter finally brings Abigail to her and asks how she knew the secret handshake, Maggie suddenly recalls her daughter taught it to her when she was much smaller (the man who appears to be her 'father' is a cult follower who has been brainwashing little Abigail since her earliest memories, and taught her the secret handshake). Carol is actually affiliated with the DOJ and interrupts the confused Maggie and arrests her, as she is aware that she has a criminal history. Nonetheless, Maggie may not be held criminally liable as later on it may come out that she has been manipulated by Klaus.

  There seem to be a myriad of explanations to explain the ending of this film. Some people believe that such ambiguity is a mark of a great film--the fact that so many people can come up with so many different explanations as to what this film is about, is held up by some, as a sign of great creativity. On the other hand, others (including myself), feel that this kind of writing is a cop-out. Do you really have a definitive point of view you're trying to put across? Or are you leaving things intentionally ambiguous because you really haven't thought through precisely what you're trying to say?

  I suppose a film such as this which engenders so much discussion on the internet deserves an extra star. But ultimately, the film never answers fundamental questions about its antagonist which should be answered, leading one to conclude that the film's scenarists do not have a firm grasp on their material.",1359763200,5,5694,4.837281153450052

Putting the old Hollywood cliches to rest, and proving that today's younger generation of filmmakers still have hope.  As if a big ""screw you!"" to the typical, tired cookie-cutter films, ""Sound Of My Voice"" delves into deep sci-fi territory, yet does so without a single visual effects shot in the entire movie.  It delves deep into psychological disturbances without leaving us depressed or confused.

This is a sci-fi/drama/mystery/thriller, keeping you guessing and on the edge of your seat, all accomplished with no VFX, no music, no action or violence.

The plotline is pretty cool though its about investigative journalists getting involved ina  cult for report purposes but eventually find themselves in over their heads. It's not scary or a thriller or action packed. It's just a somewhat unnerving note on cults.

Marling, who co-wrote the screenplay, does a superb job of portraying the leader of the cult, Maggie, who claims to have come from the future. Whether she is actually a time traveler or some kind of fanatical zealot becomes the central question of the film; one which Marling never explicitly answers, preferring to let the audience draw their own conclusions. This is hardly a slick production, but I prefer this type of film to much of the fare being produced by the big studios today.

It is definitely a ""mystery"" movie, but not one that ever satisfies your curiosity. It will keep your curiosity building and building but never satisfy it and then simply end.

The plot was building up to something rather mysterious, if you watch the trailer or read the description the big question is whether or not this cult leader is what she says she is. They give you evidence to support both sides, that she is and she is not. But the evidence is completely spotty, not well thought out, and ultimately confusing. SO it the end it leaves you with a cliffhanger, and two choices that DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

Not NEARLY enough information is given for you to even pretend like you know what the answer to the question is. I have no problem with open-ended movies, until now I rather liked them, but like I said before it leaves you with two choices and neither of them make any sense.

It had great acting, great writing, and such an amazing plot up until the end. Rather sad, they tried a little two hard to make it a cliffhanger and cut off just a little too much.",1357171200,3,1237,4.3652173913043475

It's about a film documentary who is trying to make a story about a cult leader. He and his fiance get into the inner circle, and they met the leader Maggie who claims to be from the future.

This movie is completely ambiguous. This has to be the most ambiguous movie I've seen in a very long time. The movie never comes out and states/proves that Maggie is from the future but it never states/proves it's all a con either. They imply she's a con with the police but, at the same time, the parts where the police told what Maggie had done weren't in the movie.

During the first half of SOMV, I thought to myself that the film was a good psychological drama, but not as engrossing as Another Earth. Then the tempo picked up with the introduction of the Carol Briggs character, which had me pondering whether she is who she claims to be or perhaps a time traveler (with ulterior motives) as well. I won't give away the ending, yet I will share that as the film credits were rolling, I sat there with a big grin on my face.

Brit Marling's productions tend to leave viewers in awe, leaving one to reflect on the films for a very long time. The acting, directing, screenplay, and casting on Sound of My Voice were all stellar. I hope we won't have to wait too long for the release of Brit's next film.

5097554,3,B007L6VQWW,"I thought that this would be a better movie based on Britt Marling's other movie, ""Another Earth"".  Ultimately, however, this movie builds up to an ending that simply baffles and takes ""the easy way out"" - which - I suppose - was the point (but that's my guess).

The movie succeeds in creating suspense as it takes viewers into the mysteries and secrets of one particular cult.  At the center of the cult is Marling's character - who is either a visitor from the future or a fraud depending on your perspective.

Tension builds as two documentary film makers immerse themselves deeper and deeper into the cult which successfully creates tension as their ""exposure"" seems to become imminent.  Further conflict comes from the infiltrating documentary film makers who seem to differ in their perception of the main character's plausibility.

The introduction of a Federal agency - also investigating the cult - doesn't clarify the story, either.  The agency's intervention and action - left me scratching my head a bit.  Like the movie, I'll purposely leave it vague when I ask:  Why put a child at risk (in the context of the film's storyline)?  Why the one arrest, but not others?

From my perspective, the movie was mildly entertaining, and ""so-so"", overall.  If you're a fan of the TV series ""X Files"", then you have a better chance of finding this film to be entertaining.  If you prefer films that ""tidy up"" all the loose ends, then you're not going to like this one.

Personally, I found Marling's ""Another Earth"" to be far superior to this film.  If you haven't seen ""Another Earth"" already, you should definitely check it out.

I tip my hat to Ms. Marling for providing fresh, independent ideas to a film industry severely lacking in fresh, independent material.  Kudos to her for that, at least.",1351468800,2,1803,4.8019480519480515

As other reviewers have noted, this film (from 2012) feels like the lead up to ""The OA"" (2016), which develops similar themes much more fully and provocatively.  In its own right though, what I liked about this movie is that it takes it's time, and is creatively fresh and intriguing,which I'm learning is Brit Marling's trademark style.  To really get a sense of her brilliance, first check out ""Another Earth"" (written by Marling and Mike Cahill, directed by Cahill), and ""The East,"" and ""The OA,"" written by Marling and Zal Batmanglij and directed by Batmanglij, then come back to this as an interesting little vignette from that same thoughtful and gifted creative team.",1485648000,7,987,4.822485207100592
