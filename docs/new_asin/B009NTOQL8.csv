8543245,1,B009NTOQL8,"This film is total rubbish. It is made according to modern Hollywood, or rather Chinese and Korean standards, where each side has some noble warriors who dress, speak and act like medieval Rambos. The story is 90% inaccurate as far as history is concerned. It begins with the decision made by the young Sultan Mehmet to conquer Constantinople because there was a prophecy from the time of the Great Prophet that sometimes in the future a great Muslim warrior will take this city. The question that the film avoids to answer is WHAT right had the Ottomans to conquer Constantinople, a marellous Christian city which was NOT founded by them! In fact, the Ottomans NEVER founded any great city. The just conquered the cities founded by the Greeks and the Romans. Their civilization was almost nil. The only thing they knew was to kill, rape and pillage. The most scandalous propaganda piece in the film is the assurance given by Sultan Mehmet to the people of Constantinople, at the same day of the fall of the city in 1453, that their lives, properties and faith will be respected! A great LIE! There was  horrible slaughter that day as Sultan Mehmet unleashed his blood-thirsty horde on the helpless civilians of the city to kill and plunder as they wished.",1528243200,,1256,4.761467889908257
8543246,4,B009NTOQL8,This Turkish produced movie documents the well planned attack on Constantinople in 1453.  This lavish production is just as good as those that come out of other countries and equal to a Hollywood Oscar winning film.  The cinematography and acting are top notch.  A good starter movie to understand the Islamic point of view regarding the West in the 15th Century.  The historical accuracy of  certain events are questionable (thus just 4 stars) but this is a case where the victor has written the history and this needs to be understood before watching the movie.,1470960000,3,563,4.88421052631579

8543250,4,B009NTOQL8,"Looking through other reviews of this film, I see that FETIH 1453 has been regularly criticized for its so-called 'inaccurate' representation of medieval history.  In truth, questions of 'inaccuracy' or 'accuracy' are difficult to measure; our knowledge of the life and times of the late fifteenth century is sketchy, to say the least.  FETIH 1453 works as a contemporary piece, using history to promote the idea of Turkish patriotism at a time when the integrity of nation-states is perpetually threatened by globalization, as well as huge behemoths like the European Union.  On these terms, the film is actually pretty good: its moral scheme is easy to identify. All Christians are inevitably bad, while the Ottomans, on the other hand, need a strong, committed yet fair leader to ensure their success both on the battlefield and off.  The fight scenes are well handled, combining CGI effects with plenty of vivid color and incident.  Sometimes the structure is a little predictable, with too many sequences showing representatives of both sides (Christians and Ottomans) deciding how to plan their next campaigns; but this is offset by a sensitive handling of the domestic scenes, in which the two major central characters (Devrim Evin, Ibrahim Celikkol) are shown having to make unenviable choices between their families and their countries.  FETIH 1453 is the Republic of Turkey's most expensive film in terms of budget, and its most successful at the box-office. It's not hard to see why.",1371686400,15,1494,5.178423236514523
8543251,4,B009NTOQL8,"While I started to watch this movie, I felt firstly stunned as although I have read much on the fall of Constantinople, but nothing from the Turkish side.  I thought this part was interesting.

However as the movie continued I began to feel very disturbed not because historical facts were ignored to make a better story which is something almost always done in movies but it became clear that these changes were made to glorify a particular ugly form of Islam that the Turkish government now seems to be promoting.

The history itself is a Greek/Roman army defending Constantinople was relatively small; it totaled about 7,000 men, of which many were foreigners. The city itself was only a fraction of its former glory.  Attacking them was an army of Turks of 80,000 men. Many possibly even most of these men were Christians. The army that attacked  Constantinople was as much a Christian as a Muslim army.

The cannons that battered the walls of Constantinople were built by a Hungarian who offered his services firstly to the Greek emperor of Constantinople, when he discovered that the Greek Emperor could not afford him, he went to the Turkish Sultan. There was not hatred there as suggested by the movie just business.

The tunnels that the movie were built by the Germans. Actually they were all discovered by the Greeks and  destroyed before they did any significant damage. I was very disturbed when the movie showed a medieval Islamic suicide bomber kill himself to take out the wall. This never happened. Why glorify suicide bombers?

When the city was taken, the film is incorrect as the city was pillaged quite brutally for a few days.

There was no telescope in those days but there was probably little the director could do as some of the scenes required one.

Overall I thought some of the scenes very good such as when Halil Pasha goes to the Sultan thinking that the Sultan will execute him. In fact the Sultan did execute him but that was shortly after the fall of the city.

The acting itself overall better than average. Not surprising as many are fine actors. Many of the characters were interesting.

The filming itself was good. I liked very much, much of the special effects.  Clearly it was not up to the standard of many American movies but it was good.

Would I see it again? Well I did because I thought it was worth seeing?",1365033600,17,2353,4.677184466019417

8543253,5,B009NTOQL8,I recommend the movie.  The story is based on the events surrounding Constantinople (later Istanbul)'s conquest by the Ottoman Turks during the reign of Sultan Mehmed II.,1361059200,11,170,5.296296296296297
