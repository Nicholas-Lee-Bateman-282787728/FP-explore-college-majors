8454404,5,B0052T6ZQW,It's been awhile sense I've seen DBZ and glad I waited to buy it until DBZ Kai. DBZ Kai is amazing and with no fill's wow what a difference! I remember years ago saying why are the episodes drawn out so much. I now know it was the Manga being written and needed time so fillers come to be. Anyway this is a most have for any DBZ fan and you can be get the whole Kai series for just a little over a 100 bucks (much cheaper then the one before). So do yourself a favor and buy it!-),1342396800,,480,3.81
