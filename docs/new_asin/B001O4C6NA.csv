Was surprised to learned that this had been made into a series...with a new cast of actors...with my interest peeked...I purchased the set...what a pleasant surprise...all episodes interesting and enteraining....My favorite episodes were with Murdoch and Arthur Conan Doyle..playing off on each other...Also, enjoy the sparks from Murdoch and the good doctor...(not many woman doctors back then or in the field.)
Have read there is a season 2..Will be waiting impatiently for that season to be release....since this program in not found on USA channels..",1246233600,19,669,5.633663366336633
3727316,5,B001O4C6NA,"Based in 1890s Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the 13 episodes of the critically-acclaimed first season of this Victorian-era mystery series - with bonus features - clocks in at nearly 600 minutes.

The episodes chronicle the exploits of inventive Detective William Murdoch (portrayed by Yannick Bisson) and his unique vision to think outside the box while solving crime in the nick of time. To give special flavor to the era, historical figures like Prince Alfred and Arthur Conan Doyle make appearances, but the costumes and settings bolster the sweet story lines and solid acting.

The bonus features are the typical kind - episode commentary, interviews, photo gallery - though the angle provided by production designer Sandra Kybartas is very interesting. Do not be surprised if the hours fly by as the sleuthing heats up as Murdoch and his colleagues play their old school version of ""beat the clock.""",1245369600,8,901,5.164383561643835
3727317,5,B001O4C6NA,"A Great Canadian show produced by City TV about Police investigations in Toronto in the 1800's. Yannick Bisson stars in this solid series which was authentically filmed in  ""The Big Smoke"" in areas that were converted to appear 19th century i.e. covering paved road with dirt. Sure hope this series sees a 3rd season. pricey but still worth it.",1244678400,2,344,4.830508474576271
3727318,4,B001O4C6NA,"I'm going to call ""Murdoch Mysteries Season One"" a British mystery, although it's set in Canada and uses Canadian actors, because it appears to have been jointly produced by ITV Global Entertainment, and Granada International, two companies surely at least artistically headquartered in Great Britain.  The stylish, contemporary television series, a costumed historical police procedural, is set in the Toronto of the 1890's, and features ""cutting edge Victorian science.""  The boxed set at hand consists of four DVD's comprising 13 episodes, approximately 598 minutes, of the series that debuted in Canada in January, 2008.  And, all praises to Acorn Media, subtitles, in addition to the usual extra features, interviews and such.  It is now available to U.S. audiences for the first time.

""Murdoch"" is based on characters from the detective novels of Maureen Jennings: the first published, in 1997,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Except-the-Dying/dp/077104397X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Except the Dying</a>; to be followed by six more in the series.  Jennings is creative consultant on the TV series that aims to give us a look at the dawn of forensic sleuthing.  It was nominated for 14 Geminis in 2008, including Best Dramatic Series, Best Achievement in Casting, and Best Writing.

It centers on Detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sue-Thomas-F-B-Eye-2002-TVseries/dp/B001992O0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye (2002 TVseries)</a>), who adopts modern forensic techniques such as ""finger marks,"" and blood spatter analyses, and an early lie detector.  His skeptical, old-school boss Inspector Brackenreid (Thomas Craig,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-the-Heart-Is/dp/B00004WI5F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where the Heart Is</a>); gung-ho protg Constable George Crabtree (Jonny Harris, ""Hatching, Matching & Dispatching""); and comely pathologist Dr. Julia Ogden (Helene Joy, ""Durham County"") aid and abet his efforts.  Most of the plots are ingenious, quick-moving, and reasonably original/complex for their length; some do generate emotional power. Some ingenuity has also been invested in bringing a few celebrities of the age to Toronto: famed British mystery author Arthur Conan Doyle; Nikola Tesla, who helped invent electricity and a bunch of other modern gizmos, too; and Price Alfred, son of England's awesome Queen Victoria.  The series is nicely filmed, and its makers haven't stinted on its budget, plenty of people and vehicles in the street and the station.

The episodes are: (1) Power; (2) The Glass Ceiling; (3) The Knockdown; (4) Elementary, My Dear Murdoch; (5) Till Death Do Us Part; (6) Let Loose the Dogs; (7) Body Double; (8) Still Waters; (9) Belly Speaker; (10) Child's Play; (11) Bad Medicine; (12) The Rebel and The Prince;(13) The Annoying Red Planet.

Unfortunately, aside from Craig as Inspector Brackenreid, the actors don't look or sound Victorian, and Bisson, who plays the title character, is handsome enough, but rather wooden.  There are also some anomalies.  In one episode, we see, in an upper crust home, a print of a world-famous Picasso over the fireplace, in the spot where the household's best picture is generally hung.  Picasso, however, was born in 1881 and had painted neither this famed ""rose period"" portrait, nor anything else, by the 1890's.  Nor did the bourgeoisie even start buying his work before the late 1920's.  Furthermore, surely in the 1890's, and even now, a house-proud woman of any means does not hang a reproduction in the living room, let alone over the fireplace.

Never mind: the Toronto ""Globe and Mail"" has called this series ""smart, fast-paced fun."" That it is.",1244073600,12,3816,5.930656934306569
3727319,5,B001O4C6NA,"Three television adaptions of Maureen Jennings' Victorian William Murdoch novels were so successful, the broadcaster (CITY television in Canada, UKTV in Britain and Granada International) commissioned a full fledged 13 episode series. 14 Gemini award nominations for season one led to the series being renewed for season two.
This collection of episodes from season one has some stellar performances. Thomas Craig as Inspector Brackenreid, Helene Joy (Gemini award winning actress) as Dr Ogden, Jonny Harris as Constable Crabtree, and Yannick Bisson as the handsome and dapper Detective Murdoch, will provide hours of great entertainment and suspense.
Standout episodes in season one include an adaptation of the novel Let Loose the Dogs, Elementary My Dear Murdoch (which features Arthur Conan Doyle), The Glass Ceiling, The Annoying Red Planet, and the touching Child's Play. Highly recommended.",1230249600,117,897,5.701492537313433

3727368,1,B001O4C6NA,"This show suffers from some major flaws.

1) bad filming. Some of the scenes are filmed on a roller but the majority of up close conversations are filmed freehand and are thus quite shakey; it makes me feel like I am on the fishing boat again - a quite sickening feeling.

2) the costumes and scenes are not convincing. To anyone relatively familiar with the late 19th century or to anyone who has viewed any of the Sherlock Holmes series, the costumes pale in comparison. I don't feel enraptured in the 19th century, I feel like I am watching 20th century folks playing dress up and unfortunately I am, but I never want to know it, thats why I watch these shows.

3) most importantly and like other critical reviewers have mentioned, the series haa flat and boring dialogue and minimal character development. I never feel lost in the show and the characters, like any good series succeeds at doing, and at which this one fails.",1487808000,2,928,4.578313253012048

I love the turn of the century setting, our brilliant Catholic detective (in a very Protestant Toronto), the developing forensics (like ""finger marks""), and how Murdoch keeps his strong faith while becoming empathetic to different views. I also love our strong, beautiful and equally brilliant female pathologist, Dr. Ogden. There's humor mixed in - and a great cast of supporting characters; and it's wonderful to see some of my ""heroes"" of the age as well (Arthur Conan Doyle and Nicola Tesla so far)!

Also don't mind the ""PC"" aspect. Yes it's a cleaned up version of the time, a fantasy of course. However it's interesting to see the forensic innovations being brought to life. I like the pacing.

Murder, romance, science and much tongue in check dialogue.  When I watched the first season a couple of years ago, I was hooked.  I watched three seasons in a marathon run.

I have since told everyone I know who searches for something GOOD to watch, turn on this series. And, except for season 9, I have joyfully bought every season. It just doesn't get any better than this, and no wonder it wins awards every year in Canada .
While Bisson drives this show, it is a wonderful ensemble cast. I love Crabtree, I love Brachenreid, and, I have yelled at the TV with the ups and down of Murdoch's love life.  I think, if one can pick a favorite episode, no, I'm not going to. You'll have to decide on your own!
Just one aside, even though season one is wonderful, is truly takes hold by season two, and is just as fresh as ever now. A huge thank you to the cast of this show for the pure joy it has given me, and my family.",1468022400,4,884,4.0227272727272725

3727710,4,B001O4C6NA,"If you enjoy Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries but like your historical procedurals a little lighter, this is a great series, a bit reminiscent of The Wild, Wild West in regard to invention and scientific discovery. It's also lighter in tone than the three movies and does not highlight the poverty and sex trade. The lead, acted with boyish charm, at times reminds me of Mulder from the X-Files, trying to get his professional colleagues to accept his futuristic visions. One interesting focus is Murdoch's Catholicism which sometimes  causes him some confusion when dealing with issues such as homosexuality and spiritualism. I would have given the first series five stars except I feel the relationships between the characters haven't fully formed, especially that between Murdoch and the female medical examiner. There is potential for both romance and conflict but neither is well explored. However, his superior Breckenridge and the two constables are a vast improvement over their movie counterparts. I have mixed feelings about the parade of historical figures, but I am enjoying learning a bit about Toronto's history. Do listen to the commentary on the first episode and the cast interviews which were quite insightful.",1467417600,,1224,5.276923076923077

I can't keep staying up late enough to see it.  I was frustrated by missing it so often.  I decided to buy the first season.  I'm glad I did.  We've really enjoyed it.  Even my husband stops being busy to watch it with me.

The series has great characters, Great plots and a bit of  SyFy element.  It speaks for it's self, only really great shows run for nine years and still going.  Hopefully for many more years.  I want to sell my season 1 and get 1-4.

The first couple of episodes held a few awkward moments, but nothing we couldn't talk through or explain with them. We don't shelter them from tough issues like racism, abuse, or even homosexuality.

3727828,5,B001O4C6NA,best show on T.V,1460246400,,16,3.25
3727829,4,B001O4C6NA,"Enjoyable show, but it's not to everyone's tastes. Some people feel the male lead wears eye makeup (he doesn't), and that women are given parts that are much too important for the time period (they are), and that it's anti-Catholic (I can't find it to be, and I was baptized a Catholic, but then again I'm a Quaker now, so perhaps I am no judge). That it takes artistic license with history (it does).

And some people just love it anyway, in spite of these issues...I am one of these.

I do have to confess, when I first watched Murdoch Mysteries (styled as ""The Artful Detective"" on Ovation TV), I was puzzled and a bit let down. It was a Victorian mystery series, but with so much modern revisionism laid on, it was at first more decorative-seeming to me than historically accurate. (I am actually rather literate in that era and its events.) Still...although somewhat annoyed...I found myself drawn to watch it a few more times, and then followed the episodes for a while. All this in spite of myself, because of the excellent, quiet, reflective Yannick Bisson and the strong and resolute Helene Joy. I was quite frankly caught up. The George Crabtree character soon became a favorite as well. I enjoyed the regular cast's chemistry with one other, and their determination to keep learning how to do their jobs better, as the opportunities arose.

Now, the problem with most period movies and dramas for me is that they are generally very sexist, and have little for me to enjoy in them. For example, I can't stand so-called Golden Age Hollywood movies or those old ""classic"" sitcoms from the 50s, 60s, 70s; I know the rest of the world loves them, but I don't. And as for contemporary depictions of, say, the 1950s/60s, such as shown in Mad Men, I have no interest in watching that either, because I LIVED through that era, and know what a dissatisfying time that was for women. I don't want to go back there. I was only a little girl back then, but I didn't want to end up like any of those women, enslaved to that time's sensibility. Let others enjoy the era of gartered hose and girdles, everybody smoking all the time, casual constant racist remarks, and women with severely starched hair they had to put up in rollers every night, and try to sleep on. Getting pinched and smacked on the butt when they walked through the office by the guys 'cause it was OK back then, and women didn't dare make a big scene about it. And of course women not being taken seriously about...much of anything. Well...others who are voluntarily time-traveling, and have that entertainment luxury (because they did NOT live through it), can watch that stuff. I'm just glad I escaped from that time prison.

Now, back to Murdoch. I know that Victorians did not behave as the lead characters in Murdoch behave, but if they were entirely accurate in their representations to the period, I would have little interest in watching yet another show about men and men's adventures, with women shoved in the background or on the side, knitting or fainting or disapproving of things all the time. I had enough of lousy sexist drama when I was a little girl in the sixties, and I longed for female heroes...hungered for them. I imagine women of today do as well. Which is why Murdoch Mysteries succeeds, in spite of often seeming like a big valentine to women and the way women wished that world could have been. In other words, attractive to our modern, post-feminist sensibilities, although...sadly...not historically accurate.

Men can have their fantasies, we can have ours. Let them have their sports and their fantasy women to feed their inner lives; we have Murdoch and the Hunger Games and anything else we can find that feeds OUR inner lives. I'm not really kidding about this. It's a harmless enough thing.

Enjoy the show if you can. I sure do.",1459814400,,3831,4.668148148148148

Strangely enough, I haven't seen anything like this before.  It's a somewhat puzzling, engaging, humorous, thought provoking, insightfully informative look into late 1800's forensics / crime solving (as it might have been) in its early days.  The plot always allows for the viewer to enjoy a bit of mystery solving, if that is your pleasure.  Or, just enjoy... The production values are exquisite, the plots are fast-paced, and the character development is satisfyingly relatable.  I like these characters.  There is always the hint of an honorable behavioral code woven within the often less than honorable situations.  Again, well done.",1452816000,9,778,5.168

3727843,3,B001O4C6NA,"Enjoyable despite being somewhat bland and silly. During a recent long renovation project I binge-watched this series (or rather, watched sporadically while listening) and found it to be like putting on an old Judy Garland musical while doing housework--you don't have to pay close to attention to follow the story, and it's entertaining enough. The lead actors are pleasant to look at, and a few actors (particularly Jonny Harris as Crabtree) do a great job. It takes Yannick Bisson up to Season 3 to find his feet; in the first two seasons his ""self-control"" comes off as blandness, but he gains a bit of fire after that, evidenced by the fact that I stopped staring at his otherworldly eyelashes whenever I looked at the screen. Much of the social commentary on inventions, racism, abortion, etc. borders on ridiculous, and many of the bit-part actors aren't able to handle the fancy 1890s dialogue (they come off like high-schoolers trying to act Shakespeare). Having said all this, I shall never be able to look at certain parts of my house without thinking about (spoiler alert!) Helene Joy and Bisson rolling around together during their picnic and her asking, in delicate ladylike 1890s fashion, if he happens to have a condom.",1452470400,,1235,4.9423076923076925

He solves mysteries with the help of the beautiful female coroner.  He uses new-fangled things like ""finger marks"" and impresses everyone with his scientific approach to case-solving. Many light hearted moments.  I gave this to everyone on my Christmas list this year and they all loved the series.",1431043200,5,440,5.242857142857143

Granted they don't follow Maureen Jenning's books however they are still enjoyable. I would give five stars for the show despite some of the politically correctness in the situations and dialogue that doesn't fit in with the era in which the show is set. I am rating this one star because Amazon had this free for Prime members and now we have to pay for the show. We already pay for Prime membership so we can have these shows. I think it is wrong of Amazon to advertise that Prime membership includes free movies and shows without telling us that this can change at any time.

3727921,5,B001O4C6NA,"Great fun! Full of 1890s color and character. My only criticism is that they inject modern ideas into the period in the mouth of a sympathetic, ""ahead-of-the-times"" character, which I call chrono-chauvinism: our own time is so superior to the past that presenting our ancestors' views ""straight"" would be offensive. However! They do at least let the central character be an intelligent man of the 1890s, deeply interested in the new technological advances though rooted in the traditional values of the time. His reactions to challenges to his faith give the series particular interest. Beautiful cinematography, gorgeous settings. I look forward to watching the rest of the series.",1409270400,,682,5.324074074074074

Only one thing puzzles me ... why in the devil is it called ""Artful Detective"" on the Ovation Channel in the U.S.?  Murdoch Mysteries describes the show to a ""T"" ... Artful Detective doesn't make the show sound appealing in the least.  It's best to start with season one and work through the series season-by-season, as relationships develop and characters appear, disappear then reappear again and again.  Watching the series out of order may cause a bit of confusion.  Yannick Bisson, Helene Joy, Thomas Craig and Jonny Harris are all perfect for their roles ... especially Canada's most beautiful and talented actress, Helene Joy.",1408406400,4,789,4.850746268656716

We found this show because of a ""Sherlock"" auto search.  99.9 shows butcher Sherlock Holmes when attempted, but we had the time so after much hemming and hawing we gave this show a chance.  We were delighted.  We loved the details and characters (including their Holmes) and the plot.  It was such a satisfying watch.  We were sure we would hate the rest of the shows, so we intrepidly watched then next few.  What a delight!  We immediately started an Amazon Prime marathon of the show and we still love it.  Some of the shows are well twisted ""Who done its"" but others are incredible well crafted ""How done its"" and some are character studies or time pieces.  The show and its characters are multi-layer and very interesting.  I love the Murdoch's compassion and passion for justice.  The Inspector has me liking him one minute and rolling my eyes the next.  The constable always seems to surprise me with his steady kind humor and the doctor's zest for life easily overcomes what could be a trying constant commentary on women's rights.

I don't have to wait for the next weekly installment, but I burn through the plot too quickly. I wish the character development stayed at the season 1-3 level for longer. I appreciated the writers' thoughtful and provocative look at conflict from those times, religious, racial, and gender bias. Introducing characters known for innovation like Bell, Tesla, and Conan Doyle, brought that time period to life. Murdoch and Crabtree's inventive and imaginative natures personify the curiosity the has advanced the human culture so quickly in the past century. Brackenreid is the perfectly humorous curmudgeon and and a terrific personification of the leadership and humanity. As the series progressed it got more convoluted and soap-opera-like.

That said, the show appears to be fairly true to the way things were done back then as well as attitudes towards people that didn't fit the norm. As Murdoch works through these situations, he is helped by the Medical Examiner to realize that many of his attitudes are inappropriate and he takes much of her advice.

And I have watched the episodes over and over again - seeing new things each time.  It is a delightfully clever, intelligently written period piece which has mystery, murder, romance and humor.  I can see why it has received Gemini awards (equivalent to the US Emmy) and has continued for so many years.  If you can start from the first season and watch each one in order - you will follow the intricate character building and the changes that are occurring around them (in the late 1800s and into the early 1900s)  It's a wonderful show!!!",1404000000,,1194,4.247787610619469

3728102,5,B001O4C6NA,Entertaining series set at the turn of the century in Montreal. Quirky characters including a police detective that is also an inventor and is developing forensic tests.

William Murdock is a Toronto detective circa late 1890's and into 1900.  It is sleuthing at its best in an ever changing era. Murdock meets the occasional historical figure and is on hand for such modern inventions as the automobile and the airplane.  In fact, he's a bit of an inventor himself.  Add a little romance with the lovely Dr. Julia Ogdon, and it's the perfect program for anyone enjoying a good mystery.",1402358400,,592,4.653846153846154

This series has a great premise, a turn of the century ""CSI"" that incorporates modern technology to solve crimes.  It's a little farfetched, but it works for me.  I really enjoy the relationships between the characters, especially Det. Murdoch and Dr. Ogden.  I have not read the books, but I am now interested in reading them.

3728164,3,B001O4C6NA,"I enjoy the show very much, especially the historical references. One thing however, is the failure to make any reference to the Scots. I live in Northern USA, and have been in Canada many times The Scots influence is everywhere! Arthur Conan Doyle was a Scot with a noticeable accent, as was Alexander Graham Bell, and Andrew Carnegie. In fact they say that Carnegie flaunted his speech by saying that people listened more closely to him because they had a hard time understanding him. Yet two of them were given a plummy Southern English accent, and one spoke American. I am a curler, and again no reference to the  strong Scots connection. Even the caps were of a non tartan design. Anyone who knows anything about curling will tell you that the tartan 'Tammy' is  almost a  dress code. The only reference I can recall, was about how the Scots have to mind their manners when dealing with the English, as the Canadians do when dealing with the USA. Do I really have to remind you that the first Prime minister was also a Scot! I also dislike the ongoing reference to the Irish as ignorant trouble makers.
I suspect that the producers of this show are Southern English!!!",1402272000,,1173,4.6028708133971294

3728166,5,B001O4C6NA,"I've seen the entire first season and have started the second. This is a really entertaining program. It's set in Toronto, Canada circa 1889. IMDb.com gives it a 8.0 rating. That's high. The show is well made, It's a Canadian product so don't expect Hollywood treatment. But everything seems realistic. The scenes with the ME are very realistic, verging on gory. All the acting is good. The mysteries are well done and entertaining. Mysteries are my favorite dish and this show doesn't disappoint. I'll be very sorry when I've finished watching all the seasons. Although, it appears that the show is still in production in Canada, so I'm hopeful Amazon will offer Season 7, shot early this year. It appears there'll be a Season 8, too.

I've given an ""I love it"" score, though ""I like it a lot"" is probably closer, though not offered by Amazon.  :)",1402099200,,848,4.722972972972973

3728169,5,B001O4C6NA,"I really enjoy this series a lot. The writing, acting, plots, and (particularly) the production design (set in the 1900s in Canada) are exquisite. They throw in some history and historical figures as well (in the first episode they feature Nicolas Tesla and mention some of his real accomplishments; later they feature Sir Conan Doyle and his interest in the occult). And the little details of the period, such as the use of a bicycle for transportation for the main protagonist is a really nice touch. They *gently*, and with sensitivity, touch upon  topics ranging from  misogony to homosexuality and the attitudes of the era.

3728174,4,B001O4C6NA,"This series recounts the cases of Det. William Murdoch, who applies the known scientific principles of the late 1800s to solve sensational murder cases in the Toronto area. The recurring characters--earnest, cerebral Murdoch; coolly efficient medical examiner Dr. Julia Ogden; irascible old-school Insp. Breckenreid; and eager but sometimes bumbling Constable Crabtree--are all engaging and frequently amusing. The cases sometimes involve social issues as relevant today as they were in the 1890s. Historical figures also appear in some episodes, though liberties are taken with the facts of their lives. For instance, Arthur Conan Doyle's interest in spiritualism did not arise until after WWI.  Although the history is not strictly factual, the science appears to be, and the mystery plots are clever and generally do not strain credibility.  On the tech side of things, we streamed this series in HD from Amazon Prime on an Ethernet-connected Xbox 360, and the video and audio were flawless.  Fans of history and mystery, seasoned with generous helpings of humor, will find plenty to enjoy in Murdoch Mysteries.",1401840000,,1114,5.465116279069767

3728192,2,B001O4C6NA,"Perhaps as this series develops the characters and plot will be less stilted, but my sense from the first episode is that they were shooting for something they are incapable of reaching.  Stiff dialogue and, consequently, acting, mechanical use of modern cinematic techniques, and a story that weaves the plot gratuitously and unbelievably with history (technological history) left much to be desired.  Watching a later episode may prove that the creators of this show have matured and brought it together, but I have my doubts.",1400889600,,528,5.2

3728195,5,B001O4C6NA,"I love this show. I wish I'd been introduced to it sooner. Murdoch is a detective trying to drag his somewhat unwilling constabulary into the modern age. His breath of knowledge is somewhat astounding in that he dates, amasses knowledge, and builds contraptions, all while solving some of the most peculiar cases using modern techniques such as fingerprints. The constabulary often find his techniques fantastic and baffling until he explains his reasoning mainly through his actions and the results he obtains.",1400803200,,511,5.320987654320987

Murdoch is about the level of a mediocre American network show.  The acting is painful to watch, events are predictable, nothing is subtle, the leads are right out of a glamour magazine.  Maybe I'm uninformed, but it's hard for me to swallow a woman doctor in that era who is proficient at doing routine autopsies. Maybe I missed something.

I've been spoiled by Foyle, and Broadchurch.  I'm sticking with the Brittish series, and there are plenty of those to explore.",1400198400,10,589,4.679611650485437

(Well, they could shoot some additional stock drop-ins; the same little girl tuning and waving in the station house exterior shot needn't be in *every* episode, for instance.) It is a real cult show. I do find its handling of Catholicism a bit uninformed -- a Catholic so devout as to be thought overdue when he hasn't been to confession for six days, as in the earlier episode about the ""sodomite,"" would certainly know it is a mortal sin to take part in seances, for instance.

Into whose crime investigations famous people dropped in. Whose associates all had ideas anticipating progress and verbal expressions of the entire 20th century ahead (in 1901), including parallels with famous movies.

The main character Murdoch is a young police detective, who is interested in learning the latest technology in crime fighting techniques.  He is assisted in his cases by his superior, a somewhat gruff, but basically good hearted, police captain and the medical examiner (a young, female doctor).  There's no fancy special effects and, the pace is slower than what we've become accustomed to, which I think is a good thing.

I blame it on the fashion, as I usually hate anything having to do with history; however, as I age, I do find an appreciation for heritage attractions.  At any rate, Yannick Bisson was excellent in Sue Thomas F. B. Eye, so I was fascinated to discovered that he moved on to Murdoch Mysteries.  I love good mystery TV shows.

Murdoch is ahead of his time in forensic technology. It is a delight to watch as he develops ideas and solves problems based on what is now common in todays mysteries series.

I watched it when it was a single season and was anxious for the next seasons to be released. I particularly like Williams adventurous spirit in using techniques he has read about as experiments in his investigations that these modern times are ""old hat forensics"".
It is a program rated for the whole family to watch, with a exceptions (words).

3728276,5,B001O4C6NA,"This genre of shows are always about the characters and their personalities. The murder to solve is literally the MacGuffin. The actors and characters are the reasons we watch. Don't like Telly Savalas? No Kojak. Don't like Peter Falk? No Columbo for you. The four main characters, three male, one male, are each given distinct personality quirks - clearly influenced by Columbo and Monk -  and then there's the burgeoning love story. Between it all, there's a mystery to solve, and it's an enjoyable journey getting to the conclusion - conclusions that usually end in a win for the Toronto constables, but not always. The nod to the future - such as the ""online"" mystery using the telegraph rather than today's social media, is truly inventive. Would there be a female coroner back then, let alone one who dresses fashionably while cutting Ys in the chests of corpses? Probably not. But it's entertaining, still.",1396656000,,913,4.928571428571429

Despite his logical methodology, William is a compassionate and sensitive man when dealing with his suspects.  When it comes to his relationship with the lovely female coroner, however, William is awkward and shy.  He is an intriguing character.

3728328,4,B001O4C6NA,"This series is about a scientifically inclined police detective in early-20th-century Toronto, Canada. The plots are fairly interesting and the science is mostly correct, given the setting. They regularly break one of my rules of historic fiction: never have a character correctly predict the distant future unless (a) there really was an argument about it at the time or (b) the character has reasonably come by special knowledge that supports the prediction. And authors should be careful about having characters do the opposite, that is, saying things like, ""That will never happen,"" about things that we now know did happen. Anyway, this is a fairly light-hearted show that improved as it went along.

The detective Murdoch is bit too wonderful, but he is forward looking in his investigations and works well with the police staff. The ME is a woman, very unusual for this time period and obviously has a soft spot for Murdoch which, despite his intelligence and observational skill, is blind to. The young policeman Crabtree is fun. The scenery is beautiful as well as the costuming and the plots are interesting. My reason for not giving an extra star is the startling music and jumpy filming they do between scenes. Not necessary and is distracting.

3728438,5,B001O4C6NA,This was an excellent transaction.  The speedy delivery was much appreciated.  This mystery series is mesmerizing.  I prefer Murdoch to Sherlock--he's refreshingly modest.,1392595200,,171,6.3478260869565215

3728462,3,B001O4C6NA,Kind of a low budget Canadian series.  But enough humor and plot twists that we go back to them for a detective crime series that is a little lighter than some.  Nice that Amazon Prime has some of these Canadian series that are probably more obscure in the U.S.,1392422400,,261,4.3061224489795915

3728492,1,B001O4C6NA,"While this show certainly had potential, it erred too much on the side of ""political correctness"".  Maybe I'm being too hash, but the stance taken by this show on a number of episodes smacks overly much of ""preaching"".  Just state the story and I'll draw my own conclusions, thank you.",1391904000,10,285,4.68

While the historical details are interesting, I found the story line forced, as though the cleverness of including the historical detail was the core around which a plot had to be created.  I also found the dialogue stiff in the way that ""period"" speech can be--both an effort to convey that this was an earlier time (so they spoke differently than we do) and a bit of bafflement about how these folks could have possibly sounded speaking those funny words to each other.",1391040000,,544,4.9021739130434785

Murdoch's boss, the Inspector, is gruff but compassionate, and brings some comic relief along with the constables, Crabtree and Higgins. Dr. Ogden is an excellent medical examiner and supplies the romantic interest for Murdoch.",1390867200,,554,5.295454545454546

In fact, after Granada's Sherlock Holmes series (1984, Jeremy Brett) I liked this series. From season-1 to season-3, the writers did a fantastic job...the plots keep you up with the mystery. They make viewers aware of each clue and let viewers take part in deduction...this is exactly what I noticed in Granada's Sherlock Holmes series. I have watched many other mystery stories and none other could do this magic (at least to me!). This is why I somehow hate to watch BBC's Sherlock (Benedict, Martin), Agatha Christie's Poirot (which I always feel a phony sherlock holmes), CBS's Elementary. Along with this this series brings small scientific gadgets (lie detector, electric car etc), scientists like Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell etc etc...this was amazing.

Then came season 4, 5...love story blah blah...all those useless stuffs start...3 stars only because of season-4 and 5...",1389830400,,1015,5.151515151515151

3728571,5,B001O4C6NA,"After only one episode of this show set in late nineteenth century Toronto I was totally hooked, and now I'm happily making my way through all the seasons of this marvelous exploration of early police investigative techniques. Strong female characters, both good and bad, as well as interesting and credible supporting parts instead of the usual over-the-top depictions of bumbling coppers and cliched villains, render each episode a mini-masterpiece of detective fiction. Recognizable figures such as Nicola Tesla and Arthur Conan Doyle show up every so often to add an element of historical context to the birth pangs of forensic science, and every murder reveals a rivetingly seamy underside of human behavior. But it's the even more fascinating battles Detective Murdoch wages with his colleagues and detractors as he pursues resolution of each crime as well the fiercer one he wages within himself while struggling to find love again after the agonizing death of his fiancee from consumption, the old fashioned-word for tuberculosis, that make this show so gripping and poignant a depiction of human frailty as well as intrepidity. A truly innovative police procedural that stands out from the crowd by virtue of its strong, appealing lead characters, fascinating plots, and attention to period detail. A winner in every way!",1389312000,,1330,5.308056872037914

When I discovered I could download the TV series via Amazon Prime, I went in search of this series.  Found it under Murdoch Mysteries and downloaded seasons 1-5.  We watch an episode or two each evening.  Almost done with season 5.  Afraid I may have to pay for season 6.  If you're looking for an interesting take on a late 19th century whodunnit, check out Murdoch Mysteries.  It's clean, no foul language, the characters are interesting, and there are some comical insights regarding the development of forensics with regard to solving murders. Many of the characters are recurring,but episodes can stand alone.  The setting is Toronto.  I'd say the Canadians really put together a good one.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes to ""help"" figure out and solve the crime.",1389225600,,949,4.90566037735849

The stories are plunked down in the middle if 1890 Toronto and populated with historical characters, like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, during an age of scientific explanation. That alone makes the stories interesting. Add to that a view of period attitudes and beliefs about morality that seem so raw and outmoded today, and you get a rich and fascinating tale worth the telling. Beautifully designed sets and costumes put skin on the bones. Loved it.",1389139200,,572,5.095744680851064

3728585,5,B001O4C6NA,"...Unless you tend to be addicted to this kind of series and you don't want to get trapped again... This is really the whole package... Each episode has its own features of history, science, ways of living, opinions (very interesting, sometimes hilarious to me especially when they caricature the French behavior -season 4- because ""I'm a true French from France, Monsieur Murdoch""), humor, ""clins d'oeil"" to the future and even some romance (the very Victorian classic type obviously, don't expect too much...) in the Canadian city of Toronto at the very end of the 19th century. It is my short summary but other reviews are so well documented about the series, characters and the inspiration (M. Jennings novels), I can't compete.
I believe ""primary"" actors worked their characters a lot, they are really convincing. Among them, I am a huge fan of Inspector B. and his verbatim (especially the most often appropriate ""bloody hell"") and I definitely have a crush on Detective M. This man is the whole package too! Too bad he is that old... I mean, probably around 143 years old... Anyway, he is a genius in physics, curious, determined, rigorous, meticulous, passionate, well mannered, a wee bit bashful especially with the beautiful and clever Dr O. (that's the why of don't expect too much in the ""romance"" part), very (very very very?) lucky, one has to say... and last but not least (for me anyway), he speaks French! Pretty good, n'est-ce pas ?
""Secondary"" actors are not always at the top but it doesn't shade the whole package to my opinion, it is quite funny actually. In fact, my main concern would be about the snow. The series is supposed to take place in Toronto and I thought this city should be under several inches of snow part of the year, no? Well, apparently I was wrong, what does a French girl know about Canada after all...
PS: A Prime member? You can watch season 1 to 5 for free. They are currently programming the end of season 7 on CBC and season 6 is available on DVDs. I purchased season 6 of course and I can't wait for season 7 to be available!!!",1388620800,,2076,4.659400544959128

3728592,5,B001O4C6NA,Great mystery stories that sometimes include historical sidelines from the 19th century.  The underlying love story is believable having a female doctor.  It's nice to see the application for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes basics being applied by a detective.  Most of the Holmes stories are still the  basics for criminology today.,1388361600,,342,5.39622641509434
3728593,5,B001O4C6NA,What can I say about this season is that it is as good as all the other seasons. However in season 1 it gives you how everything got started. To see the way the characters are starting to blossom and how they have changed from season 1 to season 5.

As a teacher, it's something that I can show to my students without worry and we all enjoy it. Some themes are more suited to older children, but it does make for great discussion. It's also just a great series and I am happy to see Yannick Bisson. He was wonderful on Sue Thomas, FBI and is equally as good on The Artful Detective.

3728608,5,B001O4C6NA,"I discovered Murdoch Mysteries on Ovation TV (under the name ""The Artful Detective""), where I doubt it will get much promotion and it will be very difficult for the U.S. audience to discover in the ""high numbers wasteland"" of cable TV. This series is a terrific mix of slightly-steampunk Victorian costume drama, MacGyver-tech police procedural, X-Files-meets-Scooby-Doo unmasking of the supernatural, and clever mysteries and secret histories sprinkled with quirky comic moments and all the struggles of true love. Murdoch Mysteries has the addictive quality of genre TV even as it defies or transcends all categories. It crosses the intelligence of British TV with the pacing and eye candy of American TV, and produces a miraculous hybrid.

Murdoch Mysteries is set in Toronto, which for most U.S. viewers will be the equivalent of another planet, but this isn't ""alienating"" at all - the time period is familiar enough that the location could be Any City in the Victorian Era. Better yet, this series is Mom-safe: the humor doesn't go near the toilet (though it often finds its way into the morgue) and the modernizing values are cloaked in old-fashioned courtesy. In fact, I bought this series for my Mom for Christmas, and I know she's going to love it. Yet there's plenty for younger demographics to enjoy, from clockpunk gadgets to shipping favorite couples. (Though I must admit that the show occasionally teeters into rather awkward fan service on the shipping front - I'd rather see the passionate kiss than Constable Crabtree musing on when those crazy kids will get together.) Also, there is enough ""angst"" and outright depressing turns of events to enthrall the moodiest of Millennials. What more can the sick-of-reality-TV jaded American TV watcher ask?

Murdoch Mysteries is now in its 7th season in Canada, where the show is a big hit and the quality remains high. I just hope it will somehow be discovered by American viewers soon so the syndication money will pour in, and this wonderful show will continue for years to come.",1387152000,,2043,5.041420118343195

3728611,2,B001O4C6NA,"The lead character (Murdoch) has very little emotive capability. The period piece setup of late 1880s is fine but the mystery deduction is simplistic. To insert an icon like Mr. Tesla, the inventor of AC electricity, in the show seemed poor.

3728615,5,B001O4C6NA,I love this series. The premise is a cross between Sherlock and CSI in the early 1900s. The detective tracks down the villain with real sleuthing and you usually don't find out who-done-it until the end.  Well written plots and good acting.,1386633600,,240,4.714285714285714

But Murdock is a man of many talents, mostly because he's very intelligent and very curious, and in this time period there are so many new things to 'play with'.
The show intorduces many 'name brands' so to speak, in the context of the story line, such as Tessler, and in later episodes, AGBell, and so many others.
Having a woman Dr in this time period is wonderful, both as a love interest for Murdoch and because she is also up to date on many new procedures. And the supporting cast is great.",1386028800,,659,4.238095238095238

3728638,5,B001O4C6NA,excellent series. I really enjoy the beginnings of so much of our technology and so many of the historical figures that lived at the turn of the century. The series even high-lights different considerations of the sides of America's civil war.,1384819200,,243,4.951219512195122
3728639,5,B001O4C6NA,"This is a wonderful show.  I just found it recently and enjoyed a marathon of season 1.  I immediately jumped back on Amazon and purchased the next 5 seasons.  If you have watched the shows Copper or Ripper Street and were turned off by either of those series because of the violence or child exploitation storyline, do yourself a favor and try this show.  (I personally enjoyed Ripper Street immensely, but did not like the characters or some of the story lines in Copper.)

Murdoch Mysteries is really delightful in how it shows the main character and his coworkers solving crimes when forensics were basically in their infancy.  They also meet some famous historical characters at times, and at other times they get to interact with early inventions in a charming way.  The cast has very nice chemistry.  And the costumes and sets are very well done.  It has a wonderful quality to me in that I almost feel as though I just enjoyed a nice evening at a theatre production.  This show can be enjoyed with the entire family and I highly recommend it!  Enjoy!",1384560000,,1058,4.634408602150538

The story lines are surprisingly contemporary. They deal with homosexuality, racism and other issues in a very open and modern way. I am not sure that these issues would be presented the same way back in the 1800's. Even though it is a murder mystery show the actual episodes are very tame.

3728687,1,B001O4C6NA,"After finding the first episode slow moving and not very interesting, I watched 3 more to see if I just picked a bad episode and so I didn't make a judgment about the series based on just one episode.

I'm puzzled about the rave reviews. Yannick Bisson is a pretty face but it's hard to know whether the writing is as flat as it seems or Bisson just isn't a good actor.  The anachronisms are irritating, and the stories are uninteresting and without the elements which make a CSI/police type drama appealing. Worse, Det. Murdoch too often looks confused, like he doesn't understand what's going on. His empty look & frequent loss for words are embarrassing.

The story is supposed to hold your interest, but I found myself glancing at the clock to see how much time was left. The dialogue is silly and amateurish. Even considering the era in which the drama takes place, the characters, the plot, and the dialogue & relationship between characters feels unreal, not credible.

As an aside, if you are offended by the idea of 2013 standards of morality & political correctness in a show which takes place in 1895, you'll want to pass on this show. I may get clobbered for that cautionary note, but it's my opinion. The P.C. drop-ins are contrived and are not things which characters in that era would have said or done.

Murdoch Mysteries may be considered a success based on being around for 7+ years, but I'm not impressed. Perhaps I'm just not part of the target audience, and we do have different tastes. But the absence of dramatic substance and good writing & character development makes Murdoch Mysteries not worth my time.",1381536000,44,1629,4.681818181818182

3728702,5,B001O4C6NA,"If you like mystery cop shows, you'll love the Artful Detective (the American title for Murdoch Mysteries). The show is Sherlock Holmes meets CSI without the gore of shows like Bones.  The Victorian setting is beautifully done, it's fun to see what life was like at the cusp of modern technology. Topics like racism, abortion, and prejudice are tackled from the historical Victorian perspective showing how far we've come and how far we have yet to go. I will admit that it takes some suspension of belief to get past the advanced forensics. For example, the police are just beginning to realize the usefulness of ""fingermarks"" to identify suspects yet Dr. Ogden has an uncanny ability to accurately determine time and cause of death. The chemistry between Murdoch and Dr Ogden is a nice subplot and it's fun to see characters get to know each other and ""court"" rather than immediately jumping into bed together. The relationship between Murdoch and his boss, Inspector Brackenreid, is compelling. The conflict between solving crimes using reason and logic versus the belief that a suspect just needs some ""physical persuasion"" to confess is interesting, especially in a time period when police brutality is commonplace and ""the noose"" is often the punishment for murder.

Overall, Murdoch Mysteries is a great concept that will appeal to mystery fans as well as those who enjoy cop shows and especially period pieces.",1380499200,,1418,5.055555555555555

He works with an open mind, to any/all evidence. The forensic physician is a lady, and is always on hand to give Murdoch good advice and help. It's quite a good TV series, and enjoyable. Lets you see life in the 1900s, and how the police worked toward solving homicides, and crime scenes, when they didn't have all the modern gadgets of our days.",1380067200,,732,4.553030303030303

3728743,4,B001O4C6NA,"I found Murdoch Mysteries on my Kindle Prime when I was just wandering the categories to see what was out there. This looked familiar to me so I took a chance. It actually wasn't what I was expecting, but it caught my attention. I watched a couple of episodes and couldn't decide if it was a straight Detective show or a light hearted parody. The usual murder tends to be cleverly done, the sidekick is really trying to learn from Murdoch, and the Boss is a gruff Yorkshireman prone to English terms as ""Me old Mucker"" maybe he's a Lancashire man? The Lady Doctor is nice and their relationship is heading toward romance.
The show is set in Late 19th Century Canada but we are also treated to Murdochs science experiments like ""Fingermarks"" to help solve crimes, this is certainly not true history but not a bad effort to show times changing.
My one quibble is the stock footage between scenes, same shots of same folk walking and tasking and will that little girl ever get to where she's heading. That's the reason for four stars, small issue but could have done better.
All in all a pleasant show and I am currently midway through Season 2 but no spoilers. and will watch all available.
I believe there were 5 seasons, but as is usual, Kindle is only allowing four as Prime offers. Sadly I cannot afford 2.99ea for maybe 12 shows to see how it all turns out. Maybe I ask for too much, but I would like the entire set of seasons rather than just some.

4 Very Lovely Stars

IMDB Synopsis: In the late 1890s, police Inspector William Murdoch takes a new, more scientific approach to solving crimes. Assisted by coroner Dr. Julia Ogden and Constable George Crabtree, Murdoch introduces such concepts as finger marks and lie detecting machines. He has the support of his somewhat doubtful superior, Inspector Brackenreid, though at times, even he finds Murdoch's methods - and claims - somewhat astounding.

I discovered this lovely little Canadian show a few months ago on a long weekend break. I flew through the three seasons available on Netflix and went in search of the rest of the seasons, pleased to find that a new season (season 7) is airing this fall. Thrilled is probably a better word. This show is pretty much CSI set in the 1890's. Murdoch is a man ahead of his time, reading anything and everything, learning scientific techniques that other constables find ridiculous and a waste of time.

Murdoch generally tries to explain things and people almost never understand. Especially not his superior, Inspector Brackenreid, although he, over time, becomes very supportive of Murdoch as he sees his unquestionable value to the Constabulary.

Murdoch's sensibilities are also offended or surprised on a regular basis, which is frequently quite adorable. And refreshing, to be honest.

I love Murdoch because he is the perfect gentleman. He is hungry for knowledge, and he cares about justice, not just closing a case. He will find the truth, no matter where that takes him.

One thing I ADORE about this show is the constant conflict between Murdoch's job and his faith. He's a Roman Catholic, and that many times causes a problem when he's investigating. You see much of his work through that worldview, therefore seeing his compassion, and at times, righteous anger. It is a very important plot point, not something that goes away after a few episodes. It adds a very interesting level of character development, not just for Murdoch, but for his love interest, Dr. Julia Ogden.

Oh Dr. Ogden. Beautiful, brilliant, and completely unreasonable. I have a love/hate relationship with Julia. She manages to frustrate me almost every episode, but I still like her.

ANYWAY. The Comedic relief is none other than the illustrious George Crabtree. I thought he was going to annoy the crap out of me when I started this show, but he turned out to be one of my favorite characters. He'll surprise you.

Mainly episodic, Murdoch Mysteries has guest appearances from history, such as William Churchill, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Nicola Tesla. Really a fun and pleasant watch, with lots of good acting and clever writing. And of course, the costumes are lovely.

A great show for fans of Downton Abbey or most period BBC shows.",1374710400,,2791,5.021645021645021

This is no Hollywood production with lavish sets and all that, but it's way, way better in terms of story and characters.

3728786,5,B001O4C6NA,Murdoch Mysteries is out of Canada and one of the best shows that I recently discovered.  The writing is brilliant.  The ensemble cast works well together.  I love the special guests that visit Toronto in 1895.  And the way that science is handled is both appropriate for the time period but also foreshadowing.

I can't say that for the Murdoch movies though.  They were a little to raw for my taste.  BUT, the Tv Series was delightful.  There's something so inviting about a good plot - a little hint of romance - and the wonderful scientific and medical discoveries that took place in another era.  The use of known celebrities of the time like Thomas Edison etc. was a great addition.  Worth every penny and plan to re-watch the whole series in about six months.",1371859200,,629,4.663636363636364

3728809,5,B001O4C6NA,"I've only watched S1:E1 to date, so a little difficult to know for sure. However, there were many positives so I plan to view more episodes. My very favorite part is the science aspect that is incorporated. The lead is an attractive, smart, charming man who does not seem to be a womanizer - in fact interest in woman struck me as 'low on his list' in this first episode. I liked that. (There is a female coroner who probably offers some future sexual tension.) I like the 'real fellow' character, George, a constable. Affable, loyal and good hearted but always concerned about the task at hand. There were moments when I felt more like I was watching live theatre than television (don't get me wrong, I love theatre), which can be a bit pace-breaking. However, this was the first episode. And, as I said earlier, the incorporation of the 'new science' of the times is really quite interesting. So, overall, I found it quite enjoyable. Plus it was recommended to me by a friend whose tastes are very similar to mine. All this leads me to the early conclusion that it will be easy to get 'hooked' on this series!

July 6, 2013:  I've now just started Season 4. And, as I suspected, I am hooked on this show! The characters are developing right before me with each episode. They are complex and interesting - very human and real. The incorporation of the 'new sciences' is such an interesting aspect. Dr. Ogden is my favorite; but each of the four main characters is special in his/her own way. And William, what can I say? One minute you want to hug him and the next minute you want to shake him and ask, ""What are you thinking!!"" It just confirms how excellent the acting and writing are in this series.",1371340800,,1703,4.490322580645161

When Murdoch is taking too long to identify the culprit, Inspector Brackenreid uses good old time-tested methods of beating the truth out of people... much to Murdoch's dismay.

3728839,5,B001O4C6NA,"Most of us have always enjoyed good detective stories and while searching for a similar TV series on Amazon Prime Instant Videos I stumbled across this astute Canadian detective series.  Fortunately the first four seasons are free rentals if you purchase Amazon Prime for shipping.  The series centers around Detective William Murdoch working for the Toronto, Canada constabulary just before the turn of the Twentieth Century.  The series is produced in Canada and it has great stories and exceptional writing, excellent acting and directing, top drawer production values, good camera work and special effects, and well matched music.  One of the many things I like about the writing is the clever site and verbal pokes we are given that has us laughing at our and the writers inside jokes.  This often happens when Constable Crabtree (has some of the funniest lines) or another predicts how something will be done or used in the ""future"".  I find it especially entertaining because celebrities of the period and the industrial age inventions and changes to society are at the forefront in inspiring much of how investigations are conducted.  I highly recommend this series.  After viewing four seasons of this excellent series I wonder how many other great Canadian movies and TV I have missed.  I can guarantee I will be looking for more from all those involved with this wonderful series.

The interaction between Murdoch and the female coroner (could a woman have such a position in the early 1900's?!) is entertaining as they move toward a romantic relationship.  But, often the series is just too cartoonish: (1) the constable added for comic relief can be irritating, (2) the bluster of Murdoch's boss is so stereotypical of the boss nearly all crime dramas, (3) the characters ""accidently"" thinking of modern day inventions also becomes too cute.

3728856,1,B001O4C6NA,"I was looking for a period drama that would be clean and wholesome. But instead I found faith and the Bible being openly questioned.  Homosexuality and spiritualism were upheld and Biblical truth was put down (Episode 4 & 5).  So disappointing.  I guess I should have known better, most things on TV have a liberal slant.  I feel like such a fool for thinking this series would be different.  And I would agree with Murdoch's original name for a homosexual=a sodomite!  I disagree with the doctor on episode 5, God did not give men deviant and sinful desires but they are a result of the decaying effects of sin.  God is trying to save us from ourselves and the ultimate consequence of sin, eternal death.

By-play between the characters amuses without diluting the procedural action. Genuine character development occurs throughout the first season; anticipate some delicious surprises.
Sprinkled across episodes are visits from historic figures like Nikola Tesla and Arthur Conan Doyle, emphasizing the quirks in their personalities yet believably integrated into the plots.
The location filming (Toronto and Hamilton, according to the end credits) is gorgeous, showing off the Victorian and Edwardian masterpieces there.

3728870,3,B001O4C6NA,"Murdoch mystery, period piece, set back in the day before horseless carriages, but leading into that era.

As per usual on this sort of thing, there's the front story (the murder) and the back story (character development), mysteries (murders) are decent and thought out pretty well.  Backstory on the characters, not great, but not terrible.  Acting ... well, everyone thinks this era is filled with stodgy people with broomsticks up their backsides and that's the flaw of the thing really.  The main character Murdoch is played EXTREMELY understated, and at this point drags down the series considerably.

It definitely gets better in the following seasons.

The historical tie-ins are nice, historical characters brought in (Tesla, Houdini, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle), are nice.

Worth a look see, entertaining, but not the sort of thing where I'd watch an episode more than once.",1365033600,2,880,5.198581560283688

3728874,5,B001O4C6NA,I chose this rating because all the actors fit their parts and played them well within the confines of their character. I think the main character was just stilted enough to be what he was as a perfect detective and a good Roman Catholic in Toronto. The story is well written and acted to perfection. I have suggested this show for all of my best friends. I appreciate the acting of each of the principals and those who have other roles in the story.,1364601600,,450,4.369047619047619

From the beginning, I was impressed by the attention to detail in spoken dialogue, period dress and manners and the very clever way in which the writers incorporate the technology of the day to show how the application then known science and math could provide true forensic analysis. The hero, Murdoch, while applying logic, observation and induction to the solution of crimes, is no mere copy of the estimable Sherlock Holmes. The writers also provide a refreshing point of view regarding the politics of the day.  Rascism, the oppression of women and children and many other issues are presented in the context of rational discourse, not with polemics. This review is for the seasons 1 through 5.

I really enjoyed every episode in the season, plus they are under 50 min with no commercials.  They have developed the characters nicely. There are many funny inferences to the future- Murdoch tastes coffee and wonders why anyone would drink it when tea is available and goes on to say it won't catch on. . .  then there was a Martian spaceship episode that they moved the secret gov operation and it was called area 51.  If you listed there are several that make me laugh out loud.  The Jack the ripper episode was so good too with the building romantic bond with the Dr Ogden.

Not that they always have to experience success but that you like them enough to want them to do well.  When you watch a TV show long enough, there is a sense of letting these people (characters) into your home like family.  You become interested not only in the story, but what it is that makes the character who he/she is.  Some of that was revealed in the long, drawn out romance between Murdoch and Dr. Ogden.  Something you don't see very often in TV programming.  It was a lot of fun watching them trying to sense what the other was thinking without revealing to much of their own feeling for fear of offending the other.  The use of scientific techniques is enjoyable as well, if not a little over the top, but that can make for good television, too.",1363046400,,871,4.366459627329193

I quickly tired of the writers approach to the characters: Murdoch, a man of Victorian principles, with a strong catholic upbringing and moral compass finds his values under constant challenge by the progressive post modern world views of the female coroner doctor character/love interest. Filled with expected character cliches- the brilliant & quirky,often misunderstood hero, the ranting chief of police, the macabre coroner, and the plucky and often humorous side kick.

Here is just a taste of what we have learned: (1) prostitutes are noble and government regulation of the ""sex-trade"" is a good thing, (2) the temperance movement (a mischaracterization of all christians) is evil, as typified by one practitioner--an overcompensating garrotter (ironic--regulating prositution is good, but regulating alcohol is bad), (3) 1890 sexual mores are effectively no different than our own--Guy: ""Did you bring protection?"" Girl: ""I didn't think I'd need any."" ; and (4) abortionists are caring, sacrificial individuals who help women (the victims, in fact, of their many poor decisions--this last the worst) at great personal risk--a one sided treatment where the unborn remain voiceless and without a champion.

My wife and I were expecting a series with genuine substance. From several of the positive reviewer comments, it seems this series is considered great viewing among those who regularly buy lottery tickets.

3728955,1,B001O4C6NA,"No better than the movie versions, the TV series should prove offensive to anyone who values decency.  This is filled with politically correct messages which media corporations everywhere seem intent on forcing down the throats of decent folk.  This series manages to degrade and insult Catholics, Christians in general, men, White men, White people, heterosexuals, families, you name it, if it is the enemy of the the politically correct establishment, it will be attacked here.

Would a less offensive approach make this series better?  Not by much.  It is still boring, boring, boring.  Like the movies of the same name, it is produced for people with short attention spans.  The writing is horrible, almost like a computer program generated the lines.  No sign of genius here.  The camera work is all the ADD inspired fast cuts accompanied by thumping music that I hate so much.

Since the reviews on Amazon are supposed to be helpful, positive or negative, let me help you decide if this is for you.  If you get turned on by evil White guys being lectured about intolerance, or you hate Christians, Western culture, heterosexuality, or the family, then by all means, buy this and watch it over and over.

Detective William Murdoch, played by Yannick Bisson, has a strong interest in the scientific approach and uses his interest and ability to look at crime from a different perspective which amazes his associates.

The acting is sufficient and the scenery is interesting as well as the characters encountered in the stories. Episode 1 for example introduces the viewer to Nikola Tesla and refers to the great debate over direct current versus alternating current.

If any of the children in the family have an interest in science this series could well generate curiosity about science and promote research into the topics referenced.

I found that I wanted to do some research on the early development of electrical distribution in the USA and Canada. It was interesting to read about Tesla and his efforts with George Westinghouse and their importance in making electrical grids operational.

In addition to their stimulating content they're also fun to watch and are generally family friendly. I recommend them highly.",1325721600,5,1141,5.184782608695652

Most episodes hinge around some technology or something else that wouldn't have been unheard of at during that time period, but would have been cutting edge or even theoretical in practice.  It's a little corny sometimes, but still entertaining.

I first checked it out because it was mentioned as being kind of ""steampunk"" and I guess it fits that genre to greater or lesser degrees at times.  It's also an odd mix of British and American being set in Canada.

3728959,4,B001O4C6NA,"I am really excited to have found this series. I'm only part way into the second season but already consider myself a fan. Having seen the three original movies made about Inspector Murdoch (starring different actors), it took me a few episodes to get used to the new faces playing the leads.

But once I did, I came to view this series as superior to the other version (although I do miss Keeley Hawes). Yannick Bisson captures the sympathetic, mild-mannered character of Murdoch well and his female pathologist sidekick is also well played by Helene Joye.

If I had any complaint it would be the fact the series starts out of nowhere, whereas the original movie versions began with Inspector Murdoch's first meeting of Dr. Ogden and we follow along as he first begins grooming Constable Crabtree as a sidekick. I would have preferred this series to start in a similar place but that's a minor thing.

Over all, this series is good enough to overlook the little things. The sets, filming, and music are ideal and I enjoyed the fact this series is set in Toronto, rather than the more common Victorian London. That and Inspector Murdoch's fascination with science make interesting additions to what otherwise might have been your more typical Victorian era mystery series.

Final thought: Although I'm a fan, I wouldn't recommend this series for children as there's quite a lot of dissecting of corpses going on in Doctor Ogden's lab, and as some of the murders are on the gruesome side.",1320019200,3,1487,4.796875

3728961,1,B001O4C6NA,"The ""pretty boy"" and girl look of this show was my first disappointment. The anachronistic dialog was my second. Even if 1890s Canada were to have a lovely young female pathologist on the police force (unlikely at best) she would not be so frank in her speech.  The producers and directors should have watched the British series ""The Infinite Worlds of H.G. Wells"" for an example of how to balance modern viewing tastes with more authentic atmosphere.

The other drawback for me was the erratic, jerky filming techniques. I realize this is quite ""en vogue"" right now, but I felt the fast cut video editing and overly dramatic music was an attempt to make the show seem more exciting than it was.

I'm first to admit that my dislike of the show is a reflection of my personal preferences so YOU may enjoy it. And perhaps I was hoping for another series like the great Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series (in which case, I was sure to be disappointed).

3728966,4,B001O4C6NA,"Most police procedurals are very, very modern-day. ""Murdoch Mysteries, Season One"" breaks the mold by jumping back in time to late 19th-century Toronto, and featuring a detective who used the scientific breakthroughs of the day. It's a fun, clever series overlaid with dark themes, and the only problem is a tendency to be too politically correct.

Detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) and pathologist Doctor Julia Ogden (Hlne Joy) are watching an electrical demonstration when a young woman is killed -- and they soon discover it was murder. And when another person dies by electrocution, Murdoch has to unravel a tangle of motives with the help of Nicola Tesla.

It's not Murdoch's last weird case -- a serial killer thought to be dead, a black boxer shot in the heart, a spiritualist who leads him to a dead body, a murdered groom with a secret gay life, a murder seemingly committed by Murdoch's father, a corpse hidden in a theater ceiling, romance and hazing at the rowing club, a creepy ventriloquist who may have committed murder, Irish rebels, an adoptive father murdered for a horrible crime, a killer in a Grim Reaper costume, and a possible Martian invasion.

It's not really steampunk, but ""Murdoch Mysteries"" has a very steampunky flavor -- it includes some historical people (Nicola Tesla, Arthur Conan Doyle) and period technology (early motorcycles, airships, forensic equipment). It's as if you had gone back in time to 1890s Toronto, and then created a police-procedural.

The mysteries are very well-written, with lots of suspects, motives and sometimes weird methods of committing the crime (how did a man end up hung in a tree when nobody could come near the tree?); the only difficulty was ""Belly-Speaker,"" whose ending is just befuddling. And it's lovely to look at: lots of beautiful Victorian houses, lush hotels, pleasant Canadian countrysides and a sunlit Toronto that looks very pleasant on the outside.

The biggest problem with the series is that the writers squirm at the attitudes of the time -- racism and anti-Catholic prejudice are only lightly touched on, and only Brackenreid is anything but tolerant of gays. It feels very anachronistic.

Bisson plays Murdoch as a rather uptight, conflicted man with lots of repressed emotions, and whose powers of deduction are rooted in his logical mind and photographic memory. However, he's a bit difficult to warm up to at first because of that. Thomas Craig is quite fun as the blunt, raucous inspector who prefers old-fashioned detecting, while Joy and Jonny Harris make likable sidekicks for Murdoch.

""Murdoch Murders Season One"" suffers from some anachronisms, but it's still a thoroughly enjoyable, clever period series -- think a Canadian CSI mingled with a steampunk murder mystery.",1278201600,7,2774,5.137472283813747

Upon watching the first 5 minutes of the ""series"" 1, episode 1, I instantly senced an improvement.  I should wait further comment until completing the series 1 and 2 I have ordered.

It's great to see a show this well produced and featuring a long ago time period that may have some historical inaccuracies but not overly so.  We need more period dramas out there and it's a great thing to see a very good one on television being produced somewhere and in english.

3728973,5,B001O4C6NA,"I was intrigued about this show but hesitated buying it.  Finally I just had to have it and I am so glad I bought it.  It is very different and that makes it great, not your run of the mill mystery.  This one requires thought and is very well done.  Also set in Toronto instead of New York or LA.  Great purchase.",1255219200,5,313,3.9838709677419355
3728974,5,B001O4C6NA,"I'd heard a lot about it and was curious.  Here in the US several years ago we had a shortlived series called Peacemakers with Tom Berrenger that was more of a western setting and included early forensics such as this.

I know Yannick Besson from his work on Sue Thomas FBEye, but have been very pleasantly surprised by the rest of the cast.",1252972800,2,341,4.396825396825397
3728975,2,B001O4C6NA,"Imposing 21st Century politically correctness on a supposed 19th Century world ruins the series. It is not entirely certain whether the series intends to belittle the mentality (and faith) of everyone or just Canadians. Though the series tries to be forensically scientific, it more nearly resembles fantasy with frequent anachronisms, fallacious logic, and impossible situations. The quality is good (2 stars) but the content insults the intelligence (one star). The second disk gets positively preachy.",1248825600,27,504,5.733333333333333
3728976,5,B001O4C6NA,"Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) has a face like George Clooney & bikes around Toronto looking like a Wright Brother.
MURDOCH MYSTERIES is now among my favorite TV mystery series.
The opening set, props, & costumes, including Murdoch arriving on his 2-wheel safety bicycle, immediately transforms the viewer to Victorian days of Toronto. Filmed in Toronto & Hamilton, Canada.

Murdoch seems to have the fortune to be on hand when technological advancements are made, or scientific discoveries are born.  With a bit of tongue-in-cheek, these astonishing breakthroughs assist Murdoch's investigations.

Waiting for the next bit of gadgetry is as exciting as watching Murdoch and Toronto's 4th police station solve crimes. These murders carry with them the occasional scenes that cause mirth, smiles, and laughs.  Many of today's routine crime investigation techniques were originated, or at least often used, by Murdoch.  Such as fingermarks, time line analysis, ballistics, lie detection, etc.

13 46-minute Episode details:
1 POWER Miss Toronto Elec. & Light gets electrically struck down. Who? Why?
2 GLASS CEILING A trunk delivered to Station #4 contains a body. Will the inspector be next?
3 KNOCKDOWN A black boxer is shot. Murdoch must clear the wife & find the true killer.
4 ELEMENTARY, MY DEAR MURDOCH A medium tells Murdoch where a body is buried. Sherlock Holmes creator, Doyle, assists this search.
5 TIL DEATH DO US PART Wedding day death in the church office. Inheritance? The intended bride? Murdoch reveals much.
6 LET LOOSE THE DOGS Pub argument precedes a death. Murdoch's drinking dad? What's the truth about Murdoch's mom?
7 BODY DOUBLE A theater stage catches a body dropping from the ceiling. Not part of Macbeth. Facial reconstruction helps as did finding the hidden......
8 STILL WATERS Just prior to Olympic Trials a rower is dead. Coach & rower who was replaced are suspect, but they're just the beginning. A funny lie detector scene with Murdoch attached.
9 BELLY SPEAKER Murder by varnish drinking. Who dun it? The belly speaker, ventriloquist, or the dummy? The story takes a twist, after a twist, after a twist. A stellar episode.
10 CHILD'S PLAY Industrialist murder, a supporter of homes for orphans.
11 BAD MEDICINE This killer is robed, hooded, and shoots crossbow. Robin of the Hood? A medium sees all, including Murdoch's future death.
12 THE PRINCE & THE REBEL Grandson Prince Alfred (Queen Victoria's) gets Murdoch and Crabtree as guards. A dead girl, a tattoo, and suddenly the Irish Republican Brotherhood are suspect. Is the Prince in danger?
13 THE ANNOYING RED PLANET A suspect suicide hanging in a tree with no footprints below. How? Crabtree suspects Martians. Who or what was the killer?

One of the best. Suspenseful yet light at moments. Fun viewing.
SUBTITLES INCLUDED.  Also bonus stuff about author, cast, bios, & other films.

I'm VERY GLAD I got this set.",1248220800,10,2899,5.112050739957716
3728977,1,B001O4C6NA,"After watching the original miniseries with Peter outerbridge & Keeley Hawes my expectation were high for this series - what a let down. The makers of this series took a well scripted, beautifully acted mystery series & dumbed it down to the extent that the episodes would hold anyone's attention span. They replaced Outerbridge with a more glossy (I hesitate to say Actor)and Keeley Hawes with a visual look alike.
The scripts are sharp and glossy & with no depth whatever. Charracter development is an alien concept to this series. This series is a complete waste of time and money. I wish I could award it negative stars!

Take my advice and don't waste your money on this terrible production!",1246492800,44,696,4.8
