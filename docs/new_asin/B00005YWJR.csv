I find that the music in this tape calms her down and I also loved the colors used.  It is all done in red, black, and white just like her musical mobile that we have above her crib.  I would highly recomend this video to anyone who has an infant.  It was made so specifically for babies and that's what I like.

She was ""gooing"" through out the video and it really did soothe her.  As a labor and delivery nurse I know first hand that the way this video was designed with contrasting color like red, white and black it was designed specifically for my infant.  I know that infants can only see contrast not color so this video was perfect.  It is very unique becuase it is the only video I have seen so specificall designed for the senses of an infant ( and believe me I have a huge stock of infant and children's video's)I give thisvideo and A+++.  Every parent should have one for their newborn.
