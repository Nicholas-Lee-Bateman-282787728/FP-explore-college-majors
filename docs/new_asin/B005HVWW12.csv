If you really enjoy overkill anime humor you may want to skip the final ""final"" episode as it doesn't contribute to the story and goes to extremes in silliness. The rest of the series certaintly has enough comedic elements to keep the main storyline from becoming dark (the nekko mene alone are more than a giggle at times). Fair warning though if you have cats be careful not to play the opening theme song around them.

4705739,4,B005HVWW12,"What starts off looking like a pain, but grows into something beautiful if you bear with it? Well, ivy, but the answer could also be Moon Phase. I went into this anime with low expectations and came away a fan.

Before I go into the review proper, I want to correct a wrong impression I feel like the item description conveys. While Moon Phase is very funny at times, I wouldn't classify it as a ""light-hearted comedy."" It's more of a paranormal adventure story interlaced with slice-of-life drama. It's a character-driven show about family, love, and finding a place where one belongs... and yeah, freaky vampires with weird powers. The comedy is more of a bonus than anything. With that cleared up, I'll discuss the show's shortcomings before I start bragging on it.

I think it's fair to say that Moon Phase's biggest ""con"" is more of a ""loli-con."" Frankly, this anime has a pretty unsubtle Lolita complex. The relationship between 20-something Kouhei and 13-year-old Hazuki is clearly portrayed as something more romantic than ""brother and sister"" at times, and Kouhei's underage cousins are also portrayed as romantic rivals of a sort. The anime seems to expect the viewer to be totally okie-dokie with this, with the result for me, and I suspect for most viewers, that several scenes felt awkward and uncomfortable. To Moon Phase's credit, though, it never pushes this envelope very far and always reels it back within the bounds of platonic good taste by stressing the family angle.  Moon Phase is also surprisingly chaste for anime fare (low on fanservice, zero nudity, etc.), so if you can tolerate the occasional loliconnotations even just a little bit, I think you'll be okay.

Moon Phase's other big flaw is a lack of consistency in terms of tone. The first two-thirds of the show is consistent and solid, carrying its odd mixture of Gothic vampire action and slice-of-life comedy forward with panache. However, starting around episode 18, it feels like the writers had an identity crisis and decided they wanted to direct a plot arc for Yu-Yu Hakusho or Naruto. Without giving away any major spoilers, what was once a character-driven drama with paranormal action sequences suddenly becomes all about spiritual and martial arts training in the mountains, and the strong personalities that powered the series so far take a back seat to this strangely misplaced plot twist. The show returns to its roots for the final two episodes, but this odd jarring in episodes 18-24 does its damage. In addition, several plot points brought up in the early part of the series never get fully resolved. (I'm not sure if the anime caught up to the manga and had to make do, or if it was hoping for a second season.) Neither of these are fatal flaws, but they sure aren't strengths.

With that said, would I recommend Moon Phase? Wholeheartedly! Moon Phase's flaws are more than compensated for by the fantastic and consistent characterization that this show pulls off throughout. Hazuki, Kouhei, and the others are all deeply flawed, even abrasive at times, but that just serves to set off the sweetness when it appears. They're also surprisingly deep, and everyone has motivations that are more complex (and sometimes conflicted) than you generally find with anime stereotypes. The viewer comes to care deeply about Hazuki, Kouhei, and the whole Mido family, and this series' ability to play on your heartstrings every single time is pretty special. This effect is a mixture of good work on a lot of different people's part, which brings me to my next point of praise...

Moon Phase has the best English dub of any anime I have ever watched, bar none. Monica Rial and Jason Liebrecht deserve special praise for bringing the star charactes to life, but EVERYONE - from major supporting cast to bit characters - did just a fantastic job, and totally bested their Japanese counterparts in this endeavor. Equally deserving of props here are the casting director (who did a stellar job assigning actor to appropriate character) and the translators/writers, who gave them lines to speak that kept the integrity of the original Japanese cultural references while making the dialogue itself sound like perfectly natural and colloquial English. It's exemplary work, and Moon Phase is now my new ""standard"" for dubs.

Lastly, the show itself has high production values that have aged very well. The animation is smooth; the artwork is colorful, detailed, and crisp; and the music complements the action onscreen beautifully. You'll see a little CG here and there, but it's very organic and doesn't draw attention to itself in a negative way. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the quirky opening theme, but the ending theme and its lyrics are beautiful.

All-in-all, Moon Phase is a definite recommend to those willing to invest some time into it. Its oddities might make it seem unpalatable at first, but if you'll invest a little time into it, I think you'll find it well-worth sinking your teeth into.",1391212800,,4987,4.921521997621879

This series was fun to watch. There are a lot of goofy and cute moments mixed with a lot of tension making it quite an exciting series.

I suggest having an open mind before watching this series though.

Likes

Music was very catchy if not just a little too cute.

Plot wasn't too serious but was interesting enough for anime.

Character were fun and likeable.  Humor was light and there were some pretty decent fights.

Dislike

Plot was resolved but left a few things loose in the end.

Not a great deal of fanservice but as it was made for TV I hadnt expected any at all.

Overall I would recommend this anime as fun and entertaining.",1358121600,,645,4.24793388429752

I was a little worried at first because it was a bit of a gamble dishing out $30 for a anime I wasn't even sure I would like, but it was a gamble that paid off. I really enjoyed this series because it actually got me to care about the characters. It seems to be a fantasy/comedy/drama with a bit of action mixed in. The first disc was mostly funny and lighthearted and then the series started to get more and more serious as the series progressed. Although it didn't lose sight of the comedic angle. There was just a bit less comedy as the story got more serious. It had me on the edge of my seat at around the 7th episode. I started watching at around 4:30 and didn't finish the series untill 7:00 A.M. I didn't plan on staying up that long, but I just had to see what happened next and before you know it, it had ended and the sun was coming up. I have to give Moon Phase credit, it takes a good show (or book) to make me stay up that late to finish it. I would definitely recommend Moon Phase to other anime lovers. It's made it into my top 5 list of shows.",1352592000,,1198,4.03781512605042

Hazuki and Kohei go to great lengths to get stronger and protect the happy life they have together.

This anime was a lot fun to watch. There are a lot of great gags and fun comedy. The silliness isn't too much, too mask the seriousness of the strong feelings they share. The animation is good and the voice acting is too. One of the unique things about this anime is the soundtrack. It has a lighthearted and playful vibe that suits the show perfectly. All in all this is a series I strongly recommend it to any anime fan.",1350345600,6,811,4.266233766233766
4705810,3,B005HVWW12,"Before bashing not helpful, hear me out.  I watch dozens of anime series each year and I love to buy the cheaper SAVE sets.  I loved Ghost Hunt, D Gray Man, Hellsing, and many other Occult themed anime series.  I also enjoy cutesey series such as Azumanga Daioh.  So you would think 1 + 1 = 2 yes?  Well it's more like 1 x 1 = 1.  The series is neither great as a cute vampire cat girl series or great as a serious Occult series.

Since the show switches from cute to serious so frequently, the viewer is often unable to really get a grasp of the tension or the comedy.  It's like someone showing you a picture of a dead body, then removing the picture and telling you an unrelated joke.  The other big issue I had was with the Dragon Ball style fighting between the Exorcists and the demons.  If you watch Ghost Hunt, the exorcisms are all carried out very well (until the last episode), no flying balls of exorcist fire or things like that.  Now don't get me wrong, that would be okay, but the show doesn't really seem to play well to that kind of action.  It gets hokey very quickly.

If you can watch through and enjoy the first three episodes, then it's worth buying.  Even if you are like me, and not completely impressed, $17 is not a lot of expense for 24 episodes.  You can watch them on Funimation's website for free (with commercials), so you might check out the first few.  I do recommend the Japanese audio track, though the dub is actually pretty good.  The subtitles annoy me since they don't match up neatly to the Japanese dialogue.  But only an issue because I know enough Japanese to get myself in trouble.  They do not have closed captions for the English dub.

Overall the series is cute, decently enjoyable, well animated, but just uneven.  If it had been more of a cute show without the intense Dragon Ball Z fighting, then I would have rated 4 stars.  I never really got to just relax into the series.

I recommend D Gray Man, Hellsing, xxxHolic, and Ghost Hunt for Occult themed series.
For something cute/serious check out Melancholy of Haruhi Suziyama.
For just silly cuteness check out Azumanga Daioh or School Rumble.",1346889600,15,2146,4.418367346938775

4705813,5,B005HVWW12,"Moon Phase is a great Anime and I'm going to give clarification to exactly why that is.

Firstly with this product, the Super Amazing Value Edition means a customer can get a complete Anime series for dirt cheap, perfect for the current economy. Their is one lone DVD case that looks like it would only hold one disc like most Movies released from Hollywood would come packaged. This one however has all 4 discs in the middle on two plastic page plates as if you are reading a book. An example of shelf space for a series like individual Trigun volumes on DVD, would take up to 8 spaces, whereas this take up a single space. Both are 26 episodes but this comes in a nice compact case.

Since this is the S.A.V.E. version, it is pretty inexpensive, but also lacks special features. Each disc has one trailer that automatically plays and textless songs are standard issue. It has all 26 episodes.

!!! [Spoilers]
The plot revolves around two main characters. Kohei, a spiritually dense Photographer, and Hazuki, a cute little Vampire girl. Kohei ends up seeing a girl by chance atop a haunted castle. Curiously he comes back later to investigate and ends up meeting Hazuki. She is trapped within this castle, like a prisoner. She pleads for someone to release her from this cage and tries to manipulate Kohei into helping her. The themes jump back and forth between Cute and Dark as the series progresses. While there is no graphic nudity, their is some convenient censoring in a few select scenes which could be viewed as Fanservice. A good example is a bubble bath where the protagonist, Hazuki acts in a precocious manner. While it may be a bit risque, it's not really as ""bad"" as you might think (in my opinion). Hazuki then gives Kohei a special ""kiss"" and then expects him to obey her every whim... but will he?
... [End Spoilers]

If you want more of a synopsis, I recommend checking a site called AnimeNewsNetwork or checking other reviews online. I usually try to avoid giving away too much information about the story or where it's going. Among the dark themes, there is a lot of cuteness mixed in and even some comedy during some scenes. It's a mix bag of goodness that I surely love and enjoy. I'm not too knowledgeable on it's commercial success, but I assume it did alright but was still overshadowed by the popular Anime like Naruto, Bleach, etc. So I would consider this to be a hidden gem of sorts for the Anime world with people that like this combination of story, themes, and so on. I found almost nothing to be predictable as the story progressed when I first saw some sample episodes on Funimation's youtube Channel.

As with most Anime in Region 1, this has two audio tracks: English and Japanese w/ English Subtitles. I give it a 5 out of 5 because of the price. An entire Anime series for dirt cheap. Less than a dollar an episode and to be owned on your own shelf, to watch anytime you desire!",1333670400,27,2917,4.538022813688213

Also, there is some moe (just look at her) so if you don't handle that too well, you might want to be careful with this one. The story's pacing is a bit slow. But the drama and romance makes it a bit entertaining at times.

And so, begins the unique adventures of this cute blood-sucker and a photographer that always ends up being involved with the paranormal.

- Analysis: This anime has an interesting blend of supernatural and some romance with bits of comedy. Likewise, it has some silly situations that make for some laughs and smile. Other times, when it becomes serious, can generate sympathy for some of the characters. For the most part, this is a simple anime that is a ""feel good"" kind of anime that might leaving you feel warm and fuzzy inside in a good way.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. A 26 episode, 4-disc set with a run-time of about 10.5 hours. Rated TV-PG for light fan-service and other suggestive dialogue.

- Conclusion: Overall, not a bad buy, especially coming from S.A.V.E. anime. They really do a good job making anime more inexpensive so we can buy more. Now if only anime figures were cheap like that...
