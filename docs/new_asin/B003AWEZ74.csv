4104800,2,B003AWEZ74,"This movie should have been given another title. There's little in the film about producing good art & copy. I expected to see passionate copywriters and art directors working on ads. I hoped to see some in depth reporting on the current trends in advertising such as advertising on the web. How about explaining techniques on how to get the attention of target audiences when there's so much competition for his attention?

In this film, there is little, if any, new information on the production of advertising, what the industry is like today and where it's heading. Instead, the film devotes much of its time to established stars in the industry who describe in detail successful campaigns they did 20 or 30 years ago. They go on saying that the 80's was a golden age for Advertising and how the work being produced today (along with the climate in ad agencies) is just awful. The advertising medium that the film opens and closes with is the billboard. The images of workers changing billboard ads tell you that this is not a film about cutting-edge 21st century advertising, but rather a film about conventional advertising techniques instead.

Listening to these guys go on about past victories nearly put me to sleep in the first hour of the film - a big irony since advertising is supposed to have the opposite effect. Watch it if you must, but don't expect to learn much about today's advertising. People entering the industry might benefit by seeing what kind of egomaniac their future boss might be.",1284681600,5,1511,4.78544061302682

4104803,3,B003AWEZ74,"""Art & Copy"" is a documentary about the advertising business that focuses on the icons who started in the 1960s and developed memorable ads throughout the next several decades.  These admen (and they are mostly men) present the stories behind some huge campaigns, including ""Got Milk?,"" Nike's ""Just do it,"" and Apple's ""1984,"" many of which were listed in Ad Age's top 100 ads.  Interspersed through the film are the commercials and ads being discussed, various factoids about the business, and a few interviews with regular people, such as a worker who sets up billboards.

I don't have any inherent interest in advertising, although I do tend to like documentaries of people talking about their jobs.  The behind-the-scenes peak at this creative process and some of the stories are definitely interesting.  As such, ""Art & Copy"" held my attention and was well produced and attractive.  However, after it ended, I didn't feel as though I had any new insight into the business.  I also noticed that mention of the effectiveness of the ads was mostly avoided, and no one discussed their unsuccessful campaigns (In fact, one adman proudly stated that he never thinks about his failures because once you do, then you become afraid).  Thus, at times, it felt a tad like an advertisement for the advertising business.  An enjoyable but not very deep examination of the biz.",1281830400,9,1369,4.969298245614035

4104805,4,B003AWEZ74,"Just rented this and found it very interesting.  Was interesting to hear the stories of some of the biggest ad campaigns (Got Milk, Where's the Beef, and Just Do It, for example)have came together.  Also great to see that there are advertising people that are aware of their power and actually think about what they're putting out.  And some of them had very cool offices, by the way.  :)

The one thing I would have liked this documentary to spend more time on is some of the failures that these guys have had.  Let's hear about those huge campaigns that didn't quite so do well, even when everybody else, all the testing and focus groups, said they would.  We got to hear about just the opposite, so that would have been a nice touch.

If you're a documentary fan, you'll like this one.  If you're into advertising, you'll like this one.  Some interesting characters and great stories about things that have become a big part of American culture.",1276905600,20,948,4.589285714285714

4104808,5,B003AWEZ74,"This film fascinated me.  It was incredibly revealing to 'meet' some of the people behind so many legendary ad campaigns that really shaped modern American advertising.  I found these people and their creative process, which is certainly overlooked on a daily basis, to be mezmorizing subjects.  Plus the film is just beautifully done, which makes a most enjoyable ride.",1273190400,2,370,5.237288135593221
4104809,3,B003AWEZ74,"With the success of the cable TV show Mad Men which centers around advertising agencies in the 1950s, there's a new interest in commercial ads. This PBS documentary tries to jump on the bandwagon and is fairly interesting. But like one of the six or eight ad execs who fill much of the screen time says : (I'm paraphrasing here) Why produce something ordinary when you can produce something GREAT? Modern agencies have figured out how to tell a story of a product in under 30 seconds, yet Director Doug Pray takes 89 minutes to tell a store he could have easily done in under an hour. Even with including snippets of lots of successful commercials  (the  1984 Apple Super Bowl commercial is one of the few shown in their entirety) its way too long. And there's lots of new computer generated graphics and photos of the exec's workspaces that really ad nothing but time.

The top names in the field (George Lois - the most honest and entertaining- Mary Wells, David Kennedy) are hear but you won't know who they are until you watch the bonus interviews. Why? Because their names and affiliations are shown in white on a lighy gray background that is virtually impossible to read.

Some print ads are shown and there are scenes of billboards being mounted. But wouldn't it have been interesting to learn something about the billboard business too? Or just leave out those scenes. There's just a lot of FILLER here and that's something good commercials - or good documentaries shouldn't have.

If you really want to know more about the advertising business, this DVD might help you some, but it may also put you to sleep a few times.

4104875,5,B003AWEZ74,"""Art and Copy,"" focuses on the power, struggle and dedication that the advertising business has been built for. After my second time watching this, I was left with the impression that advertising is a bigger industry than anyone could have imagined. We are bombarded with information on a daily basis, but how much of it do we retain?  The bigger the better, the riskier the more successful; branding can make or break a company.

I was disappointed in the fact that I knew so little about the power of advertising having been at an art school for four months. Teachers can teach you how to use pen tool in illustrator, how to depict the human form and how to form your conceptual ideas. But I think the real instruction lies in how to we make the public latch on to our ideas, our innovations and ultimately ourselves. It's all about advertising. Some say it dictates us; it forms our opinions for us. But that is exactly what we look for.

I highly recommend this documentary for anyone in the creative field; it provides an outlook like no other on the innovation behind advertising. ""Just Do It."" Just watch ""Art and Copy.""",1327795200,,1127,4.597014925373134

Every graphic designer and commercial creative should watch this film. Graphic design isn't about looking good, it's about communicating; a feeling, a message, a benefit, a service. The marriage of the designer with the copywriter was truly a pivotal part of the industry.

And it really is about the era (the mid-60s) depicted in the hit TV show Mad Men. And like the TV series, it's part love montage, part cautionary tale. The seductive part is the array of kookie and iconoclastic (and sometimes downright potty-mouthed) creatives who reminisce about some of the all-time most memorable ad campaigns they worked on. Nike's ""Just do it"" slogan, we're told, comes from Gary Gillmore's last words to his executioners. ""Where's the beef?"" was almost rejected by the client. (These real-life creatives can make Don Draper look downright deferential. No shortage of self-confidence here.) My favorite ad person was Mary Wells, the mastermind behind the Braniff airlines make-over. Trained as an actress, she felt a need to bring theater to the business of selling. For Braniff she redesigned the planes before even beginning work on the ads. And she wrangled Pucci into designing uniforms for the flight attendants (called stewardesses in the ads), complete with space bubble helmets! The cautionary elements of the film are more subtle. They consist of statistics displayed on the screen announcing the obscene amounts of money spent on advertizing, the number or ads the average unsuspecting citizen is exposed to daily, etc. In the end, it's a little sad (and scary) just how aspirational we consumers are. And how desperately we want to be sold something--anything--that will make us okay, complete. Behind the surface shimmer, this is a very profound film.",1305244800,4,1585,5.219607843137255
