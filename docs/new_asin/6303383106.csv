7845093,5,6303383106,"My 3 year old son absolutely loves this tape! It starts out with the hose Casey and some children taking her own cat, Dudette, to a vetrinarian. Children are given interesting facts about house cats and kittens and how to take care of them. Then she visits a big cat preserve where she talks to the owner/overseer Tippy. Tippy then introduces Casey to a tiger, lion, cheetah, leopard and an african cerval with interesting facts about each cat.  And through out the tape, there are several great catchy songs that Casey and the kids sing. My son dances and sings along with them. It is very cute and informative.",1125878400,,612,4.614678899082569
