2554667,5,B000F8J05S,"I saw this movie while a mere tyke. Great action scenes, and a sober reminder of what happens when edged weapons meet modern firearms in pitched battle. The reality is also a little off, as Western troops met Chinese mobs at arms length distances - bayonet vs sword and spear - and beat them down. Nonetheless, the performances in the movie are outstanding and the production values are first rate for its class.

The subtext is a little off, like many such movies, which are made from a parochial viewpoint to appeal to the local (Hong Kong and Taiwan) market. Specifically, the trigger for the European invasion - not covered onscreen - is that the Chinese fighters portrayed in the movie were part of a cult funded by the Chinese Empress Dowager that slaughtered and dismembered 40,000 Chinese Christians together with hundreds of missionaries and their families. These days, it is considered completely acceptable for non-Western countries to do this to any foreigners in-country. At the time, it was a cause for war. And the rest, of course, is history.",1190246400,7,1058,4.877777777777778
2554668,5,B000F8J05S,"I have to agree that this is one of Shaw brothers classic best. The movie has great cinematography. And the hundreds of people in this film, shaw spent some money to get this done. The fighting scenes are pretty realistic. One of the things about the movie is that the Princes is told that her boxers are winning the war, and that they have special boxers who are pugilists and they can stand against the foreign guns. As she believes this she sends out all of her best boxers to fight the foreigners. I won't say anymore but Alexander Fu Sheng and Chi Quan Chun are excellent in this film. Chi Quan Chun does an awesome Lung Fu Pai form in this film to die for. I studied this form many years ago and I took first place in a Kata tournament some years ago. This is one of my favorite Shaw brother classics. Get this one Today!",1189036800,4,827,4.2405063291139244

8118866,4,B000F8J05S,"DVD Review: Pertaining to the Bonzai Panmedia yaddi-yadda version. Ugh! I don't know why they can't just release the whole movie in it's Chinese audio with subs rather than mixing it up with English dubbing. What's worse is it's also in German and Japanese but I think that is actually part of the movie. I'm confused. The video transfer quality is good though not great and is on Widescreen. Overall I'm satisfied with the product in question.

Movie Review: The Boxer Rebellion is one of my favorite historical events to read about which is why I bought this movie. The problem is movies have almost zero abilities to retell a historical event accurately so I'm ****ed on that account. Anyways, this is one of Chang Cheh's highest production cost movies ever. And it's about the Boxer Rebellion and so forth. It's story is excellent and action is great although I sort of got confused towards the end of the movie when one Boxer guy was fighting the other one. I don't know. Maybe I wasn't paying any attention to the film at some point. *shruggs*

Conclusion: 4 1/2 stars for the movie and 3 1/2 stars for the DVD (PERSONAL OPINION!!!!).",1414627200,,1140,4.666666666666667

8118868,5,B000F8J05S,"Great action, great fight scenes, skillful actors.  The plots tend to always be the same (avenging a murdered master, rescuing a kidnapped girl, challenging a drug lord, etc.).  But I watch them for the great choreographed fight scenes.",1402185600,,236,5.184210526315789
8118869,4,B000F8J05S,"In the four decade career of the prolific Chang Cheh, he chose to stay in the realm of the wu xia/kung fu genre.  However, within that genre he would tackle different sub-genres; comedy (Magnificent Wanderers), horror (Weird Man), fantasy (Na Cha the Great), musical (Heaven and Hell), jiang hu (The Kid With the Golden Arm), mystery (The Five Venoms), modern-day (Chinatown Kid), period chivalry (Chang's speciality), and historical epic (this movie right here).

Yes, I'm a huge Chang Cheh fan so pardon the lack of impartiality.  If you're looking for historical accuracy about the boxer rebellion, look in an encyclopedia or google it.  If you want a bleak, uncompromising epic with good kung fu choreographed by the Pops Lau Kar-Leung, and a liberal dose of patriotism & brotherhood, well here ya go.  In the mid-seventies, Chang was making movies in Taiwan under his own Chang Film Co. label (which was affiliated/distributed by Shaw Brothers) starring Fu Sheng, Chi Kuan-Chun, Leung ""Beardie"" Kar-Yan, and Johnny Wang Lung-Wei.

""Boxer Rebellion"" (U.S. title ""The Bloody Avengers"") was made in 1975, and it definitely smacks of epic; tons of extras, plenty of foreign faces/costumes, and large exterior sets.  Also, this might be the longest film Chang has directed at 137 minutes.  There are numerous show-stopping moments; Beardie's last stand, the invasion of the Japanese fort, and the climatic fights involving Fu Sheng, Chi Kuan-Chun and Johnny Wang.  Eagle-eyed fans might catch Kuo Chui's three cameos ~ 1) a boxer who performs for the Emperess (portrayed by Li-Li Hua, who resembles Ava Gardner a bit), 2) a Japanese soldier Fu Sheng kills, 3) a deserting boxer Johnny Wang kicks in the throat toward the end.

Okay, it's clear I'm a fan, now for the quality of the DVD.  It's from Bonzai (like Red Sun, a bootleg but fairly reputable company.) The front cover read on the top ""digitally remastered and restored"", and it is.  Great picture, widescreen (Shawscope) and the full 137 minute version.  As with other Bonzai DVDs, so-so audio.  There's one audio track, and it switches back and forth between English and Mandarin, probably due to the fact that many of these scenes were not shown on the U.S. version.

Subtitles are present; the catch, they appear and stay there until a character says something else, get it?  Example, one character says a line, subtitle appears, and remains on the screen until another character follows up.  It's a minor distraction, but hey, for a guy that had to rely on an edited 90 minute version taped off of channel 5's ""Drive-In Movie"", this is almost like another movie.  It's obvious I'm a fan so I thought it was a great purchase.  Decide for yourself, but if you read my review and understood the points I was making, well, y'know.  Peace.",1400284800,,2797,4.9486081370449675
8118870,5,B000F8J05S,"This is one of the best Alexander Fu Sheng and Chi Kuan Chun film I have seen! Lots of hard hitting martial arts action! Explosive gunfire in a battle between Japanese Imperials, German Tyrants, and Chinese Rebels! The film is a Shaw Brothers classic, and any fan should own this one ASAP. It's a shame this film is not out on blu ray because it deserves the transfer it's one of the best! Shaw Brothers 4-life!",1393977600,,411,4.421052631578948
8118871,3,B000F8J05S,"While the movie overall is excellent there were a couple of problems with the copy One received.  I was that there were scenes where the language track switched back to the Chinese.  Most of the time the Chinese audio was accompanied by English Subtitles, however there were a couple of scenes where the Chinese audio was not accompanied by the English subtitles.  The movie was still watchable, despite that, but it did get a bit frustrating when there were no subtitles and you lose bits of the dialogue.  I have had similar issues with other films, so I hope the companies that are putting these out are aware of the problem and have addressed it.  I will probably be getting a replacement copy of this to see if the problem had been corrected.",1384646400,,747,4.586466165413534

A group of fearless Chinese patriots ward off European Incursionists armied with little more than fists and flailing feet. Kung-fu proves no match for fiirearms, but it does slow the enemy downa great deal. Alexander Fu-Sheng and Li Li-Hua play the principal rules in this great film.",1255910400,2,366,4.825396825396825
