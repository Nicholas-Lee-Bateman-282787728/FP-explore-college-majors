I find that the actress is too theatrical and 'over-the-top' and does not come across as convincing, but rather as someone having fun in the role, in particular the preaching sequences.  Certain things are not well explained, like why the mother was also charged in the conspiracy.  The trial scene was also greatly shortened.

Simplistic, mundane, aesthetically unpleasant, and a waste of good film describes this movie's strengths.  Too bad, too - Aimee Semple McPherson is such a compelling character of the early 20th century, and good biographies, both documentary and dramatization, are needed to tell this compelling story.  This, especially because from this story come many of the principled debates of today - religion, celebrity, public scandal and political power.",1211068800,6,613,5.364583333333333
3096943,5,B0012RLWRU,"I enjoyed this beautiful and compelling film which is based on the real life of a famous female evangelist in the 1920's.  Her controversial story is presented with honesty and heart.  It captures the conflict between her godly and human passions and explores her sincere desire to follow God's call as well as her desire to find personal happiness. She was able to attain great success in her ministry but not in her personal life. The film unveils some of the mystery and scandal that surrounded her ministry, life, and tragic death.
The talented cast was able to convincingly portray the many colorful characters in her life. The role of Aimee was played brilliantly with a full range of emotion and drama, as her ministry was often a mixture of church and Hollywood.  Creative imagery and symbolism were used effectively throughout the film and enhanced the fascinating story.
I think this film will challenge many misconceptions about the lives of those in public ministry. After all, they are only human like the rest of us. People tend to put those in spiritual leadership on a pedestal because they are charismatic or gifted. If they should fall from their pedestal, they are often harshly judged by the self-righteous instead of being lifted up into the arms of God's unconditional love and grace. I thought the ending of the film was touching and demonstrated God's love in a very powerful way.

3096968,4,B0012RLWRU,"Aimee Semple McPherson has yet to find her George C Scott.  Her personality is just to big to fit on the small screen especially within the confines of this particular movie.  The huge crowds she drew and tremendous amounts of effort that went into her healing services and charity work for millions of the great unwashed masses, are either in dialog or displayed in a period photograph.  She helped a lot of people.  Warehouse loads and stadium loads of people.  If one wants to try and get the length and breath of one of her tent revival meetings or illustrated sermons together with enthused packed crowds, think what epic Jackson, Cecil B. DeMille or maybe Spielberg could produce.

Nevertheless, the producers of this movie did good for the budget they were on.  The film gives a taste of everything.  For example, her relationship with her 1st, 2nd and third husbands are intriguing,  the sympathetic look at her relationship to her father was particularly touching, as well as the very last warm and fuzzy few seconds of the closing scene. Though the film photography leaves something to be desired, I found it sufficient for introducing us to Aime's astoundingly charismatic personality.

Critics and skeptics may try to frame her in the same category as some other modern televangelists. FAIL.  Milton Berle was known exaggerator who kissed and told and even told about women he never kissed.  But even if it were true, the mystery of assumed scandal draws countless individuals to this woman.  For many, the prospect of watching a furious routine of faith-healing, sermons, charity, and salvation replayed over and over for 40 years is just not that exciting to explore. Her missing 5 weeks keeps people guessing as to what unprovable erotic thing might have been actually going on. A life without rumored spice and some gaudy color might have otherwise submerged Aimee into the depths of basement library books.

3096970,1,B0012RLWRU,"I really wanted to like this film. My family were all members of the Foursquare Church for the first 16 years of my life and I'd heard the name ""Sister Aimee"" spoken lovingly and reverently more than I could possibly count. Even though I've long since moved on and away from my Pentecostal roots I still have a curious fascination for the churches founder and first minister, Aimee Semple McPherson.

While there have been several Hollywood films that have been to varying degrees loosely based on the life and exploits of this charismatic figure, the 1960 classic `Elmer Gantry' being the most memorable, nothing purely factional and of relative depth has yet to be presented. Thus when I came across the low budget, independent film `Sister Aimee: The Aimee Semple McPherson Story' I was more than willing to forego the usual expectations of what generally constitutes a good movie (production values, acting) in hopes of discovering an honest, intelligent, well told true life story of a fascinating 20th century icon.

I suppose the film did succeed on most levels mentioned in the previous paragraph, the story of Aimee McPherson is told in a straight forward, truthful fashion. However despite that admission my already low expectations of what to expect in terms of production values still couldn't prepare me for this movie. It was much worse than I had imagined it would be. The septitone coloring, interspersed scene descriptions, and twenties soundtrack didn't provide the anticipated nostalgic effect hoped for. Even worse, everything appears to have been filmed within the confines of one or two rooms. If the scene calls for a church simply hang a cross on the wall or if you've just arrived in China place a little statue of Buddha on the desk and you're there. See how easy it is? Ah..., the magic of cinema!

I could have overlooked all the negatives if the acting was acceptable and rang true. After all I went into this viewing already fascinated by the story of Aimee Semple McPherson so it wouldn't have taken much to win me over. Just give me an enjoyable. memorable performance and I'll go away happy. Well, unfortunately it didn't happen. The performances were flat, uninspired and forgettable.

I remember Aimee stepping through parted curtains on stage, dressed in a flowing, yellow, gossamer gown, a mammoth yellow picture hat perched on her head with ribbon trailing, gliding like a Hollywood star across the stage.  The congregation went wild.  She was a mesmerizing character.  Although I left the church decades ago, this horrible, terrible film is a shameful tribute to her memory.  It is so amateurish, acting is pitiful, sets are worse than that seen in a high school amateur play.....and to have the young woman ""playing"" Aimee lip-synching to an audio tape of one of Aimee's sermons is not only laughable but weirdly atrocious beyond belief.  Everyone associated with this film should be ashamed of themselves.  It reflects so poorly, not only on Aimee's legacy as one of the most famous celebrities of the 1930s, but the entire film-making industry.  A few seconds of remarkable, vintage black and white video, taken of the mobs at Angelus Temple and her gravesite during her funeral, make this film worth even barely watchable.",1493424000,,1220,4.9655172413793105
8247505,3,B0012RLWRU,"I've been reading and researching Sister Aimee for around six months now, and I wanted to get as many movies about her/concerning as I possibly could. I've already ordered and watch the American Experience episode featuring Sister (which is good by the way), and I just had to see this one.

I read the review read by this movie's director, Richard Rossi, and he built it up so much that I really did have high expectations. I was sadly let down. This movie is so obviously made on a shoe-string budget. I wouldn't be scared to guess that all the interiors here were shot in different rooms of the same building. There is no exterior to offer any sense of ""atmosphere"". We get no interior or exterior peak at Angelus Temple, or even Sister's congregations for that matter. What we get is mostly close ups that don't quite get all of the face inside interiors that are completely bland and not well lit by any means. Everything seems very rushed, especially the time spent on Sister's marriages. I would say each of her three marriages may get roughly 10 minutes of film a piece. None of the controversy surrounding Sister is really addressed, beyond her 1926 kidnapping saga that is. None of the controversy about separating herself from Classical Pentecostalism, her becoming more stylish (ex cutting her hair, wearing cosmetics, etc) or anything like that is addressed. The film looks grainy, and I'm not particularly fond of the sepia-tone filters, either.

In saying all that, this isn't a completely bad movie. As I understand it, the director turned down a lot of money to make a ""true"" movie about McPherson. He was supposedly offered millions to make a ""Hollywood biopic"" that would have glossed over Sister's tragedies and controversies. So I'm glad he didn't do that because then everything would have been watered down, with probably only the names of the people remaining the only 100% true thing about it all (although those might have been changed?). However, I wish they had raised more money to make this movie longer, more visually appealing, and just be better. The performances are decent, and I actually enjoyed Mimi Michaels' portrayal of Sister. She doesn't look or sound a whole lot like McPherson, but I felt her performance was solid and honest. As for the others, well, I guess they did well with what they had to work with at hand. Some of the performances are bit shaky, but that doesn't automatically make them bad; it just seems like the low budget didn't allow for many retakes. I get this feeling the actors were like ""Hey, we gotta get this right the first go 'round."" Maybe not, but anyhow.

In all reality I would give The Aimee Semple McPherson Story around two and-a-half stars, maybe three. It isn't a completely bad movie, but it isn't something that one would just die to tell someone about or want something you will want to watch over immediately. I wish HBO or even Lifetime for that matter would do I mini-series on Sister Aimee. Her life was so colorful that she deserves ""sections"" or ""chapters"" if you will to get the point across without a whole of holes in her story (which this film has a lot of). I don't really know if I would recommend this or not. I guess if you are interested in Sister Aimee this is the best bet as far as biopics go, although the American Experience is probably 45 mins shorter but more informative.

8247510,1,B0012RLWRU,"This is a very low-budget film with poor acting, lousy sound and a very spotty, slow storyline. Much of the early part of the script seems to be taken almost directly from Bahr's bio of Sister, LEAST OF ALL SAINTS. About 1/4 of the way into the film, the story jumps around, making it appear that Sister was an overnight sensation earning enough to build the multi-million dollar Angelus Temple, her own radio station, the huge parsonage and her school after preaching a short time when, in fact it took years of endless labor before she became rich and famous. Minnie Kennedy, her mother, played a vital and prominent role in Sister's entire life, but in this film, she plays a rather small role. James Kennedy, Sister's father, died before the infamous kidnapping trial, but in this film he comforts and advises her throughout the trial. Mimi Michaels is erratic in the role. She's very unconvincing most of the time, but at times she acts and sounds quite like the real Sister did. The makers of the film apparently couldn't decide if Sister was a self-deceiving, charismatic person, a complete fraud, or a force for good. I don't recommend this film. See the PBS documentary bio instead, or read one of the bios published about her life. She was quite the character!",1427241600,2,1270,4.725225225225225
