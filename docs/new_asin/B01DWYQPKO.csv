7725481,3,B01DWYQPKO,Great season. Good cover. Only advise i would give is to switch vtyas with monica. Vtyas was early jury boot who CBS doesn't like after Second Chance. Monica got 2nd place and was a HUGE part of the season. Maybe worth a buy if that changes,1460160000,,240,4.239130434782608
7725482,5,B01DWYQPKO,"After Nicaragua Survivor went through a pretty shady dark patch that I thought would spell the end of the show. An over-reliance on returnees and gimmicky twists, bad editing leading to predictable seasons where half the cast were invisible and too many obnoxious characters shoved down our throats in return. Things weren't looking bright for my favourite show with just Philippines being the bright spot of a pretty weak string of seasons.

When the idea for Blood vs. Water was announced I kinda wrote it off already, especially with the announcement of the return of the ill-fated Redemption Island twist. Luckily however, it managed to surprise me somewhat.

The returnees picked were a rather diverse bunch with some interesting choices of people I thought we'd never see again as opposed to the lacklustre bunch Cagayan gave us which was dominated by OTT loudmouths I never wanted on my screen again. Plus adding the whole family / friend dynamic added another interesting later into the game that allowed for more character development in stead of constant strategy talk that can become boring if you don't actually get to know the people.

The editing was a vast improvement and I feel like we really got to know every character even if they were less visible or important to the story. A trend that thankfully has been kept up since. Plus to top it all off we had a number of interesting and shocking headline moments that made things pretty exciting.

Overall, the season wasn't a real favourite of mine as it still had its fair share of problems. Things did get a little dull after the merge when the game descended into pretty much constant strategy talk rather than the balance we had before. But it was a nice step in the right direction for the show and ushered in a new age of much better Survivor I am very greatful for.

The only real complaint I have comes from the Survivor geek in me. Can we please keep some continuity with the covers and put the winner in the front centre? Plus can you please include the full titles as a bonus feature as this was the first season where it wasn't aired in the episodes? Those two things will make me a happy Survivor fan!",1460073600,5,2180,4.651948051948052

7725484,5,B01DWYQPKO,"Big risk pays off with a one-of-a-kind Survivor season, that's almost like a Survivor spin-off. Classic player like Gervase and Tina square are welcome faces, while newer stars like Vytas, Hayden and Ciera have strong season debuts. The Blu-Ray is very similar to the DVD release, with slight improvement in picture crispness.",1513987200,2,326,5.288461538461538
