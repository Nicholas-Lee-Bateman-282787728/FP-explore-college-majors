8712710,5,B00WAPPCRO,It's Tone It UP.  Of course I like it.  I also really like the intro music.  I wish they had some information on this music producer on this DVD.,1466380800,,145,3.9310344827586206
8712711,5,B00WAPPCRO,My girlfriends loves these. She's hotter than Karina and Katrina too so she didn't need to work out though.,1448323200,,107,4.684210526315789
8712712,5,B00WAPPCRO,"I love this new DVD. Pre-ordered it when they pre-released it with the new Bikini Series program and I use it almost every day! The Beach Ball and Carribean Kettlebell workouts are so great and are my new favorites! (Though all o the workouts really make you sweat, I could probably do without the String Bikini one.) I think this DVD is the best one yet- totally worth the money!!",1431907200,6,381,4.457142857142857
8712713,4,B00WAPPCRO,"I have the first 2 Tone It Up Beach Babe DVDs and this one is much better in my opinion! FYI this dvd is $37 so don't pay more to other sellers!

One of my biggest issues with the other dvds was the editing. On the first dvd when they would switch cameras the exercise moves wouldn't be in sync. On the second dvd you could see and hear cars in the background during some routines, and sometimes the camera work was shoddy. This one is much better, but on every workout you can see a few people walking or running on the beach behind them. For me it's very distracting! Sometimes they would switch to a wide angle where you could see people just on the edges of the frame, when they could have just zoomed in or switched cameras and you wouldn't have seen anyone. Other times people would pass right behind and they couldn't be edited out. I feel like if they were going to spend the money to fly a crew and equipment to Mexico why not pay for a private beach? This is a multi million dollar company, they can afford it. Seeing people in the background just brings the quality down in my opinion and that's why I'm rating it just 4 stars.

That aside I like the workouts on this dvd more than the others, although I haven't done all of them yet. I LOVE the Coconut Core & Booty workout (35 min). I've done it at least once a week in the month I've had this dvd and I'm sore every time. The Beach Ball workout (24 min), done with a yoga ball, is also really good. The Beach Bombshell workout (38 min) kills your arms, I've only done it once because it was so hard! The String Bikini workout (9 min) were you need a band was kind of meh for me because there were a lot of moves that could just be done with dumbbells. They have a free youtube video called ""Your String Bikini Workout"" that has a lot of the same moves plus some that can only be done with an resistance band so I feel it's better than the dvd workout.

The Beach Arms workout (16 min) is better than the other dvds, but it drives me crazy because Karena switches from one move to the next with no warning! Or she tells you after the fact. Some people are audio learners and need that verbal instruction prior to the next move so they can be prepared, which she doesn't do. This is the case in all her arms and yoga videos so I just can't do most of her solo workouts anymore. Her Stretch and Release routine (16 min) is doable for me because its not really a flow yoga sequence and she doesn't rush so I can actually enjoy the stretches.

There is also the Caribbean Kettlebell workout (33 min) and the Ultimate Booty Call HIIT workout (32 min) which I have not done yet.",1431216000,20,2635,4.1607843137254905
