3001767,4,B000XDDF4C,"I just bought this dvd off ebay.  The first thing I noticed is that it is really accurate, especially ""Time.""  THe instructor demonstrates the songs very well, with different camera angles and tabs.  THe instructor plays smoothly and fluidly.  Plus, he uses backing tracks to get the song completely.  He does play in real time, but it would benefit the viewer if a metronome lightly played to help keep time, especially on songs like TIme where a good part of the song is without drums.

The problem is, he doesn't take you step by step through the songs.  He gives you the basic chord shapes and scales to use in ""intro/lesson"" section, and then he takes off in the demonstration in real time with backing tracks.  I agree with the other review on here that gave it five stars- you will have to rewind A LOT to get the stuff down.

 If you have a mac or a laptop of a sort, use it to quickly rewind, or you could really benefit from dvd players with remotes that have a repeat A and B button: you can hit the repeat button (A-B) and then hit it again for a phrase and it will continuously play that part til you get it right.  Then move to the next phrase.

Overall, I think it is a good dvd to learn from.  It isn't great because there really isn't a lesson, but if you have the patience and the time and you like Pink Floyd, then get it.  Just be ready to rewind and be patient A LOT.",1268870400,4,1388,4.188679245283019

3001769,5,B000XDDF4C,"I bought this DVD and am very happy with it.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn these songs.  Here's my review:

PREREQUISITES: Before you buy this, remember that this is David Gilmour being taught on this DVD, so beginners will most likely struggle with a lot of this.  Know how to do bends, especially at the lower frets where you need a lot of finger strength (and calloses!). Also know quick hammer ons and pull-offs, feel comfortable moving up and down the neck, and also jumping frets quickly for chord changes.  I would recommend being comfortable with those before attempting this DVD, or at least be patient with yourself as you learn these parts.  :-)

PROS: (1) The instructor is both a very good player and as well a very good teacher. At the start of each song, he breaks down which keys the songs use and which chords you will be playing, and demonstrates how to play them, as well as move from one chord to the next.  He plays VERY cleanly and VERY smoothly, so its very easy to see what he is playing and also reassuring to know it's the right way to play it.  (2) Multiple camera angles.  For each song, you can choose different camera angles to watch: 3rd person view (like you are an audience member) or 1st person view (like you are the player).  All views are very clear and very close up, so its very easy to see what he is doing.  (3) TAB. No matter which view you choose, you can see the tab at the bottom. (4) Main guitar tracks and solos. He teaches all the main stuff, so you will learn both the main guitar tracks and all the solos as well. (5) Real arrangements! The instructor does not dumb down anything. He plays it as it is on the album -- whether easy or hard -- so you are learning the real parts, not some watered down arrangement.

CONS: (1) A few songs are left off this DVD: ""On the Run"", ""Great Gig in the Sky"" and the cut'n'paste intro ""Speak To Me"" (no big loss there).  The first two, OTR and GGITS, should have been included even if they are largely keyboard pieces, since there's still plenty of good guitar work in there.  (2) The instructor moves at real time thoughout the song, so you will definitely need to stop and replay many parts as you learn this.  I would highly recommend watching this on a computer DVD player, which usually has a progress bar that you can click on, and quickly and accurately go back to replay a part you are working on. With a conventional DVD player, you will need to frequently stop to rewind and it's not nearly as easy to replay specific sequences.  (3) Missing fills. While they give you the main guitar part as well as the solos, there are still fills and overdub pieces that are not included.  Not a biggie since you get the vast majority of guitar parts, but nonetheless they are missing.

That's about it.  Even with those couple cons, I still give this 5 stars and highly recommend it.  This DVD really has been a HUGE help for me in learning these songs, way above tabs alone.  And I hope they publish more DVDs for other Pink Floyd albums too.

QUICK NOTE: The reviewer that wrote the first review on this page apparently intended to write a review for the book/CD version and erroneously posted it for this DVD version.",1216771200,27,3239,4.370617696160267
3001770,2,B000XDDF4C,"The following is a review for the CD version of this item. I do not own the DVD version:

I am a big fan of PF and David Gilmour, and picked up this item with the intention of learning some of the guitar parts to the songs on this classic album. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the way this book is done. Unlike most other guitar tab books I have, it provides minimal information: just basic chords and the main guitar parts, but without the detail and additional guitar parts that one would might want to know. Also, ""The Great Gig in the Sky"" -- probably my favourite track on the whole album -- is completely missing!!!

There is a play-along CD, with a recorded version of the music without the guitar parts, so you can play along. That's hardly a big selling point, I think. Although this might be suitable for guitarists who are just beginning to play, I would recommend that everyone take a look instead at the version by Music Sales Corporation, also available at Amazon, entitled ""Pink Floyd: Dark Side of the Moon: Guitar Tablature Edition."" I have their version of ""Wish You Were Here"" and it is much, much better. It comes with photos, an interview, and all the guitar parts (multiple tab when more than 1 guitar is playing) and just more musical detail. I'm very happy with their versions, but not with this. Even if you're a beginner, eventually you're going to want more, and you'll end up getting the better edition anyway. So unless you really want the play along CD (and who wouldn't rather just play along to the actual CD?) go for that one.

Happy guitar playing!",1205625600,3,1596,4.534722222222222

It would also be nice to have a detailed look at the effects used and how to recreate those sounds. I know there is a lot of material online for that, but give this is an item you are paying for it would be nice if they included it.
I could be wrong but it would also be a nice bonus if there was a way to print out the tab. Again this is an item you are paying for, they could just include a pdf for you to print. How hard would that be?",1442275200,,606,3.8174603174603177

8228036,5,B000XDDF4C,"As I stated before on the title, it is just great as a complement of any other paper material (book-tabs), that one already owns...having said this, and on my reviews of other dvds on the same series and player (Doug Boduch), don't expect any kind of tutorial, it's just a performance, a very good one, by the way, that for me took away some doubts that I had , specially on the type of fingering used, and some questions on the timing. I started off on guitar with tab magazines, then with tab books, after that with the playalong series, and I topped it of with the dvds...pricey, but whose counting!!!! To wrap it off: buy it if you already know how to play the songs, and you wish  to polish them, or else skip it.",1367280000,,718,4.279411764705882

8228039,5,B000XDDF4C,"There's plenty to learn with this DVD. Tabs are quite helpful, especially when you are covering a very well known piece, and have multiple angles and the music to fill in anything that tab notation leaves out.

Another important feature -- if you select the second audio track (I'm using a MAC computer) you have a backing track to the songs with all the instruments without guitar. So this DVD takes you all the way to 'playing with the band' so to speak.

I couldn't find a way with MAC's DVD Player to slow it down AND hear the audio. There's likely software that could make that playback speed more flexible and loop a section.

I think a newbie might watch this and discover what they need to learn and come back to it when they are a little more adept with technique.

That particularly negative reviewer should definitely not be operating heavy machinery, like a computer keyboard - They could hurt someone. If he's a live guitar teacher, I hope this on-screen training or Youtube doesn't hurt him too much. On that point I can sympathize. How about making your own DVD, mate?

Anyway, if you're a learner like me, we're in a good place. If you have any experience with teaching DVDs like this you know whether using a DVD training like this works for you. I quite like the style and it gives me a whole lot of lesson anytime I want it for a comparatively minimal cost.

Regarding the positive reviews - I found them very clear and I agree. This is a first rate lesson DVD for those with some chops. And it's the classic Dark Side of the Moon. Yeah!

It's not as easy as taking a pill. You still have to play it. But if you love the music, it's a joy in the learning.",1339459200,3,1674,4.346153846153846
