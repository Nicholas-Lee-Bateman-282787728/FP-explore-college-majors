7850447,5,6303560075,Very interesting movie about doctors earning only around $20/month as interns and can't even take tips.  Doctor helps a man in a bar and dutifully declines to accept the huge sum offered him for his help.  But his life would turn around in a most unexpected way.,1505347200,,262,4.553191489361702
7850448,5,6303560075,I loved it!  The lines Joel utters about not discriminating against people who can't pay are very relevant to what is going on today.  Superb acting all around.  Lloyd Nolan was a standout.  Nice to know that the origins of Dr. Kildare was not a silly melodrama that it later became.,1498867200,,283,4.490196078431373

7850453,4,6303560075,"Interns Can't Take Money is the first of the Dr. Kildare series. It stars Joel McCrea as Dr. Kildare and Barbara Stanwyck as a woman who has lost her child. She had been involved with gangsters; her husband was unknowingly connected to them. When he died, he took her daughter away and after serving jail time for being associated with a gangster, she spent all her money and time searching. She becomes connected with Kildare through a burn the two become romantically involved. When Kildare recieves a large tip from a man whose life he illegally saved, Stanwyck begs to keep it, but Kildare could lose his job and refuses. Everything comes together in the end, but it is a bumpy road along the way.

The actors in this film are amazing and really help to fuel the story. In times, one feels as hopeless as the characters do. The story is melodramatic but thanks to the time in which it was made, it was done with class and style. It it easy to watch by any age.",1150848000,5,964,4.415730337078652
7850454,3,6303560075,"In this little offering from 1937, Joel McCrea plays Doctor Jimmie Kildare who helps ex-convict Stanwyck find her missing three year-old daughter.  Lloyd Nolan plays a gangster with a heart of gold whose life is saved by a crude operation performed by Kildare with the implements at hand in a barroom.  True to the film's title, the young Dr. Kildare won't accept payment for exercising his surgical skills.  Ridges, a not-so-nice gangster, is holding the daughter for both money and for Stanwyck herself.  When Ridges is shot, Kildare must once again operate in order to save his life: otherwise the whereabouts of the young girl will go unknown; there is the expected happy ending.  This Paramount picture was the first film to introduce Max Brand's fictional Dr. Kildare to the moviegoing public, he would later be played by Lew Ayres for M-G-M, and, for the 1960's television series, he was perhaps most successfully portrayed by Richard Chamberlain.",1032739200,7,954,5.050955414012739
