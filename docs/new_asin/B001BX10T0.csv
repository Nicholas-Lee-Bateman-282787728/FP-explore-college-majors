3499731,5,B001BX10T0,"This video portrays the essence of Juliette de Bairacli Levy in all her glory. Viewing this video imparts one with the peace and beauty through which the late great Juliette saw and lived her life.

It leaves you wanting more. Worth watching over and over again.

She was/is a great teacher as she lived in harmony with life around her.",1254700800,4,336,4.583333333333333
3499732,5,B001BX10T0,"Love this dvd.
Nicely done documentary on the life of herbalist Juliette Bairacli de Levi.
Shows pictures of her life in the past with the gypsies, her home and gardens on the island now (before she moved), and interviews with her from recent times.
Sadly she is no longer with us, but this is a great dvd of her life, love of herbs, and useful information on the use of herbs in healing.
Well worth it....wish it was even longer.",1250812800,9,430,4.3875
3499733,5,B001BX10T0,I got to view Juliet of the Herbs at a book signing and actually got to meet Juliet in person.  It was awe inspiring to have her right there in my shop!  I was entranced with all the knowledge that she has.  The movie was fantastic.  Well done!,1097107200,21,244,4.020833333333333
3499734,5,B001BX10T0,"This CD is a treasure, as is/was Juliette.  Only other than Amazon copies are available so I knew it would be 2nd hand, however was still disappointed that it stalled right in the beginning.  I cleaned it as best I could and was able to see it throughout.  Hope it does not fail in future as it's a movie I hope to view many times.  It did arrive promptly.",1371081600,,356,4.115942028985507
3499735,4,B001BX10T0,Neat to actually get to see Juliette in the video and listen to her talk and her life story.  I was hopeful that it would show her harvesting several different types of herbs and also working with them in her kitchen.,1358294400,,217,4.2926829268292686
3499736,5,B001BX10T0,"I had seen this film before, borrowed from a friend, so I bought it. Juliette de Bairacli Levy wrote numerous books, particularly on the healing of animals. She was a person who lived a semi-nomadic life, and cared for animals and nature. When she wanted to learn about natural healing, she went to the gypsies. This film is about her life. She walks through most of it, talking about her ideas and experiences. She was a kind and gentle soul. But it was made when she was an old woman, about to leave her beloved home in Greece, and she died shortly after it was filmed, so I was grateful that this lovely film was made at all.",1355097600,8,628,4.330508474576271
3499737,4,B001BX10T0,"The production values of this documentary are a little basic, but this is the story of a loving, and much loved woman whose life was a little rough around the edges. Juliette de Bairacli Levy's inspirational life as a herbalist and animal healer is summed up rather briefly in this documentary (a mere 75 minutes), and it feels like there is much more to be told about the life of this beautiful person.
If I feel a bit disheartened or directionless, watching this woman's motivational story turns me around very quickly. Juliette's story and spirit serve as a guiding light, a reminder to live sustainably and be more connected with nature and the animals.",1335744000,9,657,4.771929824561403
3499738,5,B001BX10T0,This is a touching and inspirational  story of a woman who lives simply and with nature. It is the 4th copy I have bought; I have distributed them all over the world. I love her and her life.,1329350400,,191,4.026315789473684

3499742,5,B001BX10T0,I loved this DVD.  I have watched it over and over and catch something different everytime.  Juliette was such a naturalist. The DVD is mostly narrated by Juliette.

3499743,5,B001BX10T0,"This video was made by Juliette's friend and former student.  It is beautifully done by Rosemary Gladstar, who obviously loved and respected her.  Juliette has passed on, but she's still among us through her work and her students, who are now our teachers.  Thank you, Rosemary.",1266364800,7,278,5.0

8285023,5,B001BX10T0,"Love this! 9/10.  A person the average 'Ego' would not take the time to listen to, But the lady has had years of experience restoring people, and animals, and lands, to a more healthy position in life, using Natural things of the planet. She loves plants and her beautiful Afghan dogs.  Her story is a 'Must See' either the DVD or books, is relevant for today. I believe lots of Health conscious people should take the effort to see Juliette's books or the Amazon's DVD.  - resco, Australia",1399507200,4,490,4.545454545454546
8285024,5,B001BX10T0,"Being an ""herbalist"" myself, Juliette's de Bairclay Levy's books have been a guide to me ever since I first learned of her and her amazing life.  This DVD is the ""cherry"" on top of a delicious chocolate Sunday.  She was an amazing woman, who left a world wide legacy, which is somewhat captured on this beautiful DVD!  Not enough good things could be said about both her and this film which tries to tell her amazing story!  It's difficult to ""flaten out"" a genuinely inspiring person's life into film, but this is a great effort.  What a legacy for all involved!
