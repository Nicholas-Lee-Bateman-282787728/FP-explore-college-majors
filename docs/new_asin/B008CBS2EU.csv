Red Sundown is a 1950's Western directed by Jack Arnold, who grownup kids will know from some of his 1950's films: Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), It Came from Outer Space (1953), and The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957).

I love the song at the end and start, ""Red Sundown"", it's one of those catchy Western title songs or ballads popular in 1950's Westerns, it also reminded me of the song in ""5 Card Stud"" (1968) sung by and staring Dean Martin.

I liked the old color in this film. Rory Calhoun (who did all sorts of stuff including film noir and Westerns) is the main guy here, he's a bit weak as an actor, playing a gunfighter and the main protagonist. Some fight gets started in a bar over a table and then the guys hunt him and his friend. They find them at some shack, whereby his friend saves him by burying him in an absurd scene. The shack gets burnt but he survives. He goes to a small town, where he gets hired by the local sheriff as his deputy. The sheriff Jade Murphy is played by Dean Jagger who was a familiar face in 1950's films. The fight between squatters and some cattle baron ensues with the sheriff and his deputy trying to sort it all out. Throw in some young lady, who is the sheriff's daughter.

I did notice Lee Van Cleef in a flashback, which was uncredited. Director Jack Arnold may have used stock footage of his many films. Also, look for a young, unrecognizable Grant Williams from the fun ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (1957).

I think there's too much dialogue in this one, yet the film is a bit above average, just barely. That's because it has decent direction, good production values, and capable acting. It isn't great, but still something to watch for Western film lovers.",1460764800,,1763,4.479750778816199

8526762,4,B008CBS2EU,"A few things to note quickly. This is a Pal format region 0 DVD. Most blue ray players will play it no problem. Older, regular DVD players handling NTSC only ,will not. The menus as well for the movie are all in Spanish as is the DVD case. Don't let that bother you it's pretty straight forward but you will have to select English on the Menu or else it will play dubbed in Spanish with Spanish subs. There are other choices where you can have French Subs. as well should you desire. Rory Calhoun is really at his best in Red Sundown or Muerte al Atardecer if you prefer. Alex Longmire (Rory C) has a life altering experience that moves him away from his past as a gunfighter. Still ,while changed and continuing the evolution he finds himself funneled into a  job as Deputy to the Sheriff (Dean Jagger). Standard dispute between 2 parties over property and rights ensues. Our two heroes have to keep the peace as chaos breaks loose. Martha Hyer is the smoking hot daughter of the Sheriff and Lita Baron ( also smoking hot) plays Maria the housekeeper  who while working for the evil head honcho, looks out for Alex. Other things you should know about Red sundown is it has a sensational theme song ( I must have played it back dozens of times), check it out !. Also back to the DVD aside from the options to play the DVD and scene selections there are not really any special features on this disc. From me you get a 4 star rating, Rory Calhoun never disappoints & when he plays the good guy rather then the baddie it seems to elevate his performance even more, 5 stars for him. The conflict displayed in this movie though never seems to get resolved and there are other loose ends that also are very evident. It was like watching part 1 of a 2 part movie. Based on that the movie gets a 3. So a 4 seems about right, though I must confess I am a big Rory Calhoun fan.",1399334400,,1867,4.271186440677966
8526763,4,B008CBS2EU,"When his companion (James Millican) is killed in a shoot out, a gunfighter (Rory Calhoun) keeps his promise to him that he would abandon that life and settle down to honest work. But in a new town, he finds the only job open to him is that of a deputy to the sheriff (Dean Jagger). But will he be able to live down his past? The director Jack Arnold is justifiably noted for his fine work in the sci-fi genre with films like CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN and IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE. But he also made some excellent if minor westerns, notably NO NAME ON THE BULLET, MAN IN THE SHADOW and this ""B"" western which while simply done, provides a strong introspection at a lifestyle without the pat summary. The male characters are nicely drawn especially Grant Williams who gives a finely etched portrayal of a cold blooded gunman. Alas, the women don't fare as well, more stereotypes (Martha Hyer's prim daughter, Lita Baron's hot Mexican with a past) than anything else. A definite find for western buffs. With Robert Middleton, Leo Gordon and John Doucette.

The DVD from Spain via Llamentol is a handsome anamorphic wide screen (2:00) with both English and Spanish language tracks and optional Spanish subtitles.",1355184000,2,1239,4.736111111111111
