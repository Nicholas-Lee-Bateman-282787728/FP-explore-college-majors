7093039,5,B00VKMUUA2,"I was almost kept away from watching this because it's received such harsh reviews. I am glad I ignored them. So, yes, this is visually stunning, but what critics seem to be saying is that's where it ends  the rest does not hold together. I disagree. I think this is just immensely subtle. It's a rare film where it requires of its viewers they be still and quiet, open and receptive, even contemplative. I found myself very drawn in, and I also felt myself very much identifying with Franco's character, Tomas. And I cared very much about him and about Kate and Christopher, especially. And I believe Roger Ebert always said that if you can see yourself in the characters, if you find yourself caring about them, if you are engaged and swept up by this film as Wenders intended with its gloomy, sad, deep visual texture, then it does have something important to say. In many ways it could be characterized as having symbolic moments, and that's fine. And Wenders' use of 3D is very different from, say, a Michael Bay movie, and that's not bad at all! I would recommend this to anyone who needs a quiet respite and will give the film such attention. It might even ask something of yourself you need to address.",1451520000,13,1210,4.5504587155963305
7093040,5,B00VKMUUA2,"Wim Winders has created so many fine films  Wings of Desire, The Salt of the Earth, Buena Vista Social Club, Pina, Paris Texas, etc  that it is a pleasure to watch his unique cinematic language again. Based on a story written for the screen by Bjrn Olaf Johannessen EVERY THING WILL BE FINE is a series of moments of reflection about the impact of an incident on the lives of characters over the course of around twelve years. It is not an action movie, it is instead a film of contemplation that digs deeply into the human psyches of all the characters in the story  and in many ways shows that every thing will not be fine after all.

Filmed in Montral, Qubec, Canada, the film opens during the frozen winter that surrounds a young writer Tomas Edan (James Franco) living in a tiny cabin attempting to come up with ideas for his third novel. He is at odds with his girlfriend Sara (Rachel McAdams) and while driving aimlessly after a quarrel her, he accidentally runs over and kills a child. The one child he sees is basically unharmed and he walks the child Christopher (Jack Fulton) home to his mother Kate (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who, while happy to see Christopher, runs to the scene of the accident to find her other son is under Tomas car, dead. The accident and its aftermath deeply traumatizes Tomas. Over the next 12 years, he struggles to make sense of what happened and continue on with life, becoming a very successful writer who marries Ann (Marie-Jose Croze), but when he looks in the mirror, he sees a murderer. Christopher (Robert Naylor) confronts Tomas about the accident years later and we are privy to see how even at that stage in Tomas life the incident has bored into his soul.

The film quite successfully shares the trauma an accident can have on all who are connected with the perpetrator  but none more damaged that the man responsible. The photography, both in winter and all seasons, is by Benot Debie and the luminous musical score is by Alexandre Desplat. The cast is first class with James Franco probing deeply into a character so damaged it is difficult to imagine. Not a film for those seeking entertainment, but for those who enjoy films of beauty and philosophy, this Winders wonder is richly rewarding. Grady Harp, December 13",1451347200,5,2265,4.65
7093041,1,B00VKMUUA2,Small snippets of insignificant info attempting to piece together into a story line. Broken accents of unfamiliar origins for the female roles combined  with James Franco Americanism is a far stretch to any attempt of significance.  Love Franco but this movie should have remained on the cutting room floor.,1451001600,5,307,5.244897959183674
7093042,1,B00VKMUUA2,Boring & slow. One of the worst movies I've seen this year.,1450828800,5,59,4.0
7093043,5,B00VKMUUA2,"The strength for me was in the excellent and lingering photography of the settings and characters. I saw it as visual poetry where much was going on beneath the surface of the images and dialogue. As with many good poems the reader has to work a LOT to connect to the poet's mind and feelings. Yet a poem can be haunting before much is clear about its depths. So this is decidedly not for everyone.

The Franco character is mysterious in that his inner self is largely hidden behind cliche conversations, and emotionally unavailable relationships. He has a difficult time with real ordinary life, but there is a brilliant mind inside that we never really see. Rather we see his brooding struggle. It seems rather ""stereotypically Scandinavian"" or Northern European in that regard, and reminded me just a bit of Bergman, though the setting was clearly French-Quebec.

There is a lot that begs the viewer to ponder about how different people cope with life and the burdens they might carry whether they are struggling or successful by ordinary standards.

I found the conclusion quite moving and thought-provoking though by no means dramatic by ordinary standards. It got to me personally, as poems do get to one personally. But their punch fades and much is lost when you try to translate them in prose. So I won't say what I think was going on, though I could write a long essay speculating and putting the pieces together. I think the film-makes wanted to leave it open to personal thoughts, feelings, and interpretations and I don't want to violate that.",1450828800,5,1556,4.798507462686567
7093044,5,B00VKMUUA2,"Many call this film dark and the main character Tomas, self absorbed. The reality here is that everyone handles catastrophic events differently and this film shows it from this character's perspective. He is a regular guy with his own foibles, which you may or may not agree with.  Mr Franco handles it perfectly as a man who lets his instincts guide him.

The main characters are Tomas (played by Franco) along with a boy and his mother who live with their dog in a remote location.  A tragic  accident occurs on a snowy road. Piles of snow block full view of the surroundings (sometimes the deck is stacked against you). The brother's reaction is curious. Tomas is a writer who's skill and success improve after  the accident. There are various love interests who get caught up in the story, and bitterness ensues about the life choices Tomas's makes. A carnival scene gave me a sense of dread (rightfully so). The ending is a redeeming factor.

The soundtrack is reminiscent of Bernard Hermann's score for 'Psycho' during most of the film.

Mr Franco's presence often has you watching just for the sake of watching him! Like Brando, Clift et al before him, his presence hovers large over the film (which was a bit of fun in a very serious film.)

This film was shot in 3-D and I was hoping my first viewing would be in that format.  Since Amazon had it as 'rental only' in regular ol' HD, well I took what I could get.  As a 3-D TV owner I hope this film is eventually released as a 3-D Blu-ray Disc.  I bet that a lot more of Director Wim Wenders true intentions will come to light with the expanded visuals that we are missing.",1450569600,9,1632,4.47972972972973
7093045,1,B00VKMUUA2,"Yes it was so depressing, I fell asleep about 10 times.  I know there must be glaciers,( especially with global warming) that move faster, and with a bit more ""verve"".

And, yes, James Franco got the perfect part.  A character who holds all his emotions in?  Man, give me that role!! I can hold emotions in and plod around locations. ""Have Antidepressants. Will Travel""

WAY better than Seconal for insomnia!",1450569600,3,408,4.771428571428571
7093046,5,B00VKMUUA2,"I thought that although this is a dark and sometimes very depressing film, that it still had moments of depth, sensitivity and beauty. I disagree with the other reviewer who thought that the main character, Tomas (played superbly by James Franco) was just ruthless and narcissistic. I just felt like he was a person who didn't show his emotions, easily, especially after the accident. If he had been so ruthless, the scene with the mother of the boy never would've occurred nor the ending, which i thought was just what Christopher had been needing from Tomas's character.
This is a dark film, no doubt about that, but I thought it was well worth watching.",1450310400,12,656,4.7631578947368425

Fortunately, a kind friend intervened and allayed my fears by explaining that after countless years of ""WBF"" (watching bad films) he had finally developed (no doubt like myself) the kind of ""ISM"" (involuntary selective memory) that weeds out the chaff from the seed (so to speak).",1473206400,,566,5.086021505376344
