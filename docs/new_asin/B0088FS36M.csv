5140700,5,B0088FS36M,I like Phillip Coppens and his writing. I feel he investigates his subjects and puts them in a concise format. I would recommend his books and also his videos.,1380844800,2,159,4.517241379310345
5140701,4,B0088FS36M,"My favorite part of this video was the Crystal Skull stuff. It's basically an ancient nuclear blast that happened in the Sinai Desert. Trippy. While it would be great if everything current science and history told us is the whole story, it most certainly is not. Obviously there is and was a lot more going on in this world than we know.",1368921600,,337,4.451612903225806

5140703,5,B0088FS36M,"contains no hollywood-style claims that are too far fetched to believe. the research is well-done and well-informed. the video progresses logically and is easy to follow. the author uses a variety of sources from science, archeology, and history to support his claim, that extraterrestrials have visited various human civilizations at various times to pass on knowledge/ science to our ancestors to help advance human civilization.",1361923200,4,431,5.6461538461538465
5140704,2,B0088FS36M,"okay needed more punch about ancient aliens not enough visual graphics, reinactments, or demos to much narrations it could use actual locations for interest.",1356566400,,157,5.583333333333333
5140705,5,B0088FS36M,"Anything from Philip Coppens is great. He's an amazing individual, great speaker and a very intelligent sentient being. He really knows his stuff! :)",1356220800,,149,5.25
5140706,2,B0088FS36M,"As a long-time fan of the hit series Ancient Aliens, I was hoping that this documentary would live up to the quality and thought-provoking material that AA currently presents.

NOPE.

I'm sure several people purchase this film solely based on the familiar face of Philip Coppens in hopes that this program will resemble Ancient Aliens.

NOPE.

Ancient Aliens star; Philip Coppens virtually provides no new theories or evidence that isn't already covered in Ancient Aliens.  The production is quite poor and there are definitely no attention-grabbers.  Keeping yourself awake during this film should be a personal achievement.  This 70-minute snooze fest is plain and flat.  The material is quite vague and never gets more in-depth than just being theories.  There are several topics that are featured in this documentary, but all lack the definitive hard-hitting counterpoints to conventional human evolution explainations.

The study of ancient extraterrestrial contacts is rapidly becoming a mainstream fascination, but is being pursued by independent theorists without serious scientific backing.  We understand that everyone has their own opinion on what really happened during our remote past, but programs like this are not much help.

For hardcore Ancient Aliens fans, stick with the real thing, this is a poor substitution.",1349308800,23,1331,5.502463054187192
5140707,1,B0088FS36M,"This is NOT related to the Ancient Aliens TV series, and this is NOT good! It offers nothing new. Get the Ancient Aliens TV series on DVD's (or stream it) and watch all of the newer episodes on the History Channel. It's one of the best shows on TV and will give you WAY more interesting and entertaining information about ancient alien theory!",1348272000,10,343,4.4603174603174605
5140708,5,B0088FS36M,"This was one of the better documentaries I have seen on the subject, highly recommend! I have seen most documentaries out there & this is one of the better ones for sure.",1344211200,2,170,4.34375
5140709,3,B0088FS36M,"Philip Coppens takes us through the evidence of previous alien visitations.  From the pyramids, both in Egypt and in the Americas, to formations on the ground that can only be seen from the air, there's plenty to wonder about here.  Add to that the worldwide myths, which feature visitors of similar description, and it's all very compelling.  Just the technology of moving large stones seems impossible without outside help, since this technical capability has only been possible recently with large machines.  In particular I was fascinated by the Crystal Skull story, which I'd never heard before and early evidence of a nuclear blast in the middle of the Sinai Desert.  It's a straight-forward presentation, nothing fancy, and much of the visual material is nicely presented.  If you find this sort of thing sparks your imagination, you're in for a treat.",1341878400,6,859,5.1
8526098,5,B0088FS36M,"This video has been a favorite of mine since I first saw it. Phillips Coppens  work here is quality and  will be a worthy addition for or gift to any student of the Ancient Astronaut mystery.

8526101,3,B0088FS36M,"Good video, but very dry and never seems to really get to the point. Try and find it on Netflix or stream it some other way.",1415836800,,124,3.8076923076923075
