8098003,5,B000CDZP7I,"I took this video course for my college degree, it required watching all thirteen episodes and then taking a CLEP exam for 6 Upper level undergrad credits.  I had hoped that it would be released on DVD but the VHS tapes are all I have found, and then only at the local library and their original copies are getting a very worn. The 13 parts were taped in 1988, and have been shown on PBS several times.  The episodes are:
1. Dawn
2. The Weapon Of Choice
3. Bigger Bang For The Buck
4. Europe Goes Nuclear
5. At The Brink
6. THe Education of Robert McNamara
7. One Step Forward
8. The Haves And Have-Nots
9. Carter's New World
10. Zero Hour
11. Missile Experimental
12. Reagan's Shield
13. Visions Of War And Peace",1516406400,,713,4.274074074074074
8098004,5,B000CDZP7I,"This was the most interesting and balanced documentary explaining politics during that period of history I have ever seen. It was such an excellent series and so many interesting facts were presented for the first (and only) time. I have called companies and distributors in the US and England and it is so frustrating that because of different ""licensing"" laws, the series will never be available for sale or be shown again.... It just doesn't make any sense to me.
Anyway, if anyone has the 9 part series on VHS tape, I would pay a great deal to make a copy. I used to have a copy, but I donated it to the public library. Later, I found out the Library ""sold"" many of my collectable books and tape sets at one of their sales....
Anyway, if anyone knows where I can get a copy of this, I'd be very grateful...",1382140800,,810,4.370860927152318
8098005,5,B000CDZP7I,"I too, give this production five stars and agree with the previous two reviewers that this production needs to be made available on DVD.  However, after considering the primary reason to reissue it (to educate the present and upcoming generations of the nuclear madness that gripped the Free World and former Communist Russia/Soviet Union and to teach them to continue efforts at arms reduction) there are some realistic reasons that I believe that will not happen, and these are as follows:

1.  The subject is one that is sobering, not uplifting, nor entertaining to the vast majority of audiences, and appeals only to a very small minority of viewers.  Though it is important that everyone learn about this dark aspect of modern history, reissuance of this series, I feel, would be doomed as a money loser.  The producers make it clear in their advertisement of the accompanying book to the series that it is a college-level course.  Purchasers of this production, which runs for thirteen hours, would want to be educated, uplifted, and entertained, with only the first of these three criteria being met.  In comparison, past PBS series, such as those produced by Ken Burns on the Civil War and World War II, provide a human interest element in both of these productions.  War and Peace in the Nuclear Age does not.

2.  The production is now over twenty years old (as of my writing), and is in drastic need of an update.  At least an additional two, if not three episodes, need to be produced to cover  a) the fall of the Soviet Union, its satellite nations, and how the nuclear weapons issue was dealt with by the former Soviet Republics that found themselves in possession of nuclear bombs left behind by the former Soviet state;  b) further development of the topic of Islamic nuclear weaponry, particularly that of the nuclear standoff between India and Pakistan;  c) nuclear terrorism and how the events of 9/11 have reshaped how the world now deals with this;  d) the emergence of China as a world power; and  e) an update on the current status of strategic nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia.  Those are topics that need to be covered at a minimum.

3.  Attendant to the issue of no. 2, are the costs involved in producing update episodes.  I'm sure that the producers realized that when they made the series, it would shortly become outdated.  It's quite possible that in their wildest dreams, they would not have been able to realize that the majority of events I describe in no. 2 could have happened.  I saw somewhere that the original production as produced in the late 1980's cost somewhere in the range of $6-7 million dollars.  Costs to produce updates to cover the last 20-plus years would probably cost that much.  Considering the current economic situation, I'm sure that the producers would not want to risk spending that kind of money to produce updates, much less bring the original production out on DVD.

In conclusion, I believe we will have to satisfy ourselves with our VHS tapes of the series as is.",1247097600,,3048,4.770992366412214
8098006,5,B000CDZP7I,"I hope the producers of this TV series - WAR & PEACE IN THE NUCLEAR AGE, by popular demand will produce a DVD for nuclear war buffs,  like myself and others,  all over the world. There is also a companion book: THE NUCLEAR AGE by John New House.

The TV series were aired on PBS in the early 1900s  and received favorable  acclaim  from the viewing public all over North America. So let us have it this time in the form of a convenient DVD for education of our  youngsters that nuclear war would be mutually assured destruction to any country which resorts  to the first use of nuclear weapons. Eventually the whole world would be embroiled in the nuclear holocaust for which there are no winners or losers.

It had been estimated in a nuclear exchange between members of the Nuclear Club - United States, England, France, Russia, China, Israel, Indian & Pakistan, more than 300 - 500 million would die of acute radiation and those after for the next six months.

I hope my review will attract the producer of this program to give us the DVD soon. Thanks.",1157414400,5,1055,4.476439790575916
8098007,5,B000CDZP7I,"This 9-part documentary first aired on PBS back in 1990. In fact, I think that is the only time it was ever shown.

If this film ever becomes available on DVD, BUY IT !!

""War and Peace in the Nuclear Age"" is the best single film record of the central role of ""the Bomb"" in US and Russian war planning ever made.

Produced by the Annenberg/CPB Project, there was a book written by John Newhouse by the same name. I hope and pray that one day the producers will decide to release this film on DVD.",1147305600,6,496,4.145833333333333
