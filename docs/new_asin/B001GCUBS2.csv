3607123,4,B001GCUBS2,"Fun for adults and superb convincing acting to boot. Billie Piper is a joy to watch, and a truly wonderfull modern actress who has made the series her own, just as Sean Connery made Bond his. I am looking foreward to more of her fun and frolics.",1235865600,,245,4.23404255319149
3607124,5,B001GCUBS2,This falls into place in a long line of successful and innovative Showtime shows. Nothing about this show is gratuitous. It is an honest look at life in the high class escort business. I couldn't dream these scenarios up! It is based on a blog and novel by Belle Du Jour. I can't wait to find out what 2nd season brings. TIVO this!,1235692800,,331,4.26984126984127
3607125,5,B001GCUBS2,"This series may be the best and cheapest series available. What great fun to watch as some of the most histerical scenes are presented. It is well written, acted and filmed. All of the characters are so well done. Even the madam is funny.  Grownup fun for all.",1235001600,,260,4.416666666666667
3607126,4,B001GCUBS2,"The smart films and tv shows about sex workers realize and narratively utilize that there is a vast difference between a high class escort and say, someone you would pick up in the seedy part of town.  It's like comparing a wealthy corporate lawyer to a struggling independent--similar enough, yet drastically different lifestyle/daily life.  This show acknowledges that aspect from the start--quite literally in a voice over--and is about a high class escort who goes by ""Belle.""  (It's based, though I'm not sure how closely, on the memoirs/blog of an actual London escort.)

Like most media about ""courtesans"" it tends to over-glamourize its material and is to an extent the traditional ""happy hooker story,"" but it counter-balances that and partially justifies itself by developing an interesting, fairly well-developed protagonist--one who enjoys the money and the sex, but finds some inner conflict in leading a double life, dealing with various issues, etc.  The most interesting parts of the show to me were the exploration of this duality/lifestyle, though for those of you also interested in its sexual content--there is plenty of that as well.  I find the show quite addicting and very fast paced.  i also am not usually a fan of british humor (i just usually don't ""get it"") but i find the show funny and the drama is balanced well (strong enough to be interesting, but not overwhelming in balance with the show's comedy--it's ""drama-lite."")

I did want to say one last thing, about the DVD picture quality which someone said was a very poor treatment/transfer.  I can only speak from my own experience, but in my case I found almost NO difference between the DVD played upscaled on my blu-ray player (PS3), and watching the show in HD on Showtime (using the same television for both viewings.) The picture quality in my experience, was quite fine, though not everyone has HD or upscaling and people's picture calibrations may differ.",1232582400,37,1946,5.037383177570093
3607127,1,B001GCUBS2,"This is a great show, and Billie Piper does an amazing job as Belle. I was very excited that this show was finally going to be released in US/Canada only to find that the majority of the music has been changed during the show, to a bunch of music that doesn't remotely fit the show.  Also the dvd quality itself is absolutely terrible.  The show is out of focus and the lighting is horribly bright.  None of these flaws were on the British version and I am thinking Lionsgate somehow majorly cheaped this down.  I am very disappointed.",1232064000,87,535,4.428571428571429
3607128,5,B001GCUBS2,"I've seen a few courtesan friendly movies, and this one is a wonderful series.  Billie Piper does a wonderful narrative and lead heroine act, where she embraces the common taboos that society creates for itself, yet finds her own balance of the accumulation of pleasure, wealth, humanity, and even guilt.  A great show, well written, well scripted, and yes, for those that appreciate the beauty of the female in general, you won't go wrong because this pretty much shows all her beauty, clothes and sans clothes, as well as her thoughts and hopes.  I'm looking forward to seeing how this story unfolds with every episode.  There is certainly more to this show than simple nudity, there is a humanity to it that is just as enjoyable.",1231545600,39,732,4.785714285714286
3607129,5,B001GCUBS2,"This is such a great show and I will be glued to my TV for the season 2 premiere. Those lips, that accent! YUM!!! Showtime has done it again. Mary Louise Parker and Billie Piper on in one night. What's a guy to do?!",1230854400,9,215,3.909090909090909

3607151,1,B001GCUBS2,"This show is awful on every level: writing, camp, interest, creativity.....it seems to be a messy collage of all the cliches and un-sexiest ideas ever done already. I have never written a review, let alone a negative one, yet this one deserves fair warning. I got to episode three and just couldn't give the benefit of the doubt - IT-IS-REALLY-CHEESY-AND-BORING. If you want to watch something in this genre, and something set in a brothel for titillating writing, and interesting plots and characters with multiple demensions, I would suggest the Australian TV series, ""Satisfaction,"" as it is pretty good. Otherwise, this one is something that a 1960's harlequin editor would have sold - marketing only to great grandmas.",1481241600,,723,5.135593220338983

3607475,5,B001GCUBS2,"Billie Piper is so, so good as Belle, the hooker/regular girl - in turns super-sexy and plain-looking, sophisticated and matter of fact, dominant and vulnerable, cynical and idealistic.  Some good sex scenes (great body, and great body doubles too), getting kinkier as the series progress; but also a lot of relational stories with boyfriend(s), family, best mate (and ex-boyfriend), colleagues and employer (aka the madame).  The tension of living a double life is so well illustrated too, and you slowly realize that Belle is in fact a bit of a loner, marching to her own drummer, and enjoying the independence and the control (to a certain extent) that this job provides her.  Yes, the show glamorizes prostitution but Belle in her voice-over clearly says that this her personal story which is not necessarily representative of those of other sex workers.  It also very clearly illustrates that sex work can be ""just a job"" with its ups and downs (!), its boring customers and its great clients, the thrill of meeting a new man or a nice ""regular"" and the boredom of routine, or even the real danger of a wacko.",1403308800,2,1114,4.847368421052631

I love all things London and Londoners, so it was nice to see the shots of London and hear London accents and glimpse of London culture - definitely checking out the book(s) that this series is based on.

Belle/Hannah is totally relatable as a person and as a call girl.  I love how she hates being a mentor, yet she persists in being Bambi's mentor.  Some hilarious scenes.

One this about the DVD though - if you own an older DVD player, there may be some compatibility issues. When I tried to watch this on one of my players, it wouldn't recognize the disc.

Definitely was not disappointed. It's like Sex and the City, without all the obnoxious and cliche female stereotypes. No drama of, ""whens my bf going to call me! Oh no!"".

The only complaint I could have about this show is that sometimes the ""cut scenes"" they have of her just sitting around thinking or doing something, can tend to drag on.

I also hated the lighting in most of the episodes.  Is it supposed to look like a soft porn set?  Perhaps so, but the lighting could be improved on to give a more modern and hip feel.

3607693,4,B001GCUBS2,"There is an old saying that you can't buy love, but you can rent it.  IF you have enough $$, you can rent it from a High Society call girl like Belle.  Some clients just rent her time once, while other clients use her services as routinely as they would a cashier @ a Supermarket.

What is interesting about this DVD is that the episodes are based on real-life adventures of a British call girl.  The DVD explores different facets of what a call girl must be fluent in, such as the Girlfriend Experience (known as GFE in Escort circles), group sex, threesomes, S & M and dominatrix stuff.  There's more to being a courtesan than many may realize!

Billie Piper is perfect as the lead role.  She is exquisite, sophisticated enough to pass for a high society harlot and sultry enough to take things to the bedroom.  The one complaint I have is that I was expecting more nudity.  While there is occasionally nudity here & there, the series is not saturated with it (as I thought it would be).

For those who are fascinated by the prostitution underworld, this series is a must-have (at least the 1st season, anyway).

Billie Piper is absolutely enthralling to watch. Especially those moments when she is talking to the camera or, in essence, is talking directly to you, the watcher. There is a slight feeling of voyeurism to watching this program, but not enough to make you stop. At least, not for me. Her character is brilliant, honest, and, dare I say it, at times absolutely heartbreaking. That the series is based on a real person was surprising. I watched the interview with Belle du Jour (the real one), and she is quite stunning, and a physics professor at that. The conversation was intelligent and clear-minded.

She is still obviously a very beautiful woman but for a show that has a lot to do with sex it did kind of take away from the excitement of the 2nd season. We tune into shows like this for the sex and the fun of watching her alternative luxurious risky lifestyle,  it's all part of the intrigue. It all seemed a bit watered down the second season and a tad awkward at times but never the less I still believe it is worth a shot and we now have the 3rd season to look forward to. Hopefully it will have a big turn around for all of us that were a bit underwhelmed .",1264377600,,698,3.915492957746479

3607731,5,B001GCUBS2,"A great show starring a great actrees. If you haven't seen this show yet i highly recommend picking up both this season as well as season 1 for a great watching experience. A great story line with a performer beautiful enough to play the roll with the acting chops to make it just not a pretty face stuck in differnt situations. Billie Piper has been in everything from Dr. Who to Mystery Theatre, quite the acting range. Dont miss this show, but be careful, you may want to block out a few hours in your shedule because this show will suck you in and you won't realize where the time has gone.",1252713600,,594,4.3125
3607732,3,B001GCUBS2,"The second season of the high class escort ""Belle de Jour"" or Hannah Baxter by daytime is sooo much more better than the first. Billie Piper plays Belle/Hannah with much more comfort and the show starts exploring with much more depth the quite realistic world of being a prostitute. Belle is back with her sexual adventures for money, and this time around the writers give her 3 problems, a boyfriend, who she desperatley tries to hold onto, a new friend, a dow eyed new to the business Bambi, and the increasinlgy problematic nature of Belle's job. What I admire about the second season, is that the writers never let the viewers loose sight or get caught up in the glamour of having a whole bunch of money, and being your own boss. Yes, Belle can buy the expensive bags, and works a couple of hours a day, but when one of Belle's clients at a party turns out to be a lot more than she bargained for, the viewer really sees, that YES! it is dangerous to be paid by strange men to sleep with them, because not everyone has good intentions. The dangerous  physical reality of Belle's job is shown twice this season, but the show is full of lighthearted moments, such as Belle's first client of the second season, who has quite a humourous request. I would highly reccomend this show, its witty, charming, and it gives you a little inside into a high class escorts life.",1252627200,,1368,4.493975903614458
3607733,3,B001GCUBS2,"Belle is delightful. The show is funny. However the situations she gets into are totally unprofessional and would cause her career to crash quickly.  Her screening of clients seems haphazard.  Clients wives finding her is ridiculous.  Connecting with the wrong client in a bar is hilarious in the age of cell phones!!

Bambi, her newbie partner, is a total loser and violates her boundaries, yet Belle sticks by her.

Belle has too many unresolved issues about her double life to long survive
as a call girl.

`The Sopranos'  about a gangster and his double life does a very good job.
Clearly real professionals handle a double life very well.

I like `Sex in the City' much Better for a realistic thinking show about Sex.",1251590400,,722,4.766129032258065
3607734,4,B001GCUBS2,"I would not agree that the second season is as good or better than the first season, but it is a good continuation of the story of Hannah. The first season is sharper overall and quite good. If you like the story of Hannah/Belle in season 1, you will want to watch season 2. Billie Piper presents an interesting complex character that is confident when playing as ""Belle"" but is confused, rudderless, and lacking maturity when just ""herself"". The season starts out slow but builds to the drama of the second half of season 2.

The tawdry action is not as inventive, active, or funny the second season, and Billie Piper does not look as sexy as apparently Piper was pregnant at the time of filming. The production tries to hide her puffier pregnant body and uses body doubles for some scenes, so the second series does not quite have the same edge and raunchiness. Belle is given an apprentice of sorts this season, called Bambi, and that character tries to take up the slack in humour and sex appeal, and has some good moments. Still the second season is worth revisting Hannah/Belle's world.",1247616000,2,1092,4.628865979381444
3607755,2,B001GCUBS2,"well i can't disagree more with the previous reviewers.  of the two seasons, this is by far the weakest.  the first season i thought was real cutting edge drama/comedy.  the second season is almost politically correct and could almost be shown on commercial tv.  plus, ms. piper is might either be pregnant during the shooting or just had a baby.  her face is very puffed out, wears very baggy clothes (kinda goes against what the show is about, doesn't it?), has clever camera angles and editing.  of course has a body double for the nude scenes.  which by the way, there isn't as much as the first season.  there also isn't much for comedy.  i think there was one or two early episodes that made me chuckle, but that was about it.  i would try to view this season before buying it.  it definately does not hold up.",1246924800,3,816,4.445945945945946
3607756,4,B001GCUBS2,"I had watched the first season not too long ago and found myself interested in the funny/sexy show and the character of Belle/Hannah. Hannah a ""nighttime legal secretary"" and Belle the smouldering call girl who finds herself in wonderfully strange situations. The second season went beyond anything that I would have expected for the show. Introducing a new character played by Callum Blue (Dead Like Me) who makes her personal and professional life completely collide with each other. The chemistry between the two of them is amazing and creates an awkward threesome between her and Ben (her best friend).
I don't want to give too much away because the suprises are what make this season so special. The fifth episode particularly was very very good.
I would recommend this to anyone who isn't too squeamish and loves British television.",1246406400,7,838,5.0359712230215825
3607757,5,B001GCUBS2,"Some of you may have read (and agreed or disagreed) with my review of season one of this Brit import / Showtime broadcast series.  I kept meaning to get around to championing season two, which is even BETTER, but it looks like I'll have to settle for being the second customer review.

It's very odd, whenever people find out I have (had) Showtime, they always ask about ""US of Tara,"" as though that's the only good show.  For my money, this is actually a better show (and I like Diablo Cody's ""US of Tara"") and it got even better in the second season.

I found the most interesting parts of season 1 to be the drama-lite, but realistic portrayals of juggling the Hannah/Belle dynamic (one is the girl everyone thinks they know, the other is a high class escort.)  This season dives into that dynamic whole-heartedly with her attempts at having (gasp) a relationship, and at her having a ""real"" friend/co-worker of sorts, the delightfully dim Bambi.  (Last season flirted with her having an escort friend, but it turned out to be a disappointment for her character.)

With the new characters, the same witty writing, the same fast-paced zing, you owe it to yourself to check out this criminally unmentioned, unwatched, and underrated series.  It's a heavenly blend of witty comedy and drama-lite (it's engaging and affecting, but never ""heavy"") and this is coming from a viewer who traditionally avoids Brit-TV shows and movies.  (Nothing personal, just not my favorite international locale for the moving picture.)

You can watch season 2 without having seen season 1, both are good, but season 2 far suprasses the original thanks to its attention to character, and realistic complications.  The sex is there too, complete with an of-the-moment fetish-induced-scandal involving a PM candidate, but really, that's not the reason to watch.  This is NOT a show anyone should feel guilty about watching, it's sharpness, succinctness, and attention to detail in my opinion make even the revered ""Sex and the City"" look like a cliche.",1245542400,12,2029,4.935294117647059
3607758,5,B001GCUBS2,"SECRET DIARY OF A CALL GIRL is one of the most suprising and exciting comedic series to have ever emerged! Coming from SHOWTIME (the cable network resposible for the addictive and Emmy-nominated series WEEDS), the show, as the title suggests, is about a call girl and her daily struggles in balancing work and life in London.  In Season 2, Hannah, played by the amazingly talented Billie Piper (of Doctor Who fame), is forced to balance a relationship for the first time with her work as Belle (the name she goes by with her clients). As the 10-episode season progresses, Hannah finds it to be increasingly difficult having a boyfriend, especially when he has yet to learn what she does for a living. Yikes! Witty and utterly charming, this series immediately captures your attention (given its subject matter of course) and holds on to it with great writing and captivating performances.  Billie Piper truely shines in her role as Hannah and commands the audience's attention every single time she appears on screen. Piper brings a lot of heart to her character and is truely the driving force that makes this series so great.  For anyone who wishes to get into this series, I would suggest watching Season 2 first and then maybe going back to revisit Season 1 later, b/c I found the second season to be much better than the first.

She makes it clear she's never been sexually abused and is not a drug addict. She just likes the two things that make being an escort appealing-sex and money. She has emotional problems with keeping her work and personal life separate.

But I found a series that was smart, funny, emotional, and addictive.  As to nudity, there isn't much, esp frontal, until well into the series.  I never found the sex anything but a necessary send up.  Like you knew they weren't really doing it (unlike SO many movies/shows).  I guess some found it very sexy, but I couldn't take it seriously, and in this day of soft core being the norm, I found that refreshing.  However, the series, and many of the actors, were *very* sexy!  I loved the gorgeous but down to earth looks and character of Belle/Hannah.  A girl that anyone could love.  The comedy aspect was very spot on and smart.  In fact, without a laugh track, was easy to giggle whenever Ben mentioned going drinking.  So some nice ongoing gags.  The Ben friendship was fun, although too bad there weren't more cool besties, like Sex in the City, to keep things interesting and expand the cast, which really needed it.  Oh, the cast is great, but the bulk of it was her clients.  The core cast is very small, with only minimal, but good, changes.  Amazing it made it to 4 seasons on them, but that shows how great they were and the writing was.  The series kept its quality right down to the 4th season, which stumbled as the storyline didn't give it a chance.  They went down a road that we saw the end of, unfortunately.
