3822209,5,B001VFM0TW,"This 2-disc set is going to be released on July 7th, 2009. It contains the classic heartwarming Charlie Brown/Peanuts Specials that aired from 1965-1969, which are all six specials that aired in the sixties. Those specials are:

A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965)
The perennial Christmas classic about the down on his luck Charlie Brown and his adorably pathetic Christmas Tree. This is where the Peanuts Specials all began.

Charlie Brown's All-Stars (1966)
It's ball season and Charlie Brown faces a moral dilemma when he can get his team new uniforms and a shot at being part of an official league if he is willing to kick Lucy, Violet, Patty, Frieda and Snoopy off the team.

It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (1966)
Another perennial classic about poor Charlie Brown getting more trick's than treat's and ever optimistic Linus spending the night in a humble pumpkin patch. He believes in the Great Pumpkin.

You're In Love, Charlie Brown (1967)
Charlie Brown just wants the courage to meet his crush, the little red haired girl. When Linus and Peppermint Patty try to help things only get worse for good old Chuck.

He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown (1968)
Snoopy is supposed to return to Daisy Hill Puppy Farm for obedience training but winds up at the house of Peppermint Patty instead. Will Charlie Brown get his dog pal to come back home?

It Was A Short Summer Charlie Brown (1969)
At summer camp the boys are losing everything to the girls and putting up with poor conditions. Will the boys be able to prove themselves as winner's before the end of the summer? Maybe some help from the Masked Marvel (aka Snoopy) can do the trick.

Five of these six specials were either Emmy nominated or winning. Here they are being presented with remastered picture and sound quality, and on top of that the last two specials have never appeared on DVD before this. The set also includes a documentary, ""The Maestro of Menlo Park - Profiling Composer Vince Gauraldi"", which takes time to look at the life of the jazz musician who wrote the classic 'Linus and Lucy' Theme as well as other peanuts music.

There have now been forty-one specials in the Peanuts franchise and I'm hoping that they will work on releasing them all in these sort of chronological sets. This set is great for those who haven't bought the other Peanuts releases yet or fans that don't mind double dipping knowing that this time if these releases continue they will be in for a complete set.

All these specials are great for those looking to relive childhood memories or share wholesome entertainment with their children while teaching them core values. I understand television has to evolve to reflect the current times but I wish more current shows could show half the moral undertones found here in these specials. Luckily with this DVD set those interested in wholesome family entertainment can now share these six classic specials with their children.",1236988800,132,2924,4.832

3822229,5,B001VFM0TW,"If Charlie Brown is part of your memories, then this video is definitely worth owning. It seemed, during the 60's, as though we could always count on a new Peanuts special appearing every year or so ...and then it was over. This collection contains everything that we had and looked forward to. Be sure to buy this Warner version and not the earlier Paramount version. The Warner versions are remastered and have much better colors. Example: the Paramount version has purple snow.

The video quality is excellent and complete (true to the original broadcasts, minus the Coke segmenrts), with one exception that you may want to take the trouble to correct yourself, since it is not commercially available:

All of the A Charlie Brown Christmas videos available contain a faded-out ending of Hark, The Herald Angels Sing. Originally, the broadcast contained the full ending as found on the A Charlie Brown Christmas CDs, but it also had a sponsor message intertwined with it that caused CBS to cut that ending out long ago (in the 60s), leaving all current copies without the original full ending. I still hear that ending whenever I watch it. If you are handy with audio and video editing, you can fairly easily add the original complete ending back in. You will need a A Charlie Brown Christmas CD (which you probably already have if you like the video) to do this.

In the video, they took the original recording - found on the CD - and slowed the singing section down by 9.7%, which also changed the pitch and tempo of the CD song. So, if you want the full song, exactly as it was in the original broadcast, youll have to extract the audio track from the video and, using an audio editing program such as Audacity (free), adjust the speed of the singing part from the CD, slowing it down by 9.7%. In the waveform of the audio editor, you can then replace the faded section with the slowed CD track and then mux this new audio track back into the video.",1483056000,4,1954,4.593123209169055

3822259,5,B001VFM0TW,"The 1960's is the decade that started something big for both the Peanuts gang, and the whole world! The first 6 Peanuts specials ever made are contained in this 2-disc DVD collection, all restored and remastered, with a bonus documentary all about Vince Guaraldi on disc 2. A Charlie Brown Christmas and the Great Pumpkin have been on the air every year since they debuted, they're that good and timeless! But you can see them both uncut here anytime you want, aside from sponsorship of course, even though A Charlie Brown Christmas' picture and sound are a little off-kilter in this release, and that's the version ABC used for the Prep and Landing specials when they debuted in 2009 and 2011, albeit edited. If you're expecting the very first Peanuts movie, A Boy Named Charlie Brown, to be in this set, Paramount still owns the original 4 Peanuts Movies, not the WB. However, Paramount has FINALLY put all 4 of them in 1 DVD set in 2016, even if they are in Faux-Widescreen, when compared to much earlier VHS releases of them. You're sure to enjoy every minute of this set, even for the non-holiday specials, and most of them here earned Emmy nominations (and never surfaced in the Peanuts Emmy-Honored set in 2015).

3822288,5,B001VFM0TW,"If you love for Charlie Brown and Snoopy and the rest of the Peanuts gang, but you have grown tired of watching the usual outings, this collection is for you.  This is the Peanuts TV Specials from the 1960's, starting with A Charlie Brown Christmas, of course.  The Great Pumpkin is in there too.  But what makes this collection intriguing are the seldom-seen (if ever) Specials like Charlie Brown's All Stars, You're In Love, Charlie Brown, He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown and It Was A Short Summer, Charlie Brown.  Some of these aired once, maybe twice, and the were lost to television history.  Are they as spectacular as the more popular Christmas, Halloween, Thanksgiving & Easter episodes?  They are.  Peanuts was always eclectic and off-kilter and each of these outings stays true to Shultz's vision.  And each of them were highly successful in their premieres.  So sit back and enjoy seeing some Peanuts that you may have never seen.  I know I did.  With the exception of the Christmas and Halloween stories, I hadn't seen a single one.  Two more  collections follow, the 1970's in two parts.  They are definitely worth it, especially if you are like I am and prefer the original voice talents and Shultz's direct involvement where the Peanuts gang is concerned.

Dig it!",1424649600,4,1276,4.815668202764977
3822289,5,B001VFM0TW,"In this collection, you get not only the original 6 animated specials but an in-depth special on the late Vince Guaraldi, composer of all the Peanuts special soundtracks up to 1976. The original specials had a certain magic touch to them, with Charles Schulz's cartoon ideas, the production of Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez, Guaraldi's music scores and the original voices of Peter Robbins (Charlie Brown), Chris Shea (Linus) and Gai DeFaria (Peppermint Patty), to name a few.
A Charlie Brown Christmas (Dec 1965)- This is the animated special that started it all! Charlie Brown feels depressed with all the commercialism (Snoopy decorates his doghouse, Sally wants $10's and $20's) and for 5 cents, Lucy suggests the ""blockhead"" direct the school play. He purchases a small sorry tree, which is the final straw with the gang. Linus explains the true reason behind Christmas.
Charlie Brown's All Stars (June 1966)- An underrated classic. After losing every game played, Charlie Brown's team disbands before his eyes. Not long after, Mr. Hennessy offers to sponsor Charlie's team and offers them uniforms. The catch: no girls or dogs are allowed on the team.
It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (Oct 1966)- Linus forsakes trick or treating in order to await the coming of the Great Pumpkin and persuades Sally to join him. Charlie Brown gets tricked instead of treated on Halloween. Snoopy masquerades as a World War I flying ace and battles wits the Red Baron. Features Charlie Brown's 1st animated attempt to kick the football.
You're In Love, Charlie Brown (June 1967) With the school year drawing to a close, Charlie Brown needs to tell the little red haired girl he likes her. Linus and Peppermint Patty (who makes her animation debut here) try to help ol' Chuck.
He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown (Feb 1968)- Snoopy's behavior is out of control and the gang demands Charlie Brown take action. He sends Snoopy back to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm for an obedience class and the beagle makes a detour at Peppermint Patty's house and stays there.
 It Was A Short Summer, Charlie Brown (Sept 1969)- School begins, the gang is assigned to write about their summer vacation. Linus and Charlie Brown reflect on the trials and tribulations of summer camp, being beat by the girls every time. The Masked Marvel makes his debut.
The special on Vince Guaraldi is excellent. 30 minutes of information on the great composer who brought us Linus And Lucy, Christmastime Is Here, Joe Cool and many others. Features interviews with his son, band members who played with him and Lee Mendelson.
If you loved the Peanuts specials, this is the best place to start. Five cents, please.",1424563200,3,2665,4.935412026726058

3822338,5,B001VFM0TW,"Absolutely fantastic.

As of today, I am 42 years old.  I have been a Peanuts fan since I was about 9.  I used to buy Peanuts books at flea markets.  Sometimes I could find the TV specials books or books on tape.
Yet they never showed the specials on TV!  Of course we saw the Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas specials, but nothing much else.  Even after 1982, it seemed like CBS never showed the Easter or Valentine's specials anymore.

So four of these specials I had never seen.  They are more than gems.  The background colors are watercolor-pretty pastels (at the beginning of YOU'RE IN LOVE, CHARLIE BROWN, we get to see the the birds that Snoopy hung out with before Schultz settled on one: Woodstock).  The music is unique to each show.  And the jokes taken from the comics put into a coherent story are delightful.

In these specials, we also get to see the first animated appearance of Peppermint Patty;
Sally Dryer, who was a fantastic ""Lucy"";
Roy, Shermy, Frieda, Patty, and Violet all with speaking parts in IT WAS A SHORT SUMMER, CHARLIE BROWN (Sophie, from Peppermint Patty's camp experience in the strip also appears - great continuity there);
The hilarity of Snoopy - done with great expressions, body movement, and sound effects by Bill Melendez - especially highlighted in HE'S YOUR DOG, CHARLIE BROWN.

The choppy movements of the animated characters adds to the charm of these specials.  I imagine families watching these in the 1960s during prime time and it gives me a comforting feeling of nostalgia for a time when I wasn't even alive!  Ha!

So for Peanuts/Schultz fans, this is a must-have.  The discs can be rewatched as they haven't been played yearly like the Halloween and Christmas specials - so there is something to appreciate each time.",1407024000,4,1776,4.770491803278689

A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) - In this Emmy and Peabody Award winning classic, Charlie Brown is upset by how commercial the Christmas holiday has become. To coax him out of his holiday blues, Lucy suggests he direct the school's Christmas pageant and decorate a glorious tree. Charlie Brown concedes. The tree he finds however, is puny, prompting everyone to ridicule him.
Charlie Brown's All-Stars (1966) - Nominated for two Prime Time Emmys, in this delightful special, Charlie Brown is faced with a difficult moral dilemma; should he accept brand new uniforms and give the rest of the gang a chance to be part of an official little league baseball team even if it means that due to policy, Snoopy, Lucy, Patty, Violet and Frieda must be kicked off?
It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (1966) - This Emmy Award-nominated special, finds the Peanuts gang outfitted in costumes, ready for trick or treating and crashing Violet's Halloween party. Charlie Brown is in a ghost costume (with more eyeholes cut out than needed), Lucy dressed as a witch and Snoopy in a World War I flying ace costume. Linus decides to steadfastly hold vigil in the pumpkin patch as he awaits the Great Pumpkin.
You're in Love, Charlie Brown (1967) - This Emmy Award-nominated special finds Charlie Brown trying to work up the courage to meet his school-girl crush, the little red-haired girl. He enlists the help of his pals Linus and Peppermint Patty but they only aggravate the situation.
He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown (1968) - This Emmy Award-nominated special finds Snoopy returning to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm for a refresher course in obedience training after his mischievous behavior lands Charlie Brown in trouble. On his way to the puppy farm however, Snoopy finds refuge in Peppermint Patty's house, that's until Charlie Brown gets a call from the puppy farm telling him Snoopy never showed up.
It was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown (1969) - At summer camp, the Peanuts gang put up with poor food and the girls winning all the sports competitions. To get even, the boys challenge them into a wrist-wresting contest between Lucy and ""The Masked Marvel"" - aka Snoopy in disguise.",1318032000,4,2188,4.932249322493225

I have the first 3 volumes (60's, 70's 1, 70's 2) and almost all the individual releases trying to get every available episode.  I really don't like it when the DVD companies release complete seasons/volumes and then just stop releasing.  I assume we won't see them continue into the 80's or it would have been out/announced by now being a year since this release and that we only went six months in between the other.

Now I'm stuck with duplicates of almost all these episodes.  A. From buying them previously, and B. now from starting to purchase more individual discs since I've realized they won't be releasing the rest in a comprehensive format anymore.

Just beware...is all.  Plus the fact that the Peanuts Specials have been liscenced to 2 different companies for release, there are 2 versions of most specials out there and alot of them carry different ""bonus"" episodes, so it can be tricky to keep track of it.

Just do some research before you buy if your just starting out collecting...not saying there's anything wrong with this set, just beaware of what's out there to avoid buying the same episodes twice.",1302134400,7,1193,4.701923076923077

3822384,5,B001VFM0TW,"This great collection of Peanuts TV specials from the 1960s contains the magnificent and often reshown ""Christmas"" and ""Great Pumpkin"", and also the less well known but wonderful ""All Stars"", ""You're in Love"", ""He's Your Dog,"" and ""Short Summer"".

I was a child in the 1960s, and I remember eagerly awaiting each one of these TV specials when they were first shown and then again each year as they went into reruns.  In this collection ""Christmas"" and ""Great Pumpkin"" will be the most familiar because they have been rerun at least once every year since they premiered in 1965 and 1966. But for some reason the others dropped out of rerun rotation sometime in the 1970s, and haven't been seen since.  Its hard to understand why they fell out of favor with the powers that be, because they are every bit as funny and philosophical as their better known brethren.

Now at last they are available again, and we can watch the ever losing Charlie Brown's troubles with baseball, summer camp, his dog Snoopy, and best of all his unrequited love for the little red haired girl whenever we like, uncut and in brilliantly remastered color. If you remember them from their original showings, nostalgia will give additional pleasure when you watch them.

3822389,3,B001VFM0TW,"For years now, loyal fans of the Peanuts have been waiting for a definitive collection containing the entire library of peanuts animated specials.  Unfortunately, these new Peanuts decade collections aren't it.  While the Peanuts: 1960's Collection contains the first five Peanuts specials in chronological order, it leaves out the sixth, ""A Boy Named Charlies Brown,"" which was released in 1969.  It turns out that, When Warner Bros. purchased the rights to produce these Peanuts specials on DVD, they did not acquire the rights to the Peanuts animated specials that were released in theaters, including ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown,"" ""Snoopy, Come Home,"" ""Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown,"" and ""Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown.""  As a result, you won't see any of those classics in these volumes.  True fans of the Peanuts, buying many of these specials for the second or third time, are no doubt expecting the COMPLETE Peanuts collection, but that's not what they're getting here.

On top of this, the special features in this volume are a sincere disappointment.  The documentary about Vince Guaraldi is informative and comprehensive (though not particularly interesting), but that's all we get other than a trailer about the history of Warner Bros. which (I learned too late) is NOT kid friendly and in no way relates to the Peanuts.  In contrast, we recently bought ""Snoopy's Reunion"" on DVD and were wowed by the touching and fascinating retrospective about the voice talents for the Peanuts over the years.  Where is that kind of documentary in this set?

All in all, this collection is incomplete, both in terms of features and additional content.  It's clear that Warner Home Video can do much better, and they probably will.  I'm sure there will be a new and better complete set (whether produced by Warner or Paramount) released once we've spent all our money on these ones.",1265500800,21,1880,5.048543689320389
3822390,5,B001VFM0TW,This DVD is perfect for families with youngsters.  Brought me back to my childhood and all of those special holiday times in an instant.  I love the fact that the characters play outside and have a real life.  There are so many animated shows for kids that are fantastic and don't display the different types of social interaction that occurs in real life.  It's not overstimulating either.  I am a huge Peanuts fan!,1265500800,3,416,4.6438356164383565

3822392,5,B001VFM0TW,"Its probably not well known but Paramount released very excellent Laserdisc editions of all these Peanuts TV specials except for Charlie Brown's All-Stars. Comparing those LD editions to washed-out looking VHS they are highly superior visually and sonically with vivid color and a rock-stable picture... probably produced from the original negatives, as opposed to some old 16mm prints or video format. Seeing they had done this work for Laserdisc, Paramount probably took the same LD masters to make their DVDs so remember this was early 90's technology and good as it was, when Warners obtained the licensing rights, well, you might imagine that film/video technology has come a long way in nearly 15 years! Personally, I like my older LD's and Paramount DVDs and won't be replacing them all with the Warners product. But I would like to see titles that Paramount did not release be put on digital disc.

I would still buy this set however just to get ""All-Stars"" in high quality as it has only been released on VHS and the old RCA/CED format except for this DVD set. Warners should release All-Stars as a separate disc grouped with some of the other specials but I don't imagine they will do this. I have all the Peanuts Paramount Laserdiscs which include many of the Charlie Brown/Snoopy Shows and the This is America series so if you still own a Laserdisc you might try to locate some of these discs. Its a Nightmare, Charlie Brown and It's a Circus were released on the CED (Capacitance Electronic Disc) format in the 80's. So maybe we will see Warners come out with these as well and some other Peanuts specials.",1265414400,2,1619,4.7821428571428575

3822399,5,B001VFM0TW,"Peanuts fans over the age of 42 or ""Schulzologists"" in general so will really enjoy this! While everyone is familar with a ""CB Christmas"" and the ""great Pumpkin"" episodes, some really rare stuff is included here.

I don't believe that ""It Was a Short Summer, CB,"" (1969), ""He's Your Dog, CB,"" (1968), ""You're In Love, CB,"" (1967), or ""CB's All Stars"" (1966) have been shown any more than twice since their original appearances. In order, these deal with our gang going to summer camp, prodded by Lucy. The arm rasslin' match between Lucy and Snoopy is a hoot. ""He's Your Dog"" is the direct predecessor for the gang's second feature ""Snoopy Come Home"" (1972) and has a very direct reference to the latter film. Here, Snoopy's obnoxious and unwanted clowing with the other kids gets him a bid at obedience school at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm. Mildly amusing (I liked it better when I saw it as a small child when it first came out), but it's still above much of the other fare of this era.

""You're in Love,"" is really sweet, one of the few times CB comes out ahead? How? Watch it and you'll see. I wonder why this has seldom been aired since it's first broadcast (I recall seeing it around 1972 when I was in the first grade). ""CB's All Stars"" is an interesting tale that mixes baseball humor with a touching example of CB's loyalty to his ""friends"" in spite of their ingratitude. The ending of this is truly touching as well as amusing and says a lot about Linus' true loyalty to CB.

The special feature is a documentary on Vince Guiraldi, the tunesmith behind the wonderful musical themes of these specials. Quite interesting. he appears to have had the perfect personality to do this wonderful music (I had no idea that it was him singing the ""Joe Cool"" song from ""You're Not Elected CB"" in 1972). It would be nice, given the fact that this IS about Peanuts in the 60s, if this were to include the Peanuts Ford commercials from earlier in the decade and the early aminated segments from the unsold 1963 documentary ""A Boy named Charlie Brown"" (not to be confused with the 1969 feature film of the same name). Such is the life of a certified member of the CGA (Cartoon Geeks of America). If you're one, you'll want this!",1257120000,3,2222,4.508684863523573

And yet, some of the scenes still imprinted on my mind all come rushing back in a flood of memories. This is the original voice cast you know and love from the Christmas and Halloween specials, and the same limited (yet charming) animation. There's even a nifty doc about the man who composed the awesome music for these cartoons, Vince Guaraldi. So what are you waiting for?

I am really enjoying this purchase.,1251072000,3,337,4.55
3822405,5,B001VFM0TW,"Even though I have the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peanuts-Holiday-Collection-It-s-the-Great-Pumpkin-Charlie-Brown-A-Charlie-Brown-Thanksgiving-A-Charlie-Brown-Christmas-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B001CO32FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peanuts Holiday Collection (It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown / A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving / A Charlie Brown Christmas) (Deluxe Edition)</a>, I decided to buy the PEANUTS 1960'S COLLECTION 2-DVD SET for the other four episodes.

I've never seen ""Charlie Brown's All-Stars,"" ""You're In Love, CB,"" ""He's Your Dog, CB,"" and ""It Was A Short Summer, CB,"" and this set was cheap enough that I figured why not?

Of course the two main holiday specials from the 60s, ""A CB Christmas"" and ""It's The Great Pumpkin, CB,"" are also included in this set but does NOT have the special features from the deluxe holiday release.

Since I grew up on Peanuts specials this was a must have for me. I enjoyed the other cartoons just as much as the holiday specials and this adds to my collection.

Other reviewers have already listed an episode guide so I won't do that. I'll just say that if you're trying to decide if this set is worth it, especially if you already have the deluxe holiday set like me, I'd say it is if you love Charlie Brown and the rest of the Peanuts gang. Peppermint Patty is featured in two episodes and the story revolves around Snoopy on ""He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown,"" so you get a good mix.

===================  SPECIAL FEATURES  =========================
**36:55-minute FEATURETTE ""THE MAESTRO OF MENLO PARK""
Lee Mendelson (Exec. Prod for ""Peanuts""), Seward McCain (Bassist w/Guaraldi), David Guaraldi (Vince's son), and others discuss jazz maestro Vince Guaraldi--showing old photographs and playing samples of songs like ""Linus & Lucy,"" ""Christmas Time Is Here,"" ""Joe Cool's Blues,"" and ""Little Birdie""--explaining how he was chosen to supply the music for Peanuts and how iconic the music would become.
=====================================================================
There's something very special about Charlie Brown and Peanuts. Perhaps it's the touching story lines, simple drawings, and jazz music that create that magic. Or maybe it's because we all have a little Charlie Brown in us and that's why we still find these cartoons endearing. Whatever the reason, I  suggest buying this set, even though you'll be double dipping if you already have the holiday set, because it will bring a smile to your face and you get the other four episodes plus the Guaraldi special.

The set comes in a clamshell case that holds the two DVDs but there's a mistake on the episode listing (all least on my set): the ""You're In Love, CB"" is listed on the cover sheet as being episode number 4 on DVD 1, but it starts off DVD 2.",1248825600,8,2811,5.488425925925926
3822406,3,B001VFM0TW,"Now don't hate me for saying this, even I hate myself for saying this but it has to be said.  I love Peanuts a lot and I also think the TV shows are great too but I don't really care for the ones in the 1960s. Let me explain.

First in A Charlie Brown Christmas the first special that they did, it was OK but I do feel bad for Charlie Brown. Also I have it on DVD so I don't really want to get it again but it is a classic but I would give it a B+. Then in Charlie Brown All Stars it was OK but again I feel bad for Charlie Brown. I would give this a B+. Then there's It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, I do like it but I already have it on DVD. I would give this a A-.

Then there's You're in Love, Charlie Brown, it was OK but again I feel bad for Charlie Brown I mean everyone laughed at him at he got in trouble on the last day of school. I would give this a B+. In He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown, Snoopy was not that nice to Peppermint Patty and later she's mean to him. At first I think he deserves it but than I feel sorry for him. I would give this a C-.

Lastly in It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown, I was upset that it did not have a good ending. Also in the show we can see Violet, Patty, Fredia, and Shermy when they were pretty much out of the comic strip at that time. I would give this a C-.

I do think that the 1970s specials were much better. But I would still say for Peanuts fans if you don't mind all this stuff then get the DVD. I don't care if anyone finds this review helpful or not I just had to say what was on my mind.",1248652800,3,1550,3.6990881458966567
3822407,5,B001VFM0TW,"I know that Warner HV has already released several of the 1960s PEANUTS specials under separate cover -- and I have both A Charlie Brown Christmas and It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown in my collection -- but I couldn't pass up this reasonably-priced compilation of all six PEANUTS specials released in that decade. These are the bumpy, lumpy, crude, yet utterly winning half-hours that made the reputation of the Bill Melendez Studios and ensured a long, happy life on the small screen (and, later, the big screen) for Charlie Brown and the gang.

Along with the evergreen specials mentioned above -- which are still regularly run on TV to this day -- the set includes Charlie Brown's All-Stars, You're In Love, Charlie Brown, He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown, and It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown. The last-named of these was produced during the ramp-up to the first full-length feature film starring the PEANUTS characters, so we get a clear picture of how Melendez' ""graphic blandishment facilitators"" polished their skills in preparation for that step up in class. The Disney Studio's progression from Steamboat Willie to Snow White it ain't, but the animation and draftsmanship in Short Summer is a considerable improvement over that of CB Christmas, while preserving many of the quirky facial expressions and other oddities that make these early efforts so charming.

It's important to remember how ""cutting-edge"" these cartoons were at the time they were made. Conventional wisdom held that professionally trained adults were needed to voice children, but Schulz and Melendez insisted on using real kids. (Peter Robbins as Charlie Brown, Chris Shea as Linus, Gai DeFaria as Peppermint Patty -- and, needless to say, Melendez as Snoopy, who, it's amazing to think now, some folks wanted to have an actual voice, rather than the howls, snickers, and hoots we're all familiar with -- still rank, in my mind, as the canonical voices for their respective characters.) The jazz tracks of Vince Guaraldi sounded nothing like any other contemporary ""cartoon music,"" yet they've become synonymous with the specials and have birthed several best-selling records, to boot. Needless to say, the decision to climax CB Christmas with Linus' simple recital of the Nativity Story from Luke's Gospel flew in the face of the ""trend towards cultural homogenization"" favored in the era of the ""Big Three"" networks. In the 1970s and beyond, the PEANUTS specials certainly looked slicker than these efforts, but they were a little hollow and formulaic at times, a little too quick to hop on trends (It's Flashbeagle, anyone? Anyone?...), and lacked such memorable moments as, for example, the wrist-wrestling match between Snoopy and Lucy in Short Summer, the World War I Flying Ace dogfight in Great Pumpkin (which Melendez reused in He's Your Dog and A Boy Named Charlie Brown), and Charlie's agonized efforts to meet the Little Red-Haired Girl in You're In Love -- to say nothing of Linus' Gospel reading. Schulz gradually unbent himself a bit on the issue of ""selling out"" -- allowing Charlie Brown to kiss the Red-Haired Girl in 1977's It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown, permitting adult voices and characters to appear in the This is America mini-series and elsewhere -- but here we get the animated PEANUTS in its purest, most authentic form.

The ""remastered"" cartoons look reasonably good, though I did notice some streakiness in scenes with dark, full-color backgrounds (e.g. the scene in CB Christmas where Charlie Brown is looking up at the blue, star-spangled night sky). The only extra is a lengthy and intermittently interesting documentary about Vince Guaraldi that occasionally strays a bit too far into ""jazz insider"" territory. The previous releases of CB Christmas and Great Pumpkin had mini-docs that detailed the stories of the cartoons' creation, but they are not included here for some reason. Perhaps Warners thought that those purchasing this set would probably also have the earlier releases, but the omission still strikes me as a bit strange... and why not have a commentary or two with surviving animators as an alternative voice track to several of these? Irritatingly, You're in Love is specified as being on Disc 1 on the DVD cover, but is on Disc 2 inside. Not even the notoriously desultory Disney DVD would have made that big of a mistake, I think.

Hopefully, Warners will follow this up with a 1970s collection. Beyond that, I think I'll stick to YouTube. Something went out of the cartoons for me when Guaraldi passed and Melendez et al. started playing havoc with ""canon."" These cartoons, however, are definite keepers for anyone with an interest in the PEANUTS phenomenon or 1960s pop culture in general.",1247529600,3,4737,5.084832904884319
3822408,5,B001VFM0TW,"Some things, though they become dated and quaint, still remain classic and timeless.  Charles Schultz's Peanuts TV specials are no exception to this.  Every year I look forward to one of the major television networks airing the Peanuts holiday specials, especially A Charlie Brown Christmas and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.

Recently, Warner Brothers has released a remastered collection of the 1960's specials on a two-disc set.  This set contains six half-hour specials, each disc containing three (although the box erroneously indicates that there are four on the first disc and two on the second disc).  Also included in this set is a featurette profiling the composer of the Peanuts music, including the famed ""Linus and Lucy"" track, Vince Guaraldi.

The specials are included in chronological order, and the last two have never before been released on DVD.  Here are the specials included:

A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965)
The classic, beloved story of the Peanuts gang's Christmas pageant and Charlie Brown's quest to rediscover the true meaning of Christmas.

Charlie Brown's All-Stars (1966)
Charlie Brown and his hapless baseball team can't catch a break on the diamond.  Ever the shrewd manager, Charlie Brown believes new uniforms and entry into a real league will provide the inspiration his team needs to get over the hump.  However, there's a catch:  he must get rid of the girls on the team, as well as Snoopy.  How will he handle such a conundrum?

It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (1966)
Another beloved Peanuts holiday special.  This time it's Halloween and time for the gang to go trick-or-treating.  The dumb luck of Charlie Brown, however, will bring him more tricks than treats.  Meanwhile, Linus patiently awaits the arrival of the Great Pumpkin, a lesser-known holiday gift-bringer.

You're in Love, Charlie Brown (1967)
It's the end of the school year and Charlie Brown is distressed about not being able to have fun like the rest of his friends.  After complaining and venting to Linus, Charlie Brown realizes that his frustrations are due to his as-yet unrequited affections for The Little Red-Haired Girl, and it becomes his quest to talk to her (interesting sidenote, this is the first Peanuts special to feature the ""trombone voice"" of the schoolteacher).

He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown (1968)
The gang has become frustrated with Snoopy and his disobedient way, so Charlie Brown decides to send him back to the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm for obedience training.  With Snoopy, however, nothing ever goes as planned.

It was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown (1969)
The Peanuts kids all go to summer camp, but the boys have a rough time.  Unfavorable conditions and repeated losses to the girls in sports get them down, but everything could change based on the outcome of the wrist-wrestling match between Lucy and Snoopy ""The Masked Marvel.""

Since the 1960's there have been dozens of additional Peanuts TV specials, but there's something about these first few that keep us coming back to them time and time again.  This is an excellent, inexpensive collection of these timeless treasures.",1247184000,13,3126,5.094302554027505

This is a collection of specials that brings back memories of reading those softbound volumes of the weekly newspaper comic strips containing the humor now included as animation herein.  I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary of Vince Guaraldi and how he got involved in scoring the PEANUTS specials and ultimately helping to identify them for generations, and I can only hope that this is the first volume in a series and that, on a future set, we get some special features that tell the story from the point of view of the creator, himself, Charles M. Schultz.  Bravo to Warner Brothers for making all this possible!",1247184000,5,756,4.8
3822410,5,B001VFM0TW,"These shows are the absolute best of the Peanuts TV specials - this and the movie A BOY NAMED CHARLIE BROWN (1969) are all you need.

Everything has a Golden Period and the 60's was it for Peanuts. There was an almost hypnotic quality to these early specials - they take their time, are more character-oriented than plot-oriented, and the humor is droll and intelligent.  This philosophical bent is what makes them the perfect video equivalent of the classic comic strip, and you can feel the care and significant thought put into every moment - from Vince Guaraldi's iconic jazz to the wonderful, natural voices of the original child actors, who were never to be matched in later versions.

A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS and IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN are well known and loved, deservedly so, but it may be, unless you're old like me, you haven't seen YOU'RE IN LOVE, HE'S YOUR DOG, IT WAS A SHORT SUMMER, or ALL STARS.  I grew up on them, even had the corresponding books.  My personal favorite would be the Snoopy-centric DOG.  But love of the little redhaired girl, the whole gang at camp and Charlie Brown's baseball woes make for clever, funny, poignant stories that are all surprisingly timeless even 40 years later.

It's true, it would have been nice if they had given us more special features - including the documentaries from earlier editions, but these are the absolute cream of the crop, the best Peanuts you're going to find.  You can skip the 70's and 80's, it was never the same again...
