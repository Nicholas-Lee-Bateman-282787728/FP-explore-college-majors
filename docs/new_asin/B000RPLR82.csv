I start my morning with my first cup of coffee and an episode of inspiration. I am housebound with a shattered heal. I can,t wait until I am heeled and try on some of the ideas your show has given me. What I like least, their are only a few seasons airing. Get some more Amazon!

8561448,2,B000RPLR82,"Very basic, not much innovation and style, but it has some good ideas sometimes.",1516665600,,80,4.785714285714286
8561449,5,B000RPLR82,"What an excellent show full of helpful information for the average homeowner AND it's entertaining. I love how the homeowners actually learn how to do the projects. It's empowering to see them involved and not just there for the ""big reveal"" at the end.",1512000000,2,253,4.7727272727272725
8561450,5,B000RPLR82,I loved this show....but Allen isn't in 20th seson though....,1507939200,4,61,5.2
8561451,1,B000RPLR82,This show used to be really good but now I cringe watching it without Allen. Let me know when you get someone back with actual personality and then Ill start watching it again.,1506297600,3,176,4.363636363636363
8561452,5,B000RPLR82,I was so happy to find Today's Homeowner on Amazon so that I can have access to all the episodes I want. I've always loved the show and it's been so helpful to me as a DIY homeowner. Danny is always engaging and full of energy and his daughter Chelsea is fantastic - it's fun to watch them tackle projects big and small. What a great show!,1505692800,3,339,4.074626865671642
8561453,5,B000RPLR82,"This show is AMAZING! Danny is so informative and easy-going. And he and his crew tackle projects for regular people on realistic budgets and timelines. I'm not super-handy, but he's given me the confidence to try new things! And I love his daughter Chlesea - girls with tool belts ROCK!",1505433600,4,287,4.76

8561455,2,B000RPLR82,"I found the Danny Lipford series to be hit and miss.  Some topics, such as ""Common Exterior Repairs"" will show you how to inspect and fix a gutter, provided you live in a one-story house with gutters not too far off the ground.

Other Lipford topics, such as ""Walls and Ceilings,""  may leave you feeling as though you are nothing more than an observer when Danny Lipford narrates video of ""Mark and his team"" of four or more GROWN, PROFESSIONAL, MEN racing through the remodeling of a living room in a few days' time. For instance, you will be told that their ""fininshing man"" mixes ""several"" kinds of drywall mud, but the most you will see is a paper bag with the name ""Sheetrock"" on it. You'll be left reseaching Sheetrock on your own, elsewhere, provided you were observant and able to catch the name from seeing the paper bag. Don't make the mistake of thinking you, yourself, are going to match the speed and efficiency of a team of professionals making slick, edited, programs for distribution. Realize that their two men -- shown lifting drywall to the ceiling and nailing it into place -- may make things look quick and easy, but you, grandmpa, may need a special, rented piece of equipment to help you do the same, or you may need to visit Gold's Gym to enlist some pumped-up volunteers, or both.

They also seem to breeze over trouble spots. For instance, on the exterior repairs DVD, they remove a shingle and then replace that shinge after their repair. It was so quick and easy.

But why oh why upon replacement does that same shingle seem to be a darker color than when they ""removed"" it? I suspected that, off camera, they discarded the orginal, worn-out shingle, and went to the big box store for replacements. Why not just say so, if that was the case? Maybe it's because they didn't go to the big box store and buy just one shingle; Maybe it would be like going to the grocery store to buy just one slice of bread.

So, please don't buy these DVDs with the idea that you'll suddenly become enlightened and empowered to do things on your own. They seem to be made for entertainment purposes while you sit on the couch eating your pizza and watching the screen.

Also, it appears there is only one , actual, half-hour episode per DVD, plus some additional short-topic home repair items thrown in. Don't expect to find several half-hour programs on the same DVD, as is the case with other sets of DVDs of television programs. The Lipford DVDs remind me of a bowl of chicken noodle soup I once received at a restaurant: It was a big bowl of salty water with one noodle and no chicken. I still had to order a real meal elsewhere. With home repairs, you may find you need to order more information, elsewhere.",1222473600,2,2721,4.50709939148073
