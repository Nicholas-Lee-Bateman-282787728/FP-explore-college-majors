7904035,4,B000006C9K,"Here's a quiet, understated film about the friendship between two adolescent girls during World War II. One is Patience, a somewhat gawky but bright & friendly English girl; the other is Laura, a lovely & sophisticated German refugee. Their story is tender, bittersweet, punctuated by brief moments of terror & grief.

Like all new students, Laura has trouble fitting in once she starts school; and making it worse is the fact that she's German, which turns her into an easy target. But her friendship with Patience enables her to become one of the girls ... almost. There's always some unexpected reminder of the war to set her apart once more.

And there's something else going on as well. When Laura's father is interned for a time, she finds herself responsible for her emotionally fragile mother. Add to that the fact of her brother's ardent embrace of the Nazi cause, which has made their father disown him. Torn in too many directions, in over her head, Laura is desperately lonely & aching for comfort.

Patience & Laura have something of a crush on each other, as many girls their age do ... but Laura clearly has genuine feelings for Patience. What follows is a gentle but insightful exploration of the fluid nature of love, loneliness, and budding sexuality during adolescence. The lesbian subtext is circumspect. Much is left unsaid, unseen; but this actually makes the emotional impact all the more moving in the end.

The film itself is a lovely evocation of the period, never overdoing the historical detail by calling too much attention to it. Instead, it simply presents the characters against a normal, everyday background. They're not living ""in history,"" so to speak. They just living right now, with ""now"" being the 1940s.

The two young actresses are convincing & natural, attractive but not too beautiful. They're adolescent girls, not models. The wonderful Jenny Agutter has a small supporting role as a teacher, and former Bond girl Claudine Auger is very good as Laura's overly dramatic (but sad) mother.

While this territory has been covered before, it's especially well done in this small film. It might have been a bit tighter & more dramatic, particularly if the producers wanted to make a bigger splash when it came out ... but its meandering style really seems to suit it. A DVD release is long overdue -- highly recommended!",1234828800,4,2358,4.9120603015075375

There's a  scene that could be viewed as leading up to a intimate moment between them,  and I always wondered if the climax of the movie didn't have something to  do with the intimacy of their relationship, as well as with the Nazi  brother.
I first saw this movie when I was coming out in 1986, and  because there were no real lesbian movies at the time, this movie made a  huge difference to me.",957312000,8,673,4.512396694214876
