7925402,3,B00004WIEO,"In some indefinite future scenario, society is divided into two groups: an evil, tech-savvy, militaristic elite and the remainder, who look and act like Eastern Europeans from the 19th century.  The story is told mainly from the point of view of two young village women, Shira (Nicole Nieth) and pickpocket Ariel (Kate Rodger), who, along with other women, are forced into slave labor in the dreaded Hell Mountain mines. (The fact that they do not recruit big husky men to do the job is somewhat explained by the fact that there is a weight restriction on who gets drafted).
Shira's boyfriend attempts to spring her from the mountain prison by enlisting the help of the last of the 'teachers', apparently the only non-elite holdout left who is acquainted with the fine arts of shooting guns, blowing things up, and using high-tech equipment.
However, the flick works best when the women are on the screen.  Like most WIP films, this one features lesbianism, a sadistic female overseer (who takes a whip to Ariel), the mandatory 'hose-down', and a snarly queen bee (portrayed in over-the-top fashion by Sarah Douglas, in the kind of role she was born to play). But these gals don't just loll around in their make-up and Frederick's of Hollywood outfits--they've got work to do.  The film presents gritty images of every detail of the women's arduous manual labor (although why such a high-tech society can't use more sophisticated mining methods is never explained).  Oh well, all the better to catch liberal glimpses of female flesh through the holey, ragged work clothes they are issued.
Unfortunately, the movie falls short when it comes to the breakout attempt.  The ending seems rushed and cheap, as if the production crew started to run out of money and time near the end of filming.  So viewers don't get the big emotional payoff we've been waiting for.
The settings also seems oddly out of joint.  'Hell Mountain', when seen at a distance, resembles the opening credits background painting for Paramount Pictures (can they get sued for that?).  Close up, the outside of the mountain looks like a cheesy school science project.
Still, the inside of the mine is appropriately cramped, and makes a sharp contrast to the cavernous passages of the evil overlords. The lead actresses are appealing (especially Kate Rodger), and I give the flick credit for being different.  Just don't mistake it for a Pam Grier epic.",1186099200,12,2418,4.935960591133005
7925403,5,B00004WIEO,"I agree with the other reviewer, this is a good film and dealing with a sensitive subject of white slavery which is now politically incorrect in entertainment, but nonetheless has a huge following as one of those guilty pleasures.

For those who are tired of having to stay within politically correct barriers and enjoy this genre and high level of production quality and good acting, check out [...] website that carries plenty more of these from the same production group.",1140566400,13,474,4.925
7925404,5,B00004WIEO,"Chained Heat III Hell Mountain is about a man who wants to free his lover from Hell Mountain.  Which is quite well and is fast going.  So you do not get a total inside look at Hell Mountain.  Just a person trying to save his girlfriend.

I picked up Bound Heat Caged Rage by the same film studio.  They used a lot of the scenes.  More background into the story.  And, was much better.  Where everyone thrieves for power except for a thief which wants one thing freedom.  It had more of an inside look at what was going on in Hell Mountain.  And, they left the ending out of Hell Mountain out of this and ended with a cliffhanger.  Those who like Chained Heat III a must to have from the Bound Het Series, Caged Rage.

But, by no means is Hell Mountain in the Chained Heat Series.  I wonder if it was to please the US Fan Base to name it into the Chained Heat Series.  For those who love Chained Heat.

And, there are not a lot of post apoloyptic prison films.  But, Chained Heat III Hell Mountain and with it's best inside version Bound Heat Caged Rage.  This prison film shows with no doubt a very sensitive subject which most film industries try to avoid and that is white slavery.

For those buying this film I suggest you to find Bound Heat Caged Rage then you will have a much more appreciation of this film.",1139961600,2,1313,4.204819277108434
7925405,1,B00004WIEO,"Undeservedly overlooked at this year's Oscars, this is actually a retitling of a film called 'Hell Mountain', and has all the hallmarks of a  tedious cash-in. You'd be half right; while nothing to do with the 1983  classic, as post-apocalyptic soft-porn B-movies go, it's not at all bad.  And, believe me, I've seen enough to know how bad it *can* get.  Fortunately, CH3 is set in a future where fertiliser and guns are in  short-supply, but civilization still has an abundant supply of thongs and  hair-stylists. The plot/excuse has a village exchanging their nubile young  girls with an evil (and disfigured, natch) man who runs the fertiliser  mine. This peeves one of the boyfriends, who looks like Kyle McLachlan, but  sadly possesses none of the quirky wit. Oh, and all teachers bar one have  been exterminated.",969062400,5,817,4.9411764705882355
