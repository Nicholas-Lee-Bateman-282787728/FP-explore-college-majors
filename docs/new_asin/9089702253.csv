7901353,5,9089702253,"Another high quality release from The Ambient Collection.
Very nice locations but can be a little tedious, not much scenery or variation.
The sunset walk is lovely.
Some of the beaches are under water.
Occasionally you see birds and gulls which add interest.
There are 3 audio tracks to choose from.
One features very close water sounds, another has the water more distant and subtle winds, the other choice has much more turbulent wind which I find disconcerting. This combined with cloudiness makes me feel like I am stuck in the middle of nowhere with an approaching storm!

Overall a very relaxing, very soothing DVD.",1488240000,3,621,4.914285714285715
7901354,2,9089702253,"I wish I had heeded the other reviews before purchasing this video.  Almost everything you see is sand--I want to see the water.  You can see a tiny bit of water in the upper corner, even in the ""Rolling Waves"" section.  I did like the sunset walk because the colors are so beautiful.  I also liked the fact that when one segment finishes, another begins instead of the first one repeating.",1473552000,2,390,4.450704225352113
7901355,5,9089702253,"This DVD is perfect for a workout with a treadmill. I have also used the DVD with my exercise bike and even with the use of an exercise bike it is great fun. You have the choice between different videos so that you can also work out in the sunset or also at a shell beach. This DVD makes it possible that you can combine relaxation and your workout all in one. I especially liked that in every video you have the choice of three different background noises. Thus, on this DVD there is something for everybody. I can only recommend the DVD.",1446249600,,539,4.242718446601942
7901356,5,9089702253,"A fantastic dvd!!! The beaches are in Australia, and feel so real!! Buy it, you won't regret it!",1424217600,2,96,4.388888888888889
7901357,4,9089702253,"I do wish this video had more palm tree lined beaches or more scenic beaches, other than that, this video is a great way to escape the winter blues. What better way to inspire you to stay in bikini shape in the dead of winter?",1390867200,4,226,4.044444444444444
7901358,3,9089702253,"These videos were okay but, nothing beats running outdoors. The beach video was disappointing.  The forest selections became boring. My opinions of course.",1387929600,,155,5.739130434782608
7901359,4,9089702253,"This is a nice scenic video, but I wish it had more people or animals to break up the view and give you something to keep you motivated to move ahead. The scenery is pretty and the sound is nice, but it's a little boring after the first time.",1384387200,2,242,3.9591836734693877
7901360,4,9089702253,"Excellent but I think it needs more flavor, is a little monotone. Maybe needs a more tropical beach. Thanks Fitness Journeys!",1381104000,,125,5.0
7901361,4,9089702253,"First of all, let me say that I love the ""Fitness Journeys"" from The Ambient Collection! They are all interesting changes from TV. I love nature and cannot always get outside to enjoy it. This collection takes me there, wherever I choose to go. This particular one is a bit disappointing though. Please don't misunderstand! This is a wonderful, beautiful stroll along the beach, but leaves me feeling a bit unsatisfied for some reason. I believe it is because there is too much sand and not enough ocean. I keep wanting to look out to the horizon and see the waves rolling in. Instead there is a wide view of sand with a narrow view of the waves washing in on the beach. It also seems as though the camera was too high. At one point, I met a couple strolling along and felt that I was looking down at them. As I am 5'3"" this seems unrealistic. Also, on the ""Shell Beach"" sequence, there are no close-up views of the shells. I would like to ""stop and investigate"" some of them. Again, a closer-to-the-ground view is needed. There are three soundtracks to choose from, but nothing really distinguishes one from the other. All three are waves washing in and occasional gulls calling. There is no music at all. Perhaps a music option would be nice for some people. Part of the tracks has the water to my left and part of them is filmed with the water to my right. At some points I passed flocks of sea gulls and could hear them calling. This is beautiful! The speed of the camera seems to match my stride no matter what speed I set my treadmill or elliptical to. I don't feel that it is dragging behind or that I have to rush to keep up. All in all, a BEAUTIFUL JOURNEY! I can definitely feel the spray on my face and the sand between my toes!",1301702400,6,1739,4.321100917431193
7901362,1,9089702253,This was a very boring dvd.  90% of the screen was a flat sandy beach that almost matched the sky. You could hardly see the water (less than 10% or a tiny corner of the screen) and the water and sky were not a vabriant blue (use to seeing this since I live in Hawaii).  It would have been nice to have some music mixed in with the waves.  It was hard to tell if you were moving because the sand was the same color and no interesting textures to see. Save your money.  I'm going to try another product instead...will let you know if I find something better to see when you are on your treadmill.,1299196800,8,594,4.051282051282051
