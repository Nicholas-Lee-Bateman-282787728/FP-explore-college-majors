7733774,4,B01E9MIPOM,"Like the earlier seasons released by CBS, these DVDs have not been digitally remastered, so the images are somewhat fuzzy and a bit dark, though I think some color correction has been done compared to seasons 1 to 3 since season 4 seems to have slightly less saturated color - not a bad thing. The sound, though, has obviously been worked on because the overall level is very high, and it is quite clear and crisp. My little home theater subwoofer can make my chest vibrate on these with some of the low notes and it can simulate surround sound very well, which requires clean sound input. Kudos on that. It is just a shame that further video cleanup wasn't done. The shows themselves are typical Cannon, entertaining, sometimes a bit of a stretch plot-wise, with many of the usual '70s guest actors. Season 4 starts with ""Kelly's Song"" featuring the lovely Stephanie Powers, always one of my favorites, at the height of her powers. Overall this is very enjoyable.",1468454400,,964,4.676470588235294

8758162,5,B01E9MIPOM,"Finally all the seasons were released but paid an arm and a leg to get the first few seasons. The video transfer was done poorly in my opinion as when viewing in on my HD television it looks like a homemade VCR recording but when I watch it on one of my CRT televisions, it looks decent and no, I did not expect Cannon to be remastered in HD. Lastly, glad I got mine from amazon when it was $22,00 as a few days later the price shot up to $36.00! Heck, I could buy the entire series, seasons 1-5 for $66.00 now, I paid that just for season 1 and 2!",1470787200,,548,3.9017857142857144
