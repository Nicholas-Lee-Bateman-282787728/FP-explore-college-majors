8403129,4,B003R3JNTG,"Great movies! But there missing the second film Shiloh Season in the set. Like that they tried to put out a Blu-Ray release, but why not put a full Shiloh Blu-Ray trilogy out. It makes no sense really to really. I would suggest buy the DVD package they got on here or maybe someone else got it at a better price, but anyway that way u get all 3 films in 1 pack. I like the movies though no complaints there just packaging.",1439337600,,422,4.096385542168675
