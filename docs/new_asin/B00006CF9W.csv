8323751,4,B00006CF9W,"I practiced yoga for about 5 years before being diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing chemo, mastectomy, and radition.  My yoga teacher trained with Esther Myers and lent me this video.  I found it very worthwhile to have her guide me through the poses that are helpful for the specific issues resulting from breast cancer treatment.  And, I needed a much gentler practice than I was used to, so having a tape to follow was very helpful.  Esther clearly had a huge level of both knowledge of yoga and compassion for women undergoing treatment.  This tape is useful for anyone who has had breast cancer treatments and especially if you have no previous yoga experience.",1250294400,5,674,4.826086956521739
8323752,3,B00006CF9W,"Diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at age 40, I underwent a lumpectomy and, when it was discovered I had multiple tumors, a mastectomy and chemotherapy.  Surgery caused range of motion issues in my arm and, in an effort to rehab myself, I  bought both Esther Myers' Gentle Yoga for Breast Cancer Survivors and Susan Rosen's ""Yoga and the Gentle Art of Healing - A Journey of Recovery After Breast Cancer.""  Both women had undergone breast cancer treatment themselves and therefore could relate to viewers limitations and concerns.  I believe that Ms. Myers has since passed away and perhaps that is why several Amazon sellers now have this video priced so high ($80??? Get real!!).  Both Ms. Myers' video and Ms. Rosens' video demonstrate many of the same moves.  Ms. Myers practice takes place in her studio in Canada as she instructs several other women in the various poses.  Ms. Rosen's video is shot in a variety of outdoor settings and she practices the poses by herself (I believe she does have a studio in California though).  There is no background music in Ms. Myers' video; Ms. Rosen's includes musical pieces that I think were written by a friend.  Ms. Myers' video was longer than Ms. Rosens, which some people may find preferable (although if you are in treatment, you may be tired and shorter may be more doable at first).  I believe either video can be of benefit during recovery, but you probably don't really need both.  I ended up donating my copy of Ms. Myers video to the library and keeping Ms. Rosen's to use because I found the outdoor settings more visually appealing and the background music more soothing.  I'm happy to say that I was eventually able to overcome my range of motion issues and I credit practicing some of the techniques from the videos with assisting me.",1141776000,7,1800,4.752411575562701
