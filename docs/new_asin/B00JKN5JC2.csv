6373266,3,B00JKN5JC2,"The 1st comic- Henry Welch SUCKED, his funniest ""ALMOST"" joke was a vulgar ""knock-knock"" joke.... The 2nd comic- Lil Rel was okay, he at least got the crowd involved, even though he ran out of material....  The 3rd comic- Deon Cole was funny, even though he CONTINUALLY referred to women as b*tches & h#es, at least his routine was funny to the audience.... The last comic- DeRay Davis was also funny, even though he followed the same pattern as Deon Cole....  Mike Epps was okay as the host.  His style of comedy is a cross-between D.L. Hughley & Richard Pryor; except Mike Epps has VERY LIMITED RANGE and HE HAS ""NO STORY-TELLING SKILLS"" whatsoever.... He's basically a club-scene comedian, who can act in a good comedy movie every now & then....",1405814400,3,748,4.694656488549619
6373267,2,B00JKN5JC2,"The comedy was more vulgar than funny. In fact Henry Welch kept complaining no one was laughing. The stage was far too hot as sweat poured off the entertainers. There was plenty of use of the MF bomb, n-word, ho, and b@#$%. Women in the audience with cleavage were asked to stand up. Michael Epps was a lousy host. Deon Cole and DeRay Davis seemed to have an actual routine. Both were crude with Deon being my favorite in a comedy jam I failed to laugh at.

Excuse me. I am old and white.",1405728000,2,488,4.191489361702128
