8664818,5,B00LADLYH4,"Everything Heidi Songs does is awesome! There are catchy jingles and motions for dozens of sight words on this DVD. I love that the songs emphasize spelling the words, not just identifying them. I highly recommend this product, as well as her Sounds Fun DVD, which focus on phonics/digraphs like ch, sh, aw, in addition to her Letter sounds DVD, which has songs and movement for each letter of the alphabet.",1481328000,,407,4.746478873239437
