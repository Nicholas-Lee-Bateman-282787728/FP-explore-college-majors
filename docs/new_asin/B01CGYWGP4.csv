8752975,3,B01CGYWGP4,"Saw it in a theater. La Vache is a French comedy describing Fatah, an Algerian peasant from an obscure village, whose dream is to take his beloved cow Jacqueline to the Paris agricultural fair and competition. With the help of his fellow villagers, Jacqeline and Fatah cross the Mediterranean and start walking across France to Paris. Fatah meets many good people who help him and love his good humor and innocence, while he becomes a TV and Web celebrity and his progress is watched by millions in France, and also by his native village.  Will he make the competition? Will Jacqueline win? You'll have to watch the movie to find out. I had a few laughs and enjoyed Fatsah Bouyahmed acting Fatah, but for the most of it one gets the feeling that one has seen this movie many times. In a nutshell it is blow-by-blow a paralel to The World Fastest Indian. Both heroes cross the sea (or the ocean) to get their beloved possession (the cow Jacqeline or the antique Indian motocycle) for a world-class competition, both get financially helped by their compatriots, both meet with sometimes serious and often funny obstacles, both encounter romantic possibilities, both have to get to the competition at the last minute (and are denied entrance). Morevoer, both heroes project good humor, perseverance, and their unjaded naivete  presents simple wisdom that puts the convoluted and frantic West way of life to true test. Despite these superficial similarities, The World Wld Fastest Indian is an intelligent, refined and meaningful humorous drama. Although Bouyahmed is endearing, he is a far shot from Anthony Hopkins. And last, but far from least, Jacqueline is just a cow, whereas the Indian bike has a soul. A harmless small movie, OK for early teens and those that would like to go back to that age.",1488931200,,1798,4.872549019607843
