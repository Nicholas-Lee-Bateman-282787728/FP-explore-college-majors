8495153,4,B00697YE8M,"Charlie Boorman seems to be a great guy, and he loves motorcycles and many other means of transport to discover new people and new faces around the globe. If you have seen his other motorcycle videos with his buddy Ewan McGregor, you will miss the friendly banter and camaraderie between these two guys, as in this video Charlie goes it alone for the most part.",1394064000,2,361,4.569230769230769
8495154,5,B00697YE8M,"After a friend introduced me to the Long Way Round/Down.  I just had to see what Mr Boormans adventures were like in Canada.  The country side was just wonderful,  and like always Charlies humor put everything over the top.  If your are a bike rider or any style I recommend all of the Boorman and Mcgregor DVD.  Hopefully sometime in 2013 I can make a trip to Alberta on my 2012 1200 RT.  Happy trails.",1355875200,7,403,4.306666666666667
