8167953,5,6303094775,"MODEL BY DAY (1994) stars the astonishingly beautiful Famke Janssen (LORD OF ILLUSIONS, HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL) as Lex, the supermodel of the title. After her roommate is assaulted, Lex sets out to find those responsible. Under the tutelage of Master Chang (Clark Johnson), Lex dons her disguise, hunts down the perpetrators, and takes! out! the! trash! Dubbed ""Lady X"" by the press, she quickly finds herself up against a steady stream of thugs, goons, and other assorted losers and nocturnal ne'er-do-wells. The cops are embarrassed, leading to their questioning of Lex, complete w/ a fantastic parody of BASIC INSTINCT! Lt. Eddie Walker (Stephen Shellen) falls for her, while trying to solve a death that seems to have been caused by Lady X. Now, Lex must face her greatest challenge, in the form of Russian mobsters, out for vengeance! Can she maintain a new relationship, while simultaneously taking on organized crime AND discovering the identity of her diabolical doppelganger? Highly entertaining, and filled w/ wall-to-wall Famke, MBD somehow fuses the world of high fashion and crime-fighting. It's a miracle! An adult fantasy that actually works. Co-stars Sean Young (BLADE RUNNER) as Mercedes, and Shannon Tweed as... Shannon! Watch this right this minute!...",1514160000,,1270,5.292079207920792

8167955,4,6303094775,"Vigilante plots operate within a narrow corridor and original ones are practically non-existent.  ""Model By Day"" follows the usual path, but it entertained me enough to get a favorable rating.  There's enough nudity to make it questionable for family viewing, but men will appreciate the universally well-toned bodies on display.  Acting verges on the professional and is no impediment to telling the story.  The fight scenes take place in subdued light, an aid to making them look realistic.",1508630400,,492,5.269230769230769

8167958,5,6303094775,I had a edited for TV version of this move on an old tape.  It got screwed up when I moved.  I liked this movie as a teenager.  Was glad to find it here.  Even if it was on VHS rather than DVD.,1374796800,,193,3.4186046511627906
8167959,4,6303094775,"This is a superhero movie, with a female lead.  It's great.  It's totally 80's but I think it rocks.  Lex, the main character is a model, who happens to have trained with a master and can totally kick but.  Her room mate is attacked jogging in the park and she retaliates by disguising herself and fighting bad guys when the police give her the brush off.  It's great.  There's the romantic interest, and lots of great lines.",1092528000,9,425,4.454545454545454
