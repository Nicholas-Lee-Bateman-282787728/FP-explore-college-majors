7846613,5,6303430988,"A nostalgic glimpse at cartoons before they became spoiled with VALUES and MORALITY.  Hilarious, witty, and intellectual.  I would highly recomend this video for children AND ADULTS.  Aside from it having one of the most clever carbon-based life forms starring in it (The Riddler), I admire it's well developed art deco style that covers the streets of Gotham.  In conclusion I give The Riddler: an A+!
Good for you Bruce Timm, you've done it again!",1082592000,,449,4.946666666666666
7846614,2,6303430988,"Basically, the Riddler in the Dini-produced Batman animated series is an intelligent, creative person who gets little return from his creations exploited by major corporations. The irony of Dini's pulling off this story while Time-Warner was growing and soon to join with AOL is pretty funny. The stories are pretty solid, too. Of course, Batman gets to rely on his mental acuity more in these stories, and the humbling the Riddler gets at the end makes for a satisfying time.
Just a quick note here (I've added this note to other tapes in this series I have reviewed)--while I think the Dini-produced animated Batman has been one of the hallmarks of 90s animation, I do not advise buying the tapes in this series because they are not recorded in SP mode. You will get fuzzy pictures and sound. It is a shame that these excellent programs do not get the packaging they deserve.",994723200,2,877,4.738562091503268
7846615,4,6303430988,My fav in the series. Two Face was great but the Riddler added a great tuch. In the end The Joker Has a cameo appearance as one of the inmates.,978220800,,143,3.8
7846616,4,6303430988,"The Riddler is the villainous subject of this compilation of two episodes of Warner Brothers' Batman & Robin cartoon series.  John Glover voices The Riddler and gives him the superbly intimidating air of the  intellectual.
""If You're So Smart, Why Aren't YOU Rich?"" tells  the story of the Riddler's genesis.  Bookish toy company employee Edward  Nygma is cheated out of a fortune by his boss, corporate shark Mockridge.  Vowing revenge, Nygma become The Riddler and kidnaps Mockridge, subjecting  him as well as Batman & Robin to the torture of a lifesized version of  The Riddle Of The Minotaur, a videogame that demands great intelligence in  problem-solving - a trait that Batman uses against The Riddler.  Nygma,  though, escapes, and this leads to one of the finest moments of the series  - as Bruce Wayne narrates, we see the terrified Mockridge with multiple  doorlocks and a shotgun, going to bed even though he'll be lucky to get any  decent sleep.
Eric Radomski directed this episode and is surprisingly  critical of David Wise's script.  True, the action has an over-the-top  quality and features robotic creatures straight out of Ray Harryhausen (not  really appropriate for the Batman continuity), but the animation is  unusually good and the story has far too many strong points to be so easily  dismissed.
The tape's second episode is less effective, but still has  good moments as The Riddler ""goes straight"" and licenses himself  to another toy company.
Warner Brothers again outdoes Disney and  Hanna-Barbera with this entry into animation history.",941760000,9,1567,5.130952380952381
