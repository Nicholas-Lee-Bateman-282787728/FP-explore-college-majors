436245,5,6302215927,"The most important thing to remember about this Peabody Award winning production of Saul Levitt's play ""The Andersonville Trial"" is that it was produced in 1970, during the Vietnam War.  However, the play was originally produced on Broadway in 1959, which is rather surprising because this particular version has a reputation for being a historic allegory in the grand tradition of ""The Crucible.""  In 1959 the historic parallel would have been to the Nuremberg Trials where Nazi leaders were tried as war criminals.  But in the wake of the My Lai massacre the court-martial of Capt. Henry Wirz (Richard Basehart), commandant of the infamous Andersonville prison during the Civil War it would be impossible for an audience to view this drama as anything else that a discussion of the war in Vietnam.
Henry Wirz was the only Confederate soldier to be convicted and executed for war crimes during the Civil War.  Wirz remains a controversial figure whose name is associated with some of the worst atrocities of the war by many while considered a martyr to the Glorious Cause by others.  As Union forces pushed into the South the Confederacy was ending up with more and more Union prisoners and the Andersonville Camp was created to relieve the situation in Richmond and elsewhere.  However, in June of 1864 the Union discontinued the policy of prisoner exchanges and without that avenue of release or the construction of another facility, the prisoner population of Andersonville swelled to 26,000 prisoners crammed into a little more than 26 acres.  Add to this the impoverishment of the Confederacy in the final year of the war when the 33,000 prisoners in Andersonville made it the fifth largest ""city"" in the Confederacy, and it is hardly surprising that hundreds of men were dying each day.  Of the 45,000 prisoners sent to Andersonville, 13,000 died.
Levitt used the official record of the trial of Henry Wirz as his basic source material.  While sticking to the facts, Levitt was obviously more interested in the personalities involved in the proceedings.  So while ""The Andersonville Trial"" is accurate with regards to the time and place of the trial, names of the participants, and some of the dialogue, it is still much more of a drama than a documentary.  Furthermore, as a televised stage play it is necessarily restricted to the primary set of the courtroom and the scope of its interest is pretty much restricted to that venue as well.
The pivotal character of the drama is Lt. Colonel N.P. Chipman (William Shatner in the role Scott played in the original Broadway production), the officer prosecuting Wirz (Richard Basehart), who responds to the charges against him with the defense that he was obeying orders and doing what he could under the circumstances.  This leads Chipman to the conclusion what Wirz should have done was disobey orders that would lead to the deaths of thousands of prisoners.  However, this is not an argument that an officer in the military can make lightly, and this sets up a conflict with the presiding judge, General Lew Wallace (Cameron Mitchell), who would achieve fame as the author of ""Be-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.""  But Chipman feels compelled to come up with a response to the argument that following such orders is a legitimate defense.
Shatner's performance is superb, and those who remember playing Spencer Tracy's aide in ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" can appreciate the irony of his having a larger role in this related drama.  The biggest compliment I can give Shatner's work is that I cannot imagine George C. Scott having played this role.  One of the strengths of this production is how Scott takes a collection of ""television stars"" like Shatner, Basehart, Jack Cassidy, Buddy Ebsen, Martin Sheen, John Anderson and Whit Bissell, along with veteran character actors like Mitchell and Albert Salmi, to create a stellar ensemble cast.  Just as impressive is how he has actors like Alan Hale, Jr. and Kenneth Tobey sitting as members of the Court-martial board.  For Shatner, Basehart, Cassidy, Mitchell and Salmi you will be hard pressed to find anything better on their acting resumes.
""The Andersonville Trial"" is one of the most powerful courtroom dramas you will ever see.  It has something of an advantage over the likes of ""The Caine Mutiny"" and ""A Few Good Men"" in that the play is almost entirely the trial, which makes it more like ""Breaker Morant"" and, most obviously,"" Judgment at Nuremberg.""  The drama comes down to Chipman's cross-examination of Wirz and the prosecutor's futile effort to get the prisoner in the dock to explain why he did not do the ""right"" thing and disobey his orders.  I think the net effect is to make Wirz more of a tragic figure than a monster, locked into a system of rules and beliefs that would not let him see a way out of the disaster happening before him.",1071273600,46,4851,4.905867970660147
436246,4,6302215927,"I was a teenager when this program originally aired on television, and I thought that William Shatner was merely playing the same old wildly emoting Captain Kirk that has made him the butt of so many jokes.  After a recent second screening, I see that I was probably wrong.  Shatner's prosecutor is a little over the top, but it's because his justifiable moral outrage at the defendant has caught him in a terrible trap, and forces him to ask questions that were almost unthinkable in 1865; namely, is it ever justifiable for an officer to refuse to follow orders which he judges are immoral?
The defendant, Wirz, as excellently played by Richard Basehart, is an immigrant from the European school of miltary theory, and he is by turns hateful, confused at the sudden shift in the meaning of his duty, and pathetic (Wirz is still considered something of a hero in the local area outside the present-day National Cemetery near Andersonville).  Jack Cassidy, as the defending attorney, is fully aware of the prosecutor's dilemma, and seems to be taking great pleasure in pointing up the US Army's hypocracy in trying a man for following malicious orders, yet refusing to allow that he would have been militarily justified in refusing them.  Cameron Mitchell is the presiding officer, Gen. Lew Wallace (of ""Ben-Hur"" fame), and portrays a man who is about to lose control of the proceedings through the unsettling forays of the Army's own prosecutor.  I gave the film four stars because it is a little too long and drags a bit in some places.  However, the depth of the story, and the exploration of the ethical problems dealt with in the courtroom, make it superior to a very similar movie, ""Judgment at Nuremburg.""",1061164800,18,1712,4.825938566552901
436247,5,6302215927,"Basehart, like many other television stars, was unfortunate to be associated with a long-running program (four years on ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea""). A prolific and skilled actor, Basehart is a sympathetic figure as the commandant of the infamous Georgia prison. He is allowed to show depth that the 60's Irwin Allen show of which he is associated never allowed him.
The production also features two other actors playing against type in pivotal and revealing roles, Buddy Ebsen and the late Jack Cassidy. The two match Basehart in the acting department and do justice to the George C. Scott-directed presentation.
""The Andersonville Trial"" ranks as one of the best productions ever shown on PBS.",1049155200,11,701,5.051724137931035
436248,5,6302215927,"""Andersonville Trial"" is special in more ways than one.
First and foremost, it is a damn fine production, and a very powerful stage play captured on video. Second, the play has many famous names among the cast, some of whom appear in early roles (Martin Sheen, for one). William Shatner, of course, is oddly Kirk-like, but does very well as Lt. Colonel Chipman. Richard Basehart? Wonderful, and the ultimate professional, as always. Buddy Ebsen plays a doctor. Even Alan Hale Sr., who blazed a trail of adventure in many of Errol Flynn's films, is on hand (though in a non-speaking role). None other than George C. Scott directed the enterprise, and introduces the feature in a short segment.
Another thing that makes this production unique is that it harkens back to the best of PBS, before they started worrying about ratings, hype, and marketing. Shows like ""I, Claudius"" and ""Masterpiece Theater"", among others, made their way to the network about the same time, and ""Sesame Street"" had yet to become the moneygrubbing exercise it is now (Elmo, this means YOU!). This was back when PBS really lived up to the ideals of being a Public Broadcaster, and shows like ""Andersonville Trial"" were an offshoot of those ideals. Like other PBS shows, it was the BEST the arts offered at the time; a famous cast in a dramatic play, coming right into our living rooms.
On the tape, we even get to see the old PBS logo, with ""PBS"" spelled out in that funky 60's-70's type they used to use (with the orange letter ""P""). That alone is worth the purchase price.
Hopefully a DVD will someday be released. Until then, if you can latch on to a copy of the tape, you should by all means do so. It is a dramatic telling of a famous war crimes trial, with superb acting and a moral message about war that will stay with you for some time to come.",1020816000,29,1827,4.573170731707317
436249,5,6302215927,"This is actually a videotaping of a stage play ""The Andersonville Trial"" which takes place on a single set - a courtroom shortly after the end of the Civil War.  It was directed by George C. Scott and features an absolutely excellent cast (including Martin Sheen in a very small, early part).  William Shatner and Jack Cassidy play, respectively, the prosecutor and defense counsels at the trial of Henry Wirtz, the commandant of the infamous Confederate prison camp, Andersonville.  Wirtz was the only Souutherner put on trial for ""war crimes"", and this play examines a number of moral issues on that point.

The depiction suggested the theatrical portrayal was originally a play, so in this context, that's how it looked: like a filmed play.  None the less, it was an outstanding portrayal of the post-Civil War trial of the commandant of the Confederate Andersonville prison.  It was very impressive with outstanding acting by the cast that was composed of many well-known actors, some of whom are still alive and working today.

436301,4,6302215927,"The Andersonville Trial is a film production of the trial of Captain Wirz, the Confederate Commandant of the Andersonville POW compound in Georgia, which was the largest Confederate POW camp containing Union prisoners in the entire Confederacy.  Conditions there were unspeakably bad, with foul and scarce water, insufficient food, and no shade or shelter from the elements.  Andersonville was truly hell on earth.

The Trial brings out the fact that the true originator of the Andersonville Prison, Confederate General Winder, did not survive the War.  Accordingly, the Commandant, Captain Wirz, was tried on a charge of conspiracy to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity.  As lawyers will know, conspiracy can involve a lesser burden of proof as it is a form of agency liability in which one person (i.e. Wirz) can be charged with crimes primarily committed by another so long as the conspirator intentionally committed affirmative acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.

The real question pondered by the Court in the Andersonville Trial was whether Wirz truly supported the actions of Winder, which resulted in undenied hellish conditions within the prison, or whether Wirz was essentially helpless and without resources to defy Winder's desire for harsh conditions.  There was evidence on both sides of this question, but ultimately it was impossible for Wirz to escape the facts that he, Wirz, was Commandant over what amounted to nightmarish conditions for the prisoners, beyond hope of explanation or redemption, which conditions ultimately resulted in the deaths of over 16,000 Union prisoners in the midst of what was essentially a land of plenty.

This is possibly William Shatner's most outstanding role.  Shatner has a tendency to over-act, as all Star Trek fans know.  But here this shortcoming perhaps became a virtue.  While I enjoyed and appreciate this entire production I do evaluate that the last third or so involves over-acting by both Shatner and others.

This film serves both as a fine courtroom drama and an entryway into a sad and shameful episode in American history.  RJB.",1417305600,,2110,5.244047619047619

436331,5,6302215927,"When you combine a riveting subject with an all-time great cast. great directing(George C. Scott) in a Broadway play presentation, you have the makings of a great moment in theatric history.

The subject was Andersonville, the horrific Georgia concentration camp for prisoners of war held by a weakening Confederacy during the American Civil War.  In the early part of the war, prisoners were exchanged; when that ended, places like Andersonville sprang up, overflowing with POW's that the captor(Confederacy) could barely afford to house or feed.  The result was catastrophic, with POW's dying from disease, starvation and overall neglect.  Wirz, the commandant of the camp, was ordered to hold the men.  He did so regardless of the humanitarian crises and for that, he was justifiably arrested after the war.  He was tried and justifiably executed soon after. The 'moral dilemma' of his, obeying orders or letting men return home under an oath not to return to arms, was not a conception he considered.  He had his orders and obeyed.

The cast, including William Shatner as the prosecutor, Cameron Mitchell as the judge, Richard Basehart as the defendant, and Jack Cassidy in his finest role as defense attorney, was incredible, particularly Cameron Mitchell who 'stole the show'.  In reality, General Lew Wallace(who saved Washington in 1864 and later wrote Ben-Hur) was the judge among a tribunal.  You will be stunned at the themes, which were intended to address modern (World War II, Vietnam) wars and not just the Civil War.

My only reservation of recommending this incredible drama is the price.  Like another great work, Schindler's List, another 'must see' drama, you will be moved.  However, like most cathartic presentations, you are not likely watch it again, at least not for some time.

The play itself is really a standout in story, but especially in the performances, the majority of which are by, or mostly known as t.v. actors.

There is not one bad performance and especially good are actors known for their comedy or usual ""over the top parodies"" of a character.  Here Jack Cassidy is great and Shatner captures his character in a subtle manner.  Buddy

436336,4,6302215927,"In this performance Captain Henry Wirz is put on trial for war crimes, the only soldier of the Civil War to be so tried. He is being tried for running the notorious Confederate POW camp knows as Andersonville, where Union sildiers were kept in the open under conditions which at the best of times were wretched, and at the worst were virtually genocidal. Thousands of prisoners died of exposure, disease and starvation there.

The question is, how culpable was Wirz? As a Confederate officer he was ordered to run the camp as his superior, General Winder, saw fit. He was specifically ordered to maintain conditions as they were in revenge for reported poor conditions in Union POW camps, such as the one in Elmyra NY. The inefficiency of the Confederate supply system meant rations never kept up with the number of prisoners being sent to the camp. Winder was dead. Did Wirz hold responsibility for the camp? What was his moral obligations to his fellow man? Did the survival of the men have to take precedent over keeping them imprisoned? Did his excuse of obeying orders make him not culpable for the consequences of  carrying them out?

This drama is performed very well. William Shatner is a natural as the prosecutor and Richard Basehart gives an excellent performance as Wirz himself. I found myself unable to break away from this program once it was on for ten minutes. If there is a weakness, it is in the odd makeup of the presiding general (Cameron Mitchell, I believe) which was not done very well and seemed like an unnecessary distraction.",1359849600,2,1553,4.765799256505576

436370,4,6302215927,"I believe this was Masterpiece Theater. In any case, it was a TV production of a Broadway Play that was very successful. It was directed by George C. Scott, who makes a comment at the beginning, saying that he was an actor in the play when it was on Broadway. He doesn't mention which role, but I assume he had the one filled here by William Shatner.

The defendant is Captain Henry Wirz (Richard Basehart), commander of the Confederate prison camp at Andersonville, where some 14,000 Yankee prisoners died, and many more suffered terribly under abominable conditions which are detailed in the play. Defense counsel is Otis Baker (Jack Cassidy), who does his best though he is aware of the fact that Wirz will be found guilty of war crimes and executed. The prosecutor is Lt. Col. NP Chipman (William Shatner), who does a brilliant job as a lawyer, as Shatner does as an actor. A couple of other familiar faces are Martin Sheen as Captain Williams, one of the witnesses, and Buddy Ebsen as Dr. John Bates, who had been the physician assigned to the camp, apparently more to keep records of the dead then with any hope of treating them, since he had no medical supplies.

As the testimony progresses, we get pretty horrible details of just what happened at Andersonville, but we get more: insight into the character of Captain Wirz. He was, as the defendants at Nuremberg declared, just following orders. Finally, in the last 20 minutes of the play, Wirz insists on taking the stand in his own defense (and indeed, has no other witnesses on his behalf) to try to explain why he did what he did. Chipman very effectively demolishes his defenses, both legal and psychic.

There are also numerous philosophical arguments regarding the entire immorality of the concept of such prisons, even if during a time of war.

436373,5,6302215927,"On May 10, 1970 television viewers were treated to a special presentation, an actual play. I was one of those viewers.

THE ANDERSONVILLE TRIAL's images have remained with me.  Watching this again has brought back those memories. The quality of the production is still vivid and the story just as riveting.

The trial of Captain Henry Wirz, the commandant of the Confederate Prisoner of War Camp known as Andersonville, is a look at a man who oversaw the death of 14,000 Union prisoners out of 45,000. The South Carolinian prisoner camp is aptly described as hell on earth.

You have the brilliant Richard Baseheart playing Captain Henry Wirz, a man crippled by war both physically and mentally.  Jack Cassidy plays Otis Baker, defense attorney whose performance won him an Emmy nomination. Otis Baker knows his client has no chance with the North looking for a scapegoat and vengeance.

William Shatner gives a stirring performance as Lt. Col. N. P. Chipman, Judge Advocate, the prosecutor. As the trial progresses Chipman wrestles with a question that he knows that should not be raised, yet he is determined to bring his question into this arena with possible fallout to his career.  His question is simple yet complex--why would a man allow such atrocities under his command and not defy his superior's orders?  The moral ambiguity of command and conscience becomes his passion to the consternation of the Judges, Union Generals who know that this line of questioning by Chipman is a Pandora's Box.

Cameron Mitchell gives one of his best performances as Chief Judge Lew Wallace who is weary and does not want to travel the path of Chipman.  The conversations between Wallace and Chipman are well written and laden with emotion.

Buddy Ebsen plays the camp's doctor, Dr. John Bates, whose contempt for Captain Henry Wirz is displayed in almost every sentence during his testimony.  His recitation of the death statistics is chilling.

A young Martin Sheen plays Captain Williams, the main guard for Wirz.  He is not much more than window dressing, but his presence is notable by his silence.

If you want to spend 141 minutes watching this fine production, you will not be disappointed.

One last comment:
The performance of Michael Burns as James Davidson is the most touching in the whole production.  The nineteen year old relates in a haunting fashion how it was in Andersonville.  He is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and the emotional impact he has on everyone is well done.",1298073600,7,2500,4.96875

One could never assemble such an esteemed cast today (even if many of the principals were still alive). Richard Basehart makes the defendant, Wirz, vulnerable and sympathetic, and Shatner brings his trademark bombast to a role that could easily be unlikable in lesser hands.  As the Defense Counsel, Jack Cassidy has never been better. And tying it all together is Cameron Mitchell as the Colonel presiding over the trial. Powerful writing brilliantly acted, and a true hidden treasure.",1293235200,2,647,4.863636363636363
436375,4,6302215927,"Reviewers have described the basics of this court drama. This is a very thought provoking piece, that will linger in your mind long after you are through it.
I found myself thinking on Brothers Karamazov, the chapter of the ""Grand Inquisitor"". On this chapter, Ivan Karamazov is telling his younger brother the tale of the Grand Inquisitor: Jesus Christ returns to earth on XV century Spain; when he performs the miracle of resurrecting a child, the multitude is applauding him and then Inquisition arrest him for heresy. In his cell, the silent Jesus is confronted by the old Grand Inquisitor, who reproaches the Lord about placing an unbearable responsibility upon mankind: that of free will. Nothing is more attractive but more terrible to man that free will, meaning the choice -well, not only the choice, but the moral obligation- of discerning by oneself what is wrong and what is right. The Grand Inquisitor protests than only a few man and woman, the Saints, the Chosen few are capable to take such burden. All others, the ordinary, common man, would gladly resign to exercise free will to follow the lead of anyone offering miracle, mystery or authority.
Watching the trial against Captain Wirz, and how he emotionally melts down by the end, I couldn't stop thinking he is not an evil monster but one of those ""ordinary souls"" willing to override his own free will for that of his military superiors.  Faced to the atrocities of the camp he was responsible for, his only way to justify or excuse himself for his decisions is to convince himself and the jury that he had no choice but to obey.
Also, since this is a moral question more than anything else, is the authority of the tribunal valid enough to judge this man? Being the victor authorize you to judge a defeated man in an environment full of hatred?
These and more questions make this drama still relevant today.
The production is very effective; it has the sense of intimacy and immediacy of a small theater venue. The acting is uniformly superb; seeing Richard Basehart on the final sequence is almost painful to watch; you are so involved on the play, that at no time you are thinking this is an actor doing a good job; it's only captain Wirz's final attempt of justification.

Captain Werz, the evil commandant is nobly portrayed as saying that he did not have the supplies to feed the (starving) prisoners and kicks the blame up to his superior officer, Gen. Wilder. Having seen the ""Andersonville"" (Ted Turner)movie and read about this I know that this court had been rigged against Werz and he was headed for the gallows anyway-but he had his share of the blame by personally abusing and striking prisoners. I highly recommend this as a companion to those that enjoyed the ""Andersonville"" film.",1265500800,,677,4.794871794871795

Cameron Mitchell and Jack Cassidy do a fantastic job at startling the viewers, especially with their yelling.  Even Richard Basehart's Captain Henry Wirz is sometimes guilty of that.  The anger and upset in the courtroom really do come across as genuine.

436419,5,6302215927,"Directed by George C. Scott, and starring Richard Basehart, Cameron Mitchell, Jack Cassidy, William Shatner, Martin Sheen, and Buddy Ebsen in some of their best roles ever, this stunning 1970 production was a shoo-in to win three Emmys and the Peabody Award, with Cassidy also nominated for an Emmy as Best Actor.  Filled with the kind of drama that only a real war crimes trial can generate, the play by Saul Levitt focuses on the trial of a German-born Confederate captain who was in charge of the Andersonville Prison in Georgia, where Union soldiers died at the rate of over a hundred men a day during their incarceration in 1864.  Living in overcrowded conditions without shelter, shade, clean water, or adequate food, the men became desperate, preferring to risk being shot during escape attempts to living in the squalid and unsanitary conditions of the prison.

Captain Wirz (Richard Basehart in one of his all-time best dramatic roles), was in charge of the prison and is now on trial.  His counsel, southern lawyer Otis Baker (Jack Cassidy), is highly skilled at twisting words, and brilliant at forcing the court to consider the rules of wartime engagement and the necessity of following orders.  The courtroom battles between Baker and the Union prosecutor, Col. N. P. Chipman (William Shatner, when he was young and hungry for great acting jobs), are memorable for the philosophical complexities of their arguments and the emotions with which they argue their positions.  Gen. Lew Wallace (Cameron Mitchell) is hard pressed to keep the two sides in order and arguing relevant legal issues.

Buddy Ebsen, a fine actor who does not deserve to be remembered primarily for ""Beverly Hillbillies,"" is the doctor who worked at the prison for eight months, a man who shows how his compassion gradually became dulled by the horrors of the conditions, until he became inured to the hundreds of deaths he had to certify every day.  Michael Burns as James Davidson, a nineteen-year-old Vermont soldier who was incarcerated at Andersonville, shows the traumatic effects of his experiences as he testifies, his role becoming one of the most sympathetic in the entire play.

George C. Scott, as director, gets the finest performances possible from these actors and wrings the play of every moment of drama.  The tension is so great that viewers will easily sit through the two-and-a-half hour performance, breathless with anticipation, their emotions soaring with the legal points made by the prosecution and soaring equally with the human feelings engendered by the defense. As Chipman says, ""I'd  like to believe that I am more of a man than Wirz was to save those men, but am I?""  One of the finest productions ever done by Broadway Theatre Archive, this is a performance not to be missed by lovers of theatre and anyone interested in Civil War history.

436421,5,6302215927,"When was the last time you saw REAL acting?

I remembered this PBS production vividly as when I saw it, ahem, 37 years ago!!  It harkens back to William Shatner's acting on The Twilight Zone, before he became almost a parody of himself (that record album) or a brand name (for Priceline).

Yes, there is real acting here, including a portrayal of post-traumatic stress disorder (before it was an official diagnosis)...the real stars are Cassidy and Shatner, but Shatner really outshines them all.  When he comes to conclude that perhaps this really is a sham trial, and that soldiers following orders cannot and should not be put on trial, that the ""evidence"" against Wirz is flimsy at best (or at least as the trial preparation went).  The young Lt. Col. J.A. realizes that he is effectively killing a man for his government as well as a musket ball could.  ""I was only following orders"" is not offered as a defense, as it would years later for equally abhorrent war crimes.  Today, ""rules of engagement"" have replaced direct orders as the ultimate arbiters, making such political prosecutions much easier to mount.

There is no doubt that Andersonville was a horrible place--and place confining humans in a small space will ultimately become a place of disease, demoralization, and desecration.  However, the focus of this trial rings as relevant today as it did in the height of the Vietnam War.  Can a soldier disobey an order as ""immoral""?  As John F. Kennedy said of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, ""Victory has many fathers, while defeat is an orphan.""  One can easily see that in a room full of Generals, Colonels, in their glamorous uniforms, the Victors, one defeated Captain hardly stood a chance of exoneration in a time of bitter conflict and martial law.

No special effects, no camera shifting, no profanity or racial slurs, just excellent acting, and well worth the price of admission.",1177545600,2,1902,4.851393188854489

436423,5,6302215927,"Watching this fine, engrossing production (why don't they make films like this any more?) left me strangely depressed.  First I will state why I think it was so good....several well-known television actors put in outstanding performances: (1) William Shatner as the prosecutor, Col. Chipman.  Shatner is an uneven performer, and he indeed starts out a little shakey in this one, but towards the end, when Chipman decides to risk his own career, after being warned by Chief Judge Gen. Wallace, he decides to throw caution to the wind and directly address the defendent's (Capt. Wirz) moral culpability in carrying out immoral orders without question, Shatner comes out full force with an outstanding performance.

(2) Richard Basehart, as Capt. Wirz who at first seems to be a victim of ""victor's justice"", loses control of himself and emotionally destroys himself in front of the court as he hysterically describes his futile attempts to prevent the starving, abused Union prisoners from trying to burrow out of the camp ""like rats"". (3) Jack Cassidy as defense attorney Otis Baker.  Cassidy was a truly outstanding actor, and he plays the  part beautifully, knowing when to badger a weak witness, but gently probing uncertainties in the testimony of a badly traumatized young survivor of Andersonville, without abusing him.  (4) Cameron Mitchell, as Chief Judge General Wallace, who initially resists any attempt to call Wirz to account for his failure to disobey orders in the name of humanity, but is painfully forced to admit that the Wirz's moral universe must be explored, even at the expense of questioning military discipline.

Director George C Scott, in a filmed introduction, alludes to ""current events"" in the 1970 production, which is the War in Vietnam, and more specifically, the My Lai atrocities carried out by American soldiers who were confronting an enemy who hid among the  civilian population.  Frankly, I don't know exactly how good the comparison between William Calley, who was  charged with committing the atrocity, and Wirz was, because Wirz was in charge of enemy prisoners were were basically helpless, whereas in Vietnam, the American soldiers  were confronting

an active enemy who was deliberately dragging a civilian population into the conflict.

In any event, as I stated above, I felt depressed at the end, because hearing of the horrors at Andersonville and Wirz's ultimate indifference

to the suffering he oversaw, reminded me of much more recent horrors, from the Holocaust, Stalin's Gulag, Pol Pot and Mao Tse-tung's mass terror and concentration camps, not to mention numerous others.

I kept reminding myself, that THIS WAS AMERICANS DOING THESE HORRIBLE THINGS TO EACH OTHER...people who had been part of the same nation, spoke the same language and had the same religions.  How much easier was it for the Germans to dehumanize the Jews and commit unspeakable crimes against them, or for Stalin to turn on ""the Kulaks"" or ""counterrevolutionaries"" or ""Trotskyites"" or whatever.  What hope is their for mankind if it is so easy to take a normal person and in a short period of time turn him into an either passive or active, unfeeling killing machine?  Food for thought.",1171152000,3,3212,5.144230769230769
436424,5,6302215927,"This fascinating drama has relevance for today's audiences in terms of the questions it poses. However, as others have pointed out, it is best appreciated in the context of the times in which it was written (1959) and produced (1970). Of course, the original piece on which the televised production is based invites direct parallels with the Nuremberg Trials, which is what the author, Saul Leavitt, obviously intended. However, with the My Lai massacre having engendered worldwide outrage in 1968, George C. Scott took considerable risks with his interpretation, clearly presenting Henry Wirz, the Swiss-German Commandant of the Andersonville prison, as the same kind of ""scapegoat"" he obviously felt Second Lieutenant William Calley, Jr. represented.

Taking into account everything now known about the role Wirz really played in the atrocities for which Andersonville was notorious (mirrored at northern Civil War prison camps later in the war), it's difficult to watch this production without seeing it as a highly dated period piece. Andersonville is now recognized to have been little more than a death camp, where thousands of men were left to die in the open air of starvation and disease. One crucial piece of evidence brought against Wirz at trial is that he explicitly blocked an effort on the part of the local civilian population to provide food, medicine and other supplies to the Union prisoners. That he attempted to blame his superiors in Richmond for his cruelty with the I-only-followed-orders argument should come as no surprise and, of course, presages one of the central questions at the heart of the Nuremberg trials. Although the reasons why prisoner exchanges stopped after a certain point in the Civil War are indeed complicated, one thing is certain: Today it would be impossible to portray Henry Wirz as anything other than the monster he was. This was not a man who was persecuted for his immigrant status, as he tried to assert. Casting Richard Basehart in this role in 1970, therefore, can only be viewed as Scott's attempt to portray Wirz as a sympathetic character and Basehart engages in a fair amount of scenery-chomping for the purpose.

Also in the spirit of the times is the fact that it was the actor who played the defense counsel, not William Shatner as the prosecutor, who won the major award for the production--back in the days when defenders were our cultural heroes. The accolades, however, are not due to the leads, but to the supporting cast, who portrayed a panoply of unforgettable characters, most notably a young, shell-shocked survivor of the camp and a tough, cynical mercenary.

One sees how television production values have changed in forty-three years when watching this piece. Without a single flashback scene, it never takes the viewer more than a few feet from the courtroom, but somehow manages to convey a lingering sense of horror in connection with a war that has been romanticized like no other.",1139616000,,2961,5.075975359342916
436425,5,6302215927,"Just after the Civil War and only weeks after the assassination of then President Lincoln, a war crimes trial was held to prosecute the Captain in charge of Andersonville Prison wherein nearly 14,000 soldiers died in terrible and inhumane conditions in Georgia. This Television drama, directed by George C. Scott (Patton) was one of the best ever to appear on the tube. The country was going through Vietnam and all of the implications that the war had influenced on the American psyche, and this play hits home on war issues even though it concerns the American Civil War. Cameron Mitchell is great and we get a performance from Jack Cassidy (one of the two guests ever to appear on Columbo 3 times)that was nominated for outstanding single performance by an actor in a leading role in this play as the Defense Lawyer. Richard Basehart as the defendant is also very impressive and the whole play is full of interesting testimony. Fans will remember the early appearance of Martin Sheen in a small role and the legendary Captain Kirk, William Shatner,doing his Kirkus-Maximus in the lead role of the prosecution. It is a long play and perhaps should be viewed over two evenings so that you don't fall asleep and miss something important.
