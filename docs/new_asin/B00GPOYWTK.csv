6097952,4,B00GPOYWTK,"This is an adorable Peter Rabbit DVD featuring Peter and his friends in seven cute episodes.  The show is one we tend to miss on Nickelodeon so it is nice to have a bunch of episodes on one DVD to watch whenever we want! There are great lessons in the show that are easy enough for young kids to understand, and it is a nice break from the same ole' animation of other shows.

Episodes include:

The Tale of the Start of Spring
The Tale of the Secret Treehouse
The Tale of Benjamin's Strawberry Raid
The Tale of the Mystery Plum Thief
The Tale of the Dash in the Dark
The Tale of the One Who Got Away
The Tale of the Runaway Kites",1392422400,25,630,4.064516129032258

I find my son giggling hysterically over some of the things the fox says (including his facial gestures) or, the silly situations the rabbits get themselves into. While Peter Rabbit might not be classified as educational its actually hugely beneficial at his age (25 months), as he is learning new words and hes so excited to tell me about the episode. However, I do wonder how long it will keep him entertained for. There is only so much a rabbit an get up to!",1486166400,2,546,4.525252525252525
