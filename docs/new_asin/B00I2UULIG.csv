6247460,4,B00I2UULIG,"I saw Nymphomaniac volumes I and II for the same reason I think many people will: too see what all the buzz was about. I'm not a professional reviewer - I cannot comment on the technical achievements of the film or claim any real knowledge of Lars Von Trier or his style. I am simply someone who enjoys watching movies. Therefore, I can only speak for the average Joe's that may decide to watch this.

Nymphomaniac is not an easy film to watch. It tackles taboo subjects, it's unpleasant at times, and it has (predictably) tons of sex, nudity, and violence. This film is NOT for the faint of heart. That said, it is interesting, it is thought-provoking, and it is ambitious. It's the kind of film you'll walk away from saying, ""okay, I want to talk about this now"" At it's heart Nymphomaniac appears to be a film that isn't so much about sex as it is about challenging society's preconceived notions of how women should approach sex.

Volume I is the more lighthearted of the two volumes and I think the more entertaining volume to watch. It explores the main character Joe's sexuality from the time she is a small child into early adulthood. Volume II takes a decidedly darker turn as the constraints of adulthood and responsibility start to conflict with Joe's uncontrollable desires and urges.

My honest recommendation - if you cannot go into this movie with an open mind then don't watch it at all. It's the only way I think anyone will be able to appreciate the message the movie is trying to convey. Nymphomaniac is bold, it's controversial, and it's honestly a really, really good film.",1404345600,7,1594,4.625441696113074
6247461,4,B00I2UULIG,"It was quite the surprise when my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati announced last week that it would be showing this (both Vol. I and II), starting this weekend and only for one week. I saw Vol. I yesterday, and Vol. II today, and have posted my reviews of each of them under the separate Vol. I and Vol. II listings here on Amazon.

This particular combo set brings you the two Volumes in one handy package. Vol. I runs 118 min. and Vol. II runs 123 min, hence the total running time for this combo-pack is correctly listed at 241 min. There are no bonus materials of any kind on this release. If that is what you are intending to buy, by all means, go for it.

However, if you think you've seen all of Nymph()maniac with these two movies, you are mistaken. Nymph()maniac was originally shot as a 5 1/2 hr. movie. For various reasons, Von Trier's production company decided to release the movie into most international markets (including US theatres) as a two-parter of 2 hrs. each, with the intent of releasing the full 5/12 hr. movie at some point later in 2014 (presumably directly on DVD/Bly-ray), and supposedly with lots more explicit scenes deemed too daring for the theatrical release.

Bottom line: just make sure that what you are buying is in line with your expectations. If you just want Nymph()maniac Vol. I and II as you saw it in the theater or on Amazon Instant Video, this combo-pack will do the trick. If however you want the full running time as originally intended by writer-director Lars Von Trier, you should hold out until that ""Director's Cut"" is released (supposedly) later in 2014.",1404000000,246,1618,4.611111111111111
6247462,5,B00I2UULIG,"Nine Things about the Movie Nymphomaniac [Denmark, 2013]

1. This is the third film Lars von Triers Depression Trilogy, after Antichrist and Melancholia. Its a 4-hour movie that was released in theaters in two parts. The original version is over 5 hours long, but, as of the time of this writing, has never been released anywhere. Its the most straightforward and easily understood of the three films, but it still requires focus, stamina, and an open mind.

2. While all three films can be seen as stand-alone films, they should be seen in order, as Nymphomaniac shares the casts of the first two movies, and brings the themes full circle. There are several explicit references to Antichrist in this movie.

3. Charlotte Gainsbourg returns once again in the third episode, exposing herself in new and humiliating ways. This time, she plays a sex addict that is found beaten in the street by a kindly, intellectual old man who brings her home. She tells her life story to him.

4. The movie makes the claim that sexuality is the single most powerful force in a persons life. As a consequence, this is an extremely sexually graphic movie - all of the main actors had to employ body doubles (which means porn stars) when filming the actual sex scenes.

5. In this movie, sex is described not only literally, but also in metaphors. Music, fishing, mathematics, delirium, religion, and systemic violence are some of the perspectives through which the movie looks at sex.

6. Von Trier deconstructs sex and love and shows that they are really manifestations of loneliness, emptiness, and meaninglessness. They are sometimes useful distractions, and sometimes destructive forces, in a random and coincidental world that cares nothing for us.

7. The anti-woman themes that many people see in Antichrist are explored and expanded in this film, which is a raw and anguished cry of a womans struggle with her natural power.

8. The acting in this movie is uniformly good; Shia LaBoeuf does a great job (although his accent sucks), and Uma Thurman delivers a jaw-dropping performance of an abandoned wife. But Jamie Bell almost steals the whole movie in his portrayal of a sadistic man offering his services to discerning women.

9. This movie is a long, angry look at the hypocrisies and social inheritances in modern life. I would hesitate to recommend this movie (or the other two films in the trilogy, for that matter) to anyone who has never experienced Lars von Trier before. But for those that are ready for this scorching, sexual, existential howl, its a fascinating conclusion to a remarkable trilogy.",1402704000,240,2600,4.917808219178082
6247463,5,B00I2UULIG,"This is another great movie by lars the ars.  He manages to put an environment which catches you and puts you inside the scene.  Lars is the king of making a movie an artful creation.  Now most people would think of this movie as being very vulgar or extremely erotic although it is, it will strike you from the first few moments with its beautiful scene which will simply draw you into the movie.  There would almost be no way out of it.  It's not a perfect movie.  But its very good meaning, you will not forget where you are and feel the movie inside you but you will have good time and forget lets say 50% of what happening around you and 50% not bored.",1402531200,8,657,4.174603174603175
6247464,5,B00I2UULIG,"With all the hype built up around its release, one's first thought would be that ""Nymphomaniac"" is just glorified porn. Actually, it is far from being even pornographic. Split into 2 parts (Volume I-117 mins, and Volume II-124 mins), and divided into 8 chapters, the film follows Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg), a woman in her fifties, a self-diagnosed sex maniac, spinning a tale about her sex life from childhood through to her middle-age. Unfolding a series of flash-backs, Volume I recounts Joe's vigorous childhood and youthful erotic experiences, while Volume II contemplates her desires against the overpowering pressures and constraints of adulthood. Taking in the whole of the singular human experience, including the body and the mind, sex and love, and all the connections between them, in the end the story comes full circle, almost as if it were a thought-provoking psychological insight into a world of sexuality, loneliness, and love.

Director Lars Von Trier, as the passionate, creative film-maker that he is, once again overflows his self righteous, controversial views into his work, not worrying about how outrageous these may be. Being mostly narrative and drama, the movie contains about 20 minutes of sexual material throughout the entire 4 hours, featuring some explicit adult scenes. Some may find these depictions erotic, but this material is relatively restrained, and so is unlikely to offend anyone, especially those familiar with the director's work. Obviously not an easy film to watch, but a very interesting one which requires close attention and an open mind. Complex, dark, raw, repellent, stimulating, lyrical, shocking, intelligent, often hilarious, occasionally exhausting, ""Nymphomaniac"" is simply not the pornographic epic that the press have been claiming to be. Rich in content, depth and imagery, it is a movie for adults, but not in the sense mostly associated with this term. XXX, indeed: X-uberant, X-hilarating, X-istential.

6247484,1,B00I2UULIG,"The exact same movie could have been made without including the porn....and it would have been just as bad.

The truly entertaining part is reading the reviews of wanna be critics who have posted here their idiotic admiration of this film for showing the hypocrisy, truth, etc., of porn, or porn in hollywood, or porn censures, etc.

Well, I happen to know a lot about porn.
 I used to manage an adult film store.

Porn has one purpose: to enhance a sexual experience through visual and/or auditory stimulation.
That's it, nothing more.

It cannot be used to show a deeper meaning, to uncover a hidden truth, or point a finger at the hypocrisy of authorities or institutions.

It's not needed in this film. And yet, there it is.

So either watch the porn and enjoy it (or be sickened by it) , or fast forward through it.

At least be honest about it.",1491091200,,850,4.509803921568627
6247485,5,B00I2UULIG,"I have been subject to long periods of hypersexuality, first diagnosed in my 28th year (but not the reason that I visited a psychiatrist) and now the feelings are short-lived and rare events. I am certain that age is a major factor. I don't suffer from ED, just seven decades.

Those feelings, those strange and wonderful feelings, no longer grip my every hour and only come around during the darker months of winter and last only 3 to 4 days. I can control my baser drives. I was always able to control, e.g., any kind of dangerous situations. A difference in the hypersexuality that many experience whilst in manic moods.

So. I had not seen this movie, had not heard of this film, until my psychiatrist mentioned it to me and told me that I might gain some insight into my condition by watching the film. Both volumes were available via Amazon's streaming video service (not the case today - volume II is no longer available) so I rented volume I and watched it.

I have issues with the nymph and satyr words - I am not a mythical beast, I am a man - and I did not handle the beginning of the film well; the blood, you see. But I began again and, feeling some empathy with the young Joe, I completed watching the film. Not knowing when volume II might be available, I ordered the Blu-Ray director's cut.

Making myself stay away from phrases such as ""it may be my illness speaking, but..."" I will only say that by the end of the film I had just started recognizing Joes hypersexuality. Except for the blood  and the face of the beaten Joe - I found so many things delightful: the sound of rain and of trees, the musical notes and mathematical diagram for parallel parking, all these things that enhanced the tale, that instructed the viewer (you must admit the sectioned nautilus shell was gigglingly audacious!). I could have listened to the rain dripping on the metal garbage bins for at least one hour.

The only bit of the film that I felt contrived was the train scene  who was the Joe traveling on the train? The Joe with but one bad experience of intercourse? Or a more experienced Joe? Maybe I missed something - that's possible.

Hypersexuality is not simple to explain; having a body that feels tight, gripped in a vice, finding release only in the bodies of others or being filled with the body of others but always, always, your own orgasm tantamount. Masturbation? Masturbation is just killing time, flipping through a gossip magazine, a hunting magazine, while waiting your turn to see a doctor. You need the other or others. You need them. You need. Need. That is where you feel fulfillment for an hour until the need to fill or be filled comes around again. The people that believe that the hypersexual male is fortunate are as bad as those who view the hypersexual female as a slut.

One thing that I thought a little out of kilter is that Joe reaches the age of 15 without having, apparently, any kind of same-sex experience. She says that she 'found' her special place (the word that Joe uses is prohibited here) at the age of two? By three I had discovered the pleasure of rubbing my ditty and by five had discovered that it was even more pleasurable to have my ditty rubbed by other boys. I have never met a hypersexual man or woman who was not bisexual. Even those in opposite-sex (heterosexual) relationships and those in same-sex (homosexual/lesbian) relationships will have sex with any sex.

We are poor long-term partners. Oh, but we love to be loved by those who feel that they can change us! A challenge as to how soon we can break your heart! One week, at the longest. It isn't that we're callous - we feel love just a sure as anyone and I know a handful of those like me who have flourished in relationships; but their partners have, at some point, given up something to make the relationship function. Something. Something.

I fear that volume II may stray into stereotypical waters. This is not an addiction and current thinking is that there may just be different norms for different people. To the thrice-a-week couple, having eight partners a day might sound extreme. To the eight-partners-per-day man or woman the thrice-weekly couple sounds grossly insufficient. Those that believe in the sex-addiction nonsense will generally point to the desire for escalation of experiences as an addiction: marijuana to heroin, etc. But that's not how it goes, exactly. And the shame, the need to be beaten because one cannot sufficiently beat oneself? Garbage. There are different words to use for those who feel a need to be punished  I am so afraid thats what I will see in volume II. A stereotype.

Joe, figuratively found on the streets, bleeding? Joe, seeing herself as evil and as responsible for the (suggested) bloody beating? Hypersexual Joe could just as easily have been the pummelor as the pummeled. In a Dom/Sub world, we can function as either  its laughable to see us as always ashamedly submissive. Its hysterical to see us as always ashamed.

Volume I is an entertaining film with so many delightful tidbits that you just can't help but love everything on screen. But this first volume has only briefly touched upon hypersexual behavior as a time-management problem which iss  sssiiss

The most disturbing part of this film is the wife and children scene - nothing having to do with 'nymphomania.' Uma Thurman's scream shocked me. It is shocking. It is unexpected. It is rage from a woman who asked, nervously and in a quivering voice, if her boys might see the whoring bed.

I don't know if the 'director's cut' will be satisfying or if I should have purchased volumes I & 2 separately. I can return the first within 30 and ask for an exchange if needed.

Final thought: a lovely and thoughtful and cute and kind beginning to a longer film. Delightful and worth each of the 9 stars in my rating. I am apprehensive about what's to come - and just as curious about Jerme as any first-time viewer would be. Is Joe lying? It seems so. If she will lie about Jerme then what other lies might she be telling, or yet to tell?",1488844800,,6064,4.598148148148148

6247495,3,B00I2UULIG,"This is a perplexing film.  It's hysterical (sometimes unintentionally), occasionally thought provoking, extremely pretentious (often laughably so), disturbing, harrowing, and occasionally touching.  The sex scenes are often laughable and not very erotic.  The scene where Charlotte has a menage with 2 Africans is hysterical (I think that scene is supposed to be funny, not sure though).  The film takes itself way too seriously.  Nothing in the film is really as deep as it seem to think it is.

If you don't take the film as seriously as it takes itself, it's relatively watchable for roughly 4 hours (this is a review of the 5 1/2 hour director's cut), but it becomes very boring in the last hour.  Von Trier could have cut the final hour of the film (when Charlotte goes into ""debt collecting""), and it would have been fine.  And as some have noted, the ending STINKS.

SPOILER....

It's not that the ending is a bummer and depressing.  It's just stupid and doesn't make any sense.  Not to mention Lars totally choreographs it by cutting back to a door that Stellan Skarsgard just walked out.  He cuts back to it twice, basically lecturing the audience ""something nasty is going to happen"".  Well, something stupid happened instead.

Perhaps the short version is better.  I don't know.

Nymphomaniac has its moments, but it's not a great movie by any means.  I like most of Von Trier's work (I think the film before this, Melancholia, is one of his best movies), but this one is way too long and is very self important.

And a side note.  Lars's favorite director is Andrei Tarkovsky.  There are tributes/homages to him in this picture (and in other Von Trier movies).  Lars uses a beautiful Bach piece in Nymphomaniac called ""I Call on You, Lord Jesus Christ"" that Tarkovsky used in his magnificent 1972 film Solaris.  When I heard that music in this film, I was filled with peace and happiness.  But that was because the music reminded me of Solaris.  Lars's use of the music doesn't work at all in this film.  It just recalls a much better and more spiritual movie.  Lars doesn't have the profundity of Tarkovsky, and I suspect he never will.  He's too cynical and smug for his own good at times.

This film doesn't make me want to write off Lars, but it's close.",1474156800,2,2271,4.692893401015229
6247496,5,B00I2UULIG,Another Von Trier masterpiece.,1471737600,,30,6.75
6247497,4,B00I2UULIG,"I  found this way better than expected. Basically it is a thinking man's (and woman's) porn - in other words a movie with sex where sex isn't the important part. An existential study of human intimacy (not a normal or healthy intimacy, but intimacy none the less) that is remarkable in being sensitive to both the spiritual and carnal aspects of human interest. Strange and intense, but I know of no other film quite like it. The sex is often graphic and real (and rarely pleasurable looking), the spiritual and emotional aspects are equally so. I thought the main heroine (if you can call her that) Charlotte Gainsbourg was well cast (visually reminds me of Patti Smith), as was Stellan Skarsgard, who brings a stoic intellectual Nordic Lutheran aesthetic to the part. Perhaps my favorite scene though was Uma Thurman's role as an over the top distraught abandoned housewife. And the cameo appearance of William Defoe was also interesting, lending the whole thing an air of serious cinematic drama.

Overall the story is slow (it is after all five and a half hours!), but it kept my interest and created a steadily building sense of foreboding and dread. I wished it would end, or be edited to quicken this inevitable progression, but instead it let the plot develop in its own way, showing us all the details. In this way it seemed pretty real. Not easy to watch, and often strange, but real and intense. And in that way full of human pathos, but also with an underlying sense of humor - or I should say tragic-comedy.

Obviously this kind of movie, this exploration of humanity's dark side, isn't for everyone. And in the end I wouldn't call it a satisfying movie or view of humanity, but it is poignant.

Besides the excellent acting, the writing was often very good, and the cinematography occasionally sublime; difficult but worth exploring.",1471046400,2,1847,4.780564263322884

6247510,5,B00I2UULIG,"Lars von Trier writing and directing a movie titled Nymphomaniac?!  This I gotta see!  And I did.  And it was fantastic!!

Told from the perspective of the titular character, Joe, to a rather reclusive and intellectual older man, Seligman, Nymphomaniac is essentially an in-depth character study of a personality tilted more than a bit off-kilter.  From her girlhood to the present day, Joe tells tale after tale of her insatiable sexual appetite, the destruction that has followed in its path, and her apparent lack of remorse over the rather massive human toll.

Throughout, Seligman analyzes Joes stories through his knowledge of classical studies, taking an almost distant stance towards the consequences of what he is hearing.

The acting is absolutely superb.  The drama tight and suspenseful.  Nymphomaniac takes us into worlds that almost all of us dream about, but most do not experience.  It is a wonderful work of art.  And there is a lot of really hot sex.

The ending is controversial.  My take?  Joe treated Seligman with the same disregard as she treated everyone else in her life.  Yes, he was in the wrong.  But her response was worse.",1457308800,,1152,4.952879581151833

6247517,5,B00I2UULIG,"""Nymphomaniac""(2014) is directed by Lars Von Trier (Melancholia). This two part film (148 +178 min) is about a woman's sexual journey from early in life to her mid years as she learns to cope with her sexual desires, and her subsequent depression that results from her guilt about what she is. This is a deeply engrossing film that takes its time to develop its themes fully. The film is narrated by the Charlotte Gainsbourg who recounts her life story to a man (Stellan Skarsgard) who had found her beaten on the street late at night after taking her home with him. The movie is built up on many levels as they two discuss everything from social morals, to religion, to fly fishing, and Hitler, to fibonacci numbers and the golden section. It's a long film but I found it more captivating than most films which are only 90 minutes long.

The acting is superb. The cinematography excellent. I can even say the direction is top notch.

It's just an excruciatingly long & uninteresting story. The sort of people who find this movie worthwhile are ones I do not want in my life since they're likely to be the same sort of spiritual vampires as the thoroughly unlikeable protagonist of this story. Even fast forwarding thru the bulk of this 2-dvd mess I can complain that it's a couple hours of my life I won't get back.

Unless you're so giddy with joi de vivre and happiness that you're about to explode & need something thoroughly depressing to bring you down to a suicidal level, please don't watch this terrible excrescence of a film.

And btw, for those with a merely prurient interest in seeing this film, the sex isn't any good in any of it either. Poor girl could have saved herself a lot of grief if she'd just invested $50 in a quality vibrator.",1436313600,7,939,4.544378698224852

6247568,5,B00I2UULIG,"Love it or hate it Lars Von Trier's epic masterworks on sexuality will illicit a reaction. Von Trier is quite adept at garnishing reactions from his art and I sense that he doesn't mind either way if this reaction is love or hate, just as long as there is a reaction. That being said this movie is not for the faint of heart, although the title itself implies what it documents without reservation thus the more prudish among us have been warned and if not, if sensitive eyes still look upon the explicit chronicles of a nymphomaniac, then impunity will not be given and complaints of its salaciousness from such peoples shall be null and void. Nymphomaniac is not an exploitation film. The sexual acts portrayed are filmed with clinical objectivity rather than utilizing the sensuality of eroticization. Nymphomaniac approaches its coital interplay with an anatomical eye that is often more jarring than stimulating. Von Trier uses pornographic actors as body doubles and editing technology to create a vivid reality to the sex, keeping it clear of becoming pornography but certainly remaining unabashedly authentic. I can imagine the intent display of sex as an animalistic bodily function is too remove the viewers own sexuality providing more insight into the ideas Trier introduces through the story of Charlotte Gainsbourg's character Joe. It also strips sex of any romanticized inclinations, dissecting it sternly without prejudice. The Nymphomaniac in question here, Joe, is found at the beginning of the film by Seligman played by Stellan Skarsgard in an alley beaten and abandoned. He rescues her to his apartment where he lives alone and over the course of the night she episodically relates her sordid past shown in a series flashbacks to specific periods of her life extending all the way back to her childhood. Each chapter is connected to some piece of knowledge Seligman brings up in his analytic response to the events of Joe's sexual addiction that has ultimately lead her to their meeting in the ally. Von Trier really gets to speak through these moments between Joe and Seligman and he fearlessly delivers some thought provoking exchanges and ideas that resonate far after the film is over. This is where Nymphomaniac really shines, in these enlightening pockets that encompass anything and everything along the way so that the film becomes bigger than just sexual identity. It isn't to say Von Trier is using the film to convince the audience to see things a certain way but, rather, exploring some heavy themes from an intellectually gifted perspective rich in historical, philosophical and scientific comprehension. Nymphomaniac is the third film in Von Trier's aptly titled ""Depression"" Trilogy preceded by Antichrist and Meloncholia and in my opinion his best, or should I say my favorite. Always daring, bold and creative Von Trier brings all of his talents and wisdom to Nymphomaniac, a dangerous film in its obstinate determination to challenge its audience with expansive ideas that extend forth from the films core like a tree or some living thing. An absolute Triumph of cinema that I would recommend only to souls with an understanding of Lar Von Trier's pervious films or fans of ""dangerous cinema"". This would not be the movie I would recommend to someone who has never seen his films before.",1430611200,9,3326,5.060109289617486

6247577,5,B00I2UULIG,"The four hours in which the reels of Nymphomaniac I and II spin out Lars Von Trier's take on sexual appetites are a study in realism with just a touch of hypocrisy thrown in--which, in at least one way of viewing it, only adds to the realism.  The tale involves three main characters played by four actors:  eponymous Joe played by Charlotte Gainsbourg as an adult and by Stacy Martin as a juvenile, her lover/husband/tormentor played by Shia LeBoeuf, and the older bachelor Seligman who takes in a beaten Joe, nurses her and both listens to and comments on her story, played by Stellan Skarsgard.  The supporting cast includes recognizable stars doing cameos here and there: Uma Thurman, Connie Nielsen, Christian Slater, Willem Dafoe, Jamie Bell and others.  And there is a cadre of unnamed porn stars who do all the 'wet works'.  And it is of course this latter group which brings the charge of hypocrisy to the fore, though exactly where that charge should be laid is open to debate.  In one of the special features Stacy Martin reveals her discomfort with all the rampant sex being performed by the porn actors on the set and her difficulties of performing her role (staying in character) with all the care that must be taken to match her movements with those of the porn stars.  One is reminded of the tongue in cheek scene from Brian De Palma's Body Double in which Dennis Franz directs his male lead (Craig
Wasson) through the intricacies of clutching the right breast of the blonde in the shower just before she is replaced by her body double for the really sexy parts of the scene.  Martin's comments about how she felt when a fake vagina was being glued on over her own, compared with Skarsgard's comments in the same feature about how silly it is for people to by shy about 'body parts' really focus one's thoughts on this issue.  The question becomes, if this movie or pair of movies if you like, is designed as a challenge to those blue noses who wield the censor's brush why was it necessary to fake most of the skin and all of the sex?

That issue aside Von Trier presents a great deal of poignant and thought-provoking moments in this piece, some of it 'in your face' and others parts more subtly offered.  Uma Thurman's character, for example, whose husband has just announced he is leaving her and their three young boys for his lover politely asks the young Joe for permission to show the boys ""the whoring bed"".  In another scene Skarsgard expresses disbelief that the elder Joe gave the confessed pedophile a blow job to ease the physical pain of his erection and Joe points out the man never acted on his impulses, then states that '95% of pedophiles never do anything about their urges so why should they have to suffer for the 5% who do?'  Not so obvious are the scenes in which Joe's parents (Christian Slater and Connie Nielsen) are featured.  Could it be the cold, interfering bitch of a mother and/or the warm, tender and encouraging father paired to lead Joe into this hunger?  Or is it just coincidence?  Von Trier doesn't spell it out here as he did elsewhere and even when he does spell it out there's a great deal of ambiguity around it.  Joe's little speech to her sexual therapy group could be called a statement, I suppose, or it could also be read as a self-defense mechanism.  And maybe the utterly unexpected and shocking end to the film could be called a statement. Of course this is all guesswork because Von Trier does not appear in any of the features, even the one labeled ""The Director"", which is, in itself, a statement of sorts, isn't it?  And I need here to insert one final comment.  I discussed my review with a friend who had also seen the movie and his remarks reminded me that not everyone is as 'worldly wise' as myself (at least in this respect) and that for them this movie can be viewed as a kind of voyeuristic look at a world they might not have believed actually existed.  Of course given no one but porn stars were willing to 'show the skin', engage in the sexual acts presented, perhaps that world doesn't exist outside of the porn movie industry.  Certainly gives one plenty of fodder for discussion and in that regard I have to admit it is well worth the candle.  I won't say it's 'better' or 'worse' than The Sessions or Better Than Chocolate, or Naked Fear or Dangerous Beauty...it just belongs on the same shelf.",1428019200,8,4380,4.551592356687898

In one scene, she leaves her husband's bed to beat her privates with a wet dish towel in the kitchen, then she finally finds satisfaction by grinding against props while being brutally whipped in an S&M session. Of course, that eventually loses its thrill and the character is off searching again. This movie comes off to me as a work on pure addiction, because the character is so relentlessly chasing her next 'fix', and there's no satisfactory answer given as to why (no usual backstory of abuse, etc.) The only thing I didn't like was it hard to believe the character could be so stubborn- watching her life and body deteriorate without seeming to have a moment of reflection. The director obviously made this choice so that we as an audience can fill in our own answers to these open-ended questions regarding her behavior, which may give the movie more personal meaning in the end, as long as the watcher can accept this is not a formulaic, Hollywood movie. I thought Shia LaBoef's performance was off- he played the character as tired, where I think he would have done better to act more desperate.",1424822400,2,1173,4.671497584541063

6247597,3,B00I2UULIG,"[This review refers to the theatrical two-volume version of Lars von Triers Nymphomaniac, not the directors cut.]

DVD jacket of Nymphomaniac looks interesting, telling precisely what the film is all about: sex, but not as something romanticized but matter-of-fact.

Yes, there is plenty of nudity here, (not that all these players disrobe here, though), but the titular Nymphomaniac refers to a self-proclaimed nymphomaniac named Joe played by Charlotte Gainsbourg. Joe recounts her sexually adventurous life story to a hermit-like bachelor Seligman (Stellan Skarsgrd). Divided by chapters, the film, some may think, is like reading a 19th century novel with so many digressions by the bookish Seligman.

There are some comical moments, for example, parody of Balthus, but the film is mainly about sex, or sexuality, as seen and interpreted by Lars von Trier, director whose previous works include Antichrist and Melancholia. Nymphomaniac attempts to provoke and disturb the viewers.

Sadly, despite the filmmakers obvious intention to shock (or amuse) us, Nymphomaniac loses its steam in the second half (and what is the point of the Antichrist reference?). The films idea of sex or sexuality is only occasionally provocative or insightful, and mostly simplistic. In short, he overreaches himself, trying to cover too much.

As to what happens at the very end of the film, I wasn't surprised at all (and you wouldnt neither), with von Trier being cynical as he was before.",1424304000,5,1474,5.336206896551724

6247619,5,B00I2UULIG,"A word of warning first: Yes this film does go deep into porn territory. It appears to have various scenes where actual sex is involved. Erections, penetrations, oral sex, etc are all there and the film in no way shy's away from any of it. Even the cut versions couldn't possibly get away with a strong R rating. This is adult material here, which means porn is involved. Do not watch this film in either version if this kind of thing upsets you. Now that we have that out of the way....

Trier makes movies with careful craft, like a painter uses sheer imagination, true loving skill with each brush stroke upon the canvas before him to render his ultimate masterwork, Trier does so with often beautiful and delicate style, adding in at times sumptuous and beautiful sequences such as the openings of Melancholy and Antichrist, two sequences that are simply breathtaking and beautiful. His work is exquisite and often heavenly in their beauty where scenes like these are involved, And though there are moments like this in Nymphomaniac, it is less important as a statement or window dressing here. The beauty and the joyous pleasure of the film is rendered in so many different ways. Some times in the saddest and darkest places Often the script is deep and meaningful, the cinematography goes from dark and foreboding to downright operatic. The acting relationship between Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stellan Skarsgard is simply wonderful. Their work together is absolutely brilliant.

Gainsbourg is truly an impressive woman. She is visually a stunning woman. Laying somewhere between the oddest of beauties and some mix between Patti Smith and Margaret Hamilton, She has a face that is so endearing that I fall in love with her every time I'm engaged in a character she plays. The camera is both kind and cruel to her, and she is darkly beautiful wearing it. There is a raw realism about her that wants to be shown, stripping her bare of the need for the usual Hollywood makeup cliche's. She seems fine with the slightest of touches. The more brute and masculine she appears, the more moving she is to watch.

Such is the case here where she appears through much of Vol. I and II, bruised and battered, and she looks stunning in such a atonement anyway. Gainsbourg has been acting in movies since she was barely a teenager. One of the earliest with her father, Serge Gainsbourg, a French singer and songwriter who shared the screen with her in 1986 in 'Charlotte For Ever'. The film did make a stir in some circles when material came to the forefront revolving around it that suggested the possibility if an incestuous relationship between the two of them. No one really knows. Gainsbourg is a fearless actress. She is willing to go all the way, placing her self in the most difficult roles no matter what is called for. And I admire her deeply for that. She is so fearless, bold, brave and willing to go to what ever limits are required. Not an easy thing to do, even if you have been raised in France all your life and are accustomed to the French way of viewing sex much differently.

There are scenes in the full length directors cut as well as the strongly edited version of Nymphomaniac involving Gainsbourg where you realize she may have likely engaged her self in the role to perhaps what some might deem as an unacceptable standard. One scene in the unedited version between her Character, Joe and two black men where she examines their erections (as does the audience), then engages in anal and vaginal sex with the two men, appears to have been real rather than staged. I'm sure there will be some argument revolving around this, but even those who have seen a lot of porn would be hard pressed to disagree. There simply appears to be no camera trickery to this scene I can detect, and Gainsbourgs' face is visible during the penetrations, which the camera does not shy away from. This scene of penetration is edited out of the shorter version, but the erections are still intact.

Furthermore in the latter part of the film, Joe seeks the help of a professional Sadist who she pays to tie her up and beat her. Days later after this scene was shot Gainsborg was photographed nude sunbathing on a French beach with what appeared to be severe red bruising of her buttocks. Her character, Joe, at this point called 'Fido' had endured a serious beating at the hands of the her Sadist upon her buttocks. A scene which looks incredibly authentic. If there is any truth to any of this, that Gainsbourg may have actually endured all of this in reality- would not be something to frown upon. Quite the opposite. It would be a testament to an actress willing to submerge her self so deeply into a role that she perhaps becomes that character she plays in the process. If there is some truth to any of this, all I can say is ""Eat your hearts out Christian Bale and Mathew Mcconaughey!""

No doubt about it. I love Gainsbourg. Her acting in Nymphomaniac is truly mesmerizing and beautiful. She strips her soul bare to play this character and you feel it all the way through. Though she has been around for quite a long time, she is gaining quite a lot of attention lately. She has made not only a very strong impression as an actress, but also as a model and a singer/musician. She has several solo music CD's in circulation, a very strong following of her music, and tours with her band once in awhile for live performances. Rumor has it she is even being considered for the honor of appearing on the cover of Time magazine as it's person of the year. Or was it People? I can't quite remember. If I could go on forever about Gainsbourg I would have no problem doing that. I simply adore this woman. She is amazing. The film is worth seeing for her work alone.

Other notable mentions are appearances by Christian Slater, who plays Joe's father, who is totally out of his element here, and one might wonder what on earth he's doing playing a role like this. Somehow you really grow to adore this character he plays even though his acting seems not really on the mark as it feels as if he's miscast for the part. It's a strong effort for sure. And even more so- Uma Thurman's cameo is anything but out of it's element and she steals the scene for as long as she is in it. Stacy Martin who plays Joe as a young girl is every bit an eye opener as Gainsbourg is. This girl, though I know little about her, carries this film on the merits of her own strong and fearless performance. This girl is forced to do a lot of very spicy stuff in this role, and no doubt she will be remembered fondly for it. And Skarsgard? All I can say is ""WOW!"" What an actor! The guy is just mesmerizing in this movie.

If you see this movie then I recommend seeing the full directors cuts. I've seen both the cut versions and the unedited, and the near 6 hour running time of uncut parts I & II are just the ticket. But again if right out porn and sadomasochism upsets you then avoid at all costs. I loved this film. It's just well done, a truly beautiful film in every way. Bold, shocking, wonderfully shot directed and acted piece of art house cinema that is destined to be remembered as a cult classic in my opinion.",1420329600,5,7192,4.522674865488086

6247624,1,B00I2UULIG,"You will, I sincerely hope, not be offended if I were to speculate that you were enticed -- *seduced,* as it were -- into inquiring into this movie and, for that matter, even reading this very review, because of the movie's title, yes? And the title obviously reflects on the movie's content which is focused on the reproductive arts. And, with your permission, I shall further speculate that were the movie instead titled, say, ""The Existential Dilemma"" or such, and the story concerned, ohhhhh . . . a group of nuns who begin to question their faith, you wouldn't be reading this at all, would you?  Of course you know that Lars von Trier is a celebrated director, but you didn't quite get around to seeing his cinematic accomplishment&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dogville/dp/B00107FV4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dogville</a>, did you?

In fact, the only reason you are even remotely interested in ""Nymphomaniac"" is that it depicts venery (and related impure acts) in an explicit manner. Confess! It's all true, isn't it?

Wait! Wait! Keep reading! Don't go away! It's OK!  I know you're not like that, because you have standards. You would never watch or read porno. Of course you wouldn't. That's so . . . so . . . so >degrading< and low-class. But since you're a mature adult, very open minded and not bound by the strictures of organized religion, you have no objection to serious cinema with erotic content, do you? I mean, as long as it's tastefully done?

I'm here to assure you that ""Nymphomaniac"" is >not< pornographic in nature. After all, none of the actresses (or actors, mustn't be sexist here) have had any breast augmentation, nor do they wear cosmetics in the manner of slatternly women. For that matter, rest secure in the knowledge that absolutely nothing arousing occurs during any of the movie. No titillation! No pleasure whatsoever, so it's safe. Your dog could watch it and not begin to look at you funny.

That's why Lars von Trier is, without question, an absolute genius. Sex, at least for those of you not suffering from one of the more common forms of sexual dysfunction, is one of the few natural pleasures we enjoy here in this vale of tears, and just as the finest minds of industry have ruined the joys of victualry and turned the simple act of eating into a problem, the brilliance of of Lars von Trier is that he has ruined sex. ""Joe,"" the protagonist of the movie, has sex frequently, but she doesn't enjoy it at all, and Lars von Trier does his best to make certain that you don't either.

If you think about it, that's not such an easy feat. Suppose that you were given a camera, a crew and a group of attractive actors who don't mind nudity and simulating sex acts and were told to make a movie depicting venery, it would be difficult for you to make something completely unpleasant to watch. But Lars von Trier has accomplished something you could never do: in this movie, no one has any pleasure. Sex is presented as something perverse and unpleasant, an illness. ""Joe"" only engages in it because she's emotionally disturbed, or because her domineering girlfriend made her do it, or because of some Freudian mumbo-jumbo, and she obviously dislikes each experience, starting with the first brief penetration that hurts her.

[SPOILER ALERT!] Don't fall for the brief scenes near the end, of her actually enjoying her three lovers. Those are fantasies she tells in response to having Bach played for her. The music of J. S. Bach is the sublime representation of empyreal purity, and Bach fathered twenty children, so it's good, clean, church-sanctioned, procreative sex, not the naughty fun kind. (Ooo, look!  He's bathing her!  How lovely! How clean! How innocuous! What movie is this?)  But as soon as the music stops, she announces, while in union, ""I feel nothing."" (I'll leave you to speculate what would've been shown had the nice old man hit the Play button and instead, the opening theme -- *Fhre Mich* by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rammstein/dp/B002MYYON6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rammstein</a>&nbsp;-- began playing again.)

The hypothetical sex movie you would write and direct would be unlikely to have acting that is as bland, tedious and affectless as the acting in ""Nymphomaniac,"" but that's the way Lars von Trier wants it, because viewing good acting would be a pleasure to watch, and he wants to drain anything enjoyable out. I can easily imagine him shouting direction, ""No! No! Make it even more lifeless! More monotonous!""

An obvious exception to this is the salient performance by Uma Thurman as Mrs. H., but in that scene, the fine actress is introduced for the sole purpose of making a deliberately unpleasant situation even more disturbing and depressing. It goes on for an excruciatingly long time, because Lars von Trier wants to rub your nose in the message: sex ruins lives and makes people miserable. The scene is comedic, but only in the way slapstick is. (And don't get me started about the comic-book-Freudian bathos with Christain Slater in the hospital. The shot of his butt equals my opinion of the whole movie, except that diarrhea typically passes much quicker.)

Your hypothetical sex movie would also have better camera work than ""Nymphomaniac,"" because Lars von Trier has elected to punish you with eye strain due to the modern fad of a hand-held camera delivering an unsteady picture. (Mack Sennett had better camera work.)

Lars von Trier is not the first director to make a movie depicting sex as repulsive. The late Ken Russell also wrote and directed movies with that effect. Like this movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Russell-s-movies/dp/B004Z5BYGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Russell's movies</a>&nbsp;were also promoted by ads and posters featuring an enticing shot of a woman in ecstasy, but that was just to lure you in. The movie itself taught you a lesson of rue. It is, after all, the glorious puritanical heritage of those of us of Northern European descent. Those people down there in the tropical climes? Look at `em! Gratification and pleasure? Goin' at it like they was rabbits? No wonder God punishes them!

All the enthusiastic reviews here are written under the pretense that there is some profound message embedded in this movie (especially the bedpan scene). The profound message is that sex must be presented strictly in terms of social isolation and as a manifestation of emotional disturbance. If sex were depicted in a uniformly joyous light, the movie would not be sold at this site. Instead, you'd have to go to some sleazy site where they'd rip-off your credit card information and notify your insurance company that you are an irresponsible, high-risk person.

Another movie in which a young woman comes to an unfortunate end due to unseemly behavior is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kelly/dp/B00DSIYH8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kelly</a>, but that's a fun movie and far more realistic and meaningful. Despite that it was shot entirely on an iPhone, the picture is still steadier than it is here. I highly recommend it over this dismal blague.",1419811200,3,7478,5.296202531645569

I'm sorry ... I expected more from Lars von Trier.  But this film -- both Parts I and II -- are total trash.

Because I had to borrow the films from the Brooklyn Public Library, I took as take may -- and got Part II first.  I didn't quite get the point of Part II, but thought I might be missing something.

When I finally got my hands on Part I, I watched it.

Both parts -- at least as far as I'M concerned -- are a series of non sequiturs.

6247631,5,B00I2UULIG,"There isn't much that offends me, except for the way our country has abandoned the promises of our Constitution. I'm a product of the 60's cultural revolution, and there isn't a lot I haven't seen nor read. The arts are to be respected for the intentions of the artist, subjective for sure.

Lars von Trier has presented some brilliant work, most brilliant must be ""Breaking the Waves"", introducing the world to the brilliant Emily Watson. He did ""Dancer in the Dark"", featuring an impeccable performance from first-timer Bjork. He did ""Dogville"", featuring the magnificent Nicole Kidman, reminding us why she's an A-List actress. Then he did his ""Depression"" trilogy (where Kirsten Dunst won Best Actress at Cannes for ""Melancholia""). The trilogy featured Charlotte Gainsbourg in all three, the others being ""Antichrist"" and ""Nymphomaniac"".

Lars von Trier LOVES actresses, and never fails to bring out their best.

""Nymphomaniac"" is a character study, not unlike a discussion between best friends, with flashbacks. Charlotte Gainsbourg, as Joe, goes through a complete history of who she is and how she got there. It is, literally, a complete performance, wrought with passion, sincerity and unabashed honesty (which may be why awards committees have ignored the film). Stellan Skarsgaard is the older guy who hears her story, with compassion and genuine concern, a scholar with issues of his own.

The version I watched has Part I at 2 hours and Part II at 2 hours, 4 minutes. I understand a longer version is coming available, but, in my experience, there is not a wasted moment. It's riveting at all times. It's episodic, and each episode makes its mark with profundity and plot, edited in a way that kept things flowing quickly. I wasn't bored for a minute, unlike the previous two films, though Gainsbourg shines in all three.

Von Trier has a definite feel for the subject matter, sympathetic without sugar-coating the more ""honest"" flow of events. There are courageous performances from all, eschewing any preconceived personae: Shia LeBoeuf, Christian Slater, Uma Thurman and Jamie Bell, as well as powerful appearances from Willem Dafoe and Udo Kier.  Much admiration for Stacy Martin as Joe's younger self, setting the scene for a scenario that will blow you away. I have no end of admiration for Von Trier's film. He's not a happy man, but, instead of being depressed all the time, he's put his life on film, often in ways that baffle and confuse and create fear, but it's who he is.

Other directors do this in an artsy-fartsy way that challenges the viewer to guess what's going on. Von Trier's done that a few times. But ""Nymphomaniac"" is a straight-forward narrative that had me intrigued at every moment.

The sex scenes were performed mostly by porn actors, and in the long run, it's not so much about the sex act as it is about how it's overcome our attitude toward love, trust and understanding.

Despite all the bad press, etc., there are a few others who saw the film in a positive light. Von Trier finished his trilogy and shoved it in your face. I wish him well.",1418688000,4,3087,4.898467432950191

Whatever the addiction, it is bound to hurt the addict themselves and those close to them. With that said, the wild sexual exploits are seen more as a spiraling addict out of control than anything erotic.
Vol. 2 certainly brings that point home when darker and more depraved acts take place as Joe finds difficulty in achieving the same ""high"" she was once had.
The film is both brilliant and disappointing at the same time. Brilliant in that through her story being told to Seligman it allows for a non-judgmental look at her life, whether bad or really bad, it is what it is, the actions of an addict.
Disappointing in how the movie ended. Some viewers may find the ending fantastic because it certainly is not predictable and a change in moral compass. I personally was disappointed because I felt like any redeeming qualities were lost.

6247669,1,B00I2UULIG,"Pretentious much??  The dialogue between Joe and the woman sounds written.  A fatal flaw.  Another fatal flaw is the gratuitous nature of the film's nudity and its sex scenes.  Mind, I am not shocked by these scenes.  I do not quail at nudity or sex.  Yet I do have a problem when the graphic nature of the scenes is unnecessary, aimed only at prurient interests.  The scenes of intercourse and fellatio might better have been left to the imagination - if our culture still valued the imagination, if certain audiences did not feel cheated if sex was alluded to rather than seen and not only seen but zoomed into with impossible to ignore close ups.  I read a novel by Henry Miller or Philip Roth or John Updike in which characters engage in sometimes ""perverse"" sex acts and can readily imagine the scenes without needing to see swinging genitals before me.  The mind's eye can work wonders if given half the chance.  Indeed, I had the feeling that Von Trier included the ""nasty bits"" to cater to a certain audience.
  Be mindful that the women on display here are rather boyish.  Heaven forbid the women here should have some meat on their bones - they seem to be suffering more from malnutrition or anorexia than anything else.  Reducing women to the status of adolescent boys makes them less dangerous, less powerful.  At least that is my interpretation of what Trier is hinting at.
  It's not enough to see a woman bent over a couch while a man readies a whip.  It is not enough to hear the crack of the whip and imagine the pain inflicted and the soreness and welts on the posterior, no, we have to see the welts, the blood.  Because if we don't we'll feel cheated.  ""Let's watch an actor bleed"".  But one is not acting as though she is in pain if she IS actually in pain.  It defeats the very purpose of acting.  You know - to pretend.  How long will it be until audiences require that actors in an action film are actually beaten to a pulp?  Because, hey, anything less is art and art is artifice and artifice is fake.  This movie is an example of anti-art.  It is didacticism at its crudest, its most vulgar.
  There is a telling scene in which a man gives away that he has pedophiliac tendencies.  Judging by the women the director chooses to enact what can only be described as his own fetishistic fantasies, this could amount to a grim self-disclosure.  Yes and how interesting it is that this would-be child molester gets sexually excited not by anything he sees, but by hearing a woman relate the scene through language. What a concept.  Too, Joe himself does not see the degradations she is reduced to - he has to imagine them.  They are converted to him through language - not an assortment of videos she carries along with her.  So the very structure of the narrative belies the need for the graphic scenes of meaningless, joyless sex.
  Which brings me to the next point.  Why in so many of the spate of movies that come closest to pornography, is sex seen as drab, empty, mechanical?  This is true of ""Nine Songs""  ""Happiness,""and others of that ilk.  Can't sex be seen as life affirming, as a source of intimacy, a source of happiness?  At least occasionally?
  Fortunately I did not have to sit through the entire two films nor did I pay for the dubious privilege of watching it.  That's why I love Netflix streaming.",1409097600,12,3338,4.500834724540901

6247674,4,B00I2UULIG,"To me, Lars Von Trier has been a filmmaker that I have had a love/hate affair with. I loved BREAKING THE WAVES and DANCER IN THE DARK, regardless of how overwhelmingly depressing they were. I hated ANTICHRIST and MELANCHOLIA because they were either too offensively aggressive (ANTICHRIST) or too boring (MELANCHOLIA). But with his mission statement behind NYMPH()MANIAC, it sounded like he was abandoning, at least for the time being, some of the nihilism of his previous films and embracing some more humorous and playful tones. Now, bearing in mind that what I've seen is a still incomplete film (the film he shot is supposedly some 5 and a half hours), NYMPH()MANIAC is something of a challenge to get through, but a somewhat rewarding one.

Essentially, this is the story of Joe (Von Trier regular Charlotte Gainsbourg) and Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard), who, after he finds her beaten and unconscious and takes her back to his apartment, she recounts the sexual experiences thoughout her life, and how her sexuality has defined and dominated every aspect of her life. She initially starts these tales to prove that she is not a good person; somethine that Seligman refuses to believe. We first encounter Joe at a very young age with her parents; the loving father (Christian Slater) and distant, cold mother (Connie Nielsen) when she discovers her blossoming womanhood. As she grows into a beautiful young woman in her teen years (portrayed by radiant newcomer Stacy Martin), she loses her virginity to J (Shia Laboeuf), who she later becomes almost obsessed with, despite her many lovers. As her stories increase in intensity, Seligman, a true bookworm, sees relativity in many of her tales to mathematics, religious and mythological symbols, literary references, and even unusual musical styles. Seligman is not excited sexually by her tales, but rather excited intellectually, which is bothersome to Joe at points. She continues her story which also shows her eventually marrying J but this creates a different problem for her to overcome, leading her to interracial threesomes, severe masochism with K (Jamie Bell), enrolling in a sex addiction group, and lesbian encounters with a young protege. All of this storytelling leads to a strangely inevitable conclusion which is both disturbing and troublesome.

To be certain, there is a LOT of sexual activity here, but very little of it hardcore (in which either prosthetics or digital doubles are employed), which might disappoint a few potential viewers looking for ""porn"". A similar debate was stirred up recently in regards to the argument of Art Versus Pornography with Abdellatif Kechiche's brilliant BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR, which features prosthetic simulation of sex that some would still consider hardcore. But the strictest definition of Pornography is unsimulated sex designed to tittilate or sexually excite the viewer. That doesn't really happen in either of these films, but NYMPH()MANIAC is really an unapologetic combination of both Art and Pornography.

The standout performance here is the young Martin, but most of the cast here does very good work. Gainsbourg and Skarsgard are a very compelling duo with strong chemistry. As far as supporting work, the best to be seen here is Uma Thurman, who is featured in the most absurd and uncomfortably hilarious/shockingly moving scene of the film in which she brings her young children to Joe's home after her husband has left her, seemingly at Joe's behest. The scene brings a squirming discomfort, an anarchic hilarity and a poignant portrait of human devastation. Slater is fine, but a tad problematic as the English-accented father. Laboeuf is more tolerable here than in most of his other films, because most of his annoying tics are absent. Bell is always a capable performer and even gives his emotional vacancy a palatable urgency. Von Trier covers a great deal of philospohical and existential ground through the conversation between Joe and Seligman which makes for an alternately fascinating but occasionally pretentious viewing experience. However, it can't be debated that Von Trier knows how to shoot a film and make it look really good.

There is a pretty severe drop in the film's energy from Part I to Part II, though, which is probably my biggest problem with the experience. Gainsbourg, while compelling, just seems almost exhausted having to carry the remainder of her arc once Stacy Martin departs. This attitude is fine while she's resting after her attack, but even with her story becoming more dour, she just feels... off.

All in all, NYMPH()MANIAC is a film that delivers an unusual experience all around that falters somewhat in its second act, but comes together for a powerful climax.

6247691,3,B00I2UULIG,"VOLUME I:

OK, here I am setting myself up for another mind-altering trip with Lars von Trier. I've seen most of his previous films and usually come away scratching my head or pissed off. And then, I keep thinking about the movie for days. This film is no different. Charlotte Gainsbourg, a frequent von Trier contributor, plays Joe. She's found in an alley, unconscious and beaten up, by Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard) who lives in the area. Joe refuses a trip to the hospital or police involvement. Seligman invites her back to his book-laden apartment. After she's cleaned up and provided some tea, she begins to tell her story. That of a self-proclaimed nymphomaniac.

At first Seligman suggest otherwise and in an unusual bit of analogy compares her youthful sexual exuberance with fly fishing. When it started making sense, I knew I was in trouble. The teenage Joe (Stacy Martin) is shown in flashback and is the preeminent character in this volume. Her virginity is offered up when she is 14 and roughly acted upon by a mechanic played by Shia LaBeouf. He will show up later in her life via several flashbacks scenes.

By the time Joe is 16, she and her best friend, 'B' (Sophie Kennedy Clark), are having contests as to who can have sex with the most men/boys. Eventually 'B' finds love, a dirty word in Joe's mind. As a young adult she acquires many notches to her bedpost, eventually averaging 10 different men a day. And as near as I could determine, she was never paid for any of these trysts. She just likes sex and can't get enough.

As he frequently has been won't to do, von Trier doesn't pull any pubic punches showing a full range of sexual organs and sex acts involving all the orifices. In fact one scene shows about a dozen penises of all shapes and sizes in full close up. Yeah, I could have done without that thank you. This film is an obvious set up for volume II which will likely spend more time with the adult Joe in action.

As far as Volume I, I'm almost ashamed to say, I actually laughed a few times. It does have a sense of humor. But I also thought the scenes with Uma Thurman as a jilted wife were a bit over the top. This movie will have a small targeted audiences so be warned. The sex isn't particularly sexy and certainly not romantic. It finds a small niche between the soft core shenanigans of `Skinamax' TV and true hard core film. Somewhat less explicit but with a real story. As for Volume II, well I just can't...uh...wait?

The Blu ray transfer is very good. Using a 1080p video resolution the film has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The film itself isn't one to create eye-popping video. But the colors appear accurate if drab. I didn't notice any image artifacts. Audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. This is a talky and the dialog is clear and easily understood. There is no real musical score but plenty of added music, mostly classical (Seligman is a lover of Bach) and some contemporary rock to balance things out. It all sound very good. Subtitles are in Spanish and English SDH. Extras include a short piece called ""The Characters,"" an AXS TV promo, a trailer for this film and a handful of others from Magnolia Home Entertainment.

VOLUME II:

Volume II picks up right after Volume I ends. In reality this is one long voyeuristic drama cut into two pieces, in this case discs. The older Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is more involved in the flashbacks of her story as being told to Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard), the older man who rescued her from a beating. Joe is no longer the young sexually aggressive teen she was earlier as played by Stacy Martin.

Shia LaBeouf remains a central character as Jerome, who was given Joe's virginity early in Vol. I. In fact they end up together and through a birth control error, are given a son. Jerome's job requires him to travel extensively so Joe is often left with the child or in the hands of a caregiver. As her relationship with Jerome progresses, Joe finds that her sexual desires have waned and looks for new ways to get them back.

On one occasion she summonses a pair of African migrs, brothers, neither of whom speaks English. The pair get into an argument over who will penetrate Joe in which...uh, orifice. This actually is quite comical as the two men argue while director Lars von Lier focuses on their fully erect members waiving in the breeze like a pair of sword fighters.

The film gets darker as Joe decides that she will visit a sex specialist (Jamie Bell) who doesn't teach psychotherapy of any kind but provides sexual beatings which actually get Joe back on the pleasure-seeking bandwagon. So much so that when her babysitter doesn't show up, she leaves her sleeping son (about 18 mos. old at this point) alone while she heads off for her appointment of machoism. As the son awakens and slowly climbs out of his crib as the snow begins to fall, I was reminded of a similar scene in von Trier's ""Antichrist."" Alas, Jerome returns from his trip to find his son out on the balcony. This leads to his banishment of Joe from ever seeing Jerome or their son again after she refuses to promise to change her extracurricular escapades.

Instead, Joe becomes a collection enforcer for one of the city's load sharks she calls `L' (Willem Dafoe, who starred with Gainsbourg in the aforementioned ""Antichrist""). Yeah, that surprised me too. But hey, it's von Trier. Evidently, Joe's ability to read men will come in handy in collecting debt, rather than having his goons beat them. Personally I think it was just von Trier messing with us again. There's an extended scene where Joe and her two goons go to a rich man's house to collect a debt but he's not forthcoming. So she pulls his pants down and begins to taunt him verbally. Unable to get a `rise' out of him she begins to tell a tale of a young boy. That seems to work. The man becomes aroused and agrees to pay. Joe, having surmised that the man has a sexual perversion for children, but has never acted upon it, decides he should be orally satisfied. Now, I'm not quite sure how they pull this off in the making of this film, but it sure looks real.

This film like the earlier Volume I is far from a masterpiece or even a good movie. It is filled with sex, but little is erotic, certainly not romantic and leaves the viewer a bit unclean. At the same time von Trier does introduce some interesting subject matter. Everyone knows what a nymphomaniac is, a woman with an addictive need for sex. Has anyone ever heard of a satyromaniac, the word for a man with the same condition? Me neither. Both words are taken from Greek mythology. The final scenes in the movie are equally disturbing as Joe has a chance encounter with Jerome (this time played by Michael Pas). Her final scenes with Seligman are just ridiculous.

The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p video resolution and has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, the same as volume I. I did notice one nature scene that was shadowboxed, that is had black borders surrounding the picture. I don't know what that was about. Still using digital cameras, Volume II seems a bit darker and the picture a bit grainier as opposed to Volume I. Like the first film there are no artifacts that I could see. It looks very good. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is solid if unspectacular. But this is a film with a lot of talking and not much action, beyond the sex. Music is all from individual classical and rock pieces. Dialog is clear and properly focused. Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH. Extras include a 9 minute segment where some of the actors talk about working with von Trier. What could have been an interesting piece deals with the actors talking about how body and sex doubles were used during the filming. But it doesn't reveal how the effects and editing were carried out. I'd really like to see that. There's also a trailer.",1406937600,12,7839,4.550354609929078

6247696,5,B00I2UULIG,"In the actor commentaries included with the DVDs, Shia Labeouf describes how I feel about Von Trier as a director: a bad Von Trier movie, with its flaws, is still better than most other directors' *best* movies.  I like the fact that his films are provocative, take chances, and often reward me by way of astounding insights into human nature.

Okay,yes, these two volumes *do* have their explicit moments.  But after the first or second viewing, you'll probably find yourself paying more attention to the non-sexual scenes (that, or you'll begin to recognize crucial, non-sexual motives in what to most people would seem like titillating or erotic images).  When ""K"" gives Joe the Christmas gift, it was (to me) the saddest moment in the film, as Joe has just given up time with her family in order to feed her compulsion (and yet, Joe's speech about Jerome---that he too was unfit for parenthood---implies that family life is a lie, and that people grow quickly and painfully bored with the illusion).

Von Trier takes the stance that Joe is not strictly a sex addict, as she actually enjoys the sex ""as"" sex, and not as a substitute for other things (loneliness or validation).  Yet, her experiences do mimic those of a lot of addicts---sexual or otherwise (we do see her use sex as a distraction in times of stress, etc).  And ultimately, like an addict, the physical interactions keep increasing in intensity as the supposed payoff becomes harder and harder to get.

(edited) I will admit to having a preference for part II, so I only recently re-watched important segments in part I which explain what Jerome is basically about: he's kind of the typical middle class guy who lucks his way into an office job at ""Dad's"" (in this case ""Uncle's"") company.  He's lazy, arrogant, and not too bright (the kind of guy who calls in to make comments on AM radio sports shows).  He tries to use his (temporary) position in the company to get Joe into bed, and she resists as a means of taunting him.  They finally hook up later on, and make what are (probably pitiful) attempts at a normal family life.  And then he learns the truth: marrying a nymphomaniac is no prize.  (I've never met the husband of an actual sex addict, but I've met MANY men whose wives are absolutely addicted to the *Flirting* aspect of it; for some men, it's a turn on to have a wife who turns men on, but for others, it becomes a very bad thing).

It was no surprise to me that Jerome eventually hooks up with ""P"" in the end.  ""P"" needs control, and picks Jerome because his tastes are simple and base.  Jerome will take orders, whereas Joe will not.

I thought ""Melancholia"" was the best of the trilogy (Melancholia, AntiChrist, and Nymphomaniac), but I enjoyed all three films, and am glad Von Trier made and directed them.",1406678400,10,2797,4.640973630831643
6247697,1,B00I2UULIG,"Charlotte Gainsbourg, a talented actress, does have some balls.  She did this movie when she was 42 yrs old -- just had a baby -- and in Vol. 2 has many nude scenes.  Obviously, she looks facially and body-wise nothing like 23 yr old Stacy Martin who plays her character as a teenager.  The movie (Vol. 1 & 2) gets One Star for Charlotte's willingness to do whatever the director tells her to do -- which is very graphic, and not flattering.

Other than that, the movie storyline is terrible.  Putting several nude bodies in a film does not make for an interesting plot or a ""cutting edge"" film..  As noted in other reviews, this movie is not artsy-fartsy, it is simply dull.

PLOT SPOILER

In an interview for the release of the film, Gainsbourg claimed that she did none of the graphic sex scenes.  She said that it was in her contract that the director would use body doubles, and that there would be no attempt to intimidate her into doing those scenes.  Well, there is a scene where she puts a man's penis into her mouth.  Yes, it could be a fake penis, but it certainly looks like the real thing.  You be the judge -- if you must watch this movie.

6247703,2,B00I2UULIG,"There are a handful of directors who have created such buzz surrounding their distinct voices that there is talk about them, their films and their methods with every film, before, after and even long after hes moved on to something else.  Lars von Trier is probably the king of this.  Since his start in the early 90s, von Trier has graced audiences (small audiences, but audiences) with his perverse and often shocking depictions of sexuality, sexism and masochism.  Sometimes, he finds ways to shade his own ideas, philosophies, theories and musings with enough style and depth to make them feel warranted, making the shock of it all carry the weight it needs to sit on our palate.

And then other times he just shows us a lot of pictures of genitals and expects us to feel something other than repulsion.

Now, Ive been a longstanding champion of von Trier and his vision.  While others have tossed many disparaging remarks his way and have taken arms against some of his more recent films, Ive stood my ground and played devils advocate in his favor.  Antichrist was a pretty disturbing film, but when all was said and done there was an underlying purpose to von Triers madness, and while it didn't all translate how he would have liked (or at least how the audience would have liked) there is no denying that von Trier had a pretty bold narrative and some pretty confident points to entertain, and the core performance from Charlotte Gainsbourg was astonishingly grounded in the context of the film (such a fearless performance, through and through).

I cant defend this.

Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1 & 2 is basically a four hour film that recounts a young womans many, many, many sexual trysts.  Pretending to exploit (here we go again with exploitation in film) the double standard that abounds within the treatment of men and women, especially in a sexual context, Nymphomaniac confuses all of its own ideals in a strange hodgepodge of chapters that drone on and on and ultimately take us nowhere.  Opening with a beaten young woman named Joe being helped off the street by the neighborhood psychiatrist, Seligman, and then delving into the depths of carnal lusting and abuse, Nymphomaniac is probably one of the most self-absorbed and self-indulgent films Ive ever had the displeasure of seeing.

I think that Lars von Trier has a deep-seated interest in uncovering the depths of a womans psyche.  I don't think that he is a misogynist at all.  In fact, I tend to side with Uma Thurman on this subject:

Hes a very provocative filmmaker, but he writes women with more depth and respect and complexity than most writers.  The idea that people debate whether hes a misogynist?  People should debate whether people who don't even write women are misogynist.  The fact is, hes dedicated a large portion of his artistic life to the exploration of the female psychegood and bad, light and dark, shadows, textures.  The fact that hes dedicated a huge part of his talents to that, to me, defies the concept that he doesnt have respect, interest, and genuine compassion in women.  People should question writers that don't even give a d*** about a female character.  They are the misogynists.

Sadly, this respect and intrigue isn't seen very well here at all.  Instead, Nymphomaniac feels about as misogynist as they come, and at the end of the day its even worse than that; the film feels just plain trashy.  Lars von Trier has built a career out of shock value, but his shocking contributions to film have always felt grounded in a linier plot or at least in an idea that has sprouted into madness, but a clear idea at the core.  Most of Nymphomaniac feels nonsensical and devoid of rational narrative, and while he tries to find some footing in the films final throws, he never establishes anything concrete within Joes story to hook us to her, to latch onto us and so it all winds up feeling rather misguided.

There is a point here, but von Trier doesnt know what it is.

Instead, von Trier treats us to a young girls dissention into depravity.  She prostitutes herself for sexual pleasure at a very young age, playing games with her best friend and even forming a club thats primary focus was to rack up sexual partners, never forming a lasting relationship with anyone (no one lay to be repeated), and Joe recounts her story with absolutely no emotion, as if none of it matters (because it doesnt) and Seligman tries to liken her whorish behavior to numbers and fish while she relates it all to her dying father and an ash tree; and while Joe is pretending shes falling in love with Shia LaBeouf (because that could never happen for real), volume 1 ends and volume 2 begins and this is where things get dicey.  Sexual pleasure is lost, which leads to Joe finding her own personal Fight Club and hiring translators to hook her up with Africans and before we know it, Joe has become a Soprano and is grooming a freaky eared nymph to take her place, and her man.

And then Seligman takes off his pants.

There is so much going on here and yet none of it ever feels necessary.  It is all just there to make your eyes hurt (they will hurt) and the films primary point seems to center on how Joes disturbing actions are all validated because men are disgusting pigs and she is living in the repressed guilt of her of desires, but its not that simple and yet von Trier never steps back from his own visual shockfest long enough to try and actually develop these themes.  Instead hed rather show us a bunch of genitalia and sexual acts and then force feed us a finale that feels appropriate ONLY because the film pretty much sets us up for a cop-out ending.

There is such a thing as being bold and fearless, and Nymphomaniac is both of those things, but it is also soulless and hollow, and when you are both of THOSE things, bold and fearless will only harm you.",1404777600,21,5856,4.631528046421663

8638392,3,B00I2UULIG,"Antichrist was a masterpiece and perhaps the best movie I've ever seen, and Trier's position in that film was easy to identify; he clearly came down on Gainsbourg's side. In Melancholia, Trier backed away from civilization issues, not entirely but with a reduced focus, and instead fixated on depression itself and allowing the mood itself within his setting to subtly suggest civilization critique. With this film it seems he is conflating the two styles. Thus we get a study of clinical depression standing in as nymphomania, and that cover is part of the larger ""civilization"" issues in the form of the perfectly captured and thus moronic bourgeoisie chattering and moralizing and ironically moralistic anti-moralizing about sex.

If Trier's intention was the same as in Melancholia, to again expose the fecklessness of modern liberal society, then I would say this film is too good; I couldn't help but hate watching it because the idiotic bourgeoisie hand-wringing and perversions the bourgeoisie must inevitably commit to satisfy its self are so perfectly depicted. Skarsgard's character, unlike Daefoe's, is presented in a neutral manner, as if Trier wanted actual dialogue to happen between Skarsgard and Gainsbourg's characters, with Trier I think still siding with Gainsbourg. Who knows why, maybe he got bored, but in general this film feels far more accessible than his previous two, almost like a dumbed-down Trier film. In Nymphomaniac Trier spells out the film's substance. It may be that this was ploy by Trier to further emphasize the absurdity and foolishness of bourgeois liberalism, to also present its self-serious dilettantism.

All three of the depression films have women as the depressives. That is not an accident, and is part of the larger civilization issues Trier is discussing. I think Trier ""sides"" with these women, not because he empathizes with them as women, but because he's siding with the collapse of liberalism they represent, as in he considers this collapse a good thing (as do I, which is why I admire Trier). Taking Modern Woman as the nexus of liberalism's contradictions is something of an old continental hat, D.H. Lawrence for example, but it is a refreshing erudition in a society that grows ever more wretchedly moronic. Trier takes this old hat and uses the old forms very well, this is certainly a well made film. Again, the author, probably for reasons against his will, and because of the particular subject matter of this film, must strictly employ the language of liberalism and modern society to unpack the subject of sex as such and depression as such, which turns out to be the bourgeosie's projection of sex onto depression
(and onto everything) because it doesn't know how to explain sex. Sex is a boil on the ass of the bourgeoisie.

Skarsgard is the modern man, nothing is a secret to him, he knows everything that's ever happened, everything can be explained, every problem solved, everyone can be saved, and he is a 60 year old virgin, utterly impotent and unmanly by virtually every historical standard, which for centuries was only one standard. That one standard, the real men, arrive and depart in seconds throughout the film, like nightmarish flashes of nature from the bowls of liberalism's ideological dungeon. However, now that I'm fleshing out my feelings on the film, I really do think that this seeming ""dialogue"" is itself just another criticism of bourgeois liberalism, which is to say liberalism simply as the liberal emotional creed of ""the many against the few"" is the bourgeois religious impulse. In that respect, this film would actually be his most inaccessible, as this European style of anti-liberalism not only goes back many years, but also goes back to political projects that would scare people, of course because we now live in a world of total embourgeoisiement.",1530316800,,3853,5.093354430379747

He may live in a rundown place, but he has a tremendous background and insight, and in Vol 1, she relates her tale, and the role of herself is played by a younger version of herself.  I feel two of the stronger tales relate to how Mrs. H handles her husbands infidelity, and her reaction to her father dying in the hospital.  Vol 2 really hits the gut wrenching notes. In this portion, she plays most of the flashback roles, relating to more recent events. There is some real humor, such as with the spoons, and how she cheated with the sadist at Christmas time.  But there are some discussions of real substance.  Yes, there is plenty of sex in the flashbacks, and some quite graphic.
