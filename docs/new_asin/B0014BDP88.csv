3127967,4,B0014BDP88,"Considering the negative response this film has generated, I went into the movie theater not expecting much.  The premise of the movie sounded interesting so I figured--why not give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  I actually liked it.  To tell you the truth, I liked it a lot more than 2046.  I will admit Norah Jones was not very good.  I liked the cinematography and score.  I thought David Strathairn and Natalie Portman were exceptionally good.  The story reminded me of something Wim Wenders would've written: you never know what you have until you lose it.  Very existentialist.  Go see WINGS OF DESIRE to know what I'm talking about.",1211414400,6,636,4.648648648648648
3127968,5,B0014BDP88,"This movie offers you a lot more than your ordinary love story. It gives you an insight into what makes us essentially human. The actors and actresses did a good job portraying their flawed and fragile characters, making you laugh,cry and smile with them. Norah Jones is great as an actress - her character is the most complex of all, yet the most human. You could feel what her character goes through, what she's thinking and feeling. Not bad at all for a first timer. Definitely a movie that I'd watch again and again.

Hope this helps.",1209772800,5,538,4.546391752577319
3127969,4,B0014BDP88,"This movie has a great cast. David Strathairn is superb as the Memphis cop with the runaway wife, and Rachel Weisz is also fantastic. Actually, I think Norah Jones is really good, in a piece of inspired casting and a natural performance. Her character is the touchstone of the movie. The part of the movie from her arrival in Memphis, the bar with Strathairn and Weisz and other characters...really riveting.

The rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to that part, though. Jude Law is pretty good, kind of playing himself, but those scenes are a little too cute. Natalie Portman shows her increasing versatility as an actress and there are some very warm and compelling scenes during that part, but it didn't quite come together.

The whole movie has an improvisational feel to it that is alternately very exciting and unpredictable, and then kind of missing and a little dumb. However, good cinematography and acting more or less carry it through. I'm a fan of Norah Jones' music but didn't expect her to be that great in this movie. I was surprised that she was actually pretty good. I think she should do another movie at some point, maybe with this director - not just any director. Music is good, too, particularly the Cassandra Wilson Harvest Moon performance.

All in all, worth seeing, in a sort of experimental way. Kind of reminded me at times of Paris, Texas.",1209513600,3,1373,4.7125
3127970,3,B0014BDP88,"A beautifully shot movie that lacks substance and even summarizes itself in a Norah Jones song at the end - ""The Story."" The story has indeed been told before, but never with some much vivid color and magnificent scenery. Natalie Portman looks spectacular and David Strathairn delivers a great performance. Norah Jones sounds incredible on the soundtrack and acts quite respectably, particularly in the company of her famous cast. Still, the movie's zooming in and out technique and the constant shifting of focus is more distracting than helpful. Elizabeth (Norah Jones) might be going on a self-reinvention tour through United States, but the movie stands still without proving much of anything.",1207872000,,697,5.288288288288288

3127986,3,B0014BDP88,"""My Blueberry Nights"" is a maddening exercise.  There is so much to recommend but ultimately the film is not a success.  The supporting cast (Jude Law, David Strathairn, Rachel Weisz, and Natalie Portman) are all terrific.  Director Wong Kar Wai has some interesting flourishes notably the look of the film which glows in neon incandescence.  Ultimately though director Wai is done in by his screenwriter-himself.  If you examine the story close enough it doesn't hold water.  What further impedes the film is the casting of a neophyte actress, singer Norah Jones, in the lead role.  With her olive complexion and wide open orbs Jones certainly has the look of a movie star but like beauty itself her screen presence is only skin deep.  They try to fashion the script around her thespian deficiencies but Jones has the lead role and she is left to fend for herself like a deer caught in the headlights.  It's obvious that Wai was trying something ambitious but the pieces of this enterprise don't add up to a satisfying whole.",1402617600,,1026,4.817142857142857

My Blueberry Nights is upbeat, harmonic, soulful, and has a strong sense of rhythm with improvised camera work (which can be a bit grating at times). The story is very basic, a girl deals with her heartbreak by visiting a pie shop and soon runs away from a potential romance by traveling across America where she meets offbeat characters while sending postcards to her potential love interest.

The Film 4/5

The first thing to mention is that My Blueberry Nights is not yet available on Blu-ray in North America. This review refers to the Region B UK disc.

In the opening scene, we are introduced to Jeremy (Law), who runs a diner in New York. He's originally from Manchester, England, but seems at home in his surroundings. He knows people by what they eat. Elizabeth (Jones) is a customer who is asking whether her boyfriend has been in the diner. Jeremy confirms that he was there and had dinner with another woman.

The two begin to talk on a regular basis. Elizabeth leaves her keys at the diner so that Jeremy can give them to her boyfriend. He listens to everything she says and is part friend, part psychiatrist and part restaurant owner. The two share a bond of sorts and he also reveals details of his own previous relationships. He keeps her keys in a jar with countless others and Elizabeth learns that he knows the story behind each set.

Jeremy also talks to her about food, explaining what sells well and what doesn't. He offers her blueberry pie and ice cream and mentions that the blueberry pie is often untouched at the end of the day. There's nothing wrong with it, but people just make other choices. I think Wong Kar-Wai is comparing people to food with that observation. There's nothing wrong with Elizabeth or Jeremy, but both are alone.

The camera on the diner wall serves as Jeremy's diary. He likes to watch the recordings at the end of the day to see what he's missed. Wong Kar-Wai's camera doesn't miss anything. When Jeremy and Elizabeth are talking, we see them from afar. There's often a counter or something in the way of the camera so that we feel like voyeurs, spying on an intimate conversation. Other notable techniques include the use of vivid colors and the blurring of motion, as well as slow motion and images which are sped up. Wong Kar-Wai uses the same techniques in other films such as Chungking Express and Fallen Angels.

Without declaring anything, it becomes obvious that Jeremy and Elizabeth care about each other. But Elizabeth seems wary of relationships after her recent experiences and decides to take some time to think about what she really wants. She works in various bars and diners and eventually winds up in Memphis. It's there that she meets Arnie (Strathairn), who drinks in her bar. She listens to Arnie, talks about her dreams and gives him advice. I like Strathairn's performance and consider him one of the most interesting characters in the film. Is it a coincidence that Elizabeth becomes someone who will listen to people's problems, just as Jeremy did with her?

Elizabeth writes to Jeremy regularly, but never reveals her address or phone number. He misses her and tries randomly calling bars and diners to find her. Later, he decides to send postcards, and ends up sending hundreds.

Elizabeth rarely stays in one place for long and has a series of adventures. The most prominent one happens when she encounters Leslie (Portman), who plays poker for high stakes. Elizabeth learns more about herself as the film progresses, especially from Leslie.

Will Elizabeth and Jeremy ever meet again? I won't reveal that here.

Norah Jones did a great job on her acting debut. The story is stylish, intimate and a little unconventional. If you like other Wong Kar-Wai films, you'll almost certainly like this. Ry Cooder's score is incredible and perfectly matches the mood. There are some other well-placed songs, especially the two haunting numbers from Cat Power. If you're a fan of Cat Power, look out for a cameo appearance by Chan Marshall.

Video Quality 4.5/5
Optimum's Blu-ray presentation looks great. The stylized color scheme is striking and the detail strong. There are no obvious problems such as dirt or print damage. The film looks clean and almost perfect. Any blurring is purely intentional and a regular occurrence in Wong Kar-Wai's films.

Audio Quality 4.5/5
The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track delivered everything I hoped for. Although the film is primarily a dialogue-heavy story, the use of music enhances the atmosphere. Cooder's guitar is wonderful and the other songs all come across well. You won't have to strain to hear any of the dialogue and I couldn't detect any faults in the mix.

Special Features 3/5

10,279 Miles Since Hong Kong: My Blueberry Nights - A good ""making of"" feature with cast and crew.

Theatrical Trailer

My Blueberry Nights will appeal to lovers of film for its interesting use of color and unusual camera angles. It's a romance of a sort, but less conventional than most. Some of the discussions will stay with you if you're the sort of person who analyzes what you have just seen. Fans of Wong Kar-Wai shouldn't hesitate. If this is your first Wong Kar-Wai film and you liked it, Chungking Express is well worth checking out. I consider it his masterpiece.

3128006,5,B0014BDP88,"I don't know who reviewed this film before me, but they're all wet. Maybe I differ because I've never seen a movie by this director, so I looked at this one with a fresh, unbiased perspective. I thought BLUEBERRY was great and so did my wife who watched it with me on cable. I love quirky, character-driven pictures, and this one fits the genre. To my mind it's a pic about life, love, loss, and redemption, and along the way we see some interesting characters and portrayals. I didn't find anything wrong with the performances, though I could agree that one or two [e.g. Weisz] were slightly over the top. On the whole, they were believable and engendered close attention and even sympathy. Jones and Law deserve top billing, esp. since this was Jones' first acting gig. She was perfect for the role; just great and thoroughly believable. Portman's performance was solid. I was especially taken with David Strathairn's interpretation of the drunk cop trying to retrieve the irretrievable. He first caught my attention as the wayward CIA boss trying to kill Jason Bourne. Here he was a heart tugging guy refusing to let go of his soon to be ex. Yet he's still able to treat a young newcomer on the scene with tenderness and generosity His tears and deep pain were totally believable. Bravo. This is a film that is mostly 'down', so folks looking for something uplifting and flighty need not watch. But the message[s] provoke lots of thought and even weighing of one's own experiences compared to the two lead characters. Who hasn't wanted to hit the road when adversity seemed unbearable, as Elizabeth does after betrayal? And who hasn't wanted to stay in touch with that other person you happen upon, hoping s/he remembers and cares and wanting for some reason to maintain that thread of attachment 'just in case'. Who hasn't yearned for recapturing love after one has let it walk out the door, hoping against hope. And who hasn't fallen in love with somebody who just doesn't think of you in the same way? After watching the film, I went straight to Amazon to find the DVD. Any movie buff who hasn't seen a Wong before film should watch this one with unbiased eyes, and even some who have tasted Wong's work before might consider a look-see.",1291939200,3,2243,4.695431472081219
3128007,5,B0014BDP88,"It's interesting to see what WKW does when he's got the liberty of the US's wide open spaces.  He quotes from Thelma and Louise!  Also, unlike his Hong Kong characters, the characters in this movie can connect and ostensibly become a couple. We truly enjoyed this.",1286841600,,264,4.717391304347826
3128008,4,B0014BDP88,"The main feature of this film are the characters themselves - the plot almost feels secondary. With good writing and acting, the characters are all engaging and three-dimensional, enough to make you care about them. Norah Jones - a wonderful singer - is very good in her first acting role here, portraying Elizabeth, the lead. Elizabeth discovers at a corner cafe in New York City that her boyfriend has been cheating on her. She leaves his keys there and returns several times afterward to see if he came back for them. Each time, she gets to know Jeremy (Jude Law), the cafe owner, more and more. Jeremy waxes philosophically over the many keys people have left there and the blueberry pie which is almost always left over at the end of the night.

Clearly something begins to develop between Elizabeth and Jeremy; however, she is still working on getting over her ex-boyfriend. She moves across the country to Memphis, Tennessee where she goes by Lizzy. Trying to save money for a car and unable to sleep well, she gets two jobs - working at a diner during the day and a bar at night. At the bar she meets Arnie (David Strathairn), a policeman who is an alcoholic and cannot accept that he's separated from his wife. It's easy to feel sorry for Arnie, although it's clear he is flawed. Likewise, just when you might get to dislike his wife (Rachel Weisz), you learn to empathize with her situation too.

While Jeremy tries all he can to reach Elizabeth in Memphis by mail or phone, she moves on to Nevada. Here she goes by Beth and gets a job at a small casino. She gets to know Leslie (Natalie Portman), a poker player who has lost all her money. Leslie convinces Beth to lend her all her car savings; if she wins, she'll share the winnings with Beth and if she loses, then she'll give Beth her new car. When she loses, Leslie says she can have the car but she needs a ride to Las Vegas to see her estranged father and borrow money. Along the road trip, the two get to know each other more. Again, Leslie has issues such as her inability to trust anyone, but there's still some good in her too.

I enjoyed the characters and the story very much. My one criticism of the movie is the director's use of slow-motion. I felt it was unnecessary for the most part and he used it far too often toward the beginning of the movie. Otherwise, the movie was rather enjoyable. It included some wonderful music and nice cinematography. There was some humor, but for the most part it was a drama with some elements of romance.",1282521600,,2516,4.453362255965293

The story, which is about Lizzie (Jones), who goes on an adventure after she realizes that her boyfriend is cheating on her, and realizes what she left behind is really what she truly loves. It's heart-warming, and even if it's not exactly an academy-award winner, I encourage anyone to give it a try.

Despite its status as a low-budget, independent feature, ""My Blueberry Nights"" boasts a roster of A-list players - Jude Law, David Strathairn, Rachel Weisz and Natalie Portman - that any mainstream filmmaker would consider it a privilege to work with.

In her big screen acting debut, singer Norah Jones plays Elizabeth, a beautiful young woman from New York who, after her boyfriend dumps her, decides to head out across the country to try and forget about her past and make a new life for herself.  Working as a waitress in Memphis and the Desert Southwest, Lizzie meets up with a variety of colorful characters, including Strathairn as an alcoholic cop, Weisz as the wife who`s been cheating on him, and Portman as a compulsive gambler who lures Lizzie into one of her schemes.  In addition, Law plays a caf owner back in the city who introduces Lizzie to the delights of blueberry pie and who serves as the letter-writing confidante and emotional focal point the wayward young lady needs while she's off on her travels.

As conceived by director Wong Kar Wai and co-writer Lawrence Block, the vignettes aren't all that terribly interesting, actually, but the artful look and tone give the film a hip, sophisticated flavor.  And since Lizzie is pretty much just a passive observer of  the dramas that unfold around her, we don`t become as emotionally invested in the characters as we might had she been allowed to become a more proactive force in the narrative - though we're willing to concede that this approach might well have been necessitated by Jones` neophyte status as an actor.  Her work here isn`t bad, by any means, but then she isn't called upon to do much more than react to the people and events around her.  As a result, it's still probably way too soon to make any kind of definitive prediction regarding her future as an actress.

Still, the contemplative, lyrical mood of the film and the sometimes astute and touching observations it makes about both the good and bad aspects of relationships turn ""My Blueberry Nights"" - its episodic nature notwithstanding - into an enjoyable, if minor, triumph for Wai and his gifted cast.",1247702400,2,2155,4.831521739130435
3128013,4,B0014BDP88,"I tagged this review - Natalie Portman, because I love her work. I was hoping this film would be another of her film gems but I was frankly disappointed. This is intended as an adult film with a very ""moody"" style. Some people seem to think moody films are deep. Well, if you say so. As for Natalie's fans, whom I directed here with my tag, I can tell you that she doesn't appear until an hour into the dreary plot and plays a relatively uninteresting Vegas card-shark. Basically, this is someones attempt at making an art-film. As for me, I'll stick with Garden City.",1245542400,,568,4.419047619047619

3128015,3,B0014BDP88,"My Blueberry Nights is like a short story, but, to make a short story long, the characters come alive and the story gets longer. Indeed, it was based on an earlier short film by Chinese Director Kar Wai Wong. Maybe he should be called Kar Wai (so) Wong? It was just a short story's worth of film stretched out to 89 minutes. But actually, if you can get through it without falling asleep, it is pretty good. Kar Wai Wong likes to work without a specific script and he relies on his actors to flesh it out with improvisation.

Since singer Norah Jones is no doubt familiar with improv, he chose her as the lead actress. She doesn't seem like such a great actor, but the role didn't call for much range. She is just sad and hopeful that some guy she met will come back, but you know nothing about him, and little else is revealed about her. She goes to a caf&eacute; and leaves some keys in a jar, and tells the caf&eacute; owner, Jeremy (Jude Law) to return them if he sees him again. She returns numerous times to the caf&eacute;, hoping for word about her man, but she also returns for the blueberry pie and conversation.

=====================
Elizabeth: So what's wrong with the Blueberry Pie?
Jeremy: There's nothing wrong with the Blueberry Pie, just people make other choices. You can't blame the Blueberry Pie, it's just... no one wants it.
Elizabeth: Wait! I want a piece.
------------------------------

It seems, however, that she is not the only one with keys in the jar, as Jeremy also does. So wrapped up is she in missing her man that she scarcely notices Jeremy, even as she derives tremendous comfort from the blueberry pie and the conversation. Eating blueberry pie and crying, one night she cries herself to sleep. There is vanilla ice cream on her lips, and then later there is none. Did Jeremy kiss her while she slept?

Elizabeth takes off on a journey of self discovery that leads her West from New York, first to Memphis, where she meets a policeman (David Strathairn) also broken hearted for his young wife Sue Lynne (Rachel Weisz). Their story is a little film-within-a-film, and it's a short story that really works.

Next she heads out to Vegas, or more like a small town that has a casino or two--a small town outside of Vegas. Baker? Harumph? No, not Harumph. While working as a waitress, she meets Leslie (Natalie Portman), a gambler with daddy issues. She needs a stake to get back in the game, and offers Lizzie either her car, an expensive Jag, or a third of her winnings if she comes out ahead. It seems like Leslie did not win. Leslie says that she will give her the car, but she needs a ride first. While on the road the hospital calls and says her father wants to talk to her, that he might be dying. For some reason not fully explained, she hates her father. He is a gambler and taught her how to play cards. He used to brag to his cronies that she thought that Jack came after ten.

==========
Leslie: Sometimes your rhythm's off, you read the person right but still do the wrong thing.
Lizzie: Because you trust them?
Leslie: Because you can't even trust yourself.
------------------

Natalie does pretty well, but I've seen her do much better. Though she was having a bad hair day, there is a lot of chemistry between Lizzie and Leslie (not THAT much chemistry. Get your mind out of the gutter. Still, who came up with these names?). They just look like they are having a lot of fun together, two girls on the road.

All the while, Lizzie keeps sending postcards to Jeremy. He realizes that he misses her, maybe he loves her. The postcards never include a return address, but he calls and sends out cards to every caf&eacute; and diner in the towns her cards are sent from hoping the shotgun approach will find her.

Anyway, you get the idea. There are a lot of Norah haters out there, but she did OK. Kar Wai Wong really wanted her, and he built the movie around her. Her character wasn't a musician, and her dream, besides getting another slice of that blueberry pie, was just to buy a car. By making her character a mere waitress, they kind of left out the most interesting thing about her. I think that Norah Jones herself would make a better subject for a movie, and she could play herself. In it, a young girl sweeps The Grammies with a subtle blend of jazz and country, and backstage, for the first time, she meets her father, also a musician from India. Someone wanted to make that movie, but both father and daughter quashed it. Talk about daddy issues.

Norah wrote one song for the film, and Cat Power, also in a small part, did another. Other music was by Ry Cooder. My Blueberry Nights had very lush cinematography by Darius Khondji, with lots of night shots and neon lights. It was a subtle and nuanced film that didn't give in to cynicism. I wish I could give it more than 3 stars, but it was Norah's first film, and Kar Wai Wong's first film in English, so it was a good first try.

3128017,3,B0014BDP88,"""My Blueberry Nights"" features a sweet, delicate story perhaps overwhelmed by a too showy directorial style.  Norah Jones is very appealing, though, and supporting turns by Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Natalie Portman, and especially David Strathairn (as a troubled police officer who Norah meets on the road) lend gravity to the film.

A brief making-of/behind-the-scenes special feature is mildly interesting, but it's outdone by a half hour or so onstage interview with director Wong Kar Wai, which took place at New York's Museum of the Moving Image.  The interview is illuminating and interesting, as the director discusses the film and the differences between directing in China and the United States.

If you're expecting a lot, you'll find ""My Blueberry Nights"" a little underwhelming.  But if you're open to a simple story where emotions and feelings take precedence over innovative story points, you'll likely enjoy it well enough.",1233792000,,936,5.340136054421769

Each character seems to be mostly passed over by the world living with shallow and ultimately superfluous relationships while letting work or addiction wash life by them.

As the film progresses some of the characters are abruptly thrown into situations force in meaning to their lives and slowly, inadvertently help Elizabeth, Norah Jones' character, find meaning in her own.

The film is also very good artistically, particularly light and color of the cinematography is superb.  The performances all hold up well and I think it it may be one of both Jude Law and Natalie Portman's best.

They're not going to live happily ever after -- they're going to die of lung cancer and heart disease. Give us realistic intelligent characters who don't smoke.

Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well.  Jude Law is always interesting to watch for me.  His two Oscar nominations for ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and ""Cold Mountain"" gave much better stories and characters than does this film.  Darius Khondji, the Oscar nominee for ""Evita,"" does stunning work with the cinematography.  However, time lapse photography of ice cream melting on a blueberry pie might make me hungry, but it doesn't compensate for the lack of a story.  Law's Jeremy and Norah Jones' Elizabeth seem like they are destined to become romantically linked.  After nights in the pie shop, Jones takes off which takes her to several locations.  Rachel Weisz who won a supporting Oscar & Golden Globe for ""The Constant Gardener"" plays the sleazy wife Sue Lynne to David Strathairn's boozy policeman.  I actually liked Strathairn more in this film than in his Oscar nominated performance for ""Good Night & Good Luck""  He has such an unrequited love and such a tragic demise.  Down the road, Elizabeth runs into Natalie Portman's gambler character who seems juvenile, untrustworthy and spoiled.  However, Jones can't hold her own in frame with Portman and the film loses its path, as it seems to take a rabbit trail rather than illuminating the Elizabeth-Jeremy story.  Chan Marshall shows up as Jeremy's ex.  The big change in the movie comes as Jeremy tosses a jar of keys he'd been keeping at the diner.

3128024,2,B0014BDP88,"I really wanted to like this movie.  I remember when the buzz surrounding this movie started flooding in during the beginning of 2007 and everyone was predicting it for all kinds of awards beings that it was Kar Wai Wong's first English language film and the casting of singer songwriter Norah Jones in the lead role was particularly interesting.  I waited patiently for the buzz to turn into full-fledged madness but it seemed as if no sooner did the buzz begin then the buzz died and before I knew it the film wasn't even being released for a wide release and I had to wait until it was available on DVD before I could see it.  Regardless of the fact that it managed only one nomination (at Cannes mind you) I still really wanted to see this film, and so I did, and now that Cannes nomination baffles me, because `My Blueberry Nights' is very disappointing.

`My Blueberry Nights' gets off to a sour start.  In fact for the first twenty minutes or so absolutely nothing happens.  We see Elizabeth, a frantic stalker-type ex-girlfriend going in and out of a bakery where she continues to ask the owner Jeremy if he has seen the man she was last in there with and they eat some pie and she watches some surveillance videos and cries and she gives him her keys to give to her ex and then she picks up and leaves town.  I know that sounds like a lot, but it's not when you watch it.  It's slow moving and rather vapid.

In fact the whole movie feels rather vapid.

There are a lot of critics who talk about Kar Wai Wong's infatuation with lovesickness, but I really didn't gather that here.  I saw glimpses of it, sure, but overall the feeling I was left with was more empty than fulfilled.  Sadly this was the first Kar Wai Wong film I have seen (but I do have `In the Mood for Love' in my Netflix queue) and I am left a little confused as to why this director is so lauded.  I will allow his other films to change my mind though.

The acting is decent for the most part, excels in some areas and falls flat in others.  Norah Jones is beyond doubt a phenomenal singer and musician.  Her music touches my soul.  Her acting is uninspired and bland.  There is a part in the film when Faison's character says quite frankly to Weisz's character that he doesn't know what her ex-husband ever saw in her.  As he was speaking those words I was thinking the same thing, but about Jones's character, wondering how anyone could find her remotely interesting.  Her eyes are dead and she embodies no real emotion.  Jude Law is charming across the board; a little obnoxious in some areas but overall strong.  David Strathairn is stronger still as the alcoholic police officer Arnie.  His subtle outbursts within his own skin are far too good for the movie he inhabits.  Rachel Weisz is probably the most entertaining thing about this movie in the way that Thandie Newton is the most entertaining thing about `Crash'; a little uneven but uneven to perfection.  Natalie Portman is entertaining yet nothing impressive.  Her performance is decent, but doesn't really add anything to her character.

I also found the incessant, repetitive use of Norah Jones's music throughout the beginning portion of the film to be rather unnecessary and annoying.

By the time the film was wrapping up I was wondering what it was all about, what the whole purpose of this exercise was.  Sure, Elizabeth was supposed to find herself out on the road with all these people she doesn't understand and eventually realize that Jeremy is the one she wants to be with, but that point could have been delivered a little clearer and a little more interestingly.  I just found `My Blueberry Nights' to be a waste of talent and concept and apparently director, unless all of his films are like this and I'm just not intelligent enough to `get' them.",1218153600,20,3803,4.525622254758419

I was lured in by the cast and the art house feel.  Ten minuted into the film, however, I found myself wondering:  ""is this it???"".  I kept waiting for it to begin but it never did.  Jude Law and Natalie Portman were really the only interesting characters in the movie and their bits were so minute compared to the entirely lackluster Nora Jones that I kept wondering to myself if the rest of the cast would add this film to their shame list and forget they ever participated in this disaster.

As for the arthouse feel, think in terms of the cinemagraphic tricks used in music videos and video snapshots of subways in New York where everything seems purposely sped up and blurred for effect.  Now imagine an entire film of that.  It's exhausting.

As to be expected with such a gifted lead, though, there was some lovely music to keep me company throughout the numbing dialogue and impersonal directing.  Other than that, it's painful.",1217808000,10,1115,4.585858585858586

3128027,3,B0014BDP88,"There is much in Wong Kar-Wai's first all English production to admire, but the cast, the dialogue, and the translation of Asian aesthetics unto accent-dimmed performances is so pronounced we have no option but to enjoy the movie solely for its artistic merit while lamenting its prosaic shortcomings. The usual antics and brilliance of the director are all deployed to a whimsical effectiveness, if sometimes deliberately indulged. The usual close-ups and askance visual is present frame after frame, with opaque intrusions, slantwise peering, obstructed lavishness, and aided by the diner/pub setting the movie is infused with neon latency. In fact the plot is simple and very bleak. Action hardly ever takes place during the day, save for the occasional interlude which seems to be a way to mark as pronounced the comparative glare that the night offers. At times we have the camera slide its intensity along a bar or a table, stolidly stuck on a fork pricking through a slice of pie, or meandering about the outskirts of a bar, column after column, shadows crawling senselessly through a disorderly tension that seems innocent enough to hide behind the crevices of our visual. Overall the very Asian aesthetic quality of the camerawork tellingly foreshadows a candor that has us become voyeurs more so than spectators. In Asian culture it is best not to invade one's private space and here it is carried out to such beauty that it offers a sense of indiscreet respect.
Where the movie falters however is in its casting, of which some are excellent artists used in a middling unfortunate fashion. Jude Law and Natalie Portman are sensational actors but oddly cast in the drama. Their intensity is unique but too forceful for the narrative introspective layover. The graceful Norah Jones is very mediocre. She has promise but the flick rests too much on her inner turmoil to be successful since she cannot be the keystone of the narrative in a way to match the intensity and bravado of her colleagues. The story is very simple. Elizabeth is stuck on her boyfriend whose just broken-up with her. She will have to labor through her incredulousness and inability to let go. The diner's owner, played by Jude Law offers her a shoulder and an ear while terribly straining the poetic attitude of the atmosphere by introducing a dialogue that metaphor driven closes the doors it chances to open. In fact while observing the action from behind window panes or timidly joining the session while tip-toeing about a door left ajar we discover a tenuous delicacy of touch that is as fragile as Norah Jones' performance.
David Strathairn, cast as Arnie, the alcoholic policeman who cannot let go of his wife, strikes a rapport of morbid proportions with Lizzie. While on a lovelorn escapade to Memphis, Lizzie nurses her loss and begins to recover, but in the process as she learns to give up, somehow that same sense of absence transfers to Arnie who is separated from a wife who wants nothing to do with him. The perfection of his character study and depth only highlights the misses of the others, including Arnie's estranged wife Sue Lynne (Rachel Weisz). Arnie gives up on a night of madness and overglowing anger but determines to commit suicide. Enters Natalie Portman, a southern vixen with a penchant for gambling.
The neon-hued camerawork receives added sheen from a trip to Vegas on a brand new Jaguar, only to find out that the every win is also a loss. Ultimately that is the upshot of the narrative which is brightly demented by the braggadocio devil-may care sensibility of Leslie (Natalie Portman). The death of Leslie's father causes a reunion between Lizzie and the diner's proprietor Jeremy, who functions as the jar of sweets everyone is sure with due time Lizzie will find her way to. Time spent through glowing hues that distil an aura of hopeless references and tame performances that jarr all the more because uninspired while beset by the contrasting tenderness of the visual.
A movie worth watching, because of the addictive intensity provided by the camerawork of Darius Khondji, but the elegiac tone of a ""Chungking Express"" or ""In the Mood for Love"" is affected by the sobering vapidity of a plot that plays with the notion of loss and gain by using a maudlin dialogue and a cloyed, exhausted attempt at allegorizing by way of sappy, overburdened poetics.",1216252800,41,4373,4.918809201623816
3128028,4,B0014BDP88,"Kar Wai Wong is as much a visual artist as a film director and his fort has always been making beautiful, multileveled images on a screen that is trying to see clearly the outlines of character development.  Such is the case in his first English language film MY BLUEBERRY NIGHTS, a creation he wrote (with Lawrence Block) as well as directed.  While the 'story' boasts a cast of fine actors, the emphasis seems less on character delineation than on creating a cinematic stream of consciousness.

A New York Russian bakery/caf is operated by immigrant Jeremy (Jude Law) and into this milieu comes the newly jilted Elizabeth (Norah Jones - who also provides much of he sound track singing for the film).  She leaves her boyfriend's keys with Jeremy as a sign of resignation but continues to nightly check to see if her ex-boyfriend has shown up to claim them. This is the premise for the formation of a bond between Jeremy and Elizabeth, but without solidifying that bond, Elizabeth runs off to greener pastures.  She settles in Tennessee where she finds work as both a waitress and a bar maid and meets the down and out alcoholic policeman Arlo (David Strathairn) who pines away for his tacky, gallivanting wife Sue Lynne (Rachel Weisz).  Leaving that story piece unresolved, Elizabeth then moves to Las Vegas where she becomes friends with a young, loser gambler Leslie (Natalie Portman) who manages to waste Elizabeth's savings for a car on yet another misjudged gambling night.  Through this cavalcade of losers Elizabeth continues to write postcards to Jeremy and the ending is blatantly predictable.

There are some moments of memorable dialog: 'Sometimes, even if you have the keys those doors still can't be opened. Can they? '  'Even if the door is open, the person you're looking for may not be there'.  But for the most part this is a visual feast for those who love Kar Wai Wong's genre.  The plot is thin as is the dialogue and the actors work to make the most of the outlines of conversation that they embellish with their own spontaneous words.  If it feels improvised to the viewer then the viewer has entered the realm of Kar Wai Wong.  This is a film for art film lovers - it is very beautiful to watch!

3128029,3,B0014BDP88,"For years, Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai has resisted the lure of the United States, content to make his films in his native country (with the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Together/dp/B0002X7GZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Together</a>&nbsp;which was shot in South America) without any Hollywood movie stars. This has changed with My Blueberry Nights which Wong made in America with recognizable names like Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Natalie Portman, and in her feature film debut, singer Norah Jones. However, Wong hasn't exactly sold out - he made the film independently and it was then distributed by the Weinstein Company. Wong's film debuted at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival to a less than favourable reaction and was quietly given a limited theatrical release and is now out on DVD.

Sadly, there is no real chemistry between Norah Jones and Jude Law. It feels like Jones is just saying the lines and not living them. There is no emotional depth to her performance as she tries too hard to act and it shows. In addition, Law is simply not believable as a working class cafe owner.

Wong's weakness is his absolute need to cast beautifully looking people in his films and in this case it was the film's fatal flaw. Natalie Portman is well cast a smooth talking con artist and the only one (aside from David Strathairn) who looks comfortable in her role. With her curly, light brown hair and brash demeanor, she reminds one of Karen Mok in Wong's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fallen-Angels/dp/B0002X7GY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fallen Angels</a>.

""The Making of My Blueberry Nights"" is your standard promotional featurette. Wong says that the film is based on a short film he made years ago and when he met Norah Jones in New York City, he decided to expand it into a film. Wong talks about casting the other roles in the film and the actors speak about their characters.

""Q&A with Director Wong Kar Wai"" was recorded at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City on April 3, 2008. He talks about working with singers, his impressions of New York and how the film evolved while he was making it. Wong speaks eloquently about some of the themes of his films and his working methods in this excellent, albeit too-brief, featurette.

Also included is a theatrical trailer.

Finally, there are ""Still Galleries"" with evocative location scout snapshots and publicity photographs.",1214524800,2,2900,5.75058275058275
3362464,4,B0014BDP88,"Considering the negative response this film has generated, I went into the movie theater not expecting much.  The premise of the movie sounded interesting so I figured--why not give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  I actually liked it.  To tell you the truth, I liked it a lot more than 2046.  I will admit Norah Jones was not very good.  I liked the cinematography and score.  I thought David Strathairn and Natalie Portman were exceptionally good.  The story reminded me of something Wim Wenders would've written: you never know what you have until you lose it.  Very existentialist.

The actors and actresses did a good job portraying their flawed and fragile characters, making you laugh,cry and smile with them. Norah Jones is great as an actress - her character is the most complex of all, yet the most human. You could feel what her character goes through, what she's thinking and feeling. Not bad at all for a first timer. Definitely a movie that I'd watch again and again.

Hope this helps.",1209772800,5,538,4.546391752577319
3362466,4,B0014BDP88,"This movie has a great cast. David Strathairn is superb as the Memphis cop with the runaway wife, and Rachel Weisz is also fantastic. Actually, I think Norah Jones is really good, in a piece of inspired casting and a natural performance. Her character is the touchstone of the movie. The part of the movie from her arrival in Memphis, the bar with Strathairn and Weisz and other characters...really riveting.

The rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to that part, though. Jude Law is pretty good, kind of playing himself, but those scenes are a little too cute. Natalie Portman shows her increasing versatility as an actress and there are some very warm and compelling scenes during that part, but it didn't quite come together.

The whole movie has an improvisational feel to it that is alternately very exciting and unpredictable, and then kind of missing and a little dumb. However, good cinematography and acting more or less carry it through. I'm a fan of Norah Jones' music but didn't expect her to be that great in this movie. I was surprised that she was actually pretty good. I think she should do another movie at some point, maybe with this director - not just any director. Music is good, too, particularly the Cassandra Wilson Harvest Moon performance.

All in all, worth seeing, in a sort of experimental way. Kind of reminded me at times of Paris, Texas.",1209513600,3,1373,4.7125
3362467,3,B0014BDP88,"A beautifully shot movie that lacks substance and even summarizes itself in a Norah Jones song at the end - ""The Story."" The story has indeed been told before, but never with some much vivid color and magnificent scenery. Natalie Portman looks spectacular and David Strathairn delivers a great performance. Norah Jones sounds incredible on the soundtrack and acts quite respectably, particularly in the company of her famous cast. Still, the movie's zooming in and out technique and the constant shifting of focus is more distracting than helpful. Elizabeth (Norah Jones) might be going on a self-reinvention tour through United States, but the movie stands still without proving much of anything.",1207872000,,697,5.288288288288288

3362483,3,B0014BDP88,"""My Blueberry Nights"" is a maddening exercise.  There is so much to recommend but ultimately the film is not a success.  The supporting cast (Jude Law, David Strathairn, Rachel Weisz, and Natalie Portman) are all terrific.  Director Wong Kar Wai has some interesting flourishes notably the look of the film which glows in neon incandescence.  Ultimately though director Wai is done in by his screenwriter-himself.  If you examine the story close enough it doesn't hold water.  What further impedes the film is the casting of a neophyte actress, singer Norah Jones, in the lead role.  With her olive complexion and wide open orbs Jones certainly has the look of a movie star but like beauty itself her screen presence is only skin deep.  They try to fashion the script around her thespian deficiencies but Jones has the lead role and she is left to fend for herself like a deer caught in the headlights.

The Film 4/5

The first thing to mention is that My Blueberry Nights is not yet available on Blu-ray in North America. This review refers to the Region B UK disc.

In the opening scene, we are introduced to Jeremy (Law), who runs a diner in New York. He's originally from Manchester, England, but seems at home in his surroundings. He knows people by what they eat. Elizabeth (Jones) is a customer who is asking whether her boyfriend has been in the diner. Jeremy confirms that he was there and had dinner with another woman.

The two begin to talk on a regular basis. Elizabeth leaves her keys at the diner so that Jeremy can give them to her boyfriend. He listens to everything she says and is part friend, part psychiatrist and part restaurant owner. The two share a bond of sorts and he also reveals details of his own previous relationships. He keeps her keys in a jar with countless others and Elizabeth learns that he knows the story behind each set.

Jeremy also talks to her about food, explaining what sells well and what doesn't. He offers her blueberry pie and ice cream and mentions that the blueberry pie is often untouched at the end of the day. There's nothing wrong with it, but people just make other choices. I think Wong Kar-Wai is comparing people to food with that observation. There's nothing wrong with Elizabeth or Jeremy, but both are alone.

The camera on the diner wall serves as Jeremy's diary. He likes to watch the recordings at the end of the day to see what he's missed. Wong Kar-Wai's camera doesn't miss anything. When Jeremy and Elizabeth are talking, we see them from afar. There's often a counter or something in the way of the camera so that we feel like voyeurs, spying on an intimate conversation. Other notable techniques include the use of vivid colors and the blurring of motion, as well as slow motion and images which are sped up. Wong Kar-Wai uses the same techniques in other films such as Chungking Express and Fallen Angels.

Without declaring anything, it becomes obvious that Jeremy and Elizabeth care about each other. But Elizabeth seems wary of relationships after her recent experiences and decides to take some time to think about what she really wants. She works in various bars and diners and eventually winds up in Memphis. It's there that she meets Arnie (Strathairn), who drinks in her bar. She listens to Arnie, talks about her dreams and gives him advice. I like Strathairn's performance and consider him one of the most interesting characters in the film. Is it a coincidence that Elizabeth becomes someone who will listen to people's problems, just as Jeremy did with her?

Elizabeth writes to Jeremy regularly, but never reveals her address or phone number. He misses her and tries randomly calling bars and diners to find her. Later, he decides to send postcards, and ends up sending hundreds.

Elizabeth rarely stays in one place for long and has a series of adventures. The most prominent one happens when she encounters Leslie (Portman), who plays poker for high stakes. Elizabeth learns more about herself as the film progresses, especially from Leslie.

Will Elizabeth and Jeremy ever meet again? I won't reveal that here.

Norah Jones did a great job on her acting debut. The story is stylish, intimate and a little unconventional. If you like other Wong Kar-Wai films, you'll almost certainly like this. Ry Cooder's score is incredible and perfectly matches the mood. There are some other well-placed songs, especially the two haunting numbers from Cat Power. If you're a fan of Cat Power, look out for a cameo appearance by Chan Marshall.

Video Quality 4.5/5
Optimum's Blu-ray presentation looks great. The stylized color scheme is striking and the detail strong. There are no obvious problems such as dirt or print damage. The film looks clean and almost perfect. Any blurring is purely intentional and a regular occurrence in Wong Kar-Wai's films.

Audio Quality 4.5/5
The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track delivered everything I hoped for. Although the film is primarily a dialogue-heavy story, the use of music enhances the atmosphere. Cooder's guitar is wonderful and the other songs all come across well. You won't have to strain to hear any of the dialogue and I couldn't detect any faults in the mix.

Special Features 3/5

Theatrical Trailer

My Blueberry Nights will appeal to lovers of film for its interesting use of color and unusual camera angles. It's a romance of a sort, but less conventional than most. Some of the discussions will stay with you if you're the sort of person who analyzes what you have just seen. Fans of Wong Kar-Wai shouldn't hesitate. If this is your first Wong Kar-Wai film and you liked it, Chungking Express is well worth checking out. I consider it his masterpiece.

3362503,5,B0014BDP88,"I don't know who reviewed this film before me, but they're all wet. Maybe I differ because I've never seen a movie by this director, so I looked at this one with a fresh, unbiased perspective. I thought BLUEBERRY was great and so did my wife who watched it with me on cable. I love quirky, character-driven pictures, and this one fits the genre. To my mind it's a pic about life, love, loss, and redemption, and along the way we see some interesting characters and portrayals. I didn't find anything wrong with the performances, though I could agree that one or two [e.g. Weisz] were slightly over the top. On the whole, they were believable and engendered close attention and even sympathy. Jones and Law deserve top billing, esp. since this was Jones' first acting gig. She was perfect for the role; just great and thoroughly believable. Portman's performance was solid. I was especially taken with David Strathairn's interpretation of the drunk cop trying to retrieve the irretrievable. He first caught my attention as the wayward CIA boss trying to kill Jason Bourne. Here he was a heart tugging guy refusing to let go of his soon to be ex. Yet he's still able to treat a young newcomer on the scene with tenderness and generosity His tears and deep pain were totally believable. Bravo. This is a film that is mostly 'down', so folks looking for something uplifting and flighty need not watch. But the message[s] provoke lots of thought and even weighing of one's own experiences compared to the two lead characters. Who hasn't wanted to hit the road when adversity seemed unbearable, as Elizabeth does after betrayal? And who hasn't wanted to stay in touch with that other person you happen upon, hoping s/he remembers and cares and wanting for some reason to maintain that thread of attachment 'just in case'. Who hasn't yearned for recapturing love after one has let it walk out the door, hoping against hope. And who hasn't fallen in love with somebody who just doesn't think of you in the same way? After watching the film, I went straight to Amazon to find the DVD. Any movie buff who hasn't seen a Wong before film should watch this one with unbiased eyes, and even some who have tasted Wong's work before might consider a look-see.",1291939200,3,2243,4.695431472081219
3362504,5,B0014BDP88,"It's interesting to see what WKW does when he's got the liberty of the US's wide open spaces.  He quotes from Thelma and Louise!  Also, unlike his Hong Kong characters, the characters in this movie can connect and ostensibly become a couple. We truly enjoyed this.",1286841600,,264,4.717391304347826
3362505,4,B0014BDP88,"The main feature of this film are the characters themselves - the plot almost feels secondary. With good writing and acting, the characters are all engaging and three-dimensional, enough to make you care about them. Norah Jones - a wonderful singer - is very good in her first acting role here, portraying Elizabeth, the lead. Elizabeth discovers at a corner cafe in New York City that her boyfriend has been cheating on her. She leaves his keys there and returns several times afterward to see if he came back for them. Each time, she gets to know Jeremy (Jude Law), the cafe owner, more and more. Jeremy waxes philosophically over the many keys people have left there and the blueberry pie which is almost always left over at the end of the night.

Clearly something begins to develop between Elizabeth and Jeremy; however, she is still working on getting over her ex-boyfriend. She moves across the country to Memphis, Tennessee where she goes by Lizzy. Trying to save money for a car and unable to sleep well, she gets two jobs - working at a diner during the day and a bar at night. At the bar she meets Arnie (David Strathairn), a policeman who is an alcoholic and cannot accept that he's separated from his wife. It's easy to feel sorry for Arnie, although it's clear he is flawed. Likewise, just when you might get to dislike his wife (Rachel Weisz), you learn to empathize with her situation too.

While Jeremy tries all he can to reach Elizabeth in Memphis by mail or phone, she moves on to Nevada. Here she goes by Beth and gets a job at a small casino. She gets to know Leslie (Natalie Portman), a poker player who has lost all her money. Leslie convinces Beth to lend her all her car savings; if she wins, she'll share the winnings with Beth and if she loses, then she'll give Beth her new car. When she loses, Leslie says she can have the car but she needs a ride to Las Vegas to see her estranged father and borrow money. Along the road trip, the two get to know each other more. Again, Leslie has issues such as her inability to trust anyone, but there's still some good in her too.

I enjoyed the characters and the story very much. My one criticism of the movie is the director's use of slow-motion. I felt it was unnecessary for the most part and he used it far too often toward the beginning of the movie. Otherwise, the movie was rather enjoyable. It included some wonderful music and nice cinematography. There was some humor, but for the most part it was a drama with some elements of romance.",1282521600,,2516,4.453362255965293

It's heart-warming, and even if it's not exactly an academy-award winner, I encourage anyone to give it a try.

Despite its status as a low-budget, independent feature, ""My Blueberry Nights"" boasts a roster of A-list players - Jude Law, David Strathairn, Rachel Weisz and Natalie Portman - that any mainstream filmmaker would consider it a privilege to work with.

In her big screen acting debut, singer Norah Jones plays Elizabeth, a beautiful young woman from New York who, after her boyfriend dumps her, decides to head out across the country to try and forget about her past and make a new life for herself.  Working as a waitress in Memphis and the Desert Southwest, Lizzie meets up with a variety of colorful characters, including Strathairn as an alcoholic cop, Weisz as the wife who`s been cheating on him, and Portman as a compulsive gambler who lures Lizzie into one of her schemes.  In addition, Law plays a caf owner back in the city who introduces Lizzie to the delights of blueberry pie and who serves as the letter-writing confidante and emotional focal point the wayward young lady needs while she's off on her travels.

As conceived by director Wong Kar Wai and co-writer Lawrence Block, the vignettes aren't all that terribly interesting, actually, but the artful look and tone give the film a hip, sophisticated flavor.  And since Lizzie is pretty much just a passive observer of  the dramas that unfold around her, we don`t become as emotionally invested in the characters as we might had she been allowed to become a more proactive force in the narrative - though we're willing to concede that this approach might well have been necessitated by Jones` neophyte status as an actor.  Her work here isn`t bad, by any means, but then she isn't called upon to do much more than react to the people and events around her.  As a result, it's still probably way too soon to make any kind of definitive prediction regarding her future as an actress.

Still, the contemplative, lyrical mood of the film and the sometimes astute and touching observations it makes about both the good and bad aspects of relationships turn ""My Blueberry Nights"" - its episodic nature notwithstanding - into an enjoyable, if minor, triumph for Wai and his gifted cast.",1247702400,2,2155,4.831521739130435

This is intended as an adult film with a very ""moody"" style. Some people seem to think moody films are deep. Well, if you say so. As for Natalie's fans, whom I directed here with my tag, I can tell you that she doesn't appear until an hour into the dreary plot and plays a relatively uninteresting Vegas card-shark. Basically, this is someones attempt at making an art-film. As for me, I'll stick with Garden City.",1245542400,,568,4.419047619047619

3362512,3,B0014BDP88,"My Blueberry Nights is like a short story, but, to make a short story long, the characters come alive and the story gets longer. Indeed, it was based on an earlier short film by Chinese Director Kar Wai Wong. Maybe he should be called Kar Wai (so) Wong? It was just a short story's worth of film stretched out to 89 minutes. But actually, if you can get through it without falling asleep, it is pretty good. Kar Wai Wong likes to work without a specific script and he relies on his actors to flesh it out with improvisation.

Since singer Norah Jones is no doubt familiar with improv, he chose her as the lead actress. She doesn't seem like such a great actor, but the role didn't call for much range. She is just sad and hopeful that some guy she met will come back, but you know nothing about him, and little else is revealed about her. She goes to a caf&eacute; and leaves some keys in a jar, and tells the caf&eacute; owner, Jeremy (Jude Law) to return them if he sees him again. She returns numerous times to the caf&eacute;, hoping for word about her man, but she also returns for the blueberry pie and conversation.

=====================
Elizabeth: So what's wrong with the Blueberry Pie?
Jeremy: There's nothing wrong with the Blueberry Pie, just people make other choices. You can't blame the Blueberry Pie, it's just... no one wants it.
Elizabeth: Wait! I want a piece.
------------------------------

It seems, however, that she is not the only one with keys in the jar, as Jeremy also does. So wrapped up is she in missing her man that she scarcely notices Jeremy, even as she derives tremendous comfort from the blueberry pie and the conversation. Eating blueberry pie and crying, one night she cries herself to sleep. There is vanilla ice cream on her lips, and then later there is none. Did Jeremy kiss her while she slept?

Elizabeth takes off on a journey of self discovery that leads her West from New York, first to Memphis, where she meets a policeman (David Strathairn) also broken hearted for his young wife Sue Lynne (Rachel Weisz). Their story is a little film-within-a-film, and it's a short story that really works.

Next she heads out to Vegas, or more like a small town that has a casino or two--a small town outside of Vegas. Baker? Harumph? No, not Harumph. While working as a waitress, she meets Leslie (Natalie Portman), a gambler with daddy issues. She needs a stake to get back in the game, and offers Lizzie either her car, an expensive Jag, or a third of her winnings if she comes out ahead. It seems like Leslie did not win. Leslie says that she will give her the car, but she needs a ride first. While on the road the hospital calls and says her father wants to talk to her, that he might be dying. For some reason not fully explained, she hates her father. He is a gambler and taught her how to play cards. He used to brag to his cronies that she thought that Jack came after ten.

==========
Leslie: Sometimes your rhythm's off, you read the person right but still do the wrong thing.
Lizzie: Because you trust them?
Leslie: Because you can't even trust yourself.
------------------

Natalie does pretty well, but I've seen her do much better. Though she was having a bad hair day, there is a lot of chemistry between Lizzie and Leslie (not THAT much chemistry. Get your mind out of the gutter. Still, who came up with these names?). They just look like they are having a lot of fun together, two girls on the road.

All the while, Lizzie keeps sending postcards to Jeremy. He realizes that he misses her, maybe he loves her. The postcards never include a return address, but he calls and sends out cards to every caf&eacute; and diner in the towns her cards are sent from hoping the shotgun approach will find her.

Anyway, you get the idea. There are a lot of Norah haters out there, but she did OK. Kar Wai Wong really wanted her, and he built the movie around her. Her character wasn't a musician, and her dream, besides getting another slice of that blueberry pie, was just to buy a car. By making her character a mere waitress, they kind of left out the most interesting thing about her. I think that Norah Jones herself would make a better subject for a movie, and she could play herself. In it, a young girl sweeps The Grammies with a subtle blend of jazz and country, and backstage, for the first time, she meets her father, also a musician from India. Someone wanted to make that movie, but both father and daughter quashed it. Talk about daddy issues.

Norah wrote one song for the film, and Cat Power, also in a small part, did another. Other music was by Ry Cooder. My Blueberry Nights had very lush cinematography by Darius Khondji, with lots of night shots and neon lights. It was a subtle and nuanced film that didn't give in to cynicism. I wish I could give it more than 3 stars, but it was Norah's first film, and Kar Wai Wong's first film in English, so it was a good first try.

3362514,3,B0014BDP88,"""My Blueberry Nights"" features a sweet, delicate story perhaps overwhelmed by a too showy directorial style.  Norah Jones is very appealing, though, and supporting turns by Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Natalie Portman, and especially David Strathairn (as a troubled police officer who Norah meets on the road) lend gravity to the film.

A brief making-of/behind-the-scenes special feature is mildly interesting, but it's outdone by a half hour or so onstage interview with director Wong Kar Wai, which took place at New York's Museum of the Moving Image.  The interview is illuminating and interesting, as the director discusses the film and the differences between directing in China and the United States.

If you're expecting a lot, you'll find ""My Blueberry Nights"" a little underwhelming.  But if you're open to a simple story where emotions and feelings take precedence over innovative story points, you'll likely enjoy it well enough.",1233792000,,936,5.340136054421769

Each character seems to be mostly passed over by the world living with shallow and ultimately superfluous relationships while letting work or addiction wash life by them.

As the film progresses some of the characters are abruptly thrown into situations force in meaning to their lives and slowly, inadvertently help Elizabeth, Norah Jones' character, find meaning in her own.

The film is also very good artistically, particularly light and color of the cinematography is superb.  The performances all hold up well and I think it it may be one of both Jude Law and Natalie Portman's best.

They're not going to live happily ever after -- they're going to die of lung cancer and heart disease. Give us realistic intelligent characters who don't smoke.

Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well.  Jude Law is always interesting to watch for me.  His two Oscar nominations for ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and ""Cold Mountain"" gave much better stories and characters than does this film.  Darius Khondji, the Oscar nominee for ""Evita,"" does stunning work with the cinematography.  However, time lapse photography of ice cream melting on a blueberry pie might make me hungry, but it doesn't compensate for the lack of a story.  Law's Jeremy and Norah Jones' Elizabeth seem like they are destined to become romantically linked.  After nights in the pie shop, Jones takes off which takes her to several locations.  Rachel Weisz who won a supporting Oscar & Golden Globe for ""The Constant Gardener"" plays the sleazy wife Sue Lynne to David Strathairn's boozy policeman.  I actually liked Strathairn more in this film than in his Oscar nominated performance for ""Good Night & Good Luck""  He has such an unrequited love and such a tragic demise.  Down the road, Elizabeth runs into Natalie Portman's gambler character who seems juvenile, untrustworthy and spoiled.  However, Jones can't hold her own in frame with Portman and the film loses its path, as it seems to take a rabbit trail rather than illuminating the Elizabeth-Jeremy story.  Chan Marshall shows up as Jeremy's ex.  The big change in the movie comes as Jeremy tosses a jar of keys he'd been keeping at the diner.

3362521,2,B0014BDP88,"I really wanted to like this movie.  I remember when the buzz surrounding this movie started flooding in during the beginning of 2007 and everyone was predicting it for all kinds of awards beings that it was Kar Wai Wong's first English language film and the casting of singer songwriter Norah Jones in the lead role was particularly interesting.  I waited patiently for the buzz to turn into full-fledged madness but it seemed as if no sooner did the buzz begin then the buzz died and before I knew it the film wasn't even being released for a wide release and I had to wait until it was available on DVD before I could see it.  Regardless of the fact that it managed only one nomination (at Cannes mind you) I still really wanted to see this film, and so I did, and now that Cannes nomination baffles me, because `My Blueberry Nights' is very disappointing.

`My Blueberry Nights' gets off to a sour start.  In fact for the first twenty minutes or so absolutely nothing happens.  We see Elizabeth, a frantic stalker-type ex-girlfriend going in and out of a bakery where she continues to ask the owner Jeremy if he has seen the man she was last in there with and they eat some pie and she watches some surveillance videos and cries and she gives him her keys to give to her ex and then she picks up and leaves town.  I know that sounds like a lot, but it's not when you watch it.  It's slow moving and rather vapid.

In fact the whole movie feels rather vapid.

There are a lot of critics who talk about Kar Wai Wong's infatuation with lovesickness, but I really didn't gather that here.  I saw glimpses of it, sure, but overall the feeling I was left with was more empty than fulfilled.  Sadly this was the first Kar Wai Wong film I have seen (but I do have `In the Mood for Love' in my Netflix queue) and I am left a little confused as to why this director is so lauded.  I will allow his other films to change my mind though.

The acting is decent for the most part, excels in some areas and falls flat in others.  Norah Jones is beyond doubt a phenomenal singer and musician.  Her music touches my soul.  Her acting is uninspired and bland.  There is a part in the film when Faison's character says quite frankly to Weisz's character that he doesn't know what her ex-husband ever saw in her.  As he was speaking those words I was thinking the same thing, but about Jones's character, wondering how anyone could find her remotely interesting.  Her eyes are dead and she embodies no real emotion.  Jude Law is charming across the board; a little obnoxious in some areas but overall strong.  David Strathairn is stronger still as the alcoholic police officer Arnie.  His subtle outbursts within his own skin are far too good for the movie he inhabits.  Rachel Weisz is probably the most entertaining thing about this movie in the way that Thandie Newton is the most entertaining thing about `Crash'; a little uneven but uneven to perfection.  Natalie Portman is entertaining yet nothing impressive.  Her performance is decent, but doesn't really add anything to her character.

I also found the incessant, repetitive use of Norah Jones's music throughout the beginning portion of the film to be rather unnecessary and annoying.

By the time the film was wrapping up I was wondering what it was all about, what the whole purpose of this exercise was.  Sure, Elizabeth was supposed to find herself out on the road with all these people she doesn't understand and eventually realize that Jeremy is the one she wants to be with, but that point could have been delivered a little clearer and a little more interestingly.  I just found `My Blueberry Nights' to be a waste of talent and concept and apparently director, unless all of his films are like this and I'm just not intelligent enough to `get' them.",1218153600,20,3803,4.525622254758419

I was lured in by the cast and the art house feel.  Ten minuted into the film, however, I found myself wondering:  ""is this it???"".  I kept waiting for it to begin but it never did.  Jude Law and Natalie Portman were really the only interesting characters in the movie and their bits were so minute compared to the entirely lackluster Nora Jones that I kept wondering to myself if the rest of the cast would add this film to their shame list and forget they ever participated in this disaster.

As for the arthouse feel, think in terms of the cinemagraphic tricks used in music videos and video snapshots of subways in New York where everything seems purposely sped up and blurred for effect.  Now imagine an entire film of that.  It's exhausting.

As to be expected with such a gifted lead, though, there was some lovely music to keep me company throughout the numbing dialogue and impersonal directing.  Other than that, it's painful.",1217808000,10,1115,4.585858585858586

3362524,3,B0014BDP88,"There is much in Wong Kar-Wai's first all English production to admire, but the cast, the dialogue, and the translation of Asian aesthetics unto accent-dimmed performances is so pronounced we have no option but to enjoy the movie solely for its artistic merit while lamenting its prosaic shortcomings. The usual antics and brilliance of the director are all deployed to a whimsical effectiveness, if sometimes deliberately indulged. The usual close-ups and askance visual is present frame after frame, with opaque intrusions, slantwise peering, obstructed lavishness, and aided by the diner/pub setting the movie is infused with neon latency. In fact the plot is simple and very bleak. Action hardly ever takes place during the day, save for the occasional interlude which seems to be a way to mark as pronounced the comparative glare that the night offers. At times we have the camera slide its intensity along a bar or a table, stolidly stuck on a fork pricking through a slice of pie, or meandering about the outskirts of a bar, column after column, shadows crawling senselessly through a disorderly tension that seems innocent enough to hide behind the crevices of our visual. Overall the very Asian aesthetic quality of the camerawork tellingly foreshadows a candor that has us become voyeurs more so than spectators. In Asian culture it is best not to invade one's private space and here it is carried out to such beauty that it offers a sense of indiscreet respect.
Where the movie falters however is in its casting, of which some are excellent artists used in a middling unfortunate fashion. Jude Law and Natalie Portman are sensational actors but oddly cast in the drama. Their intensity is unique but too forceful for the narrative introspective layover. The graceful Norah Jones is very mediocre. She has promise but the flick rests too much on her inner turmoil to be successful since she cannot be the keystone of the narrative in a way to match the intensity and bravado of her colleagues. The story is very simple. Elizabeth is stuck on her boyfriend whose just broken-up with her. She will have to labor through her incredulousness and inability to let go. The diner's owner, played by Jude Law offers her a shoulder and an ear while terribly straining the poetic attitude of the atmosphere by introducing a dialogue that metaphor driven closes the doors it chances to open. In fact while observing the action from behind window panes or timidly joining the session while tip-toeing about a door left ajar we discover a tenuous delicacy of touch that is as fragile as Norah Jones' performance.
David Strathairn, cast as Arnie, the alcoholic policeman who cannot let go of his wife, strikes a rapport of morbid proportions with Lizzie. While on a lovelorn escapade to Memphis, Lizzie nurses her loss and begins to recover, but in the process as she learns to give up, somehow that same sense of absence transfers to Arnie who is separated from a wife who wants nothing to do with him. The perfection of his character study and depth only highlights the misses of the others, including Arnie's estranged wife Sue Lynne (Rachel Weisz). Arnie gives up on a night of madness and overglowing anger but determines to commit suicide. Enters Natalie Portman, a southern vixen with a penchant for gambling.
The neon-hued camerawork receives added sheen from a trip to Vegas on a brand new Jaguar, only to find out that the every win is also a loss. Ultimately that is the upshot of the narrative which is brightly demented by the braggadocio devil-may care sensibility of Leslie (Natalie Portman). The death of Leslie's father causes a reunion between Lizzie and the diner's proprietor Jeremy, who functions as the jar of sweets everyone is sure with due time Lizzie will find her way to. Time spent through glowing hues that distil an aura of hopeless references and tame performances that jarr all the more because uninspired while beset by the contrasting tenderness of the visual.
A movie worth watching, because of the addictive intensity provided by the camerawork of Darius Khondji, but the elegiac tone of a ""Chungking Express"" or ""In the Mood for Love"" is affected by the sobering vapidity of a plot that plays with the notion of loss and gain by using a maudlin dialogue and a cloyed, exhausted attempt at allegorizing by way of sappy, overburdened poetics.",1216252800,41,4373,4.918809201623816
3362525,4,B0014BDP88,"Kar Wai Wong is as much a visual artist as a film director and his fort has always been making beautiful, multileveled images on a screen that is trying to see clearly the outlines of character development.  Such is the case in his first English language film MY BLUEBERRY NIGHTS, a creation he wrote (with Lawrence Block) as well as directed.  While the 'story' boasts a cast of fine actors, the emphasis seems less on character delineation than on creating a cinematic stream of consciousness.

A New York Russian bakery/caf is operated by immigrant Jeremy (Jude Law) and into this milieu comes the newly jilted Elizabeth (Norah Jones - who also provides much of he sound track singing for the film).  She leaves her boyfriend's keys with Jeremy as a sign of resignation but continues to nightly check to see if her ex-boyfriend has shown up to claim them. This is the premise for the formation of a bond between Jeremy and Elizabeth, but without solidifying that bond, Elizabeth runs off to greener pastures.  She settles in Tennessee where she finds work as both a waitress and a bar maid and meets the down and out alcoholic policeman Arlo (David Strathairn) who pines away for his tacky, gallivanting wife Sue Lynne (Rachel Weisz).  Leaving that story piece unresolved, Elizabeth then moves to Las Vegas where she becomes friends with a young, loser gambler Leslie (Natalie Portman) who manages to waste Elizabeth's savings for a car on yet another misjudged gambling night.  Through this cavalcade of losers Elizabeth continues to write postcards to Jeremy and the ending is blatantly predictable.

There are some moments of memorable dialog: 'Sometimes, even if you have the keys those doors still can't be opened. Can they? '  'Even if the door is open, the person you're looking for may not be there'.  But for the most part this is a visual feast for those who love Kar Wai Wong's genre.  The plot is thin as is the dialogue and the actors work to make the most of the outlines of conversation that they embellish with their own spontaneous words.  If it feels improvised to the viewer then the viewer has entered the realm of Kar Wai Wong.  This is a film for art film lovers - it is very beautiful to watch!

However, Wong hasn't exactly sold out - he made the film independently and it was then distributed by the Weinstein Company. Wong's film debuted at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival to a less than favourable reaction and was quietly given a limited theatrical release and is now out on DVD.

Sadly, there is no real chemistry between Norah Jones and Jude Law. It feels like Jones is just saying the lines and not living them. There is no emotional depth to her performance as she tries too hard to act and it shows. In addition, Law is simply not believable as a working class cafe owner. Rachel Weisz also seems miscast, like she's trying out for a boozy, foul-mouthed role in a production of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-s-Afraid-of-Virginia-Woolf-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000I2JDEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and ends up vamping it up way too self-consciously. Wong's weakness is his absolute need to cast beautifully looking people in his films and in this case it was the film's fatal flaw. Natalie Portman is well cast a smooth talking con artist and the only one (aside from David Strathairn) who looks comfortable in her role. With her curly, light brown hair and brash demeanor, she reminds one of Karen Mok in Wong's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fallen-Angels/dp/B0002X7GY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fallen Angels</a>.

""The Making of My Blueberry Nights"" is your standard promotional featurette. Wong says that the film is based on a short film he made years ago and when he met Norah Jones in New York City, he decided to expand it into a film. Wong talks about casting the other roles in the film and the actors speak about their characters.

""Q&A with Director Wong Kar Wai"" was recorded at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City on April 3, 2008. He talks about working with singers, his impressions of New York and how the film evolved while he was making it. Wong speaks eloquently about some of the themes of his films and his working methods in this excellent, albeit too-brief, featurette.

Also included is a theatrical trailer.

Finally, there are ""Still Galleries"" with evocative location scout snapshots and publicity photographs.",1214524800,2,2900,5.75058275058275

8254852,3,B0014BDP88,"Quoting one of the greatest modern films, any time of the day is a good time for pie. Blueberry Pie. The Hong-Kong auteur Wong Kar-Way certainly thought so having made his first English language movie with the popular American desert playing an important role. My Blueberry Nights is a very beautiful, visually instantly recognizable Wong Kar-Way's picture even though his usual collaborator Christopher Doyle did not shoot it. Instead, Darius Khondji provided lush cinematography with lots of night shots and neon lights. The soundtrack is wonderful which is no surprise at all. Kar-Way was very impressed by the singer/songwriter's Norah Jones work and his idea was to make a movie around her voice, her songs and the mood that they create. He says that there is something exciting about her voice. It could be the blend of sensuality, melancholic longing, hidden passion, depth and obvious class that might have attracted the celebrated master of the modern romantic film. My Blueberry Nights is also a travelogue and the contribution of the Hong-Kong director to the American cinema. By his own words, he chose to make his American debut the road movie to learn more about America and to get to know her better.

The three stories of love lost, as the song in soundtrack confirms, have been told before. The main story concerns Elizabeth (Jones) who got dumped by her boyfriend and leaves the big city to get far away and to reinvent herself. She befriends Jeremy, the owner of the diner named ""Klyuch"", which means the key in Russian. He keeps the big jar on the counter where his customers would drop the keys for the ones they love to come back and start all over. Elizabeth's journey would bring her to Memphis, Tennessee, where she encounters the guy so crazy about his wife he could not let her go. Later, in Nevada, Elizabeth meets the gambler girl who longs to re-unite with her estranged father. The problem is not in the stories, anything but new, rather, in the simplistic, uneven and abrupt way they are told. In one of the scenes, Elizabeth says that sometimes things look better on the paper. Maybe it is the case with the film. There's nothing wrong with Wong Kar-Way's movie equivalent of Blueberry Pie.  It's just... overly sweet and sadly, the impressive cast has not much to play. Perhaps, that's why the female characters in the movie were so forgettable even if played by Rachel Weitz entering the bar in slow motion and Natalie Portman in oversize sunglasses leaning against convertible. And with all due respect to Norah's talent as a musician, her acting debut was not memorable. On the other hand, David Strathairns performance was impressive in spite of the short appearance and Jude Law was very likable as Jeremy. And there were Norah Jones' songs and the vistas of America the Beautiful as seen through the eyes of the most romantic modern filmmaker in his English language debut which is pleasant, good looking but simple, even silly and lightweight movie. It is very much akin to a first impression of the foreign tourist armed with all sorts of clichs who just started to explore the never seen before country.",1464220800,,3146,4.845724907063197
