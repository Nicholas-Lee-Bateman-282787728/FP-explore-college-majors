4390994,5,B004JHYTH0,"Husk was an enjoyable and original film.
Call it Night of The Living Scarecrows if you will.
There are some flashback scenes that explain why and how the events are taking place.
The explanation was no big revelation or anything groundbreaking but other than that it was fun and original.
If you like the idea of Zombie Scarecrows with nails hammered through their fingers as a weapon then you will like this.
Even though there wasn't non stop action I was still entertained,the acting was top notch and the story pulled me in. There were a few genuine scares as well,It had a very creepy somewhat old school feel to it.
There isn't any gore to speak of, but there is quite a bit of blood and slaughtering going on. That said, most of the gruesome details are left off camera and to your imagination.
I liked it and thought it better than I expected.
I wasn't fond of the abrupt ending but all in all a very good effort for this killer scarecrow flick.",1301443200,12,952,4.445714285714286
4390995,4,B004JHYTH0,This move looked great and had good special effects.  The story was actually very surprising and I had low expectations for what turned out to be a good horror gem.  I never write reviews and here i am excited to share this movie.,1301011200,13,230,4.325581395348837

4390997,4,B004JHYTH0,"""Husk"" was almost a perfect storm for me when it comes to a horror film:

1. I love ""rural"" horror films. From Crystal Lake to Gatlin, Nebraska, films set in deserted, desolate areas.
2. Scarecrows - From ""Dark Night of the Scarecrow"" to ""Scarecrows"" to the opening of ""Jeepers Creepers 2"", I've always been fond and frightened of these cornfield denizens.
3. Basic Premise - One of the things I hated about 1990's horror films through today, is the need for ""plot"" or complicated stories. Who needs it? Give me a bunch of people stuck somewhere with something trying to kill them.
4. Good F/X - And when I say good F/X, I mean the Tom Savini type of laytex meets red corn syrup type of effects. CGI has ruined many b-movies, often coming off worse than seeing a guy in a rubber suit with a zipper up the back.

""Husk"" does a great job in all of these departments. The setting is a simply run down farmhouse in the middle of a giant corn field. Of course the corn field is populated by plenty of creepy scarecrows, and you can't get a more simplistic plot than five people driving to a lake for a weekend getaway, and getting stuck in this middle-of-nowhere scarecrow infested haunted farm fighting for their lives. While not a gorefest by any stretch, ""Husk"" does utilize good old fashioned F/X when it comes a few nasty scenes. And whoever created the look of the scarecrows definately earned their paychecks as the things are serious nightmare fuel. The only drawback for me was the ambiguous ending.

That said, if you are a fan of fun little b-movie horror films, you'll enjoy ""Husk"". It's nice to know they are still making fun little chillers like this.",1298592000,8,1660,4.545150501672241
4390998,4,B004JHYTH0,"I really enjoyed the film...and it is the best scarecrow killer movie I have ever seen. I liked that it focused on characters, and not just on  blood/guts. Nice scares, great story, and good acting. I think that it is worth checking out, and I will be purchasing this on DVD!",1297036800,4,275,4.392156862745098
4390999,2,B004JHYTH0,"I saw this movie on the SyFy channel and be prepared that very soon a cornfield of ""plant"" reviews will turn up.  Keeping with the theme of this movie, let's call these reviewers ""Huskers"" but a ""plant"" by any other name is still a ""plant"".

Husk is not the worse movie about deadly doings in a cornfield(Children of the Corn and its gazillion sequels retains that honor) but it's not the best and although the movie does have a few good kernels, most of the kernels remain un-popped.

The start where a van of 5 gets stranded at the edge of the cornfield is pretty standard but its how the van gets side-tracked that's pretty cool as a flock of crows kamikazees themselves on the windshield of the van. Four of the friends make it through the field where they come across a crumbling old house. 1 of the friends has already disappeared and the rest of the movie involves the house and the cornfield but as usual the group as a whole are morons and venture out alone.

One of the friends is a nerd who has visions of long ago events at the house but he explains everything using a chessboard??????  The explanation for the cursed house/field is a modern take on Cain and Abel except this time the older brother is ok while the younger brother is the useless one.

So, the movie is pretty lame but for two salvageable events.  The kamikazee crows and someone uses a PITCHFORK. (maybe it's just me but I like pitchforks in horror movies).

Final thought.....the movie as a whole is as tasty as a bowl of creamed corn.",1297036800,3,1515,4.424460431654676
4391000,2,B004JHYTH0,"Yeah, I know that Husk doesn't come out on DVD for another month, but I watched tonight on the SyFy Channel, so I'm reviewing it now. Husk is a killer scarecrow movie that is derivative of other killer scarecrow movies. It's also derivative of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in that a group of friends get stranded and go searching for help. What they find is a creepy house with a dark secret. If you've seen a ton of horror movies like I have, then you've seen this plot, or some version of it, play out many times. Husk is rarely exciting and is often boring. The only time it's even remotely entertaining is when a scarecrow is onscreen and that isn't as often as you'd think. Can anyone make a fun horror movie any more? And how could I possibly like a movie that has one character playing chess during a crisis. And the ending is rushed. Oh, for that I guess I should be grateful.",1296864000,3,884,4.331325301204819

4391033,5,B004JHYTH0,"First, a world about great Scream Queens. I am not talking here about women who can simply release a nice guttural howl when attacked by a zombie. Nor am I talking about a woman who looks perversely appealing stripped to her underwear and covered in blood. I am talking about true actresses the caliber of Barbara Crampton and, dare I say it, Angela Bettis.
...sigh...
and, yes, Tamin Sursok. Like her more glamorous peer Julin, she has what it takes to play in the big leagues. It is an immense talent for acting, yes, and a talent for acting a certain range of roles that Shakespeare captured in two remarkable parentheses when he created the characters Ophelia and Lady Macbeth.
And a scream queen has to be game. Game to go wherever the nightmare takes her.
And as far as I can see, Ms Sursok is making very good choices, both with the amazing Cam2Cam and with this masterpiece by one Brett Simmons. A lesser talent would have his characters stop at the edge of the cornfield and reflect how it looks just like a horror movie, and maybe then the nerdy character Brian would try to score points with the cute girl Natalie by sporting all sorts of facts about the Children of the Corn franchise.
Instead, Simmons reminds us of the fact that on a pure, visceral level, corn is creepy. As are scarecrows. As is the slaughter of hogs. Just delve into this particular inferno and you're bound to come out with something putrid and juicy like the Cain and Abel tale at the heart of this little death trap. And instead of being an annoyance, Brian proves himself an able chess master plying his intellect and stamina against the demonic spirit...

4391034,5,B004JHYTH0,It's a crazy good movie that you will love if you love B rated horror films. We enjoyed watching it.,1402531200,,100,4.05
4391035,4,B004JHYTH0,"If you approach this film without expectations of ground-breaking auteurship, assuming a ridiculous plot with plenty of practical holes (cell phones don't work, people make less-than-sane decisions, etc), this is actually an enjoyable film. Creepy mood and set design. Fairly constant tension. Just enough gore onscreen to satisfy while keeping most of the violence unseen. Though they are never really developed in any sense of the word, still the characters are perfectly fun to watch. Most enjoyable perhaps is the unique approach to 'scarecrow making' - nails driven into fingers, the mindless mask sewing, the pure animal hostility of their vengeance. There's a truly great and horrifying scene in which a character is trapped in a car in the middle of the corn, attacked from all sides, everything lost but base fear and survival instinct. Scenes like that shine.

To fully enjoy this film, I'd suggest approaching it as one would an action film. Forget about the plot holes and simply enjoy the ride. It can be a creepy and fun little gem if you let it.",1398124800,2,1060,4.988700564971752
4391036,1,B004JHYTH0,"In this film, four young men and a women are driving along an isolated country road when their SUV is beset by crows flying headlong into the windshield. They wreck, one of them disappears, and the woman wakes up. Yes. The female slept through the car crash. This is the point when I began to have serious doubts about this film. I wondered why they would make such a choice until the girl started to ""act."" I'm assuming she was the director's girlfriend or something, because she had all of the acting talent of a Chuck E. Cheese robo-band.

Anyway, our characters begin to get picked off, one by one, by malevolent scarecrows from the cornfield next to which they crashed. The boys discover an abandoned house in the middle of the field that may hold the secret to the scarecrows and their power.

While the rest of the boys were better actors than the sole female character, they still weren't very good. The plot is also virtually nonexistent. While the movie DOES attempt to explain the evil scarecrows, it does it with cheap and lazy flashbacks that, themselves, are not explained at all. They just happen. I won't give too much away, other than to say that the evil scarecrows have something to do with two brothers that live on a farm. Not a whole lot of info is given in these blasts to the past, which is fine, since it doesn't seem very legit anyway. I've never seen farm boys this well-groomed and coiffed in my life. They looked like what a snooty supermodel's idea of what it means to be a farmer, straight down to the impeccably trimmed bangs and eye liner. Anyway, it was distracting.

The characters don't really make any sensible choices or do anything that seems very interesting or entertaining. Mostly they just run in and out of the cornfield, which is exactly as much fun to watch as it sounds. There are rarely any wide or establishing shots, so it's virtually impossible to tell how big the field is, where the boys are, or even if they're about to be caught. The director probably thought that this ambiguity would've added to the tension, but mostly it just makes the movie a blurred mess of confusion. The boys discover, at one point, that there are specific moments when it's safe to go into the field, but instead of using that time to make a break for it, they gather stupid weapons, have more stupid flashbacks, or engage in stupid arguments that seemed written solely to draw the movie's runtime out to feature length. There's no real gore, so it's not even satisfying on the basest level of what horror movies can try to appeal to. It's just a bland, barely-thought-out smear of running, gasping, and yelling with no real pay off, no real resolution, and nothing at all to recommend it.",1389139200,,2720,4.581108829568788

4391040,5,B004JHYTH0,"HUSK

This film was released as part of the After Dark Originals series and in my opinion is one of the better ones. I own and have seen all of them thus far and rank this one among the top. I have always liked these scarecrow horror movies, even the really bad ones [Dark Harvest 2, here's looking at you]. This one though is actually good and enjoyable although there are some flaws. Still it is a recommendable movie especially since it has a Twilight Zone like feel, which makes sense since it was once a short film.

Five friends are taking a trip one weekend traveling through Nebraska, four guys and one girl. Everything is fine until crazy crows attack the car and force them off of the road. Naturally they land next to a crazy cornfield with a spooky house in the middle of it. So being that they are young and stupid they make the choice to go to the house to get help instead of staying on the road. So has they make their way one by one after others don't return they realize something may be out there with them.

I am not sure exactly where I would rank this among other scarecrow movies but it would be towards the top. It would also be among the top in the After Dark Originals, I need to finish rewatching them to actually put them in an order. Anyway I liked the way they played this flick out as it built up enough tension. The scarecrow costume looked very cool especially for a low budget film, and they make for good horror movie villains. The actors were good here although the characters were not developed enough, well at least some. But this is a horror film and you do need bodies but over all they did a good job.

Writer/director Brett Simmons did a good job with this film and turning it into a feature film. During the commentary you learn that this was a short film at first and he used that to get funding for the feature length version. It makes sense that it was a short as I mentioned earlier because it felt at times like an anthology show film like Twilight Zone or something. Also at times it felt like a TV movie but that doesn't take away much from it. It is still creepy enough to hold up plus the scarecrows look cool.

Now I am still not sure how I feel about the back-story here and why the scarecrows do what they do. At times it is cool but then at others it kinda takes away from it. I would have preferred that it was just a straight scarecrow flick with no explanation of why they are alive. But I think the ending made up for everything since I thought it was cool and creepy. Also I like the kills in this movie and ""Jaws"" like feeling of the cornfield. What I mean by that is much like the shark in the water the scarecrows seem to lurk just outside of reach. When you watch this you will see what I mean, I don't want to give it away. This was a good movie that I would recommend to any horror fan out there. The DVD comes with a good behind the scenes making of but it is the commentary that I highly recommend. It features Writer/Director Brett Simmons and the main actors giving some good insight into this flick. If you are wanting to see this After Dark series then this should be high on your list.",1366848000,,3159,4.197693574958814
4391041,4,B004JHYTH0,"Released in 2011, ""Husk"" is a pretty effective horror yarn about a handful of youths stranded in the countryside by a cornfield. They seek help at a nearby farmhouse and one-by-one they get picked-off by something in the cornfield. Adding to the mystery is the fact that the farmhouse is abandoned and something ghostly & fiendish is going on there.

""Husk"" is successful in creating a creepy environment and an intriguing mystery concerning the accursed cornfield/farmhouse. The three or four main actors do a fine job and the vibe is completely serious. Also of merit is the fact that the film was shot in central, Iowa, the perfect location for a horror flick about cornfields, scarecrows and farmhouses.

On the downside, the plot is very thin and the location is confined. You have the few main characters, the cornfield, the house, the crows and the scarecrows, and that's it. Plus there aren't enough quality female characters to suit me. Still, the movie works pretty well for what it is. I like it better than ""The Messengers.""

The film runs 83 minutes.

4391044,4,B004JHYTH0,"In horror movies, there are certain things that are just inherently frightening. Clowns. Puppets. Demonic children... and what we have here, Scarecrows. Sack-faced killers with various sharp farming implements are scary... FACT. Loaded with man-flu and with the missus out for the night, I was left to entertain myself and discovered 2011's Husk on my TV movies on demand service.

The synopsis offered for this film seemed quite formulaic but I would suggest to you that Husk is a little gem of a movie. It has been criticised for being simply another shoddy stabby scarecrow movie but I enjoyed this. The plot was in place (albeit fairly obvious), the characters were par for the course for a movie of this nature and the special effects were excellent; especially when factoring in the movie's reported sub $10,000 budget. The acting wasn't superb but didn't have to be; the film's storyline carries the actors along nicely. Importantly, the frights were most definitely there.

There are some genuinely creepy moments among the cornfields and Director Brett Simmons builds suspense and tension at the appropriate moments. The blood, gore and violence employed warrants an 18 rating in the UK, a veritable breath of fresh air when you consider the glut of horror movies that tone down the gore factor in order to achieve a lower certification and garner further revenue from potential sales and cinema attendance.

Comparisons with the likes of Dark Night of The Scarecrow, Jeepers Creepers, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Children of the Corn are obvious but this is a horror movie and certain archetypes are pervasive throughout the genre and I am of the opinion that Husk is a competent and enjoyable movie in its own right.",1352505600,,1727,5.031468531468532

4391046,5,B004JHYTH0,"I admit,having shrunk to the level of no expectations for lower budget horror flicks in general, and furthermore also knowing i likely was setting myself up for another crushing disappointment from After Dark films/SyFy channel features, I had no expectations for this film whatsoever. So,I was quite surprised to find it turn somewhat quickly into not only a decent horror presentation, but I also actually got SCARED AND CREEPED OUT more than a couple times, and for me,that's saying a lot! The subgenre of haunted/killer scarecrows is not for everyone,but if you get spooked by that concept or even are frightened by cornfields or creepy old houses, DEFINITELY check this out. Within the first half hour you've got realistic gore effects, solid directing and very good performances from practically unknown actors. By mid-way you've got nice twists & no played out plotting. During a time when it seems there aren't that many good directors/writers out there that seem to know how to give a fright these days,I found this movie to be refreshingly spooky. All the people behind this movie deserve a pat on the back. It's way more than zombie scarecrows, tho' that should a good enough reason for at least half of the people reading this review to give it a chance :) Not only was this effort professionally completed by a great film crew/good stunt people, I thought it was inventive and scary and as i said definitely GAVE ME A FEW JUMPS! The make up effects were great! The story could benefit a tad more by having had a few extra minutes to explain a few odds and ends, but that by no means takes the thrill and creepiness out of this movie. It was pretty damn good. And to the people that say this movie had bad camera work or too many loopholes, I dare you to do better. Stop griping,I thought this was great; i haven't seen a good quality scarecrow movie since Scarecrows (1988)! I truly enjoyed Husk and would watch again and will recommend to friends. Looking forward to more from Brett Simmons!",1347840000,5,2005,4.715099715099715
4391047,2,B004JHYTH0,"I have noticed that fans of this film cannot live with disagreement. They trash negative reviews of this movie. If it is such a good film, you should not worry about what others think. Also, it is ok to disagree.

I like watching horror films, but this one never really pulled me in. The major problem with the film has been expressed in other reviews. It does not do much at all in terms of plot development. Instead, within a few minutes, the main story has already exploded -- the slasher scarecrow is already stalking.

The production quality was pretty good. The film is very watchable from a visual perspective. The acting is ordinary. But the plot is basically nonexistent. To make matters worse, it starts the way so many other horror films begin. A group of young white kids are in a car, and the driver isn't really paying attention to the road. They soon have an accident. No one is injured, but they will now be stalked by something horrific. Even with that well worn plot, there was some room for a story to evolve. It never does in a way that is satisfactory. One member of the group can see spirits, and we get details from him, but why he can see spirits remains unexplained! That was a bizarre omission.

Final word:: If you're looking for mindless slasher fun - this will work for you. That's not how the movie is marketed, however. If you want something more interesting, then you should definitely avoid it. That's my honest opinion. I am sure some people will find this review helpful.",1341187200,4,1506,4.529411764705882
4391048,4,B004JHYTH0,"Horror movies normally don't scare me, but this movie had some moments that made me jump. I guess because I watched it for Halloween. Nevertheless, this movie had wondering the entire time if anyone would survive and make it out the cornfield unharmed.

This may sound stupid, but I think that the After Dark Originals, Are trying to be something, there not. They are B Movies, and i feel as if the producers, are trying to make it like a High budget, horror Flick, and it just doesn't work. The Acting was really good, and had some decent Gore Scenes, and special affects. and had a pretty good story plot. But, it kind of reminded me of children Of the corn, in a way.

 the farm boys depicted only in weird visions had a falling out?  It wasn't clear, since the father was the meaner one, not the older brother, who did not deserve the fate inflicted on him by the younger one.

Then, in the present day, the avenging spirit is somehow still around and seeking vengeance on anyone, in this case a group of hapless travelers.  How does one of them manage to see the visions mentioned earlier?  We will never know.

Aside from that, this is creepily shot in an Iowa cornfield, and the makeup  and effects are quite good, along with the acting.",1313193600,2,579,4.5
4391051,4,B004JHYTH0,"WOW!  Was I ever surprised by this one!  I'll start by saying that I HATE scarecrows--always have; always will.  And when a group of teens wreck because their car is ""attacked"" by crows, they learn to hate them as well.  What sets ""Husk"" apart from many movies of its genre is the direction, pacing, and acting--all of which are exceptional.  The viewing audience isn't bored to death with some hackneyed back-story of a legend, and you don't have to endure yet another remake of ""Children of the Corn.""  The scares happen in daylight, as well as darkness, and there's just a sinister air about this movie.

If more movie makers would just realize it doesn't take that much to scare the dickens out of people AND if you've got a script that's pretty tight, you'll have yourself a decent movie.  I'm disappointed the movie did not receive any wider distribution, but I'm sure that's because of its pre-judged worth.

""Husk"" gave me the willies and makes my viewing of all those other pieces of crap worth it because I finally found a true diamond in the rough.  Very highly recommended.",1312934400,,1085,4.663157894736842
4391052,1,B004JHYTH0,"I have seen all the previous After Dark movies and this has to be rated as one of the worst.  Not that I expect much from a horror, but character develoment was non-existent.  The acting was not bad, they seemed to do their best around a sloppy plot.  I cannot believe anyone giving this movie 5 stars...if 5 stars mean that this is top of the line and movies do not get any better...then I will start reading books exclusively.",1306022400,,428,4.325
4391053,4,B004JHYTH0,"When it comes to the world of low budget horror there is really nothing better then a ravenous killer scarecrow. Not really sure what the lure to this idea is, but the concept is something that we just can't get enough of. In fact Sid may entertain writing his own scarecrow movie after the completion of Death Ring 2: Apache's revenge. Or maybe even combine a killer scarecrow into the Death Ring sequel. At any rate, Husk was an entry from the After Dark series that's been in circulation for the past few years. Some of the series films have been just awful while others have been good good great stuff. Despite the odds being about 50/50 we simply had to go for it. In the end all the trades worked out and we wound up with a really entertaining little horror flick.

Husk opens up in typical low budget horror fashion with a SUV filled with college kids taking a little road trip. All of a sudden an entire flock of crows comes smashing into the window, forcing them to crash. Once they come to they're stuck in the middle of nowhere surrounded by a cornfield. In the distance they see a creepy old farmhouse which they decide is their only hope. Obviously this is the beginning of the end for our crew once they start getting attacked by a possessed scarecrow. If I was there I'd be like ahhhh sweet. The scarecrow is pretty legit too. Probably one of the creepiest the old boy Sid has ever seen. His mask looked a lot like the little pumpkinhead kid from Trick 'r Treat, with the creepy twisted smile and all.

So to sum it up; Husk is certainly worth the watch if you're in the market for some murderous scarecrow B. There's a lot more to the story the Sid didn't want to give away, so there's actually a pretty decent plot cooking here. Our favorite actor had to be Mclovin's cousin who just the right amount of nerd bar in him to be likeable. Right off the bat you're envisioning this kid getting demolished once he steps foot in the cornfield. However he turns out to be way better then we expected. Plus he starts having this insane visions like he's having a horrible acid trip, so we were all about that.",1305504000,2,2118,4.373096446700508
4391054,4,B004JHYTH0,"It seems corn lends itself to puns, just as cornfields and scarecrows lend themselves to being features in horror films. But while the setting for this thriller might not be unusual, the execution of ""Husk"" is unusually well-done and chilling.

The back-story of the ""stalking"" is a bit strained as far as providing explanation. However the characters' grisly dilemma defies explanation.

If this movie were to get wider circulation, its burlap scarecrow masks would probably become as much a staple of Halloween-wear as Jason's hockey mask or as Scream's mocking ghost-mouth agape mask. Actually, the ""Husk"" scarecrow is more truly terrifying than those other iconic fabrications.

All the visuals here are superbly done. The old farmhouse where the young people are stranded was a real location and becomes a character in its own right. It's like one of the Mystery Houses in a computer ""Find the Hidden Objects"" game. It's an eerie, dim clutter of dusty details. Find the old bicycle pump, the glass milk bottles, the knife. Some scenes are likely to be etched in your memory. There are the ghastly figures working away on the old treadle sewing machine. There are the ambiguously dead-alive scarecrows hanging crucified on their stakes. Then the final scene featuring the scarecrow that the director/actors have dubbed ""Smiley"" in their disc commentary - is the ultimate forebodding. This is not your email smiley emoticon.

All in all, this movie is deliciously ma-cob.",1304640000,,1474,5.154811715481172
4391055,4,B004JHYTH0,"A few years back the After Dark Film Fest began. It started with 8 films shown over 8 nights, horror films that might not have seen release had it not been for this small fest. And from the start it was hit or miss, some good and some not so good horror films. But when they were good they were some of the best horror films to be seen, many small films without major studio budgets or push, but scary none the less. Among the current releases to DVD, HUSK proves to be one of the scary ones.

A group of friends are off for a weekend trip (aren't they always?). Brian (Wes Chatham) and Natalie (Tammin Sursock) are the couple of the four, together for a while now. Chris (C.J. Thomason) is the smart aleck, the party animal of the group, somewhat jealous at what he feels is the loss of his best friend Brian. Rounding out the group is Scott (Devon Gray), the glasses wearing nerd of the pack, ready for some fun and to finally find a girl over the weekend.

As they head to a weekend of partying on the beach of some lake, they travel down a dirt road that passes between row upon row of corn. When a freak bird attack busts up their windshield causing them to wreck their car, Brain and Scott go in search of help. From the roof of the car they think they see a house and head that direction. Remaining behind, Chris and Natalie form a truce and wait for their friends until Natalie see what she thinks is a boy in the cornfield (no one has heard of Stephen King in one of these movies). Heading that direction she is dragged off by something unseen while Chris chases after.

Reuniting with Brian and Scott they determine something is not right. Worried that something terrible is happening with Natalie, Brian sets off to find her. In the meantime Scott has visions of what is going on, relating back to the original owners of the farmhouse and a troubled young man who gets involved in evil rituals involving the scarecrows seen on the farm. As a person falls victim to the evil and is killed, it takes possession of their body and transforms them into the physical manifestation in the field.

Filled with all sorts of jump moments and creepy visuals, HUSK is scary at times offering a nice mix of in your face portions with skin crawling scenes. There have been other films to use the whole scarecrow as a scary killing character, but this one adds a new twist in their formation and makes them seem perhaps a bit more chilling. The film seems to pull minor ideas from other films but not enough to be called a rip off. Instead, it pulls those ideas together in a new and different way that makes it a story unto itself.

The acting here for what some would consider unknowns is believable and each actor makes the role their own. The photography is great considering much of the story takes place at night in the dark. Too many good horror films have been ruined by not being able to see anything. That's not the case here. When something is hidden from view its due to the director wanting that, not an incompetent director of photography.

The weakest portion of the movie might be the jump into the whole inter-relationship story. It doesn't slowly unfold, we find ourselves in the middle of it and have to assume so much so fast. It's not enough of a problem to ruin the film, but for some that might seem too contrived to suit them.

On the whole this is a satisfying horror film with a touch of gore, a nice story and a great villain that gives you shivers. So turn out the lights, pop in this DVD and prepare for a nice scare. If you dare.",1304467200,2,3555,4.336842105263158
4391056,5,B004JHYTH0,"Vacations and horror go together like unicorns and glitter. Usually the horror starts with the vacation. And usually the horror starts because the vacationers do something illegal, erotic, silly, or downright stupid. And sometimes the horror starts before the festivities begin, and anyone has the chance to be a bonehead.
In the After Dark Originals film Husk, five friends, Scott (Devon Graye - Dexter), Chris (C.J. Thomason - Harpers Island), Johnny (Ben Easter - Zenon: Z3), along with Brian (Wes Chatham - In the Valley of Elah), and new girlfriend Natalie (Tammin Sursok - Pretty Little Liars) are on their way to the country for a weekend of refreshments, female companionship, and maybe a romantic interlude or two. At least that's what the plan was until a flock of crows fly into the vehicle, running it off the road. When consciousness is regained, Johnny is missing, the car is un-drivable, and there are corn fields as far as the eye can see. What the eye can't see is Johnny, so Brian and Scott decide to go into the cornfields to find their friend, and along the way find an abandoned car, deceased crows, a scarecrow, and an old farmhouse complete with ghosts and a story to tell. And Johnny's there as well, learning a new trade. While all this is happening Natalie sees someone in the corn and decides to follow him into the field with Chris. What happens next is a mix of haunted scarecrows, ghost stories, and friends gone wild.

It seems that the spirit of one of the boys that lived in the house was murdered by his brother, and now possesses the scarecrow in the field. The problem is that the scarecrows wear out and he needs new bodies to posses. This is accomplished by killing someone, poses the body, have the body drive nails through their fingers, and make scarecrow masks. Care to guess what Johnny learned to do? Anyway, our group needs to figure out how to make it through the fields, past the scarecrow, and make it to the road.

After Dark Films has broken new ground with their After Dark Originals releases. In conjunction with the SyFy channel, several films have been aired periodically, as SyFy Original movies, in their new film time slot, and Husk was the second release in this manner. This new way of releasing the films has not hurt the quality of the movie, and is in my opinion, the combination of DVD, and cable TV releases, is a unique way to have these films seen by the general public. This expands the viewership, and generates interest in often overlooked, but original movies. And Husk is no different. I found this movie original, tense, haunting and nothing like Children of the Corn, as I have heard some comparisons between the two made. Let's be fair, in this plethora of ghost and possession movie, this is one of the few that isn't based on an actual event, filmed with a hand-held or hidden camera, and while I'm not afraid to go to sleep or to church, I may think twice about exploring a cornfield after a crow attack.",1303430400,,3432,4.692691029900332
4391057,4,B004JHYTH0,"5 college kids ( 4 males, 1 female) are on their way to the lake for a little R&R. They are traveling on some back road through corn country when suddenly a group of crows opt to sign a suicide pact and crash into the windshield of the vehicle. In a situation such as that, the only logical choice is to drive your vehicle off the road into a ditch.

When the driver comes to, the passenger who was riding shotgun is gone. There is no phone reception. They do see a sign on the ground with Gen. 4:11 on it. This is a reference to the cursed ground caused by the spilling of Abel's blood. The writers failed to capitalize on the scripture by producing an earth tremor after each death or by having a phonograph which plays old sermons and starts by itself.

The cornfield is not planted in rows for easy access, but rather in a haphazard arrangement so college kids, who have no sense of direction, can easily get lost walking in a straight line.

There are a few things going on. The driver of the vehicle pulls out a knife and further disables it. The chess club guy has past visions of two brothers. There is a farm house surrounded by corn, where they think they can find safety and call for help. Guess how that works out.

No sex. No nudity. Blood, no real gore. Just scarecrows going bad. Good low budget horror.",1302912000,15,1318,4.281124497991968
4391058,5,B004JHYTH0,"HUSK is one of the best horror/thrillers in years--and here's why:
THE PLOT:  Writer/director Brett Simmons takes the oft-used 5 people stranded find themselves facing a murderous killer, who will survive plot and gives it non-genre twists.  The characters aren't the usual mindless, bickering sex-starved teens--they're fairly likeable young adults who we can like.  The use of the crows as the cause for their dilemma is chilling.  Simmons avoids the common ""sexy female is the sole survivor"" standard and gives us a fresh scenario we haven't seen in years.  Smartly paced, frenetically filmed and an ending that says ""Oh, wow"" rather than ""No way!"".  Great script!
THE ACTING:  A great cast--Devon Graye (teen-aged Dexter from DEXTER); Wes Chatham as the macho Brian; CJ Thomason (HARPER'S ISLAND) and Tammin Sursok (PRETTY LITTLE LIARS) are all great).
JUMP FACTOR:  I counted 7 times I jumped!!!  By using silence at times, subtle background music, and deft editing, director Simmons knows how to build suspense.

It's surprising how quickly a simple corn field can turn malevolent.  And as someone who has run through a corn field, trust me, it hurts!
I loved this movie, it's very basic.  Most of the `scares' are of the `jump' variety based on reflex and surprise rather than sheer horror.  But they still work.  I also liked that they managed to keep enough people around so you cared what happened to them (that's a key element most horror films, bent on a high body count, forget).

Case in point with Husk, a tale about five young friends who break down in farm country and wind up becoming fodder for a murderous zombie scarecrow.  Yes, you read that right.  Husk offers a few scares and some decent gore effects, but the end result is pretty lacking to say it lightly thanks to a clueless, predictable script.

Thankfully, it has high production value, which makes it entertaining in the moment even though it's ultimately your fairly standard gory, jump/startle-scare, supernatural horror cornfield film. If you know your biblical knowledge, they give you a clue early on about Genesis 4:11. I've always been spooked by burlap sack heads going back to Wizard of Oz and Friday the 13th Part 2, so it's effective here, but there's ultimately not much to this film.
