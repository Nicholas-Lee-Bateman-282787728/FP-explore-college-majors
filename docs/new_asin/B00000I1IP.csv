7909187,5,B00000I1IP,"We have the first one thru tenth on, are looking forward to getting rest of them. I don't know many volumes there is , but we want all of them.
Sometimes it is hard to understand all the words that are said,  It is very good movie series.
I wish the prices for the 12-14 volume would be some what lower in price.  It is exciting to see what comes next.
The actors all seem to be professionals.  I really like Con Managan",1426118400,,420,4.036144578313253
7909188,5,B00000I1IP,"I watched this series when I was younger and I absolutely fell in love with it!! Great movie great acting for way back when. It was done in the 80's and I was really surprised how even back then it was pretty good acting. YOu want a clean fun movie that you can actually watch with your kids without all the sex? Then this is the movie to get. The kids are very well behaved, they actually listen to the adults, they don't talk back, they do their chores, and they help out around the weigh station.",1407542400,,499,4.154639175257732
7909189,3,B00000I1IP,"I've been trying to watch this series for about 20 years. First, by rented video and now by buying volumes that I can find.  I would love the opportunity to watch the entire season, in order, at least once.  It's a great story, but it's never been popular enough to be readily available.  I enjoyed this volume as much as any of the others I've seen, but I've been forced to view them in bits and pieces, out of order and have never seen the complete set.",1229817600,5,455,4.206896551724138
7909190,5,B00000I1IP,"I have been a fan of five mile creek for many years. This vol. was the first Nicole Kidman was in. She didn't have a big part in it but enough to see the great actress she would become. The video is about the move from five mile creek & the problems they faced traveling to the Emu Plains. Floods,down pouring rain, hot temperatures & how they handled them. They arrive in Emu Plains to still more problems from the Armstrong family who seem to rule in the area. Very entertaining. Good familly viewing.",1011571200,2,503,4.361702127659575
