6192991,5,B00HNX29S8,I just saw this movie with my son and daughter and they both absolutely LOVED it! My daughter is 4 and my son is 11 months. He stood on my lap and pumped his arms in the air over and over again in excitement. I can't wait to purchase this on DVD! Highly suggested!,1406332800,12,264,3.9074074074074074
6192992,5,B00HNX29S8,I'm a pilot and found the movie well done and very accurate in many aspects of aviation. My wife is not into aviation and surprisingly loved the movie. I suspect kids will like the movie but didn't see one in the theatre.  The thunderstruck scene will get your adrenaline going.,1406246400,32,278,4.56
6192993,5,B00HNX29S8,"This movie combines so many different elements that it's hard to review them all at once. First, there's the central character's drama. After he's gotten good and used to the adulation his racing career brings, it has to stop. A 'medical' condition threatens to kill him if he pursues that 110% lifestyle. So, he sets his sights elsewhere - not lower (as he was to find), but elsewhere, and among others, each with a past of their own.

Then there's a ""little engine that could"" subtext, with plenty of setbacks. There's also the inspiring thought that a hero doesn't need to be a hero to anyone, or even known to be heroic. (""How do I get my picture on that wall?"") There's more in that thought that I realized at first, the notion of being your own hero, and a real one, not just an ego-fantasy. Also, self-worth through achievement instead of an entitled feel-goodism, and seeing many contributors making very different contributions, and the snarky sense of comeuppance when that self-serving bureaucrat gets his mud-flaps pinned back, it all adds up to a healthy view of what a truly good life can be, in terms kids can grasp.

But John Lassiter produced this and that's as good as a promise signed, sworn, and notarized saying you'll get technical excellence welded to warm characterization. Go back to his 1986 'Luxo Jr,' and give that talent thirty years to mature - that's what you'll see here. And, as a Disney flick, you have some assurance of kid-safeness. Granted, some of the fire scenes could trouble a kid the way the flying monkeys in ""The Wizard of Oz"" scared the goobers out of a very young me. Even so, ribaldry tops out with some off-camera bare-bottom humor (car bottom, remember) and maybe a fart joke.

And, through it all, the movie holds its reverence for the ones who put themselves in danger for the rest of us. It has irreverent moments - but hang out with those guys for a while, and you'll see more gallows humor and friendly teasing than the word ""serious"" could possibly imply. Yes, respecting those guys (of whatever gender) means respecting their humor, and it gets more earthy as the situation gets more demanding. The only irreverence comes from an honest portrayal of the real world's first-responders' own rugged joking, irreverent in itself already.

OK, it's a kids' flick. I'm sure kids will like it, give or take some fire danger and scary injuries. But I haven't been a kid for a very long time, and this worked very well for me. (Except for that vertical scoop scene - that might have jumped the shark.)

Another thing I really love about this film is that there are no really scary parts for my kids to need me to ""fast forward.""  That makes this film a safe film in my book and that coupled with the fact that both kids love it makes it a really great investment!

It makes it so easy to watch...you never have to worry about a scratched disc.  You never have to worry about losing the case.  You just have it on all on your computer / phone / ipad / etc.  The fact that you can also still get the DVD is nice too.  We use the DVD player in the car occasionally, so this is an option there too!

After winning the Wings Around the Globe Rally, Dusty suffers a career ending injury.  He ends up basically going to firefighter school.  It's a cute story about starting over, second chances, fixing your mistakes, and putting your needs aside to help others.  My 3 year old loves the Cars and Planes movies.  While the messages are great, he's super entertained and can't seem to ever get enough!

We really liked this movie better than the original Planes.  It was a better story in my opinion.  We were happy to add this to our collection!",1472515200,,985,4.254054054054054

6193244,5,B00HNX29S8,"This movie may not have been the most ""exciting"" Pixar/Disney film...but I love how they tried to make Wildland Firefighting (largely air ops) as realistic to real life as a cartoon could possibly be.  I also really appreciate the little historical things they put into this movie; largely from events that too place during the Great Fires of 1910 such as Pulaski putting 40 some men into a mine shaft to keep them alive.

Coming from a family (a couple generations now) of Wildland Firefighters, I know many in the industry groaned when they saw this movie coming out, I know I did (all we needed was a cartoon getting facts wrong, misrepresenting what the industry is and who the people are in it).  But those people who groaned watched it anyway.  They smiled, they cheered the characters on and there were even tears.

My father, brother and many friends will be mad at me for saying so, because they don't believe they are heroes and don't like being called such (and honestly most days they aren't), but they are part of a special breed of men and women who do extraordinary things.  And this little movie is one heck of a nod in their direction.  Finally!...a wildland fire movie that got almost everything right.  I cannot wait to pass this on to my kids, history and all.",1463356800,,1280,4.583333333333333

6193320,5,B00HNX29S8,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

Successful professional athletes, sports figures, and racers are often considered heroes, but Im not so sure that term strictly applies. Yes, sportspeople work hard and diligently, and risk pain, injury, and even sometimes death, to entertain us and remain at the top of their craft. However, they usually get plenty of money, perks, admiration, and adulation not to mention the best medical care- for their troubles. I believe true heroes are unsung; that is, they put their own personal desires aside to do the hard, dangerous jobs that most other people avoid to save others and make others lives better, with no expectation of wealth or fame. Professional wilderness firefighters certainly fit this bill, and the Planes sequel, Planes  Fire and Rescue (hereafter Planes: F &R) is dedicated to these real heroes.

Planes: F & R starts with Dusty Crophopper (voice of Dane Cook) literally flying high. After his Around the World victory in Planes, Dusty has been racking up the racing trophies and soaking up the fame and fortune. Of course, fate throws a monkey wrench (almost literally) into Dustys plans when his gear box starts malfunctioning. As the movie penetrates into Dustys metal guts, we learn that as far as I understood it- years of high speed have chipped away at the box. From now on, in a kind of reverse of the movie Speed, if Dusty goes too fast, he will break apart and crash. According to Dustys faithful fuel truck Chug (voice of Brad Garrett) and dutiful forklift Dottie (voice of Teri Hatcher), no replacement gear box exists.

Now feeling useless, Dusty mopes around Propwash Junction airport, his base of operations, until a new opportunity presents itself. Attempting to reach high speed again, Dusty crash-lands and starts a fire. The resident fire truck, elderly Mayday (Hal Holbrook) tries to put out the fire but doesnt have enough water. With help from several forklifts, Mayday pulls down the water tower to put out the flames. Despite the rescue, bureaucratic transportation management truck Ryker is not amused with the lack of firefighting protocol and lack of an additional licensed fire fighter. Swallowing his shame and disappointment, and wishing to preserve Maydays job and dignity as well as keep the airport open, Dusty volunteers to undergo training to start a new career as a firefighter.

Dusty flies to Piston Peak airport to begin training. He meets several characters just as quirky and colorful as his friends back home, like Lil Dipper (voice of Julie Bowen), a flighty (no pun intended) water-dumping plane who develops a crush on Dusty, and the Native-American-like, mysterious, inscrutable, laconic heavy-lifting helicopter Windlifter (voice of Wes Studi). Rough-edged forklift mechanic Maru (voice of Curtis Armstrong) replaces Dustys landing gear with pontoons for water landing plus wheels for regular landing. With morbid humor, he informs Dusty that unlike pictures of racing planes taken for winning, pictures of firefighting planes and helicopters are taken only when they crash and burn.

Dusty comes under the tutelage of Piston Peaks main firefighter, the all-business veteran helicopter Blade Runner (voice of Ed Harris). Like Skipper (voice of Stacy Keach), Dustys former mentor, Blade Runner is gruff, disciplined, and no-nonsense. Despite his best efforts to teach Dusty how to scoop up water from lakes and rivers to dump on forest fires, Dustys gear-box problem keeps holding him back. Since Dusty hasn't revealed his new handicap to him, Blade Runner naturally thinks Dusty is a stuck-up, selfish, goof-off.

Then a real emergency strikes. The Fusell Lodge (get it) hotel bursts into flame from a nearby forest fire. There is not enough water to battle the blaze because the vain, sycophantic (i.e. kissa$$) park superintendent SUV Cad Spinner (voice of John Michael Higgins) incompetently diverted the water to the roof sprinklers just to impress the Secretary of the Interior (voice of Fred Willard). He also delays all the guests from fleeing the approaching blaze again to impress the Secretary- until its almost too late.

Blade Runners crew, including skydiving smokejumper bulldozers, do their best to fight the fire. Blade Runner eventually gets damaged and must find shelter in a mine. He reveals to Dusty why he became a firefighter; he was once a police copter in the CHiPs parody CHoPs but lost his partner Nick LoopN Lopez (voice of Erik Estrada) in an accident he couldn't prevent. In turn, Dusty finally reveals his problem. Blade Runner tells him not to quit and what it really means to be a hero. Dusty goes off to get enough water to not only save the forest but also an RV couple Harvey (voice of Jerry Stiller) and Winnie (voice of Anne Meara) stranded on a fiery bridge. Again, Dusty must pour on the speed to get enough water. Does he have the courage to do it? Can he literally keep himself together? Will Dusty get certified?

In its broad outlines, the plot and structure of Planes: F & R closely resembles its predecessor Planes in its student/master relationship, respecting elders experience, and overcoming personal obstacles to succeed. But this time, it shows Dusty becoming a better person because his success is no longer selfish, but beneficial to others. As he encounters the photorealistic flames, fallen trees, and rushing river rapids, as well as the meticulous technological aspects of firefighting, we urge Dusty to complete his baptism of fire and become a real hero. Planes: F & R makes his journey harrowing, humorous, instructive, intelligent, suspenseful, and inspiring. Firefighters, and anyone else, in my opinion, watching this movie will feel their spirits uplifted (again, no pun intended).",1454976000,,5753,5.144385026737968

Or perhaps a third movie.  I will say, as many times as I've watched this with him (in the hundreds, surely, by now), I'm still not tired of it and I still tear up at times. Great family movie!",1428710400,,355,4.071428571428571
6193688,4,B00HNX29S8,"Let's face it, we buy the movie. ""Planes Fire & Rescue"" is a nice movie. The CG is very good (some of the fire scenes are incredible), the story is predictable but pleasant and we not only get lots of familiar characters but we meet a lot of new ones too. The movie is only 3 stars but this boxed set is better than that. Besides the excellent transfer of the Blu-ray & DVD versions of the film it comes with a digital copy you can use on any computer (I have it on iTunes in mine) as well as the DisneyMovieRewards. Both of these make the film and extras available to stream from anywhere.

My one disappointment is that there is no 3D version available. This is a decision Disney started with the release of Frozen in the US and they have continued it. I like to have the 3D available.",1428537600,,787,4.177631578947368

6193727,5,B00HNX29S8,"I didn't like the first one, which just didn't gel and seemed more intent on being a plane version of 'Cars', but this one, I definitely did like.  It had the usual stereotypes, which I wish Disney would try harder to avoid, but it also had some counter stereotypes (like a 'female' fire jumper, and though, 'fan girl-ish' a female fire fighting plane as well...just like Planes, unlike Cars, broke some of the usual stereotypes and had a female mechanic.  So kudos to the Planes line and Disney for that.

Also kudos for the more thrilling, realistic, and sensitive storyline in this movie...which adds urgency, life and death, sacrificial moments, and adventure that the first planes' movie lacked.  It also showcased the real danger and real responsibility that fire fighters and forest fire fighters face every day, and the issues the forest service also faces (there really are political players like shown in the movie in the forest service who divert funds for their own personal greater glory...not the safety of the forests, the visitors to the forests or even the historic lodges in the national forests).  So the 'villain' and his motivation was well grounded in reality as well.

I think this movie worthy of one's animation and Disney collection, and it was obvious the people that made it really worked hard on all aspects of it from the storytelling through to the technical aspects.",1425772800,,1398,4.9025423728813555
6193728,2,B00HNX29S8,"I would pass on this movie.  You'll still enjoy DIsneyland and you won't be missing anything when the characters come around.

No memorable soundtrack songs.

6193736,5,B00HNX29S8,This the next movie in the plane movies made by Disney. They are also made by the someone's who made the cars movies.

He takes on the needed helper of the fire department to help keep the airport open. But he learns that he needs to hear and act to what other say.

A good story combined with great characters does the job.  Add to that improvements in the CGI and you have a movie that is fun to watch for the whole family.  The scenes of an entire forest on fire alone make it worth the price.

And please stop to read the dedication at the beginning of the movie.  If Walt and Roy were still around, I am sure they would be proud to have their family name on a film that starts, runs, and finishes like this one.",1418774400,,578,4.209090909090909

I just didn't care about the characters and I rolled my eyes at the attempts to pull a laugh out of the kids using bathroom humor.  Planes Fire and Rescue though, now this is a different picture all together.

The kids once again loved the characters and the flying, but I felt myself getting hooked on the story and character development.  It became a classic for us during the summer and once released on Blu Ray, I had to buy it.  It makes me wonder, to complete the trilogy, if the third movie is going to be even better?

The story, as is all to common these days, can be deduced from the trailers. What's so enjoyable here is the way little details are woven in. CHoPs is just one such example.

Also, this may be one of the best uses of AC/DC's Thunderstruck in a movie!",1417910400,,428,4.144578313253012

6194281,3,B00HNX29S8,"For all their good intentions and attention to detail, this animated feature failed to enthrall me.  It's pretty to look at but devoid of any real sentiment.  Everything feels overly manufactured purely for effect.  (I expect a certain amount of manipulation in a plot but this was well over the accepted quota.  I never appreciate being talked down to.)  Also, it is difficult to bond with an inanimate object that's animated to be overly cutesy, that relies too heavily on the personality that's injected courtesy of the voice actor.  I found that I didn't like Dusty Crophopper (Dane Cook) all that much.  It's impossible to find anything redeeming in a self-centered, stubbornly stupid vehicle who spends the bulk of the film feeling sorry for himself because he overly stressed his gearbox while showing off.  In the end, I couldn't recall a single character or circumstance with any vividness.

6194338,3,B00HNX29S8,"This movie was cheaper than the original Planes so we decided to rent it. It's basically a rip off of Cars. Many similar characters, scenes and situations yet not nearly as brilliantly written and with much less character development. To be fair that may have happened in the earlier Planes movies, but I'm not banking on it. I wonder if I hadn't seen Cars like a hundred times if I would be more impressed. :-)

To it's credit, the scenery was beautifully done, and the action was fairly realistic. The planes and other vehicles were likable. There were some good sequences that were not overdone. There was not a lot of bad language, questionable humor or excessive meanness.

However, there are a LOT of pretty intense forest fire sequences, frightening endangerment and accidents resulting in severe damage to main characters. It seemed a bit gratuitous.

My kids, ages 10, 6 and 4 did not care to watch it again, which is unusual for them. 10yo boy says: It was pretty good. 6 yo boy liked the bobcats(they were pretty cool), but didn't like all the fire. 4 yo girl didn't like the fire or drama and thought it was too scary. Mom admired the masterful artwork and winced at the less-than-stellar plot and script.",1416355200,7,1217,4.677570093457944

6194360,3,B00HNX29S8,"The first Planes movie was a cash grab, in the vein of Cars 2, so I went into this movie with similar expectations. For the most part, though, this movie is a step above its predecessor.

The story is predictable and not really filled with twists. Disneytoon continues to struggle to fill their movies with as much soul in the story as Pixar of old, but the plot is serviceable. Facing the end of his racing career due to a malfunctioning part, Dusty joins a fire brigade. That's...pretty much the entirety of the story. It would have been dull, but it was saved by some unique and entertaining characters, and ends up being a good experience to watch.

Disney must be commended for the atmosphere of this movie. The set pieces are beautifully rendered, and the rousing score by Mark Mancini keeps you immersed in the world and makes it hard to look away, even if the story doesn't grab you. You can almost take it for granted these days, but Disney creates some of the most breathtaking computer animated worlds, and Planes: Fire and Rescue proudly shows off the state of the art.

All in all, I found it to be more enjoyable than its predecessor, lacking in depth but charming enough for the price of admission. Kids will enjoy this immensely, if my son's 4 viewings of this movie in one day are any indication.",1416182400,2,1313,4.531645569620253

As this will be a Christmas gift, we rented it from Amazon and were surprised that we got it for 3 nights (we thought it was a 24 hour rental), so the boys were thrilled to watch it again and again!

They both literally started reading books instead while it was on, about half-way through.  I finally told them that if they weren't going to watch it I was going to stop it so we could watch something else and finish another time over the weekend when they felt more like focusing on it.  They were just fine with that, and never asked to watch it again.  My kids loved Cars and Cars II,  but never connected much with the original Planes though we saw it in the theater and they seemed to enjoy that more.

The outtake bonus features--
One of them had us rolling in laughter (the one with the air-filled corn man). What creative producers!
I left off a star because all
of the intensity of the fires made it less relaxing to watch than the first Planes, in my opinion. But still an amazingly done show.
 There are laughs, teamwork,  and heartwarming moments that endear
us to these films .
  I think my 4 girls, ages 6-11 would give it 4.5.
  My son, gives it a solid 5! He would watch it every day if we let him.",1415836800,,571,4.1454545454545455
6194427,4,B00HNX29S8,"Planes is a bit of an odd franchise no matter how you slice it and the latest addition to the proposed trilogy, Fire & Rescue really doesnt do much to deviate from the oddity of it all.  Part of what makes the series as a whole so odd is the way it came to be: beginning with the Pixar mega-franchise Cars, Disney had decided to go the direct-to-dvd route with a trilogy of films taking place in that same universe, just a little higher off the ground.  Then, because there was a gap in their CG animated theatrical feature schedule, Planes was given the silver screen upgrade at the proverbial zero-hour; an unexpected move turned even more surprising considering the Planes films were done by DisneyToon Studios, the 44-employee outfit known for specializing in direct-to-video projects.

Long story short, the original Planes somehow defied the odds and proved a very lucrative theatrical run.  That leads us to Fire & Rescue, the middle child of the Planes trilogy.  Or the first sequel to the spin-off of Cars.  When viewed under these circumstances, logic would suggest this piece to be an utter disaster and yet it manages to deliver on some pretty lofty story telling ambitions.  No, its never quite able to capture the military-like narrative precision weve come to expect from Pixar or even Disney itself of late (with films like Tangled, Frozen and Big Hero 6), it does put together enough elements to get the job done.

The story continues on the exploits of lowly crop duster turned global race champion Dusty Crophopper, though, almost as quickly as his meteoric rise to racing stardom, turns him into a forest fire battling SEAT this time around (thats single engine air tanker for those not overly familiar with aerial firefighting terminology).

Spread across 84-minutes, Fire & Rescue starts almost like a direct continuation of the first movie, recapping some of Dustys aerial antics on route to racing victories.  However, it doesnt take long before we learn of a new Achilles heel for poor Dusty, having apparently completely recovered from his fear of heights in the first film, this time his engines internal gearbox seems to be failing and thus preventing him from achieving optimal speed.

At the same time as his apparent inability to continue racing, a new dilemma in the airports fire safety protocol allows for an opportunity for Dusty to train with a dedicated firefighting crew.  From there the film pretty steadily balances training segments with action-laden firefighting and rescuing.

The good news in all of this is that the tired-beyond-measure racing plot element with underdog beating the odds and winning has not been recycled again here.  The bad news is that the films pacing is quite inconsistent; starting out slow, building fairly steadily then concluding entirely too quickly and formulaic.  What this leaves the viewer feeling in the end is a sort of waiting for something to arrive that never manifests.  Younger viewers will likely be far more forgiving; adults used to the Pixar touch felt throughout the production will certainly pick up on the feeling of sloppiness.

Children, especially those enamored with playing with toy planes, trucks and trains will undoubtedly marvel at the action sequences here.  Visually the film suffers from many of the same complaints of the first- with fairly lackluster textures more commonly associated with direct-to-dvd affairs (which is to say slightly above CG television series standards but not quite the photo-realism of the big budget features) but this time the bar has certainly been raised with blazing wildfire sequences and some stunning water and spray effects.

The scripting is certainly sharp and witty at times, albeit rife with rapid fire puns that were surely thrown in to keep adult viewers in the fold while the youngsters marvel at so many talking vehicles.  Lines like She left me for a hybrid. I didn't hear it coming or a cheesy-pickup-line touting pickup truck will surely elicit a chuckle.  But perhaps the pieces truly cleverest layered humor comes in the form of a 1970s-style take on the cheesy cop series CHiPs starring helicopters called CHoPs.  Sure, there is no way the younger set will have any idea what this particular segment is spoofing, it does make for some welcome adult appeal.

In all, fans of the original film will likely enjoy the fairly straight-forward ride Planes: Fire & Rescue offers.  Even though this one boasts a bigger budget than the first, some slicker animation scattered about and a lot more characters (too many to keep track of at times in fact), I was unable to shake that uncanny made-for-dvd feel this time around.  Perhaps due in no small part to the final portion of the film, which really packs a bit too much into too little time and concludes in a user-friendly nature that promises sequels galore.  The shame in this is that there are some interesting themes and undertones being explored in this one; outliving ones usefulness, the finality of death (even for a machine), the untamed and terrifying power of nature, the true definition of a hero, yet the end result comes out feeling like a promise that Disney is far from done milking this cash cow just yet.",1415750400,2,5218,4.941647597254004

6194431,4,B00HNX29S8,"In this Planes sequel, Dusty learns that his engine is damaged and he may never race again and so he joins a forest fire and rescue unit to be trained as a firefighter.

When I originally watched the first Planes movie, I thought it was ok and good for kids but thought it used too much of a similar storyline from Cars. So when I saw the Planes: Fire & Rescue out for rental, I wasn't real excited to watch. But I was very surprised as this sequel, unlike a lot of sequels, was actually better than the first.

This movie has a nice message for kids and I found it enjoyable as an adult. The movie is funny and has jokes that both kids and adults can laugh at. For those of us that remember, Chips reruns on TV, the Chops reference was hilarious. The animation is great and the story is well done as well and more original that the first Planes movie.

Good for kids and adults alike and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. 4 stars.",1415750400,,939,4.120218579234972

6194508,4,B00HNX29S8,"Let's be honest... your typical movie critic is someone who aspires to wear a scarf in 90-degree weather without drawing inquisitive looks from others.  I would venture to say that most have not experienced parenthood, and those that have... well, can you imagine having a critic for a parent?  Everything you say, write or do would be judged not for what appears on the surface but for how they think the underlying theme or motive either contributes or stalls the furtherance of your character development as a ""child.""

Having seen most Pixar movies, including the entirety of the Cars/Planes franchise, I can tell you that P:F&R is further down the scale, but it's still pretty dang good... a lot better than some of the crap that Dreamworks has put out over the past 7-8 years.

Frankly, if your heart doesn't race witnessing the alarm of a forest fire, the controlled chaos of crew and equipment prep, the roar of a C-119 taking off, and the pulse of twin-engine helicopter emerging from a plume of smoke (all set to AC/DC's ""Thunderstruck""), then you're either already dead or need to get your adrenal glands checked.  The story holds the children's attention throughout, and the plot has enough to keep the parents modestly entertained.  It won't play as well with kids old enough to have an unlimited-text plan on their phone, but for the younger kids, it's perfect.

The one criticism I have for the film is that it definitely missed its potential... unfortunately, Dane Cook had to return as the voice of the lead character, but even if you don't recognize the rest of the voices, you'd definitely recognize their names.  But even with an A-list cast, it really comes down to the writers, and you could tell throughout that they were struggling to cram an epic, 3-hour story into a 100-minute film.  The intensity of being on the brink of disaster fighting a devastating forest fire and saving lives doesn't translate easily to film designed with kids in mind, but P:F&R did a decent job with the story, nonetheless.

My kids loved the Cars franchise, but the first installment of Planes had me trying to decide whether or not I'd even see this in the theater (let alone order the video).  Eventually, I succumbed to the pressure, and I'm glad I did.  P:F&R was in every way better than the original Planes, though not quite as good as the original Cars.",1415059200,2,2365,4.741463414634146
6194509,3,B00HNX29S8,"Great movie, but when redeeming the code for the digital copy via amazon instant video, Amazon accepted the code, confirmed it was valid and now it doesn't show up under my video library at all.  Seems to be a problem others have had and I can't find a way to contact Amazon to get it straightened out. Disappointed to say the least.

EDIT: Turns out that you have to go to the Amazon site, find the same DVD/blue ray you bought and ""purchase"" the digital copy AFTER you redeem the code. You will not be charged the price, and will see the purchase noted as $0 in your order records. After that the video will appear in your Amazon video library.  Amazon needs better instructions during the redemption process to note this. I don't know why it can't just be added to your library automatically after you redeem the code.",1415059200,3,821,4.46

6194512,5,B00HNX29S8,"Honestly I put this movie on for my kids while I was working on my laptop and I got sucked into it.  The story is about a plane, who from the first Planes movie went from being a crop duster plane to a world champion for flying.  He was determined and worked hard to achieve his goal.  Well in this movie he became a little cocky and went against what the mechanic told him and caused some problems.  He stepped up though and said he would help fix the problems he created by becoming an assistant to his fire engine friend.  He needed to become certified to be an assistant so he went to train with an awesome fire plane.  The story has some great parts to it that actually gave it a good story plot.  My kids loved the action and rescue vehicles and I loved the story.  I also may have teared up a little over a part in the movie.  It is a great story line and a movie that I actually won't mind watching again with my kids.  The lessons are great as well as it teaches teamwork, working hard to achieve your goals, dream big, not to forget your friends and responsibility.  My kids are 3, 6 and 7 years old and they all loved the movie.  Also, I honestly liked this one a lot better than the first movie, which doesn't happen too often.",1414800000,2,1239,4.116666666666666

6194515,4,B00HNX29S8,"The movie was a lot of fun and with most animated stories somewhat predictable. But at least it was a different ""predictable"". It was not a race. Many of the popular movies, Cars, Cars 2, Planes, Turbo and even Wreck-it Ralph, and Monsters U revolve around a race of some kind, and you know, somehow, someway the hero is going to win the race.

It does take a little ""suspense"" out of the story. It just becomes a story of ""how"" they are going to win the race. It's not really about ""who"" is going to win the race.

That is why ""Fire and Rescue"" seemed to capture my grandson's attention a little more than ""Planes"" did. He is 6 years old and a couple of days ago, he commented on the news story, fighting yet another California forest fire, that the planes dropping the water were ""just like in the movie"".

Not a great movie, like ""Frozen"" but a very entertaining movie revolving around a subject not seen since ""Bambi"".",1412035200,4,922,4.380116959064328

6194521,5,B00HNX29S8,"In the summer of 2013, I rather reluctantly went with a couple of family members to see the Disney movie PLANES. I am a huge Pixar fan and, as someone who was raised in mid-America, CARS is a much better movie than the critics have ever given it credit. However, in my mind PLANES was just a rip-off of CARS and a clever attempt to further milk the cash cow. PLANES isn't a bad movie, but it is pretty much a re-telling of CARS, but with a little tweaking , role reversal, and with airplanes instead of cars.

When I heard of PLANES: FIRE & RESCUE, I couldn't imagine the sequel being better than the original. However, after having seen the movie I can admit I was wrong. PLANES: FIRE & RESCUE is a superior movie to PLANES in every way. Its a movie that people of any age can enjoy watching and honors the nations firefighters at the same time.

In terms of story, the film follows the hero of PLANES, Dusty Crophopper (voice by Dane Cook). After winning the Wings Across the World race, Dusty has now become a world famous celebrity and made a very successful career out of racing. He has become one of the best racers in the world. However, a personal medical tragedy as well as an economic crisis at Propwash Junction force Dusty to re-evaluate his life. In order to help the airport (and get some perspective away from racing), Dusty volunteers to become trained and certified as a firefighter. Hes sent away to a training center in Piston Peak. While there he becomes engulfed in fighting a massive wildfire and, along the way, learns some very important life lessons.

For an animated movie aimed at children, PLANES: FIRE & RESCUE deals with some very difficult issues and questions. This movie is all about sacrifice and the meaning of a true hero. Its explores how people deal with life after their dreams and careers are taken away by no real fault of their own. It explores the choices people make in life and why people sometimes give up a career in the spotlight to pursue a career helping others. It examines the relationship between family and close friends. Thats not to say PLANES: FIRE & RESCUE is a serious drama. The movie is full of humor and jokes at several different levels. There are also all kinds of references to real-life places.  For instance, I really enjoyed picking out the different references to National Parks that can be found in Piston Peak (its a hodge-podge of all kinds of famous outdoor natural attractions from the giant sequoias in California to Yellowstone National Park).  The fire scenes are quite spectacular and might offer the only truly frightening thing to very young children.

Overall, although PLANES: FIRE & RESCUE is a movie clearly aimed at children, its a film that adults can enjoy just as much and does a great job of honoring the firefighters of this country.  Its one of the best animated movies of 2014.",1407542400,142,2869,4.591796875
