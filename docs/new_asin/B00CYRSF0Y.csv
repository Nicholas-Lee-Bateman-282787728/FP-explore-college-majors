I am looking for more dvd with more visions of near death experiences. I would like to get dvd with visual images of God, angels and the heaven and the universe as a visual meditation to intergrate the universe and images of Christ as a visual meditation. This dvd is very inspiring! Thank you,",1396915200,,453,4.469879518072289

Hearing true stories as they are related by the people themselves makes these far more believable.  It is a tremendous adjunct to the discussion.  I also appreciate the authors of the books not only giving their thoughts but also their accounts of encounters with God.  It brings forth heartwarming discussion as well as uncomfortable feelings of ""why have I not experienced this"","" can this be true as it does not fit the scientific model"", ""why do bad things happen?"".
It is opening our hearts and minds to the fact that we cannot understand everything and we must be open to possibilities.  It is also promoting discussion on faith, acceptance, concept of God, importance of love and prayer.  I also purchased the ebook.",1391385600,3,893,4.716129032258064
