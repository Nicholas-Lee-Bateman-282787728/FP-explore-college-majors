8359315,5,B002ACPNQ2,"An excellent documentary about this very mysterious artifact. I've seen many specials on this topic but this one seems to be the most up-to-date and informative. Hector Elizondo does an outstanding job hosting this program and moving the segments along in a very smooth fashion. The focus here is both from a scientific as well as a faith point of view. If this type of subject interests you, this dvd is highly recommended.",1522281600,,424,4.821917808219178

8359317,5,B002ACPNQ2,"I never saw this ducumentary when it came out on TV, I wish I had.  The ducumentary give the latest information on the Shroud of Turin, including some stuff that surprised me.  Did you know they have tested the shroud for DNA--and found some too! That took me by surprize. If you are looking the lateist results of the studies of the shroud I highly recomend this ducumentary.  It will give you something to think about.",1339804800,,420,4.5
8359318,1,B002ACPNQ2,"This is one of several videos I have seen about the Shroud, and I have been investigating this artifact for several years.  I found this video to be scientifically flawed in several areas and deliberately selective in its presentation so as to be deceptive to the audience.  This video was designed to appear factual when it only presents a slanted viewpoint intended to lead the viewer with the conclusion that the Shroud of Turin is a fake. Don't waste your money on this film.  There are several much more balanced films that show the most recent research and give a truer historical perspective.",1278374400,6,599,4.796116504854369
8359319,1,B002ACPNQ2,I bought this dvd thinking it would be cutting edge info and found it to only allude to important discoveries before veering off in the opposite direction.  Very disappointing.,1277510400,6,176,5.068965517241379
8359320,5,B002ACPNQ2,"This is a fantastic book. I have highly recommend it to many people. My husband is a scientist and he recognized much of the equipment they used to authenticate the Shroud. The amazing fact is that many things are seen with the equipment that could not be seen years ago or with the naked eye. To paint it would be impossible. It was proven that God still speaks to us into this modern age. The forensic studies are amazing. The Man of the Shroud, Our Blessed Lord, indeed suffered what was mentioned in the Bible and much more for us. It's a book that you can't put down, written by a lawyer, who spent many years researching the material to get to the facts. This is a great book to use for Lenten meditation. Take the time to read this book. He not only gave us these last incredible three hours but His entire life on earth for us.",1268956800,7,835,4.2578616352201255
