8004821,1,B0000ZG0M2,"After going to Ireland for our honeymoon the year before I bought a few Ireland DVDs as part of a gift for my wife for our Anniversary. Since there were a few to choose from I ended up buying all 4 I looked at...this one I wish I hadn't. While it was entertaining in the fact that host goes around to different parts of Ireland and jokes around with the locals they do not show a lot of the land.  We were hoping to get a DVD that showed a lot of places we were at (which were many), but this was definitely disappointing. This is more of a light-hearted look at Ireland without going into much detail.  The host is a little goofy, which made it a little comical (being a young guy I like comedy), but was not what we were looking for.  I found myself asking ""Where are the rest of the sights?"" after he would pass through a town/county and only show one or two quick spots. If you are looking for an in depth look at Ireland, this is not for you. Probably never watch it again and would return it if I could.",1303516800,,1009,4.060301507537688
8004822,1,B0000ZG0M2,"I was disappointed in this video.  If you are a fan of blurry camera work and sped up train trips, this is the movie for you.  There are occasional bits of information, such as the information on hurling, and you get glimpses of the different towns but it seems to have a lot of drinking in pubs and very little other than bike riding on back roads in Ireland.  The actual scenery of each area is a bit sketchy for me. I would like a bit more content and better filming.  I have been to Ireland twice now, and was hoping for ideas of new places to visit.",1287705600,2,554,4.101851851851852
8004823,1,B0000ZG0M2,"The host is delightful but the content is extremely thin. I have been to Ireland 5 times, for a total of perhaps 60 days, and I wanted a DVD to show my son, with whom I am traveling to Ireland this summer. I couldn't believe how little substance there is in this DVD. It was raining in Kerry, OK, lots of jokes about the weather but what about Kilarney, the Ring of Kerry, Dingle peninsula? It made me wonder if the previous reviews were written by friends of the presenter. This is more like a home movie with a charming but egotistical host.  There was more focus on the host than the country, really, what a waste.",1276646400,2,617,4.273504273504273
8004824,5,B0000ZG0M2,"This DVD was a certain winner for me: I love Ireland, I like ""Globe Trekker"", and my favorite travel host is Ian Wright: I was not disappointed. I have been to Ireland many times, and have always loved it for too many reasons to list in a brief review. In this DVD Wright visits some of the most famous Irish locales (Belfast, Connemara, Donegal, Dublin, Cobh, and Kerry, just to name a few), and manages to meet numerous unfailingly cheery people along the way; of course many of them are enjoying a locally brewed beverage to keep their spirits up!

What's not to love? Ireland is called ""the Emerald Isle"" for a reason: it's beautiful and green, the people are friendly and easygoing, and the historical sights are dense and interesting. This is one of the best episodes of ""Globe Trekker"" and I recommend it to anyone interested in Ireland. Better yet, visit yourself: you won't be sorry!",1263427200,2,892,4.6455696202531644
8004825,4,B0000ZG0M2,"but loved this one, mainly because of the host. He is a character and livened things up quite a bit! What a sense of humor!
The scenery was beautiful of course, and I liked hearing a few of the legends/tales of Ireland too.
I found it very interesting and a fun time to spend about 50 minutes learning about Ireland.",1234656000,,316,4.283333333333333
