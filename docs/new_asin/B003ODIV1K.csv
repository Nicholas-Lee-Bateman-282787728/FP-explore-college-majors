4162398,4,B003ODIV1K,"This movie exists on two levels - the first part that features Errol Flynn as John Barrymore, and the 2nd part which further chronicles the demise  Barrymore's daughter Diana, who yearns for her father's love. Flynn, in a superb dramatic turn, is unbelevable. Gone are the swash and buckle and sword play.  In this film, we see Flynn as a boozing, deteriorating John Barrymore towards the end of his life. For Flynn fans, this is a must see. Unfortunately he leaves the film too soon, about halfway. However Dorothy Malone is also superb as Diana, and her portrayal of a woamn lost to drugs in alchohol is mesmerizing.",1365120000,2,618,4.712962962962963

4162400,5,B003ODIV1K,"Finally on dvd!  This is a film I first saw on the late show as a kid.  Rarely is it shown on tv and I never understand why.  Sure, it's a little preachy, and many of the performances are a little amatuerish (sorry, Dorothy Malone, but it's true), and it's loaded with many stock actors from the 50's/60's shlock melodramas.  However, what it DOES have is a fantastic performance by Errol Flynn, in one of his last roles.

He plays John Barrymore, who happened to be a close friend of Flynn's in real life.  In his late 40's when he made this film, he looked so much older, not unlike his pal Barrymore. Flynn plays his part with such ferocity, such pathos and a great deal of sadness as well. I also find it remarkable how similar the personal lives of Flynn and Barrymore were.  Although Flynn was regarded more as a playboy, both he and Barrymore had very messy personal lives, scandals here and there and problems with alcohol.  Flynn's performance could have been an over-the-top caricature, but it is nuanced and portrays the heartbreak and desperation of someone in the throes of addiction, who knows he is dying.

Dorothy Malone's portrayal of daughter, Diana Barrymore, is okay, but not too subtle.  Also, the parts with her as a teenager were just not believable.  I liked Dorothy Malone and she later grew into a better actress.

All being said, Too Much Too Soon is a very entertaining movie and one often overlooked.  If you love 50's melodramas, this is for you.  If you enjoy a good story, this one is for you.  Most of all, if you love Errol Flynn, this one is certainly for you.",1350432000,4,1595,4.508710801393728
4162401,5,B003ODIV1K,"The story of Diana barrymore is a good one to know. Partying destroyed her life and career and it destroyed John barrymore's as well. She died only two years later after this film at 38 of a drug and booze overdose. Errol flynn who was a alcoholic died of a heart attack but his health was destroyed by boozing in many ways.  He still had good films in him though and if he'd lived longer would have made more great films like this maybe. Irony is the heart of this story, because it's about the perils of living a partying lifestyle and then Flynn dies at fifty worn out by just that. The movie is a powerful one and few titles of a movie were ever more apt than this one. I only wish Diana had learned from this flick and turned it around. She'd at least have lived a few decades more. better to go at 58 than when you are still young.  This is  a classic movie and the dvd looks pretty good.  It's a sad story though as john barrymore's addiction destroys him and so many others in this true story.",1327881600,,1001,4.144329896907217
4162402,3,B003ODIV1K,"Loosely based on the life of Diana Barrymore, the daughter of the legendary John Barrymore, whose abandonment issues led to a failed attempt as an actress and a descent into Hell through alcoholism and a series of men. It suffers from the usual clichs of these movie bios but two performances redeem it. Errol Flynn inhabits John Barrymore like a second skin, one can't help but connect the dots between the lives of the two actors. But it's Dorothy Malone as Diana Barrymore who carries the burden of the film on her shoulders and does it spectacularly. She's weak in the beginning but that's only because it's obvious the 30ish Malone is too old to play the 16 year old school girl that Diana was but once she enters into adulthood, Malone is sensational. Whether drunkenly doing a strip in Baby Jane make up at a dive or her pathetic embarrassment at begging a stranger for money only to find it's an old boyfriend, Malone brings a pathos to her debauchery. Co-starring Efrem Zimbalist Jr, Murray Hamilton, Neva Patterson, Martin Milner, Joanna Barnes and chilling as a sadistic gigolo, Ray Danton.

4162403,3,B003ODIV1K,"Way back in the early forties I saw if not all most of Diana Barrymore movies, I was only twelve years old, and the one I remember the most is ""Between Us Girls"", with Kay Francis in which Diana had a lot of changes, I don't remember why, but one of the personalities she took over was Queen Victoria.
In this movie it shows that she only made one movie and the title of this movie doesn't even come near to any title of the movies she made in the States or in England.
Her other movie I remember seeing was ""Nightmare"" with Brian Donlevy.
All in all ""Too Much, Too Soon"" was quite entertaining.

4162404,4,B003ODIV1K,"Intriguing autobiography on actress and famous daughter of John Barrymore, Dianna Barrymore. Drew Barrymore's aunt. Movie shows how Dianna Barrymore feels starve for her father's love. Errol Flynn gives one of his best last performances as his dear friend John. Flynn proves he could have many more great performances in later years. However, he had only a year left to live after this movie. Movie becomes out of balance after Flynn's character John Barrymore dies in the middle of the movie. Although I have much admiration for Dorothy Malone, in this movie she doesn't reach her skills as an actress like she did in ""Written on the Wind."" Dorothy looks young as Flynn's daughter in the opening sequence but her acting ability as the little girl is corny. Dorothy does much better at the party sequence, when she is seduced by Ray Danton, who goes from good boy from ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"" to a brute. Dorothy as Diana continues to drink and disappoints her mother, played by Neva Patterson. Neva was the warden in the classic Charlie's Angel's episode, ""Angels in Chains,"" who tries to turn the angels into prostitutes. Neva gives an effective performance, so does Efren Zimbalist Jr. as Dianna's first husband. There is unintentional humor when Dorothy wears heavy makeup and looks like Baby Jane Hudson at a strip club, where she is giving imitations of movie stars. She impersonates Garbo but is real funny trying to impersonate Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn was still living at the time. The ending has a touching scene Between Dorothy Malone and Martin Milner, Dianna's first boyfriend. Movie loses effectiveness as a comeback story from alcoholism because Dianna Barrymore commits suicide two years later from drugs and alcohol. Movie echoes Lillian Roth's ""I'll Cry Tomorrow,"" but not near as good. Who can beat Susan Hayward's performance as Roth? It is worth having in your collection because of Errol Flynn and Dorothy at least keeps your interest. Recommend for your dvd collection.",1298937600,4,1987,5.042553191489362
4162405,5,B003ODIV1K,"From about 1940 to 1950 Diana Barrymore made appearances in about a dozen or more films, some headlining, but mostly in bit parts and small roles.  While there is small reference to her career as an actress, the focus of the film, ""Too Much Too Soon"" is more towards Barrymore's personal life.

Diana Barrymore was born in 1921, the daughter of film legend John Barrymore and the writer Blanche Oelrichs.  She died in 1960, at age 38.

Although there are a few minutes at the beginning of ""Too Much Too Soon"" devoted to her teenage years, the film really picks up around the time Diana is 19 and on Broadway.  As a result of her Broadway stint, the powers that be in Hollywood decide to make her a series of offers in order to cash in on the Barrymore name.

In January 1942, Diana leaves the stage for Hollywood and in short order, takes on her husband number one (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) without much ado.  Things are rosy for a while, but Diana's drinking problem gets in the way and it's all downhill from there.  A few years later at age 23, even Diana reportedly considered her acting carrer as being a washout.

So much of her journey was detoured due to alcoholism, poor decisions and failure to reconcile personal weaknesses.  Diana's life becomes a nightmarish landscape which ultimately results in her crash landing in a rehab institution.

""Too Much, Too Soon"" is a Hollywood classic. It has held up extremely well since its realease over fifty years ago.  First released to movie audiences in 1958 this Warner Brother release was directed by Art Napoleon.  The screenplay was based on Diana's autobiography written by Diana Barrymore and Gerold Frank. The music score was by Ernest Gold.

The film stars Dorothy Malone and Errol Flynn with Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Ray Danton, Neva Patterson, Murray Hamilton and Martin Milner.

Although he gets second billing, Errol Flynn ""...steals the show as John Barrymore,"" according to the package liner notes attributed to film critic Leonard Maltin.  However, it's very strange to see Flynn portray his old pal John Barrymore in a way that parallels Flynn's own life.  As compared with the dashing figure he cut in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and other swashbucklers, Flynn looks much older than his 50 years, a victim of his own lifestyle. Flynn died about a year after making this film.

I first saw this film on television as a teenager.  However, to see this film in its entirety without commercial interuption was revealing.  While there are no special features or even an interactive menu allowing screen access, you can fast forward or backward at ten minutes intervals using the << and >> buttons on your remote.",1283299200,24,2672,4.77995642701525
4162406,4,B003ODIV1K,"Warner Bros. has released the 1958 melodrama, ""Too Much, Too Soon"", the fiery biography of John Barrymore's daughter, Diana. ""Too Much, Too Soon"" was adapted from the autobiography of actress Diana Barrymore, played by Dorothy Malone. Diana suffers from lack of parental love. Her famous father, played with boozy bravado by Errol Flynn, is gracious when sober, but a monster when drunk. Her poetess mother, Michael Strange(Neva Patterson) is preoccupied by her bitterness against Barrymore. In one touching moment, Flynn as Barrymore calls-up his ex-wife, making love to her over the phone. ""Dear fig, I miss you"" he murmurs. Sadly, in a minute, he's simply talking to himself. In an eerie night sequence, Flynn as Barrymore spouts Shaekspeare and strolls the deck of his yacht, the Infanta(an actual boat owned by the actor). A search-light from a passing boat fixes on his profile. Filtered darkness blocks out the faces of the Hollywood partyers. ""Hey Jack, come on over. Join the party! Have a drink with us..""The partyers giggle and laugh and taunt the man on. Dinae Barrymore's eyes look longingly at the father she needs. He needs something else. With a laugh, a snort, and another drink, Barrymore slips and falls over the side. He swims over to his friends. His young daughter is in tears. ""Too Much, Too Soon"" is casually directed by Art Napoleon, who also co-wrote the screenplay. Several future television stars have supporting roles, including Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. and Martin Milner. Uncredited in small parts are the great John Doucette, former Hollywood star Franklyn Farnum, and Flynn's 16-year-old girlfriend, Beverly Aadland. Flynn turns in a superb performance. His presence is electrifying. A stunning portrayal, the image of Flynn/Barrymore bantering drunkenly is pitiful and ridiculous. And deeply moving. In most respects, when Flynn leaves the film, the story grinds to a halt. This great role, and ""The Sun Also Rises(1957)"" re-energized the career of Errol Flynn. But sadly, like his champion, his life-style came first. Flynn died just one year later, at age 50. Too Much, Too Late.",1280534400,20,2110,5.190615835777126
8401574,3,B003ODIV1K,"In the brilliant 1952 Minnelli-Houseman melodrama BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL Lana Turner had expertly played ""Georgia Lorrison,"" wannabe starlet with Oedipus complex over deceased thespian father, her character implicitly channeling Diana Barrymore and the dead father haunting both daughter and Hollywood Hills mansion. Cannily scripted, that was (literally) the Cadillac version of the Diana story, with a bittersweet yet upbeat artistic cachet from its quality script by Charles Schnee. Warners' 1958 Diana ""update,"" based very loosely on the daughter's memoir, takes two long and choppy hours to follow Diana from 1938-55 in a trashier tabloid context (the film is a remote premake of MOMMIE DEAREST) not flattering to Diana, Hollywood or the craft of quality filmmaking. The shabby script was ginned up by spouses Art and Jo Napoleon, the husband directing, but the film is a fine showcase for some of Warners' savviest postwar studio talent. The Napoleons' episodic storytelling and choppy editing are smoothly concealed by a full symphonic score, in regular Warners Vitaphonic style, by Ernest Gold.

The late Dorothy Malone, fresh from her superior Sirk melodramas WRITTEN ON THE WIND and TARNISHED ANGELS, carries the long film decisively (Flynn appears only in the first hour) and, appearing in every discrete episode, is radiantly photographed in monochrome by Nick Musuraca and Carl Guthrie. Her strip-club (in lurid makeup and Orry-Kelly frock) and flophouse (in peignoir and no makeup) breakdowns are harrowing highlights, proof of Malone's star chops beyond vivid supporting roles. Flynn is jowlly but chipper in channeling Jack Barrymore, getting all the Napoleons' best lines in his hour. Malone is solidly supported elsewhere by Neva Patterson (incidentally channeling Nina Foch) playing mum Blanche Oelrichs, Murray Hamilton (incidentally channeling Tommy Noonan and Larry Blyden) as a disguised version of Walter Wanger, spurned beau Martin Milner, and Efrem Zimbalist, Ray Danton and Ed Kemmer neatly characterize Diana's three non-trophy spouses. The producer Henry Blanke, guiding force of this project, had previously cast Malone opposite a real Barrymore, Dame Ethel, in YOUNG AT HEART, and here the Burbank callsheet casting is richer yet, with uncredited cameos by Kathleen Freeman, Joanna Barnes, Maila Nurmi and even nymphet Beverly Aadland.

The dragonlady mother Blanche, an intriguing legendary beauty more charismatic than daughter Diana, deserves a biopic all her own, and Dorothy Malone delivers a five-star performance in this three-star film, marginally enriched by its excellent cast. (Had Blanke been given a larger budget, the film might have looked more like a WB superproduction than an Allied Artists quickie.) Those Warners thespians give TOO MUCH, TOO SOON Hollywood cult value for one furtive view, whereas its far more discreet Diana ancestor BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL is worth owning and repeated DVD replays.",1502755200,2,2948,5.563474387527839

I have alWays thought of Errol Flynn as a star more than an actor because he played so many ""action"" films. But here he is great as John Barrymore. The mother is played as cold and distans while John Barrymore is portraided as jolly and inresponsible. Also I think to much is focused on the men in her life, her husbandet and her father.

Martin Milner is great in the end, appearing as a friend who lost his hair, who tries to encourage her.  The Barrymore's are still interesting.",1438992000,,277,4.851063829787234
8401579,3,B003ODIV1K,"Too Much Too Soon is the 1958 biopic about Diana Barrymore (1921-60), the daughter of stage and screen great John Barrymore. Diana made 10 films between 1941 and 1951 then transitioned to TV where she had a very brief career. She was married 3 times and had problems with alcohol and pills, and wrote the best-selling book from which this film was adapted in 1957.

Sultry Dorothy Malone (1925) plays Diana. Malone is best known for her role on Peyton Place (1964-8), but she was also an Oscar winner for Written on the Wind (1956), which is what earned her the starring role in this film. She was featured in the TV series Rich Man, Poor Man (1976) and most recently in Basic Instinct (1992).

Errol Flynn (1909-59) plays John Barrymore. For more than a dozen years Errol Flynn was one of Hollywoods brightest stars, both on and off the screen. But by 1950 his best days were behind him, and his role here as John Barrymore is more than an ironic picture of his own career.  Flynn and Barrymore were great friends and there is a legend that Flynn stole Barrymore dead body.

Neva Patterson (1920-2010) plays Dianas mother. Patterson was a busy actress in the 50s and 60s transitioning to TV and busy through the 80s.

The acting by Flynn and Malone is excellent. The New York Times said the film was undaring and even unsurprising Mr Flynn steals the picture lock, stock and keg. It is only in the scenes of his savage disintegration, as the horrified girl looks on, that the picture approaches real tragedy. But the LA Times was not so positive  For all his capturing of John's surface mannerisms, some of the physical appearance and, most effortlessly, his way with a bottle, Flynn is not the great profile and great actor of our time

The top grossing films in 1958 were South Pacific, Auntie Mame, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, No Time for Sergeants, and Gigi. The big Oscar winner was Gigi (Picture, Director). David Niven won for Best Actor (Separate Tables) and Susan Hayward won for Best Actress (I Want to Live). Other notable releases were Vertigo, The Blob, The Fly, and King Creole.

This film will appeal to fans of Flynn mostly, for his excellent acting, although truth be told, he is playing more the aging Flynn than the aging Barrymore. Barrymore was a much better classical actor, and Flynn was a marvelous swashbuckler. So the fit isn't exactly 100%. But both were at one point at the very top of their profession, only to see their personal foibles quicken their respective declines.",1436659200,2,2497,4.633484162895928

Too much, Too Soon accurately captures why my wife's mother wanted nothing to do with the Hollywood lifestyle.  Dorothy Malone delivers the goods and does it with relish.  Her dramatic portrayal of a Barrymore who allows herself to be swept away by adoring fans and a swift river of booze, is tantilizing.",1392076800,2,520,4.8977272727272725
8401583,5,B003ODIV1K,"""Too Much Too Soon"" tells the story of two members of the Barrymore family. Although billed as the story of Diana Barrymore (played by Dorothy Malone), it is as much a story of her father, played by the late Errol Flynn, who gives an outstanding performance as John Barrymore, Diana's father. A loving man when sober, he is often drunk. And when drunk he ignores his daughter, who feels unloved.

As the daughter of a famous actor, it is expected that Diana too will become a star and she begins receiving movie roles while still in her teens. However, her limited acting skills and her finding solace in the bottle keeps her career from taking off. By the time she is in her late twenties she is already a has-been. A series of failed marriages and relationships ensue. She squanders her money and winds up indigent.

The movie ends on an upbeat note, with the expectation that Diana is about to get help for her alcoholism. This is not what happened in real life. The movie was released in 1958. Two years later Diana was dead at age 30. As for Errol Flynn, whose performance clearly overshadows that of Malone,in real life he was an alcoholic and was dead one year after the release of this film at age fifty.",1383177600,,1212,4.504545454545455
