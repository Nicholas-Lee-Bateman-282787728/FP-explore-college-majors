8375267,4,B002NPCJTK,"I was pretty surprised to find that on some levels this sword and sandal flick was somewhat historically accurate. Some of the plot didn't make sense, but the story was actually pretty good. The armies looked impressive as did the costumes. I never really bought into that a Roman Centurian could be a bleeding heart liberal who believed that nothing could be solved by violence. That lasted until he had to fight for his love, a Princess of Corinth. As I said the scenery was pretty good, but the final scene of the burning city was pretty lame. All in all though, as sword and sandal movies go, this was a cut above the average. I was kind of disapointed in the fate of Gianna Maria Canale as I thought better things were in store for her earlier in the film. The fate of the baddest bad guy was telegraphed early and poetic if not obvious. As for the princess. I was beginning to wonder if our hero really should rescue that screaming, sniveling, whiner. For goodness sake lady, put a sock in it. Anyway, four stars. Not a great movie, but if you like this genre, kind of fun.

8375268,4,B002NPCJTK,The movie is ok. The plot is not bad at all. Seems in line with the typical sword and Sandles movies of that era. Enjoyed Gordon Mitchells' appearance in the movie. The transfer is cleaner than a lot of movies from that era.,1492732800,,224,4.232558139534884

8375270,3,B002NPCJTK,"SWORD & SANDAL EPICS ARE A GUILTY PLEASURE OF MINE.  THAT SAID THIS IS A STEP UP FROM THE STEVE REEVES COLLECTION.  THE CHEESY SETS AND COSTUMES KEEP IT FROM BEING SOMETHING TO HIGHLY RECOMMEND, BUT THE ACTING IS BETTER (DESPITE SOME TYPICAL OVER THE TOP MUGGING).  I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THE ORIGINAL ITALIAN DIALOGUE WITH SUBTITLES.  THE DUBBING IS DUBIOUS... THE PRICE IS HARD TO ARGUE WITH , SO IF THIS IS YOUR BAG TRY IT OUT..",1388188800,2,431,4.487179487179487
8375271,4,B002NPCJTK,"Sinister cinema have put out a beautiful print of The Conqueror of Corinth

Its full 2.35.1 Widescreen, Very clean blemish free print

Superb Color too.

Its not 16.9 Anamorphic,so you have to zoom up the picture, but on my 70inch JVC
it still looks superb.
A High Bit rate was used.

The film itself,quite good,if you are into these old sword and sandal films,full of political intrigue
Highly Recommended.",1289779200,10,407,4.855072463768116
