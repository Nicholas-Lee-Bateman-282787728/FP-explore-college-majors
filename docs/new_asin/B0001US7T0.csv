2031701,5,B0001US7T0,"Though this movie is slightly cheesy, and obviously neither Brad nor Ricky's best work, it is very entertaining nonetheless.  Brad Pitt as a track star...need I say any more?  And Ricky Schroeder as a troubled youth  looking to make a fresh start...brilliant.  The best part of the movie is  the drunk scene (if you watch it you'll know what I mean), which can be  reenacted over and over with your friends for hours and hours of guaranteed  hilarity.  A must see, and one of my favorites!",948758400,21,489,4.604651162790698
2031702,5,B0001US7T0,its a very good movie but like i said why don't u make the movie cheaper than more people will buy it cause who would pay 90 bucks for a movie when u can probly get it in the video store for 10 bucks,948153600,2,199,3.5454545454545454

2031727,2,B0001US7T0,"not a great movie, but fun to look at Brad so young, yet not so young playing a 17 year old and he is actually closer to 27",1392076800,,123,3.4285714285714284
2031728,5,B0001US7T0,very good movie. good story line and good cast. Rick Schroder is excellence in it.i recomend it. buy it now,1377129600,,107,4.4
2031729,3,B0001US7T0,The movie itself was okay-nothing complicated or hard to follow.  It is funny seeing Schroder and Pitt at such a young age.  Their acting was okay considering the script left something to be desired.  The music was horrendous but typical of the times (lol) and the volume was really low. It will stay in my collection of Pitt movies.,1372723200,,333,4.610169491525424
2031730,5,B0001US7T0,Great movie reminds me of when I ran track in high school  the movie works great cant ask more great,1372636800,,100,4.0
2031731,1,B0001US7T0,"This is one of the WORST transfers of a film to DVD I have ever seen. And I have a massive collection of DVDs, so I know from whence I write.

My DVR recording of the same title from cable TV looks better than the DVD, so it looks like I will be transferring that version to DVD and saving it in my expensive new DVD case . . . with artwork, of course.

Hey, I suppose I should be grateful that, at least, it's widescreen.",1369094400,,422,3.895348837209302
2031732,5,B0001US7T0,"The production value is low, but this is a surprisingly good story, and you get to see some of Pitt's early chops as well.  The track scenes were better than expected, and the sibling rivalry really fueled the movie.  Worth 90 minutes of your time",1365292800,,247,4.466666666666667
2031753,5,B0001US7T0,"This movie was a very pleasant surprise, the two leads Ricky Schroder and Brad Pitt, were able to show that family in the end means everything even if you don't know it straight away.",1361750400,,183,4.411764705882353
2031754,5,B0001US7T0,I remember watching this movie when me and my brother was a kid.  I enjoy watching it now as I did back then.,1359072000,,109,3.739130434782609
2031755,3,B0001US7T0,"This movie is a story about two runners who have gone on separate paths, but now they are reunited again. It's not great, but it's not terrible either. It's worth a look if you're a runner.",1354579200,,189,4.277777777777778
2031756,2,B0001US7T0,I bet Brad Pitt tries to forget this movie. Its not a terrible movie but it has a very low budget feel. I was high school track and cross country runner so I figured I would at least check it out.,1326758400,,196,3.8048780487804876
2031757,4,B0001US7T0,"I remembered watching this movie back in the early 90's!! It's a Great Movie, Brad Pitt has come a long way since ""Across the Tracks"" He delivered a good performance! It's always good to see Rick Schroder appear in a Movie, He too did the movie Justice!.. A classic Drama about brotherhood, it is worth watching again!",1300147200,3,318,4.5964912280701755
2031758,5,B0001US7T0,I loved it . It was a great tribute to siblings.  It reminded me of me and my sister. I am not on drugs but I am the black sheep cause I am dating someone who used to be .  I felt the love in this movie .,1242000000,,204,3.2291666666666665
2031759,3,B0001US7T0,"Sandy Tung's ""Across the Tracks"" is exactly what I expected: a standard-issue teen angst movie, neither great nor terrible, and worth seeing strictly for its two stars. The story concerns two brothers from a poor background, both high-school track runners. Joe (Brad Pitt) is an overachieving straight arrow starting to crack from the strain, and Billy (Rick Schroder) is a juvenile delinquent trying desperately to go straight. There is no situation in the movie that you don't see coming from about 200 miles away, and writer-director Tung has a bad habit of changing the characters' basic personality traits to fit the action. (Also, the sound track, consisting mostly of second-rate heavy metal, is beyond annoying.) But the movie rests squarely on the shoulders of Pitt and Schroder, and fortunately they can bear the weight. They're both extremely easy to look at, they're convincingly athletic in their running scenes, they're believable as brothers and they both give nice, clean acting jobs, as good as the material allows. ""Across the Tracks"" isn't exactly a must-see, but it's a painless and interesting look at Pitt just before ""Thelma and Louise"" made him a household name, and also at Schroder right after ""Lonesome Dove.""",1207526400,4,1236,5.185
2031760,5,B0001US7T0,"The film starts off feeling like a bad Lifetime movie.  It has a sort of after school special feel to it.  It's low budget, not very skillful in its direction, and Pitt is still developing his craft.  He's not yet at his best.  Despite all this, the further you get into the film the more involving it becomes.  I loved this film.
There is a lot of depth to the relationship between the two brothers and besides Without Limits this is the best track film that I have ever seen.",1200182400,8,477,4.2555555555555555
2031761,4,B0001US7T0,I enjoyed the movie.  It was fun to watch Rick Schroeder and brad Pitt in roles as teenagers and the movie had a good story line.,1186099200,2,129,3.9615384615384617
2031762,1,B0001US7T0,"Poorly produced, poorly written.  Predictable, and disjointed.  Even two popular actors as Brad Pitt and Rick Schroeder don't help this one fly.",1181347200,,144,5.5

8016820,5,B0001US7T0,This is another movie that I have in VHS and wished to get in DVD. I am also a big sports movie fan and even though this movie is not totally a sports type movie there is that element to it. Of course most movies I look at who is in them and of course at that time I probably looked at it more for Ricky Schroder than Brad Pitt.,1441324800,,328,3.7
