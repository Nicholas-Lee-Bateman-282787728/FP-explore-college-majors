8288217,5,B001CMTC9K,I saw this performance many years ago and wanted to see it again.,1434240000,,65,4.076923076923077
8288218,5,B001CMTC9K,"This movie is pure and plain down-to-earth delight, and the best introduction of its kind to (the pre-Iron John) Robert Bly.  His humanity and groundedness come through loud and clear and genuine  whether driving a tractor with his young son, singing Yeats Mad as the Mist and Snow among friends, chopping firewood by a northern lake, or sitting in his study  as his seething mind continues, often taking flight, along its merry, convoluted way. So also does Blys poetic voice ring (with the help his gesticulations), calling to us from the pulpit of the Old Muskego Church in St. Paul, Minnesota, speaking of solitude and community, of the riches of Jungs understanding of the self, of the poets role in society, and of much else. Full of poems and ideas and biographical detail, and narrated by Blys friend, the marvelous poet, Thomas McGrath (subject of another of Mike Hazards films), you will want to re-watch this at regular intervals.",1420416000,,941,4.90566037735849
8288219,5,B001CMTC9K,"This film wonderfully pulls us into the force field of one of poetrys greatest.  Here Mike Hazard and Greg Pratt and CIE Films accurately and artistically capture the explosion of intelligence, imagination, exuberance, profundity and humor, known publicly, as Robert Bly--Poet.  This is an essential documentary which provides a viewing experience that reports Blys strengths and wisdom in a format as delicious as fine poetry.  Narrator and Bly friend, (and another great poet,) Tom McGrath, provides deep appreciation for Blys personality and work.  He is the perfect companion to lead us into Blys world.  This film is a rare joy and even those unimpressed by poetry will be moved.",1417651200,,684,5.238532110091743
8288220,5,B001CMTC9K,"IN A WORLD TOO FILLED WITH FACTS AND TOO EMPTYOF PASSION, THIS FILM IS WATER IN THE DESERT, FRESH AIR IN A LOCKED ROOM. ROBERT BLY IS NOT SIMPLY ONE OF THE GREATAMERICAN POETS; HE IS ONE OF THE GREAT AMERICAN SOULS. THIS FILM REFLECTS HIS GREAT PERSONALITY, EMBRACE SIT, CHERISHES IT, CELEBRATES IT. BEYOND HIS GREAT TALENT, WE SEE THE MAN, THE NOBLE, MAGNIFICENT CREATURE WHO BESTRIDES THE WORLD, GIVING US PEACE. ROBERT BLY IS ONE OF THE GREAT GIFTS MANKIND HAS GIVEN TO THE WORLD, AND THIS FILM ASTONISHES US NOT ONLY WITH ITS GRACE AND COMPASISON, BUT ITS ELOQUENCE.",1416182400,,570,4.598039215686274
8288221,1,B001CMTC9K,"Perhaps my expection of the DVD was to high; never the less, I still consider this compositon (of DVD) weak.  A glimpse of Mr. Bly's personal life was interesing.  I was expection far more recital of his poetry, or others,  for sake of  entertainment to holdup weak areas of the DVD but that didn't happen.  Would I purchase it for a friend?  No.  Hope this bit helps.",1395878400,,368,4.402985074626866
