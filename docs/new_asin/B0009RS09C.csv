8065724,5,B0009RS09C,"This disk is worth it simply for the track ""hot number"" alone. The girl in this short track is so hot it doesn't matter that she doesn't take all of her clothes off - it is still very, very sexy.

I got turned on by almost all of the tracks on the disk - which unlike modern erotica has girls with normal bodies (i.e. not super skinny) and leaves something to the imagination.

I was fascinated by  how much pubic hair some of the girls had back then. If nothing else this DVD proves that feminine grooming habits have changed a good deal over time.

A quick note - these tracks are sexy, but not dirty.

If you know what I mean....",1146096000,24,632,4.147540983606557
8065725,5,B0009RS09C,"Finally, something calls itself ""erotica"" that is actually erotic.

I'm so tired of things calling themselves ""erotica"" when they really mean ""porn.""

Real erotica is about sexiness and suggestion - not about seeing people nude and having sex. What I liked about these films - most of them are fairly short - is that they are sexy withotu being dirty.

I guess that because people in this time didn't see porn all around them they were able to get turned on by films that are nicely naughty.

The girls are very pretty even if the costumes are sometimes silly.

This DVD made me happy.",1146009600,24,585,4.586538461538462
