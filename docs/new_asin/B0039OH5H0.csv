8392155,5,B0039OH5H0,"A very engaging movie about an aging couple living on their small parcel of land in Korea with their old ox.  Really a moving story about the ""simple"" life.  I was so intrigued by the fact that they slept on the floor, I actually tried it and almost ended up at the chiropractor's office the next day.  They should put, ""Don't try this at home on the label"".. My older brother was inspired to write a brief history of how our family escaped the same fate of substance farming in Nebraska.  The film was made in Korea and the people are not actors, but the actual old couple and their ox.  Tens of thousands of Koreans went to the farm to see these people, it was a real life changing event for them.  I will watch it again.",1390953600,,723,4.202898550724638
8392156,5,B0039OH5H0,"First off, keep the kleenex box with you, especially for the ending.  This was a wonderful film because it was authentic and touched on so many lessons of life, some of them being hard work, loyalty, and most of all, love.  This movie will touch you and stick with you for awhile after you are done watching it.  Don't miss the interview with the director who gives important insight and background information on the making of this film.  You will really love this film.",1311897600,,471,4.571428571428571
8392157,5,B0039OH5H0,"This is a documentary that makes one think about our own longevity, our aging health problems, and our connection with an animal.  The focus is an 80 year old man and his wife who struggle in their dilapidated farm with a 40 year old ox.  The bond the elderly man, Mr. Choi, has that with the ox, makes his cynical wife believe that the ox is cared for more than she.

It is unimaginable to view this 80 year old man, sickly, with an infected foot, game leg, take care of his farm, day and night.  He gains a new ox who has a calf, who he eventually sells, but no way will he sell his beloved ox for a lower than expected price.  We watch this man trudge in the muddy fields with his wife who finds the time to always complain about the situation.

Listen to the interview with the director.  He tells us that the inspiration comes from his own father.  But to make the documentary, he located an old working couple with an ox.  It is interesting to learn several issues were presented with the making of this film.  The old man was quite deaf and believed that the camera was there to take his pictures, and he would stop and pose.  The old lady believed she had to look presentable, with her clothes and often putting make-up on.

After the film was shown to the public, the two became viewed by the public like celebrities, wanting to see the place, the ox, etc.  It became a nuisance for the old folks.  This is a moving film, with a human touch, a bond with an animal, and the existence of continuous hard work.  .....Rizzo",1300665600,,1528,4.256944444444445
8392158,4,B0039OH5H0,"Four-Stars for poignancy, lush photography and the empathetic portrayal of an elderly and diaabled couple struggling to survive as farmers in rural South Korea.

Be aware that this is a documentary and that it is subtitled.  Also be aware that this lovely couple essentially mistreated their beloved work ox by forcing him to work beyond his endurance for over 30-years. It is painful to watch this poor animal in his unending labors. If they don't already have one, they really need to have a Humane Society in South Korea.",1287532800,2,524,4.876404494382022
8392159,5,B0039OH5H0,"I saw this completely out of dumb luck at the mom and pop video store in my neighborhood.  The owners are Korean and have been putting in lots of Korean titles as well as your usual USA blockbusters, which is just FANTASTIC.

I had no idea the kind of power this film would have over me.  Though I'm American-raised, suburban-fed, this movie moved me in ways I cannot explain effectively in words.

It is definitely the kind of documentary that doesn't teach you anything new, but reminds you of all the old things you should never forget.  It makes you FEEL more than SEE anything with your mortal eyes.

It is charming and funny in its own way.  You'll chuckle, you'll laugh, but most of all you will FEEL and THINK about this movie long after it's over.",1282867200,6,756,4.434782608695652
8392160,5,B0039OH5H0,This is a documentary DVD that shows the career of a cow in South Korea.  This cow worked forty years as an ox in a small village in South Korea.  This is a warm story about a wonderful forty year relationship between a family and its ox.,1281312000,,238,4.042553191489362
