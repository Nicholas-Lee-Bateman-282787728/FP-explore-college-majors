7827818,3,6302593387,"I bought the VHS version of this film,because I wanted to collect a VHS copy of some of the cartoons Warner Brothers produced during the 1930's and 1940's. Unfortunately it did not have one certain cartoon-The Colonel(Major?) Lied at Dawn,that it originally was supposed to have. So,I was sort of disappointed.",1360540800,,310,5.098039215686274
7827819,5,6302593387,"I have The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volumes 1 & 2 in addition to the Compleat Tex Avery Box Set.

All sets are LaserDiscs.  Unfortunately since the 1990's America has become overly sensitive and we have become so politically correct that we have lost our humor.

I grew up watching these cartoons.  While some were racist, sexist and ethnocentric we didn't look at it that way.  Today people analyze everything with an eye for the negative.

Swing Shift Cinderella and Flop Goes the Weasel were two of my favorite cartoons.

Sad that I have to keep my oversize laserdisc player to enjoy them.  However, I count my blessings that have them to enjoy.",1356652800,2,650,4.640350877192983

1. ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE A Wild Hare (1940, Avery; first for Bugs, and also stars Elmer)
2. Daffy Duck and Egghead (1938, Avery; this stars Daffy Duck and Egghead, but it isn't the first appearance of either. Is IS, though, the first color appearance for Daffy, and the ONLY color appearance for Egghead)

4. A Tale of Two Kitties (1942, Clampett; first for Tweety)

7827821,5,6302593387,"The golden age of Looney Tunes laserdisc sets are a must have for animation fans and researchers. All 5 sets contain the entire pre-1948 turner owned WB shorts (with the exception of the censored 11). While these are not restored, there are still alot of titles worth looking into that have yet to be restored and re-released (such as THE MAJOR LIED TIL DAWN, BROTHER BRAT, and HONEYMOON HOTEL). The artwork and inserts are better than the golden collections that are currently in-print. I do recommend owning the laserdisc sets in addition to the golden collection DVD sets for comparison and until all the material gets re-released.
This volume has a pretty good mixture of cartoons throughtout the early 1930's up to the late 1940's by some of the great directors such as Tashlin, Clampett, Jones, and McKimson. There's a good balance of musical and character driven cartoons. Most of Bugs Bunny's prototype cartoons are profiled.
Highly recommended (Just try to find a laserdisc player!)

Here's what has yet to be restored:
Goopy Geer (1932)
Three's A Crowd (1932)
Honeymoon Hotel (1934)
The Lady In Red (1935)
The Penguin Parade (1938)
