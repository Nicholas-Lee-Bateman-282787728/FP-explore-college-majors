I like the episode that show Mr. Rogers attending calligraphy class, and also the one that shows how a cake is decorated.  The other great thing about these early episodes is that at the end it shows the green scenery with the episode number and the trolley moving away down the tracks with that lovely music to it.  Buy this!",1473120000,,414,4.282051282051282
8426032,5,B004DTS14G,"I loved watching Mister Rogers growing up, and I've always been interested in programs from before 1979. When I saw these were out on DVD, I knew I had to get it. I would recommend this to anyone who watched this growing up or to anyone who wants their children to see it. The DVD came in an envelope and was wrapped up tight, like it was brand new. When I first popped it in, it did freeze a couple of times, but after I put it in again, it worked just fine. It didn't freeze up after that.",1387670400,,491,3.9696969696969697
