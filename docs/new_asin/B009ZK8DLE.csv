[3] Extra Features includes:
- Storyboards
- Character Classes (includes the male and female character introductions to each Act for each class)
- Retrospective (a look at the evolution of Diablo)
- Trailers

My favorite part of the DVD was the ""Sounds of Sanctuary"" featurette because we get to see some of the people behind the voices in the game (for example, Michael Gough as Deckard Cain, an aged character voiced by a middle-aged man). The production quality of the disc as a whole was high, and there is a little bit here for everyone. If you like to see the people behind the magic and how they do it, this is worth your time.
I almost bought the Collector's Edition of the game when it came out just to get this disc, but I'm glad I waited until people started to sell it piecemeal for just a few bucks.",1383350400,,2133,4.662234042553192
