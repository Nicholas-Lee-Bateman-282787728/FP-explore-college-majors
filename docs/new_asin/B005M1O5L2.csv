8478945,3,B005M1O5L2,"I was a huge fan of Kenny vs Spenny. This is pretty much like the Kenny side without the competition. A lot of the episodes kind of meander around without a real purpose. Good for a one time watch through, but no staying power. Also, a couple of the episodes become un-watchable because they are so awkward or gross. If you're a Kenny Hotz fan, I would recommend.",1489968000,,363,4.352941176470588
