5381699,5,B00A4Y616E,Great release for a bargain.  Kind of keeping with the Roger Corman ethos.,1482796800,,74,4.6923076923076925
5381700,1,B00A4Y616E,Real good feeling when your husband goes to open his Xmas gift and the thing looks like it was fished straight out of a dumpster. I can't believe I spent money of what essentially came to our house -AS A GIFT- a piece of garbage. So dissatisfied.,1482710400,3,246,4.25531914893617
5381701,5,B00A4Y616E,Very thankful  as some of  these movies  can't get  here in new Zealand,1481155200,,71,4.230769230769231

5381703,4,B00A4Y616E,"Purchased for Humanoids and Piranha which weighs out the lack luster other entries of this collection which seem to reflect anything Corman has put together since the mid-80s... But Humanoids is better fare and should start being mentioned more often amongst horror circles and the original Piranha shows a bygone era of horror where no one (and I mean no one of age, race, or gender) is safe",1470700800,2,392,4.779411764705882
5381704,5,B00A4Y616E,I like these movies a lot.,1438905600,,26,3.5
5381705,5,B00A4Y616E,Love the collection but then I like bad 80's movies...  Been looking for Piranha for awhile but all the movies are equally good..,1506902400,,129,4.608695652173913

5381712,2,B00A4Y616E,Okay so let me explain the two stars. These movies are hilariously awful. I got the four pack for our bad movie group.  They are perfect for bad movie groups.  And the price is right!,1491264000,,183,4.2
5381713,2,B00A4Y616E,"I love these kind of movies which is why it is so disappointing to me to see a new release like this of such piss poor quality, I was very excited to receive this set but not only is it not remastered with no extra's, the movies are so badly compressed that you'd be better with a VHS copy, but that's going to happen when you jam 6 hours of movies on one disk, very disappointed with Shout Factory who used to treat their releases with some respect, this is just a cash grab, I've seen Mill Creek releases of 50's public domain movies that look better than this, I would search out earlier and less compressed releases if you are a real fan or want to see these films the way they were meant to be seen, if you just want a laugh and don't care about quality, these are fun movies.",1489276800,5,781,4.111111111111111

8546741,4,B00A4Y616E,"These old Roger Corman  movies are excellent B Horror movies. They are the ones they used to play at the drive-ins for all night horror shows. I enjoyed the movies. Yes the monsters are ""campy"" and not really realistic, but what do you expect from old B horror movies? But the story line is good, with pretty good acting. Oh, yes they show a little skin. This was normal back in the day, and one of the draws to get people to go to the movies and watch them.",1529193600,,458,4.146067415730337
8546742,4,B00A4Y616E,"Shout Factory delivers the goods with this solid ""underwater"" creature feature set of Corman goodies. Up from the Depths is kind of dull and the only real turkey film on this set, but Demon of Paradise is a fun bit of crazy schlock, that almost feels like a remake of the 1978 messterpiece ""Bog"", and Dante's classic Piranha is gory, popcorn fare for a late Sunday night. The highlight on the disc however, is the international ""uncut"" version of Humanoids from the Deep! Slurp!",1527206400,,478,4.7023809523809526

8546746,5,B00A4Y616E,"Classic movies. I have to say I like every one of these movies. Not a bad one in the bunch, if you like silly B movies. Very entertaining. And for $9.99!! What! The question is, WHY wouldn't you buy this.",1519430400,,204,4.125
