8239972,5,B001131AIQ,"It is great that this television gem from the early 1960s is still available. James Daly and Kim Hunter are very good in this religious drama. James Daly is believable as the hard, lawless Barabbas, who gains a new life through faith in the man who was crucified in his place. We even see a very youthful Richard Thomas as a poor, dirty-faced beggar boy. This is theater at its best.",1356912000,4,383,4.408450704225352
