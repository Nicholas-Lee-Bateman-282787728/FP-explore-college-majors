8215055,5,B000UUX2F0,"As a production, '.hack' is beautiful. The designers have created a genuinely lovely dungeons and dragons world. And than peopled it with the interesting and attractive characters created by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, spooky monsters, and the usual assortment of lovable geeks. Music by Yuki Kajiura is equal to the setting, making this the beginning of a story that promises to fascinate and delight repeatedly. A winner for sure. Absolutely try to get the Limited Edition Boxed Set, which comes complete with t-shirt, critter, and a sample disk of the game release.",1223337600,2,560,5.233333333333333
