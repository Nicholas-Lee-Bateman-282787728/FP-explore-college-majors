I am just grateful that I only opened one of the two that I ordered, so I could at least get a refund on the other one.

If this were a show on cable, I might watch it on the chance it might spark a random thought. But at $35 a pop, these DVDs aren't anything but someone's attempt at ""Making It"" at your expense.",1215561600,,573,4.296296296296297
