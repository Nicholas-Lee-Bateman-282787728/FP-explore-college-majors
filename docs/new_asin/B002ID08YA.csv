I've been renting them from the local library, but am considering purchasing them now. After all, there are only  so many times we can renew... ;-)",1374451200,,268,4.36
8370847,1,B002ID08YA,"I'm amazed that people haven't wised up to the deceptive marketing practices used in the titles of videos like Baby Einstein and So Smart! There are no data to support these videos making kids 'smarter' or more like Einstein. Unfortunately, many parents read the title and subconsciously (or not so subconsciously) decide that if the video is called this, it must make kids smarter. Think about it - would you be equally inclined to buy this video if it was called ""Ketchup sandwich?"" I would venture a guess that most consumers wouldn't.

Our local PBS station carries a lot of them. These videos are slow-moving and simple - which is fine for small children. They're probably no better than most other cartoons for pure (and questionable) entertainment purposes IF your child likes them (which our kids don't). However, don't buy them thinking you're doing something good for your kids. Reading, drawing, building with blocks - those are mind-building activities for little minds. Watching TV is not and should not be considered good for children no matter how the stuff put on the screen is marketed. Instead, I hope that consumers exercise a little consumer activism and stop buying things that may trick well-meaning parents into thinking they're doing something good for their children.",1305417600,,1292,5.065727699530516

The animation is simple, not flashy or fast-paced. The music is unique and engaging. Overall, the So Smart DVDs are educational and fun at the same time. My son asks for these DVDs again and again.",1287964800,2,369,4.4411764705882355
