8752424,5,B01C6S1N0Y,"I have six shows listed at MyAnimeList with 10/10 ratings; Dennou Coil is one of these. It follows a bunch of ten-year-olds as they navigate their way through a virtual reality world that overlays a small Japanese city. To experience this world, you need to wear special glasses. For the kids it's a remarkable playground where you can carry out battles, or raise strange creatures, or play with virtual pets. However when one of the kids is run over by an automated car, they begin to wonder if there aren't some darker forces at work behind the scenes.

The two principals are both transfer students named Yuko who are quickly nicknamed ""Yasako"" and ""Isako."" Yasako has a lot of experience with the ""dennou"" (""cyber"") world, but nothing like the powers young Isako wields. She is in pursuit of the mysterious ""illegals,"" virtual creatures left behind in abandoned virtual ""spaces,"" that she hopes to use to help revive her comatose brother. Along the way we meet a bunch of boys who form the Hackers Club, a talented girl hacker named Fumie who befriends Yasako, Yasako's grandmother who sells the kids illegal software to carry out their activities, and some other delightfully eccentric characters.

Dennou Coil was the brainchild of director Iso Mitsuo, best known for his ""sakuga"" work in famous shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion. Iso peddled his treatment for the story for some seven years before finally convincing Madhouse and the NHK public television network to produce it. Most anime are adaptations of other works like manga, novels, and more recently videogames, which helps explain why Iso faced so many roadblocks to getting an original story like Coil produced. Luckily for us he persisted, though he has pretty much left the industry since this show was released in 2007.",1490140800,,1791,4.986622073578595
8752425,3,B01C6S1N0Y,"EXTRAS: Not much extras are included in this 2-disc Blu-ray set of ""Den-Noh Coil 1"". You'll only find clean opening and closing in Disc 2, that's all. Boo.

SUBTITLES and SPELLINGS: English subs only. In a couple of spots I thought the translation was iffy. And that some of the extra explanations (cultural references) were unnecessary. Not any better than what fansubs did when the series broadcast originally.  And this is just my pet peeve, but spelling variations like Searchy vs Sachi / Satchi ... or Den-Noh vs Dennou... Whatever looks more natural or less complicated is better. Even the ""Den-Noh"" in the official title rubs me the wrong way. ""Dennou"" is better!

AUDIO: English 5.1 and Japanese 5.1. Japanese 5.1 is just fine. I didn't even try the English language playback, I don't think anime should be watched that way. Just assume that English audio works.

VIDEO: Disappointing. Too many dark-colored scenes (and there are lots of them in Dennou Coil) look very grainy and low-quality. My tv and bluray player are both 4k, maybe it just doesn't work well with the upscaling, but I have to say I have no such issues when watching other anime. And trust me, I'm not talking about when old space starts hazing out or when the virtual body gets hacked (in the storyline). The picture quality seems iffy overall, and they just become more apparent in dark scenes.

So, no, you won't go ""wow"" over this set. It's somewhere between poor and average, considering you're buying a physical, disc set. Maybe mediocre, if you consider the relatively high price. So why buy it? Same reasons that others who liked this series have said -- interesting storyline, great characters, and the fact that we waited so long to see this series re-surface.

Get this and Den-Noh Coil 2 in Bluray before they disappear. The two sets (2 discs in each set) contain the whole series with 26 episodes. The features? Just meh. You'll buy it for the content. That (and that it's available) is the only reason to buy this.",1488153600,2,2005,4.763688760806916
8752426,5,B01C6S1N0Y,"An excellent title finally released from the death grip of Disney.  This US license for this title had been held in the back rooms of Disney for a long while and finally has a release (on BluRay too!) thanks to ""Maiden Japan"".  Fun how in this show they had been warning children not to run into streets chasing cyber things in the glasses, which seems a good prediction of what some people did with Pokemon Go.",1482796800,2,411,4.394736842105263
8752427,5,B01C6S1N0Y,This show is truly something special and worth your time and money.  The world that's crafted here seems like something that is quite plausible  to happen. Before this Blu-ray release I didn't know anything about the show but decided to take a chance after a recommendation from a YouTube content creator Mother's Basement made a video of recommended science fiction shows. Took a chance and I'm glad I did looking forward to part 2 to come out!,1472428800,,445,4.766233766233766
8752428,5,B01C6S1N0Y,"DO YOU LIKE DIGIMON/SUMMER WARS?! DO YOU LIKE ANIME THATS BOTH CHILDISH AND SERIOUS?!
Then this anime is perfect for you. It has a wonderful tone not unlike a kid-adventure anime, or something like ""Summer Wars"" where the actions and story get more intense as the anime continues. I was pleased by the dark tone as it settled in and didn't feel abrupt or sudden but rather the drama of the characters develops smoothly and greats progressively more interesting. I love the digital-meets-real world visuals and concepts. The anime becomes much darker by the second half but really satisfying overall. I recommend it to anyone whom likes the titles mentioned above or wants a fun but cool anime to dig into.",1471651200,,705,4.8347107438016526

8752430,4,B01C6S1N0Y,"11 year old Yuki Okonogi has just moved to Daikoku City and has already been swept up in the antics of the local children. She is inducted into her grandmothers investigation agency - a group of kids with a bunch of virtual tools and plenty of enthusiasm. It isn't too long before they are all tangled up in the mystery of a new computer virus that has infected the virtual world.

I really enjoyed this series. The virtual world was really interesting and well presented. The characters, mostly 11 year olds, feel like real kids and are quite likable.
The art style is fairly different than most anime I watch. I wasn't sure if I liked it at first, but it grew on me.

I am glad to see this series finally being released here. I had pretty much given up hope until I heard the announcement. I look forward to finally owning it!",1466380800,,828,4.37012987012987
8752431,5,B01C6S1N0Y,"My copy shipped early from rightstuf. I am so happy this series was finally licensed for release in the US. I first saw it in '07; I watched the first 19 episodes in a row one day, went to sleep and finished the rest when I woke up. There are a few stand alone episodes early on, but the plot does pick up. It may seem like a show for kids, but it becomes so much more. Certainly one of the most underrated anime I've seen. The blu ray picture and sound are very good from what I've seen so far; the only negative is the lack of bonus features. The first 9 episodes are on disc 1, while 10-13 are on disc 2.",1464998400,6,607,3.903225806451613
