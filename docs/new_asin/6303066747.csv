7837022,5,6303066747,I added this to my four other Carson DVD's and this one was the absolute best.  I smiled while watching the others and laughed while watching this one.  It was flawless and a totally good purchase.,1487808000,,197,4.444444444444445
7837023,4,6303066747,"I recently bought this video, and I think it's the best in the entire series. It's fun seeing ""The Tonight Show"" opening in black and white, when it was still being filmed in New York. That was a first for me. That particular clip, which includes a portion of Johnny's monologue, is from 1966 or '67. All of the black and white clips are my favorite. They have an added pizazz and excitement. Maybe it's because Johnny is so young, and full of energy. It's fun watching him dance and sing with Pearl Bailey, and laugh with Buddy Hackett, Ed Ames, Flip Wilson, and Jack Webb. A clip from the Tiny Tim/Miss Vicki wedding from 1969 is here, as well as a clip from the famous ""lost"" episode from 1969, with Bob Hope, George Gobel, and Dean Martin.

The tape is almost 60 minutes long, and just filled with laughs! I wish they would release more of the '60s clips. They are the best. The ones from the '70s are good, too. Among those are Johnny and Ed's Alpo commercial, some Carnac clips, and Dolly Parton's first ""Tonight Show"" appearance in 1977. Very funny... I highly recommend this tape. It's great entertainment, and delightful to watch. It will give you quite a few good, hearty laughs!",1116201600,4,1189,4.50462962962963
7837024,5,6303066747,"I grew up with Johnny Carson, even before the Tonight Show.  I thought he was funnier than anyone I'd ever seen as a kid.  The expressions on his face!  This is classic.  Good for the soul, good for the mood.  Good prescription for anyone who appreciates Carson and those old innocent funnies.  I rented this and laughed for the whole hour...had to rewind to make sure I didn't miss the next joke!",1003968000,11,397,4.444444444444445
