8325770,3,B000UEATDE,"I've been studying Italian for over 10 years now, in fits and starts.  At this point, I can confidently make a hotel reservation, order in a restaurant, chat about the weather, and ask for directions (the usual for any beginning foregin language student).  In the hopes of someday starting a business in Italy, I have shifted my focus to business Italian.  That is how I came to search for a program like this one from EuroTalk.
My hope was that I could get in some exercise while I learned business Italian, so I intentionally looked for a CD to be used with a television versus a DVD intended to be used on a computer.  I figured that a bit of interactivity would be fine, even while on the treadmill.  However, this CD is set up to require an action after every phrase - whether you are in quiz mode or not.  In addition, the navigation in this CD is difficult to manage.  It's hard to move around within any ""chapter"" of the CD, from learning phrases to taking quizzes - there does not appear to be a way to move from one section of a chapter to another without going all the way back to the main menu.
The phrases are indeed useful, and I will continue to use this CD.  However, I will not be able to use it while doing anything else, since a click of the remote is required to proceed from each individual phrase.
I think, with a little reworking of the navigation, and perhaps the ability to let phrases play without needing a prompt from the remote after each one, this CD could be even more useful.
Good first try, EuroTalk.  I'll keep my eye out for more products.",1269993600,,1574,4.326530612244898
