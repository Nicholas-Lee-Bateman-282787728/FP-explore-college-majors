2290282,1,B0009GX1UQ,"When the title came up on the screen, it actually had an exclamation point after it... CENTIPEDE! Like a musical. Come to think of it, this movie might have been better if it had a couple of snappy musical numbers in it. It makes you wonder if they were going for that self-referencing Sci-Fi PG-13 funny/scary movie thing that Blue Devil, Monster Island and Bite Me! have captured so effectively. A bunch of spelunkers go to India to explore a creepy cave before one of them goes off to get married. Like a bachelor party in a cave or something like that. They are attacked by giant latex centipede puppets. The end.

Not much to recommend here, boils and ghouls, except for one truly bizarre moment. So, this Indian guide leads our heroes down into the cave, and they all decide to have a party while their in the bowels of the earth. We find out through some really unsubtle exposition that the soon-to-be-married guy used to have a thing with one of the other girls on the trip. There's supposed sexual tension between them as they try to ignore each other. I guess this girl was supposed to be sultry and sexy and mysterious. I thought she was kinda Plain Jane, but maybe the director was dating her or something. We'll call her CC (Casting Couch) for short, because I can't remember her character's name.

While they're all partying down in the caves, someone turns on a radio and some of them start dancing. Really awkward, watching all these actors trying to pretend like they are having fun. It's a cringe-fest. But then they all start looking at CC and chanting, ""Do the dance. Do the dance."" She coyly shakes her head. I was watching it thinking that this must be why they cast her, maybe she can do some freakish thing like wrap her legs around her head and dance like that. So this big build-up around the DANCE, and when she finally gets up and does it... it's like this White Girl Cabbage Patch thing that, quite literally, gave me a stabbing pain in my stomach. It was a NAPOLEON DYNAMITE moment. I watched her do the DANCE like five times in a row. It was crazy. I wanted to vomit. That's why I say maybe they should have kept the exclamation point at the end of the title and made this movie into some weird kind of horror/musical.",1135296000,8,2249,4.456310679611651

  This flicker just rubbered me the wrong way.

  It lacked centipedal force.

  The monster's not even CGI: Centiputer Generated Image - what there isn't of it.

  100 to 1 it didn't have 100 legs either, not that they moved.

  Maybe it should be called Pentapede. Well, ok, Octopede.

  Or, Onetapede, as it's in that percentage of the movie.

  I missed most of this film.

  Because I kept FF it. Yes, I said...

  I nearly pede my pants. Maybe because the film was that weak. Or -entipedes don't usually swim underwater.

  Have I learnt my lesson yet?

  This is the reason for being on Earth - it takes many many times.

2290284,1,B0009GX1UQ,"Centipede! (Gregory Gieras, 2004)

Gieras, responsible for the marginally amusing Dark Asylum a few years ago, returns to what he knows, the monster movie. Unfortunately, ""what he knows"" and ""what he does best"" are somewhat different.

Plot-- a bunch of young-and-beautifuls go caving in India, where they come upon the titular creature, which wants to kill them off one by one. As with most features of this variety, you know who's going to survive within ten minutes of the beginning of the movie, and there's little to do but stare at the young-and-beautifuls and all the icky stuff. The problem with this movie (okay, one of the problems) is that, well, there's not much icky stuff.

For that matter, there's not much else. The script is horribly botched, as is the characterization. The most intriguing character unfortunately suffers a double-whammy-- Owen (Matthew Pohlson, the only actor here with an actual career), the guy who's neurotically afraid of bugs. Or so we learn at the beginning of the movie, but then said fear just vanishes once they're down in the cave with the really big bug. Pohlson deserves some credit for at least doing his character justice; he's the only one who's in any way memorable for his actual acting skills.

The first half of the movie would have gotten one star for at least being cheesy enough to be watchable, but the second half of the movie bombs in so many ways I'm not sure I can describe them all here. The major offense is the tacking on at the end of an ""oh, let's all be environmentalists"" theme that can only be stomached because it's treated as stupidly as everything else in the movie, and thus can't raise bile as much as it can cynical amusement. The Indian authorities we see are treated in the sort of Kiplingesque ""oh, aren't the locals amusing!"" way that makes me surprised anyone with an Indian background actually agreed to take such a role. (It should be noted that this provincialism seems to exist behind the camera, as well; not a single cast member of Indian descent is credited.)

This is horrible on so many levels I'm surprised the Sci-Fi Channel actually show it-- and I'm fully aware that if it's a horrible film, the Sci-Fi Channel is all over it. This one tacks ""and offensive"" onto ""horrible."" (zero)",1127952000,3,2276,4.737373737373737
2290285,3,B0009GX1UQ,"CENTIPEDE is one of those movies that's so bad it ends up being a cheesy horror fanatic's delight.  Reminiscent of the big bug movies of the fifties, at least thematically, the story involves some spelunkers on a bachelor party (?) expedition in a remote cave in India.  The monster(s) are pretty lame as far as special effects go but that only adds to the movie's unabashed and foolish charm.  No cliche stone is left unturned and the movie careens into sheer absurdity by its ending, but it fills the recipe for those tacky/cheesey bug movies.  Not a classic but you could do worse (e.g., Tail Sting).",1127779200,,603,4.660377358490566
2290286,3,B0009GX1UQ,"A group of friends (or are they) go caving in India as a send-off just before one is to get married.  They descend a dangerous cave with the help of a local guide.  Once at the bottom they seem to think the best safety measure is to get stoned.  Well, one wanders off to answer a call of nature, gets attacked by the title beastie and sets of a cave in that traps the others.

Now the group must find a way out of the cave system while it dawns on them that they are not alone in the dark.  Soon it becomes a run for their lives as the giant centipede decides they are the best thing on the menu.

This is not quite a typical stuck with a monster film.  There is a little more depth although it can be lost amongst the mediocre acting and bad special effects.  The movie opens with some students getting attacked in the cave.  Their professor leads a rescue effort when they discover the party in the cave.  Nice switching between the effort to escape from within and the effort to rescue from without.  A bigger budget could have made for an excellent movie, but it is still fun as is.",1127174400,5,1086,4.148325358851674
2290287,4,B0009GX1UQ,"This is about a group of college kids who go to India to explore a cave.  Of course, once in the depths of the cave, they're attacked by giant centipedes.

This movie fulfills most of the expectations a person might have of a low budget monster movie:  You've got a sexy girl running around in a tight T-shirt, you've got cheesy looking giant centipedes picking off the characters one by one, and let's not forget the incredibly cheesy scene where our lead female does a hilarious little ""dance"".  And I thought Ellaine Bennis from Seinfeld was bad.  Overall, the acting is okay and the characters are a fairly likeable bunch.  The atmosphere is good - the underground caves are fairly creepy.  There's good interaction between the characters and the action moves along fairly well, leading to a typically over the top ending.

I would definitely recommend this to fans of low budget, cheesy horror.",1121904000,9,899,4.792207792207792

8060532,3,B0009GX1UQ,"All things considered, this is a pretty good creature feature. It's obviously low budget, but the practical effects alone put it a cut above most CGI-laden SyFy originals. Unfortunately, the picture quality of the DVD is quite poor. Colors are strong and blacks are good, but the whole image looks very soft and downright blurry at times. While most transfers shine during daylight scenes, this one falters the most during them. I actually cringed a few times during daylight scenes because the image looked so bad. Close-ups are OK, but it's whenever there's more than one person on the screen that things seem a bit muddy, which is often. This DVD does not do this movie justice. However, I doubt we'll ever see another DVD release with a new transfer, let alone a blu-ray. It's a real shame. Also, the viewer is forced to watch some truly terrible trailers that cannot be skipped before getting to the men.",1345420800,2,909,4.7594936708860756
8060533,4,B0009GX1UQ,"I liked this campy sci fi creature feature about a group of explorers trapped in the depths of a cave in India.  It was fun and unpredictable with a satisfying ending.

8060534,3,B0009GX1UQ,"I'm one of those people who like Grade B horror and sci-fi movies (even Grade Z sometimes) with non-CGI monsters. I think Centipede is actually a pretty good little movie that mixes the old style monster genre with the young-good-looking-twentysomethings in peril plot. I also liked the fact that Centipede was actually shot and is set in a non-typical locale -- the country of India. To me, it was a lot more fun to watch than the recent spate of cartoony CGI monster movies or indie sadist killer horror movies. If you enjoy the old style monster movies from the 50s and 60s like me, you might enjoy watching Centipede. I did.",1161993600,6,628,4.616071428571429

Caves are great for monster movies...too bad you have a bunch of

silly humans bringing down the movie...but its not that bad, most

acting is pretty fair to good, and the monster is not too bad either. A bigger budget would have improve the situation..but its

certainly worth a viewing....",1135814400,4,424,4.526315789473684
