8737960,5,B0172AIQHE,"Love this Korean detective movie series, based on the books by the same titles. This one is the second in the series, and is as good and as entertaining as the first. Also a light introduction to the late Joseon kingdom period, when Korea struggles to keep its traditions in face of the arrival of Christianity, guns, and other Western ideas.
The acting is great. The slightly hammy moments are clearly intentional, with a wink and a nudge to the camera and the audience. The mysteries are clever, and the stories are a great balance between funny and suspenseful.",1522886400,,564,4.707070707070707
