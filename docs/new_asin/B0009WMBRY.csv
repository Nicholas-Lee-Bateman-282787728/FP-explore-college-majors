8068443,5,B0009WMBRY,This is a very funny cartoon for kids! My 6 and 8 years old sons have so much laugh with watching it. No additional translation is needed - no dialog there except sound effects. Polish titles have English translations.,1332806400,,218,4.615384615384615
8068444,1,B0009WMBRY,"It looks like a cool movie but I'm an idiot, didn't notice it had no subtitles, it's kind of pointless trying to watch it.  I'm adventurous and multi cultural and all that but I'm not about to sit through a movie entirely in Polish without a clue what anyone is saying.

I hope they can re-release this with some subtitles, it seems slightly pointless to do a region 1 DVD only for the Polish expatriot community.",1180483200,,413,4.421052631578948
8068445,4,B0009WMBRY,"Very well done story which is quite entertaining.  Unfortunately, no English subtitles are available.",1180224000,,101,6.214285714285714
