7945598,1,B00005MKLQ,This movie revolves around the notoriuous White Lotus Cult as implied by the title. Unless you're a fan of traditional Chinese storylines give this one a miss as the martial arts choreography leaves something to be desired.,1355702400,,223,5.054054054054054
7945599,4,B00005MKLQ,"White Lotus Cult is the first of three films to feature the character of 'Iron Bridge' Sam, a folk-hero figure similar to the character played by Jet Li in the Fong Sai Yuk series. Here Sam gets trained in martial arts, finds time for a little romance and does battle with the 'Cult' of the title.
All the lead actors give strong, well-rounded performances making you care about their charcters. The story has depth without being overly complex and the action is a nice mix of wire-work and traditional kung-fu stylings. Overall, a film that wouldn't be out of place next to the OUATIC series on your shelf.",1021420800,8,607,4.62962962962963
