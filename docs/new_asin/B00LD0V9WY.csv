6479694,1,B00LD0V9WY,This was one of the worce movies I have seen in a long time. The only reason it has a title like it does is to pull people into the theater. It had no meat to the movie at all. I watch half of it and turned it off.,1414886400,,214,3.3877551020408165
6479695,4,B00LD0V9WY,"Some might call this film slow but I found it to be somewhat riviting in that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen due to the amazing portrayal of Lester Ballard by Scott Haze!  Ballard a man with an obvious mental handicap who goes deeper and deeper into the abyss of madness and depravity.

There were a couple of scenes that I said to myself ""did I really just see that"",yes I did! Ninety percent of the film is basically a graphic character study of Ballard. He
does some very sick things that include necrophilia and then murder to supply his new found fetish.

Already being treated as a leper and after having his home sold from under him he is forced to live like an animal and find lodging where he can,be it an abandoned shack,a cave or the woods in the hills of Tennessee.

This borders on indie horror because of the subject matter plus it is deeply disturbing.",1414540800,14,875,4.382716049382716
6479696,1,B00LD0V9WY,Way too much foul language in the first five minutes! I turned it off.,1414540800,2,70,4.071428571428571
6479697,3,B00LD0V9WY,"Scott Haze convincingly plays the title role as Lester Ballard, a mentally deficient adult who lives off the land in rural Tennessee. He is the type of man who yells at passing cars. The film is set in the 1950s (?) in late autumn. The only home Lester has known was recently auctioned off. Through a series of circumstances Lester discovers necrophilia, which has never been one of my favorite film topics, except for maybe as a dark comedy which this wasn't.

I will say the acting was excellent. The story was done well, bravo James Franco, but unfortunately didn't go anywhere. This is an excellent crime/ drama/ thriller, I didn't enjoy.

6479698,1,B00LD0V9WY,"Really did not like this movie. It moved way too slow and showed some irrelevant activity by the protagonist (spoiler alert - it's the first, and I hope last, time I see someone actually defecate on screen).  It's a creepy story based on real events, but not worth watching this movie.",1493337600,,285,4.588235294117647

Not sure why this fil  was so scathed when it released, its the book on film. Scott Haze makes Lester Ballard off the page and onto the screen, this is a BRAVE worthy performance.

6479705,3,B00LD0V9WY,"While the movie does follow the book, it is choppy.  Scenes do not blend into each other; rather there is narrator that takes you from scene to scene and from this time to that.  The book is much smoother and lets a person use his own mind, which could have been done well in the movie.  It is NOT rocket science when a movie goes from green grass to a man needing a coat to a snowstorm.  I think the book was much better and, in a lot of places, beautiful as far as descriptions of the snow falls go.",1476057600,,501,3.98

6479710,4,B00LD0V9WY,"It's surprisingly a very good film: well written, shot and edited, and with very memorable performance by Scott Haze as 'Lester Ballard.' But be warned: Cormac McCarthy's 'Lester Ballard' is no 'Karl Childers' by Billy Bob Thornton nor is he close to John Steinbeck's 'Lenny.""  Even though you want to, you cannot warm-up to 'Lester' as you could to 'Karl' or 'Lenny.'  To me, the film's thumbnail is  ""WINTER'S BONE meets ED GEIN.""  There's also a touch of the Portuguese story about ""Queen Ines and the mad King Pedro the First"" to deal with. The film is balanced by a dependable and solid performance by Tim Blake Nelson as 'Sheriff Fate' (no kidding, Cormac McCarthy called him ""fate"") who gives us a recognizable face to carry the burden of ""Justice"" for us. There's also decent narration (I presume from the novel) which knits it all together for us. I also very much enjoyed Christina Voros cinematography (and I also read in the credits that she operated the primary camera) for her cinma vrit approach to the story. Praise to James Franco for having the tenacity, guts and vision to bring this difficult story to the screen with such stark clarity and blunt realism. For me, it's a definite ""go back and screen again"" film.",1471132800,,1232,4.742990654205608

James Franco seems to be losing it. ""The Interview"" was a good comedy but ""Wild Horses"" was a disgrace and this is absolutely disgusting and vomitable. So bad. Do not watch it. There is such a thing as too sadistic and the MPAA should have immediately censored it, or stamped it with an NC-17. This movie should be banned.",1460505600,,475,4.6

6479716,2,B00LD0V9WY,"Having read the book, and being a reader of Cormac Mccarthy, I was interested in the movie.  I have no  quarrel with the 'disturbing' (to some) elrments in the film, my issues are with the shoddy lack of attention to vital details that make a movie really work, as in keep you immersed in the story, emotionslly invested.  Of course the movie distorted the book, especially the protagonist, Lester Ballard, but never mind, had to expect  that.  What really disturbed me, and it's the same in many new 'indie' or anti-hollywood films or 'outsider' films, is the way that really stupid mistakes are never noticed, Truth and Power of a film is in the details  1.  When these films are set back in time, and use old vintage cars, they are ALWAYS Pristine, shining, and perfect.  Extremely jarring, especially in a film like this one.  2. Worst of all I was instantly jolted out of any suspension of disbelief by Lester Ballard/Scott Haze's Perfect, gorgeous, sparkling white teeth!  So white they literally glowed in the dark, as he lurked and grinned in his 'cave of abominations'.  Whst a ridiculous mistske!  How could the director or editor not notice?  How could the actor not have realized?. My guess?  They all have just the same kind of great teeth.  Never occurred to them.  Well, I don't.  I have bad, old, ugly poor folks with bad insurance teeth.  The first thing I notice on anyone is their teeth.
All I saw of Ballard was his butt, when he s*** in the woods..(yawn) and his TEETH.  I think he may be a good actor, but he needs to pay attention to his characters more.  Oh, another thing...his hair never grew during the whole time..another usual mistake.  One more, and this is so widespread it's getting really hard to watch anything.  Another issue with movies set back in the day...No one smokes anymore, I guess..and they just can't carry it off, they really can't.  Tim Blake Nelson looked great, he really has the right 'look' for these films ..till he held that cigarette in his mouth.  Luducrous.
It's a real mood breaker.  Watch some good old noir films..preferably Robt. Mitchum..practice; probably won't work,(I think you have to love smoking) but it's worth a try.  It's SO  noticable.",1457654400,,2207,4.709424083769633
6479717,4,B00LD0V9WY,"Nine Things About the Film ""Child of God""

1. James Franco is one of the most secretly prolific filmmakers around. He has appeared in over 100 films and TV shows, and has directed over 20 movies. He's one of the few people that I consider to be a true artist. This film continues his fascination with the early 20th century American South.

2. It's based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, the guy that gave us No Country for Old Men and The Road. So you know it's not going to be cheerful.

3. It's about a guy named Lester Ballard. The movie begins with him losing his property in an auction, which cuts his last fragile ties with society. The rest of the movie depicts his increasing isolation from everyone around him.

4. When Lester makes some stuffed animal friends, and finds a girlfriend (well, not exactly a girlfriend, but kind of), you know he's on a downward spiral.

5. Scott Haze plays Lester. He's not well known, but his performance here is crazy fierce. And it takes a special quality to let yourself be filmed pooping in the woods.

6. The cinematography isn't as creative as some of Franco's other films, and it's a little rough around the edges. But the storytelling makes up for that.

7. Franco is not afraid of confronting taboos, and he depicts one particular taboo in this movie that will not sit well with some people.

8. The movie has gotten bad reviews, but I disagree. Yeah, it's a little clunky, but I think the critics are being too harsh, and are hoping for things that movie wasn't trying to do.

9. This is a grotesque, sad tragedy of social and sexual deviance in an environment where such things can go uncaught for a long time. It's not a feel-good film, but it is a valuable contribution to exposting the lie of the American Dream.",1455062400,,1764,4.4875

6479722,4,B00LD0V9WY,"For the most part, a faithful adaption of the in your face book.  For all the many people who like to ask why god allows evil, not many like to see it depicted.  It is not so much reasons as causes, and it does seem that cause is within us all in our relating.  McCarthy on an interview speculated that the subconscious might be more like a committee; perhaps legion. I guess most people will deal with their discomfort by declaring it bull.  I don't take it that way.  If you think art does well to be disturbing, pounce.",1451520000,,522,4.232323232323233

Along the way he commits many crimes and does some disgusting things, necrophilia among them. You can barely understand him and there are some interesting things but rather dull and lackluster.

With a title that says ""Child of God"" I would expect it to be part way religious but I was wrong. He looses his land and becomes a dweller at first into a abandoned house and then into a cave. What's really disturbing is what happens to the couple that dies because of him, and what he does afterwords. I'm pretty sure necrophilla isn't in the bible as being okay...to show him screwing a dead woman in the car and then at a cabin is something I didn't care to see but does show how far down he has become.....this is maybe a rental, nothing more.

After reading some reviews, I had expected the movie to be too violent and extreme to the extent that I might not be able to watch it.  Thankfully, that was not the case.  James Franco's direction was right on the mark.  The character actors were excellent as well:  Jeremy Ambler, Jim and Sierra Parrack, and many others were really integral to the action and visuals.

This is a tight crime drama of violence and shocking clarity. Something I love about the way James Franco directs his films is the grittiness and dirty feel of realism. From his As I Lay Dying and this one which explores the unique visionary talent of telling an already perfect story into film form.

I mean my God are you kidding me, this is written by one of the greatest writers of all time. Cormac McCarthy the true American novelist, playwright, and screenwriter. He wrote one of the greatest modern books of all time that will become a true literature classic and already is, 2006's The Road. His powerful in your face twist of brutal emotions for his 2005 novel No Country for Old Men. Which both of these films have been adapted as movies? He is a genius, a God of literature, an icon. His stories transcend the pages to become masterpieces of cinema. Not only are his books of literary masterpieces, his literature becomes masterpieces on film. The Road is extraordinary, No Country for Old Men is extraordinary and both are flawless award worthy movies.

6479757,3,B00LD0V9WY,"First, and this is an important point for me to make, I greatly appreciate and salute a literate young man, actor/director James Franco, for his efforts to bring great American literature to the screen.  It's not easy because most people in this severely dumb-downed culture are clueless when it comes to William Faulkner (As I Lay Dying and The Sound and the Fury) or Cormac McCarthy (the writer of Child of God).  Franco has attempted to transfer these somewhat difficult books to the screen.  Child of God is a sad and horrific little book.  My wife walked away from the DVD after Lester took a crap in the woods and wiped with a stick.  If you have any compassion in your body you might be able to see the sadness of this tale.  Lester (the main character) is made homeless when the county sells his piece of property in rural Tennessee.  When Lester (now 27) was a boy his mother ran off, his father hung himself in the family barn and his grandfather had once been a ""white cap"" (member of the KKK).  Before Lester leaves his property he is given a severe blow to the head with the blunt end of an ax.  He finds himself an abandoned little cabin in the woods and it becomes his home.  About all Lester can do is shoot a rifle and he wins three stuffed animals at a country fair by shooting targets and the stuffed animals become his friends (""someone"" to talk to).  He tries to help an old whore and gets arrested.  He comes upon an asphyxiated young couple parked in a car on a lonely country road.  He has sex with the dead girl and takes her body to his cabin.  He really seems to love the dead girl.  He yearns for somebody, anybody.  Anyway, things just get worse.  It is a tale of isolation, alienation and loneliness.  Lester ends up living in a cave.  I enjoyed the book and the movie was a good effort.  The subject matter is not for everyone.  Most people will probably dismiss the movie as disgusting trash but I see it as a very sad movie.  Lester was either brain-damaged, mentally ill, or simply driven mad with isolation, take your pick.  There are probably a lot more Lesters out there than we might care to admit.  Everybody (especially damaged human beings) need somebody.  Lester, like all of us, is a child of God.",1422835200,,2240,4.404878048780488

6479768,4,B00LD0V9WY,"For a film-maker adapting Cormac McCarthy's novels, it's difficult to extract the story from the prose. This is a problem unique to some of the best English stylists. While the film version of 'No Country For Old Men' is far superior to the other McCarthy novels that have made it to the screen, it's not considered to be one of his better books; Michael Chabon went so far as to call it a massive disappointment (something I disagree with). But it contained more action and dialogue than most of his previous novels, and the Coen brothers did a brilliant job, allowing McCarthy's dark lyrical tone and wry humor to counter-balance the brutality. These problems don't come up with John Grisham or Stephen King. If anything, the situation was reversed when Stanley Kubrick brought 'The Shining' to the screen, investing the film with a depth and beauty that is missing from the page*. Writers like Don Delillo, Denis Johnson, Ron Hansen, Michael Ondaatje and Charles Frazier, on the other hand, are all alpha-class wordsmiths of the highest order, and translating such artistry requires not only a very talented film-maker, but one who has a deep understanding of literature as well; 'Jesus' Son', 'The Assassination of Jesse James (...)', 'The English Patient', and 'Cold Mountain' stand as successful examples. With the exception of James Joyce, Thomas Pynchon and David Foster Wallace, Cormac McCarthy might be the most difficult novelist to adapt. While there are writers who have created far more dense, complicated or meandering tales, few have anywhere near the number of deeply devoted readers, a popularity that is particularly surprising given the reliably disturbing nature of his subject matter. But the old testament gravity of his narrative voice redeems every ugliness that crawls onto the page, and in the case of Lester Ballard, the sad, sickening wretch from 'Child of God', the soft light of his language is a necessity.

I was amazed by the audacity of the novel, that a writer could devote himself so entirely to staring into the abyssal depths of such depravity, and yet avoid the gratuitous details, and the impulse to shock or sensationalize. The cool empathy he maintained throughout was remarkable, as was the sheer accessibility of the book. Inspired by the lurid details of Ed Gein's incomprehensible crime spree, McCarthy once again offered up concise, unsentimental descriptions of rural Tennessee that recall and rival Faulkner's effortless elegance. He made no attempt to mitigate the most sickening and bizarre aspects of the Gein case, and despite the lyrical beauty it was a bleak and unrelentingly repulsive look at the perverse depths to which man could sink. While it stands as an impressive literary feat in it's own right, it was also a crucial moment in his development as a writer. It's importance as a precursor to the almost sublime nihilism of 'Blood Meridian' cannot be understated, and neither can the balls it took to write and publish 'Child of God'.

It also took balls for James Franco take on a project like 'Child of God', but anyone familiar with Franco's career beyond acting knows he's not lacking in ambition, even if his ambition often exceeds his abilities. As an art-lover, I consider his career as a... 'conceptual' artist wholly unimpressive, if not completely f***ing laughable; but to be fair, I haven't examined it closely enough to deem it worthless with any confidence. If his art is a joke, it may be he's in on it. Besides, I wouldn't want to cast aspersions on a film-maker just because I think his art sucks. Everyone likes to pretend at being a Da Vinci-style Renaissance man, but few people ever pull it off. Beyond the obvious problems posed by making a film about a backwoods necrophiliac and serial killer, the difficulty in extracting the story from the words is at it's most glaring in 'Child of God', which contains very little dialogue. Franco inserts as much of McCarthy's prose as he can, in the form of narration that appears at random intervals, in different voices, offering their sparse recollections of Ballard and his family history.

Scott Haze gives a memorable performance as Lester Ballard, inhabiting the feral, beaten, and pathetic skin of a man who doesn't know how to be human (by which I mean those higher notions of right and wrong that we usually tether to a metaphysical cornerstone, but which serve first as a basic requirement for any functional society, roughly correlating to the concept of the superego); he's forgotten, or he never learned. What makes Ballard so sickening is the possibility that every man is capable of the same monstrosities, beneath the thin, delicate sheen of civilization. Even though the blow to the back of his skull is left dangling for anyone who needs a reason to grasp onto, there's little question that the disease in Ballard lies dormant in every single one of us. Franco and Haze both recognize that making Ballard into a freak or a monster diminishes the power of McCarthy's vision; the closer that Ballard comes to approximating a human being, the more horrifying his amoral actions become.

I was taken away from the film on several occasions, dwelling on just how unpleasant filming certain scenes had to be, particularly for the actress who 'plays' Ballard's first 'girlfriend'. Although she appears in quite a few scenes, she's a corpse in all of them. I couldn't imagine a more thankless, uncomfortable role for an actress... she's little more than a prop, and less than an animatronic puppet, about as much a real character as the stuffed animals Ballard brings home from the fair. I couldn't watch 'Child of God' in one sitting. I'm not squeamish about much, but there is a despair at the core of this film that I don't remember from the novel, although I know it had to have been there. But I was able to survive several hours of reading without suffering the same hopelessness I felt watching the film. Again, story/language... something is lost in translation. {75/100}

P.S.: I don't usually issue warnings regarding possibly offensive content, but if you've ever been offended by anything, at any time, you should probably think twice before watching 'Child of God'. Just for the fun of it, visit imdb.com or one of those other sites that offer a detailed breakdown of the film's more controversial scenes. On a completely unrelated note, I am so sick of movie posters and Blu-ray covers that depict the same tired layout I've seen tens of thousands of times before. Big floating heads on top, title in the middle, movie still on the bottom. It's no coincidence that the 'Child of God' poster is almost identical to McCarthy's most successful novel-to-film adaptation, 'No Country for Old Men'.

P.S.2: *To this day I'm baffled by King's problems with Kubrick's adaptation of 'The Shining'. He's had a good number of adaptations that transcend the source material, something that any writer should pray for, not fear. Mario Puzo's novel 'The Godfather' belongs on the drugstore spinner-rack next to Joan Collins and Stephanie Meyers, while Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is suitable company for 'Citizen Kane' and 'Casablanca'. Hopefully you'll get the distinction, because I'm too lazy to explain it. Few, if any writers have anything close to King's track record: 'The Shining', of course, but also 'Carrie', 'Stand By Me', 'Misery', 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'The Green Mile', and 'The Mist' are some of the best, and most of them claimed Academy Awards in one category or another. On the downside, however, there's 'Christine', 'Cujo', 'Firestarter', 'Monkey Shines', 'Maximum Overdrive', 'Night Shift' and the TV series 'Under the Dome', some of which qualify as contenders for the title of 'Worst Book Adaptation of All Time'. When someone finally agreed to do the remake of 'The Shining' that no one besides King himself had been clamoring for, as a TV mini-series, it was predictably terrible.",1419811200,3,7961,5.0045283018867925

Franco made a couple of weird decisions (simple, fixable things like the font for interludes and the title) or staying with one shot/scene too long (Ballard shooting his stuffed animals in the woods, for example, could have been done better) that I think would have made this film even better, but still, if you liked the book, you'll like the movie.",1419638400,2,646,5.152380952380953

This does more damage to the literature than one could possibly imagine. If there is any redemption taking place in the novel, it is surely lost in the translation. This is not even a copy of a copy with the inevitable loss of detail with each generation; this was a translation by someone who doesn't know the language and slapped the text over an Aerosmith soundtrack.

6479798,3,B00LD0V9WY,"This is a screen adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's book of the same name and it follows the book very closely. It is the story of Lester Ballard (Scott Haze) who loses his home and land after his father's suicide and his inability to appear to do anything useful. Left with nothing but his Winchester rifle and the clothes on his back he becomes semi feral living in a drafty cabin and stealing what he needs or shooting what he can.

His petty crimes soon lead him to do more serious things and his sexual desires soon take on a hue that is decidedly perverted. To say any more would be a plot spoiler, but for those who have read the book you will know what to expect.

As this is from one of the best living authors it was always going to be difficult to get this to work on film. James Franco directs this, acts in it and worked on the screenplay adaptation. He uses narration to direct the events and add explanation but not always the vivid colour that the prose is able to do. He also divides the film into three distinct parts in an attempt to exemplify the passage of time, but it is a pretty ineffective tool to be honest. Haze as the sick Ballard puts in an excellent performance if a bit too mumbly at times - I actually thought sub titles might have been handy at one point.

There is swearing, scenes of defecation (why?) and unsavoury sexual practices so this is one where you should note the certification. I love McCarthy and had a picture in my minds eye of how this should look and it is not too far out, so a very good effort; but as a cinematic experience this could have been better.

The acting by Scott Haze, in the lead role, was spellbinding. A bit of background on his preparation for the character shows that he went to tremendous lengths to understand the kind of life the character led. Haze absolutely convinced me that he WAS Scott Haze.

The rest of the acting was rather amateurish, or seemed so compared to that of the lead.",1416355200,,553,4.465346534653466
6479801,3,B00LD0V9WY,"In reading Cormac McCarthy's novel about its troubled, child-minded lead character, I enjoyed watching the character of Lester Ballard unfold from the pages of McCarthy's novel onto the screen.  Speaking clearly for myself, I was crossed with a mixture of both pity and hatred for this man who could hold such a child-like innocence as he talked to his stuffed animals as his closest friends and yet, who we see over the course of the film develop simply into a murdering psychopath.

The film itself is not great.  It unwinds slowly, yet Scott Haze who plays Ballard gives a performance that is startlingly eerie.  You feel this man's pain, and for brief moments, perhaps even empathize with the amount of sorrow that is living like an animal.  Haze brings Ballards' cruelty, innocence, violence and insanity to the screen with genius.

There are enough reviews already posted about the synopsis of the film, so I don't need to rehash everything there.  At this point, you know what you are getting yourself into.  This is not a feel good movie.  This is not something that you will walk away from easily.  It is like watching a beautiful train wreck and you will be thinking about it well after the movie's end.  Perhaps not about what happened or happens to Lester Ballard, but about what people are capable of and even perhaps the depths that you yourself could be capable of if stripped of everything.

6479805,4,B00LD0V9WY,"Child of God is James Franco's best film so far. That said, it has plenty of issues.

I'm an avid reader of Cormac McCarthy, so I wasn't taken aback by the subject matter like so many Amazon reviewers. This is one film that you should do some research on before you decide to watch it, because its theme and subject are no less than the very depths of human depravity. Incredibly, the film is even somewhat tamer than the source novel: Franco cuts a couple of the book's more skin-crawling sequences, and the macabre violence that does make it into the film is somewhat easier to digest without McCarthy's cruelly distant narrator pointing out every shifting bone and desiccated muscle.

Franco is clearly improving as a director, and his lo-fi poetic realism is much better suited to Cormac McCarthy than it is to William Faulkner. Amateurish missteps still abound, but much less frequently than in Franco's earlier work - the close-ups can be chaotic, the dramatic pauses last too long, and the use of music ranges from ill-advised to downright terrible. However, while the biggest issue with Franco's adaptation of As I Lay Dying was that his ambition greatly outweighed his ability to adapt an ""unfilmable"" book, here we see him scaling back and applying his formidable talents to a less-epic tale, one that allows him to wallow in the mud without getting his head lost in the clouds. The ""point"" of the story is as nebulous in the film as it was in the novel, and Franco wisely avoids moralizing and philosophizing in favor of presenting a stark and striking character study of one of modern literature's most deranged protagonists. In this capacity, Child of God is an outstanding success, and a worthy entry into the McCarthy filmography.

Franco deserves his due, but the real reason to watch Child of God is for Scott Haze's unbelievable performance as the unhinged Lester Ballard. Writing that last sentence, I tried the words ""electrifying"" and ""landmark"" before settling on ""unbelievable,"" because I'm not sure how best to describe how fully and frighteningly convincing Haze is. He disappears into the character with such alacrity, it's as if Ballard leaped straight off of the page. Every hoot, grunt, and garbled word that comes out of his mouth seems like the genuine ravings of a madman, and his bearded face twists into a mask of madness and desperation that completely hides the normal-looking young man beneath. I had never heard of Scott Haze before watching this movie, and he has jumped to the top of my list of actors to watch out for. There are many veteran thespians working today who can't even hope to approach the level of commitment and skill that Haze demonstrates in this film, and his performance alone makes it worth watching, warts and all.

Speaking of warts: while most of McCarthy's oeuvre is much more ""filmable"" than Faulkner's, Franco's film still falls short in many of the same ways as his previous attempts at adapting legendary works of literary fiction. Child of God is meticulously faithful to its source material, but the differences between the two mediums become immediately apparent. The majority of the action in McCarthy's novel is indeed composed of Ballard stumbling and gibbering his way through the deep forests of Tennessee, but the novel ballasts this inactivity with McCarthy's trademark prose. Unable to do this, Franco must pad the film with several long sequences of Haze just... walking and grunting. Haze's formidable presence makes these sequences tolerable, but still boring and unnecessary. Also, the fractured narrative does not make it onto the screen completely unharmed - whenever the camera cuts away from Ballard's depravities, the film begins to drag, and Tim Blake Nelson's admirable turn as Sheriff Fate does little to save it.

All in all, Child of God is an interesting art-house experiment, an entertaining and haunting ride, and a worthy adaptation of McCarthy. James Franco demonstrates just what he is capable of when his limitless ambition is tempered, and Scott Haze gives a stunning breakout performance. The film is full of hiccups and some amateurish gestures, sure, but it's the first Franco-helmed movie that I would describe as ""good,"" even if it falls well short of ""great."" In any case, I look forward to seeing what elements of Child of God make it into Franco's future films (which I have high, if tentative, hopes for), and I will be watching Scott Haze's career with great interest.

In short: if you're already a grungy art-house fan, a Franco fan, or just an admirer of stellar acting chops, this may well be the film for you. If you aren't, you shouldn't be surprised when Child of God defies your notions of what a film should and should not be.",1415750400,20,4746,4.91147132169576
6479806,2,B00LD0V9WY,"More a reverie on the Cormac McCarthy story than a depiction.  Atmosphere is good but too much is omitted from the book to make a compelling story.

Haze's portrayal is good but there's no sense of trajectory with the character (how about less necrophilic detail and more incident?)  Those who have read this short novel will get this quickly into the film.  Some really good episodes from the book's story are simply bypassed.  Unlike the book the film's ending is inconclusive.  I suspect this is what happens when the director tries too hard for ""art"" in a movie.

Also no way would Lester have had perfect teeth.",1415664000,,616,4.700934579439252
6479807,4,B00LD0V9WY,"The film opens as does the novel with the procession of Lester Ballard's home community ascending the hill ""like a carnival"" to his home place.  In the first 5 minutes we can see for ourselves that Lester is challenged, alone, afraid and desperate; and, his community wishes only to be shut of him.  Acting out outrageously, brandishing a rifle (which, we might note if paying attention, he demonstrates clearly to be unloaded by repeatedly working the lever action), we learn his neighbors have already had him jailed once and as the crowd stands by and watches, we see Lester cold-cocked with an axe head by the man who will buy his family home, leaving him bleeding, humiliated and wretched in the dirt, crying out loud.  We should note that first cry is clearly portrayed as one of grief, sorrow and suffering.  The cries of desperate rage will come later.  It is, as other reviewers comment, hard to take.

For now, we see the auctioneer lamely comment, ""We're gonna get this man some help"", as the crowd of neighbors leaves him laying, crying where he's fallen and the auction of his home proceeds as if his presence is nothing but a momentary distraction.  He is dispossessed, and his neighbors offer him no comfort or help, as we see him with rifle and the clothes on his back, walking up into the hills.  The questions as this table is set are, can we balance our fear and loathing for this clearly disturbed and deranged man with any measure of compassion and practical regard to attempt to address his needs?  And, if we do not, what will he do?  What is it, in fact, that transforms him from merely unfortunate to become deranged?  And so the story unfolds.

To appreciate this film, it's virtually required to have followed and appreciate both Cormac McCarthy's literary progression and the uneven and abortive history of efforts to translate McCarthy's body of work to the screen.  McCarthy is a supremely dark, gifted, and serious writer and any film attempting to do his work justice represents a leap of courage and a stretch effort by those engaged in the project.  In my view, most have failed in the effort, but Franco, because he clearly takes McCarthy's work seriously and attempts to represent it in a serious manner, is not among the failures.  For the uninitiated and those who come to the movie unprepared to take it seriously and view it with sensitivity if not empathy, the film will almost certainly promote precisely the effect the community at large directs to Lester in the movie--fear, loathing, denial, and, of course, ultimately strong censure in hopes he will simply go away.  We become the High Sherriff:  ""You either got to stop livin' the way you do, or you got to find another place to do it.""  The High Sheriff tells the story of Lester in the guise of a tale of a hunting dog who was sick, had always been sick, and would always be sick and, we are to assume, beyond help or any greater expectation.  So it is with resignation and reluctance to go along with his contempt that the High Sheriff deals with Lester.

Be careful, in damning Child of God without understanding, of becoming another not quite so dark a writer's audience, those who sweep the children of Ignorance and Want lurking in the robes of Father Christmas aside.  Charles Dickens, in a Christmas Carol, dares us to both look and respond, and challenges us to realize purposeful ignorance is our doom.

  ""They were a boy and a girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a tale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread.

  Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.

  'Spirit. are they yours.' Scrooge could say no more.

  'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it.' cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye. Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And abide the end.'

Dickens wrote his dark story of the Ghosts of Christmas from a Christian perspective--and when portrayed faithfully, it is a dark tale.  McCarthy is an atheist, extremely critical of the church, and writes from a perspective challenging us to represent God's Kingdom in the midst of the squalor, depravity and brutishness we often choose to gloss or deny while attempting to convince ourselves it is not real and we are perhaps different and above it rather than an inextricably involved component of this tough old world.  There is no taboo McCarthy has not touched upon and, in many cases, repeatedly.  In this he shares with the canon Scripture of the Bible, with which he is both conversant and to which he often alludes.  But the message is one designed to shake us into awareness and action--not mere shock and scandal for its own sake.  In this, McCarthy may share much with the Scripture revealing the God of Abraham in which he has no faith.

Scott Haze delivers a performance rivaled only by Ray Liotta's extraordinary turn in Devolver.  But, Haze's character, unlike Liotta's, is intended to represent the ultra-real manifestation of humanity's darkness and not the surreal.  In his execution, Haze excels.  It is saying too little in favor of this cinematic rendition of McCarthy's typically disturbing work, to leave it at accolades for Haze in his portrayal of Lester. The entire cast delivers effective performance of the roles assigned, in a credible adaptation representing, if not precisely, the original work.  The pacing is effective in both conveying the sense of aloneness, self-awareness and situation of Lester; and, in allowing us some opportunity to reflect on what is happening.

McCarthy is known for his extraordinary use of language to describe nature and scenic vistas.  While this is not absent in his earlier work, it is primarily in his novels beginning with Blood Meridian that McCarthy's word pictures become the stuff of imagination, in the open expanses, canyons and mountains of the West.  Anyone familiar with The Border Trilogy (All the Pretty Horses, Cities of the Plain, and The Crossing), likely still has memories of panoramic sweeping scenes painted in our minds inspired by McCarthy's descriptions.  But, the earlier work is based in the Southeast and South, and the settings tend to be more closed while McCarthy's descriptions of them (whether a river bottom or the treed hills of Tennessee), are nevertheless striking.  Franco chooses to be tighter with his shots than opting for sweeping cinematography and in so doing chooses an effective vehicle.  The audience must deal with the characters and their immediate environment.  Being close to Lester makes us squirm uncomfortably, and consider that we can almost smell what must be his utterly indescribable stench.  No wonder we long for the long shots, tall timber and ridge lines demarcated by sunlight and sky.  Franco will have none of it.

Turned out into the wilderness, Lester progresses through a Job-like series of losses.  It is not God who, in His council, dispatches Satan to test Lester.  Lester is, as the viewer increasingly realizes, a mimic of his community and Lester, without any love, concern, care or guidance from the community, returns every example in a perverse imitation.  And, Lester, of course, starts out with deficits not of his making.  Who makes the monster?  Pathetic Lester, his neighbors or their purposeful isolation of Lester from human relation?  We see his reflection of the feelings, words and actions directed at him, including a brief interlude in which he interacts with a young woman keeping shop who, while cautious and somewhat perplexed by him, shows him courtesy and laughs with him though we know Lester is in her shop on an unspeakably grotesque errand.  It is a weird moment of juxtaposition of what we know and what we are seeing in the moment through the lens.

The tragedy in the midst of the increasing depravity exhibited by Lester is that Lester is seeking community, albeit in counterproductive ways.  He is driven by a primal motive to survive, to exist, but as soon as he is able he attempts to reestablish a sense of a home place, first squatting in a broken down cabin and ultimately in a cave.  And, having established a home place, Lester then moves to establish some kind of relationship in community within his home.  His trip to a fair where he wins 3 large stuffed animals to take home sets up the understanding of what is happening when he progresses to serial murder.  Unable to find relationship with humanity in his own community, Lester seeks outlets in the inanimate and ultimately progresses to make the living dead to serve his need.

While our knowledge of what is happening provokes an extreme revulsion (as evidenced by a multitude of reviews), and it should, the fact is that its portrayal by Franco is substantially more guarded than the vast majority of gratuitous graphic sex scenes and full frontal nudity that graces a majority of R rated films and cable video shows in illustration of absolutely no point.  For those wondering, there is no full nudity and the aberrant sexual behavior referenced is depicted near fully clothed.  Nor is there a realist portrayal of rigor, lividity or decomposition.  Franco chooses to opt for some restraint.  Were it not for the aberrant aspect, it would undoubtedly be judged tame by comparison to some PG-13 rated films.  But the aberrant aspect of the portrayal is central to the plot and the understanding of how far Lester has departed from the range of normalcy within his community (but, don't miss the perspective on what is normal in this community).  He does turn to become the embodiment of the Zodiac killer and Ed Gein.  We are really invited to experience the tension Thomas Harris articulates through his character, Will Graham, in Red Dragon:  as a child, he's a victim, and our hearts bleed for him.  As an adult, he's a monster and has to be put down.

Perhaps.  What Haze portrays so well is a character who leaves us in some level of doubt and ambivalence.  He seems wrathful, vengeful, hateful and depraved, and clearly emotionally and mentally deranged.  But, there are moments which we begin to realize are witnessed by no one, shared only by the inanimate and the dead, reflecting an inept but unmistakable tenderness directed to the only objects to which Lester can relate.  It's not the need to arrange the dead to make him feel powerful that's portrayed in many films and true crime books about serial murderers--Lester remains needy, simply seeking to give and receive affection, and pathetic.  It's hard to look at, to take and to absorb, but it is there.  There is, of course, a childlike sense that he returns again and again to the realm of the animate and living, seeking the comfort of other humans, unable to absorb that they will reject him every time and his behavior only makes their rejection the more determined.  There is his obvious pain, dismay, and rising anger that he doesn't even seem to be capable of peacefully existing alone, isolated, in derelict shelter abandoned by all others, surrounded only by those things that cannot object to his existence.  There is the fact that the man appears to be, at a minimum, of diminished capacity, and in all probability incapable of appreciating the moral judgment of right and wrong.  Finally, there is the hint that, facing rejection of himself at every turn he seeks to become someone else altogether, and is completely unhinged.  A sensitive viewing will leave us ambivalent perhaps, and wondering what really must be done about, and for, Lester.

Could the film have been better done, the directorial frame and cinematography bigger and more cognizant of the land in which set?  Yes.  Might adaptation from the particulars of the novel been better executed?  As almost always, any given viewer who read the novel will have an opinion.  Are there some misfires, like the attempt to film Lester's crawl through what should be a pitch black and pinched space in a cave (lighting, camera framing and filters, yeah?)?  There are.  But, in the pantheon of film adaptations of McCarthy's work Franco's Child of God stands among the best to date.

There is always the question of whether some authors' work even lends itself to screen adaptation, and McCarthy's work is among those.  While I believe Thornton butchered All the Pretty Horses and wisely stood down in proceeding with any effort to attempt the remainder of The Border Trilogy (not that it couldn't be done, but amazingly, it obviously wasn't going to be done well by Thornton), No Country for Old Men was a very reasonable effort and The Road, being relatively straightforward and McCarthy's most accessible work, lent itself well to joining the long line of post-apocalypse movies (and, in keeping with McCarthy's novel, captures well the reality of the hopelessness of the scenario as opposed to the more typical portrayals).

Panned by many, The Counselor is a solid production of McCarthy's script written for the express purpose of being made into the movie--no wonder, since McCarthy took matters into his own hands.  But, in my opinion, simply looking at the script, casting and direction, and production values, I believe Child of God may be the best single screen adaptation of a McCarthy novel to date.  No Country and The Road come close.  McCarthy is gritty, raw, and harsh--big scope may be required but big studio gloss doesn't help, and Franco handles the material with guts and grit.

That leaves the question of whether the film should have been made at all, or whether the material should reside in the medium for which conceived, the novel.  There is both the graphic and somewhat assaultive aspect of film--a novel allows us to visualize what we wish and edit out as we see fit, and stop reading to take a rest or consider our response.  Whatever anyone wishes to conclude about the pacing, Child of God keeps coming at us in its film version.  Franco has apparently answered the question whether McCarthy should be transferred to audiovisual media in the negative--his second McCarthy film project has been cancelled.  Some will be glad.  I for one, having seen what Franco did with Child of God, would have been curious to see him try his hand at Blood Meridian and I hope when he decides he can do it justice, he'll renew the attempt.  But, on second thought, given its themes and brutal (accurate, and historically based) depictions, perhaps it is best left alone.  We can instead cluck, ""sure it's reality, but who needs to have it shoved in their face?""  We can opt for ""Ignorance"".  Rename it, ""Lester"".

We see the long shot at the end of the film, and we know, Lester abides.  'Slander those who tell it ye. Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse. And abide the end.'  McCarthy studies his localities' history, culture, legend and myth.  His stories are grotesque in their darkness, but more grotesquely, real.  Is there no God here?

6479822,1,B00LD0V9WY,"I left off viewing this after a near-unspeakable scene which those of you who are reasonable will apprehend on sight.  To me, at the moment, there seemed to be some manner of vile imposition on me as a man, a person, with this filmed depiction of a human sexual pathology.  I've grown increasingly convinced that most movies are crap, most actors, actresses are narcissistic mediocrities.  Occasionally, I am gladdened by a movie with intelligence, dignity, a cohesive narrative, all that blah blah film reviewer stuff.  But such movies are not just an exception any more.  They are rare, getting rarer.  Those of us favorably inclined towards The Movies, many of us I'm assuming, are becoming like unto farmers pitch-forking through a dung heap, looking for silver dollars.  And, hey, still, in the words of that great American philosopher Brad Paisley, ""I'm just a guy,"" not at all above watching bad guys getting their asses kicked, taking lead to the head.  Just A Guy Movies.  But I left off on Child Of God, midway through the aforementioned scene.  What the hell's wrong with Cormac McCarthy?  Guy's an amazing writer.  What, he needs the money?  Some studio apes cadged this from McCarthy's earliest writing?  Like, when he was 14?  Exploitation of his name?  What?  The Hell?  Wait a minute.  This is Cormac McCarthy, man.  All The Pretty Horses.  The Road.  The Counselor.  Maybe Child Of God is McCarthy's parable regarding human desolation, loneliness, what it can be like when one is ""broken"" or ""defective.""  The protagonist is not treated with the slightest charity by any one, other than mercantile courtesies.  Wait, yeah, sure, McCarthy and his Towering Talent, that's where we're at here, a parable, about loneliness, desolation, human need.  The ""scene"" was driving in a parable point regarding human sexual need, the need for physical intimacy, even among men ""broken"" or ""defective.""  Yeah, Corm, point taken, how powerful, wowee-zowee, what a point!  So, with gratitude for digitization, I gave Child Of God a second look, skipping past the scene, convinced that Ol' Corm, having made his wowee-zowee parable point via depicting a human sexual pathology, would move right along.  It's a parable.  About human need.  Desolation.  Corm got the point across real good, with the car scene, gosh, what an artiste.  However, if there's a second helping, I'm out, Corm.  And you're bat-snot crazy.  You and every other show biz mediocrity involved with this thing.  It's not simply unnecessary to re-visit this poor bastard, with this poor young woman, in their death and desolation and loneliness and ""gone-ness.""  If there's a second scene, well, it's worse than ""not necessary.""  It's cruel.  Cruelty.  So now I know what I was catching whiffs of in other movies based on McCarthy novels, two qualities:  misanthropy and cruelty.  But he's a great artiste, right?  Anything for art, right?  The artiste is ""free"" wowee-zowee, full expression, wowee-zowee,  Hence we end up with crucifixes in urine jars.  Wowee-zowee.  It's art!  Such freedom!  Such liberation!  Yeah, McCarthy and his whole pathetic show-biz posse can have it.  I'm helping to re-build a small block 8.  Now that's art...",1415059200,,3208,5.082851637764932

There are some things that never need to be filmed, and the boundary between Art and filth isn't even a question in this case.
When a film maker has to claim its ""Art"", it's probably filth, as is the case here.
Cormac McCarthy, revered in his writing talents, wrote a book that was in itself depraved. We all know there are less fortunate individuals in this world who do not possess common intelligence or common sense. That doesn't mean that it should be portrayed.
I have read the book, and now watched the movie. I am none better for it.
You cannot feel sorry for the character, Lester Ballard. He is one step from being an animal. The book at least has a little more background about how he came to be. As a society, these things are not commonly seen as entertainment, nor should they. To watch this film is to become a voyeur in the depravity.

The answer is I'm not so squeamish, it's just there's a good way to direct necrophilia, there's the sanitized artsy palatable way, (I imagine) and there's the ....way this movies does it....
I mean you have to admire someone taking on such a grossly unappealing story.
It would be like trying to direct Dostoevsky's ""Notes From Underground"" or a 2014 remake of ""Naked Lunch.""
As a literature slut, I'd still check out those imagined movies if they came to fruition, and I enjoyed ""the sunset limited,"" the much disputed ""the counselor"" was sleek and terrifying, ""no country for old men"" is a classic, unfortunately this movie does not follow in the long line of successfully translated Cormac McCarthy novels.

 Haze is effective but his teeth are too perfect (what happened in make-up?)  and his hair/beard too perfect  (again, make-up department failed badly) to be a grizzled and uneducated evil guy, even if young and fit. The title makes one think- and is the issue the author raises in this tale of evil and self-interest combined with low functioning and lack of family or means of support. Well made by Franco in my opinion. Sort of a Deliverance and Winter's Bone turned inside out. In the latter, we are identifying empathically with the Jennifer Lawrence character, whereas in this one we definitely do not identify with Haze (Ballard) since he is despicable in so many ways. The scenes of depravity and defecation merely graphically bring this home to us, even if no fun watching.
Easy to see why it flopped- too hard to watch in places and a slow pace rather than a thriller. Makes one want to avoid the woods, too. However, the title is a super conversation starter about this movie.
We went to Greece recently and were amazed at how this nation currently going broke fast could be full of such gracious and generous people. When we asked a shopkeeper, she said, ""If we were any different, we would just be animals"". Like Ballard, i guess. He is a Child of God but IS an animal. Might he have been a part of society with a different family? we do not know, not part of the book nor the movie. Unlike in Natural Born Killers where the author allows us access to the origins of the evildoers and their making at the hands of their narcissistic parents. Sociopathy has roots and it is not always simply a ""bad seed"". We make our monsters and then we must kill them; this is the message to me of Child of God.",1502150400,,1773,4.449230769230769
