7753513,1,B01G24WNGG,"Because I love Prince, I like any thing his in but I have to say this DVD was a let down in the since that it seem to be thrown together. It contains two interviews, one with Larry King the other his first interview. That's it,",1473724800,9,227,3.9565217391304346
7753514,1,B01G24WNGG,"I agree with all the other reviews. This is a total waste of money. It is nothing but 4 interviews and it is rather boring. No music, no music segments, nada. If it had a tour of Paisley Park as part of the close up and personal biography or something interesting, it may have had a little more value. This was very misleading, as is, and a total waste of money. If you want to waste and throw away your money, and your time, get it.",1473638400,14,433,4.046511627906977

7753516,1,B01G24WNGG,Buyer beware....it's not a biography.  Composed of several interviews that has nothing to with description associated with this product.  Please change the write up to reflect what it truly is..,1473465600,6,194,5.433333333333334
7753517,3,B01G24WNGG,"What a huge disappointment! This is nothing more than segments of Prince interviews,all of which I have seen and have on other media DVD' s in their entirety. The only reason I gave it a 3 is because it is Prince and I am a diehard fan.",1473465600,8,236,4.042553191489362
7753518,3,B01G24WNGG,"The write up for this DVD seemed like it would be something found on Biography.  It is not.  I love Prince but the first half of this was the Larry King interview back in 1998, which I've seen before on YouTube.  This part of the DVD is high quality.  It is followed by an interview in a hotel/night club overseas (I forgot where and haven't checked to see if it's on YouTube).  There he's asked questions by reporters (prior to 2012).  That part is darkly lit with the hand-held camera drifting, shaking, and moving.  This entire segment is heavily purple (ironic, not intentional), including the participants, the room -- everything except a contrasting yellow background light over the bar. The quality suffers as a result. He talks about a concert the night before, fashion, dreams, CDs selling in Europe as compared to the U.S. (bootlegging problems, freedom to create, for example), and God. Next was the tv interview with George Lopez, also on YouTube. Here the quality is not very good.  It's blurry, almost grainy for the most part.  Bad fade to black.  Next, Nov. 1985, Prince's first interview (MTV) which is also on YouTube.  Picture quality again is blurry more often than not.  Sound/volume is inconsistent on this part.  FIN.  If I had known this, I would not have bought it.

I gave it 3 stars because it was about Prince even though I had seen these interviews before with the exception of the hotel/night club interview.  The picture and sound quality varies after the King interview.  This is not a biography.  It is prior interviews compiled on a DVD.  Nothing new.",1473379200,21,1585,4.73992673992674

I wanted especially to view the entire George Lopez interview!!! There are 3 interviews. DVD seems like it was just thrown together. No music videos, extras, exclusive performances. Not impressed at all. Do Not waste your money. You could find these 3 interviews on YouTube for FREE!!!",1478476800,9,431,5.260869565217392
