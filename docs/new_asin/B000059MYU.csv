7933690,4,B000059MYU,"With few documentaries focusing on this tragedy (second only to the Titanic in 20th century maritime history), PBS has done an admirable (if dry) job of presenting the story of the Lusitania from her conception and construction and right up to her ultimate fate as a symbol of the horrors of World War I.
While this is essentially a good effort by PBS to tell the story of this ship and the tragedy surrounding her, there are some flaws.  People may be frustrated that the story of the Lusitania ends with America's entry into World War I.  There isn't a word about the wreck as it was at the time of filming (about 2000/2001), or visits to the wreck since the sinking (of which there were a few of note).  The focus is much more on the ship, naval policies made during World War I that would impact the Lusitania, and the implications of her demise for the warring nations.  The recreations of the ship are also very obviously filmed aboard the Queen Mary in Santa Monica (interiors are one thing but the exteriors are unmistakably of the Queen Mary).
Overall this is an admirable effort to tell the story of a tragedy of war and one of the most beautiful ships of her day.",1419724800,,1174,4.446511627906977
