2423523,4,B000BLEAKO,"This is a follow along -type workout program using kettlebell. You don't need any other exercise equipment apart from the kettlebell. The workout consists of a short warm up, 14 rounds of exercise and a bonus round.

Each round is two minutes long, with one minute rest period between the rounds. Each round uses a different exercise (and in some cases, there are two or three exercises combined to one round). On the left side of the screen there is a time counter, so you can constantly see how much time there is left in the round before you get some rest. You get a very good total body workout, but I was somewhat uneasy of some exercises. There are two or three exercises where you essentially throw the kettlebell into the air with one hand and grab it midair with the other. As the film is a follow along film, you'll probably work out inside your home, and dropping a kettlebell to the floor can be very expensive accident, so you'll have to be extra careful when going through these exercises.

I'm quite new to the kettlebell training, and I found this workout to be very challenging. Naturally, you can make it easier by using a lighter kettlebell or taking short breaks during the rounds. But still, I think this workout is not aimed to the beginner. Although the instructor gives some basic advise at the beginning of the film (like telling how to choose the right weight for the kettlebell), the individual exercises are not taught very thoroughly. You are urged to practice individual exercises before launching the workout, but as they are not taught very extensively, you'll have seek elsewhere for more detailed instructions.",1156291200,38,1644,4.724738675958188
2423524,5,B000BLEAKO,"I have been training with Kettlebells for about two years and was happy to find Anthony in Providence, RI. He corrected alot of my mistakes and has made my training more intense and focused. The DVD helped me organize my training and forced me to think about how one exercise flowed into another. Also, it is the first DVD that I have bought that you can use to work out along to instead of just using it as just an intructional tool. I would highly recommend the DVD to anyone who wants to increase their strength, endurance, keep it simple, have fun, and have a instructional tool that you can take with you if you are traveling!

Its about 50 minutes, and nowhere and the DVD case or menu does it list the workout. But I wrote that up for future reference so If I want a shorter workout I know what sections I would want to skip.  The only tricky exercise is the windmill/overhead squat (the overhead squat is the tricky one, seems like it could lead to back injury if you are tired and the weight is too heavy).

2423531,4,B000BLEAKO,"This is a great workout. I normally wait until I have done a workout a few more weeks before reviewing (I've only done this dvd twice), but I have done plenty of KB workouts and can already tell this is a great workout. For reference, I've done the Skogg 11-week program twice now so I know what a great full-body workout using a kettlebell can be. This workout introduces some classic kettlebell moves with great explanations of how to perform them correctly and safely. You perform 14 different exercise intervals of 2 minutes each, followed by an all-you-can-do 3 minute snatch test at the end. You only need one kettlebell for all of the exercises included. He gives you a 1-minute break between each 2-minute interval , which is a little too long (part of the reason for the 4 star rating). It's a good mix of moves that work your full body, plus some that are focused on just lower body or just upper body.

I wish the warm-up was a little more substantial and there is no cool-down at the end which is too bad, but you can add your own. I'd definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who has kettlebell experience. If you've been doing Skogg (whose workout I still love), this is a great 5th DVD to add to your rotation. I don't know that I'd recommend to beginners, but I plan to use it quite a bit. Good purchase.",1417564800,15,1319,4.405737704918033

2423536,5,B000BLEAKO,"I started working out with kettle bells about two years ago.  After experimenting with several different types of aerobic and weight based workouts, I found that kettle bell training was the most whole body workout that combined aerobic, weight training, core strengthening and balance exercises into a single, short interval based workout.  After finally finding kettle bells, the next challenge was to find a great workout DVD.  I purchased and tried out several kettle bell DVDs.  Among my favorites are DVDs by Lauren Brooks and Paul Katami, however, the one I keep coming back to for my standard kettle bell workout is the Art of Strength - Providence.  I feel it gives me the best total body kettle bell workout and I continue to use this DVD every week.  I also have the Art of Strength - Newport and Firepower.  I find some of the exercises in Newport to be too difficult (I am in my 50s and have osteoarthritis), but I can do the exercises in Firepower and enjoy that DVD as an alternative to Providence on occasion.

As proof that I use this DVD often, here are a few things to look for in the DVD:

- In Round 2 - Cleans, there is a Alfred Hitchcock look alike walking along the sidewalk.

- In Round 7 - Clean and Press, Anthony only does 4 clean and presses on the right side at the beginning instead of 5.

- In the Bonus Round (which I am never happy to see...), Anthony tells you that you're half way through when you are only one third way through.

I highly recommend this DVD as a great all around kettle bell workout.",1375574400,,1537,4.430604982206406
2423537,5,B000BLEAKO,"I have waited for over nine months to write this review because I wanted to ensure that I was able to provide feedback that was not based on the excitement of starting a new workout routine. I was first introduced to Anthony Diluglio's Firepower DVD by a coworker. I watched the DVD and wrote down the workout routine and started doing it once a week at my local gym. I worked for six months eventually building up to working the Firepower routine two to three times per week. I then branched out and purchased his Providence DVD. This shocked my system because it moved from working each exercise for one minute each, as in Firepower, to two minutes per exercise. However, I was able to get through it nonstop the first go around even though it was challenging; I attribute getting through Providence on day one to having taken six months to build a solid base with Firepower. After working Providence for three months I again branched out and purchased Newport. Newport is awesome! Talk about a shock to the system. Each workout set is four to five minutes including a one minute set of abs; thankfully I had that strong base built through Firepower. Getting through Newport is still a struggle and requires a little more mental toughness than Firepower and Providence. I do have to use a lighter KB for some of the Newport exercise but I know eventually I'll build to where I'm using the same weight KB for all of Newport.

The above method is what worked for me and I provide it to hopefully encourage others interested in pursuing KB workouts a good starting point. I cannot emphasize enough though the importance of starting out slowly, working at your own pace, and building a solid base focusing primarily on developing your core strength. Of note is that I also lost 35 pounds during that first six months (245 to 210; I'm 6 ft. 4 in. for height/weight reference purposes); I'm still dropping weight too. This is in part due to three major lifestyle changes: (1) I quit drinking alcohol; (2) I reduced my sugar intake, to include natural sugars, to less than 20 grams per day (if you think this is hard the book `The Belly Fat Cure: Discover the New Carb Swap System and Lose 4 to 9 lbs. Every Week' by Jorge Cruise can help); (3) I started working out five days per week (Mon - cardio, Tue - strength training, Wed - cardio, Thur - cross training, Fri - cardio).

As far as Anthony Diluglio is concerned, I could not ask for a better virtual personal trainer. He does go through some tutorials for some of his exercises which I do recommend watching as it will help with form and prevent injury; all-in-all though he expects that you will come with some sort of knowledge of KB strength training on how to do exercises properly. Even if you are just starting out, as long as you take it slow and at your own pace, you can easily follow along with him during each routine and the changing camera angles really help capture the nuances of each exercise. Again, start out slow and build that solid base focusing on keeping your core tight during each exercise!

Currently, my workout rhythm for strength training in general is on a monthly cycle with one hard strength training workout each week. Week one is the Providence followed up with a run through Firepower. Week two is the Newport routine again followed up with a run through Firepower. Week three is the Firepower routine walking up the five set pyramid and then working down through the same pyramid taking my rest at the pyramid's top. Week four is a rest from KBs and I do the CrossFit Filthy Fifty (or Dirty Thirty if I'm not feeling up to par; Dirty Thirty is the same thing as Filthy Fifty but just 30 sets of each exercise). Recall that I spent over six months building a solid base, focusing on core strength, before being able to get to this point of regular, injury free strength training. Take it slow folks and build that core!

I hope that Anthony Diluglio keeps making workout DVDs. I will buy them every time over any other workout DVD out there. They might be a little pricey but it is worth every penny if you are willing to invest your time in improving your physical fitness and your body in general.",1368489600,2,4186,4.525759577278732
2423538,5,B000BLEAKO,"This is a great DVD to work along with. I would say it is intermediate level, I was in good shape when I got it and I found it challenging as far as my aerobic conditioning. I almost gave out of breath a few times. The music is good, it's well produced, it's easy to follow and it's challenging. It follows a 2 minute exercise circuit with 1 minute of rest for 14 rounds and 1 bonus round. It's one of the best kettlebell DVD's I own but it's not for beginners that are out of shape.

I am having to work my way back to being able to to do this workout after a long lay off.

You will not be disapointed with this DVD!",1366156800,,1024,4.790960451977401
2423539,2,B000BLEAKO,"I have quite a few kettlebell DVDs and I was looking for a little something to spice up my workouts. This DVD was not it.
There is virtually no instruction provided and let's say the instructor will not win a prize for being personable. A timer is provided and that's probably the best thing I can say for this DVD. If all you are looking for is watch some guy doing a kettlebell routine in an outdoor setting (I not sure, the background does look kind of fake), then this is the workout for you. I could have gotten more from going to my local gym and watching people doing their kettlebell routines. The Iron Core series and the Skogg System are far superior in my opinion. And yes, I am definitely returning this DVD!",1329609600,2,720,4.340740740740741
2423540,5,B000BLEAKO,"This is my first kettlebell DVD, so I can't compare it to similar workouts.  But I do workout on a regular basis and wanted to try something a little different.  I really like it and plan to get the other Art of Strength DVDs as well.  Anthony is great.  He has a no nonsence approach and explains everything well.  I'm not into workouts where the instructor is really happy and smily and joking all the time, so this was perfect.  He also suggests what weight to start with, which is very helpful since I wasn't quite sure.

It's similar to any other weight lifting program, in that different exercises require different weights.  If you are buying a kettlebell for the first time, look for one that has a large space between the handle and the weight itself.  Since you are going to be passing it from hand to hand, it helps to have a lot of room in there.  Otherwise your hands will be banging into each other.  Not really a problem with the heavier weights, but it is with the lighter ones.  The first time I did the workout, I used a 10 pound kettlebell and there wasn't enough room in there to do the exercises quite right.  The 20 pounder was much better.",1323388800,,1162,4.348837209302325
2423541,5,B000BLEAKO,"This is the second kettlebell DVD that I have purchased in the past month. I always watch the DVDS first without doing the exercise just so I know what to expect. I think it's a great DVD and it makes you work hard. The other beginner DVDS are good, but I didn't feel like we utilized the kettlebell to it's advantages. This DVD makes you use the kettlebell the way it was intended and I feel the workout after I'm done. I would recommend this to beginners and everyone else. I think this should be the first kettlebell DVD you buy as an introduction. One thing about Anthony the trainer he's not super peppy and bouncy. I like that. I hate the ""you can do it!!"" types and just want to work out. He explains the move and gets right down to business. The other DVD that I have I found myself yelling at the trainer to hurry the heck up and stop explaining after a few viewings. Also I was really surprised that this came with a digital copy I didn't read it in the product review so I was pleasantly surprised to get a disc. I was intially annoyed by how expensive this is, but a digital copy makes me feel a little better. In short I think everyone who needs an introduction to kettlebells should purchase this asap. I've lost 7 pounds in a month by adding kettlebells to my walking schedule so I really do belive in them. Also, I am considered obese, but I was able to do this work out. Sometimes I would have to take extra breaks, but I think that's fine as long as you keep doing it.",1313366400,3,1486,4.199300699300699
2423542,5,B000BLEAKO,"I was hooked after getting his Kettlebell Clinic series.  When I can't get to the gym, I reach for his DVDs.  There's variety in the exercises and they're timed in 2-3 minute rounds. The timer is shown on the screen and you can see where you are in a particular round.  He gives encouragement and you don't feel like you have to get the next DVD to NOT get your money's worth.  At times I've had to stop working out when life gets in the way and I reach for his DVDs to help me get back on track.  I've gone from 10lb KBs to using 25lb KBs.

I bought that Jillian Michaels KB DVD and after trying one of the workouts, haven't gone back to it.  If you want a REAL workout, get this series.  If you want deeper instruction, get his Kettlebell Clinic series.",1308441600,2,755,4.123287671232877
2423543,4,B000BLEAKO,"Very good workout, even if you are not familiar with kettlebells. Still, it is challenging enough to give you good sore muscles and if you are able to actually follow along all the way, you are in excellent shape! Anyway, you can always change to heavier weights and the workout becomes more challenging.
You do not need any timer yourself, but can really just follow along. That's what makes it makes it so useful for me. I don't need any other gadgets to be able to start working out. Just two kettlebells (a light and a heavier one) me and the screen. That's it! No excuses anymore!",1307404800,,585,4.4766355140186915
2423544,5,B000BLEAKO,"I would highly recommend this dvd if you are looking for a serious workout!!!  You should watch the video first to make sure you have the correct form and are comfortable with the exercises.

Guaranteed to see results if you do it 2-3 times a week!!",1297123200,2,370,4.426470588235294
2423545,5,B000BLEAKO,"I fell in love with AOS Newport which I consider the best ever kbell workout for advanced exercisers. Even though I knew Providence was more basic, I just had to try it. Yes, it's definitely easier, but it's fantastic in its own way. It consists of a huge variety of exercises at an intermediate level. It is by no means boring. The focus is on strength and because it's not complicated you can go as heavy as you can handle making it harder that way. (I'm female and used 15, 20 and 25 lbs). There are short rest periods after each round. I was going to do jumping jacks, but found I needed the recovery. The music is hip-hop oriented where you have the option to play the instrumental version or with vocals. You can even play it without music (you could play your own in the background). I think it fits the workout well though. (Newport has a similar style of music that I like even better). Anthony is super-pleasant and cues perfectly. Both DVDs are very well produced with excellent picture and sound quality, as well as great camera angles to be able to follow it without distraction. Both make me feel lean and strong and just blow me away. They are expensive, but worth every penny.",1294704000,4,1192,4.447488584474886
2423546,4,B000BLEAKO,"I've purchased A LOT of kettlebell, crossfit, and other workout dvd's.  Diluglio's instruction and workouts are by far the best.

You purchase ONE dvd and it features complete information (no ploys to make you buy other dvd's for ""missing"" valuable information or to get you to pay him more money).

Upon doing one of his DVD's you'll WANT to buy his others.  I just wish some weren't so expensive (which is why I give 4 stars).

Very well made and PROFESSIONALLY PRODUCED (not filmed in his living room with crappy sound quality...those of you that do this should be ashamed of yourselves for the amount of money you charge...at least make SOME effort).

I look forward to more from him!!!",1278115200,5,690,4.708333333333333
2423547,5,B000BLEAKO,"I think that The Art of Strength: Providence is very creative and well put together. I would also have to say...I think this DVD is geared more towards people that already know and understand some basic kettlebell exercises, and the proper way to execute them, without causing injury or a strained muscle. As a beginner, I would highly recommend getting the DVD Enter the Kettlebell with Pavel Tsatsouline first. Pavel Tsatsouline is the kettlebell guru and really knows his stuff. He teaches you clear, step by step instructions, on almost everything a beginner needs to know before starting your kettlebell work out. So if you're a beginner...Enter The Kettlebell is definitely a necessity to get down the right form and technique you will need, to properly execute the moves on the Providence DVD.

Also, don't get discouraged if you can't keep up with Anthony's pace at first. This is a very fast paced DVD that you will have to work yourself up to...so start with a pace that you feel most comfortable with...until you can build up your strength and endurance level. Another note I might add...if you have hard wood floors, make sure that you lay down a large carpet or padding in front of the tv or area you will be doing your kettlebell work out. I think that's common sense really...if you drop the kettlebell on a hard wood floor...I think we all know what the outcome of that would be.

The majority of the music in Providence is techno inspired...so if you don't like techno music, you might want to turn the volume down a tad and turn up the stereo with your favorite jams. I actually found the music very enjoyable and noticed that it modivated me to push myself harder during the circuit. All in all, I think The Art Of Strength: Providence is an awesome DVD and I would recommend it to any beginner / advance kettlebell enthusiast. One of the best circuit kettlebell dvds available on the market to date.

Anthony is entertaining! He gives us a dvd that you can watch over and over...and still be inspired and unbored.",1249603200,9,2033,4.673184357541899
2423548,5,B000BLEAKO,We have dozens of workout videos and this is definitely one of our favorites.  It goes by quickly and the 60 second breaks between exercises really help to recover and prepare mentally for the next challenge.

We do Art of Strength 2-3 times per week.,1249344000,3,398,4.197368421052632

I typically get bored of my routine workouts and I'm always looking for something new and exciting to get more interested in working out again. I was training on my own for a while, then changed to a ""boot camp"" style class, then to a personal trainer, then back to my own doing triathlon training, and eventually got bored again. I picked up this DVD and bought 2 kettlebells, 4kg and 8kg (I'm female, so this is the typical weight for starting, as recommended by Anthony). I can not say more good things about this DVD. I quickly noticed an increase in muscle tone, and my cardio endurance has dramatically increased. The best thing about this, is you can do it inside your home, and all you need is one or two kettlebells, nothing more. Anthony's DVD works out every muscle of the body, and is GREAT for core training and increasing both abdominal and back strength. The timer in the left side of screen helps to keep you motivated. The 1 minute breaks are just enough time to towel off the sweat and get a drink of water. The motivational music helps as well.

Because of the difficulties in finding a quality product such as the Providence DVD, my Kettlebell has sat on the floor waiting for me to work out how to use it effectively in a routine for three or four months.

The wait is over, now I have this DVD. It is one of the best produced and well thought out DVD's I have seen and has not only inspired me to get the Kettlebell off the floor but to also to purchase the Newport DVD as it will only be a matter of time now before I'll be up to the challenge of the next level.

It's a tough workout, with good coaching along the way.  Also, if someone is a kettlebell novice the instructional clips are great for showing how to complete each exercise.  I'll be honest at this point I can't make it through the whole workout without stopping for very short breaks.  My short term goal is to keep up with the instructor's pace non-stop, and my long term goal is to move up to a larger kettlebell.  If you want a video that will truly help you get more fit this is it.

I'm not a fan of the music on the video, but that's a very minor point, and you can shut off the music if you don't like it.",1178928000,8,751,4.137931034482759

It does not feel like I am following a video, but rather I feel like I am working out alongside someone.
I had gone a few months without any real exercises due to a busy schedule, and have lost muscle mass and gained fat.  After just a few times through the video, I can already see results.
My husband, a person who has never used kettlebells, has found this video to be helpful as well and has also seen fast results.

I would recommend this for anyone who is limited on time and wants the most out of their workout.  I am looking forward to the next videos as I gain strength.",1466467200,2,1097,4.396039603960396

8088591,5,B000BLEAKO,"This is an amazing , challenging and super fun Kettlebell  video. I love Lauren Brooks and Paul katamis videos as well. This one was a surprise. I loved the kettlebell flips and swings around the body that Ive never done before. I did not expect to like this so much. I am going to be sore tomorrow! The bonus at the end is another treat that gets your heart rate up and is fun. can't say enough about this.",1456531200,4,407,4.151898734177215

8088594,4,B000BLEAKO,"The Art of Strength is a nice, straight-forward, no-nonsense kettlebell workout for beginners on to advanced simply based on the intensity you put forth in the workout. One of the great features of this DVD workout is the single-kettlebell routine. Where most kettlebell workouts are based around using two kettlebells at once; The Art of Strength allows you to use one kettlebell for the entire workout routine.

Pros:
*Great Beginner Workout
*Single KettleBell Workout
*Professionally Done/Good Instruction
*Exercise Timer on Screen

Cons:
Single Workout (Not a Multi-Workout/Program)
Dull/Straight-Forward Music/Routine

In closing; I would recommend The Art of Strength to anyone looking for a professionally done beginner to advanced kettlebell routine at a good price in comparison to most kettlebell DVD's.",1454803200,5,813,5.758333333333334
8088595,5,B000BLEAKO,"This is my go-to workout when I feel out of shape! It is great for beginners (which I was when I purchased this dvd years ago). You can do more or less, with lighter or heavier weight depending on your fitness level. It will get your heart pumping and you'll break a good sweat. As a mom of three young kids, this kettle bell workout is the most effective way I've found to get a good workout!",1453507200,,393,4.116883116883117
