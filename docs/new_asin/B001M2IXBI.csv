8320364,5,B001M2IXBI,"This DVD lesson is exceptional in many ways. There are only a few instructional DVDs out there that teach the style of Chet Atkins, and those that do tend to teach only public domain music. Presumably this is to avoid the hassle of sorting out all the legal paperwork involved with copyright issues and the like. Not so this DVD produced by Stefan Grossman's Guitar Workshop. It contains some of Chet's best known classics (Hidden Charm; Mystery Train; You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To; St. Louis Blues; Oh By Jingo; Chinatown, My Chinatown).

Pat Kirtley is a fantastic guitar player who won the National Fingerstyle Guitar Championship in the Walnut Valley Festival competition in 1995. He has been a longtime endorser of Taylor Guitars, so he uses a Taylor T 5 for this DVD. A Gretsch Country Gentleman or some other Chet Atkins model made by Gretsch might have been more appropriate for this purpose, especially since the Taylor T 5 lacks a Bigsby-tailpiece which, however, is essential to the sound of many of Chet's early hits.

Pat Kirtley really mastered the style of Chet Atkins. He presents a wealth of information on how to produce the sound that Chet got. Each song is being taught according to the same pattern: First, there is a full-fledged performance version of the tune (sometimes at breathtaking speed), then Kirtley goes step by step through the arrangement explaining what to look out for. Lastly, there is a split-screen version of each tune where he plays the arrangement in slow speed. It has to be noted, however, that Kirtley took a little liberty with the arrangements. Those are not note-for-note transcriptions of what Chet actually played. Occasionally, Kirtley somewhat simplified the arrangements, perhaps to make them more accessable to us regular guitar players. But in no way are those dumbed-down versions, quite on the contrary. Some tunes were recorded as duets between Chet and Jerry Reed (Mystery Train) or Lenny Breau, the great Canadian Jazz virtuoso (You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To), so Kirtley had to modify them considerably in order to make them stand-alone guitar pieces. St. Louis Blues was recorded two different times by Chet, in 1953 and 1955 respectively. Kirtley kind of blended the two versions together.

The DVD comes with a very accurate booklet that contains all the tabs for the split-screen versions.

This DVD - together with its companion Vol. 2 - will be an invaluable tool for anyone who wants to delve into the style of Chet Atkins and will give the motivated student material to work on for months (or even years).",1369958400,,2582,4.874715261958998
