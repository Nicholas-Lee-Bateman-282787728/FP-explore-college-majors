5057820,1,B0076OF77Y,"This is a very basic DVD: basic obedience, force fetching, intro to ecollar,steadyiness, intro to boat,upland hunting, trailing.

I expected material aimed at intermediate level hunt tests: lining and casting drills, walking baseball, multiple marking concepts, delayed triple, cheating singles, angle entry concepts, no-no drill, swimb-by, wagon wheel drill, retired guns, etc. None of theses intermediate concepts are on this DVD!

If you search youtube for focrce-fetch you would get about 60 percent of the material that is on this dvd.

I was very dissapointed that only the very basic concepts were covered in this DVD.",1353974400,3,625,5.489583333333333

8511079,5,B0076OF77Y,"Very helpful in training a gun dog. Great techniques. Though i figure he would of put the table in the first video of the series. He pulled the 12 week old puppy out in this one and worked her on table, should of been in first video. I feel he should of offered more information on when and how he disciplins. If someone post later he squeezes the ear. That is used on working the dogs fetching and holding or bighting to hard. Other then that I believe in this process.",1450137600,,470,4.175824175824176

8511085,5,B0076OF77Y,"We started off with the Tom Dokken Puppy Training DVD.  This DVD is a perfect next step and focuses on the finer details of e-collar and force fetch training.

The DVD takes you step-by-step through everything you need to do to get your dog force fetch trained.

I would like to point out that another reviewer did not agree.

The title of the DVD is 'Intermediate' and not 'Advanced' or 'Master' retriever training.  If you are looking for a DVD to help you get ready for the AKC JH test, this is the one you want.

I am sure Tom Dokken is probably working on another video that would have casting and other skills needed for the higher level tests.  This one covers everything that's 'intermediate.'

One critique - the Puppy DVD in the series did not mention a training table at all, but this one referenced the training table and said it should have been in use from the beginning.  If you are going to be training a puppy, I suggest you get the puppy DVD AND this one and watch them both from start to finish before you begin in earnest so that you see how all the different skills interrelate.  You will see the importance of pressure on/pressure off in the long run, as well as the training table.

All in all, a great video!  We took our 10 month old Lab on a Pheasant shoot and he successfully retrieved every bird we sent him to fetch.",1362355200,4,1345,4.336
