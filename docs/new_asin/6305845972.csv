7897345,3,6305845972,"Writer Luke Sinclair has made a career on writing grisly serial killer novels.  He also has a drinking problem and is currently experiencing a severe case of writer's block.  He's been on the wagon for almost five years, but he's losing his control, and he's not taking his medicine...Luke goes off to a Maine hideaway to see if he can find the knack again.  Lo and behold, he's no sooner there than dead bodies start piling up.  The crime scene also has a page torn from his latest book, REAPER.  The local sheriff and the assisting detective from Maine State Police start to wonder if Sinclair isn't making art imitate life.

The movie throws us several red herrings and several suspects, in addition to Sinclair.  What is it with the gruff local sheriff that makes him seem so suspicious?  And what about the telephone repairman?  Why does he pick up a lovely hitchhiker and then run from the cops?  What about the nerdy deputy who picks his nose?  The writers serve up a spicy plot, and the killer's identity is pretty surprising, but the clues are there.

Chris Sarandon as Sinclair seems to be sleepwalking through his role; whether this is intentional or just that he was bored, one can't tell; Catherine Mary Stewart does well as Sonya, the detective, and Vlasta Vrana as the sheriff is effectively creepy.

The main problem with the movie is it isn't suspenseful enough; we don't really get to see the crimes being committed, and the leisurely pace distracts from giving us chills.

A clever thriller, but not with many thrills.",1094774400,3,1537,4.707865168539326
7897346,4,6305845972,this was a fairly gripping psychological thriller with decent plot twists and stylish direction. I could not figure out who was the killer at the end so I give it high marks for that alone.,963792000,3,189,4.428571428571429
