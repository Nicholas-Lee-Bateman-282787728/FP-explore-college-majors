4829079,5,B004W7D4PA,What a wonderful way to end the series and bring back up my opinion after the eternal 8.  I loved the series and basically would say your feelings for the series high points will be the same for the movie.,1496707200,2,205,4.125
4829080,5,B004W7D4PA,An amazing movie to round out the series. Still holding out hope there will be a Season 3!,1496275200,3,90,4.055555555555555
4829081,5,B004W7D4PA,"The movie itself is a 5/5 for me. After 8 years and watching the movie maybe 4-5 times, this movie still holds up. The animation, the plot, the production, the soundtrack, the characters...are all incredible if you've invested time in the anime and come to like the cast. The movie looks fantastic in blu-ray; and the 5.1 Japanese/English audio is fantastic. Never in my life did I think that I would get to listen to iconic theme opening ""Bouken Desho Desho?"" in 5.1 surround. The English dub also does a solid job; I can watch the movie in either language since the English cast did such a good job.

As far as the actual product goes, the movie comes with some nice postcards and a reversible cover.

If I have to give any negatives, it would be with the way Funimation handles the subtitles and extras (of course). I currently can't find a way to turn off the subtitles; in the Setup section in the menu, there's no option to turn them on or off. I also can't turn them off through my blu-ray player's settings either. And the only extras are trailers for Funimation shows. And there's no way to select them as separate videos since they're all lumped in the Trailers portion of the menu. You would have to manually skip to watch the next trailer. I was hoping for at least a Clean Opening, but nope.

Overall, I'm glad to FINALLY have this movie in my collection since I missed out on the original Bandai release.",1496188800,,1418,4.467181467181467
4829082,5,B004W7D4PA,hands down the best anime movie out at the moment ..It is however important to watch both seasons first or you will be lost,1496102400,5,123,4.166666666666667
4829083,5,B004W7D4PA,"One of the best (if not the best) anime movies of all time. It's a lot more serious than the series but brings up things from the previous episodes to make you go ""Ah!!!""
Kyoto animation is one of the best in the business when it comes to directing and cinematography. You can clearly see this in The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. The directors directed Hyouka and Sound Euphonium, so if you liked either of those two you should enjoy this movie.

 I'm so happy they decided to make a re-release because I've been wanting a copy of my own for a very long time  now.",1504310400,2,569,4.349056603773585

8478137,5,B004W7D4PA,"Such an amazing ending to the series and a great bridge for me to watch the new one! I absolutely love the character development in this. I hadn't watched The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya anime since I was younger, and then chose to pick the series up again as an adult. I found out that they added more episodes as well as this movies and a spin-off series! I've rewatched and caught up in less than a month and I can't wait to watch the new series about Nagato. This movie is so great, I wish I had bought the DvD instead of renting it online.",1529193600,,546,4.160377358490566

8478141,5,B004W7D4PA,"If you enjoyed the series, then you'll love the movie. The writing was done very well, and the voice acting was great. The comedy that was put in this was just enough to break up the drama without being too much. Any time an animated movie can stir strong up emotions it is an exceptional thing.",1518480000,,295,4.285714285714286
