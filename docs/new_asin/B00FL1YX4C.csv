8616590,5,B00FL1YX4C,The year now is 2016.  I just watched Wild Boys of the Road.  Wow.......It was made in 1933 and I was so drawn into this movie.  It was not just a movie but history that's been forgotten.  I had no idea how bad it was for the kids in those days.  This was the first time I saw the actor Frankie Darro.  I just loved him.  I became an instant fan and had to do all kinds of searches on him just to find out about his life.  This is definitely a movie to see.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  Especially if your interested in the depression years in America.,1459123200,2,562,3.981981981981982
8616591,5,B00FL1YX4C,"I have always been particularly fascinated by The Great Depression, chiefly because my parents were married August 1, 1941, just 4 months before the attack on Pearl Harbor. This means they were nearing adulthood during the darkest years of The Depression, ca. 1933. My father spoke of it often when I was a teenager in the mid 1970's, and even with the 40+ years passage, there was always a sadness in his voice when he recalled it.
I had heard of Wild Boys of The Road for years, but somehow never got a chance to see it until 3 nights ago. It is absolutely superb. It captures with great artistry the fight of children and teenagers to survive life on the road, having left home because each feels that he is one too many mouths to feed, their parents all having lost their jobs, and now unable to even feed their children. If this sounds heartbreaking, it most certainly is. The children are treated worse than sewer rats by police and railroad security who want them to ""just go away"" Problem is, there are now hundreds of thousands of boys and girls riding the rails, desperate for work and in danger of starvation or becoming critically ill from exposure to the elements. But they band together and help one another in a way that is very moving. They live by a code of almost frontier justice. The pain of any one becomes the pain of all. A young train hopping girl is raped by a brakeman and when the group discover it, they beat him to death. Much has been said about the ending being a cop out. I do not agree; the film is so sad, so unjust in places, that there had to be SOME kind of hope at then end. Don't miss this film.",1446595200,3,1634,4.3257328990228014
8616592,5,B00FL1YX4C,Thank you to bring this hard to find movie on DVD and the quality is very brilliant. A very good movie of director William A. Wellman The movie has few funny scenes and very dramatic and sad. But in the end there is hope for Eddie and his friends.,1420502400,,247,4.061224489795919
8616593,3,B00FL1YX4C,"I knew prior to viewing that this was produced as a ""social conciousness"" film, with the intent of educating the public regarding the danger of jumping onto and off of fast moving trains. It really missed this mark. The resolution was unrealistic given the reason they were riding the rails to begin with. Jobs were nonexistent.",1415836800,,328,4.875
8616594,5,B00FL1YX4C,"William Wellmans movie gives a formidable impression of the human dramas provoked by the economic depression in the 1930s.
Fathers lose their job. Families cannot feed their children anymore: our folks are poor. They cant get jobs and there is not enough to eat.
Children leave the family house for the road (freight trains) looking for a glimmer of hope: a job. They survive through panhandling and petty theft. They are continuously harassed by the police for they are considered as enemies of society by those who have money or who still have a job. One of the main characters of the movie translates the grim mentality against the outcasts perfectly: You send us to jail, because you don't want to see us.
Of course, to create a happy end, ONE of the millions on welfare or on the road finds a job. But, can he find the money to by the uniform he needs? So, no happy end?

William H. Wellman shot one of the best US movies ever made (The Ox-Bow Incident). His themes are a far cry from the star and other wars of today with their apologies of pure violence for the sole purpose of domination. His movies excel through their realism, their human psychology and, like here, through their social relevance (the naked struggle for survival of the have-nots in a world dominated by the haves).
A must see.",1399939200,2,1304,4.572649572649572
