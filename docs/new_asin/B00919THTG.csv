5240940,5,B00919THTG,I love this show! It brings back so many memories from when I was a kid. Me & my friends used to watch it all the time. I hope they release it soon to dvd because I will definitely buy the whole series. Does anyone know when it will be released?,1374105600,,245,3.823529411764706
5240941,5,B00919THTG,"I just want to say that I'm reviewing the episodes, and do not own this on DVD but have them on itunes. I loved this show as a kid and would I love to have these volumes on DVD. Does anyone have any idea when they will be released on DVD?? I'm still waiting. It says you can preorder but there is no release date or anything.",1369958400,4,325,3.8656716417910446
5240942,2,B00919THTG,"Like Mark, i did not see the pre-order disclaimer when i ordered this DVD in November 2012 as a Christmas gift for my daughter. Now a ambiguous disclaimer is posted with the product. Even with the disclaimer, I do not have a clue when the product will be available. While I have a few dissapointments using Amazon, it has been with the providers. This is the first time it has been Amazon directly that has not come through. While not a Christmas gift, maybe it will arrive before her birthday.",1358035200,5,494,4.5
5240943,1,B00919THTG,"This product isn't released yet, so I don't understand the other two five-star reviews.  I've got it on order, but Amazon has no idea when it'll be able to fill the order.  I verified this with Amazon via phone.  I could've sworn that when I ordered it that I did not see all of the pre-order and not available lines, but maybe it was my error.  Anyways, the ordering screen still told me I'd have it in a week.  Anyways, if I ever get this, I'll come back and re-update the review.

As a side note, although I am dissapointed, kudos to the Amazon service team who is very prompt.",1355097600,8,580,4.2272727272727275
5240954,4,B00919THTG,"I can't get this DVD a full five star review like I wanted to, not because of the show but because of the poor DVD quality. It looks as if they transferred it to DVD straight from VHS. Now I understand that the show was originally recorded to video and not film, and is not in HD but they could have at least enhanced the image a little bit. It's as if Nickelodeon doesn't realize what they really have with all these old shows!

  This DVD is actually coming from Nickelodeon so I don't think you will be able to find a better quality DVD but for all it's worth it's not that bad. it's still watchable and I still highly recommend this DVD.

  I was having a sense of nostalgia and was getting really tired of all this new crap that's on TV currently. So, I bought all the seasons from all the old shows I used to watch on Nick, FOX, and ABC. So far Nick is the only one totally bias of it's past. It was still great seeing the show, it's not as scary watching it now as an adult though lol",1402876800,,991,4.030612244897959
5240955,5,B00919THTG,My grand children love this series. They also have season 2. Now we are awaiting the release of season 3. Great little show for them to watch.,1397692800,,142,4.296296296296297

5240957,5,B00919THTG,"Great!! Really liked it this show Brings me back to the early 90,'s when shows were good!! Love the show",1396483200,,104,4.25
5240958,5,B00919THTG,"I loved this show as a kid and this is the closest thing I can get to actually getting the seasons, which seem to be hard to come by, especially season 1. Many of the good episodes are included in this volume.",1395187200,,209,4.0
5240959,5,B00919THTG,I watched as a kid and I bought this and its just as great as I remember. Im now 25 and I can say this show still holds up today.,1394236800,,129,3.3333333333333335
5240960,5,B00919THTG,if you buy this you must know it skips from time period to time period telling tales that people have left and those same people are back in later episodes great series.,1394064000,,169,4.3125
5240961,5,B00919THTG,"My nephew asked for Goose Bumps DVD's for Christmas, but when looking for them, I stumbled across this, and was instantly transported back to wonderful childhood memories of watching these with my family.  I think my sister was more excited than my nephew when he first opened unwrapped this gift, but it was really great to watch this show with my family and get a whole new a generation hooked on the series.  Let's be real, though; anyone who grew up with this doesn't need to read this review to know that this is a must own!",1393804800,4,529,4.443298969072165

5240963,5,B00919THTG,I love Are you afraid of the Dark and now I can get it with just my favorite stories on it.,1392595200,,91,3.380952380952381
5240964,3,B00919THTG,"I understand that this is not a factory/studio release of the show and that Amazon makes them on demand when you order them but who ever handled the discs before placing them into the dvd box got their finger prints on the back of the discs. They were also a little scratched

The DVD-R discs Amazon made did play but the picture quality was a little grainy. Some of my old Sony Are Your Afraid Of The Dark  VHS tapes from the 90s have better picture quality.  Unlike normal Tv show box sets  that show you a copyright Warning once before you play each disc these dvds drag the process out by playing UNSKIPABLE 11 seconds long Copyright logos before  EVERY SINGLE EPISODE when you click on them.

The show itself I love but the way Nickelodeon has chosen to release them in the US is a bit of a let down.
 Canada gave the fans of this show what they wanted back in 2007 by releasing them by Seasons not just a bunch of random ""Best Of"" Volume set !? Sadly it costs an arm and a leg to import those dvds box sets from Canada. Some seller  was trying to sell the first season for $2,500.00 a few weeks ago her on Amazon. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it listed for Two Thousand Five Hundred dollars. Seller prices for this show are way Scarier than the show itself lol",1391040000,2,1275,4.19672131147541
5240965,4,B00919THTG,Love this show so much as a kid and have to say it's still actually very good. Great collection of episodes even if they are from all kinds of seasons but it's the best you are gonna get unless you want to shell out mega bucks for those other ones which I'm not willing to do just for DVD's. It's amazon's burn on demand thing but that's fine because at least I can watch these when I want. Packaging also not too bad but it is the bare minimum. Here's hoping that Vol. 2 will be released someday because at the moment I don't think they are going to release it anytime soon even with me contacting them about it. Must buy if you love the show and need a fix.,1390348800,,659,4.038167938931298
5240966,2,B00919THTG,There is absolutely nothing wrong with this series. It is exactly as it was on tv years ago. Just not nearly as good as I thought it was when I was a kid. Some things are better left as good memories.,1389916800,,200,3.902439024390244
5240967,5,B00919THTG,"I wish this series was sold by season, but they did choose some of the best episodes.  Kids love it, not too scary.",1389571200,,115,4.0
5240968,5,B00919THTG,"My daughter (12) and son (5) loved the DVD's.
Have season two on order, can't wait to get them!
We recommend to anyone. Good clean scares.",1387238400,,138,4.346153846153846
5240969,5,B00919THTG,"Hey Its Sunnydale Chick here, I decided to watch some of my favorite ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK episodes today to still Celebrate Halloween and me and my guy getting married (Halloween is our anniversary AND we Just Have to celebrate for more then one day as you know) And I had SO much fun watching these....(and I was also celebrating this last night. I had JUST found out that these were on DVD. (This show came out when I was 16.....and was one my FAVORITE shows on SNICK. And I had SO many FAVORITE episodes, I just thought I'd say which ones and why; my FAVORITE one is the Tale Of The Unfinished Painting. I loved that one since it 1st came out, I just think it's So interesting.....with the Paintings and the background stories that went with them. My guy is even painting me our FAVORITE painting The one that Cody paints. The Prom Queen. Now what's cool with this one.....is I had written my own version (I like writing Urban Legends) in the middle of October, my guy liked THAT story so much, he even got me my ghostly Hitchiker Living Dead doll....and THEN we had A lot of fun watching the episode. The Tale of The Many Faces. One of the 1st things I liked about THIS story is the Main Spree Sweater girl is nice like Buffy would be, and the other girl's a lot like Willow (even looks similar. And I like the idea of that cool powder that's supposed to start the spell (the compact is SO pretty.) The spellbook looks like a pretty purple journal (once it's empty) The Villian has been taken down, the girls are free...and other main girls get to be on magazine covers. The 13th floor. I've ALWAYS loved this one, I mean 1st off Its so wonderfully weird! And I LOVED the 13th floor even before it's the Toy factory/space ship....cause its just a cool warehouse. And the aliens only have one mission; to rescue their daughter. The daughter didn't remember enough in time.....and was going to be rescued in 10 years, but I like 2 wonder....since she knows now.....what happens? I dig that sort of thing! I like linking The Super Specs ep with this (cause the aliens and the people from the other dimension looked similar. But 1st the intro, that is A COOL magic shop with A COOL magic trick (you know the one that chops your finger off, that I would LOVE to scare someone with! Then of course; there's the Super Specs.....Now I've never even bought the fake X-Ray specks....But if they were Like This.....I would......it's just 2 cool! And I like how the alternate dimension wins...it reminds me of Normal Again and The Wish or Dopplegangland from Buffy! Then there's the Tale Of The Pinball Wizard. Now the Pinball game within itself....is REALLY cool, and looks REALLY fun! Then it's even more cool when it's like Mystical Live action version where he's in the machine forever. I like that ending as well....then there's my last one I'm talking about, The Tale of The Dollmaker. 1st....on a FUNNY note (the lady who's playing the....CANNOT act. In fact, her performance is rather odd; 1st......she's being WAY overdramatic (I thought this was funny when I 1st saw the episode) then I noticed something new today......when she's talking about Susan, she's looking off to the side like she's reading it off a cue card (which she PROBABLY is, I mean she's Really awful!) I LOVE the plot though! It's SO COOL! The SFX makeup looked SO COOL in fact I wished the 2 girls would've turned INTO dolls.....but that's just me, also the only complaint I've EVER had besides that ladies HORRIBLE acting was that they burned down the dollhouse, I mean COME ON! They didn't do that in my FAVORITE episode of Tales from The Darkside about the dollhouse, and in The Shining remake The Overlook was set to be rebuilt, so in MY version that's what happens, they're turned into dolls for several generations.......But that's a whole other story......",1384128000,,3841,4.592430858806405
5240970,3,B00919THTG,"This release marks the first time that Are You Afraid of the Dark? has been released in the United States on DVD. It's nice to finally have some of this show available, cheaply, for consumers. The original Canadian releases have gone out of print and tend to sell for hundreds of dollars. The show is currently being re-released in Canada, season by season, for a much better price.

 If you're looking for any sort of continuity with the show, this set is not for you. With episodes pulled from various seasons of the show, this ""Volume"" set hand picks favorites for a ""Best Of"" sampling of the show. While you might get great episodes, the jumping time experienced by The Midnight Society within the show is extremely confusing for people unfamiliar with the show.

To sum up the set, if you are an avid fan of this show, you might want to invest the extra money for the Canadian sets (Which are Region 1, so they will play on your DVD/Blu-ray player). If you are just looking to re-experience the show in some small respect, this might be the set for you.

The show is incredible and it's frankly surprising it has taken this long for a DVD release. It's just unfortunate that such a release is far from perfect. Let's just pray that all three episodes of The Tale of the Silver Sight are put onto one disc and not spread across three sets.",1383696000,7,1343,4.469387755102041
5240971,5,B00919THTG,"I was so excited when this came out since I haven't seen the show since after it aired in the 90s. For anyone who has not seen it, it's like a kids version (still pretty entertaining for an adult too) of Tales From the Crypt or even the Twilight Zone. I was only disappointed in the fact that there is no episode list with the dvds or displayed as part of the product description, so here is a list for all you wondering what episodes it contains:

1) The Tale of Laughing in the Dark
2) The Tale of the Lonely Ghost
3) The Tale of the Midnight Madness
4) The Tale of the Midnight Ride
5) The Tale of the Quicksilver
6) The Tale of the Dream Girl
7) The Tale of the Dead Man's Float
8) The Tale of the Twisted Claw
9) The Tale of the Hatching
10) The Tale of the Nightly Neighbors
11) The Tale of the 13th Floor
12) The Tale of Old Man Corcoran
13) The Tale of the Doll Maker
14) The Tale of Night Shift",1383436800,33,903,3.907608695652174
5240972,1,B00919THTG,"I know a lot of you are excited to see this on DVD and giving it 5 stars for the show. I would too. Except I'm rating the release format, not the show, which is why I'm giving it 1 star.

It is disappointing that this isn't a complete season and instead just a volume or collection of episodes. Its even more disappointing that this release is a burnt DVD-R and not a factory pressed disc.

The good news is there is an official season 1 - 7 factory pressed collection that was released in Canada. Unfortunately the original run is out of print and the prices can be ridicules.

However, they have re-released seasons 1 & 2 this year (2013) at an affordable price. Perhaps if sales are good enough they'll continue to re-release the rest of the official season collections.

So why not pick up the complete seasons 1 & 2 from the Canadian Amazon.ca while you still can? Canada & the US are both DVD Region 1 so you won't have any issues with video playback.",1382054400,56,957,4.329608938547486

8533934,5,B00919THTG,"I used to watch these after school everyday up until they got the new younger Midnight Society. I love these shows and I knew my step kids would like them too so I bought this one, volume 1. The kids ended up loving these episodes as much as I did and still do and now I'm debating on which next one to buy because the kids want to see more!

My favorite episodes are:
Laughing in the dark (still my favorite creepy clown story)
The lonely ghost (still creeps out my 13 year old)
Quicksilver
Dream girl (almost has a 50's feel to it)
Dead man's float
Old man corcoran
The dollmaker
Twisted claw (the old ladies cackle is creepy)
Night shift

Worst:
The 13th floor
Nightly neighbors
The hatching
Midnight madness
Midnight ride

It doesn't tell you on the CDs which episodes are on what discs so what we did was take a piece of paper and go through each disc and write down the episodes in order and stuck it in the DVD case so we didn't have to go through each CD to see which ones we wanted to watch.",1468022400,,1000,4.170984455958549
