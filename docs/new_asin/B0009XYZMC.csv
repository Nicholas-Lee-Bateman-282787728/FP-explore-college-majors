8070134,5,B0009XYZMC,This is a great workout tape set.  Not to complex and gets results.,1454112000,,67,4.153846153846154
8070135,5,B0009XYZMC,I had this routine in the past.  I know that it works!,1428796800,,54,3.5
8070136,5,B0009XYZMC,"I got this video because I'm attempting to collect most of the videos shot in the elaborate studio as they are the best of the FIRM videos.  I thought Susan Harris in #1 was a beast...Janet Jones is a MONSTER!  The floor exercises will work your arms like you won't believe (I couldn't finish all the reps with the poundage used in the video).  While it's really difficult to finish, you know you're gonna get the body you're after with this and all the other ""original"" FIRMs.  Her breathy voice is not annoying at all, and for the most part, the times that she did not cue were after she already did a set of the exercise already and she's just doing it again.  In my opinion, the floor routine is harder than Susan's in #1, but it's still really good.  If you want to get in shape and FAST, get this video!",1301616000,,809,4.254901960784314
8070137,5,B0009XYZMC,"Of course one of the best workouts ever made is also available on good old fashioned VHS.The classic Firm workouts volumes 1 through 6 are some of the best workouts of the 80 or the best workouts to come out in history. And Low Impact aerobics with Janet Jones Gretzky is my favorite workout in the collection,along with Volume 1 with Susan Harris which stresses weight training sides of aerobics and the classic Volume 3 with Sandahl Bergmann which is aerobic interval training,Volume 2 with Janet Jones Gretzky stresses aerobics,but all the classic Firm videos,including Firms Parts and the Firm Cross Trainers are aerobic in themselves but along with the weight training that cuts your workout time in half. Aerobics burns fat and weight training builds lean looks and raises your metabolism. All you woman out there who are thinking you are going to build big muscles and not look right,you are thinking wrong weight aerobic The Firm training method this method is something that you need to incorporate into your workout plan and that goes for you men out there out there as well,whatever you might think about working out but the Firm is Great for both men and woman giving them a great body. Of course you can incorporate it with your other activities that you love to do,but you can not just keep on doing nothing but Yoga and Pilates and nothing else,don`t get me wrong Pilates and Yoga are great to include in your fitness program,like I incorporate the two in my heavy duty training program but you can not just be doing Pilates and Yoga with nothing else it does not give you the heart healthy cardio fitness and the proper weight training used in this time saving program. Now of course you people out there who love the dancing aerobic workout classes are a great thing to do,but it is not the only thing you can do over and over again it does not create enough muscle confusion changing the weight poundage and routines and dancing with eight fails because just one size weight is used and you need different size weights to work all the different muscles in your body. Hands down The Firm Volume 2 Aerobic workout with weights is a must have if you want serious smart changes in your body. You need Vigorous aerobic and weight training workouts nothing else works. Janet Jones leads you through a great 65 minute aerobic weight training workout. Which includes a great towel strtch at the end of it. So buy it because you are missing out. Nothing else can give these results.",1287619200,,2491,4.676537585421412
8070138,5,B0009XYZMC,"I have been using this tape on and off since 1988.  It's a gentle tape but delivers results and you WILL work up a sweat.  My chiropractor suggested it as one of the best exercise videos he had seen at that point for the right amount of aerobics, weight training and correct posture during exercises.  He also said that it was nice to see that there wasn't a lot of harsh jumping around, pounding, flinging or swinging which was the case for a lot of videos back in the 80s.  [He was talking about THIS 2nd in the series tape only]  Every time I go back to this Tape and the Original one, and work between the two combined with the Hips, Buns, and Thighs Tape, I get results.  Yes, there is a ""break-in"" period where you absolutely shouldn't use weights [just like the tapes TELL you], but you work your way up gradually.  I always get nice results with firm tapes.  Persistence overcomes resistance.",1284076800,,900,4.412121212121212

- Like the Jayne Poteet video, this is one of my favorites. It uses a great variety and combination of exercises, and the pacing is fast. Some aerobic parts make you feel like you're dancing. This video has more variety in the routine than the other Firm classics.

- It is by far the hardest of the Firm classics I've tried--it'll give you an excellent cardio workout. The first time I tried it, I'd already been working out with four other Firm videos, but I still couldn't use the same poundage I was using for the others. I had to go lighter to finish the video.

CONs

- I don't mean to be petty here, but her breathy voice and flirty manner were initially quite distracting. And sometimes, she seems lost in the exercise and she stops cueing/counting the reps. Then all of a sudden, the set is over. You'll notice especially during the floor exercises.",1141689600,6,864,4.484076433121019
