776116,5,6303954359,"Obviously influncened by Heidegger's notion of original temportality, and, if not, the writer was simply brilliant!
Q's whisper in Picard's ear at the end tips it - the call of conscience, also the notion of bringing past,  present and future to bear in the present.
Quite simply a masterpiece -  perhaps the best television show I have ever seen.",945820800,6,347,4.864406779661017
776255,5,6303954359,"This is the last episode of season 7 and the Star Trek: The Next Generation series.  In this episode Captain Picard finds out that all of humanity will be wiped out and he has to figure out how and why and find a way to stop it from happening.  Picard time shifts from the past, present and future to get the clues he needs to solve the mystery of an anomaly that is found in the Romulan Neutral Zone.  The last scene is really touching because Captain Picard joins his crew in playing poker and regrets not doing it sooner.  The special features are: audio commentary by Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga, making of featurette, deleted scenes and promos for each episode.  This is a good addition to the Star Trek: The Next Generation collection.",1462838400,2,747,4.463235294117647

776328,4,6303954359,"I love Star Trek. I wish I could watch an episode of the original series, The Next Generation, or Enterprise every single day of my life. However, my wife hates the entire franchise. Im forced to catch a movie or episode any time shes at least a thousand feet from the house and cant hear the theme music or the voices of the actors.

CBS Blu-ray makes it easy on folks looking for the brighter spots by putting out the most important and popular two-part episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation flawlessly seamed together into feature length films. They remind me of the key adventures I need to re-visit on a regular basis. In celebration of the release of the seventh and final season, we get the series epic swan song All Good Things.

Past, present and future collide for Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) as he finds himself bouncing around through three different time periods -- the Farpoint mission, the present, and the future in which many changes have affected the Enterprise-D crew. Meanwhile, the mischievous Q (John de Lancie) is back for his last time trying to help Picard figure out the meaning of a spatial anomaly... or is he only making things worse?

One section of the combined episode is reminiscent of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. The aged crew must come together and follow their former Captain on an unauthorized mission to save the entire universe. It also gives everyone a chance to see what the crew is up to and will look like as they grow older. Of course, things can change if the timeline is screwed with.

The only part of Star Trek: The Next Generation  All Good Things I had an issue with is its nods to evolution. Q takes Picard to the area where France will be billions of years in the past and shows him a puddle of primordial ooze well form from. Any Creationist is going to have an issue with this sequence.

Special features for Star Trek: The Next Generation  All Good Things include audio commentary by Michael D. Moore and Brannon Braga, The Unknown Possibilities of Existence: Making All Good Things featurette, episodic promos (Parts 1 and 2), and deleted scenes.

Star Trek: The Next Generation  All Good Things ends the series with a cataclysmic danger to humanity which trumps anything the crew has ever faced. It brings the series full circle through picking up with the trial which began in the first episode of the show, Encounter at Farpoint. Q became such an iconic figure it only seems fitting that the series ends with a universal threat brought on by the godlike being and his judicial court.",1420675200,2,2561,4.648230088495575
776329,5,6303954359,"This Blu Ray is top quality production. The bonus features alone make All Good Things a buy. It makes a great addition to the Star Trek: The Next Generation season sets, or just as a movie on its own.

776399,5,6303954359,"""... All Good Things"" has never been my favorite Trek series ender.  I always felt DS9's ""What You Leave Behind"" and VOY's ""Endgame"" were far better series closers.  That said, rewatching this TNG closer in full HD has changed my mind.  I never wanted to go back and watch it on Netflix because the colors are so washed and the picture just always seemed muted somehow.  As with all other TNG Blus this HD transfer is phenomenal in both audio and picture.

The special features here are nice.  We get an audio commentary and a 30 minute documentary.  For me the documentaries are the perk of purchasing these standalone sets.  It's interesting to hear Ron Moore talk about how he and Brannon Braga wrote the script for ""...All Good Things"" while simultaneously writing finishing the script for 'Star Trek: Generations.'",1418083200,2,819,4.8

776403,5,6303954359,"If you love Star Trek The Next Generation as I have and got the series on high definition, you are going to want to get this final episode! I have had the complete series on DVD for years and to finally get it on Blu-ray is just wonderful. There is no comparison with the high definition transfers of these episodes and the standard DVD ones. The picture and sound are awesome and the way it should be! Sound is at least DTS HD 5.1. The detail in uniforms, and facial expressions are spot on, and outer space never looked so good! Trust me, ditch or sell those standard DVD compressed discs that were meant for analog TVs, and get the Hi Definition Blu-rays!

Captain Picard is on trial by Q, a character the Crew of the USS Enterprise encountered years before, for crimes in outer space. He travels back and forth through certain periods of time in his Starfleet days and his retirement. He must convince the crew of the USS Enterprise and his former Starfleet colleagues that something is making a ""tear"" in space and time, thus allowing him to travel back and forth without forewarning. In his retirement years, his former colleagues think he has some kind of mental sickness or syndrome. Picard must get the crews from all the timelines to converge in one spot in space and time to stop what could be the end for them all.

The Menu is great. I can't say enough about this edition. It's all good. Picture and sound are just outstanding! It's better than the original broadcast in my opinion. If you want to watch something before watching ""Generations"" or some of the other movies the NG were in, this is the episode. Well done!!!
The individual packaging is really nice! It is one long play episode. There is no ""hang time"" in between the seasons.",1416528000,15,1752,4.523659305993691

7860947,5,6303954359,"I had the DVD set and then finally pulled the trigger on the complete ST:TNG blu-ray box (AMAZING quality--made me love the show all over again and more deeply), so I never thought I'd want stand-alone ""movies"" like this one. Well, I got THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS for the extras, and that and the low prices on these made me order all the rest a day later!
I love em. And I love the full movie-like experience. And the quality of sound and visual is rich and satisfying. But even more than that, I love the care, joy, and info with which the makers have infused the extras! The docs are great and in old all cast members, which is rare even in some huge movies, and the commentary tracks, which I rarely get excited enough to even try, are so enveloping and informative, they give a deeper level of enjoyment. I can't believe these were made and with such care--so luckily they did so just before the bottom dropped out of the physical media industry.
These extras, if you didn't know, are NOT included on the season blu-rays or the complete box set. The makers were given more budget to do more (thankfully) when the studio decided to make these 2-part episodes available as stand-alone movies with the ep's edited together. .
For the price they've fallen to now, it's really an easy decision to get em. I'm so glad I did!",1503187200,3,1321,4.418032786885246
