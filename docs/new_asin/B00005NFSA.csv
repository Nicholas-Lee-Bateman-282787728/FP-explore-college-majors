7946832,4,B00005NFSA,"Well acted, especially by Jean Gabin as a lawyer in his 50s caught in an obviously disasterous love affair with a woman 30 or more years younger, as well as Edwige Feuilere as Gabins elegant and proud wife, pushed aside by his irrational obsession for the younger woman.  Plus theres no denying Bridget Bardots crazy sex appeal as the object of Gabins passion, although a more gifted actress might have made both the character and film deeper.

Gabin falls for his hot young client after she takes part in a bungled stick up, and carries on an open affair with her, as his wife keeps waiting with patient, pained dignity for him to come home. Meanwhile Bardots wild and impulsive Yvette keeps vacillating between affections for her older, stable lover, and her hot, volatile young guy.

The film is never boring, if a bit on the surface, with an oddly light tone.  Its also amazing to see just how much more sophisticated the French were about sexuality in film in the 50s.  And the ending is quite moving, giving the whole film a deeper resonance than it would have  otherwise.  I found I liked it even better on a second viewing, the melodrama seemed more human and touching, and the tragic nature of unwise love was brought home with considerable power and style.",1442793600,,1266,4.650224215246637

That alone makes it essential viewing.  The production values, acting, photography, script, music, and all other components of film-making you can think of, are of the highest order.

Made in 1957, the topic is one Hollywood wouldn't treat in a serious fashion for another 25 years.  The transfer on this Russian dvd is top notch, and, thankfully, unedited.  (Bardot's nude scenes, although essential to the story line, were censored worldwide at the time.)  Not only was BB in a class all by herself as an icon of feminine sexuality, she showed in this film she was also an excellent actress.  The fact she holds her own in a starring role opposite Jean Gabin is nothing short of remarkable.

Note: Love Is My Profession is the title used for the Anglo market.  The original title translates into English as In Case Of Adversity.

This film has my highest recommendation.",1262304000,10,1022,4.855491329479769
7946835,3,B00005NFSA,"The phenomenal success of the Bardot myth, like that of James Dean which just preceded it, was very much the immediate response of the youth public to a need they felt in themselves and which Bardot was the first young girl to realize on the screen...

In Claude Autant-Lara's film, Bardot came off as more than a sexual image, her persona giving life to the character she portrayed... The film contained of the most erotic scenes of her career: Brigitte was called on to raise her skirt in order to convince a skeptical lawyer to represent her case!

In her frank demand for sexual pleasure Bardot is without any feminine guile, and the film contrasts her 'honesty,' for what it is worth, with the sophisticated behavior of the 'woman of the world' played by Edwige Feuillre...

Gabin and Feuillre, dubious at first of appearing with her, claimed subsequently to have found her charming and intelligent, but at the same time nervous, full of self-doubt, and uncertain both of her talent and her beauty...",1167177600,8,1005,4.797687861271676
