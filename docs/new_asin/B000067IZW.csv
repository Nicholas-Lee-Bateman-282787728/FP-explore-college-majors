1716797,4,B000067IZW,"Laughing Boy is a well made independent comedy that comes at you with no holds barred. Cody MacKenzie is a regular guy, he can be a jerk, he knows it, but he just is looking for something to help him through a life that threatens to go through the motions.
Tonight a party is being thrown for his best friend by his boss, the desirable Elizabeth Sheridan. Cody is ready to let loose, though his wife Judy hopes he can make nice with the company brass.
Well, that ain't gonna happen.
What follows is a berating on the stiffs of life, jabs at televangelists, self absorbed moms, people seemingly caught in the system, and basically Cody saying whatever he feels regardless of what anyone thinks. Throw in some cool animated segments for some more fun and this a solid flick.

As far as characters, Cody is funny yet grating and jokes are hit and miss (more hit though), but he does try to set some people straight honestly, and he gets it back himself (though he nails some good). His boss Elizabeth has a great scene where we get Cody down to basics.
The acting, I feel, is spirited if not just pretty damn good. Joe Grisaffi(as Cody)is a hoot (and over the top, but that is the point), Anne Quackenbush as Judy, his wife, is solid and a stabilizing factor. And Thersa Kotara as Elizabeth Sheridan delivered one of the movie's best scenes. Robin Craig as the televagelist Bobby Jo was priceless. And I can't forget Michael Gray, as Cody's enagaged pal Mike, who helps us take Cody with a grain of salt, with a look towards ourselves.
The DVD has great extras, one being commentary, which is really cool to listen to considering all the aspects of independent film making.
Overall, a worthy purchase.",1036108800,8,1698,4.549019607843137
1716798,5,B000067IZW,"If you don't see this movie, you will never know what you are missing out on!
Cody McKenzie is someone who would liven up any party, his wife Judy is a model saint who gives Cody just enough rope (or is it a rubber band?) to be his loveable self, Elizabeth Sheridan (the boss) and the rest of the co-workers and guests are perfectly cast with each of their little ""quirks"" that make us all just want to be a little more like Cody.  In the end, it's a party that you would not want to have missed for the stories that will be told about it for years to come.
This movie is a real laugh fest with all of the jokes and sight gags, but I would have to put a PG-13 rating on it for some of the more ""adult"" humor.
Laughing Boy is a refreshing surprise and breath of fresh air in the world of independent filmmaking.  Any ""movie buff"" will find this film a welcome addition to their collection, and then something they will want to pick up additional copies of to give away to their friends and family to enjoy as a truly original gift.",1013472000,4,1030,4.119402985074627
1716799,5,B000067IZW,"Let's face it, the world situation has most of us watching way too much CNN... we all long for the good ol' days of...just having a GOOOOOOOOOOD laugh, and Laughing Boy DELIVERS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. When I bought the movie, I had no expectations really, I liked the clip/trailer I saw on an online site and figured I'd check it out... Boy, was I pleasantly surprised to find that my money had been well spent! Laughter isn't something they sell at an aisle in a store, and laughter is something that everyone needs right now, and Laughing Boy is a sure fire way to get some smiling and laughter going on in your world... just pop it in the vcr and hit play; anyone that is in the room will, within four minutes, stop what they are doing and ask in a giggly voice ""What movie is this?""(We have done this three times and each person stayed to watch the whole movie with us... it's a real 'friend catcher'.)
I could not agree more that the movie is much like Python/D&D mixed together in perfect harmony.  Oddly, we also had said after watching it the first time how it was right up there with Python! We use the 'he threw his pants at me' line here often.
I saw 4 movies in the theatre this year; Hannibal, J&B Strike Back, Don't Say a Word, and Harry Potter... much as I loved Jay and Silent Bob's film, I gotta say that my vhs copy of Laughing Boy delivers more laughs and I also feel the price I paid for the vhs copy of Laughing Boy was the best 'bang for my buck' in comparison to the other movies I saw.
It is, beyond any doubt in my mind, the BEST Christmas present I am giving out this year... I got a few copies for family and friends. :O) The way to go with gift giving this year is comedy, and Laughing Boy is a great way to give those you love a chuckle :O)",1008633600,8,1767,4.151603498542274
1716800,4,B000067IZW,"Mostly hilarious; a little disjointed in some parts with no real plot, but all in all, I would recommend this movie as a ""crazy comedy.""  I wouldn't recommend to children under the age of 13.",1003363200,3,191,4.457142857142857
1716801,5,B000067IZW,"""A cross between MONTY PYTHON and DUMB AND DUMBER"" - that is, without a doubt, THE best way to describe LAUGHING BOY.
Lovable nitwit Cody McKenzie and his wife Judy are invited to a party. While Judy sees this as an opportunity for her hubby to move up in the world, Cody is more interested in lusting after their host - his lovely boss Elizabeth Sheridan. All throughout the party, Cody's antics ruffle quite a few feathers - one of the most memorable scenes is his heckling of a local televangelist.
My regards to the entire cast and crew - in particular, Brazil Joe Grisaffi III for both directing and acting in the lead role of Cody McKenzie. And my special hats off to Tiffany Grant for her unforgetable performance as Alicia Dimsdale. You anime fans out there will undoubtedly recognize her as the voice of Asuka Langley Soryu from Neon Genesis Evangelion.
LAUGHING BOY's outrageous humor lies in its dialogue, along with quite a few sight gags, including several animated cartoon shorts which give the audience a look into Cody's warped imagination. Yet, amidst all the monkey business are strong underlying themes of love and friendship.
This is definitely one indie worth checking out. Thumbs up!",1003190400,8,1205,4.826086956521739
7963280,5,B000067IZW,Laughing Boy is can old old movie. I first saw most of it on TV. It wasn't meant to be comical but it is because of the time but was made. Allnin all it had a good story line. If you like real Native American movies (not the stupid ones suvh as dances with wolves) Laughing Boy is worth seeing.,1524787200,,294,3.9166666666666665
7963281,4,B000067IZW,"I was looking for something light and clever - this hit the spot. Great lines, I wanted to write them down. It would be great to get the screenplay to read it.",1512259200,2,159,4.0
7963282,1,B000067IZW,"I repeat NOOOOOOOO!  Couldn't get past 10 minutes of really, really, really bad acting.",1504051200,,87,5.214285714285714
7963283,4,B000067IZW,"It's great when an independent film generates honest, knee-jerk laughter - and Brasil J. Grisaffi's ""Laughing Boy"" did just that. Right from the opening sequence and titles, I got the feeling this comedy was a step above average. The spot-on performances and witty writing made this movie a real treat. I always appreciate it when filmmakers cast the right actors for the appropriate roles.

Grisaffi takes the lead role (simultaneously directing & producing) of Cody MacKenzie, a half-wit, rude & lewd man-boy who spends the entire film sticking his foot in his mouth and insulting just about every character - wife included - that walks into the film. While the over-the-top sophomoric [sophomoronic?] antics might have been served well done by a lesser talent, Grisaffi immediately wraps his arm around the audience with tongue in cheek and wins us over to the Dark... I mean, the Dim Side.

With a series of back-to-back scenes of outrageous characters delivering hysterical dialogue paired with some wonderful physical humor, ""Laughing Boy"" kept my wife and I amused for the long haul. And the DVD commentary with cast and crew is just as entertaining as the feature. Technically, the quality of production was excellent.

I'm glad I took a chance on ""Laughing Boy"". It generated more laughs than a lot of contemporary Hollywood comedies. Kudos!",1144368000,4,1350,5.099547511312217
7963284,5,B000067IZW,"Ahem.  Buy this dvd and have a great time watching it with a friend.  I found ""Laughing Boy"" to be a pleasent surprise coming from an independent film maker.  I really loved Tiffany Grant as Alicia Dimdales and several of the other actors that appear here as well.  The director gets the most from his cast and the extras included in the dvd are halarous. Reading over the reviews here.....I only found one bad review among people that have purchased this.  Highly recommend this dvd!!!!!",1119916800,2,488,4.694117647058824
7963285,5,B000067IZW,"A Christmas gift to myself!  An unanticipated surprise.  I did not expect to enjoy this film as much as I did.  Something warm, and human about the characters--about the situation portrayed...  The party nobody really wants to attend.  The people nobody wants really to associate with.  Salvation comes through the honesty, the immediacy of Cody the Offensive One...  The characters, especially Cody, stay with me...

Save money!  Buy the DVD direct from Burgertron.  Go to the ""used"" section.  Buy for $8 from Burgertron.  A real bargain.  Money well spent.",1104364800,2,558,5.134831460674158
7963286,1,B000067IZW,"After checking out the reviews for Sidewalks of New York, I noticed that someone who liked that movie recommended, Laughing Boy. Curious, I bought it and then went through the painful experience of watching it. Going back to the positive review, I noticed that the name of the person who raved about Laughing Boy was the same as the director of the movie. So I only have to assume that the positive reviews found here are from the sound guy, camera guy, and the director's mother, respectively.",1055548800,3,494,4.689655172413793
7963287,4,B000067IZW,"The story is about a house party that seems well enough until maverick guy Cody shows up to make fun of all the up-tight people. Even his supportive wife is tested by his shenanigans. Ultimately, he is faced with choosing between his wacky sense of integrity and his livelihood.
I expected only a joke-filled, silly, thin plot, because of the first sketch. However, the opening is the least successful part of this film, and the film's true, deeper meaning sneaks in slowly.
The true purpose of the film lies in the use of familiar characters that are confronted by issues of social and personal conformity. By use of a good story line, the film is engaging, as well as both funny AND thoughtful.
I'd recommend this DVD for the excellent cast and heart-felt production.",1053907200,4,769,4.746268656716418
7963288,5,B000067IZW,"This is a great little movie, and well worth watching. It's about a day in the life of a guy that just can't seem to stop trying to be funny. He ends up going to a friends party where not everyone is such a huge fan of his sense of humor. And the fun begins. You may end up loving or hating this guy by the end of the movie, but either way, you will have had a good time doing it. It's just packed full of gags, and good times. This is what TRUE Independent Movie Making should be about. Great entertainment, very well put together, and some very well acted. Joe Grisaffi is the director and lead actor in it, and does a great job at both. Also, many extra features, including a really nice commentary.",1048032000,5,702,4.094202898550725
