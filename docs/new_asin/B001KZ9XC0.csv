8316559,5,B001KZ9XC0,I have a number of the quick licks dvds and it seems like the best rhythms and licks seem to come from Danny Gill. There's some great licks to learn on here and he always breaks down the rhythm as well (which is also pretty cool in itself).Grab this one and the Jimmy Page slow blues dvd which is also highly reccomended.,1280880000,,321,4.193548387096774
