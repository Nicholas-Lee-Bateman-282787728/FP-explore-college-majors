2762895,4,B000NA1NXA,"I watched this film after watching Xana and Dax: When Opposites Attract, and I vastly prefer this one.  Watching Matt and Khym together, I could tell they are very, very much in love.  When they looked at each other they practically beamed.  I found this emotional passion to be very endearing and erotic.

Each also seemed to really appreciate and savor the other's body.  Although their erotic scene was shorter than Xana and Dax's, I felt like it had a better arc to the ""story"" (if one could call having sex a story).

I would buy this again, and out of Tony Comstock's films I would probably recommend this film for a heterosexual couple's first.  I think it is very accessible and not intimidating.",1194566400,14,704,4.629032258064516
2762896,4,B000NA1NXA,"Matt and Khym is a wonderful introduction into the joys of married sex. When you look at this movie, you can see the genuine love Matt and Khym have for each other. Matt and Khym are so candid in talking about their life in and out of the bedroom that you come away feeling like they could be your next door neighbors or close friends. The scene at the end of their lovemaking when Matt looks lovingly at Khym is the way any girl would want her guy to look at her. I replayed the promo at Tony Comstock's web site over and over again, just to see that look.

This is definitely not your typical porn movie. Half of the movie involves talking interspersed with clips of their love making. I recommend couples watch the whole movie in the living room, and then move on to the bedroom.",1187827200,21,782,4.248322147651007
2762897,5,B000NA1NXA,"This is the first of the Comstock movies I've seen, but it absolutely won't be the last. This really is something different - ""documentary"" erotica, about a real couple not so different from anyone else.

The first half of the movie features the two talking to a silent, unseen interviewer. They describe their relationship, from the time they met, to their wedding (surprisingly like my own), through years of a complex and full home life. Throughout, they describe the career of their physical relationship at each period. It comes across as happy and a bit ordinary - I like that, it creates a kind of comfort with the couple that I don't have good words for, and teases me into caring about them.

The interview is broken into segments of a few minutes each, interleaved with moments from their bedroom love-making. That seems natural, too, the kinds of activities and positions I've enjoyed rather than bizarre contortions to create some camera angle. The interview ends about halfway through the movie. At that point, the bedroom scene restarts, then plays beyond what we saw in the first half. Because the interview made the two seem more real, my own arousal comes from theirs as if they're sharing it with me - not vicarious or voyeuristic, but friendly.

If you've been put off by adult films in the past, you probably had good reason: negative tone, forced activities and pacing, and people that look like plastic and sound worse. There's none of that here. It's warm, private, and above all happy - and isn't that what a love life should be?

2762898,5,B000NA1NXA,"Tony Comstock is the creator and master of a new genre of films:  explicit couples' sexuality documentaries.  Comstock states that ""intent to arouse"" is often cited as the dividing line between art and porn.  Of all the emotions a director might hope to induce in an audience, arousal remains the last taboo, and Tony Comstock takes it head-on.

Matt and Khym:  Better Than Ever is an affirmation of married love and sexual exploration.  The pair got together in their early twenties, and now after over a decade of marriage, the spark is still there.  Comstock's other films feature a porn couple, a hip New York pair, and young gay lovers, so this look at married love is an exiting new angle in his series.

Amazon also carries Comstock titles Marie & Jack (Comstock's first film, with married pornographic actors), and Xana & Dax (an older blonde and her Brazilian lover).  I only wished they also carried his first-rate gay male feature Damon & Hunter.",1175644800,40,957,4.786585365853658
2762899,5,B000NA1NXA,"Matt and Khym are a beautifully sexy, real life couple and I was completely charmed as I listened to them tell their story in the documentary style interview that opens this wonderful film and totally captivated to witness their lovemaking in the erotic scene that followed.

They seem to enjoy themselves in front of the camera in a way that welcomes us as viewers into their intimate life and into their bedroom with a disarming frankness that's become a trademark of Tony Comstock's films. As a result, this lovely film has been welcomed into my own bedroom on a number of occasions!

Not only do Matt and Khym shine and bubble over with a tender enthusiam for each other that seems to make them literally sparkle, but the film itself  has the most beautiful lustre. It has a look that lends weight to the idea that love, sex, pleasure and intimacy are indeed important and special and wonderful. With his distinctive style, Tony Comstock has once again cleverly combined visual beauty, sexual heat, genuine chemistry, sympathetic characters and compelling real life stories into an erotic, well crafted film that I'm delighted to recommend.

Matt and Khym: Better Than Ever, just like all the other sexy Comstock Films I've enjoyed, was a real pleasure to watch alone and a great joy to share with a lover. It's sex filmed with grace, style and skill, with respect for the lovers and for the viewer.

Matt and Khym: Better Than Ever shines!",1171756800,46,1444,4.783132530120482
2762900,5,B000NA1NXA,"I was so moved and delighted by this DVD that I emailed Tony Comstock to tell him that as soon as I got done watching it.  For those who have misgivings about the content or quality of mainstream porn, this offering from Comstock may be just what you're looking for in that it is genuine, heartfelt, and sexy.  For those like me who do delve a fair amount into mainstream porn, I recommend Matt and Khym as a magnificent and refreshing testament to how hot the depiction of genuine sex in the context of obvious true love can be.  Very highly recommended.",1171411200,23,555,4.421568627450981
2762927,5,B000NA1NXA,"Comstock Films is a different side of the adult industry. The forty minutes or so of interview footage, wherein Matt and Khym describe the various stages of their relationship, removes concerns about exploitation or consent. The interview makes clear that these are two people who love each other and are completely infatuated with each other's bodies. It is fascinating to listen to these two people tell their story. There's an honesty about relationships that one doesn't normally get to witness. Just as it's rare to get a peak at what other people do in the bedroom, it's rare to get a peak at other people's experience of commitment.

And the sex. The sex is hot. The camera spends time on their blissful expressions and their bodies, as opposed to being completely focused on the couple's genitalia. The positions are natural, though certainly not boring. They are the positions of two people who know exactly what works for them and how they fit together. Their noises, their breathing, and their movements are genuine.

If you're a lover of sex, particularly of images of sex, support Comstock films. They provide a window into what a world with a wide variety of sexual options would look like.",1258329600,5,1204,4.897058823529412
2762928,4,B000NA1NXA,"I received a review copy of ""Matt and Khym: Better Than Ever"" from Comstock Films, having not seen any of its other videos before, and it was very (and refreshingly) unusual. While there is explicit sexual activity shown, this is not a ""porno"" film, nor a pseudo-educational ""how to"" video. Instead, it's a documentary of a loving couple, shown talking frankly about their relationship and their history together, meshed with a filmed session of their lovemaking. The interweaving of the couple's speaking and their lovemaking can be somewhat abrupt at times, making it difficult to process the flow of either the narrative or the sex. Perhaps in response to this, the filmmakers re-show the entire lovemaking session, uninterrupted, after the conclusion of the interview. (Unfortunately, there is no opportunity to view the interview portion as a whole.)

Yes, this means that you can skip to the ""good parts,"" but it's the discussion between the two *very real* people that makes this film so interesting. These aren't porn stars, or even (it seems) professional actors. They are real people, in a real relationship, and while they may be more willing than most to have their lovemaking filmed and put onto a DVD, they do not come off as reality show wannabees, but rather as two individuals who are secure in and proud of their love for each other in all of its facets.

Comstock's other offerings ([...]l) show same-sex couples, actual adult stars (""Marie and Jack: A Hardcore Love Story""), and older subjects (""Bill & Desiree: Love is Timeless""), but Matt and Khym are unique in their non-uniqueness. They are a couple, like so many others, and the truth of their connection comes out in both parts of the film.",1257897600,5,1716,4.9342560553633215
2762929,1,B000NA1NXA,Way too much inane talk between the couple.  Listening to it was so boring we shut it off. I was very disappointed and so was my wife.,1256169600,2,134,3.962962962962963
2762930,4,B000NA1NXA,"Tony Comstock does it again with ""Matt and Khym: Better Than Ever"".  You would think that using the same formula over and over would get boring, but Comstock's films are always arousing, intimate and beautiful, and each cast of lovers so diverse that there is always something new to enjoy and experience.  It is the lovers: their different stories, personalities and relationships; that make each Comstock film unique and stand-alone.  And, while you may think, seen one, seen them all, nothing could be further from the truth.

What starts off slow and sensual with loving caresses soon heats up into a passionate scene of erotic love.  Matt and Khym's sex scene is intimate, compelling, sweet and erotic.  What I enjoy most about Comstock films is that the lovemaking is always about mutual pleasure, unlike so many porn films that are focused on male desire only.  The men in Comstock's films are more interested in deriving their pleasure by giving pleasure to their partners and are gifted at making love.

Matt and Khym: Better Than Ever, is a pleasure to watch solo and even more special to share with a lover.",1246147200,8,1118,4.847368421052631
2762931,3,B000NA1NXA,"This DVD is about real sex and real people but it is produced in by taking a video of a couple talking about their relationship and splicing in segments of them making love throughout the narrative. The video editor repeats segments to string out the action until finally running a long segment of the couple having sex. The sex was both erotic and sexy to me as a male.
The couple is attractive and pleasant to listen to and watch. Taking the movie as a whole, the action is fragmented enough to be annoying.
To view this as an erotic film I would have liked to have better control of going to scenes or selected chapters. I had a difficult time controlling where I was on the DVD. There's lots of advertising for other movies/titles and I couldn't easily jump away from it to the main film. And, I'm not very interesting in girl/girl or guy/guy movie previews.",1244073600,10,862,4.462025316455696
2762932,5,B000NA1NXA,Matt and Khym was an absolute delight!  We watched it together last night and were completely spellbound.  The couple has a lovely story - and hearing them tell it was just fantastic.  Knowing how connected they were as a couple made the lovemaking scenes even more hot!  After it was over we felt like we had shared something special together - loving and connected with our passion - what an amazing experience!!,1231977600,6,414,4.708333333333333
2762933,1,B000NA1NXA,Matt and Khym seem to really love one another. Their story is nice and can be related to by a lot of people. We didn't find it very erotic. My wife and I thought it was rather boring. It is not a movie we will ever watch again.,1230768000,4,227,3.75
2762934,2,B000NA1NXA,"Very nice film but too much talking.  Sex parts were good, not gross but nice for a woman to see but the talking while very touching really was too distracting.",1221350400,4,160,4.333333333333333
2762935,5,B000NA1NXA,"The cover of the case for Matt and Khym says, ""Real people, real life, real sex"" and for once the blurb fits perfectly. This is one of the most enchanting DVDs that I have ever viewed. Khym's candor in talking of their sex life is more than refreshing, it is a convincing argument for sex as sex should be, unrehearsed and breathtakingly open. The same can be said for her orgasms during the sex scenes. They were as real as the fingers that type this review. Best of all was the obvious love that these two hold for each other. It ran like a golden thread from the beginning to the end of this delightful DVD. Needless to say, I recommend this production to any who are uninhibited enough to view sex without offense.",1220313600,11,718,4.365671641791045
2762936,2,B000NA1NXA,"Cute story about the couple, but come on guys, it's a sex dvd - i don't really care about your entire life story, in fact, I don't want to know it.
Yes, the couple are obviously very much in love and when they do make love it is really 'well done' - that felt odd to type! BUT some music might have been nice, or some sound. They make love in complete silence which I found really off putting.",1219363200,8,393,3.9873417721518987

8176001,1,B000NA1NXA,Does not even come close to being a love story.  Poor quality and not filmed very well.  Would not recommentd.,1387584000,,110,4.45
8176002,4,B000NA1NXA,"Nice romantic film with meaning. The dialogue is a little slow, but the love making scenes are excellent. I wish there were more like it!",1364169600,,137,4.52
8176003,2,B000NA1NXA,Content was very shallow. Wasn't worth the money spent. I was disappointed. I don't know what I expected but  this fell short.,1354752000,,126,4.7272727272727275
8176004,1,B000NA1NXA,"I had previously ordered Xana and Dax by Comstock films and though it was pretty good so I decided to get Matt and Khym.  I listened to the reviews for Matt and Khym, they all had real positive things to say...what a big mistake!!  The movie was unfocused and blurry most of the time and the camera angles were all over the place.  It looked as if someone took  a handrecorder and recorded from another dvd playing on tv.  I don't know if this was what the film really looked like or if I received a big dud from the seller... Highly disappointed, so not worth $19.95.",1330300800,,568,4.271028037383178
8176005,2,B000NA1NXA,"The ""Real People, Real Sex"" label had been used, very successfully about twenty years ago by a different producer.  That series of VHS tapes included a great deal of foreplay in a loving and sophisticated way, with the couples talking and communicating during lovemaking.  The Comstock series seems to be about 1/2-2/3 talk, which seems superfluous, then a rather mild and not terribly sophisticated session of sex.  I would recommend either Vivid's Sex-Ed series or the Jaiya Red Hot Sex series ahead of this one.",1295913600,,514,5.023529411764706
8176006,5,B000NA1NXA,"""Matt & Khym"" is a great entry in the Comstock library of relationship documentaries, in which a couple describe their chemistry, talk about how they met and how their relationship developed, what they love about each other, and -- oh yeah -- what they like in bed.  They proceed to happily demonstrate the physical side of their relationship in brief flash-forward moments during their conversation, then in longer cuts in the final scene.

Make no mistake, this is explicit and erotic -- made more erotic, in my opinion, by the long conversation that takes place in the first two-thirds of the movie.  By the time you're watching Khym and Matt stroke each other tenderly, you've gotten to know them at least as well as you might have if you were seated across the table from them at a dinner party.  You know that Khym wasn't always so open and experienced, and she still uses much tamer language (with a blushing smile) than Matt does, so you understand that it really means something for her to invite the viewer into their bedroom.

Matt and Khym absolutely adore each other, and it's such a treat to see them please each other.",1291161600,5,1133,4.673366834170854
8176007,3,B000NA1NXA,Too much interviewing and dialogue - just don't care.  My wife and i laugh at the interview.,1284163200,,92,4.411764705882353
8176008,5,B000NA1NXA,"(Late to the party, because I didn't realize you could review items you hadn't bought on Amazon...  And just ignore those one-review wonders.)

The Mrs. and I picked this one up soon after it came out.  No cheesy soundtrack, no lame plot, just two people like me and my wife, talking, then having sex.

Amazing!

The interview portion was cute but still heartfelt and honest.  The adult portion was stunning:  well filmed, you can see their faces pretty much throughout, and the couple are obviously enjoying one another.

Most ""porn"" leaves me cold, and doubly so my wife.  But, this isn't typical porn by any means.

If you're looking for mainstream porn try elsewhere.  If you want to watch a beautiful depiction of two committed people enjoying the hell out of one another, buy this film!",1263859200,6,792,4.75
