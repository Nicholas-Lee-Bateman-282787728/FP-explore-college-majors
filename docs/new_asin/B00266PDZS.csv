3852632,1,B00266PDZS,"fellow rookies fan, do not feel too bad, i been waiting for season 3 of ''The Mod Squad'', which is like the very same serie, but only better, and was orginaly on abc as well. but cbs/and paramount won't release season 3 of this serie either, i even contacted the company, both cbs/paramount which told me this thank you bob--the t.v. ---man",1326844800,,341,4.516129032258065
3852633,5,B00266PDZS,I've only just discovered this show and after seeing the season 1 DVDs I'd really like to buy the other three seasons.  It's apparently 3 years since the first season came out and the show isn't on TV - where are we supposed to see the rest of it?  I'm getting really tired of starting to buy series and then discovering that the majority of episodes will not be following the first volume or two: do TV companies have any respect for viewers?,1280534400,13,443,4.325301204819277
3852634,5,B00266PDZS,"I have the first season on DVD and I like what I see. I have attempted to contact ABC with numerous emails to try and purchase from them certain episodes from the second, third, and fourth seasons, but I have received no response. If the episodes aren't going to be released for the public to buy on DVD and ABC won't even acknowledge customers that are willing to buy copies of the program from the last three seasons, then what else is left to try?",1274832000,11,450,4.305882352941176

3852639,5,B00266PDZS,"What can I say? I love The Rookies.  I got hooked on it in re-runs, since I was a small child when it originally aired. The chemistry of the cast is great and really meshed well. Lt. Ryker (Gerald S. O'Loughlin 1921-2015) is my favorite character in the show.  I have started checking out Gerald O's past performances in film and television as a result of watching this show (I highly recommend that you watch him in the original Hawaii-Five O episode ""The Box.""). I hope that Seasons 3 and 4 will be released at some point in the near future so I can find out what happens to these beloved characters.",1454198400,,602,4.366071428571429

When it was on the air they used to give one episode a week and that is exactly how I watch it now. I want this to last for a very long time.",1353456000,,416,3.5824175824175826
3852670,5,B00266PDZS,"FIrst of all I am very happy that Season 2 is available and I hope we can see similar developments for Hill Street Blues as well. Looking back this 70s series you can see how television shows were trying to transition a bit in terms of character development and though the characters are not as deeply exposed as today's television it is still great to see Michael Ontkean and Kate Jackson together in scenes and some of the interactions between the other main characters. Also great fun to see a very young John Travolta and Annette OToole to name just a few.
The product itself - the dvd- is fine. I wish series like The Rookies and Here Come the Brides had at least a couple of interviews as extras. That would make these golden oldies really special and worth all the waiting for them!",1348444800,6,789,4.448275862068965

3852673,4,B00266PDZS,"I gave it 4 of 5 stars because a)The PILOT was promised-it is not included. and B) Episode Prayers Unanswered, Prayers unheard---is an EDITED print--missing 5 minutes. Aside--the rest of the 22 episodes are uncut and very nice. The six discs put 4 episodes per disc which is better than the compressed '5"" episodes on tyhe SONY first deason set---but for some reason the DVD quality is NO better than the first season set.

Watch the episode DEADLY CAGE at about 2 min 50 seconds into the episode---is this not the most authentic and WICKED gunshot  EVER on a television series?---this was  cut out in the edited Viacom syndication versions shown in reruns--beleive me--I have not seen this since 1973-- this was worth the price of the DVD set alone.  Great effect-- WAY ahead of its time for realism. You can HEAR the bullet graze-with proper sound effect and n oshortage of blood. Yes--this would get a ""R"" rating today in a movie. By contrast--you will not find one death in a ""James bond"" movie as bloody as in many episodes of The Rookies.

Negative: You can clearly see Sam melville's Stunt double in many fight scenes of Season 2. There are a few scenes in which he does some interesting fights (Margin For error for example) but in many episodes yo ucan clearly see the face of the stuntman. This sort of problem was in season one of Star Trek (Shatner's stuntman) because TV screens were small back then and there was no VHS/ DVD.",1344556800,,1439,4.60546875
3852674,5,B00266PDZS,"My suggestion if you are thinking about buying this product is to get season one.  It is only about $15, and I think you will see that this show is worth watching. Then you will want season two which is reasonably priced, and you get the whole season in one set. The episodes are easy to follow, and after watching one it always leaves me with a good feeling. I think that it is fantastic that another season released for those that have been waiting. I just saw an episode with John Travolta playing a teen who gets in a lot of trouble, but don't worry as I think they just held him back a few grades as he shows back up in high school in ""Welcome Back, Kotter"".",1344470400,3,663,4.1395348837209305
3852675,5,B00266PDZS,"All I have to say about this is 'It's About Time!' Fans have been waiting for five years for someone to release Season 2. I learned about 2 years ago that Sony had no plans to release the rest of the series due to poor response. They don't care about the fans who've been waiting. There may not be a lot of us, but we are a loyal bunch.

Season 2 was the final season for Michael Ontkean, who played Rookie Willie Gillis. Ontkean left over a supposed salary dispute. The reasons for his exit depends on what article you read.

Season 2 is my favorite season for a variety of reasons, but the main one being it includes the episode, 'A Matter of Justice,' where Jill Danko is shot during a restaurant dinner with Mike on their anniversary and loses their baby.

I can't wait until August. All of us Rookies fans need to make sure that we buy Season 2, so that The Shout! Factory will release the last two seasons.",1336521600,31,912,4.2601156069364166

8352218,4,B00266PDZS,"""The Rookies"" was such a phenomenal and magical police procedural television series.
It followed the exploits of three rookie police officers working in an unidentified city for the fictitious Southern California Police Department (SCPD).

Georg Stanford Brown was perfect in the role of Officer Terry Webster.
Sam Melville was perfect in the role of Officer Mike Danko.
Michael Ontkean was perfect in the role of Officer Willie Gillis.
Kate Jackson was perfect in the role of registered nurse Jill Danko.
Gerald S. O'Loughlin was perfect in the role of Lieutenant Ed Ryker.

I rated Shout! Factory's 6-disc DVD set of ""The Rookies: The Complete Second Season"" just four stars because
it included the syndicated version of ""Prayers Unanswered, Prayers Unheard"" instead of the original ABC network version.

The second season of ""The Rookies"" originally aired on ABC from September 10, 1973 until March 18, 1974.

Here are the exact running times for all 23 episodes from the second season of ""The Rookies"" on this 6-disc DVD set.

Disc 1:
""Cauldron"" (51:07)
""Margin for Error"" (50:54)
""Deadly Cage"" (50:57)
""Frozen Smoke"" (50:54)

Disc 2:
""Get Ryker"" (50:53)
""Cry Wolf"" (51:08)
""A Matter of Justice"" (51:06)
""Blood Brother"" (51:06)

Disc 3:
""Code 261"" (50:37)
""Prayers Unanswered, Prayers Unheard"" (46:21)
""Down Home Boy"" (51:05)
""Lots of Trees and a Running Stream"" (51:06)

Disc 4:
""Another Beginning for Ben Fuller"" (51:08)
""Sound of Silence"" (51:01)
""Trial by Doubt"" (50:36)
""The Authentic Death of Billy Stomper"" (51:02)

Disc 5:
""The Late Mr. Brent"" (51:05)
""The Teacher"" (51:06)
""Eyewitness"" (51:03)
""Something Less Than a Man"" (51:08)

Disc 6:
""Rolling Thunder"" (51:08)
""Time Lock"" (50:32)
""Death Watch"" (51:02)

There weren't any teasers included in any of the episodes on this 6-disc DVD set.
It might be possible that each of these 23 episodes didn't have teasers when these episodes originally aired on ABC.

Michael Ontkean departed ""The Rookies"" following the end of the second season.
He co-starred in the 90-minute pilot episode of ""The Rookies"".
He also co-starred in every episode of seasons one and two of ""The Rookies"".

The picture quality and audio quality on this 6-disc DVD set are both fantastic.

The packaging that Shout! Factory used for ""The Rookies: The Complete Second Season"" is perfect.
The discs are stored in a plastic DVD case that holds all six discs.
None of the discs share the same side of any of the disc holding trays and none of the discs overlap any of the discs either.

Notable guest stars from the second season of ""The Rookies"" were Abe Vigoda, Andrew Parks, Ann Doran, Annette O'Toole, Anthony Zerbe,
Bill Ewing, Bill Williams, Billy Green Bush, Bridget Hanley, Claude Akins, Dabbs Greer, Dane Clark, Darleen Carr, Don Gordon,
