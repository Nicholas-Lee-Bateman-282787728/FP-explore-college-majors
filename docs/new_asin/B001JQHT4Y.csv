8520151,2,B001JQHT4Y,"I bought this DVD out of curiosity and my liking of noir films. Boy oh boy how I got so lucky. The picture quality was like it was transfered from an unmastered VHS, the English subtitles were really small and non-removable and the plot was so disinteresting. I didn't really care what was going on and I couldn't make head nor tail of most of the movie since the picture was so abysmal and the camera movement was pretentiously jittering. Such a dark day for Polish cinema. I'd rather see TRICKS (SZTUCZKI) once again.",1237507200,4,519,4.531914893617022
