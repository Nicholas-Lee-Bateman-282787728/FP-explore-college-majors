5900891,5,B00EARD15K,"What a heartfelt and meaningful film. These film makers nail it--the passion Pittsburgh felt and continues to feel for Roberto Clemente. They get just about everything else too--a sense of the place, and even the accents and the cultural references (long live Isaly's).

But we get more than that. We get a great road film, better than any self-absorbed Beat Poet could provide, with twists and turns and a range of characters from cooks to farmers, a motorcycle gang and a sympathetic MD. We get an engaging tale of two brothers growing closer. Will they make it back to Pittsburgh in time? Of course, they will. Then again, maybe not. It's never quite clear and the story builds.

Everything about this film is authentic, from the kids' baseball games and the wise, old-world grandpa to the way these two teenage boys think, and the great 1970s soundtrack. A confession: I'm from there too, and like the film makers, my playmates and I lived for the Pirates (yes, there were good once), and imitated Clemente at bat and in the field. Making it all the more poignant was something no one knew at the time--that Clemente's 3000th base hit would also be his last. Hard to believe that just three months later, he would be dead.

Not to give anything away, but the scene with the state trooper brought back a startling memory for me--my father waking me up on New Year's Day 1973 to share the news of Clemente's death, which he had just heard on the radio. So upset was my father that he was actually stuttering as he spoke. To this day, it was the only time I can recall my father--a Marine Corps colonel no less--ever being too emotional to talk. Such was the reverence all of us felt for #21.

That's all a long-winded way of saying this film has soul. See it.",1289260800,38,1761,4.545741324921136

It takes place in the early 70's - a story of two brothers who are big Roberto Clemente fans - and their journey across the country together to try and see their hero get his 3000th major league hit.

5900903,4,B00EARD15K,"Often times sports can bring out the best and the worst in people, but the majority of those stories take place on the field of play. Everything that happens is centered around the game, and rightfully so, that's where the cameras are focused, but once in a while, a story comes along that takes the focus off the field, Chasing 3000 is one such story. In the summer of 1972, Roberto Clemente is 6 hits away from reaching 3000 hits, but brothers Mickey and Roger are stuck in Southern California. Roger's (Rory Culkin) muscular dystrophy has forced the family to relocate, leaving the boys 3000 miles away from their favorite baseball player, but Mickey (Trevor Morgan) has no intention of it preventing him from witnessing history. One weekend when their mother goes away on business, the boys decide to steal her car and make the journey back home, to Pittsburgh. Despite this being a true story, with the cast they have, I feared that this movie would be some lame farce, but it surprised me by being genuine and heartwarming. The truth is that Mickey seemed to always resent his brother, until they went on the trip, and he realized just how a like they really are. Trevor Morgan stars and while I usually don't like the roles he chooses, but he is a very solid young lead. Morgan was good, but it's Rory Culkin who steals the show, playing the hopelessly ill younger brother, who at heart is every bit the wild teenager that his brother is. Along the way, the boys meet a whole cast of unusual characters portrayed in cameos by some people you'd never expect to see in an independent film. As I've said a million times, depth of cast always helps a film along, especially an independent drama. A lot of people will be turned off by the fact that this film centers around a historic sports achievement, but this is by no means a film about sports, and should appeal to large audiences.",1424649600,,1889,4.575221238938053

One of the beautiful things about Chasing 3000 is that you don't have to know anything about baseball, Clemente, or hits to understand what this story is about - family members who care deeply about one another.

I used the little blurb of info. found here, about two brothers who drive across the country to see Clemente's 3000 hit... My son (14 at the time) interjected, saying that is kind of an understatement of the plot. Not wanting to give away anything, I will say he was correct. The story is so much deeper than just baseball.

5900929,2,B00EARD15K,"Family-friendly, but flat, forced and formulaic. ""Chasing 3000"" is loosely based on a true story, but the real brothers never had to travel much more than an hour to see the Pirates. In the movie, they have to travel 2400 hundred miles and their road trip is more bland than beguiling. The best thing about the movie is the archival footage of Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente, but even this is handled clumsily, as the footage sometimes doesn't match the narration. I loved some of the shots of PNC Park, but the closing crowd scenes looked amateurishly faked. Here's hoping that this year's edition of the Pirates fares better than ""Chasing 3000"".",1342051200,3,647,4.785714285714286

I have spina bifida so I kind of relate to the younger brother in this film in that way and really relate to the older brother as I am an older brother and love the game of baseball.  I recommend this film for people of all ages, whether you love sports or not, it's a great story about two brothers saving their relationship with one another.",1340236800,4,582,3.9743589743589745

That is why I gave it a four star and not a five star. It's a feel good movie and a we succeeded against all odds.

Lots of faces you recognize. The backdrop of Clemente's chase of 3000 hits makes it an instant baseball movie classic.  Think of Chasing 3000 as part ""Sandlot"", part ""Stand By Me"" mixed with just a little ""Field of Dreams"". That's a pretty good recipe in my book.",1315872000,7,419,4.546666666666667

I have always been a Pirates fan, and especially a fan of my greatest sports hero, Roberto Clemente.  Needless to say, every time Roberto took the field, the three of us cheered wildly.  After about the fourth inning, he waved his cap at us every time he took the field.  As for icing on the cake, he hit six singles in 13 innings!  Whoa!  What a thrill!  ""Chasing 3000"" brought tears to my eyes.  What a great family film, especially for baseball fans, male or female, young or old.  This movie is what America is all about.  ""Chasing 3000"" is rewarding, heartfelt, and maybe enough to make you appreciate the exciting and abruptly ended career of the great Roberto Clemente.

The present-day scenes book-end the main part of the story, a flashback to 1972 centered around Mickey and his younger, sickly brother Roger, traveling from California to Pittsburgh in an effort to see their hero Roberto Clemente get hit #3000.  Liotta's voice serves as the 'narrator' during the '72 scenes with Mickey and Roger.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, as did my wife and kids.  The movie will never win an Oscar, but it is good, clean, enjoyable fun and might even produce a tear or two.  A must-see for any Roberto Clemente fan.",1304035200,3,707,4.624

The brothers at its center make a great team, with the unexpected dimension of the older brother helping his younger brother with muscular dystrophy, through thick and thin.  Apparently, it is based on a true story.  I loved the beautiful photography of Pittsburgh's green hills, steep streets, and central rivers.  And, I laughed out loud as they worked in some of the local slang, particularly ""jagoff"", which was a common put-down when I was growing up there (never heard elsewhere).  Since we have two boys, too, of course we watched with some dismay at the ill-advised adventure the boys staged in order get from LA to Pittsburgh in time to see Clemente's (last) 3,000th hit in 1972 -- taking off in mom's car, with only a learner's permit, without the younger brother's medicine, a ride in a trunk, avoiding police, hoboing trains, catching a ride with a motorcycle gang, two emergency room visits, etc.  Fortunately, it came across as so dicey that our boys both said spontaneously ""we'd NEVER do that!""  However, one thing after another falls into place -- including Clemente only getting 1 hit a game (and a base on an error) until they could get there -- and all turns out well for this family.
