8655355,5,B00K2OBWTM,"A review from my 7-year-old daughter: ""I liked this movie because it was adventurous. I thought it had good characters. My favorite character was Thea Stilton. I also liked the music. I liked how the story went because it was a good lesson about how to write a travel journal. It gave me the idea to write a travel  journal. I would tell other kids they should watch this movie.""",1411603200,,379,4.414285714285715
