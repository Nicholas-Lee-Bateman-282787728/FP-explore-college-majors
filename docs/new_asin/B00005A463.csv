7934991,5,B00005A463,"Fascinating and tragic, the story of the Donner Party turns out to be about much more than starvation forcing people to cannibalism. Hubris and heroism, foolishness and brilliance, violence and grace, and the whole range of humanity seems to have existed in this little party of people trying to reach California in the 1840s.

Ric Burns does a terrific job, using diaries and letters to establish clear and distinct individual voices and perspectives on exactly what happened on that tragic journey. Among the fascinating facts, more women and children survived than grown men, and it seems it wasn't only because the men took more on. It also appears that, while physically stronger, the men were often mentally weaker.

This could make an amazing narrative film. Once again, The American Experience brings a piece of history one thinks one knows about into far deeper focus, and Ric burns shows he's every bit as remarkable a film-maker as his more celebrated brother Ken.",1462406400,,975,5.049689440993789

7934993,5,B00005A463,"I saw this movie on TV and had to buy the DVD. It is perhaps the best documentary I've ever seen. I can't do it any more justice than others have already done but I'd like to add that I think the score really adds to the mood of this movie. I wish there were a soundtrack album available for this film but despite the obscure titles seen in the end credits, many of these tunes are available on iTunes. You can't help but begin reading Donner history once this film hooks you on the subject.

7934994,5,B00005A463,"It is hard to find words to describe this that haven't been used in many earlier reviews --- ""haunting, mind-blowing, chilling,"" all come to mind.
Suffice it to say, everyone of us has had a moment in life where we could make the right choice or the wrong choice.  All too often, making the wrong choice leads to more wrong choices.  Most of the time, the results are unfortunate, and sometimes they are perilous.  Rarely are the results as grisly as the fate that befell the Donner Party.
As another reviewer noted, these were not bumbling fools done in by their own incompetence.  In fact, many members of the Donner Party were intelligent men & women who really should have known better.  When sound decisions really counted, they consistently made the wrong choice, and these series of bad choices now means that most of us remember the Donner Party alone out of the thousands of wagon trains that went west in the 19th century.
It is an awesome documentary that will not be easily forgotten.  The narrative & the music only augment the eerie, depressing quality of the production.  Ultimately, it leaves all of us with that nagging question:  what would we have done in that same situation?",1066089600,25,1195,4.711538461538462
7934995,5,B00005A463,"The highest compliment that can be said of this video is that it haunted me for days after...the rewatch factor is high.

There has been talk of Angelo Badelamenti's atmospheric music for this video...
as wonderful as that is, Harold Budd adds a punch with his introspective music as well.
If there were an official soundtrack to this treasure I would buy it.",1023235200,5,359,4.698412698412699
7934996,5,B00005A463,"It seems people must focuse on the eating of flesh however, there is so much more to the story. The music by Angelo Badalamenti is stunning! This story of the journey is inspiring. If pioneers could walk to California just think what we can do with out lives in this day and age.  It's a miracle what the human body and spirit can do.  The story ends with Virginia Reed whose family never ate flesh saying ""I have not wrote you half the trouble we've had, but I have wrote you enough to let you know what trouble is......We have got through with our lives.  Don't let this letter dishearten anybody.  Remember, never take no cutoffs and hurry along as fast as you can.""",1022457600,5,669,4.370967741935484

7934998,5,B00005A463,"The Donner Party documentary is a first class history lesson in our pioneer forebears and the hardships they endured in our nation's manifest destiny.
This is  fascinating for the true historian and the amateur historian.  Though it is based on fact the humanity resonates in every minute.  It is a story that outdoes any fictional movie I have seen.  Some of the hightlights are the readings of the letters of the people who lived through it and what became of the people who lived through the ordeal.  The subject of cannabilism is handled without sensationalism. One finds themself thinking would they be able to do what these people had to do: would I become a hero or a demon, would my TRUE nature be good, bad or simply human?
My father is a high school history teacher and he shows this to his students who while fascinated by the subject of cannabilism find themselves learning in spite of themselves.
My deepest thanks to the producer Ric Burns.

7934999,5,B00005A463,"I first saw ""The Donner Party"" during it's initial showing on PBS and it caused me to think about the question of what would I do under the same circumstances.  Also, I can in all honesty say that my sleap was not restful after first viewing this masterful documentary.  It proves that sometimes one does not need to visualy recreate gruesome acts to make us understand how horrifying they are.  Ric Burns through the use of voice over narratives, archival photos, and artist renderings really manages to place us in to the desperate situation that the donner party found themselves in.  So, I highly recommend that this wonderful docunmentary be veiwed by all who are interested in the history of the United States of America.  still, please be aware that this program does become very graphic in the description of the hardship that these doomed individuals indurred on their search for a better life for themselves and their famalies.",991699200,6,937,4.867924528301887
