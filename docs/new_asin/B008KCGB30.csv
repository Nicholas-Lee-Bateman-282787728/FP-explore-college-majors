5168382,1,B008KCGB30,1 star only because Olivia's in it. The movie was so bad I couldn't make it through the whole thing. I ladled a tad over an hour hoping it would get better and it didn't. Save your money.,1423699200,,187,3.9473684210526314
5168383,5,B008KCGB30,"I'm very surprised how much I enjoyed this. I thought an Australian comedy might go right over my head. I laughed through out the movie, Very well done. I've would recommend this to friends so I might as well recommend it to  you. Olivia Newton John was hysterical, she said and did some things that are completely out of character for her. All the cast was excellent. Special shout out to Rebel  Wilson very funny as the brides sister.",1413590400,,436,4.506329113924051
5168384,2,B008KCGB30,"This movie strains to be funny, but consistantly falls short.  I love, love, love Olivia Newton-John, but even she can't save this flick.  It's as if they copied and pasted ideas from other movies and tried to make a new one.  Don't waste your time on this.",1410566400,,257,4.425531914893617
5168385,3,B008KCGB30,"A next satire on Australia as local senator's daughter got married a handsome British nonentity-playing-with-male-friends after a one-night-stay on a Pacific beach,is peppered with drug, sex and stupid fun scenes.",1394150400,,213,6.133333333333334
5168386,5,B008KCGB30,"This is a low budget film, partly funded by the Australian government but this one proves, that you don't need a lot of money to make a really good fun to watch movie.  Basically after a scene on a fictitious pacific island where our British groom to be meets an Australian girl, then one in and outside of a London flat, pretty much the rest of the film is filmed in the grounds of a mansion (and a set somewhere depicting a few rooms inside) in The Blue Mountains, a couple of hours out of Sydney where the wedding is to take place. It doesn't have a big name cast, the actors aren't unknown though, you might have seen them in other movies such as Bait, Pitch Perfect, Not Suitable For Children,  Death at a Funeral (original not American remake) and other movies.  You're biggest name would be Olivia Newton John, the bride's mother who hasn't been in much in the last few decades but obviously became an icon in the late 70's and 80s with Grease and other films.  She does a really good job in this one and isn't afraid to make fun of herself.  In fact all the actors are prepared to do scenes that make them look stupid or embarrassed, which is what really makes this work, all the scenes where a situations makes each characters uncomfortable, or takes them out of their comfort zone time and time again.

A Few Best Men is a lot of fun, it's something a lot of comedies try and be, that is simply, it's funny!  Basically it's a culture clash in that the bride's family are a well to do upper class (dad is a senator) rich family and the groom's friends are typical British lads, into getting drunk who haven't really grown up yet. A lot of important Australians and politicians of course are attending the wedding. Although the British lads don't want to make things difficult for the groom, they just keep getting themselves into worse and worse scenarios, not helped by a night getting wasted on the eve of the wedding involving a ram which has been vital to the father's election plans over the years, which followed earlier in the day a stop at a weird drug dealers house one of them had got the name of, to buy some weed that didn't go as planned.",1371600000,3,2160,4.371571072319202
5168387,5,B008KCGB30,"Xavier Samuel (TWILIGHT, ANONYMOUS, NEWCASTLE, ETC.) is on vacation in Australia where he meets the love of his life. She is the daughter of a Senator who would like her to take his place when he shortly retires (a future complication for a planned marriage). Samuel proposes, she accepts, he returns to England before coming back to Australia for the upcoming nuptials. Back in England, Samuel encounters the rainy weather of London and is soaked by the time he gets back to his domicile.
Once home, he peels off his wet clothes and proceeds to walk stark naked into either a living room or bedroom (it's not quite clear) only to encounter a surprise ""welcome home"" from a horde of family and friends. The stunned and embarassed Samuel anxiously covers himself and retreats from the laughing mob who are also busy taking pictures with their cell phones - a supposedly humorous portent of things to come. Get the picture?

Once Samuel recovers, he announces his wedding plans to his ""best friends"" who immediately announce that they will accompany him back to Australia. Samuel does not appear to be especially pleased over the prospect - with good reason. This is a motley crew. From then on, in a kind of ""Wedding Crashers"" scenario, things begin to rapidly unfold for the worse - hilarious at times, a bit shocking at others, crude, lude, and entertaining all at the same time.

What could have turned into a French Farce, however, is saved by the acting of the handsome and talented Samuel (who plays it straight) and the presence of Olivia Newton-John as the bride to be's
sympathetic and jovial mother. From a misguided speech by one of his ""best friends"" at Samuel's wedding to a convoluted situation with a ram, the movie progresses at a rapid pace to its predictable conclusion. Yet, this is not a trite story. Friendships are tested and endure, love prevails, and a great deal of self discovery for all comes about. The fun is ""getting there"". If you are not offended by particular language, references to certain sexual body parts, homosexual jokes, and the actions of those who appear more like a ""bull in a China shop"", this movie's for you. It does have substance as well as bawdy humor. Unfortunately, a limited theatrical release and a lack of sufficient advertising did not help this film achieve any heights. It deserved better.",1371427200,4,2346,4.804455445544554
5168388,4,B008KCGB30,"I shouldn't be surprised after Olivia's performance in Sordid Lives - both the movie and the TVseries.  But in this one, Olivia is playful and gets into some wicked fun.  It was joy to see her cut loose.  The movie is absolutely hilarious and Olivia is a charm in this goofball mix of weddings, goats, a drug dealer and more!",1362614400,2,325,4.383333333333334
5168389,4,B008KCGB30,The title about says it all.  I enjoyed the movie and Olivia Newton-john being in it was the ONLY reason I paid such a high price for a single Blu-Ray movie.,1360454400,2,157,4.064516129032258
5168390,5,B008KCGB30,"An in-law of mine is Austrailian and introduced me to this film. I liken it to films like ""The Hangover"". It's off-the-wall and funny. By the way, Olivia Newton John is in this film and she's great in her role! Get your hands on this one if you can.",1354406400,4,249,4.1020408163265305

5168397,5,B008KCGB30,"Maybe I've become easier to please in my old age but I thought that this movie was seriously hysterical! There is no way I will single anyone out for any single terrific performance, well, Olivia Newton john is so funny as the coked up matriarch! Xavier Samuel is so wonderful as the stressed groom. The three best friends of his are sensational esp. Tom. I had some great laughs. My eyes were tearing up so much. Getting married after 12 days? Meeting the rich future in-laws? Just hysterical oh, and toss in a Ram too. Not the truck the real Ram.",1439164800,,548,4.435643564356436
5168398,5,B008KCGB30,Very good,1438732800,,9,4.0
5168399,3,B008KCGB30,An okay film for a few random laughs. They could have totally omitted the sheep ordeal - we do not want animals mistreated. I would have liked more character time for the lesbian sister and drug dealer gent that follows them back to the wedding - it just kinda all died out at the near end before it was fully tapped.,1438473600,,317,4.213114754098361
5168400,3,B008KCGB30,The trailer does not depict the movie at all.  Playing off of Rebel when she has such a small part is sort of false advertising.  The film was okay.  The comedy is bizarre with not a whole lot of hearty laughs.  It was fun to see Olivia Newton John play a blasted mother of the bride.,1437436800,,284,4.017857142857143

5168410,4,B008KCGB30,"Olivia Newton John and Rebel Wilson are the main reasons I purchased this DVD, and they did not disappoint.  The overall movie has its moments, but seems a bit stretched out, even at 90 mins.  The soundtrack with many great classic 60's and 70's gems, help the movie along.  And the ending song, ""Weightless"" by Olivia, is really great.  Definitely worth a view, but does not equal Priscilla.",1433376000,,392,4.720588235294118

Again, we have events gone awry, in a terribly, angsty, funny sort of way. And of course, just like Death at a Funeral, there is a bathroom scene with poop.

Not as funny thought as DAAF, but enjoyable nonetheless, especially with Rebel Wilson and Olivia Newton John.

Worth a watch if you enjoyed DAAF and/or British humor.",1432425600,,435,4.623376623376624

All of the little 'comedy' bits were telegraphed and have been done to death by people who could actually make it entertaining. I didn't find it funny and I'm not sure why anyone else would unless they like stupid people and lots of poop.

Olivia Newton John was the only remotely entertaining part of this movie (I didn't realize that was her until after I'd watched it and checked out the cast list on IMDB).",1431302400,,561,4.5
