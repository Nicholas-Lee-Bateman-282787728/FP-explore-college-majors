8604494,1,B00EE6C4N2,"I thought I was getting a Blu-ray with two disc that would play in the United States of America. However this product is from Russia, sound familiar. Nothing good ever comes from it. The disc refuse to work in my Xbox One S. So I had to throw it away. Without compensation so buyer beware read the label and the region specific to the United States. Why is this being sold on Amazon to people from the United States and it doesn't even work in our equipment? There are too many served party vendors on Amazon now. It's about like eBay gone bad. I can't believe they would sell this product knowing it would not work! For the first time I can honestly say I'm disappointed in Amazon. I have been a Prime member since 2012. I take these reviews very seriously. I think everyone should know about the product!!",1520812800,,807,4.386666666666667
8604495,5,B00EE6C4N2,"RED (aka Retired Extremely Dangerous) is the moniker assigned to four retired CIA operatives, and if ever there were a film that demonstrates that folks beyond retirement age are still impressively functional, this is it.  The story is adapted from the graphic novel by Cully Hamner and Warren Ellis by screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber and directed with great style by Robert Schwentke.  But has been said often, it is the brilliant cast of experienced actors that makes this film one to treasure as simply splendid entertainment. Now combining both RED 1 with RED 2 the complete response is doubly fine!

In RED 1 Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is bored in his retirement; his only point of interest is a recurrent telephone conversation regarding his pension check with an equally bored government worker Sarah Ross (Mary-Louis Parker in a role that finally gives the range of her comedic talent its due!).  Their conversations are overheard by the CIA - William Cooper (Karl Urban) and his boss Cynthia Wilkes (Rebecca Pidgeon) - and Frank is marked for assassination. Bu told frank is wily and outsmarts and out shoots his intruders, escapes to take Sarah away from her boring desk job and a caper begins.  It seems there is a plot to uncover the USA Vice President's involvement in a Guatemala coups and Frank seeks out his old confreres - Joe (Morgan Freeman, living in a nursing home but very alert and involved with CIA thinking patterns), Marvin (John Malkovich, a half crazy near delusional but very fine marksman living in an underground hideaway), and Victoria (Helen Mirren, living the elegant life of teas and social activities while privately still taking contract jobs to knock off bad people).  At first Sarah is perplexed by the 'abduction' on the part of Frank, but soon becomes an involved participant in the drive to expose the secret of the Vice President.  The group engages a retired Russian spy (Brian Cox) who just happens to be Victoria's old boyfriend, and together these REDs use their skills, and brains, and great humor to achieve their goal. It is the old REDs against the young CIA agents that provides the tug of war that makes the film soar.

RED 2 equals or even surpasses RED1!  This is a movie for people who enjoy sitting back and being entertained by fancy camera work, a story that has a plausible plot, smart dialog (Jon and Erich Hoeber), and now the astute direction of Dean Parisot, and most of all a cast of some of cinemas finest actors who look like they are having such a great time you don't want the at times rather silly movie to end.

The plot, twisted and turned now and then just to keep us glued, is simple that of a retired C.I.A. agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) who reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives for a global quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device. The team includes John Malkovich (absolutely hilarious role for him), Mary-Louise Parker (often stealing the show), Helen Mirren (gorgeous as ever and having the time of her life knocking off just about everybody who gets in her way). The other folks who are on varying sides of the law (nobody really plays by the rules) include Anthony Hopkins (in stellar form), Catherine Zeta-Jones, David Thewlis, Brian Cox, Byung-hun Lee (in a brilliantly choreographed martial arts role and the physique to match), Neal McDonough, and Tim Pigott-Smith among others.

No, they are not deep, but silly and funny and entertaining and an exceptionally good time. The cast sparkles in this richly colorful movie brimming over with CGI effects and impossible situations It is a pleasure to simply watch the talents of Willis/Mirren/Freeman/Malkovich/Parker/Cox interact like so many pieces of a fine Swiss watch: they obviously love what they are asked to do!  This cast deserves an ensemble award! Grady Harp, February 18",1517702400,,3844,4.869831546707504
