8142150,5,B000HXDWSC,"Watching all 3 of the included programs really gave me insight into a battle I'd heard of, but didn't know much about.

I thought it was interesting to learn that Iwo Jima's strategic significance was, that by capturing it, the American's could bomb Japan without refueling.

I recommend this DVD to any history buff.",1161043200,,317,4.851851851851852
