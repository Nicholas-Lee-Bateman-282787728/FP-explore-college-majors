632261,5,6303382959,"I originally had to watch this for a University class, but after seeing it I couldn't stop raving about it!  In a class studying your average 'sword&sandal' Roman spectacle, this movie had the class and lavish sets and costumes of Old Hollywood combined with a fresh humour that seems never to have tarnished.  Claudette Colbert, I must admit, I'd never heard of before, but she was stunning in the title role.  It was obvious that she had fun with it, and there isn't anything I like better to see!  Definitely recommended for a good popcorn and couch night!",1018051200,5,559,4.673469387755102
632262,4,6303382959,"Claudette Colbert isn't really an actress you'd expect to find playing the Queen of the Nile, but she and her co-stars make the 1930s film version a lot more entertaining than the mammoth Elizabeth Taylor version ever was: playing with tongue firmly in cheek from a very high-flown script indeed, they make CLEOPATRA a very entertaining show.
Although the film holds true to stereotypes rather than fact, it is consistent in its presentation of ancient Egypt, and everything looks and sounds like it belongs together.  The 1930s costumes and sets (which refrence earlier Deco interpretations of Egyptian motif rather than the originals themselves) are lavish, and they lend a great deal of fun to the slightly whoopsie nature of the performances.  If you're looking for a serious, historical Cleopatra, you won't find her in de Mille's over-the-top film--but it is a LOT of fun!",1008374400,7,878,5.090277777777778
632263,4,6303382959,"Cecil B. DeMille approached Claudette Colbert for playing the title role in this fantasia/extravaganza on the life of Queen of the Nile. Obviously, the eccentric, egotistical DeMille took his pictures too seriously & they almost always have ""camp quality"" to them - which, incidentally, make them a lot of fun to watch! The pretentious dialogue is nigh hilarious at times (audiences laughed in 1934 as well!) Like most of DeMille""s biggest pictures, CLEOPATRA didn't exactly please the pious critics, but the public ate it up! The picture going public marveled at it's lavish 'kitsch' quality and savoured it's expensive excesses (i.e. when Cleo seduces Marc Antony, there are writhing and dancing females everywhere clad in seaweed; one is whipped into naked submission by a giant slave!) Colbert's versatility is astonishing in all actuality. In the year this was filmed (1934), she had played the role of Bea in the ultrasentimental IMITATION OF LIFE and won herself an AA for falling in love with Gable in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. These are three very different roles and Colbert did each of them magnificently. Colbert never takes her interpretation of Cleo TOO seriously and she cleverly delivers her lines with tongue-in-cheek flair. Travis Banton created the lavishly daring costumes and although this flick is not exactly a history teachers' ideal, at least it didn't bore everyone to tears like the 1963 Liz Taylor epic.",996537600,6,1428,5.1594827586206895
632264,4,6303382959,"So exclaims Claudette Colbert's Cleopatra as she presses an asp to her bosom at the conclusion of this great film. Of course, the sentiment was Dryden's first, as he chose to call his play about Antony and Cleopatra's consuming relationship, ""All for Love"", but that's okay no harm done. This is a real vamp of a Cleo, with Colbert sauntering around to arouse the interest and protection of Warren William's Caesar. She falls hard for him, and thinks that Henry Wilcoxin's Antony is no great shakes at first. But after she loses her man on the fateful Ides of March, Cleo seduces Antony to retain her throne with his protection. That is a really insightful scene, as we see Wilcoxin in his cups, besotted with Colbert and falling on her neck with kisses while she looks straight ahead, emotionally unavailable--is she calculating, frigid, disgusted with herself? The interpretation is up to you.  Much better than the Liz and Dick version, this Cleopatra is sexy without being obvious and the viewer really does come away saddened by this tragedy of a woman who could find love twice but not keep it either time.",995241600,,1112,4.791666666666667
632265,3,6303382959,"CLEOPATRA. Hollywood has been telling the story for years. On a quest to see the perfect version, this comes close. But dosen't quite cut it. The best version still is, and always will be 1963's Cleopatra starring Elizabeth Taylor. This is a delieghtful version starring Claudette Colbert as Cleopatra, Warren William as Julius Ceaser, and Henry Wilcoxen as Marc Antony. Every member of the cast gives great performances! The costumes are quite racy for the 1930's, and are very breathtaking, but the black and white dosen't do thgem justice! The sets are nice, but you have to take into consideration that the technology was not as good as in 1963 or today for that matter!
Just a word to Universal when releasing this film to DVD, to do the film justice PLEASE add an extra colourized print!! This would do the film's sets and costume's justice!",984873600,4,847,4.808219178082192
632266,5,6303382959,"I am probably speaking against popular opinion, but for those who can look  beyond the flamboyance of Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra, Claudette Colbert  does far more justice to the image of Cleopatra.  Not only does she have  the perfect sultry and seductive charm, her deep, resonant voice depicts  the powerful female far better than Taylor's ineffectively weak one.",968716800,17,367,5.368421052631579
632267,4,6303382959,"Hollywood has been making this story over and over again but has yet to  equal the entertainment value of DeMille's 1934 extravaganza.  Shorter than  its counterparts, this film moves along so you won't get bored.  Yet, it  still tells the same complete story as the more famous 1963 film with Liz  Taylor.
Sexy costumes, bold Romans and very enlightened Egyptian women  (this is a pre-code film) make for grand filmaking that is exceptable for  all but the youngest family members.  I love it and have viewed my copy at  least a dozen times.  Highly recommended.",961718400,4,563,4.821052631578947

632269,5,6303382959,"This is it! A not to be missed, fairly visually stunning adaptation of the Antony/Cleopatra realtionship. It tells a far better story in half the time of the Burton/Taylor epic of the 60's. I recomend this highly!!!!!!!!!!!!  :-)",927417600,2,229,5.026315789473684
632321,4,6303382959,"Cecil B. DeMille pulls out all of the stops in this big budget costume drama that was nominated for an Academy Award.  The film stars one of DeMilles regulars, Claudette Colbert, who he also featured in the risqu The Sign of the Cross.

In 48 B.C., Cleo and her younger brother, Ptolemy jointly rule Egypt in North Africa.  The Prime Minister Pothinos (Leonard Mudie), is working for Ptolemy and takes Cleopatra to the desert along with her aide, Apollodorus (Irving Pichel) and left to die.  They hear that Julius Caesar (Warren William), the ruler of Rome and most of the known world at the time, was coming to Egypt to make demands about contributions to Rome as well as decide on the sole ruler.  Cleo and Apollodorus hike back to town.  Apollodorus disguises himself as a bearer of gifts and gets an audience with Caesar carrying a large carpet.  As Caesar is about to anoint the young prince the sole ruler of Egypt, the carpet is rolled out and so is Cleopatra, wearing her best Princess Leia bikini.

Before I go much further, let me add that this was the last movie of this era that was released before the Hays (censorship) Code was put into effect.  Stories suggest that DeMille wanted to tantalize the censors and loaded up the film with plenty to talk about.  Certainly modest by modern standards, the film is flush with comely young women in skimpy outfits including the vexing Cobert.  In fact the film opens with an obviously naked woman with strategically placed dark shadows.

The story is similar to the famous remake starring Elizabeth Taylor decades later.  Cleopatra cozies up to Caesar and he makes her the sole ruler instead of her brother.  Cleopatra charms Caesar to the point he is convinced they can rule the Roman Empire together.  Her womanly charms along with a promise of conquering India make this all seem to be a perfect match.  When Caesar and Cleopatra return to Rome to make the announcement that they will marry and rule together, it takes many by surprise, not the least of which is Caesars wife, Calpurnia (Gertrude Michael).

As the story goes the Roman Senate want no part of a king, queen or emperor so they murder Caesar as he was about to deliver his speech.  Cleo skedaddles back to Egypt and Marc Antony and Octavian are put in joint control.  They are much different.  Antony is gregarious and loved by the people and his army.  Octavian, Caesars nephew, is clamoring for his own power.  The two don't like each other much.

The Senate want Cleopatra returned, tried and executed for her crimes.  I guess this is for influencing their leader, which must be a crime.  Antony pledges to go get her.  Once he arrives in Egypt, he commands that Cleopatra meet him in the town center.  She doesnt of course, so he goes to get her, parked on her barge.  Nice try Antony.  Cleopatra certainly has a way with men and Antony is not immune.  This is where DeMille is at his best with plenty of seductive women, dancing and cavorting about.  There is plenty of wine, women and song.  Antony is smitten.

When Octavian hears of this, he accuses Antony of treason and sends his army to get the lovers.  Antony is surprised that his own generals and army will not follow him, so he and the Egyptian army fight the Romans to no avail.  Antony is mortally wounded and Cleopatra, with capture and death imminent, does it her way.  With the bite of a poisonous asp.

Like many films of this era, there is plenty of lame dialog and the movie certainly has a gossipy, soap opera feel to it.  Still, there is something about the extravagance and the sensuality of the film that makes it worthwhile.  It is a much shorter and slightly better version of its better known remake.",1485216000,3,3704,4.596946564885497
632322,5,6303382959,"Nobody could do spectacle like Cecil B. DeMille, whose name is synonymous with big-budget, lavish historical and Biblical epics, even though he only made six of these: The Ten Commandments (1923), The King Of Kings (1927), The Sign Of The Cross (1932), Cleopatra (1934), Samson And Delilah (1949) and The Ten Commandments (1956). Nine-and-twenty years before Twentieth Century Fox, Joseph L. Mankewicz, Elizabeth Taylor and company dazzled audiences with their slightly more risqu and even bigger epic portrayal of CLEOPATRA, master showman Cecil B. DeMille showed us yet again the depths of his unique talent and impeccable craftsmanship, which he would out-do with his final motion picture (which would also be his most successful): The Ten Commandments.

The acting is top-notch, the direction is absolutely wonderful, and the visuals are nothing short of amazing, astounding, and absolutely epic. The script is perfection itself. DeMille felt that the most important ingredient in any picture was story, story, story, and he would sit in conferences with the writers, and decide what to leave out, because Cleopatra's life was so full of intrigue that it would be too long for a cinematic photoplay (see the Trivia section of the Internet Movie Database site for more information on the original cut of the 1963 film and how studio interference most likely destroyed what was probably a better version of the truncated cut released to cinemas).

Special features: Feature-length commentary by F.X. Feeny and three too-short, but informative featurettes on Claudette Colbert, Cecil B. DeMille and the beautiful Hays Production Code, and the theatrical trailer.

I highly recommend this picture. Very well done. Watch the 1912 silent version starring Helen Gardner, this epic version, the even more famous 1963 version and the VHS and DVD editions of the 1999 television miniseries starring Leonor Varela, Billy Zane and two-time 007 Timothy Dalton.

The Blu-ray transfer is fairly stunning (for an 82-year-old film). It may even look superior to what was seen on the silver screen in 1934! Minor flaws expected to be seen in movies from this era are present, but the crisp blacks, greys, and whites present a diverse range and are free of sharpening corrections. Claudette Colbert looks fantastic!

The 40-page booklet included with the steelbook is insightful and rich with prime stills from the film.

Special features:
1. Commentary, same as the Universal Studios 75th Anniversary Edition DVD release of Cleopatra.

2. Cecil B. DeMille: Hollywood's Epic Director (~10 minutes), narrated by USC Film Historian Richard Jewel, Patricia King Hanson from the American Film Institute, and Cecil B. DeMille's granddaughter, Cecilia Presley.

3. Claudette Colbert: Queen of Silver Screen (~10 minutes)

4. Forbidden Film: The Production Code Era (~10 minutes), about the blasted Hays Code that took some of the fun out of movies, not strictly implemented until 1934 (I believe after Cleopatra was released). Things like ""Illegal drug traffic must never be presented"" and, ""In general passion should so be treated that these scenes do not stimulate the lower and baser element.""",1460764800,,1448,5.166666666666667

632432,5,6303382959,"Long before anyone had heard of the name ""Liz Taylor"", legendary director Cecil B. DeMille (say his name with respect) decided to do his own take on the age-old tale of Antony and Cleopatra. Although the more familiar film is much longer (and more historically accurate) this golden oldie does the story justice. With huge, lavish sets and hundreds of extras (DeMille's trademark), we see unfold Cleopatra's (Claudette Colbert) love affair/power struggle with Julius Caesar ( Warren William), and later, after his fateful run-in with a roomful of trigger-happy Senators, with Marc Antony ( Henry Wilcoxon). Admittedly, Colbert was a real looker back then. Her ""period"" outfits (scandalous at the time, fairly tame by today's standards) wouldn't look out of place today on a beach somewhere or perhaps at Carnivale. If old-school Hollywood is your thing, look no further.",1411948800,3,870,5.266187050359712

Best film of hers as far as I am concerned although the story line is a bit stretched in places, plus the always showing some historical persona's on film as always white.  But what can you expect.  I would like to see more accurate reflection of history figures based on race.  But I am not keen on changing race in films that have original culture identification only to bring a culture.  May work, but geez, you might as well change all the characters culture if you are gonna rewrite history.  Just my opinion and sorry if I offended anyone.  I can remember the days when I was privileged white with other cultures in America in the back seat.  That was never cool to me.  But I didn't know the difference back then.  Did watch movies in theatres in the segregated section with my nanny whom I loved dearly and wished she were here today.  Did that make me special.  Heck no.

The copy is in excellent condition having been fully restored and the acting is first rate and one realises that even though these films are now very old they stand up wonderfully in terms of their pure cinematic quality. One thing I admire is the fact that the cast of thousands are actually people not computer generated. Hurrah for the employment opportunities!
The sets are terrific and the plot is okay, a bit hokey in parts but one big plus is that it does run under two hours unlike another Cleopatra. The battle scenes are somewhat stilted when looked at in this day and age, but when one considers how the special effects would have been achieved they are wonderfully inventive. I particularly enjoyed Claudette Colbert as the title heroine and one other thing I have noticed and admired with this film and others from the same era is that the slave/dancing girls look like real women. I love that. I was surprised at how good Warren William was having never seen or heard of him before. He could easily hold his own with any contemporary leading man. Henry Wilcoxon was a favourite of C B DeMille as of course was Claudette Colbert and they too give reasonably timeless performances. Cleopatra's Galley is a thing of wonder. Terrific.

The story line is a little pompous, the dialogue is a little thin by modern standards. And there is a lot of over acting, again.. by today's standards. However, in the Golden Age of films, this was a winner!  The escapism is here, one could dream away all day of being a glamourous movie actress from the 1930's.

The lavish costumes, alone are worth seeing this movie. The fact that this film has withstood time and destruction from the movie theatres at all, is a testament to its greatness. Claudette Colbert, is campy, vampy, fun and smart. As she portrays in most of her films. Ms. Colbert, is fascinating and cheerful to watch, she is lovely and seductive.

She plays her part very well. She makes the most of her skimpy costumes and uses them to get her man... I loved it so much, I searched and searched for it.

632528,4,6303382959,"De Mille's Cleopatra is much more fun than you'd expect, played as much for deliberately camp comedy as for spectacle and a lot pacier at 104 minutes than the Elizabeth Taylor version. Warren William plays Caesar as De Mille himself, Henry Wilcoxen plays Anthony as an oaf and Claudette Colbert takes centerstage as the kind of vixen who knows which side of the Roman Empire her bread is buttered. At times De Mille's tongue is firmly in his cheek - not least a wonderfully drawn out death scene from Leonard Mudie that wouldn't look out of place in Carry On Cleo or Cleo's spectacular seduction of Tony on that fabled barge - but there's some fine filmmaking here too, not least a great battle montage padded out with footage from the silent Ten Commandments and a fine bit of censor baiting as a foreground hand ostensibly playing the harp seems to almost paw at Colbert's body. It ain't history but it is fun. Nice score from Rudolph Kopp too.

It's worth seeking out the special edition release which, while not overloaded with extra features, does offer a bit more than other editions: audio commentary by F.X.

632530,4,6303382959,"First and foremost, Cecil B. DeMille was a showman and although his films don't stand up to close scrutiny, they were almost always entertaining! This film is another in a long line of lavish, gaudy, and campy spectaculars. At this point, I doubt that if historians were able to give us a real and honest account of the life of Cleopatra, it would pale compared to the myth that Hollywood has projected throughout the years!
Claudette Colbert portrays her with just the right amount of aplomb to make the character interesting, even though much of the dialogue is enough to give you a case of the giggles! I'm sure there were audiences at the time of it's initial release that thought the script was campy, long before ""Campy"" was in our dictionary. Henry Wilcoxon, who would become a DeMille regular, plays Marc Antony. Henry was not that good of an actor, and he has two facial expressions in this, stern, and not so stern. But he and Colbert looked good together, and I guess that was what DeMille wanted.
I gave it 4 stars because this movie is so much fun, and despite it's flaws, it's immensely watchable! And yes, the film definitely shows it's age, but that's also part of the fun. So if you're viewing it for Claudette, or for the spectacle, you're going to be entertained either way!

P.S. The print is in good condition considering it's age!",1327190400,19,1352,4.609958506224066

632532,5,6303382959,"Claudette Colbert was a true Queen of the Silver Screen. She did such a beautiful job as Cleopatra that this Film desrved to recieve an Oscar nomination. She was so beautiful that she graced Magazines and advertisements for years to come. Warren William was amazing as Caesar and the portrayal of his assassination was breathtakng. The scenes of her and Marc Anthony in the Royal Barge are amazing and they show DeMille's passion for detail as a Director. When one sees this Movie you know that you are seeing a true canvas portrait of how Cleopatra lived and how those who came in contact with her were bewitched by her presence.
I want to get the DeMille Collection which includes this Film and The Sign of the Cross which has Claudette as the wicked Roman Empress. That Film is also in dealing with the phychopathic attitudes of Nero and how the early Christians suffered.

But it was surprisingly well done with interesting historical scenes, beautiful Egyptian boats and antic costumes. Although Liz Taylor Cleopatra's surpassed all other movies with its costs, this earlier film was not cheap also. The action was fast, actors good.
My biggest complain - the makeup of all the women including Cleopatra was definitively from 30-es, so they did not look really like Egyptian women from 2 th. years ago but rather like women from 30-es in masquerade costumes. Men looked much more realistic, but women makeup was not good.

The whole movie production seems to have been more inspired by the Ziegfield Follies than ancient Rome and Egypt. I was particularly entranced by the leopard girls' charming dance performance, and the way, way, way over the top theatrical production of the countless attendents in Cleopatra's boudoir on board her yacht in drawing the curtains over Mark Anthony and Cleopatra with flower petals falling profusely from the ceiling as they retire to her bed only to have the film cut away to the oars stroking back and forth. I'm still struggling to figure out what the shag carpet wall covering behind Cleopatra as she met with Mark Anthony was trying to represent. Really, it all has to be seen and experienced to be properly appreciated. Claudet's not bad at all though, although the actors playing the Romans look and sound more like college football players.",1270080000,4,1035,4.988439306358382
632535,5,6303382959,"This movie will span all ages, as a 5 star classic. Claudette Colbert stars as Cleopatra in Black & White released in 1930's. She simply oozed sensuality on the screen & as normal for that period was much more nude & see-through on the sets. This was one hot production & the diamond bra is a landmark wardrobe piece. I can't help but hear Elizabeth Taylor saying, ""Diamond bra! No way! My breasts are the attraction in this movie!

I particularly enjoy this story because of its simplicity. The Egypt of immense uncountable wealth vs. the Rome of remorseless force & iron. Cleopatra wanted to unite the two under one man. She knew she would control any man within sight of her if she could only get him alone. The foibles of all the major characters Caesar, Marc Antony & Cleopatra make for a stirring blend of problems set against the totally foreign to each other social systems.

In the end though, it's all about love. Does it exist or is all manipulation? Is it eternal or only a passing fancy? Do I die for my love, my country, my failures or myself? This is a great rendition of this story given the strictures they had at that time. I'm glad I own it to watch when I want. Hail Caesar! 5 STARS",1265932800,7,1202,4.385650224215246

632581,3,6303382959,"After Julius Caesar became Emperor of Rome he looked towards the riches of Egypt. Cleopatra had been abducted from Alexandria to leave Ptolemy (her brother) in charge. But Cleopatra had a trick to return to meet Caesar. She also knew how to tempt him with a promise of riches. Caesar knows that gold adds to political power. Cleopatra has the right stuff to handle the plot of Plotinus. Back in Rome Brutus and Cassius worry about Caesar becoming king. The Roman aristocrats lead lives of idle luxury. There is a parade where Cleopatra enters Rome. An old man warns Caesar of the Ides of March, so does his wife Calpurnia. Caesar ignores this advice. [He obviously lacks a good intelligence service.]

The conspirators await for their rendezvous with destiny. Caesar is not the last ruler to get an early retirement. Mark Anthony will punish the murderers of Caesar, then meet Cleopatra for a friendly meeting in Tarsus. But Cleopatra lures Mark Anthony and presents entertainment. This show has excesses of mindless actions. [This seems like the stage productions of other musicals of that time.] Back in Rome Octavius speaks against Mark Anthony's vacation in Egypt. The people cheer his speeches, as they did for Mark Anthony. King Herod of Jerusalem arrives with news from Rome. Octavius would be a friend of Egypt if Mark Anthony was dead. Cleopatra tests the effects of a new mixed drink on a condemned prisoner.

Then Octavius declares war on Egypt and Mark Anthony. Mark Anthony can redeem himself to Rome if he kills Cleopatra; but he won't. A cast of thousands march and fight in the sands with gory details. There are battles at sea between wooden ships with the use of fire. Mark Anthony's forces are defeated; he falls on his sword. Cleopatra's choices are limited, she has one last escape from Roman captivity and a painful death.",1198022400,6,1844,4.85079365079365

The last scene is great.  watch for colbert's body to slump slightly when she dies on her throne, but aparantly she has had herself tied in, so she'll be found sitting erect.  it's a great detail.  This movie isn't plot driven, although of course it's a good plot, and it really happened!  but the movie is driven more by the ""feel"" and the look and the score,so it's watchable over and over, but.......WHERE""S THE DVD?????

632583,5,6303382959,"After reading the reviews left by other AMAZON folk, I must admit that I am happy to (still) be able to view a cinematic work, using the frame of reference of its (own) time rather than that of the twenty-first century... even though this monument remains thoroughly watch-able today. I regard this film as neither Kamp(sic) nor Kitsch.

To me, whenever a film, of any era, comes close to ""opera"" , I am won-over... completely; I use ""opera"" in the sense of spectacle transcending its storyline to become something larger than itself... and this film soars.

Although of a film acting-tradition ""of the grand gesture"", most of the performances are thoroughly winning... and Henry Wilcoxen is simply STUNNING as Marc Antony... in all senses of that word. Miss Colbert equally triumphs as the young queen, wise beyond her years... ""pulling-out all the stops"" to secure her position as ruler of Egypt.

As another reviewer attests... that ""royal barge"" seduction scene, in which Cleopatra secures the devotion of Marc Antony is truly breathtaking... the most beautiful... and effortless ""abduction"" ever; the poor beguiled Roman wakes-up in Eqypt! This one, single, magically-crafted scene, on its own, warrants seeing this film.

As movie viewers, part of the experience must be acceptance and self-surrender. We must not impose our personal twenty-first century sophistication upon what we are viewing. Instead, we must accept any film on its own terms, understanding the era in which it was conceived, so much as we might be able. To do otherwise will almost invariably diminish the cinematic experience; we must allow a film to ""wash over"" us. In defense of C.B.deMille, I must cite that so many of the scenes... scenes of ""huge-ness"", were conveyed with beautiful efficiency by positioning... or ""immersing"" the camera in such a way as to capture the ""intimacy"" of that particular scene... even those scenes of battle... and that is something both practical and artistic... and very modern. It would very difficult to realistically capture the vastness of Egypt in any other way; the camera plunges us into the scene, as if the scene were unfolding around us.

I own this movie, and every so often, I indulge all over again, so if you have never seen this film, I encourage you to do so; like so many others, I am certain that you, too, will find yourself recalling the magic of this great movie, long after its viewing.

The music was so beautiful, especially when Cleo seduces Caesar on her boat floating down the Nile!  This movie wins over the remake with Elizabeth Taylor which I thought was a huge piece of nonsense.

The fluid camerawork of De Mille accuses the undeniable influence of Griffith and some shots that reminds us to Eisenstein, but De Mille bets for a reduced scope without great landscapes, trying to connect us with the felony behind political stages.

The complot against Caesar (Beware of the Idus of March), Cleopatra's suicide were made with a visible resources economy, but the script was built with admirable Symphonic approach, and so the climax sequences between Marc Anthony troops and Octavius are simply breathtaking.

The music, the artificial moon on the water, the drum the rise and fall of the oar heads.

And besides that, nobody ever looked better in a Roman helmet than Henry Wilcoxen.

And the sets are from the 30's. That may be because it was made in 1934. However I expected King Kong to come out from behind the curtain at any time.

After getting over the shock of the accents and costumes and gesticulations, it was fun to watch Cleo (Claudette Colbert) vamping Anthony (Henry Wilcoxon.) You felt like saying, ""Look out Anthony!""
