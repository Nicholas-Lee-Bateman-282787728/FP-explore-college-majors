8158920,3,B000KS0B92,"Goke: The Body Snatcher from Hell (Hajime Sato, 1968)

Every once in a while I find myself watching a movie for which my only possible reaction is ""WHAT? WHAT?"". Goke is definitely one of those movies. It's The Blob as focused through the lens of Mario Bava's spy-ploitation flicks of the sixties, or Planet of the Vampires (there's Bava again) meets Matt Helm. You be the judge.

Plot: a man (Horrors of Malformed Men's Hideo Ko, sporting a truly distressing makeup job) hijacks a plane, but his plans are sent awry when the plane collides with what would seem to be a UFO. The hijacker abducts a stewardess and tries to get away, but he's caught by the UFO and (seemingly) hypnotized. It drags him on board, where he's attacked by a creature that looks for all the world like blue snot. According to the box copy and all the reviews I've read, the blue snot transforms him into a bloodthirsty vampire, but there's really not much evidence of that; looks more like possession to me. In any case, he heads back to the plane and tries to infect the others, turning this into your basic survival-thriller. Well, until the last twenty minutes, when it becomes something else entirely, but we'd be getting way, way into spoiler territory by then.

It's low-budget psychedelia with a downright weird plot, the usual political incorrectness one expects to find in a sixties flick, and a tacked-on ending that makes me wonder what everyone involved in this production was smoking. How can you not be wowed by something like this? (Note I do not assume ""wowed"" is a positive thing.) It's just... something else. Really. ** ",1228521600,2,1615,4.716312056737588
8158921,5,B000KS0B92,Awesome piece of Japanese Sci fi.  Creepy mind controlling aliens terrorize a downed passenger plane group of survivors.  They turn on each other and they start killing each other off one by one.  Great movie.,1211155200,2,209,4.914285714285715
8158922,5,B000KS0B92,"With visuals inspired by Mario Bava, this intelligent and bizarre tale of Japanese plane crash survivors terrorized by aliens who take over their minds and bodies is a ""cut above"" due to its unusually intelligent treatment of the subject matter, a predominant anti-war subtext that's unheard-of and wholly absent from the Saturday matine giant monster flicks churned out by Toho during this period (late 60's), and its ability to be just plain bizarre on many levels. Yet despite its extreme strangeness and surreal qualities, it manages to be accessible and entertaining.

An obscure and seldom seen (in the US) treat for Japanese sci-fi fans. Picture an alien invasion sci-fi film, shot in Japan by Mario Bava, with Japanese-school special effects, from a script by Kafka. If you don't know it already, this film is a fave of Tarintino who aped the infamous ""blood red sky"" opening of this film for Kill Bill Vol. 1.

Very Strange but entertaining film.",1194048000,2,955,5.0
