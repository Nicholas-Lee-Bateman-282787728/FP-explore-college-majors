8315598,5,B00199PPBK,"Tells the story of 1 of 3 ""little goddesses"" and a ""big goddess"" of the Buddhist religion in Nepal before the and during the revolution of 2005. I loved the historic aspects of the film. It did not, however, examine what happened to the godesses after the fall of the Nepali president. The goddesses were tied to the President and seen as the power behind the president by Buddhists.",1416441600,2,383,4.565217391304348
8315599,5,B00199PPBK,"Yes, this movie is about 3 ""living goddesses,"" although only one gets much screen time.  Yes, the film contains shocking scenes of animal sacrifice. But the other reviewers missed the main idea that the film-maker wants to get across.

I'm sure the film-maker went to Nepal to make a documentary about the Living goddesses of Nepsl.  And while he was in Nepsl making that film, something extraordinary happened -- a revolution took place!

What's a revolution like? We had one here in America about 200 years ago. I assume it waa similar to the one we see in this film: bloody, noisy, confusing and difficult to understand without a scorecard.  That's what revolutions are like, until historians, textbook writers and advertisers get ahold of them 50 years later.

In Living goddess you get to see revolution unadorned.

A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another.

8315601,1,B00199PPBK,"What a messed up documentary. We get to see cows, goats, and chickens beheaded *with no warning*. Also, is the idiot documentary about the civil war or the little girls? Neither story line is well represented, much less blended together to form a nice flow.",1325635200,3,257,4.733333333333333
8315602,4,B00199PPBK,"This is a good documentary about the phenomenon of child goddesses in Nepal, focusing on the intersection of politics and religion during the final days of the monarch Gyanendra Shah's reign.  The filmmakers' sympathies with the people of Nepal are clear, but they are also very close to their subjects whose loyalties are torn and who express some trepidation about the role religion will play in a democratic Nepal.  The result is a film that's balanced, objective and sensitive even as it raises critical issues.

Of the three goddesses portrayed, the portrait of the young Sajani Shakya is particularly intimate.  We see her interact with her family as a child, and we also see her fulfilling her duties as a goddess.  Some of the scenes are humorous and endearing.  The movie, however, is not for children.

Graphic scenes of animal sacrifice will be shocking to Western audiences, especially young children, as will scenes of violence in the streets.  For older children who may be interested, adult supervision is recommended.",1320019200,6,1033,5.071005917159764
8315603,5,B00199PPBK,"Living Goddess examines the Hindu tradition of Kumaris, or living goddesses, young girls who are believed to be incarnations of a deity until they reach puberty. The filmmakers travel to Nepal to examine this phenomenon, taking a look at the life of Sajani, an 8 or 9 year old girl believed to be the incarnation of the Goddess Taleju.

If it seems to be a bit slow paced at first, with its long takes of daily routine, it's for good reason: Nepal is a country with a way of life, a politics, and a culture that is utterly unfamiliar to most of this film's viewers, and to move any faster would be to miss a great deal. The Kings of Nepal have traditionally relied on the goddesses as justification of their rule by divine right. In the midst of a Maoist insurgency against an autocratic King, the role of the living goddess has only come under greater scrutiny. Lengthy takes of protests and riots are interspersed with religious ritual and the Sajani's daily life. The filmmakers go to great lengths to point out that despite her status as a deity, Sajani is just a normal girl; she loves playing with toys, running around with her friends, and pestering her parents. Her life is extraordinary and rather mundane at the same time, and the film draws you in through the travails of its charming main character.

Nepal recently abolished its monarchy and became a republic, so it is possible that this tradition may die out as politics and religion begin to disentangle. Living Goddess is an informative and thoughtful portrait of an unusual element in Hinduism, a faith already alien to most Westerners.  The film has stunning visuals, making full use of the colorful traditions and natural beauty of Nepal. By taking a look at an unorthodox part of Hindu South Asian culture, Living Goddess examines the conflict between tradition and modernity, religion and politics.",1217980800,14,1870,4.765432098765432
