2807341,5,B000P1YNA2,"pros:
- well known moves with a twist - you won't get bored
- encouraging and friendly instructor
- decent calories burn - my HM showed 200 kcal
- knee-friendly ( I only had to modify twice - jumping scissors and jumping  jacks )
cons:
- changes between the exercises in the weight training phase are very quick, but I guess you won't have a problem with it after you've done the workout a couple of times
I'm definitely going to buy the other two DVDs in the series!!",1191196800,4,468,4.258426966292135
2807342,5,B000P1YNA2,"I am fairly new to DVD workouts. I learned about Michelle Dozois from the Shape Bikini Body DVDs (my first exercise DVDs). The main reason I purchased this DVD was for the sculpting exercises, and it has exceeded my expectations!  The DVD comes with a blue resistance band. I was impressed with the quality of the band (it is excellent in comparison to the green band sent with the Shape DVDs). The upper body work on this DVD is awesome, I look forward to seeing the results.

There are two workouts.  The first consists of 7 circuits and lasts almost an hour.  The second is an express workout and lasts a little more that 30 min. You have the option of creating your own workout by choosing between the 7 circuits.

You need two sets of weights, heavy and moderate.  I used 8 lbs and 5 lbs because that's all I have.  My fitness level is intermediate (closer to advanced than beginner) and the weights seemed a bit light.  I plan on getting a set of 10 lbs for heavy and 7 lbs for moderate.  The resistance band exercises are a bit challenging - which is definately a good thing (the results will be long lean muscles!). I recommend this for all fitness levels, as it offers modifications for beginners.",1190419200,7,1206,4.445454545454545
2807343,5,B000P1YNA2,"I have alot of workout DVDs from many different instructors and this is one of the best workouts I have ever done! The above reviewer did a great job of breaking down and explaining the workout so I won't repeat it.
  Michelle Dozois is a true professional,her cuing is excellent,the production is beautiful and the music very upbeat and motivating. The Express feature is wonderful for time crunched days. The ladies in the workout are busy moms,'real' people,their stories are very inspiring. There is simply no way that, combined with a sensible,portion controlled eating plan, you will not get great results doing this workout.
  This is the first workout in The Your Body Breakthru series with two additional titles to be released in September. I will definitely be the first in line to purchase them when they are released.
  I can't say enough great things about this workout! It's so much fun,very refreshing with new moves I have not seen in any other workout,the cardio steps are easy to learn. It's PERFECT! I highly recommend this workout,perfect for beginners to advanced exercisers,you advance simply by increasing your weights. Michelle uses BOTH dumbbells and a resistance band in this workout,which I loved,you truly get the benefits of both types of training. AWESOME!!",1187049600,7,1287,5.075829383886256
2807344,5,B000P1YNA2,"I really love Michelle Dozois as an instructor.  She's friendly, encouraging, a good cuer and easy to listen to.  She leads a group of four exercisers in this circuit routine.  You can start by watching a small introduction and then can either do the full workout or an express one.
It's high energy all the way and with good music and a fun set, it's motivating.  She uses intervals of intense aerobics alternating with body sculpting in 7 circuits.  Each circuit targets a different area of the body and almost no muscle is left untouched.  This is an easy workout to follow as she lets you know in good time, what's coming up next.  All the equipment you need is some weights and the dynaband that comes with this (mine is a great purple band).  I have to say that it's nice for a change to see 'real' people working out on the dvd.  Not all are size 0's which is great to see.
I really love this new workout and I've done it three times already and found it challenging but fun and as long as you are somewhat fit already, you'll find it easy to do but still feel the burn the next day.  I really love this and highly recommend it.",1186531200,15,1135,4.261682242990654
2807345,5,B000P1YNA2,"Your Best Body Circuit is part of the Your Body Breakthru series by instructor Michelle Dozois.  This was my first video in the series, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  The DVD Main Menu offers the following options:  Full Workout, Express Workout, Chapters, Testimonials, More on Your Body Breakthru, Michelle's personal message, and Contact.  The Full Workout is 58-minute workout consisting of a warm-up, seven cardio/strength circuits, and a cool-down, while the Express Workout provides a shorter (35 minutes) version of this.  Equipment used includes 2 sets of dumbbells (medium and heavy) and a resistance band (Michelle and crew use a straight band, but my handled one worked fine).

Here are the chapter breakdowns:
Warm-Up
Circuit 1 (Back and Biceps 1)
Circuit 2 (Chest and Triceps 1)
Circuit 3 (Back and Biceps 2)
Circuit 4 (Chest and Triceps 2)
Circuit 5 (Shoulders w/Legs)
Circuit 6 (Legs)
Circuit 7 (Abdominals)
Cool-Down

The warm-up is just under 5 minutes long and is consists of some light aerobics plus moving stretches.  Each circuit begins with a short (2-3 minutes) cardio segment consisting of a simple series that is repeated 3 times.  The cardio sequences are performed first on 1 side of the body, then the other (ie, you do the same cardio moves for Circuits 1 and 2, but your start on your right leg for 1 and then move to your left leg for 2).  The cardio is fairly basic, with moves such as jacks, lunges, and knee lifts, but the addition of some punches and kicks adds a kickboxing flavor.  Although there is a bit of impact to some of the exercises plus a few plyometric moves such as power jacks, one of the four background exercisers always shows a low-impact option (I chose to follow the modifier at times and still had no problems keeping my HR in my target zone).

I especially enjoyed the strength work for assorted reasons.  First of all, the exercises were quite varied and different, especially the band work.  However, Michelle also offered new twists on more traditional exercises, such as lowering into a squat, pulsing while lifting one foot, and then raising back up.  For further variety, Michelle varied the count of the exercises, doing 2-2, 4-1, 1-4, etc. (similar to Jari Love's Ripped workouts).  Furthermore, I liked that there was a functional fitness component to many of the moves, with twisting exercises like the wood chop as well as balance work.  I also appreciated the strong emphasis on back work, as this is an area that is often overlooked.  The only complaints I had about the weight segments were that 1) Michelle moves very quickly, sometimes making it difficult to set up the next move in time (particularly when working with the band), and 2) in Circuit 2, there was a push-up series that was extremely challenging--although a modification was shown, the difficulty level of this exercise seemed out of proportion with the rest of the workout.

I consider myself to be an advanced intermediate exerciser, and I found this workout to be perfect for both my level and my preferences.  However, given both that modifications are shown and that you can always vary the amount of weights used (I used mainly 8# and 10# dumbbells), I think that this DVD would appeal to a wide range of exercisers, from advanced beginners to intermediates to those at a full advanced level.  Michelle has done an excellent job in creating a challenging workout that is both interesting and fun to do; highly recommended!",1182902400,69,3492,4.845117845117845
2807347,4,B000P1YNA2,"I was skeptical to buy this DVD cause I didn't like Michelle the Shape Magazine Workout DVD's she did but this workout is descent. My only complaint is that she repeat alot of moves and she focused more on upperbody than legs and abs. Although, I loved some of the band moves they worked awesome.",1246838400,,296,4.4
2807348,5,B000P1YNA2,"I love this DVD.  I use this more than any other DVD I have because it is so well balanced.  I feel like I get a very effective cardio workout along with a really good weight training/sculpting workout.  Lots of different sections and uses several moves that were new to me, so it keeps me interested.  Michelle explains everything well and the moves aren't too complicated.  She is not one of those annoying instructors, but has a good, motivating demeanor.  I don't have one negative thing to say about this.  I just love it so much and wish everyone would try it!",1245628800,2,566,4.490196078431373
2807349,1,B000P1YNA2,"I usually read the reviews for products, but rarely write them.  This DVD made me want to find a place to review it- I was nearly yelling at the computer screen for the first 20 minutes of the full workout, then I just skipped to the end to do ab work & cool down.
I'm new to workout videos so maybe this is common, but she created and switched moves so fast that by the time I understood what she was doing she had already moved on.  This did not make me feel as though 'everyone could do it,' it made me feel slow and out of shape (which I am not).  It also made me feel as though I had never actually 'worked out' from ANY of the moves because of my confusion.  I also did not have the 'props' I was expected to use, which seemed almost mandatory to the workout.
All in all, I have found other (cheaper) videos which are amazing in comparison and do not frustrate me so completely.  Check it out from your local library before spending the money.",1243987200,,949,4.108108108108108
2807350,5,B000P1YNA2,"I really like this video so far, but I have only done the express workout (35 minutes).  I bought it because I had a video that Michelle did a while back (VHS!) called Pilates Plus that I really liked AND it had really good reviews.  I like that there is aerobic, weights, floor work and resistance band work.  It is very well rounded - I guess that is why it is called circuit - duh.  You can make it easier or more difficult depending on your condition.  I liked it so much that I also bought the cardio video to alternate with this video every other day.",1238803200,,557,4.168224299065421
2807351,5,B000P1YNA2,"I recently purchased this video in the hope of getting a change from using a step, treadmill, and elliptical. I did the express workout this morning and burned 350 calories in 35 minutes!!!  I never got bored.  I consider myself to be intermediate/advanced exerciser. I was exhausted, but felt fully worked out.",1234828800,2,311,4.961538461538462
2807352,5,B000P1YNA2,"I currently own about 50 fitness DVDs and over the course of the last 10 years have owned probably over 120 (got rid of many).  I am an upper intermediate exerciser.  This is one of the very best workouts I have owned.  It is challenging (but not to the point of wiping me out), fun, with interesting and some unique exercises, nice variety alternating between cardio and strength segments, and alternating strength exercises between free weights and the band.  When I am finished this workout, I feel completely and thoroughly worked out and yet energized.  The music is decent and Michelle is an excellent instructor.  My only criticism is that although her instruction is excellent, Michelle is a little hyper/manic and loud in this video which grates on my nerves a bit, and the occasional ""whooping"" from her background exercisers sounds like yipping chiuhuahas and is a bit annoying too.  But those things can be easily overlooked for such a great workout.  Highly recommended!",1231977600,2,983,4.951219512195122
2807353,5,B000P1YNA2,"I really like Michelle Dozois's Body Breakthru DVD's.  Great workouts, great instructor.  They're an hour long each with an option for an express workout.  I felt challenged in new ways (use The Firm a lot) but not overwhelmed.
The included resistance band(I purchased the 3 DVD's as a set)broke the first time I used it.",1229731200,,321,4.8
2807354,5,B000P1YNA2,"It is just what it says: a circuit.  You move quickly from warm-up to cardio (right side) to weights to cardio (left side) to weights.  She suggests 2 sets of weights one light (up to 8 pounds) and one heavy (12-15) but I started out with one set of 5 pound weights.  You will also need a mat or towel for some of the circuits or a carpeted floor.  I find it really easy to work at my own current level she has ways to make the workout easier and more intense.  I have two left feet so I like the simpler moves in this video. (A few took me a while to get used to) What caught me up at first is that you move to the right side several times and then the left. It is about a hour long and I feel you get the best of both worlds.  A little cardo and strength training combined if there were more stretching in it (like her pilaties plus video) it would be perfect.
There is also a 30 minute workout on the DVD for when you are short on time.  She uses real people in her video that have effectiveley used her program.  She also has a diet plan on her website for anyone who gets her Body Breakthru videos.  Her attitude is positive without being really annoying.  The weight/strength segments basically move from shoulders, back, arms, legs and core.  There are several different cardio segments for variety.  The cardio segments are mostly kicking (forward and back), punching, and jumping (one of the girls shows the low impact alternative).
There are some lunges, squats, and crossover moves (reaching across the centerline of your body).  On most of it you increase your intensity by simply moving your arms higher or increasing your jump height and, of course, getting a heavier weight.
I think this video will work for all fitness levels.  You can start out with a light weight or no weight and doing fewer reps at first.  But like anything it is easier with time.  I haven't done a workout video yet that I could easily do at first.",1227312000,,1937,4.32409972299169
2807355,5,B000P1YNA2,"Most of my fitness DVD collection consists of Michelle's work-outs. I am very pleased to add this new one, plus it came with a FREE exercise band. This DVD allows you to pick the full work-out (58 min.), express version (35 min.), or even the option to customize by selecting specific target groups. I plan to use this once a week!",1207958400,2,331,4.442622950819672
2807356,5,B000P1YNA2,"I regularly use videos and DVD's to workout at home.  This is by far my favorite DVD to date!  It is definitely meant for an intermediate exerciser if you intend to do the entire workout, but can be shortened into individual segments for the less experienced exerciser. Michelle keeps you moving, not missing a beat while you alternate between cardio and sculpting.  I've not worked much with stretchy bands in the past, but the free band that you get with this DVD seems to be of good quality and definitely fires your muscles up if you have the tension tight enough.  Will not hesitate to purchase Michelle's other sculpting DVD when it becomes available!",1207094400,,657,4.7368421052631575
2807357,5,B000P1YNA2,"just like in her other dvds. I can only agree with the other reviewers, Michelle created a great workout. I also like that the women working out with her are women just like you and me, and they share their stories how the lost weight and/or got (back) in shape. The workout is a good challenge and I will waiting for her next dvd in that series to be released.",1206921600,,361,4.171428571428572
2807358,5,B000P1YNA2,"I typically hate weight exercises, but the weight segments and cardio segments are interspersed in a way that you don't get overly bored and/or tired with either. I kept my heart rate up for the entire workout. I would definitely recommend this workout to both beginners and intermediate exercisers.",1206403200,,299,5.122448979591836
2807359,1,B000P1YNA2,"i am getting back into working out after a few years of being pretty lazy....so i was looking for something ""easy"" and decided on this...oops! not for beginners...and way too much up and down (one minute you're doing cardio, the next minute you are on the floor and then back again). However, if you are a ""workout fool"" then this is for you!! I'm going to put this one on the back shelve for a while and come back to it when I am a little more advanced!",1206230400,4,454,4.170454545454546
2807360,5,B000P1YNA2,"I bought this DVD so I'd have something to fill in the days where I don't go to my kickboxing class and I also wanted a workout that included some toning exercises.  This workout really delivers.  The DVD includes a full ~60 minute workout and an express workout (~30 minutes).  You can also choose to do particular segments of the DVD if you don't have time for the express or full workout.  The DVD comes with a resistance band, but you'll have to buy your own weights (I use 5 lb and 8 lb weights, which I think are good to start with).  The workout has a good balance of cardio interspersed with weights/toning - it's great because your heart rate stays up during the toning segments.  I also like that you can choose your intensity.  There is always one or two women in the back that are doing lower intensity modifications.  Michelle is also great - encouraging without being annoying or overly cheerful.  All the movements are easy to catch on to, though you should keep your weights and band close by because there are some parts that transition quickly.  I highly recommend this DVD if you are trying to lose weight and/or get in shape.",1203724800,,1145,4.48792270531401
2807361,5,B000P1YNA2,"I'm a big fan of Michelle and was excited to get this video - she didn't let me down!  This video combines fun cardio with basic toning resulting in a great moderate to high intensity workout.  Of course, there are modifications, and you can vary the weight you use in the toning sections based on your level of experience.  The workout is broken into 6 circuts, plus a warm up and cool down.  The video even has a shortened 30 minute version for the days when you're running short on time.  The exercisers in the video are all clients of Michelle's.  The music and energy of the video are great and I look forward to doing this video regularly.",1202688000,,645,4.378151260504202
2807362,5,B000P1YNA2,"I absolutely LOVE this workout!  I have noticed a change in my body in just 5 weeks.  My muscles are more defined in my arms and legs, my waist is smaller, and I've lost 6 pounds!  One of the things that keeps me motivated is that the women in the video, including Michelle, are all normal people, not sports models.  At first I had a hard time getting through some of the exercies, like the push-ups, but after doing it a few weeks it has gotten easier.  Michelle is very motivating and I really enjoy working out with her!!

If you buy this DVD make sure you check out her website.  There is great info on there about nutrition and watching calories.  I printed out a nutrition packet and a workout schedule.  I highly recommend this DVD!!",1202601600,,741,4.350364963503649
2807363,5,B000P1YNA2,"I was doing a circuit training workout in my gym which I loved because it worked out my whole body and after only a few weeks I started to notice a difference. Once school started I could no longer atted and was dreading to gain back all those inches I lost so quickly.  I have some DVDs at home but they are either too challenging and hard on my knees or just plain boring and I didn't even break a sweat.  I decided to get this DVD, and last night I did it for the first time. It was incredible!! It works you out so much and it's so much fun!  it moves quickly but I know that after a couple of times I will get it and burn even more calories because I won't be wasting time to figure out what the heck I'm doing.  I only got a chance to do the long work out routine, which is about 57 minutes, and I don't know how I was going to finish it, but I did and it felt great.  Make sure that when you do it you keep your weights and bands close at hand, you might also want to have some water nearby :)",1200614400,6,1000,3.8115942028985508
2807364,5,B000P1YNA2,"This is a great workout and I highly recommend this DVD ... especially to moms who need to fit a good intense workout into their crazy lives. Michelle clearly orchestrates each move and the routines are intense, but not too complex. Typically, I would consider myself at an advanced level when it comes to circuit routines. However, I find myself getting back into the swing after a brief workout sabbatical. This workout was very challenging for me, which makes me think it is targeted more for non-beginners. This is great for those who are dedicated! There are suggested beginner moves during the sequence, which are quite helpful and not too distracting.  Enjoy!",1200096000,3,666,4.946428571428571
2807365,5,B000P1YNA2,"This DVD is just great!  I've tried many different DVDs promising to deliver something unique, but this DVD really follows through on that.  Circuit training really is the most efficient and quickest way to change the shape of your body.  It just WILL NOT happen with cardio alone.  Michelle is wonderful, she's encouraging and she somehow just makes working out fun....even when it gets tough, and it will.  When I finished the full workout (which I believe is 53 minutes or so), I showered and went to bed, I was so tired.  The first few times will really kick your butt, but you'll see results very quickly.

The only drawback I can see to this DVD (and it's not enough for it to lose a star) is that you cannot program the individual chapters to customize the workout.  You will have to individually select each circuit, return to the main menu and select the next one you want to do.  You can always march in place while you do that to keep your heart rate up.  There is also a great 35 minute express workout for days when you're crunched.",1200009600,2,1045,4.4526315789473685
2807366,5,B000P1YNA2,"I have several workout videos by Michelle Dozois, and I've never been disappointed.  When you finish this workout, you have no doubt that you've been working out.  I like that Michelle uses the heavier weights. So far, I've only been able to do the Express Workout, which is a very good total body conditioning workout.  My only complaint is that she moves so fast when going from a standing position to the mat and when switching from exercise bands to weights or vice versa.",1199491200,4,476,4.642857142857143

My body has changed shape in the past six weeks and I am now a lot more toned and leaner looking. Michelle Dozois is very motivating and I found the success stories of the women on her DVD very inspiring. In this workout, you can do the long workout which takes about 60mins or the  express workout which takes about 35 mins. They both give you a good workout and I always work up a sweat. I'm looking forward to buying more of Michelle's fitness DVDs.",1199232000,2,596,4.228070175438597
2807368,5,B000P1YNA2,Great mix of cardio and weights.  I really feel it when I'm done with this work out.  She does move through the workout fast but once you get teh steps down you'll really appreciate the fast pace.  I would highly recommend this workout video.,1198627200,6,242,4.454545454545454
2807369,4,B000P1YNA2,"I was first introduced to Michelle Dozois workouts when my mum gave me her Weight Watchers DVD for new exercisers- though that dvd was really too easy for me, I could see instantly what a great instructor Michelle is. I am a very unco-ordinated, obese exerciser, who has never had much success with overchoreographed aerobics workouts- but Michelle is different- she uses a core set of steps which she builds on, the steps are not too complicated and yet they are varied enough so you do not get bored. While I would not consider this a complete beginner's dvd- it probably isn't for the advanced either, perhaps a beginner's to intermediate rating is best. I will not list the various chapters, as a previous reviewer has already done an excellent job- but to sum up: the cardio gets your heart rate up- and the breaks of weight and resistance training (with the included band) really work your muscles but aren't so long that you cool down too much - however if you want a purely cardio heart pumping  exercise routine, this one is not for you.
If you want to get your heart rate up, burn calories, tone your arms, legs, butt, shoulders and especially your middle - this routine is for you. My only complaint is that for me the abdominals are a bit too difficult (again I am seriously overweight, so I hope I will eventually be able to do that side lying plank crunch!)
The workouts have both higher impact and lower impact variations,  and you can do the dvd in a fairly small space (3 by 5 feet or 1 by 1.5 meters or so)
The resistance and weight exercises are both easy to do and interesting enough to keep you from getting bored, however there is not much time to change between exercises, so this is a slight downside to the workout.

Michelle counts well and demonstrates/explains the moves clearly.

Overall, very enjoyable and highly recommded.",1197763200,21,1854,4.59214501510574
2807370,5,B000P1YNA2,"My wife started me on her Richard Simmons Super Sweatin' DVD, but, once I learned the routines, it became boring and wasn't nearly as strenuous as it was at first. In addition, because it was strictly dancing, there was no weight training. This caused me to alternate between aerobics one day and weights the next. Your Best Body Circuit incorporates both cardio and weight training at a pace that challenges me, but doesn't knock me out. I use 12 and 8 pound weights. I especially like the short workout option, since that's usually all I can make time for.",1197331200,4,558,4.646464646464646
2807371,1,B000P1YNA2,"This DVD workout switches moves too quickly, and it is hard to develop a rhythm.  Most moves are only repeated 4 times, then she switches to a new move.  You spend all your energy trying to figure out which move she is calling next, and it is very frustrating.  For instance, she will call for lateral squats and only do two of them, then she will switch to reverse lunges and do two, then lateral steps times two, with different arms movements with each.  This workout does not have any natural flow.  I would not waste my money on it again.",1197244800,7,542,4.326732673267327
2807372,4,B000P1YNA2,"I ordered this dvd wanting cardio...and I got it!  Michelle gets your heart rate up right away and it stays up through the entire workout.  She does move quickly between segments, but that's what makes it such a great workout--who wants to listen to an instructor drone on about the move--just do it!

I've been exercising regularly for almost a year now (am in good shape) and I haven't made it through this entire workout straight through yet--it's definitely a challenge.  The 30-minute condensed workout is great for those time-crunched days.

PRO: Heart rate up throughout workout, works entire body (you will be sore the next day)

2807376,5,B000P1YNA2,"This DVD had a good variety in the routine.  Heartrate stays up even during the toning section.  My only complaint is that it switches quickly between the toning band and the weights; too quickly until you get used to it.  But for days when I have the time for a whole 60 minute workout, I'll choose this one.  (It has a 30 minute option, which leaves out a few of the segments as well).",1191715200,,387,4.1891891891891895

8188333,5,B000P1YNA2,"I have been searching for a decent range of workout DVDs since 1994, and in most of that time, have only come across a precious few that I could repeatedly use that both challenged me enough to meet my appetite for a burn, and that I did not get bored with after so many times. Over the past few years I have discovered interval training as the way to go: more intense workouts combining strength and cardio = less time working out and faster, lasting results. Or so it seems for me. I've run through this DVD fairly consistently for over 4 years, and find it challenging enough to get a solid workout, and while I got tired of the music pretty quickly (as is the case with any workout DVD), from start to finish I find that I'm not bored but actually looking forward to each final completion because I know it's a solid range of interval levels to accomplish.

UPDATE: About 1 year ago I discovered Michelle's Peak 10 workouts and have essentially replaced this DVD for that in order to increase my level of challenge and pain, mostly because it seems more hard core and broken into more manageable chunks for when I may only have 20 minutes to get an intense work out in before headed to work or before calling it a night. I still use this (Best Body Circuit) for the days when I have an hour or more to put in the whole time or to mix up the routines. All in all, have been very pleased with the videos from Michelle Dozois!",1386979200,4,1427,4.285185185185185
8188334,1,B000P1YNA2,"Only the introduction played without a problem.  The first time I reviewed the exercise and it worked but then the next morning when I was ready to do the workout, it wouldn't play. It seemed to be stuck - I couldn't get it to do anything.  I've ordered many workout DVDs from Amazon and have never had a problem until this one.
Hopefully this was the only bad one in the bunch.",1354665600,,378,4.236111111111111
8188335,5,B000P1YNA2,"I have had this workout for several months now and I love it. I do have a rotation that I do, BUT I do go back to this one alot. You get a GREAT workout. You work your biceps,triceps,inner and outer thighs,chest,back,shoulders,booty,legs,abs and you get some good cardio. The end of the workout you get a very good stretch. I love using the band through the workout and it really is good for the stretch and cooldown as well. You get a really good stretch with it. You get alot done in 57 minutes. It also has a 35 minute short version which I have done before,and that is great as well. I think you still get a good workout in even though it's 35 minutes. I highly recommend.",1346371200,2,676,4.248062015503876
8188336,5,B000P1YNA2,All of Michelle Dozois's DVDs are great!  This one is a cardio/strength training DVD. Her Cardio DVDs are high intensity and are great for medium-advanced exercisers.,1324339200,,166,5.384615384615385
8188337,5,B000P1YNA2,"These are great workouts! I trade them off with several others including Michelle's Ultimate Workout, Insanity, Turbo Jam, and Turbo Fire. If I'm going to bother getting up early in the morning to workout, it better be worth it. I don't feel like I get my money's worth unless I'm a sweaty mess when its over! All three of these workouts are great. Michelle is great at cuing.",1309132800,,376,4.544117647058823
8188338,4,B000P1YNA2,"I checked this DVD out at the library. I was very pleased with it. I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser. I really liked the express workout (35 min) it was comprised of fun, unique intervals. This exercise is a total body workout, but it is most effective for the arms; you do several weight lifting and resistance band variations. I only gave it 4 stars because it isn't too challenging for my taste, but if you are beginner or intermediate I highly recommend this DVD. For comparison's sake, I would say it's similar to a jillian michael's workout but not quite as hard, just a little easier. Overall it's a fun and effective workout and I will purchase it for my collection.",1301529600,,683,4.560975609756097
8188339,5,B000P1YNA2,"My recent purchase was to get a 2nd copy of this dvd since 3 years of working out with Michelle Dozois' Best Body Circuit means I had worn my resistance band completely out! This is a great full body workout that gets results. I'm a huge Michelle Dozois fan and this is her all-time best workout video! I love that we do a circuit of moves, do them starting with the other side and then we move on to something new. I don't get bored or tired that way! Thanks, Michelle, for such a great workout!
