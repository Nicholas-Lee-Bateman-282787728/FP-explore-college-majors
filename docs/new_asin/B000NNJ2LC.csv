8179332,1,B000NNJ2LC,"Loved these whimsical cartoons from the 1940s and 1950s. Little Lulu was s a true scamp of a girl. I had them on VHS, but no longer have a player. I was horrified by the quality of this DVD. I think someone made it at home off of their VHS recording. SOO disappointing.",1388188800,2,269,4.09433962264151
