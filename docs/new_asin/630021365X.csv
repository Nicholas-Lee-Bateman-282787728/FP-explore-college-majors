7805770,5,630021365X,"Here's another 3rd season episode (see The Empath for another nearby example) that was refreshingly original.  The story revolves around the Medusan Ambassador who is too ugly (or is it too beautiful?) for the eye.  This episode has lots more of messages.  Beauty and ugliness will be the last prejudice for humans to conquer.  Like Spock said, the Greeks thought that everything beautiful was good and everything ugly was bad.  Don't judge a book by its cover!

Also, I liked it when Spock made a mind link with the Medusan.  The ambassador offered some lovely insights into the human condition because his usual point of view is so different.  This is the sort of thing that science fiction at its best ought to do. I just absolutely love this episode.  Season Three is the second best season!  Viva la Third Season!",1242259200,,818,4.73758865248227
7805771,4,630021365X,"One of the marvelous, unique features of Trek is that it was sometimes able to use a science fiction premise to dramatize some aspect of the human condition like nothing else could. One is reminded of racism illustrated by the half-white-half-black people of ""Let That Be Your Last Battlefield."" Here the device used illustrates the issues of inner vs. outer beauty in an extraordinary way.

The Enterprise hosts a Medusan ambassador. The aptly-named Medusans are said to have ""the most sublime thoughts in the galaxy,"" but their gaseous appearance is so ugly that the mere sight of one drives a human into suicidal insanity. The specialist who accompanies him, Miranda Jones (Diana Muldar in her second appearance) is blind, although no one knows that at first other than McCoy.

Unfortunatley, from this promising start we get an episode that plays weirdly like soap opera much of the time. An engineer with the pedestrian name ""Larry Marvik"" is in love with Miranda, who has given her life to the Medusan ambassador. Another love triangle involves Miranda's bitter jealousy of Spock for his natual affinity with the Medusan. When the Medusan indicates a desire for the Vulan mind meld, Miranda screams. A bit melodramatic, to say the least, and demeaning to her character.

What redeems the episode is the scene near the end in which the Medusan temporarily shares consciousness with Spock. (You see, the Enterprise is in a void and only the Medusan can pilot the ship to safety, but he needs the use of a humanoid body to do so.) As played by Nimoy, the ambassador is charming, witty, and engaging, offering some lovely insights into the human condition because his usual point of view is so different. This is the sort of thing that science fiction at its best ought to do.",1183075200,,1778,4.861386138613861
