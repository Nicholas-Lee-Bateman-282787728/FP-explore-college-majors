8550902,5,B00AFEYKHK,"This is truly a fascinating and remarkable DVD.  It is wonderful learning the history of Black gospel music, the historical performances from the legends of gospel music -- one of them being the iconic Mahalia Jackson.  The DVD is inspiring, uplifting, remarkable and powerful.  Own this DVD today.",1391385600,8,298,5.166666666666667
8550903,5,B00AFEYKHK,"YES this gets 5 stars because of the performances and rarity but..................

This new 2013 DVD from a company named Green Apple Entertainment is very similar to a similarly titled DVD released a few years ago titled ""Soul of the Church"" from a company named Infinity Entertainment. Both presented full episodes (less commercials) from the 1962-65 NBC TV show ""TV Gospel Time"".  This was a Chicago-based show which brought in the best of gospel singers, groups and choirs for 30-minutes each week. Some of these were well-known outside the gospel field ( Sister Rosetta Tharpe and her (often ) singing partner Marie Knight ) as well as groups whose singers would go on to solo R&B careers (Sam Cooke came from the Soul Stirrers).

While The ""Soul"" DVD set consisted of 2-DVDs with 8 hours of performances (including even bigger names -Original Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, Ruth Brown and the Dixie Hummingbirds), ""Spirit"" is a single DVD with four shows (24 minutes each after the commercials for Feenamint and black-related cosmetics were removed. And like the ""Soul"" volume, the DVD includes two performances from the ""Mahalia Jackson Sings"" TV show.  (There is a DVD out there with nothing but performances from ""Mahalia Sings""  - a 15-minute show.  (Additional comment: Mahalia was always accompanied by some jazz legends like Shelly Mann and Barney Kessel).
Now this ""Spirit"" volume is listed as ""Volume 1"" in a proposed 12-volume collection. I wasn't able to confirm a release schedule for the others.
As you will read in other reviews of this DVD and of the ""Soul"" collection, the images are far from sharp and - apparently - no efforts were made to restore the black and white kinescopes to sharper images. This is a shame but - the stirring performances - will still capture you and the sound is not bad.

The four shows included here are not repeats of the ""Soul"" collection and feature Marie Knight on one and the Soul Stirrers (bit without Cooke) on two of the shows. The Mahalia Jackson shows are in much better shape and the images are crisp and clear.

By the way, both the package and the ""menu"" on the DVD list under ""Bonuses"" """"original 60s commercials"". My copy, at least, only had the two Jackson songs and no commercials.

So - bottom line - if you have ""Soul of the Church"", you'll want this DVD too - and, know the quality of image and performance. While there's less content in this package, it will be fascinating to see what the next volumes bring. (Hopefully some more performances by Tharpe and the Dixie Hummingbirds. ) And - as was commented on when the ""Soul"" set was issued, maybe Green Apple could include an insert (or not on package) a track list for the contents if each volume. Essentially this is a visual encyclopedia of gospel and searching for a performance among 12 DVDs would be a challenge.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8550904,5,B00AFEYKHK,"The title and cover of this DVD give a rather vague description of the actual content. That content is four episodes of an amazing little show from the early '60's called ""TV Gospel Time"". TVGT gave a stage to the greatest Gospel groups, choirs, quartets and soloists of Black Gospel's golden age in a weekly program of live performances. This first volume (more to come) features The Caravans, Marie Knight, The Soul Stirrers, Brother Joe May, Inez Andrews, Robert Anderson and lots more (including a couple of bonus videos by Mahalia Jackson). If those names don't mean anything to you, you owe yourself an education. If you do know those names then no more needs to be said.

Black Gospel is a comparatively unheralded music, so it is amazing that this show ever existed and amazing again that someone has seen fit to make it available on DVD. Thank God they have ... this is wonderful stuff!

Now I want to give fair warning to all you High-Def Techie Types out there: this is not pristine picture or audio quality. This is a filmed black and white program from the early 1960's that did not have a huge budget to work with. It is none-the-less an absolutely captivating time capsule of great artists and great music.  Everyone should be able to appreciate this on some level. It is spiritually uplifting, musically delightful and historically important. Hopefully this 12 volume set will eventually release every existent episode of 'TV Gospel Time'. They deserve to be seen, preserved and enjoyed. We owe a debt of thanks to Green Apples for putting these shows out but let me suggest that they should not shy away from marketing this for what it is ... gritty performances from early TV of some of the most influential and engaging music America has ever produced. Highly Recommended.",1360627200,9,1791,4.7709677419354835
