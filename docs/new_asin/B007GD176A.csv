8516272,5,B007GD176A,"Just watched this, and I cannot recommend it enough.  This was such a moving documentary, and I would really love to see the other children's stories.  This is just so fascinating to see how kids develop into adults.  Really neat.",1361664000,2,230,4.7
8516273,5,B007GD176A,"This is a heartwarming documentary that follows these two brothers through the years, including that period of time  when they aren't  sure if they like each other, to becoming best friends, and up to their mission calls.  It was not sugar coated, but real.  Our whole family enjoyed this peek into another family's home.  It was nice to see that nice guys don't finish last, but rather grow up to be nice adults, which matters.  I appreciated the discussion and honest dialog about sticking to your values and standards when it isn't the popular thing to do.",1336521600,3,559,4.711340206185567
8516274,5,B007GD176A,"Yesterday I watched a movie that touched my heart beyond words. This movie tells the story of two boys over a ten year time period, part of the 5000 days project. These stories were so real, so raw and moving unlike anything I have seen before. These two young men share their dreams, hopes, heartaches and joy. Thank you so much to Sam and Luke for sharing themselves and for Director Rick Stevenson for his gift. A must see for families especially teenagers!!! PS - Sam does a video blog on his church mission that taught me the real meaning of love. Thank you.",1333238400,5,563,4.423076923076923
