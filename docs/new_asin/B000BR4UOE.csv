My complaint is they don't TEACH in this video. Well not true in Killing Floor they break down the songs a bit, and they give you really good tab notes to follow along with for a few sections. Next thing you know the band is off and running though and about all they can do is just put a camera on the hands. From there you are on your own.

Fast forward to a song like 44 or Red Roster and good luck. It's more or less a performance with cameras on the hands of Hubert. For Red Rooster you don't find out what tuning the slide is in, and they don't walk you through the slide riffs. My feeling was they were probably under pressure to wrap up the shoot and had to rush through the tail end of this DVD. I think more or less you'll probably need the Hal Leonard tab book to accompany this DVD if you really want to dive into some of the nuances of these songs.

What you do get though is a good visual look at Hubert's playing.

I think at the very least they should of supplemented this DVD with the host walking you through the riffs of the songs in the extras section. My sense was they had about a couple of hours of Hubert's time for this production and the nature of this guy is to just ramble along and play by feel/of the moment which is what makes him so brilliant. So a supplement to this DVD to structure the lessons a little bit for the student would of been very helpful.",1371254400,5,1503,4.1020408163265305
8091213,5,B000BR4UOE,"Even though I'm nowhere near a good enough guitar player to keep up with most of these songs, it's still cool to see Hubert play and chat with Jimmy Vivino about the music. Levon Helm being in there is a special bonus.",1272240000,2,218,4.214285714285714
8091214,4,B000BR4UOE,"As a fan of Muddy Waters, and all his various band members, I really enjoyed this video, but it would have been nice if it were a tad longer. None the less, I would purchase it again, and will do so for my blues buddy's birthday, he being a Sumlin fan, also.",1231632000,,258,3.980769230769231
8091215,5,B000BR4UOE,"Although a bit campy, this is a great way to learn directly from the artist. After working with this DVD, I've sought out others like it -- too bad other great artists haven't produced similar instructional DVDs.",1172102400,6,212,4.756756756756757
