208001,5,5559778273,If you like Mark Lowry and you like to have a good laugh then you need to buy this DVD. I laughed so much and enjoy watching it over and over again.,1285545600,3,148,3.65625
208002,5,5559778273,I bought this for my Dad who is terminal with Cancer to give him something to make him laugh and forget about the pain for a while.  It served that purpose beautifully.  Mark Lowry is a Christian comedian so if you are looking for contemporary raunch you will be disappointed.  If you want good clean comedy it is quite good.,1228694400,8,325,4.383333333333334
208003,5,5559778273,"I need a good laugh at the end of the day, after putting in some hard work, putting up with difficult people and situations, putting out some good food for dinner.  This hits the nail on the head, with good clean fun and inspiration.  Mark Lowry at his best, what a talent!",1221264000,8,273,4.230769230769231
208004,5,5559778273,"Vol 1 & 2, definately worth buying together.  I never laughed so hard or loud!!  Mark is awesome!",1173830400,8,97,4.333333333333333
208005,4,5559778273,"Mark Lowry is a very clever comedian, as well as an excellent singer, and this DVD focuses on his funny routines during the thirteen years he spent with the Gaither Vocal Band. The way it is presented, is that Mark and Bill Gaither are shown in a relaxed setting, as they sit and talk about the clips they show from the many Homecoming Series concerts around the country, as well as one in Ireland, and a short piece in England. It also includes some terrific music with the comedy, and my favorites are the two versions of ""I'm Gonna Keep On"", with Bill trying to sing the song while he is interrupted by bird calls and Mark's mischief; it's a terrific combination of wonderful music and harmonies, and at the same time totally hilarious.

There is also a clip from the Gospel Singing Jubilee, of Mark when he was a teenager, singing ""If it Keeps Getting Better"".

The final clip shows us Mark's remarkable vocal talent, as well as his songwriting skills, as he sings ""Mary, Did You Know ?"", which he co-wrote with Buddy Greene. It's a perfect song, performed with such feeling it is thrilling and fresh no matter how many times one hears it, and it never fails to bring a tear to my eye.

The DVD ""extras"" include twenty additional minutes of mostly music, with one song featuring Michael English.

Well edited, this is a fast moving one hour and thirty-five minute show, interesting as well amusing, with often laugh-out-loud humor. Good clean fun is hard to come by, and Mark is one of the best at it.",1105747200,60,1505,4.522058823529412
