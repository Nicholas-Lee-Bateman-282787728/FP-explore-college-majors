I buy so often from this web site that I did not have a chance to watch until return policy void.  DO NOT BUY unless you can watch quickly to confirm inferior production quality does not waste your money!!!",1325894400,2,324,4.75
8436767,4,B004NNVF2W,"It is difficult to determine which chapter you are selecting from the menu. The DVD is about 63 minutes long, not the 2 hours on the video jacket.  The DVD did not return to the chapter selection menu at the end of the last chapter, but restarts playing the DVD at the first chapter. Overall the photography was good, but it appears like the video camera was hand held when filming the video portion of the DVD.",1307491200,3,411,4.337662337662338
