8409175,2,B003YGC7OO,"Just a quick note about this.  I started watching ""Follow that Man"" episodes last night; while the episodes were enjoyable, the picture quality is terrible.  I can't speak for the rest of the set, but I suspect it's all bootleg quality.  Buyer beware.  My rating does not reflect the content, just the picture/audio quality.",1419379200,,324,4.944444444444445
