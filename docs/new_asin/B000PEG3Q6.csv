8190903,5,B000PEG3Q6,I wish they would bring this out on DVD.  My mother still raves about how good it was.,1520467200,,86,3.7777777777777777
8190904,5,B000PEG3Q6,"Go on that journey with the one and only George Page can take you. You will find the journey well worth it, from Tahiti, the Marquesas, Fiji, Samoa, Pitcairn island, all the way to, lonely Easter Island, up to Hawaii, and then to Aaotearoa (New Zealand) and the final trip to peek in at the South Seas Only affair, Festival of Pacific Arts on Raratonga.",1482796800,,353,4.446153846153846
8190905,4,B000PEG3Q6,One of the few sets featuring the areas now known as Polynesia in any depth. Pleasing to note coverage from Easter Island and the Pitcairn group. These two areas could stand a full documentary on each at some stage. Coverage from French Polynesia excellent also. Highly recommended,1382832000,,281,5.0
8190906,5,B000PEG3Q6,"I was fortunate enough to see this on TV back in the 1990s and it cultivated an enduring fascination within me for Polynesia. The series starts in the Polynesian heartlands of Fiji and Samoa and then describes how these remarkable nomads of the wind expanded eastwards towards Tahiti and from there northwards to Hawaii and southwards to New Zealand forming the Polynesian triangle by the year 1,000 C.E. Of course the Polynesians did not stop there and so these colonizing explorers almost reached the Americas settling on Easter Island creating fascinating monolithic statues that remain a mystery to this day.

The visuals are stunningly beautiful. The story telling is very good and the added historical dimension of such instances as The Mutiny on The Bounty and Fletcher Christian's escape to Pitcairn island seeking to evade the British navy such that his descendants remain there to this day provides drama showing the effect that Paradise had on northern Europeans. The series also shows how humans affected and interacted with the flora and fauna of the Polynesian triangle and so this series is a compelling mixture of natural history, visual beauty, and the story of how these intrepid explorers far surpassed the exploits of the Vikings or Christopher Columbus without the technological advantages of later western explorers.",1300492800,3,1338,5.223255813953489
8190907,5,B000PEG3Q6,"This is the most awe-inspiring showcase I have ever seen of the natural and human history of the island groups of the South Pacific. There is never a dull moment; forget the fast-forward button! Even the introductory sequences to each episode are mesmerizing in their design. I assume that this series is currently being remade as part of the BBC Atlas of the Natural World, but I feel that whatever its new incarnation may take, cannot possibly top the original presentation, which was narrated by the late, great George Page.",1264291200,7,527,4.866666666666666
8190908,5,B000PEG3Q6,"I am a teacher myself who have always had a thirst for discovery and learning and even though I have been around long enough to have heard of the infamous ""mutiny on the Bounty"" this series covers that event and more!!  It tells a complete picture of all of Polynesia and the incredible navigational feats of the Polynesians who conquered over 3,000 miles (or thereabouts) of oceanic sailing without the types of instruments and equipment enjoyed by Europeans.  It, personally, left me speechless (as well, according to the documentary, the Europeans who came across them).  It is all here: the natural as well as human history of the Marquesas, Tahiti, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Easter Island, New Zealand (and the ""fierce"" Maori), and Hawaii.  As well as covering the story of the HMS Bounty and what happened to the mutineers and their descendants.  It also includes to some detail the voyage(s) of Capt. Cook and his ""enlightened"" view to the area.  If you are interested in gaining a better idea about the Pacific Ocean cultures this is the series for you.  It also includes some segments of Polynesia today as well as efforts on the part of modern Polynesians to gain/revisit their past heritage. Oh, by the way, there is a companion book that one could get separately to accompany the series that is well worth the investment as well.",1230336000,4,1335,4.8034934497816595
