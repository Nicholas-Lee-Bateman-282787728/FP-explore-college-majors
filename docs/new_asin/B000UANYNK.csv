8212720,1,B000UANYNK,the DVD became fuzzy from what I saw of it. it did not appeal to me at all it was boring and drawn out,1484697600,,102,3.2916666666666665
8212721,1,B000UANYNK,"Jennifer Connelly is my favourite actress and I've managed to collect almost all of her work the last few years. Far Harbor is now tied with The Dillemma, in my opinion, as the worst movies she has appeared in. This movie is so bad I was actually tempted to shut it off and not see how it ended. It was frustrating, boring and depressing to watch. All of these characters, who assembled for a weekend, have absolutely nothing in common so how did any of them ever meet and become friends? The best acting in the film was by Jennifer Connelly and I'm not being biased here. Everyone else was simply terrible, the story was terrible and the directing was terrible. I googled the director at the time and saw he'd only made 2 or 3 films which is a good thing. Stop giving him money to make garbage films like this! I read somewhere that this film helped Connelly get her role in either Requiem for a Dream or A Beautiful Mind and either of those directors must have had a strong stomach to watch Far Harbor to the end. Or else they ignored the film and just watched Connelly. I needed this film for my collection but I'll probably only ever watch it again if I need help in commiting suicide.",1385856000,,1189,4.336322869955157
8212722,2,B000UANYNK,"""Uncorked"" is one of my favorite movies. I was hoping for much from Far Harbor, but the plot was dull and flat. The crisis facing the characters came across as ridiculous. The wealthy setting only added to the impression. If we were supposed to feel compassion, I sadly felt only ridicule.",1356048000,,289,4.686274509803922
8212723,1,B000UANYNK,"...boring, slow moving, meandering. Couldn't care less about the characters, their past, present or future. It might have been only SLIGHTLY entertaining if the actors had preformed fully nude. Truly a strong competitor for the worst film bucket.",1308096000,3,246,5.5
8212724,3,B000UANYNK,"This movie's script and situations break no new ground, and the camera work is standard fare.  The main reason to see the movie is the performances.  A group of unknown actors bring out the best in one another's abilities.  A few exchanges between them seem forced (there is a gay subplot which just does not work), and the characters spend too much of their time sniping at each other to be truly likeable.  Still, the movie showcases the aimlessness of many people I know in their late twenties/early thirties;  you may feel that you are watching your friends on film.",972345600,7,570,4.66
8212725,5,B000UANYNK,"A masterpeace. This movie is for anyone who dreams and also has to deal with everyday life. It is truthful yet wispy. And if you love Jennifer Connelly this movie will blow you away. She plays a womon who lives in a  dream world and because of this everyone treats her different (like a  child). But she shows them she is out there but is also not blind. This is  a movie not to be missed. And If you are a dreamer like me, you will see  this movie as the truth. This movie is also about knowing what you want and  making unclear choices. It started as a weekend to relax with friends and  it ended as a weekend that changed their lives.",959817600,5,637,4.096774193548387
8212726,1,B000UANYNK,"This movie was just plain awful.  Nothing happens!  It's ""The Big Chill"" for the 90's with no plot,  lots of unhappy people, and one character who's so selfish and unlikeable he ruins the charm the rest of  the cast tries to generate.  A big fat waste of some fine actors.  Disappointing.",944179200,5,288,4.549019607843137
8212727,1,B000UANYNK,"It`s a little bit boring.... the only thing that save the movie is Jennifer Connelly... But the light, the script, the story ..Oh my God...It seems to me like a French movie ....  Please Jennifer punch in the nose to  your agent ! Carlos Gonzalez Fernandez",943401600,4,256,4.543478260869565
