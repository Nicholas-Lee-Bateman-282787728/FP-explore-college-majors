8041915,5,1572521732,"So says the tombstone of Sam Kinison who was one of the greatest comedians of our age. His talent outshined that of his peers, and his physical presence was as integral to his success as was his material. Nowadays, in a society blighted by political correctness, only comedians are allowed to speak freely which makes the likes of Sam Kinison all the more alluring. He expounded (with volume!) the foibles of human nature without a filter and we are in his debt. His life is explored here along with selected segments of his art. No, this is not a comedy compilation. You'll be disappointed if you think it will be. The film informs us of his history and features his brother and best friend as the primary persons to reveal his personality. Rodney Dangerfield and Richard Pryor also provide valuable insight. Kinison's was an incredibly passionate life. How obvious it is now, in retrospect, the similarity between his skills as a preacher and the nature of his stage presence. This documentary elucidates the way that he was attacked by PC as well for his shtick on gays and AIDS. We're lucky that a few brave folks like Sam persisted in slaughtering sacred cows and skewering the posturing of our self-righteous elite. I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and look forward to rerenting the ones devoted to his stand-up.",1205193600,,1315,4.797356828193832
8041916,5,1572521732,"This is the story of a man who was unafraid to tell the truth. Despite the other snarky comments some have posted, this video is a great introduction to a complex, unappreciated genius who has largely been forgotten by our Britney-besotted generation.",1202083200,3,251,5.0
8041917,5,1572521732,"I have a guilty pleasure ....  the late comedian Sam Kinison .... the guy who turned from being a screaming preacher to being a screaming stand-up, and if he strikes you the right way, you can laugh til you hurt.

He was really very religious and a great communicator.  He was disillusioned with people like Tammy Faye Baker and hubby and their ilk .... the so-called religious people who raised money for shopping malls etc, and so he quit the evangelical circuit to communicate in a very different way.  He was also someone very disillusioned by very bad relationships and he expresses his extreme rage at his ex-wives and lovers in a way that others who have been through the same thing can identify with in a very cathartic way.

I remember hating his screaming back in the 80s when I first heard him and then changing my mind when I saw this very same documentary about him about a year ago on A&E.  He was in extreme pain and he dumped it on his audience who roared with uncontrollable laughter.  Funny how that works.",1122076800,5,1024,4.5027027027027025
