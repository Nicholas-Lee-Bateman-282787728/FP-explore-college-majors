8129514,5,B000G8P1V4,"I own every breakdancing Amazon sells.  And another 5 or so that I could onlry rent from Netflix.  This one is the best for the beginning breaker.  It will teach you the basic moves, and a routine that combines them all.  Uprock, transitions, floor moves, freezes.  It is all here.  If you can do the windmill, then this is likely too basic.  It is good for like your first 50 hours of instruction.  After that you should be working on advanced moves that are not covered in this DVD.  For your first 50 hours, this is the best of the best.  No other DVD will teach a variety of moves well and combine them into a routine.

The music sucks.  The dancing is a little too fast (even after you have practiced for 50 hours).  There should be more tabs so rewinding and playing would be easier.  Even with these minor flaws, it is still the best.  You can buy another (and my second choice DVD is Breakdance:  Completely Street),  but you will lose significant time trying to learn the basics as no other DVD organizes it into lesson plans nearly as well.  Well worth the unfortunately high price.

Get Breakdance: Completely Street as your second DVD to pick up some advance moves and add some more variety.",1257552000,2,1203,4.435779816513762
8129515,5,B000G8P1V4,Bgirl Bounce is an amazing teacher.  She's the real deal.  She cut her teeth in the New York City underground bboy scene and has really become an authority on not only how to breakdance but how to do it the right way.  I recommend her videos 400%,1192924800,3,246,4.191489361702128
8129516,5,B000G8P1V4,"I was very impressed with Ephrat, who clearly has classical training.  This is a very difficult master class, if you will, for those of us with no background in breaking.  I even have 15 years of combined training and found this difficult.  And it is fair to say that perhaps Ephrat tries to impart too much in one hour, literally bam, bam! with the moves, one after the next.  It's not really for total dance beginners because while the moves are street, the language she uses, and breaking it down, is very classical.  Like I said, you can tell she has serious training.

Ephrat also has some of her buddies help her out, which is GREAT, because all of them have different styles.  Although she gives the opportunity to learn each move by breaking it down, and employing a variation or two, unless you already break, it's best to pause and practice before moving on.  This DVD is going to take me a while to master.  And when I can do it all, I will have an incredible workout in one hour, too!  She does toprocks, footwork and freezes; the name of the course is appropriate, these are the foundations you need to really break freestyle.

I am really glad I bought this DVD, it is actually better than other BDC products I have seen.  Ephrat is amazing and clear, it's just a lot of material, which isn't exactly a bad thing.  If you can make a habit of practicing, it's very well worth the effort.",1164326400,5,1400,4.421875
