8427157,3,B004EL5NHG,"This is a fascinating little film to catch. It's an Indian production that imitates every cliche of American mad slasher films of the 1980's. All the cliches are here- a killer, in clown get-up, targeting pretty young college girls. EVERY cliche is here, even down to the bit where our heroine hears a stange noise in her deserted house, and it turns out to be a cat. But, what makes the film interesting are the Indian characteristics. Unlike American genre films set in colleges, the students here are VERY SERIOUS about studying. There is no sex, women are not seen as sex objects (They are seen as second class citizens here.) The biggest culutre shock is the scene at the Indian frat party. The students are thrilled over the only beverage avialable- Pepsi.",1303084800,,762,4.7368421052631575
