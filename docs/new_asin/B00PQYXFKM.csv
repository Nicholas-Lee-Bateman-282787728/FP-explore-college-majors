8689011,4,B00PQYXFKM,"This PPV is part of the second season of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events with each one having a special theme with this season being more recently taped than the previous season so it reflects the talents current gimmicks & feuds.  The matches on this edition took place in Japan as part of the Wrestle-1 promotion's ""Kaisen: Outbreak"" PPV in early March (only to be shown four months later in July) with every match (except for the knockouts) being an inter-promotional encounter between the promotions.

Bad Influence vs. Junior Stars (Koji Kanemoto & Minoru Tanaka) - This match had an interesting setup with the rivalry between Daniels & Kanemoto with Daniels being known for the Koji Clutch submission hold when Kanemoto was the man who invented the hold.  Koji started out working over both men working them over in the corner using his feet before Bad Influence regained the advantage with classic double teaming isolating one of their opponents keeping him grounded to the point where he had a busted nose as the teams continued to trade momentum throughout the contest using very similar strategy against each other to the point where they were playing a game of ""can you top this"" resulting in a very good match between two evenly matched teams.

Madison Rayne vs. Gail Kim - This was a non-title match with both girls being very aggressive from the start with strong strikes against each other along with taking each other down with a strong clothesline or spear along with big moves that landed each girl either directly on their head or neck while having no issues using the ringside environment to their advantage.  This was a strong knockouts match as the girls were intense from start to finish.

Abyss vs. Yoshihiro Takayama - Mike Tenay pointed out on commentary that Takayama is one of only two men to hold the World Championship in all three major japanese promotions (New Japan, All Japan, NOAH) with Abyss attacking before the bell with strikes & chokes in the ring & brawling on the outside with Takayama fighting back before the brawl was taken to the entrance stage with weapons they decided to implement to the point where the action got out of control & nobody was able to control these men.

Bobby Roode vs Masakatsu Funaki - Both men started off delivering the same offense against each other before Funaki was able to deliver a shot so stiff that it took Roode to the outside where Roode was able to take advantage of the ringside environment to heavily work over Funaki's arm while Funkai used his educated feet for rapid kicks & leg lariat to the chest as both men traded momentum with various submissions & counters resulting in a hard fought contest.

Keiji Mutoh, Rob Terry, Taiyo Kea vs. Masayuki Kono, Rene Dupree, Samoa Joe - It should be noted for those who don't already know but Keiji Mutoh is also known by his alter-ego The Great Muta & he put his career on the line in this six man tag that saw each team have a TNA star team with members of the Wrestle-1 roster.  This match started out with Joe & Kea literally beating respect into each other in the opening minute before getting into a ""battle of the bodies"" between Terry & Dupree in which Terry gained control for his team using his strength allowing Muta to deliver this style of trademark offense & submissions while using double & triple teaming tactics singling out a member of the opposite team before the other team resorted to illegal tactics to gain control over Muta before he was saved by an unlikely ally as the match eventually broke down into a six way brawl with both teams trading momentum & using frequent tags with the miscommunication of one team continuing to play a heavy role as one member of the team was not happy with the desperate & illegal tactics of his team resulting in him showing he had more respect for his opponents than his own team.

TNA Tag Team Champions The Wolves vs. BroMans vs. Team 246 (Kaz Hayashi & Shuji Kondo) - The Wolves recently defeated The BroMans at a non-televised event to walk into this match as champions where one member of each team was legal that started out with one man being the taken out of the action with one chop allowing his opponents to face off with each other but kept trying to attack whenever the focus wasn't on him as each team used double team tactics throughout the match such as one team working over both opponents on different sides of the ring with various double teaming such as multiple suicide dives while another team showcased their strength advantage and another team being able to use the other teams partners against each other before things finally broke down between all three teams hitting one big move after another.  This was a match full of non-stop tag team action.

X Division Champion Austin Aries vs. Sanada - Both men were so evenly matched early resulting in stalemates as one man was able to get a series of offense in only for his opponent to counter with a series of their own before Sanada was finally able to catch Aries attempting to ground him before Aries picked up the intensity with a series of aerial offense while working over a specific body part as they traded momentum with Sanada being able to keep catching Aries & countering his offense while Aries continued to rely on his trademark offense & submissions with both men giving repeated impactful moves over & over that did last their opponent right on their head on more than one occasion.  Both men delivered a high quality wrestling match that was evenly match from start to finish.

TNA Champion Magnus vs. Kai - Both rosters showed support to their representative before the match as Magnus got the early advantage keeping Kai grounded along in the ring while working him over on the outside of the ring as well focusing on his lower back before Kai was able to recover & trade momentum with each man delivering one impactful move only for the other to come back with another one such as a package driver & powerbomb to a superplex & release bridge suplex as it took a non-stop series of hard hitting maneuvers to finally keep one man down for the win.  It's no secret that Magnus' TNA Championship reign was a complete disappointment due to the fact that all his title matches were filled with non-stop outside interference or heavily overbooked endings along with other things under ""Magnus Rules"" but that wasn't the case here as it was a clean traditional wrestling match making this the best match he had as champion.

It's no big secret that wrestling is taken more seriously as a ""sport"" in Japan than ""entertainment"" in the United States so this show allowed the talents to play to their strengths which was the in-ring action resulting in without a doubt one of the best showcasing of TNA talent in recent history with some talents giving the best performances at this stage of their career so I would definitely check this event out.",1416441600,2,6953,4.6590538336052205
