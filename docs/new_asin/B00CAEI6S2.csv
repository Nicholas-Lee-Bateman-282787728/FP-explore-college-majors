8579200,5,B00CAEI6S2,"Most of the text I write below is cut & paste from what I wrote about Vol. 1 since the essential message is the same. The big difference between Vol 1 & Vol 2 is the technical & psychological content. How Burrese teaches simple exercises to shift the most essential ""governors"" for your performance is outstanding! Once again, he does not disappoint!
----------

Hapkido expert Alain Burrese is one of those guys whos been there, done that, got the T-shirt, cut it up, & mowed the yard in it.  Unlike many other martial arts instructors whose credentials are limited to the training floor, Burrese has a plethora of real-world experience. From his stints in the military as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne and a sniper instructor to his various different security and protective details, he has the hands-on experience to know what works under pressure and what doesnt.

What makes Burrese TRULY unique is that he also has a legal background as a practicing licensed attorney in Montana. While some instructors are focused intensely on disarming, disabling, or destroying an assailant, with their emphasis on surviving a life-or-death encounter by any means necessary, Burrese doesnt cheerlead you into glorifying the violence of a situation and cautions you copiously against that. These DVDs clearly and carefully illustrate different scenarios in which the joint manipulation and controlling techniques of his mother art, Hapkido, can be employed with the minimum liability and maximum potential to defuse and de-escalate. The techniques illustrated in these DVDs and the strategies that Burrese employs them with are geared to keep you mobile, responsive, and safe.

Burreses verbal explanations of when he has used the different locks, controls, takedowns, and manipulations, coupled with his very capable physical demonstrations, make these DVDs a must-have for anyone in law enforcement, protective services, and private security, as well as individuals who work in hospitals and schools  where the need to handle a psychologically altered individual or a combative student with maximum control is needed and use-of-force will be highly scrutinized  may arise. For anyone in the private security sector, working in restaurants, bars, clubs, concerts, sporting events, or similar establishments, this should be required viewing at a minimum.",1418774400,,2350,5.372282608695652

8579202,5,B00CAEI6S2,"I reviewed Mr. Burrese's first video in the Restraint, Control and Come-Along Technique series, and all I can say is that this second DVD is just as outstanding as the first.  For details, please visit my review of Volume 1 in this series.",1373587200,,239,4.558139534883721
8579203,5,B00CAEI6S2,"Burrese has a done great job presenting his go-to techniques for law enforcement and security professionals.  What makes his techniques especially valuable is that he has used them repeatedly over his years working doors, body guarding, and stadium security.

The presentation is organized nicely and presented clearly, with lots of examples as to how to apply the techniques in a variety of situations. As always, Burreese's explanations are clear and informative as to how to ensure the techniques work for you, as well as how to modify them a little when the situation requires it.

I think the material is especially valuable to the many types of security professionals. For law enforcement officers, my only quibble is that some of the techniques - not all - would require an additional move to position the hands for handcuffing.

I've been teaching defensive tactics to cops and security people since 1973. I think Alain Burrese has done a wonderful job in this DVD presenting material of great value to those who have the difficult job of dealing with resisting people.

Highly recommended.",1373155200,3,1098,5.0777777777777775
8579204,5,B00CAEI6S2,"I worked stadium security for 26 years before retiring recently. It's an interesting environment--almost everything we did had a good chance of winding up on video, yet we needed to enforce the rules, break up fights, and generally keep order without getting sued or seriously hurting anyone. If that sounds familiar to you, this video is a vital resource. Restrain and control techniques fill the vast majority of roles that bouncers, security professionals, and law enforcement officers must play in performing their duties. Sure, oftentimes we can talk people into behaving, and sometimes we need to break someone, but most of the time when we need to control or move someone it's pain compliance, joint locks, and the like we need to use. Burrese shows the vital details necessary to make such applications most effective. Martial artists will find great value from the materials too. Volume 2 includes: Spinning A Person, Combat Breathing, Thumb Grab Goose Neck, Split Finger Goose Neck, Fingers Behind Back Hold, Over The Top Chicken Wing, Four Corner Throw, Figure Four Lock, Rolling A Subject Over, Pressure Points, Applications and more. The video and sound qualities are good, the editing is professional, and the quality of instruction is simply outstanding. Highly recommended!",1370736000,3,1289,5.262135922330097
8579205,5,B00CAEI6S2,"Burrese has already produced a very successful series of instructional DVDs. His newest two volume set entitled, Restraint, Control & Come-A-Long Techniques is another 5 star winner. Burrese covers relevant principles for the application of the expertly demonstrated and described techniques. He presents them at full speed and in slower and up close instruction so that details of the techniques can be clearly seen, grasped and learned by the viewer. Burrese also stresses repetition practices with a partner and multiple partners so that the execution of the techniques can be utilized instinctively with surprise, speed and technical accuracy. Lastly, he emphasizes the necessity of physical conditioning, mental preparation, situational awareness, self control and the use of breathing exercises as a method to keeping your cool. I highly recommend this two volume set without hesitation.

8579206,5,B00CAEI6S2,"I just watched A. Burrese's newest DVDs on Restraint, Control and Take Along techniques.  I really like his style of teaching.  I have been in the bar security business for the past 18 years and have training in Aikido and Kosho Ryu Kempo, and exposure to the pressure points as presented by the late Professor Jay and Scott Rodgers.  Alan's dvds are a great addition to the other dvds he's created and I purchased. This set includes more advanced material from the earlier volumes on locks and controls..  I am not a student of Alan's or affiliated with him at all. I enjoy instructors who can teach, and show in detail the techniques. I can no longer train in dojos with my shoulder so the more detailed instruction the better.  This is a purchase you won't regret.",1366761600,3,767,4.569343065693431
