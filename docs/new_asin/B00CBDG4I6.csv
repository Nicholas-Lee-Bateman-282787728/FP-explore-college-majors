5711266,1,B00CBDG4I6,I didn't have the chance of watching this movie because it stated it had English subtitles but when you tried to activate the subtitles you got nothing and it kept repeating the previews. I have never had a problem with anything from amazon but it's the first time with anything. Sent it back!!!  something went wrong when they downloaded to the d.v.d.,1403913600,,352,4.67741935483871
5711267,3,B00CBDG4I6,"It was a good movie but was somewhat predictable. Though not based on ""The Ring'  (Rungu),  it follows the same path.

DVD formatting (16/9) is correct and subtitles are good.",1395446400,3,175,4.766666666666667
5711268,5,B00CBDG4I6,"This movie was a lot of fun-the girls from Buono did a great job in it, especially Miyabi Natsuyaki who really gives off a creepy vibe in her role-far from her normal cheery idol image.  Throughout the first half I figured it was going to be the often told Horror cliche of a kid being bullied who snaps and takes revenge on her classmates, but a surprise ending really saved it from being too predictable and made it a real winner.  You don't have to be a fan of Buono to enjoy it as long as you like a good scare this movie is worth your time.",1392163200,4,545,4.08411214953271
5711269,5,B00CBDG4I6,"I won't go much into details as the first and only reviewer at the time of writing this pretty much said it all. IMO, I think Japan has kinda dragged a bit on good quality J-Horror. For a 2011 release, this was a good one from Japan. The story was well done and keeps your attention from beginning to end, and having a cast of hot beautiful girls didn't hurt. The story is fresh as it deals about death curses put placed in writings. A great movie from Tokyo Shock in widescreen and 2.0 audio with optional english subtitles.",1382918400,,525,4.313131313131313
5711270,4,B00CBDG4I6,"Ring of Curse was a fair film worthy of a viewing, but was a low hitter, as far as scares go, in the J-Horror department.

In it, Kurohane is an oddball student who keeps to herself most of the time, which keeps her from forming lasting friendships. Her second problem is her unflattering appearance, which includes long, straight bangs, an untidy look and slumped shoulders. It causes her to look more like a ghost around campus. Her one redeeming quality however, is her ability to write, which she does with a passion. In fact, she enters a writing contest at one point in the film to improve her talent.

Yuka, another student in her class, also enjoys writing. But she feels sidelined by her teacher since he  wants Kurohane to join the literature club based on her success in the writing contest. He seems to overlook Yuka's abilities which causes a slight jealousy in her.

As time goes by however, the class finds Kurohane to be overly detached from her student responsibilities.  She doesn't attend gym class like she's supposed to and she has a bad habit of disappearing when it's her turn to help clean up the classroom, yet she still receives high grades. The others conduct a meeting and decide to make Kurohane an outcast as they turn to bullying her. At first they simply ignore her, which has no effect on her, since Kurohane prefers to be a loner anyway. Then they switch to bad pranks. But when all else fails, they decide the best way to get back at her is to have her write the play for the school festival. It's a fitting punishment since their intentions are simply to reject all the drafts she comes up with. Then they can throw them back in her face and tell her to rewrite them again and again, just to annoy her.

Yuka is uncomfortable with the idea of bullying Kurohane. But more importantly, she would prefer to be the one to write the play. In her mind, it's a lost opportunity being wasted on a bad prank. What the rest of the class doesn't realize however, is that Kurohane is out to get back at them through her writing, since it also curses anyone who reads it.

As the film progresses, several of the girls start to die off. Yuka tires to distance herself from the whole situation by playing the peace keeper, but Kurohane keeps the curses up. Twists and turns occur between the two girls as the film reaches its climax and eventually comes to a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

Well as you can see from the plot, Ring of Curse shares a lot of similarities with other J-Horror films. The main one being about a group of misguided students whose bullying brings about their own demise. While that idea's not original in J-Horror, the addition of a curse simply through reading it, is a new twist. Kurohane makes a good, creepy victim who unleashes her fury on her unsuspecting classmates, while Yuka is a good heroine, who sees what's going on from her point of view, but can do little to stop it.

The horror aspect of the film is atmospheric in nature. However, I have to say there were no solid moments where I genuinely jumped out of my seat. The film includes several scenes that helped build up suspense though. And the bloodshed was minimal overall. Most of the girls died in non-violent ways, but their acting was always believable when it happened.

I also thought the addition of  the rock band  Buono in the film  was a good choice. They did a decent job  with their acting.

The tech aspects of the film include a Japanese audio track only with English subtitles, a few trailers of other films, and an interview with the girl who played Yuka. It's always interesting to see how Japanese actresses behave in interviews compared to Hollywood girls. More humble is the word that comes to mind. And I'm not sure if the part at the very end of the DVD was staged or not. Either way though it was an interesting segment to watch. It makes you wonder, WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT and WHY WAS IT LEFT ON THE DVD? It was likely there to get the reaction that I'm having right now.

Overall, I gave the film a 4.  A curse through writing seemed like a fresh idea. The Buono girls are always cute to watch. And the plot carried my interest to the end. There was also a funny scene at the end of the movie, which made me laugh. You'll just have to watch it to see what I'm talking about. Nice bit of sneaky marketing there on the part of Buono, maybe a bit shameless too.  It's not the best J-Horror out there, but it's definitely not the worst either.  A decent film overall if you don't mind light J-Horror, or you just like Buono in general. It's worthy of a watch.",1378166400,2,4602,4.424852071005917

8579779,4,B00CBDG4I6,"Different in that there is a lot of narration (which I actually like - it's almost like an audio book in parts), and unlike some other similar horror movies everything is extremely well-explained. No ""whaaat??"" ending here. Nothing incredibly scary or earth-shattering, however. I do take issue with this being a ""typical"" story however in that the many angles of narration and explanation - and a bit of sympathy for the ""monster"" here - do make this on stand out, though as a result it is a bit slow-paced.",1516924800,,508,4.719101123595506

These are the words that open Ring of Curse following a short introduction by the members of Buono! Known as Gomennasai in its native country, Ring of Curse is a film adaptation of a cell phone novel. It stars the members of the three-person Hello! Project group Buono! as the characters of Yuka Hidaka, Hinako Kurohane, and Shiori Sonoda.

The story is split into three acts, told as a diary made by the protagonist, Yuka. Act 1 deals with Sonoda deciding to bully Kurohane following a test, disgusted by the fact that the weird, loner girl has been besting her grades. Since Kurohane had previously won a literary contest, Sonoda, as class president, decides to have her write a play for the cultural festival, with the intent to degrade her attempts. However, Kurohane soon turns the table on her tormentors through her writing.

Act 2 takes the form of Kurohane's diary, detailing her backstory and her reasons for what she did and Act 3 takes place a year after the events in Act 1 as Kurohane's curse rears its head again in Yuka's life.

I have to say, both Miyabi Natsuyaki and Momoko Tsugunaga did an excellent job portraying Kurohane and Sonoda. Miyabi does a perfect job capturing Kurohane's creepy and weird personality while Momoko nailed Sonoda's alpha bitch personality. If I didn't knew better, I would had thought Ms. Tsugunaga was one in real-life. Both women showed they can portray people that are complete opposites of their normal personalities and do it perfectly.

Airi Suzuki's portrayal of Yuka is just okay. Besides Ring of Curse/Gomennasai, I've seen Suzuki in Keitai Kanojo, Ousama Game, and Suugaku Joshi Gakuen (all three through fansubs since this film is the only one with an official English release). In the former two, it was the same as here. However, I quite enjoyed her appearance as one of the math girls of the week in Suugaku Joshi Gakuen and I think I know why. In Ring of Curse, Keitai Kanojo, and Ousama Game, her characters are mostly passive observers to the supernatural events, rarely actually taking an active role in the events. When the character does take an active role, as what happens here here and in Keitai Kanojo, she quickly becomes passive again, other characters taking the lead again. In fact, in Ousama Game, here character is completely a passive background character, occasionally delivering a line on the current situation and nothing else. In Suugaku, however, she actually takes an active role in her starring episode, being the antagonist of the week and showing a lot of personality. Really, the problem I find is that Ms. Suzuki just happens to get the misfortune of getting the weakest character and not really getting enough material to work with.

The translation for the subtitles are okay. Really, the only things that stick out to me is the fact that they translate -san, so you have situations where high schoolers are referring to each other as Mr./Ms. <insert family name>. It's just weird seeing students refer to each other in such a way. I feel they should had just omitted the honorifics in those situations. I also found they misspelled Yuka's name as Yuri neared the end and of course, there is the end of the opening text, which looks to have been left somewhat untranslated.

Now, throughout the film there are voice overs by Yuka, and some by Kurohane in Act 2. When it comes to Yuka's, they're mostly redundant. They mostly tell you what you are seeing on screen or are about to see. Kurohane's, on the other hand, actually helps to set the mood of Act 2 and works with the fact that we're supposed to be seeing what is in her diary as narrated by her words. It truly feels like a diary brought to life and brought substance to those scenes. Yuka's is just tedious and should had been dropped. Yeah, the whole movie is supposed to be Yuka's written recount of the events, but it just doesn't have the same feeling as Kurohane's.

Is Ring of Curse a bad film? No. Is it good? No. It is an average film of its kind. It's not really scary and the protagonist is overshadowed by her costars. The only part that really made me jumped was when Sonoda showed back up at the end of Act 1 and that was because of how sudden it was, not because of fright. *Nyan*

There was also a part before that that is just confusing. See, there is a scene where Yuka is at home where Sonoda calls her, asking if she was the one who sent the text with the weird message. Of course, it turns out to be Kurohane using Yuka's name. However, shouldn't Sonoda know from the get-go that it wasn't Yuka? She called Yuka's cell phone. She should have known that it wasn't from her by the fact the numbers wouldn't have matched. Plus, Yuka isn't someone who strikes me to forget to tell someone she changed numbers. It just feels like a plot hole.

I say only watch this if you're a fan of Buono! or one of the girls or are a fan of J-Horrors and want to experience all of them. Really, the best thing of the film is Miyabi and Momoko's acting. Other than that, the rest is just average.

As an aside, I find it funny that Arisa Komiya, who played Yoko Usami/Yellow Buster in Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters, plays one of Sonoda's posse. You see, back when all we knew of the sentai was the name Go-Busters, people speculated that it was going to be dealing with ghosts or curses in some way. That later turned out to be wrong. However, with that knowledge, it is funny that Komiya was in this before Go-Busters. In fact, her character's given name here is Yoko, same as on the show. It's almost as though Ring of Curse was predicting the future a little bit.",1446854400,,6002,4.594771241830065
8579783,4,B00CBDG4I6,"This Japanese movie follows a girl named Yuka who, along with other girls in class, starts to bully a strange girl in their class named Kurohane. Yuki didn't feel bad since she was jealous of Kurohane's writing skills and wanted to beat her in a contest for the drama. To find out, Kurohane didn't write a screen play, but actually a novel that left the girl who stole and read it dead. More deaths happen after people read her notebook and Yuka figures out that Kurohane is behind it. Kurohane explains why she started killing people and why she is learning how to curse write. The rest of the movie deals with the curse and how Yuka must stop it

The story also goes into Kurohane's past even more and tells what she wrote in her diary. I found it to be kind of strange that she told part of the story, then we hear the rest through the diary.

Plot-wise, I found this story be quite fascinating. A girl can write curses and whoever reads them will die. Based on an mobile story years before, I think that it was great that the pop group Buono! wanted to create it in a film because it spoke to them so much. It is one of those horror movies that makes you kind of nervous and glad you can't read Japanese because you don't want to be cursed too (though I wonder if Buono! made it into a movie as well so they didn't get cursed). It was more about plot than it was about special effects.

This movie was rather creepy in the concept, but the sound and video lens were lacking. Although I really don't care about special effects that much, the lighting, sound, and film angles did bother me as they didn't make it feel like a horror movie. If they invested in it a little more, I think this could have been a lot scarier. The creepiest part was when Kurohane tells her story, as the lighting changed and was the only time they used it to their advantage (not sure if it was on purpose though). And they really needed to get rid of the high-pitch sound, it was really annoying.

The acting was okay. Some actresses could have been a little better at acting, but for the most part they were pretty good.

I give the movie a 3.5/5. The plot was good and creepy in concept, but the filming and sound could have been better to make it a lot more scary.

P.S., if you are a person who gets chain letters and is paranoid the chain letter will curse them if they don't forward the letter, probably shouldn't watch this movie...",1445472000,,2420,4.27292576419214
8579784,5,B00CBDG4I6,"This movie is amazing, It's me favorite movie of all time as of right now. The characters feel so real to me. The story is pretty awesome as well. The second half of the movie was very surprising for me, and made me fall in love with the movie even more than I already had. I recommend this movie to everyone. It isn't for everyone though, as it's only subtitled in English. Some people don't like that. 5 stars without a doubt.",1424995200,,428,4.2317073170731705
8579785,4,B00CBDG4I6,"Cleverly constructed, creative, believably acted and with an original and unique story to tell, ""Ring of Curse"" is also atmospheric and consistently engaging. Wisely holding special effects to a minimum ,and instead captivating audiences with the intriguing plot of an outcast woman whose writing of the school play eventually puts a rampant curse on all those who read her narrative (there is just enough meat on the film's bones at 94 minutes to be satisfying without becoming overlong), we care about the entire cast of characters from the torturer to the tormented. What also works is the confident pace of the story, the claustrophobic camera angles that slowly pan in on faces or isolated objects (the symbol of a lone desk is often the focus of this type of shot many times throughout and it does well as a singular image which summarizes the central plot and protagonist's point of view) and the sense of mounting dread capturing well in the motion picture's dark cinematography.  This movie is beautifully done and quietly effective, even if it does give into the occasional cheap jump scare. Refreshingly, genre cliches and predictability are kept to a minimum.",1419120000,,1171,5.036082474226804

In the vein of ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" comes this movie about a Japanese girl whose stricken with cancer and has found a way to take revenge on those who have wronged her. The creepy tone is pretty well done if not a bit familiar, however the performances are strong and the pace is also good, for being maybe 90-95 minutes enough stuff is fleshed out so it doesn't get dull.
