7912167,4,B00000JGO2,This is the second film in this series that I have purchased. The first one was Full Circle Killing. I enjoyed this film as well as the first one. A great story and plot with some excellent martial arts action with the sword. Kyoshiro is a great character and you certainly don't want to be on his bad side. Excellent film work and subtitles as well. If you like Samurai movies check these films out.,1001635200,,400,4.346666666666667
7912168,4,B00000JGO2,"Sleepy Eyes Of Death - Sword Of Satan - Probably one of the best films in the series, Kyoshiro is begged by several strangers to save the life of a virgin saint.  He reluctantly agrees and encounters several who wish to  stop him at sword point.  He expertly dispatches them with his masterful  bladework before he finally meets up with the saintly one.  But this is  just where the plot really gets good.  Kyoshiro's past and origins are  finally revealed and the climactic moments are truly memorable.  As with  the other Sleepy Eyes films, this one is presented in widescreen format  with great subtitling and color.  Acting is great, with Nemuri Kyoshiro  probably at his darkest.  Great sword fighting and one on one duels.  This  film is one of the reasons that this series has been referred to as the  most popular samurai film series in Japan - and that's saying a lot with  competition like the Lone Wolf and Cub series and Zatoichi.",962409600,5,942,4.640243902439025
