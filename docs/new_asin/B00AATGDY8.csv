5407640,4,B00AATGDY8,"I really loved the movie, 'In The Good Old Summertime.'  It was so funny and enjoyable!  A real feel good movie like mac and cheese, fried chicken, and apple pie. Judy Garland and Van Johnson were great together !  This movie had such a good love story too.  Cuddles was funny with his famous violin, how he would torture all his employees when he played it to comfort himself.  The movie 'The Harvey Girls ' was really good and I enjoyed watching it a lot.  Angela Lansbury was really good in this movie, her and Judy Garland are smitten with the same man; which leads to
much hostility between the two.  'Summer Stock' I thought was a cheesy movie!  The Movie reminded me of a cross between an Elvis Presley movie, and Frankie Avalon movie.  The other movie, I have not watched yet, but looked at. But, the other two movies are the best on the disk.  I just wish they would of had 'Meet Me In St. Louis' on this collection Instead of one of the other two movies.",1483315200,4,964,4.305555555555555

5407650,5,B00AATGDY8,"Despite being dated, this is a fine collection of classic Hollywood musicals.  Judy Garland could almost carry a movie all by herself, with that unparalleled voice. As entertainment, these are fluff, but then that's typical of a movie musical.  Judy's beauty, her voice, and the glimmer of sadness in her eyes that no role could ever quite erase, will live on as long as there's a Hollywood.  This is a great collection for her fans, film buffs, film students and a bowl of popcorn with the family.",1476576000,,498,4.7011494252873565

It's not really a story about the Harvey Girls from way back when.  The songs are great.  Judy Garland is at her best and John Hodiak is so very handsome.  Angela Lansbury is seductive and Ray Bolger is a delight in his dance scene.  There are some rough and tumble fights.  All in all a wonderful, charming and entertaining movie.  I look forward to watching the other 3 movies in this collection.",1440806400,2,551,4.44

5407709,5,B00AATGDY8,"I purchased ""TCM Greatest Legends:  Judy Garland"" as a birthday gift for my wife.  Neither of us can stand the violent and vulgar fare being offered on network and cable television these days so we choose to spend most of our evenings viewing classic films.  ""TCM Greatest Legends:  Judy Garland"" offers up four films from Judy's heyday in the 1940's.  What an outstanding collection!  All four of the films included here were new to us and we thoroughly enjoyed each and every one of them.  Several years ago I had read a book about ""The Harvey Girls"" and when I discovered that a movie was made about them I was very anxious to see it!  What an unexpected treat!  The songs are terrific and Judy gives a stellar performance in this one.  TCM Greatest Legends:  Judy Garland"" also features a pair of films teaming Garland with the legendary Gene Kelly.  How can you possibly go wrong?  ""For Me and My Gal"" features a solid script, outstanding numbers and fabulous dance routines.  A thoroughly entertaining experience!  Now my wife and I agree that ""Summer Stock"" was probably the weakest of the four films but I would still rate it as a solid four star offering.  Finally, there is ""In The Good Old Summertime"" starring Judy and Van Johnson.  We were quite surprised to discover that this was a musical remake of another outstanding classic film ""The Shop Around The Corner"".  We both loved it!

TCM Greatest Legends:  Judy Garland"" also includes a number of special features that we also appreciated.  The shorts, cartoons and trailers are a welcome addition and will add to your enjoyment of this very fine collection.  Twenty years ago (when I was 43) I would not have been caught dead watching any of these films.  But I find that the older I get the more I enjoy the great musicals of the 30's, 40's and 50's.

5407724,4,B00AATGDY8,"The only one of the 4 movies that I don't like very much is For me and My Gal. I don't like how Gene Kelly has to portray a coward. He so wrapped up in himself and making it to the top and to stay out of the war he purposely injures himself. He plays the part well, but it's just not reminicent of a happy time in a nice musical.
I bought this DVD for the other 3 movies which I absolutly love! Especially In the Good Old Summertime, it's such a cute movie. I grew up watching old films and to the talent in action, it's just so much fun. And of course there is Judy and listening to her sing, what a great voice!",1413331200,,613,3.8346456692913384

5407755,5,B00AATGDY8,"What can be said of the great Judy that hasn't already been many times repeated?  She was unique, that's all.
She is well beyond wonderful in each of these films, with capable to almost equally wonderful supporting casts.
Judy Garland was TINY in size, and not outstandingly beautiful, but whenever she comes into camera-view you have to catch your breath.
She is no less riveting in each of these four films than in any of her other ones.
There are moments here (as in most of her films) where you will be drawn right out of your seat, even if you're at home and comfortable, and even if you're alone.  Is that so of anybody else whosoever?",1389830400,2,641,4.47008547008547

5407757,5,B00AATGDY8,"Gudy Garland really was a fantastic, very talented actress. The stories in the movies are ones that are good for families. At a time when American education is stultifying this generation, movies like this enrich our culture. They promote values of hard work and treating people with respect. Young people would benefit greatly by seeing older movies like these. They have great talent and stories that might wake up young people and get them off texting, cell phone addiction, and Face book. As someone who has taught for 35 years, these types of films are great investments for family life. Keep your kids at home, teach them yourself, because public education has been reduced to indoctrination into political correctness. Even your grandmother could do a better job. She would take they kids to the library and made shure they learned something. Whereas, many schools pass out work, students copy, can't pass the tests. Then, they are given tests for learning disabilities. Of course they find them. Why would they not find them, since no effort at teaching is being made. Teachers are clerks, tools of the state. Students are forced to practice for state tests, but never to think. So you have school with 10-30% of students with learning disabilities. Their solution for the common ADD disability are drugs: now you have real zombies, not just in the movies. Keep your kids at home, get some good movies and materials. These types of films are good for your family!",1389052800,,1471,4.911646586345381

5407760,5,B00AATGDY8,"Love that TCM has been putting out these classics =)  My sister wanted ""In the Good Ol' Summertime"" but much to my dismay, to just get one movie cost about 3 times the amount of this. So you get to enjoy Judy in three other films as well as ITGOST. =) Love it!! Bravo TCM!",1388016000,,272,3.9454545454545453
5407761,5,B00AATGDY8,"If you want any of the films this is the best way to buy them.  Less then $4.00 per disc, you don't get separate cases or covers but at that price I'll make the sacrifice.",1386201600,,171,3.8857142857142857
5407762,5,B00AATGDY8,"She was and remains the very best asset and resource of the musical entertainment world.  No one ever did it like Judy Garland and there have been many fine actresses along the way...all supremely talented...but the Garland legend is not just legend...it is fact.  She remains the best of the best and her musicals have a touch of genius added to them...they are magic and the magic is Judy Garland. No matter who her co-star was and no matter what the premise of the film...the Garland films are as golden as she was.  Every bit of celluloid proves the absolute foresight and genius stroke of why the studio chose her talents over those of Deanna Durbin at the time.  In the studio that boasted more stars than there are in the heavens...surely hers was the highest and brightest of them all. This collection is just a sampling of a talent so rare that it makes one wish for more and more and more.  Thank God for film...in that medium, we have her frozen in time...forever!",1384992000,4,975,4.548571428571429

5407765,4,B00AATGDY8,"My favorite of these 4 movies is ""The Harvey Girls"", something I think nearly everyone would say.  (Be sure to look for a young, but tough-taking, Angela Lansbury, and a youthful and very beautiful Cyd Charisse in prominent roles.)

Don't look for deep meaning in any of these four; that's not what most of the Hollywood musicals were about.  But, oh, the music is so wonderful you'll find yourself humming the tunes for days after watching any or all of these.

""Summer Stock"" is the weakest of the 4 and always makes me a little sad even with the terrific songs.  That's because this is her last movie under contract to MGM and reminds me of the shoddy way the studio treated Garland after it had made millions from her performances for so many years.

Still, the stars, the music and the dances take you back to a time when life seemed simpler and more full of promise.

Buy this film collection.  You won't be sorry if you do.",1378857600,23,930,4.461538461538462
