Since 2007, ""Phineas and Ferb"" has been an animated show that has been entertaining children (and also adults) on the Disney Channel with its running gags, interesting and hilarious characters.

With each episode, Phineas and Ferb are both working on a project and each time, their sister Candace is always scheming to finally bust them. Meanwhile, the evil scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz is up to no good and Major Monogram and the secret agent Perry the Platypus (Agent P) are doing all they can to stop Doofenshmirtz.

""Phineas and Ferb"" sports vibrant colors and for the most part, picture quality should be fine for the children. If anything, the series is known for its unique character design and for the most part, the animation is quite enjoyable to watch because it's quite different with the characters and their geometric shaped heads.

Dialogue and music are clear and are heard clearly through the front and center channels. Subtitles are in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

At our home, ""Phineas and Ferb"" is the top animated series that is constantly watched by my 10-year-old son. He loves the animated series and watches it over and over, and he hasn't even gotten bored by it in the several years of watching it.

And he has been waiting for a ""Phineas and Ferb"" DVD since the last ""The Perry Files"" release and with ""Phineas and Ferb: The Perry Files - Animal Agents"", I'm sure many children will be thrilled that not only are their 12 episodes featured, but also a cool spy kit is included.

With this latest DVD release, 12 episodes from the first three seasons are featured, episodes that showcase Perry and members of the O.W.C.A. (Organization Without a Cool Acronym).

From many episodes of Vanessa trying to catch her brothers in the act, boyfriend problems or in some sort of crisis, Phineas & Ferb continue to make more inventions and also their friends take part in the adventures.  But of course, because these are episodes showcasing the ""Perry Files"", these episodes feature Perry ala ""Agent P"" in action.

For the most part, children and the young at heart, will enjoy this series!  At our home, every day he watches the show, I can hear both he and my wife singing the show's theme song and even my wife has talked about how she enjoys watching ""Phineas and Ferb"" alongside with him. In fact, I have sat with him many times as he schools me on the characters of the animated series and as a father, just watching his face and seeing him rewinding back to his favorite moments of the series.

So, I'm sure that what is happening in our household, happens in other households as well.  So, for parents looking for a fun DVD for their children, ""Phineas and Ferb: The Perry Files - Animal Agents""
is another fantastic DVD release!  And my son gives this DVD, five stars and a very big ""AWESOME!"".",1364601600,2,5692,4.851351351351352

Inside the packaging is a cool spy kit with binoculars. If I had any complaints with this DVD compared to last year's its that it doesn't have as many episodes even though Where's Perry? parts 1 & 2 are both half-an-hour specials. Another complaint is that when we watched this DVD there were a handful of episodes that we didn't particularly care for. With almost each of the previous P&F DVDs I couldn't find a single episode that I didn't like. Its still a great DVD but I don't think its quite as good as some of the previous Phineas and Ferb DVD releases.",1362528000,2,1059,4.744565217391305

It does come with a set of Perry binoculars and tells you how to become an agent (get a notebook, write down what you see in your backyard, etc).
