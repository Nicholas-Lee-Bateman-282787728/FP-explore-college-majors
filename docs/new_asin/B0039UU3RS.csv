4098137,5,B0039UU3RS,"Tarzan The Magnificent is 1 of the GREATEST Tarzan movies made!!!
Gordon Scott is the 2nd GREATEST Tarzan ever to don the ""LION CLOTH""!!
I love the ""plot"" of the movie!! It totally depicts why it has the title that it does!! Tarzan proves why he is ""LEGENDARY""
& ""LORD OF THE (so called) JUNGLE""!! In the movie, he is taking a wanted murderer to the Kairobi authorities so that his
reward money will go to the family of an inspector that was murdered by the felons' family!! The familys' name is: ""Bantons"".
Tarzan killed 1 of the ""Bantons'"", & the rest of them want REVENGE!! So they blow up a boat that Tarzan was going to use to
transport his prisoner to Kairobi, but the passengers that were on the boat, were also enroute to Kairobi. So now Tarzan has
to take them along with him & his prisoner to Kairobi by foot!!!!
The ""Bantons"" are in hot pursuit of the group, & the prisoner tries everything he can to delay & stop them from reaching their
destination, & also allow his family to catch up to them for a SHOWDOWN with the ""APEMAN""!! The group encounters alot of adver
sities along the way, but Tarzan protects his ""SHEEP"" like the ""TRUE SHEPERD"" that he is!!! The ""Bantons"" eventually catch up
to the group, and in a CLIMATIC fight scene, Tarzan takes on the family with ""RECKLESS ABANDON""!!!! I don't want to go any fur
ther, 'cause I want u to PURCHASE the movie, & watch it yourself to get the TOTAL PERSPECTIVE of it!!!! For all Tarzan lovers,
THIS IS A MUST SEE JOINT, AND I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET IT!!!!
For all the Tarzan fans/lovers, this is for the record: The GREATEST, & MOST NOTARIZED TARZAN EVER IS: JOHNNY WEISMULLER!!!
And in the #3 spot is: MIKE HENRY!!  Enjoy!!",1352592000,,1695,4.415335463258786

he said Jock Mahoney was  a ""fablous fella""-""great guy""
besides having excellent character & plot it obvious Joak Mahoney rerally could fight.
(also rod taylor darker than amber on youtube)
obviously dated still is the only tarzan film i felt was resl.
most acton heros-richard gere,mel gibson.roger moore etc are fakes
Jock Mahoiney as Rod Taylor,also Bill Smith-darker than amber-and
Sean Connery are the real deal,

4098140,4,B0039UU3RS,"This follow-up to 'Tarzan's Greatest Adventure' is
equally as entertaining.  This was Scott's swan song
as the Ape Man, after which the role was turned over
to actor/stuntman (and father of actress Sally Field)
Jock Mahoney, who, as it happens, plays the main bad
guy in this feature - with a little help from veteran
John Carradine and Al Mulock (another holdover from
the previous film).  This picture, too, was shot on
location in Africa (Kenya) and the locales make for
stunning backgrounds to the action set-pieces. Also,
like the previous film, Tarzan's main weapon of self-
defence is a bow and arrow - which becomes a more-or-
less permanent part of his jungle wardrobe.  The dvd
quality is quite good for a Warner Archive transfer,
though of course not entirely perfect - and as usual,
there are no extras.  Incidently, most Warner Archive
dvd's are less expensive if you order them from the
WB website, instead of Amazon.",1275004800,4,931,4.836477987421383

4098142,5,B0039UU3RS,"This is kind of the thinking man's Tarzan film.  Good plot, excellent cast of characters, and well filmed.  Tarzan for one of the rare times on film, is not a slightly above average chimp.  Gordon Scott delivers his finest performance as Tarzan and John Carradine and Jock Mahoney are nasty bad guys as father and son convicts.  No ""Me Tarzan"" nonsense in this film, only action, suspense and realistic characters.  Make no mistake this is a serious film, and a good one.  Steve",1264896000,19,478,4.698795180722891
4098143,4,B0039UU3RS,"An interesting film where you have the reigning Tarzan (Gordon Scott) battling the next guy ( Jock Mahoney).  Be kinda like a last Connery Bond film with Roger Moore as the villain!  Escorting a killer to justice (Mahoney), tracked by his band.  Not a bad entry.  Like all WB Archive films, nothing extra.",1262304000,7,305,4.69811320754717
8392362,4,B0039UU3RS,"RELEASED IN 1960 and directed by Robert Day, ""Tarzan the Magnificent"" covers events in Africa when Tarzan has no recourse but to escort a formidable prisoner, Coy Banton (Jock Mahoney), through the jungle to the authorities in Kairobi. Along for the trek are five passengers of a river boat destroyed by Coys ruthless father (John Carradine) & cutthroat brothers. The latter pursue Tarzan & the group to save Coy.

Despite his short hair, Gordon Scott was one of the better Tarzans; and this was his last of six Tarzan flicks in six years. Most critics cite Scotts previous movie Tarzans Greatest Adventure (1959) as one of the best Tarzan movies (which Ive never seen) with this one running not far behind. The tone is believable, akin to Sands of the Kalahari (1965), with Tarzans exploits thankfully being kept within the realm of realism. Speaking of his feats, theres a lot of jungle action, including a knockdown-drag-out fight at the climax. The way Coy uses psychology to disrupt the group and gain the allegiance of one of them is reminiscent of The Naked Spur (1953).

Unfortunately, I found the members of the group and their interactions rather dull, including Tarzan. The script needed another rewrite to flush out the human interest. Moreover, the two women, Betta St. John & Alexandra Stewart, are serviceable, but the movie called for at least one woman of the caliber of Julie Adams, which can be observed in ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954), if you need to get my drift. For these two reasons ""Tarzan the Magnificent"" doesn't arise to the greatness of ""Sands of the Kalahari."" Yet it's not bad and is certainly a worthwhile austere jungle thriller. You can't beat the authentic African locations in living color (each of which 1934's heralded ""Tarzan and His Mate"" lacked).

Interestingly, the main villain here, Jock Mahoney, went on to play the next Tarzan in two movies.

THE FILM RUNS 82 minutes and was shot in Kenya with interiors done at Shepperton Studios, England. WRITERS: Berne Giler & Robert Day.

8392363,5,B0039UU3RS,"Saw this movie with my dad in the early 60's. It's everything that I remembered it to be. Tarzan doesn't yodel, nor does he summon animals in this one, though. If you're into that yodelling and animal control then you'll be dissappointed. Otherwise it's a good movie. The producers used real tribal members in their native garb which impressed me now that I'm an adulrt. As a child I didn't think much of native costume and ceremonial dances. I just hope the natives were paid well and not exploited.",1491955200,,500,4.629213483146067

8392369,5,B0039UU3RS,"My favorite Tarzan movie starring my favorite Tarzan actor, Gordon Scott.  An excellent 1960 color adventure filmed on location in Africa.  This time around Tarzan has to take a murderous thief cross country to the nearest large town for the crimes he has committed.  Along for the trek are a group of stranded tourists, some useful, some useless.  ALL give excellent performances.  Scott as Tarzan gives a great turn as a Tarzan that speaks like an educated man instead of a sub-mental lunk.  Jock Mahoney and especially John Carradine are superb as two of the bad guys.  Even small roles are done well, for example the bush policeman and the village doctor.  The Warner Archives Collection DVD-R, though having no extras, is excellent quality.  Wish it had the trailer at least.  Otherwise highly recommended for adventure and particularly Tarzan film fans.",1434931200,,859,5.028368794326241

8392371,4,B0039UU3RS,"I can see why this one was voted the Best Tarzan movie Ever!

Overall, it is my favorite. Only because Gordon Scott had the look and feel. This movie was grittier and not filled with a boy tagging along for the family kid's sake, like sooo many Tarzan films do. This one seemed made for adults. Wished there were more like this.

With today's tech and awesome filmmakers like Zak Snyder, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron. can you imagine one of these directors making a Tarzan film?

The shame about this franchise is: Over a hundred years of Tarzan films, from silent to the one coming up in the next year or so, and they still haven't truly captured the awesome Tarzan in the books. We don't get this.

We are keeping our fingers crossed on this new 2016 Tarzan movie coming out. There has not been a modern CGI Tarzan film yet. The technology is there. The source material has been out for a hundred years. Can they possibly cross these two and make a GREAT and BEST Tarzan move ever?",1425340800,,986,4.430939226519337
