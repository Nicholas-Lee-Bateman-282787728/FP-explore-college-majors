6673198,1,B00NNZSMDQ,Do not waste your time. It had to be the first movie the grade school media class did. We lasted about 30 minutes ONLY because we paid to rent it. We both like the Arts and dancing. But this was neither.,1413244800,3,203,3.975609756097561

6673208,1,B00NNZSMDQ,"Throughout the whole movie the girl's mother keeps calling her youngest daughter fat, and telling her that she'll never be able to win awards looking like that. There were many more comments, believe me. If I had written them all, my review would be huge! So that's why I'm only giving this movie one star. The rest of the movie was great! I just hate how they had to screwup the movie with unnecessary comments, that get into girl's heads when they watch it. :(",1463616000,,462,4.447058823529412

6673212,5,B00NNZSMDQ,Great movie with fantastic music!,1459209600,,33,5.8
6673213,2,B00NNZSMDQ,"This movie just isn't very good. This is supposed to be a dance movie, but it doesn't have much dancing in it. Way too much time is devoted to the cringe-inducing supporting cartoon characters. The national competition dances are average and the plot is thin. The only interesting dances are Jasmine and Brandon's impromptu duet and J.T.'s (David Burtka's) dance during the credits. More time should have been given to Jasmine and Brandon.",1452988800,,439,5.027397260273973

6673234,1,B00NNZSMDQ,Waste of time and money.,1431302400,,24,4.0
6673235,1,B00NNZSMDQ,"Don't waste your money. I have seen a lot of dance movies and this is by far the worst written movie I've seen. Almost every character besides the 2 main characters are portrayed as stupid. The movie spends 75% of the time on all of these people and not on the 2 main characters which had great chemistry but what difference did it make? The dancing is excellent but the story ruined it all. I wanted to stop watching by the time I was halfway through. Some of my suggestions for best ever dance movies are: Dirty Dancing #1 & #2. Step Up #1 but the others are OK too. Honey #1. Center Stage & Center Stage,Turn it Up. Except for the premarital sex in some of these they were all well written.",1430438400,,693,4.2180451127819545

6673241,1,B00NNZSMDQ,Terrible... I feel this movie did a disservice to all other dance movies of its kind. Characters need lessons and the plot was aweful. Very bad story line and props. Was this a high school funded movie or professional? Very cheesy!,1426550400,,231,4.658536585365853

6673243,3,B00NNZSMDQ,"Two good dances.  Given the low price I paid for the DVD, that seems about fair.

I am a person who will buy and watch just about any movie that purports to be about dancing.  This one had some quality people associated with it. However, the movie looks like it cost about as much as a good car, and the script sounds like it was written over drinks one night.  I would venture a guess that most of the extras and bit players were people who helped fund the production.

Note: this is perfectly legit, IMO.  If you want to make a movie and you can pull off a successful Kickstarter and make it happen, more power to you.  I hope everyone got paid.  As a viewer, though, I found this particular movie not quite funny enough to qualify as a parody, not quite sharp enough to qualify as satire, and not nearly romantic enough to qualify as a romance.  It is, at least, mildly entertaining.

It reminds me a lot of one I saw years ago, called ""Shteps,"" which was a satire of the competitive ballroom-dance circuit, with a tinge of ""Miss Congeniality."" My husband said the movie reminded him of ""Best in Show"".  It would have worked better for me if any of the dancing in the movie (aside from the two pieces alluded to) had actually been excellent. The group numbers in this picture are seriously the worst I've seen in any dance movie to date, in terms of choreography, staging, and execution; you will have seen better on any given week of SYTYCD.  This may have been intentional, but given that the framing device is a national dance competition, doing so little with the dancing made it impossible to buy in.  I mean, dance fans know what top-quality dancing looks like, and this ain't it.

The central relationship is clearly meant to parody those in other dance movies, in which the two protagonists fall more or less instantly in love for no apparent reason, and in which one of them abandons the other right before the big contest. Kathryn McCormick, who is not at all a bad actress, is here given nothing to work with or play off of; there is zero chemistry.

I can't fairly say ""I don't like it"".  There were elements that could have made for an actively *good* movie, if a little more time had been taken with the script and if the production had decided which way they wanted to go with this (i.e. parody, straight satire, or sincerity).  There were a few laughs and those two good dances (both featuring Miss McCormick, no surprise).  But the prospective buyer can take my remarks above as a caution on what to expect here.",1425081600,7,2532,4.455531453362256
6673244,1,B00NNZSMDQ,Movie sucks no coordination between scenes,1424908800,,42,6.166666666666667
6673245,1,B00NNZSMDQ,Horrible story line and acting. The only good part was the dancing and it was not enough of it.,1424563200,,95,4.052631578947368
6673246,2,B00NNZSMDQ,"It's hard to watch a movie like this without comparing it to the Step Up series, or even Street Dance; and it certainly falls short when comparing it to those films.  The goofy comedy in the film simply felt out of place, and some of the characters were so irritating that it was a chore to watch.  I think certain things about this movie had the potential to make it a decent film, but honestly, the writing was just bad.  Honestly, I almost got the feeling while watching this that it was written by a high school kid trying to copy Step Up or Street Dance.  But it didn't have the character development, the music, or the choreography to even come close to what they were.  It just felt flat and didn't have that 'feel good' vibe that you got while watching those other movies.  So needless to say, I was a bit disappointed.",1422576000,,827,4.337662337662338
6673247,3,B00NNZSMDQ,Slow storyline. Liked the dances but would of liked to see more  between the two main characters as far as scenes and more dialogue Loved their dancing though especially at the warehouse.,1422403200,,187,4.84375
6673248,1,B00NNZSMDQ,This is atrocious!!! Worst movie I have ever seen.... Please save your money!,1419897600,,77,5.0
6673249,3,B00NNZSMDQ,"The premise of the movie is pretty cheesy, but the dancing is good.  It suffers the fate of most dance movies, which is down on luck group vs rich group with underdog winners.  If you are watching for storyline you will most likely be disappointed.  But if you are watching only for the dances, you will probably enjoy.  It has solos, duos, and group dances.",1419379200,2,358,4.461538461538462

8679385,3,B00NNZSMDQ,"I have no idea how to rate this movie!  It is really bizarre. I love dance movies, many I have watched with similar budgets are FAR worse than this one.  I actually was pleasantly surprised by the decent acting and actual fun dancing for a low budget (I assume) straight to video film.  It is just a REALLY insane film. It is really typical plot wise but there are these really weird choices and flourishes through out the film.  First of all there are these long, slow motion scenes, that seem to be there to pad the time and they seem to be trying to say something, but I am not sure what that is?  Like scenes of rabidly angry adults throwing luggage and tearing down clothing racks.  I THINK they are trying to demonstrate angry stage parents?  No idea.  There is a character they constantly show eating that leads to a really bizarre (but admittedly funny pay-off).  There are SO many strange character choices and random oddities.  It's not boring, it has some fun moments.  Dancing is framed annoyingly at times and..  well, just watch it.",1525824000,,1046,4.53475935828877

8679387,5,B00NNZSMDQ,"Most people wouldn't love it--however, if you are a dancer or were ever a dancer, particularly in the late 90's early 2000's you will TOTALLY get it! There are a lot of inside jokes for dancers but it is also a parody of how every dance movies is filmed. One of the key things that made me laugh is when the announce the names of the top 5 dances.....listen for it.

It takes you back and is just funny.",1524960000,,403,4.10126582278481
