8299687,2,B001EWVDDG,I didn't like the movie to much especially the ended. Part 1 was much better then part 2,1415404800,,88,3.9444444444444446
8299688,1,B001EWVDDG,"Saw this movie online at comcast, glad I didn't waste money...it sucked. It's a lamer Warriors type movie, much lamer. It could have been a LOT better with a fight coordinator and better quality of acting, writing, directing, camera work. Ok concept, not so well executed. The ONLY saving grace is that Donnabella Mortel is in it. She's not the best actress in this movie, but she's damn sexy as hell! I wish hollywood would remake this movie and make it quality, the basis is ok, just wasn't done right.",1413763200,,504,4.611111111111111
8299689,3,B001EWVDDG,"I bought Hood Rats 2 because from the trailer I saw it seemed like a female version of `the Warriors'.  Although it wasn't bad in the action department, Hood Rats failed to have any likeable characters. This made watching it progressively more annoying until finally I just fast forwarded straight to the fight scenes. There were two inter gender fights, four xena warrior princess style rumbles, and one very brief sex scene.",1350086400,,426,4.916666666666667
8299690,3,B001EWVDDG,"in a throwback to some of the dumb, silly exploitation movies of the early 1970's (or maybe xena the warrior princess) three girls seeking revenge beat the tar out of the leader of toughest gang in the hood (the 5th street gang). he's the guy who beat their pal (his girlfriend) into a coma. using baseball bats as their weapons of choice the girls then have to fight their way through every girl gang in the hood while trying to escape the gang leader's vengeance. the battles with the girl gangs are amazing, to say the least. the first gang it's a duel with baseball bats. next gang it's bats vs. chains. gang after that it's baseball bats vs. garbage can lids. surprisingly the lids win and the girls are captured and brought to the 5th street gang leader. after some abuse it's finally  time for the movie's climactic one on one fights between each of the heroines and the brutal, abusive male gang leaders. have no fear, the girls mercilessly pummel and defeat the male gang leaders and a new order is established in the hood. the movie ends with the now united girl gangs marching down the street proclaiming long live the queen! long live the queen! for the new boss of the hood. i found the movie amusing and entertaining (except for a boring bit with a fey british pimp that goes on too long). it's a solid  redbox rental if you like this kind of  nonsense.",1238976000,2,1367,4.46
8299691,2,B001EWVDDG,"So I became aware of this movie due to a friend being cast as an extra in one of the fight scenes. So I ordered a copy to show some support. Going in, I knew it wasn't a high budget film and, to be honest, the editing sort of demonstrates that fact. The most obvious proof of that is the final fight scene in the warehouse. The dialogue portion of the scene drags a little before the action starts. On the upside though, the girls give a 100% to the roles. June Marie Sparagna and Donnabelle Mortel add a spark to the, at points, thin script. There isn't gonna be an Academy Award nomination for the movie but it's an entertaining work. There are humorous scenes, action scenes, dramatic scenes, and even a love scene. A little bit for everyone. By no means is this a waste money.",1234396800,2,780,4.277027027027027
8299692,1,B001EWVDDG,"This was a terribly acted movie. The only person I was impressed with was the free spirited girl that was grooving to her Ipod (Scene 13?, Jamie Slaughter. Her character was the most believable of the entire cast.",1231718400,,213,4.631578947368421

The character 'Carla', a free spirited street poet played by Jamie Slaughter, brings positive relief as she offers sound advice to the Hoodrats on how to solidify the neighborhood against an abusive gang leader.

I researched this movie and, with the budget and timeframe allotted to shoot Hoodrats 2, the photography was exceptional and the actors believable.",1226620800,3,586,6.405063291139241
