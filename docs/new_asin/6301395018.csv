327368,2,6301395018,Typical of the era. Poor quality transfer. If you are bored and just want to watch an old western. You could do worse.,1395878400,,118,4.173913043478261
327369,5,6301395018,Great story and action. Really more about lost love and Great Depression. I suppose the cougar is a metaphor for it. Just a really solid movie.,1390176000,,143,4.538461538461538

327371,4,6301395018,"I agree with both reviewers, especially the comment that this film deserves better restoration than it has received. It's early Phil Karlson, and one can sense the grim sincerity, the commitment to theme and detail, and the simmering violence that were to explode in the fifties into the best of Karlson -- 99 River Street, The Phenix City Story, The Scarface Mob (the theatrical release version of the Untouchables pilot) -- and later into Walking Tall. Despite the muddy transfer, I became absorbed in this film. The scenes involving the cougar are unflinching and avoid cheating through editing -- would love to know how Karlson managed to film them!",1351296000,2,653,5.0
327372,5,6301395018,I bought this movie because it holds a special place in my heart.  Preston Foster and Forrest Tucker turned in their usual wonderful performances.  I especially liked their fight scene.  The Big Cat was causing real problems with the area ranchers and had avoided being put out of commission.  It has been a while since I viewed this movie as I purchased it while Mom was still living.  So I watched it with her probably in 2004.  Her and I saw it when it first came out in 1947 so it is special as we viewed it at a theater when we went to visit friends several miles from our home.  To see the huge scratch on the stock of the rifle Preston Foster was carrying when the cat attacked him was chilling.  Mix in romance of the sweet and innocent variety and a good old fashion setting out west and you have a great movie.,1321747200,4,820,4.211538461538462
327373,3,6301395018,"The Big Cat, 1953 film

This story is set in 1933 Utah during the Great Depression. The narrator tells of the great drought. A big cat (mountain lion or cougar) preys on Hereford cattle. The bellowing warns of danger! The next day Tom rancher tracks the cougar and finds a stranger walking in this wilderness. Tom has a conflict with a neighbor. ""The farmer is the man who feeds them all, the merchant is the man who gets it all."" The young man is from Philadelphia; he is Danny Turner, Lucy Hawks' son. Doris gets her ""wish book"". Prices for cattle are low. Danny arrives Tom Eggers' place. This upsets Gil. They pray for rain at the meeting. The story continues. The cougar attacked a mare in foal at Gil's place. The men gather for the hunt, their dog chases the cougar. Danny tumbles down a hill, the cougar runs away.

Doris talks at the meal. Scientific research did away with the tanbark harvest, and Tom's business crashed. ""Nothing lasts forever."" Danny plans to travel on. The Hawks are clearing brush from the hilltop. [Soil erosion?] Tom and Gil exchange opinions. So too Gil's sons and Danny. [Senseless violence?] Those synthetic tanning chemicals aren't good for fine skins, so the market for tanbark is returning. Tom shoots a buck. Does Danny have a problem? The cougar follows the deer. Tom follows the cougar, and finds a problem. ""He must've been crazy."" Danny plans to get the cougar. A dog will track the big cat to its cave in the hills. Danny enters after it. There is a struggle, but Danny kills the cougar. The bounty for its hide will allow Danny to go into the tanbark business and stay in this country. Raindrops mean the end of the drought, good times are returning. Will Doris find happiness with Danny? Maybe.

This is an average low-budget movie. I think those fights were cleverly staged. A lone dog would be no match for a cougar. Like some other family films there is an unspoken background to this story.",1297814400,,1941,4.604046242774566
327374,5,6301395018,"Operating with a limited in number but generally talented group of eight actors, director Phil Karlson, soon to be known for his essays into noir, here creates an engrossing adventure film set in 1933 depression and drought wracked southern Utah, and incorporates many of the elements which later will prove vital to his deserved reputation as an important narrator of urban crime. Residents of a small secluded valley are being tormented by a large mountain lion which, due to a shortage of water, has invaded their region to prey upon livestock, and the bounty for the beast of $150 is coveted by two long-feuding neighbours, one of whom, Tom Eggers (Preston Foster) provides a place to live for a city-bred young man (Lon McCallister), the son of the former love of his host and also the nephew of Eggers' rival, Gil Hawks (Forrest Tucker). The well-crafted scenario includes elements of romance, suspense and humour to the basic plot, and a certain darkness of tone has raised the work above most others of its stamp, with crisp editing (Karlson and Harvey Manger) prevailing, and we enjoy particularly fine performances from Foster and McCallister, with a pleasingly large role for veteran character actor Irving Bacon, a standout as a farmer doubling as a preacher.",1146268800,6,1271,5.0
327375,2,6301395018,"This movie made in 1949 (not 1933) but does take place in 1933 is a big adventure filmed in Technicolor. The story is on a par with a Disney wilderness adventure and shows Forrest Tucker in a good starring role as the head of the family of one of the feuding families.

A love story, suspense, action and beautiful scenery is diluted by the transfer from this budget release from Digiview. It actually looks like it was recorded from a VHS copy .... at slow speed! Maybe this hidden gem by director Phil Karlson will get a more respectable treatment. But for now, this is the only available release.",1109203200,5,599,4.495412844036697

In search of water, The Big Cat descends from the mountains and preys upon the livestock below. This movie, filmed in 1933, combines elements of suspense, romance and humor into a riveting script that climaxes in a heart wrenching finale that is sure to bring a tear to the most hardened of hearts",1100131200,,389,4.735294117647059
7811414,3,6301395018,"This review is for the DVD from NoseSilo Video pictured above.  The case says this DVD is ""Digitally Re-Mastered for Excellent Picture and Sound.""  There is nothing excellent about the picture or sound quality.  While it's slightly better than the many poor copies of this film that are available it's still pretty bad.  This appears to have been ""remastered"" from an old VHS tape from TV.  This is a public domain movie the copyright of which has expired.  The film itself is rather nostalgic and will appeal to fans of old family movies and Lon McCallister, if the poor quality isn't too distracting.",1499731200,,602,4.796116504854369
7811415,4,6301395018,"Very good Phil Karson film set during the Depression. Very personal with a vicious, violent fight between Foster and Forrest Tucker, a trademark of Karlson. he films the landscape like he films the streets in his films noir and gets a sense of oppression. The print is slightly superior to the VHS but not really restored",1496793600,,321,4.75
