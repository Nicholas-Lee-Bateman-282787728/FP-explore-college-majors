8610951,5,B0009Q06LS,"ive been practicing martial arts  28 years.  There are many videos out there that i watch  and  say  oh  that looks  familiar.  Sensei MacEwan  is  one  of the  most excellent aikido practioners ive seen . He first shows the classical Aikido technique  then show how to really apply it in combat.  I  also like how he shows how to use the same technique against various  attacks.  If you are interested in Aikido  or realistic martial arts--  and  I""m talking street self defense, not  mma--  then I highly recommend this dvd.
