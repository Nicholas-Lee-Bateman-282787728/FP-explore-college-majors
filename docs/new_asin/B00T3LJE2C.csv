6999834,4,B00T3LJE2C,"The movie itself it amazing! The actors/actresses, the acting, the fight scenes, the music, etc--worth all 5 stars! Enough cannot be said about it. However, this version sold here definitely loses a star due to the English subtitles. At many points the translation is just terrible! And/or at some instances the actors say something that does not even make it's way into the translation. For someone who knows the story, you can definitely manage to fill the gap where the subtitles fall short--but ugh!",1423872000,7,503,5.0
6999835,3,B00T3LJE2C,"The movie is awesome, the copy is terrible!! Bootlegged, with terrible translation to English. I only followed it because I've seen better versions. My advice- get it from someone else.",1423872000,,185,5.2
6999836,5,B00T3LJE2C,"I loved the movie, but this is super bootlegged because of the horribly broken English Sub-Titles. That said, i'm a Ken-shin fan so I knew what was going on, so I loved it.",1423267200,6,172,4.242424242424242
6999837,2,B00T3LJE2C,Must know the story behind this awesome movie to better understand what its going on. subs fall short in translation. they do not deliver the vernacular of the era. video quality its ok; could be lot better though.,1441929600,,214,4.657894736842105

6999842,5,B00T3LJE2C,"Way back when this cartoon was on every Sunday here in BELGIUM..... i use to watch this every , it had a outstanding message, and the fighting was really WAY ahead of it's time.... towards the end it really got dicey and this is why when the LIVE action came out WOW... the actors the way they pulled it off, i only down fall is trying to get the 2nd movie, i still have the old VHS.... yes this is right of the cartoon, however dam glad i have the 1&3 of the live action.",1433635200,,472,3.9789473684210526

6999844,4,B00T3LJE2C,"Everything that's been said about the movies quality is true. One thing I noticed in addition, is my copy had a bit of screen tearing (a slight jerking/fuzziness around the whole of the screen) at random moments throughout the movie. I'd say that the sub titles were done by someone with English as a second language, as the order of of the sentences is closer to how it'd be said in Japanese, but said in English.  Otherwise it's still a great movie, so much better than any other live action anime *cough Dragon Ball Evolution *cough that I've ever seen. If you know the anime and are a die hard fan, you'll enjoy these, if you can get passed all the other issues.",1430524800,,666,4.414634146341464
6999845,5,B00T3LJE2C,"What can I say, it was awesome!  Love the final battle with Shishio. I just wish that they would either animate or make a live-action movie for the Jinchu Arc.",1430006400,,159,4.3

6999848,2,B00T3LJE2C,"I was super excited to finally get this movie, but halfway through watching it (brand new by the way), it started skipping and freezing. At one point the skipping was so bad that it simply went back to the main menu page. I love Rurouni Kenshin, but this totally ruined the movie!!",1427932800,,281,4.423076923076923

6999855,5,B00T3LJE2C,Even though the subs were pretty bad I've been a fan rurouni kenshin  since it first aired on toonami back in 02/03 so adding this to my collection was perfect! I hope that they may continue and finish out the manga because that would be awesome!!!,1424476800,,248,4.391304347826087

8700148,4,B00T3LJE2C,"Not an official release, as far as I know. The disc was in good shape- played just fine, the subs were also decent-only a few mistakes/rough translations. Overall I would recommend this disc. The story was great, and well cast, these are the best live actions I have ever seen.",1489363200,,277,4.56

8700152,3,B00T3LJE2C,This is a great movie! I had to dock it stars because it's obviously bootleg. It looks like it's been done by someone who translated it to Chinese and then English. Some of the names are wrong and some lines aren't translated correctly. Still an extremely good movie.,1463788800,,267,4.583333333333333

Take pride in what you do,1452643200,,310,4.980769230769231
8700156,3,B00T3LJE2C,I would give it a five for the movie itself. But the subtitles were strange and this movie was not made by Warner Bros.,1449014400,,119,4.0
