8076271,5,B000A88EZU,"I appreciated the professionalism of the way in which this DVD was presented. The opening menu was very creatively designed, and there is a fairly adequate number of built-in options given the fact that this is probably not the kind of program that would lend itself to a lot of special features. The episodes themselves are presented in fairly reasonable condition. Obviously, they haven't been remastered into super Dolby surround sound with clear/vivid picture and mind-blowing clarity/resolution, but they are the genuine article transferred from the original master reels. Seeing as how the last time this program aired was a long time ago, the reels have evidently suffered a little bit of deterioration over the years, but were still in a condition adequate enough to make each episode more than presentable. The original Revue/MCA-TV logos are preserved at the end of each episode, which is a bonus (at least for me). You won't be disappointed if you pick up this up--there's most certainly some classic fun to be had when you see this show.",1361577600,,1049,5.0344827586206895
