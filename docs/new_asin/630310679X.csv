571750,5,630310679X,"The make up artists deserve all the praise they can get, but this series, while it has taken some historical liberties, is absolutely fabulous, and timeless.  It breaks my heart to not see this series available on DVD.  It truly deserves to be produced.  I was fresh out of high school when this series hit TV, and I was awe inspired by it.  The actual words spoken by FDR, Churchill, and Stalin are used, with a minimal amount of creative fluff to add a bit of frosting to a cake thatis already rich with historical facts, which are creatively put together to bring the viewer back to the time.

I must beg to differ on a few key points, though.  I do not believe for a moment that FDR said, ""I wanted my administration to end without war.""  America was preparing for it, and it was an inevitability.  The belligerents, and co-belligerents were getting overwhelmingly callous, and ruthless, and had to be checked.  FDR knew this, and I find a few scenes utterly unhistoric, and quotes taken out-of-context.  Things Churhill said in the house of commons weren't mumbled in blackened dark rooms alone.  Nonetheless, the story as it unfolded, the soundtrack, and the delightful acting makes it a gem that would occupy a spot on my shelf the day it comes out if it were released on DVD.",1161561600,12,1283,4.583333333333333
571751,5,630310679X,"This movie is quite literally my all time favorite movie. I saw it originally air on NBC way back when I was in 10th grade and I was awestruck by it. The acting alone blows me away and since I have become an actor and director in my own life, I look to this movie quite frequently for inspiration. The fact that a three hour movie where only five people even speak and every line of dialogue is historical accuracy can so captively hold an audience's attention alone speaks for its greatness. That being said, I can understand that this movie wouldn't be for everyone. In this age of dumbed-down, attention-deprived American culture, I doubt most people would be interested in this movie for more than 5 minutes. But, those who enjoy history or just fine acting, this movie speaks volumes. I actually intend to adapt this as a stage-play in the future. I can only hope that someday it get's released on DVD.",1139529600,34,907,4.536585365853658
571752,5,630310679X,"I am a Professor of US History and I teach classes that specialize in the first 50 yrs of the 20th century ( 1900-1950 ). This is an outstanding Docu-drama about the Allied Leadership an d the personal relationships between the Big 3 during WW2. It is both informative and entertaining. It accurately conveys the political and personal complexities involved. Even teenagers who watch this afterwards say "" WOW "". A must see film along with Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.",1108425600,10,481,4.878048780487805
571753,5,630310679X,"This is great entertainment and great historical drama.  It is based upon actual cables between Washington, London, and Moscow during the Second World War, and deals almost exclusively with the relationship between the leaders of these countries throughout the war.  Franklin Roosevelt (played by John Lithgow), Winston Churchill (Bob Hoskins) and Josef Stalin (Michael Caine) spring to life as real but imperfect people who nevertheless are great leaders fighting a great war.  Incidentally, the film focuses almost solely on the European war--the war against Japan is largely in the background, which has the effect of causing the film to somewhat diminish America's contribution to the war.  This is a minor quibble, however.  This is a wonderful film.
The miniseries does a wonderful job of juxtaposing dialog between the great war leaders with actual footage of combat scenes from the war.  It tells a great story in a highly entertaining fashion, and does a splendid job of showing the viewer some of the problems, controversies, and arguments between the allied powers while the three leaders struggled to hold together the greatest coalition of nations in history.
The striking thing about this film is that it never deviates from its theme--to tell the story of the allied war leaders and the problems they faced.  No bogus ""love interest"" material--this is historical drama with emphasis on the ""historical.""  In fact, only a few actors in this film even have speaking parts--Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Molotov, and Henry Hopkins are the only ones I can recall.
The acting is very fine.  I thought Lithgow did a great job as Roosevelt--although he looks and speaks differently than FDR did, he nevertheless pulled it off very well in my opinion.  Bob Hoskins was quite literally perfect as Churchill, and as far as I am concerned is virtually indistinguishable from him.  Michael Caine was taller and better-looking than Stalin ever was, but nevertheless did a great job in the role.  Ed Begley Jr. did well playing Henry Hopkins, although since I have never even seen a photo of the real Hopkins I have no idea if he were true-to-life.  Ditto Jan Triska as Molotov.
Wonderful historical drama that will draw and retain the interest of viewers interested in World War 2.",1053561600,51,2283,5.088471849865952

The production resembles something like you would watch on PBS, but the back and forth between these three guys overcompensates for that.  Lithgow looks very much like FDR, Hopkins nails Churchill's mannerisms, and you don't even realize that it's Caine who is playing Stalin.

Hot Toasty Rag, December 2, 2017

This three-hour miniseries is a bit of an acquired taste, so if I warn you of what you're getting into, youll be in a better position to appreciate it. First of all, its extremely wordy. David W. Rintelss script is well-researched, but it feels like hes written a play rather than a teleplay. With exception to the real-life war footage thats shownand that could be projected onto a backdrop onstagethe entire movie feels like a taped live theatrical performance. Secondly, it was written in a very unusual style: the three lead characters are in completely separate environments, but they have conversations with each other in the same scene. For the majority of the film, the screen is split in halves or thirds, showing the characters speaking in a dialogue as if they're in the same room, rather than separate countries. Sometimes it feels a little jarring or strange, but if you imagine you're watching a play and the stage is separated into thirds and lit up in accordance to whos talking, its much more entertaining. And hats off to the editor, John A. Martinelli, who no doubt had his hands full!

The film starts in 1941, months before Pearl Harbor, and follows the involvements and interactions of Winston Churchill, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin through the Tehran Conference in 1943. John Lithgow plays FDR, and while he looks very much like the president, he still sounds like himself. Bob Hoskins, on the other hand, is just the opposite. He doesnt look a thing like Churchill, but if you close your eyes, he sounds exactly like him! With Michael Caine as Joseph Stalin, you get the best of both worlds; not only is his appearance picture-perfect, but he puts on a surprisingly good Russian accent. The performances are very fun to watch, so even if you cant make it through the entire three-hour running time, at least watch a half hour of it to appreciate the acting.",1512172800,,1974,4.785923753665689
