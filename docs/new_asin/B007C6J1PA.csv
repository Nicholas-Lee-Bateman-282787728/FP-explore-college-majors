8603384,5,B007C6J1PA,"Not quite what I expected. What I expected was at least old film footage of Smith Wigglesworth preaching. Instead you see a 1 minute and 25 seconds clip of the only known film footage of Smith Wigglesworth to exist. Additional audio sermon of John Alaxander Dowie, I suspect before his fall, which was a great, short message. ""I saw The Glory"" is film footage of Lester Sumrall giving his testimonial account of knowing personally Smith Wigglesworth when he was in his 20s. But what made me give this purchse a 5-star rating? The bonus CD. The bonus CD consists of an MP3 audio recordings of George Stormont and David Duplessis in a few Holy Spirit anointed lectures what they learned personally from Smith Wigglesworth the secrets in being used by God mightly and powerfully. And that is a priceless find. I am so blessed!",1378771200,6,823,4.722222222222222
