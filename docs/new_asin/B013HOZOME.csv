7365586,4,B013HOZOME,"This is an  interesting documentary about a  million-acre wild animal reserve in Mozambique, Africa  attempting a come back after an aggressive twenty year devastating civil war.

Most elephants and other endangered animals were ""legally"" butchered to feed the people in conflict and as a resultant the remaining herds of elephants are extremely aggressive toward those who dare approach them. The conservationists  were desperately trying to gain their trust but  to no avail yet sponsored by the government and help from scientists the wild place was recovering.

The announcer and cameraman  is an American who was brought to Africa by his parents while still a  kid, and the idea of the film is to show how Gorongosa has been making a slow come  back to its  former paradisaical self.

Four stars because the narration and the picture  could be better, and the end of it is not as positive as I expected.

7365587,5,B013HOZOME,"This is a six episode nature documentary about Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park, a one million-acre paradise that is protected with some 130 rangers for last ten years when it became free of war some twenty years ago. Gorongosa National Park pretty much lost its wildlife due to a long civil war where humans consumed the wildlife especially the big game like the elephants where they ate the meat and sold the tusks every fifteen minutes so only tuskless elephants were spared. Now they have the biggest population of tuskless elephants in the world where they look so different than the average elephant with tusks. Scientists and conservationists are in a battle to restore wild life in one of the most ambitious wilderness restoration projects ever attempted anywhere for the size of this park. This is not a high action wildlife documentary; instead it is a conservation documentary, a testimony to human dedication and achievement by the government of Mozambique to restore wildlife where humans failed to honor in the past. There is a reason for every single creation of specie in the wildlife. Without big pray which takes out the sick, the weak, there would not be strong and healthy pool of animal genes and without predators all around, animals will not move around which will bring destruction to the vegetation life due to over grazing. It takes considerable planning, dedication, expanse, and knowledge and very long of time to bring back the wild when you see with all the issues that are exposed in this documentary but yet it takes so little to ruin and kill it all in a short period of time. Mozambique should truly be proud of their achievement only if they do not end up with another civil war which seems to be inevitable.

Bob Poole does the narration as well as the production pretty much with one other helper for the majority of the series except if they have to do aerial shooing. It is a different level of documentary since you become aware how sensitive animals are to the environmental changes especially to killings. Restoring wildlife is not an easy task and this documentary is certainly a window to the reality that unless human species get their act together; harming environment and wildlife simply means only one thing invitation to the destruction of a worthy life for humans on this beautiful blue planet called planet earth. Bravo, bravo, bravo.

Insure to watch episode five, called Battle Lions. What I saw in that segment about elephants and lions, I have never eve seen in any other documentary. Hair raising to say the least, these documentary productions truly requires guts, real guts.",1443225600,10,2636,4.894854586129754

Im Bob Poole.  Im in Gorongosa National Park.  Im a wildlife cameraman.

This park was once one of Africas greatest natural parks.  And unfortunately most of the wildlife was killed.  There was a terrible civil conflict here that lasted for many years.  The park almost died.

Now the Gorongosa Restoration Project is in the process of putting it all back together again.

Now Im actually telling a story about the challenge of bringing this incredible national park back to life.  And all the incredible people that are dedicating their life to doing that.

Its super exciting.  Im just thrilled to be here.  The cool thing about working here is that every day can throw you a curve ball.

The above comes at the very beginning of this spectacular documentary.  It is narrated by American-born, African-raised Emmy Award-winning wildlife cameraman Bob Poole who spends two years living and photographing in this park.

Gorongosa National Park is located in central Mozambique, a country in coastal Southeast Africa.  It occupies an area of about 3,750 square kilometers (1,450 square miles) or over a million acres.

This park at one time supported some of the densest wildlife populations in all of Africa.  But large numbers were reduced as much as 95% and the ecosystem stressed during Mozambiques long civil war (1981 to 1994).

Thus, the need for the Gorongosa Restoration Project which is attempting to restore the fabric of life in the park.  It is the most ambitious restoration project ever attempted.

Poole helps scientists do such things as dart and track the parks elusive lions, decode the behaviour (with his scientist sister) of the parks angry elephants, wrestle and study massive crocs, and helps relocate animals that were lost during the war.

But what stands out, of course, is Pooles stunning images of Africas biodiverse wildlife.

This series make the following statement true: this is one of the most exciting conservation stories happening in the world today!!

Finally, the DVD set (released in 2015) has three interesting extras.  All of them are interesting.

In conclusion, it doesnt get any better than this!!  If you want to see unforgettable images of Africas wildlife, then this is the documentary to see!!  I leave you with Bob Pooles final words in this series:

You know, everywhere you turn, theres a new story in this place.  Theres so many stories that haven't been told.  Weve just scratched the surface in this series.

But I think that the big story in this whole thing is the park itself, and to be able to watch it grow over time, thats what I want to do.  I just want to watch this place continue to grow because its going to be an amazing story.

I am watching this for the second time and I wish there were several more hours of footage.

It's a marvelous dvd that takes you into the process of trying to rebuild a park of this size that was decimated during a lengthy civil war.  Everyone involved should be proud of of their efforts to revitalize this amazing place!",1447632000,3,493,4.51685393258427
