8002185,3,B0000EMY92,"Lina and Naga are roped into saving a village from an Elfin curse. They meet some pretty interesting characters, and have an intense battle.

Generally I am very unimpressed by all of the Slayers OVA's. My biggest beef is that Lisa Ortiz doesn't do Lina's voice in the OVA's. The animation quality is also pretty slack. Even so, I'm a fan of the series and this OVA. I think that the reason I like this OVA is the interesting characters. It's not as ridiculous as some of the other OVA's either. If you like Slayers, then you'll probably enjoy this little tale.",1351036800,2,561,4.5
8002186,4,B0000EMY92,"I have every Slayer DVD published for the US market.  The best one is still the first one, namely the Slayer Movie.  The rest of the DVDs went down hill from there.  This is not to say that they are not amusing, but they just don't live up to the expectation raise by the first DVD.
These are what I like about this disk:
1. Great voice acting.  Both the English and Japanese voice performances are great.
2. Great background design.  The world of the Slayers movies is beautiful.
3. Fascinating characters.  Lina Inverse, Naga the Serpent and Selena are all cute.
These are what I dislike about this disk:
1. Not much of a story.  There were a handful of laugh out loud moments and not much more.
2. Not much animation.  If you look at the movie carefully, you will notice that in most part of the picture nothing is moving.  Only the character speaking is animated in most frames while the rest of the characters are infuriatingly still.
I recommend this DVD only to people who are fans of Lina Inverse and Naga the Serpent.  I will also recommend this DVD to people who appreciate good voice acting.  If you don't belong to either of these groups, you will probably regret your purchase.",1077667200,,1190,4.462962962962963
8002187,4,B0000EMY92,"Finally, more Slayers to add to my wonderful collection. God bless ADV films.  That said, I enjoyed this movie for the several laugh out loud moments that you can always count on with any Slayers release.  The story is full of really cool characters (including a female warrior monk, a colossus, a samurai warrior, and what appears to be a Mexican wrestler, to name a few) who each get too little time to shine. The bulk of this otherwise fast-paced film is a too-long chase scene in which too little happens for a short film with such a cool cast. The tertiary heroine (Lina and Naga being the primary and secondary) is a novice swordswoman who just wants to protect her village from an evil group bent on world domination.  Sure this ""group"" consists of only two people, but you should always aim high, right?  I was bothered (like everyone else) by the cutsey/squeaky quality of Lina's english voice.  It's not bad, but it just isn't comparable to Lisa Ortiz' legendary performances in the TV series.  I'm not a subtitle snob, but this time I enjoyed the Japanese version more than the english. I guess the only other real complaint about this adventure is that I left wanting more.  Really, that's a pretty big compliment.  If you liked ""Book of Spells"" and ""Slayers the Motion Picture"", you'll like this one as much.",1072051200,4,1321,4.663793103448276
8002188,5,B0000EMY92,"I would like to first say thank you to ADV for finally pulling the Slayers Motion Pictures out of the musty closet so Slayers fans can have closure on the Movie series. ""sort of""
The movie takes place after the defeat of Joyrock in Slayers Motion Picture and lives up to being a sequal. ""just not a direct sequal""  To me there is an equal blend to the comedy and action.  I own all the Slayers Movies on VHS ""Japanese of course"" and when I first saw this movie I literaly died laughing as did my friends...there is nothing more exciting than seeing a bunch of college guys rolling on the floor laughing at a cartoon :)  Anyway the gist is Lina Inverse and Naga the Serpent meet this girl ""Selina"" after they blow up a restaurant.  Selina's town has been imprisoned by a sect run by just 2 followers who are trying to unearth a secret weapon made by the elves.  It just happens that the elves left the thing buried next to Selina's town and gave them a vague warning not to unearth the thing.  Well the weapon gets unearthed and chaos ensues...if I say anymore the story will be ruined, rest assured it's funny! ""and yes Lina blows up lots of stuff""
I have been a Slayers fan for over 5 years now and everytime I show the series or movies to friends new and old I get the same reaction. ""OMG that's too funny""  I strongly recomend this to anyone who has a sense of humor and if you like it watch some more because ADV is blessing us with Slayers Great in January which ""IMO"" is the funniest Slayers yet!",1071100800,5,1502,4.249122807017544
8002189,4,B0000EMY92,"If you're a 'Slayers' fan like I am then, this movie is for you.  ""Slayers: Return"" has more action than laughs than 'Slayers: Book of Spells' and the motion picture.  It deals a little more on the serious side and does have some humorous moments. Nevertheless, this movie does entertain.
The movie stars our favorite heroine and sorceress supreme, Lina Inverse, and her self proclaimed rival, Naga the Serpent. (Sadly, the characters from the original TV series are no where to be seen...hopefully, ADV will quickly release the newest 'Slayers' movie called ""Slayers: Premium"" which has all the original cast!!) Also to note, all the Lina and Naga story lines are before the first TV season. They are hired by a young lady to save her village from a bunch of warriors.  The warriors are looking for a great treasure that is hidden near the village and are forcefully making the villagers search for it. Well, I'm not going to give too much away, but needless to say, things always go awry if Lina and Naga are apart of it!
As I said before, this installment of `Slayers' has more action than any of the movies/OVA I have seen so far. Also, the storyline is actually better than the first movie, although it's rather lacking in the comedy department (which is the reason why I gave this four stars).  Like all the movies/OVAs, `Return' does not compare to the original TV series.  Hey, but it's `Slayers' and I'm pretty happy with what I can get!!
I watched the dubbed version and it was ok.  They used the same voices from the previous movie and OAVs.  I feel they should of used the original English voice actress (from the TV series) for Lina.  The original English voice actress nearly captured the Japanese voice actress portrayal of Lina.  This voice actress doesn't come close.  Since it's a different company, they have to use their own actors.  Oh well. The animation (like all the OVAs/movies) is better than the TV series. As for the DVD itself, I didn't find any problems (although I haven't watched the Japanese version yet) and the menu was easy to use.  The movie was played in the letter box frame.  The DVD has (of course) the English and Japanese version with English subtitles.  For extras, it has the Slayers Return Trailer and the ADV Previews.
So, if you're really into the `Slayers' I recommend this movie.  It may not have a lot of comedy that one would expect from previous Slayers movies, but you'll get a better story line and a lot of action.  Also, it does not fail to entertain!",1069804800,11,2508,4.6275395033860045
