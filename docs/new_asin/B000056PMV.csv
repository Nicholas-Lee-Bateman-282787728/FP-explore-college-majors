1399591,4,B000056PMV,"A round of cheers for Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Bill Murray, Charlie's Angels was definitely a treat to watch.  It was fun, with lots of action and even an ok plot, what more could you ask for?  Here's hoping to see more of these girl together in the future :P",973382400,2,277,4.2075471698113205
1399592,4,B000056PMV,"I can say with certainity that going into this film, I really thought it would be as said in the preview, ""Another show from the 70's"" that was remade into a movie. It was better than I thought it would be. Being that I was not around when this show was still in production, I can not really give a review like an older fan could. The veiwer before me is right, this movie is for teens. I would have to disagre with him in the fact that teens would only like this, I went with a few of the ""older"" fans of the series and they thought it was great. I am not the kind of person or shall I say teen who would give this movie a 5 star just because of the stars. If I want to see a movie about the girls, I would see something else. I liked the plot. It was one of the better remakes I have seen.
Oh, on another note, see this movie with a computer guy, less in general, one who is into Palm Pilots. My cousin saw a ton of flaws in the Palm Pilot scenes and I did too. It was funny seeing a Windows program for only your desktop on a Palm Pilot. Maybe it was a special case being that it is a high tech kinda movie, I can understand.
Wow, I can not belive I did not give anything on the plot! I am glad about the ending, being that they did not show Charlie, up close that is. It maybe says that there could very well be a sequel in the makes. I would not blame them. I suppose they may have new Angels, or maybe not. I forsee in a third movie, maybe an introduction of a male Angel, oh yeah j/k or maybe just a new gal.
Hope I helped your descion either way...

1399622,3,B000056PMV,As a teenager in the '70s I along with every other male of my generation used to love Charlie's Angels.  As a movie I don't think this is as good.  Although I am older and it just don't have the same feelings for the movie.  As I had for the t.v. show.  Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore are great.  But to me Lucy Liu is sort of like Shelly Hack was in the t.v. show.  She doesn't fit in.  The movie has a lot of action and comedy and explosions.  It keeps you entertained.  It is sort of like Mission Impossible with a lot of disguises also.  And how the Angel's get into one situation after the other.,1482537600,,602,4.02542372881356

1399661,5,B000056PMV,Charlies angels are back in a great film. I gave it 5 stars but its not your normal 5 stars. This gets 5 stars due to the level in which you are completely able to switch of your brain. You can just switch off your mind and stare. Watch them talk but not listen. Watch cameron diaz dance in her underwear. You get the drift. You do not need a plot. This brain free entertainment at  its best.,1459036800,,392,4.0256410256410255

1399708,5,B000056PMV,"This is a great reboot of the TV show.  At first I was disappointed that it wasn't the original characters (other than Bosley) but now realize that it was a smart move.
When I tried the first DVD I received, there was no sound.  I have seen several reviews where customers had the same problem.  So I returned the DVD to Amazon and they shipped another one immediately.  When I tried that disc, same thing - no sound.  Then I noticed on the menu that there was an option for ""Audio Set Up"".  Once I switched it from DTS to Dolby, it played just fine.  So for all of the customers who complained there was no sound, you may want to try changing the audio setting.  I feel silly returning the first one now in retrospect, but hopefully this review will help others avoid the same mistake.",1434240000,3,786,4.299319727891157

1399715,4,B000056PMV,"Charlie's Angels is an action comedy film starring Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu. They are three women working for a private investigation agency. They're beautiful, they're brilliant, and they can kick your butt -- the most glamorous private eyes in the world are back in action in this big-screen adaptation of the popular '70s television series of the same title. It was directed by McG.

Natalie is the smart but silly one, Dylan is the tough but fun-loving one, and Alex is the classy but hard-as-nails one, and they work for a man named Charlie, who never meets his employees face to face. Along with their helper Bosley, the Angels are sent into action when electronics genius Eric Knox is kidnapped, with the nefarious Roger Corwin as the prime suspect. But they soon learn even bigger danger is afoot -- the kidnappers have gotten their hands on Knox's latest invention, a system that can monitor voice communication from anywhere in the world, virtually ending the notion of private conversation.

This entertaining confection possesses the substance of the TV show, the pacing of a Hong Kong action movie and the production values of a James Bond thriller. Also,it was a good view for people who love action and entertainment. There is nothing more it except that.",1428278400,,1288,4.9308755760368665

The colors looked off from time to time. Some of the skin tones looked orange at times. The sound lacked any real ""punch"". The bonus features seem to be carry over from the Standard DVD version.

1399807,1,B000056PMV,"Just pathetically bad. Did professionals make this or was it a junior high school project? Acting is atrocious. Special effects shockingly amateurish; in one shot I could see a wire pulling a metal plate in the back of someone's jacket as they reacted to an explosion. Dialog childish and stupid. Sex jokes crude and embarrassing. Not even two beauties such as Cameron Diaz or Lucy Liu were able to make this worth watching. Drew Barrymore, who is not in their league, produced this movie and put herself in it as well, out of vanity. She is a witless moron with no taste or intelligence. Her only claim to fame is an unusually druggy and dysfunctional adolescence. Due to a famous family, she is a Hollywood insider and has been able to survive in the industry, producing cheap commercial products which appeal to the lowest level of consumer taste.

The original TV series was clever, and the movie could have been a tongue-in-cheek delight. Unfortunately, it is a disaster. The Hollywood scriptwriters and directors who worked on this were simply the worst in the industry. Most appalling of all is that this trainwreck was a financial success - made a huge profit over its production cost. Depressing that the public will buy such dreck. This must give Hollywood a cynical sense that quality doesn't matter in their business, which is sad.

Also it spawned some kind of horrible sequel which is said to be even worse. Reviews of ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" talk about how much BETTER the first movie was!! Shudder. This must make the sequel THE all time worst movie ever produced.

The bottom of the Hollywood barrel.",1298419200,3,1627,4.82437275985663
1399808,4,B000056PMV,"From my point of view, this is one of those movies that you cannot take seriously.  If you do, you miss the fun of the entire film.  I simply took this movie for what it was; 98 minutes of entertainment in which I did not have to think too much.

We all know the now famous T.V. show from which this film is based.  This program was quite popular in its time.  If you really want to be brutally honest about the whole thing though, the original show was nothing more that a one hour T&A romp with some good action shots, little plot and, thank goodness, you did not have to do all that much thinking between commercials.

This movie is much the same...a sort of remake of the old T.V. version, only this one is on steroids.  The action is faster and better filmed, there was more exposure in the T&A shots and again, you really, really did not have to do any deep thinking.

I rather enjoyed all three of the actresses, Barrymore, Diaz and Liu as I have enjoyed the majority of films featuring these three on their own.  Bill Murray is of course there.  Murray is one of those actors you either like or do not like.  I have always been sort of neutral about him, but at least he does not annoy me...usually.  I must admit thought that his part in Caddy Shack was a classic.

Some of the scenes in this film and some of the one liners are truly funny.  The choreography on the action sequences is quite good; well, it is equal to most others in this genre you see in current films.

 Is this a great movie?  Is this a classic movie?  Did it deserve any awards?  Well, in my opinion...no.  But on the other hand I had to ask myself...was I entertained for a short while?  Yes, I was.  Would I go out of my way to see it again? Maybe, if it were free.  Am I sorry I watched it?  No.

I think the best way to enjoy this one is go get some popcorn, a Dr. Pepper, dumb down and just stare at the screen and enjoy.

1399810,3,B000056PMV,"Long before director McG directed films such as ""Terminator Salvation"" and ""We are Marshall"" and before he would be executive producer for TV Shows such as ""The O.C."", ""The Mountain"" and ""Fastlane"", McG was known for directing music videos for bands like Sublime and Korn.

But every director has their first start and for McG, his first theatrical debut was the 2000 film ""Charlie's Angels"" based on the Aaron Spelling produced  '70's television show showcasing sexy women taking on various disguises in order to defeat crime while following their mystery boss Charlie.  Known for boosting the careers of Jaclyn Smith, Farrah Fawcett, Kate Jackson, Cheryl Ladd and many more women who took part in the show from 1976-1981.

Featuring actresses Cameron Diaz as Natalie Cook, Drew Barrymore as Dylan Sanders and Lucy Liu as Alex Munday, the three take on crime alongside Charlie's assistant Bosley (played by Bill Murray), the three take on their latest mission to find the software genius Eric Knox (played by Sam Rockwell) who may have been kidnapped by Redstar owner Roger Corwin (played by Tim Curry).

While Bosley tries to get information from Corwin in regards to the whereabouts of Knox, the women follow the lead of going after a man who was was seen on surveillance videos ford kidnapping Knox, a man known as Thin Man (played by Crispin Glover).

Featuring action, sexiness, a variety of disguises and hair tossing, ""Charlie's Angels"", the film version continues the tradition of the popular TV shown for modern viewers and was a box office success earning over $264 million worldwide.

VIDEO:

""Charlie's Angels"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  For anyone who remembers this film, because there were so many mini-segments, there were many times the film would emphasize reds, blues, blacks and for the most part, the HD presentation shows off the vibrant colors on Blu-ray.  Contrast levels are well-done, colors really pop, blacks are nice and deep and there is a good amount of grain.

The film definitely delivered when it came to set design, costume design and it helps that McG worked with a talented cinematographer, Russell Carpenter, who worked on films such as ""Titanic"" and ""The Negotiator"".  This is a film that required various styles of footage and it helps to have an experienced cinematographer behind the camera.

If anything, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has proven to us within these past two years that they can take these past films and really make them shine on Blu-ray visually (and also via lossless audio).  Definitely a major improvement compared to its original DVD counterpart.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Charlie's Angels"" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film definitely shines via lossless from the opening scene with the jet flying and the engines coming from the surround channels and also hearing it via LFE to the battle with Thin Man and hearing the fight sequences, steel against steel, windows crashing and hearing them quite nicely through the surround channels.  Dialogue is clear through the center channel and the film does sport a lot of contemporary music and may it be from Destiny's Child to Blink-182, good amount of music as well.

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Charlie's Angels"" comes with the following special features (in standard definition, English Stereo and subtitles in Spanish and Portuguese):

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Charlie's Angels"" is one of those films that you don't take seriously and like the television series, you know it's going to be a bit kitschy but with three sexy women kicking ass, you just sit back and enjoy no matter how crazy the film may get and hopefully, you find something fun or entertaining about it.

If anything, ""Charlie's Angels"" is one of those films which is a straight-up action popcorn flick.  A film that you just don't come in and watch it with any high expectations and if there were any expectations, probably from those who watched the original TV series and wonder how the Angels and their sexiness would be displayed on the big screen.

Yes, you're going to see Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu in tight outfits, outfits that showcase cleavage and quite a bit of hair tossing but of course, you're going to get a lot of action and in this case, with the film utilizing world renown Cheung-yan Yuen (who was involved in major martial arts films with Jackie Chan and also the ""Matrix"" films) for the fighting sequences and putting these women through difficult training prior to the making of the film, the fight sequences were done very well.

Also, you can't help but be amazed by costume and set design for the film.  With every individual sequence created for each of the women, various costumes and disguises they had to wear, director McG and staff really went all out in making ""Charlie's Angels"" a fun, visual film.

With that being said, if one owns the DVD, is ""Charlie's Angels"" on Blu-ray worth it?  If you enjoyed the film, then the improved visuals and the lossless audio would make things worth it.  The special features are the same standard definition features that were included on the original DVD and although I have read that there were two Easter Eggs (which were part of the original DVD) included, I've tried many ways to figure where it would be in the Blu-ray version to no avail.

But what it comes down to is one's enjoyment of ""Charlie's Angels"".  Watching it again, I have to admit that I wasn't really getting into this time around and the watching it again, I admit I was even questioning myself of why I even enjoyed this film back then.  Yes, the plot was ludicrous and the dialogue and storyline was kitschy.  Even the talent in the film also found the dialogue kitschy, Bill Murray even found himself at odds with Lucy Liu verbally because he found the script to be ludicrous.  Even comedian Tom Green who has a short stint in the film thought the script was terrible but only participated because of his ex-wife (Drew Barrymore) asked him to.

But I'm not going to be invidious towards this film.  Because the TV show was also cheesy to begin with and having grew up around watching the TV series as a kid, I was not expecting anything deep from the film but I did expect the film to deliver in special effects and also with Cheung-yan Yuen's involvement, I was expecting to see a good amount of wirework and awesome fight choreography and the film did deliver in that respect.

There has been a lot of talk about a third film and I'm sure McG's style of filmmaking has gotten much better since the making of this film and hopefully with what he accomplished with ""Terminator Salvation"", if he was involved with the third film, maybe a series that could still incorporate the fun elements of the film but possibly less cheesiness.  Who knows?  I guess we'll find out if the third film does receive the green light.

Overall, ""Charlie's Angels"" on Blu-ray definitely looks much better and sounds much better than its previous DVD counterpart and if you were a big fan of the film or any of the talent, then this Blu-ray is definitely for you!",1282003200,6,8751,4.859649122807017
1399811,5,B000056PMV,"The greatest thing about `Charlie's Angels' is that it knows what it is and totally embraces it.  I mean, the film is not trying to be a serious take on a television classic.  Instead, this film is delivering up a comedic homage to the show that perfectly balances parody with sentiment to create something fresh, funny, engaging and unforgettable.  With witty dialog, surprisingly thoughtful character development and fight sequences that can certainly tangle with the best of them; `Charlie's Angels' is one-hundred-percent delightfully tacky fun!

The film centers on the Natalie, Dylan and Alex, three super spy action chicks working for Charlie, their mysterious boss.  Their next job has to do with a kidnapped programmer and a creepy `thin man', but really...plot?

Let's talk about hilarious comedic timing and overt sensuality combined with the perfect amount of testosterone bashing action sequences!

Casting Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu as the trio of kick-butt chicks was genius, even if I was semi-doubtful at first.  Diaz has splendid comedic timing is flawless and she really works that here, giving Natalie that geeky sheik flirtatious ditz vibe.  Lucy Liu has such an edgy strength to her, and her dominating sensual delivery is effortless and tantalizing.  Barrymore is just pure joy.  I love the spunky neurotic tones she delivers to Dylan, giving her this sensually commanding presence that gives way to a humanity that flourishes with her genuine spirit.

They are just fantastic here.

I can't think of a single thing wrong with this film.  I am not the biggest fan of the sequel, only because they played a lot of the same gags and played around too much with the CGI.  What I like about this film is that the action scenes play very authentic and realistic despite their outlandishly lavish qualities.  The film is exciting and unpredictable (in that I totally didn't predict this would be so much fun) and with hilarious performances by the entire cast, including Bill Murray (perfect casting decision), Matt LeBlanc, Tom Green and a genuinely creepy Sam Rockwell (not to mention Tim Curry and Crispin Glover), `Charlie's Angels' turns out to be the perfect popcorn munching blockbuster!",1268784000,4,2226,5.124653739612189

1399824,4,B000056PMV,"Charlie's Angels: 7 out of 10: Reading the major press reviews I am struck by a time travel quality of their pans. It is as if they are watching another movie entirely. It's as if they were watching the leaden Charlie's Angels sequel Full Throttle.

The first Angels however is a great movie if you keep three things in mind. It is mindless. It is fun. It is mindless fun. Never has eye candy had so many empty calories. As nutritious for your brain as a deep-fried Twinkie and with about as much substance, Charlie's Angels is about as quintessential a summer movie as you can get.

This is not a bad thing. With a great soundtrack, three hot girls, solid supporting cast and non-stop action even brainless fun can be' well good. It is not easy to make a film this shallow, this entertaining. (As the sequel proved and come to think of it dozens of movies prove every summer.) In reality there is a fine line between fluffy, bubble headed, featherbrained fun and feeble-minded, half-witted, imbecilic drudgery.

Charlie's Angels stays solidly on the featherbrained, fluffy side. It is that rather rare film that is smart enough to keep it simple and needless to say mindlessly fun.",1256256000,,1182,4.673076923076923

1399826,5,B000056PMV,"People have complained about things like the plot and all of those aspects.  The reason that they've made those sort of comments is because they're comparing it with Academy Award type films when this was NOT meant to even be nominated for an Oscar.  They were making this movie only to entertain.  The director himself even pointed out that this film is not Othello, and that it's not meant to be anything like that.

There was one time when a friend and I watched it at least three times within twenty-four hours.  It has a lot of action-packed sequences, amusing moments, and a pretty good soundtrack.  The action sequences are very exciting.  The amusing moments aren't meant to make you crack up.  After all these are Charlie's Angels, not the Marx Brothers.  The pretty good soundtrack is more of a matter of taste.  However, it includes a wide amount of music, ranging from the so-called nu metal of Korn, the classic rock of Heart, the R&B style of that time with Destiny's Child, the disco of Tavares, and a lot more.  Oh yeah, I forgot about the techno version of the Charlie's Angels theme song.

The angels are Drew Barrymore as Dylan, the rebellious one, Cameron Diaz as Natalie, the soft-hearted and free-spirited one, Lucy Liu as Alex, the formally educated one.  The characters come from very different backgrounds from each other, as do the three actresses.  Drew Barrymore is descended from a family of award winning actors and actresses, including Ethel Barrymore and John Barrymore.  Lucy Liu's parents were both Chinese immigrants, and she never spoke any English until the age of five.  Cameron Diaz got her start as a model, and her first acting role was a major role, after having had no acting experience at all.

Bill Murray also adds some humor into the movie.  His role is different from what he did in films like What About Bob? (a film where Murray stars as a mental patient who stalks his therapist, when the therapist's family thinks he's great) or Groundhog Day (a film where Bill Murray stars as a TV host repeating the worst day of his life again and again).  The difference between the two films I just mentioned and Charlie's Angels is that Bill Murray isn't the star, but he does a great job as a supporting character.

All in all, this movie is perfect for what it is, a fun action movie, but if you want the type of film that will win an Academy Award, stay away from this film.",1231286400,,2418,4.605140186915888
1399827,3,B000056PMV,"Charlie's Angels (2000) And they all grew up to be successful movie actresses and they made sure this series became one to make the jump to the Big Screen. It follows the successful blueprint of The Brady Bunch Movie: take the concept of the series and subvert it in some way. The filmmakers wisely clue the audience in right away, having one of the characters verbally deride a (fake) feature film called TJ Hooker-The Movie. With that sense of humor, this feature proceeds to have a grand old time poking fun at the semi-campy series it was derived from.
  We follow Drew Barrymore (also one of the film's producers), Cameron Diaz (There's Something About Mary), and Lucy Liu (Payback) through a lot of fast paced action nonsense that takes satiric jabs at everything from Mission Impossible to the Matrix.
  And it is a lot of fun. You do have to be in the mood for this kind of ""wink wink nudge nudge"" romp, but if you are, there's plenty here to enjoy, from flashy visuals to the three leads' beauty, from the scenery chewing bad guys to good ol' Bill Murray, adding his usual hint of the absurd as aide de camp Bosley.
  Now, apparently not everyone has the sense of humor needed to enjoy this, as there is not one single television Angel cameo to be seen, but thankfully John Forsythe once again lends his wonderful voice to the Angels' never-seen boss, Charlie.

Later, Kelly Garrett was replaced by JULIE ROGERS (played by Tanya Roberts), and Sabrina Duncan was replaced by TIFFANY WELLES (played by Shelley Hack).

  In the year 2000, director McG, had brought us the film, CHARLIE'S ANGELS, with three of today's gorgeous actresses to portray Charlie's third batch of angels. CHARLIE (again played by John Forsythe) has recruited three new angels. The angels are: NATALIE COOK (played by Cameron Diaz), DYLAN SAUNDERS (played by Drew Barrymore), and ALEX MUNDAY (played by Lucy Liu). These angels, are the third batch, after Jill, Kelly, Sabrina, Kris, Julie, & Tiffany. JOHN BOSELY (played by Bill Murray) is still their loveable sidekick.

  The angels' next assignment is to find a young man named ERIC KNOX (played by Sam Rockwell). His assistant, VIVIAN WOOD (played by Kelly Lynch) is the one who made the discovery of his kidnapping. She believes ROGER CORWIN (played by Tim Curry), head of CORWIN COMPUTER COMPANIES is responsible. The angels and Bosely head over to Corwin's big party bash to rescue Knox and to capture his kidnapper, who is only known as CREEPY THIN MAN (played by Crispin Glover). There, Dylan and Alex pose as Bosely's dates, where Natalie poses as a waitress, where she meets PETE KOMISKY (played by Luke Wilson). They find Thin Man and chase him down an alley, fight him, but he runs off, where the angels find Eric Knox and rescue him.

  Knox was kidnapped so Corwin could get his hands on Knox's computer software that has something to do with cell phones. The angels have to get into the Corwin building and retrieve it, but they need the authorization codes to get in. Two operators have this. The first uses his eye pupil for the identification, where the second uses his fingerprints. Dylan makes a copy of the second employee's handprints, where Natalie makes a lense of the first employee's eye. They get in successfully and retrieve the software.

  While Natalie is on a date with Pete, where the two find themselves going steady, Alex is with her boyfriend, JASON GIBBONS (played by Matt LeBlanc, aka JOEY TRIBBIANI from Friends). Well, Jason isn't with Alex. Jason is on the set of his first movie, MAXIMUM EXTREME. Alex lives with Jason, where she is cooking him something. But while she is doing that, the trailer is shot up, leaving Alex unharmed. Jason arrives, but doesn't get much of a chance to talk to Alex, since she has to run to Natalie.

  Natalie is in the bathroom at a club, where she is nearly killed by a thug. The thug works for...Vivian Wood. Vivian had planned this whole thing for some unknown reason. Dylan is with Knox, where the two have just slept together, but Dylan gets a surprise when she finds Knox with Vivian and the Thin Man. The three are working together. Knox believes that his father's death was planned as a murder and he believes that Charlie had done so, which is why he used Corwin as the culprit. The computer software was used to locate Charlie, so Knox can kill him.

  The next day, the angels head out to Knox's hideout, where Natalie battles Vivian, where Alex battles, the Thin Man. Dylan helps her friends escape, as Vivian and the Thin Man are blown up with their hide out. Knox is on a jet, loaded with missles, where he is headed towards Charlie's beach house. He fires the missile, but the angels are on the sides of the jet, where they jammed the missiles. Dylan enters the jet, beats the sh*t out of Knox and jumps off with her friends by her sides. They did not jam the missiles, the cut his breaks, and reversed the missiles, where missile returns to Knox and blows him up.

  The angles have done it again. Charlie has a way of picking gorgeous employees, who have the qualifications of kicking a** and saving the day. This lineup of Angels was great. The girls looked great and they kicked a**.",1118534400,4,4242,4.705405405405405
1399872,1,B000056PMV,"Is it possible for one's brain cells to commit suicide? Is it possible for an IQ to drop in the matter of an hour and a half? I have pondered these and other mysteries of life in watching Charlie's Angels. The ""angels"" if that's what you would term the three scantily clad, bubbly women, truly fall from grace in this movie. The idea of three women kicking butt and saving the day is appealing, but must they do so only by looking sexy and stupid in the process. The martial arts sequences, if that's what you would call them, do little to actually kick butt. The plot, as in the second movie, (yes I was a masochist and forced myself to watch the second movie to see if an redeeming qualities exist)is severly lacking...Angelic...no they are not...With three recognizable and at least somewhat talented actresses it is surprizing that the movie could dizzy that far down into stupid, predictable and brainless",1117497600,3,910,4.658385093167702
1399873,4,B000056PMV,"A rich computer genius - the inventor of a revolutionary new voice recognition technology - has been kidnapped, and somebody's responsible! Who can ya call! (cue the music). With nowhere else to turn, the genius's beautiful partner calls on the famed Charles Townsend Detective Agency, whose business end is managed by three beautiful, tough and resourceful ladies who once...well, we never find out what they once were, but that doesn't matter since there appears little if anything they can't do.  Of course they're not as mysterious as the identity of the reclusive Charles Townsend, but they get more high-energy action here.  (Personally, I think he may be linked to the shadowy Blake Carrington, but that's just my theory.)

Each Angel epitomizes this differently - with Alex (Lucy Liu) being the most resourceful, Dylan (Drew Barrymore) as a tomboy who can fight off a quintet of baddies while tied to a chair (in a scene that riffs on a drugged and chair-bound Schwarzenegger's telling his captors exactly how he'll escape from his cuffs and what he'll do when he's out in ""True Lies"") and Natalie (Cameron Diaz) who won't let an epic judo-death match get in the way of snagging a date. Director McG knows that TV franchises haven't been doing that well on the screen (anybody catch ""Mod Squad""?) so he turns the film into a cross between an extended music video, a parody of action movies and a barb aimed at the idea of taking TV to the big screen. (The film opens on an airplane where 1st class passengers are forced to watch ""TJ Hooker, the Movie""). The  strategy works mostly because of the power brought by the stars who know when to team up and when to grab the spotlight. With plenty of matrix-style fight scenes, every fight seems to bend the laws of gravity. The film also works on the strength of the co-stars - Bill Murray bringing his deadpan shtick to Bosley, but also Tom Green as Dylan's semi-psychotic boyfriend, Matt LeBlanc doing his Friends routine as a low-wage actor in bad movies, but also Crispin Glover as the psychotically silent android-like killer who enforces for the bad guys.

I enjoyed the Martial Arts and fighting in this movie. Charlie's Angels could be enjoyed by both men and women!

I chuckled throught the movie a few times but did not laugh myself so hard, I would pee my pants! I would definitely say if you were out looking for a comedy, this would not be the one for you.

Reports of Bill Murray and Lucy Liu refusing to work with each other, rapidly inflating budget, and former angels declining cameos had many folks apprehensive about the film's success.  But the finished product was refreshing and worth waiting for.  Ironically, in persevering with the film,
 the three young stars and co-producers, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Liu followed the Angels' creed of never giving up and believing in yourself.
From the familiar opening strains of the TV show's music to the end, the movie remains true to the original series, yet is modern and updated.  Barry is cute, Liu is tough, and Diaz simply dazzles.  Lots of humor and action make this film a must-see.  There is one especially hilarious scene that makes fun of engineers.  Two of the angels dress up as men, and Liu dons a black leather miniskirt to distract the men.  It works very well as the engineers are all falling out of their seats and looking at her in awe as she works the ""dominatrix"" role.
And it is great to have John Forsythe back as the voice of Charlie.  At least he was a good sport about it; a true gentleman like Charlie!",1086825600,4,1220,4.685446009389671

That's enough for any teenage boy (or for anyone who once was a teenage boy). Mostly, the pretty women do stuff with their clothes on, which should keep mothers of teenage boys reasonably happy.
The action is good, the fights are nicely choreographed, the wire-work is outstanding, and the effects don't take over from the very capable actresses. The plot won't be an intellectual challenge for anyone over about age nine, but that's fine.

If you're thinking there are similarities between this and The Matrix, you'd be right. It's the same guy who choreographed The Matrix fight scenes, who did this as well. I also saw similarities between this & Mission Impossible. There is probably a lot more similarities, but there's always one film 'borrowing' off another these days - I'm just beginning to notice it more and more.
OK, so this film is showing that girls can kick some butt when they want to, and can be ""independant women"" and not have to rely on guys to do their dirty work for them. So how come Cameron Diaz's character goes all gooey, whenever that guy she met at the bar phones?! That's being independant alright.
Three minutes into the film, I spotted a major flaw. Maybe it was just me, but I thought if you opened the doors on a plane and jumped out (which of course, everyone has done at least once), everyone else on the plane got sucked out after you? I'm basing this after seeing Final Destination too many times.
Who's your favourite Angel? Personally I couldn't stand Cameron Diaz or Lucy Liu. Cameron is normally so great in a lot of the roles I've seen her in, but in this, she played up the dizzy blonde act a little too much. Drew Barrymore is the greatest Angel, and had the pizzazz to keep the film going, and keep the viewer watching. And she seemed the least fake out of the three.
I'm hoping the second film will be better. This movie was fun to watch, don't get me wrong, just could have been better. There are a lot of gratuitous shots of the girls, mainly for the guys, but it gets a bit tiresome after a while for the girls watching!

1399906,4,B000056PMV,"""Charlie's Angels"" brings the 70's cop chick thriller to the big screen.  Overall, the movie is lean on storyline but BIG on eye candy, be it the special effects or of course, the three lovely leading ladies.  While the movie may leave some to be desired the DVD features are abundant in solid extras.
THE MOVIE:
The Story:
Natalie, Dylan and Alex (Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu respectively) are secret undercover operatives for a mysterious benefactor named Charlie.  Together the girls try to balance their undercover lives and normal lives.  This time around the girls must find a kidnapped computer scientist and keep the powerful technology he's developed from falling into the wrong hands.  The girls go under deep cover (under various disguises and in various locales) to get to the bottom of the case using both their sex appeal and their kung fu to take out the bad guys and save the day.
The Cool Stuff:
While the storyline and storytelling are easy to lose track of (the movie moves at breakneck speed), you should be really entertained by this flick.  The various locales, costumes and situations the girls get themselves into are hilarious.  The action sequences (very much Matrix and Hong Kong Kung-Fu inspired) are passable.  Overall, the film is very much enjoyable if not blow away.  The movie works as an action-comedy flick.
Best Scenes:
1. The Matrix-inspired alley fight
2. Massage therapy scene
Movie Grade:  3 stars out of 5.  Decent action and comedy.  So-so story.
THE DVD:
Where the movie is just alright, the DVD itself more than makes this a great viewing experience with a bounty of extras.  Among the goodies included here are:
1. Commentary - always insightful
2. ""Getting G'd Up"" - 6 minute feature on the director McG.
3. ""The Master and the Angels"" - 7 minute feature on how the girls trained for the fight scenes plus wire work.
4. ""Welcome to Angel World"" - 4 minute feature about the movie in general
5. ""Angelic Attire"" - 3 minute feature on all the costumes the girls wore.
6. ""Angelic Effects"" - 6 minute feature on all the cool CGI effects.
7. ""Wired Angels"" - 2 minute feature on the alley fight
8. 3 Deleted Scenes
9. Outtakes - this is basically the video that roled during credits, w/o the credits
10. 2 music videos:  ""Independent Woman"" by Destiny's Child and ""Charlie's Angels 2K"" by Apollo Four Forty
11. Cast and Crew Bios
12. Trailers:  The theatrical and teaser trailer plus trailers for other movies.
THE VERDICT:
Overall the movie makes a decent rental.  The action, FX and comedy are decent.  Indeed, the movie is probably way more comedy than it is an action thriller.  Fans of the women should be pleased with the movie (chicks who kick butt, oh yeah!!!).  The movie isn't a total blow away, but it's fun.
The DVD extras definitely put this over the top.  For myself, the features were probably way more interesting than the movie itself.  Again, the features are a great insight into Hollywood and how films are made.
Final Grades:
Movie:  3 stars
Extras:  5 stars
Total:  4 stars

1399915,4,B000056PMV,"Who doesn't know the story off Charlie's Angels, the crime fighting foxy girls employed by a millionaire whose identity will remain hidden from the viewer?
Let's get one thing straight. If you're looking for a plot that makes real sence, a life-based story, or an intellectual movie, this is not for you. However, if you're just interested in watching a movie built around three gorgeous women, crammed with lots of action, and with it's hilarious moments? Then this is the movie for you.
Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu are Charlie's Angels, three foxy ladies who are hired by a millionaire named Charlie to solve cases from his clients.
The movie starts with an action-crammed scene involving skydiving from a 747. A hijacker is planning on blowing the plane up, and the Angels prevent this from happening.
Finishing that assignment, the Angels' next mission is to infiltrate into an organisation suspected of cyber-crime. Using their superb skills in the fields of technology, disguise and martial arts, the Angels manage to gather enough evidence to build a case against the owner (Played brilliantly by Tim Curry) of the rival company of their client.
As it turns out, this mission is not without dangers for anyone involved. The Angels have to put al their skills into making sure the happy ending is reached.
The special effects in the movie are nothing new (The Matrix mostly), though there are some interesting shots (I for one loved the opening scene). The musical score is abosultely great (...).
The real power of the movie comes from the performance and interaction of the three Angels (Diaz / Berrymore / Liu). On my opinion, particularly Cameron Diaz (sporting her ever-gorgeous smile) and Drew Berrymore (playing a seriously sexy Angel) draw attention to themselves. Tim Curry also makes for an excellent performance, but the viewer can definatly sense the chemistry between the 3 angels.
Funny side performances are made by Tom Green and Matt Leblanc.
The DVD is packed with lots of good extra's. Stuff like outtakes (bloopers / deleted scenes), Special Effects (making-offs), deconsturction of scenes etc make the DVD definatly worth it's money.
Again. If you're looking for a movie with a tight plot, don't bother. But if you're willing to just lay back and watch the show, then this movie is definatly worth it.",1063843200,,2342,5.007692307692308

Why can they fly? I found the effects to be...and contrived, the laughs to be forced, and the ""girl power"" message to be lost in a maze of bad acting and cleavage.

1399936,4,B000056PMV,"This is one of those films, like THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI ACROSS THE 8th DIMENSION, that is over-the-top absurd.  Like Buckaroo Banzai, who was simultaneously a rock star, surgeon, scientist, and super adventurer, the three Angels in this film are all improbably talented.  By the end, they all started reminding me of Barbie dolls, and all about as convincing as a Barbie doll in each incarnation.  We get Kung Fun Barbie Doll followed by Computer Nerd Barbie Doll to be followed by Race Car Driver Barbie Doll.  At no point are any of the girls the tiniest bit convincing in their rolls.  In this regard, the film is as ridiculous as the original TV show, which despite being a hit was, in my mind, one of the worst shows ever.  The difference between the two shows, and what makes this film fun instead of awful, is the fact that the movie clearly intends all of this tongue in cheek, as a long, silly joke.
The problem with the movie is that while a self-parody is always fun, it isn't always a great self-parody.  Too many scenes are intended as a joke at the girls' expense, but it isn't developed with any wit or charm or skill.  That doesn't mean the film isn't slick; it is.  But as a whole the film doesn't live up to its own expectations.  There just isn't much depth or purpose, except to show three impossibly talented and beautiful women you simply can't accept as being that talented (though the beautiful part is easy).
The girls are well cast.  I always find Drew Barrymore to be adorable.  Cameron Diaz is fun, and is extremely convincing physically in her stunts.  She is not, however, at all convincing as a guy-shy female.  Lucy Liu provides good visual and ethnic contrast to the other two, but I don't like the bitchiness of her character, and while I completely applaud using an Asian actress in a major role, I just find her an almost completely unlikable actress, and her semi-dominatrix aura gets very, very old very, very quickly.  Undoubtedly this is because I have read too much about her in media gossip rags.  I have read that Thandie Newton originally was tagged for the role, and I wish that had happened.
In the end, the film just doesn't quite gel, but because it doesn't take itself too seriously, it manages to be fun anyway.  This is one of those films that's great to watch on a Saturday night with a bunch of friends, when you can simultaneously enjoy and laugh at what's happening.  Laughing is OK; the makers of the film expect you to.",1055548800,,2487,4.550561797752809
1399937,5,B000056PMV,"With all the rumored problems on set, including the much talked about Lucy Lui-Billy Murray fued and an escalating budget, I didn't know what to expect from this update of the classic 70's TV show. I was pleasantly surprised.
Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and of course, Lui are the perfect angels and they can definitely kick...!!! An unexpectedly entertaining blend of comedy and action, Charlie's Angels definitely doesn't fit the typical mold of a remake that never should have been made.
Ultra-slick directing. Fun cameos. Cool dance sequences. Awesome stunts. It takes girl power, tosses in some Jimmy Bond, a little Mission Impossible spy mumbo-jumbo, three hot babes kickin' Matrix-type arse, a rockin' soundtrack, cool cars, a cold-cocking start, some fun credit outtakes, inside jokes left and right, and makes it all feel sooooo good. And the girls honestly seem to be having a great time here. Lucy Liu, rock solid as the most well-rounded angel of them all, smart as a whip, sexy as a vamp and tough as nails. Diaz, cute as a button, reminding everyone why we all fell in love with her in THE MASK, and Drew Barrymore, one girl who should be doubly commended for taking part in the production side of this fluffy gem as well.
If you expect to take this movie seriously, stop right now and don't bother seeing it. This film is made for people who are looking for a punch-across-the-face kinda time, mixed in with a quick Tequila pick-me-up and a nice, thick, gooey wad o' cheese.

1399938,5,B000056PMV,"Charlie's Angels (Superbit Deluxe) is finally here with the release of the sequel coming in less than a month. Included in this DVD are two discs; one with the movie and one with special features. The only differences between this version of the DVD and the original version of the DVD is the fact that it includes a free ticket to go see the sequel (so I'm told) and it includes a behind the scenes look and trailers of the sequel as well. The audio commentary from the original version is missing, but I hear the quality sound of this movie more than makes up for it.
Charlie's Angels is an incredible movie. If you want to watch a movie that's fun, sexy and has a ton of special effects, then this is the film for you. The movie was a giant hit at the box office and proved to nay sayers once and for all that their is an audience who enjoy watching women be action stars and having fun while they do it. No one does it better than Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu who play secret agents Dylan, Natalie and Alex. With their super cool accessories and high tech gadgets, the angels fly high on their missions, prepared to be the ultimate angels of destruction. Their use of martial arts and skillful technique more than proves that you don't need guns to be a badass.
The story is pretty simple. There's a mad man out to kill Charlie and bring the angels down along with Bosley (played by Bill Murray). With the help of a locator device rigged in a satelite to tap into people's phones, it's up to our three heroines to save the day and rescue their boss, a man they see as a father figure. Charlie's Angels is so great because it combines this drama with alot of silly comedy and a ton of action. The actresses bring their characters to life and give the viewers a sense that they truely get along. The bond the girls share is obvious and it makes the movie that much more charming.
Natalie (Diaz) is a sweet, ditzy, fun loving girl with a thing for dancing in her underwear and flirting with everyone from the UPS guy to a bartender named Pete (played by Luke Wilson). She loves Soul Train, Jeopardy and is a terrible driver.
Dylan (Barrymore) is a no holds barred rebel with an attitude as fiery as her red hair. She's the least sensible of the trio and always gets herself into trouble, but has the right moves to get herself out. Her boyfriend, Chad (played by Tom Green), is a goofball who lives on a boat.
Alex (Liu) is the brain of the operation. With her her dominatrix style martial arts and her skills to defuse bombs, she's the angel most likely to not need the other angels. Her boyfriend, Jason (played by Matt Leblanc), is a less than bright actor.
Alot of people compared this movie's action sequences to that of The Matrix, but I think this film takes it up a notch or two. On their own the angels are deadly and ready to defend themselves, but when they're together they're unstoppable.
I really loved this movie. The action and special effects are breath taking. The girls are genuinely funny and easy on the eyes. The plot is light and doesn't take itself too seriously and often pokes fun at itself and all the ""Charlie's Angels"" cliches. It also stars Sam Rockwell, Vivian Lynch and Crispin Glover who turn in three fine performances as evil villians.
If you haven't seen this movie, see it. If you don't own it, buy this Superbit Deluxe Edition and enjoy it on the finest format available. Charlie's Angels is a great movie for guys and girls who like to laugh, see a specticle and watch a movie where the girls kick butt.",1053907200,2,3556,4.3975720789074355

It's too silly, ridiculous, and cheesy to take seriously. It's impossible to care about, but fun to watch. You'll probably be making fun of the movie throughout. It bugs me to see so much time and effort be put forth for something so absolutely stupid, but some people think stupid is great.

1399952,3,B000056PMV,"Natalie Cook (Cameron Diaz), Dylan Sanders (Drew Barrymore), and Alex Munday (Lucy Liu) return in this 2000 rendition of the popular Charlie's Angels TV show.  And as it rides in the waves with films such as 'Coyote Ugly' or even 'Legally Blonde', it's an all-around fun time, and a good movie.  With the plot seemingly lost or trivial at points, you'll find yourself enjoying the movie because of the looks of the three leading ladies as well as for the action sequences.  And those action sequences, although you may not think it, are actually pretty good.  Grant it, it's not a James Bond movie nor is it Tom Cruise; yet you will be, to some extent, impressed.
As I said before, the plot is not that vital.  But as a high-tech programmer is captured, the three girls (along with their docile boss Bosley, played by Bill Murray) set out to rescue him.  The plot takes many turns in many different directions; whether it be towards comedy, action, or even romance.  And as the movie moves on, you'll soon find each character being faced with ""relationship"" problems, so-to-speak.  Lucy Liu's character finds herself having trouble hiding her identity (from Friends' star Matt LeBlanc); which is a bad take-off of those Superman movies.  Drew Barrymore soon falls for the kidnapped programmer (Sam Rockwell, who played the killer in 'The Green Mile').  And Cameron Diaz's character finds something in Luke Wilson (from 'Legally Blonde' and 'Old School').
Once the film starts heading in the romance direction, you begin to lose interest.  But the action brings you right back.  I gave this movie only 3 stars because I was disappointed with the legitimacy of it.  And some of the romantic scenes were not necessary and a bit weak.  It's too much a take-off of the Bond movies, although it is still decent.  And the supporting cast also features some good appearances and cameos; ranging from Tom Green to the original voice of Charlie, John Forsythe.  All in all, 'Charlie's Angels' is just an average action movie, with a more 'fun' twist to it.

YOu may say that they ""updated"" the scenario for our time. THat's not true. THey simply used the title and concept and changed EVERYTHING, to make this a kind of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE with women. Of course the director chosen was a video-clip director, to make sure the movie hides the total lack of plot, and tries to survive only in the action sequences.
I watched it. I did not like it. Barrymore, even with tons of make-up, is not a beautiful  or charismatic woman. Only Cameron Diaz saves herself here.

1399954,4,B000056PMV,"I loved Charlie's Angels as a kid. (Contrary to one of the other reviewers so far, it was not a sitcom, by the way.) Of course, back then I truly regarded it as little more than ""jiggle TV"", but hey, they were three gorgeous women who were intelligent and independent (throw your hands up at me!).
This movie echoed the Girl Power upon which the original series was built, and kicked it up a notch to bring it into the new millenium. The women are, of course, gorgeous yet hard as nails in their pursuit of the bad guys. They're smart and can kick some butt. And they still have endearing neuroses in their personal lives, which is a great change from the TV series, which seldom touched upon the ladies' private lives.
The plot was, however, remarkably weak, with many elements wholly undefined and absolutely unnecessary, except that the scenes showcased more cool action sequences. For example, if a computer system requires a retinal scan and a handprint to get past the first door, why then do you still need to push two buttons to enter the second door, then avoid a booby-trapped floor? It's great to see Cameron Diaz get through these security devices, but if you think about it, what did the ""real"" computer guys do to legitimately access the machine?
Anyhoo, the movie's a great one to pop in and let your mind go on cruise control while you're entertained by some great action sequences and more than a few laughs.",1043452800,,1425,4.592156862745098

1399958,2,B000056PMV,"I have always been a fan of Charlie's Angels, and I absolutely adore Drew Barrymore, but this movie is horrible.  I don't know how else to put it.  The script is inane, the acting is not very good, the dialogue is forced, some of the special effects don't seem very special to me, and the overall effect is that of a destructive parody of a TV show I hold in high nostalgic regard.  This story would not have been acceptable for the dismal final season of the TV series.  There's one decent twist to it, but the overall objective of the bad guys and the plan they hatch to achieve that end is fantastically ludicrous.  I can't half blame the actors and actresses for speaking their lines without feeling, often mechanically switching emotions at the drop of an invisible dime, because most of what they had to say was just plain silly.  The acting seems to be so forced at times that it looks to me like these actresses are not enjoying what they are doing at all.  The Angels I know and love would not forget their entire mission every time one of them saw a cute guy, nor would they engage in phone conversations in the middle of intense action.  I also can't for the life of me figure out why they kept the character of Bosley in this film.  David Doyle must be turning over in his grave in reaction to Bill Murray's portrayal of Bosley as a totally inept, helpless, unbelievably silly character.  The Bosley of old was no Superman, but this Bosley can barely add two and two.  And the infamous ""Thin Man"" is like some Hollywood 1930s character actor reject whose mannerisms are so exaggerated that I expected him to break his own arm just trying to light a cigarette.  Worst of all, however, was the inclusion of Tom Greene at his most annoying for two scenes as ""the Chad.""
What about the special effects?  Even this part of the movie was ruined for me because the filmmakers tried to make all of the action look like what we saw in The Matrix.  Every good scene seems to be cursed with slow-motion visuals of impossible jumps, kicks, and other moves, followed up by the girls striking unnecessary martial arts poses.  There is one scene in particular, featuring Drew, that takes the special effects way too far without bothering to give us a clue as to how what happens actually happens.  I appreciate the hard work and training that Barrymore, Liu, and Diaz went through to prepare for their roles, but the whole thing came off as ridiculous in my eyes.  I have to mention the music here too.  I love the old vintage Angels theme, but in a couple of places I heard music that was obviously stolen from James Bond and, of all things, Godzilla.  Why?
I hate to be so tough on a movie I thought I would like, and I especially hate to criticize one of my favorite actresses in Drew Barrymore, but I have to be truthful here.  There are some explosions, which are nice, and that alone keeps me from giving this the dreaded one star, but I cannot possibly give it more than two stars, even taking into account all of the extras you get on the DVD.  To some degree, Charlie's Angels was a real breakthrough of sorts in the 1970s, showing that women can be just as smart and effective at catching bad guys as men; this movie betrays the empowering spirit of the original series, and I think that is rather a sad thing.",1036108800,6,3317,4.413793103448276

This face paced, special effects ridden, technically advanced design, free-spirited rock'n'roll adventure is filled with humor and energy that left me bouncing my seat. Directed by MTV music video director McG (short for Joseph McGinty Nichol) the film is magic potpourri of fun and adventure. McG is also in pre-production of Charlie's Angeles's 2 as this review goes into writing.
How could you go wrong with a cast like Drew, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu teamed up with Bill Murray as Bosley and the original voice of Charlie from the TV show - John Forsythe.

It looks to me as if Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu are actually living out their girlhood fantasies during scenes imitating such movies as Saturday Night Fever and The Matrix. Getting continually hit and kicked in the face and yet, coming away unscathed, coming within spitting distance of numerous explosions but remain unaffected by the concussive forces. Yep, this is a true Hollywood action movie - and not a Jean-Claude or an Arnie to be seen. It's all good clean fun with the tongue lodged firmly in the cheek.
An indication of the kind of audience that would truly enjoy this movie is to mention that my 6 year old daughter and 4 year old son were totally spellbound.

1399992,3,B000056PMV,"Charlie's Angels is an insubstantial and entertaining dose of girl power. Although it will probably never be included in a list of 'alltime great films' it is nevertheless an enjoyable escape into a world where beautiful women kick-box their way out of danger, and manage to foil the bad guy's plans; all without smudging their makeup.
Alex, Dylan and Natalie are an incredibly sexy crime-fighting trio, backed by an anonymous millionaire named Charlie. These Angels are the absolute epitome of cool. They can change from evening dress to street clothes in a matter of seconds, out-fight any number of evil henchmen, and disable a helicopter whilst hanging from the landing skids. And they manage to have a whole lot of laughs in the process; however if you're not a big fan of girlie giggles, this may start to grate after a while.
The movie begins with a high-speed action sequence involving an attempted airplane hijacking which the Angels seemingly effortlessly manage to foil - this montage is perhaps emblematic of the rest of the film. The 'teamwork' motif is heavily emphasised, with the camera frequently (and occasionally annoyingly) cutting between the Angels whenever they're not in the same place at the same time. Visually stunning Matrix-style action sequences are peppered throughout the fast-paced script and these are well worth watching, even if only to marvel at how efficiently the fabulous trio of Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz dispatch with the baddies whilst wearing designer clothing and high heels.
Charlie's Angels is not a movie that is likely to alter lives or provoke deep thought, but instead it can be enjoyed purely as fun escapism. And after all, isn't that what movies are supposed to be all about?",1022198400,,1745,5.041522491349481

Sam Rockwell (Galaxy Quest, The Green Mile) and Kelly Lynch make cool baddies as well. It's Cameron Diaz that steals the show, though, with her underwear dance, one word describes that part: ""WOW."" She has the funniest lines in the movie, she delivers them great too. She's just hilarious in this movie.
The only problem I had with the film was that it didn't need all the big names in small roles. Tom Green doesn't really fit in the movie as......CHAD, the guy who likes to say his own name. You got Matt LeBlanc as Lucy Liu's boyfriend too. Matt is basically just playing his part Joey from (Friends) and it doesn't really work. L.L Cool J has a small cameo in the beginning as the guy Drew is disguised as, which doesn't work that well either. Luke Wilson (Blue Streak, Home Fries) as Cameron Diaz's love interest is pretty funny though too bad the movie doesn't come through at actually putting those two together .
Some of the action is cartoonish but still a lot of fun at the time because none of the actors take what they're doing seriously. Charlie's Angels can best be described as True Lies with action like the Matrix.

1400010,2,B000056PMV,"What can I say about Charlie's Angels? Based on a TV series so old that much of the movie going audience was born after its run ended, the movie is intentionally mindless entertainment, eye candy for the overfed and under read. Its boxoffice success indicates that it achieved its objective, yet it comes to mind that even in the mindless entertainment category, there have been movies that were a lot better. Its director, Joseph McGinty Nichol, who made his mark in music videos, insisted that his screen credit read simply 'McG'. Perhaps that's a clue to the movie's frantic but soulless feel. It's so trendy. Trendy has everything to do with fashion and nothing to do with style. By its very nature, trendy doesn't last. I suspect that in twenty years Charlie's Angels will be laughed at as a relic of what was cool and hip at the beginning of the century. There! I've said quite a bit.
Since it's all about style, the movie hasn't much of a plot. The founder of a high tech company has been kidnapped, allegedly by the boss of another high tech outfit. Natalie, Dylan and Alex, who are the angels of the title, are called in to solve the case. They work for a detective agency run by a mysterious guy named Charlie, who is never seen, not even by the three women. They report to their boss Bosley [Bill Murray], who may or may not know Charlie. There are lots of explosions, gunfights and brawls, in which the trio gets thrown around a lot. Fear not, for the greatest damage is to their makeup.
What interests me the most about the film is that so many talented actors chose to be involved. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu play the angels, and Barrymore is also one of the producers. There must have been something they saw in the project, but whatever it was was surely lost during production. It tries to be satirical, but the satire falls flat. It wants to be hip, but even the lowliest TV sitcom is more hip than this. The action is predictable. Bill Murray, always a pleasure to watch, is wasted here because his comedy requires him to play off of something, and there's nothing there for him. It often looks like he is talking to himself. Finally, the computer generated special effects are plainly obvious. In good movies that use this technology these days, it's hard to tell what's real and what isn't. Charlie's Angels really isn't much of anything at all. If we could rate movies by caloric content, then this one would come up as empty calories.",1016236800,4,2472,4.557303370786517

The girls have Bosley (Bill Murray) for help, but also gets kidnapped later in the movie.

Each scene in the movie is like a chapter in a book. You will remember each scene- fighting in Chinatown, the race car scene, falling out of the window, Alex's ""ooh baraccuda"" scene, and many more.

1400013,3,B000056PMV,"One would think by reading the majority of the critical reviews, CHARLIE'S ANGELS is a great movie adaptation of the 1970s television show. Well, don't think that. CHARLIE'S ANGELS is NOT a great adaptation of the television show in which it was based. Yes, the movie has lots of jiggle and action and the plot is believable (though it's a rip off of MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE). However, the movie is totally uninspired.
Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore are the only people in the film who actually look like they enjoyed making the movie. Everyone else in the movie has this look of ""what have I gotten myself into"" on their faces, especially Lucy Liu and Bill Murray. Actually, Murray and Liu spend most of the movie scowling (suggesting that the rumors of bad blood between those two were true). I'm not surprised Murray does not wish to return as Bosley in the sequel.
As mentioned before, the film contains a great deal of action. Too much action to be precise. Kung Wu action sequences and bullet time work well in films like THE MATRIX where those movements are essential to the plot; CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON which is basically a mystical modern legend; and in SHREK because it's a cartoon. However, as cool as those action sequences are, they don't work in every action movie. Those sequences have been exploited and are being overused, often taking any sense of empathy away from otherwise good movies. Those Kung Wu moves were used so much in CHARLIE'S ANGELS that I started laughing every time the Angels were fighting.
I was young enough to watch the last few seasons of ""Charlie's Angels"" when it aired on television. Granted, the show didn't have the best writing in the world and is best known for its jiggle factor. However, the show never really was campy. CHARLIE'S ANGELS the movie is total camp, making fun of itself throughout the picture. That's so sad because the film could have been so good.

1400061,5,B000056PMV,"This excellent adaptation of the hit TV show is, quite simply, fantastic.  It's fast, furious and utterly ludicrous, but it's enormous fun.  The plot is based around voice recognition software so that the bad guy can find Charlie.  Of course, with such a amusingly blatant movie, who cares about plot?
The ex-pop video director cleverly hired a lot of good actors who are clearly having a whale of a time as they act out all of our fantasies - whether it's driving fast cars, sexy outfits or dancing on stage, it's all here.  Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore are arguably the best of the bunch as nerdy Natalie and sexy Dylan.
The fact that it is just so blatant ensures that the audience knows that it is intentionally that way, defying those critics who were desperate to crawl all over it and tell us how terrible it is.  We get to see slow-mo shots as the girls take off their swimming costumes, cheesy smiles at the camera whilst flicking their hair back and stunts obviously inspired by 'The Matrix'.
Basically, 'Charlies Angels' won't change your world but then it was never supposed to and that's precisely why it succeeds.

Well, the film blew me away: it's a terrific blend of action and humor, pulled off with great fun by an excellent ensemble cast.
John Forsythe returns from the original series as the voice of ""Charlie,"" the unseen head of a detective agency. His ""Angels"" are three gorgeous but lethal women who do the detective work. Along for the ride is Charlie's assistant, Bosley (Bill Murray).
Drew Barrymore (as tough chick Dylan), Lucy Liu (as cool, elegant Alex) and Cameron Diaz (as brainy but goofy Natalie) have great chemistry as the Angels. The plot involves computers and revenge. Throughout the film there are awesome stunts, cool high-tech gadgetry, hilarious comic bits, and multiple undercover disguises. Musical cues are cleverly woven into the film; much of the film has a James Bond-meets-MTV feel.
""Charlie's Angels"" is a tremendously fun piece of escapist entertainment, with a nice female-empowerment-and-bonding vibe.

After about thirty minutes of this, you will discover that they really can't act very well at all. Bosley, played by Bill Murray, was brought back as being more loose and unserious, but his performance still did seem to shadow the character from the original show. The actual plot was very similar to the ones from the program, which certainly helped the films cause. The voice of Charlie was no different than the original, and his face wasn't seen at all, thanks to the minds of the original show.

It said that women could look great, feel confident, and be strong, smart and assertive.  The Angels communicate a paradigm of female existence that is powerful, self-reliant, dependable and unafraid.  Contrast the King Fu fighting, computer re-programming, versatile Angels with earlier epitomes of womanhood: I would rather my daughter emulate an Angel than, say, Sandra Dee's Tammy, or even uncertain and faltering Mary Richards.  If there is such a thing as an enlightened post-feminist woman, think it looks something like one of the Angels.
On a simpler level, this is a flashy, fast and fun movie.  The martial arts sequences are choreographed by Master Cheung, Cheung Yan-Yeun, the Kung Fu choreographer from Hong Kong who was responsible for the levitating kicks of The Matrix.  As with that film, the principals trained full time for months and the hard work shows: the fight scenes are great.  (And, as with that film, cables hoist the performers into the air for a few stylish, gravity-defying manuevers).
The director, who calls himself ""McG"" (the first three letters of his middle name), is not as dumb as his name sounds.

I am tired of movies trying to be like The Matrix & Mission Impossible etc... The movie clearly did not try to bring anything new to the action scene.

The fighting scenes were just awful.  Maybe in a japanese cartoon they would be suitable.  This isn't even campy fun, it would be like attending a Wham reunion concert.

Obviously the TV series the movie was based on wasn't the height of cinematic perfection but was entertaining enough on a Saturday night to waste an hour. The movie spends too much time making fun of the series and not enough doing what at good movie should do which is tell a story. Some of the ""in"" jokes were fine but there were so many of them it was more of a distraction than funny. The action scenes tended to go over the top to the point where there wasn't even any hope of being believable. And while we are at it can we stop imitating ""The Matrix"" now? It's getting old.

The actresses do a good job as the Angels and Bill Murray as Bosley was a good choice. Tom Green as  Drew Barrymore's boyfriend was just plain annoying.

Rather, this piece of junk, and I'm being judicious, lacks all merit. It was not original. Not simply the title, concept or execution, but right down to the action and fight scenes. These scenes were a bad mixture of Mission Impossible meets Asian Martial Art films doing wire stunts.
This movie lacked any sense of theme or cohesion. One second, I'm in a disco with Cameron Diaz and next with Lucy Liu and her death muffins.

This ""Girl Power"" flick had Big, Sticking Bomb written All over it. There were rumours of on-set Squabbles, Over-Budgeting and Script Re-write after Script Re-write.

On the show, the angels ran around wearing skin tight skirts and pants with see-through blouses, without realizing how pretty they looked. In the movie, the angels use their looks and their brains to get where they want to go. It was not a great oscar-winning classic, that wasn't what it was meant for. It had a cartoonish feel to it, violence rarely caused blood shed, though with all of the brow-beating some of the bad guys were getting, you will flinch a few times.

A little heavy on the special effects (not as bas as The Matrix though), but that's part of the charm. Great video transfer on the DVD, which is good because the film makes great use of colors on the set. The sound will definitely give your system a work out, and the extras on the DVD are definitely worth checking out. The mini-documentary on McG is interesting, and Bill Murray makes sure it doesn't become too self-serving.

Diaz, Liu, and Barrymore are well cast and work together on the screen convincingly, so that it wouldn't be entirely surprising if they had a real life secret ops gig on the side.
The movie incorporates a good deal of ""Matrix-esque"" cinematography and borrows the kung fu style of the Matrix, as well as the ""secret and dangerous mission that requires lots of cool gadgets"" from the ""Mission Impossible"" movies. Here, however, the fighting and the cool gadgets are merely for effect to sell the movie, and don't lend anything new to the genre.

EXTRAS: Wow - there's actually quite a few. I'm the type of person that likes to rifle through every inch of a DVD as soon as I finish watching it.....and this release has it in spades. Numerous different behind-the-scenes clips (including one about the Angels' wardrobe.....any excuse to see Lucy in that Japanese masseuse outfit again *swoon*), actor bios, a feature about McG himself (this movie is his first professional departure from music videoes), TWO music videoes....it took me nearly another hour just to get through all that. Quite impressive.
FEATURE: Ahhh....the meat of the review. Well, McG said it best himself in his feature: ""This movie isn't trying to be Othello."" Not even close.....but I guess that's what I like best about it. The movie never takes itself too seriously, even taking the occassional dig at the original Charlie's Angels series - right down to the usage of the original make of speaker-phone that Charlie used to give the Angels their assignments. Of course, it doesn't skimp in other areas: the action is pretty intense too (martial arts aren't exactly Jackie Chan caliber, but Drew Barrymore gets a pretty cool scene), there's some decent laughs (I love when Lucy was trying to teach Cameron her patented Hair-Toss Thingy.....""just throw....the GODDAMN....hair"") and of course, the Angels themselves are certainly easy on the eyes - and are well aware of it, too.
All in all - a worthy purchase. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to watch Lucy's first hair-toss scene....just ONE more time....",989280000,2,1920,4.984423676012461
1400241,4,B000056PMV,"This movie is a contemporized parody of the 70s hit show - Charlies Angels.  Fortunately, the writers of this movie made no attempt to take themselves seriously and have interjected a fair amount of humour while remaining somewhat true to the overtly sexist original theme.
All three actresses (Diaz, Liu, Barrymore) put in good performances as characters with deliberately exaggerated personalities.  Each of three actress are able to carry off the ""Girl Power"" theme successfully without being insulting or condescending to women.  Casting Bill Murray as the understated, bumbling Boswell was also an excellent choice.
Scriptwise, the writers have managed to stretch a 30 minute episode into a two hour movie - nothing spectacular.  Instead of intricate plot, which would have been out of place, the writers rely on excellent special effects (very Matrix like) and well thought out photography and backgrounds to make the movie more interesting.
The DVD itself is not a bad buy, with several making of documentaries as well as the music videos.  For those of you that enjoy commentaries, this one is also quite good.

Maybe its the pale villian, who licks hair (YUCK!!!!), or the plot itself. Diaz, Liu, and Barrymore are the brought back trio from the 70's know as Charlie's Angels. Women crime fighters, with very strange methods. The Angels are given an ordinary case, but it all goes haywire, when their communicator between them and Charlie(Murray)is kidnapped. Charlie's Angels is a good one time see, but its comedy is exhausted after the first view.

It takes all of 2 minutes into this movie to figure out that it doesn't take itself too seriously.  In fact, it is a borderline spoof of the 70s series, even making fun of itself at times.  There are also some scenes which make fun of stuff from the 70s, such as Disco and Soul Train.
This movie is absurd, but it's a fun kind of absurd.  It does not try to convince otherwise.  Following in the footsteps of ""Xena:  Warrior Princess,"" this film is action packed, sexy and highly entertaining.  On the casting side, Drew Barrymore is a bit of a reach, but Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu are marvelous.

There were no redeeming  qualities anywhere in the movie and it makes me want to apologize to the new viewers who didn't grow up with the TV series.  Okay, I'm sorry. really, really, sorry.  There I said it.  These were not the Angels I grew up with, in character, theme, style, class or charm.  The plot line, if you can call it that, ughh, never mind.  Two thumbs down.  Minus the star rating.  Sad.  Sad.  Sad.  Bad.  Bad.  Bad.  My suggestion to make it just barely decent (spoof at worst) would have been to (what maybe I had expected) would be some cameo appearances by the original cast (like Lost in Space).  I would have enjoyed it for that sake alone.  Maybe had Farrah took over Bosely's place and made it perfectly clear that these were not the original Angel's.  I'm sorry again, it could have been a great movie since it was already based on a cult TV series and I was expecting to fall in love all over again, but alas it just turned into a plain ole' booty call.  Oh by the way, the soundtrack was good only in that it had great blasts from the past songs, and not because of anything remotely connected to the movie.  Not to mention I would have enjoyed listening to the TV theme song again which it didn't have.  Didn't want for that to slip by either.

1400266,4,B000056PMV,"I had about as much enthusiasm to seeing this movie when it came out as having a root canal.  So I stayed away from it like the plague.
But the reviews and word of mouth were good, so I made a point of ""checking this one out"" on DVD the other night.
To say I was happily surprised is an understatement.  If you're looking for mindless action, hilarious, unpretentious poking fun of the fashions and trends of the 1970s and 1980s, and a level of energy that leaves you breathless from scene to scene -- on top of watching a trio of babes vamping it up shamelessly with an obvious wink to some of us oldsters who remember the idiotic television series -- this film is definitely for you.
The success of this film has everything to do with being funny, sexist and not giving the audience a nanosecond to take the whole ride seriously.  No pseudo-intellectual pronouncements or babbling social messages here; no phony posturing as high concept art, the movie version of ""Charlie's Angels"" is more fun than the television series could ever be, loaded with wall to wall action and hilarious bits that can be seen repeatedly, not to mention a wonderfully diverse soundtrack that grabs all of the best bars of the greatest musical riffs from the 1970s through the 1990s.  Yes, even though the film is rooted in the 1970s and 1980s, the instrumental passages are pure contemporary Matrix stuff, adding immeasurably to the enjoyment factor.
If you're going to remake a joke, you might as well do it right.  And ""Charlie's Angels"" turns a potentially disastrous and dated series into something that is no more or less than great popcorn entertainment.
I love surprises and I don't mind being wrong when you go in with low expectations and come out finding ""value.""  This is ultimately, when you step back, a little trifle of a film with a big, big budget and production values that would have been worth the $8.50 admission had I not judged it unfairly, purely on pre-conceived notions based on its ad campaign, its jiggle-enhanced cast and a television series and premise I never liked even when it was popular.
If you have a degree in comparative literature, turn it around to face the wall.  This film has no other goal than to entertain and make you laugh.  And it does both very well.  Action comedies are hard to debate and are an underrated genre, even when done well.  They have never won Oscars, probably never will, but who really cares?",987465600,,2436,4.644186046511628

It may lose it's appeal a bit on video as the spectacle of the cinema has been taken away from it(except for those with widescreen TVs)but this depends on your perspective. The story doesn't make an awful lot of sense ,but the events that conspire around it are as brain restingly fun as they come. Out of the stunning trio of girls,all are stunning,but Cameron Diaz is easily the most alluring of all. Blonde,kinky and apparently able to do more than James Bond,she wins my FHM vote with this one. She is simply amazing. Bill Murray,a talented comic performer,does get a pretty low key performance here ,but though good,his method of comedy may be kind of dated to a younger audience ,so this isn't so bad. Barrymore is the sassiest of the lot,especially in a scene where she breaks free from a chair she is tied to. It's also nice to see Sam Rockwell again after his haunting performance in The Green Mile. The movie is also full of explosive action,which is the main name of the game,and it delivers above the required standard...I look forward to McG's next feature. Make it another action one.

Barrymore is uproarious, Liu is devilishy commanding, and Diaz is silly.

To start with, nearly every single thing done in the movie is ripped straight out of from some other movie, from Mission: Impossible to The Matrix. I understand that some ideas are good enough to be reused, but when the whole movie revolves around these, that's not a good sign.
Secondly, the combat scenes were horrible. Apparently whoever choreographed these scenes failed high school physics, as the trio seem to always be supported by wires. Maybe someone should have told him this wasn't a fantasy movie and therefore don't have a special force to keep them in the air for even half as long as they were there.
Finally, (and this is the really sad part) the best written and acted character was Alex's (Lucy Liu's) boyfriend. Yep, the one played by Matt LeBlanc. And I will admit that Tom Green's role of Chad was quite fun...in fact, it was quite possibly the most entertaining part of the movie.",986860800,3,1147,4.627450980392157

1400283,4,B000056PMV,"Action adventure has probably never been this much fun.  This comedy sendup of the 1970's TV series has a plot as flimsy as Cameron Diaz's outfits, but who cares!  It gives us inane comedy interwoven with serious action, making it wonderfully mindless entertainment.
From a technical standpoint, the film is first rate.  First time feature director Joseph McGinty Mitchell (McG) who has won numerous awards for music and commercial videos seems unfazed by this gargantuan project ($92 million budget).  Though the film is done in a hodgepodge of styles (a hallmark of video directors), each is extremely well done, using locations, color and sets imaginatively and effectively.  The pace, like McG himself, is like a frenetic roller coaster ride and the humor generally works.
Probably the most impressive elements of the film are the fighting scenes.  Diaz, Barrymore and Liu all trained tirelessly on the wire to produce fabulously athletic fighting scenes that look authentic.  The editing of these scenes is outstanding and when you see them, it seems that Cameron Diaz really can jump eight feet in the air, travel ten yards and kick her foe in the face three times!  There is an excellent behind-the-scenes feature on the DVD that shows how this was done.  This is only one of the many special features on this loaded DVD.  In addition, the DTS sound on the DVD is outstanding and explosive.
The acting; well there is not a lot of serious acting going on here.  It is all very tongue in cheek and all three angels handle their roles with an excellent combination of sarcastic humor and sexiness.  Bill Murray is great as the twenty-first century Bosley.  Kelly Lynch is also delectably evil as Vivian rendering some good fight scenes herself.
This film is a real crowd pleaser.  I rated it an 8/10.  It has terrific production values, great action, amusing humor and a killer cast.  With all this, who needs a story?",986774400,3,1922,4.885802469135802

I'd never been a fan ""Charlie's Angels"" when I was in high school (during the TV show's heyday), so when my partner suggested we rent the DVD, I was a bit leary. I tend to favor more serious, arty films. But I'll be honest: I had a ball watching this movie! Like many of the other reviewers, I was pleasantly surprised.

The rather stop-go flow of the movie makes since if one realizes the director is only known for directing music videos.  You can almost see where the non-existent commercials should go. Overall the movie is a mix between Mission Impossible, The Matrix, and Austin Powers. Even the director acknowledges this in the commentary. The commentary was okay, but didn't give any more information about the making of the movie than did the featurettes.  The featurettes could have been combined to make one documentary. The most interesting is the martial arts featurette, which features the same Chinese trainer that they used in The Matrix. The most boring featurette is the one about the director, which mostly consists of him being very enthusiastic. There are three deleted scenes included in this DVD. One were Curry and Murray are playing Marco Polo in a swimming pool, another where Diaz, Barrymore (dressed as men) and Curry are in the men's bathroom, and finally one love scene with Barrymore and the kidnap victim. Each doesn't do anything for the film, aren't interesting or funny and are rightfully cut. Two music videos are included. One original hip-hop song and video. The other a typical music video of a remake of the Charlie's Angel theme showing the band intercut with scenes from the movie. Overall the music videos are not that interesting. The most disappointing feature was the outtakes. These are the exact same outtakes seen in the end-credits without the credits. Why these count as an extra is beyond me. Finally standard filmographies are included which are short even by current standards. Overall the bonus features for this DVD are a bit disappointing.

Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, and Drew Barrymore show a lot of on-screen chemistry and fun in the title roles, while Bill Murray is his usual droll self as their aide, Bosley.

McG, in his first film, directs this flick with a sharp eye and a knack for keeping things at breakneck speed.

Its like watching ""The Matrix"" in overdrive - with the constant kung fu stop and go, speed up, stop, rewind action sequences.
My surprise was Drew Barrymore was the strongest of all personalities in this film including Bill Murray.  Lucy Liu was fair and Cameron Diaz was a weak Jill Munroe at best....Farrah could still pull it off today.
I miss the old angels Kate Jackson, Jaclyn Smith, Cheryl Ladd, Farrah Fawcett, and yes Shelley Hack too!....but not Tanya Roberts.
The problem here was I was rooting for the bad guys - case in point don't make your enemy prettier, sexier and curve better in a rubber suit than the stars.  Kelly Lynch was awesome and actually should of been one of the angels.  Her acting skills were better and she seemed to be more angel material.
As for the plot, same ole, same ole, they try to twist it around but you figure it out, and too much time is wasted with the angels and their boyfriends.
Drew note when casting: DON'T CAST YOUR OWN HUSBAND! Tom Greene played ""The Chad"", and was basically playing himself, and his facial expressions were not acting to say the least and came off like he wanted to do his work and quickly cash in his paycheck.
Crispin Glover who doesn't ever utter one word in the picture is great as the skinny, bizarre bad guy.
Other than that the soundtrack is great brings back good memories but the movie falls kind of flat.
I say just watch the original on TV land.",986169600,,1571,4.5017543859649125

This sense of dread came about because I was actually confused by a movie based on Charlie's Angels.  Characters were in places with no explanation, the bad guys suddenly had computer access and I had no clue when that happened.  The friends I had seen it with also had this disoriented experience, so we chalked it up to poor editing, saving my ego.  Sure enough, we were right.  The DVD includes about 15 straight minutes that were edited out of the movie.  These scenes are all good and really explained stuff that had happened, no idea why they were left on the cutting room floor.

Instead, I started smiling and laughing at the beginning, and ended up smiling all the way through. The word that most succinctly and accurately sums this film up is: FUN. It's not a movie you have to think a lot about (although there are a few twists and turns of the plot). It's not the kind of movie that will be known for its great writing. But it is an incredible amount of fun. The action is quick, the pacing keeps you engaged. The acting of the main stars was surprisingly good -- in particular, Cameron Diaz played the air-headed blonde role to the absolute hilt, and it came off very well. The sound-track was extremely entertaining -- I believe they must've played at least a little clip from every song ever made with the word ""angel"" figuring in it. In addition, the DVD has lots of extras in it, including 3 deleted scenes (they're very short, so don't expect anything monumental), and documentary-style clips on how they did the martial arts, the special effects, and wardrobe. And it also contains a short clip with some very funny bloopers.

The end result is a fast paced, high adrenaline, borrowed movie.  This film takes so much from others that it contains no real originality.  Where would it be without the Matrix, as many of the fight scenes are choreographed in the same manner, with gravity defying kicks and punches, but beacuse it is set in a realistic universe, it just comes off as stupid. It borrows twice from True Lies, with the Jamie Lee Curtis hang from the helicopter, and Arnold's description of how he is going to kill people while tied up in a chair.  Some countless other movies are stolen from.  It would be more enjoyable to the viewer to watch the movies that it stole from, but that could take awhile.",985651200,4,1049,4.632432432432433
1400334,5,B000056PMV,"My initial reaction to Charlie's Angels before seeing it was that this was going to be another over-budgeted flop. To my surprise, this is one of the most entertaining and fun films I have ever seen. It is not exactly the most thought-provoking of all movies, but it never claimed that it was. From the opening aeroplane scene to the conclusion on the beach, Charlie's Angels gives one hell of a rollercoaster ride, with visually captivating 'Matrix-style' action sequences and stunning costuming.
The cast were perfectly chosen, with Cameron Diaz (There's Something About Mary), Drew Barrymore (The Wedding Singer)and Lucy Liu (Ally McBeal) contributing their unique talents to form the elite trio. Bill Murray was pleasing as Bosley, however, I feel that he could have done more with the character of Bosley, if he was given more lines. The support cast also showed promise, including Sam Rockwell, Kelly Lynch, Crispin Glover and television's funny man Tom Green.
Not only is this an action feature, but rather a comedic showcase. Memorable moments include Cameron Diaz's dancing on 'Soul Train', Lucy Liu's dominatrix scene at 'Red Star', and Tom Green's character 'Chad'. Witty one-liners are concurrent throughout, that further contribute to the comedy element involved within the film.
One improvement however, would be the soundtrack department. I am unsure what to think, as it contained just about every music style possible. A more consistant style of soundtrack would have been more appropriate, like providing more tracks from atrists Fatboy Slim, Lunatic Calm (who were also featured on 'The Matrix' soundtrack, and The Prodigy.
Overall, a fast paced adventure, with plenty of hair flipping, martial arts, stunning costuming and endless comedy. Watch it if you're in the mood to just chill out, and not have to concentrate 100% on the film's plot (it's not that complex). Certainly a very impressive performance from Drew Barrymore as dual role co-producer and star, and first time feature film director MCG. Two Thumbs Up !!",985305600,,2039,5.219512195121951
1400335,3,B000056PMV,"Charlie's Angels is an exciting, entertaining film, if a bit stupid and unoriginal. But thanks to its willingness to make fun of itself, it manages to be a lot more endurable than it could've been otherwise. Overall, it's a very good action romp.
First of all, the whole film is a parody. Every time the film employs cheesy '70s-esque montage sequences, every time the camera goes wicked slow when the girls toss their hair, and every time an action scene comes up (which takes things from films like The Matrix, Mission: Impossible, and True Lies), it's all a parody. In that sense, this is a funny movie. It has great self-awareness, and doesn't mind shamelessly exploiting its three central stars (Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu) in every way possible. And Bill Murray, as always, is funny and goofy as Bosley.
However, the humor does get annoying sometimes. How many times do we have to see the same old girly-giggle jokes, like when Cameron Diaz is interrupted in a fight by a call from her boyfriend? Even if things like that are still meant as spoof, they aren't funny.
As for the story, I'll only mention it in passing, because it's not the focus of the film and it's quite bad anyway. The plot overall seems taken from a bad Bond film: secret agents get assigned top-secret mission vital to ensuring the safety of the world, and then the ""least likely"" person turns out to be the antagonist (or, as Barrymore's angel once exclaims, ""he's the bad guy!""). There are subplots involving the three angels falling in love, which seem pointless to the film and only provide some of the stupid girly humor I just mentioned above.
Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu are fine. As far as acting goes, there's nothing good, but as far as monopolizing on male fantasy, they're skillful. Too bad some people will only see this film for that reason alone, because it is those people that this film makes fun of the most. (Still, I suppose it's required of me to comment on which Angel is my favorite. Well, as far as I'm concerned, Drew Barrymore. There you go.)
I must mention a very pleasant surprise delight in this film: Crispin Glover, aka Mr. McFly from the Back to the Future series. He is simply awesome in this film. He doesn't speak a word, but he has a presence about him that electrifies the screen when he's on. It's partly comedic, and partly serious. The way he manages to look pathetic and threatening at the same time, how he brings a weird and quirky element to his character is great. He looks in command and at the same time paranoid of everything. He's my favorite performance in this film along with Murray.
The action is very good, obviously the best part of the film: zany flips, kicks, chases, and explosions all covered by the interesting, if ripped-off, cinematography. Of course, the martial arts scenes are the best. I have to say that it is a compliment both to this film and, even more so, the film it lifts this from (The Matrix) that the action here, even though meant as mere parody, still remains quite entertaining and visually intense. You can thank the source film for that. If you like the action here, and I don't see why you wouldn't, and if you haven't seen The Matrix, you should. You'll be blown away. But I digress.
In closing, the problem with films like Charlie's Angels (besides awful plot) is that, even though the action is fun, none of it is its own. The action can be good, but it can never be called great, simply because it's not original. It's the tragic flaw. But that doesn't prevent the film from being fun in and of itself.

Maybe that is what the screenwriters were trying to do, but that just isn't my taste.  The plot is completely ludricrous, and it supposedly took over 4 writers to come up with it, which is a little disturbing.  I did enjoy the fight sequences, they were done pretty well, although nothing on the level of CT, HD or the Matrix.  And since there is no explanation for their apparent superhuman abilities, the ""angels"" just look silly.  Cameron Diaz was the best part about the movie, as I expected she would be, she is a great actress, and almost elevates the movie singlehandedly here.  But alas, the other angels are not nearly as cool.  Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu are just not as charismatic as good old Cameron, so Diaz just ends up dominating the movie with her presence.  The one last good thing I will say about Charlies Angels is that Matt Leblanc's cameo is quite hilarious, that is the only time I legitimately laughed during the movie.

Yes, indeed it does, and exceeds those expectations. The story is one that could be seen on an episode of the classical show, but the special effects make this film great. There are numerous well choreographed fight sequences, and there are not too many cheesy phrases, as are common for action films.
The film features great actresses, and a couple of actors who turn in great performances. There is of course Drew, Lucy, and Cameron, but who could forget Sam Rockwell as the super villian or Crispin Glover as his henchman that does not have a single line. ""Big Bad"" Bill Murray is great as Bosley, not taking too much spotlight from the actresses, but stealing almost all of the scenes he is in. This film also boasts an impressive directorial debut by McG, someone who definately has a style all his own, even if that means borrowing slightly from the Matrix.

Clearly, the architects of this film intended it to be self-lampooning and the movie definitely comes off as cartoonish.  The ladies are able, capable, and without, really, the need for men in their lives.  They depend on themselves and each other.  And, like their television counterparts before them, they really have only one want, need, and desire: to meet their boss, Charlie Townsend, voiced now as in the past, by John Forsythe.
Forsythe as the unseen Townsend is the only connection to the past, other than that of producer Leonard Goldberg.  There are no allusions to the Angels of the past, or of the former Bosley.  Just as well.  Other than the formula of three women detectives working for an unseen boss, there really are no connections to the series.
Actually, the feel of the film seems to owe more to James Bond than to Charlie's Angels.  It opens on an airplane where an apparent bomber meets his apparent contact, Mr. Jones, played by LL Cool J.  Their interaction leads to a Bond-like opening sequence that establishes the Angels and their penchant for teamwork and danger.  An updated opening, akin to the series' ""once upon a time"" billboard, follows.
What follows is the meat, so to speak, of the film.  There's a computer industrialist (Sam Rockwell) who has been kidnapped by his nemesis, Roger Corwin (Tim Curry).  The industrialist's partner, Vivian Wood (Kelly Lynch), hires Townsend and the Angels to retrieve the industrialist and his software, which has been hijacked by his competitor.
There are few surprises in the film, authored by Ryan Rowe (The Love Bug), Ed Solomon (Men In Black), and John August (Titan A.E.), save for one or two and, if you think hard -- I did -- you can guess the direction of the film's plot.  There are some casting surprises, though, like the aforementioned appearance of LL Cool J.  Luke Wilson, Matt LeBlanc, and Tom Green lend their comic talents to the mix.  However, the plot line is so thin that you'd do best to just sit back and enjoy the endless action that unreels before you on the screen.
It's no coincidence that this movie is one hour, 38 minutes long.  With commercials, there's just enough of a film to fit a two-hour TV-movie time slot.  Which is probably where this movie belonged in the first place.",977529600,,2520,4.793981481481482
1400385,5,B000056PMV,"I can understand that there are people who don't like this movie because it has a simple and unoriginal story, but on the other hand is that not the most important thing in this genre. I mean, you don't go to ""Charlie's Angels"" for a good story and stuff, you just want to have a good time. And you will. That is, if you are not too old. I'm sorry, but I think that the more grown up people don't like this sort of fun.
But if you do, you'll be laughing a lot, and if not you'll see some amazing action. The acting is also no problem, because that is also not needed. They just have to be funny, and they are. Especialy Cameron Diaz is VERY funny! Drew is too, and even Lucy Liu is, in her own very dry way funny.
OK, it has not as much action as I expected, and a lot of the things in this movie are very cliche, but it's obvious that this is a sort of parody of all those action films.  And if you can't see that, you are definitely too old for this movie.",977097600,,958,3.9128205128205127

Now, let me get something straight here.. I hate most action films, I've never seen an episode of Charlie's Angels and I had no idea what the plot of this film was. So basically, I walked into the cinema with low hopes for this film. But to my surprise, this was no boring James Bond type action movie. This was a hilarious comedy film. The movie was hardly ever serious, and when it was (serious), they'd throw in a joke or two.
Go see this film! It Rules!

These did get a little old but they were interesting to watch.  Just like we could all watch Neo from the Matrix dodging bullets, we can now watch Cameron Diaz flying through the air kicking bad guys to death.  One of the most looked over things in this movie to me was Bill Murray.  His part is very small but every scene he was in you had to laugh.  It was also nice to see Tim Curry again, a very underated actor that hasn't been in much lately.  All in all, I was happy with this tribute to the original Charlie's Angels.

1400390,3,B000056PMV,"A theatrical remake of the famous TV series seen by many people. So from the beginning, expectations were high on the movie.
Frankly the story was a bit rush, and not that carefully plotted. However, with the Angels there, that should not be a serious problem. Audiences would enjoy watching them investigating case by disguising themselves and playing all those tricks during the process. There are also lots of actions that really push the actresses to their limits but audiences would be happy.
Drew Barrymore is wild in the movie, playing all the sex tricks on men, teasing them, beating them etc. However, there is a lack of depth in her character (in fact common problem for the other two Angels). However, the screening had made her forever look attractive in the movie, so her fans won't feel disappointed.
Cameron Diaz is cool and cute in the movie. She fought a good fight in the movie, demonstrating her strong side with a stern face but at the same time cute as she was in ""My Best Friend's Wedding"". A good choice for casting her. She fitted her role as Natalie very good.
Lucy Liu is pretty unsatisfactory. Not because of her acting but because she is far from being able to be known as pretty. Her first shot in the movie was horrible. Sometimes wonder why couldn't even the make up fix the roughness of her skin. Her acting and fighting were very good, but the limitations of her look make her unconvincing as an Angel.
On the whole, the movie is a good past time for the audiences because it is funny and full of actions, but definitely more could be done to improve the whole story and make it richer and more memorable. Don't miss out the NG shots after the movie ended - a pretty Jackie Chan thing but replaced by girls.",975283200,,1740,4.526984126984127

Though Bill Murray has little chance to use his comic gifts, mostly everything else about this high-octane caper is entertaining and self-consciously bigger-than-life.  The Angels are each given a human side, from the get-go -- this is a clever throughline, making these women memorable and distinct.  They seem to be having a ball together, and showing off some impressive, athletic kung-fu kicks, twsits and turns. There is an air of self-deprecation (Diaz dancing; Lucy cooking; Drew's boyfriend) that adds a sweet, funny undercurrent to the Matrix-like action sequences, which show plenty of skin and outfits.  The sexiness comes across a both a weapon and as a celebration.  The movie seems to bear the overall stamp of Drew Barrymore's professional persona: generous with its cast, fun-loving, empowered and distinctly feminine.

I enjoyed the leaping and flipping, but hated the slow-motion and freeze-frame effects.  Ditto, the relentlessly agressive soundtrack.  McG directs music videos, right?  The music was frequently successful at establishing just the right kind of loopy energy that fuels this film, but just as often it was intrusive and annoying.

I went into 'Charlie's Angels' wanting only to see a little Bond-esque action and, of course, Lucy Liu.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the first movie this year I'd like to see again.  Rather than a simple street-fightin' flick, 'Charlie's Angels' actually had an interesting plot, and a script that never takes itself too seriously, to the advantage of the viewer.  Just when you think it might get too campy, you realize it's just a fun movie to watch and relax.
The script, as I said, is nicely done, but would have been unmemorable had the cast not been as good as it was.  Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore, and Cameron Diaz play their parts casually with a just enough realism so you don't get bored.  And the supporting cast is nothing if not complimentary to the film.  This film would have been less had not Bill Murry and Tim Curry done their part.  And it's good to see Murry still hasn't lossed his touch.
I look forward to watching 'Charlie's Angels' again.  It was light-hearted and just plain fun to watch.  The direction, acting, and writing were certainly worthy.  Who says a movie needs anything more?",974160000,,1259,4.5265486725663715
1400397,4,B000056PMV,"As much a tribute to pop culture as a big-screen version of the '70s
series, 'Charlie's Angels' has so much energy and tongue-in-cheek
charm that it DARES you NOT to root for its three young stars! And
while the film won't erase the images of Farrah Fawcett in a thin
tanktop on a very cold day, there is a wholesome sexiness and
accessiblity in Barrymore, Diaz, and Liu that none of the various
teamings of TV 'Angels' ever achieved!
The pre-title sequence is
outrageous, and fabulous! ...
Each Angel has a unique
backstory...Natalie (Diaz) is an ditzy, upbeat 'Soul Train'-dancing
wannabe who 'shakes her booty' at home in Spider-Man undies, looks for
'Mr. Right', and is a crack driver; Alex (Liu) is a 'leg waxer'/extra
on an action movie set, who is a lousy cook, sleeps with the film's
star (Matt LeBlanc, in a funny cameo), and is an expert in technology
and martial arts; Dylan (Barrymore) is an ex-high school 'bad
girl'/free spirit involved with a seedy, insecure hippie living in a
tugboat (humorously portrayed by Tom Green, Barrymore's real-life
boyfriend), is a master of disguise, and leads the trio.
As in the
TV series, the Angels work out of the Townsend Detective Agency (still
located in the famous colonial brick building), and communicate with
the never-seen Charlie (voiced, as always, by John Forsythe) via the
telephone. As the trio's liason, Bosley, Bill Murray is simply
perfect, hilarious in his patented 'smarmy but lovable' persona!

The plot revolves around the kidnapping of a Bill Gates-type
computer genius (Sam Rockwell, 'The Green Mile'), and a technology
that can pinpoint any person's location, anywhere in the world. The
prime suspects are competitor Roger Corwin (Tim Curry, in a
delightfully wicked turn!), and his hitman, portrayed with kinky
relish by Crispin Glover. Hired by Kelly Lynch (who has a ball in the
role of Rockwell's partner!), the Angels embark on a case with all the
twists, betrayals, action, humor, and mayhem that a fan could ask for!

Loud, good-natured, and pulsating with a soundtrack of '70s-'80s
Top Ten songs, the film combines 'Matrix'-style freeze-frames and
slow-motion FX with a ton of Pop Culture references and a
swashbuckling sense of derring-do! The film literally rocks, and never
lets up!
Is this 'Great Cinema'? Certainly not! But in its sheer
audacity, and sense of fun, no recent film can match it! And while the
original series teased with a visual sex appeal that was was largely
ignored in the storylines, the big-screen version has a 'if you got
it, flaunt it' attitude that is both refreshing and empowering! This
is a 'Girl Power' movie, in the BEST sense of the word!
I HIGHLY
recommend it!",973814400,48,2678,4.93569844789357
1400398,3,B000056PMV,"In the history of the cinema, most feature films that are the progeny of a successful television series have been less than satisfying or able to capture the essence of the original.  There are exceptions, of course, and ""Charlie's Angels,"" directed by McG (Joseph McGinty Mitchell), and starring Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu, is one of them.  A great movie it is not, but it is fun, the trio of Angels are engaging, and it is non-stop action from beginning to end.  It starts with a dynamic skydiving stunt and never slows down.  Along the way a lot of things blow up, there's music,dancing, plenty of stunts, some clever lines and a bit of comedy relief from Bill Murray (Bosley).  There's just enough plot to keep things interesting, but it really doesn't make much difference; this is like a party to which everyone's been invited, and Angels Natalie (Diaz), Dylan (Barrymore) and Alex (Liu) are everything their T.V. counterparts ever hoped to be and more.  This is the way Charlie's team was meant to be.  What really puts this movie over, though, is the Angels themselves; there's a natural camaraderie between them that seems sincere and never forced, and they all seem to be having a great time, especially the charismatic Diaz, who could easily win an Oscar for Best Supporting Smile.  Barrymore looks good and exhibits plenty of spunk, as does Liu, who has a captivating screen presence as well.  It's all played pretty much straightforward, there's no attempt at parody or heavy drama, and nothing is taken too seriously, which enables the story to move along without getting bogged down with any unnecessary business.  Murray is used just enough to make his presence welcome and effective, and he makes his Bosley fit nicely alongside this latest incarnation of Angels.  The action sequences are well done and the choreography (by Cheung-Yan Yuen) is exciting; the influences of John Woo and ""The Matrix"" are obvious, and the less experienced McG was wise to draw from the best, for it adds to the success of his film.  There's something of the James Bond films in here, and ""Mission Impossible 2"" (of course), but to McG's credit, it mainly plays like an extended, more detailed version of the original series.  The supporting cast includes Tim Curry (Roger Corwin), the versatile Sam Rockwell (Knox), Kelly Lynch (Vivian Wood), Tom Green (Chad) and, in smaller but effective roles, Matt LeBlanc, Luke Wilson, and Crispin Glover.  The familiar voice of Charlie is once again supplied by the man who created the original, John Forsythe.  There's so much energy in this movie you get the feeling that the Angels must have always started their day's work with a triple from Starbucks; it's a high voltage romp that's upbeat and filled with fun and positive vibes.  In the end, ""Charlie's Angels"" is an entertaining, feel-good  movie that should satisfy a new, younger audience, as well as those with fond memories of the show that started it all a generation ago.",973641600,32,2987,4.883168316831683

In the first hour of movie quiet fun and full of action. Everything was quiet good for me and my husbund until we realized that in the part of Lucy and Cameron danced as a belly dancer. If you guys listen the music in that part, you will understand that the music that they dance is not a belly dancing music, it is the Islamic call ( the actual name is Ezan) for inviting the Muslim to five time praying to the mosque. I was shocked because this was an insulting scene of all muslims. The film producers were making fun with an important Islamic tradition. In other word, while the Muslims consider the Ezan as a religious thing, according to the film producers it is an enjoyment in the belly dance.
