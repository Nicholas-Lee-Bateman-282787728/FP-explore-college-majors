6787645,2,B00P69WYIQ,"A trippy Western that shifts from a wanted-man story to an Indian vision-quest style that doesn't really work out. Decent acting by most of the cast. This is a Jim Jarmusch movie, so weirdness is to be expected at the expense of everything else.",1460073600,,245,4.590909090909091
6787646,3,B00P69WYIQ,"Strange movie in the way Sin City was strange.  If your a  Johnny Depp fan, you'll like it. It's done in black & white. The movie is slow and cheaply done. The credits seem to indicate it's a German film, filmed in the U.S.  I'm glad I saw it on TV and didn't pay for it.  That's the first time I've seen mostly over-weight American Indians in a movie.
If you like electric guitar, you'll LOVE the sound track.  I haven't heard this much electric guitar distortion since San Francisco in the '60s. The credits show ""NEIL YOUNG Performs Courtesy of WARNER BROTHERS RECORDS"" and it sounds like his work and I found out it was when I went looking for the soundtrack.  I had missed his credit in the begining of the movie.  Now I'm gonna have to buy the soundtrack just to add it to my collection.  It'll be great background music for something but I'm not sure what.",1454889600,,863,4.316770186335404

6787650,4,B00P69WYIQ,This's a pretty strange but great movie. The soundtrack makes this movie all the more special. This to me is one of Depp's greatest performances and has had a huge impact on me and should be watched and greatly appreciated.,1446940800,4,223,4.6

6787652,5,B00P69WYIQ,"Talk about a unique movie that a lot of people haven't seen. Perfect to smoke too as well, very trippy. The blu-ray looks great but could sound better.",1424304000,4,151,4.428571428571429

8686470,5,B00P69WYIQ,Great movie arrived as should the only disappointment was no subtitles option,1502409600,2,77,5.5
8686471,1,B00P69WYIQ,"I love this Jarmusch movie. That's why I bought it. The Blu-Ray DVD itself gets poor marks.... there are no extras, not even chapter selections. When you insert the disc, there's a screen with the only one option - PLAY. While that was disappointing, the sound quality is why I'm giving it two stars. Abysmal.

Boo, Miramax.
Of course, I couldn't return it because I opened it!
Stay away.",1502323200,,693,5.871287128712871

8686473,5,B00P69WYIQ,"One of the best art films I have ever encountered. Black & white, perhaps two spoken sentences, a thought provoking concept, and a hotter than hell Johnny Depp. Need I say more?",1496448000,,177,4.5625
8686474,1,B00P69WYIQ,You suck. Product description did not say anything about US Or Europe.  Your actions in the US are considered criminal.. You have the return and my money.   rate. -10,1496448000,,166,4.655172413793103
8686475,5,B00P69WYIQ,"I've watched this film more times than any other single film. Great performances by an all-star cast. Mr. Depp gives one of his best performances. As he is one of the great actors of our age, that's saying a lot. It's a Jarmusch film, so the pacing is slow, but that allows the viewer to savor every second.",1478044800,2,307,4.310344827586207
8686476,5,B00P69WYIQ,One of Depp's best movies people have never seen.,1467244800,,49,4.555555555555555
