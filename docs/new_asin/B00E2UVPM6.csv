8600440,5,B00E2UVPM6,"Just delightful.  I have seen Samia Gamal do serious roles as well as comedic ones - A Glass and A Cigarette and Say Hello -but this is probably her best acting.  Her depiction of the mischievous genie had to be the inspiration for the old TV series.  Farid has a bunch of great songs - a favorite is ""Afdal Bahibbak"" - and is excellent in his role. The others - Lola Sidqi and Ismail Yassin and Abd-Es-Salaam El-Nablussy - round out a great cast.",1414195200,,447,4.2976190476190474
