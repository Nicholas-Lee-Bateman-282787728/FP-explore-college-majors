5751430,4,B00CXJR7AC,"A few comments on the film (the DVD isn't out as of this writing) for those who haven't heard of it, which may be many since it has kept a low profile over its 40 year existence. As I recall, the film was largely dismissed at the time of its release, and there were many negative reviews. Some of the criticisms, e.g. pretentious and wide-of-the-mark, were not entirely wrong, but, in retrospect, the film's virtues were dismissed as well. Paul Newman may seem miscast as an amoral drifter who, indifferent to the consequences, becomes a rising star at a right-wing (actually, proto-Fascist) radio station in New Orleans that not only reports the news with a hard slant, but works secretly to manufacture news that will inflame its listeners, but I thought he did an excellent job. Anthony Perkins is the somewhat unbalanced voice of conscience who can't get through to him and, in an odd choice, essentially plays Norman Bates. Newman has a relationship with another drifter, Joanne Woodward, which also highlights how callous he is about the suffering of others.
  The film is well-acted, and weaves about, often more restrained or eccentric than you expect. None-the-less, it is unsatisfying, possibly because we don't get enough of WUSA, either its news or Newman's on-air persona. Obviously, the draw of this film now is the degree to which it outlines the mechanics and popularity of right-wing radio (then relatively uncommon). But that's largely what's missing, although the station owner, played menacingly by Pat Hingle, gives Newman a blunt and frightening talk about his intentions, including a cryptic reference to what's coming next.
  Not a great film, and parts of it just don't work, I think, but well worth seeing. It was probably meant to be scary but came out a bit too disorganized. In the end, reality trumped it by orders of magnitude.",1295308800,30,1858,4.94551282051282
5751431,3,B00CXJR7AC,"While dated and not his greatest work, Paul Newman does what he can to save this movie. It has a good cast; but just comes across as dated and under done.",1377302400,,154,4.0
5751432,4,B00CXJR7AC,"Warning:  Spoilers, and not for the weak of heart or head.

""WUSA"" is kind of about this guy who works at a southern radio station with a ring-wing slant, and it drifts hazily through some sort of story winding around a corrupt preacher (Laurence Harvey) and a voice of conscience (Anthony Perkins, who might have been more believable in this role before ""Psycho"").  And it twists its way into a labyrinthine (and never quite explained) right-wing conspiracy to a kind of assassination at the end (though I won't tell you of whom).  And Paul Newman launches into an impromptu speech against Kennedy's war in Viet Nam, which he totally misconstrues because either he or his scriptwriter did not care to do any genuine research.  As they said in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE, ""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.""

If this review seems vague, it's because ""WUSA"" is vague.  Its characters wander around and appear to do things, but their motivations and actions are never clear (or even sensible).  One supposes, erroneously, that the various threads of plot will, as the Beatles said, ""Come Together"" in the end.  This may be because ""WUSA"" was cut by almost half its pre-release test length, and what hit the cutting room floor was character and plot development (if any) in favor of making sure they got good hits at all the left's favorite targets.

Make no bones about it, ""WUSA"" is really a manifesto of wacky notions from the political left.  It has no other purpose in life.  After a Democrat president got caught in -- according to what's posted on my wall at work -- severe sexual harassment (including nonconsensual groping and perhaps intercourse)-- his wife immediately said it was all a plot by a ""vast right wing conspiracy"";  and since she was afterwards appointed to high office on the strength of that, we shall use her words.  They apply to this movie (made, remember in 1970!  How many of you were even born then?)

""Vast right wing conspiracies"" started at least as far back as the sixties.  The left, wobbly on their axis to begin with, seized control of a Democrat Party that had always been home to ""progressives"" (the so-called ""party switch"" is another legend often printed;  their presidents, Wilson, Roosevelt, etc. were all proudly ""Progressive"" -- whatever the hell they meant by that -- as were failed candidates like William Jennings Bryan, the Al Gore of his day;  only JFK differed in being a supply-sider economically and pro-American in his views, and then he went and got himself killed).

Following several important assassinations in the 60s by darlings of the left (JFK by a committed Communist who emigrated to Russia until he found they don't take in trash;  RFK by an anti-Israel zealot;  MLK by an Illinois-born petty criminal who hated the USA and wanted to emigrate to Africa even before he tried to take it on the lam), the uber-left, now fully at the helm of the Democrat Party and with McGovern as their candidate, came totally unhinged.  And when McGovern lost, they went into total destruction mode, like the robot on LOST IN SPACE.

Since the Republican party was founded in the 1850s (by the sort of people who would be written off today as religious zealots because they wanted to, and did, end Democrat slavery) political violence in America has invariably emanated from the left, and from Democrats.  Yet since the 1960s the left has been living in a la-la land of ""right wing"" violence.  And to hunt down this mythical beast and prove it exists, they have made movies about it.  After all, if it's in a movie it must be true, right?  Print the legend.

The leftists making ""WUSA"" are not all in front of the camera (in fact, despite Paul Newman and his wife being strongly associated with the left, I tend to absolve actors from blame since they are only parrots paid to recite back words written by others).  Setting the scene in a southern town at a right-wing radio station lets the filmmakers cram in all their petty prejudices -- against southerns, Christians, people who like the USA (and the freedom it represents) and, of course, their constant bugaboo, talk radio.

We can note here that Rush Limbaugh did not start the American left's distaste for radio, the only medium upon which they were unable to get a chokehold.  ""WUSA"" came out in 1970, twenty-five years and more before Rush first sat behind the golden EIB microphone.  No, they had the horns and the tail all ready to paste on anybody for a quarter of a century.  Mister Limbaugh simply happened to step in to the crosshairs at the left's shooting arcade.

So what do we make of ""WUSA""?  Well, the makers set it in a place they hate among people they hate.  For their right-wing characters they set up cardboard cutouts painted with the left's own colors.

For all it tawdry pandering to its target audience, ""WUSA"" might still have been a decent conspiracy flick -- that is, for people who have the sort of mind-set that believes in REAL conspiracies and right-wing assassins and alien abductions and unicorns.  Unfortunately they got mired in the slime of hate for people of Otherness.  After producing a long movie (which must have been a lulu!) their simple-minded fearmongering trumped all that time-wasting story and character development, which may (or may not) have taken up its third hour.

Yet despite its age and the creakiness of its notions, the film has a very current feel.  It might have been made today, since the left has not mentally matured since at least 1970.  They still throw around the same canards and make the same despicable and unfounded allegations, they've just changed the names.  This is a movie every conservative and Republican should see, for a clue into how the other Party thinks.  But don't reward them by buying a copy. Just rent it and watch aghast.  Fortunately, it's far too flimsy to take umbrage at.

On the really plus side, Laurence Harvey makes the most of his juicy role as, -- what else? -- a hypocritical preacher.  Could there be any other kind in a modern movie?",1377129600,6,6056,4.744741873804971

5751435,2,B00CXJR7AC,"Even though WUSA is a downer, to say the least, one should be able to enjoy the DVD, right? Wrong! Even though the video is 2.35:1 and visually great, the audio leaves something to be desired. The audio is in 1 channel and one either gets drowned out by the music OR cannot hear the actors. The audio dialogue is at a very low volume and yet the music drowns out any dialogue. There is even a scene between Newman and Woodward where the dialogue is drowned out by a fountain. It might be tolerable IF there were subtitles...but there are NO subtitles! Paramount has leased several of its titles to Olive Films. That would be great if the quality stood up to Paramount's. But in this case, it doesn't. Olive did not do it right...in my opinion. This was a very disappointing experience.",1313280000,11,785,4.458333333333333
5751436,3,B00CXJR7AC,"WUSA is one of the late 60s/early 70s Hollywood's take on the new ""counter culture"".  It's neither one of the better nor one of the worst examples.  The story, of a radio station controlled by a wealthy elite promoting reactionary propaganda to stir up far-right hate, might have been more dramatic or even prophetic if handled better.  Newman performs well but he can't overcome the weak script.

What I wound up enjoying the most about the film was the extensive amount of on location footage filmed in New Orleans in 1969 and 1970. Mardi Gras parades, the old Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and lots of scenes of New Orleans of yesteryear.  (Of course the actors talk with the stereotyped accents that sound nothing like what is heard in New Orleans, as seems to be the case with almost all big studio treatments of the city before ""Treme"".)",1311724800,,842,4.700680272108843
5751437,4,B00CXJR7AC,"WUSA was Paul Newman's follow-up to the highly successful BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and was a complete 180 compared to that film. It was also one of his biggest flops and today it's easy to see why. The film was way ahead of its time not only in its portrayal of the nature of right wing radio but in it's use of unsympathetic, self-centered, and amoral characters led by Newman who emerge unscathed while the inherently good characters played by Joanne Woodward and Anthony Perkins suffer for their goodness. The script by Robert Stone of DOG SOLDIERS fame (made into the movie WHO'LL STOP THE RAIN? a few years later) brilliantly captures the apathy and the disillusionment of the country after the deaths of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy two years earlier. Unlike M*A*S*H which came out the same year, there is not an ounce of comedy in WUSA and that's what makes it so difficult to accept. It's cynical look at the effects of looking the other way was just too much for audiences in 1970. Today it looks like a prophetic period piece.

Paul Newman plays a drifter who winds up in New Orleans and gets a job at a right wing radio station appropriately called WUSA. He doesn't believe the stuff they preach, it's just a job to him, a way to keep him in drinking money. He takes up with down and out floozie Joanne Woodward and encounters Peace Corps dropout Anthony Perkins who doesn't realize that's he being used by the right wing powers that he despises. In addition to those three, WUSA has a strong supporting cast of capable players including Pat Hingle, Robert Quarry, Moses Gunn, and Laurence Harvey as a fake preacher. In later years Newman felt that the film failed from lack of studio support and because it wasn't political enough. He was half right. Paramount hated the movie and did little to promote WUSA but the film makes a powerful statement even if it's a downbeat one. It's much easier to appreciate the film today than when it came out 40 years ago. This is its first ever appearance on home video of any kind. Thanks to Olive Films for making it available since Paramount wouldn't release it on their own.",1306540800,19,2146,4.588541666666667
5751438,1,B00CXJR7AC,"Having never seen the film, I got the DVD with the expectation of a phophetic vision of the future, ala ""Network.""  But I was astonished and disappointed to discover that so many accomplished actors could appear in a film that failed so completely to draw me in.  Most of the characters are unsympathetic low-lifes which are developed insufficently for us to want to care about them.  The premise of right wing media exploiting the people, which I thought was going to be a major thematic element, is touched upon very lightly.  There are no scenes of on-air vitrol from station new-hire Paul Newman by which we might better learn the station bosses' objectives.  We are told that WUSA has a right wing agenda, but it seemed almost a subtle undercurrent while the plot experimented with other divergences, like photographs of New Orleans' poor and a fake government survey, none of which are explained sufficently to draw in this viewer.  Some of the dialog is so incoherent as to give the impression of being drug affected, which may intentional and befitting the time period of the film.",1298592000,5,1089,4.827956989247312
5751439,5,B00CXJR7AC,"40 years ago, Paul Newman made a most prophetic film about the future of talk radio and America. The film and its characters were so exactly on target, the public overlooked the film because it lacked the normal cheerleader mentality of our films. Newman and Woodward are up to their standard performances, meaning excellent. Joanne Woodward is one of the most talented and beautuful women ever in American films. Too few films allowed her to showcase her sexuality and beauty, WUSA and The Stripper were two exceptions. Newman is perfect as the cynical intellectual who knows he is telling lies but like all of America is doing what is necessary to survive. The last scene in the movie is especially forward looking, when he says ""Don't worry about me, I am a survivor. Ain't I lucky?"" For those of us who lived through the era of JFK and RFK we know how the films portrays a drop in our nation's expectations from Camelot to survival. It is the perfect political film.",1297296000,22,970,4.678362573099415

Woodward and Newman are an incredible acting teamas were Tracy and Hepburn and Bogie and Bacallbut they're also outstanding dramatic actors in their own right. This movie is dated, slow-moving and confusing at times, but enjoy this character study for the strong acting from all involvedbut particularly Woodward and Newman.",1519776000,,670,5.1
8587219,4,B00CXJR7AC,"This Newman film, once described as ""the most important of my career"" actually was a financial flop. Newman later conceded the reasons were an ambiguous ending and a lack of sufficient focus on the development of the two main characters:  Reinhardt (played by Newman) and Geraldine, played by Joanne Woordward. Never mind, the movie's real cogency has only grown with time as it accurately forecast the rise of right wing talk radio- which took off in the 1980s after the Fairness doctrine was demolished.

For me, the greatest appeal beyond that media prescience were the locality scenes of New Orleans, especially around the Mardi Gras of 1969. (Note one of the floats in the opening sequence with '1969' on its side. Of course, the film was made in '69 but released in 1970.)  The scenes were evocative of the city I lived in from 1966-69.  Indeed, the Mardi Gras of 1969 was the last one I  attended.  That New Orleans, of course, no longer exists - now replaced by too many emblems of superficial modernity. But their integral part of the film helps to contribute to its sense of realism and grittiness.

Many of the characters encountered by Reinhardt at the radio station also reminded me of similar ones I worked with at the Pan American Oil Company - then based on Lee Circle - before the company noved to Tulsa.  That obviously contributed to film's spot on realism for me.

I am convinced the movie's power will increase even more as time goes on, especially as we now know another powerful right wing broadcast network (Sinclair) is soon to darken the nation's oublic airwaves likely out-Foxing even FOX News.",1505692800,,1621,4.760714285714286
8587220,3,B00CXJR7AC,"Review of WUSA
Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

To me, the best part of this movie was the expression in Paul Newmans eyes every time he looked at his onscreen sweetie pie, real-life wife Joanne Woodward. Every time he looked at her, his eyes lit up like fireflies, even when they weren't supposed to. In WUSA, the seventh of ten films they starred in together, Paul plays a weary radio announcer who cares more about surviving than doing the right thing, and Joanne plays a hooker with a disfigured face. In other words: two lost souls find love.

The movie could have centered on that tagline, but the romance is actually a small part of the plot. Its a very upsetting, depressive film with the popular 1970s theme of people are mean, life is terrible. If you like movies like that, ie Network, The Parallax View, Three Days of the Condor, or even The Manchurian Candidate, this one will be right up your alley. I don't happen to like this genre, so I didn't end up liking it. Its a drama that shows the advantage people take whenever they can, even when it harms others. When someone tries to interfere for good, they get punished and pushed back down to their place. I won't spoil any plot points, but Ill just stress once again the heaviness of this movie. Dont watch it for the on (and off) screen couple. And for heavens sake, don't watch it for Laurence Harvey; whoever told him to grow a beard for this movie needs to get his head examined. Watch it if you're the type of person wholl root for Anthony Perkins, the innocent lackey who decides to stand up for justice. Watch it if you think the world is a rotten place and you want a film to agree with you.

It begins with scenes of the Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans. Later they show a rescue mission where a man preaches against drink. A woman looks for work as a waitress. The preacher tells about a rich man who owns a radio station. That woman is told to move on, she isn't allowed there. Reinhardt used to be a musician. The rain symbolizes the dreary tone of this movie. They buy groceries and go to a small apartment. A man takes photographs of people on the street. That couple jumps into a lake. [Good advice for this movie?] A man dresses as a woman to collect his sisters welfare checks. Mr. Rainey takes a survey. His sister sees men. Mr. Rainey asks Reinhardt about the plans of radio station WUSA. Whats happening?

The conversation is inane. [Will it put you to sleep too?] Mr. Rainey goes to a tavern and challenges the owner about the survey. Radio station WUSA preaches to its listeners. At night men go to see Mr. Rainey and question him. They advise him to go away. Later that preacher talks to a crowded stadium. There is a simulated duel for entertainment. But somebody shoots real bullets! The crowd disperses. Reinhardt speaks to the screaming people. Were OK. That woman is caught with a weed - 15 years is the penalty. She is put in jail. Reinhardt stays with a friend, then learns Geraldine is dead. Reinhardt walks in a cemetery. Then he gathers his belongings and leaves.

This must be one of the worst stories that Ive ever watched. It is a message movie that doesnt communicate. It does warn you against accepting everything you hear on the radio. This also applies to the stories printed in any newspaper.",1456099200,,1658,4.575757575757576
8587223,4,B00CXJR7AC,"Sometimes films give a slice of life at a certain period in history and don't age well like the black and white films from the 1950s that dealt with the Cold War and you could almost feel the frost then (and the menace behind that frost if it defrosted and somebody let the big one go off, the big one then as now be a nuclear weapon or weapons). Now the younger generation, hell, maybe even some of us of the older generation who have forgotten, wonder what all the fuss was about as they deal with the age of up front and on-going wars on terror. Other films like the one under review, Joanne Woodward and Paul Newmans WUSA while clearly of certain period, in this case the later 1960s, have subject matter that could be hot off the current presses (or whatever alternative social media people are tuned into for their information these days). The subject matter here (beyond the question of keeping ones head down when a struggle is brewing, an eternal and controversial theme) is the relationship between the media represented by the WUSA radio station of the story and various right-wing causes, conspiracies and plots.

Here is the way this one plays out. Rheinhardt, played by Paul Newman, is guy on the drift, just going along to get along, who winds up by the force of his personality getting a job as an announcer at WUSA in New Orleans. That personality, or an aspect of it allowed him to move up the corporate food change even though he disagreed with the right-wing drift of the politics and ownership of the radio station. Along the way, as drifters will do since they play the edges of society rather closely, he meets a heart of gold independent hooker who has been around the block a few times, Geraldine, played by Joanne Woodward, and they eventually get under the sheets before long and thereafter wind up playing house together. (As an aside the chemistry between Woodward and Newman here is palpable unlike some other films they played in together.) Part of playing house happened when they rent an apartment in a building which spoke of some 1960s counter-culture madness along the fringes of Bourbon Street but more importantly meet a fellow tenant, Rainey, played by Anthony Perkins who had finally gotten over his Psycho fixations, an idealistic guy who was working some social betterment program for the black community of New Orleans.

As Rainey finds out along the way, finds out the hard way, he is a small cog, even if unintentional on his part, of the owner of WUSA and of his plan to unleash some kind of race riot on the way to attempt to overthrow the government on the backs of the white rednecks and cranks who listen to the words put out by WUSA which is like music to their deeply resentful ears. Sound familiar. Through all of this, or almost all of this, Rheinhardt is going along, troubled a bit maybe, but keeping his head down to keep his job.

Then judgment day comes. The owner of WUSA and his pals stage a rally in order to rile up the brethren. Rainey who now is wise to the purposes he was used for decides to take matters in hand and tries to kill the owner during the rally. Pandemonium ensues. Then old head down Rheinhardt got religion, a little, decided to rock the boat and break from his keeping his head down world, although in the end he only loses his job and is on the bum again. But not everybody is a survivor. Geraldine is caught up in the melee of the rally holding some dope and is arrested and jailed. In jail, facing who knows what, this delicate world wary flower, commits suicide. Rheinhardt is saddened by the event but you know some guys are organically incapable of not keeping their heads down, at least for long, and he will go on somewhere else. That is an eternal problem. Yeah, this one is a slice of life one with a message for today.",1452124800,2,3812,4.505780346820809

There's some intriguing dialogue hidden in the middle, but the whole theme is entirely esoteric and vague.  Performances are quite good.  Paul Newman seems torn but does nothing at all to overcome the lethargic pull he's drawn to.  WUSA is radio station in the South where the drunk Newman gets a job.

The film is intentionally claustrophobic with counter-culture elements spread throughout.

The ending is rather ambivalent.  It's nice to see unique films like this one.
