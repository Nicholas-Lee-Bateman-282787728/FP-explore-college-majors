7027155,1,B00U0WY1QC,"This series has very little to go with other than decent art and an amazing ending theme song. The story is just terrible, none of the characters really stand out or are memorable, as well not being consistent scene to scene, and with the ending, it just leaves an aftertaste of regret. Even the original light novel author of the series despised the anime adaptation.",1433376000,2,368,4.676923076923077
7027156,2,B00U0WY1QC,"This is not the worst anime in history.  The up until the ending, the show limps along in roughly a C to C- range, (poorly) telling the story of a magical world parallel to our own and a trio of high school students who are swept up into it. With mediocrity in sight for its finish (we hardly see anything of the alleged magical world, plot developments which should be revealed onscreen are dealt with by infodump narrations), we instead reach one of the worst, non-ending trainwrecks of any anime I've seen.

Do not waste your money on this show. It fails at plot, writing world building and having any sort of ending.",1433289600,11,620,4.477876106194691
7027157,1,B00U0WY1QC,This anime just disappointed me. Had a good start but afterwords you can tell they tried to put to much into the episode to increase the pace. The final episode made no since at all just jump straight to the final fight scene. Then it all leaves off on a cliffhanger that will never be answered in anime form.,1430265600,10,309,4.254237288135593
7027158,1,B00U0WY1QC,"Should have read the reviews.  This is the ABSOLUTE WORST anime I have purchased in 10 years.  Even worse than Flame of Recca.  Iffy voice-acting coupled with a bad adaptation is bad enough, but add in the ""Non-Ending"" and you have an EPIC FAIL.  (Wish I could add the deep, reverberating voice to that).

Don't buy this garbage.  Hamtaro is a better choice.",1441238400,,358,4.603174603174603
7027159,4,B00U0WY1QC,"Look I admit the ending is pretty rushed and the a ton of plot holes. But since the copy I have was an early birthday present from the guys at Sentai Filmworks along with Is the Order a Rabbit? and No Game No Life since my Birthday is July 28, the same as the release date of No Game No Life. since I currently don't own a Blu-ray player I wound up watching this series on Hulu (I like the guys at Sentai's subtitles more than Crunchyroll's) (sorry subtitling crew at Crunchyroll). I believe the saving Graces of this show was the animation, character design, the voice acting, and the music. So in conclusion I find it to be a decent series all in all.",1440201600,,653,4.232
7027160,5,B00U0WY1QC,Son loved it,1439856000,,12,3.3333333333333335
7027161,4,B00U0WY1QC,I liked this but it's obvious that it is a first part. Several plot lines that need completing. I'd give it five stars after those are taken care of:). An interesting concept and good characters. They need a bit more development though. Lots of holes in their pasts. This may be on purpose and knowing these would give too much away but I'll reserve full approval until after I see more of where they are trying to go with the story.,1438387200,,433,4.3580246913580245
7027162,5,B00U0WY1QC,fast service. good series,1437436800,,25,5.5
7027163,1,B00U0WY1QC,"Judge for yourself, someone may like this,  but to me this thing doesn't have an ending... :( I hate anime that leave you on an ending like they just forgot to put the next episode on the disk.

 Why they dub anime that isn't complete like this and not others I'll never know,  overall save your money this is definitely a watch before you buy series.

BTW dub kinda sucks as well...",1436486400,5,383,4.263888888888889
7027164,2,B00U0WY1QC,"It was kind of fun while it lasted, but it just ended with a cliffhanger and half a dozen unresolved plot threads.  The Japanese seem to have a penchant for cranking out anime seasons based on currently running manga or light novel series without any plan for having a satisfactory ending to the anime.  Will the manga or novels eventually explain what happens?  Maybe, but the anime just stops in the middle.  A lot of American TV series tend to end seasons with cliffhangers and afterwards find out whether they're renewed or cancelled.  This is worse.  They knew going in that they weren't going to finish the story and had no plans to continue it.  Sets like these should come with a warning label - ""Incomplete story / Plot elements not resolved"".",1435536000,6,752,4.651515151515151
7027165,1,B00U0WY1QC,"I liked this anime, at first. After I finished watching it, I wished I never bothered. It feels rushed with no conclusion and I doubt we will see another season. I am not even sure a 2nd season with a conclusion would make up for this mess of an anime.",1435276800,,252,4.06
7027166,4,B00U0WY1QC,"I enjoyed this series very much. I would have given it 5 stars, however, it lacks a follow-up season. A lot of loose ends are left, as if this were intentional to imply a second season. There isn't one. If/when a second season comes out, then I would happily buy this one.",1434240000,,272,4.25
7027167,1,B00U0WY1QC,"I love anime and this train wreck I hardly would classify as one. It start off a little slow and starts to build up, but by the end the story is rushed. In a nutshell one of the worst endings in any anime or movie whatsoever. Save your money and get anything else but this train wreck.",1434067200,2,285,4.017543859649122
8703768,3,B00U0WY1QC,"Scary.  A sideways world where what you are and what you believe can be changed by a single spell, leading to some adversaries being forced to change sides repeatedly.  And a side effect of the spell is to forget everything prior to being 'recruited' - including your family and friends.  The anime is bright and colourful, with the artwork being excellent.",1518739200,,357,4.819672131147541

8703773,4,B00U0WY1QC,Many might not like it but the ending is just a little riddle and something to let you thinking about the story this is why it is a good anime the ending does make sense only if you really think deeply about it and try to figure things out but it is not a great anime but it was a good anime.,1451433600,,292,3.725806451612903

8703776,1,B00U0WY1QC,"OMG This is terrible. The story was a flatliner to begin with. It was already on life support just to warn folks. It was a mess and drags till the end. The characters were uninteresting and nothing blows the mind. The art was descent, but it ends there. This anime was a yawner and an absolute mess. Just skip this.",1444348800,,315,4.266666666666667
