7850428,4,6303541542,"Things and ideas are getting a bit strained in the last three episodes of the sixth season, and the first story in this video is evidence of that.  ""Emohawk-Polymorph II"" has the members of the RD crew crashing down on the GELF (Genetically Engineered Life Form) planet of the Kinatowawi, a hideous-looking ape-like race halfway between man and orangutang.  They need an oxygen-generation unit, which was damaged during the crash.  The Kinatowawi have one, and fortunately, don't skin the RD crew for bean bags like many other GELF races do, but the price is Lister marrying the chief's daughter.  They also encounter an Emohawk, which like the alien from the third story of Season 3, is a Polymorph, a creature that feeds off negative emotions.  As a result, the story isn't a ""Polymorph"" retread, but it's not as great as the original.  Rimmer's argument of the army with the shortest hair being the winner in battle bears is kind of amusing. More so is when the Cat insults Rimmer's haircut:  ""I have hair like yours, just not on my head.""  OUCH!
The notable guest star is British TV chef Ainsley Herriot as the GELF chief.  Herriot would later have the Seventh Season RD crew on a special edition of his cooking show, Can't Cook, Won't Cook, retitled Can't Smeg, Won't Smeg.  (Rating: 4 out of 5)
Rimmer finds himself on a G-class planetoid after fleeing the Simulant cruiser they shot down in ""Gunmen Of The Apocalypse.""  The pod he fled in was from a colonist seeding vessel, containing eco-accelerator rockets with which he creates ""Rimmerworld.""  However, as the planetoid is on the other side of a wormhole, it'll take Starbug 600 years to reach him.  This is another variation of the Psy-Moon in Season V's ""Terrorform"", i.e. a world in Rimmer's image, only this one isn't as good.  The formula, like that of the previous story, is kind of wearing a bit thin.  (Rating:  3.5 out of 5)
Weird things begin to happen in the final episode, ""Out Of Time"".  Not only is morale bad among the crew for losing Red Dwarf's vapour trail, but they pass through reality minefields, pockets of unreality that present false realities.  However, the story doesn't provide that many laughs, with a glimpse at their future selves falling somewhat flat.  But what a cliffhanger ending!  (Rating:  3.5 out of 5).
All in all, the last three stories are derivative, being a case of ""haven't we seen this before?""  Maybe the three year gap between this season and Season VII was for the best.  (Overall rating:  (4+3.5+3.5)/3 = 3.7, rounded up to 4).",1059696000,,2537,4.752860411899314
7850429,5,6303541542,"This is one of the funniest collections in the Red Dwarf canon, however, if you have never experienced Red Dwarf before I would recommend that you start with an earlier tape to break you in. Series 6 has a lot of running jokes and you could easily get lost and lose interest. And we don't want that. Although Im sure this series will have you in stitches because of its hilarious material I do believe experiencing earlier episodes first will lead to greater enjoyment.
The first episode is ""Polymorph II  Emohawk""  Fairly good, plus we get to experience Ace Rimmer and Dwayne Dibbly once more and who would want that. The other great thing about this episode is Listers marriage to a gelf (very amusing, Ahhaaakhhakahhaa).
The second episode is ""Rimmerworld""  One of my absolute all-time favorites because as usual Rimmer has to suffer. Rimmer finds that he is extremely stressed out and will die (again, as a hologram?) if he doesnt take it easy. What better cure for stress than more stress. Guaranteed to make you laugh and be completely grossed-out at the sight of a female Rimmer.
The final episode  ""Out of Time""  Ive never very much cared for. This is simply because it was such a cliff-hanger when it was first released. But now with the release of series 7 Ive made peace with those demons. Hope you enjoy. There are still a lot of very funny gags and series 7 is set-up with a nice change.",1049155200,,1400,4.584
7850430,3,6303541542,"Here's the second half of Red Dwarf VI. Not quite as good as the first half but still rather entertaining.
Polymorph 11 - Emohawk
This episode does admittedly have a few hit and miss gags, a plot which ressurrects characters for the sake of pant-wetting fan reaction, but is still ultimately entertaining. The Gelfs are a wonderful creation and the whole 'Lister marriage' thing is very funny. OK, so it is a recycled script (Polymorph)and very contrived in its bringing back of Duane Dibbley etc, but this is not a bad episode. One of the weakest of the series but has enough plus points to make it watchable. 2.5/4
Rimmerworld -
Another recycled script (Terrorform) and quite average when you compare it to classics like Gunmen Of The Apocalypse. It is, though, still funny and entertaining. Would have been better if we had saw more of Rimmerworld itself. This could have opened up a whole variety of opportunities, but as it is the chance is wasted. It just takes too long to get to the damn planet. However, still funny and watchable (As Red Dwarf NEARLY always is)3/4
Out Of Time -
This episode is obviously a budget saver, having only the four regulars in it. However this is no bad thing. It is very funny and has a wealth of fantastic moments (unreality bubbles etc). The best part of this episode, obviously is the cliffhanger. Fantastic television. Powerful drama (shock!)and comedy mixed. A great, great episode. What will happen to our heroes? 3.5/4",1006300800,,1462,4.75984251968504
7850431,4,6303541542,"Polymorph II, the first episode featured here, is the only reason I rate this tape four stars. The first half of the episode is hilarious. Lister  must marry a GELF, a really hideous hairy beast, in order to obtain a  necessary piece of machinery for Starbug. The introduction into GELF  culture is an important moment in Red Dwarf history, as the creatures  subsequently return in many other episodes.
The second half of  Polymorph is really disappointing. It's as if the writers ran out of steam  halfway through the script and had to resort to the inexplicable return of  several beloved characters (alter-egos of Rimmer and the Cat) in order to  finish the show. Ace Rimmer and Duane Dibbly were wonderful when they were  featured in the 4th and 5th series. Here, they are used as a cheap ploy to  gratify the audience.
The next episode features a timeless Red Dwarf  joke (the insipid nature of Rimmer's personality) in a brand new idea.  Rimmer must survive 600 years on an adandoned world. His solution - to  clone himself for company. The result is really funny.
Out of Time ends  the sixth season as well as sets up the beginning of the seventh in a To be  Continued cliffhanger. The crew encounter future versions of themselves,  and they don't really care for one another. Very noteworthy as Rimmer  displays heroics.
The sixth season is very apt at continuing the fine  viewing tradition of Red Dwarf. I would not recommend watching this tape as  an introduction to the series, but I would highly recommend it to anyone  interested in and even slightly familiar with Red Dwarf.",966988800,9,1589,4.750915750915751
7850432,5,6303541542,"I remember the first time I watched a Red Dwarf episode(parallel universe), and I've been hooked ever since.  I've been a connoisseur of British Comedy for quite a while now, but there is no series up to the  standards of Red Dwarf I-XI.  I'd suggest buying every single video.  Each  episode is as funny as the pope's hat is tall.  This particular series is  worth the money simply to see Rimmer actually show he has a backbone. (or  at least a little cartilage).",957312000,2,464,4.506024096385542
7850433,5,6303541542,"The Duke of Dork is back!  We also find out that Lister's taste in the opposite sex runs towards things furrier than his armpits (and her name sounds like a footballer clearing his nose, and ""Kochanski"" does  sound like somebody sneezing, doesn't it? Snide mode: hahahahaha!), as well  as the two sides of Arnold Judas Rimmer:  the heroic Ace and the cowardly,  sniveling git in ""Rimmerworld.""  A must buy, especially if you  have Byte 1 of Series 6.  Be sure to check out a rare piece of heroic  behavior by Rimmer in ""Out of Time.""  And he wasn't even in his  incarnation of Ace Rimmer.  Sympathy for the character?  Not smegging  likely.  And can you imagine a world composed of Arnold Rimmer clones?  Even the real Arnold Rimmer couldn't stand it.  Grind those (worry) balls  while watching!  And make sure you have plenty of vindaloo and lager.  Now  was Lister really created to rid the universe of chicken vindaloo?  How  about some pappadums with that?",947548800,,960,4.684848484848485
7850434,5,6303541542,"The boys from the Dwarf are at their very best in these three episodes. If you've never seen this series (6) then get it now, you won't be sorry! The comedy is hilarious, the characters are superbly well-developed, the  sillyness of this Brit comedy is unsurpassed.",944611200,,265,4.760869565217392
