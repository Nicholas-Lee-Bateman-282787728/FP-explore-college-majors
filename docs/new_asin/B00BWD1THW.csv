8574711,3,B00BWD1THW,"This is continuation of the first DVD set, bypassing the basics and focusing on painting ""difficult colors"".  Disc 1 covers black and red, disc 2 - white and yellow.  Material is well presented and explained, video is clear - I believe 54mm figures are used for all demonstrations.  Acrylic paints (Reaper) are used.

To be honest I did not enjoy it as much as Laszlo's first set.  Perhaps because it feels a little too long and slow paced.  Painting difficult colors is touched on in Haley/Foerster set from Dark Sword, and I thought the ideas were adequately explained there.  Here the subject gets more detailed treatment, different approaches to each color are not only explained but also demonstrated.  But in the end I still consider this a ""nice to have"" item for less experienced painters.",1369267200,,797,4.851851851851852
