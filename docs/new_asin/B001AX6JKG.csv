8280011,4,B001AX6JKG,"In preparing to teach a recent course on Rachmaninoff, the title of this DVD intrigued me.  This is a rather short DVD (24 min.) that would be especially catchy for the young audience, our hope for the future in classical music.  Presented in a humorous manner--with some overdramatization of certain aspects of Rachmaninoff's complex life--this is an engaging way to open the door for the novice in classical music.  Whereas Tony Palmer's film Harvest of Sorrow is an expansive documentary covering the entire life of Rachmaninoff, this film's purpose is to brdige the gap between popular culture and the world of classical music.  It whets the appetite for learning more about Rachmaninoff, one of the greatest genius' of the 20th century.  Jon Kimura Parker's playing is magnificent! Also interesting are the many interviews with important artists of our time.",1344988800,5,863,5.179856115107913
