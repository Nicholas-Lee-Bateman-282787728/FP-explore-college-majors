7842717,2,6303273203,"After the recent passing of her mother, Katherine (Mia Sara) decides to travel to Romania to find the father she never knew. Guided by dreams she is lead to Anthony Perkins with a Dracula accent. 35 minutes into the film, the ""V"" word is used and things are not hard to figure out from the plot spoiler title. Katherine plays ""Mrs. Columbo"" to locate her father who may or may not be dead.

IMDB lists it as a TV movie which accounts for the lame sound track and mediocre plot.

This movie about Romania is part of a multi-pack called ""15 American Horror.""

Parental Guide: No f-bombs. Brief sex and nudity.",1404777600,2,607,4.45045045045045

7842720,4,6303273203,"This was a made-for-TV movie which I was glad to find after all these years.  The Vampire as Hero formula isn't original, nor is the idea of a beautiful girl discovering she's the child of a vampire prince, making her something of a princess herself.  Neither is the idea of ""bad"" vampires as murdering maniacs with a leader who wants to marry said princess while killing off the father, so that he will be the new Prince of Darkness.
It may not be a particularly scary horror flick, and it has a lot of popular cliches, but it still managed to be enjoyable. Set during the dictatorship of Ceaucescu, there are also KGB agents to deal with while our young heroine searches Eastern Europe in search of her mysterious, long-lost father.
You may be pleasantly surprised if you watch it.",1234224000,5,783,4.585714285714285
7842721,3,6303273203,"It's not a quick, slick or even well-made horror movie. But it's well-cast, well-scored and well worth a small price if it should ever come out on dvd. This is a vampire movie devoid of all the pretentiousness and hit-me-over-the-head-with-your-vampire-sex-appeal monsters and is instead a Gothic story about a female stranger in a strange land who discovers that her Romanian roots includes vampires. And while someone in the makeup department had a little too much fun with the white foundation, the way the vamps get their fix (not through elongated fangs) makes them memorable. Other than the fact that the film has incredible atmosphere, I'm uncertain as to why ""Daughter of Darkness"" has such an alluring, low budget charm, but it does. Mia Sara does a good job playing the troubled American school teacher in search of her Romanian father, well-played by Anthony Perkins. Once you hear the opening music, you'll be hard-pressed to get it out of your head.",1174780800,4,962,5.01875
7842722,2,6303273203,"This is one of those made-4-TV movies that often show a lack of character...'Daughter of Darkness' is no exception. Anthony 'Norman Bates' Perkins makes the best of his role as the father/head vampire. The film starts well, but it becomes lethargic and a little silly. These vampires have no fangs, instead these weird spiky things emerge from their tongues (ala the armpit mutant thing from 'Rabid'.
Not a particularly memeorable film, which is a shame considering it comes from 'Re-Animator' director Stuart Gordon.",1026950400,3,517,5.240963855421687
7842723,3,6303273203,"Daughter of Darkness is a made for television vampire movie that tells the story of a young American woman named Cathy (Catherine) Thatcher who travels to Romania in search of the father she never knew after her mother  dies.  Upon Cathy's arrival in Romania she begins to investigate her  father's life, trying to find out as much as she can about him. Along the  way she meets and befriends Jack Devlin, a semi-important functionary  working for the US embassy, and an older man named Max, a taxicab driver.  Both men try to help Cathy in her search for info about her father.  Eventually, Cathy meets her father, and falls into the clutches of a secret  community of vampires, who have some definite ideas about the role she  should play in their society as the ""Daughter of Darkness.""
I  like this movie because Mia Sara plays the part of Cathy Thatcher  convincingly, the character Gregori is attractive and charming, and its  interesting to see how the members of the vampire coven relate to one  another.  Worth checking out.",953251200,13,1032,4.757062146892656
