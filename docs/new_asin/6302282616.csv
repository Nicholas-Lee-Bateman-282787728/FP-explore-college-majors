7823959,2,6302282616,"Some time ago,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-Warrior/dp/0790729342/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road Warrior</a>&nbsp;gave rise to a sub-genre of cinema that has appealed predominantly to filmmakers of reduced means and no real place to shoot: the post-apocalyptic desert action film. Defined by lackluster gunfights and martial arts, dreary cinematography, bring-it-yourself set designs and costumes, and an occasional grandiose backstory that's often better than anything in the film itself, these titles include the likes of Richard Norton's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raiders-of-the-Sun/dp/B000087F2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raiders of the Sun</a>, Albert Pyun's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knights/dp/6302914124/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knights</a>, and Dolph Lundgren's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Warrior/dp/B00005LPZX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Warrior</a>, but ""Dune Warriors"" - the early-90s offering of Filipino B-movie king Cirio Santiago - serves just as fine of an example of the genre as a whole, with the added bonus that it stars the late, great David Carradine.

The story: in New California, 2040 A.D., a small oasis town is terrorized by a legion of raiders led by a ruthless tyrant (Luke Askew,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Easy-Rider/dp/B000022TSY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Easy Rider</a>). A brave young woman (Jillian McWhirter,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dentist-2-Brace-Yourself/dp/1573625485/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dentist 2: Brace Yourself</a>) escapes to find help, which presents itself as a traveling swordsman (Carradine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B00005JMUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>) who recruits a handful of warriors to protect the village...and fulfill a personal vendetta on the pirate leader.

The good guys' team includes Rick Hill (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deathstalker/dp/B00005NOP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deathstalker</a>), a young Blake Boyd (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Kid/dp/B000089773/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Kid</a>), and Filipino stars Dante Varona and Maria ""I was starting to feel crusty"" Lopez...none of whom have the talent or presence of Carradine. The acting as a whole falls on its face: most of the supporting cast would be fit for a high school production for their complete lack of subtlety, and even David Carradine sells explosions going on right behind him as though he were listening to the radio. This is further offset by questionable editing evident when characters' dialogue is abruptly cut off by changing shots and obvious splicing during action scenes. Speaking of action scenes, it might have been a good idea if Santiago had stuck entirely to shootouts and let the martial arts be: everybody who throws a kick looks woefully off-balance with legs wavering in midair.

With that being said, ""Dune Warriors"" does have soon neat/weird parts to it: when Jillian McWhirter goes out for help, she's promptly chased by a tribe of aboriginal midgets (who are promptly chased away by Carradine, the big scary dude) and later taken to a sort of hero's haven where men in football pads joust on motorcycles. Later still, a hand-to-hand fight breaks out and uplifting orchestral music plays, as though there's something significant about the beating. Oh, and almost everybody in the film uses a sword; nobody's particularly good with 'em, and the final blade-to-blade showdown between Carradine and Luke Askew is a joke, but it's a nifty little touch nonetheless to see everybody toting a blade.

I'm tempted to give this film three stars for the amount of heart it has going on...but then I think of how the barricade constructed by the villagers looks like cardboard, how the absurd knife fight was lifted from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beat-It/dp/B000CNET5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beat It</a>&nbsp;music video, and how completely ungrounded the Rick/Maria sex scene was, and I remember why most movies like this never saw the inside of a theater. It's not the worst of its kind by a long shot and can, in a pinch, be fun if you've got enough beer and a like-minded buddy around, but sober minds will be hard-pressed to consider this a must-have, including Carradine fans.",1257033600,6,4703,7.0479452054794525

Another Seven Samauri remake, basically.  Yeah, their budget was about $4 and there's some pretty scary acting in it, but overall it's actually a lot of fun.",1119484800,6,307,4.333333333333333
7823962,2,6302282616,"David Carradine straps on his ""Warrior and Sorceress"" robe yet again in this derivative post-apocalyptic action thriller. The plot is the same-old isolated community in the desert seeking rootless warriors to  defend them against ruthless bandits who are after their water. The  post-apocalyptic culture in this movie is acceptably well done for this  genre, and the obligatory scenes in which the warriors de-glamorize  themselves around the campfire are handled with the appropriate solemnity.  The battle scenes have some thrills to them, but some technical weaknesses  and continuity flaws hold it back. The wrap-around box illustration and  title grapics are obviously meant to evoke ""Dune,"" the David  Lynch movie based on the Frank Herbert novel, but there is no relation at  all (though it is a nice box).
The more interesting things this film  offers to this genre include a motorcycle joust, a town with a happening  nightlife, politics within the beleagured community, Carradine's sword  fighting, and a mysterious back story regarding Carradine and the leader of  the bad guys.
David Carradine's performance and the other adequacies in  the movie keep it from being a total bomb, but folks who are not  completists in the genre could probably find better ways to spend their  time.
Trivia: the costume and sword David Carradin wears was first seen  in ""The Warrior and the Sorceress"" and later in ""Wizards of  the Lost Kingdom II.""",947203200,49,1443,5.2
