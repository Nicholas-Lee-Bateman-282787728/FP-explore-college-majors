346839,5,630170780X,"Growing up in the 60's Walt Disney was a staple, and the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh my all time favorite. I even bought the 45 record and about drove my parents nuts by playing it so much. This film displayed Disney talent at its best working on many levels from historical to pure entertainment. Luckily I taped the show several years ago, but have about worn the tape out. I would give almost anything to have this 3 part series on DVD.",1021334400,11,437,4.341463414634147
346840,5,630170780X,"From watching this film years ago, I would highly recommend
this movie, starring Patrick McGoohan (aka - ""Secret Agent Man""), who is simply ""fantastic"" in his role as the respect-
ful Vicar, (alias the ""Scarecrow"").  Its films like this, that
always kept Disney ""on top"" and I'm sure most people would like
to see more of films like this one on television, instead of the
usual programs that we see. I definitely would highly recommend
purchasing this movie for any video collection!",1005868800,15,483,4.890243902439025
346841,5,630170780X,"Having originally seen this film in the cinema in 1963 and having since owned at least two copies on VHS tape, long since worn out, I now want it on DVD.
Patrick McGoohan (Danger Man, The Prisoner) makes a great Doctor Syn and George Cole (St. Trinians, Minder) a suitably roguish sexton.
The story is presented at a good pace and the atmosphere is nicely creepy in the right places. The scarecrow's cackling laugh chills those who cross him.
To date, Danger Man, The Prisoner and Minder have all been released on DVD. How about Dr. Syn and St. Trinians?",1005264000,13,554,4.55
346842,5,630170780X,"Truly outstanding Walt Disney production. Entertaining, exciting, excellent acting, and beautiful haunting, scenery. Also, the musical score is very appealing. Walt Disney at his best! Would recommend for anyone.",1004227200,10,212,6.344827586206897
346873,5,630170780X,"Having searched for this Disney series for YEARS, I was delighted to find it--and get it promptly and in perfect condition.",1300579200,2,123,4.904761904761905
346874,4,630170780X,"A largely forgotten but excellent Disney adaptation of Russel Thorndike's historical stories of Dr Syn, by day a quiet and God-fearing local vicar; but by night the leader of a gang of smugglers known as Night Riders of Romney Marsh. Great family entertainment with Patrick McGoohan (Danger Man, The Prisoner)as Dr Syn: Alias the Scarecrow.",1279065600,,340,5.2
346875,5,630170780X,This is one of my favorite Disney offerings when I was growing up. I've looked of it for sooo long. Please release this on dvd. We are standing in line with money in hand.,1212278400,2,171,4.0588235294117645
346876,5,630170780X,"For heaven's sake, RE-RELEASE...this...movie!!Please!!!!!!!!The best part of my childhood was the TV show and seeing this got me to get the Scholastic paperback by Vic Crume. It's held up great for being almost 30+ years old and reread constantly. However, I am grateful for Dr. Syn to opening my eyes up to the super-coolness of Patrick McGoohan.

So, please, RE-RELEASE DR. SYN!!!! Thank you : )",1193529600,4,397,5.015151515151516
346877,5,630170780X,"I have thought of this movie so many times and wondered, why on earth  hasn't it come out on DVD yet? - it was certainly one of the best Disney films and I think, one of the best films of its genre.  I was around 5 yrs old when I first heard the song on a Disney album my dad got us.  It scared us silly, but we wanted to hear it again, and again.  It was that piercing laugh and the wonderful guitars.  When I finally got to see the movie several years later, it didn't disappoint. I've been hoping to see it again ever since.  So nice to know there's a huge fan club out there.",1183248000,7,579,3.864406779661017
346878,5,630170780X,"Like so many here, I remember watching this on Wonderful World of disney as a kid and have never forgotten it - I LOVED it!  And that laugh....!  I like to see if any of the Dr Syn alias the Scarecrow vhs come out on ebay and right now they have several Patrick McGoohan signed posters for sale.  But the best part is, the theme song is attached.  So when you open up that particular item for sale, wait a few seconds and the theme song will start.  the laugh is all that I remembered it to be. I loved Patrick in this - this is my absolute favorite show.  with all these requests for Disney to release it, I can't fathom why they don't.  Please, please, please release it. Such an awesome show!",1178841600,11,695,4.141791044776119
346879,5,630170780X,"I had been trying to find this movie forever but I forget the title had Dr. Syn in it, but once I found it it was all that I remembered it to be with the exception of the film quality.  The copy I found was, I thought, poor quality with distortions and so I was disappointed. I want my own copy and hope that Disney would remaster this movie into a DVD and clean up the distortions, etc.  However, the movie is what movies should be, exciting, well done, and good for the entire family. This is a classic film.  You will love the Scarecrow's laugh. You just got to see it. By the way, the books on Dr. Syn are good reading.  Classic.",1174780800,10,633,4.080645161290323
346880,5,630170780X,"There was this one esposide where Scarecrow saves a son of a prominent family from the English and the son flees to America.  The father made a toast with Dr. Syn about the son's escape at the same time made a negative comment about the Scarecrow and poor Dr. Syn had to put up with it. However, in the song, the county folks love him just the same.  Scarecrow is like Zorro and Robin Hood in righting the wrongs inflicted on the poor people by the authorities. I love the series especially when the song is sang and Scarecrow at the end of the song, does his wicked laugh.",1163289600,4,573,4.247706422018348
346881,5,630170780X,"Well, I never dreamed there were so many of us out there, and all with the same thought. I tuned in on this movie assuming (and we all know what happens when you assume) that intelligent folks like the Disney people would have put this out on DVD ages ago. I should have known better - I have a government job, I should be used to foolishness...This movie affected me like few others in my childhood and fostered a rabid interest in history and all things British. I still remember how Dr Syn got a copy of the cell door key that he used to free the wrongly-incarcerated young man (whose importance, sadly, is lost to me); if I ever need that information, it's right there in my head. The masks were great; I loved the big gray horse (hey, I  was a kid!);and we were so wrapped up in the story, we even got my grumpy dad involved in it. It was released as an extra in my area in the 70s I believe - I remember being thrilled to enjoy it all over again and saw it then a bunch of times. I hope Disney really does release it as a DVD soon (along with The Swamp Fox, The Fighting Prince Of Donegal,and The Prince and the Pauper) so a whole new generation of kids can be inspired and enlightened.",1153094400,6,1192,4.137931034482759
346882,5,630170780X,"Around every Halloween time, The Wonderful World of Disney aired this Colonial-era masterpiece over three long weeks, keeping us in suspense as to how it would all turn out.  This movie had everything:  adventure, scary costumes(those masks seriously freaked us out when we were little), misty moors, and brave villagers crushed under burdensome taxes struggling against the big bad redcoats.  It was Robin Hood clearly influenced by Zorro!  The lead character---mild-mannered vicar Dr. Christopher Syn by day and the fearsome Scarecrow of Romney Marsh by night---is wonderfully portrayed by the great actor Patrick MacGoohan.  The rest of the cast was solid, too, as was the historical detailing, and the costumes and scenery were nicely done.  The overall theme of the corrupt being exposed and brought to justice was well-handled and lacking in unnecessary melodrama; right prevailed over evil, as it usually did in a Disney film, but this one was more balanced and better produced than many others.  Please, Disney, PLEASE release this one on DVD so our children can enjoy it, too!  The world---or at least us rabid fans of The Scarecrow---will be eternally grateful.",1132444800,20,1171,5.258064516129032
346903,5,630170780X,"I was just graduating from High School at the time this three part classic appeared, and I am still impressed by the story to this day. Night Creatures  was my all time favorite, with Peter Cushing, but Patrick McGoohan fits the bill of Dr. Syn with great creativity. Like Robin Hood, this series has the viewer on the edge of his seat, wondering what is going to happen next. True to the character, Dr. Syn impresses on me that Good always triumphs over the oppressor, and in the end, the evil is exposed and put in its place. Their is no violent treatment of the bad guy, only justice comes out on top. It is so refreshing to see this, especially in the times we are living in. Please release this series in DVD  asap.............We need programs like this, it a wonderful movie for young and old. I am patiently waiting Disney Producers........Thanks S.B.",1116806400,4,858,4.564935064935065
346904,5,630170780X,I remember watching this great movie as a child on the Wonderful World of Disney.  I would like to now share this with my grandkids.  I hope that Disney gets on the ball and releases this on DVD soon!,1116028800,4,200,4.102564102564102
346905,5,630170780X,"There were so many great family movies in the sixties. Along with those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang & The Scarecrow Of Romney Marsh these are my favourites. All are on dvd except Scarecrow,What a pity Disney dosen't feel the need to release a dvd version of Scarecrow i'm sure it would be a big seller. If they are thinking of remaking it that would be a mistake for no one could portray the Scarecrow like Patrick Mcgoohan it's his portrayal along with the overall entertainment of the movie that still enthralls us some 40 years later despite limited viewing. Disney,please do us all a favour and release The Scarecrow on DVD soon. A remake wouldn't do.",1115164800,5,692,4.7272727272727275
346906,5,630170780X,"Disney may have just distributed it in the U.S.  I'm not sure, but may have been filmed and produced by a British Company.  Regardless, we need Disney to unleash this... it was a big part of MY childhood too!!!",1111622400,4,210,4.358974358974359

346908,3,630170780X,"I was a teenager when i saw the scarecrow of romney marsh on the Wonderful world of Disney, and about 30 years later i was able to
rent the movie from a video store.  The movie was then called Dr. Syn Alias the Scarecrow.  Needless to say over the years, the
tape wore out, and i would pay any amount to have the movie in
DVD.  Patrick Mcgooan the actor who plays the scarecrow in the movie portrays him brilliantly. The movie is in my opinion a true classic, and should be rereleased in DVD. Hope it comes out
soon, hopefully by the end of 2002.",1038009600,29,546,4.132075471698113

Disney should get off their behinds and release it on DVD so that the younger generation can watch a high quality film as we did without having to worry about "" explicit adult content "" like so many films contain today. If today's kids can watch this kind of film and be influenced by it, they might not grow up to be the GOD-hating people that we have so many of already. I can promise you that I will not buy another Disney movie untill this one is released!! DISNEY, RELAESE THIS FILM ON DVD NOW !!",1029542400,13,750,4.108843537414966

7814169,4,630170780X,"All of the DISNEY-issued VHSs seem to be flawed.

They run just over the T-160 capability. so, they trim off the opening credits, and in mid episode, or halfway in between.

The story is oddly edited,and cobbled together from the episodic release intended.

That being said, I LOVE THE SHOW. Patrick McGoohan is great as the title character, and the Disney production it just swell, too.

The VHS is a great alternative to the TIN BOX DVD edition, as it is usually 1/8th of the price!

The British [Plastic] DVD edition if an even greater value, due to the capability to include the Walt Disney introductions, and entire episodes.
[If you just want to WATCH IT, THE BRITISH EDITION is your best choice.]

The VHS is collectible, so it command a higher price than normal VHS releases. The TIN BOX DVD editon is Highly Collectible, and commands a very-high price tag.",1489795200,,865,4.695364238410596

7814177,5,630170780X,"We have looked for this story many years. I gave it to my husband for Christmas. It delighted us as it had done when we first saw it as children on Walt Disney's weekly program. Patrick McGoohan is delightful as the Scarecrow. When he dons the costume of the Scarecrow, shedding his daily role as Vicar of a seacoast parrish, he seems to let go all his inner penchant for play-acting. He growls his words, his cackling laugh is chilling, his ruthless decrees seem brutal. Yet he always has as his goal  helping the oppressed people of brutal King George III by selling smuggled goods to pay their taxes for them. This might be a little too dark for children under 8 but I think children older will appreciate the themes of justice, fairness, and rebelliousness with cause that run through the story. It is beautifully filmed but there is a problem with lighting as so much of the action takes place at night. Still, McGoohan's Scarecrow is a character you won't soon forget.",1357948800,2,974,4.597701149425287
