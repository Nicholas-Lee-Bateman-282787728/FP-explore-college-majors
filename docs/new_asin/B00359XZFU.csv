8603356,5,B00359XZFU,This is an incredible DVD.  We have used it with our preschool kid's church and our preschool children during the week.  The kids love the animation and songs.  Biblical Truths and scripture are presented in a way that preschoolers can understand.  Highly recommend!!  I just wish DVD 2 would hurry up and be released!,1406246400,,318,4.814814814814815
