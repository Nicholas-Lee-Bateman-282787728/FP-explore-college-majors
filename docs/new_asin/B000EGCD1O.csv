Of course, in this dramatization, the full circle of birth mother to foster mother to adoptive mother to becoming a mother was brilliantly written, superbly acted and a moving experience for the viewer.

The final lesson would be that no matter what the circumstance, no matter the race, no matter the lost time, a resolution can always be reached to a satisfactory conclusion. A beautiful story, beautifully told.",1228521600,4,693,4.864406779661017
2517499,5,B000EGCD1O,I watched this movie yesterday and could not stop crying!!! It was so moving on so many different levels!! Anne Bancroft and Lynn Whitfield are extraordinary as well as Gloria Rueben and Jesse L. Martin!!! I am buying this movie for my collection. What a positive movie that did not placate the roles and effects of what adoption and sometine interracial placements can have on young lives. I was so touched and cannot encourage this movie to be bought.,1205107200,11,453,4.746835443037975
2517500,5,B000EGCD1O,"There are a number of very interesting issues presented in this movie.  The first one is the question of what to do when a girl is raped and becomes pregnant.  Abortion?  If so, the world would have missed the great Gospel/jazz singer, Mahilia Jackson.  In this case, it is a cross-racial rape.  Barbara Ann's mother felt that giving her daughter up to be adopted by a black family would make it easier for the innocent infant.  Then, social services screwed up and 'forgot' about Barbara Ann until she was seven years old, and bonded with a very loving - indeed, saintly - foster mother.  So, she was jerked out of the only family she knew and loved to be sent half way across the country to a white Liberal, yuppie couple who seemed to want a child more for 'political correctness' reasons than genuine love and understanding of the child's needs.

One aspect that my wife and I especially appreciated was that the Catholic faith of Barbara Ann's birth family was shown to be very important to them, and it was treated with great respect.  Her birth mom was shown to pray before finally making the call that would eventually reunite her with the girl she'd given up years before.  Take note, also, that the first time Barbara Ann smiled after leaving her foster mother was also in a Protestant African American church, where a wonderful young teen boy noticed her.  They eventually graduated from school, married and had five children!

This is the true story of the life of a little girl who seemed to be nearly irrelevant to the needs of the social system.  Every family with adopted children will not want to miss this movie.  It is one that will, several times, raise a lump in your throat if you have any empathy for children.  Even more important, it is a story of the triumph of the human spirit that will leave you feeling happy you spent the time to watch it!",1182211200,48,1870,4.540298507462687

8108993,4,B000EGCD1O,So glad to find this Made-for-TV movie that was the Sunday night movie and premiered in the 90s. Moving story of an adopted bi-racial woman who searches for her biological mother and the truth that she finds along the way. They don't seem to show movies like this on regular (non-cable) TV anymore.,1374710400,,298,4.6415094339622645

8108995,5,B000EGCD1O,"This is a great film.  I am glad that Children's Services has evolved.  Today this child would not be taken away from that foster mother, at least in Tennessee I know she wouldn't.  As a former long time foster care case manager it is noticable that Hollywood portrays social services in a very bad light with the worker often being the evil villian.  Rules and policies have changed for the better, thank goodness.  Anyway, this film is in my collection.  I strongly recommend this for adoptive parents, foster parents, case managers, attorneys and judges.",1233273600,2,557,4.872340425531915
