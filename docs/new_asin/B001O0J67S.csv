8328608,3,B001O0J67S,"This video really only contains 39 minutes of instruction. The rest is ego-fluff. The instruction is good, but in a very weird sort of way. Mika Immonen never talks or looks at the camera, he just plays and shoots. The material on stance, grip, and bridges is quite good for a beginner, but a lot of the other material is more of a brief explanation/introduction to a concept, rather than anything even approaching a real breakdown of the material being presented. Add that to the fact that there are a total of 3 DVDs in this series that all seem to carry the same amount of fluff, it seems this entire series could have made it onto one $30 DVD rather than being blown out to $90/3 DVDs.

My advice: find somewhere to rent it or a library that lends it.

You will find WAY more instruction there then in this video!!!",1376352000,9,832,4.361290322580645

Down to earth and well narrated. Highly recommended! I loved the outtakes!",1371340800,,133,5.090909090909091

8328611,4,B001O0J67S,"The information was well done, very professional but only for beginners.  I recommend it if you are just starting out.  If you follow the principals shown here, your game will likely improve......it leaves one wanting to see more.",1351987200,,230,5.026315789473684
8328612,5,B001O0J67S,"all three volumes help I don't care what level of pool your at
these are the best leasons I bought after spending 2,000 on a table and books and other dvds and pool cues. I don't have money to waste... These are worth the price",1277596800,3,227,4.066666666666666
8328613,5,B001O0J67S,"Three lessons alone in this DVD immediately improved my game (Stance, Stroke, Grip). It turns out I was making several beginner mistakes and producing needless frustration in my shots because of it. After adopting a better set of physical habits, for the first time my pool shots felt *natural*.

Every lesson is clearly filmed and narrated. The total viewing time for the video isn't long, but this is actually a good thing -- you'll want to watch some of the lessons repeatedly to let the content sink in. I wish the transitions between lessons was faster; the DVD animations/transitions get a little tedious.

If you are a beginner, combine this video with some practice and you will see satisfying gains in your ability. And you'll be practicing *correctly* using solid fundamentals instead of practicing aimlessly.",1268524800,5,819,5.059259259259259
8328614,5,B001O0J67S,"I've been playing pool for a few years now and know my way around a table pretty well. I was intending to buy Volume 3 in hopes of learning a few things, but since I'm a big fan of Mika's, I chose to buy all 3 anyway. This volume of the series (Volume 1) is definitely for beginners, as it teaches you the basics of the game. However even as a better player, I still have off days. It's sometimes good to go review the basics and try to figure out where my game is going wrong. This video is a useful reminder. Plus, the runouts in the special features section are awesome. Mika is a machine.",1243900800,4,592,4.068376068376068
