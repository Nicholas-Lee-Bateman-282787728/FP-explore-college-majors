Went too far for a youth study especially when he could not line it up with scripture in a solid way. Lot of speculation.",1466380800,,295,4.285714285714286
7787795,5,0005048524,"I loved this. There's so much good information. Be careful for false review such as ""A fan"" He's obviously and evolutionist who keeps posting the same lies and two star rating on all of Dr. Hovinds products. It just shows what kind of people the evolution theory makes people to be. I guess it's ok to lie though since there's no God huh...? What a joke.. I loved Dr. Hovinds products and I know you will too.",1459728000,,409,4.324675324675325

7787799,1,0005048524,"This lame production is yet another attempt by Creationists to prove their lies.  The first half of the Bible, the Tanakh, contains a lot of interesting material of various sorts.  One thing it doesn't have, however, is even a glimmer of an idea of prehistory.  The truth lies, not in books written by a superstitious civilization, but in the evidence.

The evidence is abundantly conclusive that dinosaurs (except for the avian line) became extinct 63 million years ago.  Anybody who has seen a bird has seen a living dinosaur, but no other species of that great family now exists.  Reports of dinosaurs being seen are obviously mistakes or (in the case of Creactionists) lies.  Real scientists would give their eye teeth to find a living dinosaur, but of course nobody ever has nor ever will.  A live dinosaur, in any event, would be no proof that dinosaurs had their origin less than 250 million years ago.

There are plenty of questions yet about dinosaurs.  However, 2 of them are not ""did they become extinct?"" or ""how old are they?"".  Questions as yet unanswered also do not constitute evidence that paleontologists don't know what they're talking about.

Productions like this go only to prove how desperate Creationists are and how silly their beliefs are.",1251849600,4,1265,4.887323943661972
7787800,5,0005048524,"This is a compelling DVD about how the common knowledge of today is simply wrong.  Dinosaurs are not million of years old but only a few thousand years old and some still exist today in very remote areas of the world.  I thought this DVD was very helpful in answering some old questions of mine since I have been a child.  I believe it will help other Christians with their questions as well, just as it did mine.  These movies are for people who know the history, biology, and science books of the past and are trying to put these peices of evidence with the Bible.  A great video worth a look, but even though this DVD is compelling one must still have faith in the Scripture to be a beleiver.",1249257600,4,695,4.2748091603053435
7787801,5,0005048524,"For many years, some thought the existence of dinosaurs discredited the Biblical account of creation. In part three of the seminar series, Dinosaurs and the Bible, Dr. Hovind traces the Biblical and historical references to dinosaurs and interviews people who claim they have seen living dinosaurs.",1180742400,7,298,5.5
