7830800,5,630276288X,"Land of the Lost was my favorite show when I was in first and second grade.  To find the videos for sale years later brings back so many memories.  Yes by today's standard the show was cheesy in acting and special effects, but I got a kick out of it because I hadn't seen it in years, and it's all about dinosaurs and adventure, so the kids will LOVE this, I promise.

This particular video has two episodes, the first of which the family fights off a volcano that spews green lava.  The second a knight joins the group and they take on the resident T-rex Scarface.

Action and values all in one.  Children will love it, and some children that have grown up like myself will love it too.",1239580800,4,687,4.246153846153846
7830801,5,630276288X,This show is so awsome. I have been trying to remember what this show was called for so long. Me and my sister used to watch this show all the time and now i realize that it is a remake. This show is so hokey and corny that it's awsome. If you like T.V. shows from the early 90s then you should definitly buy this. You won't be disappointed.,1141171200,8,341,3.9565217391304346
7830802,5,630276288X,"This is one of the TV shows I watched as a kid and it brings back tons of memories.  The person that reviewed this before me must not know this was a TV show made for nickelodeon long before jurrassic park came out.  This is a children's video in a children's section and how dare you rate it so harshly. Kids will love it, I did, actually i still do and I am going to buy it right now.",1009065600,6,386,3.8734177215189876
