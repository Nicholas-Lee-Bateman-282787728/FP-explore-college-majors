7003639,5,B00TACL81E,One of the best documentaries on the ongoing research of the Torah Codes and the current climate in Israel.  Rick has gathered together the foremost rabbinical minds on this topic and provides both a high level understanding as well as a deep dive into the way this is changing our understanding of our place in time.  I've already watched this many times and keep getting more out of it every time I see it.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is even remotely interested in this amazing dimension to the scriptures.  The Bible is truly coming alive.,1423699200,14,554,4.622448979591836

7003641,5,B00TACL81E,This documentary is a must see for anyone with an interest in the codes! Richard has captured the very essence of the the codes in this visually stunning film.

His exceptional skills behind the camera is well known but this documentary also highlights his extensive research and understanding of the codes and why they are so important today.

7003647,4,B00TACL81E,"This is a GREAT resource to understanding and validating the Torah Codes.

FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT:  It addresses the naysayers and answers their most common arguments against the Torah Codes.  Don't assume this is fake until the method is clearly explained.

CURRENT & PAST EVENTS:  Movie shares some Torah Codes found relating to modern times.  From 9-11 (yes Bin Laden was involved) to Obama to modern day events happening in Israel. ... revealing even minute details to certain events.",1423526400,10,490,5.139240506329114

7003650,1,B00TACL81E,"Half of this video is essentially Israeli State propaganda which I have no problem with, but the other half regarding Torah codes is less detailed than I expected.  Rather than showing how the Torah codes are developed and how they map to the selection of letters that yield some prediction, that detail is glossed over.  Instead we're just shown letters circled on a page that create words and phrases that formed a prediction.  Not very convincing that there's something divine at work here.  The video also goes off on some tangents that aren't very relevant or convincing.  For example there's a discussion that the Bible refers to UFOs in Deuteronomy 1:28 by the phrase ""large fortress cities in the sky"" as interpreted from the Torah in original Hebrew.  Most other biblical translations of this phrase are ""great cities fortified to the heavens"".  The phrase to the heavens or to the skies is also used elsewhere in the in the Bible in the form of hyperbole to mean very high.  Not UFOs.",1505779200,3,994,4.771929824561403
7003651,1,B00TACL81E,This film isn't really about Torah codes. It's really about current politics in Israel.,1504742400,2,87,5.285714285714286

7003656,2,B00TACL81E,"Disappointing at best.

I am a scholar of such things.  When the ELS phenomenon was first popularized in the mid-1990s, I wrote at length.  I was publicized and referred to in The Guardian; Der Stern; and the Rio de Janeiro O Globo.

My conclusion: pleasant but unconvincing.  The notion that ""this is irrefutable, after all, Robert Haralick and Harold Gans say so"" has several flies in the ointment: (1) they break their own rules, reasoning forward to try to predict things rather than reasoning backward to try to find evidence for what has already transpired; (2) you can play these games with almost any suffiiciently lengthy text, as Brendan McKay proved beyond the shadow of a doubting Thomas, even if some of the demos are, in fact, impressive; (3) as Robert Katz pointed out, from three Ph. D. statisticians you'll get five mutually contradictory arguments about validity, while the EE will challenge the CS as being weak in math, etc., which is nothing but mudslinging; (4) the showstopper: it's only O.K. if it proves Jewish themes.  If, using the same techniques, I establish the validity of Christianity--or prove that fish evolved from grapefruits--then it's totally unacceptable.

LOL!

The authors speak of the Gaon of Vilna, Elijah ben Solomon Zalman, who was actually a direct patrilineal ancestor of mine.  (My grandpa Chaim--who went by ""Dr. Charles Wilner, D.D.S., of upper Manhattan""--never, ever SHUT UP about him!)  One of Elijah's techniques established beyond any shadow of a doubt that the Torah was divinely authored.  The authorities at End of Darkness are aware of this.  Once again, if I use the same technique (a slight variation thereupon, actually) to prove that the Gospel of John was divinely authored, they're ready to burn me at the stake.

If it's sauce for the goose, then it's sauce for the gander.  But not for these clowns.  Move over, poseurs, your various PhD's notwithstanding.",1495497600,3,1923,5.022082018927445

7003678,4,B00TACL81E,"The technical production is high quality but i must qualify the content. While the subject is about the Torah Codes only about half the video addresses the Codes and in a very elementary introduction, the rest is about Israel's struggle with terrorism. In that. it seems a bit misleading. The Video probably should indicate that it is introductory or basic to the subject. Another issue is that the rabbis speak with a heavy accent, hard to understand. This is mitigated by English written below as the rabbis are speaking but the letters are too small to read easily and often there is no color contrast between the letters and the background making it impossible to read.  Toward the end there is a visual image that quickly appears and disappears without any comment. However, this image is completely arresting and unexpected. I will only say that the image is a flyover of a military building in California. If this seems cryptic, it is for a good reason.",1461974400,,960,4.783132530120482

It had very good interviews with the professional people involved in translating the Torah codes.  Without being too scholarly detailed, the whole science of this subject was explained at a level I appreciated.  I feel I now understand the methods that are used in decoding the information in the Torah.  I also liked that the interviews were done in a personal way that lets me feel that I know and respect the people who are doing this work.
All in all, I feel this documentary was interesting and enjoyable to watch.  It gave me enough information so that I now feel I understand what this whole research is about.",1457222400,,759,4.712121212121212
7003683,3,B00TACL81E,"Um, I just finished watching this and, while it has interesting points, I was disappointed that I bought into all the positive reviews. It wasn't earth shaking information that hasn't already been told. What made it worth a watch were the side stories about Israel dealing with rocket assaults, Hamas tunnels, preparation, etc. However, had the side stories not been included, even with all the complexities and near impossible revelations of information found in the Torah Codes, the most they seem to achieve is confirming what has already happened but nothing prophetic. I mean, what if it says something about an atomic explosion in NYC but it's not discovered until after NYC's been nuked? When they come up with something prophetic or foretelling, and it comes true, then my interest will be reinvigorated. Bottom line is that I didn't find it interesting enough to consider watching it again, so that pretty much sums it up. I recommend renting it if you ""just have to"" see it.",1455494400,8,984,4.933734939759036

If you're familiar with the codes via a seminar from AISH, Harold Gans, etc., it's really a waste, even if you want to introduce the subject to others who know nothing about the codes.

7003691,2,B00TACL81E,I was hoping this would discuss the codes in detail and talk about the formulas used and the statistical significance.  There is not one statistician with a phd who accepts the torah codes as statistically significant and as indication of a higher being.  Those statisticians prove their point by finding other codes in other books.  I was hoping this documentary would differentiate from the codes in other books.,1449964800,3,414,5.0588235294117645

The documentary is an introduction to the ""journaling code"" which is mathematically hidden within the pages of the Torah and how this code was discovered.  I was really hoping for more ""meat"" to sink my teeth into, however, this documentary is more of a light introduction to someone unfamiliar with this concept.  After watching this documentary, I was really left with more questions than answers.  Maybe they did this on purpose to sell more material in the future?

7003727,5,B00TACL81E,"This is a great documentary about the Torah codes. While Torah codes are often misread, They DO reveal truth to those who are willing to do the necessary work. I'm very grateful the Rabbis involved. Thank you.",1435104000,,209,4.675675675675675

7003730,5,B00TACL81E,"or even of the decades. There were also other Torah Codes documentaries out there over the years, but this one is in my opinon the best. The director met and spoke almost with all important persons involved with Torah Code in Israel and US. Many Torah Code matrix tables (over 40) are clearly shown, all of them breathtaking and amazing. About conflict in Gaza, killing of Bin Laden, the Flood, the Nephilims, Adam and Eve etc. EVEN the matrix table of THIS documentary was found with the year of release (5775, which is 2015) and who will publish it (Pinlight). A bit later (few days ago) in the matrix table was also found the name of the director of the movie (Richard Shawn , of course in hebrew letters encoded). That was found and shown on youtube, by one of the main researchers. I've bought this documentary in mid February, not here on amazon (cause on that moment it wasn't available on amazon) on Blu Ray and DVD. This is my first ever bought Blu Ray and i watched it on PS4, cause currently i don't have any other device which play Blu Rays except PS4. The first Trailer of this documentary in HD on Youtube looked beautiful, but if you watch it even on a ""small"" 32"" smart TV it looks even more sharp and clear! Torah Code is indeed real and in my opinion its so breathtaking and amazing, nothing can top it, not documentaries about aliens, area 51, wormholes etc. What can be more interesting than messages from Creator of the world encoded in the only divine book? Torah Code began to be more popular beginning in 1976 (also encoded), but obviously this year and the next one are to be highlighted, cause it is now being brought to more people worldwide. As already said, there are over 40 tables shown, but this is only tip of the iceberg, there are many more breathtaking tables found over the past years, like about tragic incident of spaceshuttle Columbia - and that matrix table was even encoded with a graphical (!!) illustration of a spaceshuttle  - made with encoded words. The hebrew word ""fire"" was unter the left ""wing"" of the spaceshuttle. As we know, that was the reason of the tragedy. Google and Wikipedia for example were also found encoded (not shown in documentary, but found by serious researchers). This documentary helps the total beginners to learn about this phenomenon. If you want to find and learn about real tables, stick to the jewish researchers mentioned, cause on the internet they are many who are showing the codes in a wrong light (searching in wrong books, searching with wrong method) or even trying to use it as a crystal ball for future events which doesn't work. There are some rare exceptions found by jewish researchers, which shows codes found in advance before the actual event indeed happened (like the election of Netanyahu was found this year in February, before the election took place in March 2015). There are some more examples like this (not only about politics), but i don't won't to write here to much. It is the most interesting topic about a phenomenon ever, it should be in breaking news all over the world, it is so interesting. But somehow people are sleeping, but i think we are going slowly but surely to wake up and realize there is One who controls everything. Some know this all time, some should realize this with this documentary. 5+ stars!",1434844800,5,3320,4.617597292724196

It is a bit slow at parts, but the detailed information is so involving that you are captivated into wanting to know more.  This is not a fancy Hollywood movie that has hired people to portray rabbis and create graphics. This is truth from real rabbinical masters' mouths.

A must see film for all. Events that are coming to life which were encoded in the bible ( Old Testament ) over 3 thousand years ago.

7003745,4,B00TACL81E,"This is a well produced and directed documentary.  The topic is sensational, i.e. Michael Drosnin's books.  However, the presentation establishes not only the mathematical basis for the codes, it establishes the stature of the researchers in mathematics, statistical analysis and computer programming.  Shaw uses the words of the researchers to establish two critical points, a priori knowledge and p-value.  This addresses the critics who cite ""War and Peace"" as containing the same information.  Shaw also elicits the declaration the Torah Codes can't be used for fortune telling, one of the prohibitions in said Torah.
Coming from a computer technician and technical instructor background, this is an excellent introduction to the practical application of digital systems responding to software.  One does not need to be a hardware or software engineer to figure out this is not fake.  One has to examine all the evidence to come to a reasoned conclusion.  If one doubts, it may because of a faulty understanding of logic.",1427500800,,1025,5.3229813664596275

The part of this doc I liked the most is that they tell just enough without rambling for hours saying the same thing.
