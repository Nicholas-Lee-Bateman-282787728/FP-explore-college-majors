3737094,3,B001P24UYE,"Of course, the ideas are outdated, and rather insulting to women, but it was an amusing watch.",1464048000,,94,4.588235294117647
3737095,2,B001P24UYE,"This is not the original version, but a shortened version with commentary. Hated the jazz score",1447632000,,95,5.0
3737096,3,B001P24UYE,"Good imagery for leaving the TV on in the background and reading spooky stories. A bit cumbersome as a film or ""documentary"". Sometimes, I like to have background noise or imagery (especially to help keep the dog calm), and this is a solid option for good ambient visuals, etc..
Not really ripe for a ""scary"" movie night, and likely to prove quite tame for today's horror buffs. It's no ""Rec."". Nor Scream. Nor Phatasamogoria even. And, if you are looking for a modern movie on Witches, Rob Zombie's Lords of Salem is liable to prove much more entertaining. But, for what this is, it's decent, like a mix of an old history channel special splashed with that Syfy or Unsolved Mysteries feel.

If you are big on the Supernatural, a lot of the mythology and imagery will feel familiar. It's impossible to unknow/unsee things, so I come to this with a fair deal of reading and learning on the topic, but it could prove fairly fascinating as a social artifact and introduction to society's understanding of Witchcraft and its evolution at the time. And it's Burroughs. Always nice to hear him narrate. Not a must buy by any means, but also not a ""must avoid."" This is one that really won't be for everyone but some may find reasons to enjoy. Not without an audience, and it might be the inspiration one is looking for as they work on something a little spooky or ethereal. Cheers.",1435968000,2,1375,4.5894308943089435
3737097,4,B001P24UYE,"Just that it was narrated by William S. Burroughs is interesting enough to some of us.  That it used silent footage from the 1920's adds another layer of interest. Is it educative about the Occult?  Well, that would depend on your knowledge of the subject.  It is an interesting cultural/historical piece in that it fills in gaps in the general knowledge of culture and history created as a result of academia's reluctance to consider the film's content seriously.  ""Folk"" wisdom is the library of the subject but ""folk"" wisdom isn't easily accessible (to the casual inquirer) and tends to be more apocryphal than canonical.  It is an aspect of the humanities that has been undertreated.
  Should it be ""taken seriously?""  It could almost be equated with Coprophilia in the sense that it is a wide-spread human practice but not one that is generally accepted and (IMO) shouldn't be.",1428710400,,882,4.912162162162162
3737098,3,B001P24UYE,"Well....despite the horrific looking cover, this was not what I was expecting. To be fair, this movie was made in 1922! So I'm not picking on the movie. I just want people searching for something to watch on a Friday night to realize this isn't it.

The movie was interesting (partly from a historic film-making perspective.) I enjoyed the narrated slide-show at the beginning and the narrated moving picture at the end. The middle portion I was not really in the mood to watch all of (think Charlie Chaplin...no sound.) I shudder to think what the narrator would think of our women today if he was able to draw similarities between 1920's women and so-called witches of the past. Maybe he would've come to believe more wholeheartedly in witches and witchcraft.",1427846400,,761,4.809160305343512
3737099,1,B001P24UYE,"This is hilarious! A2ZCDS is a bootleg company with terrible product, yet they get rave reviews from anonymous contributors! Check out ""my reviews"" for either one of them. The only product they've ever reviewed from Amazon were A2ZCDS, which they thought were all fantastic! C'mon, whoever you are - show a little bit of ethical behavior! You've never bought anything else from Amazon that you'd like to review?

The first reviewer nailed it. Spend more and get the real thing. It's not worth watching a boot of a film currently available from a legit company.",1316822400,7,560,4.894736842105263
3737100,1,B001P24UYE,"I feel foolish for buying this version, because I thought it would include the same content as the Criterion Collection release I had rented before. But as it turns out, A2ZCDS is a (for lack of a better term) bootleg enterprise.  Buy the Criterion Collection version: you will get the original film, plus the commentary, plus the 1960s release by William S. Burroughs and Anthony Balch, with the kick-ass jazz score.  Don't waste your money on this release.  It is robbery.  I feel stupid.",1254441600,20,490,4.7976190476190474
3737101,5,B001P24UYE,I found this 1922 film to be amazing in it's inovative and creative portrayal of witchcraft in the middle ages. Scenes of nudity and torture made this film very controversial in 1922 and caused it to be banned as well as greatly edited in later versions. A2ZCDS did a great job in restoring this film.,1232496000,,301,4.490909090909091
8331857,3,B001P24UYE,Burn DVD plays well. It is not the original adaptation of the film. Pretty cool to sample for art or video but a little heads up on the burn DVD would have been cool. Great film otherwise.,1527724800,,188,4.108108108108108
8331858,1,B001P24UYE,This more recent version is rendered unwatchable by the staggeringly inappropriate beatnik coffee house jazz soundtrack. Please Amazon...make the original available.,1523318400,,165,6.904761904761905
8331859,4,B001P24UYE,Great and creepy film,1517961600,,21,4.5
8331860,5,B001P24UYE,"This 1922 silent film is quite good. Many viewers consider it a classic. It shows pictures and actions that depict how ancients and people of the middle ages acted and what they thought about demons and other superstitions. People, even very smart people and religious people, were convinced that demons exist and influence people. We see scenes where, for example, people buy love potions, clerics test to see if a person is bewitched, what a witch's home looks like, a trial of witches, and much more. Watching the film helps us understand the past.",1516147200,,551,4.872340425531915
8331861,1,B001P24UYE,Really annoying to try and watch.,1497484800,,33,4.666666666666667
8331862,5,B001P24UYE,An amazing film of historical importance both for its depiction of the horrific treatment of women throughout the ages and the hypocrisy of the church.  Masterfully restored for generations to come.,1485216000,,198,5.387096774193548
8331863,5,B001P24UYE,"Excellent...scary and well done.  Super ""special"" effects.",1484006400,,58,7.285714285714286
8331864,5,B001P24UYE,So so so worth watching.,1481587200,,24,4.0
8331865,1,B001P24UYE,"I love Burroughs but hated his voice overs.  Music was beatnick, and just not a good movie.",1472774400,,91,4.352941176470588
