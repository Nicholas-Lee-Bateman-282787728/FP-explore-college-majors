1896159,4,B00009XN5N,"I must respectfully disagree with the reviewer who felt that most of the performances on this DVD were ""wooden."" My reaction was quite the opposite! I felt that the actors and actresses were really performing the parts, just as they would have done them in the actual shows. I often forgot that I was, in fact, watching a clip from a variety show, and felt as though I were watching the show itself on Broadway (and I have been to many Broadway shows, so I certainly know what that experience is like!)

I especially enjoyed seeing the clips of Julie Andrews in ""My Fair Lady,"" Carole Lawrence and Richard Beymer in ""West Side Story,"" and Celeste Holm in ""Oklahoma!"" Of course, there were a few actors and/or shows which I just don't personally like very much (Anthony Newley, ""Man of La Mancha,"" Gwen Verdon), but that's not to say that their performances weren't well done.

I also enjoyed the narration by John Raitt, and hoped to see more of him (he is just shown singing the title song from ""Oklahoma!"") There is supposed to be a ""Part 2"" DVD coming out with more of Raitt included, as well as performances from many other shows. I hope it is released soon!

My only reason for not giving this DVD 5 stars is that the quality of some of the clips isn't very good, but that is understandable considering how old they are.

I would definitely recommend this DVD over ""Broadway's Lost Treasures,"" which I found very disappointing.",1096761600,20,1432,4.58203125
1896160,3,B00009XN5N,"I bought this DVD with great delight as I love Broadway Musicals. I was quite disapointed in the performances of the songs. The performers for the most part were wooden and uninspired. Carol Channing singing ""Diamonds Are a Girls Best Friend"" was a notable exception, though. She conveyed the fun and humor of the song and gave a great performance. There was close to no staging, just the artist standing there singing. The interviews with the composers while interesting, would have been better as part of the extras. They seem to simply be there to fill out the DVD. The space could have been better filled by more performances.
 I expected so much more than what this DVD delivered. Buy ""Broadway's Lost Treasures, instead. The money is better spent and the DVD is much more entertaining.",1080172800,24,791,4.8161764705882355
1896161,5,B00009XN5N,"This was pure delight - straight from a time when live TV broadcasts were the norm.  I've always loved Broadway musicals, and I look forward to Part Two of this one (it was previewed on the DVD and even told us what would be included).
How pleasant to watch nearly an hour of wonderful performances and note that no-one had to grab their crotch to call it entertainment.",1077926400,4,370,4.4411764705882355
1896162,5,B00009XN5N,"I grew up in a backwater town in California, so all I knew of Bway musicals came from OBC albums which I reveled in (until 1970 when I moved to NYC and saw some Bway shows and was bored out of my mind by them).  Since my childhood, Bway has been replaced in my affections by Bach.  But this DVD is a treasure, pure gold, a sheer delight.  It is a rare and miraculous chance to go back 50 years and see these people do what they did the way they did it then.  I loved it almost completely and have ordered a copy of the DVD (the one I watched was rented).  A few quibbles.  Merman only sang a few lines of ""No Business,"" but that was okay with me because I've seen and heard lots of her and am tired of both her voice and that song (though she did have the ear to go to her grave baffled by the success of Stephen Sondheim).  Pearl Bailey's number was I thought both colorless and flat, as was that dreadful choreography which for some reason followed a knock-out dance by Bob Fosse, which I thought was one of the highlights of the disc.  Channing also was kind of dull, her number abbreviated, and the gimmick she did with the audience just a bit too.  Finally the touted interviews with the two sets of songwriters amounted to no more than a minute apiece, I don't recall Lowe saying anything at all, and I know Rodgers wasn't even in it.  But.  Rodgers himself conducted his own ""Oklahoma!"" and then smiled and shook hands with John Raitt which was wonderful.  Enough quibbles.  Everything else else shone like a newly minted coin.  Newley sang his own ""Who Can I Turn To?"" and (like all the others) it was a jolt and a pleasure to see HOW he sang it, gestures, facial expressions.  (Incidentally, that song, commonly thought to be a love song, is actually a prayer, Cocky is singing to god, which explains some of Newley's gestures.)  Everyone has his favorites on this disc I'm sure, I loved pretty much all of it.  I couldn't get over the fact that I was actually looking into the past and seeing these performers as they were then, doing what made them ""great.""  Also, it was only about 53 minutes long, so I didn't have time to get too bored, it was a treasure I will cherish and no doubt watch again, now back to Bach.",1076803200,,2227,4.261904761904762
1896163,5,B00009XN5N,"This is a historical collection of Broadway hits by some of the greatest stars that have graced the American musical theater, and includes interviews with Oscar Hammerstein, Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, and Richard Rodgers conducts his ""Oklahoma !"" in the first segment.
A small portion of Ethel Merman singing ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" is part of the introduction, and John Raitt is the narrator throughout.
The two selections from ""Oklahoma"", are in concert format, the rest of the scenes are in costume, though all are performed during the Ed Sullivan telecasts. Most of it is in black and white, with the last three songs from '66 and '67 in color.
""Oklahoma !"" (1955): ""Oklahoma !"", with John Raitt, Celeste Holm, Florence Henderson, Barbara Cook and Richard Collett. ""I Cain't Say No"", with Celeste Holm.
""Flower Drum Song"" (1958): ""I Enjoy Being a Girl"", with the petite, sparkling Pat Suzuki.
""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" (1959): ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"" with Carol Channing, who has fun at the end of the song going down the aisle of the theater throwing rhinestone bangles into the audience.
""My Fair Lady"" (1961): ""Wouldn't it be Loverly"" with the beautiful Julie Andrews and the singers and dancers from the cast.
""West Side Story"" (1958): ""Tonight"" with Carol Lawrence and Larry Kert. Carol Lawrence is radiant, and both are vocally superb. It's a lovely scene, even with the very shaky balcony rail they are hanging on to !
""Camelot"" (1961): ""What do the Simple Folk Do ?"" with Julie Andrews and Richard Burton. Burton, here in his glorious prime, is hilarious as he dances a very awkward jig. The man could act, and even sing, but he could definitely not dance...and he knows it, making it a very funny scene.
""The Roar of the Greasepaint, the Smell of the Crowd"" (1965): ""Who Can I Turn To ?"", with Anthony Newley, singing in the show he wrote with Leslie Bricusse. One of the most unique talents of his era, Newley is riveting in this song.
""Man of La Mancha"" (1966): ""The Impossible Dream"", with the marvelous Richard Kiley.
""Sweet Charity"" (1966): ""I'm a Brass Band"", brilliantly performed by Gwen Verdon. Verdon was the quintessential interpreter of her husband, Bob Fosse's choreography, as can be seen here.
""Hello Dolly !"" (1967): ""Before the Parade Passes By"", with the one and only Pearl Bailey, looking fabulous and singing her heart out.
So many of these extraordinary artists are no longer with us, and I miss the kind of entertainment that the Ed Sullivan Show provided television viewers. In between the plate-spinners and other oddities, he presented superb performances by the very best in show business, all looking unvarnished and so real. If you are a fan of musical theater, this is a collection of gems well worth watching. Total running time is 56 minutes.",1075420800,49,2826,4.90187891440501
1896164,5,B00009XN5N,"Like the rest, I loved this and my only complaint was also the incomplete Merman ""There's No Business Like Show Biz.""  I want Vol. 2 -- where is it?  This DVD promised it and even gave you the lineup.  Btw, it was great fun to see Richard Burton dance and Barbara Cook VERY petite.",1073174400,3,281,4.166666666666667
1896165,4,B00009XN5N,"What you will find on this DVD is nearly 60 minutes of pure entertainment!  Complete performances by some of the great Broadway and theater performers of the 1950's and 60's.  With the exception of one, these are FULL performances without editing or voice-over.  If you've ever watched a tribute show where you get to see a 15-second blip of a classic performance, then you need to add this DVD to your collection.
My only flaw (hence 4 stars, not 5) is that the first number with Ethel Merman is incomplete; although it is listed on the back cover of the DVD, it is NOT listed on the inside ""Chapter Index"", nor is it included on the DVD Scene Index.  Chapter 1 is simply titled ""Introduction"" and includes a portion of the performance.  Again the only flaw.
The overall quality is very good, keeping in mind there was no Dolby Surround Sound 30 plus years ago!  The DVD extras are just filler, nothing substantial, some text to read about each show.  By all means, this DVD is worth the money, and if people support this type of programming, I imaine the companies will produce more - a second volume is indicated in the credits.",1068508800,8,1131,4.541871921182266
1896194,3,B00009XN5N,"This is an ok DVD. The performances seen are memorable, but it was not exactly what I expected. I will keep and view when I want a little nostalgia.",1383264000,,148,4.137931034482759

1896196,5,B00009XN5N,very interesting dvd. great to see the original artists. would like to see more performances of original stars.  enjoyed it very much.,1368144000,,134,5.090909090909091
1896197,5,B00009XN5N,This made a great gift for my 90-year-old lady friend who loves and remembers seeing these original shows and artists when they were on Broadway!,1357862400,,145,4.84
1896198,3,B00009XN5N,"I purchased this tape with great expectations.  I am a big fan of Broadway musicals and of Ed Sullivan.  We have a collection of wonderful Ed Sullivan compilation tapes on other topics.  I was hoping this would be the best one ever.  Unfortunately, it doesn't compare in any way to the other tapes.

This tape cuts out most of Ed's interaction with the performers.  Instead, it adds dark & dull offstage interviews with composers and producers, adds meaningless narration by John Raitt, and jumps right into most performances abruptly.

The first several numbers are from the 1950's, and the film/sound quality isn't very good. I realize these are very old clips, but the quality on our other Ed Sullivan tapes is much better.

I usually love old performances. Perhaps I am just the wrong generation for original cast members, but somehow, I can't get into any of these performances.  I have seen these plays/songs by so many other people that I like a lot better. It is only my personal preference, but I especially disliked Celeste Holm singing ""I Can't Say No"".

However, if you truly are a fan of the original singers, you probably will like this tape.",1331251200,2,1156,4.763819095477387
1896199,5,B00009XN5N,"""The Best of Broadway Musicals, Original Cast Performances from the Ed Sullivan Show"" is a treasure. Ed was a Great White Way columnist who became very popular when he hosted his Sunday night television performance show. On his show were comedians, vaudeville acts, the hottest new musicians like the Beatles and Elvis, and best of all his presentation of now rare scenes from the then current Broadway hits. Were it not for his show many of these scenes would have been lost forever. It starts with Ethel Merman belting out ""There's No Business like Show Business.""
There's a 1955 video of Richard Rodgers conducting an orchestra and chorus for a sung number from ""Oklahoma"". There are performances by Carol Channing, John Raitt, Anthony Newley, Julie Andrews, Richard Burton, Gwen Verdon, Richard Kiley, and Pearl Bailey. The early years are in black and white with color showing up in 1966 episodes; the quality is very good. Watching Richard Burton from ""Camelot"" whistling and doing a high-stepping dance is a treat.
These are not just snippets but full performances with sets and costumes. There are brief interviews with Lerner and Loewe and Rodgers and Hammerstein. This is a must-see for people who love the American musical.",1285286400,4,1234,5.053921568627451
1896200,5,B00009XN5N,"This DVD is a great look back at some of the best shows ever.  This is the only glimpse we have at what some of the original productions may have looked like.  The quality is pretty good, although this was mastered from the 1990's video release, not a remastering of the original video and kinescope materials.  If you are a fan of Broadway, I highly recommend this DVD.
Two notes to buyers:  First, the song ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" is not a full performance.  Second, at the end of the DVD there is a trailer for a second volume of this series.  This was never released on DVD and as near as I can tell, was never released on video either.",1185062400,,657,4.300813008130081
1896201,5,B00009XN5N,"This is the exact same DVD as the other Ed Sullivan Broadway DVD. I bought it because there was no desciption and I wanted to see what this was. I don't know why Amazon decided to sell the exact same thing with a different title, but here it is. This is really ""The Best of Broadway Musicals"" on The Ed Sullivan Show. It runs 57 mins and has performances from ""Hello Dolly"", ""MY Fair Lady"", ""Oklahoma!"", ""West Side Story"" and others. For a fuller description, please see the other Ed Sullivan Broadway DVD.",1116288000,26,506,4.451612903225806
1896202,5,B00009XN5N,"If you have a real love for the history of musical theatre, this DVD is a must for your collection.  There are several highlights that are simply joyous.  The Larry Kert, Carol Lawrence ""Tonight"" duet is heart rendering and a treat for the ears!  This alone is worth the price of this DVD. But, add to that the young and beautiful Julie Andrews in her prime as she delivers the quintessential version of ""Lovely"".  And, you will understand why so many raved about Pearl Bailey in ""Hello Dolly"".  When she sings ""Before the Parade Passes By"", she does not merely sing the music, she also sings the lyrics and this is something Carol Channing never really did.  The great Gwen Verdon singing and dancing as only she could from ""Sweet Charity"", the magnificent voice of Richard Kiley delivering the ultimate version of ""The Impossible Dream"" and vibrant Pat Suzuki belting out ""I Enjoy Being A Girl"" make this a special treat.  Add to that Celeste Holm's ""I Can't Say No"" (nobody does it better) and the sight of the legendary Barbara Cook as part of the group (John Raitt, Florence Henderson, Celeste Holm) singing a rousing version of ""Oklahoma"" and you have one great DVD.  The only song that does not come across well is Carol Channing singing a rather forced version of ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"".  But why quibble.  Buy this infectious delight!",1099526400,15,1356,4.7076271186440675
1896203,5,B00009XN5N,"Pretty much without exception, the original cast performances in Broadway musicals are matchless. However, the ephemeral nature of theatre makes it impossible to relive these performances over and over as we do with film, and often Hollywood translations missed out by hiring ""bankable"" Hollywood names.  How lucky that Ed Sullivan led the way in featuring many of the original Broadway greats on his show.  Of course, there are MANY more of these segments which I'd like to see make their way to DVD, but the segments presented here are superlative.  The running list follows...  Almost every one presents a Broadway star who was replaced with an inferior (and dubbed) Hollywood name in the film adaptation.

The hour long feature begins with the incomparable Ethel Merman singing ""There's no business like show business"" from ""Annie Get Your Gun!.""
