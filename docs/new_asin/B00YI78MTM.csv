The acting is really awkward and contrived. I rented this movie and was sure glad it is free with prime.  Although, we pay for prime... hmmm. Anyhow returning from my digression.  The scenery is good, the outfits and tack are brand new. Inauthentic production would be a fair assessment. Watch it for yourself as there are few if any Westerns available to Prime members. In less than 23 minutes you will be asking yourself, what other productive things you could have done otherwise???  Laundry, toe nail clipping, dishes, folding laundry, cleaning horse barn, stretching fence, wiping off my work boots... anything but finish this movie.
The ending that some reviewers brag about is not awesome. Its par for the course. The movie drags to one minute of climax. This won't be in the movie theater.  This won't be a favorite of yours unless you made it or were in it.  Not trying to be rude. Just honest.",1520640000,,1061,4.647058823529412
8718328,5,B00YI78MTM,"Dockie Barnett is a man to be reckoned with, in a land with no law. When outlaws begin murdering and robbing innocent folks, Dockie, along with  his son, daugther and close friends, sets out to even the score. This low budget film far surpasses much of what is currently being released in theaters. It's a throwback to times when westerns were great! Kudos to Mark Baugher and Patrick Ball.",1498003200,,390,4.6521739130434785

8718331,5,B00YI78MTM,"For fans of period-style, action-packed westerns set about the end of the 19th century, this film will provide enjoyment.  Note--it should be rated R for language and violence.  But as an independent film, shot and produced totally in central Arizona near Prescott, it features stunning landscapes,  some intense action by authentically costumed actors, and an ending that will make you question your own attitudes about  revenge and retribution.",1459987200,,446,5.514705882352941
