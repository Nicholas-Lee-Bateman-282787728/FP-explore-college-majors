648161,5,6303459978,"I saw this film in 1994 when it first came out, and it still stands out in my mind as one of the best historical fiction films that I have ever seen.  I am a big fan of Dumas, and had read the book that it is based on,  ""Marguerite de Valois"".  I usually don't like films based on  books, but this film was truly spectacular, with all the elements that make  up a good Dumas story: romance, swashbuckling, history, and tragedy.  Unfortunately, the film is no longer available for sale.  Does anyone know  where I can get a copy?",937008000,3,528,4.21
648162,5,6303459978,"I loved this movie!! It evoked the period very well,  as opposed to Elizabeth which imposed modern sensibilities on the Elizabethan period.  This movie had all the romance, plotting and nastiness of the  post-reformation era.",931824000,,225,5.371428571428571

648410,5,6303459978,"A superb film, truly breath taking. A film I have watched three times and found more satisfying with each viewing. Most recently I watched it having completed reading Nancy Goldstone's excellent history 'The Rival Queens' which encompasses this period of French history, the wedding of Marguerite de Valois, the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, and its aftermath. Having read Nancy Goldstone's book has given me a far better understanding of the events portrayed and the realisation that Alexandre Dumas' account, from which this film is scripted, departs here and there from strict historical accuracy. Despite it's less than perfect source material, this remains a spellbinding piece of French cinema. The cast are peerless, Isabelle Adjani in the title role of 'Margot', and Virna Lisi as her mother Catherine de Medici, are truly outstanding. Perfectly paced, perfectly directed, it is an extremely satisfying film from so many perspectives.",1438646400,,944,5.472602739726027

648413,5,6303459978,"I had seen this movie several times in the past, but having just read a copy of Nancy Goldstones wonderful book, The Rival Queens: Catherine de' Medici, Her Daughter Marguerite de Valois, and the Betrayal that Ignited a Kingdom, I had to purchase a copy of the movie.

I watched it once while reading the book and again after finishing the book.

It is a beautiful movie, very beautifully filmed and acted.  Isabelle Adjani is breathtaking as Marguerite de Valois, more commonly called Margot.  Margot was a French princess, roughly contemporary with Elizabeth I of England, who lived an extraordinary life, full of danger and adventure.

This movie is based on a different book, a novel, Le Reine Margot, by Alexandre Dumas.  I have never read that book, so I cannot speak to any comparison between it and the movie.  The movie only covers a very small part of Margots life.

I highly recommend this movie, despite the fact that I now know how much of it is fictionalized (well, thats not a surprise, is it?).  The movie has Margot posing as a streetwalker to pick up guys for sex.  (Oh, come on.)  She also met her lover, La Mole, under very different circumstances.  The real Charles IX also died of natural causes.

The sad part about people who only see the movie is that they will never realize how incredible a person Margot really was.  I highly recommend the Nancy Goldstone book, which is very entertaining as well as informative, to learn about the real Margot.

The first time I saw the movie, I was a little confused as to who was who, not being all that familiar with the characters.  The main things you need to know to enjoy the movie is that the treacherous Catherine de Medici was ruling France through her son, Charles IX.  Catherine adored her younger son, Henri, and favored him over her other children, especially Margot, to whom she was very cruel.  Charles protected Margot but never hesitated to use her to his own advantage; her life was always in danger as he was weak and inconsistent in his protection.  Margot was a devout Catholic, but she was forced (literally) to marry the leader of the Huguenots (French Protestants), Henry of Navarre (the king of a small kingdom dependent upon France), at a time when Protestants and Catholics were bitter enemies and often at war.  Part of the reason Catherine set up the marriage was to arrange an assassination of an enemy.  That plan went very, very wrong, and the consequences were horrendous.  Henry of Navarre never trusted Margot, despite her bravery and kindness, and avoided her.  Margot found someone else to love and to love her.  Two other characters, Margots friend and that friends lover, also are prominent characters, and they share a similar fate.

Watch the movie and then read the Nancy Goldstone book to find out what really happened, and more importantly, what happened with Margot afterward -- and, trust me, a whole lot happened.",1427068800,,2923,4.74059405940594

648689,5,6303459978,"This very beautiful, lush and dark movie concerning the circumstances surrounding the marriage of Queen Margot with Henri de Navarre is set during one of the darkest events in French history.  Many of the facts surrounding the St Bartholomew's Day massacre in France (how many were killed, who really instigated it, and such) are still being debated, but there are facts that are an integral part of this movie. The massacre did happen, the queen seems to have manipulated the whole thing through her influence and the results were devastating.

Charles IX, the son of Henri II of France and Catherine de Medicis is king in name but is controlled by his conniving and powerful mother who has her own agenda on how to control France. Moving her children around like chess pieces on the board of Europe, she positions each to obtain maximum advantage for not only herself, but the Catholic Church and the French throne (and particularly for her favourite child, Henri duc d'Anjou who becomes Henri III).  All this and the simmering tensions surrounding Marguerite's (Margot's) marriage to the Protestant Henri de Navarre are the basis for this beautiful and violent movie.

The ethereally beautiful Isabelle Adjani perfectly portrays the amoral Margot (yet a lioness to protect others when it counts), and Vincent Perez ably portrays the protestant Joseph de la Mole, but it is Jean Hughes Anglade a marvel in his portrayal of the physically weak and high-strung Charles IX, Daniel Auteuil's nuanced and excellent interpretation of Henri de Navarre who is forced to marry the daughter of the alleged poisoner of his mother, and especially Virna Lisi as Queen Catherine de Medici, who dominate the screen. Lisi's interpretation is subtle and yet ferocious, she barely raises her voice but her poisonous words poured into the ears of her sons move them to murder thousands.

This adaptation of historical figures takes a bit of license with a few facts, yet the real-life Margot was allegedly a beautiful and sensual woman, the lover of the powerful men (including the power-hungry de Guise) who indulged herself shamelessly. Surviving all her brothers, the childless Margot was the last of the House of Valois, perhaps ironic as her mother had tried so hard to justify all her power plays for the Valois sons and their progeny throughout her life. Historians still debate that Margot was a victim of incest by her brothers from an early age, an insignificant female pawn in the family, yet taken as fact in this movie.

Other great performances are Miguel Bose as the viciously obsequious de Guise, Dominique Blanc as the pleasure-seeking Henriette de Nevers, and Pascal Greggory as the reptilian and amoral future Henri III. Perhaps one scene demonstrating the morals of the French court is Henriette's stroll through the streets of Paris filled with dead and dying Protestants. She picks her way delicately through bloody bodies, her bell-like laugh as brittle as she is, casting amorous glances of promise at a blood-covered Marc-Hannibal de Coconnas whose eyes never leave hers as he slaughters a hapless Protestant offering at his feet.",1362355200,5,3138,5.059961315280464

648692,2,6303459978,"Let me begin by saying that this is one of the most brilliant historical films I've come across.  Isabelle Adjani is positively radiant and the story line is gripping.  If I were rating the movie itself I would give it 5 stars, hands down.

The reason I am giving this product 2 stars is because I was very disappointed to learn that not only are there no French subtitles (very helpful for learning advanced level French) but you DO NOT HAVE THE OPTION OF REMOVING THE ENGLISH SUBTITLES. For anyone hoping to further their language abilities you will find it very distracting and unhelpful to have the English subtitles throughout.

However... the Miramax-issued R1 DVD is a disgrace that does the movie no justice. To begin with, it's not anamorphic. Then, to compound the problem, a frustrated color correction technician has been allowed to give the whole film a huge dose of red. If you've seen the laughably bad bluray of Spartacus, you'll understand what I mean! Even stranger, there is a perfectly good R2 PAL DVD, which is anamorphic and doesn't have the color issues. I saw the film at the theater and I have both the US and the UK DVD releases. I don't understand why the film hasn't been put out on blu ray (at a guess, the same contractual issues that led to the junky R1 DVD have also delayed a BD release) but in the meantime, go with the R2 PAL DVD.",1326499200,,875,4.3090909090909095

This 1994 movie, whose central event is the Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre in late-16th century Paris, is based on an Alexander Dumas' novel: it is a rip-roaring drama with wonderful stars (Adjani, Perez, Auteuil) and lavish costumes.  The conflict between French Catholics and Protestants--as an account of a self-destructive religious conflict--has a lot to say to us.  But it is plenty entertaining!  As an added bonus, the supporting actors are top notch: Virna Lisi is a murderous Catherine de Medicis and Jean-Hugues Anglade (as Charles IX) steals every (twisted) scene he is in.",1326240000,,659,5.298076923076923

Would recommend.
Movie is a good clear picture, with option of English subtitles. Not as glamorous as most of the movies about the way of life in France in 1500.

Jean-Hugues Anglade, words alone will fail to describe his performence in the role of the King, he was fabulous. Pascal Greggory was excellent, even through his role was brief. Vincent Perez deliverd a good performence as well.  the most prominent word about this very film could be 'Realistic and Genuine', thrown lights on the events that took place in 1572, France (the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre).

But I eventually figured everything out and went on a great ride. There's much innuendo about incest which went over my head but since the possibilities were not central to the story, it mattered not. Isabelle Adjani is exquisitely and panssionate as Margot. The sets and costumes are lush and the cinematography superb.

This film is an artistic masterpiece all around, from the costumes, set designs, acting and execution of the plot. And it is the reason why I love movies. I am going to have to order it from Amazon now, so as to have my own copy! They don't make movies like this every day. I give it an enthusiastic thumbs up, A+, and an extra hundred stars.",1217030400,2,770,4.546762589928058
648922,4,6303459978,"To begin with, the transfer used for the region 1/US version of the DVD is inadequate when compared to many other StudioCanal and Miramax productions on disc. It is NOT anamorphic and overall the ""letterboxed"" picture looked terrible blown-up on a 50"" Panasonic plasma display. It's a good thing the story is so engrossing and the cinematography is so rapturous or else I would have felt like turning it off and waiting for a better release. Also, this is sadly a truncated and re-edited version of the original French theatrical release; this probably won't effect most people since there's enough sex and violence in this version of the film to satisfy even the most unenthusiastic viewer of subtitled movies. The sound however was quite good and I was jarred a few times by the intensity of the score pounding through my speakers. I only detracted one star for the quality of the picture and conditions surrounding the edit; the film itself is easily 5 stars.

Now on to the good stuff. (SPOILERS AHEAD!) This really is quite a stunning piece of film making. It is based on the Dumas novel which is in turn based mostly on historical fact. If you have an interest in French history (or movies about court intrigue) I strongly suggest you check this film out and read up on the actual events before or after so you are clear on which creative liberties were taken with the material. The acting is uniformly superb: Jean-Hugues Anglade's King Charles IX is so tragic and pathetic that it's hard to not feel sympathy for his manipulated (and manipulating) character; Daniel Auteuil shines again (as usual) as Henri de Navarre, the eventual ""Henry the Great""; Virna Lisi is perfectly cast as the epitome of evil schemers, Catherine de Mdicis (looking like one of Frank Herbert's Bene Gesserits incarnate); Pascal Greggory as Anjou, one of Catherine's incestuous sons, can reveal more hate and contempt with a single look than most actors can with a whole monologue; Vincent Perez and Claudio Amendola are perfect as sworn enemies turned brothers-in-arms; the radiant Isabelle Adjani (as the titular character, Marguerite de Valois) is the sun in which all of these characters revolve. There are many other performances of note (especially  the actor who plays the small part of the executioner who nurses La Mle and Coconnas back to health only to have to do his job and execute them later) and of course the Pice de rsistance of the whole film is the actual events leading up to and including the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. I highly recommend this film to anyone with an interest in historical/literary films and until a restored, definitive version of the film comes along this one is well worth the twelve to fifteen bucks.

Though it's hinted at in the end, it has been written that Margot ""embalmed la Mle's head and kept it in a jewelled casket"" to (as she says in the movie) ""preserve his beauty""...",1214697600,3,2910,4.816

Catherine, who lusts to acquire power, arranges for Margot to marry a Protestant prince in an effort to reconcile relations with the Protestants (and consolidate her power base).  The farcical marriage takes place but Margot does not love Henri (the Protestant Prince) and begins a passionate affair with a Protestant soldier.  Catherine also schemes to bring about the the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572, when thousands of Protestants are slaughtered.  Revenge plotting and murders follow.

Outstanding acting by Isabelle Adjani who plays Margot.  Beautiful cinematography and camera work capturing Margot's close-ups and rendevous', the stabbings, the rapes, betrayals and massacres.

However, this film wasn't for me.  Film opens with the introduction of a large number of characters  - none of which were adequately explained or developed - who's who?  Who's on who's side?  Who's related to who?  What's behind their motives?  Eventually you wade through to assume the answers but have to work quite hard to get there.",1213401600,2,1168,5.411111111111111
648924,4,6303459978,"Margot"" was well done technically and as realistic as much of the massacre was portrayed, it left this amateur historian empty. After viewing the provocative film, ""appalling"" best described my initial visceral reaction. A genuine attachment to any of the characters would have given the story so much more depth and impact. I felt the story lacked a genuine human edge, which would have balanced any need for a background In French History. Caring about the characters and understanding the climate that would allow such an atrocity, would have made the film so much more powerful.

This time period was also akin to the France that Dickens described as the ""best of times and the worst of times"". More of the best was needed in order to understand or appreciate the true loss of life and liberty.

The movie did peak my curiosity and outrage, which led to further research. I discovered so much more to the story, including my own Huguenot heritage. Soon I was passionate to write a different story, not merely from a religious or political viewpoint but through the eyes of a humanist-- a womanizing artist who soon finds more than the nudes he captures on canvas, when he finds love that changes his life and when he stands with other brave hearts in a fight for life and civil liberty. It's inspired by a true story of the unbridled abuse of power and a tribute to all who know the true power of love and honor. So far, it's won 15 screenwriting awards and amazing reviews. Now, it needs an amazing lead producer. [...]",1211414400,,1524,4.661710037174721

Outstanding period piece exhibiting French filmmaking at it's very best! Based on the historical 'Massacre of Saint Bartholomew' in Medieval France on August 24, 1572, director Patrice Chereau provides to the viewer a visual feast examining the darkside of European aristocracy and their constant quest for power and wealth.

As the splendor and pageantry of the French court commences it only thinly masks the greed and avarice quickly taking control within the castle walls. Love and lust, treachery and murder, hatred and revenge are the order of the day as constantly shifting alliances are made and broken. However the intrique within the halls of power are but a microcosm of the terror and violence erupting on the streets of France between the Catholic and Protestant citizenry. It's a time of radical change and only the brave and the clever will survive.

Warning; this is a very violent film. There is an immense amount of death and brutality and the camera doesn't hold back on the visuals.

Outstanding cast featuring; Isabelle Adjani as the stunningly beautiful Margot de Valois, Daniel Auteuil (one of Frances' finest) as King Henri de Navarre, Jean-Hugues Anglade as Charles IX, Vincent Perez as La Mole, Pascal Greggory (who is absolutely amazing) as the evil Anjou, Virni Lisi as Catherine de Medicis and Asia Argento as Charlotte of Sauve.",1197763200,,1462,5.156118143459915

The Medici's,a  strong and overpowering French family had ruled France with it's Protestant intolerance in a time when all of Europe was aligning and realigning themselves politically and religiously in order to war and conquer. Margot,a Catholic(Isabelle Adjani),the only daughter of the murderous Catherine of Medici (a magnificent and totally hateful Virna Lisi)is married off against her will to Henry of Navarre,a Protestant (Daniel Auteil)in what is supposed to be a day in which all of France will be united in one religious tolerance (but really it is all about alliances formed in order to battle Spain....Oh those Royals!!!).What transpires,though,is the historic slaughter of 6000 Huguenot Protestants under the combined effoerts of various Medici royals. All of this is sound and historical. Where this film,which runs a laboriously bloody 144 minutes,falters is in the continued story of Margot and this man whom she has had sex with (that is putting it mildly!)and her protection of her new husband and all of these other subplots and people that just simply becoming overwhelming and almost silly!

This is a story about a very corrupt and powerful French family that just happen to be the rulers of France.  Margot is the only daughter and is used as a pawn to marry someone she doesn't love--but does grow to love later.  Her one true love though, is another man, with whom she has a torrid and oh so brief affair with.  LOTS of bloodshed, as parts of it are based on fact--the slaughter of subjects because they were not of the same religion-- incest, and just plain old mean, power-hungry rulers/brothers killing to be King.",1173312000,,724,4.373134328358209
649102,2,6303459978,"Maybe that's what Dumas meant to write, a historical soap opera but I can't imagine the book being this ridiculous and sensationalist. The fact that Patrice Chereau is President of La F&eacute;mis, France's most prestigious film school just goes to show how little that title means. But then that title does mean that he's an establishment man through and through and this is France's establishment cinema version of a Hollywood type historical epic funded by the same men behind the men behind the men that control all big productions for the dual purpose of mass propaganda and profit. Adjani started with Truffaut and got famous enough to end up here (and in that crappy remake of Diabolique with Sharon Stone in the actual Hollywood) and though Truffaut never had a budget like this or wanted it he was 10 times the filmmaker that Chereau is.

Where do we start? Let's start with some of the sensationalism meant to sell tickets. Chereau must be a feminist for sure since ""Queen Margot"" has more male frontal nudity than female. Women who want to see Vincent Perez flash his schlong into the camera gratuitously not once but twice (the first time, a total surprise, while being undressed by Adjani and Dominique Blanc after he's been attacked into a bloody mess! You see it's not gratuitous, they're only doing it to ease his pain and make him more comfortable, that's why he turns around completely towards the camera in his writhing pain so all can see!) should definitely watch this flick. I cracked up when they almost had Daniel Auteuil flash into the camera too but at the last moment there's a cut and he appears covered in diapers since his character is supposed to be not really a sex symbol or romantic interest but more of a friendly goofball victim. Maybe Chereau was getting his back against the demands of the producers for nudity by turning the film into a comedy? Who knows? Men get to see much less of Isabelle Adjani (or the fabulous Asia Argento playing Auteuil's mistress) but then the best place for that is the ""Violent Summer"" film (a much better film than Queen Margot, by the way) she did which became a huge hit in France precisely because she was naked in it a lot.

As a matter of course, the entire movie was cynically calculated for the exact amount of sensationalist or titillating scenes to 'entertain' the audience as mindlessly as possible and sell more tickets. It is watchable once and not quite as bad as a Hollywood film only because of the caliber of the actors. The performances are excellent all around, especially those of Adjani, Virna Lisi, Dominique Blanc and Auteuil but they don't have much depth either written or directed to work with or towards. Adjani plays the heroine as an air-head nymphomaniac slowly developing depth and understanding and cunning and a lesser actress could have easily overplayed her part into too much melodrama on top of the entire melodramatic tone of the film, making it that much worse. Instead her restraint and approach makes the film better than it deserves to be. The same applies to Auteuil and Lisi and to a slightly lesser extent to Perez and the rest of the cast. Lots of nasty power-hungry people going around intriguing to poison and kill each other. Lots of violence and blood and heads being chopped off and animals being killed and women being thrown out of windows. Wonderful movie for the kids, especially the massacre of the 60 protestant nobles in one night and the last scene with the two bloody beheaded heads on the table with Margot calmly stroking one of them on the cheek. If violence is ok with your family and only sex is censored then only one of the sex scenes contains hard humping against a street wall and the others are very loving and romantic and pretty much missionary style. In France they might rate this as PG-13 but in the USA it is definitely R. Also, I might add that the pseudo-new-age music with the ocassional soft hip-hop or house beat was laughable and completely inappropriate for a historical film. Thank god they didn't use it much or it would have sent the flick into unwatchable territory. It's hilarious that the music is actually praised!

The DVD had a decent but not spectacular transfer and no extra features. Overall this film is good to watch if you want to see great actors make the best of mediocre material and don't want anything deeper than what an episode of Dynasty would deliver to munch your pop corn to and relax. Otherwise for a great Dumas-based film go back and watch Richard Lester's original Three Musketeers again.",1169510400,8,4569,4.715894868585732
649103,4,6303459978,"Alexandre Dumas brought an effortless narrative mastery, in-depth human portraiture, and an uncanny ability to reanimate the past... His novels are work of marvelous intelligence and pure enchantment, adventures for both the heart and mind...

'Queen Margot' gives a magnificent description, pulsating with life, of the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew and the events of the succeeding years, closing with the death of King of France, Charles IX... The motion picture shows how religion was certainly the basis for warfare, and delves into conspiracies, ruthless murders and cover-ups, betrayal, seduction and instigation to incest...

'Queen Margot' offers with plenty of blood the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, as it came to be known, destroying an entire generation of Huguenot leadership, while also creates shrewd characterization, complex plot evolution, and acute political and social insight...

France was the ""first daughter of the church"" and its king, the ""most Christian King"", and no one could imagine life any other way... One faith, one law, one king. This traditional saying gives some indication of how the state, society, and religion were all bound up together in people's minds and experience... The religious wars began with overt hostilities in 1562 and lasted until the Edict of Nantes in 1598...

The film opens in 1572...

Admiral De Coligny, now the chief military leader of the Huguenots, has gained the king's trust and is trying to lead him into a dangerous war against Catholic Spain... The king's brothers Dukes of Anjou and Alenon and their ally, the young Duke De Guise, are opposed to Coligny and his influence...

In an attempt to regain her power and take credit for bringing peace, the Queen-Mother began negotiations to marry her lovely daughter Marguerite to Henry of Bourbon, ""first prince of the blood,"" the next in line for the French throne...

However, while this arrangement is intended to secure peace between the rival religious factions, it is a marriage of convenience only, a union of Protestant and Catholic, at a time when the political enmity of the two religions was intense and bitter... The common people felt no such harmony, and tensions grew in the towns and countryside..

Isabelle Adjani is exquisite as Marguerite De Valois, the most beautiful woman in the French court... Black hair, fine complexion, voluptuous eyes, a red and lovely mouth, a graceful neck, an enchanting figure scarcely twenty, the much 'loved,' even by her three brothers... Margot lives in magnificent style, free to pursue her amours...

Daniel Auteuil is very good as Henri of Navarre, the uneasy leader of the Huguenot, or Protestant party, who is threatened on every side by three brothers--the king, and the dukes of Anjou and d'Alenon, by their mother, and the Duke of Guise... Henry had a quality which, like lightning, shone most brightly in moments of storm and gloom...

Virna Lisi is dictatorial, unscrupulous, calculating, and crafty as Catherine De Medici, the Queen-Mother, the most influential personalities of the Wars of Religion... With unrestrained violence--her eyes, on occasion, could be at once glassy and penetrating...

With Jean-Hugues Anglade as the pale face young king, Vincent Perez as the ill-fated lover, Pascal Greggory as Catherine's favorite son, Asia Argento as the delicately beautiful baroness, 'Queen Margot' received nominations for Best Foreign Language Film from the Golden Globes and for Best Costume Design from the Academy Awards...

649248,5,6303459978,"Based upon a romantic work of historical fiction by Alexandre Dumas, ""Marguerite De Valois"", this is yet another triumphant period piece by Miramax Films. Critically acclaimed, the film is the winner of five Cesar Awards, as well as the prestigious Cannes Film Festival Jury Prize.

The film is set in medieval Catholic France during the reign of Charles IX. There has been unrest between the Catholic majority and the Protestant (Huguenot) minority. It is August 24, 1572, a day that will live in infamy. The day begins auspiciously enough, as it is the wedding day for Margot, the sister of Charles IX. It is an arranged marriage between Catholic Margot and Protestant Henri de Bourbon, the King of Navarre, a province in France. It is a marriage that is supposed to quell the unrest between these two warring religions. As such, many Protestants travel to Paris to see the union between these two royal personages.

After the wedding, the evil and power hungry Dowager Queen, Catherine de Medici, mother to Charles IX and his two younger brothers, Anjou and Alencon, as well as Margot, sets in motion a series of intrigues and plots and reveals what her true motives were in arranging this marriage, motives that the King of Navarre already suspects. Far from being a merger to unite Catholics and Protestants, it is a call to arms against the Protestants, resulting in the infamous St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, in which over six thousand unsuspecting Protestant men, women, and children were brutally slain.

Margot, who initially dislikes her husband and is known for her wantonness, does make a pact with him to be his ally. When the carnage begins she is appalled but is soon drawn into her family's plots and intrigues. She realizes, however, that her survival, as well as that of her husband, depends upon her new lover, La Mole, son of Coligny, the King's slain advisor. Thereafter, Catherine de Medici continues to plot against the King of Navarre, seeking his death. Margot spends most of the film trying to keep her mother and brothers in check and her husband safe, while satisfying herself with La Mole.

Isabelle Adjani is stunning in the role of Margot. Luminous and looking ethereally beautiful, she is simply magnificent. Daniel Auteuil is terrific as the beleaguered King of Navarre. He infuses the role with a warmth and humanity that makes the viewer instinctively root for him. Jean-Hugues Anglade is excellent as Charles IX, a weak king dominated by his ruthless, grasping mother who would rather see her favorite son, Anjou, on the throne. Anglade makes the role three dimensional as he adds a certain sensitivity to the role. Pascal Greggory, who plays Anjou, adds a certain delicious creepiness to the role of the envious younger brother who longs for his brother's death so that he can wear the crown. Virna Lisi is a commanding presence as the evil Catherine de Medici, who would willingly sacrifice her children for power and see so many of her plans go awry. Last but not least, Vincent Perez is excellent as handsome and loyal La Mole.

Potential viewers of this French language film should be aware that it is an extremely violent film, due to the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. It is also sexually explicit, with frontal nudity scenes. Moreover, while the DVD provides wide screen format, excellent audio and visuals, as well as scene selections and subtitles, it does not offer any extras. Notwithstanding this, the film is one that all those who enjoy period films or historical fiction will, undoubtedly, enjoy.",1164499200,2,3552,4.943048576214405
649249,4,6303459978,"This film won 3 of the 4 top acting awards at the French Academy of Cinema for Best Actress Isabelle Adjani, Best Supporting Actress Virna Lisi & Best Supporting Actor Jean-Hugues Anglade.  In addition, it also won Best Cinematography & Best Costumes, as well as being nominated for the Best Costumes Oscar in the United States.

The historical drama portrays the events of St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in August 1572 where peace was alternately promoted between Catholics and Protestants, and then within hours shattered by butchery.

Isabelle Adjani as the title character gives a deep nuanced performance as the beautiful Margot.  She has a state wedding to King Henri de Navarre played by Daniel Auteuil who has 4 Best Actor nominations by the French Academy of Cinema and two wins for ""Jean de Florette"" (1986) & ""The Girl on the Bridge"" (1999).  Auteuil turns in a good performance as the nervous king who must make fast alliances, quick religious conversions to stay alive, and wend his way through the snakepit of court intrigue.  As the Queen Mother, Virna Lisi is positively chilling.  Her transformation is so complete that it's hard to picture that this was the same bombshell beauty who starred with Frank Sinatra In ""Assault on a Queen"" (1966) or with Tony Curtis in ""Not With My Wife You Don't"" a year later.  Her performance in this film also landed her the Best Actress award at Cannes.  She plots, she poisons, she manipulates & assassinates so profoundly and thoroughly that she is a marvel to watch.  On the throne is Charles IX played by Jean-Hugues Anglade.  His first film was also with Margot's director Patrice Chereau in 1983's ""La Homme Blesse"" where he played a homosexual coming to terms with his disposition.  Pascal Gregory plays the slimy Anjou, brother to the king, with perfection.  Margot's marriage to Henri is not to be consummated; so she goes to the streets wearing a mask in search of a lover.  She comes upon Le Mole whose horse has just been stolen and has steamy sex against an alleyway wall.  Vincent Perez plays La Mole.  He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor by the French Academy of Cinema in 1998 for ""Those Who Love Me Take the Train"" and has appeared in some American films like ""The Crow: City of Angels,"" ""Queen of the Damned,"" & ""I Dreamed of Africa"" with Kim Basinger.  Perez's full-frontal nudity and steamy love scenes with Margot may titillate mature audiences, but may not be appropriate for younger viewers.  There is also a LOT of gore in the massacre scene as Protestant victims are first stripped and then gutted by sword.  While the film in its American version seems to end rather abruptly with Mole's head on the shelf, Chereau does paint a masterful love story in the epic period piece.

We focus on the royal family, political unrest and Paris town events on August 24, 1572, official French history date of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. It's a religious war (and oh, aren't those the most violent, odd, isn't it). I suppose the traditional incest has sparked THIS generation of royal idiots to think a forced wedding of Margot De Valois, sister of King Charles IX, to King Henri of Navarre will fly well. Catholics versus Hugenots. Digression: I am reminded somewhat of the Serge-Colin Angelique romance novels which capture much of the same religious/political unrest in France. End of digression. This film has it all: sex, intrigue, blood and guts, poisonings, incest, and epic beauty. Great costumes too.

Margot is played by Isabelle Adjani. She is GORGEOUS, by the way. Brother Charles is played quite convincingly by Jean-Hugues Anglade. I think Daniel Auteuil who is King Henri is enjoyable in all his performances.

The first half is very impressive as it builds up to the bloodily realized St Bartholomew's Day Massacre, but the aftermath is less effective despite a number of potentially intriguing plot developments and relationships. But then, director Patrice Chereau is always better at set-up than delivery. Certainly you tend to observe the characters as they go through hoops rather than being particularly involved with them. Isabelle Adjani's performance doesn't help matters: she's fine as the icy royal in the first half, but she never convincingly thaws once the horrendous lengths her family are prepared to go to becomes apparent. Daniel Auteuil overdoes the eyepopping mugging as her reluctant and justifiably nervous husband, but Jean-Hughes Anglade as the weak and doomed king and Virna Lisi as the ice-veined Catherine de Medici genuinely impress.",1145750400,,968,5.375

How telling it is that American audiences seem to have a greater appreciation of European cinema than we Brits, despite the fact we're in Europe! One reviewer said this film was 'Mills & Boons' on film. If bloody massacres, clandestine intrigue and deeply complex characters are features you expect to find in a trashy romance novel, then I advise you to stop reading, leave this page and never come back.

La Reine Margot tells the story of the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre and of the final days of Charles IX of France. As a student of history I can tell you with confidence that this film is one of the best potrayals of any historical event ever filmed. You feel as though you're actually there in the winding streets of Old Paris, the air thick with hatred between Catholic and Protestant, as well as the glorious palaces of the Royal family and the grandeur of Notre Dame. The sets and costumes are excellent.

The acting in this film is also flawless. Virna Lisi plays the queen dowager Catherine d'Medici to perfection, a performance that won her the best actress award at Cannes. Similarly, Isabelle Adjani is perfect as Margot, the beautiful Catholic princess who rescues a Protestant soldier from the massacre, only to fall in love with him, to the horror of her family.

However the intrique within the halls of power are but a microcosm of the terror and violence erupting on the streets of France between the Catholic and Protestant citizenry. It's a time of radical change and only the brave and the clever will survive.

Warning; this is a very violent film. There is an immense amount of death and brutality and the camera doesn't hold back on the visuals.

Outstanding cast featuring; Isabelle Adjani as the stunningly beautiful Margot de Valois, Daniel Auteuil (one of Frances' finest) as King Henri de Navarre, Jean-Hugues Anglade as Charles IX, Vincent Perez as La Mole, Pascal Greggory (who is absolutely amazing) as the evil Anjou, Virni Lisi as Catherine de Medicis and Asia Argento as Charlotte of Sauve.",1134086400,3,1396,5.136563876651983

649341,5,6303459978,"I've always had a soft spot for Dumas pere, but not for American films based on his work.  Most of the Three Musketeers films have been too burlesque and Iron Mask and Monte Cristo far too melodramatic.  Finally with Queen Margot, someone got it right.  Not surprisingly, this is a French film, although I was a bit wary of Patrice Chereau ever since his direction of Wagner's Ring in the early '80s.

Queen Margot deals with the events leading to the change of royal dynasties from the degenerate Valois to the more vigorous and adaptive (at least in the 16th and 17th Centuries) Bourbons. The specific historical setting is the St Bartholomew's Day massacres of 1672 and the next year of so in their aftermath.  Although little known in America, this was a pivotal time in French history at which the Catholic and Protestant faiths reached impasse and began a century of reasonable co-existence.  Daniel Auteuil plays Henri de Bourbon (to become Henri IV) wonderfully.  He is a remarkably flexible actor who has been convincing in all sorts of roles from Jean de Florette to The Widow of St Pierre.  Perhaps that is entirely appropriate, since Henri IV changed religions several times, the last with the famous quote that ""Paris is worth a Mass.""

The real merit of Queen Margot, however, is as a period piece.  A have seen few productions that do such a good job depicting the urban squalor (but not necessarily poverty) that was in Paris in general and the Louvre area in particular in the 1670s.  The one disadvantage of the film is that it's subtitled with the audio in French.  Because of this and the pace of the plot, events can go by somewhat quickly.  Accordingly, I would recommend that before watching Queen Margot a viewer spend 10 minutes in an encyclopedia and becoming familiar with the characters, particularly Admiral Coligny, Catherine de Medici (the Queen Mother), the Duc de Guise and Charles IX.  The small effort will pay large dividends in following events and in enjoyment of a very wonderful film.",1121817600,11,2024,4.795389048991354

In ""Camille Claudel"" as well as in ""The Story of Adele H."" she even is a subject to an inexorable psychological decline process. In ""Queen Margot"", regarding to the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre (24th August 1572) the insanity seized whole groups of peoples: The catholics slaughter the Protestant Huguenots. Unfortunately murder courses rooted in religious differences did not lose due until today at topicality and cruelty. Beside the inconceivable devilness of the Nazi regime today Serbs, African or Irish people, American Crusaders or Islamic fundamentalists unchanged are making negative headlines.

Catholic Queen Margot (Adjani) and the Protestant King of Navarre (Auteuil) are united in an arranged marriage; not in the least interested in making this match and suspicious of what it means, the King forms an allegiance with Margot to try to protect them from the incessant intrigue and plotting on Margot's side of the family.

I actually came upon this film only because it had Jean-Hughes Anglade from Nikita and Killing Zoe.  He is wonderful but the real scene stealer is Isabelle Adjani!  You would never have noticed that she was well over 38 years old when then film was made, she looks so much better than she did 16 years earlier in Herzog's Nosferatu remake.  Adjani is absolutely captivating, she has a screen presence that can only be compared to the likes of Ingrid Bergman or Gong Li.  If you really like her, check out Camille Claudel which is probably her only other really good film.
La Reine Margot is a luscious political adventure set around the event of the terrible true-to-life St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.  The supporting cast, including Anglade as Charles IX, and Vincent Perez as Adjani's lover La Mole, is consistently superb.  If you haven't seen this, you are definitely missing out.  La Reine Margot probably helped to influence the similar medieval themed queen epics Elizabeth (1998, UK) and Suriyothai (2001, Thailand), both of which should definitely be checked out if you enjoyed this one.

So why on earth did Miramax decide to put out such a horribly bad DVD transfer of this glorious film?  From the opening credits, the amount of digital artifacting in the blacks is horrific - the frames literally freeze when there is no movement on screen - the audio is hollow and without depth - and picture detailing is washed out.

649451,5,6303459978,"Based upon a romantic work of historical fiction by Alexandre Dumas, ""Marguerite De Valois"", this is yet another triumphant period piece by Miramax Films. Critically acclaimed, the film is the winner of five Cesar Awards, as well as the prestigious Cannes Film Festival Jury Prize.

The film is set in Renaissance Catholic France during the reign of Charles IX. There has been unrest between the Catholic majority and the Protestant (Huguenot) minority. It is August 24, 1572, a day that will live in infamy. The day begins auspiciously enough, as it is the wedding day for Margot, the sister of Charles IX. It is an arranged marriage between Catholic Margot and Protestant Henri de Bourbon, the King of Navarre, a province in France. It is a marriage that is supposed to quell the unrest between these two warring religions. As such, many Protestants travel to Paris to see the union between these two royal personages.

After the wedding, the evil and power hungry Dowager Queen, Catherine de Medici, mother to Charles IX and his two younger brothers, Anjou and Alencon, as well as Margot, sets in motion a series of intrigues and plots and reveals what her true motives were in arranging this marriage, motives that the King of Navarre already suspects. Far from being a merger to unite Catholics and Protestants, it is a call to arms against the Protestants, resulting in the infamous St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, in which over  six thousand unsuspecting Protestant men, women, and children were brutally slain.

Margot, who initially dislikes her husband and is known for her wantonness, does make a pact with him to be his ally. When the carnage begins she is appalled but is soon drawn into her family's plots and intrigues. She  realizes, however,  that her survival, as well as that of her husband,  depends upon her new lover, La Mole, son of Coligny, the King's slain advisor. Thereafter,  Catherine de Medici continues to plot against the King of Navarre, seeking his death. Margot spends most of the film trying to keep her mother and brothers in check and her husband safe, while satisfying herself with La Mole.

Isabelle Adjani is stunning in the role of Margot.  Luminous and looking ethereally beautiful, she is simply magnificent. Daniel Auteuil is terrific as the beleaguered King of Navarre. He infuses the role with a warmth and humanity that makes the viewer instinctively root for him. Jean-Hugues Anglade is excellent as Charles IX, a weak king dominated by his ruthless, grasping mother who would rather see her favorite son, Anjou, on the throne. Anglade makes the role three dimensional as he adds a certain sensitivity to the role.  Pascal Greggory, who plays Anjou, adds a certain delicious creepiness to the role of the envious younger brother who longs for his brother's death so that he can wear the crown.  Virna Lisi is a commanding presence as the evil Catherine de Medici, who would willingly sacrifice her children for power and see so many of her plans go awry. Last but not least, Vincent Perez is excellent as handsome and loyal La Mole.

Potential viewers of this French language film should be aware that it is an extremely violent film, due to the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre. It is also sexually explicit, with frontal nudity scenes. Moreover, while the DVD provides wide screen format, excellent audio and visuals, as well as scene selections and subtitles, it does not offer any extras.  Notwithstanding this, the film is one that all those who enjoy period films or historical fiction will, undoubtedly, enjoy.",1083456000,157,3564,4.948073701842546

France is gripped with skirmishes between Roman Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots), leading to the doomed marriage between the royals, Catholic Margot (Adjani) and the Protestant King of Navarre, Henri (Auteuil).  Following the wedding, Margot's mother, Queen Catherine de Medici, wages a Protestant slaughter in the streets of Paris and imprisons Margot and Henri.  This epic history is used as a backdrop to tell the more intimate story of the coalition between Margot and her husband, as well as her relationship with her Protestant lover (Vincent Perez).
The acting, costumes, and cinematography are all first-rate.  Accordingly, the movie received an Oscar nomination for best costume design, and it won 5 Cesars (the French equivalent of the Oscar), including best actress for Adjani.  The director (Patrice Chreau) succeeds brilliantly because he manages to make the film urgent, unlike most historical dramas, by focusing on the passion involved in the characters' lives.  Queen Margot is also surprisingly bloody and realistic for such a picture, and the slaughter is depicted rather graphically.  The only debit of the film is the overly complex and sometimes confusing political machinations that drive the narrative.

The first hour of this film builds up to this event. The rest deals with the fall-out as Margaret, appalled by the massacre, allies herself to the Protestant cause and seeks to help both her new husband and her new lover La Mole, whom she has saved from the general slaughter, to prevail against the schemings of her own dreadful family.
This is a hugely melodramatic film based on a romantic novel by Dumas so it probably is not the most reliable way of informing yourself about 16th century France. But that doesnt stop it being enormous fun. The atmosphere of the French court, a decadent milieu where promiscuity, adultery and incest are so normal as barely to excite comment, thick with plotting and intrigue, is deliciously presented and the romance of the love affair between Margaret and La Mole is carried off with gripping panache. The acting is excellent. Adjani, Auteuil and Perez are excellent in the main roles of Margot, Navarre and La Mole. Jean-Hughes Anglade is magnificently  sometimes hilariously  over the top as a weak and unstable Charles IX.  and the show is more or less stolen by Virna Lisi as a splendidly evil Catherine de Medici, creeping around the place like Max Schreck's Count Orlok, never happy unless she is plotting the death of another of her many enemies.

You have a wonderful roman feuilletee that will keep readers coming back and coming back for each installment. Reading La Reine Margot can be distracting, because Dumas was something less than perfect in the continuity department.

The linchpins  are as old as time itself: the conflict between equally blind and uncompromizing religions, the dilemma of love vs. duty, and the trageday that attends true love. This would be pretty even in modern garb.
The production is marvelous. The sets are warm and mysterious. Isabelle Adjani captures all of the sensuality and savvy of Margueritte de Valois. The casting of a very ordinary looking Henri Navarre is brilliant. Those of us who have read the original may miss Coconnais and de la Mole as their significance is underplayed. That is OK.

If you don't like the sight of blood, you may want to avoid the film--the St Bartholmew's Day massacre (Aug. 24) is a big event--but if you love history--especially European history--especially French history--this film will prove interesting.
Queen Margot (Adjani) was a real person who was forced to marry the Spanish prince who became Henri IV (Daniel Auteil). Henri was from the Bourbon branch of the French family and on the day of his marriage to Margot, he converted to Catholicism. It was he who said, ""Paris is worth a Mass.""
Margot did not love Henri, and eventually he divorced her for her wanton ways and married Marie who is well remembered as his wife and widow and a co-ruler of France. While she was married to Henri, Margot is reputed to have been involved with many men.

While the historical outlines of the story are true, the discrepancies and anachronisms of the movie are huge, largely due to their being seen through the lens of a 19th centry romantic novel (Dumas, La Reine Margot).

649556,4,6303459978,"This movie has sex, violence, murder, political intrigue, religious hatred, bloody massacres, all the ingredients for solid adult entertainment.
The one historical flaw that I don't think has already been mentioned is the prophecy given to Cathryn Medici regarding the fate of her three sons. It's a documented historical fact that this prophecy was given by Nostradamus. In the movie, she receives it from the fat, disgusting executioner, who practices divination using organs dissected from the body of a condemned prisoner. The director may have made this choice for effect, but it is a gross inaccuracy. Nostradamus has never been described as large and overweight, he was a court physician, not a butcher (he even strongly opposed the then popular practice of bloodletting as a cure), and he divined using a brass bowl, filled with water and perched on a tripod; his visions appeared to him reflected on the pool of water. The director appears to have sympathy for the Protestants, but it seems he was loath to give credit to a Jew who was driven to convert by the virulent religious intolerance in France at that time.",1046995200,3,1124,4.98404255319149

649628,5,6303459978,"WOW~ what a movie!  This is one of the best period films ever.  I have this on VHS but I would LOVE IT on DVD! It's available in the UK on DVD but not here! This movie has it all... there's non-stop action, romance,muderous plots(and accidental ones), staring a disfunctional power trip family, secret lovers and a secret marriage! It begins like this:  A Catholic princess, Margot, is forced to marry to a Prodestant just to make life easier for the monarchy with the Prodestants.  The poor man who married Margot is frightened for his life after the massacre of Prodestants throughtout the city on the night of their wedding. Margot's family is ruthless!  She falls for a prodestant (not the man she marries although she does feel sorry for him and helps him the best she could)man and would do anything to be with him. This movie had me on the edge of my seat! There is so much more in this film but I'm not going to give it away.  They couldn't pick a better cast!  Isabelle Adjani is absolutely breathtaking.  Vincent Perez is a positively unforgetable! Daniel Auteuil, Jean-Hugues Anglade, and Virna Lisi were awesome too!  I hope this will come out on DVD soon! BUY the movie! You won't be disappointed!  CHEERS! BRAVO!",1028419200,5,1226,4.608294930875576
649629,5,6303459978,I love this movie and now own it and have viewed it several times. Vincent Perez proves once agin that he is not only a great actor but one sexy one as well. Isabelle Adjani is heartbreaking and beautiful to behold. The history in the film proves once again how inhumane man can be in the name of religion instead of being merciful in God's.

649630,4,6303459978,"Everything about this picture is beautiful, even the ugliness is beautiful...an oxymoron, but the only way I can describe it. This is a stunning tale of 16th century sex and violence, with a dirty realism, but still an overlay of beauty.
Isabelle Adjani is intense, beautiful, and sensuous as Margot, the highly sexed, intelligent and dutiful sister of the doomed King Charles IX of France. She is forced into a marriage of political and religious convenience by her bitterly ambitious mother, Catherine de Medici (Virna Lisi) to the repulsive Henri Navarre (sympathetically played by Daniel Auteuil). There is a tremendous amount going on, and Margot's incest with her brothers is more than hinted at.
The searingly sensual Vincent Perez plays La Mole, who eventually becomes Margot's doomed lover. Their first encounter is an acrobatic feat of anonymous sex in an alleyway that is breath-taking. Their later love scenes are intensely erotic. This film only becomes better on repeat viewings. I found I was able to grasp more on my second viewing. There is so much going on, so many twists and turns and shocks, and the film is also quite long. It never lags, and even Margot's grudging tolerance, if not love, for her husband, is believingly portrayed. Very highly recommended.",1014076800,4,1279,5.0663507109004735
649631,5,6303459978,"I first saw this movie soon after it was released on video here in the States. I am anxious to see it again, since it is unlike almost any other historical movie in terms of authenticity. I was at first distressed to find that it was out-of-stock, but I was greatly relieved to find a new, unused copy available at auction through Amazon. I ordered it last night and it is on its way already! When it comes to finding items, Amazon just can't be beat!!!",995673600,,453,4.27906976744186
649632,5,6303459978,"Margot is a many dimensional character, who at first seems cruel and shallow, but by the end of the movie seems very human. The action scenes are beautifully depicted and nothing is hidden, just simply because it  could offend you. I thought it was a wonderful movie, and I would love to  read the Victor Hugo Story someday, en francais.",954547200,2,337,4.6
649633,5,6303459978,"This is one of the best period movies I have ever seen.  It is honest and realistic. This movie is not sugar coated and doesn't hide the way things were back then.  It has very graphic murder and sex scenes, but again, this is how it was back then.  I appreciate its honesty.
The acting was some  of the best I have seen in a long time.  Most of the time only the  expressions on the actors faces said enough. If anything it is a good learning tool of the past.",952560000,6,461,4.010989010989011

649635,5,6303459978,I was channel surfing and came across this on Cinemax and was spellbound. I rifled through the Tv Guide to see what it was and stayed tuned until the end. It was so fascinating and enthralling. It gave me a bit of insight  into a bit of history that I never paid much attention to before. My heart  went out to the King as he lay dying as his guilt became so obvious and the  execution in the end was wrenching and so emotional to the viewer.  Unfortunately it is not available on DVD or VHS so I will be scanning  around trying to find a copy for my collection. Truly a superb movie and a  keeper.,938044800,,598,4.068376068376068
7847345,5,6303459978,"French with subtitles but well worth the slight inconvenience. Feels almost anthropological in the authenticity of of the time period and culture. This makes it different to the typical BBC-type costume dramas we English-speakers are accustomed to in which -- aside from the costumes -- Elizabethan England, 12th century Italy, or 16th century Russia all come off as stiff-upper-lip Victorian Brits. Not that those are not enjoyable, but watching this French-made period piece is a profoundly enjoyable & deeply authentic experience.",1517443200,,533,5.592592592592593
