I thought a better alternative ending should have been right after the dinner scene with the parents. Some gore.  Lousy drone aerial footage detracts from the overall quality.",1472774400,,256,5.071428571428571
8752276,4,B01C5AI7KM,"Aram (Francisco Barreiro) is an unrewarded accountant who does good work. He quietly schemes to get what he believes is owed to him. This includes kidnapping the boss' (Jorge Molina)  daughter (Daniela Soto Vell). The film follows the home break-in formula of kidnapping and revenge. It is the last half hour which makes the film worth watching...unless you like nudity.

Daniela Soto Vell plays a great teen on a revenge binge even if the whole plot was not realistic. It has dark humor moments.

English subtitles.

8752277,3,B01C5AI7KM,"Scherzo Diabolic,"" is a thriller about a mild-mannered man who sets in motion a disturbing plan for vengeance. Aram (Francisco Barreiro) is a low-paid accountant living a dull existence, putting in overtime hours without getting paid for them. With a nagging wife who berates him for not being assertive, he suffers inwardly while awaiting a long-deserved promotion. Though outwardly he is quiet and unassuming, Aram is secretly devising a scheme that will finally get him what he feels he is owed.

Though the movie, written and directed by Adrian Garcia Bogliano, plays more like mystery, the final third inches into horror with some shocking violence accompanied by the darkest kind of humor. The film is essentially a psychological study of an extremely complex man. Barreiros performance at times enlists our sympathy, and at other times repels us. Thats what makes the movie so interesting. Most thrillers simply establish a villain and then show him/her going down well-trod cinematic territory. Director Bogliano keeps us on our toes, wondering what Aram is all about and keeping us in considerable suspense.

Scherzo Diabolico plays with the notion of monster. Aram is not an obvious monster, but one who observes, seethes, plans methodically, and finally puts in motion his devious plot. Perhaps his seeming normality is his most frightening aspect. He fits in so well  even blending into the background of most peoples lives  that he is virtually invisible.

The film is in Spanish, with English subtitles. Special features on the DVD release include commentaries, making-of featurettes, a music video, and theatrical trailer.",1462233600,2,1637,5.305019305019305
