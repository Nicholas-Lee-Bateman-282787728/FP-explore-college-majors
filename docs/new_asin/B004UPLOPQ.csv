were so great but unappreciated at the time and look how many bands STOLE their sound and songwriting and made millions but the Ramones
finally got the credit they deserved as one of the greatest Rock bands in American History! This is a great show and they sound great! Joey
Ramone had one of the best voices in rock music ever! I compare him to Elvis, Tom Jones, Phil Lynott, Cash etc...all who had original and
unique deep voices like nobody else. He lost a bit of it at the end but here he is in his best form. It's as good as It's Alive DVD and CD before
Tommy quit the band. It is also the tour of their best album Road to Ruin so you get to hear many songs from that album. A must have concert!",1445990400,,843,4.053892215568863

They were all that I had ever hoped they would be and more. This was only in PAL so buy and player that will play PAL and see history in the making.",1383782400,3,268,3.6379310344827585
8441972,5,B004UPLOPQ,"25 songs in 50 minutes...furious and awesome.  Although the quality is not HD (it's from Europe in the 1970's),it is worth it.l  I was teased by the 2 or 3 clips used for the ""It's Alive"" DVD release.  Then I found this.  And, boy, was I happy to have a region-free DVD player.  There's an interview at the end and it's in German, but I don't care.  I didn't get this so I can watch some old German punk dish about the show. I wanted to see the Fast Four do their thing.  Also, there are some songs tey rarely played live,from what I understand.  ""Don't Come Close"" and
""Needles and Pins"" come to mind.  IF you're a Ramones fan or know one, they NEED this.",1356998400,6,656,4.142857142857143
