8262395,4,B0016GOK30,"Basu Charterjee, the well known Director of Hindi and Indian movies, has directed this movie (remake of an American movie?), which is a story of deliberation by the Jury in a patricide trial.

The movie is gripping, although the scene of the entire movie is just the room where the Jury deliberates.

Many characteristics of human beings are reflected in the 12 Jurors, as they deliberate on the crime. Many seemingly trivial and overlooked details come to the fore and swings the Jury.

The Jury starts with a lone dissenter and then goes on to agree unanimously. For more than this, please see the movie, which will not disappoint those who love quality cinema.

The acting is good, and Annu Kapoor and Pankaj Kapoor have excelled. Unlike most Hindi movies, there are no songs here. I noticed that there is no lady actor, and there was widespread smoking among the Jurors!",1297036800,,874,4.768211920529802
