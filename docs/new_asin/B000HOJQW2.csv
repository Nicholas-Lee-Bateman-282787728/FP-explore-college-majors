8140656,5,B000HOJQW2,"Adam is the king of the slow-burn solo style that I love so dearly. This is a really useful DVD for any low- to high-intermediate guitarist wanted a better understanding of the fretboard, instead of just playing scales and hoping to hit the right note. I use the info in this DVD daily.",1445731200,,286,4.415094339622642
8140657,5,B000HOJQW2,"This DVD helped me understand triads and diads and how to use the in real music. Besides, you can also see how Adam Levy feels the music and which guitars he uses. You should also buy the book",1383264000,,192,4.078947368421052
8140658,4,B000HOJQW2,"This is a great tool for any guitarist that plays with other guitarists or chordal instruments. Instead of the typical aproach of noodling around with scales, Adam's appproach teaches you to play complimentary parts with traid, dyads, using a capo, ect.

Adam seems to play with more singer/songwriter type projects than anything else, but the infromation here is useful in any genre I can think of.

Adam comes across as a likeable guy and has a good teaching style.",1332115200,,467,4.89873417721519
