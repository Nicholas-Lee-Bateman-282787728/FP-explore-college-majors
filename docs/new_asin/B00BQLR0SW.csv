5666747,5,B00BQLR0SW,"The best dvd  purchases I have made ever!!!
ok with that said while I did very much enjoy the dvd its is not the full story it is only a part of the story and I am awaiting the full release, I don't mean that its missing one or two parts I mean after the end of the 10 disks their is still so much more to the Bhagavad Gita (The Song of the Bhagavan) that you can see on LIFEOK tv but I have missed so much episodes I would really like them to relies another 10 disk set or maybe even a 20 disk set their really is so much more that you can only see from the tv series that if I my estimations are close it wood fill up another 20 disk set.",1412640000,2,640,3.6715328467153285
5666748,5,B00BQLR0SW,"I'm half way through the epic. It is a very beautiful story of Shiva & Sati. The quality of the movie is EXCELLENT! I'm learning more about Sati's struggle to reach her greatest potential, Adi Shakti. I also see the infinite compassion, patience and undying love & support Shiva has for and gives Sati in trying to help her reach her pinnacle, Adi Shati. I highly reccommend this epic for anyone interested in learning more about Shiva and his consorts, Sati & Parvati.",1412553600,4,469,4.662650602409639
5666749,1,B00BQLR0SW,"When you purchase something as beautiful as this program, you expect it to be beautiful. The episodes, contrary to expectations were choppy because significant segments were deleted or left out in order to compress the content. It is highway robbery when you do that and then charge the amount of money. I had looked forward to it with such enthusiasm and was extremely disappointed for the following reasons: more than one DVD of the 10 were damaged, the episode would suddenly stop leaving me frustrated, the episodes were not true to the original content with significant segments missing. The producers of this DVD should have added not subtracted from it.",1410566400,11,660,5.009090909090909
5666750,3,B00BQLR0SW,Came right on time which was great......but was a bit damage on the outside n in the inside  but not  the cds just the box which comes with the dvds.,1410134400,,149,3.933333333333333
5666751,5,B00BQLR0SW,"Devon ke Dev Mahadev TV series is a rare spiritual treat (amongst many other TV shows out there today).  The music is the BEST (out of all).  It is a pity this series is only currently available in Hindi language.  Such great TV shows should be recorded in multiple languages (e.g. English) so that people across the globe can benefit from the content.

Nonetheless, a great TV show.  I personally disagree with what many other people have said - the DVDs arrived in a BIG box, all brand New content.  My suggestion is just check the ebayer prior to purchase.

I would recommend you to buy the original series.  You will also be supporting the show.  So Enjoy",1404518400,,659,4.516949152542373
5666752,3,B00BQLR0SW,"Missing lot of scenes and they have skipped a lot of important scenes. They could have increased the # of DVDs and increase the price to include those content because these are epic series and content is important than important scenes.

I will note that some scenes appear to be cut short, which was disappointing. However, overall, this was well-organized onto disc and also, this is of a very high quality.",1394496000,6,307,4.703703703703703

5666757,5,B00BQLR0SW,"I was so happy when this dvd box set arrived to me in the UK, it only cost me 45 off ebay - (Indian dvd box set with english subtitles) as it came from India, but with absolutely no response or replies to my questions & enquiries in reference to this box set until AFTER I took the risk of buying it. During watching the dvd series which made me feel that I was being lifted up by what I would call an amazing infinite moment of clarity was then let down after at the end after realizing that it only contains 30 episodes of the whole box set. No wonder the sellers did not want to answer my questions.

Apart from watching amazing scenes of our great ancient Pre Harappan & Sarasvati Vedic civilisation I think the promoters/distributors of the series could have delivered this set of dvds to us in a honest & informative way, one would expect to see some notice/clear info of the content, that would have not lead me to feel disappointed in my fellow Indians that they value money more than values themselves. As an Indian I feel violated by my own people, I did not expect this from such an amazing production, but obviously this is expected, sadly & typically like most things in modern Indian, very poor quality & even less service.

The 30 episodes that I have watched so far are amazing & I highly recommend anyone & everyone to watch them, however, I am so highly disappointed too, but it gives me the opportunity to slate the distributors/promoters of this dvd so called box set/series for what I would call a devious (asura) behaviour as far as selling this set goes towards people like us who just simply want to experience some visual satisfaction & leeeen-ness. I understand that it is available to watch on the net which is great but my issue is that many of us paid a lot more money for what we thought & expected to be the whole show, like Vishnupuran/Ramayan/Mahabharata... but it is not. Though it may be affordable to buy the whole set piece by piece, in the end It will cost a fortune to own the whole series on dvd. I haven't seen it advertised anywhere that this set will be sold in sections as to notify us the masses & masses of consumers who will purchase it to support it, but it would have been nice if this info could have been share with us so to alleviate and doubt of what we might be purchasing.

The story line are superbly amazing and spiritually soothing as usual & imagery of these episodes is great, but I think in the world that we live, the technology which is at our fingertips the directors could have spent the extra 10 or even 15 rupees more to upgrade the special effects as well as the sound quality which was terrible on the individual vocal audio, I noticed it from the beginning of the series, I know that I am not the only one that would have noticed the weak editing & sound distortion around the solo voice audio, especially when their is no music playing in the back ground to conceal it. Obviously the music & songs are superbly done, I would love to have the audio cd if any one knows if it is released please let me know. As for the special effects for a series like this humble series you wouldn't want it to be too far fetched but it could have been a little better than it was. I don't watch Bollywood movies but I have seen some clips of CGI special effects used in certain super hero clips which have been way better than in this particular series. This series is only a couple of grades up from Ramanand Sagar's effects in 'Ramayan'. If you get the spiritual gems from this series that the main thing.

Finally, definitely as far as the production team & actors go they all did a superb job in creating this fantastic series, but it has failed in presentation to the public an informative deliver as to what we are buying e.g.(a fraction of the whole series) this 10 disk set is not a value for money production & the cost of this set out weighs its quality.

On my written rating I will give this series a 1 star only for what I feel for the effort in quality/sound & mis-advertisement of this very short dvd production, but will definitely give it its due rating of 5 stars for the beautiful & spiritual journey it takes us on. I very highly recommend that you 'DO NOT' buy this box set, but I highly recommend that you do too, its your choice, LOL, to be honest I am glad that I bough this, the reward of watching this is priceless. You can watch it for free on-line before purchasing it when the price drops & when the full dvd set is available, that way you won't feel cheated like I do. Enjoy a great journey.",1389484800,,4576,4.310104529616725

5666760,5,B00BQLR0SW,"watched couple of shows at my visit to India and liked it.
I was looking for set with English subtitles for my kids.",1383350400,,116,4.086956521739131
5666761,4,B00BQLR0SW,"I first found this series on YouTube and got hooked on it even though it was all in Hindi.  Having read some of the Puranas, I could understand the storyline, but was really happy to get the English sub-titled version. Sometimes it's just a silly TV show but at times it's wonderful and profound, and always spiritually uplifting.  I love the actors, the dialogue, stories, sets, music and costumes - just too much fun to watch!  I would have given it 5 stars except that some of the episodes are cut and it's hard to navigate in the DVD's. Otherwise the DVDs have very good picture and sound quality. I recommend this series to anyone who is interested in Indian religion and mythology, or like me - a yoga student and teacher with an interest in Shaivism.",1380672000,,757,4.510948905109489
5666762,3,B00BQLR0SW,"I thought when you pay $89 - you would get a complete content. There are many parts those are missing from the DVD or they on purpose skip those parts to fill in the number of DVDs. Had this been an American show - it would have extra material than missing. This is the irony of India. Say something and then deliver something.

Pros: Good Video Quality and Mahadev's Story
Cons: In some episodes - poor (echoed) voice quality. Not complete.

I am not happy - the reason I bought to see the complete serial not skipping parts: Here are some of those:

1- The Rishi Kashyap and his wife's conversation while sati was in you nidra - is missing
2- When Sati's mom said to sati that speak only truth - that whole conversation is missing
3- Siva fights Asuras in Human form and gets the sword cuts over his body
4- Shukracharya tells Tarkeshwar to cover SUN as his scheme is working
5- Sive kicks Nandi while in human form
6- Siva tells Vishnu and Brahma that which trimutri are they talking about before Vishnu asks where they want to use his Sudarshana - on Tarkeshwar or on Sati
7- Tarkeshwar kills humans and takes over earth
8- Nandi goes and plead to get Sukarna to go with him to face Shiva
9- After coming back to God form siva questions Brahma about MAYA.
10-The Parvati episodes are many missing gaps

... and the list goes on

They could have put 2 more DVDs a nd made it 12 DVD set to have all on it.

so far - I will update as we go alone

I would have rated more - but since content is missing the whole experience is not good.

However, The quality of DVD is good as I go along. If you have not watched this serial on TV you may not find missing parts. However, there was some important clips those are missing. Well for the content that is there - I am bumping the rating from 1 to 4.

Since LifeOK is owned by FOX - one would hope that they should have made a complete set.

I am downgrading the rating to 3.",1376352000,44,1920,4.137096774193548
5666763,4,B00BQLR0SW,"There is just something about this that keeps me watching.  I love mythology and this one is fun with the typical drawn-out drama of Indian serials.  My reason for buying this was purely for the English subtitles, but I know my Mom is going to enjoy it and after she is done, it will probably make the rounds in the family.  The only complaint I have is that the sound quality is not that great.",1375401600,,395,4.24
5666764,5,B00BQLR0SW,I accidentally came across this show on You Tube and got so addicted to it. My little son who hardly understands Hindi was very excited when we got this set with the English subtitles. It was very disappointing when the set ended with the Shiv-Parvati wedding and we couldn't find a DVD set 2 with the further episodes. We are waiting for the release of the next set of DVDs,1373846400,10,374,4.357142857142857

5666766,5,B00BQLR0SW,"I accidentally found the series online and got addicted to it even though I didn't understand a word.  The visuals are very interesting, Mohit Raina in particular is fascinating to watch.  He richly deserves the Best Actor in Indian television award he won for his acting as Shiva.

The delivery was great, glad to see that there were subtitles though all the writing on the cover and DVDs is in Hindi and not English so I couldn't understand it. Nonetheless, the menu is in English when you play the DVDs so that was a relief. The only reason why I'm giving 4 starts out of 5 is because many, many scenes have been edited out!! I really wish they were on the DVDs. Most of the scenes are available online, on LifeOK's Youtube channel but I would have loved it if the DVDs were not edited and it was possible to have each and every scene available.

I can't wait to buy the rest of the seasons on DVD!!!!",1371600000,8,701,4.043165467625899

I am glad I had downloaded when the show actually aired on as a television series. Many of the associate actors quit and were replaced so it looks weird as you get used to a certain face. The soundtrack is still awesome though! I always tell people makes sure to download because they show the actual scene as aired. Indian DVDS cannot be trusted as they may cut out a favorite scene or dialogues.,1468800000,,566,4.4
