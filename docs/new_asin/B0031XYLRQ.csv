8387294,5,B0031XYLRQ,"I love this set. I'm a big fan and collector of old black n white
movies and tv shows. This collection is rare tv probably never seen
or only seen once. Its way before my time but I love old gangsters
action type films. Theres many familiar faces the notable is Lee
Marvin and Simon Oakland who's really good as a mob boss. He should've

love this. Too bad there aren't more sets released.",1332115200,8,457,4.204545454545454
