8045659,4,B000784XO4,"Sherlock Holmes Volume 7 TV Classics, 1954 film

These four episodes are part of the thirty-nine episodes produced in France for television. They are in English, but you can hear some actors speaking with a very slight accent. These lower budget productions have humor not found in earlier stories. This DVD has only four episodes, as if it was copied from a videotape. These mostly original stories are serious, not a parody. Their quality varies, but all are worth viewing. They are not in the original order, a number in brackets identifies their sequence. The actors are Ronald Howard as Sherlock Holmes, Howard Marion Crawford as Dr. Watson, and Archie Duncan as Inspector Lestrade (and others).
