5159056,5,B008FYZI3M,"Man- Want to see some young lions growl and prowl; catch Gary Oldman at his wildly brilliant best, Sean Penn as good and great as he always seems to be; and add Ed Harris- an icy Ed Harris- to the mix --- and you get a killer of a film.  I think you could re-release it successfully today.  Super stuff!  Excellent tension, rhythm and fire.  Beautifully photographed and directed, too.",1363478400,,385,4.457142857142857

5159061,5,B008FYZI3M,"It's interesting , this is an older film. Each and everyne of this young cast are known Holluwood names. Think about it, John C Reilly , Ed Harris , Sean Penn, Robin Wright ,(who became Robin Wright Penn after this movie. ), Gary Oldman ( this performance could be the best of his career. ) this of coarse is just an observation. Also, the last scene, the gun battle in the Irish bar might be one of the best gun battles on film. Certainly right up there with the good cop ,bad cop shoot out in LA Comfidential!!",1422835200,3,512,4.23469387755102

5159081,2,B008FYZI3M,"The copy of At Close Range does not adjust to widescreen televisions. Rather stunning that there are still DVDs being made like that, even cheap ones.",1378425600,9,150,4.8076923076923075
5159082,2,B008FYZI3M,"These look like they would be good movies, but they aren't subtitled, and the audio quality is so poor that I simply can't understand what the characters are saying.  Very frustrating.",1376524800,5,184,4.935483870967742
5159083,5,B008FYZI3M,"Another Amazon purchase well worth the investment!  ...love these double features.  ""State of Grace""  is a successful study of the human soul trying to survive  the hellish existence of Hell's Kitchen.  It's a good portrayal of how social environment takes its toll even on the best of folks.  Sean Penn stars as the kid that got away and opted to become a cop.  Twelve years after leaving The Kitchen, he's back and undercover.  Gary Oldman is his best childhood friend, who with his older brother, played by Ed Harris, now run a ring of Irish thugs that Penn is charged with taking out of commission before they form an even more lethal partnership with the Italian mob.  Brilliant acting all the way around!

""At Close Range"" is another good buy and well matched in this 2 for 1 purchase.  Again, Penn delivers and what's not to love and hate about Christopher Walken's performance!?",1369440000,9,886,4.7254901960784315
5159084,5,B008FYZI3M,"I bought this for the movie At Close Range which is based on a true story. You can't beat the combination of Sean and Christopher Penn, Crispin Glover and Christopher Walken at his slimiest best!! Added bonus...a young Kiefer Sutherland!",1366675200,,237,4.95
5159085,4,B008FYZI3M,"Product is new and in a sealed box.  Both of these films are worth watching and for the price, worth purchasing.",1364601600,,112,4.333333333333333
