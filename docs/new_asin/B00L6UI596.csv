6473602,5,B00L6UI596,"There has never been and never will be a US release of Eureka on Bluray. I purchased my Eureka Complete series set from the Amazon German site for the equivalent to $50 USD and yes, the product packaging is in german, the content of the disks themselves has many language options. Upon loading the disk the first thing you see is a language selection menu where it is defaulted to English. It took about 2 weeks to get to the states but when it did it was totally worth it. I have always wanted to own Eureka on Bluray, not only because the DVDs are so expensive and split into half seasons but also because Bluray quality is just so much better. Trust me when I say that if you purchase this Eureka set you will not be disappointed. The quality of the show itself and then all of its extras & special features makes it worth it.

Though, I do have to point out that this is the same picture as what was on the Amazon german site, what I got from there was not this box set (which people complained about disks being scratched) but rather what you would expect a complete series box set to be with each season in an individual bluray case.",1434412800,35,1139,4.248847926267281
6473603,1,B00L6UI596,It's in German.  Seriously?,1433980800,6,27,5.75
6473604,5,B00L6UI596,"5 Years of absolute fun!  Eureka is just so much enjoyable sci-fi fun, you should not pass this up. Like a lot of people, I missed most of eureka as the SyFy channel moved from Science Fiction to wrestling and ghost hunting...  I had previously just turned to SyFy and left it on till bedtime, catching Eureka whenever it came on.  When the programming changed to garbage, I just never turned to SyFy, so I missed a LOT of old Eureka.  This set is perfect, just start with the first disc and watch the episodes back-to-back until the ending.  FANTASTIC.  The video quality is excellent on screen as well. I am watching on one of the new 4K screens.",1422230400,22,648,4.4033613445378155
6473605,5,B00L6UI596,Hello i played my german blu rays edition of eureka on the philips 4k player and had no issues what so ever maybe some players have issues but that model and for the people that have a problem with the box and cases being german don't or atleast use some common sense it says german,1509321600,,282,4.1454545454545455

6473609,5,B00L6UI596,"Despite the German-language packaging, all of the episodes are in English! (Which is good or bad depending upon your preference). Additionally, I live in the US and was able to play all of the discs on my PC and blu-ray player without problem. The weakest point of the whole thing is the disc packaging--there isn't much to it, and the discs aren't provided much in the way of protection. Though as a reference for anyone who happened to purchase Warehouse 13's complete series in blu-ray (both were popular SyFy shows) the packaging for Eureka is MUCH better in that it isn't designed to break.",1503878400,,595,4.730769230769231
6473610,5,B00L6UI596,"It was good to sit down and watch the series all over again. The picture quality was excellent and I really enjoyed the fact that I could skip through all the pesky FBI warnings. Don't let the German writing on the box deter you, just pick the English option and enjoy.  You have the option to hit play and watch one show after another or choose the individual show option and pick the show you want to watch.

6473613,5,B00L6UI596,"If you are thinking about buying this set, you probably already like/love the series, so there is no point reviewing the show.  That said, these blu rays are awesome.  I've watched every disk, and they all work great.  The default is in German, however, there is NO effort in selecting the English option.  There are many extras, included gag reels, deleted scenes and commentaries (in English), as well as some very funny shorts such as ""Stay Safe Eureka"", which makes light of building carnivores as pets and other risky home projects.

If you are a fan of the show, I would highly recommend purchasing these Blu Rays.",1499299200,,620,4.757009345794392
6473614,2,B00L6UI596,"Great tv show. I had watched the entire series and I wanted the complete set available. Ufortunately my set is not complete, I have 2 copies of season 4 disc 5 and no copy of season 4 disc 4 (shows 13-16 are missing).",1496880000,,217,4.069767441860465

6473616,5,B00L6UI596,"I just happened to stumble across this German Blu-ray version of Eureka one day killing time on Amazon. I was very excited to see the show had been  ported to HD but sadden to it was only available for Germany. After researching this box set online it seem for some strange reason Universal only released the HD version of Eureka in Germany, but have no fear it will play in your American players. When you fist launch the disc you will be asked which language you want and English is the first choice. Pick English and you'll be watching the Eureka you know and love in lovely HD. The menus are in English too.

Is it the most stunning Blu-ray I have ever seen? Simple answer no. Is it a lot better than the DVD version? Oh yes you can see a big difference. Is it worth buying in Blu-ray? I feel the picture quality over the DVD release worth the added money for this version.

The only issue I've found with this package is the first two episodes on disc one season one; the sound can be a bit in and out. Other than that I had no issues watching this box set.",1496188800,15,1062,4.196078431372549
6473617,5,B00L6UI596,"I loved this show when I could watch it on the SyFy Network but now that it's off Netflix and Hulu I have to buy this I don't regret it...  Amazing quality, came brand new...  The French or German cover dose not brother me hands down a great  TV show now I can watch it when ever I want",1494720000,2,286,3.8135593220338984
6473618,5,B00L6UI596,"If you've never seen Eureka, you're in for a treat. Awesome sci-fi series full of warmth and laughter and silliness. I was thrilled to find this German edition. It's exactly the same as the English edition, but significantly cheaper.",1493856000,,233,5.0
6473619,5,B00L6UI596,What a great show! Blu Ray quality is great and the show is all in English with English menus once the disc is loaded up. I snagged this for $50 somehow here on Amazon and man what a great deal. Took about 2 weeks to ship to US from Germany with no tracking info but hey it made it. Can't wait til my kiddos are a bit older to watch with them.,1493337600,3,343,3.7777777777777777

6473621,3,B00L6UI596,The discs read fine but the cases they came in were all broken when delivered. I had to buy new cases for them and found out most of them have a different amount of discs,1490659200,,170,3.8857142857142857
6473622,5,B00L6UI596,"Although other reviewers have stated it, I thought I would add my review to reinforce the fact that this IS in English, including the special items. I admit it isn't ideal for the text to be in German, but quite frankly I just put in the disks and watch.

I have the full series on DVD in individual disks, but wanted the Blu Ray version since I'm watching them on a 60"" HDTV on a Blu Ray player. So when I saw the price had dropped again, I bought the set - crossing my fingers that I wouldn't have a problem. I'm only on disk 2 of season 1, but I can say that the video is sharp, the audio is excellent, and it is the Eureka I love!

Not sure the reason of the mixed text on the box and the German on the individual disk cases, but it isn't hampering me any!",1489708800,3,760,3.9285714285714284
6473623,3,B00L6UI596,"You should probably make it clear that everything is in german.... Yeah you can select English viewing, but why would I want this on my very English movie display? Also reading closer at the other reviews, that some of the discs often do not work, makes me not even want to try them out (Hence the 3 start mediocre rating). My husband and I will be returning for full refund, and buying the DVD set....in English.",1488931200,4,413,4.447368421052632
6473624,5,B00L6UI596,"Excellent I was  worried about other review about the language problem but they are wrong they are in English as for the quality of picture amazing. I've watch the entire series before this review so no predictions of the quality. If it's no playing on your DVD play FYI these are blu-ray must have a blu-ray player I played mine on my Xbox One no trouble. As for scrambled episodes I only had one out of the entire series that's pretty great I know it can't happen to anybody could be a defect do to packaging or making the DVD it self or the DVD might have a simple smudge from ur finger this happen to everybody.

I hope this clears up some of ur answer about ur purchase of this item",1488067200,2,687,4.196969696969697
6473625,5,B00L6UI596,This arrived super fast and I was hesitant about the whole German stuff (I live in the US). The first screen that pops up is in English asking if you want English French or German. Very pleased with my purchase!,1487548800,2,211,4.3
6473626,5,B00L6UI596,"Don't know why some blu ray series always seem late to appear or never come out in the US.  Don't know what their problem is, but I certainly don't mind them when they come from other countries.  Warehouse 13 goes great with this too.",1487289600,,234,4.295454545454546
6473627,1,B00L6UI596,FAULSE ADVERTISING! THERE IS NOTING IN THE TITLE THAT SAYS NOT IN ENGLISH!!! WAS EXTREMELY EXCITED TO RECEIVE THIS AS A GIFT AND NOT BE ABLE TO WATCH ANY OF IT!!,1486684800,,161,4.225806451612903
6473628,4,B00L6UI596,"I am watching this series for the second time.  It's fantastic.  The cover is almost all German, making me wonder if it was an English version. It is, and I am happy with it.",1486339200,2,174,4.088235294117647
6473629,4,B00L6UI596,"I love these German imports. This is the second complete series box set I've gotten from Amazon within a month. The other being Warehouse 13. I wish they would make more available. We get third rate versions here in the US where the shows have been farmed out to companies with little respect for the source material (Mill Creek, VEI, etc) and spend minimal time and energy putting out their blue ray box sets that look only slightly better than DVD quality. These companies stuff way too many episodes per disc and it shows! I preordered the bluray version of Quantum Leap but I'm not anticipating anything that looks as good as this.",1486339200,11,635,4.628318584070796

6473634,5,B00L6UI596,"Other than the fact that it defaults to German language (this is stated in the sellers description) this is a great set.  You pick your language when you insert each disk, so that takes care of that issue.  A great TV show that can be watched by the whole family.",1484179200,3,263,4.24
6473635,1,B00L6UI596,"Very disappointed! Purchased this as a gift for my husband for Christmas and he was very excited to start watching.  Only the first disc of each season works.  While the episodes are entirely in English, only being able to watch 4 episodes of each season is ridiculous!  Will be returning!!",1482969600,4,290,4.76

6473641,5,B00L6UI596,A perfectly good product. As advertised came in on time and checked the first disc will be game great gift. Writing on pkg in German but has English version. Thanks,1480118400,,164,4.5

Bought the series...yes from germany...and yes there's an English option. On the ps3 it's actually the first screen. Very simple and I'm very happy to see my old friends saving the world...from problems they create! Ha!
Buy it. Enjoy it. Repeat.",1478649600,3,397,4.838235294117647
6473644,5,B00L6UI596,"Very high quality Bluray production.  Background music in creatively mixed in 7.1 surround.  Menu navigation is easy to learn, and somewhat better than most US releases.  You can actually skip past the copyright warnings.
I watch the episodes in English and German, and switch the subtitles to German and English as a way to learn more German.  One could do the same for learning French with this series.",1477353600,,404,4.897058823529412
6473645,5,B00L6UI596,"This review is primarily for the Blu-ray set, not the content, which is one of my favorite TV series. I ordered this off Amazon (Germany) for substantially less, even with customs and exchange. I already had most of the seasons on DVD, but Eureka is a series worth upgrading to Blu-ray. Image quality is mostly superior to the DVDs, with less apparent ""grain"". Of note, all the packaging and notes is in German, but the Blu-rays can be watched in either English, German or French audio and subtitles. The Blu-ray menus use icons rather than text, since it's intended for the European market and would need to be multi-lingual. The disks are also region-free and will play all the extra bonus content. If you are a devoted Eureka fan, don't hesitate to buy this.",1476403200,,761,4.686567164179104
6473646,4,B00L6UI596,I have the whole series and didn't spend $300 on this ! Great show and highly recommended. Price is a tipoff and should be lowered,1476144000,,130,4.24

6473654,5,B00L6UI596,"Awesome. So glad I bought it.
First of all, great show and I had to buy it since Netflix took it off a bit back when they used to have all episodes available. As other people have said, for anyone who is wondering....

This is in fact a German release Blu-ray... it has NOT been released on Blu-ray in the US (go figure, jerks). BUT... this does in fact have no region issues so rest assured you can play in in a US Blu-ray player no problem and you can hear it in English and the menu can be in English, so other than the fact that the box has some German on it, there's no difference. The quality is beautiful and it was wayyyy cheaper than buying the DVD version in US.",1469145600,,672,4.052631578947368
6473655,5,B00L6UI596,"SYFI had a great thing going for awhile. They had great scifi shows on the air with SG1, Atlantis and this show.  All could be watched by the family.  The violence was not graphic or ""realistic"" nor was the language. EUREKA was fun to watch, all the episodes were well acted and had great storylines and the actors did a superb job.  This was a very good show that did not have PC nonsense but was there to just have fun and show fans some great eps.  Naturally, SYFY cancels it.  Still mad about it.",1468713600,5,500,4.221052631578948

6473659,5,B00L6UI596,"I just received these & I tested each disc. They play beautifully. The price was the best I've found in Blu-Ray, $103.98 in total. $99.99 + $3.99 shipping.

It arrived early and in perfect condition.

There are 5 cases with each of the 5 seasons in their own case unlike certain Eureka DVD sets which split a couple of the seasons in two so you'd get 7 cases because season 3 is 3.0 & 3.5 as is the 4th season it's 4.0 & 4.5 so I like that the set I have is Blu-Ray, not DVD for the quality and two less cases to take up less room on my already overflowing collection. (Some DVD sets have condensed the seasons into 5 cases with the complete episodes)

The box has German writing, which I can read, but even so if you can't, you're not missing anything.

The discs offer up three languages, the first is English so all you do it hit select and it's just like any other English language Eureka set, the language is English just as it was aired originally.

At the time of this review the product from this seller is now unavailable. I apparently got the last one but if they get more in stock I recommend this product with this seller. musicpassion

6473672,4,B00L6UI596,"Upon discovering the answer to a now-legendary problem, Archimedes famously yelled ""Eureka!"" (""I have found it!""), jumped out of his bath, and ran naked through the streets.

So ""Eureka"" seems like an appropriate name for the SyFy Channel's quirky, well-written sci-fi series, all about a tiny town that brims over with geniuses and scientific breakthroughs. While it has the usual ups and downs of any long-running series, ""Eureka: The Complete Series"" is a charmingly eccentric little show that centers on the life of an ordinary law-forcement officer who just happens to live in a town full of oddball geniuses.

While dragging his delinquent daughter back to L.A., Marshal Jack Carter (Colin Ferguson) accidentally crashes the car. The only nearby place is the picture-perfect small-town of Eureka. But Jack starts to suspect that Eureka is a little odd -- and his suspicions are confirmed when a tachyon accelerator starts ripping the seams out of the universe.

It turns out that Eureka is a town filled with geniuses, making groundbreaking scientific discoveries. After the local sheriff suffers a nasty accident, D.O.D. representative Allison Blake (Salli Richardson-Whitfield) makes Jack the new sheriff of Eureka. Now he has a new job, a ""smart house"" in an old nuclear bunker, and trigger-happy deputy Jo Lupo (Erica Cerra) who isn't initially very happy to be working with him.

But life in Eureka is never peaceful, with countless scientific disasters threatening its people -- and occasionally the whole world -- and usually Sheriff Carter stumbles across some crimes and mishaps that just don't seem to make sense. Some of them are more than mere technical problems: a mysterious Artifact that predates the universe, a boy with strange powers derived from said Artifact, a time jump that throws their lives out of balance by altering the past, a trip to Titan that goes horribly, horribly wrong, and the ever-present threat of government involvement.

""Eureka: The Complete Series"" is a nearly ideal combination of gentle comedy and wild sci-fi, with the idea that leading experts in every scientific field imaginable (example: molecular gastronomy) have come to work in Eureka, in order to fully explore their fields. Unfortunately, most of these experts aren't very good at the ""being sensible"" part of their job. So when there's lots of genius and not enough common sense... well, let's just say Carter's everyman sensibility is required.

And the writers sprinkle it with funny scenarios (the whole town gets brainwashed into acting out the songs they listen to), bizarre problems (people are turned to stone) and funny dialogue (""I'm Sheriff Carter! I'm gonna save the day with my everyman logic, hahaha!""), which keep things from ever getting too serious. But there are moments of poignancy as well, such as the truly tragic loss of Henry Deacon's first love, or the whole arc where the space crew is trapped in a virtual world that seems to have been set up to make them violently uncomfortable.

The biggest problem is that sometimes it feels like important plot threads are simply abandoned. The mysterious Artifact is held up as a cosmically inexplicable object that could change the way we see the universe... but it just sort of tapered off and was forgotten. And Allison's ex-husband was eventually written out because the writers apparently couldn't figure out what to do with him.

A lot of the show's charm comes from the talented cast -- Ferguson is particularly charming and slightly goofy as a guy so normal that he almost seems like a cliche. However, Carter is a lot smarter than he seems, and has a knack for figuring out the key to fixing these technical disasters. We also have a bunch of excellent actors like Cerra, Richardson-Whitfield, Ed Quinn, Niall Matter, Joe Morton and Neil Grayston. They play everything from nerds who push all the wrong buttons to super-genius mechanics, gun-toting sidekicks to charming bad-boys. Even the supporting cast is delightful, like Matt Frewer as an insane Aussie vet and Chris Gauthier as a feisty gay restauranteur.

Despite some dropped plot threads, ""Eureka: The Complete Series"" mixes equal measures of dramedy and sci-fi -- where else can you find rage zombies, Egyptian bugs and brainwashing music? Clever, charming and well-written.",1458086400,2,4319,5.141025641025641

6473676,5,B00L6UI596,"I loved this series and missed the release of the DVD version, so I was really happy to find this region free BluRay edition. It is from Germany and comes with a choice not only audio tracks in your choice of English, French, and German, but also visual subtitles that can be selected separately from the audio, that is you can watch with English audio but have subtitles in German or French or English (or none at all). And it plays great on my Sony US BluRay DVD player.

Comes as a set of 18 disks with bonus materials.  If you would like a great series packaged in a great set, buy this one!

Note that this takes a long while for delivery (made it two days after its latest predicted arrival) as it is sold by a third party and is shipped from Germany.",1455148800,4,757,4.206896551724138

There doesn't seem to be any benefit to the box set other than the box. It is an international box set so it does come with other languages, which I don't speak.
