6246001,5,B00I0CIQ6K,"Sweat poured off of me even doing this for the first time today!  I did the whole thing and I think it was about 60 minutes, had to drink water to make it through though!  I definitely have a ways to go before I can completely follow, however I kept moving and practice makes perfect...Go Zumba!",1427328000,3,295,4.25
6246002,5,B00I0CIQ6K,"Exactly what I was looking for.  The program runs in segments so you can do as many or as few routines as you  want.
Great instruction and you can opt for verbal cues throughout the routine.",1426550400,5,190,4.25

8637973,4,B00I0CIQ6K,"I had read several online reviews that this was the best DVD in the series and I can see why. The cues were great for beginner like me, and, the songs were upbeat. It seemed less like a workout and more like I was dancing so the time flew by.",1466812800,,242,3.86

8637975,2,B00I0CIQ6K,"Very difficult. Cass does not cue well, the two men are better. Definitely high impact. I guess that it's mainly hip-hop in influence and not true Zuma, that is  aerobics to latin music. I miss the classic Zumba. Great workout if you can stand it.",1450310400,,247,4.488888888888889

8637978,1,B00I0CIQ6K,"I LOVE Zumba, it's fun, effective, energizing. A few years ago I lost 30 lbs using Zumba, and have Zumba'd my way thru three programs, so I'm no neophyte. And I have some dance experience. But this routine was a serious disappointment in every way. I've started doing HIIT training to lose those next pesky hard-to-lose pounds, so I was excited to see Zumba with 'Cardio Burst'. If you're already in shape, have some dance experience, and can handle consistent high-impact, give this a try. You may like it. But if you aren't all those things, here's the problem:
-the 'how to' segment doesn't include ANY of the difficult dance choreography. Nada. Leaves you at a loss to actually do the steps.
-the cues can be confusing, and there's no adaptation or alternative demonstrated.  HIIT training is a great way to burn calories, even when you're beginning a work-out program. What kept me going at the beginning was the encouragement, the 'just get in and dance' attitude. I was never discouraged, because someone would demo a simpler or low impact step. And they'd encourage you to work at it
till you could do more, increasing your endurance and ability. Not this workout.
-the pace is frenetic rather than intense. It's difficult to do the choreography correctly with good form at the pace of some segments. Add the lack of mods and it's just frustrating.
-and last and least: the outfits. Ugh! Bleh. Four outta five are wearing droopy drawers that look like rejects from an MC Hammer video. No, every video doesn't new slash and layer Zumba style. But poor Cass' crotch is sagging down to her knees, flopping around like there's something stored in it. (Can't miss it -half the time Cass is leading the camera is focused on her pants crotch like it has twin billing!) On top of that the women are wearing clunky workout/combat boots that are just silly. Save your money - maybe the next program will be better. And there's always classic Zumba!",1437350400,8,1946,4.740412979351032
