8723716,5,B0117N9J8C,"Great Blu-ray of one of SHINee's biggest concerts! It would've been great to have actually been there but I'm from America LOL This concert was actually broadcasted in Japan but they cut out like half the concert so this is better to have: You get the whole concert on one disc and by the end, you'll be crying tears of joy because they performed that amazing of a show. Their solo stages are amazing especially Onew, Key and Taemin! The concert is about 3 and half hours long and the bonus disc is about half an hour of backstage footage from Tokyo Dome and extra footage from their hall/arena tour. The photobook is a great addition and the photos are fantastic!

Keep in mind, this is a limited edition set and the other editions may or may not contain a photobook and bonus disc. Also, be sure to check that your Blu-ray player is able to play this region code's discs.",1439078400,,873,4.422360248447205
