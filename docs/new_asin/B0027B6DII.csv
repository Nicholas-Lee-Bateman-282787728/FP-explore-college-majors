Mr. Smiley and company really captured the mission of the trip, the history of the mission and the oh so lively debates. I plan on buying a copy for all of the strong, good, black men in my life. They should know about this DVD",1243296000,3,317,4.129032258064516
3863037,5,B0027B6DII,"I stumbled on ""Stand"" by chance.  I was on the phone with my sister who was watching a cable health program that I could not get.  I immediately hung-up the phone and called my cable station.  As a result of adding the health channel, I received several other stations including TVOne.  Later that evening I'm surfing the channels and stopped when I saw Tavis Smiley on a bus with Cornel West and Michael Eric Dyson. I was instantly pulled in.

What an experience! I felt like I was an invisible passenger on this amazing journey.  I was given a unique view into the bond that unites these black men. I went through so many emotions during this bus trip.  I laughed, cried, and got a little hungry by all that soul food. I was in awe by the memories, the depth of the discussions, and the spirit reaching music.  I did not want the trip to end.  I got off the bus energized, proud, and ready.",1243296000,7,892,4.325301204819277

8354386,5,B0027B6DII,"I enjoyed this when I saw it on TV and knew I had to get DVD. As God would have it, I have been able to share this DVD with several young men that I work with who are just developing a foundation for living.  I enjoyed how everyone added a little something to the conversation - without being antagonistic.
