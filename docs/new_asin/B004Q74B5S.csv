8437976,5,B004Q74B5S,"I purchased Seasons 8, 9 and 10 for my 85 year old mother.  She started doing these exercises in March of 2011 and was trying to remember to record them on VHS every day.  Having these DVD's allows her to do these exercises on her own schedule and she's really into them.  She says she feels better since she started.  She still lives on her own and access to these exercises gives her a sense of control over her well being. Following these exercises is great for anyone who is more comfortable for someone who feels safer sitting down, yet still moving.",1308528000,13,555,4.411764705882353
