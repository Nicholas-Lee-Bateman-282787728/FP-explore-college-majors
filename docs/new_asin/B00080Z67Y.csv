2255812,2,B00080Z67Y,"As a baker and former FoodTV competitor, I couldn't stop rolling my eyes during this film.  It was just poorly executed.  Their competition ""showpieces"" were pitiful, and pretending to almost drop them when they were obviously not even heavy was lame.  Also, if there was a baking contest that paid a top prize of $250,000 and they advertised it on TV as open to any chef, there would be a LOT more than 8 teams show up!  Oh yes, and what channel would air a two-day baking competition live?  This could have been a cute movie if they'd taken the time to be more realistic with the details.",1170547200,10,590,4.425925925925926
2255813,5,B00080Z67Y,"This was a wonderful story telling about the hard-working Italian immigrants that started their businesses in New York.  Their determination, long hours, and love of family represent the values those immigrants brought to America.

If you love to cook & have an Italian heritage, you'll enjoy this film.",1142985600,9,303,5.291666666666667
2255814,4,B00080Z67Y,"This was a very enjoyable film to set and watch.  You know what is going to take place in any given moment, but you can relax and enjoy and feel good about it.  Something to set down and unwind to.  By today's standards it is a family film.  Well worth a look at.",1142812800,19,263,3.9056603773584904

2255819,5,B00080Z67Y,"I have watched this a couple of times as a television broadcast and can now watch whenever I want. This is typical Hallmark romance where boy and girl can't stand each other, but by the time credits roll around everyone is together. Family fare that is very enjoyable.",1423440000,,268,4.604166666666667

2255828,4,B00080Z67Y,"I'm very familiar with 187th and Arthur Avenue in the Bronx,  in fact my dad grew up on 187th and Belmont (yes, Dion and the Belmonts) right behind Mt. Carmel church. The bakery they used is actually Addeo's bakery which is located across the street from the back doors of the Italian market. They just changed the sign in front. Anyway, the movie isn't to bad, a little sappy, but hey, it's the hallmark channel lol! Nice, easy going story. Brenda Vaccaro is good as Marco's mother. And his rambunctious uncle is a hoot! Every Italian family has AT LEAST, one of these uncles. Lol.",1406505600,,582,4.542857142857143
2255829,5,B00080Z67Y,"The chemistry between the two chefs was sexy - look but don't touch.  Great for all
Would reommend it...but I enjoy Lauren Holly movies - The Town Christmas Forgot is a good movie too.",1391385600,,184,4.411764705882353
2255830,5,B00080Z67Y,"A movie that makes my mouth water seeing the wonderful desserts these characters come up with during a competition.  Boy meets girl, boy gets girl.  All in fun.",1390003200,,160,4.678571428571429

2255835,5,B00080Z67Y,"This movie is soooo New York, everything from the corner bakery to the way people talk. One cannot help but fall in love Marco, the leading man.  Here's a nice Italian boy who loves to bake, so much so he has no time to meet Miss Right.  His desserts are exquisite. One day he approaches a well-known Manhattan chef and together they enter a contest where first prize is $250,000.  The way Marco and Grace team together in the bake-off,  the way Marco plays his cards with her ever-present boyfriend and gains Grace  in the end is something every man should pay attention to.  You will love this movie.",1371686400,,602,4.477064220183486

2255838,5,B00080Z67Y,We choose a five star for this production because of the story line and acting.  We enjoyed the entire movie.  We would recommend anyone looking for a good wholesome movie without any cursing or sex.,1363824000,,199,4.6571428571428575
2255839,5,B00080Z67Y,"I wanted to purchase ""Simply Irresistible"" which stars Sarah Jessica Gehler which movie is about a magical dessert that she created, and got confused by the name of the movie ""Just Desserts.""  However, I truly enjoyed this romantic and funny comedy!",1359331200,2,249,5.073170731707317
2255840,3,B00080Z67Y,"Good movie. Love Lauren Holly.  Not too long.  Great to see a good wholesome movie,
no violence just good fun",1358812800,,109,4.4
2255841,4,B00080Z67Y,"Could have had a little less out of control outbursts from some of the characters, but a pretty good plot.",1358640000,,106,4.35

2255845,3,B00080Z67Y,"It's a cute movie but a little corny at times.  I think it could have been a better movie with a little tweaking of the storyline by making it a little more realistic.  For instance, they could've expanded more on the struggles of working class immigrants, and they could've made the bake-off a little more realistic and not as corny.  This is a stereotypical Hallmark/Lifetime movie.  I watched it through NetFlix initially but decided to purchase it on Amazon.com to have as a part of my DVD collection.

Costas Mandylor, still handsome by today's standards.  I am glad to finally see him in some more A-List movies (i.e. the Saw series) these days.  Although, whoever encourages him to keep doing these Sci-Fi movies, he or she need to find a different direction for his career.  I would love to see him in movies which are higher quality than Hyenas, etc.",1301875200,2,859,4.68
2255846,5,B00080Z67Y,"Just Desserts is a heartwarming story that sparks interest with visuals of desserts and a little true history, too.  There really is a bakery that was bought and sold with a seret chocolate cake recipe.  The cast is great, too!!!!!  I love this movie, and it would make a great Valentine's Day gift for the ladies.  It's better than flowers, and will make the chocolates you give her taste that much better!",1271289600,4,407,4.611111111111111
2255847,5,B00080Z67Y,"Very entertaining and moral.  You don't have to show everything or tell everthing to make a good story. For those who don't like living in the gutter, when it comes to entertainment. Will enjoy, especially if you like deserts & chocolate..",1264204800,3,239,4.829268292682927
2255848,3,B00080Z67Y,"This wasn't a great film, but a sweet one.  I love Costas Mandylor (He was a cop in the TV series 'Picket Fences' along with Lauren Holly) and I think that's probably the only reason I watched it.  It's okay.  It isn't one of those films you want to watch over and over, but it's a decent film.  Costas Mandylor, as always, is gorgeous to look at with his dark good looks and he's a good actor too.",1256860800,2,398,4.064102564102564
2255849,4,B00080Z67Y,"If you are in search of a little light escapism to take your mind off the stress of the day, you won't find a more fun outlet than Just Desserts. The characters are adorable, there's a great love story, and the villains are sometimes laughable.

Will the boy and girl be united? Who planted the chocolate at the competition? Who does she really, really love? You won't lose any sleep pondering the answers to these questions, but you will have a very good time on the way.

There's also enough tension generated with the secondary characters' story to keep the whole family watching this old-fashioned, frothy romance!",1234828800,20,618,4.766355140186916
2255850,5,B00080Z67Y,This movie is upbeat and fun.  I loved it.  More of a woman's movie but my husband enjoyed it too.,1233014400,4,98,3.85

2255852,4,B00080Z67Y,"I fell in love with this movie because it was sweet. If you expect to see a hi-fi dessert baking competition, this is not the movie for you. But if you are looking to pass time and have fun, this movie is perfect. Loved Costas Mandylor and Lauren Holly together...All in all a fun movie.",1220832000,7,287,4.236363636363636
2255853,5,B00080Z67Y,I saw this on Lifetime an fell in love with the cute story and wanted to be able to see it more often and without those pesky commercials.,1191628800,13,138,3.9642857142857144
2255854,4,B00080Z67Y,"The movie was fun and entertaining; however, I received a copy where the background noise in the movie itself was so loud that we had to strain to hear the actors.  I sadly returned the movie because it was too much work listening to it.  I would have liked to keep a copy in my library.",1173312000,,287,4.107142857142857
