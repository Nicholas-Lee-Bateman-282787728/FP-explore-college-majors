8548024,5,B00A7YQYEU,"Canadian actor, screenwriter and director Ryan Ward`s feature film debut which he co-wrote with Canadian screenwriter Matthew Heite, was screened at the 33rd Montral World Film Festival in 2009, was shot on locations in the province of Ontario, Canada and is a Canadian production which was produced by producer Paul Fler. It tells the story about a man with TS named Sonny Johnns who lives with his mother who is in bad relationship and his sister Meryl who is moving out due to her disputes with their mother. Sonny has such a strong degree of vocal tics and physical that it almost overshadows his personality, and in the hopes of becoming better he uses his savings from his disability benefits on a surgery that is said to cure all the tics.

Distinctly and engagingly directed by Canadian filmmaker Ryan Ward, this finely paced fictional tale which is narrated by the main character and mostly from his point of view, draws an involving portrayal of a 24-year-old man with a special gift and his relationship with his mother, sister and a woman named Arielle. While notable for its naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by Canadian cinematographer Chayse Irvin, production design and costume design by production designer and costume designer Deirdra Morris, use of sound and use of light, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about an afflicted and brave man who whilst searching for his true identity and for the first time in his utterly solitary existence gathers up enough confidence to approach and speak to a woman is given a chance to live a ""normal"" life, depicts a dense and empathic study of character and contains a great score by composer Matthew Montour.

This romantic, spiritual, somewhat surreal and heartrending fable from the late 2000s which gets quite far into the mind state of a person with Tourettes Syndrome who is as conflicted by his affliction as he is by his family relations, is impelled and reinforced by its fragmented narrative structure, substantial character development, emotional substance, multiple perspectives, unrestrained characters and the heartfelt acting performances by Ryan Ward and Canadian actresses Shantelle Canzanese, Joann Nordstrom and Rebecca Mcmahon. A dramatic, lyrical and ultimately authentic indie which gained, among numerous other awards, the award for Best Director and Best Actor Ryan Ward at the 6th Wild Rose Independent Film Festival in 2009.",1366329600,3,2461,5.259541984732825
