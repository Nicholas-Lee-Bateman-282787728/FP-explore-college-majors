2103330,5,B0002M5TN4,"My children and i are huge fans of Scooby and we have never seen any of these movies in Australia, great so buy something that they haven't already seen",1201392000,2,152,4.275862068965517
2103331,5,B0002M5TN4,"I can't believe how fun this was!  I watched Scooby Doo and the gang while I was growing up and now my 2 year old daughter has been introduced to them!  This DVD was perfect for the holiday!  In a sea of cutesy childrens holiday programs, i.e. Winnie-the-Pooh, Mickey Mouse and such, this was refreshing, a bit scary but had my daughter laughing, hiding and glued to the screen!  My daughter asks to watch this over and over!",1200009600,2,425,4.410256410256411
2103332,5,B0002M5TN4,Excellent quality DVD. My sons love being able to watch Scooby whenever they want.,1168300800,,82,4.928571428571429
2103333,5,B0002M5TN4,My daughter loves Scooby. My mom sent her this one for Halloween and my grandma bought her the Christmas one for Christmas and she loves it. She owns a few other volumes but she always goes back to those two. I enjoy watching them with her and they remind me of when I use to love watching Scooby!,1168041600,,297,4.137931034482759
2103334,5,B0002M5TN4,The new Scooby Doo adventures are much better than the old ones. They have more comedy and they aren't near as scary for younger kids as the older ones. My five year old son loves the new Scooby Doo way more and he has seen both. This one is a cute DVD - the Christmas one has a great lesson for kids about sharing. The other three adventures are very cool and very imaginative. While in the new adventures some things don't make as much sense as in the old (details like how the monster worked) it's much more fun for the kids!,1165708800,5,528,4.135922330097087
2103335,4,B0002M5TN4,"I grew up watching Scooby and now my 5-year old is doing the same. What a trip it is to sit and watch these with him.  Most are so much more ridiculous than I remember as a kid, but this collection is great! Some unusual episodes with subtle humor (especially the Toy one!). Lots of enjoyment here. However, we got ours at Target for $14.99.",1106784000,24,341,4.246153846153846

Like the other movies in the What's New Scooby Doo Series, it has four episodes that are very cute but the stories move quickly which is good for younger kids who get bored easily.  Two thumbs up for this Scooby Doo!  We were very excited since we saw some of the characters we've seen in other episodes (like the Golden Retriever Chrissy and the Secret Six puppies)...",1324944000,,643,4.723214285714286
2103438,3,B0002M5TN4,"We were a little disappointed by the fact that this got such high reviews and no one bothered to mention that these were repeats.  We thought this would be like some of the other dvd's ie: Mexico, Vampire, Alien invaders, Loch Ness Monster.  Our daughters still enjoyed watching them but kept saying,""Not a new show.""  But it still hasn't stopped them from watching it.  I am just disappointed that we were ripped off and bought a dvd with repeat shows....well buyer beware!!!!  Otherwise I would have given it a 5 star as per the kids.",1323129600,11,536,4.6
