3803494,5,B001URA5YI,"I rented this dvd for a nude shot of Jessica Biel....ok I'm a pervert. But a older Lisa Kudrow (gorgeous) did a awesome job and the rest of the cast was great!! But to be honest, Jessica was the star, naked or not, she stoled the show, this woman is a really good actress. Someday I think that Scarlett Johansson and Jessica should play sisters, cause they look so much alike. If you liked the movie ""Exotica"", get this one.  Enjoy!!!",1244505600,12,434,4.3580246913580245
3803495,4,B001URA5YI,"I bought this film simply becuase of my faith in the cast, and I am very glad I did.  This film is unlike most any other as it deals with a topic that most films avoid...that of desperation.  The film follows the lives of four characters all in the throws of desperation.  The film was beautifully acted, well written, and had a ton of really good shots...I feel the director did over use the blue filter ( I am assuming to be kitsch with the title) but this does not distract too much from the overall film.  While not a new book...or even a new chapter, this film does succeed in taking the viewer to the depths of the dire straits of the characters.  I enjoyed it very much and would suggest it to any film lover who wants to see a flick...just outside of feel good.",1244505600,3,769,4.204081632653061
3803496,2,B001URA5YI,"Problem with Powder Blue is that it is calculated, dishonest stack of worn Hollywood cliche stories of people down on their luck that was multiplied times six and stories were chopped and mixed. Which made each of the character 6 times less likely to develop in any believable way. Just ask yourself how interesting is a stripper with a heart of gold and a son in coma looking for her soul-mate to take her to Paris? A Catholic priest that lost his wife in car accident that is trying to pay a transvestite prostitute a lot of money to kill him? Shy mortician that plays with puppets and never had a girlfriend? A good-looking waitress that is just there where you need her to refill your coffee cup and take you home to refill your heart with hope? And a lost puppy? And some stripping thrown in for a good measure?
But even worse than all those cliches is clumsy way they are mixed together. It is predictable to the gills and at the end some of the ridiculous resolution leave you in disbelief thinking ""how exactly was I suckered into watching this load of crap"". Well you do not have to be - just ignore this movie and get some Robert Altman instead if you want chop-suey type of story of several lonely people.",1243900800,7,1216,4.408888888888889
3803497,4,B001URA5YI,"This is a desperate quest on several levels that is very real for these times.

Ray Liotta portrays a dying man, who - after 25 years in prison - attempts to connect with a daughter he has never met in this powerful drama of a desperate journey to make things right, before it's too late. His daughter (expertly played by Jessica Biel) is a ""performer"" in a gentleman's club and he pretends to be just another customer to talk with her.

With Lisa Kudrow and Forest Whitaker, the major characters are flawed and troubled, but have not given up hope to achieve something - anything - that can make life pleasant (tolerable?) for at least a short period of time, though they are stretched to the limit due to a battering from the wicked tsunami of daily living.",1243382400,10,759,4.492753623188406
3803498,3,B001URA5YI,"Another reviewer here already summed up this piece best...""an over-written, over-wrought, hysterically over-dramatic film..."". But aside from that, I want to see anything these days that has Kristofferson and Swayze in it. Unfortunately, Kris has one minute of screen time, and even as awesome (and un-recognizable) as Swayze was, he only gets a few minutes.

There are inevitable comparisons here to the Air I Breathe and Crash, right down to the carbon copy of Forest's character, that corny snow-in-LA ending and the score. But I digress.

The Blu quality is average throughout. The picture strains in so many areas that it detracts from the scene at times. The DTS gets used mainly in the music scenes and did sound great. The special features contain a making-of, a picture gallery and a commentary. The documentary contains some nice logistical information about production and gives some decent insight into what this crew was trying to do.

The quality of the product is not great, which leads into the obvious need to dissect the film. Maybe read the other review here that portrays more about humanity than the film, then decide if you wish to see a Jessica Biel film representing those feelings. This is an ensemble cast, but she is front and center trying to carry her first film as the primary. Not a recommendation for Blu, and yes I see the irony, this being as the director stated: a ""color of emotion"" (blue) kind of film. Maybe a rental if you feel like watching a film similar to the other films I listed.",1243123200,6,1524,4.809160305343512
3803499,1,B001URA5YI,"...because the director of this junk was from there.

I love Whitaker and Liotta (and Jessica Biel nude) as much as any fan of film, but this was terrible. The writing is incredibly awful. The dialogue is funny enough, though, of course, it's not a comedy. The overacting by Biel is horrendous, and also funny. The young actor with the name of Qwerty (possibly the worst, and laziest, character name ever concocted) in the film is also good. It might be enjoyable to some inebriated types due to Biel's nudity, the terrible writing and Liotta's final hilarious scene involving the actor and young boy giggling with a kite in tow in (would you believe it) a beach in heaven!",1242604800,10,673,4.65546218487395
3803500,4,B001URA5YI,"Everyone has their problems. This we are constantly reminded of in Timothy Linh Bui's latest film, Powder Blue. Linh Bui, who both wrote and directed this film, is a newcomer to mainstream film, having previously directed one feature-length film, 2001's Green Dragon.

Powder Blue is the story of a pivotal week in the life of four individuals struggling to keep their lives together. Charlie (Forest Whitaker) is an ex-priest battling suicidal tendencies due to the anguish of losing his wife. Jack (Ray Liotta) is a recently released hit man who recently found out about the cancer in his body. Qwerty (Eddie Redmayne) is an awkward, twenty-something mortician whose asthma acts up when he tries to talk to women. And Rose Johnny (Jessica Biel) is a stripper trying to pay the medical bills of her comatose son. Each is hurting immensely. Each is looking for some glimmer of hope.

This is a strange film in terms of the press that it has been getting. The overwhelming majority of articles and news surrounding this project have narrowly focused on the fact that Jessica Biel has a small handful of topless scenes. In fact, one online site boldly proclaims, ""this film is always going to be known for one thing -- Jessica Biel was topless in it."" Many other sites which have written pieces on this movie have uniformly dubbed Powder Blue ""the Jessica Biel Stripper Movie."" Commentary on the hyper-sexualized yet stuck in a 15-year-old boy's body nature of American culture aside, this film is much more than a stripper movie and will hopefully be remembered as a good piece of art, rather than the fact that one of the actors shows some skin.

The core of this film is the nature of love. What is love? How do we find it? What happens when we lose it? Everyone has their problems, but no one should have to face them alone. The characters understand this and each has a deep sense of the need for relationships, they just don't quite know how to pursue real and lasting love. Instead, their pursuit is initially selfish, built on what they themselves can get out of feeling loved and fulfilled in hopes that their problems will all go away. So Qwerty attends functions in hopes of getting a date. Jack attempts to restore and build a relationship with his daughter out of the guilt of never being there for her. Rose Johnny throws herself at men looking for someone to not only financially provide for her and her son, but also to treat her and love her as a woman rather than a piece of meat on a stage. And Charlie, the most desperate of the lot, cries out for help to anyone he can find, propositioning them to end his life for him in exchange for $50,000.

Each must discover, however, that honest love can only be so if both parties give of themselves to each other. Each of these characters must be willing to be vulnerable, to let others see the hurt and struggles that they are going through, and then be willing to let others help them and love them in ways that they never imagined anyone could. But again, this is a two-way street, and they must also be willing to do the same for others, allowing them to be vulnerable as well and to work with them through the pains and trials of life. It's only after each of the characters realize this that they are able to see glimmers of hope and redemption in their otherwise shattered lives.

Powder Blue is a fascinating film. Linh Bui has captured something very real and true about life, a feat which most of Hollywood either avoids or fails miserably at. He shows that life isn't a fairytale, hope doesn't come easily, and, again, everyone has problems. However, he also shows that there is true love out there, that there is hope and redemption even if such comes through the pain and hardships that each of us face in life, if we will only allow others in and allow others to help us through whatever it is we are going through, and be willing to do the same when the chance presents itself.

It is this writer's hope that this is what Powder Blue will be remembered for.",1240617600,113,4033,4.555862068965517

3803561,4,B001URA5YI,"This is one of those films inspired by Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" where lost souls who trod the same ground seemingly unconnected except for their sense of loneliness, despair, and heartache.  They are looking for redemption and closure to their crises and in unexpected ways they find it.  Nothing truly original here but the characters are meticulously drawn by director-scenarist Timothy Linh Bui and expertly performed by a first rate ensemble cast.  Though Jessica Biel plays an exotic dancer it is incidental to her role as grieving mother to a comatose young son and Biel has never been better.  I can't say enough about Ray Liotta who after ""Goodfellas"" seemed destined for mainstream success but seems inclined to independent fare like this.  Again he impresses as a terminally ill ex-con trying to tie up the loose ends of his life before time runs out. Ditto, Forest Whitaker as a defrocked priest grieving the loss of his wife.

Forrest Whitaker is always powerful as love lost soul who can not convince anyone to put him out of his misery . Jessica Biel is more than just a hot body. I was not familiar with Eddie Redmayne before but he was compelling as the shy mortician who fainted when he talked to a strange girl but made a connection with Biel's character. Patrick Swayze was a surprise in an out of type role. Ray Liotta did his usual lost boy/man but he is much better when he is bad. Kris Kristofferson and Lisa Kudrow were underutilized but they were supporting roles.

3803576,4,B001URA5YI,"Initially the film is a bit on the dark side - you think it's going to end that way as well - if only because, well, life IS dark sometimes and movies often  reiterate that and or emphasize it.  Each person/character is really good in this film whether they have a large or small role - Patrick Swayze has a small role - but he is awesome as a sleazy night club owner - I still can't believe he died of cancer -that man looked so damn healthy but I digress.  Jessica Biel - well who can complain, I think she's incredibly gorgeous and hot oh and duh..CAN act.  Outwardly she projects that sexy tough girl but inwardly she has this incredible purity/innocence that you just want to reach out and touch.  Forrest Whittaker is awesome as a grief ridden man trying to end his pain only to find others even more in pain.  Ray Liotta usually sleazes me out but he's amazing in this - his integrity, sadness and love shine through and in the end pull a lot of the story to the positive level.  And I've always like Lisa Kudrow - probably because I can relate to her - she compliments Forest Whittaker's character with her sense of hope and determination to be happy.  Last but not least I really like this actor - Eddie Redmayne I first saw him in some English movies and find he has such a quiet intensity to him that makes his rather slight (but tall) appearance sexy.  I think he really compliments Jessica's character with his outward and not just inward sweetness - he helps her get back to the place she was born to be in - which is in love and happy.  At the end of it? As I'm lying on my bed - heating pad crunched under my belly, I silently pray in my head that this will not be a bad ending.  Not just because I'm sick of crappy and depressing endings in movies but because this movie really made you believe in these people - relate to them and come to care for them and you wanted them to have a happy ending.

So, my curiosity was piqued--that's why I bought it. This film has such a really excellent cast. So many actors that I really like. And the quality of the acting, by everyone, was great. But, the content was TERRIBLE. I mean, really bad. Not as bad as Southland, but really bad, none the less. How did these magnificent actors align to work in such a  bad, bad movie? One star is I hate it. Two stars for I don't like it. So because the acting was good, this product gets 2 stars. But wow, really bad. Maybe seeing JESSICA BEIL POLE DANCING AND TOPLESS (not unimpressive on both counts, admittedly) is what drives these many positive reviews.

No it was a good journey through the lives of believable people.  It is a slower paced movie and the characters do live dark lives (not for kids) but that all was fine for me.

3803584,2,B001URA5YI,"The film has a good cast, but there's not much for Liotta, Whitaker, and Biel to grab. The actors do the best they can, but many scenes fall flat as contrived or emotionally overwrought. Whitaker and Liotta fare the best, letting small facial muscles register as other characters reveal their deepest motivations by telling and not showing, a fault of script and not their acting. ""Just promise me one thing,"" Biel asks her soon-to-be-lover, ""that tomorrow everything will be alright.""  Scenes of Liotta and of Whitaker almost save the movie - but only almost. There are minor details that add to the miss: siderails on a hospital bed not up, a child lying on his back in scene after scene with no concern for bedsores, Liotta slipping into a hospital and checking wristbands - with no interference from nurses - until he finds his grandson, a painfully improbable attempt at seducing a sincere physician - and that's just in the hospital. I could also mention a suicide scene with no consequences for the character providing the firearm, an unbelievable and ambiguous prostitution set-up in the night-club, Swayze's vaguely threatening swagger replacing any development of his slimy character. Biel's dancing is stunning, showing athleticism and and commitment and stunning curves - but her frenzied volatility in other scenes detracts. In a small part, Lisa Kudrow is very effective at underplaying the pathos of her situation, and is one of the bright spots.

Besides, even mentioning the smallest of things that happens in the storyline loses the brilliant and powerful effect the writers are definitely going for here.

Seriously, this is the kind of movie you need to just WATCH all the way through and figure out how all the loose storylines and characters manage to tie everything together at the very end. Some *amazingly* shocking twists are guaranteed to win you over by the end though.

You see, the story focuses on a few different circumstances, so you have to put the pieces together by watching it carefully.  This is why I can't explain the storyline in detail.  Doing so would ruin it completely.

The woman who plays the lead role is such a terrific and talented actress. She nails her performance from every single emotion she displays until the very end. A wonderful job in her performance. I'd like to see more of her in future films. She's THAT good I believe.  The characters she communicates with will probably keep you guessing what their reason is for constantly talking to her.

The other (perhaps less interesting and less mentioned) storyline focuses on Forest Whitaker's performance, which again proves why he's loved by so many fans.

3803596,3,B001URA5YI,"There's Crash, then there's Powder Blue. Both films feature multiple intertwining characters in Los Angeles, but one won the best picture Oscar, while the other was released straight to video.

There is Magnolia--then there's Powder Blue. One has multiple quirky characters and a hail of frogs, while the other has characters with multiple quirks, and a powder blue snowstorm that blankets Los Angeles.

There's Flashdance--then there's Powder Blue. One has exotic dancers performing artistically choreographed dances, while the other has a dancer with an even more unbelievable and convoluted back-story performing artistically choreographed dances.

There's Being John Malkovich--then there's Powder Blue. One has a main character whose passion is performing with marionettes while the other has a Mortician with Asthma whose passion is performing with marionettes.

There is The Crying Game--then there's Powder Blue. One has Forest Whitaker involved with someone who is kind of a drag while the other has Forest Whitaker as a defrocked priest who left the church to get married but is now despondent over his young bride's untimely passing.

There is Art--then there's artifice.

So, you can see the problem for director Timothy Linh Bui: He has overloaded his film with so many overused clich&eacute;s and symbols that it ceases to have any meaning whatsoever. He has thrown in everything but the kitchen sink.

I can't in any way shape or form say that this was a successful film, and yet I found it vastly entertaining, if only because it boggled my mind, how far from the path it strayed. I will admit that I enjoyed watching it, but I was forced to judge it harshly.

Jessica Biel looked good and was amazing as the exotic dancer. Her acting wasn't so bad, considering what she had to work with. But not only did she have a father who had just been released from prison after 25 years, she also had a child who was in a coma. On top of that, she has a romance with a mortician named Qwerty Doolittle (the laziest name for a character ever written), who is also loaded down with three too many quirks himself: He has asthma, he plays with puppets, and his mortuary is in foreclosure.

I could go on, but I'm sure you get the picture.

Things I liked though were the chemistry between Whitaker's defrocked priest and Lisa Kudrow's friendly waitress, always ready with a cup of coffee and a slice of pie.

In Savage Grace, Eddie Redmayne was fantastic as the criminally insane Antony Baekeland; but he gave almost as good a performance here.

Alejandro Romero gave good attitude, yet his character was given short shrift. More a symbol than a person. He must have asked himself, just like Burt Reynolds 'playing' a bad actor on The Twilight Zone: What's my motivation?

Ray Liotta was great as the ex hit man/father trying to 'reconnect' with his daughter after a 25-year stint in the pen, but he was sabotaged at every turn. Case in point, he was given full body tattoos, but they were totally wrong for his character. They looked like they'd  been chosen by the makeup `artiste' instead of something a prisoner would choose for himself.

Patrick Swayze as Velvet Larry was amazing as he was terminally ill, yet he still gave a very strong performance. This may have been Swayze's swan song, his last ever film role. May he rest in peace.

3803603,4,B001URA5YI,"Writer/Director Timothy Linh Bui, in the 'Making Of' Special Feature for ""Powder Blue"", explains that he intended to tell an 'L.A.' story, of people out of the mainstream, living in the darker corners, and he succeeds, but in choosing this path, his visions of love, redemption, and hope may seem more depressing than inspirational, and the film won't please some viewers. Add to this the publicity value of seeing Jessica Biel strip (she does have a topless scene), and Patrick Swayze, in his last big screen appearance (in a supporting role), which have overshadowed the story, itself, and you have a worthy, if moody film, that really never had the chance it deserved to stand on it's own merits.

The film consists of multiple love stories, but each of the loves has been crushed, leaving a void. Convict Ray Liotta, released from prison after 25 years, with terminal cancer, is rewarded by the mob boss he took the rap for (Kris Kristofferson), but his wife is long dead, and she had told their daughter (Jessica Biel) he'd died, years before. Biel's young son is in an irreversable coma, and she is forced to work as a stripper for sleazy club owner Patrick Swayze, to pay for the hospital expenses. Her only joy is her dog...who runs away, and is hit by the car of a young, guileless mortician (Eddie Redmayne). He has spent his entire life helping others, only to discover his father had only left him debts, and he is about to lose everything. And in the major plotline, an ex-priest (Forest Whitaker), whose wife was killed on their wedding day, has decided God is punishing him for leaving His service...and as his faith prevents him from committing suicide, he is searching for somebody to kill him, and put him out of his grief...

Not the most cheerful of scenarios, for anyone in this group!

The stories are all involving, but dark, and the resolutions are not all simple and upbeat. Healing, Linh Bui points out, is never simple, and is an ongoing process, often moving in directions you wouldn't anticipate.

The cast is uniformly excellent, particularly Whitaker, whose performance is Oscar-worthy, and Liotta, in one of his most subdued portrayals in recent years. Watch for Lisa Kudrow, in a supporting role, as well; she is a beacon of happiness amidst all the gloom!

Her character's story is sad and troubling. But, she is very convincing as Rose Johnny. An unexpected chain of events will take place and it could change her life or not.

In essence, it's 5 love stories rolled into one...intertwined by love in the darkest and most faithful places.  ""Powder Blue"", a hidden gem of a movie, is best defined by the scene where Forester Whittaker (unbelievable performance), is before the altar...on his knees...tears running from his eyes...looking skyward and saying, ""God, why are you doing this to me?  My only sin is love.""

I need not write much more.  This one gets a solid 5 stars and I don't want to taint the effect of the evolving ballad of five lives...all portrayed by powerful acting performances by Forest Whittaker, Ray Liotta, Jessica Biel, Eddie Redmayne and Lisa Kudrow.

You will discover a new millennium look at ""loneliness"".  Unlike, but very much like, the romantic films of the 50's, this flick transplants love into today's crazy world...it's about hope, family, desire, frustration, desperation and finality.

If you have a heart, this film will empty your tear ducts...GUARANTEED.  There's a little bit of all of us in it...and I'm not sure why it is such a sleeper...unknown...unless I missed something in passing.

I have rather mixed feelings about this picture; there are some good things about it but there are other qualities about it that make this a ""B"" movie at best. The casting isn't bad but the acting itself isn't always so convincing. You can look, however, for a fine performance by Forest Whitaker as Charlie; and Patrick Swayze does a great job of playing Velvet Larry despite Patrick's own very serious health problems in real life. The cinematography was good enough and the choreography was OK; but by the end of the picture I just felt that there should have been more substance. It just plain lay flat even though I knew they tried their best.

When the action starts, we meet four people who have troubled lives, to say the least. Jessica Biel plays Rose Johnny, a stripper who's also a single mom--with her only child in a vegetative coma for the last three months. It's pitiful to watch Biel praying and hoping against hope that her son will recover; her character is clearly in excruciating pain. It doesn't help, either, when her box at the strip club, Velvet Larry, wants her to work on Christmas Eve when Rose wants to be with her comatose son and pray for him. At the same time, a man with terminal cancer mysteriously enters Rose Johnny's life with two airline tickets to anywhere in the world and more. Because this man, Jack Doheny (Ray Liotta) doesn't reveal his identity to Rose, she becomes mistrustful of him and there's quite a confrontation brewing as the movie progresses. Rose's life is also somewhat complicated by another person entering her life; although he goes by the name Cory, Qwerty Doolittle (Eddie Redmayne), a shy mortician with a lot of heart but in desperate need of self-esteem, becomes Rose's friend and more after he hits Rose's dog with his car by accident and returns the dog to Rose.

There's still yet another plot, this own a bit more interesting. Charlie (Forest Whitaker) is in desperation to end his life after an auto accident which took his new bride and all his happiness. Charlie pathetically runs around asking people, including Cory and a cross dressing prostitute, to kill him with his gun. Charlie even offers $50,000 in cash if they will kill him and put him out of his misery! Charlie figures with his suicide note the person who kills him won't ever be caught by the cops.

Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere. Who is Jack Doheny and why does he get involved in Rose Johnny's life? Will Rose and Qwerty be able to get over their insecurities to have a meaningful, loving relationship? What happens to Rose's son--does he get better and if so how might this change Rose's life? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!

Too bad that Powder Blue is just so average. I'm sorry, folks; but this film is like drinking flat soda. It tries, oh, how it tries, to be a keeper and make a meaningful statement about life, love, redemption and more. It just didn't cut it for me; most (but not all) of the acting just wasn't convincing. If you do like the themes covered in the film, then you should try it out; but please don't expect too much!",1248393600,3,3296,4.609880749574105
3803619,1,B001URA5YI,"It's hard to say much that is positive about this film. It attempts to capture a touching search for happiness. But all this movie will catch, it seems to me, is the bitter disappointment of viewers.

This is yet another in the recent collection of films that bring a group of strangers together, usually in a big heartless city. The strangers discover that they have something dramatic in common, and there's supposed to be a kind of cathartic synthesis in this commonality. When it works, it works because of good writing, acting, and directing. When it does not work, as in this film, there's not a lot of good to draw on, although, for the most part, I think the cast did its very best.

In my opinion, the story is absurd. I can only imagine that as production got under way somebody said something like: Let's have the Forest Whitaker character want to kill himself. How? Well...let's have him pay a stranger to shoot him. How much? Fifty thousand dollars in bundles wrapped with rubber bands and stuffed in a duffel bag. And let's have him drive around in a big old station wagon with seriously dirty windows. Okay, what about the stripper (Jessica Biel)? Oh...let me think...she's got a kid who is dying...and...in a coma. Let's have mom leave messages for him on the answering machine in his hospital room...And the Ray Liotta character? He's the stripper's father, who has just spent twenty-five years in prison. Seems he took a fall for somebody else (Kris Kristofferson) who gives him a suitcase full of cash on a bus...

I suppose that each of these and a few other unlikely story lines could have provided the foundation for a worthwhile movie. They do not here.",1247961600,6,1676,4.6745762711864405
3803620,3,B001URA5YI,"I hate to admit it but I rented this film because of the notoriety concerning Jessica Biel's first strip tease scene and nudity but also because of the cast which included some good actors such as Ray Liotta, Forrest Whitaker (who also co-produced), Kris Kristopherson, Lisa Kudrow and even Patrick Swayze who I usually can't stand is good in this movie. Unfortunately the major flaw in this film is the writing and direction. For some reason, many of the plot ends did not tie together in this film in particular the plot involving Liotta seeking to win Biel over as her real life father who she had believed to be dead.  The scene between them in the strip club was badly written and for a moment I had thought maybe they left a scene out. It's a pity since Liotta was very good in this and seemed to pull Biel into his sphere. Also I could never figure out totally the guilt that Whittaker's character was going through or even his relationship with the waitress (Kudrow) and how it played out.  This film has been compared to ""Crash"" but that film at least tied everything together in the end, this one unfortunately did not, thus the 3 stars are for the cast, some good moments but not for the writing or direction.",1245801600,,1220,4.490990990990991
3803621,1,B001URA5YI,"I will keep this short.  Do not see this movie unless you want to see Jessica Biel strip.

I have read some of the positive reviews.  I believe that other movies have posed and explored questions about love and human existence much better and more authentically than this movie.  Everything about this movie is a cliche and Biel should be angry because if she didn't strip in this movie, no one would have watched it.  Her routine--which is very well done, nudity besides--and Swayze's portrayal of the club owner are the only reasons anyone should watch this.  Rent it and keep the fast forward button ready if you're curious.",1245283200,11,627,4.706422018348624

8344708,3,B001URA5YI,"The only reason I watched this was because I love Ray Liotta and his eyes. He is any ""I love it"" rating that I would give and he was SUPER sexy with blue eyes and tattoos, but I can't give more than three to the movie because he didn't have enough screen time for me (too much Forest Whitaker, though I do like him), though Ray's story line was so touching I almost cried. Don't know why he didn't just tell Rose he was her father; he had nothing to lose and everything to gain. Anyway, it was very sweet when she tried to give him a lap dance but he refused all the sexy moves and just held her in his arms for a daddy daughter slow dance.  Very moving.

I also think that while Jessica Biel has the most incredible body on earth and as a straight woman even I can appreciate it, she's a dreadful actress, though she tried her best.

I'm sorry, Lisa Kudrow hooking up with Forest Whitaker? What in God's name is going on there? Terrible casting.

So here's my final word: If you are a huge Ray Liotta fan (or a BIG fan of anyone else in the movie), go for it. If you don't know any of these people it might still be interesting but maybe not worth it. Thanks!",1520899200,,1160,4.074561403508772
