3529023,4,B001DELWZ4,"""Orlando"" is one of Handel's ""magic"" operas.  Like ""Alcina"" and ""Ariodante,"" it is based on Ariosto's ""Orlando Furioso,"" an epic poem describing the adventures of Orlando (Roland), a knight in Charlemagne's army.  Although ""Orlando"" was not a great success in Handel's lifetime, it has come to be regarded as one of his finest operas.  It breaks many of the conventions of 18th century opera seria and moves into what Anthony Hicks calls ""fearful and uncharted waters.""  The famous mad scene at the end of Act II, in which Orlando, driven into a frenzy by his frustrated love for Angelica, imagines himself on a journey to the Underworld, is described by Hicks as ""the most astonishing stretch of music to be found in the opera--perhaps in any Baroque opera.""

This performance from the Zurich Opera House is conducted by the great Handelian William Christie, who has led other notable Handel videos, including ""Giulio Cesare,"" ""Hercules,"" and ""Theodora.""  The title character is sung by Marijana Mijanovic, who also starred in Alan Curtis's recent CD of ""Floridante.""  Other cast members include Martina Jankova (as Angelica, queen of Cathay), Katharina Peetz (Medoro, an African prince and beloved of Angelica), Christina Clark (Dorinda, a shepherdess), and Konstantin Wolff (Zoroastro, a magician).

In this production, Orlando is recovering from his lovesickness in a Swiss sanatorium, managed by a white-coated Zoroastro and a house staff of genies.  Zoroastro aims to restore the hero's mental health by turning his mind away from love and back towards military glory.  This dramatic concept is not entirely foreign to the opera, but I would have preferred a staging that was more faithful to the original.  (In comparison, the Wolf Trap Opera's production of ""Alcina"" in July 2008 was truly magical and showed how Handel's operas don't need this sort of modernizing.)  On balance, equating psychiatric medicine with magic does not advance our understanding of Handel's drama.

As would be expected from Christie and his fine cast, the playing and singing are first-rate.  Although some Amazon reviewers have been less than enthusiastic about Mijanovic, I find no cause for complaint.  In the mad scene (""Ah! Stigie larve"") she effectively portrays Orlando's mental state.  Nonetheless, the distracting production ultimately gets in the way.  When I want to experience ""Orlando,"" I am more likely to listen to the Hogwood CDs on Oiseau Lyre.",1220140800,12,2447,5.249357326478149
8293047,5,B001DELWZ4,"Well done! I usually prefer counter tenors nowadays, the mezzos in this production did very well - I could believe they were men. Staging the story in an asylum worked for me.

8293048,5,B001DELWZ4,"Me and a friend watched this and both agree that Marijana Mijanovic is very impressive and moving in this. We both searched her up on the net afterwards.

Most women sound weak in trouser roles, but Mijanovic has a powerful voice. I'd like to see her do more similar roles on DVD.

The production was acceptable too. Not too avant garde or rediculous.

Konstantin Wolff was alright too. There were some moments where things could have went smoother with the staging. I got the impression that something went wrong at one point in the final act. Wolff's interacting with the cast and apparently looking for direction from the conductor for the nuanced cadences. It kind of takes you out of the experience for a moment, but these are minor complaints.

The other singers pale by comparison. Marijana Mijanovic stands out, followed by Konstantin Wolff. Very enjoyable. I highly recommend it.",1375747200,,888,4.9
8293049,1,B001DELWZ4,"...produces results like this.  What one word could describe this Swiss massacre of Handel's music and Ariosto's ideas? Desecration.  My pen could employ many more - poorly sung; banal,  unimaginative, tired on every turn;  and I am not even talking of lacking of any original , new and creative ideas that would bring out something new from the richness of the music,  story and their history.  The production is so utterly  pathetic that it could not even approach a level where a discussion of innovation could start.

First of all,  what about a mise-en-scene concept of Orlando as a patient in a lunatic asylum?  How many times has this medical idea been already used and abused?  It's more tired than anything,  but this time Zurich seemed to really act as to outperform every trite production in a dazzling array of painfully familiar cliches - there was a ubiquitous suitcase, a telephone, an axe (ok, they substituted a usual gun with a axe, perhaps I should add one star for that); some pitiful gratuitous sex which did not look erotic at all, and that pathetic laundry.  Didn't we see the laundry in Zurich Der Rosenkavalier&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/R-Strauss-Der-Rosenkavalier-Stemme-Kasarova-Hartelius-Muff-Chuchrova-Groissbock-Gotzen-Vogel-Welser-Most-Zurich-Opera/dp/B0007D0AUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">R. Strauss - Der Rosenkavalier / Stemme, Kasarova, Hartelius, Muff, Chuchrova, Groissbock, Gotzen, Vogel, Welser-Most, Zurich Opera</a>&nbsp;quite recently?  What is this madness?  Maybe it's a sign of the Swiss obsession with cleanliness?

Every idea of the book/libretto has been perverted.  Orlando is a hospitalized mental patient; Angelica is sly syrupy wanton, Dorinda is a maid in a uniform and an apron (goodness, how incredibly creative is this!) and Zoroastro a cruel psychiatrist.  Well,  this was already enough to sigh from disappointment.  But how about the musical side of the show?

Zurich had attempted to cast a female singer as Orlando, not a countertenor.  The idea is good, as no countertenor could ever sound like Senesino, for whom the role was created.  But the role requires a GREAT alto who can sustain the  challenge of singing through the whole opera.  Alas, Marijana Mijanovich could not.  At her opening aria ""Non fu gia men forte Alcide""  I had some rays of hopes that she could continue with her gorgeous tone,  but even in that aria her voice was becoming perilously infirm.

As the show proceeds, the demands of the role took the better of her and the production itself contributed to her looking and sounding totally ridiculous.  When I saw her marching like an idiot in ""Fammi Combattere"", I felt really sorry for the singer to being subjected to such debasement.  I truly believe that for an artist being forced into the image of such utter lunacy ""envisioned"" by the stage director is a disaster affecting her singing.  Perhaps she would be better if the acting demanded was less devastating to the role.

On the other hand, I think extraordinary contraltos as Ewa Podles or Stephanie Blythe could all sing this part with glory;  why Zurich opted for Mijanovich is a mystery.  Perhaps they wanted to  mock this opera inside out?  Perhaps Handel's laurels deeply disturb somebody who was in charge?

Next, Angelica (Martina Jankova) is the worst I have ever heard in this role.  The standard set by Arleen Auger in this role&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Handel-Orlando-Bowman-Auger-Kirkby-Robbin-Thomas-AAM-Hogwood/dp/B00000E4OV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Handel - Orlando / Bowman, Auger, Kirkby, Robbin, Thomas, AAM, Hogwood</a>is a definite obstacle to enjoying someone's wobbling with vibrato as wide as English channel.  Jancova voice is too thin and bland for the role.  The stage direction did not help this singer, either - one of the most magnificent arias of the whole Handel's ouevre ""Ritornava al suo bel viso""  was decimated by a bizarre phone talking action; why???  The music illuminates the wondrous moment when Angelica falls in love from the first sight with the beautiful Medoro; but obviously that was deemed too nave and sentimental for the stage director.  So she is turned into some empty-headed artificially-mannered mannequin talking on the phone.  The whole idea of a sincere feeling free from plotting, perversity or disease seemed to offend the producers.  But it did not help to save the show.

Martina Jankova was quite junky and the first worst, in my opinion, even worse than Mijanovic on the role suitability scale.  Dorinda (Christina Clark) suffers from excessive treble, and only Zoroastro (Konstantin Wolff) was good enough, but the opera was not written for the secondary roles.

Medoro (Katharina Peetz) was passable but not thrilling.  It was also tremendously distracting to watch Medoro here, groomed as Alain Delon and playing a vicious heartless womanizer.  The final trio of the First Act,  one of the finest Handel ever wrote ""Consolati, o bella"" is turned into a vicious caricature on itself,  and even the threesome looks pathetic, plus badly sung (which by then becoming a signature of this production).

The famous mad scene ""Ah! Stigie larve"" has been totally lost;  it was not accentuated by the orchestra, which continued to play like it was a band on a fair weekend day in  a local park; and Mijanovic could not surmount it vocally; brandishing an axe did not help.  Besides, where would a patient in a ward get an axe? Ouch, this show was a collection of incongruities and stupidities.

All those miserable ""inventions"" just contributed to the overall ruin of the opera, further destroying every character of the story and the meaning of them and their relationship.  This was especially sad about Orlando, an opera based on a literary work that combined sophistication, wisdom and satire.  Yes, the author depicts the hero in a ironic light, mocking his passion, but juxtaposing it against his true obsession with possessing Angelica.  I personally would not call it love, but he was certainly infatuated with her; that allowed to smile at the strength of his devotion.  But all such subtleties were destroyed in this production - if Orlando is an asylum patient, how can his irrationality be mocked???  If Medoro is just a cruel seducer and not a weak sensuous beau, while Angelica is a mannerist air-head, how can we believe in their love and bonding?  The whole story makes no sense with liberties taken by the direction.

Finally,  the orchestra sounded dull and wan;  my old suspicion that William Christie is a true opportunist who just can't miss a chance to grab a production is now a conviction.  He had conducted a very good recording of Orlando&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orlando/dp/B004CYNM7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orlando</a>, and as a true musician he should not have lowered his standards for a live performance.  Obviously he was hearing at rehearsals and before everything I was hearing from the final DVD, and  yet he allowed such a production to surface.  It is a disgrace.

Alas, this is the only DVD of this opera available.  I love this opera madly; I fell in love with it when listening to Christopher Hogwood's recording with James Bowman, Arleen Auger and  Emma Kirkby.  I traveled to see the opera in Halle and Paris in 2010 and finally to Brussels in May this year.  In Brussels Rene Jacobs was conducting and Bejun Mehta sang Orlando.  I was surprised that Mehta did not do as well as last year in Harnoncourt's Rodelinda in Vienna.  It only highlighted to me the huge differences between the roles of Orlando and Bertarido, and huge difficulties of the Orlando's score.  It appears that Orlando cannot be sung only by a head voice of a countertenor; Mehta got laudably tired, although overall it was a much better interpretation than this Zurich coo-coo poo.  Mijanovich voice is far more beautiful that Mehta's, so I expected a lot... Another good thing about Brussels was a great Angelica - Sophie Karthuser, with Medoro - Kristina Hammarstrm, Dorinda - Sunhae Im and Zoroastro the same Konstantin Wolff.  I supply a link in Comments section.

And yes, in Halle, Handel's motherland and a German-speaking realm as Zurich, it was a similarly atrocious production, though more vulgar than this Zurich.  Paris with Sonia Prina was beautiful, the whole mise-en-scene and the ballet was absolutely stunning, but Sonia Prina was not always up to the demands of the role, her voice was unsteady at times and not in total control.  One is reminded again that singing a live opera is quite different from making a recording.  Yet overall Paris 2010 Orlando was a better production than this Zurich.  Why did they not issue a DVD of Paris performance? Or Brussels?  Many rhetorical questions to ask, but at the end we are left with a poo.  There is really no single redeeming quality of this production.

The public in the DVD applauds like crazy; I wish I were there and then they would hear my hearty honest big BOO!!!

A cuckoo poo deserves a good boo!!!

However, I have deducted a star because there is no subtitle menu on the Blu-Ray.  This is not a problem as long as you can access the subtitles through your remote but it was a problem on my older Blu-Ray player.",1307923200,2,426,4.5064935064935066
8293051,5,B001DELWZ4,"This production is fabulous.

Musically, it's beyond reproach. William Christie takes the score at a faster tempo than he did when he recorded the piece with Les Arts Florissants back in 1996, but, as was the case then, everything he's done serves the music beautifully. If anything, the differences only illustrate the fact that more than one approach can be valid. The playing of The Orchestra ""La Scintilla"" of the Zurich Opera is impeccable and inspired. Numbers like ""Non fu gi men forte Alcide"" with its horn obligato bristle with emotional fire. Gentle phrasings such as the lovely string passage that opens the second act express deep feeling without falling into excessive sentimentality. The accompaniment  to ""Cielo! Se tu il consent"" never loses or overplays the darkness that implies the beginnings of Orlando's descent into madness. These are just a few examples.

Marijana Mijanovi' is spectacular in the role of the tormented 'Orlando'. Her singing is very strong through the upper and lower areas of her range and her shadings are very expressive. Her acting is stellar. She's a beautiful woman but her gestures and body language make her very convincing as a man. Her portrayal of Orlando's madness is chilling. Martina Jankov is radiant as the lovely but conflicted 'Anjelica'. She uses a lot of vibrato to express the dramatic scope of the music but there's a quality of crystalline clarity at the root of her singing that lays a solid foundation for every note that passes her lips. As an actress (in this part anyway) she conveys seductive qualities that make it easy for the viewer to see why she's at the centre of focus for all the male characters. (They'd be dead if they didn't at least pay attention).

Christina Clark's voice is well suited to 'Bel Canto' singing (to sing beautifully in Italian). Her phrasings are exquisite. She has excellent clarity throughout her range and excellent control over her vibrato. Her acting is wonderful. She captures 'Dorinda's' sweet nature and the harshness of her situation without becoming an object of pity. The mezzo tones of Katharina Peetz are rich and filled with shadings. Her low end is absolutely lovely. Her portrayal of 'Medoro' as a rake of questionable integrity but no malice is excellent. When her character's dilemma is clarified she holds the viewers' understanding if not all of their sympathy. Konstantin Wolff has the least to do but his presence is felt throughout the opera. His portrayal of 'Zaroastro' as the manipulative and coldly malevolent 'creator' of heroes is, in its way, even more chilling than the madness that strikes 'Orlando'; unlike 'Orlando' he knows what he's doing. This is a tribute to both Wolff's ability as an actor and the work of the Director, Jens-Daniel Herzog.

Herzog does a tremendous job of keeping the story moving briskly. His sense of placing and movement is impeccable. He makes full use of both the cast and the music to flesh out the production. The set created by Mathis Neidhardt is a brilliant piece of work. It's less austere than what would be expected of a sanitarium but that never distracts from the action. There's plenty of room for the performers to move and enough space to allow different things to be shown simultaneously. The lighting design set in place by Jrgen Hoffman leads the eye to the appropriate focal points beautifully. The cinematography applied to the video shoot is very good as well. (TV) Directors Felix and Maud Breisach placement of the cameras do as much to keep the flow of the narrative moving on video as the work of the stage crew did during the performance(s) themselves.

The sound isn't quite what it could be. DTS 5.1 couldn't be tested because my system (pretty good conventional stereo) doesn't support it. The sound on the PCM track doesn't centre around the television as well as it should. The dynamic range and frequency separation on that track could be better as well.  The Dolby 5.1 track centres properly and has better frequency separation but still falls short of what's been done on other releases. The mix is questionable at times. Much of Katharina Peetz' work on ""Consolati o bella"" is buried. With her pitch and volume that wouldn't have been the case on stage. These comments shouldn't be misconstrued though. The sound is good. But neither the Dolby or PCM tracks here are as good as the PCM track on the EuroArts edition of 'Perse or anything I've heard from Opus Arte.

The main menu is flawed as well. There are settings for languages and audio but none for the individual chapters. The discs are divided into chapters but having a table of contents would have been nice. This listing does show up on an optional side menu on Apple's DVD Player application however. Go Figure.

Against the whole these complaints are minor ones. The execution of this production is brilliant. It is one of the most engaging pieces I've seen on video. It gets the highest recommendation.",1280016000,7,4959,4.887039239001189
8293052,5,B001DELWZ4,"The analogy was suggested by the golden yellows of the stage--and by the bubbly blend of strength and sophistication in Handel's music. In purely musical terms, the performance is excellent. I like Christie's architectural approach to Handel: the clean lines matched with exuberant ornamentation. Marijana Mijanovic is stupendous in the title role: not just her spectacular vocal powers but equally her lithe elegant presence on the stage. In the final scene, she looks uncannily like young Ludwig from Visconti's sumptuous film. It left me breathless.

The stage direction is uneven. Setting Orlando in a vaguely Freudian fin de sicle atmosphere is a percipient idea that yields some brilliant moments--the end of Act Two being a prime example. Regrettably, the insight is not sustained in all scenes. The character of Dorinda is left to an afterthought--profoundly unfair to the music and to Christina Clark who bravely does her best in impossible circumstances. Granted, the libretto is clumsy, but the score offers plenty of richness and depth. The attempts at humour tend to be bawdy and remain jarringly at odds with the music. I wish that the stage director had stayed with what seems to have been his original concept of Belle Epoque refinement and not lapsed into slapstick. Yet I cannot give the production anything but the highest recommendation. As a Classic Champagne Cocktail, it overdoes the sugar and perhaps somewhat neglects the cognac, but it still makes for some heady unforgettable evenings--even without Blu-ray, which is how I saw the performance.",1268697600,3,1570,5.254980079681275

8293054,5,B001DELWZ4,"From the very start, Christie led a historically informed and authentic sounding band, pacing them with a rare, dramatic drive and employing special orchestral effects that rendered more modern stage gadgetry almost entirely without necessity.  There was plenty of sting and bite when called for, the strings digging into the meat of the music, and there was also an almost restrained lyricism that at times made me feel like I was truly listening to the music of the gods.  ( I just read several reviews taking Christie to task and calling his effort here, ""dull"" - I cannot imagine a less apt description than ""dull"" for his work here - it is never less than thrilling.)

There is a lot of ""meat"" for the title character and I was pleased that Christie had at his disposal a contralto, rather than countertenor for this part.  The choice of Marijana Mijanovi' is an interesting and wise one.  Miss Mijanovi''s voice has a sort of bottled-up quality much more similar in timbre and weight to a countertenor than any female singer I can recall hearing since the Baroque Boom.  Slender and elegant, she also (and without resorting to artificial facial hair) makes a rather believable guy.  Some of her coloratura (particularly in the last act, where I fear she may also have been running out of steam), was unusually produced, a mixture of the aspirated and chug-a-chug varieties - but it also seemed to be borne of a dramatic, rather than musical choice.  Regardless , Mijanovi' gives a bold, theatrical performance.  Her depiction of the hero's madness in the last 20 or so minutes of the second act were delightfully and theatrically horrific.  This performance was particularly startling to me as several reviews I'd read complained that Mijanovi' was ""unconvincing"" in the trousers part.  To the contrary, her turn here is one of the MOST convincing male impersonator I've yet seen.

Having already witnessed an axe-wielding Orlando, our hero begins the final scene of the act on a mostly darkened stage, appearing in a doorway, light streaming out, the ax in high relief.  As a life-long horror fan, it always does my heart good to see directors not skimp on the shock factor (without resorting to the schlock factor) and with this one simple image, Jens-Daniel Herzog won a fan for life.

While I enjoyed her overall, I wish I could be even more enthusiastic about the performance of Martina Jankov as Angelica.  Looking remarkably like Charlize Theron in ""Head in the Clouds"" (right down to her costumes and wigs) she is a beguiling stage beauty.  The voice, in its middle range is warm, with a feminine gorgeousness to it.  Unfortunately, as she gets to the upper range and her extension, I found the sound tremulous and edgy, and not always properly tuned.  Super high notes (which felt unnecessarily added on) had a particularly screechy sound, probably more noticeable in this recording than live in the house.

Basso, Konstantin Wolff both in voice and visage made an imposing, impressive Zoroastro.  The voice had a rich, bloom and he dispatched his coloratura elegantly and with authority.  The very bottom of his voice tended towards the gravel-voiced or even inaudible, which can diminish - if only slightly - the effectiveness of Handel's music for him, but everything else was so spot on - including his wonderful acting - that he made the role work and his contribution was a major one.

With less time to shine than anyone else on stage, Katharina Peetz was pleasant as Medoro, while not bowling me over entirely.  Additionally, Ms. Peetz wasn't at all helped by the wardrobe mistress who made her Medoro appear as if an extra in a regional production of ""The Most Happy Fella.""

This leaves the role of Dorinda and the discovery of my new crush:  Christina Clark.  The American soprano from Toledo, Ohio is one of the brightest discoveries I've seen or heard in several years.  A little digging revealed she primarily works in Europe these days, though about a decade ago won accolades on these shores, singing the title role of Joplin's ""Treemonisha"" for Opera Theatre of St. Louis).

A naturally effervescent personality (at times she almost seems to exude sparkles) with a clear, radiant and flexible lightweight voice, her coloratura is of the razzle-dazzle variety.  She nails what seem to be about 30 trills in this music without batting an eye (okay, maybe once she bats an eye . . . sue me!) and Dorinda's music - clearly the most virtuostic in this score, is dispatched with a sense of lan and overall joy that is positively infectious.  Clark appears to be a completely natural stage performer, and whenever she is onstage you can't help but keep your eyes glued to her.  She's a good ""reactor"" - always paying attention to her fellow principals to the point where her reactions are as important as their cause.  While I enjoyed much of the ""business"" from the other singers it, at times, felt studied or tagged on.  None of this is true with Ms. Clark's performance - every action feeling germane to Dorinda's plight, including her interpolated giggles and sobs which, too often with operatic voices, come off as gimmicky and false.  Clark is definitely someone to watch for, but hands off . . . she's mine!

Herzog's production at first annoyed me, moving the 8th Century era to a Fin de sicle sanitarium, with its seemingly never ending ""Upstairs/Downstairs"" parade of servants and nurses.  It did not, however, take long for me to be absorbed by this conceit, the director, conductor and cast winning me over with brilliant musicmaking, above-par operatic action, marvelous costumes, sliding panels and ever shifting spaces for action.

While this has never been my favorite Handelian score, as here presented, the music flows beautifully, aria-after-aria, its ensembles, few and small in number, including a beautiful and rare (for Handel) trio sung with exquisite feeling and sense of time.  The baroque balance between drama and comedy are perfectly balanced and there is little not to enjoy in its 3 or so nicely paced hours.  This was a genuine joy.

8293055,5,B001DELWZ4,"Personally, I'm very fond of Marijana Mijanovic. As I've already said, she's one of the rare artists who dares to sing in her own original way. The voice is as unusual and odd as beautiful. It's always a bit shocking to hear a woman, well, a lady with such a virile and masculine voice, which is probably why some people aren't fond of her artistry.
Here, she's at home dramatically throughout the opera. Vocally, she varies from breathtakingly superb (as in Fammi combaterre, Non Fu Gia Men Forte Alcide), to passable (as in Cielo! Se tu il consenti). In the latter, although she shows incredible dramatic comittment, she vocalises in a awkard way possibly due to untimely inspirations. Let's keep in mind though that she's suffered from serious health problems which have endangered and weakened her voice, so considering it her rendition of ""Cielo! se tu il consenti"" remains good. I can't help wondering how she would've sung that aria five years earlier when she was in great form... Anyway, she's back from a year of sick leave (and pregnancy), and what've heard since she came back seems to indicate that she's back to greatness... To be continued.
Now, this Orlando also introduced me to a name I hadn't heard of before : the divine ""Martina Jankova"". What an amazingly beautiful voice! what a great dramatic performer! and what a woman! I think she' greatly underrated and doesn't get the recognition she truly deserves... But who knows, a lead role in Orlando might've opened new doors for her, and maybe she's soon release her first recital... One is allowed to dream all right.

The rest of the cast, is nice... not great, but good.",1229040000,15,1644,4.788732394366197

""...Bill Christie is not conducting his own ensemble, Les Arts Florissants, and the difference shows on his wise ninja turtle face, which looks as somber as the Zurich orchestra sounds. Handel needs to be 'sprightly,' and Christie knows it, but all he can elicit from this orchestra is stately.""  I haven't changed my mind about the orchestra. Some glee that I expect to hear in Handel's music just isn't to be heard from the Zurich 'La Scintilla' instrumentalists.

""... Director Jens-Daniel Herzog's dramatic reinvention of Orlando Furioso as a patient in a mental ward isn't such a bad idea on the surface, but it plays out as drab and dowdy rather than vivid and challenging. It 'works' but it's a lot of work...."" Actually, looking back, I DON'T think it works. It's too distracting, too clever without being very amusing. Watching Martina Jankova (Angelica) warble with a bloody nose, for instance, just didn't jibe with the music, nor did Dorinda's frantic effort to unzip Medoro's trousers while singing of fidelity. I'm not unreceptive to the combination of modernistic staging with 'historically informed' musical performance - not at all! - but this time I don't feel that the staging and the music have quite enough to do with each other.

But the biggest problem in the production, as I wrote in my first review, is the casting of Marijana Mijanovic as Orlando. Mijanovic gives the role everything she has, dramatically and vocally. No matter how fiercely she struts and scowls, however, she never quite achieves a convincing male affect. She struggles with the tessitura of the role, which is fiendishly demanding; her register breaks from tenor to alto to soprano are musically awkward, and her breathing is faulty at times, leaving her gasping in the midst of Orlando's melismatic flights of madness. The role dominates her more than she commands it. Frankly, there are numerous male altos who would have been more effective.

The other four singers in this small cast, without a chorus, are Martina Jankova as Angelica, Katharina Peetz as Medoro, Christina Clark as Dorinda, and bass Konstantin Woolf as Zoroastro, in this staging the head psychiatrist. All of them seem to be laboring with the demands of executing their forced dramatic roles while singing with appropriate grace. Clark and Woolf make the best of it, with some very lovely arias.

As I said above, there are more coherent stagings and more polished musical performances of Handel operas on DVD these days -- a marvelous change from just a few years ago -- and several of them feature the conducting of William Christie. If you are a Handel fanatic, chances are you've already seen/heard Alcina, Rodelinda, Agrippina, Theodora, Giulio Cesare, and Hercules; in that case you, like me, will NEED to get this Orlando and form your own opinion of it. If you've never before watched and heard a Baroque opera on DVD, I wouldn't recommend this as your first experience.",1228867200,6,3221,5.011214953271028
