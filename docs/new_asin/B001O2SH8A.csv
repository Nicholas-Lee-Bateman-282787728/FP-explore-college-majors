8328949,5,B001O2SH8A,I love James Cagney films and these were well remastered. Loved it.,1413158400,,67,4.666666666666667
8328950,4,B001O2SH8A,"The four films in this Synergy collection-- all of them lesser-known Cagney indies-- have been circulating in the public domain for years, none of them having been restored creditably by a studio or distributor of note (nor have they been here).  Having acknowledged that, however, Synergy, which typically produces cheap made-on-demand DVD-Rs, does offer four fully mastered DVDs this time around, each containing a single title, in an attractively designed package.  The transfer quality of the two Grand National pictures (1936's 'Great Guy' and 1937's 'Something to Sing About') is as fair as any of the grey-market versions I've owned; the print for 'Blood on the Sun' (William Cagney Prod./UA, 1945) is nearly as good as the impressive Image/Hal Roach release of 2000; and, disappointingly, 'The Time of Your Life' (WCP/UA, 1948) falls far short of the 1999 Roan edition, which remains the best (and most complete) available to date.  While none of these movies stands out as a classic of its respective genre, each is well worth seeing as a showcase for Cagney's exceptional scene-stealing skills (my personal favorite is 'Great Guy'): even given somewhat flat material to work with he's simply electrifying to watch.  Content combined earns around 3 1/2 stars; presentation/price 4-minus.",1397174400,3,1296,5.307317073170732
