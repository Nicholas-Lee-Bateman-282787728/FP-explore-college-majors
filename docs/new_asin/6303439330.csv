656243,4,6303439330,"Despite not being a fan of the theme park Disney Sing Along Songs videos, I do acknowledge that this one has a lot of energy and excitement. This video is really fun for the kids. Watch out for the new version of ""Part Of Your World"" from The Little Mermaid. Really gets you into the Beach Party mood.

Watch out for the DVD version. No difference so I've heard but I'm a Disney Sing Along Songs fan so I'm getting that too.",1123718400,2,424,4.170731707317073
656244,3,6303439330,"Instead buy the Disney Sing Along -- Disneyland Fun - It's a Small World.  This one has better-loved songs and more characters.  Beach Party, on the other hand, has more kids than characters --  when it's the ""live"" characters that my children love to watch.",1116979200,18,258,4.688888888888889
656245,5,6303439330,"I've nannied for a good 14 years now (still doing it and loving every bit of it) and I must say, this and the rest of the 'Character's in costumes', with the children singing and dancing, are absolutely the best! I've bought these videos for children I've nannied for, my little cousins, friends of the family children, etc. and now my Goddaughter; and she is just fascinated by all four that I have for her. When she comes to my house she starts screaming with happiness yelling for Mickey and doesn't stop dancing and clapping until it's over. Now that she's about to be 2 yrs old in less than 2 weeks, she knows which songs go with which video. She loves this video especially because it has `Pearly Shells' (she dances along with the Hula girls), loves ""The Hukilau Song"", we sing that one nonstop, and she parties along with the kids in the video as if she's there with them. It's just too cute to watch her and also enjoyable for us adults as well. Even Grammy is grooving along with my munchkin to the songs! Another MUST HAVE! But they can be very hard to find. Have fun! Dance! Sing! And `shake shake' like Mia to `Beach Party At Walt Disney World'!",1111276800,11,1158,4.390697674418605
656246,4,6303439330,My kids saw this video several times before we made our trip to Disney.  It seemed to make the trip more enjoyable because they were seeing things that they were familiar with from the video.,1075420800,,191,4.457142857142857
656247,5,6303439330,"OK, so the video is also an obvious commercial for Disney World, but who cares??  The place is great.  We used this video to get my 2 year old ready for our trip this fall.  He is soooo excited and is now very familiar with the characters.  I think it will also be a great way to relive the experience once we get home from Disney.  Oh, by the way, the songs are great and with the words appearing at the bottom of the screen it's a great learning tool!  Definately buy this video even if you are not planning a trip to Disney - a virtual trip can be just as good!  My son especially loves the parts filmed at the water parks.  Very entertaining - he will sit and watch the whole video (WOW!!!) Thanks Disney!",1014163200,26,709,4.086956521739131
656248,2,6303439330,I do resent buying a commercial Everytime my daughter sees it the nagging for a trip starts. I have learned to dread the sight of the video.,998265600,2,140,4.222222222222222
656249,5,6303439330,"This video was the inspiration to send my family to Disney World. The kids were cute and the songs were catchy.  They showed you many sides to D W like the hotels & water parks.  My favorite part was Minnie doing the hula.  Too cute!  This is definately a must for the springtime when the weather is still chilly and you wish for the heat of summer, Florida style.",976492800,2,364,4.231884057971015
656250,5,6303439330,"This video is so much fun!  The kids I baby-sit for (ages 2, 4, and 6) love it, and I actually love it, too.  Makes me want to go back to Disney  World.  It features real children singing a bunch of familiar songs in  settings throughout Disney World.  You'll see the kids snorkeling, playing  at Blizzard Beach, pretending to surf, and singing about pirates' treasure  aboard the ship from Peter Pan (Peter, Captain Hook, and all the gang are  there, too!) Ariel from The Little Mermaid even makes an appearance.  Several of the songs will already be somewhat familiar to kids, but in case  they aren't, the words are at the bottom of the screen (assuming the kids  can read.)  What's also cool is that two of the kids in the video are  actresses Mika Boorem (""The Patriot"", ""Mighty Joe  Young"") and Caitlin Wachs (""The Profiler"", ""My Dog  Skip""), so that's cool.  After a few (or 50) viewings, you'll have all  the songs stuck in your head, but that's OK, because they entertain kids  and help them learn to love music.",965952000,13,1021,4.541436464088398
656251,5,6303439330,"This is a very nice video, especially for the kids.  I seriously think kids would get a good amount of enjoyment out of this one.  The songs are right around their level and most of the words appear on screen for them to  sing along.  Great for summertime.  Scuba Mickey even appears in this,  which is a nice touch.  A very good video.",962064000,2,336,4.238095238095238
656425,5,6303439330,"My granddaughter LOVES this sing along.  She knows them all by heart and sings happily.  She is 7 and has not gotten tired of this in the 3 years we have owned it.  This is my second purchase because I have to keep one at my house and one at hers.  The children in this video really play to the camera and are a bit cheesy, but, it's for children and my granddaughter certainly doesn't see anything but the children having a good time. I highly recommend.",1495756800,,455,4.195402298850575

656722,3,6303439330,"The only reason I give it 3 stars is b/c it's Disney.  The Sing Along Disneyland Fun is the reason I ordered this in hopes that it would be similar.  WRONG!  It's cheesy, so cheesy and doesn't feature the characters enough!  It's downright annoying,  My grandson that adores the Disneyland Fun one will watch this one but it doesn't hold his attention and he's not very interested in the songs on this one.",1439856000,,406,4.506849315068493

656966,4,6303439330,A friend recommended the Disney sing along DVD's for our grandson who is 2 years old.  He absolutely loves this one and I do believe it is because of the children actors and of course the characters.,1357344000,,199,4.378378378378378

Great music, beachy, catchy and will get your little ones up and moving. Words run across the bottom of the screen like karaoke...I learned some new lyrics myself. Super fun.",1354233600,,297,4.823529411764706
657054,5,6303439330,"My 5 year old daughter loves this. She loves to dance along with the music and pretend to be like one of the kids with Mickey and Friends. My 2 year old enjoys the music, but not as much as his sister. Since she got this DVD she has watched it at least once each day and would probably put it on continuous play if I would let her. As a parent there are some songs I remember from my childhood. It's a mix of kids tunes, Disney tunes and pop tunes. Really not at all annoying as some kids movies can be. Highly recommend it if you have a kid who really likes Mickey and friends. And unlike some of the others, this one is not really a Disney World commercial. There is one set with Blizzard Beach, but the others don't really glamorize the various attractions and aren't likely to set off a 'can we go' tirade.",1347840000,3,810,4.10062893081761

Anyone who has a child who loves music, dancing or Mickey Mouse will love this movie. The kids are a little cheesy with their actions and expressions but it really is a great DVD for any young child. I owned this movie as a little girl and enjoy sharing the memories with my son. Disney has made another hit with this Sing-Along video!",1330732800,,432,4.154761904761905
657057,5,6303439330,Yes I will admit that I know every word to this sing along! My child literally jumps up & down the entire time this is on. It is absolutely the best sing along for boys & girls. There is a fun pirate part for boys & Ariel part for the girls. I own all the sing alongs & this one is hands down the best. Will keep your child entertained & happy the whole time. We love it!,1327017600,,371,3.769230769230769

657059,5,6303439330,My kids 3 and 2 love this sing along!  This is one DVD they'll watch from beginning to end.  Full of great songs.,1291593600,,113,3.869565217391304
657060,5,6303439330,"Our 22-month old is OBSESSED with this video. Like, if there was a Mickeyholics Anonymous she'd be going there. At first I thought it's because she hasn't watched TV until recently. But she doesn't care about any other film -- she just wants this one. ALL THE TIME. As soon as we get home, she says ""Mockey?"" once a second. Of course we don't let her watch it all the time, so quite a few conflicts arise there.

So on the one hand, this video is GREAT at doing what it's supposed to do: entertain children. If you want your child rooted in place so you're free to do other things, this video is great for that! Our 4-year old neighbor next door was also fixated by this video when she was visiting, so the target age range is pretty wide.

On the other hand, it can potentially drive parents crazy (we have all the songs from this BURNED into our brains) and turn children into crazed Mickeyholics! I am a huge Disney movies and resorts fan, but even I can't sit through this whole video and remain sane. I can watch little bits here and there. It's definitely targeted at kids under 10.

Oh, by the way, if you're a fan of Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" like I am, you'll be interested to know that Jodi Benson, who provided the voice of Ariel for the movie, makes an appearance as Ariel for this video in the ""Part of Your World"" segment.

UPDATE, 1 month later... She has expanded her tastes to include Barney, Sesame Street and Dora. And she actually prefers them over this sometimes. So I guess the obsession was not long-lived, thankfully!

UPDATE - 7/2/10 - She finally got tired of watching this.

657184,3,6303439330,"It just might be me but I see some inconsistencies. The show must have taken years to film because either the kids grew up or there are different kids towards the end. It does not look like Mika Boorem in the segment ""Hot, Hot, Hot"", In the segment ""Set Your Name Free""
the lead-in looks different than the song itself as far as Caitlin Wachs, in the song she resembles Mary-Kate or Ashley Olsen. Also in the same segment one minute Brenden Clark has sunglasses on his head, then no sunglasses, then sunglasses, then no sunglasses. There must have been some editing. Actually to me it looks like Mary-Kate or Ashley Olsen is also in the next segment ""Surfin' Safari"". In the segment ""Set Your Name Free"" Brenden Clark looks taller than Mika Boorem, but in the lead-in segment to ""Three Littles Fishies"" where they are taking the pictures Mika looks taller than Brenden, but in the last segments Brenden looks taller than Mika again. I like the show despite these inconsistencies.",1249344000,,979,4.6976744186046515

657186,5,6303439330,This is a fun video kids can sing along with!  I ordered it because I had the old version on VHS and it has 2 great songs you can use for a luau!  Would be perfect for a beach party theme too!,1238198400,,192,3.5476190476190474
657187,5,6303439330,"My daughter first saw this show, well a few mins of it on YouTube. She loved it! We bought her the DVD for Xmas and she watches it everyday. She sings and dances to all the songs. Not a bad price for the DVD either.",1231286400,,215,3.8
657188,4,6303439330,"After my infant daughter so enjoyed the ""Disneyland Fun"" DVD, I decided to get this one for her.  While she enjoys seeing the costumed Disney characters and the lively songs, she did not enjoy this one as much and neither did I.  Filmed on location at Walt Disney World in 1995, this video features a group of very hyper children dancing and singing alongside the characters.

Grown-ups familiar with the Disney parks will enjoy spotting the different Florida locations as backdrop.  Scenes were filmed outside the Grand Floridian and Polynesian resorts, near Fort Wilderness, in World Showcase lagoon at Epcot, and even at the backlot of the MGM Studios (doubling unconvincingly for the childrens' own homes and neighborhood).

I was disappointed to see that, unlike the ""Disneyland Fun"" DVD, this one did not offer a second bonus program in a different language. ""Disneyland Fun"" offers an entirely different second program shot at Disneyland Paris which doubles the running time of that DVD to one hour.  My advice is to purchase that one instead, but if you want two or more singalong DVDs, this one is a pretty good second choice.",1231113600,2,1135,4.947368421052632

The kids (5 year old twins) have watched it over and over, both before we went to WDW (I want to do that!) and after (I did that!).

She dances to all the songs just like the children on the DVD and has started singing the songs on her own when the DVD is not on.  It is enjoyable for the whole family.  There's none of those annoying songs and you will know many of the songs HOT!HOT!HOT!, Limbo Rock, Celebration, Slicin Sand and many more.  We liked it so much we also purchased Camp Out at Disney which she loves equally as well.  Tiffany Burton is a very talented kid - look for her on the videos.  Worth buying.",1177977600,,599,4.192982456140351

657267,4,6303439330,"My kids adore the Disney Sing Alongs and the ones with the big characyers are their favorites. This one is upbeat with great songs sure to be stuck in mommy's head for hours, and lots of dancing. The biggest (and it's not that big) complaint is the kids get more face time than the characters do in this one, and my kids prefer Mickey over some random girl.

  If you don't own and of the character sing alongs, the one to buy first is the Disneyland fun one. If you own that one, the next best one to get is Disney Campout. If you are sick of those two and have played them to death, this is the one to get. After you wear this copy out, Flik's Safari is the last in the series.

This Disneyworld Sing Along does not compare at all to its predeccesor. The songs, scenes and all around fun that the Disneyland Sing Along offers is what the Disney theme parks are all about.  This DVD makes you feel like you are NOT part of the fun.  My advice, do not bother!

The songs are more of the original songs of Disney, whereas this Beach Party video has lots of ""covers,"" if you can even call them that. One interseting thing is the young actress Kaitlyn who is in the video. She looked VERY familiar to me, and since the video was made in the mid 90s, I had to see who she'd grown up to be and why she looked so familiar! Turns out Kaitlyn in the video is Kaitlyn Wachs (pronounced Wax) who is a 16-year-old actress who is currently in the tv show Commander in Chief. She also played young Vivi-ann in the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood! Great young actress, and a fun way to see her in her earlier years! You'll crack up.",1130112000,5,773,4.16
