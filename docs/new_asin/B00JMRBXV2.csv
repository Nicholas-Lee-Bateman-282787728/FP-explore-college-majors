6381685,5,B00JMRBXV2,"Manuel Martin Cuencas Cannibal is quite unlike any of its predecessors in this particular taboo genre, a painterly and patiently filmed drama that engenders an unexpected and deeply complex moral quandary. Cuenca treats the subject matter thoughtfully through immersive long takes, rich compositions defined by mesmerizingly dim lighting that sharply contrasts the sunny landscape of Granada and nuanced characterization at once elusive in a psychological manner and overt in a bloody but never gratuitous manner that the subject matter practically necessitates. The handling of sequences in which a body is dismembered by the titular cannibal, Carlos (Antonio de la Torre), is one of the films greatest virtues, the camera averting its gaze from the sawing and gutting in favor of a slow, prolonged and quite graceful lateral tracking shot of the blood running down the grey slab on which the victim lies. Carlos is unnervingly quiet, antisocial and above all meticulous  hes regarded as the best tailor in Granada  the very antithesis of the wise-cracking, flamboyant and flammable Hannibal Lecter and his many descendants which have come to form a prototype. In this fundamental respect Carlos is an aberration from that prototype of the highest order, a cannibal to be sure but one whose tenuously romantic entanglement with a new citizen of Granada, Nina (Olimpia Melinte), unfolds cinematographically in an ethereal form that recalls the incomparable Michelangelo Antonioni.",1414108800,,1480,5.4868421052631575
6381686,2,B00JMRBXV2,"I will say at the outset  that Film Movement sent me this film to review, and that never in a million years would I ever watch a movie about a cannibal at my own behest.  I have never seen Silence of the Lambs, beautiful though I am repeatedly assured that it is, and I have no intention of ever doing so.

Having given fair warning, I must admit that for a movie about a cannibal, this is not nearly so distasteful (sorry!) a viewing experience as one might assume.  The publicity blurb on the inside front cover claims that the ""truly gruesome work happens off-screen."" My definition of gruesome must be more encompassing than that of the blurb's author, because I saw quite a bit of material on-screen for which I would use that descriptor.  Nevertheless, there are some interesting camera angles and quite a lot of dramatic footage that increases the tension.  The ending is satisfyingly equivocal, and we are left to wonder whether the cannibal has been redeemed by love.  Not that I really cared by then, because he's a cannibal and I found it difficult to work up any sympathy or fellow human feeling for him.  If that reveals something inadequate about my own humanity, I can't say I care.

IfThe New York Times wants to call this film ""Sumptuous!"" (according to a quote on the front cover), they are welcome to do so.  I'll just call it ""Yeccchhh!""  (In Spanish, with English subtitles, which I turned off halfway through because I preferred not to know what was being said in some places.)",1412208000,2,1499,4.597744360902255
6381687,5,B00JMRBXV2,"So you say you like blood and guts and lots of gore...well then you will be a bit disappointed. This Spanish movie has more of a character study, less gore and the horror is ""tasteful"" as far as the genre is concerned.  A quick summary without giving away too much: a highly skilled lonely tailor has an appetite beyond the normal.  I really liked this movie; it was deliberate in its unfolding and you actually feel for the perpetrator.  So if you are in the mood for something a little different try ""Cannibal"".",1411171200,2,513,4.494623655913978
6381688,5,B00JMRBXV2,"Another one of those delectable serial killers who lives an outwardly passionless life in which every element is controlled. This one's Carlos, a Granada tailor, who expresses his passion for women by accosting them at night (in the opening sequence he runs the lady he's after off the road, along with her husband) taking them up to his remote mountain cabin, killing them, and cutting them into little bits which he keeps in his fridge at home to feast on.
He plays the game a little close to home when he gets a crush on his new neighbor, a pretty Romanian who gives massages that probably are more than just massages. One night she has a fight with her sister Nina over some stolen money. She comes to Carlos for a witness and Carlos offers to take her to the police. She gets in his car and never comes back.
Not long after, Nina shows up at Carlos' doorstep, and the story really gets in gear, because the feelings he's getting for Nina aren't like anything he's ever felt before...",1410652800,,988,4.4944444444444445
6381689,3,B00JMRBXV2,"This film has an awesome description that it doesn't really add up to. Not a bad film at all but you think you're going to watch something like silence of the lambs and its really a more introspective journey into the mind of a sad and messed up person, which is good but unexpected. Notice the little things about it I guess. Interesting view of a meticulous tailor with issues about women and sex which, obviously, would lead to cannibalism.",1408579200,3,443,4.55
6381690,4,B00JMRBXV2,"Carlos is a high end tailor living in beautiful Granada. He lives alone and more importantly eats alone because he has a refined palate. That is, as the title sort of gives away, he likes eating people - moreover young and pretty women. He actually murders them too and is very adept at buthchery as well.

He seems to have no feelings of guilt or remorse and is almost clinical in how he operates. Then Nina comes looking for her sister and walks into his life and he starts to find her attractive - and not just the thought of her as an hors-d'oeuvre, then his journey of self discovery begins.

There are some very unsettling scenes here but the cinematography is excellent, with the subject matter you may actually miss how well made this film is. The shocks are brief and often and there is a brooding sense of foreboding throughout. Antonio de la Torre puts in an excellent performance as Carlos but all the acting is great. This put me of eating meat for a few days actually so probably did me some good, but not one for the easily shocked. In Spanish with good to excellent sub titles and with a run time of nearly two hours - which could have been a bit shorter. The tag line for this was `love is insatiable' - perhaps `don't go near the scary, well dressed man' might have been more accurate but either way still a film I can recommend.",1407628800,3,1347,4.362549800796812

6381692,5,B00JMRBXV2,"One can still call this a horror movie, but it's done with style and though it's rather slow moving, it hits the mark.
Carlos is a tailor in Spain, where he has met, murdered women, and then....well, you know. He's a quiet man, secretive and difficult to get to know.  It's rather refreshing not to hear screaming, running, and so much blood letting. Yet it did get to me. Carlos meets another woman, and some time later, her sister Nina is at the apartment, looking for her sister, whom she hasn't heard from in quite awhile. Carlos offers his own quiet way of helping Nina. Think you can guess the ending?  I tried several times, but was so wrong.  Fantastic adult viewing.",1406332800,6,675,4.516393442622951
6381693,4,B00JMRBXV2,"""Cannibal"" (2013 release from Spain; 117 min.) brings the story of Carlos, a well-respected in Granada at day, but a cold-blooded murderer and cannibal at night. As the movie opens, we see a couple at a gas station and when they drive away, Carlos follows them, and causes their car to crash. He removes and takes the woman with him, and does what he does. Meanwhile, Carlos has a lovely new neighbor in his building, a Romanian girl named Alexandra who moved to Spain with her sister Nina to make money and support their parents financially back home. When Alexandra also ""is disappeared"" by Carlos, Nina comes looking for her sister. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, don't be fooled by or intimidated by the movie's title. This is MILES away from ""Silence of the Lambs"" and its sequels, as this is NOT a horror movie or an action movie. Yes there are several harrowing scenes in it, but the focus of the movie is on a much deeper level, namely how one man can find himself in this position and just when you think you've figured him out, you are taken into a new direction. Second, kudos to director Manuel Martn Cuenca, whose previous movies (including ""Malas temporadas"" and ""The Weakness of the Bolshevik"") are now on my ""want-to-see-badly"" list. Third, the pacing of the moving is glacier-like, and I mean this as a complement. Check out the opening scene at the gas station, which takes several minutes and the camera doesn't change angles or zooms in, it simply lets you take it all in (this comes back a number of times in the movie). In keeping with the deliberate slow pace, there equally is no musical score for the movie (the only occasional music we hear is from the radio in Carlos' tailor shop). Last but certainly not least, the 2 main actors, Antonio de la Torre as Carlos and Olimpia Melinte in the dual role of Alexandra and Nina, give towering performances which will stay with you long after you've seen the movie.

""Cannibal"" is the June, 2014 release in Film Movement's DVD-of-the-Month Club, and the DVD will become generally available to the public in October. As is usually the case, the DVD comes with a bonus shortie, and this month we get ""Ogre"" (18 min., from France), about a heavy-set man who encounters an all-too-kind young lady at the beach. Equally worth checking out! Meanwhile, ""Cannibal"" is a fantastic addition to Film Movement's ever-growing library of foreign and indie movies, and frankly one of the best movies I have seen so far in 2014. HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1403481600,9,2632,4.694805194805195
8652482,4,B00JMRBXV2,"A while back, I read the book ""The Monster of Florence,"" which started out as a terrific read and then just ended as a very good one.  The problem was, I thought that the author wrote himself too much into the book in Part Three, which is maybe unfair, because I suppose he didn't have much choice.  At any rate, I was thinking about that still-unknown killer while watching this film.

Without giving much away about this movie -- or that story -- early in the first act, ""Carlos"" is eyeing his victim and eyeing a particular part of her anatomy.  I'm sure I'm not the first person who has watched this film who has also thought, ""Um, what's he going to do?!?  Is he going to eat THAT?!""  The film doesn't seem to go in that direction, but most of the gore is only implied so it is unclear what he actually does.

This film looks fantastic.  The cinematography in particular is really strong, and there are many great shots:  a still camera with a dark room and a small window; a still camera and an open doorway with heavy rain falling; and many scenes that take place in the mountains with fresh snowfall are beautiful.  But where this film might fall apart -- if you call giving a 4 out of 5 rating ""falling apart"" -- is in some of the writing with regards to Carlos.  Carlos is a very organized serial killer -- he may be a cannibal, but it shouldn't be forgotten that he is also a serial killer -- and so all of his actions should be well thought out for him.  This next paragraph might have a few minor spoilers:

SPOILER ALERT:
1.  If you're a cannibal, you would put a very high price tag on human flesh.  After all, it is very hard to come by.  Why doesn't he have a lock on his refrigerator, and why doesn't he have a back-up power generator?  What if the power goes out?
2.  He let a gal into his apartment and allowed her to go into the kitchen, where she obviously peeks in the refrigerator.  This guy would not allow this to happen, under any circumstances.  This would be a show-stopper for him.
3.  You know the expression:  don't, well, you-know-what where you eat.  Well, Carlos kills at least one woman in his apartment complex.  No way.  Most serial killers are smart enough to not kill anyone they know, but they also avoid killing people that are too close in proximity.  They are serial killers, which mean they've killed at least three people, which means they've been successful, which means they don't make too many mistakes.  This was a huge mistake.
4.  Carlos doesn't kill the sister of a gal he's already murdered when he easily has the opportunity -- which maybe I can buy -- but he TELLS this sister, after the fact, that he killer her sister.  No. . . Way.  Well, if he did, you know another saying:  ""I could tell you but then I'd have to kill you.""  He would have.
5.  Carlos keeps a flier from a gal that he's killed and leaves it hanging in his kitchen.  I doubt it.  If the cops ever came snooping around, and they asked him, ""Did you know so and so?"" and he replied ""No,"" they'd simply point at the flier and ask him why he's lying.  And then he'd start to sweat.
END SPOILER ALERT

Well, the critics were a little tough on this film -- I believe only 50 percent liked it on Rotten Tomatoes -- and I can understand why they'd complain.  But while I will complain about some of the writing, I thought that the direction, acting, and cinematography were pretty terrific.  So I'm going to cannibalize those critics myself and go with a strong 4, as I thought that ""Cannibal"" was surprisingly tasty.",1444003200,,3535,4.338931297709924

Visually appealing shots pared well with excellent acting by both our protagonist and supporting cast. It proved downright interesting. Also, this film very well might appeal to those whom would turn their nose up at it because of the title and underlying subject matter: You meet a quite, kind, and not quite evil man (rather unfeeling, possibly cold) who finds a love that's not ""all consuming,"" and that could take his orderly and routine way of life in an all new direction... possibly one that's not so cold, loveless, and solitary. He's a quiet and complicated man... so, why not give him a chance? LOL.

8652487,4,B00JMRBXV2,"There are few things in the world more taboo than cannibalism.  The concept of dining on ones own species ignites a deeply rooted, primal fear and repulsion that rivals only a small list of phobias.  As such, it makes a perfect device for a movie.  There are many films out there with cannibal in the title, however director Manuel Martin Cuencas CANNIBAL is a study in contrast.  While the underlying theme of eating human beings haunts almost every scene, the movie is about so much more than just that.  The result is a lengthy however emotional glimpse into the life of a reclusive individual who is simply looking for love.

This film is not what I was expecting it to be.  Its labeled as a thriller, however its more of a slow-burn drama that climaxes with a quiet whisper than a bang.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it is a nice deviation from overdone tropes regarding cannibalism.  However, the length of the movie is what hurts it in the end.

CANNIBAL is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  The cinematography is more a visual display of artistry rather than a simple Hollywood-esque way of telling a story.  I admit this style takes a while to get used to (there are many single-angle shots of long scenes), however once you are acclimated to it, youll find it actually enhances the film.

I am a bit up in the air in regard to the acting.  I like both of the main performershowever this film and script do not do a stellar job of showcasing their talents.  Not that this is a bad script by any means.  However, because of the nature of his character, titular human-carnivore Antonio de la Torre delivers almost every line with the same simplistic, almost monotonic style.  The actor never has a chance to show us anything else.

The storyline of CANNIBAL is a dramatically-infused mystery of sorts that takes a while to get going.  But once it picks up speed (about an hour into the film), things start to get interesting.  Unfortunately, during the time it takes to get to that point, not much happens.  There are a couple of false starts, where I thought something was going to happenhowever, nothing did.

Still, I cannot deny how much I enjoyed CANNIBAL once it took off.  And I actually liked the ending, although I will wager some viewers will not.  I recommend giving this film a look.  However, be warned:  there is no English dubover; it is just Spanish language with subtitles, so if you don't like reading, I would steer clear.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1416441600,,2519,4.564732142857143

8652489,5,B00JMRBXV2,"Director Manuel Mart&iacute;n Cuenca has transformed the novel by Humberto Arenal written for the screen by Alejandro Hern&aacute;ndez about a topic that has been placed before the theater audiences before. The subject matter of cannibalism can be either disturbingly dark or it can be an investigation of an obsession worthy of examining. It is the latter path that this film takes.

In Spain, Carlos (Antonio de la Torre) is Granada's most prestigious tailor. His life is a study in details, from the meticulous suits he creates for wealthy clients to the macabre murders he executes in the shadows. He performs these gruesome acts, including dining on the women he kills, without guilt or remorse. When Nina (Olimpia Melinte), a beautiful young immigrant from Romania, comes looking for her missing twin sister, Carlos responds with a kind of love he had long since written off. As their relationship builds, based on secrets and deception, Nina's pure innocence will become undeniable, even by Carlos, a man driven by a dark secret. Cannibal is, in the end, the love story of a demon.

The film manages to include scenes of cannibalism but filmed with such restraint that we feel we are simply observing Carlos' propinquity. No sensationalism here, just a quiet, nearly wordless peak into the mind of a madman who is still capable of acting out life to please his clientele. It is only when the force of attraction that develops when he grows into his fondness for Nina that his other wayward manners seem strange. De la Torre is very fine at pulling off this impossibly difficult role. Grady Harp, November 14",1415059200,2,1614,4.952029520295203
8652490,2,B00JMRBXV2,"...Hannibal Lechter would not approve.

""Cannibal"" begins with almost four minutes of a nearly static opening scene, showing the transaction of the driver of car at a remote gas station late at night. It is shot from a great distance, and there is almost no dialogue. Distance from its characters and lack of exposition (through actions or words) are the downfall of this film, despite its provocative premise.

Carlos is a maker of handmade suits in Granada. He lives an ascetic, ordered life, with his apartment and studio situated across the street and within view of each other. His only apparent joy is in restocking his refrigerator...with the products of the female victims he targets, kills and then butchers in a remote mountain cabin.

This routine is toppled with the intrusion of upstairs neighbor Alexandra into his world. A Romanian immigrant whose actual job is one of the film's areas of ambiguity (legitimate massage therapist or something else....you be be the judge) who has recently arrived in Granada after working in a ""spa"" in Zaragosa. Vaguely threatened by another Romanian (is he a pimp? you decide), Alexandra ends up missing. This sets the stage for the arrival of her sister Nina, her former spa partner (played by the same actress). Against his own sense of control, Carlos engages with her on a personal level. It's not a spoiler to say that what ensues is not a madcap romp, and neither does the outcome --while tragic-- track entirely with the film's title

This movie is nearly two hours long. Its impact could be greater without the repeated, lingering camera shots of the small --if macabre-- world that Carlos haunts. Similarly, the plot is interspersed with many distractions: the well-heeled client of Carlos that is going to get him an invite into a fraternal organization, his side work on a piece of fabric with religious significance, the strained relationship with an relative of indeterminate connection (aunt? cousin? who knows), Aurora.

Enter with caution. When you're done, you might wish you were on top of Carlos's preparation table instead of in front of your video screen.
