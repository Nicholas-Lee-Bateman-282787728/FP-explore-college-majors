2664405,5,B000IZK7X2,"I have never tapped before, and always wanted to try. From the very first lesson, I learned steps and exercises that I enjoyed and helped me feel good physically and mentally. Eli's incredible teaching ability and approachable method will get anyone enjoying tap in no time. I highly recommend this video to anyone, regardless of skill or age, and believe they will enjoy and appreciate it as much as I do.",1169596800,7,406,4.732394366197183
2664406,5,B000IZK7X2,"I just received this DVD and having reviewed a number of the lessons, am very impressed.  As an adult beginner, I have been taking tap lessons for over a year or two, and have purchased a number of other tap instructional materials.  I wish I had this DVD at the beginning! Eli does a great job of breaking down the fundamental elements of tap, with an emphasis on correct technique, providing tips on correct weight transfer and timing, and at a pace that is easy to follow.  Even though I thought I was already familiar with most of the steps presented in the lessons, in fact I learned something new about even the most basic of steps, such as a ball-change or hop.  For example, he introduces the (""simple"") step, hop, flaps and shuffles individually, then combinations of a shuffle-hop-step and flap-shuffle-hop, that (I believe) are elements of a time-step (which has been problematic for me).  I feel confident that a review of these lessons will help me improve on the steps I am working on today, and, with these technical foundations, will more quickly learn newer ones.  I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to learn tap.",1165104000,125,1138,4.722222222222222
2664407,5,B000IZK7X2,"This is an excellent DVD for adult beginners; it covers the basics steps very well and adds some nice combinations that actually look like tap dancing.  Watching the lessons is a lot like being in a class; the instructor shows the step part by part, helps you practice it slowly a few times, and then gradually brings you up to speed.  When the steps are put into combinations, the instructor doesn't assume you've totally mastered the basic step; he covers the combination nice and slow as well.  One advantage over a live class is the use of a split-screen; you can see his feet from both the back and the side at the same time.  And, of course, you can slow it down even more or pause it if you need to.

One of the things I really like about this DVD is the instructor's style of dance.  It's not the fixed-smile-and-splayed-fingers kind of tap I associate with little girls in sequined outfits.  It's the smooth, relaxed-looking style of Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Ginger Rogers.  Obviously, one beginning tap DVD isn't going to get you to Broadway, but this one is a good place to start.",1164585600,79,1095,4.522842639593908
2664408,5,B000IZK7X2,"This is the most useful ""how to"" video I have ever tried.  Within a couple of sessions, I was able to follow along and I had never tapped before.  The menu is set up so you can play any technique separately, so you can tap even if you only have 10 minutes free! Often, videos like this show begining technique but at an advanced pace - which is discouraging.  Not here.  You can see yourself progress each time you move up in pace. Easy to follow, and fun. I cannot wait for the next level to be released!",1163808000,43,505,4.122448979591836

2664410,5,B000IZK7X2,"So excited to learn how to tap dance! I know this cannot replace a live class, but this is all that's available to me where I live. I like Eli Newsom's teaching style. He has a professional aura about him, but is friendly and encouraging at the same time. He speaks very well and does not babble with unnecessary talk. He puts in valuable tips where you need them. The lessons are presented clearly from simple to tricky, and there is a reasonable amount of repetition for practice. I like that there are 2 views at once: a full front/back view and side closeup on the feet. The music is a piano accompaniment, which gives the whole thing an easy-going vibe (not intimidating), at the same time upbeat and fun.

The whole visual design is a tad too dark, with the black background, dark gray floor, and the teacher is in black clothes and black shoes, so there is not much contrast to pickup little details. Nevertheless, I am able to focus on the lesson at hand because of the split screen feature, which helps a lot. I guess the dark over-all color is actually effective.  I'm glad he is not teaching in front of the mirror (at least in the basics) because it can be distracting.

I can't wait to order level 2 and the rest. I hope I will last long enough to get to the higher levels. So far, i love it and am enjoying learning with my son! :)",1443484800,2,1345,4.308300395256917
2664411,5,B000IZK7X2,"I was looking to add something to my workout routine and found this gem. The instruction is excellent and I love the split screen. This is a beginner dvd and it is very very basic but a good refresher for anyone that once upon a time took lessons and perfect for an absolute beginner.  Some of the basic steps included are:

Step
Stomp
Flap
Shuffle
Ball change
Paddle step

The instructor explains each step well and demonstrates and then you do a series of those steps accompanied by piano. Super fun and I would totally recommend it!",1441929600,2,535,4.494845360824742

The exercises also help me work on timing and balance.  I prefer to watch the DVD on my laptop instead of the TV because then I can set it on a table, rather than looking down at my TV screen.

The guy is a great teacher, and he leads you slowly and systematically through each new skill. At the end, he teaches you an entire dance that you can do with him or on your own.

I tap danced as a kid, but that was many years ago. This DVD helped refresh my memory and led me through each of the steps I needed to re-learn in order to get an amazing workout. And talk about a workout! My kids call my tap dancing ""interval training"" because it's that intense.

The side-by-side shot of the instructor's feet really helps to convey the correct method.  I made my husband work through the exercises with me, and we actually worked up a bit of a sweat and were laughing at our inability to keep up with the instructor when he sped up the pace.

I can review and practice at home without slowing down the other students who have mastered some of the steps already.  I like the routine at the end of the video where he puts steps together.  The other instructional video I'd recommend to beginners is the one by Bonnie Franklin, ""I hate to workout, I love to tap.""  I used both videos during a few weeks' break from tap class.

My  eight-year-old grandson had been keen  on tap dancing and had just started in a 'warm-up' class, once a week for a month, that was with older, seasoned students.  His teacher took individual time  with him, but he remained undisciplined in  his movements,(he slapped his feet around a LOT!)But with Eli Newsom's instructions, he stayed within proper step...and practiced.
Mr. Newsom starts with the very basics,done slowly and clearly, broken down into individual sections that  can be replayed or skipped-over as needed. His attitude is patient without being condescending and so encouraging that were these old knees  of mine in better shape,I do believe that even I could learn to tap dance!

This series is the next best thing.  It has cleaned up my technique and has made me a better dancer in my live classes.

Best of all, the material is seperated in to chapters that are easily selectable from the menu so you can either follow the program from the beginning or jump in wherever you want. The DVD starts quickly at the menu and does not requre you to have to watch the intro every time you start the program. The instructor's dialog does not hamper the flow of the excercise, so that once you begin to improve, you don't find yourself waiting through stuff you have already heard.",1270166400,,654,4.891891891891892

  He goes slowly and builds on each step.
  The video is set up so that one can start at the beginning and go straight through without stopping, or one can pick and choose which steps to work on until you get one mastered.
  An outstanding instructional video!!!",1213920000,2,543,4.59375

2664471,5,B000IZK7X2,I cannot recommend a better starter tap dance instruction!  It actually helped me in the beginning tap dance class I began taking.,1203206400,,130,4.909090909090909
2664472,5,B000IZK7X2,"I had not tap danced since I was about 8 years old and I really wanted to try it again!  Of course, 8 was over 20 years and...well, several pounds ago!  But, even I can tap dance with this video instruction!!  Eli truly breaks down each step and with the aid of a close-up camera angle, you are sure to pick up every detail.  Eli's patient and encouraging teaching style helps you stay focused and feel as if you are actually in a one-on-one tap lesson.  I strongly recommend picking up this video before signing up for tap dance class!!  The price of this video is about 1/2 the going monthly rate of crowded tap dance classes and worth every penny!!  Happy Tapping!!!",1202860800,2,669,4.390243902439025
2664473,5,B000IZK7X2,"Dear Eli

Oh my goodness, I just had to write to you.  I'm 61 years old and took up tap dancing over a decade ago.  However,  I was in a class filled with fairly experienced dancers and was told to just join in and somehow catch up with them.  As a result, I felt intimidated and inadequate.

In the meantime, I broke my ankle a few years ago and gave away my beautiful new tap shoes, thinking I would never take it up again.

Well, the exciting news is I'm learning quickly from your DVD and I'm amazed at how fast I'm catching on.  I can't get enough of it.

You make everything simple and easy to follow.  The extra plus, is I'm losing weight and toning up almost effortlessly.  Exercise has never been so much fun.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for creating such a wonderful DVD.  You are an amazing teacher.

Most sincerely

2664474,5,B000IZK7X2,"The DVD's have arrived today, and I immediately started to make good use of them! and I am finding Eli's instruction to be of excellent quality, and so very helpful. I recently joined a class for which instruction had started in September, so I have some catching up to do, and I know with Eli's help, I will be able to achieve that!  His teaching is very precise and understandable, and very friendly.  Thank you soooo much Eli. I will tell those in my class who are struggling to be sure to place their orders! :-)  Teresa - Alexandria, VA",1201392000,,541,4.39

Learn the basics at your own pace and repeat, repeat, repeat, if you need too.  My grandaughters and I have lots of fun practicing and laughing with each other.  We may even enroll in a formal class this spring. Two thumbs up for this one.

2664476,5,B000IZK7X2,"I am a 53 year old man, who recently had two stents placed in my heart-of course, the dr. recommends bicycling or fast-walking for rehabilitating my heart, but how boring is that?  The answer to me is Eli Newsome's Tap Dance Made Easy!
  Never having been a dancer, I found TDME to be easy to understand, the steps are explained so any one can do them, and the health benefits are great! It's great aerobic excercise,  blood pressures down, pulse is  down, legs feel great, but best of all IT'S GREAT FUN! And who excercises if it's not fun?
  I strongly recommend the course, as a matter of fact, I'm going to order the next DVD in the course !",1200441600,2,645,4.325

Eli Newsom is easy, smooth, and takes things very slowly.  I do not feel that it is a real workout though.  Just a nice easy introduction to tap.",1197417600,14,285,3.8448275862068964
2664478,5,B000IZK7X2,Eli Newsom does a fantastic job of teaching ballet to a beginner. Makes it easy to understand and do. I am totally pleased with this DVD and highly recommend it.,1191974400,2,161,4.4
2664479,5,B000IZK7X2,ELi Newsom's  DVD  is  fabulous.  I took a live  class over the  summer  in NYC and  this helped me a great deal once I left the  studio. I  was NEVER a dancer and now at 60  I  am  having  a great  time.. I feel  as  though I have accomplished  something I never DREAMED I could  master-  but  with Eli's  help  ( and it  feels as  though I KNOW HIM NOW)  it looked easy  and instilled  confidence. I just WISH  he had  the next  level  available. PLEEEEEASE ELI!  think about  vol #2!!!!!!!!!!!,1189296000,2,496,4.087912087912088

2664481,5,B000IZK7X2,"Eli Newsom made it so easy that a beginner could do it.

Out of all the DVD's that I've bought in the past, they were not bad but ""Tap Dance Made Easy"" is the best one that I have so far. It teaches you every single step about tapping from the start at a lower pace then a faster pace so there is no way you'd get confused.

It's highly recommended",1186617600,,348,3.887323943661972
2664482,5,B000IZK7X2,"After nearly four years as a tap student, i still consider myself a beginner, and appreciate all the instruction I can get.  Eli provided just that in a clear, meaningful, and useful progression of demonstrations, culminating with a doable ""routine"" at the end, which incorporated steps he taught throughout the video.  It made me feel like ""I can do this!""  A definite sign of a good teacher.",1185062400,2,393,4.835820895522388
2664483,5,B000IZK7X2,I think this DVD is excellent for someone wanting to learn some basics of tap dancing.  It is like being in a class but better because you can replay any bits you need as often as you need.  The presenter is clear and concise and gives some pointers about technique.,1185062400,,266,4.3
2664484,5,B000IZK7X2,Eli is a talented dancer/instructor who makes me feel like I'm in a real class. He has a very nice style of teaching that is so relaxed and encouraging. I love the music too; it makes me feel like dancing :) I highly recommend this dvd as it is so well done and makes learning to tap easy and fun!,1184803200,4,297,3.966666666666667
2664485,5,B000IZK7X2,"I bought this dvd for myself, simply because I've always wanted to learn how to tap dance. I have no previous experience in any form of dance but I am a fairly quick learner, so I decided to give this dvd a shot. I sure am glad I did. I love the way the dvd is broken up. Eli Newsom gives wonderful tips on not only the placement of your feet, but also reminds you when to change your weight. He breaks down all the steps in a way that is easy to understand, and you also have two veiws to watch his steps from; something that I found very helpful. You can go through the lesson in it's entirety, or you can go through it chapter by chapter. All in all if your looking for a dvd to get you started on the basics of tap, I highly recommend this one. You'll be tapping before you know it!!!<:)",1179619200,8,791,3.981132075471698
2664486,5,B000IZK7X2,"Simply Great!...When I received this DVD, I thought, 'ok, I'll have a look what it's all about'. The next minute I felt I had to put my newly bought shoes on and couldn't take them off for more than an hour! Eli's instructions are so clear and his teaching style makes me feel so relaxed about the whole learning progress I feel like I'm in a real class where the instructor is focusing on me. (I found myself talking to him one stage :-) I just want to keep learning! As he teaches each step in different tempos it's great for complete beginners like myself and others who need to perfect their steps they are already familiar with. I love the piano music during the 'class' too, because it helps a lot when I try to count the beats. Not to mention that you can view the steps in two different angles at the same time. Once you have perfected your step, you can focus on your body position. Looking at the whole body image helped me figure out the right body position and find my balance during a difficult step. So I can highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is passionate about tap dancing and I can't wait to see the next level (although I have a lot to learn before I can leave this one behind!).",1177113600,23,1203,4.25764192139738
2664487,5,B000IZK7X2,"We have LOVED Tap Dance Made Easy's 1st DVD!
  My 8 year old son has some learning challenges that rhythm training helps a lot.  Not only is occupational therapy to accommodate his need expensive and a hassle, the sessions just get old.  Tap has what he needs.  While his tap classes have taught him steps, they haven't been able to assure his rhythm and technique are right (he needs extra help there) - thus, he was not getting the full developmental benefit tap has to offer in classes.
  Tap Dance Made Easy has saved the day!  It had to be simple and concise because I am new to tap myself.  It had to have room for challenges or we'd get bored.  It had to be fun, well, just because it's more fun and likely to get done that way.  Tap Dance Made Easy covered it all wonderfully. We especially like the split screen with side and back views at the same time and how Eli makes it seem perfectly natural to need lots of practice.  We feel challenged but not rushed.
  Thanks so much for an awesome, affordable product!  We look forward to the follow-ups!

I read a few reviews saying the DVD didn't work very well.  We put it in our DVD player (a cheap one I bought as a replacement until we could get a Blu Ray) and it would not work.  It kept freezing up.  It would not return to the menu.  It just made it impossible.  It works perfectly in our Blu Ray player and, I'm guessing, would work in a decent regular DVD player as well.",1452988800,3,541,3.9906542056074765
