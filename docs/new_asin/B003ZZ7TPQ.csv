actors today can do comedy like this.",1366416000,2,170,3.9411764705882355
4237434,5,B003ZZ7TPQ,"This is an oldie goldie that I'd been looking for, for a long time.  I was excited to see that I could get it through
Amazon, as a single.  I saw it with other Jack Lemon movies, but I had most of them.  The cast is a collection of
actors that possess something a lot of today's actors don't have. Talent.  Memorable & very funny.  You'll recognize quite a few
faces of actors when they were ""babies"".",1303948800,8,401,4.1558441558441555
