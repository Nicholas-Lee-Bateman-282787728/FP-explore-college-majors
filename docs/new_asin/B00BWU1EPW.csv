I consider myself a fairly intelligent person, but the idea that troubled/abused women would be drawn to this woman, and wait with bated breath for her wise utterances? What?

I did enjoy Elizabeth Moss and the main detective mystery.  The score/soundtrack was excellent...",1382400000,,446,5.013513513513513

5679594,5,B00BWU1EPW,This was an awesome mini series. It kept me in suspense until the end. Did not expect that ending. Although I did suspect that the lead detective had something to do with the girl. That kept me watching it from beginning to end.,1380758400,3,228,4.325581395348837
5679595,1,B00BWU1EPW,"I thought this might be worth a try based upon other reviews raving about how the show was from Oscar winning writer and director Jane Campion. But truth be told anytime reviews elaborate on past work is because the new work stinks, which is more the case with Top of the Lake.
The location and cinematography were lovely and mysterious but once the characters started speaking my thoughts were who wrote this gibberish? Having watched other police shows enough to think that Detective Robin Griffin (Elizabeth Moss) was the dumbest most incompetent police officer ever. A pregnant little girl has disappeared and the police just declare her dead without even looking for her. There are numerous sightings and it is suspected that teenagers in town are sneaking food up to the girl in the woods. Yet somehow the teenagers are able to outsmart Detective Griffon every time. So after months of doing nothing Detective Griffon and her new/old boyfriend decide to go look for the girl in the woods themselves only making it couple 100ft into the woods before they must get naked. And that is how most of her investigation goes. There are twists in the story yes the pregnant girls father is also the drug king of the area and employs most of the town people including the police force. There is also a cult of middle aged victimized women that move into a field and start living in shipping crates.
When the whole series is over you are left thinking oh my god I just completely wasted 7 hours of my life on this.",1379980800,27,1509,4.655430711610487

5679611,5,B00BWU1EPW,"I loved watching this story. I made myself stop so I didn't rush it. I wanted to live in that environment even though it was so heartless, it was beautiful. I was amazed that characters were all so human that you knew there was somebody who was doing something dastardly but there were so many possibilities. It's good to see men portrayed the way they are. We forgive them for being such monsters when they are monsters. Then we adore the sweet men. We hope all men are that way. But, all women know the others. You just wanted Robin to carry a gun all the time but the fact that she did not made her so much more of a heroine. That bottle through the stomach of a rapist was so satisfying....listen to me...who is the monster now? The women's colony grows on you. At first you just think they are kind of lost and silly but you soon find that everybody goes to the matriarch. And Holly Hunter played this person on such a middle path. She had this benevolent strain of distance. I LOVED IT. I am so grateful that this was made and TOTL China Girl is also amazing. Thanks.",1505692800,2,1073,4.264705882352941

5679617,5,B00BWU1EPW,"Top of the Lake is a superb seven-episode miniseries from the Sundance Channel, which is a combination of a crime drama and a slow-burning psychological thriller. Top of the Lake is set in the remote mountain town of Laketop, New Zealand, and its story line centers around the investigation into the case of a twelve-year-old girl, who was discovered walking into the freezing waters of the mountain lake, in an apparent attempt to drown herself. After this young girl is rescued, her medical examination produces the horrifying revelation that she is five-months pregnant, which renders the investigation even more pressing and urgent. A female detective from Sydney, Australia, who happens to be in town visiting her sick mother, is consulted by local law enforcement officials to participate in the investigation, because she specializes in sexual assault cases. It turns out that this detective has suffered significant trauma of her own, when she was a teenager, growing up in the seemingly idyllic town of Laketop, New Zealand. To make matters worse, the twelve-year-old girl suddenly disappears, throwing the entire investigation into a state of disarray. Top of the Lake features very edgy and original writing, which creates an extremely haunting and foreboding atmosphere, with a palpable sense of tension and mystery. Its multi-layered plot is decidedly captivating and thought-provoking, albeit somewhat uncomfortable and disturbing. The complicated and interconnecting relationships between the principal characters cleverly complement the compelling story line. The performances of the lead actors, Elisabeth Moss, David Wenham, Peter Mullan, Thomas M. Wright, and Holly Hunter, are truly outstanding, and the performances of the supporting actors are also stellar. The mountainous and heavily-forested New Zealand landscape surrounding the beautiful lake is absolutely spectacular, and essentially represents its own distinct character. Top of the Lake is a gripping and intriguing crime drama and psychological thriller, characterized by excellent plot and character development, as well as superb acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1500854400,3,2222,5.756838905775076

5679630,2,B00BWU1EPW,"Sick, twisted, albeit moody and well-acted.  SO disgusted I wasted my precious time and money on this.  Riddled with gratuitous scenes for shock value, but sadly, without any pathos or real compassion for the tragedy at the heart of it all.  I'm no prude- full frontal nudity, sex and profanity don't bother me but utterly gratuitous, salacious CRAP which lends no understanding of characters' hearts does.  ***SPOILER ALERT*** If seven hours of incest, child molestation, torture, and murder, animal killing, domestic violence, rape, and corruption galore floats your boat, have a look.  Well-made and riveting to be sure (like being unable to look away from a gruesome car wreck), but after I felt mostly disgust, like I needed a good long shower.  Jane Campion, how COULD you make such trash?  Purports to reveal the hearts and minds of women, in particular, most notably the main character, a female detective who is a hot mess emotionally and a joke as a cop to boot.

5679651,5,B00BWU1EPW,"In the hands of a true artist, a simple crime story can be used as a vehicle to explore deeper questions about our humanity - to show how communal bonds are formed and how easily they can be undone.

Oscar-winning writer-director Jane Campion does just that in her new masterwork, Top of the Lake, a seven-part miniseries starring Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss and the prolific Scottish master-thesp Peter Mullan.

Top of the Lake opens on a breathtaking landscape - an alpine lake bounded by snow-capped mountains in a remote corner of New Zealand. It's pristine, too unearthly to have been spoiled by humans.

But we're not alone. In a poetic yet jarring moment, a young girl walks into the freezing water. A suicide?

The girl, 12-year-old Tui Mitcham (Jacqueline Joe), stops when the water reaches her chest. We find out later her walkabout is a failed attempt to induce an abortion.

Rescued by police - a tiny police department in a tiny, rural town - Tui is interrogated by a young officer, Robin Griffin (Moss), but she refuses to identify the father. It's no wonder: Her father is Matt Mitcham (Mullan), a violent drug dealer with a short fuse.

Then Tui disappears.

Top of the Lake follows Robin's search for Tui, and, more important, the truth about her pregnancy.

The series isn't a run-of-the mill procedural, but a moody, deeply disturbing study of the human character - and how it's shaped, or more often twisted - by family and social ties.

Robin grew up locally, but she fled to the big city for good - or so she thought - after a failed romance with one of Matt's three sons, Johnno (Thomas M. Wright).

Urbane, educated, and an accomplished detective, she meets with sexism and out-and-out hostility when she comes back to town to care for her dying mother. Even her only friend, Detective Al Parker (David Wenham), is happy to mock her in her absence.

Campion takes us through the looking glass when, out of nowhere, a group of middle-aged women show up in Paradise - as the locals call the lake area - and establish a commune.

Led by an American New Age guru named GJ (Holly Hunter), the women are runaways from bad marriages and violent families. Damaged, emotionally scarred, they've come to the edge of the world to find themselves.

Campion creates in Top of the Lake a social pressure cooker, a place where self-enclosed tribes - Matt's violent criminal gang; the equally misogynistic, gun-toting gang called the police force; and the women's therapeutic commune - collide and tear at one another.

Stuck in the middle is Robin, whose hunt for Tui begins to uncover deep, dark secrets about her family she'd rather not know.",1449014400,,2650,4.745098039215686

5679670,1,B00BWU1EPW,"To begin with, this is six hours of viewing, one long and slow story that unravels a bit like a dry sponge with not quite enough water.  And did I mention the word ""slow?""  And what happens at the end of six hours is...well, very little.  Unlike those Hollywood endings that seem to just wrap things up, this story just sort of ends, leaving so many unanswered questions that you wonder if you missed something or if you're simply watching too much video stuff since six hours just got wasted.  Sure, read the other reviews and be baffled.  I certainly read the reviews on the cover but now find what they were really describing.  ""Stunning"" said New York Magazine (but they meant the scenery, not the film), and ""A Triumph"" said the Philadelphia Inquirer (they likely meant the motorcycle scene when they spotted a Triumph in the group).  Yes, this is a mystery, an isolated drug ring and a missing 12-year old girl, and basically a police force that seems little concerned.  So the missing girl's father hires a bunch of bikers and hunters from this tiny isolated town to look for the girl (the police don't care), they find her, and then they're all gone (and so is the girl)...huh?  A bunch of women arrive to play rich-ladies meditation getaway and then, they're all gone...huh?  The main characters all have questions about who their real father is and...they never find out.  Huh?  Even the terrific scenery of New Zealand is never fully captured, the film crew limited to the hills outside of Queenstown (if you've ever been there, you know that even walking around the area gives you more beautiful scenery).  So what went wrong?  Holly Hunter plays a semi-useless character with disheveled hair and looking quite haggard.  And there's more than enough sexual tossing about that has (in the end) little to do with the story.  And then, it's over.  SIX HOURS you've wasted.  And despite the writing credits of Jane Campion, you feel as if a talented 2-hour script was turned in and the producers said, ""we need four more hours here,"" and thus all the added and unnecessary filler.  Normally, the BBC does a much better series release but not this time.  Better to spend your six hours watching The Street, STUNNING acting, A TRIUMPH of writing, and you won't feel that you've been watching way too much video at the end.",1429315200,12,2328,4.687192118226601

5679702,5,B00BWU1EPW,"I was not a watcher of 'West Wing' nor of the now-concluding 'Mad Men' so I was not familiar with the work of Elisabeth Moss.  So, she was a revelation here to me as Det. Robin Griffin.  Her charm and beauty sneak up on you.  Her acting seems effortless and natural until you realize that she's playing Kiwi here and pulling it off brilliantly.  The accent alone makes you realize how much work a top actress like this puts in to making herself be the character.

Still, despite Moss' sterling work here, what will stick with you is the tour de force performance of Peter Mullan as local drug honcho, Matt Mitcham.  It is absolutely mesmerizing stuff that garnered Mullan a well-deserved Emmy nomination.  Writer/Director Jane Campion's script juxtaposes the misogynistic, hyper-masculine Mitcham with a male-averting group of women who've set up caravan on what he thought was land he controlled.  The women have followed their guru, GJ, here.  Right away you can tell: this meeting of macho and feminine independence isn't going to end well.  GJ is played with monosyllabic intensity by Campion collaborator, Holly Hunter.

I also liked Thomas M. Wright as Mitcham's estranged son and Griffin's once-high school boyfriend, Johnno.  He rides to the rescue of Robin here time and time again.  Wright is also a player in the awesome Fx series, 'The Bridge.'  He's an actor worth watching.",1397433600,,1387,4.922413793103448

The acting is superb and the scenery gorgeous.  The direction and production value are also fantastic.  However, the story just wasn't that strong and it was so full of clichs and unnecessary side stories, it made it almost unwatchable.

Holly Hunter's character and supporting cast were just weird and out of place.  I found they just didn't belong.

IMHO it felt like the writers just tried to throw everything that they could think of.  With a little editing/tweaking this could have been one of the best.  But I feel it was just not focused and just all over the place.

Under the direction of Jane Campion with a stellar cast, set in a cinematographers visual candy store, how could one go wrong?  Ultimately the story fell short.

5679742,2,B00BWU1EPW,While the plot was quite intriguing I simply could not tolerate all the disgusting characters in this series.  I only watched the first 2 episodes.  When there is not one single person I like in a production there's no reason to watch it.  The language is totally foul.,1388793600,6,269,4.5625
5679743,3,B00BWU1EPW,This program is average. Story line is not that interesting. Some speech is hard to understand and Elisabeth Moss is only adequate,1388707200,,130,4.954545454545454
5679744,4,B00BWU1EPW,"An absolutely beautiful New Zealand setting - a 12 year old pregnant girl - a policewoman specialist assigned to the case, back in her home town to be with her terminally ill mother - a criminal enterprise run by an evil man wracked by his own demons - a group of women living in a wacky new age ""commune"" - a subtext of hidden crimes and cruelties.

For me, all of this came together as totally compelling and engaging story-telling.  I was particularly struck by the heroine Robin Griffin, played by Elizabeth Moss, who returns to the environment where she experienced a horrific personal event. While dealing with her mom's terminal illness, she becomes obsessed with the case of Tui, the young pregnant girl, who disappears.  We begin to see connections with Robin's personal history as the story slowly unfolds, revealing increasingly sordid and disturbing elements. She reconnects with someone from her past and their relationship, as it ebbs and flows, is fully realized, deeply intimate and completely believable. Robin's scenes with her mother are very nuanced and speak to the complexities of their relationship. The New Zealand location itself - the shots of mountains, forests, lakes and rivers - is a major element of the story telling.  In watching this series, you are repeatedly shocked by the contrast between the beautiful natural landscape and the horrific nature of the human landscape.

Less compelling for me was the Holly Hunter character, GJ, the spiritual leader of a group of woman camping out in storage containers by the lake shore. I assume we're supposed to see GJ literally as a healer, philosopher, guru, whatever and not as a caricature. However, every time she appeared, I felt the energy draining from the story, and her matter of fact pronouncements came across as parody. The guitar girl (you'll know her when you see her) gets too much screen time.

The plot takes some twists and turns that verge on the gothic/baroque. However, for me the overall experience of watching this series was fantastic. I was totally riveted by the story and the story-telling. Many thanks to Jane Campion and her cast and crew!",1388707200,,2145,4.944444444444445

5679749,4,B00BWU1EPW,"A 12 year old girl is seen trying to drown herself in the lake, and is found to be pregnant.  She disappears.  Her father is the small lakeside town's leading illicit businessman Matt Mitcham, patriarch of a well-off hill dwelling clan of white trash hellians ironically named (from the father on down) Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  There's a current wife and a baby, but they only mumble in the shadows.  Visiting her dying mother in a nearby town, is a former local girl, Robin Griffin (now a detective in Australia) who is mustered into the investigation thanks to her training with children.  She runs into her former boyfriend from high school, Johnno, who is also a Mitcham, but apparently (aside from the missing 12 year old girl, Tui) the only nice one.  And, down on the lake shore, on a ranch called Paradise, is a brand new colony of damaged women led by their wealthy, gnomic guru, GJ, who out bid Matt for the property by a cool million.

Paradise was apparently once Matt's family property, as he angrily reminds folks, and he's constantly promising his dead mother that she'll be buried there, but how it came to fall out of the family hands is never quite clear.

It turns out that Matt's family, and many of the locals, produce a variety of drugs, including rufies, which are used in another local business, by the more upstanding citizens of the town and....oops!  Spoiler!

It is here that a profound truth is revealed by one of the women in town, to Detective Griffin, who's trying to find Tui:  They all know what they're doing is wrong, and self destructive, but there aren't any other opportunities.  As the woman puts it ""I could go down to Christchurch and spend all day working for nothing...""  The rotten core of our Anglo-American economies is this lack of opportunities for a growing number of our citizens.  But, it's only mentioned, and we return to the story, to find Tui, without dislodging the town's sordid economic underpinnings (as if this can be done) or worrying about what will happen if she's found, and everything is upended anyway...

And of course, with all the biblical names, it's a nice touch that a Griffin is at first the only one trying to protect the child, given that the mythological character is a guardian of treasure, and wisdom, and often represents Christ.

The setting is starkly gorgeous, the story is dark.  There are moments of humor (often from the women at Paradise) and Detective Griffin re-kindles her childhood romance with Johnno, the one decent Mitcham.  But essentially,  the movie's message is ""Men Are Pigs"".  I was reminded of Hannah Arendt's ""Banality of evil"" thesis, which she postulated after sitting through the Nuremberg trials of notorious Nazi (but no Soviet) killers.  Before her were men charged with the most monstrous of crimes who, nonetheless, had nothing monstrous about them; rather, they looked like people she knew; relatives, the postman, the grocer.  There's nothing redeeming about the Mitcham clan, or any of their associates.  They're white trash advertisements for abortion.  They're dirty, cruel, ill educated, foul mouthed, wretched examples of humanity.  Some of the more upstanding men in the story turn out to be just as foul, if better groomed and with straighter teeth, but essentially, all the men are either foul, or (on the positive side) ineffectual.  The women order them to strip if the women want to play, on their terms only;  or the men strip to rape women.  Women strip and walk around naked in a more artistic sense, all dropping lines of the sort one would want to draw, rather than play with.  It is the great weakness of this story that it is built with such blatant stereotypes.  Yes, much of Hollywood is just as weak (""12 Years A Slave"" comes to mind) but just because the boys cuss and spit, is it really necessary to do the same?

The seven episode version here is the Sundance Premier version that was presented over 7 hours, with one intermission and a lunch break.  It makes for incredible, near spellbinding watching, but I wouldn't call it unique;  ""unusual"" or ""distinct"", perhaps, but not unique.  It's female, or even feminist, viewpoint is a large part of what makes it stand out from the crowd (along with the cinematography, of course), but we'd have to erase all the fine work from HBO and Showtime (and especially the BBC, the BBC Australia being a partner in this), in order to even begin to claim that no one is doing this sort of stuff.

It also bears noting that, despite the subject matter, pretty much everything violent or crude of substance relative to what underpins the mystery, happens off screen.  Even when Matt shoots a dog, you don't actually see it.  Thus, for the more squeamish and those who can't take violence on a par with ""The Soprano's""  you don't have to.  It's mentioned, it's suggested, but mostly, what's happening in the background stays in the background, and only bubbles up for suspense.

If you want something to cut through the saccharine sweetness of the Holidays, break open a nice bottle of wine and snuggle in for a seven hour journey into the dark side of New Zealand, this is great entertainment.",1387238400,,5172,4.760942760942761
5679750,5,B00BWU1EPW,"To be honest, I'm generally extremely wary of shows like ""Top of the Lake."" In the past I've found them to be boring, pretentious, poorly done not to mention often needlessly depressing. I just kept seeing such great reviews for it though, and eventually thought, ""why not, watching the first episode can't hurt."" Reader be warned. You won't be able to just watch the first episode. About a day later, you will find yourself with bleary eyes and the realization that you just watched one of the finest  contributions to film of the year.

To start off, it's not boring in the slightest which really makes no sense as a basic read of the plot would indicate that it should be. The essentials are that a young girl becomes pregnant, goes missing, and then the main character who is a detective spends the rest of the series talking to people trying to figure out what happened to the girl. However, writer and director Jane Campion has a brilliant ability to really draw out the major events and sustain the tension throughout long periods without big action sequences. She uses atmosphere and psychology to keep things riveting even when it's just two people talking to each other. Despite much of the major plot twists happening off-screen actually, Campion frames these events through the people who they affect and in turn these events take on a deeper meaning than if you saw them on-screen.

As far as atmosphere and cinematography, ""Top of the Lake"" is positively stunning. Filmed in entirely on location in New Zealand, Campion doesn't need CGI or tricks for high impact--she let's the scenery speak for itself. This is no low budget production either. The quality of picture and color rivals that of any summer blockbuster.

Now, this series does deal with some very heavy topics. Obviously, pedophilia is discussed--but so are a host of other things. Cancer, a parent's lies, incest, rape, sexism, misogyny, mental illness, clinical depression and organized crime all get the full treatment. Herein lies Campion's true gift. She somehow is able to craft the story and characters in such a way as to not drown the watcher in such a bleak and awful world and yet doesn't hold back from her subject matter either. Campion is also able to present these topics in a way that seems natural and integral to the story, instead of esoteric and pretentious.

Holly Hunter's ""GJ"" character who is sort of a therapist/hippie/con artist/cult leader, did sometimes come across as a little over the top for me. Yet I could see how important her character was to the story and even the plot in spurring others to action.

In short, this miniseries is gorgeous with stunning acting and a plot that is very dark yet won't overwhelm either. It should be obvious that this is most certainly not something for kids, but I would imagine almost all other age groups would find something to both enjoy as well as really contemplate. To often I find film to be used as a method for simply communication or entertainment, but it's the rare film that is all those things as well as art. And this is in fact one of those rare films that is both entertaining and provoking as well as exquisitely crafted art. Highly recommend.",1387065600,3,3205,4.755395683453237
5679751,3,B00BWU1EPW,"This didn't work for me for two reasons. First, the detective played by Elizabeth Moss was an idiot. On several occasions she went unarmed into dangerous situations without any backup and had to call her boyfriend to bail her out. Despite several inappropriate suggestions from her supervisor she met him alone after hours. And she announced her chief suspect to civilians.

Second, most of the men in this show were sexist straw men. I can't believe that 95% of men would act as crass and boorish as the men in this show. At least, I hope that's not true.",1385856000,5,556,4.616161616161616

Breathtaking. And then there is this ridiculous story that makes no sense and honestly, is very hard to follow.

The characters are all sleeping together including the lead investigator (Elizabeth Moss (yes, she IS Outstanding.  Undeniably so)), sleeping with someone who apparently gang raped her and got her pregnant when she was only 15?!? Really? Why would she ever go back there anyway after that? Then there is the young innocent child Tui, who just vanishes and her father who swears that ""No one loves her more than me,"" just goes on bandying about sleeping with a woman and carrying on as if his pregnant little girl hasn't gone missing. Then there is this business about the basement drug house he and his disgusting just pukingly disgusting druggie sons are manufacturing that is the parallel storyline. Oh and I almost forgot about the paradise women. The whole thing is a meandering farce and the police are so dodgy it's as if there is no police. Such an insult. After the violence to the dog. I could no longer watch. It seemed as though the entire series each episode goes a little something like this:

Shot of Beautiful landscape
People speaking unintelligibly about unrelated matters
Ugly Unrelated Graphic Violent Scene of no relation or importance
End of episode

Next episode
Shot of beautiful scenery gorgeous forests what have you
People speaking in whispers
Holly Hunter being weird while a bunch of women sit around her on mattresses on the floor sipping tea like she is their savior and 2nd coming.
Sudden unrelated graphic violence
End of episode
And so on and so forth.

Why a bunch of women just up and follow Holly Hunters character is beyond me. Far far beyond anything I would ever do. Then again I prefer living in an actual building as opposed to a galvanized metal storage container out in the middle of nowhere.

And it goes on or like how may episodes, and at the end it is completely rushed, with no real resolution/consequences etc.  The whole situation with Johnno is ridiculous as well-why fall for such a loser? She behaves completely out of character, or any sane human response, after meeting with Matt.  David Wenham puts in a solid performance with what he has to work with, but the end is ridiculous.
