It really does show the top talent in the US, and how the MLS really does produce some great players. I was still very satisfied with Game Breakers, and I hope they put out a second one soon with some of the current players. Great buy for MLS fans!",1267142400,,354,4.298507462686567
8263652,2,B0016OKR20,"If you are looking to find out more about the players and their lives, maybe doing a wiki search is better than this video. This movie does contain highlights and interviews, but I was looking to learn more about the players' personal life, attended clubs, and success stories. I just saw the video and I already forgot half of the stars mentioned. I did not even walk away knowing more about Beckham or even Donovan, who is my favorite and the reason I bought the DVD. It is not a bad documentary but you should not use this movie if you are looking to walk away more informed about these players. It was also semi-short and it lacked xtra features. However, go MLS!",1264032000,,667,4.430894308943089
