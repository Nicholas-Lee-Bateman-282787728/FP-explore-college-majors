1237151,5,B00000JQV6,"This video is so cool!! GEt it!! It's like MTV's Real World but with the Spice girls. They talk about being home sick, stage trouble, GERI, and other things. I urge you to get it!",934416000,2,179,4.142857142857143
1237152,4,B00000JQV6,"Well, I would have liked to seen more of Chicago, and more of the performances. I was a little disappointed in how they mocked the US and the people. And I really hated the people that they chose to interview in the  US. It is not their fault, but the interviewer seemed to pick the worst  people possible to interview. But overall it was very informative to watch.  It would have gotten 5 stars if there were more performances. Maybe if they  sowed one full performance from each state they went to..... But I LOVE the  Spice Girls",934243200,,532,4.387755102040816
1237173,5,B00000JQV6,"I loved this video! I am possibly the biggest Spice fan on the planet, and I own every Spice video ever made. This, however, is my favorite. It showed a lot of the girls' real personalities, even Mel G.'s, dispite the fact she  refused to be in most of the video! I love Emma and Mel C.! Rock on!",941500800,6,296,4.016949152542373
1237174,5,B00000JQV6,"The Spice Girls new video is Girl Power packed, funny and entertaining all at the same time. It's like Spice World, but not scripted! This movie rocks!",934588800,3,151,4.62962962962963
7913266,5,B00000JQV6,"I bought this after reading Victoria's book, ""Learning to Fly"". It covers the period in which this video was recorded and they make great companion pieces. I highly recommend both of them.",1258070400,,188,4.90625
7913267,5,B00000JQV6,"This was a beautifully made Spice film. Unlike most of their fans I quite enjoy the Spice Girls as a foursome. I thought Geri was the least talented and least attractive of the bunch. I really enjoyed this documentary because the we get a more personal view into the girl's lives and personalities. Anyway, all Spice fans should definitely add this video to their collections.",1177891200,,376,4.8
7913268,4,B00000JQV6,"I'm writing this review a bit late.  I had this tape since it's release date.  I liked this tour story. It wasn't the best that they've released. The storyline follows them from every city and gives you a glimpse of what it was like for them in America--and without Geri (""Ginger"").  It includes a lot of clips of the fans talking before the concert and what they expect the concert will be like. ""One Hour of Girl Power"" is better, IMO.",1100822400,2,437,4.37037037037037
7913269,5,B00000JQV6,"I like the video so much they should have on DVD by now!
So take notice.",1074988800,3,72,3.5625
7913270,3,B00000JQV6,This is a Fantastic video thoughit isn't as good as Spiceworld video this is a video for spice girl fans who like everything about them. Posh and Ginger are my favourite spice girls.,1061856000,,182,4.545454545454546
7913271,4,B00000JQV6,"This is a very real look into the Spice Girl's life.  Not just as Scary, Baby, Posh, & Sporty but, as Melanie B, Emma, Victoria, & Melanie C.  The real 4 girls behind the smoke and mirrors.  So if you think you know the real Spicy 4. Think again!",1061683200,2,246,3.979591836734694
7913272,4,B00000JQV6,"The Spice Girls latest official video is supposed to be an uplifting video, like the images they try to portray, though ""Spice Girls In America: A Tour Story"" is just a depressing film. 80% of it is filled with the Girls complaining about how they want to go home.
There are the good moments in the tape, like on-film crying (always good), the Girls showing up late for photoshoots, and the Girls recording thier 1998 smash hit ""Goodbye"" (which can be found on their latest album 'Forever' due out November 7th, 2000).",970617600,6,518,4.641304347826087
7913273,5,B00000JQV6,"This movie is the best official one to come out yet!  It brings you  backstage, lets you meet the dancers, the crew, shows you how they set up  the stage and behind the scenes rehersals.  It shows photo shoots, stage  outfits and all the rest!  They don't play any music videos like the others  but it is a great one still.  In this one you get to actually hear family  and friends talk about them!  I would recommend this movie to any true  Spice Girls fan!",965779200,10,458,4.209302325581396
7913274,5,B00000JQV6,"If you went to a Spice Girls concert, and don`t have any memories from it, you have to buy this video! It`s a must for Spice Girls fan...",952992000,6,137,3.9285714285714284
7913275,5,B00000JQV6,"If you want to go on a interesting journey with the spice girls this is it. You really get to see how they feel, understand, and look at things through out the whole video. Find out why Geri left and how they felt, the  girls met Madonna, and really see them as who they really are and you  actually start to feel with them and understand. If u r looking 4 full  length versions of your favorite spice girls songs, then this is not your  kind of tape. See at first that is why I got it but, they do show them live  some preforming lady is a vamp, say you'll be there, Viva Forever and they  actually show them recording the Goodbye song. Shows Emma crying cause of  problems of touring,  also shows Mel G (may I say Mel B again she is  getting a Divorce) crying about Geri leaving , she busted out right after  recording  it, and shows Mel C getting really angry about news reporters  and them being gossip about, and shows a funnier side of Victoria also  shows her Husband David. I am a guy and I am not afraid to say I enjoy  the  Girls and wish them luck in whatever they do since Geri has a solo album,  also Mel C does , Mel B is still working on hers but, I heard singles she  has done already like I want U back featuring Missy Elliot, And Emma is  working on one to and she goes as the same as scary she has released  singles like the remake of the 80's song What I am it is awesome!  and  she has also started acting by the why I love Baby Spice. As for posh she  will also start a solo album down the road and just to let u know if u  don't know now she was supposed to leave the spice girls cause of her life  and she wanted to take care of her baby but, when Geri left she really  couldn't cause well hey that would had look really good if u get what I am  saying. But if U really want to get to Know the real SPICE GIRLS this video  is the best!",946425600,16,1859,3.9010695187165774
