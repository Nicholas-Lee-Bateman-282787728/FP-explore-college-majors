1992373,1,B0001DCYGE,This is not the whole movie.  It's just a preview of the first few minutes.  The listing is deceptive; a preview should be free. For $3 rental charge I expect to rent the whole movie.,1360368000,,183,4.2
1992374,1,B0001DCYGE,"This movie sucked from start to finish!!

1992375,4,B0001DCYGE,"I was skeptical despite the good reviews; but they were well earned. After a 10 minutes or so of watching; the time it takes for your eyes to adjust to the dimness of the setting and the fly on the wall method of cinematography; one cannot help but be shocked, but more importantly curious about the decadence of this marketplace of the flesh. This nagging itch pulls you effortlessly through the rest of the movie. The entire story unfolds within the confines of one cinema in the EU (for the main characters are from different European Nation States). Almost all the characters are gay, bisexual or transgender. While we are privy to the sounds of sex acts both on and off the silver screen nudity is rare because 75% of it is within the shadowy world that defines a typical movie auditorium and associated rest room. If you're a prude or a virgin, you're likely to be lost as to what the characters are up to while esconsced in the castle walls that are the seat backrests. There are some frank and heart to heart dialogues between characters and this mostly happens in the ticket booth. Overall though, the movie is taciturn one since the typical cinema patron knows what he came for and its likely the guy sitting in the next seat knows too.",1350086400,4,1246,4.542222222222223
1992376,4,B0001DCYGE,"If you are thinking Porn Theatre is a more erotic, arousing side of porn movies in the theatre, you are mistaken.  What the director writer Jacques Nolot has brought to the screen is an intruding peek into the audience, and very very little of the movie on the screen.  What we are privy to is a day/night in the life of a decaying porn theatre in France, seedy characters, namely drag queens, cross dressers, straight and homosexual men, married men, lonely souls, in their peripetic wanderings of the theatre seeking perfunctory satisfaction and aimless affection.

Really, there is nothing erotic or pleasurable to watch, and if you fall in the field of normalcy for porn, this is not for you.  Fortunately, it does not get too strange, but strange it is, rather shocking behavior, with some graphic scenes.  It is more of a sociological peek into what many people as the unknown.

The film is NOT meant to be entertaining, pleasurable, or amusing, nor adventurous.  Although most people have an inkling what a porn theatre is like, most would be very surprised comparing this French theatre to their hometown porn theatre.  (Edit) There may still be some porn theatres in cities, but I'm sure they serve the lost souls wandering the streets.  Computers seem to have replaced them.

The main character, the ticket taker observes and knows plenty about the returning patrons.  She is there to chat with and she and the projectionist and various patrons discuss their feelings, lonliness and curiosity too.

Go ahead, take a peek; it won't bite.  Rizzo",1260057600,2,1553,4.8816793893129775
1992377,4,B0001DCYGE,"My brother questioned my taste in movies when he saw this DVD in our apartment, but after viewing it- I am glad that I did!  The director takes us out of ""common decency"" and into a Parisian adult cinema to view the comings and goings of the crowd and their guide- an Italian woman of advanced age selling tickets, the only employee.  Beyond the visible sex and nudity (nothing like this in American cinema!), there are many stories of human longing.  People who desire the touch and intimacy that only another person can give them, but fear gets in the way.  Fear of infection, fear of learning about one's true self, fear of being left alone again....the list goes on and on.  No one group is focused on- there are soldiers, transgendered people, gay, straight, bisexual, all walks of life.  Because desire is the same across the board- desire to be loved, to be touched, to be aroused, to arouse, and to make that human connection that often seems to escape us.  Kudos to the people behind this film- it is truly an intelligent, beautiful and provoking look at human nature.",1177545600,18,1077,4.607329842931938
1992378,5,B0001DCYGE,"I watched this a couple of months ago as part of John Waters' film series.  While some other reviewers found it to be depressing and boring at times, I found it fascinating throughout.

The various representations of human sexuality certainly give one plenty to ponder.  No American movie could ever be this frank and non-judgmental about such topics.

The sexual situations can be rather explicit, but if that is the impetus in viewing, you will be disappointed.  Think more along the lines of _Sex, Lies, and Videotape._",1155600000,4,522,4.954022988505747
1992379,4,B0001DCYGE,"Unlike the other reviewers, I enjoyed a glimpse into the quiet lives of desperation these characters lead.  Depressing and unappealing at times?  Yes.  But that's life.  It's what isn't said that makes this movie work.  Thank God Europeans can still make films in which nothing explodes into fiery oblivion or pretty boys preen and rule the roost.  I viewed this twice in a row and found the second time even more rewarding.  Look between the lines, and you'll find that the search for human connection comes in different shapes and forms.",1121126400,17,539,4.857142857142857
1992380,1,B0001DCYGE,"This film runs on for much too long and is not for the faint of heart. I'm not referring to some of the sexual acts between the men but the half naked or fully naked transvestites who caused my skin to creep. The goings on at this theatre become repetitive and despite some touches about contemporary French society, it remains a movie that doesn't really have a point. ""Weird things can happen in a porno theatre""; I think we already knew that.  This was hardly an expose of ""Peyton Place"" type proportions.  The lives of the three people talking outside the theatre was interesting but even those characters really weren't developed enough and basically boiled down to an older man lusting after a young straight guy.  If you overlook this film, trust me, you'll lead a long and happy life and not feel you've missed anything.",1081987200,12,828,4.657534246575342

A look behind the scenes at a porn theatre in France.  If gay male sex is disturbing or offensive, move along to another title.",1448668800,2,305,4.280701754385965
