8706617,1,B00UGQCON4,I have this on VHS which is fine but this DVD version is a BAD MASTER & most definitely defective! Constant AUDIO STATIC & PICTURE ROLLING throughout documentary. I would be embarrassed if I was the one responsible for this DVD production. Obviously someone did not care enough to check the master DVD before production of this classic on DVD. Don't waste your money fans unless you can put up with HIGH AUDIO STATIC and can deal with ROLLING PICTURE.,1513296000,,451,4.65
