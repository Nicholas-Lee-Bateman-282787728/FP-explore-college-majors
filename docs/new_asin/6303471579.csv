660661,4,6303471579,"For those who may read...please check the three other reviews also enjoyable on this site. This gem from '77 was the seminal movie experience I had as a young teenager. It actually made me want to become an actor! You had York leading the way as ""Andrew Braddock""...curious, intelligent and completely empathetic. Then there was Burt (""dandy"" as Judith Christ called him) as the doc of evil machinations. Then supporting the duo were Davenport, Basehart, and the exquisitely lovely Barbara Carrera. This was probably workman director Don Taylor's best film. The scenery-lensed by Gerry Fisher-is gorgeous, Laurence Rosenthal's music score also one of his very best. (That haunting English horn...) The French loved this, but the American critics and audience were much more tepid. I think it's a well-made and intelligent adventure, which raises some serious issues at the same time providing first class entertainment. Lancaster and York made a handsome duo. I loved this remake, and will never forget that dinghy in the  open water as the film begins...",971222400,21,1055,5.205882352941177

660786,4,6303471579,"I am a massive fan of Island of Lost Souls, the 1932 version of H.G. Wells story and starring the inimitable Charles Laughton. It was dark, malevolent and a total visual and sensory feast. This tries to be something similar but just does not hit the mark. The story is that one man gets washed up on this unchartered island  Andrew Braddock played by Michael York. He is taken in and shown hospitality by the facilities owner the title named Dr. Moreau  played almost downbeat by Burt Lancaster.

Moreau is ably assisted by the gravelly yet mellifluous Nigel Davenport  who always made his roles seem more important than they really were. It turns out Dr Moreau is experimenting with the base work of God himself by trying too turn mere base animals into men. Alas they keep on failing and so the island is littered with manimals. These are held in check by The Sayer of the Law who recites a sort of condensed Ten Commandments for furry men type things  that enforces Moreaus twisted idea that they are actually men. This is played by Richard Basehart who I remember best for being the Admiral in the long time running TV show Voyage to the bottom of the sea.

Well in a twist from the book here Moreau decides that Braddock would make a great subject for reverse engineering and so sets about turning him into an animal to see where he is going wrong. Now cue the fun, games love interest (which is very shoe horned in) and the house of pain.

Now this has all the right ingredients in that there are good actors, the story is a corker and there is some great make up  this was after the incredible success of The Planet of the Apes franchise and we liked too see our stars fully made up. However, it is very much less than the sum of its parts. I think it loses a lot of atmosphere  that was prevalent in Island of lost souls  as this is mostly filmed in the open in daylight. There is no mood enhanced by lighting and the make up is so good that the actors as animals do not get to use their animal eyes. That is my guess but despite this being not as good it is still a worthwhile watch even after all these years and is certainly better than the Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando effort that was to come after this. So not the best or indeed the worst and still packs a bit of a punch, but one with a furry paw.",1451433600,,2312,4.257990867579909

660857,5,6303471579,"A chilling tale of how to go wrong.  Surprising evil  character portrayal by Lancaster.  It could also be described as innocents abroad until the secret of the island is discovered.  It is a kind of reality that boggles the mind and the mind refuses to believe such evil is possible.  Of course, we see  evil  all the time in the current news reports here and overseas.  Perhaps we are immune to evil due to repetition, repetition, repetition,  or just block it off cause evil is too horrible to be actual. I gave 5 stars because the character is unlike any that Lancaster did.  His intention was good but the result became evil.  So beware.",1438473600,,641,4.535087719298246

660904,3,6303471579,"There have been three versions of H.G. Wells' cautionary science fiction story made for the big screen. None of them have been perfect but, of the three, ""Island of Lost Souls"" from 1933 probably remains the best version out there (although it isn't completely faithful to Wells story anymore than the two that followed).

The 1978 version of the film featuring Burt Lancaster as Moreau and Michael York as our hero Braddock who ends up stranded on Moreau's island which provides him with the perfect environment to experiment on animals without interference from society.

Director Don Taylor does a solid job with this second film versions And it holds up very well nearly forty years on. Surprisingly faithful to much of Wells' themes, ""Island"" got mixed reviews at the time but received considerable praise for its groundbreaking make up (probably one of the reasons Taylor was hired was his experience directing ""Escape From The Planet of The Apes"" and ""Night Gallery""). Taylor was well suited to dealing with a high powered star like Lancaster as he got his start as an actor and worked his way up as a director working with a variety of actors in Television and film. Taylor manages to balance the demands of the Wells' story (adapted for the screen by Al Ramus and John Herman Shaner) and the studio's need for more action in the story.

One of the flaws of the film is the lack of character development. I suspect that there was more in the original script (something I would expect from the screenwriters both of whom began as actors before moving into writing and production) but that it was probably sacrificed during rewrites by the demands of action from the studio.

The casting works very well with York (""Logan's Run"" , ""Austin Powers"") bringing vitality to his role. He more than holds his own against Lancaster on screen. Nigel Davenport (a marvelous character actor who appeared in films as varied as ""Chariots of Fire"" to the cult classic ""Phase IV"") provides gravitas in his role as Moreau's assistant in his experiments push evolution forward.

Barbara Carrera and Richard Basehart round out the cast. Basehart does a marvelous job as the Sayer of The Law.

Kino's transfer receives a mixed looking transfer. The scenes set outdoors look positively lush with nice depth, details and colors that pop. The scenes set inside or that take place during the evenings aren't as strong with uneven consistency in terms of colors and a generally muddy look to them. I don't know how the latter scenes could be improved without a full restoration (unlikely to happen due to the cost and interest in the film) and, while these scenes leave a lot to be desired,money don't necessarily look bad. Either way the Blu-Ray high definition transfer is an improvement over the previous released DVD.

Audio sounds fine with dialog clear for the most part and English subtitles are provided for the feature.

As far as extras go, they are a bit limited. There evidently was an alternate ending version that played n network TV that I've never seen. We don't get that but we do get a still from that slightly different ending. There are also original theatrical trailers for the film provided. I see to recall that there was an EPK featurette that layed on Tav back in the day to promote the film that focused on the make up effects (my memory is s bit fuzzy here though). I don't know that this exists any longer (and it's certainly possible that I may be conflating two different resurrected) and I know when I looked for it on YouTube, I was t able to find any reference to it.

While this high definition transfer does leave a bit to be desired in some areas, the film looks pretty good all things considered and is a sleep up from the DVD. Fans of the film will generally be pleased.",1437264000,,3790,4.712990936555891
660905,3,6303471579,Not as good as the first.,1434412800,,25,3.3333333333333335
660906,4,6303471579,"A lot of the reviews posted for this movie are likely to leave a casual shopper very confused: Some will call it a classic, some will call it dated, and a LOT will confuse it with the completely different 1996 Brando/ Kilmer production.  The highest praise I can offer is that I remembered it from a single viewing on TV in the late 1980s or early '90s.  Watching it again, it would be easy to pick it apart for its flaws, especially its dated effects and a weak, intrusive human-manimal romance that fails even to explore its own squirm-worthy implications.  But what stands out is its impressively grim tone, which is in many ways strengthened by its clearly modest budget.  Its greatest strength is that, for the most part, the film makers allow Wells' fable to play out without giving into the temptation of technological twists or sanitary moralizing.  What remains is a timeless, searing picture of  ideals pitted against entropy.",1433548800,,936,4.782608695652174
660907,4,6303471579,"This 1977 version of HG Wells The Island of Dr. Moreau is an adventure/drama/sci-fi film about a shipwreck survivor, Andrew Braddock (Michael York), who finds himself on a remote Pacific island where mysterious things are happening. Dr. Moreau (Burt Lancaster) governs the island with his the cynical associate Montgomery (Nigel Davenport). Barbara Carrera is on hand as the doctors ravishing woman, Maria, but theres something decidedly strange about her.

The best thing about this movie is the mounting mystery of the first half. Once the mystery is fully unveiled it becomes uninteresting, mainly due to the storytelling, but the somewhat lame mid-70s creature make-up doesnt help. The latters reminiscent of the ape F/X of the original Planet of the Apes (1968) applied to other beasts. However, this is to be expected since it came out in the mid-70s.

The St. Croix locations (US Virgin Islands) are another huge positive. The film doesnt skimp out on showing the natural beauty of the area, which the 96 version did with Cairns, Queensland. Needless to say, the movies a must for those who like island adventure/dramas.

Lancaster is outstanding as the visionary doctor obsessed with genetics. Whereas Brando played the part as an utter eccentric  and Marlon is always entertaining  Burt plays the character low-key but with great underlying passion and is therefore more interesting. A good example is when Moreau asks Braddock with scientific zeal, How does a cell become enslaved to a form, to a destiny it can never change? Can we change that destiny? Braddock understandably replies, Should we? Disappointed, Moreau immediately dismisses himself. Later, the doctor reveals the extents that he is willing to go for the sake of scientific progress when he exclaims, If one is to study nature, one must become as remorseless as nature. This is his weakness and downfall, the fact that the attainment of his goals transcends universal morality.

Yet, the first half paints him in an almost admirable light. We see a visionary palpably excited about the altruistic prospects of his work, like removing deformities. So Moreaus goals are definitely benevolent. Not to mention, anyone with an inkling of vision can relate to his statement (paraphrasing): People of vision often become outcasts.

Then theres the mysterious and exotically beautiful Maria. Read the spoiler section below for a revelation about her thats more obvious in other versions of the story.

Davenport is also effective as the alcoholic mercenary, Montgomery. His response to Braddocks initial inquiry about what kind of animals are on the island is notable.  Amused at the question, Montgomery cackles: All kinds, Lad; all kinds (ending with a disturbing laugh with loads of hidden meaning).

The score by Laurence Rosenthal is worth citing as its haunting and befits the time period of the story, the late 1800s. Interestingly, the score was clearly ripped off (sort of) by James Horner for the even better music of 1981s Wolfen.

There are also some interesting subtexts: The humanimals who get to live in Dr. Moreau's compound are more human-like in appearance than the animals living in the smelly humanimal cave in the forest. Consider, for instance, the almost palace-like lifestyle of the most human-looking one compared to the others. Wouldn't this lead to tensions between the factions? While Moreau is a benevolent dictator he's still a dictator and dictators are rarely good. Another potent theme is the importance of genuineness in governing authorities. Once Moreau is disobeys his own law, the humanimals revolt.

Unfortunately, I cant give it a higher rating for two important reasons. One, the storytelling isn't compelling and therefore the overall effect of the movie is mild amusement. However, the climax is pretty spectacular, particularly a couple of memorable images that I don't want to give away. The second reason is noted below.

The film runs 99 minutes.

GRADE: B- (a strong 3/5 Stars or weak 4/5 Stars)

***SPOILER ALERT*** Dont read further unless youve seen the movie.

When Braddock and Maria are discovered by a ship at the end and its clear that Braddock has reverted back to full-human after days at sea, the original version of the movie reveals that Maria was actually another one of Moreaus experiments and was reverting back to being a panther! This is clear if you look at one of the films pics shown on IMDb, but there is no image like this in the DVD version of the film (which I assume means the original theatrical version as well, but some dispute this). So its clear that the producers nixed the original ending for a stereotypical happy one. IDIOTS!",1433030400,,4676,5.0928104575163395

660951,4,6303471579,"NOTE: THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE 1977 FILM.  This is the second film adaptation of H. G. Wells' great 19th century novel.  The film stars Burt Lancaster as Moreau, Michal York as Andrew Braddock, Nigel Davenport as Montgomery and the yummy Barbara Carrera as Maria.  Moreau is a well renowned scientist who left the mainstream and settled on a remote Pacific island.  He is carrying out unethical experiments where he mixes the genetics of humans with a variety of animals, both domestic and wild.  Montgomery is the man in charge of running the operations and the island.  Braddock has managed to survive days at sea in a rowboat after his ship wrecked.  He was the ship's engineer.  After he washes ashore, he is taken in by Montgomery and Moreau.

Unlike the other films of the book, Lancaster's Moreau seems relatively sane at the beginning, providing a sense of comfort.  Braddock seems to feel the same, especially after he and Moreau's adopted daughter Maria, get comfy.  York is a good choice as this character.  Alas, Braddock's inquisitive nature discovers that Moreau has been playing God with the lives of the creatures who have adapted human-like abilities, including speech.  Richard Basehart is excellent as the leader of the creatures, known as the ""Sayer of the Law.""

This version of the novel excels at some harrowing chase sequences as Braddock tries to elude the hybrids.  While not a true horror film, it is certainly more so than the 1996 remake.  Frankly, I was a bit surprised.  While the film shows some of style of the 70's in many ways, it is also exciting and at times sexy without being explicit (PG rating).

To compare the 3 versions of the film, certainly the original 1932 version renamed ""The Island of Lost Souls"" is a near masterpiece (4.5 stars) with Charles Laughton, Richard Arlen and Bela Lugosi in key roles.  The 1996 version with Marlon Brando, Val Kilmer and David Thewlis is terrible (2.5 stars) and is only worth seeing for its camp value.  I read recently where this '77 film is going to come out in a new Blu ray edition from Kino.  It's one I'll want to see.",1425859200,8,2105,4.69672131147541

All are fun for sci fi and horror fans.  Good escapism and enjoyable way to spend some time.  In this version Lancaster really gets into the character of Dr. Moreau, a doctor that believes scientific discovery is all that matters and everything else that happens doesn't matter. He is venturing into the early years of gene splicing and genetic altering by trying to change animals into humans on his own private island out in the middle of the Pacific.  Michael York plays a young British engineer who has survived a ship sinking and washed ashore on the island.  Nigel Davenport and Barbara Carrera do good jobs also.  Good cast of human/animal creatures with Richard Basehart solid as the Sayer Of The Law.  A good watch.",1425600000,3,926,4.75

i do enjoy the 1995 remake with Marlon Brando, but this 1977 version is the Ultimate classic
Kino Lorber gave the film some respect with a new 1:85:1 HD transfer 8/10 quality
the new transfer does look very nice sharp & clear picture quality not much Grain or Dirt, much better than the old MGM dvd version
the sound quality is a new 2.0 master stereo mix which again sound lot better than the old Mono sound mix
i think a 5.1 mix should've been added as an option, but the 2.0 mix still sounds lot better than the old Mono sound
about 5/10 for the sound
EXTRAS
the only special features shown on the back cover is the original Theatrical trailer so i clicked on Bonus
and there is another extra but just the usual Theatrical trailer 2mins & the extended trailer 5mins
the so called extended trailer is 5min TV promo with on set interviews with Director Don Taylor, Michael York & Burt Lancaster
plus a very rare still Photo of Barbara carrera in CAT make up with her contact Lenses & fangs
scared the hell out of me when i pressed enter on the photo
this still Photo was suppose to be filmed as the last scene just before the credits rolled
but for some reason tragically was not filmed
very tragic there's no new interviews with Michael York or Barbara carrera or an Audio commentary at least
but still these few more extras are better than what the old MGM DVD had
the old MGM DVD is worth nothing worth throwing in the trash
definitely time to upgrade buy this new blu-ray reissue
4 stars for the film, full 3 stars for this new blu-ray reissue based on new upgraded transfer quality & some new extras",1413158400,5,1702,4.338557993730408

661140,4,6303471579,"The (1978) film version Island of Dr. Moreau is VERY accurate to the novel. As is often done with Hollywood makeovers, a few shortcuts were added, and therefore explanations are not always cohesive...

The fine-acting cast Burt Lancaster as Dr. Moreau, Nigel Davenport as Montgomery,  Micheal York as Andrew Braddock, and Barbara Carrera as the local lovely lass, Maria, really sell the mystery, and curiosity surrounding the island creatures. Some stunning stunts are to be seen in the finale sequence.

The FACE-MAKEUP is VERY DATED, as advancements have been refined in movies ad nauseum. So this does come across as guys wearing masks a lot. There are some nice actors behind the masks in general, and they also sell the behaviors, bull-man, monkey-man, Leopard-man, etc. A modest suspension of reality, and even these creatures can enthrall...

The lush jungle locale, and primative fencing, instill a remoteness...while a Colonial-esque villa implies a formerly abandoned site. The love scene between York and Carerra is sensual, and well-lighted...as well as the revelation Moreau knows....

NOW ABOUT MY VHS COPY: (boo...)
This is one of the last of the paranoid studio releases (1990-ish,) and as such the COPY PROTECTION is so strongly applied the movie is nearly unwatchable, as a tracking overide is needed, to regain the picture every approx. 12 minutes.

The casting for this version is brilliant: accordingly, Lancaster is the closest to the WELLS description of the Dr. in the book, and his performance is stellar as only he can be...

York is innocent and endearing as the castaway, and Davenport is perfectly cynical with a touch of neutral evil...

HOWEVER, pay close attention to Basehart's portrayal of The Sayer Of The Law... his performance is unprecedented... torn between what he was (an animal) and what he is striving to be (a man, a leader, a mentor, a symbol for justice and righteousness among his peers), he delivers a powerful performance which was sadly overlooked by the academy... what more can you expect from this gifted actor who portrayed Admiral Nelson (""Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea"") AND Ishamel (""Moby Dick"")... the culmination of his performance elicited what I rarely experience from a motion picture: tears...

Michael York, at the peak of popularity following the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Musketeers/dp/6305037264/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Musketeers</a>&nbsp;films, plays shipwreck survivor Andrew Braddock who washes ashore an isolated island in the Pacific. He encounters the fortified compound of Dr. Moreau (Burt Lancaster), a menacing presence with an interest in science and floppy hats. Braddock soon notices deformed servants, eerie howls from the jungle and a laboratory where Moreau burns the midnight oil. An assistant, the mercenary rogue Montgomery (Nigel Davenport), keeps to himself and drinks a lot. There's also the lovely Maria (Barbara Carrera), an oddly distant and confused woman who Moreau coddles with great care. Maria and Braddock have their eyes on each other and when they finally consummate their attraction, with the doctor eerily looking on, the candle-lit scenes are surprisingly sexy.

The film builds towards none-too-shocking revelations as Braddock discovers Moreau is conducting genetic altering experiments on animals of the island. The experiments have not succeeded, and Moreau's paradise is inhabited by menacing tribes of mutant animal/men shuffling around in jungle shadows.

When Braddock finally stumbles upon the cave of human beasts, we are introduced to lionmen, tigermen and bearmen, oh my! The makeup is about as complex as Lon Chaney, Jr.'s turn as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wolf-Man/dp/B00001TZ6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wolf Man</a>, but no matter. You feel genuine sympathy for the creatures. Richard Basehart's performance as ""Sayer of the Law,"" a role Bela Lugosi played in the original, is excellent. Things take a turn for the creepy as Braddock becomes a prisoner of Moreau's experiments, leading to the film's most intense scenes.

If in the right mood, there's great fun to be found in ""The Island of Dr. Moreau."" I liked Moreau's compound, a tropical oasis barely holding back the vines of the menacing jungle. The movie is served well by the location filming in the Virgin Islands. The direction of TV veteran Don Taylor is adequate, with several jump-from-your-seat scare scenes popular in the day. The conclusion feels abrupt, as Braddock and Maria frantically attempt to escape the chaos of the island. It's abundantly clear Maria is one of Moreau's experiments (her character was a panther woman in the original). In fact, producers unwisely changed the original ending where she reverts to animal form. If you look closely, the final shot of Maria shows her face to be misshapen, with a quick edit creating the weak illusion of a happy ending.

Oh well, this is a great discovery for lovers of old-fashioned horror films, with the fine work of Lancaster and York giving this tale an enjoyable touch of class.",1230595200,3,4339,7.148496240601504
661148,4,6303471579,"Based on the H.G. Wells' 1896 novel, this film ventures into the realms of human eugenics and genetic alterations.  Based on the evolutionary tenets, the film speeds up the cosmic time table in producing men from animals in a short span of days

Like all created societies, the law must be given by the lawgiver.  Dr. Moreau is the creator and lawgiver.  The chimeras revere him as their god.

All is harmonious until Andrew Braddock washes a shore. He falls in love with the mysterious Maria who has a strange connection to Dr. Moreau and the island. Braddock begins questioning the research of Moreau.

The tension between the two men builds until the tragic climax.

After Moreau murders Montgomery, the caretaker of the compound, the chimeras begin to question their god.  Montgomery had reached his point of human morality and challenged Moreau.  Sometimes, when a person takes a stand on moral principle, it results in their death.

The Sayer of the Law, played brilliantly by Richard Baseheart, is the leader of the chimeras who repeats the law given by Moreau.  The cadence of their recitation is very haunting.

The ending of the film is a sad commentary on the noble scientist who wanted to benefit humanity, but in the end his own arrogance and self deification led to the tragic lost of his humanity and paradise.

Burt Lancaster is in top form as Moreau. He seems to relish the part.

Braddock, played by Michael York, is the moral compass in the film.  The struggle between animal and man is brilliantly portrayed by Braddock after he is injected with Moreau's experimental biological serum.

661207,5,6303471579,"An Englishman named 'Montgomery' is stranded with a lost companion on a deserted tropical island where he is rescued by Dr. Moreau, a genius in genetics, pursuing altruistic medical miracles to alleviate mankind from incurable maladies, although his methods are questioned, but it is maintained that the ends justify the means. He continues to make strides to this effect until perfidiously antagonistic organisms deem to thwart his noble efforts, who eventually become subjects themselves for his experiments, thus contributing far more to his vision rather than merely complaining about it.

Down in the jungle outside of his compound reside some of his genetic creations, man-beasts, veritable 'humanimals' of various species, from a bearman, boarman, to hyenaman, lionman, tigerman, bullman, and a monkeyman who is ""The Sayer of The Law""* {small portion follows}:

""Not to go on all fours: this is the law. Are we not men?""

""Not to show our fangs in anger. Are we not men?""

""Not to snarl or roar. That is the Law. Are we not men?""

""What Is The Law? Not to shed the blood of another man. That is the law.""

An obvious treatise on civility to temper impulsive feral proclivities. Those beastmen who violate this law are taken to ""The House of Pain"" for 'correction'... for Moreau elucidates that if this discipline is not enforced, the beastmen would run wild and surely kill their human counterparts. Much like the lion who must not be allowed to overtake the master even in jest, lest he begin to dominate the trainer.

What this film demonstrates is the necessary realization and connection to one's natural animalistic state, lest imbalance tranform the denier into a broken creature. Dr. LaVey's infamous quote comes to mind:

""There is a beast in man that should be exercised, not exorcised.""

One particularly notable scene depicts the stubbornly independant bullman fighting for his mental freedom, as he denies 'the law' and questions what is so wrong with realizing that one is an animal? Out in the bush, he vanquishes tiger with the obvious shedding of blood, and thereby becomes subject to the punishments of The House of Pain, but would rather run free and even die than suffer that indignity. Sadly for him, the consequence is lethal at the gunpoint of Montgomery, which then begins to raise other questions in the minds of the beastmen, as they slowly begin to realize the double-standards and hypocrisies enacted by the humans, in a likened ""do as I say, not as I do"" scenario, which does not sit well with them at all, and they begin to revolt. Revolution is the first step to evolution.

Beautiful resident orphan Maria {the gorgeous brunette Barbara Carrera} who was also rescued by Moreau as a child falls in lust with Montgomery, and remains with him through his transformation into manimal at the hands of Moreau, after he displays inclinations towards betrayal, and becomes an experiment, as his senses and instincts sharpen, excellerated pilose generation, legs to haunches, with an incessant desire to kill prey for food, but he remains in control of his civility nonetheless. She helps him escape the cage, the natives from thereon become restless as the mutiny scene develops, the ingrates set the compound aflame, with their maker placed in a suspended supine crucifixion.

Montgomery and Maria finally boat off to modern civilization.

661213,4,6303471579,"Samuel Z. Arkoff, venerable producer of B sci-fi/horror flicks, presents this straightforward version of the H. G. Wells story. The best thing this flick has going for it is Burt Lancaster as Moreau. Moreau conducts forbidden experiments in vivisection, tampering with the genetics of animals. Moreau soon converts to evil action after shipwrecked Braddock (Michael York) stumbles into Moreau's bizarre island kingdom. The results of Moreau's failed experiments are horrific half-human/half-animal creatures that walk upright as men and howl in the distance. The best scene unfolds when Braddock finds the cave of the animal-men, and is threatened with violence. Moreau shows up tall and god-like on a convenient ledge. He commands the Sayer of the Law (Richard Basehart) to articulate the island code, ""What is the Law?"" The spitting wolf-man replies, ""Not to go on all fours. Not to shed blood. etc."" Each part of the jungle litany is answered by the refrain, ""Are we not men?"" Moreau has found through his work that the savage beast stubbornly reasserts itself. The creatures are on the brink of devolution. Worse yet, shedding blood would evoke the call of the wild on the island. ""His is the House of Pain, His the Hand that Hurts,"" is the spoken warning that keeps the manimals in line. Moreau, it seems, wields the knife to surgically correct backward evolution, but also as punishment. Increasing beastiality leads to inevitable death, violence, and decimation on the island. Delectable eye-candy, Barbara Carrera, is around for romantic interludes. There is some mild nudity. Great fun for B movie sci-fi fans. Sensible viewers beware. ;-)",1037836800,23,1648,5.222641509433962
661214,3,6303471579,"This version of the classic H.G. Wells tale is infinitely superior to the '96 remake. It sustains its reputation because, like all enduring films, it is character driven. In no way do the the creature effects, which are adequately effective, take precedence over the actors' abilities.

The scene where Braddock (Michael York), confined to a cage,  struggles to assert his willpower in recounting his childhood memories, remains a truly convincing piece of cinematic acting.

The DVD version, however, is supposedly in widescreen. That's  W--I--D--E--S--C--R--E--E--N, ladies and gentlemen. The peripheral view here has been simply narrowed, with the black bars at the top and bottom serving no other purpose than to further restrict a viewer's access to more of the original picture. Is it to censor out the fleeting exposure of Barbara Carrera's nipple? (Nah, can't be... that'd be ridiculous.)

Perhaps the persons at MGM responsible for this DVD transfer should be sent on a retraining course to better understand the concept of widescreen format. Use of the term ""widescreen"" with regards to this DVD version is basically misrepresentation. The VHS Full Screen version actually provides more picture acreage.

Regardless, the film itself succeeds well in its conveyance of the dangers of amoral scientific advancement, the subjugation of perceived inferiors, and the inhumane versus the humane, all in an entertaining manner.",1036972800,22,1430,5.4772727272727275
661215,3,6303471579,"This Late 70's update of The Island of Lost Souls ( wisely retaining H.G. Well's original title) offers up two reunions in addition to its tropical horrors. Make-up artist John Chambers reunites with Don Taylor (both having worked on Escape from the Planet of the Apes in 1971) for this tepid but watchable adaption. Post's indifferent directing sabutages numerous potential horror moments, especially in the revelation of the various Humanimals on the island. The make-up seems dated even for its time (The Apes in Planet of the Apes look better) but perhaps that is why MGM had released this under its cheesy Midnite Movies banner.
Castwise, Micheal York does a better job then most have done with that role in other film versions but Barbera Carrea's character suffers from underexposure (well, dramatically speaking) and the hints of her origins are never properly addressed in the movie. Burt Lanchaster plays a formidable and active Moreau and his performance is by far the best in the film. Worth noting, the movie reunited him with former circus buddy Nick Cravat; costar of earlier films w/ Lanchaster such as The Crimson Pirate and The Flame and the Arrow.
In comparison to other film versions, this one plays very well, albiet somewhat lackluster. Not as zany as the 1996 film and certainly an improvement on the 1933 film.
The DVD features a solid transfer although there are 2 blue film blemishes that appear very fast. The disc is pretty bare bones with only the trailer as a supplement. But for 9.99 one can not complain.
