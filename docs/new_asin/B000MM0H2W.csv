2736800,5,B000MM0H2W,"This is a fun work out that anyone with two working feet can do.  In the instructions you are taught the easiest, intermediate and advanced versions of nearly every step.  If you have bad joints or bad feet, do the easy steps, don't hop, you'll still get your heart rate up and have a good time.

This DVD will not teach you competition dance steps.  The steps are simplified, more like what you expect to see at a party or in a pub, not the intricate, advanced footwork you'll see in a show or competition.  It is designed to be fun and easy, not frustrating.  Do go through the instruction section first, and have your remote control handy, you may want to re-watch a few of the quicker steps.  I tend to be slow at picking up dance steps, if I can do this, anyone can!

I'm not sure why anyone would take stars off for the quality of the video.  The music, video and instruction are just fine.  It does not have the polished appearance of a mass produced Hollywood product, but if you watch the credits you'll see that it was very much a family production and you know what?  I'm more than happy to support such a venture.",1333152000,20,1125,4.2843601895734595
2736801,5,B000MM0H2W,"What a fun CD!! My children and I have done the basic dance steps and it is so much fun! They break the steps down into patterns one at a time and it's very easy to put them together in the end to do a jig, a reel or the highland fling! It's marvelous excercise!",1301011200,11,262,3.7818181818181817
2736802,4,B000MM0H2W,"My husband and I are in our 50's and want to keep in shape.  This video is lots of fun because you learn some of the Irish dance steps and incorporate them into an aerobics workout accompanied by Irish music.  It takes a while to learn the steps but once you do, you can go through the exercises consistently without making too many mistakes :)
With the lively music it is just fun and you do get a great workout!",1264032000,9,413,4.15
2736803,5,B000MM0H2W,"I give this dvd 5 stars because it is really fun.  If I'm feeling lazy and can't get myself to workout, I can always convince myself to do this DVD for half an hour.  When I do it, I always find that I have a big smile on my face, even while I'm working really hard and sweating profusely.

Still, this DVD has certain problems.  Be aware,  this is not an instructional DVD for Irish dance.  This is more like Jazzersize with an Irish dance theme set to Irish music.  Also, the cueing is often misleading, the dances are sometimes slightly off the beat of the music and the filming feels amateur.

However, I on the whole found this very fun and a very good workout if you incorporate all the bouncing on your toes and little jumps.  Each of the movements that they do is explained very well in a separate section.  I love it and I would buy it again and recommend it to anyone who likes the idea of working out to traditional Irish music.",1244678400,23,939,4.224719101123595
2736804,3,B000MM0H2W,"I am a dance teacher at an elementary school. I purchased this video tape because I had a substitute coming in during the week of St. Patrick's day. The video was great...for adults. Unfortunately the video goes very fast and I had to come up with an alternative video. However, when I was teaching Irish step dancing, it came in handy as a reference for myself.",1239753600,7,362,4.5
2736805,5,B000MM0H2W,"I highly recommend this exercise tape(DVD) - Irish Dance Based Aerobics! i am of irish blood and have been enjoying learning more about ""my roots"" -  including culture, which of course envelopes dance. But, even if you are not irish, and are just looking for a great way to stick to a good, fun exercise program - this is the one for you. enjoy!",1199664000,17,345,4.390625
2736806,4,B000MM0H2W,"I bought this DVD because I'm having a traditional Irish music band perform at my wedding.  I'm not a natural dancer and needed to learn some basic steps.  I was afraid the Jean Butler DVD would be too dificult for me.  This DVD is perfect for my needs.  The steps are very simple but will allow me to move to the music.  It's also a good workout, with all the bouncing up and down.  I gave it 4 stars because the production is a bit amateur.  The editing is poorly done in places.  If you already know Irish dancing, this DVD is way too simple for you.  For the rest of us with an interest in Irish culture, it's great.",1175558400,58,620,4.1
8169826,5,B000MM0H2W,"This DVD is fun! I really like doing it as my cardio for the week. It took about a week to learn the steps and now I can do the routines fine. I wish they would come out with another video that is more advanced so I could learn the steps with legs crossed like they talk about in the video. It would be nice to switch it up. There are other Irish Dancing videos I have for doing workouts at home, but their instructors do not break it down as good as this instructor, and I cannot learn the steps.

What I love about this video is the music is fun, and the instructor breaks the steps down easily. Anyone could learn. As far as the movie not being made well- I don't know what the other reviewers are seeing that I don't. I think production is just fine.",1495152000,2,754,4.026666666666666
8169827,3,B000MM0H2W,It was for beginners and I was disappointed in that it didn't actually show the Irish steps if you wanted to try them that I'd seen on You Tube. And it played very little music. I didn't feel it was worth the money I paid for it.,1493596800,2,229,3.893617021276596

8169833,3,B000MM0H2W,"I think this would be very difficult to translate this the more difficult proper form Irish step dancing.  It is fun, likable music.  But it seems appropriate for an older or less conditioned person.  If you're looking to get back into  exercise and want a moderate workout with a fun theme then I recommend it.  If you want to learn Irish step dancing, this would be frustrating.  I'll keep doing it for fun sometimes, but often reach for something else.",1375833600,3,455,4.625
8169834,4,B000MM0H2W,"This is not a learn how to Iriish dance video but an aerobic workout using Irish music and Irish dance steps.
My only complaint is that they do not do a 20 minute or 30 minute, you can either do each segment or the whole program, but one problem is that when you are doing the whole program, each segment ends with a bow, stopping your aerobic pace.
Still good for those aging Irish dancers out there who want to keep in shape.",1370908800,3,427,4.156626506024097
8169835,4,B000MM0H2W,"I love this DVD - it is fun, and useful in that if you go to a ceidli, you'll know some of the steps. It's a good half an hour cardio workout, but it doesn't do much for the upper body, but you can always just hold weights while you do it.",1344124800,2,239,3.6153846153846154
