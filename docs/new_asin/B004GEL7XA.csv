Seguir Siendo (To Continue Being) is a documentary about the remarkable Mexican alt. rock group, Caf Tacuba.  It is an ""art quality"" documentary which shows the evolution of the group over approximately their first 18 years, but not by showing endless concert footage.  It shows the relationship of the group's four members --respect and affection -- and the creative process for which they are known (worldwide) through images and interviews.  It is an intimate look at the evolution of the four musicians and of their music -- individually and as a group.  It is not even chronological.  But it is never ever boring.  I would highly recommend this documentary to anyone who listens to and appreciates the music of Caf Tacuba.  *The other reviewer should have taken up his problem (he received the wrong edition) with Amazon.

HOWEVER, the dvd is in Spanish only.  My son, who speaks only rudimentary Spanish, was able to follow it easily enough, but I'm sure he missed some good spoken parts.  Caf Tacuba always sings in Spanish, its essence is Mexican,  but the group's appeal extends to the US, Japan (as seen in the documentary) and Europe.  It would be wonderful if it had subtitles in English and perhaps Japanese, at least.  Still, the music and images transcend language.

I think this movie should be more prominently linked with the albums of Cafe Tacuba, each a critically-acclaimed reinvention of the group's amazing creativity over the course of their now twenty-four years of making music together.

Me fascina la msica y la evolucin del grupo Caf Tacvba: son creadores, siempre reinventandose.  Seguir Siendo es un documental hermoso, tambin profundo.  Ya tengo 4 o 5 veces de mirarlo... y sigo encantada. Son Mexicanos de hueso colorado, pero su msica atrae a ""fanticos"" por todo el mundo.

A pesar del queja del otro que reseo la pelicula aqui -- acerca de haber recibido una edicion equivocada (debe haber contactado a Amazon), escrib a Betamusic y fui rpdiamente asegurada de que venden la edicion correcta.  La recib en muy buen tiempo.",1363996800,,2260,5.351274787535411
8428684,3,B004GEL7XA,"First of all, this is a great movie/documentary from one of the best bands in the world. Great movie worth the price...BUT i received the wrong item. I got the original edition and I payed for the EDICION ESPECIAL like it says on the title. Once again I received the ORIGINAL copy...It comes on a CD box and not on a DVD box like the one on the picture.",1332720000,2,353,4.130434782608695
