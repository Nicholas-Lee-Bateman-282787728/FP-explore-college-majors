8474737,4,B005IGVTL0,"This video captures the Residents after Carlos's retirement and return to Mexico. Don't expect any drum solos. This version of the Residents is a power trio. Like most of their shows since, this video includes many classic tunes, including Semolina and Smelly Tongues.  It also includes many 21st century Residents tunes, including the haunting My Window.  This incarnation relies on videos more than theater. But it's still the Residents.  Only now, in 2015, it's already a nostalgia item. For, only recently, Chuck retired, and not just from his day job at the hospital. He's no longer touring with the Residents. So, this video is the closest we'll get to see Chuck perform with his mates.",1447632000,2,692,5.0
