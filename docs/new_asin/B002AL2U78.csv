8359653,2,B002AL2U78,"Frankie Stein (Jayson Spence) constructs ""The King"" (Graig Guggenheim) from various rock star body parts for his agent/producer uncle Bernie (Barry Feterman). From what I gather, he has the head of Elvis, the legs of Keith Moon, the hands of Jimi Hendrix, the butt of Sid Vicious, and something from Buddy Holly. However due to a mix up, he gets the organ of Liberace. This leads us to a film which concentrates too much sexual confusion. He leads a band called ""Unnatural Urges.""

There was so much they could have done with this film had they not wanted it to be overly gay. The dialogue was poorly constructed as were the characters. It was a let down from all the potential the film had.

8359655,4,B002AL2U78,"I knew it was a B movie when I ordered it. A lot of times Amazon reviewers are unfair I think when leaving reviews. Why compare this with a major motion picture? That said, it was a little more ""over the top"" than I expected but it is what it is. If you enjoy rude and crude B movies you may find this right up your alley. If the production values were just a bit higher I would have given it 5 stars. For example, there was no reason the actor playing the monster couldn't have shaved his head. He wears a really bad Elvis wig for most of the film anyway. The bald cap was just too fake, even for a B movie. The make up is pretty bad overall as are the costumes. The story though is not too shabby, for a B movie. A little more money and effort could have made this quite good.",1433721600,,778,3.930379746835443
8359656,5,B002AL2U78,"I love this cheesy/disturbing B Movie!!! One of the best ""Low Budget"" horror/comedys ever made...REALLY!! I've been looking for this film for years, and finally found it. If you have a fear of gore and ""unnatural urges"" this movie is not for you. Though Elvis would laugh his a$$ off at this one...LOL. ""Thank you...thank you very much""",1329177600,4,336,4.810344827586207
8359657,4,B002AL2U78,"Rock N Roll Frankenstein is a horror-comedy that is strange, pretty funny, and pretty offensive. There is probably something here to offend anyone, including a scene where a gay priest has a cross shoved up his butt. I was entertained for the most party by Rock N Roll Frankenstein, but it's not a classic by any means. It is, however, a weirdly amusing film.",1297468800,2,359,4.625
8359658,5,B002AL2U78,"If you are a fan of ""far out"" horror with a comic twist this is the film for you!  It an amazing, refreshing, and most original take on an old theme. If you love John Waters you will love this for sure.  Move over ROCK HORROR PICTURE SHOW there's a new cult classic flick in town!!! Iggy rules!!! Brian O'Hara is a genius!",1249603200,5,322,4.095238095238095
