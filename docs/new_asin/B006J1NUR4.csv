4992508,5,B006J1NUR4,"This is a series of factory tours covering a staggering variety of products, from aluminum cans to window glass to fire engines.  Fascinating to see the methods and tooling used to manufacture things.  Each product is allotted a brief 10 minute segment. Some products are simple, but others could use more time and detail.  We have all the seasons available, and when the next is released we'll get that too!",1361318400,3,408,4.8
