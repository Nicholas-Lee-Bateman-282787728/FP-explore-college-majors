8518513,5,B007JWWZ64,"Brough Scott's documentary of A Horse Called Warrior is excellent, dramatic and fascinating. His Grandfather General Seely and extraordinary horse Warrior were amazing survivors of World War One's horrors. This well-made documentary is very much superior to Spielberg's story of Warhorse, which I think is sometimes very silly.  A great sports writer and top class horseman himself, Brough reveals better than anyone else could what his Grandfather, a close friend of Sir Winston Churchill, endured in a world far different from ours.

So many horses were killed in WWI, it is unbelievable. I also purchased the book about Warrior...so glad he made it through...so sorry about his end!",1361491200,2,302,4.357142857142857
