I can't beleive it only lasted one noncomplete season. When I was 9 it felt like an eternity! I wish they had been on for many seasons, becuse it was the coolest show the 80's probably ever gave us!",1213574400,2,343,3.914285714285714
3137717,3,B00151QYT4,"...but the show's still a gem.  good transfer, clear picture, decent interview extras, nice set.  a great cast working from clever scripting that was far more adult than i remembered (my favorite has to be the 60s-era teacher who has to keep cutting off his reminiscences about drugs before the kids get wise to him).  the missing songs did diminish the nostalgic rush of seeing these episodes again after 25 or so years - i missed the reruns on nick at nite - though i wonder if the missing music will really make a difference to anyone who doesn't have prior knowledge of the show.  still, i would've given five stars if the soundtrack was intact.",1212537600,9,649,4.568965517241379
3137718,2,B00151QYT4,"They took the cheap way out and didn't license most of the great 80s tunes as heard when the show originally aired. In some places it's obvious, like when Marshal introduces a Minor Threat song while DJing at the school radio station and they play some generic dreck. Other times, it's more subtle, like every scene in the diner originally had music playing in the background, and now there's just nothing.",1212364800,75,406,4.732394366197183
3137719,4,B00151QYT4,"If you can't get in to see ""Sex & the City: The Movie,"" you might want to check out when Carrie Bradshaw was a social outcast.

If you've never heard of ""Square Pegs,"" blame CBS for cancelling, after a single season, one of TV's most quirky, original comedies ever, and definitely the best TV show from a ""Saturday Night Live"" alum until Chris Rock and Tina Fey came along.

Anne Beatts was a five-time Emmy-nominated writer from ""SNL's"" ""first wave"" of 1975-1980. (One of her most memorable sketches featured Dan Aykroyd as Fred Garvin, a Midwestern, self-styled ""man of the evening."")

In 1982, Beatts created ""Square Pegs"" based upon her own high-school experiences. Beatts' ""SP"" alter ego was Patty Greene (Sarah Jessica Parker), a well-meaning but inept high-schooler. With her best friend Lauren (Amy Linker), Patty schemed to break her school's caste system and become one of the popular girls.

It's too bad Patty was so inclined, because the group she hung out with was pretty nice on their own terms. Besides Lauren, Patty's circle included comedian wanna-be Marshall Blechtman (John Femia), and New Waver Johnny Slash (the glorious Merritt Butrick who, sadly, died of AIDS before his 30th birthday).

The group to which Patty aspired -- the social snobs -- was led by yuppie-to-be Muffy Tepperman (""Still Standing's"" Jami Gertz, then a minor '80s heartthrob).

Mirroring Patty's conflict, the show struggled for approval from CBS. When the network meddled in the writing, Beatts tried to act tough like her ex-boss, ""SNL"" producer Lorne Michaels, and would threaten to leave when the network meddled in the show. According to Beatts, CBS' response was invariably, ""Fine, take a hike."" The series managed one forlorn season before The Eye pulled the plug.

But, except for some rather dated '80s references -- one episode revolves around getting New Wave band Devo to play at a high-school dance -- the show perfectly nails high-school alienation, and does so more hilariously than high-toned efforts such as ""My So-Called Life.""

Parker nearly didn't get the lead role because -- shades of ""Sex & the City"" -- she was initially thought to be too pretty. Happily, Parker shows up on the DVD commentary, where she opines that Carrie Bradshaw is the logical conclusion to which Patty would aspire. (Er, maybe.)

If you have a Goth-styled, humor-free teen who needs to lighten up a bit, throw ""Square Pegs"" on their DVD player. And then try to convince the teen (and you) that the show's clueless heroine went on to become a sex symbol for the '90s.",1211932800,5,2556,4.953271028037383
3137720,4,B00151QYT4,One of my favorite tv shows of the 80s. It only lasted one season but what a season it was. So funny! :) I highly recommend it.,1211068800,3,127,3.740740740740741
3137721,4,B00151QYT4,"I used to watch this every Monday night, and then the kids at school would all talk about it the next day.  Sadly, the show died a premature death, which was a bummer as I always wanted to see Lauren and Patty grow and get over not being part of the in-crowd.  Oh well, we can all pretend Patty became a famous New York sex columnist ...

Now to the DVDs.  I've seen the set and all I can say is, ""Totally New Wave.""

Fans of the show will be thrilled to know that all the episodes are here as they were originally presented - crystal clear, with the Waitresses and Devo's appearances intact and the full 24 minute running times.  Of course, we have to suffer through the awful canned laughter, there was no option to get rid of it.

This show brings back memories for sure, and it's hard to believe it's been over a quarter of a century.  Is that even possible?

A great feature of the DVDs is the cast interviews.  The only members missing are Merritt Buttrick, who passed away in 1989, and Jon Caliri who played Vinnie.  It's fun to see Tracy Nelson and Claudette Wells together again.

Will a new generation appreciate the show?  Who knows, but for a lot of us, this is a great piece of nostalgia and a funny show.",1210723200,38,1218,4.243478260869566
3137722,2,B00151QYT4,"When I saw this announced, my first reaction was to immediately pre-order it. But now I'm hesitant. Recent TV box sets in the past have completely ripped off the consumer.

For example, HAPPY DAYS SEASON ONE was immaculate. HAPPY DAYS SEASON TWO was a rip-off. Why? Music rights! PARAMOUNT refused to shell out approximately 2 million dollars to keep the original songs intact in the episodes.

Another example -- WKRP SEASON ONE. All original music -- GONE!

The simple solution is to pay for the rights and add ten bucks to the price of the box set. Until studios start doing that, I'll never buy another ""bastardized"" season of HD or WKRP again.

The reason I bring this up is because SQUARE PEGS used a lot of early 80's new wave tracks. DEVO even guest starred on an episode. And the price of this box set is suspiciously ""cheap."" So my question is -- IS THE ORIGINAL MUSIC INTACT -- ALL OF IT????

If it is -- great! I'll be the first guy in line to pick up this long overdue box set! If it's not -- I won't be purchasing SQUARE PEGS!! And neither should anyone else for that matter.

3137749,4,B00151QYT4,"I loved this series when I was younger and was disappointed when it ended after only two seasons. I was glad to pick up the whole series. It was quite cutting edge for its time and featured some great characters and young actors just getting their start, including Sarah Jessica Parker, who went on to make several hit movies and ""Sex In The City."" This was before her fashionista days, when she was a young teenage girl with frizzy brown hair. What is great are the bonus features. There are interviews with Sarah Jessica Parker, Tracy Nelson, Claudette Wells and Jamie Gertz. All are thankful for being cast in Square Pegs, because the series led them to more acting jobs and to a successful career in the entertainment industry.

The only problem is some of the great 80s music featured is missing or substituted with generic music. I guess that's why this set is so inexpensive. Too bad. because I prefer to see shows in their original form.

3137753,4,B00151QYT4,"""Square Pegs"" gives a fresh look at the 1980s from the unpopular crowd's perspective, without ""Saved by the Bell""-type nerd or punk stereotypes. Though the series has a low-budget feel and some over-the-top characters, its insights into 80s alternative culture and high school life right truer than most. The characters are well developed for a sitcom of this day, and it's fun to see guest appearances from then-young celebrities like Bill Murray.

A couple gripes. Some of the original music has been replaced, a shame for one of the few shows to ""get"" the new-wave and punk scenes. Notably missing is ""Dancing With Myself,"" which originally played during Bill Murray's and Sarah Jessica Parker's controversial diner dance scene. Devo and Waitresses appearances remain intact, as does the Waitresses theme song. Another gripe, from the show itself, not the DVD, is the sound track. It seems to go off randomly and sometimes not at all. It has a jarring effect -- how can we know for sure what's funny or not? ;)",1424044800,2,1013,4.923976608187134

Having to break the network enforced conventions, like a pathetic laugh track through the first 3/4 of the series, not to mention hammy overacting and cliche characters, there are some true genius moments in several of the episodes. The ""glasses"" speech in the second episode is one of the heaviest darkest things ever on network TV, and the Bill Murray episode is wonderful. The problem with so many writers and so little time, makes it hard to be consistent, and the quality definitely slacked near the end of the series. But I'm holding it against NON Teen shows, and that's really not fair. In the category the show was in, it by FAR outshines the garbage released now for teens.

It was an immediate hit that fizzled by its fourth episode, leaving behind rumors of questionable activities on the set and a devoted group of fans who still know the show's theme song by heart and grin when they hear someone say ""It behooves me..."" As a new wave fan when the show came out I was drawn to it's quirkiness and celebration of geekdom.  My wife was the same age as the show's characters when it came out and was likewise a fan, and our mutual love for the show was a bonding experience for us when we were dating.  It was said this would never come out on DVD, so I was pleased to see that it did last year.  The show is very dated and timeless at the same time, as cliques and self-consciousness will always be a part of school life.  The show was supposedly influential on several of the teen-oriented films that would appear a few years later and feature a couple of Square Pegs' stars.  It is comical to see how no attempt at realism is made for production numbers or situations, and the running gags (Guatemalan child in need, teenage girls' schemes, etc.) are funny.  It's nothing deep or even enduring, but it will bring a smile to you and it wears better than you might think.  And the theme song is still a classic.",1247270400,3,1274,4.301255230125523

3137800,4,B00151QYT4,"After she starred on Broadway as ""Annie"" and long before she became Carrie Bradshaw from ""Sex and The City,"" Sarah Jessica Parker portrayed Weemawee High School outcast Patty Greene in the short-lived but fondly remembered 1982-1983 CBS sitcom ""Square Pegs."" The series struck a major emotional chord with me at the time; for I was also a major ""square peg"" in high school.  Looking at it now after 25 years, I appreciate the show's satirical spin on high school horrors more than ever but, also, I still feel the pain. This proves how very much on the mark ""Square Pegs"" was and still is.
  The series revolved around Patty and Lauren's (Amy Linker) relentless pursuit of ""Popularity."" The two misfit girls actually DID FIT IN quite well with class comedian Marshall Blechtman (John Femia) and his constantly ""zoned out"" sidekick Johnny Slash (The late Merrick Butrick, whom the cast recalls fondly on a sweet remembrance in the DVD'S  ""Weemawee Yearbook Memories""  Segments).
  Some of ""Square Pegs"" is dated; particularly the ""Pac-Man Fever"" episode, in which Father Guido Sarduchi from ""Saturday Night Live"" cures Marshall of his video game addiction. And snotty Jennifer's (Tracy Nelson) vapid ""Valley Girl act""-- ""like, gross me out the door!""-- grows old very quickly. But several other episodes, including ""Halloween XII,"" ""A Simple Attachment,"" and ""Weemaweegate"" skillfully mix humor and genuine charm.
  Sarah Jessica Parker, wearing glasses that her character Patty despises, is as luminous, lovely, and talented as ever. I'd take Patty Greene ANY DAY over Carrie Bradshaw in ""Sex and The City!""  But it's Merrick Butrick and Jami Gertz who really go to the head of the class and steal the show with their inspired comic portrayals of Johnny Slash and Muffy Tepperman, respectively.  Johnny and Muffy are even briefly ""married"" for a school assignment in the episode ""No Substitutions"" featuring guest star Bill Murray.  Other ""Square Pegs"" guest stars included New Wave music acts Devo (""Muffy's Bat Mitzvah""), The Waitresses (who sing the ""Square Pegs"" Theme Song and ""I Know What Boys Like"" in the Pilot Episode), John Densmore (drummer for ""The Doors""), Martin Mull (Roseanne""), and Tony Dow (Wally in ""Leave It To Beaver""), who appears as Patty's estranged father in the episodes ""A Child's Christmas In Weemawee: Parts 1 And 2.""
  Butrick is obviously much too old to play a high school student-- and too talented not to play one. The series cleverly dealt with his age by saying that Johnny Slash was ""held back three times""; thus making him ""Weemawee's oldest freshman."" Butrick shines in the episodes ""Open 24 Hours,"" ""Muffy's Bat Mitzvah"" and ""No Joy In Weemawee.""
  As Muffy, the ever peppy preppie who is ""drunk with pep"", Jami Gertz often looks like she is sucking on a lemon, especially when she sees anything that displeases her. When Marshall's ""love detector"" throws the school's social order into disorder (in the episode ""A Simple Attachment"") Muffy exclaims, ""I could just barf!"" It's a testament to Gertz's talents (she went on to appear in the films ""The Lost Boys,"" ""Less Than Zero,"" ""Twister"" and the CBS Sitcom ""Still Standing"") that we laugh at Muffy but we never hate her--even when her actions and behaviors (especially in the episode ""To Serve Weemawee All My Days"") are horrible!!!!
  Clearly, this show was way too hip and way too ahead  of its time. Consequently,  the school bell rang much too soon for ""Square Pegs."" The series was shot in California in an abandoned high school, some 40 miles AWAY from CBS. The network probably felt it didn't have enough ""control"" over the show's content, so it was cancelled. The cast laments in DVD interviews that the party ended much too soon, after only 19 episodes. Well, 20 episodes if you count "" A Child's Christmas In Weemawee: Parts 1 and 2"" as two episodes-- but on the DVD, they are edited together as one episode.
  The main cast members, except for the late Butrick and Jon Caliri, who portrayed Jennifer's ""walking gland"" boyfriend Vinnie Pasetta, are all present, and seen in the present, in the DVD Extras segments titled ""Weemawee Yearbook Memories.""  The series, like Patty and Lauren, never did achieve ""mainstream popularity."" And that fact, my dear misfits, makes ""Square Pegs"" so much more special and endearing.",1217203200,8,4318,5.016806722689076

3137802,3,B00151QYT4,"One of the great things about DVDs has been the release of past television shows that were once favorites or new cult hits. Having the chance to watch Columbo ruminate over the clues that have been present for all to see or watching the stranded cast of LOST was so much easier being able to stop and start without fear of missing a few seconds.

Then again, some of the shows chosen have left a lot to be desired. There have been numerous occasions where childhood memories were crushed as we watched shows that were not near the hilarious fun fests we remembered them as. Such is the case with SQUARE PEGS: THE COMPLETE SERIES.

This series from the eighties followed the misadventures of Patty (a young Sarah Jessica Parker) and Lauren (Amy Linker), two freshmen at Weemawee High School whose main goal seems to be trying to fit in. Not only do they want to fit in, they want to be part of the IN crowd. But the chances of that were slim to none.

Though it sounds like a nice premise for a series, it fails on so many levels. Which is stunning because I recalled this as one of those shows that was a must see and has developed a cult status since its departure. The biggest problem? It relies far too much on stereotypes. While this may make it easy to keep the characters separate, it also makes for a boring show week to week.

First off is the school stuck up snooty valley girl Jennifer (Tracy Nelson). As portrayed here we here the phrase ""like..."" so often that you can almost program your watch with how many seconds until it's said again. Her boyfriend is another stereotype held over from both HAPPY DAYS and WELCOME BACK KOTTER. Vinnie Jon Calilri) is the leather jacket wearing Italian stud who spills over with juvenile delinquency.

The two friends the girls do make are also cardboard cutouts. Marshall (John Femia) is a standup wannabe, the nerdiest of nerds to be found. His partner in crime is Johnny Slash (Merritt Butrick), the male counterpart to Jennifer's valley girl who overuses the phrase ""totally"" to the point of exhaustion.

Lastly in the cast of characters are LaDonna (Claudette Wells), Jennifer's sassy black girlfriend who seems more like a white girl trying to act black than a black actress could do on her own. The writers really messed this character up. Along with her comes Muffy (Jami Gertz pre-LOST BOYS), the preppy cheer happy school supporter.

Toss these characters into the mix and you get very little to laugh at. Plotlines move from the first school dance to video games to school reporters to radical lifestyles. The most interesting parts are not the stories or the acting involved but the look of the show. Based almost completely on the new wave fashions and catch phrases, the show offers a somewhat skewed historical look at the times. VH-1's ""I Love The Eighties"" does this better though.

Fans of the show will no doubt be pleased to see its release. Parker fans will probably want to see her in pre-SEX IN THE CITY times. But for most of us, this series seems ""totally"" lame. It might be fun to show the kids if you grew up then. But other than that it offers little.",1214524800,2,3128,4.563279857397505

Other times, it's more subtle, like every scene in the diner originally had music playing in the background, and now there's just nothing.",1212364800,75,406,4.732394366197183
3372216,4,B00151QYT4,"If you can't get in to see ""Sex & the City: The Movie,"" you might want to check out when Carrie Bradshaw was a social outcast.

If you've never heard of ""Square Pegs,"" blame CBS for cancelling, after a single season, one of TV's most quirky, original comedies ever, and definitely the best TV show from a ""Saturday Night Live"" alum until Chris Rock and Tina Fey came along.

Anne Beatts was a five-time Emmy-nominated writer from ""SNL's"" ""first wave"" of 1975-1980. (One of her most memorable sketches featured Dan Aykroyd as Fred Garvin, a Midwestern, self-styled ""man of the evening."")

In 1982, Beatts created ""Square Pegs"" based upon her own high-school experiences. Beatts' ""SP"" alter ego was Patty Greene (Sarah Jessica Parker), a well-meaning but inept high-schooler. With her best friend Lauren (Amy Linker), Patty schemed to break her school's caste system and become one of the popular girls.

It's too bad Patty was so inclined, because the group she hung out with was pretty nice on their own terms. Besides Lauren, Patty's circle included comedian wanna-be Marshall Blechtman (John Femia), and New Waver Johnny Slash (the glorious Merritt Butrick who, sadly, died of AIDS before his 30th birthday).

The group to which Patty aspired -- the social snobs -- was led by yuppie-to-be Muffy Tepperman (""Still Standing's"" Jami Gertz, then a minor '80s heartthrob).

Mirroring Patty's conflict, the show struggled for approval from CBS. When the network meddled in the writing, Beatts tried to act tough like her ex-boss, ""SNL"" producer Lorne Michaels, and would threaten to leave when the network meddled in the show. According to Beatts, CBS' response was invariably, ""Fine, take a hike."" The series managed one forlorn season before The Eye pulled the plug.

But, except for some rather dated '80s references -- one episode revolves around getting New Wave band Devo to play at a high-school dance -- the show perfectly nails high-school alienation, and does so more hilariously than high-toned efforts such as ""My So-Called Life.""

Parker nearly didn't get the lead role because -- shades of ""Sex & the City"" -- she was initially thought to be too pretty. Happily, Parker shows up on the DVD commentary, where she opines that Carrie Bradshaw is the logical conclusion to which Patty would aspire. (Er, maybe.)

If you have a Goth-styled, humor-free teen who needs to lighten up a bit, throw ""Square Pegs"" on their DVD player. And then try to convince the teen (and you) that the show's clueless heroine went on to become a sex symbol for the '90s.",1211932800,5,2556,4.953271028037383
3372217,4,B00151QYT4,One of my favorite tv shows of the 80s. It only lasted one season but what a season it was. So funny! :) I highly recommend it.,1211068800,3,127,3.740740740740741
3372218,4,B00151QYT4,"I used to watch this every Monday night, and then the kids at school would all talk about it the next day.  Sadly, the show died a premature death, which was a bummer as I always wanted to see Lauren and Patty grow and get over not being part of the in-crowd.  Oh well, we can all pretend Patty became a famous New York sex columnist ...

Now to the DVDs.  I've seen the set and all I can say is, ""Totally New Wave.""

Fans of the show will be thrilled to know that all the episodes are here as they were originally presented - crystal clear, with the Waitresses and Devo's appearances intact and the full 24 minute running times.  Of course, we have to suffer through the awful canned laughter, there was no option to get rid of it.

This show brings back memories for sure, and it's hard to believe it's been over a quarter of a century.  Is that even possible?

A great feature of the DVDs is the cast interviews.  The only members missing are Merritt Buttrick, who passed away in 1989, and Jon Caliri who played Vinnie.  It's fun to see Tracy Nelson and Claudette Wells together again.

Will a new generation appreciate the show?  Who knows, but for a lot of us, this is a great piece of nostalgia and a funny show.",1210723200,38,1218,4.243478260869566
3372219,2,B00151QYT4,"When I saw this announced, my first reaction was to immediately pre-order it. But now I'm hesitant. Recent TV box sets in the past have completely ripped off the consumer.

For example, HAPPY DAYS SEASON ONE was immaculate. HAPPY DAYS SEASON TWO was a rip-off. Why? Music rights! PARAMOUNT refused to shell out approximately 2 million dollars to keep the original songs intact in the episodes.

Another example -- WKRP SEASON ONE. All original music -- GONE!

The simple solution is to pay for the rights and add ten bucks to the price of the box set. Until studios start doing that, I'll never buy another ""bastardized"" season of HD or WKRP again.

The reason I bring this up is because SQUARE PEGS used a lot of early 80's new wave tracks. DEVO even guest starred on an episode. And the price of this box set is suspiciously ""cheap."" So my question is -- IS THE ORIGINAL MUSIC INTACT -- ALL OF IT????

If it is -- great! I'll be the first guy in line to pick up this long overdue box set! If it's not -- I won't be purchasing SQUARE PEGS!! And neither should anyone else for that matter.

The characters are well developed for a sitcom of this day, and it's fun to see guest appearances from then-young celebrities like Bill Murray.

A couple gripes. Some of the original music has been replaced, a shame for one of the few shows to ""get"" the new-wave and punk scenes. Notably missing is ""Dancing With Myself,"" which originally played during Bill Murray's and Sarah Jessica Parker's controversial diner dance scene. Devo and Waitresses appearances remain intact, as does the Waitresses theme song. Another gripe, from the show itself, not the DVD, is the sound track.

Other standout episodes include: The Pilot, Muffy's Bat Mitzvah (featuring Devo), It's All How You See Things, It's Academical, No Substitions (featuring Bill Murray), and The Arrangement. This show had some so-so episodes in the beginning but definitely improved halfway through the short series.

3372292,3,B00151QYT4,"With the creative team behind the ORIGINAL Saturday Night Live, this charming often witty show came out. Having to break the network enforced conventions, like a pathetic laugh track through the first 3/4 of the series, not to mention hammy overacting and cliche characters, there are some true genius moments in several of the episodes. The ""glasses"" speech in the second episode is one of the heaviest darkest things ever on network TV, and the Bill Murray episode is wonderful. The problem with so many writers and so little time, makes it hard to be consistent, and the quality definitely slacked near the end of the series. But I'm holding it against NON Teen shows, and that's really not fair. In the category the show was in, it by FAR outshines the garbage released now for teens. From the 90's on, horribly written, manufactured, unfunny shows with NOTHING to say like Saved By The Bell and California Dreams put Square Pegs on a Citizen Kane level.",1257292800,5,958,4.77710843373494
3372293,4,B00151QYT4,"""Square Pegs"" is a true cult show.  It was an immediate hit that fizzled by its fourth episode, leaving behind rumors of questionable activities on the set and a devoted group of fans who still know the show's theme song by heart and grin when they hear someone say ""It behooves me..."" As a new wave fan when the show came out I was drawn to it's quirkiness and celebration of geekdom.  My wife was the same age as the show's characters when it came out and was likewise a fan, and our mutual love for the show was a bonding experience for us when we were dating.  It was said this would never come out on DVD, so I was pleased to see that it did last year.  The show is very dated and timeless at the same time, as cliques and self-consciousness will always be a part of school life.  The show was supposedly influential on several of the teen-oriented films that would appear a few years later and feature a couple of Square Pegs' stars.  It is comical to see how no attempt at realism is made for production numbers or situations, and the running gags (Guatemalan child in need, teenage girls' schemes, etc.) are funny.  It's nothing deep or even enduring, but it will bring a smile to you and it wears better than you might think.  And the theme song is still a classic.",1247270400,3,1274,4.301255230125523

A cast you know (Sarah Jessica Parker, Jami Gertz, Capt. Kirk's son in Star Trek 2), overacting in every scene. Each and every ""joke"" is delivered with the subtlety of freight train. But the scripts are so inane, you can't blame them.

3372297,4,B00151QYT4,"After she starred on Broadway as ""Annie"" and long before she became Carrie Bradshaw from ""Sex and The City,"" Sarah Jessica Parker portrayed Weemawee High School outcast Patty Greene in the short-lived but fondly remembered 1982-1983 CBS sitcom ""Square Pegs."" The series struck a major emotional chord with me at the time; for I was also a major ""square peg"" in high school.  Looking at it now after 25 years, I appreciate the show's satirical spin on high school horrors more than ever but, also, I still feel the pain. This proves how very much on the mark ""Square Pegs"" was and still is.
  The series revolved around Patty and Lauren's (Amy Linker) relentless pursuit of ""Popularity."" The two misfit girls actually DID FIT IN quite well with class comedian Marshall Blechtman (John Femia) and his constantly ""zoned out"" sidekick Johnny Slash (The late Merrick Butrick, whom the cast recalls fondly on a sweet remembrance in the DVD'S  ""Weemawee Yearbook Memories""  Segments).
  Some of ""Square Pegs"" is dated; particularly the ""Pac-Man Fever"" episode, in which Father Guido Sarduchi from ""Saturday Night Live"" cures Marshall of his video game addiction. And snotty Jennifer's (Tracy Nelson) vapid ""Valley Girl act""-- ""like, gross me out the door!""-- grows old very quickly. But several other episodes, including ""Halloween XII,"" ""A Simple Attachment,"" and ""Weemaweegate"" skillfully mix humor and genuine charm.
  Sarah Jessica Parker, wearing glasses that her character Patty despises, is as luminous, lovely, and talented as ever. I'd take Patty Greene ANY DAY over Carrie Bradshaw in ""Sex and The City!""  But it's Merrick Butrick and Jami Gertz who really go to the head of the class and steal the show with their inspired comic portrayals of Johnny Slash and Muffy Tepperman, respectively.  Johnny and Muffy are even briefly ""married"" for a school assignment in the episode ""No Substitutions"" featuring guest star Bill Murray.  Other ""Square Pegs"" guest stars included New Wave music acts Devo (""Muffy's Bat Mitzvah""), The Waitresses (who sing the ""Square Pegs"" Theme Song and ""I Know What Boys Like"" in the Pilot Episode), John Densmore (drummer for ""The Doors""), Martin Mull (Roseanne""), and Tony Dow (Wally in ""Leave It To Beaver""), who appears as Patty's estranged father in the episodes ""A Child's Christmas In Weemawee: Parts 1 And 2.""
  Butrick is obviously much too old to play a high school student-- and too talented not to play one. The series cleverly dealt with his age by saying that Johnny Slash was ""held back three times""; thus making him ""Weemawee's oldest freshman."" Butrick shines in the episodes ""Open 24 Hours,"" ""Muffy's Bat Mitzvah"" and ""No Joy In Weemawee.""
  As Muffy, the ever peppy preppie who is ""drunk with pep"", Jami Gertz often looks like she is sucking on a lemon, especially when she sees anything that displeases her. When Marshall's ""love detector"" throws the school's social order into disorder (in the episode ""A Simple Attachment"") Muffy exclaims, ""I could just barf!"" It's a testament to Gertz's talents (she went on to appear in the films ""The Lost Boys,"" ""Less Than Zero,"" ""Twister"" and the CBS Sitcom ""Still Standing"") that we laugh at Muffy but we never hate her--even when her actions and behaviors (especially in the episode ""To Serve Weemawee All My Days"") are horrible!!!!
  Clearly, this show was way too hip and way too ahead  of its time. Consequently,  the school bell rang much too soon for ""Square Pegs."" The series was shot in California in an abandoned high school, some 40 miles AWAY from CBS. The network probably felt it didn't have enough ""control"" over the show's content, so it was cancelled. The cast laments in DVD interviews that the party ended much too soon, after only 19 episodes. Well, 20 episodes if you count "" A Child's Christmas In Weemawee: Parts 1 and 2"" as two episodes-- but on the DVD, they are edited together as one episode.
  The main cast members, except for the late Butrick and Jon Caliri, who portrayed Jennifer's ""walking gland"" boyfriend Vinnie Pasetta, are all present, and seen in the present, in the DVD Extras segments titled ""Weemawee Yearbook Memories.""  The series, like Patty and Lauren, never did achieve ""mainstream popularity."" And that fact, my dear misfits, makes ""Square Pegs"" so much more special and endearing.",1217203200,8,4318,5.016806722689076

3372299,3,B00151QYT4,"One of the great things about DVDs has been the release of past television shows that were once favorites or new cult hits. Having the chance to watch Columbo ruminate over the clues that have been present for all to see or watching the stranded cast of LOST was so much easier being able to stop and start without fear of missing a few seconds.

Then again, some of the shows chosen have left a lot to be desired. There have been numerous occasions where childhood memories were crushed as we watched shows that were not near the hilarious fun fests we remembered them as. Such is the case with SQUARE PEGS: THE COMPLETE SERIES.

This series from the eighties followed the misadventures of Patty (a young Sarah Jessica Parker) and Lauren (Amy Linker), two freshmen at Weemawee High School whose main goal seems to be trying to fit in. Not only do they want to fit in, they want to be part of the IN crowd. But the chances of that were slim to none.

Though it sounds like a nice premise for a series, it fails on so many levels. Which is stunning because I recalled this as one of those shows that was a must see and has developed a cult status since its departure. The biggest problem? It relies far too much on stereotypes. While this may make it easy to keep the characters separate, it also makes for a boring show week to week.

First off is the school stuck up snooty valley girl Jennifer (Tracy Nelson). As portrayed here we here the phrase ""like..."" so often that you can almost program your watch with how many seconds until it's said again. Her boyfriend is another stereotype held over from both HAPPY DAYS and WELCOME BACK KOTTER. Vinnie Jon Calilri) is the leather jacket wearing Italian stud who spills over with juvenile delinquency.

The two friends the girls do make are also cardboard cutouts. Marshall (John Femia) is a standup wannabe, the nerdiest of nerds to be found. His partner in crime is Johnny Slash (Merritt Butrick), the male counterpart to Jennifer's valley girl who overuses the phrase ""totally"" to the point of exhaustion.

Lastly in the cast of characters are LaDonna (Claudette Wells), Jennifer's sassy black girlfriend who seems more like a white girl trying to act black than a black actress could do on her own. The writers really messed this character up. Along with her comes Muffy (Jami Gertz pre-LOST BOYS), the preppy cheer happy school supporter.

Toss these characters into the mix and you get very little to laugh at. Plotlines move from the first school dance to video games to school reporters to radical lifestyles. The most interesting parts are not the stories or the acting involved but the look of the show. Based almost completely on the new wave fashions and catch phrases, the show offers a somewhat skewed historical look at the times. VH-1's ""I Love The Eighties"" does this better though.

Fans of the show will no doubt be pleased to see its release. Parker fans will probably want to see her in pre-SEX IN THE CITY times. But for most of us, this series seems ""totally"" lame. It might be fun to show the kids if you grew up then. But other than that it offers little.",1214524800,2,3128,4.563279857397505

Square pegs is a show following two girls, plump Lauren and brainy Patty (played by sex and the city's sarah Jessica parker) who are freshmen in high school. Lauren is obsessed with getting into a popular clique so the girls can be popular and have a social life they deserve (no way! not even with cleavage!). Instead, they meet two boys, Marshall, an aspiring comedian and class clown, and Johnny Flash, who is as far out there as a person can get. He's often very ditzy but usually very, very funny (totally, totally different head) and he really loves his friends. Rounding out the cast is Muffy Tepperman (played by Jami gertz, facts of life's boots st Clair), an overly peppy girl who is always annoying everyone (one of the main jokes in the show is about the Guatemalan child she is always collecting money for) and the two popular girls Lauren wants to impress so badly. One is Jennifer, a well developed girl with a valley girl attitude and an idiot boyfriend and what can only be referred to as a stereotypical African American girl, Ladonna. Both girls are far from nice and one has to wonder why Lauren would want to impress them, but who didn't want to impress a mean, popular girl in high school? The show is very, very funny, with great one-liners and very 80s themes plots, like pac-man addiction. It's a shame this show only lasted one season.
