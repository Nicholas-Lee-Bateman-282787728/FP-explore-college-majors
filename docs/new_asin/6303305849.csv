The original VHS of this movie is a must buy, hell I'd buy a VHS palyer just to watch this movie.

nothing short of EPIC

This version has not been ""re-dubbed"" like the version pioneer released on DVD in 2000.  If you think you have seen this movie, you need to watch it in its raw form.

There are subtle but noticable differences throughout the movie.
