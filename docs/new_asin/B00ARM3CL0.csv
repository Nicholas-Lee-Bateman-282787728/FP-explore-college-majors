8556966,1,B00ARM3CL0,"This is the second time I have ordered this same dang DVD to do some self-prep for an educational program.  We are focusing on both Ecstasy and Ketamine, both of which are listed as included in this 2-part DVD set, which is supposed be be Season 2, Drugs, Inc.  BOTH copies contain ONLY a 45-minute DVD on crack (which I've covered) and a second disc, which is the 45-minute episode on Pill Nation.  Am I missing something?  Where in the heck are all the other topic areas?  This should be a 6-part DVD series.  Not two 45-minute episodes.  What is listed on the back cover of the DVD is NOT what is covered in this set.  Do NOT order this unless you want only ""crack"" and ""pill nation"".",1415145600,,687,4.3125
