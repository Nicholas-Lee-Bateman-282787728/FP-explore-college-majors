8018649,3,B0001Z4PKA,"Following Fidel Castro's departure (virtually sixty years to the day he embarked from the Granma on Cuban soil, to launch the revolutionary war) it might be appropriate to cast a backlook at the Cuban cold war.  This film embodies that era, composed in the late 80s when human rights replaced doctrinaire anti-Communism as America's mission statement.  In the first person veteran anti-Castro militants - Huber Matos, Eloy Menoyo, and other lesser lights as well as family members - discuss their repression in Castro's prisons.  Recounting prison beatings, tortures, and the bad faith of power over justice they speak from the heart across a generation of anti-Castro activism, ranging from armed insurgency to the simple act of saying ""No"" to the demands imposed on them.  In such a heavily politicized society - where every negative act, from juvenile delinquency to having strange neighbors over from dinner - was seen as ""public endangerment,"" even twelve-year-olds became political prisoners slapped with a near-lifetime sentence of 25 years: much as refusing to obey a US policeman during a traffic stop is increasingly viewed as ""terrorism"" worthy of public capital punishment.  Interspersed within are takes of El Lider Maximo himself, rationalizing the repression, skirting the very issue that originally brought him to power as the ""sole champion of the liberties of the Cuban constitution violated by the usurping hand of tyranny"" (to paraphrase his 1953 defense ""History Will Absolve Me."")

Yet in watching the faces of these passed activists - now as gone as Fidel - speaking of their harrowing years of struggle certain discordant notes began clinking in the background, rising in volume as the film progressed through the lives of these men and women opposing the Revolution from every perspective.  First, it was far from true hat ""nobody listened"" to dissident voices from Cuba.  In the Revolution's first days hundreds of Batista's henchmen were run through Revolutionary Tribunals and executed to the great outcry from the US Government to the New York Times.  The struggles of the CIA in knocking together a Cuban contra army, in fanning anti-Communist activism in Cuba, were matched by an anti-Castro blitz in all US mass media denouncing Castro and lauding those still struggling for freedom in his ""imprisoned island."" If the European and American left on the universities were once pro-Castro, their voice was more than matched by official demonization long before the ""Cuban"" missiles of October.  The United States always listened to voices of dissent from Cuba, even as it ignored (or helped liquidate) similar voices elsewhere in Latin America.

The clinkers tumbled further at the filmclips of the ""Paris Tribunal,"" organized in France to rebuke the likes of Jean Paul Sartre and the French Left's former love of Fidel.  Here we watch Armando Valladares, author of a passionate and grim memoir surviving Castro's prisons, compare said Lider Maximo to Stalin, then Hitler, before panelist and Khmer Rouge survivor Haing Ngor.  Sorry, but there's no comparing Castro to them.  The Cuban Revolution did not liquidate millions across continents, in absolute or even relative numbers.  This was pure kneejerk construction but those resolved to damn Fidel did not care to listen closely to common sense.  What this diatribe did do was put Castro's repression into clearer context; to ask how the brutality of his prisons substantially differed from those elsewhere in Latin America, or for that matter from a classic Texas prison farm.  To be accused of ""justifying"" Castro's repression merely for demanding a clearer focus reveals that deafness is not confined to his fellow-travelers.

In this first-person narrative of Cuba's cold civil war we find the elisions and self-deception that marred the anti-Castro movement from the first, guaranteeing its failure to unseat Castro from the Bay of Pigs to his peaceful passing. The militia girls seen in training were mouthing more than revolutionary platitudes, but voicing a passion as genuine as Fidel's enemies that were defending their Patria: in this case from a proposed US invasion, which was a looming threat in the early 1960s. As allies of the ""imperialists,"" the anti-Castro activists damaged their cause in Cuba as surely as Castro's Communism damned his Revolution to them. In viewing Eloy and Huber and the rest speak so passionately, even eloquently, on the cause of freedom in Cuba we're reminded almost to the very word of the early Fidel.  So it must be asked: would they have behaved any better if they had succeeded, and faced the awesome burdens of power?  Is a cold civil war a lesser evil than a hot one subsidized from outside, like El Salvador in the 1980s?  Because throughout the film we are exposed only to the rational, democratic side of the anti-Castro opposition.  It mentions nothing of the likes of Luis Posada Carriles and Orlando Bosch, CIA-funded terrorists who proudly took credit for - among other operations - blowing a Cuban airliner out of the sky with 100% fatalities.  Nor could it, to retain credibility for its view of noble, freedom-loving dissidents vs. Castro the Renegade Tyrant: even though Posada Carriles and Bosch remained freedom-fighting heroes to the Cuban exile community.

8018653,3,B0001Z4PKA,"The movie let's you come to your own conclusions. Every revolution is the same, starting out trying to overthrow a corrupt regime and end up being a corrupt regime itself. It was very interesting to watch Castro lying to defend his brutal hold on Cuba, but after a little while it ended up being just depressing. My husband liked it a lot, I didn't like it at all, so this is a compromise review.",1368489600,,396,4.364864864864865
8018654,5,B0001Z4PKA,"Will nobody ever listen? This explosive documentary reveals the horrific nature of Castro's Cuba. Yet here we are 90 miles away, decades later and still no one listens. 80,000 have died ... even the director of this film is dead! However the DVD is available... and still nobody listens! What earthquake will it take to wake up American consciousness to the brutality that lies 90 miles away in Castro's Stalinist gulag?  We only focus on a silly embargo while human beings are being tortured by a cruel dictator. It's the theater of the absurd. How can we continue to turn a blind eye?  Buy or rent this... expose what is still going on! People are still tortured while our nation fills the theaters to see 'Motorcycle Diaries' about the assassin known as Che Guevara. When all is said and done how will history judge us?  We remained silent for over 48 years while ""nobody listened"". What does that say about our allegedly ""informed"" society? The information is here in this bold documentary... there are no excuses. A Holocaust continues 90 miles from the United States! Dare we claim ignorance yet again!",1145923200,9,1108,4.790575916230367
