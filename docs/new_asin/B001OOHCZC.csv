8331030,4,B001OOHCZC,"I like the dvd because there isn't endless chatter. If you have a dvd long enough you tend to get sick of hearing the same thing over and over. My problems are that you can't program segments into a continuous workout and it would have been awesome had there been an option to view exercises in a workout segment either via CD-ROM or printed list. The segments are pretty awesome though, nothing fancy here, and that is why I love kettlebells. When it comes to strength I need it straight forward. She had a great concept here, but just needed a little more to make it perfect.",1331510400,,577,4.401869158878505
8331031,4,B001OOHCZC,"This DVD was more than I had hoped for. The instructions were easy to follow, the dvd easy to navigate. The workouts with a kettlebell are challenging yet gentle on the body but you can definitely feel them the next day!
The only reason I gave this a 4 star was because without having to go through each one of the ingredients for the work outs there is no way to know what each section is. i recommend watching the dvd and taking notes so you can create a one of a kind workout that will never get boring because there are endless combinations. The only thing she doesn't suggest is rest periods, doing kettlebell you want to bring the heart rate back down to normalin between ""sets"" If this dvd came with a booklet outlining the details a little more it would get a 5 star from me.",1278028800,7,783,4.261744966442953
8331032,1,B001OOHCZC,"Nope I didn't like this DVD!!!
Boring, boring, boring.
Not much instruction, with blah music and backgrounds.
Hard to maneuver the menus.",1265328000,2,137,5.2727272727272725
