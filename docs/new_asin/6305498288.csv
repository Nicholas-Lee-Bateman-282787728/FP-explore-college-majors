1042391,1,6305498288,"I was interested in the Indianapolis disaster after seeing the movie Jaws, where it is discussed.  I was hoping this VHS film would give me some more information, and it might have, if the tape had been of sufficient quality to actually watch.
Unfortunately, the company that copied the tape for distribution, which must have been ""Bubba's Backstreet Tape Copiers and Stormdoor Company,"" apparently used one of the first VCRs ever made to do their copying.  The tape is recorded on Super Long Play, and I don't care how good your automatic or manual tracking is, your VCR can't keep up with the grainy, flipping images of this tape.  The thing is unwatchable.  You can just hit yourself in the head with a hammer a couple of times and get the same headache.  Save your money.",1005091200,9,775,4.669117647058823

1042454,5,6305498288,"The sinking and horror after, are presented in this film in a way, a lot of people who might have heard of this ship, can see the whole story of her end, and those who survived, to either be eaten by sharks, or go mad from drinking sea water. The real victim, was her Captain, Charles Butler McVey III . He was the scapegoat. The grief must have been too much. in 1968, he committed suicide. This is tragedy, on tragedy. It is a well made film",1384992000,,443,4.103448275862069

1042457,4,6305498288,"I have read the book ""In Harms Way"" by Doug Stanton and wanted to see the movie. I had looked at some other movies and documentaries about the sinking of the USS Indianapolis and just found them to graphic. The book tells the sad story very well but the movie gives a glimpse of the event with many important details which led up to the event being left out. It would not be a bad movie if I hadn't read the book and for someone who does not read it would be good to see the history.",1306800000,2,483,3.9896907216494846

1042461,4,6305498288,"I basically liked the DVD movie ""Mission of the Shark"".&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-of-the-Shark-The-Saga-of-the-U-S-S-Indianapolis/dp/B000PMFRUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission of the Shark: The Saga of the U.S.S. Indianapolis</a>

Stacey Keach and Richard Thomas were both in this movie and I never saw it on TV. Early in the movie, I wondered why all of the characters had sweaty faces when the ship was supposed to be docked in San Diego, CA. It was only at the end of the movie when I saw the credits that I realized the characters were perspiring heavily because the film was made on-board the USS Alabama BB-60 in Mobile, Alabama. Dialog and acting in the early part of the film was stiff and contrived. It wasn't until the ship was torpedoed that the characters really seemed to come alive.

There should have been a breeze blowing when the ship was underway steaming at 28 knots with the atomic bomb loaded on-board. Did the Japanese really sight the USS Indianapolis CA-35 while they were surfaced? Why was a German U-boat shown surfacing? Why couldn't a model of Japanese submarine I-58 be used for that scene? When the Japanese submarine commander looked through the periscope, a silhouette of an American destroyer was displayed. The movie depicted a freighter hull sinking by the stern when in reality, a US heavy cruiser rolled over on its side and sank by the bow. I would have liked to have seen a large model of the cruiser USS Indianapolis being struck by the Japanese torpedoes with huge, fiery munitions explosions from turret number two and the ship sinking in the authentic manner that it did. The movie did a fair job of answering most of the basic questions as to why and how the disaster occurred, but no mention was made of why USS Indianapolis, a heavy cruiser without any means of detecting or defending against submarine attack was dispatched from Tinian Island without destroyer escorts? The movie also failed to mention that Captain McVay did not receive any warnings about Japanese submarines lurking in the waters between Tinian Island and the Philippines. It was not clear in the movie that electrical power aboard the cruiser had been knocked out by the Japanese torpedoes. Instead, a rack-mounted radio cabinet was shown falling on a radio operator. Since the ship sank in only twelve minutes, I would have spent twelve minutes filming the sinking of the ship in greater detail. One unanswered question was why weren't there enough life rafts for everybody?

The scenes of crew-members going mad in the life rafts were tantalizing because they seemed very real and heightened the tension. However, some of the shark scenes were repeated multiple times and the wooden shark fin being pulled between the groups of swimmers was a disappointing reminder that this was a very low budget production. I expected to see many shark fins moving in realistic swimming motions in and around the swimmers. One almost gets the impression that only a few sharks attacked and only a few men were devoured when the reality is exactly the opposite! I was not so concerned that the wrong model of float plane descended to assist the survivors, but they shouldn't have changed the story! I read an account that stated that a PBY landed and took as many wounded as possible to the Philippines for treatment. The PBY took off with 56 men tied to the wings!! Perhaps for safety reasons, the movie director didn't want to attempt that feat. I really liked the way the Japanese submarine commander and crew were portrayed, but I would have had the Japanese doing a bonsai war cry when the torpedoes exploded against the USS Indianapolis, it was war after all.

I liked the movie because it told an important story about the unnecessary loss of 879 US sailors due to disorganization and bungling at higher levels within the US Navy. This engaging tale deserves a realistic re-make using all the latest computer graphics video and special effects available. There's no need to change the story line for increased dramatic effect because the actual events are every sailor's worst nightmare. The introduction and ending scenes with the post-war ship reunion were good, but the director should have gone the extra mile. Captain McVay's suicide and his exoneration by US Congress in 2000 should have been filmed. Capt McVay was exonerated after his death due to the efforts of a teenage American boy that located and motivated the former Japanese submarine commander to write a letter to congress. Those important details received only the briefest mention of a very compelling and relatively unknown American epic tragedy of World War II.",1282521600,3,4704,5.0424164524421595
1042512,5,6305498288,"I bought the DVD last spring before my grandfather died.  He served in the US Navy in WWII.  I thought the sinking and subsequent trial were very tragic.  I know many Navy sailors did not survive WWII to see their grandsons.  May they rest in peace.  I know I was lucky to get to know my grandfather who survived WWII.  He often shared his experiences with the US Navy in the South Pacific.  His older brother served at Iwo Jima as a US Marine in 1945.  The movie brings the USS Indianapolis and its historical characters to life.  I miss my grandfather, but I know he was fortunate to live a long life.  Many soldiers on the Indianapolis suffered a tragic ending from the blast, wounds, exposure, and shark attacks.",1278806400,8,716,4.438461538461539
1042513,2,6305498288,"It seems after watching this movie that not much went into casting and production.  There was no definate story to follow, the acting and dialogue were mediocre at best and very little realism in what few special affects there were.  I could not relate to or identify with any one character and I wasn't moved by anything that happened.  All in all it seemed a very bad made-for-TV movie.  Stacey Keach as Captain McVay was laughable - he gave a better performance as SGT stedangco in Up in Smoke.  I have just just read ""In Harm's Way"" by Doug Stanton and that painted a clear picture of the Tragedy and heroism of the USS Indy and I highly recommend this book.  I was hoping to watch a movie that reflected the true nature of this tradedy as the book did but I was way off the mark.  It's a shame there are no great movies ever made of this story.  If you know about this what happened in WWII and the sinking of this great ship, you will very disappointed in this movie and I do not recommend viewing.",1278460800,3,1004,4.275132275132275

But ever since JAWS I wait for the person to
go under water then come back up being dragged
around by the shark.
I guess I've watched JAWS to much. LOL
The best movie/documentary I've seen since JAWS is
BLUE WATER/WHITE DEATH.
These movies aren't for the weak hearted.
I thought it could have had better attack scenes
from the sharks.

1042518,4,6305498288,"Good story about the not-so-talked about military return trip of the USS Indianapolis.  This was a secret mission so maybe that is why.  But it is also the worst military desaster of WW II.

1042519,3,6305498288,"Mission of the shark is a noble effort but falls short in depicting the real horror experienced by the doomed crew of the Indianapolis. On the plus side, it had a fine cast and decent acting. The main focus of the movie seemed to be not the disaster itself, but the ensuing courtroom drama and the legal ramifications.
the budget was obviously limited and the shark fins look like they are made out of cardboard!
Here's hoping that the major motion picture of this event- scheduled for release some time in 2009- will really capture the horror and drama of the sinking of the Indianapolis.",1188432000,3,589,4.619047619047619
1042520,4,6305498288,"I have seen many programs on the U.S.S. Indianapolis, and read many books on it as well.  Mission of the Shark was a good movie, but some details where missing.  When the ship was struck it capsized and in the movie it shows ths ship going down stern first and it looked like a destroyer rather than the Indianapolis.  Good movie, good acting.  Good for anyone who has read or studied the Indianapolis.",1187827200,4,402,4.465753424657534
1042521,5,6305498288,"I haven't seen this movie since it was first released in the early '90's but I still remember the strong reaction I had to what the survivor's of the USS Indianapolis endured after their ship was sunk in the last part of WWII. I don't want to get into the details so that I don't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie. However, I will say that even after all these years I still remember the excellent acting of the cast, of whom the most memorable for me were Stacy Keach, Richard Thomas, and David Caruso.

UPDATE 8/2/07

I received my dvd yesterday and can now tell you about the quality of the transfer. The picture quality is not bad, it is not HD quality but I didn't notice any problems like graininess, or scratches, or anything like that. It is not any better or worse than a typical cable broadcast program. The sound is also about average, so don't expect to get blown out of your seat.

The story is a very powerful one that once you see it you won't be likely to forget it.

UPDATE

If You have Amazon prime then you can watch this for free on Amazon instant videos. Yippee!",1178755200,23,1094,4.265700483091788

Filmed aboard USS Alabama memorial.  There are shots of a destroyer used without i.d., but a whale boat was marked DE368 to represent the Doyle that was the first ship to arrive and the last to leave.  A post war Albatross substitutes for the Catalina that was the first to land.  The Ventura report is not mentioned directly.

The I-58 is shown about three different ways: a different underwater model firing, a Uboat surfacing and a sail for the surface, which might be the USS Drum at the same memorial.",1398384000,,675,4.537190082644628
