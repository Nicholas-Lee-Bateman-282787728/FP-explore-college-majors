No disrespect to the guys but they should leave the lessons to the pro's. Complete ametuer's would have rather saved my money.",1346889600,2,296,4.711538461538462

8155811,2,B000KEG988,This video is well made however it is not designed to be a educational training tool. The video only shows the dummy form. It does not show any applications. If you want to just see the dummy form then the video does its job. If you are wishing to learn applications or finer points of the dummy this video is not for you.,1320883200,4,322,4.126984126984127

8155813,4,B000KEG988,The video quality is not great as it has distortions at the top and bottom of the screen. I played the DVD on several different players and the distortions remained.,1286409600,,165,4.533333333333333
8155814,5,B000KEG988,"I have several wooden dummy DVD's, but have found that most of them demonstrate the form too fast for me to follow unless I am constantly resetting the DVD back to the beginning or to the segment I am studying. However, I found this tape to be an excellent tutorial. The form is shown so many times from different angles and in slow motion, it is impossible not to learn from it. Someone just watching the video would likely get pretty bored. Someone trying to learn the form, however, would find this DVD extremely useful.",1267228800,10,523,4.515789473684211
