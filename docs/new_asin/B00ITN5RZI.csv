8645391,5,B00ITN5RZI,"This full length ballet is a balletic biography of Charlie Chaplin(no surprise there!). It incorporates a blend of classical ballet and modern dance movements with a sprinkling of other styles to add spice, such as break dancing. This is exactly the kind of ballet that the Leipzig Ballet loves to do. The principal cast is formed from an international assortment of dancers(Chaplin, the dancer, is danced by an American, Tyler Galster, formerly of the Pennsylvania Ballet, and Chaplin, the Tramp, is danced by an Australian, Amelia Waller, formerly of the Queensland Ballet). The music is taken from a wide variety of sources and much of the music is composed by Chaplin, himself. The staging includes a wide variety of dance settings, including solos, duets, and full-sized ensemble pieces. Chaplin's character of The Tramp is prominent in this ballet, but, of course, that was not Chaplin's only character(The Music Professor was among my favorites). The choreography and dancing are energetic and impressive and the ballet holds our interest throughout. There is also a nice introduction(in German and English with available subtitles in English, French, and German), featuring interviews with the choreographer and principals. This is beautifully and tastefully done and is great for all audiences, both young and old(and those in-between).",1406505600,4,1345,5.40952380952381
