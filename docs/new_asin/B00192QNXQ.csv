I have read all the bad reviews and I am sure they are warranted, but as someone who has always wanted to, and still may make my own movie one day, I am positive some of these may be so bad that it makes me want to make mine even more.
I'm sure I will see these and say, ""I can do that.""",1388188800,,391,3.6666666666666665
8271631,5,B00192QNXQ,"I first learned about Bloody Nightmares through the No-Budget Nightmares podcast, and despite their warnings, I gladly picked it up.  If you're a fan of low- to no-budget filmmaking, people putting a movie together with no money (and in some cases, no experience) and seeing it through to the end, this box set is perfect.  It has a huge Todd Sheets collection, as well as genius flicks Suburban Sasquatch and So Mort It Be.  Definitely not for fans of Michael Bay or Steven Spielberg...but if you loved the original Evil Dead, or low budget films of the 80s, this brings you up to date on some of the b-flicks of the 90s and 2000s",1347235200,,631,4.517543859649122

8271633,4,B00192QNXQ,"I recently got this set, and I don't think the reviewers are being quite fair here, you have to know what your getting with this set. they are independent horrer movies and yes alot of them are really bad, but I quite enjoyed alot of them as well, some interesting stories and memerable movies, these are not blockbusters and have no stars in them the sound and picture quality aren't good in alot of them but to get 100 movies for (...) I feel like if Ive enjoyed a handfull of them Ive gotten my monies worth. These titles are all on imbd and many of them have trailers on utube, I recomend looking at the trailers like bloodsucking babes from burbank and see what your getting, if your not a fan of drive-in or trashy type movies steer clear of this set, but I am enjoying it, if a movie is really bad I move on to the next one. This set is a combo of the Decrepit Crypt of Nightmares and the Tomb of Terrors 50 Movie Packs",1236211200,16,926,4.15
