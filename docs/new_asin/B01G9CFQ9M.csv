8762649,4,B01G9CFQ9M,"Let's travel back to 1967, let's get George Hamilton as an international jewel thief, we have Joseph Cotton as his semi-retired mentor, we have Marie Laforet (awful actress) as the competition and Maurice Evans as her mentor. I see one other review here and I not sure what they watched, I was very entertained and found this to be a good bit of nostalgia. It is simplistic and predictable but let's face facts much of the 60's were not producing much as far as groundbreaking material. Rather this is fun because of the total 60's soundtrack and the familiar acting style of the time. The story or plot is silly and we do glorify the thievery business but so what! We also had some guest cameos, Zsa Zsa Gabor ( oh my God) Carroll Baker and the spectacular Lilli Palmer. I just had fun and loved this movie for what it was, not to try to look deep into it.",1478822400,4,857,4.3625
8762650,3,B01G9CFQ9M,"It's a Crime Drama, but not a very good one.  George Hamilton is the lead.  Zsa Zsa Gabor, German actor Wolfgang Preiss as well.  Don't expect much.",1470787200,2,148,4.407407407407407
