8192754,4,B000PMFRWO,"(Includes spoilers) Besides Harmony Korine's ""Julien Donkey-Boy"", another American contributed an entry into the Dogme 95 catalog - James Merendino with ""Amerikana"". When philosophy student Peter (Michael A. Goorjian) is abandoned by his Danish girlfriend in Los Angeles, his musician friend Chris (James Duval) invites him to South Dakota to claim a Harley Davidson he has inherited from an uncle. After Chris finds out it is in fact an Italian Vespa, he decides to take it to L.A. anyway, convincing a reluctant Peter. Both young men embark on a journey across the US that allows them to explore its landscapes and towns, discover some ugly aspects of rural citizens and confront their very own contradictions. A sort of free homage-remake of the classic ""Easy Rider"" (1969), its final ""plot point"" --leading to the death of its own sad version of Captain America-- is rather weak (the more so, being aural not visual, coming from a CB radio), but anyhow it is a strong film experience that merits viewing, led by the fine interaction of both performers, who are seen together most of the film. Goorjian contributed to the script of this Dogme movie, which has been seen by very few people apparently due to problematic distribution.",1391299200,,1235,5.0
