8060795,5,B0009HLCVU,"This wonderful show originally aired before I was born (1959) and was a contemporary of the original Dragnet.  The stories are extremely well-written and acted for a half-hour show and are surprisingly contemporary for a 2008 sensibility, without a hint of camp.  Forget the scratches and splices; this reminds me so much of my local Channel 5 or 20 in DC in the 60s showing this stuff after school or on Saturdays.  Nobody thought this stuff would last, but here we are!

Tall and handsome Reed Hadley had a great voice and I read that he did a lot of voiceover work (see ""He Walked by Night"" for an example).  His narration is clear and authoritative, as is his presence as Capt. Braddock.  (A lot of crime shows in those days had narrators, for that matter, but the narration helped move the action along.)  He seemed to have more compassion than Joe Friday, but that's for another forum. . .

As a fan of old TV and movies, I really liked the clothing styles of the period and that a well-dressed man seldom went anywhere without his hat (or a cigarette either).  I have both Vols. I and II of this show and simply love it!  One thing for sure -- the crime-solving technology changes but crime as a whole doesn't.  The pursuit of an easy buck has been around since Bible times.  To quote Capt. Braddock, ""And remember, it could happen to you.""",1199750400,,1347,4.475409836065574
