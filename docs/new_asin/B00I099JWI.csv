6245527,3,B00I099JWI,"I just viewed the first film which is in black and white. The image has a distinct problem that cannot be ignored. Spread throughout the image is a series of light, yet noticeable lines.  These lines run horizontal and appear as what looks like some kind of video noise. These do not go away. The other three movies which are in color, are fine. Anyone else notice these? If this was caused in the mastering process, it needs to be corrected.",1398816000,9,442,4.45679012345679
6245528,4,B00I099JWI,"Now if your familiar with the kaiju genre you should know who Gamera is. A giant turtle who released upon mankind thanks to a nuke waking him up. What followed are a series of films where he fights completely crazy looking monsters that Earth (or some kids). This is no Godfather or Citizen Kane in terms of quality but it gets the job done and can give you some good laughs. For the price of 15 bucks I recommend this to any fellow kaiju film lover, these films looking amazing in this bluray. Now if your new to Gamera I suggest the Trilogy which a far more serious take on the monster. ALSO I must warn you this is a bargain pack, each fil come in Japanese with English SUBS and no English DUB. Also this bluray contains no extras.",1398729600,20,734,4.25

Everything else is as expected.  The problem I believe is that the film company never released these in America completely so the English dubbing is only  for those edited releases.  So you have to watch the screen from beginning to end to understand the dialogue (unless you speak Japanese).

6245538,5,B00I099JWI,"Growing up I only remember having the chance to see a Gamera film aired on TV perhaps once or twice and always in B&W. Finally having the opportunity, decades later, to see all 8 classic Gamera films in widescreen HD seems almost too good to be be true. Having watched every Godzilla film backwards and forwards, along with virtually every other giant monster flick out there, I naturally assumed I'd seen just about everything.

Leave it to the Amphibious One to prove how wrong I really was! For sheer imagination and offbeat production design, the Gamera films are off the charts. Apart from the copious eye-candy, the series also boasts both likable characters and memorable adversaries. But be warned... for those poor souls afflicted with acute CGI-tus, who demand absolute albeit pixelated realism, these adventures are NOT for you.

However, for kindred souls not adverse to the ways of practical magic... or perhaps feeling a bit like a kid again, take off with the original Hero in a Half-shell and just enjoy the psychedelic ride!",1420588800,2,1041,4.942857142857143

As for the movies themselves, the first one is in black and white and is your standard Monster emerges in modern day flick. The rest are in color but the second one Gamera vs Bargon has a slightly more serious tone than the rest of the series. It's also the only one without a child as the lead or part of the main cast.

6245556,3,B00I099JWI,"I'm going to speak for both Volume 1 and 2 for this review. Well, I may be a major Godzilla fan, but I'm not one to ignore the competitors either. I got into Gamera late teens with the first of the Trilogy, even now I enjoy those films which got me curious on Gamera's older films. Well here was a chance to get them all for under $20 (Amazon Discounts) and in some ways I'm glad but disappointed. Well yeah, it's great to see all the old Gamera films in 2 Blu-Ray cases, but I think this will only suit the more hardcore Kaiju fan, one above my level. Why do I say that? Well, all the movies are only the original Japanese films, meaning no dubs. Which in some cases is fine, I don't mind subs but personally I prefer dubs so I don't have to read, even if the dubbing is bad. But that's not why I'm nitpicking this and I hope people can at the very least hear me out on this argument. Say you have kids who like you are into giant monsters, you show him or her the ropes of Godzilla, now you want to spread their wings on to the competition of the old days. You put in this movie and play the first film on the disc and the kids find out that they have to read to understand the people talking. Oh sure in these movies no one should ever care for story, but let's face facts people, this generation cares for story a lot more than we used to, but you get my point here. Gamera films were childish and still are, and I would even allow some kids to watch it as long they reach a personal age group. But I highly doubt a kid would want to read through most of a movie. As much I like Gamera as it is, this is only recommended to those who are strong fans of Kaiju films who can bare reading subtitles, I would not recommend this at all to those who are early into Kaiju films or giving it to a kid's birthday. I like my movies just like how my video games, with options, this gives you the movie selection, but not language. The Godzilla Blu-Ray movies that were recently released (and more on the way, hashtag hypetrain) gives you options on language but this didn't. The Gamera Trilogy has English dub but this didn't.",1405468800,4,2119,4.108433734939759
6245557,5,B00I099JWI,"The original movies are fun and show the spirit of early Kaiju movies extremely well.

6245559,5,B00I099JWI,"Gamera, Daiei's answer to Godzilla, was only a bad guy once. This was in his first movie, where he was a danger to the world. His second, and last adult adventure (first in color) had him battle Barugon, a vicious creature that shot fire and had a rainbow energy barrier. After this brutal encounter, Gamera was firmly on the side of humanity and children, defending earth from the vicious beasties that constantly came here to cause problems. This is a lot of fun and brought back many fond memories of watching ABC's 4:30 movie when it was Monster Week.",1404172800,3,555,4.616161616161616

6245563,4,B00I099JWI,"These are the first four Gamera films in their original Japanese releases, subtitled, no dubs and uncut. I am a fan of the Heisei trilogy of the late 1990's. Now I watched those movies first so I was already a Gamera fan before buying this set. I was well aware of their campiness, well more than campy, these films are absolute bonkers. The idea of Gamera is absurd. Think about it, giant turtle with tusks, breathes fire, and in the old films, he can fly through space. Not just fly, but fly IN SPACE! Not everyone can wrap their heads around that and it is one of the reasons why Gamera has enjoyed nothing more than cult status in the West compared to his more familiar rival from Toho. Supposedly Gamera is right up there in popularity in Japan second only to Godzilla.  I will write a brief review for each of the four films

Gamera: Comparisons to the Godzilla films are inevitable in the first two Gamera films. The first film itself is not the best quality. The acting seemed phoned in. The black and white made Gamera look scarier, but he will look goofy soon enough and honestly, there isn't anything wrong with that. He is so much more lovable that way. The sets are amazing. Amazing. Like whatever money they did not spend on the suits and quality actors, they spent on the sets. Besides the FX scenes, the film would have been forgettable if not for it being the first Gamera film.

Gamera vs. Barugon: The main monster of this film is not to be confused with Baragon who first appeared in Toho's Frankenstien vs. Baragon, then Destroy All Monsters and finally Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant All-Out Monsters Attack. Basically they took the concept of Baragon, gave him a longer horn, shorter ears and changed the ""o"" to a ""u"" and they have another monster. Sure his look and name may appear to be a rip off, but his powers aren't. He has this freezing spray that ends up to be Gamera's weakness. He also shoots rainbows out of his back. Rainbows. So not only Gamera is absured, his foes are even crazier. Plot-wise the film is better. The main human villain is a complete a-hole. Sometimes more entertaining than the actual monster fight. Check it out

Gamera vs. Gyaos: Now these were these films start to come into their own. It is like the filmmakers realize that Gamera is an insane concept so they decided to make the films more insane. This one centers around a road construction by this volcano. It is very boring. Some guys are pissed because they are not getting their money, but who cares. The real deal is the fights. Oh my god this film has three monster fights. Gyaos is so B.A. The King Ghidorah of the Gamera series. The fights were brutal. Just brutal. I can't decide which of these four films I like better, this one or the next one I am about to review

Gamera vs. Viras: This is the first Gamera film to have children as the lead cast. The first and third film had a kid in it but they were never the lead. Just some annoying little punk shouting ""Gamera!"" all the time. You just want to slap them. I think it is better to watch these films in the mindset of children, you can enjoy them more. This one takes place mostly in space. Two kids get kidnapped by aliens because they realized that Gamera has a fondness for children, he is after all ""Friend to all children"" so they hold them hostage to control Gamera and have him destroy earth so they can take over. The final fight was crazy, I mean these were directed towards kids but they can get graphic. I guess it is okay if the monsters bleed in any color but red. There's a nice touching scene where two children have a race with Gamera. You will see what I mean about Gamera being lovable.

Overall, the picture and sound quality was as expected for a HD transfer. The best it can be. I just wish they had better subtitles. They looked like they were typed in a hurry and the font was hard to read. As much as I prefer watching these films in the original language, I wish they would have a dub audio option. I don't mind reading them but the dub can't be any more ridiculous than what I am reading. Anyway if you love Gamera or into those giant monster movies, check it out. They are fun, will make you laugh.  Just turn your brain off, pretend to be a kid again and enjoy.",1401926400,13,4272,4.379571248423708
6245564,5,B00I099JWI,"It's always been hard, finding good copies of Kaiju movies...Tokusatsu in general really, but these days it's getting easier and this is proof, yes Gamera isn't a shining example of the best Kaiju. But if you want that, look to Godzilla or the DaiMajin trilogy. But getting 4 in 1 for the price it is, it's certainly worth just having the original audio track and no special features. Just having this alone is a bonus.",1401667200,,419,4.6
6245565,5,B00I099JWI,"I love these movies.  I've owned most of these movies on different DVD disk collections, but I'm happy to have them on one disk.

This is the best transfer I have ever seen, especially considering that these movies are 45+ years old and unloved by most people.  I had never seen these in the original aspect ratio, nor in the original Japanese.  I do wish that the American versions had been included as a bonus.

My player did freeze up a few times during the first movie, but I believe that the problem is with my player (because it freezes up on other disks as well).",1401235200,2,570,4.339622641509434
6245566,3,B00I099JWI,"Thanks to Mill Creek for releasing these films on Bluray, but seriously guys, who did the transfer and encoding?
As mentioned by John Field and others in their reviews, the first film ""Gammera The Giant Monster"", has a series of light, yet noticeable lines throughout the film and add to that a few sound dropouts in the first few minutes. I found you could deminish the ""lines"" on the screen by watching in ""cinema"" mode, but that's really not the point. They shouldn't be there. And to top it off at 0:04-22 when an unknown bomber explodes there's a frame that's completely pixelated. It's a very poor job. I checked it on two bluray players and the computer and got the same pixelated frame each time. So I went to slow-mo and there it was. Ok, it's only one frame, but it should not have happened. The other 3 films are in colour and ""OK"" for the most part although ""Gamera vs. Barugon"" has an odd ""jump"" at 0:09-07. I was so looking forward to this release, and honestly I've been left feeling a little disappointed by it. 3 stars, it's ""JUST OK"".",1400371200,14,1052,4.455958549222798
6245567,5,B00I099JWI,"Mill Creek has done a fantastic job at putting the Gamera flicks on blu-ray. Before I owned them on DVD and the quality was dismal, but these blu-rays look top notch.",1400112000,3,166,4.387096774193548
6245568,5,B00I099JWI,"Chances are if your looking at this item, your not new to these movies. The series is almost fifty years old. The question is whether the Blu-ray is worth your time or money. It was for me. I thought the prints looked pretty good and it's the first four movies on one disc for a low price. The first four are considered better than the ladder four. My favorite is Gamera vs Gyaos. It's the one I saw the most as a child. Even though my childhood memories were in English, I always play them in Japanese. They just seem less fake. But I can see the charm in the English dubs.  As mentioned in other reviews, there are no extras and no choice of audio. It's Japanese with English subtitles. I do have the previous release of these movies and was happy with them too. If you don't have any of these movies and you don't mind reading subtitles, you can get all eight movies of the original series for pretty cheap.",1399075200,2,910,4.2601156069364166
6245569,2,B00I099JWI,"Consider this my opinion for both Vol 1 and 2 of the Gamera Colleciton.

PROS: As a kid I remember when I first saw Gamera's debut movie when he came out the ice to terrorize Japan. The budget seemed toe much less then a Godzilla flick, but what was great was that this Kaiju could expend energy to jet propel himself wherever he wanted to go. He debut film was kind of lacking in imagination, using the old atom bomb triggers monsters release plot, but overall it was great. The way they the Japanese scientists dealt with his rampage was very cool ted  they make the actor and scene sound. Its much nicer to hear them speak their native Japan, and the subs are well synched with the dialogue.
  The BD in my opinion was of a very acceptable quality considering they put it all on one BD, I didn't see any lines or scratches ini the films  so if you are an avid Gamer fan, you can be sure your get your moneys worth for the pittance you pay.

CONS: While Godzilla had his great and not so great moments such as when he became a kids lovable dinosaur for a few years before being retrofitted with new costume that was more flattering in terms of bringing him back to the ominous and dangerous whirlwind of destruction that he was in hs debut film..  In contrast Gamera right away out of the blue became know as the friend of children, which meant that he was a nice turtle who fought off some conceptually interesting creatures that looked awful due not doubt to the budget for the Gamera films.
  The Soundtrack was alway the same, the Gamera march theme often with the Japanese boys scouts singing the lyrics. From his second movie onward you can only stare dumbfounded and wonder whose bright it idea it was to take an actually cool Kaiju and make  him into no more then a joke.
  Also what was grating was the fact that they tended to give flashbacks to the monster hs had fought in the past over and over film after film we had to see scenes we had seen a million times before as if to pad the running time.

So I gave it 2 stars. 1 for Gamera the first Kaiju Jet Setter (literally), whose promising debut quickly degenerated in to only 12 completely childish movies, the last one appearing  in 2006. Was this the studios intent? It was an idiotic move. But Gamera has a place in my heart.
1. Star for the quality of the BD at least I finally got to see it Gameras movies in all their original Japanese glory without the aggravating dubbing of the English only releases, which usually never truly conveys the actors emotions and mood as does his real voice.",1399075200,2,2562,4.343815513626835
8637917,5,B00I099JWI,"If you like low budget Japanese Kaiju films, this is a must own set. Me, I love them. I've been a fan of Godzilla movies since the '80s, but I'm a newcomer to the Gamera films. They're corny, the special effects and creatures are cheap looking even compared to the early Godzilla films. But, they're great. The writing is actually pretty good, no doubt trying to make up for the lack of budget in other areas. The first couple films try to be serious, then they clearly start trying to play to children, because Gamera was very popular with Japanese children. Unfortunately, the movies get cheaper as they go and the last film in this set is the first one to use stock footage. You can tell they're definitely using stock footage of Gamera, especially when it's from the first film, because that one is in black and white. But, still, they're good films if your'e into this kind of thing.

All of the movies are on one disc, which is handy. They're not very long and you can binge watch them without changing discs. The picture is nice and crisp, despite so many videos being on one disc, and the audio is good. There's no special features or anything, but that's fine as that stuff would just require them to compress the video. Besides, the company that made these films went bankrupt in the '70s, so it's hard to say how many people would fondly remember them and want to be interviewed. The audio is Japanese with English subtitles, but I prefer that to dubbed versions. I've seen the dubbed version of the first film, where they added scenes with American actors, and it's bad. Not unwatchable, but I prefer the original scenes to the added/replaced ones. So, it's all good with this collection.",1529366400,,1700,4.573770491803279
