5003463,2,B006LL3X74,"I bought this film because I am currently producing a documentary about an artist movement in the Caribbean, and I was curious to see how other directors have dealt with collectives and movements in their films.  I was also really taken by the artwork.

However, I very nearly didn't make it through the whole film.  I found the director's stance to be almost apologist and her treatment of the art which she was supposedly celebrating was shoddy.  I also found the chronological approach to the storytelling dull.  And ultimately, I felt her film was a disservice to feminist art.",1364774400,,581,4.828282828282828

8500370,5,B006LL3X74,"I watched this movie/documentary during a presentation at the university. I found the story so interesting that I decided to buy a couple of DVDs to share with friends. So I searched around the net and I only found it here. Without hesitating I order them and in less than a week (much before the initial estimated delivery) I got them home. The cases were new and well wrapped...I hope the DVD worked properly, because I gave them away before trying! Happy with my buy overall.",1391904000,,478,4.569767441860465
8500371,5,B006LL3X74,"This is a great film. When I saw it with some friends at a theater our eyes welled up multiple times. The director was a part of the early feminist movement in the arts and is not trying to create an unbiased or neutral film. This is told from the inside, from her particular position, which gives the work its own kind of authenticity. It is not claiming to be about the entire movement, so perhaps your favorite artist is left out. And some of the newer ""feminist"" artists haven't really stood the test of time. Even so it's important to remember that in just one small generation women and women artists have come a long way, and simultaneously have not come far enough. Young artists would do well to see this, both to know their history and to know when they are repeating it. The footage was shot over the years and reflects an artist' budget at times (not a hollywood budget). Within those constraints it is well done and should not be missed.",1382918400,2,950,4.434285714285714

8500373,1,B006LL3X74,"I love this film; got it out of the library and showed it to a class, who also loved it.  But when I bought this copy I had to return it because IT WASN'T THE RIGHT FILM.  The case said it was the film, the label on the disk said it was the film, but when I showed up in class to play it, it was a completely different film on the DVD.  FAIL--I had to quickly abandon my planned lesson and it put me behind for the rest of the semester.  Buy this film but be sure to play it in a non-serious situation first to see if it's right!",1368403200,2,529,3.7387387387387387
