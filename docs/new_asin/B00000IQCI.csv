7911535,5,B00000IQCI,"This film is a completely different and much more truthful look at the Lou Gehrig story than ""Pride of the Yankees"" and is told from the point of view of his wife, Eleanor. The 1978 NBC TV World Priemiere Movie was based on the 1976 Book ""My Luke and I"" by Eleanor Gehrig and Joseph Durso.

The time span covered is from just before the Gehrig's first meeting until Lou's death. This film is about husband and wife and their life in and around baseball in the thirties, not simply the Iron Horse story of the forties film.

I have viewed the movie several times and just recently acquired and read the book. The film is extremely true to the facts set forth in the book and sheds a different light on the relationships between Gehrig and his wife, his mother, and his teammate, Babe Ruth. Blythe Danner is excellent as usual while portraying Eleanor Gehrig at several different ages.

Just as Gary Cooper was physically miscast in ""The Pride of the Yankees"" so was Edward Herrmann in this film. However, they both did admirable jobs in getting the character of Gehrig right in so far as the goal of each film was concerned.

Because he was not a teammate of either Babe Ruth or Joe DiMaggio in 1935, some persons believe that Gehrig flourished in the shadow of others and use his sub par (by Gehrig's standards only) 1935 season as an example. However, there are several other more likely reasons for his 1935 performance.

In the book we learn that even after his triple crown winning performance in 1934 Gehrig went through a long salary dispute and threatened holdout with Jacob Ruppert, the Yankees tight-fisted owner. The dispute was over a $1,000 difference in salary with Lou eventually accepting $39,000 instead of $40,000. Eleanor states in the book that Lou was disheartened by his perceived unfair treatment at the hands of Ruppert.

Also, despite the fact that this movie does a much better job of realistically depicting the onset of the disease than the previous version, it doesn't have the time to go into the time-line and details. Gehrig was actually having sporadic and unexplained bouts of extreme pain, which started in 1935. Only his resolve, dedication to excellence and work ethic allowed him to continue to put up big numbers for a few more years.

The style of the film is a little different, as it makes frequent use of the flashback, in fact starting with Mrs. Gehrig talking to the writer, Durso, in present day Yankee stadium and telling her story to him there. We then have moments of fun as the Gehrigs meet, court, marry and enjoy life, interspersed with moments of grief as the disease begins to take its toll.

An interesting supporting cast, a beautiful musical theme and some tasteful directing make this one of the best small budget T.V. movies that I have ever seen. I highly recommend it.",1279756800,4,2828,4.676056338028169

The mail service was quite quick, as I received in less time than estimated.",1236038400,,271,3.533333333333333
7911537,4,B00000IQCI,"The classic 1943 film ""The Pride of the Yankees"" really was more of a love story that a baseball story in telling about the life of the New York Yankees Hall of Fame first baseman Lou Gehrig.  In 1976 Gehrig's widow Eleanor decided to tell their story again, writing ""My Luke and I"" with sportswriter Joe Durso.  A year later the book was turned into this made-for-television movie starring Blythe Danner and Edward Herrmann as Eleanor and Lou Gehrig.  The movie was supposed to air on October 9, 1977, but was pre-empted by Game 5 of the American League Championship series in which the Yankees scored three runs in the top of the 9th inning to defeat the Kansas City Royals for the second year in a row.
Directed by Fielder Cook, ""A Love Affair: The Eleanor and Lou Gehrig Story"" begins with the elderly Eleanor telling her life's story to Durso (Robert Burr) at Yankee Stadium in a series of flashbacks.  Eleanor tells of how she met Lou Gehrig on a blind date in 1933 and discovered there were two problems to them having a relationship.  The first was that the ballplayer was painfully shy.  The second and much bigger problem was that Gehrig had a domineering and possessive mother, played by Patricia Neal with such a heavy accent you have to turn on the closed captioning at times to really understand what she is saying.  But even so she is still a frightening figure.  If there is one thing that proves to you how incredibly strong was the love between Lou and Eleanor Gehrig it is that he ever had the nerve to leave his mother and marry somebody else, let along a socialte from Chicago to elope with her ""Luke"" in 1934.  As was the case when I read the book, the idea that Eleanor had her own name for her husband that no one else used makes a great deal of sense to me from a psychological perspective.  One of the strengths of this film is that like the book Blanche Hanalis' script deals specifically and explicitly with the battle of wills between these two women over this one man.
Another key part of the story covers how the relationship between Gehrig and Babe Ruth (Ramon Beiri) became strained during a goodwill trip to Japan where the Bambino had his new wife, Claire (Georgia Engel) along as well.  But the final and most significant difference between ""A Love Affair"" and the more familiar ""The Pride of the Yankees"" is that the story continues after Gehrig's emotional farewell speech at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939 to Eleanor being by his side through the final stages of amyotropic lateral sclerosis, including when he died less than two years later.
The point, of course, is that Eleanor Gehrig would not have traded the few years she had married to her husband for anything.  Ultimately, this made for television movie is a tribute to that love.  Hermann, hardly the athletic type, had to learn to bat left handed for the role, and is rarely seen actually playing baseball.  But he captures the dignity of Gehrig, his strength as a baseball player, and, most importantly, his love for his wife in the face of his mother's stern disapproval.  Baseball fans might be disappointed by the lack of action in this film, but the title was a big clue that this film is really more for romantics, which might make it a really good date movie.",1083888000,21,3266,4.558974358974359
