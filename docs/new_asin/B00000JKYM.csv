1233387,1,B00000JKYM,"my dumb feeders bought  this for me as a holiday gift.
they dragged me in right in front of the tv after a few minutes i pawed once at the tv. seeing that there were no real birds to eat i walked away. i returned later to find my feeders still sitting in fornt of the set. how stupid can these large animals be? don't they realize that it's just tv. it's not real.
as for the movie  it had no plot, cheesy dialogue and precious little action. don't movie makers realizes that cats' eyes are different than feeders'. we respond to movement. there wasn't much of that.
feeders listen up, if your cat is dumb enough to watch this b-grade movie that you were dumb enough to buy  you deserve each other. am i being a bit harsh.
so what I'm a cat

1233388,5,B00000JKYM,"An absolutely MUST HAVE for cat lovers, this video captivates your entire cat household!  Talk about ""pussanality""!
Initially I thought it would be a waste of time, but after about 3 minutes, things really got interesting, all the cats in our house were watching T.V.  Go figure, felines watching television!
If you really love your cats, and want to entertain them as well as yourself watching them watch and interact with the television, this is for you!  Believe me after watching this the feline's going to be mutual.....",1004918400,,525,4.943181818181818
1233389,3,B00000JKYM,"The technical information for this video indicates that the ""run time"" is 60 minutes. It is not, it is only 25 minutes. This is serious mis-representation and a rip-off!  The video itself is OK but overpriced for only 25 minutes.",972864000,18,229,4.725
1233390,5,B00000JKYM,"VIDEO CATNIP is every indoor cat's DREAM COME TRUE!  What is VIDEO CATNIP?  It's a bit of the great outdoors you can bring into your livingroom and  slip right into your VCR!  It features close-ups of skittering squirrels  and twittering birds that really get my 5 year old cat, Calvin's, wild  instincts revved up!  He even knows what the box looks like by now, and  when I take it out, he claims his spot right in front of the TV!  It's  hysterical!  Then, he'll get all excited; ""stalking"" the critters  on the screen in front of him.  I must admit; I have as much fun watching  him watch the video, as he has watching it!  My opinion is that VIDEO  CATNIP is the perfect antidote to every indoor cat's case of cabin fever!

1233413,4,B00000JKYM,"When my cats aren't watching it, I watch it instead of reality TV!!
Just kidding, but I would watch this before reality TV. Or poker. Or fashion tips from Al Davis. One reviewer said in the review title ""I May Have To Rethink This"". I had to rethink where the TV was, since my pals were trying to get inside, atop, & behind the TV cabinet. As for the reviewer who panned this, Dude, you didn't pay full price did you? Bummer. I paid $2 at a thrift store, & would actually go as high as $10. BAD music, but it's better than listening to Britney(yes, I know, anything would be). I put this on, pull a couple of chairs up in front of the tube, start it running, put los gatos on the chairs, & wait for the chattering to start. With this, and the suction cup mount feeder on the front window, my cats are happy guys. Weird, but happy.",1223683200,,830,4.12962962962963
1233414,2,B00000JKYM,"The whole first 10 minutes of this tape has silly slapstick music and old fashioned captions like from a silent movie.  It shows birds and animals, but the sound is completely unrelated to the action.  Two cats passed through the room on their way elsewhere and did not stop to watch.  They didn't even notice it.  I was watching it thinking, ""Duh, did they not think to put some nature sounds on here?  On a video for cats?!  How dumb is that?""  About 10 minutes in, the soundtrack changes to bird calls and nature sounds, and the cats started watching.  ""Oh,"" I said.  But what that whole first sequence had been for was never explained.  Once the soundtrack changed to one that fit the picture, it got their attention and the cats were totally into it.  They stood rapt and mesmerized, sometimes batting at the tv, sometimes trying to go behind it to find the critters they figured were behind the glass.  It's got squirrels, birds of all types, and one chipmunk, I think, cavorting to the peaceful sounds of birds and nature.  I thought the sound now was very restful and enjoyable.  I could meditate to that while the cats have a good time.  But a second disappointment quickly follows when you discover the tape is over in about 25 minutes.  Then the screen goes blue, and it's worse than if you just left on CNN for them.  Dudes, I bought this tape to entertain very bored, attention deficit cats who are often alone all day.  25 minutes of video, 10 of which are accompanied by Benny Hill music, doesn't come anywhere near to doing the job.  If it had an endless loop capability, you might get away with it (although I suspect they're smart enough to figure out it's the same thing over and over).  But it doesn't even have that.  Which makes that first 10 minutes an especially dumb waste of space.  It's as if the makers thought the video needed something to occupy bored cat owners too, and birds hopping to the sound of silly slapstick music was it.  I still can't figure out what that can possibly be for.  A good video for cats would have a copyright warning of 3 seconds and then right into the bird action with exclusively nature sounds throughout.  It would be a minimum two hours long, or have a loop capability so that it can go all day.  Because they did enjoy the part of it that's clearly for cats, and the picture and sound are good, where they make sense, I have to give this some credit.  But because it would have been so easy to make this so much better but they didn't, all around, a 2 is about as good as I can give this.",1168214400,2,2550,4.381663113006397
1233415,5,B00000JKYM,this product held my cats interest for quite a while. i loved watching their heads follow the bird and squirrel as they went around the tv screen. true entertainment and stimulation for the cats.,1152403200,2,195,4.764705882352941
1233416,1,B00000JKYM,"I have the DVD version and frankly, my kitten could care less.  On our 60"" screen, the birds are larger than my kitty!  I don't think she sees them as prey, but rather something that could EAT her!

There are WAY too many close up images, where the bird fills the whole screen, as the animal moves, the camera pans across to follow the bird.  IMO this deprives the cat of the sensation of the prey moving away/across.

It makes me want to get out my camera and tripod, throw some bird feed out there and let them have at it.",1148428800,2,524,4.148514851485149
1233417,1,B00000JKYM,"This video only runs for 25 minutes!!! If you don't count the opening, it's less than 20 minutes. This is a bit of a rip-off. I wouldn't mind so much if it was good, but it's not. My girlfriend's cat watched bits of it the first time we played it, then ignored it after that. Her cat loves TV if there's some action, but video catnip has too many bits where not much happens.
For us, it's torture to listen to! Even though it's made for cats, it should be nice, like a nature film, to have on in the background.
A friend bought the DVD version because it's longer, but when we watched it it was even worse. It just had even more out of focus and wobbly boring shots just to pad it out. Also, terrible wind noise.

My summary? A waste of money!!!",1132272000,10,745,4.102739726027397
1233418,1,B00000JKYM,"This is nothing more than a home movie, being sold as a professional product. While my cat enjoys some of it (but only after the noisy cheesy opening has finished), it is annoying to have on. The images are blurry in places and the sound is full of wind noise. It may have been good at the time it was made (1989) but by today's standards this video is poor.

My 12 year old son could make a better program!",1132012800,5,407,4.0875
1233419,5,B00000JKYM,"2/3 of my cats LOVE this video. The one that doesn't... doesn't watch television at all. I have 2 cats that I've caught watching TV from time to time. But, this video IS Video Catnip to them. They react so much differently to this than anything else. I have pictures of them attacking the screen! It's hilarious to watch them get so consumed with the television. However, if your cat doesn't watch TV anyway, than buying this tape is a waste of money. Some cats do, some don't. I'm waiting for it to come out on DVD!",1131408000,5,516,4.329896907216495
1233420,5,B00000JKYM,"From the very start this video entertained my cats.  Now when the very first notes of the music start, they come running to the TV.  They sit in front of the screen, wondering where the little critters and birds run off to.  Could it be behind the TV?  The chipmunks are their absolute favorites.  Yes, I am one of those cat moms who spoil their kitties, and I occasionally set the tape up on my way out the door in the morning and for the TV to shut off in 45 minutes.  You will laugh at your cat's antics.  Skeptics will be won over immediately.",1129420800,3,547,4.152380952380953
1233431,1,B00000JKYM,"After reading the reviews, I thought it'd be a good way to entertain my cat, who enjoys watching animal shows on TV.  The quality of the video is not good, however, and more importantly, my cat did not want to watch it at all, even though I held her pointing at it several times.  Bottom line is that I think it's a great concept and apparently some cats may like it, but mine did not.",1127088000,5,385,4.12
1233432,5,B00000JKYM,"In reference to the review by ""Sweetviolet79"", this IS available in DVD format, as a continuous loop!!!!!
I bought it directly from the producer/directer/cameraman, Steve.  His website is [...]  Great guy!
The DVD sound and picture are terrific (for the gentleman who complained about this on the VHS tape).  Two of our three feline boys were absolutely mesmerized!  (The third is 16 and a little deaf.  Apparently sound DOES play an important part of the movie's attraction.)
I think ""Video Catnip"" is to cats, what ""Sesame Street"" is to toddlers!  It's a great cat sitting device!",1080864000,8,582,5.010416666666667
1233433,4,B00000JKYM,"There's not much new I can say about this sort a video, it's your basic ""home video"" style recordings of birds and squirrels. My cat loves this video and I find it amusing watching her watch tv. The sound quality is pretty good too, It's great for a little background noise... My only complaint is this, it's too short. There's a positively boring ""bird bloopers"" section meant for human entertainment, but I feel it would've been time better spent -minus the cheesy circus music- formatted for the cats. It also would've been nice to have it on DVD with a loop feature. Anyway, all things considered, this video is definitly wourth buying.",1079308800,11,640,4.723214285714286
1233434,1,B00000JKYM,"This video is not a quaility video. It is blurry. My cats do not like this, maybe because of the music a big animals. It scares all of my cats.

1233435,5,B00000JKYM,"We have a small multitude of cats and this is by far one of the best purchases we have ever made in regards to them. Our cats run the gamut in terms of personalities - shy, brave, etc. They all come out of the woodwork when we put this tape in the VCR as they know that their ""show"" is coming on TV. We have a 60"" projection tv so this makes it even more fun. It is extremely entertaining from a cat perspective - close ups on birds, squirrels, etc. Our cats will sometimes even try to jump at the screen. We wholeheartedly recommend this if you want to buy something different and entertaining for your babies.",1039910400,,611,4.186440677966102
1233436,4,B00000JKYM,"I could not believe the response my two cats gave this video.  They were so engrossed I couldn't get them to respond to my petting, pulling on their tails, calling them.  They just got out of my way & went back to staring at the screen.  I died laughing at their hypnotized stares at birds, squirrels & other animals & attempts to catch them.  I only gave it 4 stars though, the first 10 minutes or so is a produced thing that has loud annoying music that seemed to irritate & distract my kits.  Fortunately it moved on to nature sounds and natural scenes.  Create a couch-potato, tv-junkie cat.  Buy this video.",1038873600,6,612,4.410714285714286
1233437,3,B00000JKYM,"That's right, my wife's catloving old maid of a sister bought this ridiculous video for my wife and her annoying tabby, Bobo. ""Video Catnip"" is a 25-minute video assault meant to amuse cats and their idiotic owners and is basically nothing more than annoying music (at the onset) and nature sounds (i.e., squirrel squawks and bird chirps) along with actual footage of some of the animals Bobo likes to chase around the backyard. I must confess I don't really see the sense in this, but sis' thought this the perfect gift (if you could have seen her fat face light up when she presented this gift to Bobo for his fourteenth birthday you would truly pity Hoppy--note to reader: thoroughly investigate your girl's family before committing)!
I give the video three stars because it does actually get the cat's attention (although not all the time and not every time). Bobo's little catsnout smashed into my 30"" flatscreen television nearly everytime a bird took flight (not often enough for my taste) and his little head would twitch in an effort to discern where these tempting sights and sounds were coming from (the tv?). As a viewer, I would've prefered all nature sounds to the annoying music at the beginning, but must confess the natural scenery throughout was real enough to get Bobo's attention. I wonder if a video of viscious dogs would also get Bobo's attention???",1017878400,3,1372,4.842553191489362
1233438,4,B00000JKYM,"We have four cats, so we figured at least one of them would be interested. For the first half of the tape, they ignored it. Then something caught the attention of one of them, and soon there were four cats crowded around the screen watching. The TV is up against a wall shared with a bathroom, and one cat kept running into the bathroom to see if the birds were there. Another kept jumping up to try to get into the TV. The other two just patted the screen. A good time was had by all of them, and if we don't play it too often, they can still be captivated by it.
The bad news is that I find the sound to be unbelievably annoying, so I have to wear headphones and listen to something else while the video is playing.",1016668800,8,717,4.056338028169014
1233439,4,B00000JKYM,Our three cats were mesmerized by the movie. I think we got as much entertainment watching them as they got from watching the birds! We finally had to pull three stools up to the TV for them to watch in comfort and to be able to touch the screen. What a hoot! You might try fast forward through the first part of the video. It has music that is a little distracting. The cats really prefered just the bird sounds.,1012176000,,413,4.175
1233440,2,B00000JKYM,"I greatly anticipated the arrival of ""Video Catnip."" As soon as it came, I played it for my cat.  Her reaction was not what I had expected it to be.  She looked at it only when I held her in front of the television screen, then she began squirming to get down. She had something to eat, tended to her grooming, sat down on a shoe, and then finally exited the house through her cat door.  I tried once more a couple of days later; her interest increased only a slight bit when unexpectedly, I saw her run towards the television and put her paws on the screen.  For some reason, just one bird eating seed on a log and then flying off, captured her attention. Subsequently, she left the room.  I lent the tape to my dad for his cat to see.  His cat had the same reaction as mine did. I'm sorry I spent the (money). Now that tape will be stored in the cabinet, most likely never watched again.",1008633600,,889,4.1395348837209305
