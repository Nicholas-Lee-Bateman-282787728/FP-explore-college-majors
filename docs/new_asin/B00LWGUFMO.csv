You either like, love or hate this bizarre kind of movie or you appreciate it.  To me this movie and other movies by people I mentioned are works of art. As macabre and dark as they may be they are still great art!  I like ""Wild At Heart"" and ""Blue Velvet"" for the same reasons.",1521849600,,416,4.111111111111111
