6935701,4,B00RUT3DWG,"The Book of Negroes sounds like a politically incorrect Golden Book, but it was really a 150-page document recorded in 1783a list of black loyalists who escaped being returned to slavery after the Revolutionary War because the British evacuated 3000 of them to work as freemen in their colony of Nova Scotia. In 2007, Canadian novelist Lawrence Hill tweaked and embellished that history to write The Book of Negroes, a still-cringeworthy title that was changed for U.S. audiences to Someone Knows My Name. He invented a central female character and a plot line loosely inspired by historical accounts, and Canadian director Clement Virgo adapted the book into a six-part TV miniseries that premiered first in Canada, then on the BET network in February 2015.

Thats the background of this excellent miniseries, which rivals Roots for its character development, plotting, and production values. Its a little more melodramatic than the 1977 Alex Haley miniseries and features a more upbeat (and, many would say, unlikely) story. Theres more idealism here than realism, but that also means its not as difficult to watchthough any depiction of slavery doesnt exactly make for a cheery evening in front of the TV set. Still, for families who are into history and who want their children to gain some understanding of the baggage that many North American blacks carry, The Book of Negroes is a good place to start.

It covers slightly different ground, too. Roots tended to demonize whites and focus on the cruelties that the slaves had to endure and the things they had to do to survive, whereas The Book of Negroes strives for slightly more moral balance. As with every slave movie or miniseries, we see bad slave owners and good. But in Negroes the rapes and consensual sex aren't nearly as graphic, and neither is the violence. Negroes primarily spotlights a strong heroine, whose journey we follow.

Aminata Diallo (Shailyn Pierre-Dixon) is abducted by slavers from her village in Mali, West Africa at the age of 11. But white slavers have helpers, and an equally young West African named Chekura (Siya Xaba) is paid to assist. He takes a shine to young Aminata and is kind to her, yet he doesnt do anything to keep her from being sent across the big river to South Carolina, where shes sold to plantation owner named Robertson Appleby (Grey Bryk).

Time passes and Aunjanue Ellis takes over the role of Aminata, while Lyriq Bent does the same with the character of Chekura. And they're both excellent. A strong performance was needed to carry the series, and Ellis delivers just the right blend of defiance, determination, and dignity. We quickly care about her characters struggles and cant help but admire her stubbornness and near-charismatic refusal to be anything less than who she knows she can be. This is her story, a story of one womans journey through slavery that started in Africa and would end in England.  Aminata attracts people to her with her positive attitude, so that she never wants for helpers. At the Appleby plantation a female slave with some power protects her from the advances of her owner, and after that the white and privileged wife of a New York City Jew who helps her read at a higher level and urges her husband to get her away from Appleby. In New York City its a free black bar owner nicknamed Black Sam (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who helps, while in Nova Scotia its an old beat-up preacher named Daddy Moses (Louis Gossett Jr., who also starred in Roots). But for every person who helps her, it seems that Aminata helps dozens more.

The Book of Negroes feels a bit like a fable, because Aminata is proof positive that knowledgethe ability to read, to write, and to speak more than one languageis, if not power, at least a ticket to opportunities and a life that demands respect. There isn't a better poster child for education than Aminata Diallo. She alone has knowledge of the midwifes skills, taught to her by her mother, and she learns to read and write at an early age. Those skills elevate her in and give her the ability to move in three different circles:  the rebels, the Tories and British occupiers, and the mixture of free and runaway slave blacks that live in a ramshackle New York City tent village.

A largely unknown cast does a fine job, with the only uneven performance coming from Gooding Jr., whose character is Jamaican and who cant seem to settle on a dialect. But his character is drawn so sympathetically that even this misstep is easy to overlook. Same with the plotting, which can seem, at times, as facile as a melodrama, because The Book of Negroes shines on two levels: as a compelling journey of a noble and strong female character, and as a glimpse into the life of slaves and free blacks thats situated smack in the middle of a festering colonial uprising, rather than the usual pre-Civil War settings.

Included with this DVD is a booklet that features an essay from novelist Hill, a map of Aminatas journey, and full cast credits.

Language:  Racist (n-word) throughout, other mild cursing
Sex:  Forced and consensual, with some (but not key) body parts shown
Violence:  Implied beheading, people stabbed and shot
Adult Situations:  Girl taken from mother and sold, slave mistreatment
Takeaway:  Education helps you get ahead in the world, and one person can make a difference

6935703,5,B00RUT3DWG,"This is, no doubt, one of the BEST films that I have ever seen in my life.  Remarkable, commendable performances!  I actually don't know where to begin with this review.  I just watched the whole thing, I couldn't stop, after each episode, the eyes, voice, pain, happiness, and yearning of beautiful Aminata, stays with you, long after one has moved away from the screen.  This is a most important, and very precious account of a largely unknown hero, legend, and catalyst, in the struggle to end the slave trade on a world wide basis.  Her story, her spirit, charm, faith, determination... took Aminata through an incredible and amazing journey.  It has touched me so very deeply!  It is a real MUST SEE film, that is long overdue.  Thank you for making this, and changing lives in doing so.",1426291200,17,792,4.688405797101449
6935704,5,B00RUT3DWG,"I read the book (Somebody Knows My Name) and found it mesmerizing. Watching the film, with the vibrant colors and gritty colonial period, enhanced the strength and beauty of the book version of Aminata Diallo.  The story is a must for any and all history buffs.  It gives you the brutal slave trade with it's middle passage death trap; plantation life and the trespass on a young female slave's virginity; Revolution, Rebels, Riot and Racial prejudice.  Odd that seeing an act of kindness from a white woman toward Aminata came across as untruthful after all the racial hatred and distrust being shown; such is the power of film. There's a beautiful love story that seems to carry the movie and shine forth its grace, but for me the movie's force was watching Aminata Diallo manipulate her way through men of slavery, war, abolition and law, while never forgetting her name, her peoples and her African home that she longed to return to. The Aminata character stands as a strong, surviving symbol of all the African women stolen and abused during that god-awful time. They live on in their descendants.

The power of educating one's self was never so evident in helping overcome one's struggles as in the story of Aminata Diallo. From her father's teaching her how to read and his test of her finding her way back to the village, to her interest in maps of Africa, Aminata never stopped learning and seeking out solutions to the challenging circumstances of being stolen and sold into slavery.",1425427200,32,1493,4.797665369649805
6935705,5,B00RUT3DWG,"The best, since Roots!  Aunjanue Ellis' acting is supurb! Her character is strong who triumphs in the end.  Takes up where Roots leaves off, the female version. If you like Roots, you will love The Book of Negroes!!",1425081600,,215,4.631578947368421

6935710,5,B00RUT3DWG,"This story was amazing. The tale of this woman who's education,Grace and perseverance should guide everyone in there fight and journey and never,never give up. It was at times heart wrenching and very sad and accurate as to the life of people in that era. I was moved and cried during many triumphs and tribulations of her journey. I couldn't help but wish that I had been there to help her. But she was a woman of pure strength and fight in her. I can't wait to read the book as I'm sure much has been missed or changed. I think this book or story should be read or watch by everyone no matter what nationality or culture. This was an excellent story.

I really like the way the story flows. It shows that bad things happened, but doesn't dwell on them. It's not gory. It's a sweeping historical lesson of events I didn't learn in school. I showed my mother, who borrowed it to share with other people.

6935742,5,B00RUT3DWG,"The Book Of Negroes

I missed this mini-series when it aired on BET during the 2015 season.  It is a powerful and true account of a Africans that were kidnapped and sold into American Slavery in the late 17th century.  I found the production to be intensely educational; the story follows the lives of real people that lived during the time period, and has given me a new understanding of the tenacity and will of my ancestors when faced with seemingly insurmountable circumstances in life.  It's given me a renewed pride of heritage, and a deeper understanding of what my ancestors went through; and has gifted me with a deeper sense of self-worth.  I highly recommend this series, currently presented on Hulu, without commercial interruption, in 6 episodes, approximately 45 minutes each.

6935752,4,B00RUT3DWG,"The Book of Negroes is a jarring take on slavery in the perspective of Aminata Diallo, a young girl who was taken from her village of Bayo to become enslaved in South Carolina. After watching the first episode, I can safely say that the series is a hard hitting and intriguing work of art. Though society does bring awareness to the fact that slavery was an embarrassing and shameful part of world history, I have found thus far that The Book of Negroes was the only piece of art that truly captured what slavery was like. The gruesome and graphic scenes not only made me turn away, but brought me close to tears. It was as if I could feel the pain and heartbreak Aminata felt. Within those mere 45 minutes, my perspective on slavery was shattered and rebuilt. I praise the show on it's use of very violent and graphic scenes, as in media today we have a tendency to water down the true events of history. No one truly understands what life was like for these people unless you show it. The Book of Negroes did exactly that and then some, proving it to be a true game changer in the representation of slavery in the media.",1455408000,,1122,4.373205741626794

6935809,3,B00RUT3DWG,"Great book...ambitious mini-series...disappointing result.  Not that this is particularly BAD, but, given the material and the potential--disappointing.

Some good performances, especially from Aunjanue Ellis, as the central character (seen more recently as Bobby Byrd's wife,soul singer Vicki, in the James Brown bio-pic, Get On Up.)  I've seen Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lou Gossett in much, much better--but their effect is limited, here.

My take on this mini-series is a little skewed because I do something I suspect most viewers don't: I look critically at sets and period details.  A couple of historically recreated/reclaimed period-piece towns stand in for various U.S. and British settlements--one in Nova Scotia--and the film-makers appear to make the most of what is available--but it's not enough. I wasn't fooled: only ONE ship (a two-masted schooner) stands for numerous vessels. Budgetary penny-pinching?  Likely. This hurts more by limited the viewers' visceral reaction to scenes of civil disorder during and after the American Revolution. Scenes that need hundreds of protesters make do with dozens. Time, labour and money-saving computer generation would have helped.

More to the point, the series lacks real emotional punch.  Blame that on the writing and perhaps the book's author, Hill, who has a strong hand in the screenplays here.  Sometimes print authors just can't make the leap to screen, and I hunch this was the case here.  More spirited direction might have compensated. Whatever--script, direction, budget--something was lacking.",1431907200,,1558,5.619658119658119

6935813,5,B00RUT3DWG,"Excellent! I would recommend this picture to any and everbody. The story really gives an outstanding view of what it was like to be an African captured into slavery. It shows how young women of that period of time struggled, through rapes, pregnancy failures, etc. And how men struggled to stay with their families and more. I really can't wait to read the novel.
