8140611,5,B000HOJNQQ,"The DVD is great, but it is the same as Frankie Valli Live, just a different release date, but same show with a few pictures added.",1193616000,7,131,4.076923076923077
8140612,4,B000HOJNQQ,"It is always a pleasure to see Frankie Valli in live concert, and to be able to watch his concert via DVD is especially nice.  Unfortunately, no one has had the real foresight to put out concert DVD's on Frankie Valli...as he is unlike so many other artists, and he changes his stageshow very often.  (I have seen the Everly Bros. over a ten year span in which they performed the same exact show so much that we could do a word-to-word introductions and talking of their show!)  Mr. Valli keeps his show up to date and fresh.  I have seen him perform probably a dozen times over the past 20 years and all shows have been completely different.  This DVD is the most current concert on the market that I have found.  Although there is no gimmicks in Mr. Valli's shows, his true talent and natural showmanship more than makes up for it.

If you love his music, you will find this DVD a pleasure to watch!",1186531200,23,901,4.3273809523809526
