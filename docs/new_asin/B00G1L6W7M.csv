8620120,5,B00G1L6W7M,"I just watched what I think is the content of this upcoming release. This seems to be largely the same edit as a 2006 British release entitled ""Judy Garland: Quiet Please, There's A Lady On Stage"" which I just watched via You Tube. I say largely, since the running time of the video I saw was 57 minutes. The running time listed for this new release is 51 minutes. Either the running time listed here is wrong (like the cover photo) or something may have been deleted from the show I saw. What I saw was a compilation of clips of Judy's solo singing from The Judy Garland Show. The clips are all from the series except for ""Over The Rainbow"", which is, like on Judy Garland: The Concert Years, taken from Judy's 1955 TV debut. If it wasn't for the fact that I got totally caught up in Judy's genius once again, I would have skimmed over this to get an idea of what we had here. The clips are arranged like a concert, and contain two of Judy's funny stories as told on her ""Born In A Trunk"" segments from her series. The editing is smooth but somewhat puzzling. ""Over The Rainbow"" immediatly segues into ""Battle Hymn Of The Republic"", and the standing ovation after ""Republic"" is cut off (unlike on The Concert Years), and swings into ""Come Rain Or Come Shine"", and the show just ends. No credits, nothing. Another annoyance was Judy's version of ""San Francisco"" mislabeled ""I Left My Heart In San Francisco"". (Every number has the song title on screen for the first few seconds). The clips are taken from the film versions of the show, rather than the restored video. That said, the quality of the video is very good, and of uniform quality, and the audio is just fine. This would be a good video for those who haven't got the actual Judy Garland Show or The Concert Years DVDs. Judy is just as great as ever, the ""concert"" format is, for the most part, pretty well done, and there are many treasured songs included, many from her Carnegie Hall concert. Just somebody DO something about that cover photo! Update: 12/23/13: Lo and behold! although there were only two reviews here, my own included, it seems that the people putting this DVD out have actually replaced Liza's picture with one of Judy for the cover! Granted, it looks like a 1940's still, but at least it's Judy! Maybe someone ""in the know"" over wherever they put this together realized this huge mistake in the cover art. Maybe they saw these reviews. Whatever, it's good that this was corrected!",1387152000,11,2461,4.520179372197309
