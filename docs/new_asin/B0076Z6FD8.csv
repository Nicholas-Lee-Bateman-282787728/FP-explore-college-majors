8511289,3,B0076Z6FD8,"Following its superb Swan Lake and Giselle productions, La Scala's 2006 La Bayadre is a disappointment that even world-class stars Svetlana Zakharova and Roberto Bolle cannot rescue. What we are given on this DVD is Natalia Makarova's three-act version with John Lanchbery's bowdlerized score. This staging could still result in a satisfying experience, but La Scala's fails on two significant counts -- the key supporting role and the corps de ballet.

As always, Zakharova performs wonderfully, executing the role of the Temple Dancer Nikiya to perfection. As Nikiya's inconstant lover, Bolle mostly does well, too, although he occasionally seems tentative as Solor, ill at ease. Maybe he senses something's not entirely balanced in this production.

All the elements, in fact, are not in balance. In addition to the two main roles, La Bayadre needs a third lead to play Gamzatti -- the Amneris to Nikiya's Ada. Sadly, Isabelle Brusson lacks the stage presence to match Zakharova and Bolle, and the absence of a third star is noticeable. For comparison, watch the sparks fly between Zakharova and Maria Alexandrova in the Bolshoi's 2013 La Bayadre&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minkus-La-Bayadere-Blu-Ray-Blu-ray/dp/B00DS7Z3O0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minkus: La Bayadere (Blu Ray) [Blu-ray</a>].

But the worst is yet to come -- the seemingly ill-prepared La Scala corps de ballet, which performed so outstandingly in Swan Lake and Giselle. What should be the hypnotic centerpiece of the show, the Kingdom of the Shades, looks more like a rehearsal here than a performance. Perhaps the filming was rushed. In that case, everyone should have waited and taken whatever time was necessary to do it right.

If the Kingdom of the Shades flops, La Bayadre flops. La Scala's flops.

Describing the performance history of La Bayadre as problematic understates the matter. Originally staged in St. Petersburg in 1877 in four acts and an apotheosis with music by court composer Ludwig Minkus, La Bayadre was one of the great successes of ballet master Marius Petipa, who spent six months preparing the premiere. Its celebrated Kingdom of the Shades scene was made even more memorable in Petipa's 1900 revival of the production.

By the time La Bayadre finally became known outside Russia in 1961, however, many hands had fiddled with the ballet's structure and choreography, and Minkus' original score had been lost. So when Makarova staged her own choreographed, three-act version of La Bayadre for the Royal Ballet in 1989, the music was re-orchestrated (or recomposed) by conductor Lanchbery, who was referred to in some circles as a ""musical butcher.""

In 1991, Rudolf Nureyev, then director of the Paris Opera Ballet, began putting together his own version of La Bayadre, which was presented at the Palais Garnier in 1992, with scenes arranged in a different order from Makarova's (omitting the scene of the destruction of the temple) but retaining Lanchberry's hack-job music score. Nureyev's lavish production, on which the Paris Opera Ballet spared no cost, added significantly to the fame of the Kingdom of the Shades.

But the original ballet seemed out of reach -- until 2000, when the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet began a reconstruction of Petipa's 1900 revival. As much of Petipa's original choreography as possible was restored, including the long-lost fourth act with its Dance of the Lotus Blossoms and the Grand Pas d'action that various productions had moved to other slots. Moreover, Minkus' complete, hand-written score had been located in the depths of the Mariinsky library and carefully put back together.

The new Kirov/Mariinsky version of the ""old"" La Bayadre was presented in 2002 -- to a controversial reception. The entrenched, conservative world of ballet does not seem to like change, even when (or perhaps especially when) it restores an original work that differs from what has become the accepted norm.

Until the Mariinsky can be persuaded to bring its reconstruction of La Bayadre out of mothballs, we'll have to settle for one or another adaptation for a hint of how spectacular this ballet could be. The Bolshoi recording mentioned above, which does not use Lanchbery's ""orchestration,"" does a much better job of that than La Scala's.",1411862400,5,4306,5.384843982169391

8511291,4,B0076Z6FD8,"Roberto Bolle rhymes with Black Hole in my book as he eats energy on stage, sapping the performances of others.  Errol Flynn did the same to Bette Davis in The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex, if you need another example.  That Svetlana overcomes him makes her an even greater ballerina.  The company on display manages to be adequate, i.e. get on and offstage without breaking their legs.  Whoever cast the role of Gamzatti must have been looking for Bolle's female counterpart.  I've got the Swan Lake and Giselle and so can say that the above remarks apply to them.  My overwhelming impression is that at La Scala, ballet is the Ugly Duckling which only occasionally shows signs of being a swan.

I bought all three to have records of Svetlana in them.  She is best in Bayadere.  I also recommend La Fille de Pharaon and not only for her performance.  It's a humdinger of a ballet.  Her dancing reminds me of La Divine Sylvie Guillem who was also pilloried for ""head-banging"", and inspired numerous imitators who missed the essential point, that it wasn't what she did but how.  What was true of La Divine Sylvie is true of Svetlana.  I saw Sylvie in Bayadere and she was nothing less than brilliant.  So I can compare the two easily.  Svetlana's Nikiya is human, warm and passionate and despairing in Act I; in Acts II and III, she transcends those emotions, becoming an other-worldly vision for Solor, the voice of his conscience speaking to him alone.  By itself, that is a huge achievement and rendered even greater as she was given no help at all.

Unlike many who may read this, I was actually in the Met Opera House on the night of the first performance of Natasha's version.  I've now lost count of the number of times I saw American Ballet Theatre perform it, and have seen the Royal do so at Covent Garden.  I've also seen the Paris Opera Ballet perform Rudolf's version in Paris, New York and Washington.  As a result, I take considerable exception to the reviewer who said Nathasha's is inferior.  Her last act is chilling.  Act I, Scene 2 involves a real cat fight that could have come from a silent movie, in the right hands it's not a ballet version of a cat fight, but the real thing and is one of the high points of the ballet.  I have characterized this ballet as Sex, Drugs and Rock and Roll, because Solor pledges his troth to Nikiya, but isn't averse to bedding Gamzati.  The Shades Act is his opium dream.  The god's destruction of his temple provides the rocks and in the twinkling of an eye the apotheosis becomes everything a nirvana should be.  It's easy to praise the Maryinski corps in the Shades Act, but for ABT's to achieve their stunning level of perfection is far more praiseworthy given the struggle the girls had to make to create a similar style of dancing from their wildly disparate backgrounds.  I never saw the POB come anywhere close to the level of commitment and interpretation that ABT and the Royal brought to the ballet.  As they are the greatest company in the world, I had to wonder why, but then they'd not had the years spent dancing it.  I cannot find it in my heart to lament the cuts Natasha made, the story flows more smoothly as does the betrothal scene.  I've got the Komleva version and was distinctly underwhelmed.  Of course, that's largely her fault but everyone else lent her a helping hand.  So what we do know from Komleva's is that Natasha and Rudolf were working from the same script and the devil is in the details.  Natasha wins on points.  From the dance perspective, Natasha, la divine Sylvie, Elizabeth Platel, Altynai and Svetlana far outshine everybody else I've ever seen as Nikiya.  What's truly sad is that only the last two are available on videos.

The bottom line here is that Natasha's version makes the story live and that Svetlana is magnificence personified.  La Bayadere is musically and choreographically well ahead of the pack in general and Svetlana is the icing on the cake.",1345766400,2,3969,4.602564102564102
