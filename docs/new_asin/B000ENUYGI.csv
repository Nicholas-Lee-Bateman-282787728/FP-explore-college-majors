2524210,5,B000ENUYGI,This is a great series that Denis Leary starred in. Blows Emergency away!,1404259200,,73,4.6923076923076925
2524211,1,B000ENUYGI,This was a brainless series from FX . The actors all have brick wall personalities and the plots are stupid . Just mindless soap opera garbage .,1397347200,,144,4.37037037037037
2524212,5,B000ENUYGI,"After watching Rescue Me seasons 1/2 on Amazon Prime Instant video, I started the 3rd season.  4 episodes into the 3rd season, Amazon made all Rescue Me seasons viewable for a FEE only - it is no longer free with the Prime membership.  Very disappointing.",1394755200,,255,4.644444444444445

2524214,5,B000ENUYGI,I liked this whole series very much till you took it off prime.  Now I will never finish it. Too bad.,1394236800,,101,3.8095238095238093

2524216,4,B000ENUYGI,Wish I watched it ten years ago when it was on.  Denis Leary is so funny.  A must watch! Only have about 75 more episodes to go,1393372800,,127,3.6666666666666665
2524217,5,B000ENUYGI,"Read my review of season One - season Two is every bit as good.  Tommy still hanging on by his fingernails - dealing (in his own way) w/whatever life throws at him...pretty much everything, but the kitchen sink.  Fearlessness is the ultimate attribute...",1391212800,,254,4.883720930232558
2524218,5,B000ENUYGI,"This is one of the best shows ever. Totally hooked!!!  It's drama, comedy, action all in one. I wish they were making new episodes.",1391040000,,131,4.458333333333333
2524219,5,B000ENUYGI,"This TV show just got better and better with every season.  The premise of a damaged fireman who is dealing with the aftermath of 911 was handled very well.  There are lots of twists and turns, laugh out loud fun, and completely unexpected complications, as the story of the men in one New York firehouse is told.",1390780800,,313,4.473684210526316
2524220,2,B000ENUYGI,"I watched all of the seasons intermittently and found a running theme which was Booze, Blowjobs, & Drugs. At first, the writer injected more fire fighting scenes. Later it was more about BB&D; it was over kill thereby taking away from the story line. I ended up feeling like I needed to be rescued.",1389916800,,298,4.537037037037037
2524221,5,B000ENUYGI,"Entertaining show. Always can count on a great laugh. At the same time, serious messages stand out and stick with you.",1389484800,,118,4.666666666666667
2524222,5,B000ENUYGI,The series started out small and sum what calm. It is now so gripping that I can't stop watching it.,1388361600,,100,4.05
2524223,5,B000ENUYGI,"Excellently done.  It's a wonderful program, every episode made me both cry and laugh at some point.  You will love it.",1383696000,,119,4.619047619047619
2524224,5,B000ENUYGI,"One of my favorite series of all time. Is it accurate? Yes and No, but I do like how it depicts the emotions of being a firefighter. There is a lot of emotion and people resort to a lot of different ways to let it out.",1380585600,,218,3.760869565217391
2524225,4,B000ENUYGI,"You likely wouldn't have watched this if you weren't a follower of this series; after all, Season 2 jumps right into the fray with the same characters going ever deeper into their world of emotional goop. These are men (basically, except for the strong women leads who seem to provide much of the logical balance here) who are either tough guys from their childhoods to too idiotic to do much else other than work out and show up for work. But what catches you is that this is a brief portrayal of real life. Who hasn't known a Tommy or Franco or Chief who drinks too much, is too horny or thinks the world revolves around him because he's always right? Homophobic? Check! Refuse to change because you can bluff your way out of a Tyvek bag? Check! Think women are here to serve and that's just the way it should be? Check! Ignorance is bliss? Check! So naturally, the world has to show these folks a bit of reality, that the rolling ball has a kink in a corner and sometimes skews off course...the onset of Alzheimers, the love of your life making you realize she's really fed up and good luck finding someone else, the half brother and half sister entering your life from the blind side. All in all, Season 2 digs up another set of dramas that carry on the tradition of Season 1...in fact, this season seems to have settled down a bit as if to say, ""okay, now that I've got your attention, let's get to it."" Worth watching if you're a fan...",1377907200,,1442,4.364312267657993
2524226,2,B000ENUYGI,Meh Took a turn to the strange. I really wanted to like it. I got all the way to the 5th episode and just couldn't take anymore. I like the actors. Storyline was the bummer part.,1376611200,,178,3.9722222222222223
2524227,5,B000ENUYGI,"One of the best dramas of all time. When it was on in prime time, I never missed an episode.",1376611200,,92,3.65
2524228,5,B000ENUYGI,"Great writing, acting and story. Very believable, very no holds bared and indepth into real firefighters. Too bad it is not a 26 episode season.",1375056000,,144,4.8
2524229,4,B000ENUYGI,"My boyfriend got me interested in this show.  It's vulgar and sexually explicit and you can tell it comes from a man's brain.  But still, I like it!  Go figure.  It shows the difficulties in families and with substance abuse and how relationships are difficult but it I needed something to replace The West Wing when we finished watching all of the seasons of that and this is what interested me at the time.",1374796800,,408,4.472972972972973
2524230,5,B000ENUYGI,Bought this as a gift for my sister and she loved it.  After she watched it she loaned it to me and I watched it.  Loved this show and was sad to see it end.,1372377600,,157,3.4571428571428573
2524231,4,B000ENUYGI,"Overall a good show, includes humor, drama. We've seen bits and pieces of Rescue Me, finally watching all the season.",1368144000,,117,4.9
2524232,5,B000ENUYGI,I love this show.  I can not put it down.  Can not wait to watch the next episode.  Not enough time in the day!!!,1364860800,,113,3.625
2524233,5,B000ENUYGI,Denis and the gang crack me up.  DVD set arrived on time -no issues.  Love this series.  I am a fan.,1364083200,,100,3.6666666666666665
2524234,5,B000ENUYGI,"Alternating between insanely funny and agonizingly painful, this is a brilliant homage to screwed-up humanity at its best/worst. Not to be missed if you can take it!",1364083200,,165,5.148148148148148
2524235,5,B000ENUYGI,"This show will shock you, make you laugh and drive you crazy and maybe even get some tears out of you.  It is good, not politically correct at all and it is an FX show so there is no holding back with this show.  I love it though.",1362960000,,230,3.7708333333333335
2524236,5,B000ENUYGI,"This was an awesome DVD, but if you watch Rescue Me, you would do better to get the complete series, cuz you will not want to stop at just one season.",1362700800,,150,3.870967741935484
2524237,3,B000ENUYGI,"Rescue Me we found disappointing and not what we hoped from an acclaimed show.  The first couple of episodes were okay, but the story falls apart and it becomes rather sleazy.  Denis Leary fans will like, but probably not love this series.  I suppose if it had been as good as the hype, it would have lasted longer than it did.",1362614400,,327,4.327868852459017
2524238,5,B000ENUYGI,"I'm completely hooked on this Rescue Me series!  The character development continues to be excellent, and the writing is outstanding.  One minute I'm laughing out loud, the next I'm biting my nails in suspense.  I have to force myself to put the remote down!! Marathoning this show is way too easy!",1361836800,,298,4.803921568627451
2524239,5,B000ENUYGI,I would recommend this show to everyone of my friends. I love the comedy aspect as well as the drama and seriousness of the show. Amazing.,1361836800,,138,4.346153846153846
2524240,5,B000ENUYGI,"First, it's totally for adults.  This show is certainly not kid-friendly.  But if you want real reality TV, then watch the series.  If possible, watch it on your Roku player.

Don't have a Roku?  Then invest in a Kindle Fire.  That'll do until you can get one to watch the entire series.

Don't miss this show!",1360800000,,310,4.428571428571429
2524251,5,B000ENUYGI,cannot get enough of this show and had to purchase the disc so i can watch more! show is a must see!,1359849600,,100,3.590909090909091
2524252,5,B000ENUYGI,"Great show, sorry to see that it has gone.  The DVD itself was perfect in every way, shipped quickly and packaged well.",1357689600,,119,4.409090909090909
2524253,5,B000ENUYGI,My daughter came to this show late and is catching up on past episodes; this is one of my favorite seasons and she is watching it now,1356393600,,133,3.962962962962963
2524254,5,B000ENUYGI,"I often, sadly, find myself late to the party of great television shows until they are near the end or in their final season. That was the case with Rescue Me. Although I have long since been a fan of Denis Leary's, I didn't begin watching the show until the series finale episode! I was moved but of course, needed to know what events transpired up until that end episode I watched. I didn't realize the show had so many seasons and now that I have watched all of them (in one week--I was addicted!!!) I am SO sad that I didn't watch week by week with the rest of the world when I had my chance.

The show has many rough edges but that is what makes it fascinating; underneath it all lies, in my opinion, a very poignant television experience.
Many, many times the show reminded me of some Cinemax late night, soft core porn but, with actors demonstrating such depth and male characters who were EXTREMELY easy on the eyes, I managed to get through it.

Looking past the risque sex scenes episode after episode laid a very poignant tale of men; of brothers and their many escapades through life. There are some annoying roles too (most in part by Sheila)but even those characters come alive for me. I cannot help but feel I may have despised Sheila the most towards the end because I related to her slightly; wanting to fill the void left by the love of another, for another who simply cannot be kept entirely by her.

Most importantly I must say, never has a fictionalized television show (with the one exception of HBO's Newsroom episode 5/1) have a felt such a serge of energy or truth or emotion for the FDNY and what they went through on 9/11. I remember exactly where I was, who I was with, what I was doing and what I did immediately following the first broadcast on that day. I remember how I felt afterwards, and the images that filled my mind but unbelievably, I never, not once, considered the men who rushed in to save or in search of the people who survived and those who did not. I never recognized at that time, those men who gave their lives that day, nor the lives they lived up until 9/11.
Rescue Me isn't all 9/11 but that is the premise of the show. It is about so much more; about family, friends, bonds we form and break. It is about faith and spirituality and what we do with the lessons we learn. I LOVE this show and I will recommend it to all.

You don't have to watch it all at once the way I did, but you will probably want to.",1346544000,,2456,4.275268817204301
2524255,1,B000ENUYGI,"Unhappy about purchase, item was listed as new, item came in 4 cases and was originally a blockbuster rental dvd. While the dvds where in good condition the item wasn't what was explained upon purchasing. After all that they all worked fine but I'm still not happy about being mislead on the purchase, I wouldn't reccomend buying from this seller again.",1339891200,,353,4.80327868852459

2524258,5,B000ENUYGI,I highly recommend buying Season 2 and the entire series.  I am very late to the Rescue Me party but better late than never!  I really enjoyed this season and am currently playing catch up to prepare for the final season this summer.,1305072000,,233,4.395348837209302
2524259,5,B000ENUYGI,I'm so glad a friend of mine told me about this show. After seeing one episode I went out and bought all of the seasons that were out on DVD. You really can get in to the plot and the acting is terrific. They don't hold anything back and you really can connect with each character.,1280966400,,281,4.035714285714286
2524260,4,B000ENUYGI,"Love the series.  Love the characters.  Somewhat indulgent at times, it is still one of the best paced and well written comedy/dramas in my memory (A long, but perhaps flawed one).  Leary's ensemble of supporting actors are terrific:  Not a weak link in the chain.  I avoid watching the program on FX: One hour a week apart would be too frustrating, as once I'm locked into the first episode on DVD I'm lost in the season for hours on end.  Well worth the journey.",1278547200,,464,4.464285714285714

2524262,5,B000ENUYGI,"While I am really anti-Denis Leary, I LOVE his work with this show. It is very much a man's show but it's gripping and very hard to put away once you start. I can't even describe what makes this show so captivating. It's pulls on emotions and is a dedication to the lives of firefighters after 9/11",1258156800,,298,4.245614035087719

it was shipped in a good time and in good condition",1215648000,,75,3.75
2524267,5,B000ENUYGI,"At least, everyone on this show does!  Tommy Gavin goes sober after years of drinking, reconnects with his wife and kids, and even tries being mellow for a while...only to see everything torn asunder by the death of a family member, the loss of potential millions after his dad's newest wife departs, the abuse of his mistress by her sometime girlfriend, and another close call on the job.
In the meantime, the other firefighters contend with the heartbreak of a spouse with Alzheimer's, the departure of the only female in their squad, a girlfriend who turns out to be a crook, a painkiller dependence, and more.
Everyone, especially Denis Leary, gives a strong performance as we see more layers of complexity develop in these characters over the course of the second season.  Tatum O'Neal appears late in the season as Tommy's fiery, troubled sister as well.
I wonder if things could possibly get any worse for these folks in season 3!",1199923200,,937,4.813664596273292

I understand english, but I miss subtitle/closed caption option.",1198627200,,330,4.910714285714286
2524270,5,B000ENUYGI,"A lot of shows will go into what is known as a ""sophomore slump"".  That is to say that while the show is still good, it loses something to its edge that the previous season had.

Completely not the case with this show.

We start of with our fallible hero, Tommy Gavin, looking for his children, who disappeared with his soon to be ex-wife at the end of Season 1.  He is no longer working at his old house, having transferred out after nearly causing Franco (Daniel Sunjata) to die and getting constant grief over his affair with his dead cousin's widow, Sheila (an amazing Callie Thorne).

This season had some of the best sub-plots I have ever seen, both comical and serious.  You have Gavin's constant drama (Sheila's pregnancy, his constant battle with the bottle, his newfound ""family"", and one life changing tragedy).  Of course we have Franco (single fatherhood, battling addiction to Vicodin, and his relationship with Lauar Miles (a great Diane Farr)).  Chief Riley (Jack McGee) has his own demons (his gay son, and his wife battling Alzheimer's)

But probably one of the funniest plots of the whole season revolves around Miles and Lou.  During a fire, there is a heated exchange between the two in which the latter calls the former a very bad name.  This leads to a grievance being filed and the whole house must attend sensitivity training.  Trust me, an episode you cannot miss.

From start to finish, each episode is top notch.  And unlike other shows, not every plotline is wrapped up neatly with a bow on it.  Sadly, this seaon marks the departure of Diane Farr, who held her own and even stole a lot of scenes from her male counterparts.

This season is a sure thing.  BUY IT!!",1196467200,,1693,4.62751677852349

The portrayal of each of the firefighters and the world in which they live (post 9/11, post divorces) is treated with a surprisingly gentle touch. It's as if the writers (including co-creator and star Leary) recognize and respect certain human frailties and wish to shine a loving light on them, rather than exploit these frailties, as other 'cops/lawyers/doctors' shows do. The depth and breadth of the work only gets more fascinating in the second season. Highly recommended.",1165881600,,597,5.040404040404041

2524307,5,B000ENUYGI,"in an earlier review, it was written that this is the best drama

on tv since ""nypd blue"".don't mean to be critical, but the only

time ""nypd blue"" was an awesome drama was it's first two years.

 after david caruso jumped ship, and was replaced by the likes of jimmy smits, ricky schroeder and mark-paul gosselaar, all mediocre actors to say the least, it never lived up to it's potential. i felt sorry for dennis frantz, for after caruso left, he had to do all the heavy lifting on that show. never has one good actor been surrounded by so many bad actors. anyways this isn't the case with ""rescue me""; all the actors in

this series carry his/her weight.

i also agree with most of the reviewers who write that this is the best show on tv today. i only hope that this deserving series gets,at least, a five year run. the highest praise i can give ""rescue me"" is that it's in the same league as ""six feet under"", which, imo, was the finest tv series ever.

kudos to f/x for having the guts to present controversial and

excellent shows, such as ""over there"" (sadly not renewed),""thief""(sadly not renewed), and of course ""the shield""

2524308,3,B000ENUYGI,"This second season finds the characters spending more time in dark serious places, which I guess means it has more depth, but the bleakness is so consistent that it becomes predictable and loses it's impact after a while. The good fortune fate hands the characters is usually temporary, the bad fortune is usually permanent. I guess the thinking behind it is if something good happens to the characters and it's permanent then that's the end of their pursuit of happiness, so to keep it going the writers need to make sure every good thing that enters the character's lives ends badly. I'd like to see the writers set themselves the challenge of balancing the heavy drama between positive and negative and still find new places to take the show, but considering how comfortable they seem wallowing in tragedy I don't think I'll bother with the third season.",1153612800,3,857,4.836734693877551

For Denis Leary fans, be sure to check out ""The Job,"" a cop-comedy that ABC stupidly canceled after just 2 seasons. Well I suppose he wouldn't have developed Rescue Me so soon afterwards then; blessing in disguise.",1148601600,,449,4.756410256410256
2524320,5,B000ENUYGI,"Alright, here we go:  'Rescue Me' is a great show, and I think the second season is probably even a little better than the first.  It's a matter of taste, it always is, of course, but particularly here as the show has moved in a somewhat different, more dramatic direction.  It's still got plenty of humor, of course, but the season has still got a more violent, dramatic tone and it ends in a black pit of despair for pretty much every character. (Well, alright, that's pretty true of the first season also, but it's even worse this time around.)

Anyway, the appeal of this show is simply that it's got a large cast of very interesting characters, most of whom are fairly likable in spite of their various flaws.  The show centers around Denis Leary's Tommy, of course,  who is extremely reminiscent of Leary's standup persona, being the loud, angry, foul-mouthed jerk.  Tommy Gavin certainly isn't a nice guy, and most people will try and tell you that he's a complex and conflicted and you aren't really particularly supposed to like him, but pshh, whatever. *I* like him.  He's my hero, in fact.  The fact of the matter is, 90% of the time, Tommy is in the right.  Of course, in that other 10% he tends to severely over step the bounds of civilized society, but ehh, who cares.  Beyond him the most important character, at least in my mind, is Ken Shea, lieutenant in the firehouse.  He's probably the most conventionally likable character here, smarter and funnier than anyone else in the show, while simultaneously seeming like more of just a regular guy.  He certainly ain't perfect either, but he's still really the heart of the show, I think.

There are just too many characters to consider them all individually: as we've got Franco, a former total womanizer who found out he has a daughter last season and is trying to turn himself around to some degree; Mike and Sean, two of the younger firefighters who are just particularly stupid and oblivious, and who, frankly, seem to be pretty much the same character; Laura, the one woman in the firehouse, who is, of course, quite an outsider because of this; Chief Reilly, another sorta normal guy character apart from his severe homophobia, which comes into play frequently since he has a gay son.  Then you've got Tommy's family, his kids his father his uncle and his inscrutable semi-ex-wife Janet, and his current girlfriend, the crazy Sheila and on and on.  Suffice to say, this show's got all sorts of stuff going on all the time, far too much to summarize in any meaningful way.  Occasionally individual plot threads won't work as well, and sometimes things peter out with no good explanation or conclusion (such as when Mike plans on killing his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage, and then just doesn't.)  To be honest, the show is basically a prime-time soap opera, albeit far more professional and less cheesy than the real thing, but it's the same basic essence.  If you haven't seen this you may, reasonably, think it's a show about firefighting, but it really isn't.  Most of the characters just kinda happen to be firefighters, the actual, uhh, fighting of fires is a relatively small part of the show.

Though you shouldn't need to be told this, those who are easily offended ought to avoid this show.  Yes, they use lots of swears and slurs and there are a number of butts to be seen.  Frankly, I dunno why this should be surprising to anyone in modern society, but apparently it is, so consider yourself warned.  As a whole, this season actually seems less concerned with being over the top, which is nice.  When something is trying too hard to be outrageous it can come off forced and tiresome, which does happen at a few moments in 'Rescue Me', but not too often, and not as much as in season 1.

Geez, I've gone on and on and I haven't said anything yet, so I guess it's back to the basics to close out this review.  So, in summary: 1-  This show is funny 2- This show is dramatic 3- This show manages to create a certain amount of empathy for just about every character in it, even when they come into conflict. (Except for Janet, who is evil and who I hate.) 4- I like this show.  Watch it.  Also, the theme song is great.",1148256000,22,4199,4.567423230974633
2524321,5,B000ENUYGI,"First caught this series on FX late one Saturday night.  I was so riveted that I had to research the show online, just to see if it was still on TV.  Found out they were coming into their 3rd season on FX starting May 30, 2006.  I figured I had a lot of catching up to do so I went online and bought both seasons 1&2.  Within 1 week I had both seasons watched.  The show is centered around Tommy (Leary) but all characters posses ""must see"" personalities that make each and every scene better than the next.  Tommy & Sheila (and Franco) sex scenes are just a hair shy of R movies and the fire scenes extremely realistic.  It's now approx. 2 weeks until the season opener and I'm already jonesing.  All characters possess some A-hole qualities (Tommy being the most) but all also hold very endearing qualities.  The dialog is extremely witty and storylines fresh.  The language is reminiscent of an HBO or Showtime special yet doesn't cross the line.  Not recommended for kids (obviously) but for anyone older I highly recommend.  This is my first post to Amazon and I've been buying for years.  I have never felt compelled to make a post until now.  I want everyone to know what a great show this is.

2524322,5,B000ENUYGI,"With all the new shows that needed to be reviewed, I really haven't had the time to review a summer show that just ended. The first season of Rescue Me was so entertaining that it won the inaugural STA for Best Cable Show for its first season. That season we were introduced to the gang that included the ultimate alpha-male Tommy, the chief Jerry, the old dude Kenny, the new guy Probie, the ladies man Franco, and the idiot Garrity. The season ended with Franco condition unknown after getting hurt due to Tommy's mistake with Tommy adding anger to his guilt when his wife took off with their kids.

As the second season starts, Tommy asks for a transfer and is ship off to the suburbs where nothing happens, Franco recovered but picked up a painkiller habit, and Tommy's kids were nowhere to be found. But each episode is started with the heart pounding C'mon, C'mon. Other main storylines that were introduced was Kenny now was living at the firehouse after getting a divorce, and the chief having to care for his wife who is in the early stages of Alzheimer's.

Tommy does still drive the show. In an attempt to look like a better father in hopes to win custody of his kids once he finds them, he decides to sober up. This eliminates the ghost he continually would see last season. Grant the side effect of being sober was that he now kept on seeing Jesus and on occasion Mary Magdalene who, at least in the entertainment department, was more entertaining than the many ghosts that haunted the alcoholic Tommy.

There were a few storylines this year that I could have done without, most notably the one with Tommy's half-brother priest. But as a whole the second season was just as entertaining as the first. The most entertaining is whenever Garrety walk on the screen and show some great comic chops, from helping Probie to determine whether he had ball cancer to debating the existence of God with Tommy's youngest daughter, Garrety always brings his A game. And with everything that happened at the end of this season, it looks like season three is shaping up to be as good as the previous two.",1147478400,2,2103,4.587765957446808

2524325,5,B000ENUYGI,"With ""NYPD Blue"" now dearly departed, ""Rescue Me"" moves up as television's best drama.  It is only fitting, since ""Rescue Me"" is the most gritty, realistic and emotionaly unflintching drama since ""Blue.""  For a brief moment it looked as if FX's other great series, ""The Shield,"" was going to inherit said crown - not that ""The Shield"" isn't still as captivating as it ever was, but ""Rescue Me"" is so much deeper on every level.  And that is saying something.  Not that comparing it to ""Blue"" wasn't already.  Denis Leary's Tommy Gavin is the best, most wholely-realized tragic hero television has offered since Dennis Franz's Andy Sipowicz.  I never thought I'd see the day anything would rival ""Blue"" for pure drama, and I certainly never thought I'd see the day any actor could create a character to rival Franz's classic Sipowicz.  But here we are.  The last time I was as deeply moved, angered and shaken by any scripted television it was when Sipowicz lost his son and later his parter Simone (Jimmy Smits) on ""Blue.""  After a many-year lull in having any such experience, there were at least three moments in this season of ""Rescue Me"" that came staggeringly close.  I won't mention them specificaly so as not to ruin them for anyone who has not seen this season, but you'll know them when they hit you like a ton of bricks.  With ""Blue"" gone (and unfortunately subcoming to network restrictions and writer changes in its last few seasons) there aren't any other shows like this out there.  No network - even HBO I dare say - has shown the balls FX has in its original programig.  Rather than being exploitive about it though, FX has used this clout to produce stagering artistic, original, and emotional, as well as daring, programing.  From ""The Shield"" to ""Thief,"" to even its unfairly failed comedies and the flagging-but-still-better-than-most-network-dramas ""Nip/Tuck,""  FX is the go-to for great TV.  Combining the emotional drama of a stressful, life-riskig proffesion, alcoholism, drug abuse, divorce, loss and 9/11, ""Rescue Me"" is powerful, even more so when all these things are what make up the struggle of a single man.  Watching him teeter between redemption and the brink of disaster - subcoming to his addictions and demons - is nothing short of gut-wrentching.  If that reminds you of certain other Dennis' character's plight, well, that's a compliment of the tallest order.",1146009600,6,2397,4.920398009950249
2524326,5,B000ENUYGI,"Rescue me has quickly become one of my favorite shows on tv. Season One was very likable but often times sophmoric and repetitive in it's humor. The gay jokes and references, while funny, never seemed to stop. Stellar character development kept the show from going to far in the wrong direction. Season Two takes character development to a whole new level. Outstanding side stories involving nearly every character cause the viewer to dive in and share in their plight. If you haven't seen this show I strongly recommend picking up both seasons. You won't be disappointed.

Regarding the packaging I can't really give them too many stars here. My five star rating is for the show itself. The packaging is a bit flimsy and cheap and would get 2 stars from me.",1145404800,2,758,4.742424242424242

2524328,5,B000ENUYGI,"The first season of FX's Rescue Me was solid to say the least, but not only does season two improve the series on every possible aspect, it blows it away.  Tortured New York firefighter Tommy Gavin (Denis Leary) finds his life in shambles as his wife and children have left him, his girlfriend on the side is pregnant, and he's been re-assigned to another firehouse that sees no action at all.  Eventually everything works itself out, and Tommy sorts his life back together as he quits drinking, but by the end of the season, Tommy's new found sobriety is tested in a way that you'll never see coming, as tragedy strikes and things are promised to never be the same again.  There are sub-plots galore, including the captain (Jack McGee) dealing with his mentally debilitating wife and reconciling with his gay son, as well as Franco's pain killer problems.  It's surprising that Leary and co. managed to weave a storyline so involving, and the cast once again does electric work, particularly Leary whose scathing style is in fine form.  By the end of the season, you'll be begging for more, guaranteed; as things take a turn for the worst, and things are set to explode for season three.  All in all, like FX's other series the Shield and Nip/Tuck, Rescue Me achieves a surprising greatness in it's sophomore season, and hopefully, season three will be every bit as good.",1144195200,33,1372,4.7196652719665275
2524329,4,B000ENUYGI,I have seen almost every episode of Rescue Me and love every one. I took a chance and bought the first season of rescue me one day without ever seeing a single episode. Since then I have been hooked. The show has good replay value so buy each season as they come out.,1144108800,4,267,4.056603773584905
2524330,5,B000ENUYGI,"This series quite simply has no equal.  Denis Leary truly is an acting force of nature, giving us a character so utterly compelling in Tommy Gavin that it is impossible to take your eyes off him.  Add to that a wonderful supporting cast (especially Jack McGee, Daniel Sunjata and John Scurti, and you are left with one of the finest pieces of television in history.

And on a personal note, to the reviewer below who suggests that the events of 9/11 did New York a favour, you are a vile, cretinous piece of human garbage.  The 343 brave men who died on that day did so for people like you, you ungrateful scumbag.  These men possessed a courage that few of us can ever begin to appreciate.  As for the series emulating real life, well, I'd like to see how you reacted if you lost 343 members of your family.  Crawl back under the rock you came from and die.",1142467200,23,858,4.325
2524331,5,B000ENUYGI,"This is arguably one of the greatest dramas EVER. I have to admit I am surprised myself. If asked I would have never believed leary could have done it, but he did. This movie combines the drama of public service along with one man's struggles.  To use this as a stab at New York Fire Fighters is unacceptable. Sure, there is foul language, sex, and other adult themes in this show, but doesn't that make it even a more correct depiction of life. If your life is like one big ""enzyte"" commercial, or like a scene from the movie ""Pleasentville"" then you probably don't want to watch this. If you live in the real world (ie USA) then you will love this season of this series.",1142380800,13,672,4.333333333333333
2524332,5,B000ENUYGI,"Im so glad this is finally being released. You here actual firefighters talk about this show and how it truly relates to real life and it just proves it so much. I mean you just have to sit down and get to know the characters in a few episodes. I know I first started watching this on a late friday night and I was so bored so I watched 6 episodes back to back on FX and just started to love it. The 2nd season was so spectacular and I cnat wait to start watching the 3rd which should start soon after the 2nd season. Trust me, all it takes is a few episodes to get hooked.",1141603200,12,573,3.905982905982906

8111644,4,B000ENUYGI,"Love this series however the Janet character does not seem like someone real. Nor does she seem like someone Tommy would love. It doesn't help that she is the weak link as far as acting & meshing with the others on the show. Also, Teddy can be annoying & shrill at times. BUT - we have watched & rewatched the show so neither of these flaws are deal-breakers, they're just distractions from an otherwise top notch show. Funny, sexy, dark, interesting & thrilling!!",1505347200,,464,4.602409638554217

8111647,4,B000ENUYGI,"Of the inhabitants who populate the world of Dennis Learys Rescue Me almost every man, woman and child exhibit phenomenally poor judgment, selfish behavior and just general stupidity.  In fact, its so frustrating you just want to strangle the lot of them.  There is a truism that I learned as a squadron commander that 20% of my people would cause 80% of my problems.  In real life that turns out to be pretty accurate but in this universe 100% of the people cause 100% of your problems, its maddening.  The series is billed as a comedy and while there are many humorous moments much of what happens isn't all that funny.

  This season we get female firefighter Laura Miles (Diane Farr) joining the house and naturally the guys resent her presence although she's ""hot"".  Of course, she eventually engages in a relationship with one of the crew which predictably ends badly. Tommy Gavin (Leary) hits rock bottom with his drinking and winds up going to AA actually sticking with it; coupled with filching wife Janets (Andrea Roth) anti-depressants is happy for once.  This change of demeanor drives him to end his relationship with his deceased cousins wife, Sheila (Callie Thorne) who then gets into an abusive lesbian relationship.  Thornes character is without doubt one of the neediest, co-dependent individuals youll ever see and as such the most annoying.  Chief Reilly (Jack McGee) is challenged when his wifes Alzheimers disease becomes unmanageable but it leads to something of a reconciliation with his gay son.  Tommys father (Charles Durning) winds up getting married to a Korean multi-millionaire and moving into her Park Avenue penthouse.  Lou (John Scurti) meets a beautiful escort and falls hard for her but it turns out shes a con artist and takes him for his life savings.  Towards the end of the season we meet the estranged Gavin sister Maggie played by Tatum ONeal whos a real piece of work.  Things conclude on a grim note with a double tragedy.

  Although actual fire fighting isn't the real focus of the show they do occasionally perform the job and those scenes are gripping.  You get a sense of the danger these folks take on every day and the perils they face; it really makes you appreciate what they give back to our society.

  The show is not family friendly (it's an FX production after all) due to language and somewhat graphic depictions of sexual activity.  Also the homophobic elements may not appeal to some but its a recurring and frequent part of the show and source of many jokes.  Bonus features include Diane Farr interviewing real FDNY firemen and an look behind the scenes of the season thats interesting.",1484697600,,2649,4.835555555555556
