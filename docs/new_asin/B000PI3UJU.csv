8191743,5,B000PI3UJU,"I am a Catherine Cookson fan and THE ROUND TOWER is one of my favorites.  It is a story of a young girl being raised by parents who are snobs, and  social climbing is their main ambition in life. They are uncaring and only interested that their chilren don't rock the boat.  A business partner of the family, who is trapped in a loveless marriage is fond of the younger daughter and they make love which results in a pregnancy.  Rather than follow her parents plan of going away, bearing the child and putting it up for adoption,the daughter leaves and is taken up by a young acquaintance who offers to marry her.

The story goes on from there. Emila Fox plays the young daughter and the male lead is Denis Lawson who marries her. They are both excellent and backed up by a superior group of actors.  I won't give the story away but I enjoyed it and would not hesitate to reccommend it. A touching love story. Buy it - you won't be sorry.",1344470400,2,938,4.301136363636363
