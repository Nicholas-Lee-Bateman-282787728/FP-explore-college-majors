4111912,1,B003DKO74O,"This movie was a barely watchable parody of film noir; at least I can only hope it was supposed to be a parody. Everything about it reeked of unoriginal sterotypes, from the hard-boiled private eye narrating in the background, to the femme fatale, to the painfully transparent bad guy. The action is comparable to Shoot'em Up, in that it's non-stop and utterly unbelievable, but unlike that movie which was clearly done with a wink and a nod, this mess fails to make it fun. The dialog is like reading 'bad film noir for dummies' and the plot could be cut from the back of a cereal box. It also waffles as a period piece, with Thomas Jane and Ving Rhames decked out in 1930's clothes and Malone driving a vintage tank of a car, all the while taking place in an utterly modern Los Angeles. This movie doesnt work on any level; as a parody it fails to be campy enough to be fun, and as a real film noir it's a complete trainwreck. I'm disappointed in both Thomas Jane and Ving Rhames, two otherwise talented actors who clearly just took this film for a paycheck.",1263254400,3,1060,4.413265306122449
4111913,5,B003DKO74O,"""Malone"" is a super noir-styled detective film with a high BPM rating (Bullets per Minute). Ultra-stylistically filmed, it tells the story of P.I. Malone (Thomas Jane from Hung) who has been hired by a mysterious woman to secure a braiefcase, the contents of which he doesn't know). The opening scene is a trap and the action lifts off from there and never stops...literally never stops. Ving Rhames is perfect as an ultra bad man and for those who remember the bad prison guard from The Green Mile (Percy), Doug Hutchison once again seems to be in love with fire in his role as 'Matchstick', a dude in love with kerosene and matches. Thomas Jane plays one tough dick and killing him is difficult to say the least. Even a bullet to the chest is received and discarded. The bomshell client is more trouble than she's worth indeed. Give 'em Hell is a great 'watch' for action fans as well as fans of the genre.",1261612800,17,908,4.5426829268292686
4111914,3,B003DKO74O,"This strikes me as more of a cult hit than something that will be widely accepted. A semi-modern noire/graphic novel-esque movie, it definitely is in a category of its own. Is it in the past, present, alternate present, or alternate future? Who knows, but it was still pretty entertaining. I'd suggest renting it from Blockbuster or Netflix before you purchase. I don't regret my decision, but tastes differ from person to person. I enjoyed this movie, but know exactly what you're getting before you get it. You'll either love it or hate it, there's very little room for middle ground.",1279065600,,586,4.87
4111915,4,B003DKO74O,"Snappy title, sounds like a film from the 70s.  Give Em Hell Malone is one of those high octane action flicks that gives us just enough plot to move us from action sequence to action sequence.  Most of it is gunfights and brawls as Malone, accompanied by a hot chick(of course) demolishes bad guys in search of fellow tough guy Ving Rhames, and the top crime boss.  Like I said, not much plot.  It's not about plot though, it's about action, and very comic bookish action at that.  It's done with that highly stylized computer slow-mo bullet crap and whatnot, as to be expected.  Sometimes the movie is like watching somebody play a shoot em up video game, like in the opening scene.  The movie's obviously got it's tongue in it's cheek, and it shows as in a running joke that has Malone visiting his mother in a rest home every time he's shot so she can remove the bullet and patch him up.  Of course there's a smoking hot, deadly Japanese samurai chick too.  Thomas Jayne is always good for the macho action tough guy, more so than a lot of guys who pass themselves off as action stars these days.  Not a role that requires much in the acting department, but he's definitely got the look, as Roxette would say.  The whole thing has a noir type vibe with Jayne and Rhames decked out in snazzy old 30s attire and Jayne narrating like an old hard boiled detective.
The film was directed by Russell Mulcahy, who has dazzled us with flicks like  Highlander, the giant wild boar on the loose epic, Razorback and Scorpion King 2.  And lets not forget the masterpiece Highlander 2: The Quickening.
Though Give Em Hell Malone tends to use a lot of the cheapo modern day action film tricks and gags that make me hate today's action films so much, and also the fact that there isn't one original bone in it's body(it's so shameless in it's ripping off of Sin City and Kill Bill), I was still quite entertained by it.  Very odd.  For mindless action, it's about as mindless as it gets, yet it still seems to be a cut above many others.",1276387200,3,2025,4.405913978494624
4111916,1,B003DKO74O,"How can DIRTY HARRY and SIN CITY be so good ..... and MALONE so bad ?
Ouch this was bad !

4111917,4,B003DKO74O,"It was like watching a train wreck, or a B western,  Hoping it would get better, but ...  What can you say, I like train wrecks.  Thomas Jane has been in better movies than this",1275004800,,177,4.0
4111918,4,B003DKO74O,"There's some terrific scenes in this film. The man behind ""Highlander"" directed it, and the visuals are great. Thomas Jane is good as the lead, a hard boiled legendary gunfighter. A lot of the action is slick and brutal, and quite a lot of the film is funny.

The violence flows thick and fast, and there's a lot to like here.

4111920,3,B003DKO74O,"Don't misunderstand my title, aside from the last 30 seconds, this film is fairly self-contained.  I just thought it really dumb to end it as if there will be more to the story, knowing that such likelihood isn't very high, especially for this type of production; it's hardly a major franchise.  If there is a sequel, I fear it'll be recast to account for an even lower budget and might not even be worth watching, as this film itself has some serious storytelling flaws.  If not for the cast, I probably wouldn't have given it a second thought.  But it's got some familiar faces; some of whom I'm somewhat of a fan.

The action and script can be a lot of fun.  The visual style might have been too, if a little more went into it.  As is it looks like they were shooting for the kind of stark visuals of Sin City, but didn't have the budget or vision, leaving the look somewhere in between daring and mundane.  I enjoyed the films dialogue, but the actual storytelling isn't very clear, despite it being a fairly meat and potatoes noir.  The editing is a bit jumpy as well.

I sincerely hope the film does do well enough on disc to at least tempt Jane back for a hopefully bigger budget sequel.  But without a sequel already in motion, the ending should have been left on the cutting room floor.  It was unnecessary and without a follow-up, cheapens the film.",1267228800,6,1359,4.413654618473895
4111921,5,B003DKO74O,"Big Low-Budgie has everything and enough 30-40s  and recent lifts from all that is Neo-Noir. From Alan Ladd with his cat, to his Mom,  Dames and an Asian Bad Girl; there is a full spectrum of devices that work with the design, story and lack of abandon. Great cast, pre-odd production values, iconic director and an incredible sense of fun.
BD is great with pic and sound. Sets are well designed. Trash for most.",1265846400,3,412,4.554054054054054
4111922,3,B003DKO74O,"While I've come to enjoy Thomas Jane the more and more I see of him lately, it appeared upon first glance that Give 'Em Hell Malone may not have been one of his better decisions.  Happily though, the film is a stylish, semi-enjoyable piece of pulp-noir that Jane appears to be quite at home in being in.  Jane stars as Malone, a tough PI who has been double crossed and is now up against a crew of gangsters, including an old nemesis (Ving Rhames), a pyromaniac (Doug Hutchison, doing his best Heath Ledger Joker impersonation), and their boss (Gregory Harrison); all the while with a mysterious damsel (Elsa Pataky) in tow.  Unapologetic in its blood-letting and violence, Give 'Em Hell Malone is certainly fun enough to enjoy and features style to spare from Highlander and Resident Evil: Extinction director Russell Mulcahy.  What detracts from the film however is some just plain horrible editing and a screenplay loaded with plot holes.  Still though, for what it's worth, Give 'Em Hell Malone is an enjoyable enough experience, and you could do much worse than what you find here.",1264464000,9,1086,4.817204301075269
4111923,2,B003DKO74O,"Being as this is one of the worst BDs I have ever watched (of this genre), I will try to keep this as short as possible so you can move on.

The story follows a Marv-like (Sin City) tough guy played by Thomas Jane, who shoots and fights his way through the story to find the bad guy (felt like the 80s Punisher walked onto a Spokane set of Shoot Em Up). Along the way we get some severe overacting from Doug Hutchison (critics of the film have pegged his role as being too much like Ledger's Joker performance - rang true), a standard Ving Rhames bad-guy-in-it-for-love role, and Elsa Pataky graces the screen with her natural beauty and sultry accent as the noir eye candy. Regarding the aspect of casting and for what the film tries to be, they succeeded in getting some standard acting out of the ensemble they have here, but the production destroys it.

Technically, the film and the BD are a mess. The editing was never finished for the film, so there are scenes of cameramen in mirrors, a camera chase vehicle (clearly a white SUV) left in the shot when Jane's character exits his vehicle after the spin-out sequence, reused footage of takes from the same scene, exhaust coming out of the car when it is not running, etc. The BD is DVD quality, with no line definition, obvious grain, random artifact, characters' faces too dark to see, and the list goes on. The strength would have to be the DTS - it gets used extensively and has several surround reference points. Go figure.

The supplements are some of the worst produced extras I have ever seen. They consist of three interviews (Jane, Pataky and Hutchison) lasting 19 minutes. But once again they did not edit them. For example, in Jane's interview one of the crew kept using an alarmed device in the background, so they would wait it out and Tom would get irritated (play with his cigar ash usually) and ask if they could start over - three different times. So the majority of his interview is him starting over (seriously 4 minutes of his interview is nothing...?). Hutchison held his own but Pataky's microphone was rubbing her coat so abrasively, that her interview is garbled throughout.

You might get some decent noir fix out of this film, as I understand the over-the-top thing suits this style of filmmaking (that Buick is awesome, as is that rare kind of revolver he uses), but the production and BD are way below average. Tough call overall, region coded A/B/C with English SDH and Spanish subs only - and not 1080p as stated on the box.",1264118400,4,2510,4.558758314855876
8394815,3,B003DKO74O,"Lots of shooting, blood and gore, cool costumes and sets, a cool rare semi automatic revolver carried by the star, and one very cool car, most of the acting was pretty good and I enjoyed the overall feel and mood, but for me something was just lacking almost to the point of becoming boring. The story just seemed to drag on, and I actually began to look forward to the movie finally being over. Although I did not expect what happened at the end, it did not really surprise me either. I was hoping for more, and wish I could have rated it higher.",1421712000,,547,4.269230769230769
8394816,2,B003DKO74O,"The best part of ""Give 'em Hell Malone"" is the opening ten minutes' violent gun action followed by nice car chase, in which a tough private detective Malone (Thomas Jane) guns down lots of gangsters in his attempt to get a briefcase he is hired to retrieve. Malone thinks he has been framed by someone, so when he later encounters a mysterious woman Evelyn (Elsa Pataky), Malone naturally gets suspicious about her intentions, even though he finds himself attracted to her.

This is a promising opening with great stunts. And this is the only part I find interesting about ""Give 'em Hell Malone."" I know the noir-ish film is not all about action, and Russell Mulcahy (""Highlander"" ""Resident Evil: Extinction"") attempts to infuse offbeat humor into scenes that are often bloody and violent. Sadly he seems to lack the flair and creativity of the ""Pulp Fiction"" director.

About thirty minutes in, the film gets tedious and incoherent, with ""eccentric"" characters, none of whom is really fleshed out. Ving Rhames (typecast), scenery-chewing Doug Hutchison and over-the-top Chris Yen (Hong Kong action star Donnie's sister) play assassins hired to track down Malone and the briefcase, but their roles are all uninteresting caricatures.

With paper-thin characters and uninspired direction, ""Give 'em Hell Malone"" is forgettable action, though it has few good moments (lollipop-eating Chris Yen is not bad).",1358035200,,1403,5.226666666666667

If fact he imitated the Joker so much, it was a bit annoying. Ving Rhames is a bad guy attempting to deal with emotional issues. The plot is confused and immaterial to the movie.

8394821,4,B003DKO74O,"Anyone who spent their youth in front of the big blue tube knows the name Mike Hammer the detective played by Darren Mac Gavin. Mike Hammer and Malone, both spent most of their time in the shadows of a low budget but high action movie. The narriation that Malone offers, adds continuity to the scenes and keeps the viewers interested as they go from scene to scene, unlike the chopped off scenes and the constant switching of cameras in most of today's movies. There probably wasn't much left on the cutting room floor and it appears all scenes were completed as directed and produced.

The movie does stray from reality, How many bullets does it take to put a man down?, but the courage and strength that Malone gathers from the quart of liquor (always in his hand) should be sold at the concession stand in local movie houses when viewing some of the recent drivel that I saw play there.

A sequel? That would be nice, but where would you go with the story line that we were left with....  . Maybe someone will pick up on the old Mike Hammer series and run with it for a sequel using this tried and true theory.",1295136000,,1113,4.393203883495145
