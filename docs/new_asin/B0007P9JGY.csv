The mostly black DVD box, shown in this listing, may also be the uncut version, but the DVD is covering up part of the box picture, where the words: 'As seen on Pay-Per-View, Uncut Version', are listed on mine. (I also think that, the episode #2 DVD, has a mostly purple cover, listed as just, 'Strip Poker Invitational' on this website). Very confusing, I know.

All of Carmen Electra's silly sayings, such as, ""What a great pair"", are badly edited in, so it's easy to tell she's not on the set, while this real (with some minor strip poker rules added) , 55 minute, 2004 Texas Hold'em game is being played. The extra six minute, 'behind the scenes' footage at the end of the game, confirms that Carmen is shooting her scenes separately. Carmen is never nude, and the 6 girls are only topless.

The 2 announcers (Jason Pardo and Sybil Azur), mostly provide tongue-in-cheek commentary, with some very basic poker strategy thrown in.

Although this is a winner-take-all game, for a $50,000 first prize, with frequent chip counts given, and nice enough card graphics, it's rather dull, because only one of the girls (Erica Allen-NOT her real last name) can play poker. The others just make bad calls, folds, and check too often.

However, the six topless players (Felicia Tang, Tiffany Lang, Tracy Dali,  Aimee Sweet, Heather Carolin, Erica Allen), are certainly hot enough (except for 'Playboy Playmate', Heather Carolin), but the only real reason to buy this DVD, is to see Erica Allen (NOT her real last name) topless. She's actually a real professional poker and Blackjack player, as well as a former junior Olympic volleyball player, with the same first name.

Although Erica's real identity (Erica Schoenberg), has yet to be confirmed by her, if you've watched enough poker or Blackjack on tv, you'll probably recognize her right away, and be glad you bought this DVD. I'm All-in.",1179878400,3,1987,4.812316715542522
