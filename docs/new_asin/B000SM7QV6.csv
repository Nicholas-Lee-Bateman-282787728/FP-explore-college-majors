8205848,1,B000SM7QV6,"I really looked forward to playing this DVD but felt upon playing, disapointed.  Yes it is a documentary and very informative but what was really missing, the music.  For someone new to this group trying to learn more, they will have no idea of the sound they produce.  This DVD was 45min of talking with no performances.  You just get some background music, bits here and there.  If I weanted information I could have looked it up on the computer.  I was looking for some video play of some of their songs.  That would have made the documentary complete.  Sorry, thumbs down.",1365552000,,576,4.578431372549019
8205849,1,B000SM7QV6,"The DVD, I thought, would cover an in depth look at the history of the Brothers Four.  Unfortunately, it only interviewed Bob Flick and only highlighted some basic topics of the Brothers Four.  No other members were interviewed.  It would have been nice to see all the original members of the Brothers Four.  For the most part, the DVD was pretty much dry of anything interesting.  I also noticed that it copied many of the  video segments that were on the Kingston Trio DVD ""50 Years of Havin' Fun.""  (Probably to be used as a filler.) The Trio DVD was far more informative than the Brothers Four DVD.  As a fan of the sixties folk groups I wanted to see more Brothers Four on this DVD, much more....",1298937600,3,701,4.421875
8205850,1,B000SM7QV6,"I really wanted to like this and was excited when I saw it.  But it is a disappointing re-hash of things already known.  Bob Flick, the spokesman, tells the same stories that were available on the older album covers or on the the Brothers Four website.  What I was craving to know is what happened to the other three brothers?  What are Mike Kirkland, John Paine, Dick Foley doing now?  When/why did they leave the group?
The original members are on the cover of the dvd and this is the reason I purchased it.  I grew up listening to this wonderful folk group.  Their songs and voices brought smiles to our faces.  The new members may be good, but they are NOT my Brothers Four and I felt cheated.
Sigh.  I guess you can't go home again.",1258070400,7,737,4.321167883211679
