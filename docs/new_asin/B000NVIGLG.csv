2787121,4,B000NVIGLG,"""Isolation"" has one of the more unusual hooks for a horror film you are ever likely to see.  Dan (John Lynch) is running a remote (one might even say isolated) farm out in the Irish countryside, and he is worried about one of his cows that is about to give birth.  So he calls up the town veterinarian, Orla (Essie Davis), who checks on the fetus by putting her arm, up to the elbow, into the cow.  Then she gets bit, are first clear sign that something is not right on Dan's farm.  It turns out that in an effort to make ends meet Dan has allowed his cattle to be part of a research project that wants to increase fertility and beef production as well.  Just as it starts to look like the project is going to produce results, the cows gives birth to an unusual calf.  For starters, the calf is born pregnant, and if you are suddenly reminded of the Tribbles from ""Star Trek,"" you will not be alone, but you will be on the wrong track.

The risk is not just mutant monsters, but the threat of contagion, which at least resonates with memories of the threat of Mad Cow disease.  Joinging the farmer and the vet are a geneticist, John (Marcel Iures) who gets to provide necessary explanations and explosition (plus being the most obvious victim for the beasties), and a young couple, Mary (Ruth Negga) and Jamie (Sean Harris), who are avoiding their parents by hiding out on Dan's farm.  Now squatting will be the least of their problems since fooling around with Mother Nature always has disastrous results in horror movies.

The upside of this film is that director Billy O'Brien knows how to film a horror movie and to take advantage of the dark and dirty farm setting.  The opening sequences does a nice job of setting the mood, which matters because this is a movie about killer cows.  The downside of this film is that in the last half it is basically ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>"" with cows, not that there is anything wrong with that (Although my mind immediately went to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Howard-The-Duck/dp/0785108319/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Howard The Duck</a>&nbsp;story, ""Hellcow,"" that appeared in ""Giant-Size Man-Thing"" #5, which involved a bovine vampire, complete with the cape).  But as the movie goes along and gets less original and more derivative, it becomes less effective.  I ended up rounding up on this DVD because it includes an earlier short work by O'Brien, ""The Tale of the Rat That Wrote.""  Do not attempt to connect the dots begween this short and the featured film, just enjoy this DVD bonus.",1184371200,8,2686,5.031602708803612
2787122,4,B000NVIGLG,"As a previous reviewer has mentioned, there have been some pretty good offerings in the horror genre from Britain [The Descent]and yes, Ireland recently and Isolation is definitely worth a watch. The setting is a rural farm somewhere in Ireland I presume, and the cast of characters [human that is] is made up of Farmer Dan, a female vet, a scientist, and a young couple, Jamie and Mary [who are on the run from Mary's disapproving brothers]. The premise: the farm is the setting for a biogenetics experiment, and a cow births a genetically mutated calf...the rest of the story deals with the repercussions of this event. Though the plot seems rather simple, the story moves at a steady but suspenseful pace and the stalking of the prey [the humans & other cows on the farm] by the predator makes for compelling and scary viewing. Though there is some allusions to other movies like Alien, The Fly etc...I still found it to be quite an enjoyable and intelligent sci-fi horror flick that is worth a watch. The acting was credible and the effects sufficient in evoking a menacing atmosphere.",1182902400,20,1089,4.767195767195767
2787123,4,B000NVIGLG,"The United Kingdom is evidently doing something right when it comes to horror.  Over the past few years the UK has produced some terrific scare fests including the recent WILDERNESS and the international hit THE DESCENT; Isolation proves to be no exception.  A taut well crafted horror thriller, the story is small, intriguing, and taughtly paced, the atmosphere rich, and palpable.  Genetic mutation movies aren't really my thing; I'm not rabid about Sci-Fi or ""mad scientist playing with nature"" themes.  However, Isolation balances these elements with an interesting blend of horror and human nature, is well filmed, and does quite a bit out of very little. The film isn't broad, doesn't flesh out it's characters a great deal nor bother to explain many things.  Nonetheless, its riveting and manages to truly invoke a feeling of dread and yes, isolation.",1178841600,15,858,5.143884892086331

2787137,1,B000NVIGLG,"Occasionally in the course of writing about movies you find a rare gem of a film that no one has ever heard of. This is not one of those movies. Instead this is one of those movies that angers you when the final credits finally appear. It angers you because you know the people involved are capable of so much more at least in the actors on the film. Theyre better actors than what is on display. ISOLATION is just that sort of movie.

Creighton and Lydia Masterson (Luke Mable and Tricia Helfer) are a couple with problems. Creighton had cheated on Lydia but came clean and is not trying to salvage his marriage. Lydia is willing to give him that chance. He presents her with a trip to the Bahamas and the home of a wealthy client. Things go awry when they discover the neighbors are beginning a restoration project and creating quite a racket. His friend comes to the rescue sending his daughter to escort them to an alternative, a small island nearby he has a retreat at.

It seems the perfect place and that first day they meet neighbors they weren't aware of, William and Mary (Stephen Lang and Claudia Church). Invited to dinner the couples seem to hit it off, even after learning that William and Mary are sort of on the run. Years before they were convicted of selling grass and ran away to their island retreat, bothering no one and enjoying life on the island. After a little too much to smoke and drink, Creighton and Lydia head home to discover their house has been broken into and all of their luggage, food, passports and everything else stolen.

The next day they go looking for a phone to call the mainland and come across Max (Dominic Purcell) who offers to give them a hand. He takes them to his place where they meet Nina (Marie Avgeropoulos), his companion. When the phone seems out and they cant get a signal, Max takes Creighton out in his boat in the hopes of reaching one. Before long the question of who can be trusted and who is not what they seem come into play and a life and death battle is the end result.

This movie crawls along at such a tedious pace that even if you watched it in fast forward you would find it difficult to stay awake. The writing is terrible, the pacing painful to suffer through, the camerawork passable and the locations which should look like Heaven on earth look like the film was shot in the off season. It is filled with far too many expository scenes, travelogue styled sequences that encourage no one to want to travel to the Bahamas and do little more than fill out the 86 minutes of screen time that feels so much longer.

Helfer whose star was on the rise with her appearances in both the reboot of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and BURN NOTICE has fallen into more roles like this for some reason. Shes a capable actress and deserves better. Purcell has come from the successful series PRISONBREAK into far too many movies like this before returning to a successful TV series in DCS LEGENDS OF TOMORROW. Again, hes a much better actor than the roles hes being presented with. Id suggest new management for both of these actors. Lang is another in a line of actors on display here that can be amazing to watch and yet Hollywood never seems to know what to do with him. His career has seen highs like TOMBSTONE and AVATAR but then gone to lows as well. Last year he starred in the highly underappreciated DONT BREATHE. Again, get a better agent because you deserve more than this.

I cant think of anyone who would enjoy this film. Its not even a good bad movie. It just sits there and does nothing, offers nothing and the best I can see it accomplishing is being a good doorstop but only if nothing else is available. As I said, for me it left me angry because of the talent that was wasted in what could have been at least a decent movie. Instead it makes Ed Wood look like a talented director.",1497139200,,3850,4.40787623066104

2787140,4,B000NVIGLG,"Experimentation on an isolated farm lead to grisly results. Harsh lesson: Never try to manipulate natural growth patterns and others in animals, plants, or humans. Unlike most US horror features of the 21st century, in ISOLATION it is not predetermined who will be the last one standing--with annoying close-ups of one woman, girl, boy, or man. Anybody could go and anybody could stay. John Lynch, Ruth Negga, or Essie Davis, to name some. The last surviving character just happened to be...watch for yourselves. No spoilers. On a side note, the eccentric elderly scientist is not necessary (to me at least) but he does show that monstrous ambition equals monstrous results though. And story remains paramount, no distractions involving the soap opera sentiment that makes many horror films of today stink. UK indie-stream did alright with this one, all in all.

Here's a review I wrote for Horror-unrated.com a few years ago, I hope It'll convince some of you to give this little gem a chance.

Here we go...

Every once in a while, I like to cruise the web and seek out strange and scarcely known genre films. Of course, the outcome of this ham-handed approach, more often than not, results in a vast plethora of so-so viewing experiences, which are neither terribly appealing nor particularly noteworthy in hindsight.

But periodically, albeit much too seldom, a film turns up that manages to completely knock my socks off. Isolation is such a film. A slow burning gem of a creature feature, that's brimming with the sort of dread and despair, fans of the seminal Alien (Ridley Scott, 1979) and The Thing (John Carpenter, 1981) should lap up like buttermilk.

On a lonely desolated spot in rural Ireland, the lonely broken down farmer Dan (John Lynch) is desperately trying to keep his dilapidated estate up and running despite severe financial strains. As a way of means, he has agreed to rent out his livestock to a scientist named John (Marcel Iures) from the Bovine Genetics Technology, for him to experiment on as he's currently researching genetic modifications of cattle to increase their fertility.
All the while Jamie (Sean Harris) and Mary (Ruth Negga), a young couple on the lam arrives at the barrier of the farmhouse hoping to lay low for a while and distance themselves from Mary's rancorous family. But peace is the last thing they'll encounter, since everyone involved in the biological debacle are about to have their view on basic existential matters, violently shattered, as something has indeed gone wrong with the experiments pertaining to the farm animals.
During the night, when one of the cows are calving, Dan discovers that there is a problem as the calf appears to be stuck, with only the hooves showing from its mother's vagina, Dan asks the young couple, Jamie and Mary who are staying in a trailer in front of his farm's entrance, to help him in the delivery. When the offspring is born, it viciously bites Dan, causing him to lose parts of his fingers. When veterinarian and John's assistant Orla (Essie Davis) arrives at the scene and realizes that the calf embodies an unforeseen genetic anomaly, she puts it down in order to investigate the phenomenon further, but during the autopsy of the animal, she discovers, much to her horror, that the young calf is pregnant, carrying a bunch of small hideously mutated offspring but before she can manage to destroy the freak hybrids, one of them escapes only to live on in the murky waters of the somewhat flooded vicinity of the farmhouse, feasting on the herd of cows and growing ever larger with each attack.
When the scientist, John, arrives at the farm, he soon discovers that there is a serious risk that the mutation can cross over and infected human beings, and he therefore decides to quarantine the spot. As the rain keeps pouring down from the murky black skies, the escalating events of peril and bloodshed brings about a desperate fight for survival among the group, as chances of an escape slips ever further away.

If you check out director Billy O'Brien's IMDb page, you'll see that he's hardly made any ripples in the pond that is the moviemaking industry, both prior to and after completing Isolation, is somewhat of a shame, given the brilliance of that particular stand alone feature.
This is a film where everything and I do mean everything, works. From the beautiful widescreen visuals by cinematographer Robbie Ryan to the rundown rural location, the acting talents of the cast members and last but certainly not least, the minimalist but savagely effective string based score courtesy of composer Adrian Johnston.
Props must also go to the basic design and practical effects of the creature, which comes off as a mixture of wildly disproportional bone spurs held together by sporadically placed pieces of daggling flesh. It equals a true monstrosity and is a highly original concept of terror.
But ultimately it is the effectiveness of the overall story, about the dangers of tampering with Mother Nature combined with the aforementioned elements that renders this picture so ripe for potential re-plays. The premise might not be of great originality seeing as everyone from Victor Frankenstein to Herbert West and a thousand in between have already been there and done that, in regards to tampering with the established in the name of science.
But that simple fact shouldn't damper the excitement of bearing witness to yet another piece of extremely well constructed genre filmmaking. Just don't go in expecting a franticly paced storyline or crackling one-liners, as Isolation instead offers up a much more cerebral experience driven by the characters and an atmosphere with an all impending sense of dread and despair.
So, should you get the craving for a really extraordinary creature feature, yet have already tested the seminal works of Mr. Scott and Carpenter then there's really no reason you should deprive yourself a screening of this lesser known, but still magnificent beast of a film.

Reviewed here is the region 2 UK DVD released by Lionsgate Home Entertainment. The main feature is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and the quality of the image is superb without any presence of pixilation, ghosting or frame enhancement.
The soundtrack is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and is every bit as good as the image quality.
As for the extras you get an 18 minute featurette entitled ""Interviews and insights from the cast and crew"", which is a nice addition presenting a lot of behind-the-scenes material, but the talking are a wee bit clich.
Furthermore there's a 10 minute featurette about the production design and effects which is also worth a look. Lastly you get a trailer for the film.

Hope you enjoyed this review and the film if you choose to give it a watch.",1435449600,2,6103,4.924198250728863

2787158,4,B000NVIGLG,"Its been a while since I've seen a good monster flick. I thought good monster movies ended with the 80's. However, this truly is a macabre, and horrific treat of a monster movie. That has, unlike most recent horror films, a meaning that goes beyond screaming and gore. It reminds us that no matter what choices we make in life there will be consenquences that will follow of equal or greater magnitude.",1385424000,,402,4.597222222222222
2787159,4,B000NVIGLG,"A nice horror movie. The performances were restrained, an while nobody acting is going to win an academy award for their performances, that acting was still professional and a cut above some of the usual performances in horror movies. This feature would have benefitted from additional story and character development.  Why were Jamie and Mary hiding out besides the threat of violence by her brothers for their relationship? Why was Dan on the verge of losing his farm?  His relationship with Ora could have been better developed. The gore was kept to a minum, but the suspense could have been ratched up.  All in all, a nice surprise and better most slasher flicks and teeny bopper horror movies.",1381622400,2,698,4.898305084745763
2787160,4,B000NVIGLG,"I really admire a film like Isolation- it maintains a creepy pace and a dark, dreary setting while very slowly building into a pretty good storyline.  Even if the story was terrible (and it's not, but I admit it's nothing special either) the atmosphere would have been respectable enough to recommend this movie.  Everything's so quiet and eerie, and you know exactly what's going on because it's a simple plot to follow... *this* is how you accomplish horror, folks!

Anyway it's about this mother cow that gives birth to a baby calf in a barn somewhere on these Irish farmlands (completely tucked away from society no less, making for additional fear) and we find out that a genetic experiment has gone horribly wrong when testing is done on the calf and certain mysterious things are discovered that don't make a lick of sense.  There's some realism as well concerning how the farmers are supposed deliver the babies when they get stuck in the womb which is a nice touch.

Basically the setting makes this entire movie creepier because you wonder how the people will escape when things go from bad to worse.  The answer?  Well, tune in to find out!  Also, expect some pretty graphic headshot deaths occur.  This movie has LOTS of blood too.  I never did understand the scene with the tractor riding through... black soil?  Sewer?  What WAS that?  It was a good 5-6 feet high, and a large portion of it too.

The Irish accents are sort of strong but for the most part easily understandable, and even though it's basically another uncontrollable experimental genetics horror flick that we've seen several times in other films, it's a pretty good one anyway.  Zombie lovers would probably feel satisfied with it.",1353801600,,1712,4.795221843003413

The film ""Black Sheep"" gets that sheep can be pretty much anything but scary - so it made them funny. So... come on, scary cows?! Not sure of the story behind this film but I'm guessing it has ended up being less of a hit and more of a showcase of the talents of the actors, director of photography and even the director. They really did pull off a consistently ominous, tense, thriller of a film with a completely laughable monster concept.",1339545600,2,534,4.572916666666667
2787163,3,B000NVIGLG,"Disclaimer: I watched this film as a streaming rental, and as such cannot comment on the audio or visual qualities of this individual disc.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

Poor Irish Farmer + Careless Geneticist + Innocent runaways + A Genetically Modified Cow which is mad as hell and isn't going to take it anymore = ISOLATION.  Have I seen this before?  I don't know, but it sure seems like I could have written the script, since I knew beforehand everything that was coming.  I can't believe that anyone who watches much horror won't feel the same - even the order in which the victims are knocked off seems pre-ordained by the stereotypical character slots that they fill.  This isn't HAMLET, sure, I know, but if ever I've seen a paint-by-number horror film, this is certainly one.

It isn't all bad - it's that scene by scene, and plot point by plot point, it is just so flipping average that it barely qualifies as entertainment.  I actually like the five principle actors here - they lend a sort of brooding quality to the film that almost makes up for the fact that we're dealing with some kind of Raptor/Cow.  And I'll give a hearty thumbs up to the cinematographer (Robbie Ryan), as well as whoever worked on scouting the location - the farm on which ISOLATION takes place looks perfect for SOME kind of horror film.  Just not this one.

In the end, ISOLATION does what it does competently - it delivers the same old, same old quite well.  It's like the greatest oatmeal you ever had - but it's still oatmeal.",1338681600,,1561,4.555555555555555

I decided to watch this movie based on other Amazon Members reviews and I can say that I was impressed. It does a fantastic job of building a plot, that although isn't a new concept, it is one that is feasible. The story makes sense and the suspense is built up gradually until a final climax that I found to be a fitting end.

Overall, the acting is good and the cinematography contributes to the overall feeling of dread and impending doom of the movie.

It was a bit irritating to me that none of these people seemed to have heard of disinfectant as there was only a couple of scenes where it makes an appearance. And believe me, they should have gone through a few gallons of the stuff, not to mention the fact that nobody seems to mind walking around with bodily fluids soaking into their wounds and clothes. And why did they leave bodies lying around when they should have been KILLING IT WITH FIRE??? It takes about 45 minutes into the movie before they finally light up one body.

2787172,3,B000NVIGLG,"Europeans are even more afraid of genetically modified food than we Americans, and this movie plays into that fear. Isolation is about a experimental agricultural station that is trying to breed more fertile cows. The result is a mutant, carnivorous, fetal calf that goes hunting amongst five people who have the bad luck to be on the farm.

There are a number of mistakes a horror movie can make, mistakes that cause us to disconnect from the reality it is trying to create. Mistakes that bore us. Isolation commits a lot of them.

Mostly,  there's the fact that we always know more than the characters do. When a difficult calving produces a mutant calf with razor-sharp teeth, one that is already pregnant with hideous mutant calves, we know that one of those miscarried mutants is going to live and go on a rampage. When a cow is found with lacerations across its legs and hindquarters, and something sharp catches the foot of one of the characters, we know where the mutant it. But it will take the characters another 20 minutes to sort this out. And so it goes, the audience always being 20 minutes ahead of the characters throughout the movie. We know who will die and how and when, who will survive (but not really, because we know that, too).

We also need to feel the horror of the characters. Horror films are visceral. Oozy mutant cow babies just aren't enough. No one in this movie seems that disturbed by what they have found, except for a lot of LOUD TALKING, as if shouting counts as acting.

The final result is a movie that never earns our buy-in, a weak attempt at playing on an easy fear.",1290297600,,1608,4.550173010380623
2787173,4,B000NVIGLG,"5 stars for the creepy factor!

ISOLATION is a gem of a monster movie.  The premise sounds incredibly stupid.  A pal of mine brought it over, and I was so impressed with it that I am simply still shaking my head in surprise.  The entire idea of an experiment gone wrong on cattle is not what one would expect to find on the surface of a great sci-fi/horror monster movie.  There are certainly things that could be better about the film.  The ""tractor in the water scene"" is absurd.  No farmer with ANY experience would do such a thing.  However, the movie is successful on a level that has to be seen to be believed.  I am a fan of creepy movies.  I am not a gore hound by any stretch.  I love atmosphere.  This film has well done gore, but it really shines in the atmosphere it creates.  It really makes you nervous to watch it.  That is what I enjoy most.  The spine tingles of the setting and the music and the ideas conveyed.  This movie has it all.  The acting is also superb.  Definitely worth a look!

2787189,4,B000NVIGLG,"Isolation (Billy O'Brien, 2005)

I just went back and counted, and somehow I have managed to watch fourteen horror movies over the past two weeks. (And I'm not counting those that were horrors because they're so awful.) Of the pack, I think my favorite of the bunch was Isolation, a low-budget chiller from what's rapidly becoming one of the new epicenters of indie horror, Ireland. While those who say you've seen this done before are absolutely right, I'm not convinced it's ever been done with the flat-out panache it's done with here, and it's certainly never been done with a cast of the caliber rustled up by Billy O'Brien for this flick. (And I say this as a hardcore X-Files devotee.)

Plot: John, a geneticist (Youth Without Youth's Marcel Iures), is experimenting with mucking about with cow DNA in order to produce more fertile, faster-growing cows. To this end, he has enlisted a farm out in the middle of nowhere run by Dan (The Secret of Roan Inish's John Lynch), as well as the local vet, Orla (Essie Davis, involved with the recent Dave Moore adaptation of Sweeney Todd). John's first experiments are about to come to fruition, as one of Dan's cows is about to give birth. When it does, though, after a long struggle in which Dan enlists the help of a couple of drifters who've parked their caravan across the road (Asylum's Sean Harris and Phedre's Ruth Negga), they discover the calf is a nasty little creature indeed. So nasty, in fact, that Orla kills it out of hand and performs an autopsy to find out what's gone wrong. It seems John's serum works too well; the calf was also pregnant, though her offspring were going to be hideous mutations. When one of the fetuses twitches, Dan and Orla write it off...

Yes, it's a B-grade monster movie, pure and simple, and like all B-grade monster movies, it's rife with moralizing tripe, but O'Brien recognizes the grand tradition he's working in and pays homage to the B-movies of the fifties while refining the formula with a modern sensibility, shuffling the moralizing off to a manageable level (no one actually comes up with an ""OMG GENETIC MANIPULATION IS BAD!!!one!"" outburst) and focusing on the tension. He also understands what I've always considered the cardinal rule of a good monster movie: the more you actually show the monster, the less effective the monster will be. Where most fifties homages I've been thrilled with over the past few years (Bacterium, The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, etc.) have been satire, Isolation plays it deadly serious, and comes up with a horror movie that's actually scary--and that in and of itself shows how much O'Brien improved on the formula. The more I think about this movie, the more impressed I am with it; may actually be one of the best horror movies I've seen this year. Well worth your time. ****",1259539200,5,2814,4.750511247443763
2787190,4,B000NVIGLG,"Darkly atmospheric, Isolation (2005) is a chilling horror adventure set on an Irish dairy farm.  The setting and events are unusual and obscure, and many of the details of the murky story are not provided, but there is still enough to produce a suspenseful tale.

Doctor John (Crispin Letts), of Bovine Genetics Technology is conducting confidential experiments on cows.  Dan Riley (John Lynch), is being paid for the use of his farm.  Orla Buckley (Essie Davis), a veterinarian also on the doctor's payroll, is helping to check the progress of the experiments.  The particulars are not revealed, but an unexpected genetic mutation has resulted in the presence of strange parasitic creatures in a newborn calf.  The fun begins, when one of the creatures gets loose on the farm.  Jamie (Sean Harris) and his girlfriend Mary (Ruth Negga), a pair of 'knackers', transients living in a mobile home just outside the farm, are the final players in an adventure with several unexpected twists.

Much is kept under wraps, which leaves you grasping for any solid information about what is happening.  The farm is like another world where different rules apply, and the audience is led along (like a cow), as things are revealed.  With limited special effects, things play out fairly well, and less turns out to be more, as the creature is mostly kept out of sight until the very end.  And once violence erupts, events move very swiftly.

The gloomy atmosphere of Isolation is so prevalent, that by the end, you almost feel a little wet and dirty, after watching the characters roll in hay, walk in the rain, wade through mud, and slide in a filthy, dank trough, sprinkled with monster guts.  Matters are reduced to the basics, as aside from a small gun used by vets for dispatching animals, they have practically nothing to fight with.  Dan is that rare farmer, who has no weapons, and except for the lab, things on the farm appear to be run down, with an apparent lack of decent electrical lighting.

The story could have been embellished further, but Isolation is still an edgy, effective thriller.  Writer/director Billy O'Brien seems very familiar with farm life, and featuring a calf being drawn out its mother with a pulley, and spinning it to get it to breathe, are nice realistic touches.  With an unfamiliar cast, you may not know what to expect, but the performances are quite strong, with mostly natural sounding dialog.  Lynch and Letts are very good, while Ruth Negga shows the potential for more mainstream films.",1258070400,3,2518,4.870892018779343
2787191,3,B000NVIGLG,"ISOLATION is a pretty good movie that could have been great. This Irish import follows the old school approach of building horror and tension through the story rather than thrusting bloody body parts and eviscerated corpses into your face every 15 minutes to make sure you're still awake. Don't let that remark lead you to believe that this film is lacking in the gore department because it most certainly is not. When things get messy with old Bessie down on the farm, they REALLY get messy. And there's a scene of a cow giving birth that will cause even the men watching to have sympathy pains.

However it abandons all it's subtlty in the last 20 minutes or so in favor of an exceedingly trite ending in which a secondary female character suddenly goes all Ripley and saves the day--until the even more obvious ""surprise"" real ending that is. The acting and direction are first rate here and it's refreshing to be treated to this kind of quality in a genre picture. The story itself, which deals with genetic manipulation of livestock on an isolated dairy farm, is a topical one. If only they had managed not to fall into the typical action picture trap at the end of the film and maintained their intelligent approach instead, this movie could have really been one to remember.

2787195,4,B000NVIGLG,"I went blind into `Isolation'. I must've read reviews on it before since I put it in my wish list, but I didn't remember anything about it. Honestly, I thought it was a Asian black haired horror movie because of the cover of the DVD. Then when I read the back (after already having ordered it), I was quite intrigued, but still thought it was gonna be another `so-so' movie.

To say the least, I was very surprised with this movie. Talk about a throw back to good horror. First off this movie doesn't treat you as a dummy. It assumes you can understand what is going unlike Hollywood who has to explain EVERYTHING nowadays. I absolutely loved that because it makes the movie seem more real, even though it's a monster movie. Second, the atmosphere was unbelievable. Another great throwback. The setting, the scenery, the lighting... all reminded me of some old great movies such as The Thing and Alien. I felt cold and wet. I could smell the cow manure. I could sense the feeling of being alone. And then there were the special effects. NO CG THANK GOD. Finally a movie goes back to the way a monster movie should be made. And it looked ever so real. The gore that was used was nicely and realistically done. The characters themselves were great also. Once again the movie doesn't tell you everything. And you know what, this is a horror/monster movie. Not a drama. I don't need to be told exactly what's going on these peoples lives. Just a little history and I'm good. And that's what is done here. We have our farmer (we find out that he used to be with the vet), our vet (who works for the scientist and MIGHT be involved with him), the scientist (who is crazy, or mad, or a genius), and two lovers (an interracial couple whose on the run from the girls brothers because her family doesn't like the guy).

And last but not least, we have the story. Not only is the story good, but the pacing of it is great. It, once again, reminds me a lot of older classics, and I can't help but, once again, think of `The Thing' and `Alien'. The reason why is because the pacing is slow, but not slow enough to bore you. They throw in certain things to keep your interest up and running. The movie doesn't just rush into it's monster. It takes its time with it. I love the fact that we are pretty much thrown into the middle of what's going on. The scientist has already done what he has done to the farmers cow, whether it was genetic engineering, or maybe cloning, I'm not sure, and I'm FINE with that. I don't care, because it was still interesting and left my mind wandering. The cow is close to giving birth already and the vet is there to check on her. She shoves her hand in the cow (I seriously couldn't tell if this was real or fake, and if it was real, wow... that actress really wanted that part..lol), and checks on the calf, only to get bitten. When the calf is born, you can tell there is something wrong with it right away. But there is even something more wrong with it than expected.

Was the movie perfect? Nah. Not really. There were a couple things that made me wonder why the heck would they do that (like the tractor scene in the water). But most of the movie was really well done. I thought the monster was interesting. You do see it, but not that great, and it looks weird. It wasn't very scary, yet at the same time it was. Mainly cause you know what it could do to you. And if I could change ONE thing about this movie, it would be how it ended. I won't ruin it for you, but I think they should've ended it where this one person was walking off...close scene...credits roll. We know what is going to happen after that because we are smart enough to know. The whole time in this movie you assumed this. Why give us a Hollywood ending where they have to tell you what's up... heh. But it doesn't ruin the movie, it's just that I didn't need it in there.

I highly recommend this movie. I also highly recommend you watch this at night and in the dark. And if it's raining outside, that would be even better.",1209600000,48,4020,4.292490118577075
2787196,3,B000NVIGLG,"""Isolation"" followed the predictable Horror Film Formula. Keep the monster under wraps for at least two-thirds of the film, then let all heck break loose. Typical.

While John Lynch (""In The Name of The Father"") did a fair job as the farm owner, the rest of the cast just seemed like two dimensional monster (jumble of toothpicks) fodder. There isn't any character developement to speak of, and some of the things that they did, didn't make much sense, either. One by one, they are picked off by a......jumble of toothpicks?! Hardly worth a scare.

Then there is the part where the scientist starts picking off some of the other characters, himself. Gee....you mean the monster (jumble of toothpicks) doesn't get full honors for being a monster (or should I say jumble of toothpicks)? Maybe it (jumble of toothpicks) should take it's (jumble of toothpicks) case to the Movie Monster's Union for breach of contract for allowing puny humans to do a monster's (jumble of toothpicks) job. It's only fair!

There were some good spots that kind of resembled suspense, so the film does not fail, totally. I did look at the concept art that the monster (jumble of toothpicks) was derived from, and couldn't help but think, gee, that looks like a jumble of toothpicks! A valiant effort was made to lend credibility to the science that creates the monster (jumble of toothpicks), but falls short, when the scientist ""in-charge"" leaves things up to the farmer to resolve.

While ""Isolation"" fails in a number of areas, the total presentation isn't as bad as, say, ""Monster"" (not the one with Charlize Theron, the other one. The stupid one), and this film does have a few dead spots, but a good late-night Independent B-flick to watch when there's nothing on cable.

2787201,5,B000NVIGLG,"""Isolation"" is one of the most riveting and frightening horror movies of the year, and one that retains a very real, believable air to it as it changes in tone from a kind of 'quiet' horror to a faster-paced, more apocalyptic tone.  With movies like this one, it's hard to know how much to say: on the one hand, you want to give people enough to go on, on the other hand there's a lot to be said for going into this kind of film without too much foreknowledge.  Starting off with a description of the opening acts should be safe.

  The setting is an isolated farm in rural Ireland where special attention is being payed to a pair of pregnant cows.  A lone man lives at the farm, but two scientists are dropping by regularly to check on the bovines, the result of some kind of deal the farm-owner seems to be wavering toward regretting.  A pair of young lovers in a beat-up old van who seem to be on the run from something and have chosen the general vicinity of that farm as a place to lay low for awhile, also enter the movie at an early point and end up caught in the events that are about to take place.  One night, the farm-owner is alone when one of the cows begins to give birth, a birthing about to go horribly awry.

  The movie is in no rush to get to the mayhem, and builds with a pace that I guess could be compared to that of ""Alien"" or ""The Descent"".  Very strong acting and excellent characterization do a lot to propel the story, and the interaction between different characters, even (in a nice touch) extending to the human characters and the farm animals.  The guy who runs the farm, for example, starts off seeming rather curt and nonsociable, but he keeps slipping and showing a concerned, softer side toward the movie's other players, including the animals.  He's like this old-fashioned breed of farmer, the kind who has names for and notices different mannerisms about each of the creatures he's got, and that also plays really well into the whole 'second thoughts' thing he's having about whether he should have gotten involved in what the company employing the main scientist, is working at.

  The special effects are phenomenal, actually superior to an awful lot of movies that probably have fifty times the budget.  Bob Keen, the same guy who headed up the effects department on the first couple ""Hellraiser"" movies, did a lot of the design here.  (Keen also directed 1995's criminally underappreciated, Still-unavailable-on-DVD ""Proteus"", which is a movie I highly recommend to anyone who likes ""Isolation"")

  This is essential viewing for any horror fan.  Of all the lower-profile horror movies of the last few years (it only went theatrical in a handful of countries, and there only on a few screens) this is one of the best possible picks out there, and one of the ones that most richly deserved to join movies like ""Saw"" and ""Exorcism Of Emily Rose"" as global hits.  10/10",1196726400,12,2907,4.5675675675675675
2787202,5,B000NVIGLG,"In the September issue of Fangoria Magazine in the Video Eye of Dr. Cyclops section, Dr. Cyclops gives Isolation 3 1/2 eyeballs out of four and makes this film his video of the month selection and deservedly so.  I highly recommend this to horror fans looking for something new.

The plot synopsis on the dvd jacket almost made this seem like it could be ridiculous and go over the top and get some laughs, instead the film and director take the material completely serious and actually attempt to scare the viewer with this film.

The setting for Isolation is just that an isolated farm in the cold boggy region of Ireland's countryside.  The farm is owned by Dan played by John Lynch who is a no b.s Irishmen that looks a little like an older version of Luke Wilson.  For extra money Dan allows scientific fertility experiments to be done on his cows by a doctor and the local vet Mary who we are to assume there is a history between Dan and her.  These experiments are obviously not supposed to be taking place so what better place then Dans Isolated farm.
Earlier in the day Dan approaches two transients Jamie and Orla who are lovers and who parked there vehicle outside of Dan's farm, Dan harshly tells them to be out by morning, as nobody is to know what is taking place.  However later in the night Dans cow goes into labor and with his phone down he needs to rely on these strangers for help and they do rise up.  And Something goes terribly wrong with the calf.

In horror films there are a few negatives that can happen with character development either there isn't much therefore when something happens to our victims it is less shocking because we as viewers really don't care, know them or really like them hence the scares don't cut deep.  Second the film takes most of the movie to develop the characters and the fans looking to be entertained with some carnage and gore get about 20 minutes of that usually at the end.  In Isolation we like these characters, they seem totally real and could be any of us, things are implied of the characters but there are no in depth explanations or detailed back stories, the director is confident his viewers can fill that in themselves.  So, subtly and slyly we get to know the characters and we care or are shocked if something happens to them, and these aren't well known actors where it's simply a shock if a movie star get s killed off early it's a shock because we don't want them to die.
So from the first five minutes we are taken in, as when the veterinarian sticks her hands up the cows canal to check on the test fetus she is bitten by the fetus which we learn later is pregnant itself!  So horror wise we get our gore intertwined with these believable characters which can be attributed to solid acting performances all around.

To recap Billy O' Brian does a fantastic job directing solid talented actors with a sense of urgency and an incredible real feel and good atmosphere.  We feel somebody has really messed up and something bad is going to happen and we care.  With some scares left to our imagination but no lack of jumps, and blood, and gore.  And a actually freaky creature keep an eye nearing the end when Orla is crawling through to find the creature and the figure we see lurking in the dark just ahead of her.
The scientist messes with mother nature and the experiment goes terribly wrong, now what is out there on this dark farm?  What would happen if it were to get out?  What happens if you get bit by one of these things?  And What if someone that is bit has sex later on, and seeing it can splice with human dna what would happen to said person if they were to get pregnant and would there baby be normal?  You'll have to watch and see.

Again, highly recommend to horror fans looking for something new to watch.",1189555200,6,3798,4.418938307030129
2787203,4,B000NVIGLG,"No mad killers!  No crazy scientists!  No demons rising from Hell!  What were they thinking?  This is a nice film that has some common folk trying to deal with something they don't understand and can't control.  They react well to the situation.  When I say well, I mean they react the way you might expect people to react.  They are scared and confused.  They are not a bunch of McGivers who come up with brilliant solutions.  The scenario is science fiction with some kind of creature replicating itself inside cows and passing their off spring on to human hosts.  In a way it does kind of become kind of standard fare in the last half hour of the film when they have to come to grips with the creature, but for the most part the focus of this film is the tension the various characters feel.  There also is a spirit of humanity overcoming prejudices here, as not everyone welcomes the squatters who play a big part in the movie.  The scene where the local constable advises the farmer to send the visiting couple on their way is very well done.  The constable is obviously reflecting the prejudice of the locals and it seems cruel, but he does it so naturally that it almost seems right.  His hate is in the right place if that makes any sense.  Then there is tolerance on the part of the farmer and acceptance and then cooperation.  This film works on a couple different levels, but most of all it works as just a dark, creepy horror flick that is very well done without big budget special effects.
