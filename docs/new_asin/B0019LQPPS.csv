It is not a work of gay cinema, there is no gay content in it, although the airbrushing of the woman's bare breasts on the cover may have led some to think that Gael Garcia Bernal was in bed with a man.  (Nothing wrong with that, I've enjoyed his steamy love scenes with men in several films!)  However, this film is actually a small, obscure masterpiece, brilliantly conceived by the very talented Hector Babenco, and depicts a long, moody, intermittent passion of the heart between two essentially incompatible people, a restless, drifting male and a woman given to periodic madness.  The intertextual reference to Truffaut's Story of Adele H. is very nice indeed.  And fans of Bernal, who has become the Alain Delon of our time, will be pleased by his performance here, one of his most epic and poetic performances ever.",1305244800,7,867,4.831081081081081
