8064392,2,B0009OL8NK,"The quality of this DVD is not awful, but also not so great. It's FULL SCREEN. And it's copied from videotape. I don't know if it's from a VHS tape, or a one-inch broadcast tape, but there are several tape glitches. Also, the image is not that sharp, and the colors are a bit faded.

Watching this DVD is like seeing it on a color TV in the 1970s.

This is NOT a horror film. It's a mystery/suspense/crime drama. That's apparent pretty quickly to those who've seen many horror and crime/suspense films. Each genre sets a certain tone, and certain cliches, early on.

The film begins with Jean Simmons wandering about her big mansion, hearing voices and seeing things. Is she seeing ghosts? Or going mad? Or is her husband -- Cliff Robertson -- trying to drive her mad?

Simmons ""dies"" early on. Then her husband sees ghostly images, and hears voices and the piano playing. This is the bulk of the film. LOTS of scenes with Cliff Robertson wandering about the house, seeing and hearing things. Has Simmons returned to haunt him? Or is someone onto Robertson and is now trying to drive him mad?

This goes on way too long. It gets real tiresome seeing Robertson wandering around so much. We can usually guess beforehand what new ""horror"" he's going to discover. I knew when he was called out to the graveyard by Judy Gleeson what Robertson would see.

They're barely in this film.

This is not the sort of mystery film that can be solved. It's more of a crime/suspense film. Everything is revealed in the last 5 minutes, and though it all fits together, most of the information was not given to the viewer, so there was no way to figure out the events.

The characters are curiously lifeless, stiff, and uninteresting. The actors just go through the motions, lifelessly wandering about and saying their lines.

I was mostly bored watching this film.",1373414400,2,2452,5.732782369146006
