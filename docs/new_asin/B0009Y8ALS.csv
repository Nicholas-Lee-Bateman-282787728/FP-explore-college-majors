2337929,5,B0009Y8ALS,"Best service yet, super fast and very good quality.  Thank you very much.  Having a lot of laught watching these shows",1323734400,4,118,4.571428571428571
2337930,5,B0009Y8ALS,"I purchased volumes 1-9 for a very good price. Some sellers aren't greedy and have good deals. This show is so much fun to watch and the skits are great. I love the Carol Burnett show. Now I'm trying to get more shows from the none greedy sellers. I can't believe that some sellers want over 200 dollars for 1 DVD,that's so greedy and should be banned. Hopefully no one will ever buy there high priced items.",1322352000,15,408,4.311688311688312
2337931,5,B0009Y8ALS,SUPER QUALITY- all original and I wish there was a set with ALL episodes for all the seasons. HIGH QUALITY for the price.,1321401600,16,121,4.304347826086956
2337932,1,B0009Y8ALS,The product description at the time I bought suggested that this was a more comprehensive set of shows - not just 18 episodes. Very overpriced for such a limited sampling.,1293408000,125,171,4.733333333333333
2337933,2,B0009Y8ALS,"I received this as a gift. And I was happy to get it. Because I would NEVER have paid $229.00 for 18 episodes. That is absolutely ridiculous. Don't get me wrong. The Carol Burnett Show was one of, if not the best, comedy/variety shows of all time. And I have greatly enjoyed watching the set of dvd's I received. But the cost of the set is out of the reach of most buyers. And that is unfortunate because Carols show was indeed a masterpiece.",1292889600,171,442,4.273809523809524
2337934,2,B0009Y8ALS,A bit disappointing from the receiver of this gift. It doesn't sound like worth purchasing.,1272153600,,91,5.133333333333334
2337935,5,B0009Y8ALS,"Volume 9 has an unusual occurrence: Guest stars Steve Lawrence & Tim Conway are featured in BOTH shows (incredibly, they originally aired just weeks apart!).
What makes this volume a five-star rater is the priceless content. The real surprise here is Carol's replay of the first show's dress rehearsal, in which Conway--who usually breaks everyone else up--cannot stop laughing during a sketch! Another Conway-driven sketch is him reprising his ""Old Man"" character, this time as a dresser for an actor...and Conway's physical comedy on a motorized garment rack is hysterical! Carol matches Conway's physical comedy genius in her old woman ""Zelda"", here in a sketch as a Hollywood relic. Carol & cast do a zany domesticated take on commercials invading a woman's home (and testing her sanity); and Carol & Conway play husband & wife who work different shifts in a lightly amusing sketch. And in one of the show's traditional musical productions, a pleasant change-of-pace: The entire cast participate in sort of improvised comedy/musical bits.
These highlights help lift what could have been standard Burnett Show fare.",1244505600,9,1118,5.286516853932584
2337966,5,B0009Y8ALS,"Great entertainment--GIve these to a sick person to brighten there day--you can watch them
over and over. Brought back memories of good comedy on TV.",1355961600,4,149,5.0
2337967,4,B0009Y8ALS,The service was great and the memories were wonderful!  Get the while they last!  Makes a great Christmas present. Ruth,1355961600,,119,4.9
2337968,4,B0009Y8ALS,"We enjoy the interview highlights and the episodes very much.
Recommend it to all nostalgia and skit presentation buffs!
Great humor!",1352592000,,133,5.380952380952381
2337969,2,B0009Y8ALS,"Carol could have picked better episodes. Steve Lawrence is pretty plain and so is the acting. I remember when this was first aired and I always felt disappointed when there was a guest, such as this. It made for a boring Saturday night.",1351382400,,236,4.511627906976744
2337970,4,B0009Y8ALS,I purchased the Carol Burnett Show which was a huge mistake. The price was huge and if I had to do it over I wouldn't have ordered the set.  It also pixilates.  I wish I had sent it back.,1348704000,6,187,3.769230769230769
2337971,5,B0009Y8ALS,"These are the actual Carol Burnett Shows, 2 per disk, 18 shows in all. It is a shame they do not sell more. The price is steep, but the shows are classics!",1337558400,4,155,3.875
2337972,4,B0009Y8ALS,There could have been half the amount of commentary by the three stars at the beginning of each episode. Other than that it qualifies as a great trip down memory lane.,1331596800,2,167,4.419354838709677
2337973,2,B0009Y8ALS,"I watched an infomercial about this show, and I ordered the first set, sort of like the old Columbia House Video Library, I was set up to get two discs (at $22 each!)every month. The first shipment, a trial, was inexpensive enough that I decided I'd try it. The Eunice/Momma sketches were absolutely some of the best sketch comedy to date, IMHO. When the DVD arrived a week later, I was eager to check it out. There was a classic skit with Sammy Davis Jr and Carol playing a horribly racist ""friend"" from the old days, followed by a Eunice sketch. Then a musical number started, and I suddenly remembered being SO utterly bored when these came on, that I'd usually find something else to do. I know that a very large percentage of her audience love/d those musical numbers, but they aren't my thing. She did a routine with Shirley MacLaine, a duet with each of them singing about the weird fan-mail that they each received. My eyes glazed over instantly, and the disc was turned off not long after that. These numbers are not short, either. The pricing is astronomical (especially these days), plus a fair percentage of each disc is devoted to musical/dance numbers, true to the original shows. They are out of the question for me (or others that just prefer the comedy). Maybe someone will start showing the Carol and Friends reruns again, although that is a stretch. What passes for ""classic"" comedy on most networks are from the 80s.",1329609600,37,1436,4.635294117647059
2337974,5,B0009Y8ALS,We watch these all the time. We hurt from laughing so hard! I recommend this to any fan of comedy! I will now look for all the episodes!,1326067200,12,136,3.892857142857143
2337975,5,B0009Y8ALS,Growing up we always watched this show. It is so funny I wanted my kids to be able to see what we watched. they laughed so hard! Wish they would show reruns on tv. Great price too,1324684800,,179,3.864864864864865

8070218,2,B0009Y8ALS,I like Carol Burnett but the DVD's seemed like copies - not originals.,1419724800,,70,4.461538461538462

8070222,4,B0009Y8ALS,i laughed and laughed  but one disc was bubbly and not useable.  i could have gone the rest of my life without seeing/hearing dina shore sing 50 ways.  my friend and i joke about it. there are a lot of steve lawrence episodes.,1388966400,,226,4.209302325581396

8070225,3,B0009Y8ALS,There's just too much singing and dancing on these videos for me.  I would rather have 9 DVDs of just comedy skits.,1358121600,,115,4.2272727272727275
8070226,3,B0009Y8ALS,"I thought it would be more skits and not so much musical stuff, but it's still good.  You can't beat Tim Conway and Harvey Korman",1357689600,,129,4.16
