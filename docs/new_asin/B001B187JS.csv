8281233,4,B001B187JS,"Vol 15, 1943 Part 3, has extensive footage of armor and other vehicles that you may never see in Western film.

We see soldiers aiding the victims of ""treacherous evil enemy attacks"" (that would be U.S. bombers) on cities, and the wreckage of a B-17. Stocking supplies into U-boats in preparation for duty. The scenes are even better than those in Das Boot. Railway cannon firing on Leningrad. The guns look like Dora (which you can see at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland). Troops boarding ships in a Baltic port to go home on leave, in broad daylight. I guess there were no issues with air cover at that point. Still using the Stuka in late 1943, and effectively, if you believe this film.

We see the Wehrmacht in small unit actions in the Battle of Orel. Looks like a recreation. We see Luftwaffe men manning a flak field unit. Now PzKw IIIs and IVs. And a Tiger I. Now it looks like real combat footage. Enemy losses are extraordinarily high, we hear, and then we get to see that. No German losses are shown. Rocket batteries blast the Soviets. Tank engagements in Russia. Daily soldier life. Some of the best footage I have ever seen of Tiger I tanks. Switch to Italy. Flak batteries (are those 88s?) are shooting down Allied planes during the Sicilian Campaign. Lots of them. Now the destruction of an Allied convoy by Luftwaffe bombers. Now Hitler greets his good friend the King of Bulgaria.

Back to the Eastern Front, Stukas are dive bombing and it looks like they did their job. Several destroyed T-34s litter the field. We see a PzKwIV with skirted armor. Panther PzKwV tanks and halftracks on their way to encircle the Russians. We see a Stug III and a long-barreled PzKw IV. More Stukas dive bomb Soviet positions. Then to Field Marshall Kesselring in Italy. He was highly regarded by both sides; one of the few senior German leaders against whom no war crimes were ever suggested.

Watch it in German language with English subtitles to avoid the badly-done English language narration.",1368576000,2,2004,4.684659090909091
