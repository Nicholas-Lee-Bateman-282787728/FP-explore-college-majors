8248753,5,B00132D7W2,"Oh boy! Brock Lesnar in the UFC, making his debut against a former champion, Frank Mir. Up to this point, Mir has had somewhat of a shaky comeback. His return was a first round TKO loss to newcomer, Marcio Cruz, in UFC 57. His next fight was a Unanimous decision win over Dan Christison in UFC 61. Then he lost in just over a minute in UFC 65 against Brandon Vera. But in UFC 74 he looked like the old Mir, and he submitted Antoni Hardonk at 1:17! But seriously, was Frank Mir back for real? Moronic, Barbaric, and quite frankly BRASH Brock Lesnar is taking on the challenge to answer the question for Frank Mir. Despite Frank Mir being a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu master, and a brilliant wizard on the ground, Lesnar thinks this is nothing. I mean, come on! Brock Lesnar owns a 1-0 MMA record over Min Soo Kim by TKO. Does anybody know who Min Soo Kim is? I don't either. Frank Mir, well, he's ready to fight.

Then you have a title shot for two very eager contenders. Although interim, the Heavyweight title is up for grabs. And yeah, Tim Sylvia is one of the contenders. Sylvia has been champion, and he loves that belt. But former Pride champion, Antonio ""Minotauro"" Nogueira wants the belt too, and he's never been finished. And his 4 losses have only come at the hands of Fedor Emelianenko, Dan Henderson and Josh Barnett. Tim Sylvia wants to be the first to knock out Nogueira. That would be saying something, and a great way to win the belt.

This is Breaking Point, UFC 81! There are 9 fights total, and I'll list them below.

Rob Emerson vs. Keita Nakamura: Emerson is coming off of a ruthless no contest in the Ultimate Fighter 5 Finale when he fought Gray Maynard. And Nakamura wants a first win as well. A good, scrappy fight, and the split decision is a well deserved victory for the winner.

Terry Martin vs. Marvin Eastman: Marvin Eastman has had quite the highlight reel in the UFC...courtesy of other fighters. Vitor Belfort, Travis Lutter and ""Rampage"" Jackson have put him away before the 3rd round ever occured. Terry Martin has had a little more UFC success, but not much more. I'll just say that there is a first for the winner by unanimous decision.

David Heath vs. Tim Boetsch: You wanna see a wild and crazy first round finish? Watch this scrap, and you got it!

Chris Lytle vs. Kyle Bradley: Somebody came into this with not much of a chance. It barely made it past 30 seconds!!

Tyson Griffin vs. Gleison Tibau: Another fight of the night for Tyson? Tibau is always one to bring it. A good match that goes to a unanimous decision.

Ricardo Almeida vs. Rob Yundt: The return of a UFC veteran, Almeida, welcomes newcomer Rob Yundt. But this ends with a submission pretty quickly in the first round.

Nate Marquardt vs. Jeremy Horn. Two ground wizards who know how to put up a fight! But it ends with a submission in the 2nd round. I loved it!

Brock Lesnar vs. Frank Mir: Completely satisfying! Just watch the fight.

Tim Sylvia vs. Antonio ""Minotauro"" Nogueira: Who would've thought that Tim Sylvia would be part of the Fight of the Night? He was, it was, and in the end, it was nothing short of amazing. Hats off to the victor!!

Great night of fights? Who knows? That depends on the viewer. I was completely satisfied, so hopefully I'm not satisfied too easily! But I liked what I saw.",1215216000,2,3309,4.4693200663349915
8248754,4,B00132D7W2,"Since the UFC puts on ok but not great cards for their $44.95 ppv fee, I don't purchase the ppv and wait for the dvd's to come out a few months later. This was a good card, especially the main event and is worth watching. Funny, Tim Sylvia is at his best in this fight, aggressive and really trying to take it to Nog, but........ (I don't want to spoil it for anybody who hasn't seen it.) Brock Lesnar makes his debut and shows some real serious potential as a mma fighter, even though his debut is quite brief. Good card but by no means great. Purchase Pride 33 Second Coming or Pride Shockwave if you would like to see a GREAT card packed with top fighters.",1215216000,,659,4.196850393700787
8248755,5,B00132D7W2,The main event gave me my 20 bucks worth alone. Mir vs Lesnar was an awesome fight as well!,1213056000,,91,3.8421052631578947
8248756,5,B00132D7W2,Brock Lesnar finally makes his UFC debut against former HW Champ BJJ expert Frank Mir. Tim Syliva takes on former Pride Star Minatoru Nogguira for Randy Coutures HW title.  A must buy for all MMA fans. UFC should start releasing the events on Blu-Ray.,1208390400,2,251,4.704545454545454
8248757,5,B00132D7W2,"WOW, this was a very good event. Not only did Pride champion Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira fight for the interim title, but Brock Lesnar makes his huge UFC debut.  If you haven't seen this event yet, i strongly recommend buying it. It was one of the best i've seen. I won't spoil the results for you but lots of fights don't go the distance.

PRELIMINARY CARD
Chris Lytle vs. Kyle Bradley
Terry Martin vs. Marvin Eastman
Keita Nakamura Vs. Rob Emerson

David Heath vs. Tim Boetsch
Tim Boetsch makes his UFC debut against David Heath who is coming off 2 losses from Babalu and Machida. Wow did this fight surprise me. You never know what to expect from a guy making a debut but Boetsch showed us very impressive striking. Front leg kicks and vicious strikes to a redneck judo throw end this fight in the first round.

MAIN CARD
Tyson Griffin vs. Gleison Tibau

Rob Yundt vs. Ricardo Almeida
Ricard Almeida is a UFC veteran and I was really looking forward to his return. , replacement for an injured Alan Belcher, makes his UFC debut. This turned out to be a great ground battle with lots of excitement. Doesn't make it past the first round but both guys looked good.

Nate Marquardt vs. Jeremy Horn
Nathan Marquardt, coming off a loss to Anderson Silva takes on one of the most experience mma fighters Jeremy Horn. With a record of -----, Jeremy Horn has a great amount of experience and is one of the best submission guys out there. Marquardt, coming off the loss to Silva was hungry for a victory, and possibly a rematch with Silva later on. Horn was a late replacement and came into the fight looking rather chubby. The fight was excellent while it lasted and doesn't make it to the decision.

Brock Lesnar vs. Frank Mir
WWE superstar Brock Lesnar makes his UFC debut against Frank Mir in a highly anticipated fight, mainly for Lesnar. With only one fight before this, people didn't know what to expect from Lesnar. Obviously the guy looks like a beast and he definitely showed a very aggressive style while the fight lasted. Frank Mir has always been questioned since his post-accident performances. This fight is a must see battle and a very rewarding and deserving victory.

Tim Sylvia vs. Antonio Rodrigo ""Minotauro""Nogueira
Before this fight happened, many people speculated a boring 5 round decision leaning towards Tim Sylvia winning the fight. What was displayed that night was the complete opposite. Nogueira and Sylvia both came to win and were very close to finishing at times which made for a very exciting fight. I won't ruin what happened during the fight but Nogueira always proves he's the man no matter what happens and Sylvia showed us why we should respect him again.",1206576000,8,2684,4.683651804670913
