8605304,5,B001MUON7I,"I am very impressed by this DVD.  This volume focuses solely on the guard position and is absolutely loaded with offensive and defensive techniques.  As always, the material is presented in a very clear manner and each technique is followed by examples from multiple angles.  If you want to learn reality based ground fighting (as opposed to sport ground fighting), this DVD should be your first purchase.",1269993600,,405,5.014925373134329
