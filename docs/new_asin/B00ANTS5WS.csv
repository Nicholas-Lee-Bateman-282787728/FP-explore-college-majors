8554889,5,B00ANTS5WS,This DVD is very interesting and covers the geology of the caldera and the result of the forest fires. My children and I used to fish in the area about 35 years ago and it was disappointing seeing the forest looking like blacked toothpicks when we visited the caldera in June 2015.,1447027200,,281,4.423076923076923

8554891,4,B00ANTS5WS,"Interesting DVD explaining the formation of one of the World's 5 super volcanos.  400 X more powerful than Mt. St. Helens... Valles Caldera last erupted 50,000 years ago.  This DVD has great animation, aerial views, and in-depth analysis of the genesis of volcanos.  Valles Caldera is very beautiful and the drive from Albuquerque to Santa Fe through Los Alamos, the birthplace of Atomic Power, is fascinating.  Exposed Rhyolite layers (lava) a thousand feet thick, sitting on red sandstone from the Jurassic period, Soda dam, resurgent dome, hot springs, thermal wells, water shed, forest fires... the effects are analyzed  in a way that explains it all.  Great for a science student or amateur geologist.",1365984000,5,706,5.20353982300885
