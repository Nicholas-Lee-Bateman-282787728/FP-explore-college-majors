8629118,5,B00H1HJLIW,There are a ton of books/DVD's on Alcatraz that essentially give the same textbook facts. What makes this enjoyable is all the little known stories as told by someone who actually grew up on the island. Definitely worth it if you're looking for a more intimate Alcatraz experience.,1392163200,,281,4.875

His father was a prison guard and his family grew up on the island; his uncle was an Associate Warden and his cousin was an Officer on Alcatraz. This is a very interesting, educational and fascinating video with great history Chuck Stucker has shared for all.  Anyone who is interest in Alcatraz would love to hear chuck's personal stories and see the tour he takes you on.  I really enjoyed hearing all about the 1946 riot and prison escape attempt along with his dad's role in that.  Chuck Stucker is a true historian and I highly recommend this video.  I loved all the archived documentation and photographs that he shared as well.

Steve Davis who filmed the footage of this video has interesting stories of his own.  His uncle was an actual inmate on Alcatraz Island # 666 who was housed right next to Machine Gun Kelly.  He is a also a 3 time Emmy Award winner.

I, myself, was born and raised in the Bay Area and looked at Alcatraz Island all the time no knowing all the unique stories and history I know now.  I finally visited Alcatraz after living in the Bay Area for 36 years and now watched this video years later after my visit.  It has given me even more wonderful information that I didn't know about and a new perspective. If you are interested in Alcatraz, going to visit Alcatraz or after a visit to Alcatraz. It's a must see!",1391212800,,1465,4.511363636363637

8629122,5,B00H1HJLIW,"Unmatched insight into Alcatraz, from the perspective Chuck Stucker (Son of a Guard), who lived on Alcatraz island from 1940-43 and 1948-53. Live footage of Chuck's narratives, as he walks through the prison and across the island. With the use of numerous archived photos and documents, Chuck relives so many fascinating stories about the prisoners, their guards, the attempted prison breaks, day to day life on the Rock, and his own personal experiences. His narratives follow the evolution of the island from the 1800's to present. He captures so much detail, you will come away feeling like an expert on Alcatraz. Chuck also injects a nice sense of humor to his narratives, and the high quality camera work from Steve Davis is a bonus. Highly Recommended",1388620800,,757,5.015873015873016
