4651047,5,B005C4444C,"...and I don't understand why. This film is gorgeously made, edited, thought out, the acting is solid, the meaning one's own... I don't know why it hasn't been shown in more countries? It will either become a cult classic or so many people will begin to talk about it that it will be shown in film history classes the world over and then it will receive the merit that it deserves. Seriously, if you want almost two-hours of the most imaginative, seamlessly interwoven, surreal narrative, this is the film to see. It's magical realism meets science fiction meets love story meets Maya Deren. Rent it, it will be worth your view.

And please, spread the word. This a gift too precious to be so unknown.",1295740800,150,701,4.608
4651048,5,B005C4444C,"Absolutely breathtaking, not so much the special effects, which display every penny spent on this film, but the incredibly involving and emotional life stories of Nemo.  It's a long film, so take care of any distractions and settle in, it demands close attention and involvement.  I can understand, to some extent, why it wasn't a commercial success in this country, no monsters or super heroes, but the lack of critical recognition is astounding, and speaks volumes about the vacuous nature of our film industry, top to bottom.

4651058,1,B005C4444C,"Spoiler Alert: Nemo dies a horrible death about 20 times. I didn't actually count them, but at once every ten minutes x 2 1/2 hours long =  approximately 25 times. This movie is about how any little choice or chance occurrence in life can lead to a totally different sequence of events, but each life will still end with a horrible death (and a horrible marriage too). Towards the end good luck keeping all the lives separate because as the movie progresses the repeated events fragment off into smaller and smaller branches. A very interesting idea (that's why I bought it) but no plot at all and what is left becomes too confusing to try to hold together. It's like multiple movie scripts happening simultaneously with the same events happening differently in each take, but stretched out to 155 minutes. And way too much exaggerated emotions from some of the characters. Everyone is beyond depressed. Me too watching this.",1501027200,2,925,4.817610062893082

4651061,1,B005C4444C,"Oh, God, this was boring and predictable. Also it's a romance. I can't understand why this movie was reviewed so favorably. The look and style and images of the future are not so interesting (yay everyone wears white with some gray accents). The story has been done before. There are no new perspectives. The plot is predictable. The acting was unremarkable. There were some subplots that were confusing and made no sense. I couldn't figure out how they fit in the with the rest of the movie, but it really didn't seem that important for me to figure out how they fit. I must have missed a scene that connected them somehow. I don't think it would have made much difference had I fit those pieces in. It's sort of like momento where some threads of the plot go forward in time and other threads go backward in time. That's fine. I could follow along. I just didn't care. Then I started getting irritated because I just wanted the movie to get to the point, but I knew what that point was going to be, so I end up watching it just to see if maybe the movie is going to surprise me and not do what it seems to be setting up to do. But no, it did it. The moral to the story was live life to the fullest and be sure to pick the right woman to spend your life with (hint: it's not the depressive one that sobs in bed nonstop'') The movie was probably also about some other stuff that didn't seem particularly salient to my going concerns in life... Also the part about him being the last mortal human is completely irrelevant. That has nothing to do with the plot. He is not even supposed to be part of the future timeline filled with immortal douchebags. He's just there as a sort of waiting sport before he goes back in time to pick a lucky girl to spend his life with. What moral does that give the rest of us who don't get to zip back in time to stop ourself from marrying the depressing emotional trainwreck or the screeching harpy? It says ""Well, tough luck chump because look at how awesome it would be if you could go back in time and make the right choice at the most crucial decision in your life. But, it's pretty thought provoking, right?"" See? See how that doesn't do anybody any good? How does anybody benefit from this movie? In my case it just made me dwell on the mistakes I've made in life and how I'm stuck with them and how I have no idea what new mistakes I may make tomorrow. That's the human condition and this movie has nothing to offer... I am suspicious that people who like this movie may well be idiots.",1497484800,3,2526,4.253638253638254

4651074,2,B005C4444C,"A ridiculously tedious & exhausting movie based on the premise that all choices possible occur in parallel dimensions (although this movie does not postulate the dimensional issue). We, the audience have to sit thru every possible condition of what his life could have been through various choices but randomized in a chaotic manner & thrown out to an audience completely out of order or context without any baseline. You keep checking the DVD to see how close you are to the ending.

It literally exhausts you to watch this movie. The only other movies which wore me out like this were  ""They shoot horses don't they"" & ""2001 a space odyssey"". Then there is the totally unnecessary issue of him wetting his pants. I feel sorry for the child actor who must have endured unbearable peer ridicule. There was no reason for it. It added nothing to the film or story. It would have been the same film without the wetting. The details of his life continuously change in a nonsensical manner without any reference point until the very end.

This film reminds me of a modern art painting where someone shoots paint balls at a canvas & everyone raves about how great the mess of paint splotches are and no one has the courage to call it what it really is.

Most people would likely find this movie tiresome & become restless & bored  after the first 20 minutes unless your interest is psychology or existentialism.

Not recommended. Watch Bicentennial Man instead.",1481500800,2,1455,4.7312252964426875
4651075,5,B005C4444C,"A wonderful movie about a multiverse of infinite choices, entropy of information and life, and tragedy.  I feel sorry--or maybe not--for the ignorant reviewers who give one or two stars simply because They are Simple, members of the lower 50%, by definition, population with I.Q.s below 100.  They will never get it, those who believe Ignorance Is Strength, and who have never heard of The Butterfly Theory.  This movie appeals to educated people with emotional sensitivity, and does not appeal to those who base their review on their own stupidity.  Such morons often give one star because their disc would not play, or they want their time and money back because one of their much-smarter friends recommended Mr. Nobody.  The authorities should follow these bad people, because they are ready to troll and even murder their poor friends (those who passed  thermodynamics).  One Big Lesson of this great movie is YOU PROBABLY CANNOT GET YOUR TIME OR MONEY BACK WHEN YOU FAIL.  Sad but true.

Extreme paths interfere and the most likely paths reinforce so what happens most resembles classical motion. The same is true of the protagonist Nemo in this film. We see all the consequences of the major choices he could have made in his lifetime playing out. You could also check Everett's many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics as well as the collapse of the wavefunction for additional tie ins to quantum mechanics.

The film also discusses entropy giving time its direction. In a sense Nemo has come unstuck in time and can travel backwards and forwards. Is this just in memory? Maybe so. Maybe not.",1474675200,8,759,4.9763779527559056

4651088,4,B005C4444C,"What would you do if you were able to contact a version of yourself from 10yrs ago?  Or 20yrs?  If you're in a failed marriage, would you warn yourself to steer clear of your future spouse?  If you're in an unrewarding / dead-end career, would you advise yourself to seek employment elsewhere from where you work now?  For myself, I know that I would give a 35yr old version of myself a RED ALERT to bypass making a huge mistake that nearly bankrupted me.

The current film explores this possibility.  Different choices, of course, lead to different outcomes.  Sometimes, what look like positive choices can lead to negative outcomes ~ and vice-versa.  Without the ability of precognition, all of us are subject to the law of unexpected consequences as we traverse our lives.

This is a rather long-winded story and be fore-warned that it is introspective in the extreme.  That's not a bad thing, but it's not for everyone.  For people who are looking for a ""meaning of life"" film, they could do much worse than this 1.

4651094,1,B005C4444C,"This movie is a disjointed romp through one person's life who is supposed to be special because he is the last mortal on earth. It is supposed to have something profound to say, teaching viewers about life's meaning and making choices. However, it is a long-winded amble that ultimately says nothing about anything. A phrase on the CD box cover states: ""If you never make a choice, anything is possible,"" which reinforces the inanity of the director's attempt to be profound. The main character's interview (recorded with a reel-to-reel tape recorder?) ends with a typical Western European/North American attempt at providing great, reflective insight into our existence, but the old man really has nothing to say. The main character made decisions at three points in his life that ultimately shaped his life: how insightful! Apparently the director and writer do not realize you cannot go back in time, you cannot ""never make a choice"" (because not choosing is ultimately making a choice and the main character continually makes choices, so who is never making a choice?), you cannot wallow in or change the decisions made in the past, and, having been on this planet for forty-nine years, wisdom rarely comes with age. The whole thing is dreadfully exacerbated by so-called artistic cinematography (sideways filming, a half face shot filling half the screen, etc. etc.). The movie is so intentionally surreal and hyper-modernistic that it literally can have no meaning. Sometimes people, especially European film makers, try so hard at meaning that they end up with meaninglessness. This movie is a perfect example.",1466467200,4,1617,5.175572519083969

As the story continues it really explores and questions quantum realities, which is a very fun topic!  The Butterfly Effect is mentioned in the movie as well.

  Nemo Nobody lives in different timelines, spanning from a crucial point from age 9, when his mother leaves on a train:  1.  He stays with his father, grows up; 2.  He manages to get on the train with his mother, and grows up with her.  He experiences what life would have been like with each parent, all in the blink of an eye.  But regardless of the timelines, he somehow ends up being the oldest mortal alive at age 118, where the last day of his life is recorded and viewed for all of the world to see.  During this time, he is under the care of nurses, a psychiatrist, and interviewed by a journalist.

At that time, it was kind of confusing. It seemed more like a experimental film.
Now that the bluray is on huge sale, I bought it and watched it again.
I felt very good this time. It was more like his first film TOTO LE HERO.
It has great beautiful moments -visual moments- that definately copied on purpose from his first one.
About the story, The relationsip between the boy and his step sister is also interesting. But not as interesting as cinematography.
Above all, the visual is way absorbing then the storyline.

4651141,4,B005C4444C,"Calf-eyed actor Jared Leto - an actor many viewers recognize but can't name - delivers a strong performance in Mr. Nobody.  He is easily dismissed as the quintessential ""pretty boy,"" but demonstrates stunning talent here.  He is required to alternate appearances as a 118-year old man with his 34-year old selves in this science fiction romantic fantasy.  The overall strength of the film is uneven, but Leto shines.

Long-time viewers may remember Dustin Hoffman's performance as a 100-year old man in the early Seventies film ""Little Big Man.""  Others may recall Guy Pearce's performance in Ridley Scott's recent ""Prometheus.""  Both Leto's makeup and performance are much better than its predecessors.  His voice, movements and rhythms are amazingly authentic.  Whenever his grizzled self is on screen, Leto mesmerizes.

The supporting cast is also very strong.  These are pretty people in almost all phases of their lives, but the child, teen and adult actors all give deeply affecting performances.  Fortunately, physical types were so carefully selected that they are plausible versions of single characters at different ages of development.

Audiences are challenged by the film's Multiple Worlds Interpretation structure, however.  Though the term (from Quantum Mechanics) may be new to most viewers, the narrative structure it uses is not:  the story is told in flashbacks from the elderly man's point of view.  It hops back and forth between the protagonist at ages nine, seventeen, thirty-four and 118.  Several films have been made using this format over the past fifteen years.  The novelty of ""Mr. Nobody"" is that the audience sees alternate-universe versions of the character at a given age.  These versions differ depending on which choice the protagonist chooses at key points in this life.  For example, does the nine-year old choose to live with his father or mother?  With neither?  We see vignettes of how his life develops after making his choice.  Feedback indicates that this novelty is too much for many viewers to accept; the plot becomes too dense here, without proportional rewards.

There are also other problems here.  Like the film ""The Time-Traveler's Wife,"" many viewers grouse that they dislike that the science fiction premise of the story is used only to serve a romantic theme.  As one 34-year old self, Leto gives video lectures as a physicist-cum-biologist.  His pseudo-scientific explanations of what is happening in the film feel forced and hokey, but many viewers want to see more about what the protagonist has done with his life, other than make love.  Moreover, I can imagine the impatience many feminists might have with this film; many complained about how the time-traveler's wife's travails were reduced to her loneliness at his long absences.  Here, the protagonist experiences three sweet-but-tragic romances with different lovely women.  Each woman only experiences one part of the protagonist's multiverse life.  Is that fair?

In any case, many viewers give up in frustration long before the film ends.  That's unfortunate; this film does reward the viewer, but only after requiring great patience and focus.",1441324800,,3161,5.285140562248996

4651145,5,B005C4444C,"What is destiny? What is fate? For that matter, what is time? This existential journey takes us through multiple parallels of time, existing or imagined we are never quite sure which life path Nemo takes or if he's lived them all in some parallel universes. It shows us that all action (or non-action) is interrelated and that in the end, your life and journey are based on the decisions you make. It is a colorful, wild, marvelous, creative and artistic look through the human mind, into a life (or lives) lived through glimpses of memory (or wishful thinking) to the past. Jared Leto portrays Nemo perfectly and always seems to shine in these kinds of roles,giving a magnificent performance. His bright blue eyes express so many emotions, the film could be without sound and you'd still understand and get the gist of it. I saw many familiar glimpses of other film styles in this movie, my favorite the 2001 Space Odyssey tribute which only movie lovers or fans of the film will understand.

4651148,4,B005C4444C,"This movie is gorgeously filmed and engagingly acted. It's use of special effects is at once innovative, sometimes moving, and always restrained.

The story jumps around. A lot. If you dislike nonlinear narratives, then this movie might not be for you.

I spent a sleepless night trying to figure out the internal logic of the movie, which I suppose is a measure of its quality, that I would even bother thinking about it. Here is what I came up. I don't think this gives away anything. And it's just one person's opinion.

The movie brings together two pop science ideas: parallel universes and chaos theory. The idea of parallel universes is that every moment spawns infinitely many, nearly identical universes. The idea of chaos theory is that two systems with imperceptible initial differences can nevertheless have radically different futures. So, here's my take on the central character of the movie. If there are infinitely many, wildly divergent universes spawned at each moment, then in one of them, there must eventually be a version of you who is not only the last mortal on the planet, but who also knows what has happened in all the infinitude of other alternate universes. Why not, right? If there are infinities upon infinities of universes out there, then anything that can conceivably happen WILL in fact happen in one of them. I don't know if this interpretation is right, wrong, or sideways. But check the movie out, and spend a sleepless night trying to make your own sense of it :)",1438473600,5,1502,4.836575875486381

Overall, worth watching as a mediation on the human experience and contemplation of the road not taken. Its also not too full of itself, which is an achievement in and of itself for these types of movies (e.g., K-PAX) However, before considering the movies philosophy too deeply, I would caution the viewer to remember the unalterable fact about reality, as expressed by Aslan in Prince Caspian: To know what would have happened, child?

You do not have to understand M-Theory to follow the movie, the relevant aspects are explained in the movie without getting into the boring details. Also this movie's version of infinite pre-birth knowledge is explained near the beginning of the movie.

This paragraph may be a slight spoiler but on the other hand it might help in understanding the movie sooner, it is a bit confusing at first. The jumping of time and timelines (AKA dimensions) reminded me of ""The Butterfly Effect"" however in this movie instead of the main character traveling back in time and changing the timeline as of the point in time he jumped back to then returning to a drastically changed present, he is simply remembering all of the dimensions simultaneously while he himself seems to be in a dimension in which he did not previously exist. The jumping around in time and sometimes being confused about where in the timeline he is (or which timeline he is in), and to a lesser extent having foreknowledge of what will happen, is what reminded me of ""Slaughterhouse-Five"".

If the point is to kick off a philosophical discussion fine, but the movie summary doesn't match the actual movie at all.

Cannot recommend unless you want eye candy and bunch of questions afterwards.  I enjoy movies off the beaten path but this was just bizarre in the end.  A tad more effort to tie up the story and maybe I would have liked it more.

He absolutely MADE this film in every way; all the way up to playing the old man in full make up...the make up was amazing by the way.  I only paid .99 to watch this and I felt like I was ripping off the movie company & producers!! I'm not sure this film ever made it into the theatres but that's OK...MANY good films never do.

It is too confusing, overlapping and complicated; there is no through line to help the audience know where he is in his emotional life, he seems not to grow or to change and so seems static. I got no sense of who he is, though he seems a nice enough man. he has children, but we don't get to know them and so we don't see him through their eyes, we don't see his value to them as a parent. he has wives but we don't get to know them in depth either. his wives and children are pleasant most of the time but they are not really featured characters, except his depressed wife. altogether I'd rate it a relatively ambitious story with not enough clarity to help the audience understand it. 2 and 1/2 stars.",1402963200,,1000,4.2408376963350785

The movie centers on him but he doesn't bring ego to the character. He underplays it and so we are spared heroics and smug self awareness.

4651278,5,B005C4444C,"As the founder of a brand new online film site (an affiliate of Amazon called eflixir.com), Im constantly on the lookout for great films to recommend to my audience so that they don't have to spend so much time searching, and they can spend more time watching.  On eflixir, weve curated over 3,000 uplifting Hollywood films so that our audience can be confident that everything they find on our site will entertain, provoke,  and inspire.  But thats still quite a lot to choose from, and theres still the need to make ongoing recommendations that our audience will appreciate and trust.

So last night I was looking for something new and interesting, and I came across a film that Id never heard of called Mr. Nobody. Written and directed by Belgian filmmaker Jaco Van Dormael, it had originally been released in Europe in 2010 without opening in the US, and then it made its American debut in November of last year without much box office fanfare.  However, it featured an appealing cast (Jared Leto, Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger, Rhys Ifans, and Juno Temple), it had gotten some decent reviews and ratings on various online channels, and the description (In this sprawling sci-fi epic, the last mortal in a world of immortals reviews his life at age 120, considering multiple diverging realities that spring from a pivotal moment on a train platform) sounded intriguing, so I decided to give it a watch.

As an independent filmmaker myself, I am fairly adventurous with my selections because I am well aware that most movies don't have the advertising budget to render them visible amidst the glut of studio tentpoles.  However,  the majority of time when I take a flier on a film that I have never heard of, I am underwhelmed if not outright disappointed.  This is certainly not to say that most blockbusters deserve all the noise and bluster that is made around them.  Nor is it to say that all great movies get the recognition that they deserve.  Some of my favorite films are foreign or indy titles that pass way beneath the popular radar.  However,  it is often the case that obscure movies are obscure for a reason.  Even if they are decent, they are rarely extraordinary.

So my expectations were limited, but as the film began and progressed, I was quickly engaged, then enthralled, and finally amazed. No summary can do Mr. Nobody justice, but in essence it is about a very old man in a futuristic society who tells his life story, or rather stories, in a series of what may either be flashbacks, dreams,  or figments of his imagination, as his listeners try to make sense of it all and find, ultimately, that it may not be sense at all that matters.

You know a movie is great when you don't want it to end.  By the time the credits rolled, I was aching for more.  I was dumbstruck and in awe of this gorgeous, profound, mystifying film.  I was exhausted, as if Id just exercised really well, and my mind was abuzz with questions.  What does it mean?!  Does it matter what it means?!  Is there meaning at all, or only love and loss and railroad tracks leading one way or the other?  Ordinarily, I am a lover of clarity, but for the two plus hours I watched  Mr. Nobody, I was fully taken by its hypnotic surrealism and provocative paradoxes.  Like a zen koan in ravishing technicolor, it is a feast for the eyes, the emotions, the mind and the soul.

Similar to many of the comments I read afterwards online, I was left to wonder, amidst all of my other questions, why I and more people like me had never heard of this film. Simultaneously, I was a bit thrilled by its obscurity, like I had discovered something rare and valuable, or like I was suddenly privy to an exclusive club.  Moreso, however,  I had a powerful urge to share this treasure with everyone I could, not only for their sake, but so that we could spend hours afterwards discussing it.

Bad movies are left on the sticky floor with your empty popcorn box as soon as you leave the theatre.  Good movies go home with you and leave you thinking about them for a little while afterwards.  Great movies linger on the screen of your mind long after the projector has been turned off.  The best of them, in my opinion, provide you something that you can pluck from the screen and apply to your reality.  You want to talk about them,  decipher them,  grow from them.

I was so ecstatic to find Mr. Nobobynot only because it is a new addition for my list of favorites, but because  it provides so much food for thought and opens so many doors for conversation.  I may not agree with all of its conclusions, but there are few things I love more than a well told story that entertains and simultaneously stimulates deep reflection and introspection.  Do yourself a favor and watch this gem of a film, and then join the conversation  on eflixir.com with  a growing community that is anxious to discuss, debate, and celebrate great movies that matter.",1398556800,3,4915,4.576659038901602

Choosing whether or not to pursue one (or all) of those happenstanst choices is what this movie is about.

Very surprising to me how good this movie was. I am one to stay with a movie for at least 1/2 way -- and if it has some redeeming quality, I will see it through. This movie was a little on the odd-ball side, which is okay with me. I like the way movies can twist and turn. The redeeming quality to this movie was the superb acting and directing. The slightly Sci-Fi aspect made for an interesting slide... but in my opinion was not really necessary. It held it's own.

I can't answer those two questions, but I can tell you why you should watch it. In a word, it's brilliant. This is a powerful film. The script, acting and the cinematography are exemplary. The story hinges around the fact that each choice we make collapses the range of possible trajectories our lives can take.

As a nine year old child, Nemo was faced with the impossible task of which parent he should choose in a fractured marriage. From there, we explore his possible lives. In this respect, it's more 'Life of Pi' than 'The Butterfly Effect', but, to me, 'Mr. Nobody' was more profoundly engrossing than either. It's not a short film, but it would have seemed so even if it were an hour longer. It's not an easy film either, but that's one of its many endearing qualities.

It's a very complete film in that it has elements of several genres. It's a skilfully woven tapestry. I watched it via streaming (last night), but I'm buying the Blu-ray today - if for no other reason than to support it in some small way. I think it's a masterpiece - truly one of the best films I've ever seen. I suppose that answers my opening questions.

4651294,5,B005C4444C,"EVERYTHING about this movie was terrific! All of the acting was nice, the script was well done for such a complicated concept.  I enjoyed the Ashton Kutcher old movie actually called ""The Butterfly Effect"" but it used the concept as a more simple plot device...though explaining it.  This actually walked you through it. And looking at Jared for that long was great, the younger actor they picked was a good choice too.  I wish the photo they used for the cover didn't make it look like a mad scientist movie.  They have him in a picture looking like mel brooks...or is it Gibson?  I almost didn't pick this on my Prime to watch!!! Lucky me!  Might be too confusing for teens but if you explain the ""Butterfly Effect"" they might get it's relationship to choices...though I'm not sure it was very clear in explaining. No matter the choice it always moves us forward in time in our reality.

I thought the end was super creepy.  Imagine that being your life at the End...or was it?  Is it ever? or is it all a matter of perception as they suggest when the baby is born. Lots to think about.  I wrote a few of the ideas in my journal to think about, but it was clear early on, that there were so many interesting Ideas that I need to buy the movie.

By no means was this film at all complex or even touched base on theories of life.

I saw that someone had briefly compared it to Cloud Atlas, one of my favorite films of all time. Big difference is, Cloud Atlas really had you thinking if the choices we make in this lifetime will really affect our life in the next and even if we don't influence people on a macro level, the most important thing is we influence at least one person and that's all that matters. Mr. Nobody seemed to just slightly graze our minds. There are choices we make and there are outcomes we may never see. It's a pretty cut and dried film and did little to tickle any of my senses and didn't feel like it was relevant at all.

It's a film that tries to hard to be ""deep"". The cinematography was good, but the film itself lacked a lot of substance. There's not a lot to soak up. I watched it half way through and didn't bother to finish the rest of it. It's not as deep as some people might say it is. I personally believe it's a very shallow movie.

4651297,4,B005C4444C,"I do tend toward visually and conceptually inventive films. As many as I have seen, I was nowhere near prepared for this.

Here's the scoop. Nemo is the oldest mortal on earth and he's at death's door. Everyone else has become immortal. A journalist sneaks into Nemo's hospital room to interview him. He's puzzled because Nemo seems to be telling three different life stories. Nemo sees it as each story being valid depending on which choice he made on the day his parents separated.

This has to be the most inventive and ambitious film I've ever seen. I was hanging on by my fingernails trying to keep pace. It's filled with dazzling visuals, great dialogue and a wondrous story. I would need to see this some number of times more to see if all the pieces do, in fact, fit together. Even if they don't this ride is so wild I'd gladly board again. There are some repeating motifs. Eyes, water, vases (urns) play parts in many scenes. Life and death. Choose or not. Free will vs. predestination. It also has very inventive camera work as well. A few of the shots were a bit ""too"" but at 157 minutes (director's cut) that's easy to forgive.

The story is key though. The young boy on the train platform. Stay with dad or go with mom. If he doesn't choose all the parallel lives he leads are valid. Jared Leto does a great job. He's a different person in each life. He has a different wife in each life but the girl he lost (Juno Temple) is the obvious favorite. Sarah Polley gets second bill which is odd in that she has a woefully small amount of screen time. I's a shame because she's great in her few scenes. One scene, where she invades her daughter's birthday party, is incredible.

It also incorporates the big bang theory, string theory, expansion / contraction of the universe, and the fourth dimension we know as ""time""!  The movie is ""non-linear"" in it's telling of our main characters life story.  But you never really get to know what the real ""life story"" was.  We are presented with several alternate possibilities.  If the movie has a message, it would be that to ""not choose"" allows endless possibilities to remain on the table.  Once a choice is made, you can't go back.  We all know this, but the movie allows us to go down several ""possible"" rabbit holes.  Some are great, some not so.  But the love that our main character has for ""anna"" is undeniably, something we all hunger for, and wish we could be a part of.

4651327,4,B005C4444C,"""Mr. Nobody"" began its run on the festival circuit back in 2009 and was released on DVD and Blu-ray in Canada in late 2010. The film was finally released in theaters in the United States in November of 2013; although obviously it had a limited run. It had been nearly four years since this critics first viewing of the film, so it was in dire need of a revisit to see if it had held up over that inevitable passing of time that the film brings into question at every turn. For the most part, ""Mr. Nobody"" is still the fantastic yet abstract and surreal experience it was when it was first released.

It's quite incredible looking back at Jared Leto's acting career. The Louisiana-born actor is mostly known for his roles in ""American Psycho,"" ""Requiem for a Dream,"" and ""Lord of War"" and Leto has currently been getting a ton of awards for his performance as the AIDS-stricken drag queen Rayon in ""Dallas Buyers Club."" Leto's performance in ""Mr. Nobody"" has shades of the impeccable talent Leto puts on full display in ""Dallas Buyers Club."" Leto not only plays different versions of himself in ""Mr. Nobody,"" but the older version of himself is quite believable thanks not only to spectacular makeup effects but also because Leto is surprisingly convincing as an old man. With his trembling movements and the way his raspy vocals seem to quaver uncontrollably from just simply speaking of his extraordinary past, Leto illustrates that he's one of the most talented actors working today.

The science fiction drama by Belgian director Jaco Van Dormael has a way of making you question your existence quite literally. The film often brings in the movement of time; why does it always have to move forward? Can it be manipulated? ""Mr. Nobody"" looks at every possible decision a specific individual can make in their lifetime and how those lives are affected by every decision he or she has made. It's a lot to take in and it's even more to find yourself contemplating, but the film stays with you for that reason alone. It's practically guaranteed you'll reflect on what you've done in your lifetime once ""Mr. Nobody"" ends and what could have been if you had just taken a different path. No matter how drastic or minuscule those changes might be, your life would be forever altered because of them.

However, there are a few setbacks that stick out after seeing the film a second time; the main issue being that the duration is a bit too long. Sitting at nearly 160 minutes, ""Mr. Nobody"" does tend to drag quite a bit at times especially when such a large portion of the film is devoted to a teenage Nemo (portrayed by Toby Regbo) and his crush Anna (Juno Temple) rolling around under sheets in their underwear and chasing each other's genitals when they are practically brother and sister. Sarah Polley will also infuriate you. The Elise character cries at absolutely everything and is crippled by depression, but her griping of wondering what the problem is and being a bad parent could probably be solved by getting up and not drowning in a violent tantrum puddle of her own epiphora every time she's on screen.

Pondering your existence and realizing that not making a decision is the only decision are a few of the things ""Mr. Nobody"" touches on. You're where you are right now because of certain decisions you made in your life. But where would you be if you had lived with your dad instead of your mom growing up? Or if you married someone else? The possibilities are endless and ""Mr. Nobody"" portrays those what if scenarios flawlessly.

Complex, visually stunning, and pleasantly convoluted in an enjoyable sense, ""Mr. Nobody"" is a film that seems like it can't be confined to one genre and while time flows in one continuous direction ""Mr. Nobody"" makes it a point to constantly pedal in the opposite direction. Let your mind wander and drift into the bowels of yourself while viewing the bizarre, dreamlike, and intricate sequences of ""Mr. Nobody.""",1393200000,12,3955,4.734397677793904

4651332,4,B005C4444C,"The past. Not an entity where contemporary perceptions tend to vary. Whats done is done right? Mr. Nobody, a film by Jaco Van Dormael, explores and reimagines this notion and the theory of the Arrow of Time: the idea that time moves in only one direction.

A simplistic sketch of the films plot: By 2092 the world has moved on to become a futuristic utopia, but a dreary one. The cityscape is spotless, sterile. Sex between humans no longer exists. Obsessive organization and celebrity talk shows reign. 118 year-old Nemo Nobody, the last living mortal, the last human remnant of the old world recounts his life to a reporter.

Nemo details his past as a series of fragments. He recounts them as if he were in fact choosing them in the way that we choose our future. Its as if the past is being manipulated, riffed on, being made into a series of variations on a theme.

Why does the smoke never go back into the cigarette? Why do the molecules spread away from each other? Why does a spilled drop of ink never reform?  As the laws of entropy take the universe further and further into a state of disarray what will happen when we hit maximum entropy? When total chaos bestills nothingness?

Mr. Nobody is not exactly hot off the reels. Its a 2009 film that was on my must watch list. Despite so many awesome elements, the cinematic culmination of Mr. Nobody was rather disappointing. Mostly, the scenes tended to drag on. This was 100 minutes worth of great material stretched over the course of 155 minutes. When the film flashes back to the various paths of Nemos past, much time is spent on creating aesthetically pleasing shots. This bogs the story down. Its as if Van Dormael couldn't decide what was more important, story, or aesthetics, and so some of these long-winded scenes feel contrived, as if the aesthetics served no purpose other than themselves. Beautiful cinema is great on its own, but with a storyline as complex as Mr. Nobodys, the aesthetics should serve to support the plot and the characters, which at times, did not happen.

Overall the film is still worth the watch.

They make the DVDs available in Region 1 but I haven't seen any Blu-rays that can be played in the US. This was added to my collection of little-known movies that deeply touch me; another hidden gem of sorts. This movie can be seen as a Drama love story that jumps around a lot. You must pay attention to fully grasp what's going on. This movie is thought provoking and can make you feel like some things are left unanswered. To me, it is all about the experience and the idea rather than a start to finish story. I love the way it is put together. It is unique and refreshing. It is a deep and artistic movie about possibilities in our lives, the decisions we make and the effects. Do you realize how different your life could be if you had only changed one little thing in the past? I'm sure everyone has had those seemingly insignificant points in their lives that actually could have completely changed the course. Everything we've done in our lives, no matter how insignificant we may think it was has brought us to this moment. Emerging out of endless possibilities, each of us is very unique. For Nemo (Jared Leto) some things seem to go solely by chance while others seem like they are tied to him by fate. This movie is similar to The Butterfly Effect (2004) in that it portrays different paths through life based on decisions and tiny changes.  Other than that, the two movies are very different.

4651347,5,B005C4444C,"Superb film. Well written. Huge props to the editors. Beautifully filmed. Music was quite fitting as well.

I had to watch it twice. The first time I only focused on the characters. The second time I had to focus on the plot.

Lead actors, Diane, Jared, Juno, Toby, (Sarah, and Rhys) were a genuine pleasure to watch.

Diane was a convincing brunette with that touch of sadness that I never really saw in her other films.

I enjoyed seeing Jared as the lead in this film. I feel he raised the bar for himself as an actor.

Juno was mesmerizing to watch and listen to. She needs to be cast as the lead in more films.

Toby was catching to watch from the start. His touch on each of his character's lives always had me wanting more for him.

Sarah and Rhys were excellent. I include them in this review only because I found myself the most lost in their characters.(Perhaps because their characters were more supporting rather than leading.)

I found the soul of this (love?) story to be of what I don't ask (and answer) myself of enough; Do we truly exist? We do and we don't.  It's all up to a choice? Time. Big Bang. Expansion of the Universe.  It's all because of a cheap pair of jeans, the steam from an egg, and poor short term memory. Right? No, no. It's all about a third choice. Shabby haired and shabby clothed Jared and Diane triumph.  Maybe there should have been a fourth and fifth choice as well...

I only have one (long, wordy) question. At the end of the film, (Light house, chalk circle, park bench, hobo Jared and Diane): How do these two have this happy ending?  The only way they could have finally found each other was because 9 year old Nemo made that plot-twisting third choice.  Choice number 3 should take them both down separate paths where they do not live together as teenagers and fall in love. So they shouldn't need to find each other in the end? Yes? Maybe I missed something. Feel free to help me out on this one.

This is my first review of any film publicly. I am not a professional film critic. I thoroughly enjoyed this film enough to question it is all. Agree or disagree, all I wanted was to get my thoughts out there. Thank you for reading. :o)",1380412800,6,2183,4.355555555555555

4651349,5,B005C4444C,"As I enter my mid-thirties, my taste in movies has evolved. In the current age of reboots, sequels, prequels, superhero movies, and unrealistic/ unnecessary CGI, I now find myself gravitating towards hidden or under appreciated gems like Mr. Nobody, The Fountain, Enter the Void, etc.

At the forefront of Mr. Nobody is the question- exactly how did I get to this point in time?  The movie is great in showing various butterfly effects on our main character, Nemo, and his many parallel lives.  A leaf here, a raindrop there, all have significant repercussions on the story and lives of Nemo which unfold in a nonlinear narrative.  It is quite entertaining watching Nemo's multiple lives unfold, all with seamless transitions and editing under the watchful eye of director Jaco Van Dormael.

The steady constant in this film, is the acting- it is top notch across the board.  The children, teenagers, adults, and supporting cast all bring their A game in this movie, as this film boasts incredible performances by Jared Leto, but most notably, the two teenagers playing Nemo and his girlfriend Anna.

While heavy on emotion and substance, this movie also boasts incredible special effects used sparingly and effectively.  The level of detail put into the Future and Mars tangents will rival any big budget sci-fi blockbuster.

As each separate tangent weaved in and out of the movie, I often found myself dwelling on my own life, and how some of life's little decisions and chance occurrences helped shaped me for better or worse.  This is what I really like about a good film. I need to be entertained, but I also want to think past the content and reflect on how the story relates to me, the individual.

This is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's a true piece of art, with a story that drips with moving intense emotion, stellar acting, and visuals that hit hard just like the story. This is one of those films that during/long after will have you looking at your own life, existence, mortality, and choices in life. If there is one movie anyone has to see this year then this is it. Apparently this was one of the most expensive films in Belgium's history (60 million or so). This fact makes me think about how many current films spend far more, and are absolute garbage (A point I obviously don't have to point out, however nevertheless feel compelled to do so.). Ultimately I just hope that this amazing director (Jaco Van Dormael) has another chance, hopefully sometime very soon, to get another opportunity to let his true creative genius shine.",1367712000,,896,4.635220125786163

It's kind of like someone took ""The Jacket"", ""The Matrix"", and ""Big Fish"" and you have ""Mr. Nobody"".

She most definitely was right.

A warning to all those who like a movie to be linear with a clear beginning, middle and end-- and no jumping back and forth between these clear three parts-- if you didn't like The Fountain or didn't want to see it, then you will not like this movie.  It will be too hard for you to keep up.  If you do like movies like these that keep you on your toes, this movie is your thing.

4651366,5,B005C4444C,"Intelligent script; a rare movie that got the science based framework to the story accurate within current physics thought. Cinematography, music, attention to detail, props, models were well thought out and contributed toward understanding the storyline and not just time or visual filling substitutes. Costuming and makeup prosthetics (the aging of Nemo took 5 hours) were exceptional. CGI was not just pointless, make believe eye-candy but contributed important, and again intelligent, visuals to the story.

Consequences of random butterfly effects that occur at critical periods in one's life resulting in subsequent consequences are contrasted with conscious decisions we choose to make or not to make. The three effects (random, choice & non-choice) result in a continuum of life changing outcomes. Think of a constant branching of railroad tracks that carry our train-of-life (or think of continual coin flips guiding our decision making through out life). The film shows what happens when we make those choices and what happens when we choose to do nothing and let randomness (chance) butterfly (leaf) determine the outcome.

The movie presents us two views from our central character and his decisions: One, as an older person remembering (or perhaps imagining) the outcomes of his life's choices. Second, as a young man imagining his future lifes' outcomes.

The movie also presents us with two states of existence for those outcomes: The first is illusionary. The second, as some physicists believe, that the past, present and future do exist for all possible outcomes -  in an infinite ""number"" of parallel universes. We, as viewers, are to decide which is true or perhaps ""Every path is the right path.""

Guide: The movie shows all three choices starting when Nemo was a young man.  Who he chooses to be his love for life. To make it easy to follow each choice of love-life-path they are each color and film technique coded. Red, yellow and blue for each female, and camera angles and focus differ for each female.
A leaf in the movie is our stand-in butterfly.

Kudos to the international cooperative approach in making the film: Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, UK, Canada, USA.

My only science based disagreement is when the Universe reverses it's expansion (we are assuming a sudden disappearance of Dark Energy) that time, since it's interwoven with space, also reverses, i.e. rewinds (entropy becomes reconstructive) - not likely. My other criticism is how entertainment (e.g. movie) can be for ""Tax Shelter Investors"".",1349222400,4,2538,5.249382716049383

In an attempt to make the movie cerebral the director and author have made something utterly devoid of anything meaningful. The main character could not form a single healthy relationship - he was either too needy or too detached to actually care for another human in a healthy manner. His supposed love story with Anna left the audience completely unsatisfied, and did not develop the relationship beyond that of a fifteen-year-old infatuation. The entire movie was both predictable and utterly bizarre.

So, when you decide to make a decision a set of unchained events will undertake, but perhaps they are very related. Reality or existential fiction. In last instance, the destiny is the way you live.

Of course, there have been many others related films, in which ""The butterfly effect"" the randomness and the destiny's trickeries are extremely united. A man close to death ponders the many lives he might have led in this fantasy from director and screenwriter Jaco van Dormael. 117-year-old Nemo Nobody (Jared Leto) is ill and facing his last days as he looks back on his past and a particular crucial moment -- at the age of nine, Nemo's parents divorced, and as his mother (Natasha Little) and father (Rhys Ifans) stood on a train platform, he had to choose who he would go with, and whether he would live in the United States or Great Britain. Either choice would bring with it a wide variety of possibilities regarding the sort of life he would lead, and Nemo imagines nearly all of them, including two different wives -- sweet but emotionally blank Jeanne (Linh-Dan Pham) and lovely but troubled Elise (Sarah Polley) -- and another woman, Anna (Diane Kruger), whom he loves but can not marry. But as Nemo considers the many different paths his life could have taken, his memory begins to fail him, and he finds it increasingly difficult to be certain which was his real life and which is a product of his imagination. Mr. Nobody also stars Thomas Byrne as nine-year-old Nemo and Toby Regbo as Nemo in his teenage years.

This movie doesn't start out simple and lead up to something complex.  It plunges you right into the thick of it at the onset.  A very peculiar looking doctor with a bizarre ""head tattoo"" interviews the elderly subject, a man who we then discover is the focus of this movie, in various incarnations.  And so, we ""begin"" our journey into this life of his... there are moments from childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, in a somewhat general progression, but there's also some jumping back and forth.  It's a bit confusing at first...

Just try to remember that you can't watch this movie and try to ""understand"" it all in a conventional way.  You simply have to let it flow before you... just take it as it comes.  It's the kind of thing where you'll have a sense of what this movie is really about towards the end of it.  But ""end"" is kind of a misnomer here.  Your traditional story has a concrete beginning and ending... this has neither.  It's more of an experience than a traditional story.

I can't really say too much more about it... however, the key message that is delivered is phenomenal.  At least, I found it to be.  It's that although you will face tough choices in life, and be very indecisive about what choice or path to take, don't get caught up in that.  Make a choice.  And even if you begin to feel that the choice you made was the wrong one, think again.  There is no wrong choice.  Just different ones.  AND... we cannot know how the other choices would turn out anyway.  The most important thing is to make the most of the choices you HAVE made.  Live life to the fullest.  Do not lug around regret... for it has no benefit and is usually misguided.

4651388,2,B005C4444C,"Short Attention Span Summary:

1. We started out with a guy who was 118 years old in some futuristic universe.
2. As it goes on, we see when he was younger through flashbacks.
3. From his childhood, we follow him through three possible lives that he could have lived.
4. At some point while going through his possible lives, the movie falls apart and I honestly can't tell what happened.

First thing: This movie was over 2 hours long. More time= more places to go wrong/ lose the viewer with a very complicated topic.

Second thing: The topics were just a bit too involved. Looking on Wikipedia, it says that ""The plot also makes deep use of various scientific elements, such as the Big Bang theory, the Superstring theory, the Many-worlds interpretation and the concepts of telomeres and parallel universes."" Yes, nice, all well and good. But if you want topics that deep, then pick ONE or TWO, and develop the ideas. (But they didn't!)

Finally: This movie started out with great potential, but then just got over the top and a bit too hard to follow. (People who are physicists sometimes don't understand that *not everyone*  is a physicist and *not everyone* is on the same plane of reality as they are.)

A version of this that was done before (much better) was: ""The Butterfly Effect."" They dealt with one simple topic: Chaos Theory. It was well done and easy enough for layman to follow (unlike this film).

8464732,5,B005C4444C,"An impressive epic for fans of multiple-universe fantasy, with brilliant cinematography, sets, costumes, makeup, special effects, acting, directing and editing.  Sort of an amalgam of ""Big Fish"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" with a more science-fantasy flavor.

The story (stories) recount the life (lives) of a 118-year-old man who is the last natural, mortal human on Earth in the year 2092.  He is a curiosity in a world where everyone else is ageless, and his lingering final days of life have even drawn a viewing audience that is, basically, waiting to see him die.

Both the scientific and journalistic worlds are fascinated with the old man's memories of the past, and he is thus subjected to lengthy interviews to record whatever useful information he still possesses.

Thing is, the old man describes MULTIPLE lives with as many outcomes, including the multiple times that he died throughout his lives.  Which is more than contradictory, it's confounding to the interviewers.

We soon realize that the old man made a conscious decision (at the age of 9, when his parents divorced) to live in multiple realities, such that he could permanently stay with BOTH of his divorced parents, marry ALL the loves of his life, simultaneously enjoy wealth and suffer poverty, see society develop in diverse ways, die a variety of deaths, et cetera, et cetera, ad infinitum.

In short, the old man decided to live in every POSSIBLE reality, the essential Quantum Mechanics multiple-universe fantasy; and, at the moment of his death, he makes another profound decision...to turn back Time's Arrow and relive everything in reverse, so that all the tragedies and sorrows of his lives are undone, and he becomes truly immortal.

Is that a spoiler?  I don't think so, because there's no two-bit Amazon review that can adequately sum up or ruin this film.  You have to actually watch the movie to realize that it goes beyond a mere linear plot that can be ""spoiled""...this film is timeless.
