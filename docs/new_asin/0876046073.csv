7793293,3,0876046073,I ordered the book because it was on the list of good books by the ARE (Edgar Cayce program).  I felt that the discussion on the dvd was not very clear and at times it was scattered.  Talking about prophecys of the past but only giving a brief background on them.  It was ok but I would not recommend it.  Not very informative.,1393027200,,327,4.142857142857143
