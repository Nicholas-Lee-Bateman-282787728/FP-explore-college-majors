2993090,5,B000WZAE68,This is my favorite DVD on the sideshow and I own many of them. My bookshelf is full of books on the subject and beyond a doubt this video covers all of the topics one would hope. Great movie!,1236038400,3,192,3.948717948717949
2993091,5,B000WZAE68,"This film is so beautifully shot and its subject matter so lovingly handled, it will move you to tears. The sideshow is such an important part of our cultural heritage that, for this alone, everyone should see American Carny. Focusing on the world of the phenominally gifted Todd Robbins (and all of its inhabitants)was the single best choice Nick Basile could have made as a film maker. Mr. Robbins is the reigning master of all things carny. His humor, sophistication, and shear magnetism could make the most jaded of us easy marks for whatever he wishes to sell - however he wishes to sell it. The carnival has a rock star, and his name is Todd Robbins.",1216339200,,656,4.615384615384615
2993092,5,B000WZAE68,"This is a documentary about a form of entertainment that is disappearing from America. American Carny brings back memories of the type of  acts that I saw as a teenager at the NJ State Fair when I was growing up.
Todd Robbins is the foremost historian on the subject of Circus Sideshow acts, and is also an amazing performer.
The director Nick Basile and his crew did a great job on this film.",1199836800,7,393,4.383561643835616

I am aware that Coney Island will be closing forever soon and thought that ownership of the film will memorialize the fond memories people have of this legendary playland which includes the ""Tales"" of the sideshow that will be lost to future generations. It represents a culture of people that is little understood but which greatly impacted on the evolving entertainment media of today.  I highly recomend it.",1198195200,13,546,4.747368421052632

2993098,3,B000WZAE68,Not bad gave some great info and made you excited at first but went on way to long.  Most part is it is a one man view of carny life not a overall.  You will enjoy it but not be moved. Give it a try if you don't have to buy it.,1465257600,3,227,3.3461538461538463

His take on why he's not worthy to be called a ""freak"" is worth watching because the reasons are not what we may think.

2993101,4,B000WZAE68,American Carny is a look at Todd's  carny life splashed in with his personal life with the meeting of his lifetime hero and marriage as the highlights.

2993105,5,B000WZAE68,Interesting look at how carnival sideshow developed and those people that are carrying the tradition forward. I enjoyed watching it and learned a lot about history of it. I would recommend watching it.,1392422400,,201,5.121212121212121

2993109,5,B000WZAE68,Todd Robbins is The ultimate Sideshow performer. The movie delves into the history of Sideshow and Carny performances with a lot of history behind the acts. All in all a great movie!,1389312000,,182,4.71875
2993110,5,B000WZAE68,"This really takes you into the weird, wacky and wonderful world of a Circus Sideshow and what you think you know and expect from a sideshow is not the reality its better! Loved the journey this documentary took me on and the surprises that came with watching it. It changed my view on everyone involved in a Circus Sideshow and makes me want to go out and watch more of them when they come in town. It was freaky and fascinating and I loved it! Would recommend this to anyone who loves to be surprised, freaked out and likes to learn. It was amazing.",1377216000,,550,4.298076923076923
2993111,5,B000WZAE68,LOVED this dvd.  It is one of the best i've seen in awhile.  The main focus in on Todd Robbins & that is a great starting point because from what I've read and seen he is the past and present carny.  Great interviews.  My only complaint is there wasn't enough spent on the history of the carny world.,1376524800,,300,4.120689655172414
2993112,2,B000WZAE68,I really thought this would be more of a documentry on the history of carnivals but it's really not. It is basically interviews with one sideshow circus group in Coney Island. Some of it is interesting but not what I expected at all.,1292284800,,233,4.441860465116279
2993113,2,B000WZAE68,"I really wanted to like this documentary, as I'm fascinated by the subject matter.  Unfortunately, I found it to be very unfocused.  It seemed that the filmmaker couldn't decide if he was telling the biography of Todd Robbins, or doing a documentary about the last existing sideshow attraction on Coney Island, or the history of sideshows, or the personal stories of various sideshow performers, or the ""Sideshow School"" that Robbins is involved with.  He tried to do a little of everything, resulting in a movie with no through-line.  I got the feeling the filmmaker really fell in love with the people he interviewed and wanted to give them a lot of screen time.  As a result, there is a lot of repetition and most segments go on longer than necessary.  As an example, there's a totally pointless sequence showing Robbins riding around in a Coney Island bumper car.  Robbins is certainly an engaging performer, but puh-lease!  I rented the movie, but I got so bored I was unable to get through it in one sitting.",1244332800,3,1014,4.7542857142857144

8226162,1,B000WZAE68,"This is a freakish movie, but not in the good way. It's a sideshow that's crushingly boring. I happened to spend a great amount of time in the early '80s in Gibsonton, Fla., with sideshow figures who worked for Ward Hall, who appears a couple of times in the movie. mainly to heap praise on Todd Robbins. Hall should have been interviewed at length. As someone who ran classic sideshows, he would have had far more of substance to say. I mean, really, why do we have to go through Robbins' wedding? This isn't a bio pic, is it?

Most of the film's points are cliches, like considering  your oddity your gift. That's totally true and is what motivated my own visits to Gibsonton. But one should go deeper. And that brings up the surprising appearance of Jennifer Miller as a bearded woman. Miller is an eminent voice in queer studies. She teaches and created a ground-breaking performance group some years back. She's interviewed a good bit, but I was mystified that the filmmaker didn't ask more probing questions. Where does she place herself gender-wise? Is she trans? How does she relate to that community? Is the beard ""natural"" or the result of taking male hormones?  Is it a performative/aesthetic affectation that both singles her out and places her in the shadows? Is that a metaphor for queer identity?  I understand that those questions might be distractions, but not nearly so much as watching Robbins get married.",1513728000,,1425,4.757085020242915
