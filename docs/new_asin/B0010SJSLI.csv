8238356,4,B0010SJSLI,"When Hollywood branded her as just another overweight and unemployable star, Kirstie Alley hit back with her very own television series. FAT ACTRESS revolves around a somewhat-fictionalised Kirstie as she battles and schemes to reinvent herself in fame and in life.

FAT ACTRESS is a great show, because it features Kirstie Alley playing an alternate version of her own persona, plus a range of guest stars who aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves. Much of the dialogue was improvised, which gives a freshness to the episodes.

The main characters in FAT ACTRESS are Kirstie, her personal assistant Eddie Falcone (Bryan Callen), hairdresser Kevyn (Rachael Harris); and diet guru Quinn Taylor-Scott (Kelly Preston), who eats Kleenex tissues.

EPISODE LISTING:

""Big Butts"" - Kirstie forces her agent to set up a meeting with NBC president Jeff Zucker; and after a steamy night with one of his executives, manages to get a holding deal. Guest starring John Travolta, Jeff Zucker, Mark Curry and Michael McDonald.

""Charlie's Angels"" - Bloated to the point of violent diarrhea after swallowing a series of laxatives and caffeine, Kirstie attends a meeting with ""Charlie's Angels"" director McG.; whilst Eddie decides to stalk Carmen Electra. Guest starring Kid Rock, Edie McClurg, Carmen Electra, and Melissa Gilbert.

""Holy Lesbo, Batman!"" - Desperate to meet Gwen Stefani, Kirstie plots to intercept her regular afternoon walk, only to wind up being arrested in a gay pick-up sting. Guest starring Mayim Bialik, Kevin Nealon, and Mo Collins.

""The Koi Effect"" - After being embarrassed on the street by Leah Remini, Kirstie decides to take drastic measures in her dieting. With a new method, Kirstie surrounds herself with small people and things, and turns her mansion into ""Tiny Town"". Guest starring Mayim Bialik, Wallace Shawn, and Leah Remini.

FAT ACTRESS is a side-splitting comedy series that will be remembered for a very long time. Kirstie Alley gives a fearless performance that sees her into some very graphic and confronting material, yet she still manages to be the same loveable Kirstie that endeared her to ""Cheers"" and ""Veronica's Closet"". The supporting cast is first-rate, especially Kelly Preston as the Botox-lipped Quinn; and Mayim Bialik (TV's ""Blossom"") will surprise you with her cutting self-parody.

The DVD includes bonus audio commentaries and cast biography pages.",1202774400,,2395,5.298153034300792
