1081651,5,6305821461,"Johnny To , Lau Ching Wan, and Andy Lau did an excellent job.
Inspector Ho( Lau Ching Wan) is a police negotiator who's playing cat-and-mouse with the thief Cheung( Andy Lau). Cheung robs a hong kong high rise, but the reason why is unclear.
As Ho begins to investigate, the audience gets to know lil better too, but not too much. Cheung is doing this because his dying day is near, and he's using the time he got left to avenge for his father....
Sure, there are some plot holes, but how many HK movies can you point out with no plot holes??? especially genre like this?
however, Andy did an awesome job at playing the role of Cheung.
The style, pacing, actiong, and direction is simply great.
Andy won best actor for 19th annual Hong Kong film awards.",1029024000,5,753,4.424460431654676
1081652,5,6305821461,"i am a huge fan of HK flicks.  i love them all:...martial arts, quirky romance, and most of all heart-wrenching dramas.  this film lived up to and surpassed my expectations.  Andy Lau is a tremendous actor as is Lau Ching Wan.  these two bounce and feed off each other beautifully in this cat-and-mouse movie.  both use one another for personal gain yet when things get intense they are there to help the other out.  i was just amazed when i finished watching it.  this is definitely one to add to any person's movie collection, whether you are die-hard HK or not.  subtitles shouldn't scare you away.  trust me and see this movie.",1027296000,2,631,4.5625
1081653,4,6305821461,"Johnny To has got to be up there as one of my favourite producer/ directors- and this movie does not disappoint
Although its not one of the most realistic movies, it is quite enjoyable if you can open your mind and pretend its all possible :)
Its the story of a man, played by Andy Lau, who has *cough cough* only weeks to live due to some unspecified disease. As a result he goes on a rampage to make the most of his short term existence.
The highlights of the movie would probably be the cinematography, first and foremost...  the movie does have an interest mood. Second would probably be the rhad chick who isn't some helpless annoying chick like in most asian movies and thirdly the fact that this movie doesnt distract itself too much from the main plot.
Take that last statement how you wish. Dont expect a Wong Kar Wai movie here with a million sub-plots.
This is just a straight forward action flick.
I find it hard to relate to the characters in this movie.
And i believe its the mood which makes this one a cut above average.",1023148800,,1036,4.367875647668394
1081654,5,6305821461,"I was really impressed with this movie, the first by Johnny To I have seen. The lead characters are great and the movie has a top notch plot for cop and robber films. Though Andy Lau's character only has a few days left to live and is constantly spitting up blood, the movie is light hearted to the very end. I don't believe I have ever seen a film this action packed and suspensful without a single person being killed throughout. Even at the end, you have to wonder whether Lau's character is really going to die. Lau and Lau Ching Wan (the cop) are cool and collected the entire movie and work well on screen together. Even if you don't like subtitles, give this a shot... I think you'll like it.
The sound quality is below average, but the score was pretty good. The english subtitles were poorly translated but added to the entertainment.",987724800,,843,4.445161290322581
1081655,5,6305821461,"This movie proves that to make a suspenseful thriller does not necessarily  require a big budget and lots of explosions.  The action is centered around  a ""72-hour game"" between Andy Lau, playing a criminal with 4  weeks to live, and Lau Ching-Wan, taking the role of a crack police  negotiator.  The action cinematography is as thrilling as the interplay  between Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan is entertaining.
The picture and sound  quality of the DVD version are about average, although I was somewhat  disappointed that the Cantonese track is not quite up to par with the  Mandarin track.  For non-Chinese speakers, there are several subtitle  languages available, including English, Thai, as well as traditional and  simplified Chinese characters.
Overall, this is well-done, fun film, and  you definitely don't have to be a Hong Kong cinema buff to enjoy this one!",968112000,3,867,5.1
1081656,4,6305821461,"Dying thief Andy Lau plays a cat-and-mouse game with both crisis cop Lau Ching-Wan and a crime boss (a bald Waise Lee). While not as sharp as ""The Longest Night"" or perfect as ""The Mission,""  Johnnie To has directed another fine film. Even though Andy Lau's character  is dying, the movie's spirit is playful, for the most part. Lau Ching-Wan  is his usual sturdy self, a cop who is brighter than his superiors and  doesn't have patience for idiots.  He and Lau are well matched.  The film  only suffers in comparison with To's other recent efforts.  Recommended.",957398400,8,563,4.731958762886598

7895852,5,6305821461,"This is a great romp from Asian superstar Andy Lau, trying to avenge the death of his father by playing cat and mouse with the crime lord who helped ruin him. He also plays a fun game with one of Hong Kong's top police  detectives, making him an unwitting party to bringing down the crime lord. Don't blink or you might miss something. This is a very clever film and I live in hope of a sequel. And if you like this film, see the whole Infernal Affairs trilogy (The Departed is the American version of the first film). Lau is great in all three movies, and you can see in this film that he is working up to better things, his performance is so good.",1324425600,,649,4.150793650793651
7895853,3,6305821461,"You're a burglar, and you have 72 hours to live...what would do?  That's the premise of this action movie...I found it decent (story, acting, etc...).  Three stars!",1170374400,,164,5.037037037037037
7895854,4,6305821461,"While this film is not as good as ""Internal Affairs,"" [in my opinion], it is above average. And although it is not a brilliant film, it does deliver in that it is highly entertaining. I guess part of my rationale is that there are so many bad American action flicks, that something from the east must somehow be more palattable. Moreover, I have seen quite a number of mindless Hong Kong triad films, and this one was refreshing. [Except the great 'SPL' known as ""Kill Zone"" here in the west]. Anyway, if you're familiar with director Johnny To, then you'll know what to expect: The bad guys and the cops. In the film, (Cheung) Andy Lau, portrays a man who has only a little time left to live: due to the fact that he is dying from an incurable illness.

Therefore, to take revenge for his father, he decides to rob an insurance company. The hostage negotiator is portrayed by Inspector Ho Sheung-sang (Ching-Wan Lau). The film is a cat-and-mouse type of action/thriller, where the dying Cheung and the Inspector play a sort of game of chess with wits. Ho Sheung-sang is hot on the trail of Cheung, all the while Cheung leaves the Inspector certain types of up clues which the Inspector must follow in order to catch him. This film has been called a departure from the genre of violent triad films, and I agree. It is much more of an intelligent crime drama film than one usually sees in HK cinema. [However, these films are getting much better all the time, and are even better than American action films]

Whatever your opinions are of this film, however, it is a very clever film: With (Andy Lau) as a criminal bent on revenge of certain members of a triad, and his clever use of the Inspector in pursuit. However, he must first convince the Inspector to become a part of his crusade against these criminals. And I liked the way the film showed how Cheung must manuever the Inspector into this plan of his. This is a very clever and tautly directed film from director Johnny To. Which brings me back to the begining of my review. Compared to many of the action films here in America, this one is brilliant. It's a fun film, enjoy it, and moreover, it is well worth your time spent viewing it. I own it.",1168905600,,2205,4.4689826302729525

7895856,5,6305821461,"Running Out of Time is probably as close to a perfect film as you're ever likely to see out of Hong Kong. All the elements click: a terrific script (by French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtiaud) that even manages to subvert the odd clich?, reliably imaginative direction by Johnnie To, and excellent central performances by Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan, the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody (especially in his exasperated reactions to his superior's abysmal negotiating skills). The supporting cast is fine too, with Yo Yo Mung making a strong impression in a tiny role, and even the often histrionic Waise Lee (looking remarkably, and very aptly, like a bald Andy Lau) reining it in to good effect. It's best not to know too much about the plot going in beyond the basic set-up - with only a few weeks to live, Lau engages in a criminal game with Wan's cop with no easily apparent motive - and just sit back and enjoy the ride: it's certainly worth the fare. It also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies, and played in a mere three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of filmmaking I've seen in ages). There's also a fine score by Raymond Wong as well. The most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years.",1147046400,,1338,4.533057851239669
7895857,4,6305821461,"1999 Unrated Hong Kong crime thriller. Caution: profanity. Also known as ""Aau chin."" First in, I believe, 2 movie series.  (second one is called ""Aau Chin 2,"" or ""Running Out of Time 2"").

DVD Features: The DVD contains just the movie (which can be heard in Cantonese, Mandarin or English with or without subtitles), some commentary hidden under the ""set-up"" feature (which is also the language feature), and some trailers (three trailers for this movie (2 Hong Kong, 1 USA), a trailer for Dragon Inn (remake of classic Kung Fu movie) and one for Armageddon (supernatural thriller, not the Hollywood movie)).

Credits: Staring Andy Lau (Cheung; ""Infernal Affairs""), Lau Ching Wan (Inpector Ho Sheung-Sang; also known as Sean Lau; ""The Attractive One""), Shiu Hung Hui (Chief Inspector Wong; ""Hidden Heroes""), and Yoyo Mung (Leung Yuen Ting; ""My Crazy Mother"").  Directed by Johnny To (""Election"").  Written by Yau Nai Hoi, Laurent Courtiaud & Julien Carbon.

Plot: A criminal mastermind is told that he only has two to four weeks to live (last stages of cancer).  This criminal, Cheung, decides to go out in style and goes on a crime spree.  He battles the police and a specific police officer (Inspector Ho Sheung-Sang) who is very good at his job.

Review: Interesting music, somewhat scratchy film (might just be the DVD), dubbing is a little off, but only if you pay close attention (though it can be quite bad).  Intriguing film, we learn in the very first few moments that the criminal has nothing to lose because he is dying which adds a different layer to the normal police-criminal dynamic.

There's a neat scene where Inspector Sheung-Sang figures out that Cheung will leave the scene in a taxi, and becomes the taxi driver.  Cheung gets in the back and the Inspector drives off, toward the nearest police station.  The unarmed cop notes that the criminal won't shoot him because then the car will crash.  What does Cheung do?  He starts firing out the window of the taxi until the cop stops and Cheung flees.  I'm not sure how realistic that scenario is, but it is an interesting method (later the roles are reversed, with the cop with a gun in the back and the criminal driving, the method used this time is also good).  While the criminal plays with the police, the police fight each other (political in-fighting).

While this ""cat and mouse"" game is going on, a third criminal group is working the city.  This group's connection to the main players is hard, at first, to figure out (but it is directly tied to Cheung's actions).

The movie is somewhat tense, but it is also somewhat harder to care about the action, as the film audience already knows that the main bad guy is dying anyway.  Once again, it is harder to determine acting ability when watching a dubbed movie, though the acting seemed to be high quality.  The music is good and helps add to the tension.  The plot is interesting (what would you do if you were a criminal mastermind and know you are dying?) and solid.  There even is some humor.  Overall, I would give the movie 4.32 stars.",1117324800,4,3066,4.728813559322034

Cheung is a master of disguise one moment he can be a young handsome man, the next an elderly gentleman, then somebody else.

How will sand be able to pin down and arrest Cheung? But then again what will the inevitable be when Sang finally realises the serious illness of Cheung?

This story unlike any other cat and mouse themed story has 3 sides to it, the thriller, the action and the touching emotional side.

Andy Lau is once again fantastic along Sean Lau. The two of them worked so well together to make this a truly enjoyable movie.

The music in itself will touch the audience as it lets you feel what the characters are going through within the movie.

7895859,5,6305821461,"There's something to said for this tightly-woven Hong Kong action thriller because RUNNING OUT OF TIME tries very hard to combine the traditional buddy picture with one pinch of ""The Sting"" and a hint of ""Tootsie"" thrown in for unexpected laughs.
What makes TIME tick is the slickness of the characters: Wah only has a few weeks to live, suffering from a form of incurable cancer, and he finds himself paired with police negotiator Sang in his final act toward redemption.  Redemption, however, already has its price tag on it, as Wah's condition quickly deteriorates, and he must rely on an unlikely friendship with Sang to help make end-meet-end before meeting his Maker.
These two actors make the picture work, despite some clunky dialogue (especially clunky in the English-dubbed version, so be warned).  Their chemistry onscreen elevates TIME to higher levels of interest for the viewer as you don't know who to root for here: the cop being hustled by the shylock, or the shylock living out his last few days trying to mend life's wrongs.
Regardless of whom you root for, RUNNING OUT OF TIME is a great achievement -- a welcome twist to the cop/crook formula -- that gives you some wonderfully unexpected laughs as the story unfolds.",1072742400,12,1238,4.890476190476191
7895860,3,6305821461,"Running Out of Time
Running out of Time, is a Hong Kong action movie staring Cheung (Andy Lau) and Inspector Ho (Lau Chin Wan).
Cheung is a handsome young burglar with Terminal cancer and three days to live. Ho is a bored police officer determined to apprehend him.
Cheung, in an effort to make his last days on earth worthwhile, is determined to avenge his father's death, by stealing a large, improbably blue diamond, and framing his enemy for the deed. During the course of events, he has run-ins with police officer Ho and a beautiful woman he meets on the bus.
Regretfully most of the action consisted of scenes where the bad guys chase Ho, and scenes of Cheung crawling through air ducts, (its amazing how many person-sized air ducts there are in high security buildings), or scenes with Cheung messing with security cameras.
This movie failed for me because I kept expecting to explore Cheung's character more deeply. (If he was dying of cancer, why did he wait so long to seek revenge? Why was he so determined to frame the bad guys? What was his motivation for baiting Ho?)
So many of these questions were unanswered, and for this reason, I was left feeling unsatisfied with this movie.",1031961600,3,1195,4.668246445497631
