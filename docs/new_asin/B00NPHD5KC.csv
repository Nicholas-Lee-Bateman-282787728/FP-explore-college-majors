6675171,5,B00NPHD5KC,"WOW!! This Movie really surprised me, I was let down by the last two DC movies but this is very good from story to action.",1428019200,2,122,3.92
6675172,3,B00NPHD5KC,"Lifted from the (sorta) epic, multi-arc Court of Owls storyline, for this follow-up to Son of Batman the primary focus is upon Bruce's relationship with Damien as they both try to figure out what's what. It's CoO-lite as a lot of elements are pared down, if not eliminated, as well as a few new wrinkles tossed in. It's kinda entertaining, but also uneven.

What's Good: Always nice to hear Grey DeLisle (Griffin) in any role, and it was a pleasant surprise to see Weird Al Yankovic cast as the Dollmaker. There's some decent Easter Eggs which were pretty nice to spot and the dialogue in some moments was pretty good. Robin's struggle with his identity was interesting; he's ten years old, and yet he's not and everyone- Talia, Ra's, Bruce- is inside his head but himself.  And like every boy, he's trying to please his father, yet remains an assassin at heart.

What's Bad: Still not a fan of this animation style, and some of the scenes were just plain dumb. What city has a museum with an entire wing dedicated to... owls? One that requires a superhero to trigger a repressed memory then get attacked by owl-themed assassins and destroy the joint, that's what. And typical of these new toons, the whole thing gets wrapped up in a big ol' fight that takes far too long yet still neatly wraps up all the loose ends.

Talon's storyline with the CoO reminded me of a long ago Batman comic featuring someone called The Wrath- who was basically a poor, violent, working class version of Bruce.  Talon started out as a decent enough replacement for the Lincoln March character from the CoO story, but typical of these flicks, he only served a limited purpose- tempting Damien to the join the Court-  and it all came to a screeching, implausible halt in the finale.  The Court of Owls could've been a looming threat to Gotham that would always need attention and lay the groundwork for the Batman Family but this New 52 direction doesn't seem much for those kinds of sequels or arcs. Can't have any over-reaching storylines aside from Batman and Company, now can we?

What's Left: You wanting more. Us still waiting for Barbara Gordon/Batgirl to finally appear.

Batman vs Robin is a decent, mostly entertaining flick whose inconsistency is consistent with the new direction DC is taking them in. I wanted to like it more than I did, but it is what it is.",1427932800,9,2351,4.645783132530121
6675173,5,B00NPHD5KC,"It is a really good take on the court of owls storyline. Love the fact that they removed Lincoln March, which really was my main concern going into this movie. A few really good Easter eggs planted throughout the movie as well: looking up doll-maker bio on the bat computer you can see a certain funny villain as a known associate, the code that bats enter to hide the weapon is 1939 (debut year of bats) and Dicks background on the telephone features a certain red-haired bat-family member.

Really like the costume designs they are giving the bat family in these movies though the talons are quite weak compared to the comics.",1427846400,13,628,4.607142857142857

6675175,4,B00NPHD5KC,"4 stars for now because I love that story from the comic books. But for that person that gave 1 star because that movie was about child abuse, is not. You need to learn a little bit more of what the movie is about. Robin (Damian Wayne) was raised and trained by the league of assassins, Bruce is trying to change him. That does not mean that Batman is going to beat the hell out of his son.",1427760000,2,390,4.012820512820513

6675178,1,B00NPHD5KC,"""Batman vs. Robin""
Here is a movie about a real tough guy, much less, a super ""hero"".
One star only for this nonsense concept.
The movie opens up to Batman beating up on a bunch of kids. From there the movie moves on to several other kids being beat up by sober and drunk adults. The culminating assault happens in the end when the ten-year old Son of Batman gets a few good punches, but in the end, Batman is the better ""man"" by pummeling his own son into submission.
Even if Batman was sleeping, a soaking wet ninety-pound Robin would not win with a cowardly act like sucker punch.
It started at age nine when my dad would take me on his business trips for the bondsman company he worked for. He told me that the people we visited were not paying his boss back the money they owed him. He said the holidays were coming up and his boss had several girlfriends and even more kids to take care of. It was important that we help them out.
Most of the time when we would visit people's houses in the middle of the night, we would go in through an open window or door. My dad said the people would be more willing to help out his boss if he woke them up with a baseball bat pointed at them. If the people were angry (which was most of the time) they would start to yell, fight, shoot or run from us.
That is where I came in.
Dad, would pick me up and throw me at them. Most people did not harm someone my age, so they would stop. That would buy my dad enough to to find cover or immediately control the situation and subdue the individual. Often times, I would get hurt, but dad would always take me out for waffles afterwards at a Waffle House in the middle of the night. After a while, I started to put on quite a bit of weight from all the waffles and my dad ended up throwing out his back. That in turn, lead to my dad to start drinking heavily like an old sailor which created a whole new set of problems for another review.
Years later, I am still a little sensitive matters such as these of grown able-bodied men beating up on little children.",1427414400,9,2046,4.1175

6675205,2,B00NPHD5KC,"I give a star for voice acting and another for music and a few good fights. But overall,  a stupid movie with a hackneyed melodramatic plot like something out of H. Rider Haggard. Batman gets his caped-ass handed to him over and over. Things in the story just seem to happen for no reason. The dialogue is stilted and phony.  Characters just seem to change their minds for no reason except to change the action. There are a few good scenes. But I'm sorry I purchased it. If you're a true fan, like me, you might feel you need to see it (I have at least liked most of the DCAU stuff and loved some of it). But if so, rent it.",1488672000,8,624,4.10655737704918

6675208,4,B00NPHD5KC,"Its not easy being a single parent. Much more difficult, I imagine, when you're the spirited son of Bruce Wayne. Youd have more than a few issues and Damian, Bruces son, isn't about to let any of them drop any time soon. At odds with dad but certainly cast in his mold, Damian (who is a new Robin here), feels like hes being held back in more ways than one and when hes courted by the enigmatic assassin Talon he takes it upon himself to follow his own nose and is seduced towards his deadly potentials. This increases his antagonisms with not-so-dear old dad and so Batman finds himself not only fighting for his sons moral direction but for his life as well as Talon and the Court of Owls take a few pounds of flesh out of him. Prior Robin Dick Grayson now turned Nightwing also makes a welcome appearance and has his own difficulties babysitting/ protecting/ fighting alongside Damian.

This gritty Court of Owls storyline is definitely directed more toward an adult audience. Batman is in real peril throughout, either mortally or emotionally/ paternally, and his code of vigilante justice and belief that Gotham can be saved in this manner are epistemically challenged. The presentation and themes are going to be well over the kiddies heads. Theres a lot to appreciate here for the adult comic enthusiast. 4.5 stars.",1485302400,,1322,4.7229437229437226

6675230,3,B00NPHD5KC,"This DVD is an inventive compilation of stories created for the new 52.  The art work is stunning.  The story is gripping.  The animation is a delight to watch.  So why only give this DVD three stars?

The first problems are the gaps in the story.  I'll do my best to explain what I mean without introducing spoilers.  At one point, a helpless Batman is faced by two antagonists remaining from three assassins.  Abruptly, instead of killing him, an improbable coincidence -- a ""just in time"" event -- prevents them from doing so.  At another point, Batman is drugged and caught in a maze.  He informs his captors that he'll get out.  He always does.  And he does indeed, but how?  In the next scene he is safe in bed and regains consciousness under the concerned eyes of Alfred and Dick (Nightwing) Grayson.  There was no explanation for this miraculous event.  Did it end up on the cutting room floor because of time considerations?  If so, they should have found a way to add a minute or two to make this plausible, because it wasn't.

Even worse is the portrayal of Damien (Robin) Wayne.  Again, no spoilers.  Yes, Damien was trained by Ra's al Ghul, but so what?  He's only 10 years old.  Can any 10-year-old drag a man who looks to be 6 feet 3 inches tall and 250 pounds by a rope?  Are his fighting skills superior to Nightwing and Batman?  To judge by this movie, the answer must be ""yes"".  But it simply could not be believed.

And finally, let me warn you parents out there.  For decades, comic books have been written for adults and not children.  Until recently the animated DCU has bucked that trend and provided cartoon movies for children that an adult can watch and appreciate with his children.  (The Young Justice TV show is a prime example.)  But now, the ratings are creeping up.  This movie was PG-13.  The first time they did this, they declared it with pride.  But what is permissible in a PG-13 movie is steadily expanding.  Sadly I bought others (Justice Leauge: War for instance) that was so peppered with profanity that it decreased my enjoyment of the movie.  Call me a prude, but I I think this is deplorable.  I can't help but think many parents bought this movie for their children without realizing what the language was like.  I can hear Warner Bros now:  ""Well, we rated it PG-13, don't blame us.""  But let's be honest.  Warner Bros isn't stupid.  They know many adults aren't paying attention because they assume it's Batman and Robin and can't be that bad.  They remember comic books from their own childhood.  They have no idea.  In fact, the PG-13 rating on the box doesn't mention language at all!

And can anyone explain to me why only the ""good guys"" curse.  The ""bad guys"" are slaughtering the innocents while they attempt to take over the world, but their language is ready for Sunday School.  This move was worse than the others.  Finally, a character (thankfully a villain) took the name of Jesus in vain.  Well, at least it was a ""bad guy"".  And didn't kind of blasphemy used to rate an ""R"" rating?  Damien (heck, everyone but Alfred) is quite capable of letting a fair amount of ""purple"" language loose without a murmur from any of the adults in the room.  And remember, Damien is 10.  Is this the language you want your 10-year-old to repeat?  I think a child can be excused for deciding if Batman says it, it's OK.

The PG-13 rating mentions a ""suggestive"" scene.  And boy, was it!  Remember, this artwork is very, very good.  And while the man and woman in the bedroom scene have their ""erogenous zones"" tastefully"" unseen by well placed shadows, I ask again:  do you want your child to see this?  I was glad I previewed this movie.

To repeat, call me a prude.  I don't care.  Someone who is writing and drawing a superhero cartoon should ensure the portrayal of Batman in word and deed as someone to emulate.  Do DC and Warner Bros want children to emulate this level and profanity?  I submit that the profanity and suggestive scenes in this movie are not for children.

And the holes in the plot make it less enjoyable for adults.  I suggest you give this movie a pass.",1473379200,,4121,4.510869565217392

The story is very intriguing and the character development was very well done.,1465689600,2,314,4.526315789473684
6675255,4,B00NPHD5KC,Overall this was a pretty good movie with an action packed plot. I haven't read the comics so I don't know how it compares but I thought it was well made and easy enough to follow what was happening. I also liked getting to learn more about Batman's history and seeing him as a child through the occasional flashbacks in the movie. Seeing the relationship between Damian and his father change and develop during the movie is also fun to watch.,1465516800,,443,4.481481481481482

6675284,4,B00NPHD5KC,"I have two serious issues with this movie. For one, seeing this young kid thrash Batman is just ridiculous and way out of character for someone as purportedly trained and battle tested as the latter. That scene completely shattered my suspension of disbelief, and I had a hard time getting back on board. However, I once I did I very much enjoyed this movie. The fact that this was semi-based upon the Court of Owls story is the other issue. Had I never read the terrific Snyder story first, this movie would probably have been up a full half notch (it could never be a five star with that completely unbelievable Robin beating up Batman scene), however having read it I can safely say this was NOT a satisfactory adaptation, and in fact you could just read the story and completely forget this movie and be none the worse. BUT, taken by itself this is a very entertaining movie, and I don't have the heart to go down to three and a half stars because I had too good a time watching it overall.

6675293,2,B00NPHD5KC,I was not impressed.  This is a fairly weak entry in the DCU.  Damien is unlikable and has far too much screen time.  The plot slowly becomes boring and kind of grinds to a halt.  Batman himself is unimpressive and boring in this movie.,1455753600,3,236,4.295454545454546
6675294,4,B00NPHD5KC,"Before his overhyped mash with the Man of Steel, the Dark Knight battled his own sidekick/son in Batman Vs. Robin. This was a DC Universe animated movie which acts as a sequal to Son Of Batman, and part of the official ""New 52"" timeline which takes place post-Flashpoint.

 Bruce Wayne's newfound son Damian goes as Robin to track down some missing children that have been kidnapped by the Dollmaker(oddly voiced by Weird Al Yankovic!), but the villain is ultimately killed by a masked vigilante called Talon. Bruce and Damian's relationship becomes more estranged as Robin keeps sneaking out to fight crime on his own, while Batman investigates Talon's involvement with a mysterious organization he remembers as a child called the Court of Owls, who Bruce originally thought were the ones who killed his parents. Batman is attacked by a few of the other Talons, which are like enhanced zombie assassins that can only stay re-animated for up to a few hours, and sends for Nightwing to bring him back home. Fed up with Batman, Robin chooses to ally himself with Talon, who the main assassin of the Court of Owls, and lover of the Court's Grandmaster(aka: Bruce Wayne's current love interest). Batman goes out looking for the Court's hideout, but get caught in a labyrinth pumped full of fear gas, which is probably connected to the Scarecrow's deleted scene from Justice League: Throne Of Atlantis. Bruce is once again rescued by Nightwing and brought back to Wayne Manor, while Robin reveals his identity to the Court. Damian however refuses to join in their cause, which prompts Talon to go all blood crazy and slaughter the entire court. After the bloodbath, Talon releases all the other zombie-Talons for an all out assault on Wayne Manor. The Batman Family manages to take out all the Talon-drones, but the main Talon gets into a final battle with Batman, where Robin comes to the rescue at the last minute, but Talon decides to take his own life making Robin feel like he was the one who killed him. Bruce and his son reconnect, but Damian decides to go discover his true identity by travelling to a Himalayan monastery to work on his feng-shui.

 This worked an effective adaptation of the Court of Owls story arc from the comics, while merging it with Batman breaking in Damian as his son and the new Robin post-Son Of Batman. Most of the cast from the previous movie chapter return, with Jeremy Sisto performing a believable Talon, which the story adds a little more backstory to than was given of the character in the original comic. This animated film leads into the current third chapter, Batman: Bad Blood, that further expands the Bat-Family, but Batman Vs. Robin does make for a good enough viewing on its own too.",1455667200,,2728,4.797872340425532

I don't want to spoil it but I prefer the kind of ambiguous ending and the fact they didn't try to wrap it up in a nice little package with a bow. The father-son conflict is central to the plot and it was handled very well.

I too had a bit of a hard time believing that a 10 year old kid could do some of the stuff that Damien did but at the same time, it's fiction so I loosen my firm grasp on reality just a little bit. In the word's of my 11 year old who saw it the day after I did ""this movie is intense"".

The story, however, is a mess. I continue to be baffled by the target audience for these movies. Lots and lots of bloody violence (including our hero getting carved up multiple times) and swearing means this isn't suitable for kids under 16. Yet, there is nothing especially sophisticated about the plot that would make it appealing to adults outside of us comic nerds.

Add to that a Batman who is basically a bad parent in a way that makes him unlikable and a Nightwing who gets beat up by a kid and you jave no one to root for.

This movie suffers from the post-Frank Miller funk that DC has been in off and on with Batman for way too long. Time to take your anti-depresents folks and launch the inevitable relaunch that gives us a funner, more competent Batman",1448582400,2,869,4.487341772151899

I'm a die hard comic book reader but I always find it a must to see how they've adapted a particular story line & characters to a live action film, animated show, or full length feature. In this case I'd have to opt for the original comics its based off of. Snyder & Capullo's ""Court of Owls"" story arc is much more preferable to this. This animated movie seems like it had a rushed production too. Where in the past, these movies seemed like great care & detail was put into them before release yet Batman vs. Robin reeks of a rushed product that was slapped together quickly to hit store shelves just as fast. Its also sort of predictable in some scenes which I felt was a let down considering DC Animation's previous efforts like Wonder Woman,  Superman/Batman Apocalypse, Green Lantern: Emerald Knights, & Batman Year One have been stellar.

It's an all too familiar story for this character, now if it was a hidden elite bothering Superman or somebody, that would be something new.

I also don't like when movies like this don't tie in with other continuities, I guess this is a whole new universe to keep track of. Nothing to elude to the fact that there is a DC Universe here except Dick Grayson's cell phone with Kory's picture on it.

Also I'm sure if the writer was playing PC politics, ""Damian my ward"". I guess you can't tell your girl friend, about your bastard son if you want to get laid.

6675343,1,B00NPHD5KC,"The Damian Trilogy (""Son of Batman,"" ""Batman vs Robin,"" and the upcoming ""Batman: Bad Blood"") is some of the worst the DC Universe Animated Original Movie series has to offer. ""Batman vs Robin"" has cringe-worthy dialog and ruins an iconic and universally praised comic story (Scott Snyder's ""Court of Owls"") with needless and idiotic changes, such as removing the entire Wayne mystery, focusing on Robin instead of Bruce himself or the history of Gotham, and completely cutting out the rest of the Bat Family (Red Hood, Red Robin, Batgirl, and others were also supposed to fight the Owls in the original comic). Damian is an excellent Robin and interesting character in the Batman & Robin comics that this series is attempting to adapt, but in the movies he comes off as obnoxious and moronic, completely losing all character development he went through in the previous movie ""Son of Batman"" just so they could have a ""controversial"" title/fight in ""Batman vs Robin."" The DCUAOM series has some great films out there, such as ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and the new ""Justice League: Gods & Monsters."" The Damian Trilogy is not among those great films.

I think you pretty much have to be a Batman fan to buy or rent this otherwise why would you even be watching it?

6675394,4,B00NPHD5KC,"*spoilers
Used some of the Amazon video credits I had to rent this movie before bed. I really enjoyed most part of the movie and the animation is amazing. The only thing that mostly bugged me from what I remember is how Bruce is basically provoking his son's rage and frustration and thinking fighting crime for justice is the way to go. Plus it really bugged me when he just let him go and live his own life. He's still a young boy no matter how mature he acts. He hardly helped his own son out during this movie and thought it'd be best if he gave up on him until he's ready to come back on his own. I don't know, I just think the writers kind of forced Bruce to have a son.",1436140800,,676,4.014814814814815

6675399,4,B00NPHD5KC,"This film has the worst title ever.  It is misleading and does no justice to a pretty interesting story line.  Robin is nowhere near as annoying as he was in the Son of Batman, which was terrible.  Here is he simply unrealistic.  A 10 year old kid who belongs on the Mortal Kombat roster.  Yeah, right.  Pretty ridiculous.  But once you get over that fact, this movie is a lot of fun to watch.

Bloody, adult, and filled with intense action scenes and weird enemies.  The movie sort of rewrites Batman's history a bit with the Court of Owls idea--a bunch of rich people who think they should decide what's good for us all.  Kind of like the American government, just better dressed.

Again we see that Batman and Robin argue over the use of force--where it should end.  With death or capture?  Of course, Bats is afraid of becoming evil, so he never kills.  Thus proving once again how inferior to the Punisher Batman will always be.

That said, this movie has its fair share of violence and blood.  The bad guys get it good, but our heroes come VERY close to death as well.  It's an intense and suspenseful ride that Batman fans will appreciate.",1435795200,,1146,4.458937198067633

6675401,5,B00NPHD5KC,"Just finished watching; along with Jeff H., ""Batman vs Robin"" released by Warner Brothers.
Damien Wayne is not easily adjusting to carrying the mantle of Robin - The Boy Wonder.
Damien is chaffing under the strict rules imposed by his father Bruce Wayne/Batman.  He is the grandson of a master assassin and mercy and self-restraint isn't a part of his core DNA - or so he keeps telling himself.  He's spoiled and willful, yet he does want his father's approval.
So when Damien figures out who is behind a series of child abductions in Gotham City; he rushes to criminal's hideout with Batman just a minute or two behind him - Damien did steal the Batman mobile to rush to the children's aid.
At an abandoned toy factory, Robin/Damien encounters another masked figure calling himself Talon.
Talon is a member of the Court of Owls - a frightful bedtime story Bruce remembers his father telling him. Only it turns out the bedtime story has a sinister ring of truth, and if Bruce wants to halt their plans for Gotham, he must also save his son.
Epic Batman mythos with lush animation.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

I'd read it so I knew the storyline, but I enjoyed every piece of the way this was put together. Definitely recommended if you, too, are a ridiculous Batman fan.",1435017600,,380,4.7727272727272725
6675410,3,B00NPHD5KC,"I liked the story but I honestly don't like Damian Wayne, he's too arrogant, and they over estimate this child's strength which takes away from the ""Suspension of disbelief"" in my opinion.  I did like that his character seems more aware of his arrogance and he's making some effort to figure that out, so that did make him more tolerable than he was in Son of Batman and this could lead to him becoming a more interesting character in the future but right now he's just a punk (with potential).  By the way, I don't think the Damian Wayne story line (Son of Batman and Batman vs Robin) is good for small children, a lot of violence, sexual situations, and brutal murders, like peoples heart's being ripped out, so I'd watch it yourself before deciding on whether or not to show any children.  This movie is OK, but most of the other DC features I like better than the Damien Wayne stories which may change as his character evolves, we'll see.",1434931200,,942,4.497076023391813

6675413,5,B00NPHD5KC,this was a great dc universe animated movie. i did not read the court of owls story but it was very interesting to see it played out in the movie. i thought the talon character was interesting as an anti hero. and seeing him try to sway damian was kinda neat. i do love that we are getting any dc movies but kinda would wish they would do some more original stuff and please stay away from the new 52. yikes what a mess.,1434758400,,420,4.011904761904762
6675414,1,B00NPHD5KC,"Damian is nothing more than a full on effort by DC Comics to rope in children viewers. He is the DC equivalent of the purpose Jar Jar Binks was meant to serve for the Star Wars universe in the Phantom Menace, and I find him every bit as annoying.  This little brat can somehow beat Batman and Nightwing?! So DC is willing to sacrifice their most valuable character assets on some ridiculous bet that Damian is going to drive the future of DC Comics?!  Good luck with that!  As for me? I hated and resented the notion of this movie so much that I went into my Amazon account and deleted this purchase from my library. Yeah, I wasted $19.99, but I feel like watching this movie has a far steeper cost than its monetary value. I will never watch another DC Batman movie that stars this little runt even if it's a one second appearance on the screen!

6675417,2,B00NPHD5KC,"I'm really surprised at all the positivity for the last few animated Batman films.  I've seen a lot of animated Batman everything and these last few have been abysmal at best.

They're well animated sure, and I love the more adult themes and level of violence sure.  But Robin is so poorly cast and acted, as well as Batman, that when Kevin Conroy is brought in as a character, it feels like a slap in the face.  And don't tell me that Batman's voice actor is alright, when you could easily get the guy who did the Young Justice series. That Batman voice is phenomenal.  And getting a kid to voice Robin is just a mistake.  He's not at all believable to be the mature killer he's raised to be in the comics.

And speaking of the comics.  This movie straight up BUTCHERED the Court of the Owls comic story.  True, it's a BIG story to cover, but when you steal scenes from the comic, but make up some stupid antagonist and terrible excuse to have Robin fight Batman.

Also, the fight between the two? That is the dumbest possible idea I've ever heard to be the title or theme to one of these movies.  Even just physically, Damian can't compete with Bruce.  Yes he might take some cheap shots because he was trained to kill, but his whole dilemma was that he couldn't kill anymore. Plot holes much?

This is just an overall terrible movie.  There are some cools moments and nods, but it just *in my opinion* fails spectacularly, and does an incredible disservice to the comic it's supposed to be based on, and arguably Kevin Conroy's Batman.  Shame.",1434672000,,1546,4.451957295373665

6675494,2,B00NPHD5KC,"I am always excited to see the latest DC Animated film and after an underwhelming start to 2015 with Justice League: Throne of Atlantis, I would have thought that the next film would make up for it. Batman VS. Robin is now my most disliked in the whole library.

As a sequel to Son of Batman, which was a decent film I was expecting a rich story about the relationship of Batman & Robin, the history of the Court of Owls and of course a fantastic story featuring one of the biggest fan favorites in DC Comics today, Talon. This film tried to do that but, didn't do it well at all. Even though voices from the first film did return including Stuart Allen, Sean Maher & Jason O'Mara it felt that because this film has so many faults even their performances were average at best. The animation was also very glitchy and made me feel as if the movie was rushed. These films are known for some of the best action sequences and the ones in this film didn't impress me in the slightest. The true nail in the coffin is how Warner Bros. even scaled back, no longer making 2 Disc special edition DVDs. Physical media is not going away no matter what the mainstream says. Don't trust the cloud because if it gets hacked you will lose everything and you will not get it back for free.

I hope that Warner Bros. redeems itself in regards to this product. I may not be getting 2 Disc edition DVDs anymore but, with the next film showcasing the return of Bruce Timm, the classic DCAU animation and the first original story in this library one can only hope that this film project gets back on track in a hurry.",1433462400,,1595,4.3133333333333335

Regardless you will enjoy this movie the storyline and the interaction between characters in the Batman team was great (Bruce, Alfred, Damien & Dick).

6675541,1,B00NPHD5KC,"Fans of the original Batman animated series will be completely disappointed. I was.

Some of the other 1-star review titles get straight to the point, very accurately:

BATMAN THE PUNCHING BAG - How does the world's greatest detective get so beat up and still command any respect?  It was rare to see THE BATMAN that came out of the shadows get his butt kicked. When things went south, we knew he was only human, and being the calculating logical genius that has taken on SUPERMAN AND WON, he usually has multiple exit strategies already in place.

DISAPPOINTING STORY - The cause for the rift between batman and his 2-dimensional brat son (no offense to all the pacific palisades brats that don't know how to kill people... yet) is off character for THE BATMAN. The batman I knew was brooding, silent, appearing out of nowhere, emotionally distant, always observing the smallest detail, but this thrift store bamtan (new name I gave him) gets all bent out of shape, failing to stand back and analyze the murder scene and de-deuce (take the turds out of the brain farts the writers were having) that Robin's footprints never suggested that he either jumped up, did a somersault over the doll dude, and dug his heart out in one skillful stroke. Or that robin wasn't at the proper height to make such a clean, effortless incision to cut out the guy's heart, unless robin was using his assassin levitation meditation technique (or was it hover boots?). It's the little details that make or break the realism. It's like we're mixing the campy corny fight scenes of the 60's batman with the gritty over-the-top ultraviolence of a clockwork orange. Did stanley kubrick call it or what?

YOU'RE CREATING THE DROOGS OF TOMORROW'S DYSTOPIA!

Just because the avengers movie made dumb-trucks of money (they're bigger than dump trucks) doesn't mean their storyline of ""AND THEN LOTS OF UNSMART VIOLENCE THINGS CAME A LOT FROM SOMEWHERE MAYBE UNDERGROUND OR SPACE AND THEY DIED BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF THEM SO THEY WERE STILL HURTY""

6675643,5,B00NPHD5KC,"Brutally awesome. The animation is great; the story is a great mix between the Court of the Owls and the generation gap between Damian and Bruce Wayne. Having Bruce's first son around as well added a great dynamic to the story. The only down side I would have in this story is I would have made Damian a bit taller. It is pretty hard to take some as a serious killing machine when they don't come past your knees. Yes Damian is supposed to be 10 year old, but he is as tall as a 5 year old. Aside from that everything else about this DVD is excellent.

The action in this DVD is Mortal Kombat level brutal. Having the Talons (who are essentially ninja zombies) Batman does not need to worry about his rule against killing and it show perfect how brutally deadly Batman can be when if he uses lethal force.

The story line is a mix between the Court of the Owls, and the Wrath story where any enemy of Batman tries to recruit Damian to his way of thinking by appealing to insecurities about Bruce trusting him and always preaching restrain and trying to control him. As Damian is the main character in this they do not dwell on Batman's heroic escapes from the court.

The little thing. It is usually the little touches that make the difference between a great movie and good movie, here are some example of the little touches in this movie. Bruce and Damian have a very strong family resemblance in their features. In the parts of the story where they show young Bruce they might as well have used Damian. Things like even when they are fighting seemingly without restraint, Bruce does what any father would do shielding Damian with his own body. A look at the future Batman (666) was a nice touch as well, and a great resolution and turning point in the father and son dynamic. On a personal not having Damian shutting Dick Grayson's mouth was a bonus for me particularly.

This is a great movie, as much as I did not like Damian in the comics I have the say the animated movie version of him is growing on me. I even felt sorry for him in some scenes where Bruce was being his hard@$$ self of a father. I also like the fact that Damian doe give as good as he get when it comes to comebacks and physical blows. This is probably not a movie to watch with the kids, it definitely lives up the 13+ age rating.",1431475200,,2307,4.296551724137931
6675644,5,B00NPHD5KC,Love all of Batman animated movies.  This one top the chart by far for this one.  BvsS might have a hard time topping this one!!!,1431475200,2,129,4.12
6675645,4,B00NPHD5KC,"I really enjoyed this but If your looking for the comic adaptation you will be disappointed yet not really. This is action packed with a good storyline. The movie goes deep into the court of owls and gives talon an origin. If your big into comics you sometimes get pass art styles and continue reading anyways right!?, same here. I got pass some of the animation and focused on the movie instead. Can't expect dc to use the same style in every movie nor recreat a full movie in it's  entirety mirroring the graphic novel/ comic runs.

Respect and cherish the classics they gave us but be open minded and look at these as ""What If"" variations instead of recreated comics on film, You appreciate it more. Scott Snyder & Greg Capullo killed the comics but personally this movie was still fresh and exciting.

The movie starts off very dark and robin still has the attitude we love. Fighting scene are on point from damian vs nightwing, to the assassins to batman, very nicely done. Seeing alfred let off a shoty and the batman trasher suit in action is exciting.

Forca advocate Batman fan you have nothing to loss adding this to your dc animated collection. It's no dark knight returns, under the redhood or year one but you will like this on a rainy day. - 4/5",1431388800,,1259,4.508771929824562

All of that said, the required suspension of disbelief was just too much.  I don't care how well trained a 10 yr old kid is, he's still a 10 year old kid and there is absolutely NO WAY he could hold his own in a fight with Nightwing, much less Batman.  Speaking of Batman, I am not sure I have seen a weaker version since 'The Superfriends'.

6675671,2,B00NPHD5KC,"I try to imagine how I would have felt about this movie when I was 16. I think that even then I would be rolling my eyes at it. There is this realization that our generation took the superheroes with us. To be honest, I often enjoy this as I find that the stories are exciting to me now. But this... this feels like a 16 year old wrote it who was so enthralled by acting ""mature"", which of course is anything but. I remember when DC comics tagged the phrase, ""not just for kids"". This movie goes out of its way to drive home the point ""not for kids at all"". But to what gain? You have a brief scene with psychotic abused children straight out of a horror film. You have Nightwing talking on the phone with a lady friend getting turned on talking about her lacy lingerie and her thong. Really? I mean, how juvenile is that? The thing is, these details have nothing to do with what the story is about. It would be one thing if this was a grindhouse flik. But here they're just there to send us a little message, something like ""look at me, I've the movie that's not for your kids"". This is something that moments had been thrown into the previous DC Animated movies, like an unneeded curse word here that felt planted and unnatural, but those were just distractions in otherwise solid movies.

I want to like this movie more considering how much affection I have for the Grant Morrison and the early Snyder Batman stories and for the character of Damian Wayne. But this movie isn't for me. It's not for my kids. I don't know who this movie is for. Maybe stoner boys between the age of 12 and 15. Hopefully by the time that you're 16 you're not still giggling hearing Nightwing talk about a thong. This is the weakest DC Animated movie that I've seen so far.",1431129600,6,1755,4.286144578313253
6675672,3,B00NPHD5KC,"The general idea is interesting but the writing (or condensing of the comic story to fit a movie format) nearly brings this one to its knees.  Characters will say or do things without being prompted because the story demands that they do something or reach some leap of logic to push the plot forward.  It very much felt like a first draft script.

Personally for me this one was on the verge of being simply bad.  Which is part of a steady drop in the quality of these Batman movies.  I probably would have been harder in my review if I had paid full price but I got it half off so that made it gone down better.",1431129600,3,613,4.161016949152542

6675774,4,B00NPHD5KC,"I'll warn fans of Scott Synder's ""Court of Owls"" comic arc right now that this is not an adaptation of that storyline. The story takes more from Peter Tomasi's ""Born to Kill"" storyline, with the Court of Owls/Talon replacing the main villain (Nobody/Morgan Ducard) in Born to Kill. I had guessed this from the sneak peek of the film and was ready with that knowledge when I watched the movie.

Where this film succeeds most is in the character development between Bruce and Damian, something that Son of Batman sorely lacked. The fight choreography is truly stellar, possibly some of the best I have seen in a DC animated movie.

I disliked how confrontational they made Damian be with his father - in the source material, even though the two have had their disagreements, Damian has never betrayed Bruce and is not willing to do so, nor has he rejected Bruce as his father. In Born to Kill he seems to do a similar betrayal, however it is a ruse from the beginning. To see him do the opposite in Court of Owls felt like a slight betrayal of his character.

I think the film would have worked better had they decided to do a stricter adaptation of Born to Kill and not involved the Court of Owls, but overall the film pulls it off with what it had to work with.

I was somewhat let down by the ending, which felt a little like a step backwards in Bruce and Damian's relationship, but in the context of Bruce and Damian's developing relationship early on, it could make sense.

Overall, a good film to watch, but I recommend reading Born to Kill to get some good context.",1430438400,,1570,4.456445993031359

But I have to say I didn't like the first ""son of batman"" because well...how do I put this...there is no damn way. That is how I describe the plot of that movie and this one. Because for real; batman THE flipping batman and the first robin, the best version of robin BOTH getting their butts handed to them by a 80lbs brat? I don't care if he was trained by assassins it is impossible for a ten year old to inflict that type of damage on a adult barehanded that goes double for batman and dick they are both martial arts masters the Damien robin is just too unbelievable to take seriously. Not to mention his un-ending one liners make my skin crawl. One of the reasons I love DC movies is because there is always a type of believability to them and the characters are well thought out, defined and written. But these last few movies I'd say starting with JL's war are just too busy, they have too many characters, they don't take the time to tell the story and they try to re-write known characters and it isn't working out well. Compared to crisis on two worlds, flashpoint paradox, and even doom. This movie is nothing, the action parts where classic and I love that they are taking more story lines from the comics but the Damien robin AND the court of owls in one movie? Every time one half of the story would even try to get interesting the momentum was killed by the other sub plot. It's like trying to walk in a dress with a extra long train sewn to the front of it instead of the back, you would like to walk up the stairs but you keep busting your ass because you keep stepping on the train. Not to mention this movie suffers from Michael bay-isms I guess that they thought if their was enough shocking fights and one liners that it would draw people in but not this batman fan girl.",1430265600,76,1965,4.2287234042553195

6675811,4,B00NPHD5KC,"DC Comics and Warner Bros. Animation bring fans of the Dark Knight his latest adventure Batman vs. Robin. Writer J. M. DeMatteis does an incredible job blending together Grant Morrisons Batman & Robin: Batman vs. Robin and Scott Snyders Batman: The Court of Owls graphic novels into one action-packed thrill ride through the darkness of Gotham City. It doesnt hurt that the ever angry and charismatic Damien Wayne and his strained relationship with his father Bruce are parts of the main focus of the story.

In Batman vs. Robin, Damian Wayne has a hard time accepting his father's no-killing rule. He soon starts to believe his destiny lies within a secret society. The Son of Batman finds himself the target of a vigilante calling himself Talon. The mysterious man wants Damian to take his place as the lead assassin of the enigmatic Court of Owls.

I loved the way filmmakers incorporated parts of Damien: Son of Batman into Batman vs. Robin. Theres a small dream (or nightmare?) sequence where Batman finds himself face to face with a grown-up Damien who dresses in a new version of the cape and cowl. A touching showdown between the two ensues which addresses the Dark Knights insecurities about the way hes raising his offspring.

Batman vs. Robin is rated PG-13 for intense action and violence, suggestive images and thematic elements. There are some instances where dark silhouettes cover up nude bodies in the context of insinuated adult situations. For all intents and purposes, think of Batman vs. Robin as having the same content as The Dark Knight Rises, but as a cartoon.

There are a few special features exclusive to the Blu-ray edition of Batman vs. Robin. They include two featurettes entitled Gotham Citys Secret: The Mythic Court of Owls and The Talons of the Owls. Audio commentary for the movie is found as well. We get four bonus cartoons from the DC Comics Vault from Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Young Justice, and others. It also contains a sneak peek at the DC Universes next animated feature Justice League: Gods and Monsters.

Batman vs. Robin is a worthy follow-up to Son of Batman. I love the character of Damian Wayne and feel theres a lot more they could do with the character in further animated features. Might I suggest an animated adaptation of the Damien: Son of Batman graphic novel? The explosive relationship between Bruce and Damien is something that will not only find teens being able to associate with it, but fathers who struggle with their rebellious and independent-minded sons as well.",1430092800,,2537,4.877030162412993

I gave this movie 5 stars because it is definitely worthy of it.  The animation is Fantastic, the story telling is pretty nice, and the plot was excellent.  The characters and voice actors were top notch in this one.
Yes I prefer Kevin Conroy as Batman for sure, although Jason Omara has a nice voice it seems to be not for Batman. lol anyway, the movie itself is not for children at all! I mean at all!  Dc is almost alienating the younger audience, which I realize is a fine line but some things are over the top. That said this movie is still a 5.
I. like most others prefer the pre Jay Oliva movie style from DC.  the movies released under him have also been great fro sure, but lack alot heart the Bruce Timm features had.

This is a sequel to Son of Batman and thankfully much better.  The voice cast is the same and they do a passable job.  I feel like a little soul is missing from the newer DC animated offerings.  This has that same problem but the core concept is enough to keep you watching.

One thing I found off putting is Batman's introduction.  He bursts into a warehouse and begins beating up children.  Mentally abused and mutilated kids that Doll Marker has tortured.  Batman eventually knocks them out with gas but that's after kicking the crap out of them.  It just didn't sit right with me.  Neither did the fight with Robin.  I know it's in the comics, and maybe it works there, but seeing Batman kick, punch, and throw 10 year olds around bothers me.

I'm also tired of seeing his parents get shot which they show twice in this film.  A minor gripe but it's been done in every possible medium, even Lego, at this point.  In this movie we get to see Batman himself shooting his parents so points for creativity I guess.

Anyway this one won't win any awards but it's not as bad as the last few DCAU films.  The NU52 overhaul has had mixed results for me so far.  If you've felt the same way as I you might want to give this one a chance.",1429833600,7,1358,4.258823529411765

6675842,4,B00NPHD5KC,"This movie is a sequel to the 2014 DC Comics Original Animated Film ""Son of Batman"" which I like ok but didn't love.  I think this is a much better movie, the story centers around the Court of Owls which were the main protagonist in the New 52 Reboot of the Batman comic books.  It isn't a direct adaptation of the Court of the Owls story but certainly borrows a lot from it and there are certain scenes that are pulled right from the books.  The Court of the Owls is a really fun new villain and I really enjoyed what the did with them in this movie.

The animation is also fantastic along with the voice acting and score.  I definitely recommend but probably not for smaller children as its pretty violent and there is a lot of blood.  12-13 is probably ok but I don't know about younger than that.",1429660800,,800,4.230263157894737

Very entertaining, (in my opinion without giving too much away) I like the fact that the hero/s  never really got the upper hand on the villain (injuries taken into consideration). However, I don't think NightWing was given his ""props"". He was not given the proper respect for the level of his abilities and skills. So was this Batman vs the Owl or Batman vs the Talon. . .

Some highlights were Jeremy Sisto's portrayal of Talon, Alfred getting to be a bad-ass, and some great action sequences.

I would have preferred it had they stuck closer to the ""Court of Owls"" storyline from the comics as some of the visuals and back-story of the Court and Talon were missed or skipped.  If they'd left out the Damian drama and focused on the horror/suspense of the source material, we'd have gotten a much creepier, and deeper movie.",1429488000,,592,4.59047619047619

The only real difference is that Owls like to kill their prey while Batman does not. Damian must choose between being the assassin he was trained to be or becoming Batman's son.

The cartoon was 79 minutes long. There was a lot of fighting as expected. I still miss the ""Pows"" but concede its time has past. This film included a lot of Batman flashbacks and questions vigilante justice as being no better than the criminals, but not too hard.

There were also many stabbings, quite a few impalings, characters getting blown up, beating hearts getting ripped out of chests, etc...  It's obvious the DC animated people think graphic violence is a substitute for developed characters, cogent storytelling, and satisfying payoffs.  At one point in the movie a character gets impaled in about 15 different spots, and he is literally bandaged up and fighting bad guys less than 2 minutes later (in essentially a contiguous scene timewise).  What?  Nothing in the movie made sense, if you think about it for more than five seconds.  The motivations of the characters were contrived, phony...flat out false really.  They obviously wrote the movie with a start in mind and an end in mind, and whatever happened to take the characters from one to the other didn't matter, so long as we got some crazy violence mixed in.  All the big moments were unearned, almost as bad as the Aquaman movie recently (but not quite).

6675979,5,B00NPHD5KC,"BATMAN VS ROBIN is a real surprise, particularly given its title.  Variety critic Brian Lowry, in his review of April 14, 2015, sums it up best: theres nothing even particularly subtle about titling Warner Bros. Animations latest Blu-Ray release BATMAN VS ROBIN.  Still, beyond the obvious marketing benefits, the movie more than holds up, offering another deep dive into Dark Knight loreDark, eerie and more than violent enough to earn its PG-13 rating, beyond vague echoes of Batman Begins the story not only charts the battle for the soul of Damian (Stuart Allan) but also revisits Batmans origins...after releasing a few subpar projects this represents a laudable return to form for Warner Bros., whose direct-to-DVD animation  peaking with the two-part The Dark Knight Returns  has generally been a cut above. That encompasses everything from the topnotch casting to the quality of the animation.

As Lowry states in his review, BATMAN VS ROBIN truly is the best piece of cinema to emerge from the DC Universe Original Movie line since the two-part The Dark Knight Returns, and the daring Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox.

BATMAN VS ROBIN is a vast improvement over its predecessor Son of Batman. Its a film laced with complex themes about fathers and sons, family and parents, all richly explored through its screenplay by J. M. DeMatteis that utilizes both solid dialogue and the construction of a linear narrative interspersed with key character flashback backstories.  Its pacing and style is a melding of todays DC Universe Original Movies with the first animated film the division produced, 1993s theatrical release Batman: Mask of the Phantasm.

The cast delivers solid, at times powerful performances for Voice Director Andrea Romano.  The film is another jewel in the crown of director Jay Oliva.  His choices in the areas of character design, art direction, action choreography, lighting, color pallets, and occasional soft focus (Bruce Waynes childhood flashbacks) combine to give this film a look unlike any he has directed before.

However, Grant Morrison fans looking for adherence to his Batman vs Robin storyline from Batman and Robin, other arcs from his tenure writing that series, or his classic tale of Damian Waynes fate in issue eight of Batman, Inc. are going to be sorely disappointed.

Likewise, fans of Scott Snyders The Court of Owls saga from the New 52 Batman series may be in for more heartbreak than excitement once elements from that 12-issue arc begin appearing in the film.  While panels and sequences from that series are recreated in the film, The Court of Owls storyline has been adapted by BATMAN VS ROBIN screenwriter J. M. DeMatteis in the creation of a screenplay that leans hard toward original.

In speaking with www.nerdrepository.com at WonderCon 2015, DeMatteis was asked This film is loosely adapting the Court of Owls storyline from the comics, which has already become a very iconic story. Which elements were important to make sure they were included? DeMatteis response was indicative of the goals both he, the producers and director Jay Oliva had for the film: What you said about loosely adapting is the key, because were not doing a strict adaptation. In fact, were building an entirely different story out of it. By setting out not to do a strict adaptation, we were free to pick and choose from the mythology. The Court of Owls is a really cool concept  what can we do with that?  Theres a few really great scenes in there that we decided to use for the movie, but were not bound by any of it. It became the foundation, and on that foundation we built a new story.

He was more direct on the WonderCon 2015 Panel as quoted on www.comicbookresources.com when he stated, What we did was, we took elements that we liked from Court of Owls -- really, the mythology and certain figures -- then certain elements from some other Batman stories. What we did with those was, it sort of became a foundation that we built a whole new story on.""

The key to DeMatteis approach to the film can be found in his final answer to www.nerdrepository.com at Wonder Con 2015: More than anything, its a Batman and Damian story. Its the story of a guy as ill equipped to be a father as anyone on earth, and a kid whose really as ill equipped to be a son as anybody on earth, trying and struggling not just to find each other  but to decide if they even want to find each other. Its a wonderful little dance that these characters go through.

Director Jay Oliva echoed DeMatteis thematic interests in the film at Wonder Con 2015 on www.comicbookresources.com when he stated, ""We've seen Batman before -- he kicks ass and takes names and we love him for thatI think it was a great idea to introduce Damian into this storyline. We've never seen father Bruce Wayne.""

The goals of the filmmakers are fully realized throughout the entire film, on a variety of levels: overt and subtle emotion; philosophical and intellectual debate; and, at times, visually symbolism.  At one point, after battling over rooftops, Batman and Robin fall through a glass skylight into a huge, enclosed cemetery.  They land atop a grave marker, a huge marble depiction of an ancient Roman family  a father, mother and son.  Their impact shatters the head off the father.  A second later, were left to wonder if Robin has smashed Batmans head in as he thrusts a sharp, broken tree branch down against his fathers head, and Oliva cuts to the headless statue, doves flying out the open, broken skylight.

Symbolism carries over into the elements the filmmakers have lifted from the Court of Owls storyline  from young Bruce Waynes flashbacks to Batmans hallucinations upon facing the court.  All are molded to fit the films themes of parents lost, children abandoned, grief suppressed, and guilt exploding.

With the characters dominating the scenes including Alfred, Dick Greyson/Nightwing, and the villain from the series Court of Owls molded into a new character equally damaged by the same conflicts that haunt Damien, every type of scene  whether it be dramatic, action or exposition  explores the thematic elements sub textually or overtly, given the tonal need at the exact moment during the films running time to strike the right balance.  This is the most personally emotional Batman animated feature since Batman: Under the Red Hood.  While it doesnt achieve the greatness that one did, it comes damn close.

With the addition of another outstanding DC Universe Original Movie score by Frederik Wiedmann, a dramatic action packed climax, and a rare hope filled coda for a Batman film, BATMAN VS ROBIN exceeds its title and utilizes popular Batman storylines and mythos to form a great piece of cinema.  DC Animation can only hope fans of the material can look beyond their understandable desire for faithful adaptations of it and appreciate this great film for what it is, and not what it isnt.",1429056000,21,6921,4.915807560137457

6675982,4,B00NPHD5KC,"At this point, I am about 3 years deep into a childhood favorite of mine: reading comic books. I became disabled 10 years ago, and my injuries ended my career as a professional freelance illustrator. Emotionally and mentally, I deal with the loss a tad bit better, but for years I would not talk about art, look at anything artistic &  because I could not enjoy my own abilities, to smile at the works of others was just too tough for me. Surprisingly, my father-in-law has a comic collection that is jaw-dropping, and when started pulling out some of his comics, they immediately became therapeutic for me in ways that I marvelled at.

So when DC introduced the New 52, as a child, I had Batman EVER-REE-THANG! I even remember being hospitalized with asthma, with this huge oxygen tent that surrounded my hospital bed. My grandmother bought me a Superman puzzle, and I pitched a fit in that bed! Why? Because it wasn't Batman. Of course she went and exchanged it and all  was well afterwards. Ultimately, though, I stopped looking at comics when I started drawing portraits. I could not marry comic art with the realism that portrait work required, and it did not bother me at all. However, when I considered looking at Batman, in terms of comic books, since there were so many titles to choose from, I said,  ""Forget it,""  as I did not know which were worth the money and the time, so I dismissed them all.

I think Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo were 5 or 6 issues in when I read a review online, and that prompted me to buy that particular issue. Once I got it, I. Was. HOOKED! I  scrambled to get all the back issues, and around this time, I learned about subscriptions for comics and I joined Impulse Creations, out of Tulsa, OK. Even the side issues with the Bat family, I collected them all.  Because the story was sooooooooooo GREAT!, I am taking issue with Batman vs Robin.

This animation does a decent job of including elements from the storyline, but it fails horribly with the pacing Snyder and Capullo established within Batman. I suppose that neither movies nor animations ever follow every single point when these films are made, and sometimes it works. In this instance, it left me barely grinning. Scott Snyder's writing is exceptional, but the way Greg Capullo designed the artwork, especially when you had to turn the pages upside down to read and to view Batman when he was captured by the Court of Owls, those moments should have been capitalized and heavily highlighted in this film. The confusion Batman felt while going through the labyrinth the Court had set up and used for years to torture countless others before him, there was no reason to leave those moments out.

And if the extensions of Batman; Batgirl, Nightwing, etc., and even Jarvis Pennyworth, Alfred's father, who also had a story to tell about the Court of Owls, had they been included, there was more than enough material to make a feature film with. If parts of the storyline needed to be elaborated on, DC should have consulted with the sources that both wrote and illustrated the comics, and we the audience would have benefited from it. This is the first film directed by Jay Oliva that left me shaking my head, and not in a good way. I am by no means disappointed that I purchased this, I'll surely watch it again. It does, however, give me reason to pause before adding the next film to my collection. I rate this, as Ed McMahon would have said, ""Batman vs  Robin receives, 3 and a half stars."" But I rounded the score up rather than downgrading it, simply because of the interviews from the Special Features. Hearing the internal tinkerings of the creators was top notch.

Once you have watched it, be sure to check out the Special Features: Gotham City's Secret: The Mythic Court of Owls, and The Talons of the Owls. Hearing the perspectives of Snyder, Capullo, and others, are quite enriching to the lore of Gotham City and to Batman himself. So many images from the comic books are used in the background as they told their thoughts in creating this story, and for me, it really re-emphasized & fortified the feelings I had during the film and after the credits rolled: this could have and should have been done better. There is a fear you can feel for Batman while reading the comic books that the film did not even slightly reproduce, and I think it is due to DC trying to stay within a certain lineage with Bruce and Damian Wayne. For this film, it easily could have stood alone on its own, and should not have been confined to what DC is attempting to establish with the father/son narrative. That has its place, but the original story gets bloody, confusing, down and dirty, gritty to its end.

We were robbed of too much of those angles & aspects.

6675983,4,B00NPHD5KC,"Like Son of Batman this does mix and match some of the recent Batman comics.
My biggest issue was more with the fact they made Damian the 2nd Robin, as mentioned in my review of Son of Batman.
Some people have complained about Robin ""winning"" in a show down against Batman. These people are, frankly, missing the whole point of the story and Batman/Bruce's character. Yes, Robin ""wins"" but only because Batman is a better person and pretty much refuses to fight Damian (which any normal fan would expect from Batman). Like any teenager who ""beats"" their mentor in a fight, Damian assumes he won by getting the upper hand, which was very much not the case.
Overall, it was well done. Loose ends, but that's OK.",1428969600,,709,4.590551181102362

It is not quite in the territory of "" Batman Under the Red Hood"", but pretty damn close. The story is credible and the action top- notch. It has a few plot twists to keep the audience engaged. It is worth a buy and I'm happy to have it my collection. Now, if only the artwork in ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns ""was as good, it too would be a pleasure to watch (as the story, plot and action is pretty darn good).",1428969600,4,522,4.127450980392157

I REALLY did, because Damian Wayne is one of my favorite characters, and Dick Grayson, my all-time favorite DC character, has more than just a passing role.  However, the movie is SO devoid of reason, the continuity is SO bad, and the characterization is SO off-the-mark that I only watched it to the end merely to see how the movie makers attempted to wrap it all up (very messily and laughably, as it turns out).  The ONLY reason that I give it three stars AT ALL is the willingness of DC to focus on the ""Robin"" characters, such as Damian and Dick (even though they gave him BROWN eyes (have they ever even SEEN a comic with Dick Grayson in it?!)).

6676011,5,B00NPHD5KC,"Potential spoilers, watch out!

The successor to Son of Batman, Batman Vs. Robin, in a few short words, is amazing, gripping and downright fun. It's the story of a secret society (Court of Owls) that tries to take control of Gotham by manipulating young Damian (Robin) against his father. Damian is caught between two opposing forces: His father's vision of him and that of Ra's Al Ghul, who still influences him and for which the mysterious Talon figure tries to take advantage of this fact over him.

The art, music and voices in this movie are nothing less than outstanding. The movie doesn't shy away at all from having gruesome, even terrifying scenes and quickly can switch over to more exotic and beautiful settings while maintaining a Gotham-like atmosphere: Fear, depression, corruption, darkness and a slimmer of hope all at the same time.

For the casual and hardcore alike, this is a definite must-see for all Batman fans who enjoy quality storytelling with over-the-top acting, music and animation. For me, it's impossible to fault this new addition to the DC movies in anyway - simply blown away. Some, though, do point out that the Court of Owls story here wasn't given justice, so for more definitely read the comics.",1428710400,48,1233,4.889952153110048

6676017,5,B00NPHD5KC,I think we are being a bit harsh on these guys. They are doing these projects continually better with the exact same budget and only 75% of the the crew.

Instead of making a Court of Owls animated film, DC has decided to market yet another film with Batman in it to exploit your wallet.",1428537600,,393,4.458333333333333
6676019,3,B00NPHD5KC,"Meh. Better than the last couple of DC animated movies, but still not good. The whole Court of Owls story was cut up and watered down so much it seems a waste to even include it. And Damian Wayne is just annoying more than anything else. The dialog is terrible, alternating between long runs of exposition and on the nose self identity statement by the characters. Seriously, who is this supposed to be for? It has the script of a Saturday morning cartoon (remember those?) but is also a little too disturbingly violent for little kids.

The Al Yankovic part was actually great, though. I think I would have rather seen a whole movie about just that opening bit.

Three stars only because the last two have been worse. Here's hoping the Bruce Timm outing will be better.",1428451200,7,770,4.572463768115942

6676021,4,B00NPHD5KC,"I didn't really have a lot of expectations going into watching this film, but I was pleasantly surprised in how much I liked it. The animation looks just as good as ever. That is something I will always praise DC with when it comes to their straight to video animated movies. The character development of Damian Wayne was really nice to see. He still has trouble from time to time because of the way he was raised, and it's nice to see that go back and fourth between father and son. The Court of Owls story line was here, but at the same time it wasn't. It took moments from the story, but it's not completely about that. Personally I didn't mind that, but for all of you Court of Owl lovers, you may be disappointed. Again the story was okay, the choreography was awesome, character development was good. Only thing I didn't really like was the fact that Nightwing had to be there, because well...he doesn't do much. But that is all I'm going to say about that:D

Pros:
-Story was okay
-Choreography was awesome
Character development was good

Nightwing's role (Didn't do much for the film at ALL)",1428451200,2,1105,4.492537313432836

6676026,2,B00NPHD5KC,"Very disappointed. The focus is the story of the Court of Owls which have a long history with the Wayne family. This animated film pretty much took that story and didn't even really take the best dramatized bits just the fluff.
The focus of the story is Bruce's relationship problems in his son Damion and Damion not being allowed to make his own choices in life, only those that his father, mother and Raz AlGhul have chucked at him since a baby. Only with that we also get the shallow storyline of the Court of Owls who while were terrifying and gruesome in the comic are nothing but cannon fodder in this.

Again, DC's animation department took a good storyline and just trashed it. I love the new 52, but if you're gonna make a animated film based on any material from the comics, keep it straight or come up with something completely original.",1428192000,5,848,4.5064935064935066
6676027,4,B00NPHD5KC,"So another DC animated flick that doesn't live up to the expectations I set for it. After Jay Olivas amazing abilities with his adaptation of Frank Millers ""Dark Knight Returns"" I thought the man could do no wrong. I guess I set the bar too high for him because this film did not live up to the hype.

Without spoilers;
The plot revolves around a shortened watered down version of Snyders ""Court of Owls"" Storyline and honestly could have been spread into two movies of its own. Instead of a well rounded well told story we receive a half baked cookie cutter version of the actual storyline. Another big issue for me is Damian and Bruces relationship. While I have read hundreds of Batman comics and understand Damian is still in his ""Hit girl"" stage, I just don't like him. Or more personally maybe the choice of voice actor behind him. Still DC has a few movies left for me to decide how I feel on the animated version of Damian as his current carnation by Morrison and continued by Peter Tomasi is one of my favorite comic book characters of all time.

Don't be fooled by my 4 star review. This movie just barely barely made it to the 4 star mark. While is was a entertaining flick somethings seemed too rushed and such a epic storylines as ""Court of Owls"" should not be watered down to a mere 85 minutes (thats with credits).

8679681,4,B00NPHD5KC,"DC keeps making great superhero movies.  This particular series, focusing heavily of Damian Wayne's Robin is super.  Robin in particular is just about perfect in all aspects, character, animation and voice acting.  The story line is pretty good and mostly true to the comics.  It is definitely not a kids movie, with some very violent moments.
The negatives in this movie are Batman and Nightwing.  They aren't bad, but not really true to their essence.  Batman is portrayed as pretty slender, youngish man with an oddly bull-terrier like face.  Seriously, what's up with the close set ice.  His extremely gruff demeanor with Robin makes a lot of sense though.
Nightwing is very underutilized and is a throwaway character.  In other movies in this series, he is portrayed as one of the best fighters in the league, very close to Batman in ability, as he is in the comics.  But just about anyone beats him in this movie.  Robin and Nightwing are matched up fairly well, but a 30 year old Robin is beaten unconscious by a 10 year old Robin?
He is particularly purely used in his fight with Talon.  He poses no threat at all, and is beaten extremely easily.  Batman pretty much owns Talon, however, as does Robin.

Alfred had lost the signal and had no way to know that Batman was in trouble let alone send Nightwing to go save him.
