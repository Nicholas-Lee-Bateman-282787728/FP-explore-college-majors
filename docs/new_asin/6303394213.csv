638283,4,6303394213,"MAN IN THE SADDLE (1951) is a very fine little Western, directed by the underrated director Andre De Toth, with a fine screenplay written by Kenneth Gamet. Despite the formulaic story line, the film never drags or dawdles. Randy Scott illustrates, once again, all the fine acting characteristics that made him one of the top ranking ""Western"" actors of all time. Alexander Knox, an interesting choice for the villain, adds much to the story. Other members of the cast, including Alfonso Bedoya and John Russell, round out this solid oater, well worth investigating. Finally, the title song is sung by none other than ""Tennessee Ernie Ford,"" and remains in the memory long after the movie's images are gone....",1123977600,5,709,5.016949152542373
638284,2,6303394213,"Scott, working with Andre de Toth, who worked with him in Stranger Wore A Gun, finds himself in a film that does not stack up against the Budd Boetticher Western he made around the same period.

Scott plays a rancher in a range war against a bigger, powerful rancher, who has married the woman Scott loves. Scott tries to refrain from violence, but when the other rancher hires gunmen to kill Scott, Scott has to defend himself.

Westerns often feature a plot that has been done many times before, but are distinguished by great writing, great action, and great performances, and this film features none of these things. It is great that this film has been released on DVD, but it will not be remembered as one of Scott's better films.",1121904000,6,735,4.603053435114504
638285,4,6303394213,"The Western is such a man's genre, with women merely prizes to be won, signifiers of domesticity and civilisation or pretexts for action.  The Western is a testing ground for men to be men.  But some of the more adventurous Westerns are really about sex, and relations between the sexes, only pretending to be concerned with generic violence.  Some take it even further, and suggest that brutalities supposedly committed over the love of a good woman, are merely the sublimations of a homosexual desire that can never EVER be spoken about in such a context.
Compared to 'Johnny Guitar', 'The Man In The Saddle' isn't very camp, but it has its moments.  That title for a start: along with the song that explicates it, sung over the crepuscular silhouette of a man alone, it sounds like the kind of elegy to existential solitude we would expect from a Randolph Scott film, especially one of those made with Budd Boetticher a few years later.  But when the song is finished, we see that it's not about Scott at all; he's sitting comfortably in a communal situation listening with pleasure.  Far from suggesting absurdist masculine self-sufficiency, the title refers to male sexual potency, about who's in control in the sexual game, 'in the saddle' (there is a lot of by-play with hats, a favourite phallic signifier as 'Miller's Crossing' attests).  The plot is supposed to be about struggles for land, but the real sources of conflict in the film are two women over whom various combinations of men fight.  Female sexuality is inscribed on the land - De Toth's compositions emphasise, ahem, triangular shapes, while the film's most extended scrape over a woman takes place in a natural hideout, with forests and gushing waterfall - the only mark of civilisation, a makeshift house, collapses under the pressure.  Prowess with guns takes on a different kind of meaning in this context, with the impotent landowner hiring expert gunslingers to do his shooting for him.
The suggestion that this deferral of sexuality onto the plane of action masks yet another displacement, that of homosexuality, is implied by some extraordinary stand-offs in which suppressed feelings and eye contact play a part, and the fact that women, usually accessories in the genre, are forced to take on the male role in order to revert things to normality.  This upturning of generic conventions is heightened by de Toth's typically extraordinary and idiosyncratic direction which subjects the mise-en-scene of each frame and the staging of each set-piece to enormous internal pressure, emphasising artifice (the grouping of characters in space; the 'framing' of characters in doorways and windows; the intrusion in the frame of extraneous elements, such as the twigs that create a frame in the fistfight mentioned above; the use of music to commentate on the action; the use of lighting, which is constantly pushed towards silhouette or chiaroscuro, obscuring the clarity of the narrative action, pushing it into the abstract and formal (and reminding us that de Toth would make one of the great horror films, 'House Of Wax', a couple of years later)).
This doesn't mean that the illusion of the action is destroyed - the last third is brilliantly, excitingly choreographed, but even here, the tumbleweed-bouncing, dusty, stormy weather is belied by the clear blue skies whose monumental, sculptural quality was earlier responsible for some extraordinary compositions of the natural world.",1020816000,7,3463,5.102473498233215

638362,4,6303394213,"The more I see of Randolph Scott, the more I like him.  By 1950 or so (this was made in 1951) he stood next to only John Wayne as the star that the public most identified with quality westerns - and Scott actually made a lot more westerns in the postwar period than Wayne did, despite retiring in 1962.  Many of them were quickie ""B"" pictures, and so unsurprisingly they haven't been as well-known as Wayne's stuff, or for that matter the westerns of James Stewart, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, etc.  But the release last year of the phenomenal Budd Boetticher set seems to be helping to change the critical views on Scott and his work, particularly the material he had more control over (often as a producer, as in the case of this film) in his last active decade.

Andr De Toth, a director who like Anthony Mann was equally adept in noir and western environments, manages to set out Kenneth Garnet's screenplay (based on an Ernest Haycox novel) of a complex love-pentagle against the background of feuding ranchers slickly and with a surprising amount of subtlety and grace given the 87-minute running time.  Scott is small-time rancher Owen Merritt, in love with tough girl Laurie Bidwell (Joan Leslie) who has decided to get ahead in the world by marrying the big cheese cowman in the area, Will Isham (Alexander Knox).  As Merritt is rejected by Laurie and tries to come to terms with it he's attended in his sorrows by even smaller-time rancher Nan Melotte (Ellen Drew), who has no interest in bigwigs - or in the half-crazed Hugh Clagg (John Russell), a brooding cowboy who wants her no matter what.

Complicating the various personal feelings are Isham's intense greed; buying out the ranch between his property and Merritt's isn't enough for him, and he decides to push Owen off by force - and murder - if need be.  Soon Merritt is an outlaw after a couple of exachanges of gunfire with Isham's men leave cowhands dead on both sides, and this  serves to turn off Laurie - though by the time she seems about to go back to Will, things have started to percolate between him and Nan.  Clagg the loner decides to go after the wounded Merritt when he finds out that Nan is taking care of him, and this leads to a truly spectacular and lengthy fistfight between Scott and Russell (or their stunt doubles) as they demolish a cabin and fight their way down a hundred yards or so of snowy, rocky mountainside.

Eventually things come to a head between the two main adversaries and the resolution is as you might expect - with the major point of interest being in the reactions of the women, who both show far more complexity and self-assurance than you'd typically expect.  I particularly liked that Laurie's priorities and feelings remained divided and unsure all the way up until the ending, and that she makes what may be a wrong - but very understandable - choice.

Terrific music by George Duning that occasionally seems to be reaching towards a screechy atonality, solid Technicolor photography by Charles Lawton Jr, and excellent usage of the Alabama Hills that figure so predominantly in the later Boetticher/Scott westerns.  This is probably my favorite Scott western between Fritz Lang's WESTERN UNION (1941) and Boetticher's SEVEN MEN FROM NOW (1956) at the moment - though I've still got an awful lot of films to see.  Even the title song - sung onscreen by Tennessee Ernie Ford - ain't bad.",1263168000,4,3407,4.7025210084033615

638364,4,6303394213,"MAN IN THE SADDLE was the first of six westerns that Hungarian director Andre de Toth made with veteran western star Randolph Scott. No quite up to Scott's later collaboration with Bud Boetticher, which commenced in 1956 with the marvellous SEVEN MEN FROM NOW. Nevertheless, MAN IN THE SADDLE is a very worthy contribution to the genre. This film also marked the first teaming of producer Harry Joe Brown, with Randolph Scott as associate producer and was known as a SCOTT-BROWN PRODUCTION.

The story was from a novel of the same name by Ernest Haycox. Owen Merritt (Scott) had lost his sweetheart Laurie (Joan Leslie) to local cattle baron Will Isham (Alexander Knox) Isham tries to buy out all the local ranchers by fair means or foul. Merritt resists being drawn into a fight for Laurie or over Isham's land grabbing venture fearing that it will be taken for sour grapes. Plenty of action on the way to the final showdown with Scott assisted by his ranch hands and close-neighbour Nan Melotte (Ellen Drew). The film is memorable for its wonderful night-time photography and a marvellous extended fight in a mountain shack between Merritt and Hugh Clagg (John Russell), which really did ""bring the house down"".

Randolph Scott's acting range is limited, but he has screen presence. It takes him the whole movie to realize that he loves another woman (Ellen Drew), but you can't help wondering what took him so long.

Action scenes are somewhat long and repetitive with chases and fights. There's also another character (John Russell) who seems like the same jealous character as the rich man (Alexander Knox).",1517184000,,596,4.776699029126213
