8438218,5,B004QJOE3K,Simply the best.  Larry Payne is an amazing instructor and a yoga therapist.  His slow and steady approach is a safe and smart way to do yoga. I have purchased all of his DVDs  and recommend them all highly.,1496275200,,207,4.256410256410256
8438219,5,B004QJOE3K,"I always watch all my DVD's before doing them. I got this DVD because I have some minor to medium neck pain from being rear ended several times throughout my adult life.  I often get headaches upon waking if my neck ain't positioned just right! I have over 350 fitness DVD's and 40 of these are yoga DVD's, mostly beginner & beginner intermediate. I have already fallen in love with this DVD, very calming and easy to do. I will be using this one several nights a week after a hot relaxing shower and just before bed to relax my neck area. It includes many of the exercises I performed while in Physical Therapy after those car accidents in my past! I Iove Larry Payne and I totally respect his expertise in the area of yoga for physical therapy!",1483142400,,746,4.366906474820144
8438220,2,B004QJOE3K,"Too short, he spoke too fast and there weren't enough positions in my opinion. Sad I spent my money on this. I know it's not a guarantee, but I was hoping it would help a little with my pain and headaches.",1480550400,,205,4.024390243902439
8438221,5,B004QJOE3K,"I've taken a lot of yoga classes over the years and bought a lot of yoga DVD's along the way too. Larry Payne's Prime of Life Yoga Series is THE best I've ever tried.

The Upper Back and Neck Problems DVD is one I've recommended to friends and they've been happy that I did.

The Beginner's DVD is perfect for anyone who has never practised yoga before or who is getting back to yoga after an extended break.

 I now use the Immune Booster Level One on an almost daily basis and love it. After a break from practising yoga on  a regular basis, this was a wonderful way to ease back into my practise. After only a few weeks, I have regained the ""ground"" I lost and have started to progress again too.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

8438222,2,B004QJOE3K,"This one wasn't very beginner friendly.  Also, the production values looked amateurish not giving much confidence in the the program offered.",1361836800,2,141,5.714285714285714
8438223,5,B004QJOE3K,"I am SO glad I bought this DVD!  I have had chronic neck pain and sick headaches for about 15 years now. It was really limiting my life and interfering with work, too. Not good! I now use this DVD about every other day, if not more often, and BOY has it made a difference. It's not over-the-top new-agey, but very calming and informative and helps you feel like YOU can control your pain and stress, rather than being at its mercy. Absolutely worth every penny, and I've recommended it to several friends. I'm surprised there aren't more rave reviews about this FABULOUS DVD.",1344902400,4,575,4.528846153846154
8438224,5,B004QJOE3K,"If you have neck/shoulder problems this DVD is great! It is easy to follow with a focus on breath, pace, stretching. I would say this is a beginner level but if you are having bad neck/shoulder problems it's exactly what you want. I've tried other DVDs and this has been the best. I like it so much I just bought a few more of his DVDs!",1331683200,3,336,4.106060606060606
