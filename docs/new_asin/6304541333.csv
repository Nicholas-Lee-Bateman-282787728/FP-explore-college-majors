911753,4,6304541333,"For anyone who has watched the the swan princess movies and knows there is three movies total the way this movie is describede you may be mislead to believe it is a new movie, but the truth is that Swan Princess: Secret of the Castle is a dvd version of The Swan Princess II - Escape From Castle Mountain the sequal to the first movie which came out straight to vhs in 1997. The have simplely changed the name and the description a little bit. The new title fits the movie better then the old one. The movie is a good one and has some good music in it. As far as sequals go it is a good one.",1251417600,20,591,3.9747899159663866
911754,1,6304541333,"How DARE the makers of The Swan Princess spoil a perfectly good movie! The songs are cheap. The animation is terrible, and sloppy! The colors are very dull, and remind me of 1980's cartoons. The villain is so cheap. He is worthless! All I can say is that I hate this movie, and I do not reccomend that you buy it.",1224720000,,313,4.147540983606557
911755,1,6304541333,"I have to say, the last time that I watched the Swan Princess I was about seven, and I loved it - I liked Odette, though I hated her name, I liked Derek, though again, I thought his parents were probably having issues when they named THAT kid, and i even liked the story - and I was a PICKY kid. Not knowing the Swan Lake was a story in it's own right, with the same characters adn damn near the same plot, I couldn't even deplore the lack of originality displayed.

  But this! Oh no!

  Heaven forbid Disney come up with a sequel that is, oh, you know, GOOD. And trust me, I've watched them all. (hey, I do have a little cousin...) Mulan II - heaven help me. Aladdin II - heaven help you. Swan Princess II - heaven help the person who wrote it. Cos God knows, no one else should. I mean, quite frankly, the story line is so bad, they might as well leave the writing to Tchaikovsky. And he's dead.

  Or whoever it was who wrote 'Swan Lake'.

  Which is very good.

  Hey, i'll give THAT a good review...",1113436800,3,1005,4.082051282051282

912000,5,6304541333,My little 18 month old girl loves these movies. She dances along with the songs and loves the colors in the movie. We love them because it keeps her occupied. Not only that but they have some humor in there for an older audience that is withing reason.

912004,5,6304541333,I absolutely love the Swan Princess movies. I really wish they would release anniversary editions like they do with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. Course I guess the reason they don't is because she isn't one of the official disney princesses. It's still a really good series though.,1384041600,,297,4.8431372549019605

7875784,1,6304541333,Unfortunately the R1 release is pan scan so about a third of movie is chopped off. The movie was filmed in 1.85:1 and had a limited theatrical release then straight to video. Way to go Sony in 2009 - give us the copyright warnings in widescreen but present the movie in 1990s pan scan. Pathetic. There is a foreign release in 1.78:1 so those that do like this movie might want to search Amazon UK. [...],1472169600,,403,4.315789473684211
