5658501,5,B00BNESEVE,"As a huge fan of Journey and now of Arnel Pineda I was looking forward to watching the back story of his journey no pun intended.

5658504,5,B00BNESEVE,Every old school journey fan that doesn't think Journey is as good without Steve Perry needs to see this.  Arnel Pineda is a freak of nature with his voice and stamina.  I've enjoyed seeing him live.  He revived Journey in a way nobody else could This story is well worth the watch!!,1500336000,,283,4.403846153846154

5658513,5,B00BNESEVE,"The iconic music of JOURNEY lives on in the gift of Arnel Pineda. This documentary showcases the exhaustive search for a voice to continue the legacy that the legendary frontman Steve Perry originated. A herculean task, given that Steve Perry has the penultimate range and power vocals that anchored JOURNEY in their decades of global musical dominance and superstardom.

The search produces videos downloaded from an internet cafe in Manila, Philippines by a fan of Arnel Pineda who meticulously and patiently spent hours posting performances of this yet unknown singer to You Tube performing the Journey hits. When you close your eyes and hear the videos, one can't believe it is not Steve Perry, the clarity and range are uncanny. Neal Schon watched these You Tube videos and the unbelievable fairy tale commences.

The rest is music history. Arnel Pineda embraces the passion and transcends to the heights of his predecessor. He steps into the role of the great Steve Perry and fulfills his lifelong dream. Journey is again complete. This movie is pure joy.

Arnel Pineda is a Star who has not forgotten his roots. A humble and gifted talent that has found his path and risen to achieve his place in the pantheon of legendary frontmen. Congratulations!",1482883200,2,1256,5.0

5658516,5,B00BNESEVE,"Loved the movie.  Tells a great story and really gives you an inside look at how the rock band Journey made a triumphant comeback.

You really got to know Arnel in this documentary.  He is a warm, kind humble man who cares deeply for his family.  You see his struggle, as he's torn between his family and his passion, yet he takes every opportunity to be with and talk with his family.

I've been a fan of Journey since the late 70s, when their music dominated the air waves and American Top 40 countdown.  There are some who say they will are never the same with Steve and all the back and forth controversy that comes with it.

Here's what I say:  Thank you to the Journey team for giving Arnel a chance.  Thank you, Arnel, for making it possible to still see Journey in concert and carrying on the music and legacy.

This movie is like a modern day ""Rocky"" movie, except the fighter is a man with a dream to be in a rock band and the heavy weight title is being made the lead singer.  If you are Journey fan, you owe it to yourself to see the movie.  Arnel is an amazing humble man, a loving husband and father and he's earned my respect.",1481587200,3,1141,4.18348623853211

5658536,4,B00BNESEVE,"My only knock is it's more a documentary than music, still cool background look at the ""new"" Journey. It's all about keeping their music alive.  I'm just happy they're  still playing music not just who's in the band.",1463097600,,216,4.657894736842105
5658537,5,B00BNESEVE,"I'm a Journey fan.  I've seen them twice with Arnel, but didn't know his story until I stumbled across this documentary about a year ago.  I've rented it a few time to show people Arnel's amazing story.  Every single person who has watched this with me has told me that they weren't expecting much from this documentary.  But they were truly touched and moved not only by Arnel's story, but also by all the other members' stories.  They all say that they liked Journey before seeing this doc.  But they are really, really fans now!

You come away from this understanding that, yes, they are rockstars.  BUT, they are super human beings as well!  I have a new respect for every single one of the members of Journey.  And I cannot wait until they come back to Austin for a concert.  Because everyone I've shown this film to will join me in the front row!",1462838400,3,852,4.432258064516129

5658546,5,B00BNESEVE,"The absolutely AMAZING story of Arnel Pineda, the new lead singer for JOURNEY. Arnel takes you to the Fillipines where he grew up in poverty. He sang anywhere for whatever money he could earn. He was spotted on Youtube by Neal Schon, and as they say - ""the rest is history"". If you are a JOURNEY fan this is a MUST VIEW and if you aren't a fan, this might change your mind.

Having had the opportunity to sit front row at a JOURNEY concert with Arnel performing, I will tell you he generates more energy, sings beautifully and totally inspiring!",1454803200,,545,4.396039603960396

5658548,5,B00BNESEVE,"It was great to see Journey, back on top in fine form form! I listened to them when I was a teen, & Arnel sounds just like Steve Perry(too bad both of them couldn't come together ,to sing!) Perry had one of those voices you never forget, & Arnel has been ""gifted"", w/ that voice! Too bad
it didn't have a little of Perry singing in concert ot video.",1454630400,,349,4.072463768115942
5658549,5,B00BNESEVE,"I don't think Arnel is on the level that Steve was on, but he is fantastic.  I was skeptical when I heard his singing, however I have not got to hear him in concert.  After watching this movie I have a bigger respect for him, as he says ""I am not Steve Perry!  but I would not be here without him.""  He is very  humble and works hard to  perform with the band.  Even their manager, in this film, says He a full member....and doesn't even know it yet.  I am a little biased when watching this film, I was a Journey fan since elementary school, but I think anyone who likes a feel good movie would like this.",1451260800,,606,4.033613445378151
5658550,3,B00BNESEVE,"As a huge Journey fan I wasn't sure what to expect from this DVD. It was ok as a one off view - will I watch it again? - probably not.  Great story, but lacks on performances for me - Even the brilliant Dont Stop is only OK at the end. It is a documentry  - how many of those do you watch twice?",1450569600,,295,3.59375

5658557,5,B00BNESEVE,Nice story and how to lesson on how to find a new lead singer for a band. I spent some time in the Philippines and enjoyed meeting the locals and learning the language. The film was well balanced between showing Arnel's homeland and his new life with Journey. Better produced in story and directing than many other documentaries that I've seen.,1444867200,,344,4.655737704918033

5658572,5,B00BNESEVE,"If you believe that Journey isn't Journey without Steve Perry, you need to watch this.  Even if you don't have that particular belief & are just a Journey fan, you need to watch this.  If the only Journey song you're familiar with is ""Don't Stop Believing"", you need to watch this.  Arnel Pineda is an unbelievable singer with a huge voice & a high energy stage presence that will make you a believer in a band being able to survive and evolve beyond one member.  His life story is truly a Cinderella story.  And now that he has made it big with one of the most successful rock bands in the world, he is giving back to other poor street children in Manilla, where his story began.  How Neil Schon found the guy is a story unto itself.  This is a fabulous documentary/concert film!",1432425600,5,780,4.375

5658584,5,B00BNESEVE,"The best music-related doc I've ever seen. Arnel's story is absolutely great & you get to see what the guys in Journey are really like. Neal Schon seems to me to be a really great guy as well as an awesome musician. Jonathon Cain seems a very focused, dedicated and knowledgeable mentor who cares about his band and friends. This group seems as tight in supporting one another in every way as they sound when playing their music.  You get a picture of life on the road with one of the world's most popular bands and find it's hectic, draining, and draining, but you can see the life energy flowing into them when they get on that stage. Their faces show that the reason they are so good is that they truly love the performances, and they truly appreciate their fans. Definitely a wonderful story!",1425254400,3,796,4.489655172413793

However, after the loss of Steve Perry, I really didn't pay much attention to what they were doing. I figured Journey was finished. Wow...was I ever wrong! This was a very insightful documentary and well done. Arnel Pineda is the best. This video makes you very happy that he made it, after years and years of hard work. It's wonderful that Journey found a gifted singer who could actually give Journey a new future. The story is a real tear jerker and Pineda is charming and humble. It's an incredible rags to riches story. It also shows what terrific people the other members of Journey are. I was really impressed by what a gifted and versatile singer Arnel Pineda really is. It makes me want to see Journey on stage again. I hope other Journey fans will give Pineda  a chance. By all means see this movie, before you prejudge. Perry is 65 now. He can't do what this younger gifted singer can do anymore,unfortunately.",1420243200,2,1070,4.515463917525773

5658598,5,B00BNESEVE,"I recently saw this video on PBS and had to come here to purchase the DVD. I watched with a lump in my throat the whole time. First and foremost, Arnels voice is amazing!  Steve Perry, the original lead singer of Journey is one of the finest tenors in Rock, and Arnel simply nails his soaring highs and power. Yes he sounds a lot like Perry, but he also has a bit of distinction all his own. He presents each song close enough to release the nostalgia for the songs we all know and love, yet he brings his own joy and expression. This kid can Sing! and it did it originally with very little vocal training. There were no voice coaches or singing teachers in the slums of Manilla.  Pure, raw talent.
Second, I couldn't stop cheering for the underdog, the kid who came from nothing, almost lost it all, and then, by the sheer force of will and luck, was discovered - like a diamond in the rough. Third, I was really moved by the dedication and honesty of Neal Schon, believing he could find a singer worthy of journey by trolling the internet to give some guy a chance. These guys are brothers of the heart! Neal Schon (and the band) needs a dynamic lead singer to keep HIS dreams of a ""journey"" rebirth, and Arnel needs someone like Schon to find him and make his dreams come true. Amazing...they find each other via Youtube, which is everyman's concert stage. And Schon never gave up on this kid, helping him through some rough auditions and the first shows anxiety attacks. It's just a story too good to not be told, and that comes to my forth point, the documentary style and presentation was IMO, awesome. Just enough interviews, great concert footage and enough backstory on Arnel Pineda to make you cheer for him even louder. It's just so great to see one of ""US"", looking in from the outside to be chosen and recognized for our talent, if we have it. And this kid does. Sure, he sings the music of Journey amazingly well, but he can sing EVERY kind of music. Check out his video's on youtube and you will see he could pretty much front ANY top Rock Band. If you ever believed in the underdog, GET THIS VIDEO and show it to anyone who has a dream. And, God Bless Journey for giving this kid a chance and for keeping their music alive.",1419897600,5,2239,4.341288782816229

5658626,5,B00BNESEVE,"By now, most people know the rags to riches story of Arnel Pineda, the lead singer of the rock band Jorney.
This documentary tells the story of the band's discovery of him on the internet and shows his story from
living on the streets as a homeless teen to becoming rich and famous.
But it also shows the price the band and in particular Pineda pay for that fame. Months away from family,
erratic hours on the road, temptations including women and drugs, and loud and vicious criticism of
the band for selecting Pineda as their lead and of Pineda for being a Steve Perry ""wannabe.""
On the day Pineda and Journey are scheduled to play to a sold out audience in Pineda's home city
of Manila, the documentary shows Pineda in his hotel room, telling his wife ""This is hard, this is so
hard.""
I guess what mom always said is true, ""Be careful what you wish for...""",1403654400,2,859,4.408805031446541

As Jonathan Cain said, taking a kid from a third world country and throwing him in front of thousands of adoring fans on a daily basis is something else.

5658634,5,B00BNESEVE,"If you know anything about current trends in business... you know that
big businesses and very small businesses are ""Outsourcing"" their work
to either India or The Philippines.

This DVD provides JOURNEY Fans (like me) with an inspiring story of
what is perhaps the ultimate ""Outsourcing"" to Asia in the history of the world.

Journey's lead guitarist, Neal Shon, was desperately trying to find a
new Lead Vocalist for the band that in 1983 was the Number One Rock Band
in the world, and the first band to ever draw over 100,000 people to single
concert (not counting Woodstock)... JOURNEY.

Let's face it... a talented guitarist, and a talented keyboardist, can be 60-years old and still rock...
but a lead vocalist cannot realistically be that old and effectually lead a rock band.

Using 21st Century Social Media... specifically, YouTube... Neal Schon discovered
Arnel Pineda singing in his Journey Tribute Band... located in The Philippines!

Could this very short, small, very distinctly Asian-looking young man actually replace the
legendary all-American Steve Perry (and the other front men who had previously tried
to replace Steve Perry for a few years at a clip)?  It seemed ridiculously far-fetched and unlikely.

Yet... his amazing voice... inspired the band to fly Arnel Pineda from The Philippines to California to audition.

Thus begin's rock's greatest ""Cinderella Story"" (or the male equivalent thereof).

Whether you are a JOURNEY fan or not... you will be inspired by this true documentary;
and if you are a JOURNEY fan... it is a ""must watch"".",1396483200,2,1564,5.125984251968504

Now if he had his own UNIQUE sound and not someone else's and was making the band a success, that would be another story but he's not. He's just capitalizing on the sound and fame of Steven Perry. Again, it is clear, the only reason Journey became a successful band is because of Steven Perry. Why else would they search the world over to find someone who almost sounds just like him.

Thank you sooo much Journey!!!  Thank you Arnel! Tears of Joy! Tears of Joy!

I know there are people out there who are less than pleased about Arnel singing in place of Steve Perry. For those people I would have to ask a few things like maybe instead of complaining, find a cure for melanoma.  Steve would like that.  Also how long do you think ""Journey"" looked before they actually found someone who can sing as well as Steve.  How many people on this planet have a voice like that? Lastly, what idiot thinks they know ""Journey"" better than ""Journey""?  The arrogance of some fans!  Why not pell George Forman how to box next or Brian Henson who to hire to operate puppets?

I am now married to a slightly older man that will not listen nor watch music unless it is a) classic or b) live.
This DVD was his Xmas gift.  We watched it together and just loved it!
Admittedly, this DVD is really a story about Arnel and his rise to fame by being discovered on the internet during a search for a new Journey lead singer.
Truthfully, I am not remotely close to being a fan of bands that split, divide, lose, gain members here and there, ESPECIALLY the lead singer!  And in Journey's case how could you even consider replacing/substituting the undisputed, irreplaceable voice, talent and presence of Steve Perry?
Well, as they say...once in a lifetime someone special comes along.....
Arnel is sweet, naive, modest, humble, but his talent is as big as the universe!  If you close your eyes you may never tell the difference between him and Steve Perry or Steve Augeri for that matter.
The DVD is very well produced and filmed with the majority of footage taken with Arnel and band members (even some very quick shots of Steve Perry) of Journey - which by the way, they are ALL still awesome!  Time spent with Arnel, his family and his home country is heartwarming and enlightening.
Although, personally, I would have liked to hear more vocals by Arnel in general and more complete songs sung by him.
There is plenty of back stage footage and prep, which is fun to watch.  Lots of interview and studio footage with the various band members.
 Arnel is amazing, his story is captivating, the Band members are fabulous after all these years and this DVD is an excellent addition to any rock'n'rollers collection.
Loved the DVD!  I feel it is a part of the Band Journeys experience, however, deep down I regrettably feel the band died when Steve Perry left - never the music - just the band, and any attempt at reincarnation is just an illusion and wishful thinking!
But!
In fairness to the documentary, which is ultimately, about Arnel and his journey with Journey, we thoroughly enjoyed it and we're not disappointed with it whatsoever.....we were only slightly left with a touch of melancholy at the loss of such an incredible era of music!",1388966400,4,2374,4.635714285714286

I've been a fan of Journey since they first appeared in the 70s when Steve Perry was the lead singer. I think they are both great singers, but after watching this, I was so impressed with Arnel's humility and willingness to share his feelings. He has a great exuberance for life!!

Still, it was awesome and Journey is still to this day one of my all time favorite bands that I still listen to today. Arnel will never be Steve Perry but who could be. That is in no way a dig on Arnel; he has big shoes to fill. This documentary is about his journey (no pun intended) and to be honest, is a must see. He is living the dream that all of us simply dream about. His humbleness and appreciation for the opportunity he was given really shows and I wish him all the success in the world. Even if you aren't a Journey fan or into these kind of documentaries, lets just say, you won't be disappointed.

Ramona Diaz Dont Stop Believin: Everymans Journey may not be the most important documentary of the past several years, but it is certainly one of the most fascinating. And uplifting.

The movie begins with a predicament: the remaining members of the classic rock group Journey have decided to both return to the studio to start recording new material and go on tour where they will need to perform all their familiar hits for their millions of rabid fans who are expecting them to sound the way they did decades before. Yet, their lead singer, Steve Perry, has long since left the group. What are a bunch of aging rockers to do?  The answer they come up with is to mount a search for someone who can approximate Perrys distinctive and universally recognizable vocal stylings. Thats where Arnel Pineda comes in - an amateur singer in the Philippines who had previously posted 60 videos of himself mainly doing cover versions of Journeys hits on-line. The similarity between his voice and the voice of Perry is uncanny, so the group plucks him out of obscurity and puts him front-and-center with them on stage and in the studio. This movie is a record of that experience.

To show just how far hes risen, the movie briefly chronicles Arnels hardscrabble life as an orphan in the Philipines, often living on the streets, literally singing for his supper and that of his siblings. Drug and alcohol abuse and a broken marriage also figure prominently in Arnels pre-Journey history. But all that is in the past, as now he not only gets to perform with his favorite band, but he is happily married with a young daughter. Indeed, the only negative aspect of the tour for Arnel is that it requires him to be away from his home and loved ones for such an extended period of time. But such is the life of a rock star.

The movie also fleshes out the history of the band itself, from its years of worldwide success to its periods of wilderness-wandering obscurity, from its temporary dissolution in the 90s to its successful comeback today. These experienced, wiser heads are able to keep this newbie focused on not only what is good about touring, but the potential pitfalls that await someone not ready for all that comes with fame and glory and life on the road. Thanks in large part to them but also to his own inner strength of character, Arnel is able to keep his feet planted firmly on the ground, even while his head is, understandably, in the clouds.

And indeed throughout the experience, Arnel remains a humble, self-effacing figure, a man who, despite being overwhelmed by the adoration of Journeys fans, never allows himself to  forget where it is he came from and how extraordinarily blessed he is in being able to live out this never-in-my-wildest-dreams fantasy-come-true.

As for the original members of the band - Neal Schon, Ross Valory, Jonathan Cain, Deen Castronova - they do tend to become bit-players in the film while Arnel takes center stage, but it is clear that they are equally cognizant of the fact they owe as much to Arnel as he does to them for helping make this hugely successful comeback possible. It is obvious that the members not only welcome Arnel in with open arms but that a genuine bond of fellowship and friendship has developed amongst them.

As Arnel himself admits, this is really a rock music Cinderella story with Neil Schon, who discovered him, as the fairy godmother and the tour the grand ball.

And the whole thing culminates in a raucous performance of Dont Stop Believing before a stadium full of screaming, adoring Filipino fans, all beaming with pride at the sight of a home town boy hitting the big time - and if that scene doesnt leave you with a lump in your throat and a chill running up and down your spine, you just might want to get those two organs checked out for defectiveness.

Even those who don't much care for Journey - if any such people exist amongst us - can have a great time with this film.",1381708800,4,3962,4.645714285714286

Humble and genuine, incredibly talented. His ability to change his voice is awesome. Arnel is a delight, I love his story. Journey has always rocked and were just as lucky to find Arnel as Arnel was for them to find him. When this was released I purchased a limited viewing on iTunes. I love Arnel and Journey so much I had to get the DVD when it came out. I also HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing Journey's REVELATION CD.

Well, this is a documentary dvd that is not to be missed!! I feel that Arnel deserves all the success he's had with Journey, with that being said, there will always be haters & racists even in the form of 'fans' who will not move on. As Arnel puts it, ""i'm a big fan of Steve perry, from where they're coming from, i get it.."" Watching arnel perform with journey in Singapore, he really is an exceptional singer. A singer who sings with alot of heart! He seems like a very humble man who has come from a tough and difficult road,a true rags to riches cinderella story indeed..You can see great footage of him during he's first audition with journey in the studio,what a treat! I don't see why some fans have to put arnel down because he is not steve perry. Arnel is a great singer in his own right and Neal schon/jonathan cain would not have chosen him if he wasn't that good! The way i see it is that Arnel is making his own mark while at the same time paying 'tribute' to perry.

The dvd picture quality and sound are first rate. The whole film will make you appreciate arnel pineda and journey's music (of course Steve perry too!).Makes me teary eyed when i watched this film.

It covers a great deal of very personal footage (he appears to have a great family back home - ladies, if you have no dignity for yourself at least show some respect to him and his family - he's taken!). I pray he doesn't get sucked into the toxic vortex that the music industry tends to cause on its participants.

I love the music of Journey but was put off when Steve Perry left but the story of Arnel is almost too good to pass up. The ""On Demand"" price was something like 9 bucks and I would have only been able to see it once. I figured I would order the DVD and pay just a couple of extra bucks and have it to keep. Little did I know that was a very wise decision. When the doc came in my mailbox, I rushed home and put it into my Blu-ray player and began to watch. Immediately I was taken with Arnel who graciously acknowledges the blessings that he had been given. The doc gives you total access to the story of how he was discovered and transitioned into the new lead singer of Journey replacing the great Steve Perry. While it does run a little long and repeats itself a few times you fall in love with Journey all over again and accept Arnel for the real talent he is. Nobody will ever be as good as Steve Perry was but this comes darn close! Arnel Pineda really grows into the roll of ""rockstar"" without losing his roots and the band shows how grateful they are of him and how grateful he is of them. The absence of Steve Perry is certainly touched on throughout the film and is done with class. My brother once told me that seeing Journey without Steve Perry is an expensive cover band and I never really attempted to catch a show without Perry. I will change my mindset of this band and certainly try and catch a show. Pick up this DVD, it's a great watch and you will enjoy it several times over.",1377648000,4,1596,4.168284789644013

Since Steve stopped recording and went into retirement, I have not followed Journey at all.  I remember seeing them on tour with other lead singers, but had absolutely NO interest in seeing Journey without Steve. To me, and based on the negative reviews here, Steve Perry WAS Journey.
All that changed today.  I was flying cross country and just happened to come across this documentary playing on the in-flight entertainment.  I was totally blown away and literally had tears in my eyes!!
Arnel has an amazing voice, but his love of singing,his energy and his humility at being asked to join Journey, are what really got to me.
If you have been a Journey fan, and like me dropped them when Steve left, watch this documentary.  The original members are still rocking Journey, Arnel sounds fantastic, and I think you will be pleased.

Some people should open their hearts more and realize that the world would be a better place if we could all get along no matter where you come from!  Arnel is still very humble and as he said in the movie he's not trying to replace Steve Perry, who is an excellent singer also; Journey was just looking for a new lead singer and Neil Schon found Arnel Pineda on youtube...awesome adventure!

I'll admit up front that I was never a big fan of the band Journey (nor most of the bands of the 1970s, so I didn't look it the film from a fan's perspective but, rather, as a music journalist who loves well made documentaries. And it won my approval on this level.

The first three words of the title refer to the four core members of the band Journey, who had a ten year string of hits beginning in 1978, when they disbanded, returning as a group in 1995, until their lead singer - Steve Perry - left for good. Perry's replacement for the next 10 years, Steve Augeri, wasn't enough to get the band on the charts. But founding members Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain still believed in the band.  They went to the ""ball"" looking for their Cinderella of a lead singer. In this case the ""ball"" was Youtube, where Schon spotted a young singer in Manila (the Philippines) doing Journey cover songs with his band Foo. They brought that singer - Arnel Pineda - to the US for an audition and the rest, as they say, is musical history. Arnel's been the lead with Journey for the last eight years. So the rest of the film's title belongs to Arnel, since filmmaker Ramona S. Diaz (who specializes in story-driven documentaries) was there (literally a fly on the wall - from that first audition through the end of the band's 2008 world tour (ending in Arnel's home town).

Coming from a poor area of Manila , having done, alcohol and drugs and fathering two children (one out of wedlock), Arnel is seeing both the plusses and minuses of fame. (Honestly, after seeing this film I have a lot of empathy for musicians who rise to fame quickly and have no real permanent home life.)

For Journey fans there are lots of musical performances and back stage footage (even more on the bonus features). But you don't need to be a fan of the band - or even rock music to get a lot out of the 105-minute film. Like ""Searching for Superman"", about the musician Rodriguez, this film shows what happens when a little-known musician in a third-world country enters the world of rock music fame.
If I had to fault the film in any way, it would be that it is a bit too long and sometimes repeats itself. But this, of course, won't deter Journey fans (except those who will debate which lead singer was better: Arnel or Perry).
The DVD contains an additional 35 minutes of ""special features"", including insightful featurettes on what the tour crew does, the health issues of touring and a portion of the interview panel from the premiere at the Tribeca Film Fest. The film is also available on Bluray and, as far as I know, it has the same features. The image and sound on the DVD version was just fine for me.

For those who just want to see the film, it is scheduled to have its TV debut on PBS on September 30, 2013, however you should note that less than 90-minutes is allotted so at least 20 minutes will be edited out for the PBS showing.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5658710,5,B00BNESEVE,This is an awesome documentary about Journey and how they discovered Arnel Pineda.  Growing up on the music of Journey we really enjoyed Arnel as their new voice.,1376956800,,162,4.785714285714286
5658711,5,B00BNESEVE,"I have loved Journey for 30 years! I don't want to hear any nonsense about who is singing what. Steve Perry is amazing and Arnel is equally amazing in his own right!  This is Arnel's story and it's a beautiful one.  I have seen this documentary 3 times and I just loved it! It's a ""fly on the wall"" view in the day in the life of Journey.  And it shares the poignant story about Arnel Pineda.  He's talented, humble and extraordinary! Fate is a magical thing and it just shows that when you have a purpose here, your purpose will find you.  Even if takes years!  The story is incredible and when you see someone like Arnel, you are pulling for him all the way.  I adore Steve Perry, never thought I could connect with the band without him, but after you watch this story, you will connect with Arnel!!! It's a story about HOPE and never giving up and your destiny finding you.  The story shows you that when something is meant to be, it will be! And the same for Steve Perry, if he's meant to be back with Journey, it finds it's way again.  If not, we have to respect it and move forward and not criticize and tear down their decision.  This story is moving, happy and thrilling.  If you love Journey as much as I do, you pull for them ever step of the way.  I am so happy for the band and I love, love love them!  Great story, you won't regret watching this.  I finally got to see them in concert for the first time ever.  Arnel, was so amazing and talented.  Give him a chance and if you are die-hard fan like me, you appreciate that he's here, keeping that best band in the world out there for all of us who love them to share in their gift!  Thank you Journey for all the great memories you have given me and so many!",1376956800,5,1721,4.12012012012012
5658712,4,B00BNESEVE,Loved this movie. Arnel is an inspiration. So glad they found him! I wish I had known about this before Journey came to Denver. I would have loved to see them perform with their new singer.,1376524800,,189,4.277777777777778
5658713,5,B00BNESEVE,Great job in telling this story. Hope it comes out on dvd soon. Could watch this over & over. So cool,1376179200,,101,3.857142857142857
5658714,5,B00BNESEVE,Great documentary.  Would highly recommend it to anyone who loves Journey or loves a rags to riches type story. Rent it.,1376006400,,120,4.714285714285714
5658715,5,B00BNESEVE,"Journey has changed the lives of millions of people. ""Everyman's Journey,"" completely explains why Journey has been so successful with their new singer from the Philippines. Everyone loves Journey and always will. The story of ""living the dream"" has never been so prominent, as shown in this documentary. A simple video upload and email, transformed the hearts of those who missed Journey and thousands of people who didn't know Journey. Would recommend anyone who listens to Journey, grew up with them, like them, or don't know anything about them, to watch this film.

Having not grown up through the 80's, Journey has changed my life by allowing my uncle (huge Journey lover) and I to perform their music at family gatherings. He listened to Journey and played the piano pieces throughout his childhood for many years. Somewhere along his journey, music strayed away from him and was reignited when he heard me playing one of Neal's guitar solos about 4 years ago. We now have a full family band who plays many of Journey's songs two or three times a year. To top it off, in September of 2012 we took a trip to see the New Journey in concert, which brought back the memories of my uncles childhood. Thank you Journey.",1375574400,5,1220,4.754716981132075
5658716,5,B00BNESEVE,My husband start to watch the movie and I stop cooking dinner to watch with him. I was singing along most of the way. Very god,1375574400,,126,3.8846153846153846
5658717,3,B00BNESEVE,"the movie was very good but it was WAY TOO LONG for what it was trying to accomplish.  the last 40 minutes where torture.  The film maker just ran out of ideas as did the band.  Watch the first half and the second you feel like it is getting boring, turn it off.  It doesn't get any better.",1375142400,2,290,3.9482758620689653
5658718,4,B00BNESEVE,"I don't understand the reviews on here that say Arnel is 'exploited.' How? He's singing, which he clearly loves to do, and he's making money and no longer living in the slumbs of Manilla in 4 feet of water on days it rains.  He is taking care of his family and keeping the band alive and thriving. Was he hired because he sounds like Steve Perry? Yes.  So what.  He can sing and he's humble and likeable.  What's the problem? This is a great documentary although I was disapointed that they glossed over the Perry years rather quickly but I guess, by the title, this is primarily Arnel's story and not the 40 year history of Journey.  Anyone who gives this documentary a negative review are simple haters and nothing more. Would you rather the band not be around? Perry is not coming back. If he were he would've been back 10 YEARS ago! Move on.  Go Arnel!",1375056000,87,856,4.386075949367089
5658719,3,B00BNESEVE,"Update:  I am removing two stars because the confusion of when the DVD is supposed to be released.  Originally this said it would be released on August 13th, and I preordered it based on that date.  Only to come back and now the release date is back to August 20th??  I am not happy because I promised someone they could have the disc on the 13th. Dont changes the dates.  If you cannot get it out by the 13th, then do not say you will.

Additionally the price went down from my pre ordering it.  What is the deal?

What an amazing story!  I got this movie on itunes and we are watching it for a second time.  Arnel is such an incredible talent that was found in a very cool way.  Not only that but he works hard and he is so grateful for everything life has given him.  When they say ""everyman's journey"" they mean it.  Even if you are not a singer, you cannot help but feel the promise that if you dream it, you can be it.

I was a journey fan way back in high school and my husband and I have so many memories attached to their songs of when we first met, and having been apart and then back together again.  So it is not as if I would forget what Steve Perry gave to us through Journey.  Even Arnel is a fan, and has the utmost respect for Perry.  Which is another cool thing about Arnel.  It is not fake.  Even though people bash Arnel and are all together hateful, Arnel stays humble and faithful.  He is just a really good guy that is genuine and he has a big heart, and OMG he can sing!  Major goosebumps when I hear his voice in this movie.

I believe in destiny and I believe Arnel was meant to be where he is right now.  He has rekindled the flame for Journey and he has united two worlds in a most unusual way.

This movie puts it all in a very compelling story.  It is not to be missed!  I am getting it for a friend from the Philippines, and I was disappointed to see it is not out yet!!  Unfortunately she does not have iTunes, but I will pre order it for her.",1375056000,4,1975,3.9974358974358974
5658720,4,B00BNESEVE,"Great story of someone with pure talent making it to the top, I wished the film-makers would have went into more of the history of Journey one of America's greatest rock bands, but overall I would recommend this film to anyone & not just Journey-fans",1374710400,,250,4.5777777777777775

5658723,1,B00BNESEVE,"I would have given this a zero star, unfortunately a star rating is required.  Journey is not Journey without Steve Perry... they (the group) should move on and call the band maybe  ""The Next Journey"".  Don't get me wrong, I love Arnel Pineda, he is a very talented singer and it is not fair to compare him to Steve Perry.

Steve Perry is Journey.  In fact, most if not all  of Journeys greatest hits were written or cowritten by him.  If they truly believe in Anels talent, they should allow him to shine in his own way.  If I were Arnel I would feel exploited... for the purpose of publicity...",1373500800,12,596,4.3545454545454545

5658726,5,B00BNESEVE,"I was in the Journey Fan Club back in the day and am a fan of Steve Perry's.  I didn't want to accept this new Journey at first but realized that since Steve Perry is not going to re-join Journey again, I had enough respect for their music to see what the group is doing now.  Their newest lead singer, Arnel Pineda, is not just singing karaoke - he sings with his natural singing voice, though, as the film shows, has had coaching just like any other singer.  He has a long of energy and a great attitude.  The film highlights the group's past and history, which is cool.  I admit I have not checked out Journey's newest albums but I at least wanted to see the film, which I enjoyed immensely.  I would see it again.",1372464000,7,717,4.197080291970803
5658727,5,B00BNESEVE,"The documentary Don't Stop Believin"" shows behind the scenes with one of the biggest classic rock bands of all time. The story about Journey's new vocalist Arnel Pineda is inspiring. A very poor kid from the Philippines joining the huge rock act Journey.

Seeing Arnel adapt from living in the slums of the Philippines to touring in the United States with one of the most popular classic rock bands is fascinating. There is a huge human element to the documentary. It is great to see how humble Arnel is. He has a great personality. This is no fictional or lightweight movie folks. This the real deal showing candid footage of Arnel on a big tour and his struggles with coping with a strange new life.

Arnel has a ""god given"" voice that gave him a shot at being at being in the ""big time."" Journey has to be one of the most difficult bands to sing for because of the massive high vocal range. Seeing Neal Schon and the band supporting Arnel gave me goose bumps.  Neal Schon is extremely considerate along with the rest of Journey. Neal Schon is the coolest dude and his guitar playing is up there with Jimi Hendrix! Towards the end of the documentary, Journey plays a huge outdoor concert in the Philippines. The drummer Dean says to Arnel, ""you are a rock star.""

The documentary ends with Journey in the studio recording a killer new song. The song is called City of hope.  The song is it partly about the Phillipines according to the video on You Tube. It is wonderful when Arnel sings ""That is where I am from, the city of hope.""

Don't let anyone fool you, Journey's most recent CD Eclipse is Journey at it's best. In my humble opinion, It is up there with Infinity and Escape if not better. Eclipse has the Journey signature sound from the first to the last song. It is a miracle Journey found Arnel Pineda. Journey has a ""million dollar"" sound again.  Journey has reached a new peak!

Check out the documentary!",1372291200,12,1919,4.494252873563219

I saw part of the trailer for this somewhere and briefly thought, ""That's interesting.""  Days later I saw the link on my Kindle and for some strange reason I clicked on it. I figured I'd check out a few minutes. I had no intention of watching the entire film.  (So much for intentions...)

Arnel in the meantime is blessed to have his voice which he uses to interpret journeys music with a more subdue flare.

Even so, this is an entertaining and touching look into the quintessential rags to riches story of Arnel Pineda. Unless you've been living under a rock these past few years, everybody knows his YouTube assisted road to fame and more than likely have heard his glorious voice bringing back old but not forgotten rock ballads and breaking out new Journey songs.

Having been born in the Philippines and immigrating to the United States when I was a year old, I've been a harsh critic of what comes from the Philippines, especially that of which can either inspire or just embarrass the hell out of me.

I rented this on iTunes a few days ago while on a business trip in Taiwan and I have to say that while no one (other than my parents) has made me proud to be Filipino, this documentary simply warmed me to be a little bit more open-minded. Having been a Journey fan since the 70's, I was saddened by the departure of Steve Perry and cringed at the notion of Steve Augeri. I refused to listen to anything done by Arnel Pineda...

...until I saw this documentary.

Ramona Diaz's behind-the-scenes documentation of not only Arnel Pineda's road to becoming the frontman for Journey as well as what the rest of the band thought was absolutely incredible. There's many thing to appreciate about this story, Arnel Pineda, Neal Schon, Jonathan Cain, Ross Valory, and Deen Castronovo. There truly is a lot more to appreciate outside the music we never see but only hear.

This is proof that inspiration can originate from a constantly developing third-world country that doesn't have to come in the form of boxing gloves.

To hear Arnel Penada sing Steve Perry's songs is a revelation. But to watch him morph into his idol's replacement in the beloved mega-group Journey is nothing short of miraculous. How he is discovered, groomed, and aided in becoming comfortable in his newly elevated status of legend and frontman to the delight of adoring fans by these uber-mentors--the humble, but deserving and grateful founding members of fricking Journey--is nothing short of mind-blowing. And it shows on Arnel's bewildered face offstage. He appears to be walking around in a daze...Until he hits the stage! That is when hi is not airborne. And, boy oh oh boy, what pipes!

I think any music fan will appreciate this story - you don't have to be a hard core Journey fan or be Filipino in order for this film to pique your interest. It's a feel-good story anyone would appreciate. The film tells the story of Arnel, a Filipino singer with an amazing voice who can emulate vocalists ranging from Bon Jovi to Steven Tyler and incredibly sound just like them. He was discovered on youtube by Journey when the band was looking for a new singer, and brought in to audition for them from Manila. That's already a pretty good story, now add to that all the hardships he's been through in life from losing his mom at a young age, being homeless & hungry, and later dealing with addictions -I found his story truly inspirational. And the boy can sing! He definitely deserved the chance he got and although I can understand fans generally not being happy about bands replacing its members - especially lead singers - I find it sad, tasteless and in many case disgusting the way some fans react to new band members. Especially in this case since the replacement represents a different culture.

Luckily most fans have accepted and appreciate Arnel who has helped rejuvenate Journey - an amazing band in my opinion who should've never disappeared from the radar in the first place. Oh and on a side note - it's always nice to see musicians who are humble and gracious despite the fact the we the fans can often be extremely demanding, critical (and sometimes obnoxious) - I'm always amazed by those who can handle fame without totally losing themselves in it.",1363737600,11,1596,4.659574468085107

5658756,5,B00BNESEVE,"Wonderful heartfelt documentary about Arnel Pineda, the virtually unknown -- at least outside his home country and places he had performed -- dynamic lead singer who would become the lead singer of Journey.  Ramona Diaz and her documentary team do the most excellent job of telling the Cinderella story of the man who would go from poverty to success based on the faith one friend had in his ability and based on the faith he had from within to never stop believing he could make a career with his voice.  You may or may not have seen his story on television talk shows or the Internet.  But even if you have there is much more to tell.  Ramona Diaz and her documentary team uncover full length video most have never seen more, they follow along with Arnel on his new journey -- no pun intended -- and get the whole story.  Brilliantly conceived, Independently filmed without the financial support of the band.  I know because I gave my last two dollars of mad money to the cause.  Best two dollars I ever spent.",1363478400,8,1012,4.497267759562842
5658757,5,B00BNESEVE,Arnel Pineda has a beautiful voice and is a great entertainer.  It was nice to see Journey back in the spotlight.,1363392000,,113,4.380952380952381
5658758,4,B00BNESEVE,"I rented this on iTunes, although the DVD is not out yet. This is a fantastic documentary about the ""new"" Journey with Arnel Pineda and his amazing rise to fame. His voice and story are both spectacular. It gives you a good sense of life in a modern rock band and the inspirational story of Arnel Pineda is so unbelievable, so bizarre and heartwarming.

The first half of the documentary is a ""5-star"" Journey into the heart of the band and the crazy story of finding a lead singer on YouTube. Arnel's personality is very down-to-earth... almost too much so for a rocker. The story focuses on his being found by Neil Schon, his evolution as a superstar, his family, home country and the band. Journey is a fantastic band. They've been around since the 70s. Steve Perry has been gone for 15+ years. If you love Journey music, this story will really impress you.

There are still many people who want Steve Perry back. That is not going to happen and he can't sing like this. It is most fortunate for Rock and Roll, Classic Rock and Journey fans that Arnel has brought Journey back to the top, the sell out everywhere now. His ENERGY is a 10 out of 10. His voice is a 10 out of 10.  I've seen him live 6 times... He's an inspiration.  The second half of this film, however, drags and feels long. They could have cut 10 minutes and made it more impactful... hence, I give it 4 out of 5 stars overall. Worth viewing for all Journey fans. If you really miss Steve Perry, this might even convert you.

PS. JOURNEY BELONG in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame... they are not.",1363219200,19,1565,4.345890410958904
5658759,4,B00BNESEVE,"Make no mistake:  being a singer for Journey is no cakewalk.  It's not like being the lead singer of ""The Rolling Stones"" -- my apologies to Mick Jagger; OK, not -- but if you want to sing for the rock band from The City by the Bay, you have to be ready and willing to have some serious vocal pyrotechnics.  And Arnel Pineda is surely ready for anything that Neal Schon, one of the greatest guitarists in the history of rock, has to throw at the young upstart.

I've watched Mr. Schon for years.  As a matter of fact, I've been to at least three Journey concerts:  Seattle, 1981 or so:  ""Escape,"" perhaps the best concert I've ever seen with Steve Perry; 1982 or 83:  ""Frontiers,"" where Mr. Schon gives some incredible pyrotechnics and harmonics of his own; and somewhere in the mid-2000s, that featured Steve Augery.  I felt that Mr. Augery was really, really good.  I guess that he blew his vocal cords out, and that was beyond a bummer.  But I've always wondered, returning to the guitarist for a moment:  if Mr. Schon used the pinky on his left hand, how good WOULD he have been?  He's amazing already, and so you'd have to say amazing plus.

You really feel the ups and down here for Mr. Pineda.  He comes from very humble beginnings -- his family had to sell all of their appliances and (probably) live on the street to just save their mom's life -- to the upper echelon of American rock-and-roll.  But as the tour progresses, you can tell that not only is a cold getting him down, but being away from his family in Manilla is putting a serious strain on him as well.

I really liked how Jonathon Cain takes Mr. Pineda under the keyboardist's wings, showing the young upstart the ropes, and teaching the singer how not to burn himself out while still young.  I had no idea that Mr. Cain was a vocal coach; who did?  Perhaps Mr. Augery, after watching what happened to Mr. Perry before he decided to retire?  (From what I understand, Mr. Perry retired mostly because of a hip injury he suffered in Hawaii.  Now that was a loss to the rock-and-roll community.)

No insult meant to Mr. Jagger, but this young upstart from Manilla cleans your clock as a singer, and he's got better moves than you to boot.  And he gives Mr. Perry a run for his money as well, which is surely no small feat.  A pretty big recommendation by me on a very inspiring story, especially if you're a fan of this very musically-gifted band from one of the greatest cities on the planet:  San Francisco.",1363219200,15,2478,4.417218543046357

I am a U.S. citizen, with a U.S. billing address and an APO delivery address, I was unable to download because I am temporarily in Kuwait.  Customer service was great and they refunded my credit card right away.  I just think they should make exceptions on the ""outside the U.S."" rule for people like me. It would be great for morale.  As it stands, they are encouraging people like me to look toward the piracy option.",1363219200,,476,4.5
5658761,5,B00BNESEVE,This is a real Cinderella story. He sounds very nearly EXACTLY like Steve Perry. This movie is worth watching if you want to be touched and also a lifelong Journey fan. Incredible.,1363132800,4,180,4.65625
5658762,3,B00BNESEVE,"Never really a fan of Journey, but more so a person that respected Steve Perry's vocal talents, I was hesitant to watch a movie about the man's second replacement in one of the world's biggest bands. Don't Stop Believin' is touted as the tale of Arnel Pineda's meteoric rise to taking the lead position in Journey as they struggled to find a respectable new lead singer. Although the film gives some background, it's not as detailed a movie as I had hoped for. It spends too much time on live performances while skipping over the kinds of details that make a focused documentary.

Each time the film breaks away to a back story segment, it quickly fades back in to a live setting or some more about Pineda. As a non-fan, I really wanted to see more about what brought Journey to this point in their career. This makes the film lack focus and loses the viewer with broken timelines and a segmented, non-chronological story. For me, this was distracting and took me out of the picture. However, the main focus of the movie is Pineda's third world rags to riches tail of rock star glory. In this regard, the film is quite good.

Compared to other rock and roll documentaries, I would give Don't Stop Believin' a fair rating. It's definitely a feel good rock movie but it lacks some of the charm that could have made it great. Yet, I think die hard Journey fans will get a kick out of Pineda's story and the man's ambition to front one of the world's biggest bands. I just had hoped for a little more time spent on the history of Steve Perry and his departure from the band.

8571592,5,B00BNESEVE,I love the band Journey. It struck me that Arnel l suffered so much hurt and adversity but never gave up. It showed me that Miracles do still happen. He is a lovely humble individual and I enjoy his work. Steve Perry I must say is my favorite but since he couldn't go on Im so glad that Arnel got his miracle through all his hard work. You hang in there. You have much more greatness ahead.,1530144000,,390,4.077922077922078
