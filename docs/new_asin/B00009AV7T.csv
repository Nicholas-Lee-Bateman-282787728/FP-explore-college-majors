1882255,4,B00009AV7T,"A very moving, truthful account of the horrid treatment of black men, in an era of Prejudsice and discrimination.  When the governemnt 'freed' blacks, it wasn't true freedom, and treatment of them was horrid, as many people did not progress in their own ways, holding on to the whole 'you are beneath me' attitude.  This should be shown in schools nationwide!!",1173484800,2,360,4.885245901639344
1882256,5,B00009AV7T,"This film covers the 12-year period from 1925-37, and all of the struggles that the African-American porters who worked for the George Pullman Railroad Company went through on their way to becoming successfully unionised.  It seems so unthinkable and morally reprehensible that not so long ago in history, these hard-working men were allowed to be treated this way, like being beaten up, all called ""George"" instead of by their real names, ordered around, given tips for doing things like shining passengers' shoes or even barking like a dog, being at the white passengers' beck and call, being accused of stealing company property when it was the white passenger who had been attempting to steal the train's linens, and fired just because they'd dared to attend meetings about unionising.  And because of the situation at the time, they couldn't protest, since making only $60 a month was still better than having no job.

When the movie starts, in 1925, American society is on the up-and-up, with unions, organised labor, and Socialism not exactly being very popular or approved-of causes, with a lot of hatred, mistrust, and fear directed towards them.  Initially, Asa Philip Randolph meets with a lot of resistance when trying to even start a movement for organising the porters.  However, he has the advantage of not being a porter and therefore being unable to be fired from that line of work, and he has such great organising skills and such persuasive and impassioned rhetoric that eventually even people who were initially against the idea come over to his side.  Along the way the porters and their allies have to put up with things like spies, attempted intimidation by the white men running the Pullman corporation, firings, accusations of Bolshevism, criminal violence, and attempted bribery by the Pullman execs who want Randolph to step down and stop what he's doing.  Even when things finally seem to be going their way when FDR is sworn in as president, with more sympathy for organised labor and the working-class, there are still obstacles put in their way by the white establishment, people who just can't grasp that this union is going to happen whether they like it or not, that there's much too much support for it for their old tactics of fear, intimidation, and random illegal unjustified firings to still succeed and go unprotested.  They thought it would or could never happen, but it finally did.

This movie is a powerful and moving history lesson and should be required viewing for everyone, whatever their race.  Though there's still a lot of racism in America today, at least it's not as awful or as institutionalised as it was back in the Twenties and Thirties.  Thanks to people like A. Philip Randolph, Milton Webster, and Ashley Totten, today African-American laborers have a right to be paid more than just $60 a month, the right to speak up when they're mistreated by racists, and most of all the right to be treated like human beings instead of sub-humans all branded with the name George.",1161043200,6,3028,4.929273084479371

1882313,5,B00009AV7T,This is a great movie and I highly recommend it. It tells the history of the first Black Union. And it really tells the story of the lawyer who help the Pulmans Porter fight their legal fight. Every African American family should look at this movie.,1392595200,,249,4.434782608695652
1882314,5,B00009AV7T,This is a gem........if you want to know about Porters that worked for the Pullman Co. and if you are a passenger train buff this is a must see.  This is an excellent excellent movie.  Black History buffs this is a must.  A Phillip Randolf is portrayed the way he should have instead of  a Socialist.  He fought hard for the Porters beyond what any human should have too.  Victorious.........no less but the depression took a bite out of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.  This is a film I will keep forever.,1392336000,2,515,4.473118279569892

1882346,2,B00009AV7T,"Showtime's shoestring budget necessitated too many compromises, the most glaring of which was exterior shots of British trains.  There were plenty of U.S. museum locations and representative Pullman equipment survivors to more accurately portray the ""in-service"" scenes of the on-board staff.  Andre Braugher's and Charles S. Dutton's performances were on-point, but the dramatizations and somewhat-stilted dialogue left a lot to be desired.  We should be glad that someone decided this story was good enough to be put to film (it certainly is!), but, hopefully, someone of Spike Lee's caliber may see fit to revisit it at some future time and do it proper justice.",1360713600,3,665,5.375

This stars Andre Braugher always great, The movie takes place on the trains and to make it easy for all the white cuastomers they called all the black men working George. This was a top tier job for a Black man at the time. The movie covers Andre Brughers character working and trying to start a union

1882351,5,B00009AV7T,"An incredibly well acted true to life historical event telling the struggles of the first predominantly black labor union granted in America. Led by A. Philip Randolph, who would later become a legendary figure for civil and labor rights, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters would endure hardship and opposition to become a recognized union in 1937.

This Showtime Presentation is a must see for today's dwindling labor force in the United States. It's a throwback to a time in our country when big business caused an economic depression and a new President with new ideas helped energize the country back to work. Sound sort of familiar?

The sleeping car porters began their struggle during a time of excessive corporate profits and greed. They managed to continue to organize and fight for fair employment after the historic stock market crash of 1929 and the great depression that followed. Remember, this was considered one of the better jobs available to young black men. Imagine some of the other jobs and the treatment blacks had to tolerate.

The 1930's saw many unions challenge big business, but this was the first black led organization that would eventually receive the backing of the American Federation of Labor union (AFL).  The AFL at the time was the largest union grouping in the United States, and I assume it was predominantly white.

Who knew that this early stroke of success for labor and equal rights would someday lead to a great man in 1963 making a stunning speech about a dream he had, in front of millions in Washington D.C.?  Not surprisingly, A Philip Randolph was one of the men who proposed that march on Washington in 1941 and was there to head the march in 1963 with Martin Luther King, jr.",1331596800,,1730,4.827702702702703
1882352,5,B00009AV7T,"The movie based on actual accounts of history.., The conditions of employment during that post WW1 era for those railroad porters were criminal at the least.., And a few of the porters considered their rail line employment in the early 1900's a social step up from their sharecropping/slavery jobs... At one point in the movie, the porters told the journalist some passengers rode the rail lines (JUST) to treat the porters badly... Which goes to show the dregs-of-society in that era felt it was their birthly-right, social privilage to subject the porters with disdain & contempt.., The cultures civil laws & rules permitted & encouraged the dregs to randomly choose a person of color and destroy thier existence out of spite, at a whim.., The peculiar thing about the porters struggle for the union and work conditions didn't change their cultural standing but it was the begining., As the railroad owner inquired "" The 10,000 George Movement was instrumental in changing the American culture"".., Rate this movie ""A"" (rushed at the end)",1315094400,2,1039,5.046511627906977
