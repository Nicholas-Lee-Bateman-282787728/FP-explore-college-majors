3686148,5,B001LM64TM,"The title episode, ""Robin Hood the Clean,"" is a favorite with the kids -- how could it not be when the ""villain"" is named Mayor Stinkypants! Of course, you'll have to endure your kids calling ""stinkypants"" all over the house for days after viewing. The songs and melodies are particularly ingenious in this episode.

The other episodes are also good. ""The Masked Retriever"" features Uniqua as a librarian who turns into the Zorro-inspired Masked Retriever when books are overdue. ""The Two Musketeers"" shows off Tasha's swordmanship (swordhippoship?) and never fear, the swords are crafted from balloons! ""To The Center of The Earth"" stars Tyrone as a lad searching for his missing penny and Uniqua and Pablo as inventors who are determined to help him reach his penny deep within the Earth. Very catchy songs in this one -- adults: beware, you may sing the title song at work.",1236124800,3,876,4.918918918918919

3686207,5,B001LM64TM,"My daughter (2 1/2 yr) loves these shows. we watch them at home and have one in the car.  Even my 6, 8, and 16 yr olds watch them. They teach lessons like keeping clean, accepting others, etc. and the tunes are very catchy.",1294963200,2,223,4.068181818181818
3686208,5,B001LM64TM,"As a father of a two year old little girl I am not big on TV Shows or TV in general.  This DVD is a great way to train my daughter to limit her TV time.  Typically in the morning I will let her watch an episode, then at night before bath time, and one before bed time.

This DVD contains 4 outstanding videos. As the tile states, Robin Hood the Clean. A hilarious take on Robin Hood with Pablo set agianst Mayor Stinkiy Pants-Austin.  Austin's cheating antics along with Pablo's obssesion with Mitty his cleaning mit make this one of the more comical episodes I have seen.  The songs get my daughter up dancing and singing,so she is not just sitting inactive. They are catchy enough you might just catch yourself singing along.

The Two Musketeers - Tyrone an Pablo play the the Two Muskters ""one...Two! two musketeers"" and Tasha plays the mysterious masked ballon swordsman who trys to become the third, ""but there can only be two musketeers"".  In the meantime Uniqua and Austin are the Empress' guards attempting to capture the musketeers only to be foiled time and agian by Tasha's clever tricks.

Uniqua plays a take on Zorro as the Masked Retriever, a librarian who secretly is the Masked Retriever.  When Don Austin ""The most important person in Viejo, CA"" does not want to return a book he makes a dash for Mexico, but can he get away from the Masked Retriever? Pablo and Tyrone play the guard charged with keeping Don Austin safe but Even they are no match for the Masked Retriever.

The last is my personal favorite as child of the 70s I grew up on showws like the Time Machine, Voyage to the bottom of the Sea, and Get Smart.  This episode feature Tyrone a poor guy whos penny drops through a crack in the ground.  Luckily?, Pablo and Uniqua have just the inventions to help him get it back.  An adventure of ensues mixing Jules Verne scientific imagination with good old Maxwell Smart gadgets and know how; taking the group to the center of the earth to recover Tyrone's luck penny.

Overall I would have a hard time picking a favorite between International Super Spy and Robin Hood the Clean DVDs.  I say buy them both if you haven't already.",1285891200,2,2154,4.5012853470437015

This DVD has one of our favorite episodes - Robin Hood the Clean.  It has charming, engaging songs and a really cute storyline.  The other episodes on this disc tend to lose my son's interest, but it was worth it to have Robin Hood the Clean.",1257984000,4,392,4.47887323943662
3686221,5,B001LM64TM,The stories were fun and my son really liked them. I liked them too. There weren't any behavioral problems with the characters either. A fun story I didn't have to worry about explaining poor behavior or poor character choices.,1243814400,,227,4.846153846153846

The songs are catchy, as always, and I find myself singing ""So-o-o-oap"". I half-expect to hear ""Spanish Flea"" during ""The Masked Retrieaver"" each time we watch it.

3686226,5,B001LM64TM,"The Backyardigans continues to be a perennial favorite in our household.  It's hard not to love this series, with its vibrant colors, adorably rounded characters, catchy tunes, and lovely messages about gentleness, kindness, and sharing.  The show continues to be fun and wonderful without being at all preachy.

This particular DVD contains four new episodes, including the titular Robin Hood the Clean.  Pablo, as Robin Hood, must free the citizens of Filthingham from Mayor Stinkypants--aka Austin--who refuses to allow them to take baths or even to possess objects like soap.  Pablo's meticulousness is one of the show's running jokes and it's always a joy to see him doing his best to keep everything spotless.  The show may also provide inspiration for a parent's own little Stinkypants to take his or her bath, particularly if they have a bosom bath companion like Pablo's beloved Mitty.

Tyrone and Pablo comprise the Two Musketeers named in one of the subsequent episodes.  They are plagued by Tasha, a fan who repeatedly appears and begs to join their duo.  However, Tyrone and Pablo are so intent on their quest to rid the land of the empress that they ignore the ever-capable Tasha until she eventually forces them to question the reasons behind their dislike of the empress.  There's a nice, gentle message here about not judging others without really getting to know them.

The Masked Retriever is a particular favorite of mine, book lover that I am.  Uniqua plays an Indian Jones-esque librarian who does her best to recover overdue library books.  She sets out on a particularly exciting adventure to recover the overdue book of Don Austin.  Woe betide anyone who mishandles Librarian Uniqua's books!

In To the Center of the Earth, Tyrone, Pablo, and Uniqua take the titular journey, thanks to an imaginative variety of inventions created by Tyrone and Uniqua, who have a reputation for being famous inventors.  However, their inventions don't always work as intended, much to the exasperation of Tyrone, whose levelheaded approach doesn't always appeal to Pablo and Uniqua.

This show has provided my family with endless hours of delight and every single DVD we have ever purchased has been well-worth the money spent.  My husband and I are expecting a new addition in May and we're already looking forward to getting the new little one into this show so that he and I will continue to have an excuse to watch it!",1239062400,14,2431,4.975247524752476

3686228,5,B001LM64TM,"Backyardigans are perfect for children, and the ""Robin Hood the Clean"" DVD is top-notch. I appreciate that the Backyardigans are positive, creative, imaginative, and love to sing and dance. They embody so many positive aspects that I consider important, and none of what I consider destructive.

Any Backyardigans DVD is a great buy, and this one is one of the best of the best.

Enjoy!",1237939200,,386,4.923076923076923
3686229,5,B001LM64TM,"The music genres featured in each episode may be getting more and more unusual, (Countrypolitan? Son Cubano?) but the fun and imaginative Backyardigan episodes just keep on coming.

This DVD contains the usual four episodes, and these are from Season 3.

Robin Hood the Clean
All five characters appear in this version of Robin Hood.  Austin plays Mayor Stinkypants, who runs the city of Filthingham, banishing all soap and other cleaning materials to the dungeons.  Tyrone, Uniqua and Tasha are forced to play along and hope that Robin Hood the Clean (Pablo) can free them from the stinkyness.

The Two Musketeers
This is another episode with all five characters. Tyrone and Pablo are Musketeers, Uniqua and Austin are guards and Tasha is the Empress.  A mysterious masked woman requests to join the Musketeers, and is soon proving herself against the guards as a mean balloon wielder.  Just who is that masked woman anyway?

The Masked Retriever
Mild librarian by day, Uniqua shows her true colors whenever someone fails to return their library book on time.  When the book Tasha wants to borrow is discovered to be overdue, the quest begins to recover it from the hands of the powerful and wealthy Don Austin and his guards Pablo and Tyrone.

To the Center of the Earth
A thrilling Vernian adventure as the three main characters Tyrone, Pablo and Uniqua drill down, down to the earth's core in search of Tyrone's lucky penny.  They go through the ""bouncy"" layer and the ""slippery diamond"" layer, but unlike the recent Brendan Fraser movie, there's no schist layer.

Recommended for families with young children, people who have young visitors over for a TV evening, and those who don't need an excuse to watch kiddy videos.
