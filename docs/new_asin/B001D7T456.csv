3527712,5,B001D7T456,"I don't know why people trip so much on the presentation of dvds, either full or wide, in my opinion, it is the content of the dvd more than anything, the screen presentations are really not that important to me!  Now, this 5 disc dvd set of the Boston Celtics championship run of 2007-2008 is great!  You get a terrific game 7 from the Cleveland Cavalier series and the games from the Laker's series, all great stuff!  This is a must buy for Boston Celtic fans and basketball fans period!",1227571200,,489,4.411111111111111
3527713,1,B001D7T456,Broadcast in HD Widescreen but presented here in 1.33:1 Full screen.  You have to buy Blue Ray version to get complete picture.  Game selection is fine but if todays movies and TV series are in 16:9 format why not Celts playoffs?,1226448000,,229,4.560975609756097
3527714,5,B001D7T456,"If you think this ""Special Edition"" also includes the 2007-2008 season synopsis, think again.  It is only Game 7 vs Cleveland and the 4 wins against LA.  You still have to get the ""2007-2008 NBA Champions - Boston Celtics"" for the season summary.",1225670400,,246,4.6976744186046515

8292314,4,B001D7T456,"This set is good in that it shows the Cectics 4 Finals plus Game 7 of the East Semis againt Cleveland.
However I feel this set lacks the 2 games the Celtics lost. As a basketball fan with no allegience to either team this set dosen't feel complete.
I would still reccommend this set for any basketball fan (Maybe not Lakers fans) but for me I would rather have games 3 and 5 included.",1292544000,,384,4.202702702702703

8292317,4,B001D7T456,"Unlike some past years NBA champion team sets, this one is pretty bare bones, but the price is reflective of this.  Instead of paying seventy to eighty bucks and getting every single game, highlight, interview, and behind the scenes features, you're getting the new, possibly catered to the bad economy, stripped down edition.  That's not a bad thing, as it keeps the price low for fans just wanting to revisit all their wins.  That's all this set is, 5 games: their 4 wins in the NBA finals, and the entire Game 7 of the Cavs series.  No special features of any kind, like incorrectly noted in the description, so beware of that.

We already got the final quarters or that Cavs game, and the final quarter of the Pistons series last game in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2007-2008-NBA-Champions-Boston-Celtics/dp/B0015XHR5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2007-2008 NBA Champions - Boston Celtics</a>.  You also got a recap of the season and a story about their championship run, so you have to get that one if you're looking for bonus features.
