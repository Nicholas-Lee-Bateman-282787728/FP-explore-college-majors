8226102,1,B000TQAF6O,"I was really excited about this 80's music DVD.  It has some great tracks on it (how often do you find Scritti Pollitti videos?!?!), but the video quality is pretty bad.  It looks like a 10th generation dupe of a VHS tape, pretty disappointing.  :(",1268352000,8,248,4.466666666666667
