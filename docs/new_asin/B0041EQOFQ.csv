For my 2006 Panasonic Plasma, the bars never disappeared across the full range of the set controls.  In other words, the techniques on the disc were not effective for adjusting this set.  Like the instructions on the video, the tests seem oriented to an older generation of sets.

The color and sharpness adjustment displays did seem to work properly, but given the shortcomings described above, I would not recommend this product to owners of current equipment.",1180051200,3,609,5.247422680412371

It gives your home theater system, both audio and video a complete checkup and easy to use adjustments and fine tuning. The multitude of tests and adjustments will reveal any problems or short comings in both the audio and video of any home theater system, which makes this DVD a must have.

4241862,4,B0041EQOFQ,Nice product for setting up home theater. Advance calibration controls can be tricky. Need lot of patience to set up you color calibration. Over all this DVD is a good value.,1177804800,,174,4.645161290322581
4241863,4,B0041EQOFQ,"So, you paid an arm and a leg for a big HD screen and a capable surround system, why don't you have this??  Honestly, I had no idea how much better a properly calibrated image would look compared to the out of the box settings.  This disc makes it easy.  There are a lot of advanced options, but I stuck to the suite of basic video calibrations and got good results.  The image isn't as bright, which concerned me at first, but then I started noticing all the details I was missing with the overly bright and washed out factory settings.  My wife commented on the improvement and I ended up using the disc to calibrate our two older standard CRT displays with equally good results.  For video calibration everything you need is here.  For audio you just have to go down to the local Radio Shack and pick up a $50 sound level meter.  Again, the basic audio calibration suite is easy and provides good results.

Why not 5 stars, well, I have to say, the provided 40-minute video regarding home theaters is entertaining in its way, but kind of basic.  That part of the disc is designed for complete neophytes, but I'm thinking most people don't get a calibration disc prior to purchasing their system and don't really need to be told that the red colored plug goes into the red colored jack.",1177027200,4,1288,4.4425531914893615
4241864,4,B0041EQOFQ,"I have a 50"" Panasonic plasma.  I wanted it calabrated to ISO standards but couldn't find anyone certified and with the proper equipment to do it within 100 miles so I tried this.  The basic video adjustments were explained pretty well.  I had to watch the explainations of how to do it several times before I felt confident to try.  The good thing is that you are only adjusting the user accessable adjustments meaning that you can't to too much wrong that can't be put back to your beginning settings.  The same thing can be said about the bad thing.  A proper ISO calabration requires access to the user service menu.  This is no place for an amateur like me to be poking around and serious DAMAGE could result.  After going thru the standard adjustments I found that the shipped settings were way too ""bright"" and one color was ""pushed"" which I understand is common.  This product will(may) not get you a 100% perfect ISO calabrated set but its pretty darn good.  Be prepared to make some judgement calls on some settings and you will probably go back and try it several times before you feel you've ""got it"".  I feel I got a good product at a fair price.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because some before and after video clips would have helped with the customers warm and fuzzy feeling that he really did improve the quality of the picture.  I also found the user interface initially confusing with respect to navagating back and forth thru the differant menus.  I got better at it as I used it more so it is probably just as much my shortcoming as the products.",1175385600,,1576,4.445993031358885

However, for those that weren't a novice, the only use for the DVD was the calibration. Since technology is constantly changing, this disc is pretty much useless now.  Most of the information in this DVD does not apply to HDTVs or modern audio receivers.  If you are looking to improve that new big screen HDTV stay away from this disc.

This DVD made me realised that proper calibration cannot be done using the naked eye alone. You need test patterns and filters. Forget about those preset modes in your tv(sports, movie, standard). They are really for retail/showroom out-of-the box convenience that rarely gives optimum picture. Lots of test patterns. Easy to use.

4241869,4,B0041EQOFQ,"The content of the DVD is great. It is very technical, and at the same time it helps you understand some of the more technical stuff, but it is extremely out of date. I have a Plasma and they mention that Plasma and LCD are future technologies. This creates a problem when they are running through the instructions for the tests. Some say for a CRT do one thing and then for a projection TV do another, but it gives no instructions for LCD flat panels or Plasma.

Those are the bad parts, but the quality of the out of date content is really nice. If it were up to date it would probably be pretty awesome. I'd recommend this disc as I understand it is the best available at this price range, as long as you understand that you may have to get some help on some of the sections that don't cover your newer technology.",1173571200,3,817,4.203821656050955

4241871,4,B0041EQOFQ,"I purchased the AVIA HT DVD after reading on how much of a difference it could make on a new TV.  First, the DVD takes you through an intro to hometheater, but it is quite dated.  The second part takes you through a basic video calibration and audio calibration.  As referenced on the DVD you really do need a sound pressure meter to calibrate the audio.  I only used it for the video since I am still shopping for an audio setup.

The video setup is great and it comes with three color filters.  I have a new plasma HDTV and as stated on the DVD with new televisions the red and green are usually spot on and only the blue needed to be tweaked.  The DVD also includes many more advanced calibration images which it explains with text but they're over my head.  Navigating the DVD seemed simple at first but moving back and forth between test screens can sometimes get you lost.  I don't have any experience with other calibration DVDs, but this served my  needs well and made my television picture look just right.  I look forward to getting a home theater receiver and speakers set up with the DVD in the near future.  I definitely recommend this DVD although the navigation isn't perfect and the intro is dated.  It would be nice to see an updated version meant just for HDTV sets.",1173398400,,1284,4.389830508474576
4241872,4,B0041EQOFQ,"I found the range of tests to be very comprehensive, well explained, and easy to use.

One test I didn't expect to find, but was delighted that I did was test for speakers being out of phase - certainly saved me having to pull the AV receiver out of the cabinet and check all the wiring which would have been a nightmare

The only downside is that the guide is now a few years old and doesn't really cater for 7.1 systems and wide screen plasma and LCD TVs

Other than these couple of issues I would highly recommend the AVIA Guide",1173312000,,531,4.186274509803922

4241874,5,B0041EQOFQ,"Head and shoulders above VE for ability to tweak what you want to tweak.  That is, after all, why you're getting this?!",1172880000,,119,4.409090909090909
4241875,4,B0041EQOFQ,"For reference: 7.4 System: dVision 1080p/Crystalio II/Stewart Firehawk/Pioneer S-1EX&S-2EX/Velodyne DD12&DD10/Lexcion MC12B/BelCanto amps&player.
(I am using equipment that is far above average consumer models and is capable of producing the finest quality in audio/video performance. I also have the capability of tweaking to incredibly granular levels.)

Bottomline - Each product produces great results but they go about it differently and each focuses on different subject matter. I.e., one explains an aspect of a test very well while the other glosses over it.

You will achieve slightly different results but the results are both very good and are really subject to the eye of the beholder. For example, each comes with 3 color filters but there are slight variations in tint and brightness. I setup my theater using both discs and went through a lot of the advanced tunings (many are totally unnecessary for adjustment and are just to see what will happen.) and although the settings varied; e.g., one had slightly higher contrast levels but lower brightness while the other slight lower contrast but higher brightness - in the end both results balanced out to pretty accurate and pleasing presentation. (as a note, if you try using the THX setup on a THX certified movie DVD, this will create yet another type of settings.)

I could expound on the technical differences for hours but you probably just want to know which one to get.

If you really like tweaking and messing with your home theater, aren't a professional using Sencore type devices, and you have a system that merits tweaking (i.e., HD capable tv, video scalar/proc, etc.) get both discs. Each one has a surprising amount of information and because they approach settings from different view points, is interesting to try both out to see which one you like for yourself.

If you don't care that much or have a more simple setup (receiver, dvd, decent tv) and just want to get some good video/sound settings, as your adjustments are very limited anyway, pick up the ""Sound&Vision Home Theater Tune Up"" version for 18 clams because the explanations in the Basic Adjustment section is more straight forward and to the point. Plus the various samples are great. (THX logo and Dolby logo tests are all excellent.)

If you do care about quality and tweaking but want to get just one, check out the DVE because it covers more of the techie aspects in depth. Also you can download a pretty comprehensive guide for each test from the website. Also it has some very good demo video and audio to evaulate your work. By the way, the Repeat Loop for audio calibration on the AVIA is frustrating because it will switch to the next track after a couple of loops no matter what so you have to constantly fiddle with the tracks as you are tweaking. Minor quibble? Sure but trust me, it is a pain when you have four subs and 5 speakers to tweak. (Oddly, the S&V version doesn't have this problem.)

By the way both products have awful navigation. AVIA is frustrating because you can't use the UP button to navigate so have to scroll through the entire page to get to the next page icon at the bottom of the screen. It takes forever to navigate through the DVD. DVE's navigation has really bad (I mean completely awful) UI as well and because it is many layers deep there is no quick intuitive way of finding what you need without the downloadable guide. (But at least you can use the UP nav button on the remote.)

Hope this helps.",1171238400,11,3487,4.790349417637271
4241876,5,B0041EQOFQ,"This is a great calibration DVD, but you don't have to dish out 40 bucks on this.  If you have Blockbuster Online or Netflix (like I do), you can simply rent it, use it in one day's time, send it back, and enjoy your next DVD in perfect picture quality.",1170892800,16,253,4.06

4241880,5,B0041EQOFQ,"Initially I owned basic HT, with pioneer VSX515K and Harman Kardon speakers HKTS-14 with 5.1 setup. After extensive web search and collection many articles on configuring home theaters especially sub woofer and room acoustics, I could not resist in getting Radioshack SPL

meter. I calibrated with test tones from the receiver and performed

basic calibration. But by whole insight changed after I bought this

CD and re-run the calibration. For a beginner one can go through all chapters and get all the jargons clarified and for an advanced users

there are enough test tones. On test tones it is really exhaustive suite

for all frequency spectrum.

Recently I upgraded by HT to THX Select 2 receiver and 7.1 setup. The new

receiver has auto calibration, but I ensure that I test it using Avia CD and verified the setting and in some cases slightly adjusted. The sound is now really balanced and expanded giving much realistic in depth experience. One aspect I emphasize for all HT owners is check the PHASE IN/PHASE OUT setup for all you speakers, that really makes huge difference

in the sound.

On the video, test patterns are really handy for calibrating the HT projector. I tested the patterns with my new Sanyo PLV-Z4 HT projector. I am not sure if I am lucky or a Sanyo's product quality, my projector out of box had recall good calibration and passed almost all test given in this CD.

I recommend every HT enthusiast to have this CD in the collection and run it atleast one a year to ensure that any setting need to be tweaked based on either location changes of the equipment or movement of sitting positions in your Home Theatre.

Pros:

- Test Tones

- Video patterns

- Conceptual Insight

Cons:

- Basic concepts content can be reduced

- Its not negative but in order to make DVD more attractive on video if authors can include some clips before and after calibration it will give visual baseline especially for beginers",1169078400,2,1940,4.726190476190476

So much so that I would definitely have taken it back if that's what I was stuck with.  But after about 30-45 minutes (it was my first time) of calibrating the video settings using this DVD, I was incredibly pleased with the results...the fuzzy, washed out, eye-straining and geometrically surreal original had morphed into a vivid and sharp yet soft and lifelike beauty easily rivalling the most impressive LCDs and even plasma TVs I have seen in shops which cost 2-5 times more!

About the hardest calibration was the contrast and brightness settings, the other basic video adjustments were very simple---ESPECIALLY the ones involving the 3 little colored film strips!

My only wish is that the people who make this Avia DVD would provide maybe a written outline of the DVD's content. I found the navigation system not real easy to follow at all.

Also much of the narration was a bit techno-geekish and abstruse---if they would use things like bulleted Powerpoint-type pages to introduce and reinforce basic/key concepts that would be much more useful.  I found myself having to go back and replay a couple of sections repeatedly, while jotting down notes on a notepad.

As for the audio calibrations, yes you will need to buy a forty dollar Radio Shack SPL (sound pressure level) meter.  This is worth it if you actually have a decent home theater audio system, if it's just the TV's audio or some cheapo HTIB (home theater in a box) system I wouldn't worry too much about it.

Anyways, I bought a relatively cheap HDTV---I just pity the fools who spend several thousand dollars on some huge big plasma or LCD but just live with the factory settings or try to randomly adjust the settings themselves!  That's like buying a Ferrari and using the cheapest low-octane gas.

5 stars for the final result: a stunning picture!

4 stars for clunky interface/navigation and lack of documentation and support",1153785600,15,2355,4.926582278481012
4241898,1,B0041EQOFQ,"I found the Avia Guide to Home Theater video and instructions too complicated (in that ""to get optimal results you need to purchase a sound meter...,"" etc.).  Had I known in advance the additional equipment needed, plus the tacky little 1"" X 2"" color films used to stick on your monitor to measure color were not really an option for quality measurment, I would never have ordered the video.  A good lesson learned which has been shared with friends.",1152748800,4,450,4.6835443037974684
4241899,5,B0041EQOFQ,"I mainly bought this calibration dvd for the video aspects of it for my CRT HDTV.  After calibrating my set as the dvd recommended there wasn't a video adjustment untouched.  The final result was a picture that was much better than before except it took me a while to adjust to living without that blaring brightness level that was originally set by the manufacturer, but since I am now used to the lower brightness level I have no desire to watch an uncalibrated TV.

  Anyway, as I already stated this dvd was originally purchased for the video aspect.  I had the dvd for 3-4 weeks before I even got around to calibrating the audio with a sound level meter (from Radio Shack for 40.00).  I was more impressed with the change to my audio quality than with the video change.  I mean, when you finally get the audio calibrated (it is not a quick process) and hear the THX opening sequence to a movie you really know that you have made a wise investment.

  Overall this was a great purchase and I recommend it to anyone that has spent any amount of money on their home theater to seriously consider this item.  It is simple, informative and the results are great.",1151712000,6,1162,4.454976303317536
4241900,5,B0041EQOFQ,"After reading the various reviews for this disc on Amazon, I had to try it.  It's money well spent; the disk is easy to use.  Yes, there are video tests on it that have no instructions, but the basic tests for color, tint, hue, brightness, etc. are MUST HAVES for anyone who has a CRT TV or two.  I was pleasantly surprised by the results, especially upon discovering that after using the DVD my knowledge of a good picture versus a CORRECT picture is GREATLY enhanced.

Do not go on watching your TV with the 'red push'/COLOR incorrectly set!  Buy or borrow this disc!",1151452800,4,569,4.4326923076923075
4241901,5,B0041EQOFQ,"Even though this DVD isn't in a widescreen format, it's still very useful. I have a widescreen LCD and a standard TV, and the DVD helped me to get the controls just right on them. It helped me to get a sharp bright picture without exaggerated primary colors, like red and blue.

My 26"" LCD TV originally had some really bad line ghosting. Think of the ghosting as a single black line on the screen duplicated several times to the side of the original line with decreasing levels of intensity. I thought it was some sort of JPEG compression artifact in the TV, but this DVD helped me to figure out how to get rid of that problem (decrease the sharpness and use different types of cables).

The audio calibration is helpful too.

Even though some of the comments on the DVD are slightly dated, it gets the job done on modern TV sets, and it's very educational. It's better than some of the other ones I've used.",1149120000,6,909,4.398809523809524
4241902,5,B0041EQOFQ,"I bought the Avia GtHT when it first came out for my CRT tv and home theater system.  It was invaluable for helping calibrate my system, especially balancing the 5.1 surround sound and correcting the factory settings on my tv. I was able to significantly increase the performance of my system with this dvd.

I recently upgraded to a plasma HDTV (actually just a monitor, the Panasonic TH-42PHD8UK) and progressive scan dvd player.  I went looking for a new calibration disk and found that Avia GtHT seemed to still be the standard.  Instead of buying one of the newer dvds, I used the Avia program again.  Much to my delight, all of the test programs are valid for HDTV as well.  The GtHT showed that the factory settings were dead-on for the plasma monitor.  The sound tests revealed an incorrect setting on the dvd player which was easily corrected.  Also, my new dvd player didn't have the navigation issues my old one did with the disk.  Since both players are Sony, I'm not sure why this shows up.  On my original player, I used the ""next"" button to get to the section I wanted.  It took a little extra time, but I was able to use the disk.  With the new player, navigation is a breeze.

Bottom line:  Even though there are newer products, this one is still the best for the nonprofessional user.",1145145600,13,1302,4.5085470085470085
4241903,4,B0041EQOFQ,"This dvd is very straight forward and does an excellent job of calibrating any tv.  I initially used it to calibrate my front projector, and I was so impressed I ended up using it on every tv in the house.  I read other people complain that it was difficult to use. If you can't figure something this simple out, you shouldn't own a tv that needs calibrated.  Do me a favor and just continue to watch your tv with the red push?  My only complaint is on the advanced calibration techiques.  Why provide the calibration tests, if you are not going to tell people what to adjust to fix the problem. The only reason I was able to use some of them was because I used to help install for a local shop in my area.  Even then, there were a few tests that I just shrugged my shoulders and could not tell what the heck they were testing for.  Either way, the basic calibrations will get the job done.",1141948800,13,890,4.2
4241904,1,B0041EQOFQ,I found this program frustrating to use and of very little actual help. Endless prattle about crt systems which does not help much with a plasma tv (in tv calibration setting). Try to skip ahead on dvd and more then likely the disk will stall and you have to start all over. The calibrations are NOT explained clearly and the program to adjust settings is virtually useless for fine tuning. Overall a waste of money I am sorry to say as I had high hopes for this program.,1141862400,6,471,4.363636363636363
4241905,3,B0041EQOFQ,"My review is based solely on the video calibrations from the DVD.  As mentioned ad naseum, this DVD is extremely useful if you currently have a CRT-based TV.  That being said, some of the test patterns do not apply to newer technologies like Plasma and LCOS.  The navigation is very weird to say the least, but I found no problems with the narrators' explanations on how to use the tests, and found them easy to use and very intuitive.  The results were fantastic on my CRT tv's, but less so on my Plasma due to the fact that some of the tests won't work on newer TV's.  That being said, I would only recommend paying $35 for this DVD if you are going to be using it to calibrate both your audio AND video, or if you own only CRT sets.  There is no value in this for just calibrating video aspects of your home theatre only.",1139443200,14,824,4.2165605095541405
4241906,2,B0041EQOFQ,"Outdated over-emphasis on CRT's. Audio tests are worthy, but I (and likely many others) cannot make use of most of the video calibrations because my LCD TV's (Aquos) menu window covers vital portions of the test's patterns. If you have more than one line in the menu, what part of unusable needs to be explained?

The tutorial section is informative for a beginner, but those types won't need this level of adjustment - besides there is a plethora of info online to teach the basics for free.

The red, green and blue plastic-film filters are useful, but there must be a cheaper source online.

Best bet - find a set of color filters and rent a DVD with THX audio/video setup. Just as good I.M.H.O. The Abyss is one, see other reviews for titles.

Most people who buy this are like me and will probably ignore the negative reviews. Why are you reading them. If you want validation look elsewhere.

I have to say the navigation system on this DVD is among the worst I've EVER seen. Parts of it may not work on certain DVD players, among them mine, even though I've never had any trouble with other DVDs on my player. The navigation that does work is horribly inconsistent and confusing. At one point it lists 7 options. Instead of picking an option with the normal up/down/enter buttons you have to use the numeric keyboard. This is the ONLY time the numeric keyboard is required and there is absolutely no clue. I've used some badly designed software before and that's probably the only reason I was able to guess the mystery numeric navigation. Totally idiotic. In addition there are gratuitous 3D animations that serve absolutely no purpose except to fool someone screening the idiot designers portfolio. At an early point in the DVD a book with animated turning pages comes up which I at first guesse was part of the navigation. In retrospect I have no idea why they put that animated book in. I can't think of a worse navigation idea.

Other problems are useless talking head movie segments. For instance the narrator lets you know that you should probably use the disk to optimize your system. Thanks I wouldn't have known that! There is even a plug for the DVD! Duh! I ALREADY bought the thing, you don't have to convince me, just let me get to the adjustments!!! PLEASE!

Some of the test patterns abruptly end too soon which means navigating UP then back down to where you were so you can desperately try to adjust it before it abruptly ends again. Others screens last way too long and are impossible to get rid of going forward OR backward, which means you have to wait forever to get to the next screen or you have to start again at the top of the idiotic navigation and laboriously navigate back down. Many, if not most segments won't allow you to simply back up so you have to... yup go back up to the menu, navigate down then fast forward through many many segments. Sheech! They couldn't have given more than a hour or two's worth of thought to the navigation. It's a total mess.

It took me several hours to get through the basics, partly because I'm thorough but mostly due to the navigation and useless movie segments. I'm going to have to do the basics at least once more to get my screen correctly tuned.

Text in many areas is supposed to come up to explain advanced adjustment screens. NOPE nothing there. The disk says some machine require subtitles to be enabled, which I did, to no avail. I'm assuming these will work on later DVD players but...???

I think the damn thing will work decently (once I figure it out) which seems to be it's only redeeming quality. It works but it's a desperate struggle.",1134432000,18,2936,4.5406427221172025

4241917,2,B0041EQOFQ,"First off, if you want to calibrate your LCD, plasma, LCOS, or DLP TV, do *not* get the Avia Guide DVD.  This guide was published in 1999 and about 2/3 of the video calibration tests do not apply to non-CRT TVs (direct view or projection).  For example, all the needle and convergence tests are useless for flat panel TVs.  A lot of the introductory material is also out of date.  Even the two actors look out of date.

Second, despite its reputation, the Avia Guide proved very disappointing to me.  I'm a gadget freak, so I already knew most of the ins and outs of home theaters when I bought this from Amazon -- I bought it to calibrate my new LCD TV.  So the tutorial section was mostly a waste of time for me -- but again, had the material been updated enough, it would have been more fun.  Unfortunately, the presentation is boring, the two actors can put you to sleep, and the navigation is poor.

The navigation gets worse when you get to the calibration part.  Only the basic video calibration part (for black level [contrast], white level [brightness], color, hue, and sharpness) has voice-over guidance.  Other tests (and there are a lot of them for audio and video) are broken down into groups.  Each group has 6-12 tests.  On the group menu, each test has two separate entries: description and testing pattern.  This is stupid because you'll have to punch your DVD's remote control ad nauseum to pick the test you want.  And when you get back to the group menu, the highlight goes back to the first selection, so you'll have to push the arrow buttons 20 times to get to the 10th test pattern!  This is absolutely a nightmare.

Also, the tests are not explained clearly.  For the basic video tests with voice tutorials, you have to view the tutorial and do the test separately, and what constitutes a ""perfect"" calibration is never explained clearly.  The other tests require you to read through one or more screens of test description.  If your TV is less than 30"" and you don't have progressive scan, forget about reading the text.  It'll just kill your eyes and your interest in this whole process.  (Of course, this won't be new to you if you've ever used one of those THX calibration programs on a THX DVD.)

In summary, the Avia Guide DVD is out of date and very user-UNfriendly.  In fact, my own first-hand experience as well as online research reveal that most namebrand HDTVs (such as Pioneer [best for plasma], Panasonic, Sharp [best for LCD], Hitachi, Toshiba and Sony) pretty much come well-calibrated.  In the end, I really think it's your own eyes and ears that are the ultimate judge of what's good calibration and what's not.  Cheerios.",1100217600,125,2664,4.602972399150743

I recently got a new tv and wanted to make sure it was set correctly(factory specs are always horrible). I was supposed to borrow my friends Avia DVD but he apparently lost it. It was a sad and scary moment thats how important this is. I bought my own and felt stupid for not having it already. Anyway, the only caveat I found is my new tv is a DLP and this DVD isn't updated for that kind of technology.

Enter Avia.  After you use Avia in your home (with your lighting conditions), you may, in fact, say, ""This picture sucks worse.""

The pictures in the big box retailers are (more than likely) so juiced up on contrast that anything less than staring into a flourecent bulb will be considered ""dim""  The VARs sync the perfect signal for their perfect rooms.

This is where Avia shines.  The DVD gives you (I wish alt-I worked for posts) a ring-side seat to video tweaks.  You get the CRT-killing contrast tweak patterns.  You get brightness, sharp, color, and tint tweak patterns.  A fine lineup for $35.

You won't get a 'certified' calibration, but as long as you keep the contrast adjustment at the recommended levels (for burn-in prone sets), you're well on your way to a much improved TV watching experience.

As for Avia's audio calibration tools.....well.

The 3 star rating is based on three factors: this is the best video calibration you can do at home with your own eyes, good audio calibration requires a sound level meter, the DVD navigation is the  absolute worst.

I left the worst marks for the end.  DVD navigation is pathetic at best.

The sound calibration section does not contain anything more useful than the calibration tools already built in all Dolby Digital and DTS receivers.  The video calibration is more useful to people with rear projection tvs that need their lenses converged periodically.  However, most newer tvs have an auto convergence feature anyway.  As mentioned in other reviews, the Star Wars dvds have a simple calibration tool to help you set the contrast and brightness.  Videophiles like to scare people into calibrating their displays by spouting off about manufacturers' settings being too bright, too red, etc.  That may be true especially with CRT and rear projection tvs, but I have found the factory settings on my LCD front projector to be very close to the calibrated settings obtained with AVIA.  AVIA does have some nice explanations of some of the theory behind display deives, but my advice is to find this for free on the Internet and save yourself some money.  The easiest and cheapest thing to do is to watch some DVDs with dark scenes and adjust your contrast and brightness to give you the black levels you like while retaining the amount of detail you desire.  Look at flesh tones to set the color and tint of the display.  That is the easiset, least expensive way to give you a picture that you like.",1053302400,92,1480,4.791338582677166

For an eternity I put off buying anything ""extra"" like this, believing that there is little that could be done to a home theatre system because, after all, most people use it without any tweaking and enjoy it!
Then, on a whim I bought a few separate DVDs for speaker polarization, the Ultimate DVD Platinum that included digital dolby versus dtd comparative, and a surround sound testing kit. If you buy any of such stuff, you will most likely end up believing that any additional DVD testers/tweakers are basically useless.

4241931,5,B0041EQOFQ,"Having purchased both discs, I have very strong feelings about this. Avia bests VE in almost every respect:
1. Navigation: On VE, the navigation is handled by a very confusing set of menus within menus. On my DVD remote, I could only access one of the menus using a button that I otherwise never use. Until I figured this out, the only way I could skip through the initial (not very useful) audio stuff was to fast forward! Avia's menus work like every other menu I have ever used. No problem with navigation.
2. Color calibration: VE offers only a blue filter. However, Avia provides red, blue, and green filters and allows you set each independently.
3. Sharpness: VE simply tells you to turn your sharpness all the way down. The pattern for setting sharpness is so under explained, it is useless. Avia provides a full explanation and resulted in my setting the sharpness level considerably above zero.
4. Brightness and Contrast settings: VE provides only static bars (and requires that your DVD passes pure black). Avia provides bars that flash. This makes getting proper settings much easier. Also, your DVD doesn't have to pass pure black.",989539200,501,1145,4.817258883248731
4241932,3,B0041EQOFQ,"I purchased Avia over Video Essentials.  I own a Hitachi Ultravision Digital Television driven through a Sony surround sound system.  I was concerned with fine-tuning the TV.  I ran through the DVD and found the explanations and menus rather simple and easy to follow.  Unfortunately, the only aspects of the DVD truly useful with my TV were the color intensity and tint.  The settings for these were very close, but I did adjust them a bit.  The built-in Magic Focus and what Hitachi refers to as AI (artificial intelligence) color actually do a rather good job at setting the television to optimal performance.  The real advantage to the DVD was to motivate me to experiment with the settings of the television ... like turning off Noise Reduction while viewing a DVD and turning of the AI color setting.  I'm not sure the DVD was really worth the money, but I am pleased with the final results.  However, most of these I could have obtained without the DVD.  I did purchase an audiometer to run through the pink noise signals provided on the DVD and made some very minor adjustments.  I do not feel my money was wasted, as I will loan the DVD to friends who will be able to make more use of it, as they do not have high-end digital televisions.  I cannot vouch for the usefulness of the DVD with lower end tubes, but I suspect it will be very useful.",986256000,9,1353,4.5
4241933,1,B0041EQOFQ,"I am greatly disappointed with this DVD. Its creators were apparently unable to decide whether it was intended for complete ignoramuses or for professionally licensed video technicians. We can safely say, however, that the target audience is certainly not the intelligent consumer. Consequently, one is alternately forced to sit through some cable-knit-sweater-wearing chump's insultingly horrid discussions of just what constitutes a home theater, followed by either bloatedly pedantic or confusingly brief instructions on how to adjust one's audio and video equipment. Both the onscreen menus and the various tests are very frustrating. I often found myself repeating tracks simply in order to make some sense of just what adjustments I was supposed to be making. As to whether or not all the effort was finally of any benefit, I can definitely say that the picture on my television is different than it used to be--""better"" would be too much a leap, however. I haven't tried any of the other a/v adjustment dvds, but they certainly cannot be any worse than this one. Try your luck there, because this one stinks.",985046400,16,1115,5.2
4241934,5,B0041EQOFQ,"Being a new owner of a decent home theater system, I wanted to get things set up properly. I was truly amazed when I finished with the AVIA set-up just how much difference it made. I didn't realize just how far off my television settings were but I could sure tell when I was done!
I highly recommend this to anyone with a home theater system.
This disc would also be great for anyone planning on buying a system. It gives a wealth of information on every possible topic related to video and audio and putting them together into a great system.",976924800,14,544,4.3431372549019605
4241935,2,B0041EQOFQ,"If you know how to turn TV knobs, you probably don't need this DVD.
Only useful things on this DVD are test patterns which help you to  adjust your TV somewhat.  For that, I believe that the right price for this  DVD should be around $5-10.
Besides, if you have a HD TV, this won't help  you that much at all.  Just call an ISF certified technician to calibrate  it for you.  It might cost you 3 to 4 times as much but they can perform  true hardware calibration on your set.",966902400,17,475,4.086956521739131

Bought a 50 in plasma at a bargain price; had to convince my wife the less than impressive store display was due to the factory calibration.  Ninety minutes of tuning up and the picture is awesome. Do not buy a high def tv and watch it the way the factory set it up for a showroom! This program is easy to use and really tunes up your picture and sound.,1190332800,2,396,4.142857142857143

8412748,5,B0041EQOFQ,"There are enough adjustments on this disk to keep you busy for a week.

However, if you only use the basic video adjustments you will have a much better picture in about 30 minutes time.

I calibrated my DLP projector and was stunned at the improvement in overall picture quality. The original adjustments were done by eye and thought it looked good. After using Avia it was a million times better!

I recommend watching the section you want to use with notebook in hand and take notes as the moderator talks about each adjustment. Then go back and make the adjustments. It's much easier that way as the moderator will thoroughly explain everything and by the time you get to making the adjustment you will have forgotten what to do...that's where the notes will make it much easier.",1189209600,2,783,4.659420289855072
