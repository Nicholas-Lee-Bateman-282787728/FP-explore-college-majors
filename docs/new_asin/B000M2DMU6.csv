8165685,5,B000M2DMU6,"Acompanied by the excellent analysis of Robin Clifton, this film is a short but nice account of Bomber Command's long campaign against Nazi Germany. There are many terrific scenes from the devastating bombardment of German cities and also an explanation why the RAF resorted to area bombing. Every single type of Bomber Command aircraft is presented but of course the focus is on the Lancaster. A very good film, which uses also computer graphics to show the aircraft and the tactics used.",1170892800,4,489,4.975609756097561
