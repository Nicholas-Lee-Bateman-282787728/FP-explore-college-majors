8132192,5,B000GH3FHM,My dance partner and I are trying to prepare a routine for the rumba.  I have bought another dance video but it was at too high a level.  I bought this one because I am taking ballroom at a studio.  I could really learn something from this video and it was easy to follow.  It reviewed the lessons before and I think most beginners to intermediate dancers could follow everything.  I loved the fact that his whole family participated in this video.  I would recommend this one to anyone wanting to learn or improve his dance.,1202515200,,525,4.416666666666667
8132193,4,B000GH3FHM,"I've been ballroom dancing for over 40 years and bought this disc along with vols. 1 & 2 to brush up on some of the dances that we don't do frequently. If you don't keep dancing, you forget a lot of what used to come naturally. Their specialty seems to be Latin dances - swing is not their forte. The instruction is slow paced and repetitive. All steps from discs 1 and 2 are reviewed in disc 3 and that is all I really needed to buy. The pace is slow and repetitive for experienced dancers, but might be just fine for real beginners. Since they cover so many styles the cd set can't go much beyond the basics. The instruction is pretty clear and the camera shots are good enough to learn the steps.",1200268800,,699,4.185185185185185
8132194,5,B000GH3FHM,"I am a true novice at ballroom dancing.  This is one of two series of DVD's that I have found that is actually helpful to the beginning dancer. Series 3 continues where Series 1 and 2 leave off.

When I first started watching this DVD series, I was psychologically turned off by the black hat that Mr. Kalle was wearing.  However, the more I watched this and practiced with it, the more I realized how good this DVD was compared with others.  Starting with Series 1, you can learn 3 basic steps in each of 10 different dances that can get you started.  I have almost mastered Series 1; I am still working on Series 2 and 3.  Series 2 and 3 each review the previous DVD's in the series and add 2 new steps each.  This is enough for the true beginner such as myself.

I would like to see a Series 4 come out even though I haven't yet mastered Series 2 and 3.

  The only other series of DVD's that I have found truly useful for the novice is the Donald Johnson series with Dance Vision.

  These two series, Dance Authority with Dennis and Theresa Kalle and Dance Vision with Donald Johnson and Kasia Kozak, are both 5-star DVD's.  (The Donald Johnson series approaches one dance at a time, but increasingly adds steps to the dance and gets progressively more intricate.)

  Except for the above mentioned series and for Dance the Night Away, to which I would give 2.5 stars, I have found most other beginning Ballroom Dance DVD's (Dance the Night Away offers more than just ballroom dance) to be useless.

  I hope this helps in your ballroom dance search.",1168819200,22,1555,4.404929577464789
8132195,4,B000GH3FHM,"I really like this series 1,2,and 3. The only reason that I don't give it a 5 is with the new setup. It makes you look far away. The background should not have mirrors. Also I have a popping sound in alott of the different segments. Other that the technical problems I really like the patterns. For Series 4 I would like for you to spend more time on adding new patterns and less time on reviews the older series. Keep up the good work.",1154131200,7,436,4.141176470588236
8132196,5,B000GH3FHM,"This new DVD from the Kalle's is great!  They even have their sons dancing!!  I love it and the learning experience that their teaching DVDs have brought me.  You can see how much they love their craft as well as each other. Ballroom Dancing has been an obvious passion for these true teachers.  When I put all the lessons together from all three DVDs, plus the practice music, I feel that there is tremendous value from learning from the Kalle's.  I guess I'm a fan!  See for yourself.",1153180800,6,486,4.465909090909091
