8594512,1,B000F8EVAC,"I purchased ""washday"" and ""a girl in a swing"" washday was very good. A girl in a swing left alot to be desired it was boring and there was no swing, it was a bench out in a yard..She didn't do much of anything the whole time. Pretty lady but that was about it. This would be a good one to skip. GNDTV generally does good work but this was an off day I guess",1151193600,4,357,3.7733333333333334
