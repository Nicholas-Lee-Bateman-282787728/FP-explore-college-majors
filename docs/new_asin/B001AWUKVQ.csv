8279973,3,B001AWUKVQ,This is not a spell-binding tale.  The video is a documentary and is not something I was able to watch straight through.  The footage is the same thing I have seen on countless other videos.  But I love this stuff and keep buying it.,1376524800,2,233,4.25
8279974,5,B001AWUKVQ,"I've enjoyed the other titles in this series but this is one of the better ones. It covers D-Day and the battles for Normandy. The focus of the series is on the equipment, primarily the tanks, used in the fighting. The DVD covers American, British, and German equipment. Very good coverage of the British AVRE vehicles is provided. Historical footage, interviews with veterans and interviews with historians are used along with some computer generated footage throughout the DVD. There is also some excellent full color footage from various vehicle museums so you get a nice mix of historical footage of the tanks in action with color footage of surviving vehicles. There is also some nice color video of the Normandy beaches and surrounding areas.

There is some unique coverage in this title including footage I have never seen before. One example is an explanation of how the Churchill AVRE petard was loaded and operated. There is also a good look at the hedgerow cutter.

If you have any interest in WW2 you will enjoy this title. If you are a gamer or modeler you find it especially useful.",1287705600,3,1096,4.824468085106383
