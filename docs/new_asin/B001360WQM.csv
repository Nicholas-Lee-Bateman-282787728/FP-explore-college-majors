8249265,4,B001360WQM,"Filmed on location in New Zealand, this movie deals with a team of explorers who discover an 80-year-old journal from a British expedition and experience terrible disasters one after the other. If you watch it for the mystery, you'll be disappointed as it focuses more on the extreme obsession and isolation that can cause havoc on a group of people. Beautifully filmed, one can still sense an undercurrent of unease and tension that emerge more strongly as the movie progresses.",1321833600,,479,5.0
8249266,3,B001360WQM,"Antarctic Journal is an unsensationalistic Korean chiller full of interesting things that never quite fulfils its promise yet still somehow doesn't feel like a wasted effort either. The set-up is fairly well handled: a Korean Antarctic expedition discovers the remains of a journal left by an ill-fated 1922 British expedition only to find their own fate mirroring that of their predecessors as things start to go horribly wrong and their leader starts becoming more ruthless in his determination to reach their goal. That the horror turns out to be more psychological than supernatural isn't entirely convincing in light of a couple of early manifestations that WE see but the characters don't, and there's no doubting that the ending gets a little too confusing as the editing and direction sides with the bewildered mental state of the characters over clear storytelling. There are echoes of many earlier films, such as R-Point, but it's a well-made and handsome looking film even if the spectacular New Zealand mountain locations don't really convince as the Antarctic Plateau.",1209340800,,1081,5.254335260115607
