The focus is on Wagner's Dresden years, and the Semperoper is the perfect venue. Don't hesitate! This Wagner concert is a must have!",1393545600,2,272,4.934782608695652
6094316,5,B00GNNES60,"A veritable feast for the eyes and the ears!  Cameras roaming the exquisitely restored Semperoper in Dresden, Germany-- Richard Wagner's Sachsen homeland--proved to be a fitting venue, for giving a bicentenary tribute to the master--an artist who encountered frequent difficulties seeing his complicated works properly realized. Adding to this DVDs visual treat are two handsome and presently foremost interpreters of Wagner's works--conductor Christian Thielemann, with the excellent Dresden Staatskapelle, and tenor Jonas Kaufmann, who more than do justice to a few well-chosen selections of Wagner's most popular orchestral and operatic works. ""Richard"" will be ""amused!""",1393113600,8,674,6.094736842105263
6094317,5,B00GNNES60,"I am very happy with this DVD. Under conductor Christian Thielemann this beautiful music sounds almost light and airy and tenor Jonas Kaufmann sings it with the care, the feeling, and the unique voice his audiences appreciate him for. This concert features the gripping ""Rienzi's Prayer"" (Allmaecht'ger Vater)  and the original long version of Lohengrin's Grail Narration. The venue of this Wagner Gala was the rebuilt Semper Opera House in Dresden which makes this DVD even more special, I think, because the theater is exquisite. The DVD is accompanied by a booklet in German, English, and French.",1392768000,5,599,5.175257731958763
6094318,5,B00GNNES60,"Jonas Kaufmann might be now the hottest Tenor. Outstanding is his perfromance with German conductor Christian Thielemann, performing some great Wagner tunes. Rare material, great music. Recommended!",1392336000,4,198,6.37037037037037
6094319,5,B00GNNES60,"This concert from Dresden in 2013 was intended to celebrate not only the bicentenary of Wagner's birth, but also the direct or indirect connection of the chosen program with Dresden. Wagner was one of the court conductors from 1848 -1849 and during this period the featured works were performed, composed or inspired. Also being celebrated is the work of Hans Werner Hesse who was due to hold the prestigious post of 'Capell-Compositeur' in Dresden from 2012-13, but whose death in 2012 prevented this.

The soloist for the evening was the renowned Jonas Kaufmann whose renderings of Rienzi's Prayer, Lohengrin's Grail Narration and Tannhauser's Rome Narration were undoubted highlights of the evening and also of the disc. His mellifluous tones are ideally suited to the repertoire and his voice rose effortlessly to the occasion much to the evident delight of the packed and attentive audience.

The orchestral pieces, the overtures and the Lohengrin prelude, are delivered to a high standard with attention given to phrasing and dynamics and justifying Thielemann's reputation as a Wagnerian conductor of distinction and also that or the orchestra's high standing as a leading German ensemble. The overall style emphasises the blending of woodwind and brass textures and refulgent string tone as opposed to the more defined tonal characteristics of individual instrumental sections favoured by the British orchestras for example and that is perfectly justified given the repertoire.

The Fraternite piece for orchestra by Henze is  intended to address 'the 21st century with the demand that we should live together in peace and harmony' to quote the appropriate sleeve notes. These suggest that we should regard that as 'his legacy' and it will be up to individual listeners to decide if this aim has, in fact, been achieved. it is a laudable aim and certainly as good a case for it is made in Dresden and on this occasion.

Interestingly, Wagner's Faust overture (revised 1855 version) makes a second appearance in two recordings from Dresden with Thielemann. The first from 2011 is just 20 seconds faster, a difference that can only be detected by the clock. In both cases the work receives an excellent rendition, and seems to be a favourite with the conductor. One other editorial point is that the performance of the Grail Narration from Lohengrin is the original longer version, not the one later shortened for Weimar.

Throughout the recording and imaging is exemplary. The camera work is detailed but discrete while the actual imaging is full ranged and of good colour. The sound is presented in demonstration quality DTS 5.1 as well as stereo. There are no extras, but the concert should be sufficient reward for potential purchasers.

This is another quality product from both C major and Dresden.",1391731200,11,2810,5.149122807017544

8625142,5,B00GNNES60,"The bicentenary of Wagner's birth in 1813 was celebrated by many of the world's leading orchestras in 2013. But, few of those have the pedigree of the Staatskapelle Dresden where many of Wagner's compositions were heard first. Wagner was one of the Saxon court's conductors from 1843 to 1849. In Dresden Wagner honed his conductor's abilities by working with the Royal Court Orchestra which was the leading ensemble in Germany at that time. In this virtually all Wagner program conductor Christian Thielemann leads the Staatskapelle in several orchestral selections and then is joined by the youthful brilliant ""heroic"" tenor Jonas Kaufmann for several more. The Dresden Semperoper provides the nostalgic venue for this thrilling presentation!",1435795200,,743,5.469565217391304

Filmed live from the Semper Opera of Dresden on 21st May 2013 in honour of Richard Wagners bicentenary, two of todays strongest Wagnerians conductor Christian Thielemann and tenor Jonas Kaufmann join forces in concert.
Kaufmann published under Decca an all-Wagner CD in 2013, collaborating with Runnicles.  That solo album is immensely popular and was nominated for Grammy Award of 2014, but it is not without flaws, mostly emanating from the productions acoustics, singling out the singer to the unbalanced detriment of orchestral sound, and quite a number of listeners queried Runnicles conducting.
Needless to say, of all composers operatic works, the works of Richard Wagner require the most prominent treatment both in the orchestral texture and details, some thing of which the Decca recording was unable to fully achieve.
Here we have, in a magnificently lined up performance, a compensation for the Decca recordings shortcomings under the baton of Christian Thielemann.  At last the audience has the chance to savour a well-balanced treatment in the operatic scenes as sung by Kaufmann.
The programme contains rarities as well as all-time favourites.  The Faust Concert Overture and the original version of the Grail Narration from Lohengrin as well as Rienzi are relatively rare, and the programme does not contain red hot favourites from the Ring Cycle.  Even so, for Wagner fans, this programme is not a small dish but a sumptuous feast.  On top of the treat to some Wagner rarities by the celebrated Thielemann, the audience also have the chance to see Jonas Kaufmann performing the three major tenor scenes from Rienzi, Lohengrin and Tannhuser.  Kaufmann is particular affecting in the last Tannhuser Rome story, singing with such a degree of conviction and abandon that the audience is being left in complete awe. Noticeable was the refined quality of the Kaufmanns diction together with a riveting delivery of the text.  The Staatskapelle Dresden offer equally stellar accompaniments, if that is the right word for it.  It is also interesting to note the reactions of some major orchestral members to the more rarely performed Grail Narration as sung by Kaufmann, as if they are hearing it for the first time.  Such was the elevated quality of both singing and orchestral playing I couldn't help wondering if these tenor scenes have ever been performed better.
The only non-Wagner work on the programme was Hans Werner Henzes Fraternit for large orchestra that the composer described as an air.  The composers death in October 2012 was probably the major reason for altering the planned performance of the orchestral score Isoldes Tod.
A truly top-notch Wagner feast.",1395014400,11,3073,5.328512396694215
