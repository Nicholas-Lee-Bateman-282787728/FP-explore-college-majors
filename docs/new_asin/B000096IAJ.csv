1880863,4,B000096IAJ,"ok, first of all i have not yet seen the dub so this is mainly on a sub review. well, wat else is there to say besides, THIS OAV ROX! omg, this will have you glued to the screen and craving for more. Ok, now for the story. Yomiko Readman is a bookworm who has a secret identity where she is part of an organisation of people with special abilities who deal with crimes that have to do with books, kinda like bookabuse. Well you'd prolly think that it sounds pretty stupid but its not. You find out that Yomiko can control paper and meets another agent named Miss Deep and its just rally cool, sorta like XMEN meets the avengers. There is so much to say but i think tat you should just visit cupped-expressions.net and then click on Yomiko's Library for a full review.",1051056000,,767,4.260273972602739
1880864,4,B000096IAJ,"I'm basing this review on the R.O.D. fansubs which have circulated, so I can't attest to the quality of the upcoming domestic release. However, if you appreciate over-the-top action you could hardly ask for a better anime than this! It has a rather Giant Robo-esque vibe, though without the actual giant robots and lacking much of the melodrama and complex backstory. What fan service there is isn't gratuitous enough to be offensive, and the insane, super-heroic action easily makes up for what the show lacks in depth and development. I found myself squealing like a little girl in disbelief at a number of scenes. Watch it and love it!",1050969600,,638,4.862385321100917
1880865,5,B000096IAJ,"The plot was pretty twisted but I liked it anyway.  Yomiko Readman, a.k.a. ""The Paper"" is a special agent who is working for the British Library, helping them to put an end to a gang of villaneous clones of made-up famous people from history bent on destroying humanity and stealing its rarest books.  Yomiko is nuts about books and reading and her superpower is that she can manipulate paper into just about anything she wants it to be.  She can cause it to become as hard as metal or she can bunch it all together to form objects ect.  She even carries a briefcase around thats full of paper(unsuspected ammo).  She teams up with another couple of special agents, including the lovely Ms. Deep whose superpower is that she can pass through solid objects.  Together they take on the evil clones. So yes, the story may seem weird but it works and thats whats important.  It was a highly enjoyable superspy romp around the world with superheroes taking out supervillians with some of the craziest diabolicol schemes ever devised.
The music in the series was awesome!  Music in an anime is very important to me, it has the ability to draw one into the story and the mood of the show.  ROD's music does just that.  Its got a kinda upbeat spy/thriller thing going.
Animation was amazing!  Extremely detailed characters and environments, beautiful colors, backdrops and clean lines.  The characters were all great, either very suave, sophisticated, mysterious, or dangerous.
Parental Guidence:  There is no nudity, only Ms. Deep cleavage.  Language if I remember correctly was mild.  Violence is moderate.  For the most part it wasn't very graphic, the worst scenes that come to mind are a bad guy getting shot in the side of the head with some sharp object.  This was shown from the front so it wasn't graphic.  Then there was a suicide scene that showed people cutting themselves and blood running all over.  Both instances happened very quickly though.  Also Ms. Deep sometimes kills by ""phasing"" through people.  I'd recommend for 13+
My only gripe with the show was that it was only 3 episodes long!  If you watch the show not knowing what its about, you may become a bit confused as I was as you are thrown straight into the meat of the story without even knowing that the characters are supposed to have superpowers.  I started out watching the show thinking Yomiko was just an ordinary book-lovin citizen and was pretty darned confused when she turned around and started fighting with paper and then I couldn't at first figure out her connection to the British Library or that she was an agent all along.  But if you read this review, you'll have a better understanding of the show before it shoots you right into the plot.  I say all this cus I almost quit watching when all these things started happening - just glad I didn't :)
On a happy note, I read in Newtype that they're coming out with a new ROD tv series in Japan and they may be keeping Yomiko in it!  I look forward to it",1050883200,14,2986,4.618595825426945

The bad guys are trying to steal one book in particular with sheet music written all over it. The song is the ""Death Symphony"" and after being heard, causes it's listener to commit suicide.

1880877,5,B000096IAJ,"This animated movie to me is a work of art. Has everything that can turn you on to cartoon girls, but also a great amount of culture for the creative individual who loves reading and music. Because the plot line of this video involves a lot of Japanese and European cultures, historical figures and items, and a great blend of both vintage styles and James Bond music.

I'm picky about which videos are among my personal favorites, there are less than 12, and Read or Die is one of them.

A situation scary enough to make the President of the US wet his pants. Left on her own Yomiko would happily spend the rest of her life and all of her money buying books to read. Unfortunately for her now she has to become Agent Paper, a super powered secret agent working for the British Library. Step aside James Bond, now Agent Paper (with the ability to make common paper do anything, and I mean ANYTHING) along with Miss Deep (with the ability to move deep through solid objects) and weapons expert Drake (who is having a bad day) are needed to save the world. If you set aside some miner plot flaws you may find this campy spy spoof a hilarious guilty pleasure like me. I love the kick ass music, action, humor, as well as what evolves into a deeply moving relationship between Yomiko and Nancy.",1287878400,,987,4.458563535911602

1880880,2,B000096IAJ,"I have to admit when I first saw this OVA showing on Adultswim I thought it was rather interesting and decided to buy it considering I didn't get to see the whole thing.

Well the first time or two I watched it I really liked it and it was rather interesting. But the more I watched it over time the more I began to more or less hate it and it started to get on my nerves.

It seemed to have very subtle but childish antics evolved who were holding a grudge of some sort. Such as the President Peeing in his pants every scene he was in. Funny? Not really. Just kinda made me angry, and I am not the politic loving or nationalistic person. It just seemed rude and immature. Well there are other things like that through out the movie...

The second topic is it is very very jumpy. They are here, and then they are there. And who the heck knows how they even have these powers? They are not explained at all. >.> Hopefully the Series actually does try to come up with some explanation otherwise that would just be rather random.

Third of all, the whole reason of everything that was going on didn't seem that particular. From all I knew the guy just was depressed and felt like it. :/ Come on what are the motivations?",1236211200,5,1217,4.210300429184549
1880881,5,B000096IAJ,"To begin with, READ OR DIE is one hell of a title - very, very cool. It's also a neat anime featuring a nerdy, bespectacled heroine, one who simply loves books, to the point of distraction, to the point where sometimes she forgets about her missions. Yomiko Readman may have just gotten hired as a substitute teacher, but her real gig is working for the British Library Special Engineer Force, the British Empire's preeminent intelligence service. Yomiko doesn't look like much. But her codename is the Paper, which has absolutely everything to do with her uncanny affinity for paper, for her ability to manipulate its shape and function. In her hands, a sheet of paper can stop a bullet cold or become a deadly weapon. Under Yomiko's influence, paper, reams of it, can transform itself into a functional human-sized glider. But, really, she'd rather read books.

A mysterious samurai figure's assault on the White House and the U.S. Library of Congress and the resulting theft of 600 invaluable manuscripts incurs a plea for help to the British Library Special Engineer Force. As such, the Paper is assigned to deal with things, along with fellow agents Miss Deep (who can phase thru solid objects) and Drake Anderson (a no-nonsense, non-powered grunt). Yomiko may not be the most reliable or unflappable of agents to handle this kind of operation, and she can't seem to stop shrieking with glee every time she espies a book she likes, but her talents very quickly prove indispensible as the agents go up against colorful, freakishly powered types (including ones who ride grasshoppers and part seas). It all seems to center on a highly coveted book titled ""Immortal Beloved,"" of which contents surely spell the extinction of mankind. I never was that big a fan of Beethoven.

Give this a chance, if you dig imaginative aerial combats and spiffy papercraft pitted against a formidable, fire-breathing monk, and if you aren't yet sick and tired of clones. These clones, by the way, are of historical and literary figures, but, honestly, I recognized only one of them. Still, it's encouraging that you really do pick up tidbits of knowledge everywhere. READ OR DIE is a wild ride, but without much of a set-up to anything, so just sit back and let this sweeping adventure carry you away. This OVA consists of three episodes and offers crisp animation, with plenty of fantastic visuals and terrific action sequences, and even a moving relationship between the sorta naive Yomiko and the hard-bitten Nancy (Miss Deep). And at three episodes, it moves at a blistering pace, with a barely coherent plot. As a result, character development does suffer; there are simply too many characters to really delve into, given the limited screen time. But you do come to care enough that when the bittersweet ending comes, you do feel it. It certainly makes me want to check out R.O.D. the TV series, which follows this one in continuity.",1230163200,,2923,4.903030303030303

1880884,4,B000096IAJ,"When I first watched this I had already seen R.O.D. the TV, the animated series in the same world as this OVA.  And since I enjoyed the series so much, I naturally had high hopes.  I must say, though, I was a bit disappointed.

The voices are different.

That bugged me quite a bit for the first half of the movie.  I was used to hearing what I thought were the perfect voices for the characters in R.O.D. the TV only to have them changed sompletely in Read or Die.  I mourned the loss of Yomiko's accent.

But after I got over that (and started changing the voices in my head) it really is an enjoyable movie.  The plot was intruiging enough, the action was well-orchestrated, and the music was fitting.  Sure, it's not as deep as Ghost in the Shell or as aloof and jazzy as Cowboy Bebop, but it has its own charm.  More than worth at least a viewing, maybe a few.

The voices won't bother you if you've never seen R.O.D. the TV.  And they might not even if you have seen it.  They're not bad--really.  They're just different and that turned me off to it at first, but I do like the movie quite a bit.  I recommend it highly.  A solid four-star anime film.  Long-live the Paper.",1208822400,,1179,4.2152466367713
1880885,5,B000096IAJ,"First of all, I must tell you that I'm not an anime fan. But I can appreciate a great piece of art when I see it. Read Or Die is one of them!

1880886,4,B000096IAJ,"To say the Yomiko Readman is an unusual secret agent is an understatement of monumental proportions. But while a bit of poetic license must be granted to make this story enjoyable, it's certainly no more than for your average James Bond flick.
If you can suspend your disbelief for an hour and a half, you'll discover a smart and exciting storyline peopled by an interesting cast of characters, backed up by superb animation. The whole enterprise has the look and the feel of the old 1960's spy shows, like ""I Spy"", with much the same batch of quirky heroes and interesting, if still irredeemably evil villains. The most interesting is Ms. Readman herself, who in spite of her incredible abilities and impressive connections, almost till the end seems to not quite understand what she's supposed to be doing. All of which adds up to a very interesting little romp which I recommend with a one precaution; mainly, don't take it too seriously, just enjoy the fun.",1185667200,,961,4.795180722891566

1880890,5,B000096IAJ,"I'm an avid anime enthusiast and I enjoy watching all of the latest anime flicks. Now and then I happened to catch a brief glimpse of the television series Read or Die on a channel called TechTV. Looked like interesting stuff but I never knew where to start... beside, from what little I knew of the plot it sounded strange so I put it on the back burner.

What a mistake I made.

First off this review is for Read or Die the movie (not the series as I haven't seen the series yet but surely the movie makes me want to). This is one of those really well made anime movies that obviously a lot of research was put into as well as a lot of time designing it so beautifully (visually that is - the animation is stunning to say the least). Not only is it beautiful but it's funny in an adorable kind of way, serious enough where you won't feel like a fool watching it if you're accustomed to more ""serious"" anime movies, and just downright creative as hell!

It's a real treasure to get an anime as creative as this one. James Bond music, meets X-Men-like characters, meets downright creative/great story with adorable laugh-out-loud moments! From the way mechanical things work in the movie to just the character-power designs... amazing the way it's handled in the movie.

I know how silly it sounds to someone reading the movie's description without having actually seen it but the storyline and characters featured in the movie just work so damn well with the movie's plot and aesthetics. I can go at great length detailing what was so great about the movie but in reality it was a perfect blend of everything! There were heartfelt moments, happy moments, cool action sequences, some sexy characters for fun and well... just about anything else you can ask for.

Some comments on here people left regarded the characters as ""flat"" or ""shallow"" in some way - that simply isn't true, as for the story it's designed well enough that it'll keep you on your feet and wanting more.

Really an amazing movie, it might just get you interested in seeing the series as well!",1131840000,4,2064,4.53494623655914
1880891,5,B000096IAJ,"I have watched this anime over and over in English and Japanese. I can't get enough of it! The art is exceptionally good, along with the story that is creative with action and suspense. And even some of the characters in it are based on real life historical figures. Such as Ms. Deep (or Nacy Makuhari) who is based on Mata Hari, the Dutch spy during WWI. The only thing I disliked about it was the scene in the  beginning where one of the Igin was blowing up the White House. That was a real disapointment. Otherwise I would definitly recommend it.",1121817600,,549,4.382352941176471
1880892,5,B000096IAJ,"Read or Die is a very original series that would be recommended for a wide variety of audiences.
The artwork, animation, characters and storyline are all very well done. I personally enjoyed it a lot.
The only elements to be questioned are certain points in the animation that would seem slighty unreasonable. Of course, these elements are what make it all the more interesting when looking forward to the conclusion.",1120780800,,417,4.9714285714285715
1880893,3,B000096IAJ,"The animation was excellent. The attention to character detail was brilliant. There were subtle touches of humor, there was sly and finely drawn character development, there was... almost no story. It's a brilliantly made, carefully crafted pile of nothing. It's hollow. Not that that's what dropped my rating; I've forgiven pretty, empty stories before on the basis of their charm.

This won't be a popular complaint, I'm afraid. I think the U.S. president was drawn with malice (and mockery) aforethought, which is the artist's right - but it's also mine not to like it, and I don't. My reaction - annoyance, disgust at the writers - snapped me out of the story, broke my absorbtion in watching. I don't like that. It smacks of clumsyness in telling the story, which is really irritating when the potential exhibited by the rest of movie was so high. And I wasn't expecting it, so I brooded on it and continued to be irked and really, it spoiled my enjoyment. If you're going to mock, I'd really prefer something either subtler or more in keeping with the feel and flow of the story. In this case their capitulating to the temptation towards mockery struck a jarring note and ruined the movie for me.

Maybe you won't care, or maybe having warning that that's in there will keep it from being a surprise that spoils it. It's still a nicely done movie - I liked the main charcter a lot, I liked how they portraied her, I liked the interactions and the characters. I was not impressed with the plot or the sillyness of their super-secret organizations. A massive British Library conspiracy could have been so much more than this...",1119916800,8,1631,4.719298245614035

1880895,3,B000096IAJ,"Having watched ROD THE TV first I was curious to know what the Read or Die ova was like, because I knew so little about Yomiko Readman and the girl called Nancy. Truth of the matter is that Read or Die is not as great a movie or three part episode OVA as everyone has been saying it was. For one fact the plot and story lines were easy to predict and not so impressive or gripping, the characters (mostly Readman) were not as interesting as they were on THE TV series. Yomiko is a very wimpish type character who is a little too naive to be considered a paper-master of great-skill. She always thinking of her books and not the mission until one of her friend's double cross her, but even then is she too wimpy a character to take seriously. Read or Die is also missing the dynamics that makes ROD THE TV so interesting in both character and storyline (which is not so easy to figure out when first watching it). Another downfall is that your hardly see Yomiko manipulate paper and when she does its more-or less five or three times. And that's when you see her fighting against the villains of a corporation called I-JIN who's origin or purpose aside from the totally obvious one is never fully explained in the tree-part episodes. There is also unnecessary profanity, over embellished death-scenes, and silly dialogue, but there enough ample action despite its choppy-sloppy ness to keep me entertained.

The plot is simplistic: Yomiko Readman --- a pack-rat and rabid book lover--- who works for the British Government in order to retrieve books or rarity and great value for a man named Mr. Gentleman. For some particular reason she along with a man named Drake, and a woman supposedly called Nancy are placed into a mission that has them searching for a rare book of Beethoven's while fending off Clone's of people of history (or that past), none of which I've heard of.

The trio fend them off for a while until they reach India where Mr. Joker (Readman's secondary boss) was supposed to have a contact for them but are ambushed by more clones (who basically too very stupid things like, puling of Moses' splitting the ocean apart and fly on a Cloud coupled with a power-pole like Goku in DBZ) and the book is ultimately taken from them due to a mishap performed by Yomiko. Mr. Joker and the British Government soon find out that their third operative, Nancy is a spy sent by I-JIN but are powerless to stop her because Yomiko steps in Drakes way helping Nancy's escape.

The two (Readman and Drake) are then sent into the I-JIN HQ to stop a missile of a 'suicide symphony' that will ultimately kill the entire human race, thus creating a paradise for the clones (Who hasn't done this). Yomiko continues to believe that Nancy is simply acting out a part and finds out she was right when she discovers a clone that took the place of her friend who is killed right in front of her eyes.

The story from there is the simple 'stop the bad-guys before its too late' premise. And at the end when Yomiko goes to visit her friend, Nancy we find out that its not Nancy but her ""sister"" who she ends up visiting. One last Major problem in this story line is that they never explain to you the name of Nancy's evil lover bent on destroying the world or who he is or why he's doing it. So the story is left with gaping holes in the plot, character, and story development.

The English voice actors in the English Dub are totally different from the one Geneon used for Yomiko, Mr. Joker, Drake, Nancy's little sister, and Wendy, which is what probably took me out of the experience of watching it with pleasure. But not even that could save this movie from the enormous plot holes and mistakes made. [a 3 out of 5]",1116633600,2,3707,4.469719350073856
1880896,5,B000096IAJ,"Such a fantastic little movie.  Read or Die is a fantastic superhero adventure, mixing elements of spy movies with comic book superhero powers.  Extremely clever as it is campy, this tour de force takes us to a world where literature matters a little too much and the most useful of weapons are sheets of paper.

Our heroine is Miss Yomiko Readman, a mousey young substitute teacher and book ethusiast.  After purchasing a rare book, Yomiko suddenly finds herself at odds against terrorists who are stealing prized books from around the world.  The storyline seems to have evolved from some B-class spy movie, where villians take on the form of deranged historic figures.  Yomiko proves to be quite an adversary, using elaborate fighting techniques by controlling scraps of paper.  In one scene, she transforms book pages into a hanglider/airplane for an aerial strike while in another scene, dollar bills are transformed into a sword.  The visuals are just as intriguing as they are hilarious.

Armed with a rolling cart full of blank notebook pages, Yomiko joins other super heros as part of ""Operation Manuscript Retrieval"", fighting of a color cast of villians like an insect-riding entomologist, a mob-boss monk and evil Beethoven.  The entire play of history, literature and classic comic book/anime action is brilliant and well put together.  In typical sci-fi/adventure style, the movie climaxes with the world on the edge of destruction, leaving the heroine with the most unlikely powers to stop it.  With such a great mix of action and humor, its obvious that the production team had just as much fun making the film as I did watching it.

I would recommend Read or Die to any Anime fan and history buff.  While there were some scenes that seemed unnecessarily gorey, the movie is action packed and has enough wit to last a lifetime.  Although, one does tend to get inspired and immediately finish reading that Faulkner book right after the credits roll.",1109462400,2,1964,4.9815950920245395

1880899,5,B000096IAJ,"OK, this anime is a tad silly.  But it is also filled with tons of action, humor and good artwork.  After watching R.O.D. TV (disc one), I had to go see what OAV started it.  The plot is super-James Bond, the characters are detailed and with such voice actors as Amanda Winn-Lee (from Plastic Little, Ghost In The Shell TV series, and Burn-Up), Tricia Dickson (from Hellsing, Spirit Of Wonder, and Haibane-Renmei) and Crispin Freeman (do I HAVE to list his work?).

If you are a fan of R.O.D. TV, of James bond movies, or just enjoy a good ""End-Of-The-World"" storyline, this is the DVD for you.  There is a link to R.O.D. TV's main character at the very start of the first episode of the OVA.  You just have to look hard enough!",1103328000,23,728,4.395522388059701
1880900,5,B000096IAJ,"I am constantly impressed with the level of animation that is coming from overseas.  I think it is because they are going places that our native animators are afraid to go.  We still see cartoons for children, where overseas they see it as a form of entertainment for both adults and children.  Why can't they see that it is a form of cinema that will and can take us to places that live-action never will, and give us characters that no actor could ever conjure up?  Who knows?  I hope that one day we get there, but until then I can sit on my comfy couch and watch amazing cinema like that of Read or Die.

To begin, this was a fantastic story.  I loved the literary references throughout the course of the film.  I loved that there was so much to see or do in the story that you never really knew where it was going to go next.  This was a very unpredictable story that left so much up to the imagination.  It was futuristic, yet somewhat present day.  There was a feeling that you were seeing on old novel opened for the first time and remastered for today's generation.  It was breathtaking, uncontrollably mesmerizing, and spellbinding to say the least.  I mentioned before about the imagination that this film held, well let me say that it flowed like water from this Read or Die.  It is hard to explain, but if you watch so much live-action cinema, it is hard to comprehend, but there was more alive in this film than I have seen in any of Spielberg's epics.  Keep in mind that I am also relatively new to the Anime genre, and probably am missing some of the better stuff, but for a newbie like myself, Read or Die was perfection in its purest form.

In live-action films I always mention the characters, and am normally nervous to mention them in animation (because it is actors voicing not really acting), but I need to applaud the animators in this film.  The way that the characters in this film carried themselves, to their facial expressions, to the intensity that they brought to the screen is equal to that of most live-actors out there.  There was enough back-story and future story for these characters that you knew them, you honestly knew them as if they were real.  This was a character-based film.  While some may argue with me on that topic, it was about friendship, love, and a desire to read and be successful.  These are not emotions that you feel or see with just simple drawings.  The animators went above and beyond their call of duty with this film, and it was demonstrated through cunning visionary and smart characters.

With a gripping story that took us all over the world (showed the vast horror that could be found, instead of just making it centralized) and characters that literally jumped out of the screen with heart-pounding animation and style, there is only one more thing to say about this film.  The action.  Growing up in a post-Matrix style film world, it is getting harder and harder to see fight sequences choreographed without the use that made The Matrix so popular.  I continually see more and more films ripping off the ""bullet-time"" effect and making their money back on just that one effect alone.  While I do realize that this was ... yet again ... a cartoon, the action in it seemed more real than in most action films.  Sly and AH-NOLD have nothing on ""The Paper"" as she uses brains and strength to outwit her opponents.  This continued to keep my attention throughout the entire film and nearly pushed me to watch it again.  I know there was something that I probably missed the first time because my jaw was stapled to the floor.  The action sequences were, for lack of a better word, beautiful.  Like a ballet gone wrong, this film stepped into the screen with simplicity, violence, and this subtle delicacy that is unmatched in American cinema today.

Overall, this was an impressive film for me.  I loved everything about it from the beginning to the end.  Again, perhaps it has something to do with my amateurish nature around Anime (which is going to change soon), but this is one of the best that I have seen.  It left me satisfied, yet with this strong desire to watch again and again.  Not many films do that to me, so it was great to see something as powerful as this pull me into the Anime world.  I cannot wait for my next adventure!

1880901,5,B000096IAJ,This was the first anime show I watched and the one that got me into anime today.  I always enjoyed anime that was involved in video games but I could not find one that caught my eye like this did.  Sure Agent Paper can be a bit extreme with her obsession for books but her character is still enjoyable and very balanced with the rest of the agents she works with and around.  I highly recommend this to anyone interested in a good well balanced anime flick.,1101081600,2,458,4.241379310344827
1880902,5,B000096IAJ,"This OVA has got to be one of my favorite animes of all time.  The story is really original when it comes down to it. efven if some of the characters aren't.  I don't think I really need to go through the whole story considering all the other reviewers who do.

some things that I feel should be cleared up for those who may not understand the story.  The story is set in the present day or very near future.  The reason for the older looking clothes adn the steam powered equipment is because the people whom the super clones are created from come from a certain era and won't modernize because they have perfected their tools for there time, so there is no need to modernize.

The next thing that seems to come up is Yomiko's powers.  The power seh has to control paper is easier for her when she is touching it. However she does not need to be touching it to create something (such as the paper airplane she forgot to put the tail on.)

And the last one people seem to be askng.  Is Yomiko a bumbling bookworm, or a ninja warrior?  the short answer is a warrior bookworm.  her personality is bookwormish but when she is on the job she can become one tough babe.  however she doesn't lose her bookworm personality.

I hope this helps clear up some of the air about this show.

spoiler warning so read only if you are confussed about the ending:

1880903,3,B000096IAJ,"R.O.D.: Read or Die is an OVA (original video animation, a straight-to-DVD) anime series. A related anime series is currently showing on Japanese TV. The three episode OVA is available on DVD in the U.S., with the first volume of the TV series coming out in the end of June on these shores. This review is of the OVA. The story follows Yomiko Readman, a bookworm with amazing powers over paper (?!) who is hired by the British Library Special Engineering Force to recover lost manuscripts. Sound boring? Well it isn't. She's joined by two other ""agents"" fighting cloned historical figures, and the show is a combination of James Bond and Fantastic Four, and manages to be action packed without taking itself too seriously.",1091318400,,722,4.830645161290323
1880904,5,B000096IAJ,"...although I notice our illustrious spotlight reviewers seem to favor that phrase.  I can't really add more information about the plot or characters than previous reviews, but there's one important point that I don't feel has been brought up yet.  All the superpowered characters in this anime are perfectly in touch with their powers, and use them to their full extent.
The Paper makes swords and clubs and shields without thinking about it, and at one point deftly bends said club into a hook to catch herself from a fall.
Ms. Deep hides inside things, reaches through things, and generally has complete mastery over when and how she is immaterial.  It does seem to require a little concentration on her part -- she does occasionally get hit -- but otherwise her grace and skill are a sight to behold.
The villains all use their quirks to full advantage on both offense and defense.  The first two minutes give us a taste of this awesome power before starting character development.  There is kung foolery, electricity, aircraft, and Zen Bhuddism (?!), all pushed to their illogical limit in pursuit of rare books.  The biographical notes are a must if you want to understand all the in-jokes with the flashy abilities they wield.
On the whole, there is no hewing and hawing with mortal conventions when superpowers would serve just as well.  Can you imagine American cartoons with heros giving 100% constantly?  Justice League episodes would be over in ten minutes; Powerpuff Girls would take five.  Read or Die nailed the apparently difficult concept of superhumans doing battle with one another.",1077408000,6,1601,4.9440298507462686
1880905,5,B000096IAJ,"""Read or Die"" is a fast-paced adventure full of paper-throwing, bullet-dodging, and literally heart-squeezing action. The story follows a substitute teacher named Yomiko Readman (and her gigantic glasses). Yomiko spends all her earnings on books, and she loves to read. One day while out shopping (for books), she finds a particularly rare tome, which she proceeds to bury her nose in. Unfortunately for her, it is snatched away from her by a grasshopper-man riding a gigantic bug the moment she steps from the store. Fortunately for her, she has the power to manipulate paper in any way she sees fit, and also happens to be standing next to a tipped-over truck carrying a load of printer paper. Needless to say, Ms. Readman is a secret agent, better known among her colleagues as ""The Paper,"" and she teams up with several other unusual characters to protect the priceless and dangerous volume from the clutches of some of history's most erratic celebrities, ranging from a German aviation pioneer to a Chinese monk who can ride clouds. As you can no doubt see by now, this is a whirlwind adventure that you can't miss.
The entire series is contained on one DVD, making it one of the cheapest whole anime series that one can buy. The downside is that ""Read or Die"" is only three episodes long, but since they were not produced for television, each one is a full thirty minutes instead of the standard twenty-one. Each episode has several exciting battle scenes mixed with quiet character and plot development scenes. The episodes can be watched like a movie, with no ""recaps"" at the beginning of the episode or previews at the end.
The soundtrack is composed by the incomparable Taku Iwasaki, who is best known for his work with ""Rurouni Kenshin: Romantic Tales from the Meiji Era."" This is music that I enjoy listening to even when not watching the series. The theme song and the general tone of the music is sort of a cross between 70's-style James Bond-esque spy show music and orchestral music, which, on the whole, came out very well. The episodes can be watched in either Japanese or English, and though I usually advise watching the subtitled Japanese version, R.O.D.'s American voice acting is very well done for a dub.
The biggest gripe I had with ""R.O.D."" was the fact that all the writing was in Japanese except for three specific instances, yet the story took place exclusively in London, New York City, India, and over the Aegean Sea. Still, that's not a very big problem, and didn't really affect my overall impression of ""R.O.D."" On the plus side, all the architectural drawing was very accurate, for instance the shot of the British Museum (a real place, I've been there) was astoundingly similar to the real thing, and althought they never call it the British Museum by name, it was instantly recognizable.
Overall, ""Read or Die"" was a terrific piece of work. The art was amazing, the humor was absolutely perfect, and the general feel of the series was exciting. From the twisting plotline to the unforgettable characters, ""Read or Die"" was an amazing piece of work, perfect for anyone with a sense of adventure and especially well-suited to otaku or those with an appreciation for terrific animation... a definite thumbs-up.",1074988800,3,3244,4.846846846846847
1880906,2,B000096IAJ,"This OAV was an anime I really looked forward to viewing.  Unfortunately, the promising premise was undercut by flaws too sizable and numerous to overlook.
The story focuses mostly on two characters, Yomiko and Nancy.  They`re the only `good guys` who have extraordinary powers, and the nature of these powers is very similar to those displayed by Marvel`s X-men.  First off, we have the main character, Yomiko Readman, aka The Paper.  She can manipulate paper to effects ranging from mundane to deadly (think Magneto`s ability with magnetism).  The combination of the element involved, paper (which is hardly your usual super-hero material), and Yomiko's nebbish, librarian, yet compelling demeanor make for a winning character rather than the feel of a rip-off that might have easily occurred.  Then there`s Nancy Makuhari, aka Miss Deep, who can phase through any and all matter with moves that rival Nadia Comaneci (think Shadowcat, aka Kitty Pride, with Nightcrawler`s gymnastic ability).
The first incongruity we come across regarding agent Yomiko is her level of experience with, and working for, British intelligence.  When she first meets Miss Deep, she introduces herself using her real name.  Deep admonishes her for this rookie mistake.  But Yomiko isn`t supposed to be a rookie.  Her familiarity with the upper brass is evident.  She`s a known quantity in British Intelligence and is being tapped for a very important assignment that has implications for international diplomacy as well as military and security objectives.
Secondly, the extent of her ability to manipulate paper appears inconsistent.  The show can`t make up its mind if she can control paper that`s simply nearby, or if she has to be in contact with the paper, along with any sheets touching the first.  In one life-and-death situation, she is bound, and cannot manipulate the paper ribbon in her braided hair until she can grasp it with her teeth.  Yet in another scene, she can control pieces of paper floating around her without making contact with them, either directly or via other paper.  The first case itself seems rather odd; since the paper ribbon is in her hair, she is technically already touching it (even though it was tied by Miss Deep).  Perhaps once she has touched a piece of paper, she can manipulate it ever after by proximity (at one point we do see her flipping through a stack of currency). But that still wouldn`t explain the former case above. Even if this is true, why reach for, grab, and then throw paper that she's obviously already touched from a briefcase, instead of just commanding it to fly on it`s own? I`m sure there`s some rational explanation for these apparent variances, but one can't escape the feeling that her ability is dictated by whatever the director needs at the moment to create the desired dramatic effect.
Third, is Yomiko a bumbling bookworm, or a ninja warrior?  For the most part, Yomiko behaves as someone more likely than most to trip over or bang into something out of clumsiness, or inattentiveness.  Yet she holds her own in battles with master samurai.  If she doesn`t understand the basics (never give your real name in an operation), how did she manage to hone her martial arts skills to such a degree?
There are some problems in directing as well.  In one shot involving the Statue of Liberty, everything happens in normal speed?except for Yomiko, who is suspended in mid-air, coat flapping, seemingly going slow motion, left-to-right in a straight line.  There`s nothing to keep her from falling, which she eventually does in the next shot.  I`m surprised this got passed the editing process.
The show also has the rather annoying habit of shuttling you from place to place without any indication of travel, or identification of the new location.  With a little thought, one can suss out soon enough what has happened, but time has to be spent wondering exactly where you are now? Japan, Britain, or Washington?
One other thing that bothers me. The story seems reluctant to define the era in which it takes place. There are steam powered contraptions from the 1800s, clothes from the 1920s, conveyance systems from the 40s, manual typewriters from the 50s, James Bond style music from the 70s, computer monitors and satellite imagery from the 90s, genetic replication technology that hasn?t been invented yet, just to name a few.  Half way through the first episode, I found myself wishing that they would choose a time period and stick with it.
Yet even given all this, it`s definitely not a complete waste of time.  As others have pointed out, the story is engaging enough, the characters interact in an interesting manner, and the artwork is very pleasant. Yomiko`s character has a child-like sincerity that`s devoid of cynicism, coupled with a hard-core tenacity to accomplish her mission.  It`s a difficult combination that comes off in spades and saves the show.  We quickly come to really like and care about Yomiko.
Even though Read or Die has been somewhat overhyped, it is still worth a look.  I would recommend seeing it before buying.  This anime had the potential to be an immediate buy-off-the-shelf keeper, but the gaps and incontinuites lessened what should have been an excellent show.",1065484800,14,5247,4.998850574712644

1880913,5,B000096IAJ,"Read or Die is a breath of fresh air amid the anime releases in the United States: it manages to combine high quality on the technical side with interesting, likeable characters and an interesting story.  First off, this is obviously a high-budget production: these three episodes (which is the complete Read or Die direct-to-video series) sport character designs which are attractive, animation which is top-notch, and great sound and music.  Moreover, Manga, the studio releasing Read or Die in the US did a wonderful authoring job on the DVD, in contrast to some of their releases (e.g., Macross II).  On the technical side, Read or Die simply screams quality.
Fortunately, that quality is matched by the quirky, likeable characters and the quirkier plot.  The heroine, Yomiko Readman, is a book-obsessed woman with the power to manipulate paper  (which is far more interesting than it may sound).  She is also a secret agent for the British Library.  When cloned historical figures try to steal her newest book purchase and destroy the world, she is assigned to stop them.  Yomiko is the most interesting heroine of the last several years of anime releases: she is a woman, not a girl; she is not overly sexualized; she is capable and strong without pride or arrogance.
The only real flaw in Read or Die is that, because it's only 3 episodes long, the weird little plot is somewhat opaque.  Moreover, many of the historical figures will not be familiar to a US audience, but this is a quibble, really.  The show is not about the villains or their purposes, it is about Yomiko and hers.",1054252800,19,1589,4.830258302583026
1880914,4,B000096IAJ,"R.O.D. (READ OR DIE) is quite an imaginative and delightful three-episode Japanese OAV (Original Animated Video) series that deftly mixes sci-fi, adventure, comedy, history and a love of rare books. Made in 2000, it's set against a marvelously detailed background of urban settings like Tokyo, Washington DC, and New York, along with the massive Victorian-style (but secretly high-tech) British Library headquarters, as well as a diverse fleet of retro-style aircraft and seacraft. Overall, it offers the kind of fresh, unpredictable and literate entertainment that caters to the restless tastes of the more discriminating anime fans in America.

The heroine is a 20-something woman named Yomiko Readman, a shy, self-effacing bookworm who is a teacher and obsessive collector of rare books. She traipses about in a long skirt and overcoat, lugging a large briefcase behind her on a wheeled cart everywhere she goes, even when chasing super-villains. She's also a secret agent known as ""The Paper"" who has the extraordinary power of turning any kind of paper product into a lethal weapon or protective barrier. One of the special thrills of this series is the way this talent is used so often to ingenious effect in the course of the three episodes. When the Library of Congress is attacked and robbed by a famous Japanese inventor cloned back to life, Yomiko is assigned by the British Library to retrieve the stolen books. The enemy is soon revealed to be much wider in scope and encompasses a host of other historical figures brought back to life, including a certain famed composer. World domination is not their aim but something much more sinister.
The plot is rather complex, but never wavers off track as the action moves from Tokyo to D.C. to New York (including a harrowing scene at a pre-9/11 World Trade Center) in the first episode alone, venturing to India in the second, and to a massive techno-fortress which rises out of the central Pacific Ocean in the third. The writing is consistently clever, the heroine relentlessly charming and the characters and multiple historical references always intriguing. There's also an elaborate title sequence that's the best seen in any anime since ""Cowboy Bebop,"" along with a jazzy early-'70s style-TV theme that gives it some added color. The release of all three episodes on one DVD is a welcome signal of the possible resurgence of the OAV format, which allows for limited-run series of various lengths like this one.",1051488000,86,2474,5.078624078624078
