8101106,4,B000CRR338,Another favorite of mine.  Saw it years ago and pleased to see it again.,1424649600,,72,4.142857142857143
8101107,3,B000CRR338,"Story Line is lame, but I am a geologist and well sometimes watching a movie that does not follow true geology is entertaining. Actors did a fine job but man the story line needs some work!",1402963200,,189,4.277777777777778
8101108,5,B000CRR338,"This was some kind of movie, it was very different and Vincent Spano is the best, there is not much else to say but great.",1384819200,,122,3.92
8101109,2,B000CRR338,"Considering the premise has already been utilized in a movie called AVALANCHE, this little movie isn't all that bad but it's far from classic cinema.

A new condominium complex is endangered by irresponsible blasting and since there is a villain out to keep his name clean, the resulting landslide is not a surprise.  Once again, we have a hero who is estranged from his wife and son, and a corporate biggie who is the wife's daddy, too.  Everything pretty much goes as expected and unfortunately the special effects are pretty inadequate.

For disaster movie freakos, this one's passable.",1169856000,4,589,4.979591836734694
8101110,4,B000CRR338,This movie starts out a little slow for the first thirty minutes but in the middle it really starts to take off. There is a lot of action and suspence and it leaves you on the edge of your seat the whole time! Great ending and worth seeing!!,1169596800,2,241,4.041666666666667
8101111,2,B000CRR338,"At least 3 times I have started watching this Buried Alive movie,... it is just so dumb and so boring I stop and eject it every time. I agree with another reviewer-this movie must be filled with Soap Opera actors/B Movie stars. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It is slow and I suppose there is some moral there but I am not sure what. I saw a review of this movie where it is referred to as 4 obituaries,... which must say a lot about the plot and signifigance of it. Well enough said. You review it if you want to waste time.",1167350400,,540,4.05607476635514
8101112,3,B000CRR338,"After wathching 10.5 this disaster movie brought me back to earth real quick..

It was watcheable but played more like a soap opera with all these sub-plots.

Buy it second hand....",1167177600,,181,4.806451612903226
