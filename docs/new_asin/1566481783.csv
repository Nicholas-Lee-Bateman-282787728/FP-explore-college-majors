7796729,4,1566481783,I lived in Switzerland for several months. This video provides a realistic overview of some of the great destinations of this beautiful country.,1392422400,2,144,5.304347826086956
7796730,5,1566481783,"I really enjoyed seeing the places in the Fall and Winter that I had visited in the Spring. The Lucerne Transportation museum has a lot more than what Richard Bangs showed. If you have a chance to see it you will not be disappointed. In his other movie on Switzerland he spends time describing and showing the bridge over the river and other sites. What is missing are views of the old fortress wall, Rococo churches, and the painted scenes on exterior walls in the squares. Why? Probably because it doesn't fit his desire to impress you with his command of the English language and knowledge of writers that he name drops repeatedly. That was the part that got old quickly.

There are some great views of the trains climbing Pilatus and the Jungfrau. The segment on the Matterhorn was very well done along with his historical explanation of how Switzerland went from being disdained to being a sought after vacation location. It is his other movie which tells the historical significance of the wounded lion monument to the Swiss soldiers killed defending Louis XVI.

I hope that Bangs will make a 4th movie covering the northern and western parts of Switzerland which are uniquely historical and photogenic. I also recommend his other Swiss movies ""Geneva & Matterhorn"" and ""Basel & Lucerne"".",1335052800,,1294,4.824324324324325

Richard quotes poets and philosophers, as, sometime in the last 200 years, people stopped being afraid of the mountains and started seeing them as beautiful. The scenery is awesome in several places, and Switzerland itself and the Swiss, are also beautiful. I suggest buying the Blu-Ray version actually, as it was shot in HD and I'm sure it's worth it.

The extras I like too; perhaps as much as the main feature. The behind-the-scenes stuff just makes you feel more like you are there.",1328832000,3,637,4.587719298245614
