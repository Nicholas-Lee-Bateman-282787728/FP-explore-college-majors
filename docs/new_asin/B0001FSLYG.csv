8011922,5,B0001FSLYG,"For anyone who remembers Beirut pre-destruction, this is a must. It's cold war at it's peak, and every performance is 4 star. It entails the U. S. Embassy which is embroiled in the defection of a top Soviet official (Max Von Sydow) who must be protected until he can be slipped out of the country. The Christians were fighting the Muslims at the time of filming, but the city was realatively intact. Richard Roundtree and Broderick Crawford standout as Security, with an excellent ensemble. Filmed entirely on site with an Insurance Company building serving as the Embassy.",1243209600,2,573,4.917525773195877
