7834254,5,6303025633,"I have all 110 episodes recorded off the tv of Northern Exposure but this one was particularly relatable for any woman or man who still feels the need to ""please"" their parent who makes them CRAZY!  Maggie's mom  comes to Cicely and Maggie isn't happy with her overly critical parent.  I  love the scene at the beginning when the mother, played by Bibi Besch,  comes into Maggie's cabin the first time and rearranged the flowers that  Maggie had put out!  My mom does that ALL the time and I have learned to go  with it and change it later.  Accidently, Mrs. O'Connell burns down Mags  house and she wanders about homeless.  Chris, seeking to fling a cow in  one of his existential insights of angst, asks to use Mags piano after Ed  tells him that a cow was flung by Monty Python. Chris uses a trepuche, a  midevel catapult to FLING the burned out thing bringing a fantastic show  for the people of Cicely and a cathartic closure to Maggie.  Outsome  footage of the ""fling"" in slow motion! ""It's not the thing  you fling, it's the fling itself"",declares Chris.  This episode  reminded me to finish what you start and that endurance in the face of a  tragedy is the key to surviving the wilds of Alaska.  A GREAT episode!
