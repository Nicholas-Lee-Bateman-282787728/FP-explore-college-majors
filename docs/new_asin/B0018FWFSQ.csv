It has real life application. It is simple to apply, everything you want and need when facing multiple opponents.",1427587200,3,254,4.666666666666667
8683829,5,B0018FWFSQ,"As well as his other DVDs and books, Tudjan succeds where many others have failed, and that is in having the ability to realistically demonstrate real life threats and your options to get out of them unharmed when facing multiple opponents. Do not hesitate to watch this one.",1275523200,2,275,4.75
8683830,1,B0018FWFSQ,"I don't own this video. I watched a Youtube clip of it and from that I know its a waste of time. This video shows  Tudjan fighting one person at a time. There are 3 people that are suppose to be attacking him but they all politely wait their turn to attack. Then Tudjan pushes one away sort of swatting at each of them in a girly way then runs around in a circle. Strange and silly. I doubt this Tudjan has ever really been in any sort of real street fight. Let me just say no one waits politely for their turn to stab at you or hit you with a pipe. Slapping at people and running in a circle won't help you much either. LOL
There is a clip in the video showing Tudjan pushing a gun down and away from his abdomen bringing his thigh and femoral artery in to the line of fire. Being shot in the abdomen is dangerous but less dangerous than a hit to the femoral artery a wound like that will bleed out faster than any one could get you to a hospital.",1275004800,,948,3.9633507853403143
8683831,5,B0018FWFSQ,Having to go up against multiple opponents always leaves you at a great disadvantage. This systeem shows you ways to minimize your disadvantages while maximizing your advantages. This is presented in a realistic way by Mr. Tudjan who is wel spoken and presents his systeem in an easy to understand manner. I would reccomend this DVD to anyone who may find themselves confronting overwhelming odds as well as the martial arts enthusiast who want to broaden thier knowledge. I am looking forward to Mr. Tudjans next DVD and hopefully a book as well.,1209340800,3,547,4.89247311827957
