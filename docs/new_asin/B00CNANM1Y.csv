5731246,5,B00CNANM1Y,"We are loving this workout! I love that it is low impact. I tried a workout that I did pre pregnancy but all the jumping was killer on this nursing mama! This was enjoyable and easy to follow along with. I especially loved doing it with my babe. She was notorious at waking up when i was trying to exercise but now she gets to help, whether she's awake or not! Exercising with my babe is an awesome way to keep motivated! I would definitely recommend!",1367625600,2,451,4.255813953488372

8583721,4,B00CNANM1Y,"Very amateur. Quality of filming is low. But, she works hard and is supportive. Also great for starting to exercise again after baby.",1422316800,,133,4.826086956521739
8583722,5,B00CNANM1Y,"I love the workout and so does my little trainer. Its a lot of fun, easy to do and its gentle on my horrible, horrible knees. I can feel the burn after performing this workout.

The Pros:
It really does encourage you to get up, get moving and burn some calories. It will continue to challenge you as your baby gains weight making the workout more difficult. It really works!

The Cons:
There's only one workout. I wish there were a few different ones just for variety to change things up. The audio quality isn't too hot either but I usually play some workout music over the video anyway.",1392249600,,588,4.385321100917431
8583723,5,B00CNANM1Y,"I love this video because it is gentle enough for a postpartum mama but I can feel it building strength and boosting my heart rate. I don't care how fit you were before pregnancy (I was somewhat fit myself), late pregnancy and childbirth are very difficult on the body and require very slow, gradual reintroduction to exercise. This workout is light on the ab work but still strong on the core strengthening and allows a woman to gain strength gradually while dropping the pounds quickly (as part of a breastfeeding regimen and a healthy 2500 calorie diet).

Pros:
It's short, which means I have no problem motivating myself to do it.
I don't have to worry about the baby needing my attention and distracting me from my workout - she never makes a peep while I'm wearing her!
As stated, gentle yet challenging.
Requires no equipment. (Unless you don't have an appropriate baby carrier, in which case GO GET ONE, it will change your life!)
Your weight increases as you get stronger.
There's a facebook community to help motivate and connect with other moms!

Cons:
It's only one workout, so I need to ""cross train"" my body by taking walks and doing my mommy & me yoga on non-TBWW days.
The video quality leaves a little to be desired and there are some distracting background noises. I can't wait for the next version with lots of moms wearing different carriers!",1368230400,,1362,4.670833333333333
8583724,5,B00CNANM1Y,I really am liking this video. It's low impact but gives your arms and legs a great workout! And it really does knock out your little one! She has fallen asleep twice while working out!!,1367884800,,186,4.3428571428571425
8583725,5,B00CNANM1Y,"The workout is simple, using your own body weight and baby as extra.  The movements are gentle, so they don't jar baby too much.  By the end, I feel like I've really used my muscles and my 18 month old is sleeping!  He really gets the giggles during a couple of exercises, and loves to try and do them with me.  It's a lot of fun to ""work out together"".",1367798400,,353,4.0
8583726,5,B00CNANM1Y,Absolutely love being able to workout with my baby and this video helps with just that!  An added bonus... My babe falls asleep every time and takes a great nap afterward!  Definitely recommend this video to all mamas!,1367625600,,218,4.7105263157894735
8583727,5,B00CNANM1Y,"I very much enjoyed the Baby Wearing Workout. I started using it when my daughter was seven months old and about 16 pounds, and it really helped me to kick-start my weight loss. While I would definitely incorporate additional forms of exercise (such as going for walks with your baby in a carrier, yoga, or other workout videos), TBWW is great for women whose babies need constant care and cannot go to the gym as a result. It's fast, you can feel the muscle burn but isn't too strenuous for a new mother, and - this may be the best part - your baby will most likely fall asleep before the end of the video! I've lost twenty pounds in the last four months, and it is largely in part to TBWW and just baby-wearing in general. Thanks, Kelli!",1367625600,,739,4.323741007194244
8583728,5,B00CNANM1Y,I've been struggling with finding the time to do any exercising since I wear our babe a lot.  Finding the video was perfect.  Low impact but killer (in a good way) for arms and legs. His weight helps to add to my workout tremendously.  Bonus: he falls asleep every time!,1367625600,,270,4.36
8583729,5,B00CNANM1Y,"I do this workout before my baby's nap time and she usually falls sleep before we finish it, sleeping better and she is more happy, the workout has helped me get active and I am looking forward shaving some pounds! I can do it in my own time (no need to rush for a class at the gym) my own space, and I have actually done it in the park a couple of times, simply love it!",1367625600,,371,3.831168831168831
