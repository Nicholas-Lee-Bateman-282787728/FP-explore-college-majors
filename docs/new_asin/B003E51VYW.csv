4113049,4,B003E51VYW,"The Freemasons are a fascinating subject to me.  The mystery surrounding the Freemasons just seems so suspicious.  What do they have to hide?  This DVD is very interesting because it shows you the Grand Lodge in England, and gives plenty of information, much of it given freely by the Freemasons themselves.",1353283200,,307,4.980392156862745
4113050,4,B003E51VYW,"While I am not a Freemason, I have relatives who were, and so this subject has always interested me.  I like this DVD because it presents facts, and it shows a glimpse of their private world.  Seeing the Grand Lodge in England is very cool for many reasons--it is beautiful first of all, and also it has meaning for me on a personal level.  This was definitely worth my time.",1353283200,,375,4.328571428571428
4113051,1,B003E51VYW,"What a waste of money! Totally boring. Nothing but on screen interviews that go on way too long. Nothing new. Poorly done.
Waste of time and money. Don't buy.",1348012800,3,158,4.482758620689655
4113052,1,B003E51VYW,"As a Mason I am interested in all things Masonic. This DVD however was a big waste of money. The actual filming was done with one camera which very rarely zoomed in or out, or moved in any way. Im going to guess the camera was a top of the line Sony made in 1986! They obviously used one microphone centered somewhere between them as the audio quality was poor also. Although other reviews speak about the fascinating interior of the Grand Lodge of England the viewer sees very little of it as the camera is literally centered on the two hosts approximately 85% of the time. The interviewer an obvious amateur, giggles and laughs her way through her script bringing nothing of interest to the table other than her long blonde hair. She asked several stupid questions that have nothing to do with unfolding interview and quite frankly doesnt speak well of her maturity or intelligence. John Hamill as usual does a fine job of explaining what he can but unfortunately he is lead down this road of a one hour interview which is extremely boring to say the least. If you are looking for a one on one interview with some interesting facts thrown in every once and a while this DVD is for you! If your are looking for a DVD that gives a detailed view using multiple camera shots with a camera capable of a view greater than 10 feet from side to side, this isn't your cup of tea. Very poorly produced and filmed, I give it a thumbs down!",1337904000,7,1430,4.4
4113053,4,B003E51VYW,"""Inside The Freemasons: The Grand Lodge Uncovered"" is not what its cover-art suggests. It is not a conspiracy film, shrouded to the familiar secrets. It is not an overwhelming documentary, meant to titillate instead of inform. It is instead an earnest look into one of the most misunderstood (and yet ultimately intriguing) groups in the world: the Freemasons.

Spanning the years, ""Inside The Freemasons"" seeks to educate viewers on the truth; not the all too easy mysteries. The order is offered honestly, with explanations from its members and glimpses into its Grand Lodge. Through this, even those with just a casual interest in history will find themselves drawn in. It will please.

And, though not all questions will be answered (that would never be possible), the film manages to avoid exaggerating its material. It's instead handled respectfully and, for this, viewers will be grateful.",1277164800,11,896,5.215277777777778
4113054,4,B003E51VYW,"Inside The Freemasons is, surprisingly and perhaps refreshingly, not a conspiracy film. It is a sober and highly informative presentation of contemporary Freemasonry by John Hamill, chief officer of the Grand Lodge of England, and goes a long way to explain what Freemasonry has stood for throughout history and how it stands in society today. Those whose interest in Freemasonry goes beyond conspiracy theory will learn a great deal about why five million people around the world choose to belong to this fraternal order and why Mr. Hamill chooses to describe the non-public aspects of Masonic ritual as ""private"" rather than ""secret.""",1275264000,3,636,5.245098039215686
4113055,4,B003E51VYW,"I was hesitant to watch this film, only because I wasn't sure how interesting a tour of the Grand Lodge would actually be. Naturally, like most books and films relating to the Freemason society, this film proved equally fascinating. I was pleasantly surprised by how much information was revealed and enjoyed the tour thoroughly. The pace of the tour was steady and John Hammill, the Communications Director of the United Grand Lodge of England, was an excellent guide, providing background and revealing the symbolism behind motifs along the way. Perhaps it is a testament to Hammill's ability as a host or perhaps it is the mystery behind the subject matter, but my curiosity and interest remained constant throughout the duration of the film.",1274832000,2,745,5.065040650406504
4113056,4,B003E51VYW,"Maybe I was a Freemason in a past life, which is the only way I could explain my great interest in this subject.  In fact, one of my hobbies is cemetery-hunting and I love going around and finding all the old graves that have the Freemason motif on them.  I tend to wonder what the lives of these now-dead men were like.

Consider this set of DVDs your own personal tour into the world of the Freemasons.  The curtain has been lifted from the Great Lodge and we're granted a close-up view of its history, rules, and those who have been in it through time.  Wait until you see this Freemasons Hall in London!  There's nothing modern about it.  Instead, the lodge rooms are old and magnificent, and the museum holds many interesting pieces worn by previous members.  John Hamill also explains quite well all of the symbolism and rites that are associated with this ""secret club.""  I greatly enjoyed Inside the Freemasons: The Grand Lodge Uncovered.",1271721600,8,946,4.616766467065868
4113057,4,B003E51VYW,"This is like one of those New Yorker articles on some obscure subject you're sure you're not interested in, but once you start reading, you find it fascinating.  In this case it's an expanded interview and tour of Freemason's Hall, London, led by the very articulate John Hamill, the Head Officer of the United Grand Lodge of England.  While learning the history and credo of the Freemasons, we see the incredible rooms of the lodge, done in an Art Deco motif, harkening back to both Egypt and King Solomon.  As you would expect, there's a great deal of iconography and symbolism embedded everywhere, which Hamill explains in detail.  Some of the rooms are awe-inspiring, others look like set-decoration out of 30s B-movie.  In the museum are the regalia and medals worn by Masons through history, including Winston Churchill's Masonic apron.",1271548800,8,842,4.985714285714286
