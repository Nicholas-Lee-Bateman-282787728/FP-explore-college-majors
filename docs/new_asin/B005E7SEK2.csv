4663729,4,B005E7SEK2,"The story of one woman who basically destroyed the lives of the men around her.  This movie was beautifully shot.  It takes you back to a lost time.  The princess was taken from her first love to be married off to a prince.  Honestly, the Prince was a decent guy except for his well-deserved jealousy.  The addition of his servant/teacher falling in love with her was a little disjointed but overall it was a very enjoyable movie.  It is in French and does have subtitles so if that's not your thing, you might want to pass.",1322265600,8,524,4.40625

4663731,4,B005E7SEK2,"""The Princess of Montpensier"" was adapted from the 1662 French novella written by Madame de La Fayette, widely regarded as a roman &agrave; clef. In order to hide the identities of her subjects, the author set the story during the Wars of Religion a century earlier. The story begins in 1567. Franois, Count of Chabannes (Lambert Wilson) has deserted the Huguenot cause because he can no longer tolerate the barbarity of war, leaving him banished by both sides of the conflict. He seeks and receives the protection of the Duke of Montpensier (Michel Vuillermoz), whose son Philippe, Prince of Montpensier (Gr&eacute;goire Leprince-Ringuet) will keep him until the King's anger subsides.

It is arranged for Philippe to marry Marie de M&eacute;zi&egrave;res (M&eacute;lanie Thierry), a young woman with a sizable dowry who happens to be in love with a daring soldier and war hero, her cousin Henri, Duke of Guise (Gaspard Ulliel). On her mother's advice, Marie accepts the marriage and becomes the Princess of Montpensier. But Marie is a willful woman who delights in the attentions she receives from men. Henri seems still to desire her, and a new rival for her attention has forced himself into the picture: The King's brother, the Duke of Anjou (Raphal Personnaz), likes to flatter Marie and incite her husband's jealousy as well, as the Wars rage on.

It's a soap opera that could have been shorter. Long conversations that are not strictly necessary for character or plot development slow the film down. But there is emotional substance. Philippe's jealousy and hurt feelings at his wife's flirtations are sympathetic. Marie is in an unenviable position, perhaps, if she loves a man whom she cannot have. But that is a common predicament, then and now. She is selfish, willful, and vacillates between trying to do the right thing for her family and her own future and throwing caution and everyone's reputation to the wind. I can't say that I found her or the object of her desire sympathetic. M&eacute;lanie Thierry projects her vivacity and pride well, though.

Director Bertrand Tavernier made some changes to the novella in order to properly place the story in the 16th century, as it was written in the 17th century, during the reign of Louis XIV, and embodies the later sensibilities and mores. What is a historical drama to the French looks a lot like a fairy tale to foreigners. But these social intrigues were, in all likelihood, real, and the bloodshed was certainly real. There is a good deal of swordplay. It's an epic historical romance but, like the Wars against which it plays, the rivalries are messy, and we are not sure who should win. In French with optional English, English SDH, and Spanish subtitles.

The DVD (MPI 2011): Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (2 min) and 3 interviews. ""Interview with Historical Advisor Didier Le Fur"" (10 min) is worthwhile. Mr. Le Fur discusses Protestants and Catholics in France at the time the film takes place, the views of life and death and how they translated into behavior, some military history, and social history.

4663733,5,B005E7SEK2,"Basing a long film on a short story is usually a risk; the story often runs thin before the long film is complete. This is most assuredly NOT the case in Bertrand Tavernier's decision to adapt (with Franois-Olivier Rousseau) the short story 'La Princesse de Montpensier' written by Marie de LaFayette (1634 - 1693) and published anonymously in 1662. Of note, La Fayette's most famous novel was 'La Princesse de Clves' (1678), first published anonymously in March 1678. An immense success, the work is often taken to be the first true French novel and a prototype of the early psychological novel. This film is one that both entertains in the manner of the great epics of the screen, but also teaches us about the religious differences between the Catholic and the Huguenots (Prostestants) during the 16th century while at the same time addressing from a near feminist point of view the manners of courtly versus passionate love in that fascinating period.

Very briefly, Princesse Marie de Montpensier (Mlanie Thierry) is married to Prince Philippe de Montpensier (Grgoire Leprince-Ringuet) in a marriage of convenience arranged by Marie's father: the rare beauty of Marie attracts the attention of all men, a fact that drives Philippe to rages of unfounded jealousy. France is in the midst of religious war and Philippe is off at war with his tutor Comte de Chabannes (Lambert Wilson): after a particularly grueling battle in which Comte de Chabannes kills a pregnant woman and a child he informs Philippe that he can no longer stomach war and asks to return to the palace where he will continue being the tutor of Marie in Philippe's absence. Marie and Chabannes become close as he teaches her to read and write - during which time Chabannes secretly falls in love with Marie. But there are other men who would woo her: Duc d'Anjou (Raphal Personnaz)- the youngest son of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici (Christine Brcher), the man history books have described as gay and who courted England's Elizabeth I unsuccessfully, and Marie's childhood friend, the handsome but battle-scarred Henri de Guise (Gaspard Ulliel). The story successfully eaves the course of the war between the religious factions and the drives and promises and desires of the four men to win the affection of Marie. Court intrigues, duels, secret meetings and the power of nobility push the story to a surprising but well designed end; passion of the heart can be destructive.

Mlanie Thierry is brilliant as Princess Marie de Montpensier and is supported by equally fine performances by Wilson, Ulliel, Personnaz, Leprince-Ringuetand a very strong supporting cast. The period costumes and customs are perfectly realized, the cinematography by Bruno deKeyser and the musical score by Philippe Sarde enhance the rich tapestry of this Tavernier masterpiece.

I saw this at a film festival and was crushed knowing that this will probably be the only time I get to see it but I was wrong. Can't wait to have this in my collection and extremely encourage everyone else to see it. You will NOT be disappointed.

4663736,5,B005E7SEK2,"Love it, love it, love it.  The acting, the cinematography, the costumes...

Most swashbucklers - let's say ""The Three Musketeers"" - feature sizzling action, romance, treachery...but in the end they are little else but entertainment. This one is a fable of misguided passion.

Marie, the beautiful woman of the tale, becomes the object of desire of four men.  The first is her childhood sweetheart, the second is her husband, the third is a prince, and the fourth is a count who is commissioned to educate her.  This is a man's world, and they all attempt to woo Marie to become their prize...but she will not offer her love to anyone but her first object of desire.

The events are placed in the context of a religious war between the Catholics and the Protestants in 16th century France.  Perhaps the most interesting character, the moral center of the film, is the Count of Chabannes - a man who renounces violence after killing a pregnant woman. He becomes disillusioned about killing others just for religious differences.  He is one of the men most attracted to Marie, not just for her beauty, but particularly for her spirit and intelligence.  But she refuses to take his desire seriously - because she is in thrill of her own passions for another man, one other than her husband.

The film received little press here in the United States...but it is a wonderful tale, with many layers of meaning.  The director exhibits great attention to historical detail. The film shows that a wedding night was actually observed by the family of the pair, a custom to insure the virginity of the bride.  Another historical item is that the battles are fought by men on different sides who wear no distinctive uniform. Obviously, that would make identifying your ""enemy"" more difficult.

Taken as a whole, it was one of my favorities in 2011.",1315612800,56,1836,4.79047619047619

4663746,1,B005E7SEK2,"Based on the novel, and involving many of the same characters from Reine Margot, this nonetheless felt like an immensely inferior version. The main character is not developed at all, and it is hard to believe that virtually every man in sight falls in love with her (I presume she must be the Director's type, as she is left to do a lot of just standing there and looking pouty). The violence is graphic - and this was indeed a violent period of French history, but I am sure would offend many. The script is tedious. The sets and costumes are very, very disappointing. Dull. They certainly do not capture the glamor of the Valois court and the country scenes are wholly inaccurate. Renaissance princes did not live like country farmers. It's quite long and this was such hard going, I could hardly finish the movie. I love historical films, so my disappointment was huge.",1395705600,2,872,4.632258064516129

4663769,5,B005E7SEK2,"Bertrand Tavernier's ""The Princess of Montpensier"" is a dazzling romantic tragedy, intelligently written, directed, and acted. Set in France at the time of the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, it tells the story of Marie de Montpensier (Melanie Thierry), the wife of Philippe (Gregoire Leprince-Ringuet). Her family married her off to Philippe to create a beneficial family alliance, despite Marie's burning passion for Henri, Duc de Guise (Gaspard Ulliel). The expected tragedy results, though its arc is not quite what the audience might expect.

Throughout the film, Tavernier shows far greater attention to nuances of character than is typical for what is, essentially, a romantic swashbucker. This is only to be expected of Tavernier, who must be considered one of France's greatest directors. No French director has ever had so broad a range, going from ""A Sunday in the Country"" and ""Round Midnight"" to ""Daddy Nostalgia"" and ""It All Starts Today."" Historical romances have been a staple of Tavernier's output since ""Let Joy Reign Supreme,"" and ""The Princess of Montpensier"" may well be his best work in that genre.

Thierry, Ulliel, and Leprince-Ringuet are all excellent. For me, however, the two best performances are by Raphael Personnaz as the witty, cynical Duc D'Anjou (the future Henri III) and Lambert Wilson as the brave, world-weary Comte de Chabannes, who essentially serves as the story's moral conscience.  Graced with resplendent photography by Bruno de Keyser and thrilling music by Philippe Sarde, ""The Princess of Montpensier"" is an excellent film of its kind. If you liked ""Queen Margot"" or ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre,"" you'll like this.",1379462400,,1661,5.3320610687022905

4663771,5,B005E7SEK2,"Admittedly, this is not for everyone. I happen to be a fan of historical fiction, and of French history, so this is my cup of tea.

That said, this is a well-crafted movie based on a short novel by the author of Princess of Cleves, which as far as I know is still required reading for any well-educated French person.

This story is set a few years after the events of Princess of Cleves, and centers on another  princess, originally promised to  one man (Henri, Duc of Guise) but married off by her ambitious father to Philippe, Prince of Montpensier. At that time, France is in the midst of the wars between Protestant Huguenots and Catholics. During her husband's absence, she is left to the care and tutelage of an aging and impoverished nobleman, the Count of Chabannes, who has experienced the senseless bloodshed of the religious conflict and wants nothing more than a contemplative life away from the fighting.

The Princess of Montpensier, who has never quite forgotten Henri de Guise, is thrown back into his company when she is summoned to join the court in Paris. Their passion is revived even as the princess is initiated to the intrigues of the court, still dominated by the Queen Mother, Catherine de Medici, whose sons rule France in succession during that turbulent period.

Chabannes, who has fallen in love with his charge, sacrifices himself to allow the lovers to reunite. However, De Guise's ambition leads him to betray the princess.

Beautiful scenes of the French countryside are interspersed with scenes of battle and carnage. In the capable hands of Bertrand Tavenier, the characters come to life. Lambert Wilson is particularly affecting as the Count of Chabannes; Gaspard Ulliel is well cast as the charismatic Duke of Guise. Melanie Thierry  is both beautiful and engaging as the passionate and principled Marie de Montpensier. She is another strong, intriguing heroine from the pen of De la Fayette.",1377388800,2,1930,4.9169230769230765

It certainly is an anti-love story. And one that, no matter how well written, acted and presented, I just didn't like and wish I hadn't seen.",1375920000,7,471,4.425287356321839

4663777,5,B005E7SEK2,"Based on a short story by Madame de La Fayette, the Princess of Montpensier is a non-stop bodice ripper with a twist, The historical back is the Catholic/Protestant religious wars featuring an ensemble cast who perform so well. The handsome and quietly charismatic Lambert Wilson, plays Comte Francois de Chabannes, with honor and valor.  A must-see film for students of Bernard Tavenier and French film.

4663779,4,B005E7SEK2,"I very much enjoyed the movie. The DVD arrived on time so I could watch it quickly after discovering it.  That period in history interests me and I thought they did an adequate job of showing the fanaticism of the opposing sides.  In an age and culture where religion takes a backseat to secular interests, it is hard to imagine the fervor that would drive men to kill each other over it.  Also, the film conveyed that women were treated as objects, by their parents, their lovers and their husbands.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in that period.",1374710400,3,559,4.56

There are a couple of short and excellently directed battle scenes, but most of the film consists of the characters discussing philosophy, the nature of love, the duties of marriage, etc.  Melanie Thierry is absolutely stunning, and male viewers will appreciate a couple of glimpses of her unclothed, one on her distinctly unromantic wedding night.

Once over the acceptance that this film was actually a play and saw the scenery as a set versus reality, becoming the audience was enjoyable. The twists and turns of pre-revolutionary France's nobility. Not quite Shakespearian but quite intriguing as we watch the heroine evolve and devolve. Character depth is well measured, as they are well preformed. Yes, it is engaging to the point where I was yelling at the screen at points. This is a good movie for a rainy day or a night alone with a glass of cabernet and some dark chocolate.",1361750400,,800,4.889705882352941

4663794,2,B005E7SEK2,"I'm a sucker for historical dramas. I was expecting more when I came across this movie.
I'm not sure where I saw this, but there was an interview with the director and he talked about how most period pieces tend to have a very traditional filmmaking approach, and he wanted something modern and vibrant for this story about young people in love. I thought that sounded like a great idea. Too bad he didn't do that.
Sure, there are some hand-held shots every now and then, I suppose... but this movie looks and feels like it was made in the 80's...
I've watched plenty of modern french films, and their innovation in movie making is unrivaled (past and present) but this is not one of them. The story is also noticeably rushed, expecting the audience to accept that relationships have formed with what we're told, rather than seeing those relationships grow on screen.
Unless you are REALLY looking for a sad, french, historical romance, I'd look somewhere else.",1354233600,6,961,4.726190476190476

I think the moral of the story is love is blind and stupid and people are still making the same bad decisions in love  down to this day. Since this is all in French, you have to pay close attention to the beginning and middle, because if you miss a fact, you can get lost. Over all I thought it was a good movie.",1339372800,2,431,4.070588235294117
4663800,5,B005E7SEK2,"I am so glad I somehow discovered this movie.  Princess of Montpensier is a historical romantic drama that's heavy on the passion.  It's like a sophisticated French romance novel in motion.  Do NOT skip this because it's subtitled, the language is so lovely that the subtitles didn't bother me at all, and I'm generally not a foreign film fan.  The costumes, scenery, and people are simply gorgeous, and if you're a fan of period movies, you will likely love this one.

4663802,3,B005E7SEK2,"Interesting period movie.  Difficult jumping back and forth from reading sub-titles to looking at the actual film.  Had to stop frames occasionally, read, get the drift, and move on.  Took a while.  The story is intriguingly sad about a head strong woman who hasn't an ounce of sense when she's being seduced for a moment of stolen pleasure.  She thinks it's love.  Married and toying with fire, in the end she gets burned and ends up abandoned by two men - her husband and lover. Moral of the story?  Not sure frankly.  In any event it's the usual war over religion, gutting people with swords, men drooling over a beautiful woman, seduction, an easy lay, and a hard lesson learned by young woman.  Oh, and thank God, we don't need our parents in the room and everyone else on staff in the household to watch and make sure the marriage is consummated by showing father the bloodied sheet.  :cringes:",1329523200,,900,4.60377358490566
4663803,2,B005E7SEK2,"""Gal's Night In"" was duller than hoped because despite the beautiful costumes, scenery, etc., Marie never acted very sensibly, and character development was mostly accomplished by her looking dramatically stoic. The only redeeming thing about her was her friendship with her mentor; she couldn't even muster some empathy for her hubby once he stopped being a toolbag. We were very disappointed at the lack of plot resolution, and the adolescent melodramatic ending, despite the promise of the trailer. Plus, there was a nearly-rape scene. Eew.

This movie is completely overrated. I spent most of the film looking at my cell phone to see what time it was and how much longer the movie could possibly go on. The main character is exceptionally infuriating. She's exquisite to watch on screen but you don't care two smidgens about her. All of the male characters are pathetic and womanizers. The costumes and the sets are beautiful, as is the cinematography.

If the movie were shorter and had more character development it would be worth watching. Skip this one. The trailer tells you everything and shows off the best parts of the film.",1325462400,4,849,4.401273885350318
4663805,4,B005E7SEK2,"This is a French (sub titled!)period drama that takes us back to the religious wars of the sixteenth century. It begins in 1567 and the Prince of Montpensier ( Gregorie Leprince-Ringuet) is returning from the fighting. His cousin Henri de Guise, is in love with Marie, but she is betrothed to his brother. However the Princes' dad has made her dad an offer and dowry he can not refuse and so she is packed off to become a princess (every girl's worst nightmare I suppose). Meanwhile the Prince has saved the life of his erstwhile tutor and mentor, the Compte de Chabannes (Lambert Wilson). The Compte has fought for the Catholics and the Protestants, but after accidentally killing a pregnant woman, he has become disillusioned with the whole war. He is left to guard the Princess and oops, her womanly charms get to him too - what is she like?

That is the stage well and truly set, what happens next is a sprawling tale of love and loss and duty and obedience as well as a few fights along the way. The trailers for this film do have a lot of fighting in them. The film is much more of a drama than a battle fest. The fighting that is done is well above average, I particularly like the great attention to period detail. Also it is done in real time, none of that speeded up malarkey or shaky camera angles that so many film makers opt for these days.

There are also some great moments of social etiquette history, like the wedding night scene where both the entire families gather to ensure consummation. Seriously I would not have been able to raise a smile, let alone anything else. The cinematography is luscious, all of the horses are beautiful, something I have never noticed in a film before, the costumes are exquisite and the whole thing has a feel of quality.

Writer and director Bertrand Tavernier has really done an excellent job. There have been some that said it was too long, and they may have a point as this runs to 139 minutes. I did not have a problem myself, but it probably could have benefitted from some editing down, I would be hard pushed to know where though. If you want an historical action movie, you will probably not be fulfilled with this offering, if you love a bit of historical intrigue, with more love plots than a pulp erotica, and more than a helpful dose of political intrigue, then get your popcorn out for a great French film.",1324857600,,2371,4.483796296296297
4663806,5,B005E7SEK2,"Set in the period approaching the Massacre of St Bartholomew's Day this is a tale of lovers separated by an arranged marriage, of greed, innocence and jealousy. If the history of the wealthy seems rather frenetic it was never more so than in this era (a mixture perhaps of more wine than water and the nearness of death).

The film is beautifully set in its era using the Comte de Chabannes, a retired soldier, as an example of its rational side. It features the usual historical cast: Guise, Anjou (very convincingly played), and the Queen Mother; all well acted in splendid costume and sets, not quite the equal of Vatel but then the monarchy was not as wealthy as that of Louis. However, within this setting the story is the old, old, one of unrequited love. Lambert Wilson as the almost Don Quixote (he even has the hat) Comte de Chabannes, M&eacute;lanie Thierry as the child-like but beautiful Princesse (at times with an almost Bardot look), Gr&eacute;goire Leprince-Ringuet as the shambling, decent but jealous husband, and other excellent performances just add to a piece whose general trajectory is doomward.

I think it will be a mite too long for many. Watching La Reine Margot before will also help you with understanding the ""runners and riders"" of the Wars of Religion.",1323734400,6,1284,4.831818181818182
