6370947,5,B00JKEM25S,"Classic British country humor grows on you. I grew to laugh lots at Series One.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blandings-Series-1/dp/B00D7AM2WO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blandings, Series 1</a>
 Series 2 begins with belly-good humor, a spoof on British upper society class. PG Wodehouse wrote Blandings Castle novels from 1915 to 1975. All family friendly. Adaptations for TV with the characters and stories of the zany lot at Blandings. It is contemporary produced [2014] in a nostalgic Wodehouse way. Filming was done in Northern Ireland countryside, a plus.
Bonnie fun. ""I said it first, so yah boo sucks and no returnsies."" [an example of a dialogue quote]

Timothy Spall plays Lord Clarence in all episodes, not your brightest Lord of the manor.
Jennifer Saunders is bossy sister Lady Connie, a matchmaker of sorts.
Tim Vine (new) as butler Beach. Jack Farthing is Clarence's son Freddie, a womanizer.
Ron Donachie returns as Angus McAllister (gardener/gillie) is aye a hoot wit his braw Scot's brogue.

SDH subtitles [English] for all episodes:
1---Throwing Eggs --will Duke of Dunstable (Harry Enfield) succeed in committing loony Clarence? for pottiness, Beach and Freddie to the rescue from scrambled eggs. Ron Donachie (`Game of Thrones', `Titanic') as McAllister is also in episodes 5 & 7.

2---Dirty Work at the Crossroads -Will Clarence's frightful sister, Charlotte (Celia Imrie -`Bridget Jones' `Titanic') move into Blandings? Permanently. Plus the Empress Pig heist & rescue plot. This episode as well as 3 & 7 have Robert Bathurst (`Downton Abbey' `Emma') as Sir Gregory.

3---Hallo to All This -Clarence's brother Galahad is writing a scandalous memoir. Can Freddie help can the manuscript?

4---Lord Emsworth Acts for the Best -Furnace failure and Clarence grew a bad beard just as he must convince Hollywood star Pauline Petite (Zoe Boyle -`Downton Abbey') of Freddie's goodness.

5---Sticky Wicket at Blandings --Connie wants to impress Col Fanshawe (James Fleet -`Outlander' `Little Dorrit' `Sense & Sensibility'), not an easy Blandings trick. Even Beach acts odd. Angus is Scot spot-on.

6---Necessary Rhino -Did Hannibal Didcot (John Sessions) buy forgery art off Clarence? Will Hannibal propose to Vanessa (Daisy Beaumont)? Or Freddie

7---Custody of the Pumpkin -- Connie plots to marry Freddie off to Sir Gregory's cross-dressing niece Felicity (Phoebe Waller-Bridge -`Iron Lady'). McAllister's bonnie niece, Niagara, played by Rose Leslie (`Game of Thrones' `Downton Abbey').

I don't know if I would go so far as to say the videos are better than the book, but...The second season is superior to the first season. I think they were just hitting their stride.

6370957,5,B00JKEM25S,I'm on my fourth time watching this series. It is the best comedy I've seen out of GB in awhile.

6370963,1,B00JKEM25S,Great books reduced to trivial nonsense. Subtle humour reduced to the most basic slapstick. Innuendos made blaring statements. All of it abbreviated beyond belief.  I beg you to avoid this and read the books.,1484611200,,208,5.117647058823529

6370969,4,B00JKEM25S,"Completely enjoyable, but you have to really pay attention to the dialog because many of the funniest parts lie hidden there. Some may say the series is stupid, just listen and enjoy.",1481846400,,183,4.75

6370985,5,B00JKEM25S,"Hysterical British series based on PG Wodehouse's Blandings books. The actor playing the butler changes in this season, and while I did not find him as funny or as amusing as Mark Williams in series 1, he has his own style that works. Will keep you laughing.",1474934400,,258,4.51063829787234

6371001,4,B00JKEM25S,"Some first class comic talent having a great deal of fun with P.G. Wodehouse. An affectionate look at the petering out of the landed gentry as they grapple with their changing fortunes. While the 'pater familias' remains sublimely unaware of the changes afoot, he lavishes his over-taxed attentions and competitive efforts on his country loves - mostly on the enormous, furrow-browed apple of his eye, his prize pig ""The Duchess"", but also on his equally prize-worthy pumpkin. Meanwhile, his sister attempts to focus the remnants of this hair-brained family on financial survival, latching frequently onto any 'worthy' candidate she can drum up from her dwindling social roster or dubious family connections. All of them either ghastly or equally impecunious.. She is deftly foiled in her attempts at social betterment by a combination of circumstance and the well-meaning ineptitude (not to mention connivance) of the colorful and inventive members of the Blandings Castle household. From witless yet amorous nephew Freddie, to long-suffering, oft-tippling butler Beach - these are just some of the irresistible personalities who keep this series whizzing on in a haze of upper-crust twittery and buffoonishness. Forget 'Downton Abbey', this may be lighter but it's also a lot more fun!",1466812800,,1287,5.407960199004975
6371002,5,B00JKEM25S,"The wonderful Timothy Spall heads up a great cast giving us an hilarious look at the aristocratic family and its eccentricities. My favorite is the PIG Empress of Blandings who is doted over and adored by his Lordship. This second series is a delight, hope they make a 3rd.",1466553600,,273,4.591836734693878

6371004,5,B00JKEM25S,"There aren't many shows that I find laugh out loud funny but there are parts of this series that I had to pause it while I finished laughing. That said, this is British humor, or should I say, humour and so it's not going to be for everyone. If you like this sort of wit then give this a watch. I was sad to see it only had two seasons.",1465430400,,336,3.8142857142857145
6371005,5,B00JKEM25S,Series 2 is my favorite thus far.  Very funny and very British.,1465257600,,63,4.25

6371008,5,B00JKEM25S,"Blandings is wonderful! Wit, charm, great actors, a pig named Empress, what more could you ask? Every episode is a visit to a place where silliness and innocence triumph over grim seriousness. Julian Rhind-Tutt as Galahad is an utter treat, saving the day for the forces of goodness and light in an elegant way. Thank You to everyone involved in making Blandings! It is a gift to the spirit!",1459209600,,391,4.681159420289855

6371011,5,B00JKEM25S,"After going on about how great the first series was, there isn't much more to say.  This is the best in dry British humor and only makes one wish for more.  Watched it dozens of times and its still funny.",1454025600,,204,4.075
6371012,3,B00JKEM25S,"We love British comedy.  I bought this for that reason without knowing anything about the series.  It was just so-so.  Had some funny scenes and topics.  But the accents were stronger than most.  Many times we could not understand the dialogue.  Overall, somewhat entertaining.  If you like the series, the disk sets were well produced and performed fine.  My limited rating is for the show itself.  The product was good.",1452988800,,421,4.9
6371013,4,B00JKEM25S,"This was not nearly as funny as Blandings, Series 1. There's a new butler, and I haven't warmed to him. Also, Freddie, the empty-headed son, has had his blithe personality tamped down a lot. I expect I'll like it better on subsequent viewings.",1452643200,,243,4.674418604651163

6371016,5,B00JKEM25S,Love PGWodehouse and this adaptation is great. Very funny and the leads are excellent. Shame that Williams?? is no longer playing the butler but new guy is OK.,1442188800,,159,4.714285714285714

6371018,4,B00JKEM25S,"I purchased season 1 and 2 of Blandings after watching the 90's Jeeves and Wooster series. I am a huge P. G. Wodehouse fan, and these seasons proved to be nearly as funny as his writing. The only mishaps in the series were at the moments when things were obviously added in an attempt to appeal to a more modern audience. Those additions were simply not needed. I appreciate how clean the Jeeves and Wooster series is, and this series got nearly there, though not all the way. Overall, both seasons were entertaining and enjoyable.",1440806400,,531,4.6
6371019,5,B00JKEM25S,I enjoy anything with Jennifer Saunders.  This was a pleasant surprise because I had never heard of this show.  Eccentric characters and lots of laughs.  Too bad they only did two series.,1435968000,,187,4.78125
6371020,3,B00JKEM25S,Series 1 was comic heaven. Series 2 is about half as funny. Replacing a very funny butler with an actor who plays the part straight is the main problem. All the craziness seems to be dumped into Spall's character and it just makes him seem like a dimwit. The Scottish gardener gets more opportunities but most of the guest stars are just annoying. After the first series I wanted this show to go on forever. After the second series I've seen enough.,1435449600,3,449,4.487804878048781

6371028,5,B00JKEM25S,"I am going to write duplicate reviews for both series.  Wodehouse was truly a genius that has not been discovered by many on the American continent.

Only Freddie is over the top with his feckless ways;  frankly, as played (clinched hands and a crab like gait he's almost physically disabled.  Not sure whether that was intended as part of the character or just an aberration.

The first season was frankly a let down- perhaps it took some time for the writers and producers to get a proper feel for the material.  In this second season they hit their stride and the result has been delightful- fully the equal of the immortal Jeeves and Wooster series by Fry and Laurie.

Timothy Spall does a fabulous job as Lord Clarence Emsworth- no one could have done it better.  But  special treat of this season is that we finally get to see his younger brother Galahad.  And a bonus at the end- in the final episode of this season we get to meet Miss Niagara Donaldson, niece of the Blandings Castle gardener Angus McCallister.  Miss Donaldson  will, in due time marry Freddy.  It may come as a surprise to those who know Blandings only through the TV series but Freddy, despite his evident lack of brains, actually manages to marry very well indeed:  Many of the more amusing Blandings stories revolve around Freddy's misguided but good hearted attempts to impress his Rich American Father-In-Law.  We will hopefully be treated to some of these stories in the third season.  I think that Rose Leslie was a perfect choice to play Miss Donaldson, while Ron Donachie is absolutely perfect as her uncle Angus.",1419033600,,1342,4.639830508474576
6371046,5,B00JKEM25S,"Series one was so good. I think series 2 is not so well done or fun, but what can you do when you want the series? I believe I would buy it again for that reason.",1417651200,,162,3.5277777777777777

6371048,5,B00JKEM25S,"I happen to be a big P.G. Woodhouse fan, and his stories about Blandings Castle are some of the best. Needless to say I have both series One and Series Two. Timothy Spall is great as Clarence, the head of the family, and Jennifer Saunders is perfect as his sister( and his foil) is great. I just hope the come out with more Series, we can but hope.",1416787200,2,348,4.132352941176471

6371052,5,B00JKEM25S,We are Big fans of Blandings.  Love Jennifer Saunders and Timothy Spall.  My husband and I both get a kick out of this show.  All the guest appearances are great too.  We kept hoping that David Walliams would make another appearance as Baxter as he did in Series 1 but no such luck.  Love the Freddie character.  Even love the pig.  The stories and characters are quirky and good fun.  The setting and the scenery is very pretty too.  Hope there will be a Series 3 as we are already looking forward to adding that one to our collection.,1414972800,2,536,4.333333333333333
6371053,5,B00JKEM25S,"This is absolutely positively a riot to watch! I especially like the subtitles so I can make sure I heard what I thought I heard. The language, writing and cast is superb. Having a hard time waiting for Series 3.",1414627200,,212,4.325
6371054,5,B00JKEM25S,"How anyone could watch this series and not fall in love with it is beyond comprehension. Season two opens with a new actor skillfully playing the devoted Butler Beech. My favorite episodes are ""Throwing Eggs"" in which several members of the family including Lord Emsworth are up for incarceration in a Welsh lunatic hospital due to Connie's mechanizations. ""Sticky Wicket at Blandings"" is a hilarious episode in which Aunt Julia's talented pug visits, Beech falls under the influence, the unintelligible gamekeeper hunts rabbits and Connie attempts, once again, to impress the right sort of people, this time the King himself, through her choice of houseguests. The final episode, ""Custody of the Pumpkin"", is a full on crack up as Connie threatens to dispose of both the Empress and Lord Emsworth's amazing pumpkin in a secret deal with Emsworth's archenemy Sir Gregory to get Frederick Emsworth married off. It's a shame there are only two seasons of this series. Thirteen episodes are not enough.",1414281600,,999,5.134969325153374

6371058,5,B00JKEM25S,We have watched this several times since we purchased it.  It is well done and is an absolute HOOT!!  We recommend it whole heartedly.,1413590400,,134,4.541666666666667
6371059,5,B00JKEM25S,"Series Two of ""Blandings"" brings the P.G. Wodehouse cast of characters alive in all it's snappy, crackling glory. Gone are the hokey pig-farts and rising-locks of (the still pretty decent) season one. In their place we have cute plots, witty dialog, a to-die-for setting (Crom Castle gives Highclere a run for the money), and a supurb cast headed by Jack Farthing's winsome, stammering Freddie. On top of this, the show accurately captures Wodehouse's pan-decade flair, combining a bit of 1920s and 30s art deco seamlessly with 40s and 50s glam.

The only point against this show is that it falls several times into that curious BBC tradition of giving guest characters gawdawful lisps. I guess this must be hilarious in England, but I find it excruciating.

I've been waiting a long time for a worthy successor to ""Jeeves and Wooster. Blandings fits the bill. Long may it run!",1413504000,9,877,4.918918918918919
6371060,5,B00JKEM25S,"I am a Wodehouse fan, so naturally I love it. Jennifer Saunders is a big surprise in this. Normally I don't care for her style of acting, but she is great in this. Recommended to Britcom fans.",1413072000,,192,4.216216216216216

6371063,5,B00JKEM25S,"My husband and I are big anglophiles, and since we're especially big fans of the other P.G. Wodehouse tv series ""Jeeves and Wooster"" (with the great Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie), we decided to check this out too-- we loved the first season of it so much that we couldn't wait for the second series to come out on dvd!  Timothy Spall is great as the eternally befuddled & befogged, almost-W.C. Fields-like lord of the manor, and Jennifer Saunders is equally great as his stern and disapproving spinster sister!  Great farce, highly recommended for other Brit-tv loving anglophiles!",1412294400,,580,4.908163265306122
6371064,5,B00JKEM25S,"What fun!!  I had not seen series 1 of Blandings, so I wasn't certain what to expect.  I love P. G. Wodehouse, but I wasn't sure the humor of the Blandings stories  would translate well for a modern audience. I was delighted to find the series is wonderful!  Timothy Spall and Jennifer Saunders are  remarkable, making me laugh at their  perfect performances,  bringing to life the unusual but loveable brother and sister Clarence and Connie.  The troubles with other family members who are often house guests at Blandings, set the stage for the action in each episode.  Of course Clarence's devotion to The Empress, his prize pig and the interventions by the butler Beach to sort out difficulties add to this highly entertaining take on the privileged class living in the 1930's..  I'm going to search out series 1 to watch.  If you are a Jeeves and Wooster fan, Blandings is a must to add to your collection.  If you don't know Wodehouse, it is a great place to start.",1410393600,7,970,4.641176470588236

8651748,5,B00JKEM25S,"The further TV adventures of the P.G Wodehouse characters. They pulled a Bewitched Dick York/Dick Sargent-type switcheroo by inconspicuously replacing Mark Williams with Tim Vine as the butler Beach.  Otherwise it's more routine eccentricities at Blandings castle.  And once again, it's Jack Farthing as the dim-witted Freddie Threepwood (one character actually suggests that Freddie has broccoli for brains) who steals the show.
My only complaints:
 There are only a paltry 13 episodes of this wonderful series between it's two seasons.
 This series only has a DVD release.  Why not BluRay?",1528416000,,591,5.522222222222222

The writers actually blend several of PGW's short stories into wonderful shows.  The actors chosen to play the parts do so wonderfully!  I bought both Series 1 and 2 to insure I'd always be able to watch, even if Acorn takes them off their offering.  Hint PLEASE BRING BACK SEASONS OF WOOSTER AND JEEVES I'LL BUY THEM TOO!  Jennifer Saunders is hilarious!",1514332800,,454,4.8311688311688314
8651756,1,B00JKEM25S,"The incredible and delightful thing about Wodehouse is his unique and masterful writing style.  Ergo you must read him!  These clodish films are terrible, it's crude humor.  Some of the acting is interesting, but the people do not suit the characters.  I've never seen any author's novels so poorly made to film.  PGW was so great that Evelyn Waugh praised his comedic writing skills.  The books seem simple but that effect is wrought by talent.  Get a book, many fall into 2 groups:  Blandings and Jeeves.  Get it today!",1507507200,,521,4.764044943820225
