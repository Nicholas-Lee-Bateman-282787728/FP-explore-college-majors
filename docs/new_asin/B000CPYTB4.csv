gooes out of style but continues to stir the heart to
the true meaning of Christmas. It is my favorite.

2468741,5,B000CPYTB4,"Next only to the VHS video, CHRISTMAS ACROSS AMERICA, this is my second favorite christmas VHS video ever released, even greater than christmas movies released on VHS or DVD (this, AN OLD-FASHIONED CHRISTMAS VHS video, is tied at #2 with TONY BENNETT: A FAMILY CHRISTMAS VHS video and HOLIDAY SING ALONG WITH MITCH VHS video)!

A simple but wonderful story about people and families coming together for christmas (centering mostly on one specific family, but other individuals are featured as well).

The soundtrack is just fantastic. From a great 1950's or 1960's style of WHITE CHRISTMAS to a wonderful and similar style version of THE CHRISTMAS SONG to a chorus led O TANNENBAUM (O CHRISTMAS TREE) to a beautiful orchestra instrumental version of TOYLAND (one of the best if not the  best song on this VHS video) to another highlight song of the video which could itself be the best song on this tape (which is played at the closing credits), SKATER'S WALTZ is just an amazing orchestra instrumental track. Even the opening number that starts us all off is a highlight on this video, the song being DING! DONG! MERRILY ON HIGH which is superbly done by an orchestra and chorus along with a great video (visual) part with the music. This song itself could be the #1 song on this video.

But perhaps the highlight of this VHS video is the song ROCKIN' AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE. It's a really nice chorus led, old rockin' styled song which takes us back to yesteryear's christmases, and the video of young adults dancing to the song in a 1950's styled restaurant is just fabulous.

Very recommended for a wonderful family styled christmas experience and great to put on for some background entertainment when guests are at your house during the holidays.",1241654400,5,1755,4.8172757475083055

8100181,5,B000CPYTB4,"My wife bought this vhs tape over ten years ago and we have continued the ""tradition"" of playing it over and over during the Christmas season.  As the years goes by, the nostalgia grows, taking me back to my earlier recollections of those wonderful times as a child, and even into our years of raising children.

This production was put together so beautifully, and as I watch it, I think about those that produced it, how they seemed to have done it with a heart towards each scene; even the horses enjoyed their parts in pulling the sleighs. Last year, I purchased another tape, as the original began to show signs of wear. We are now just a few days before Christmas, 2011, and we've played it several times already.",1324425600,4,719,4.523076923076923
8100182,5,B000CPYTB4,"This video has some beautiful scenery of Angelica, NY.  It shows many of the old houses, scenes on Main St and the old historic churches. There are sleigh rides in the snow and a lot of beautiful snow scenes.  The music is wonderful.  All of the old Christmas Carols sung in a way that makes for an evening of great listening pleasure.",1297209600,4,335,4.370967741935484
