6322041,5,B00J2W7CM6,This is a well done documentary that I think everyone should see. People forget that their freedom isn't free; that there are brave men and women out there fighting for us to keep our way of life. These mens' sacrifices and perseverance is truly inspirational.,1396396800,,260,4.8
6322042,5,B00J2W7CM6,This is easily the most incredible documentary I have ever seen.  My father died in service to the Navy at 54 years old.  It brought back so many happy memories of what he lived for.  This is a MUST SEE for anyone who loves what our armed services stand for!,1396310400,,258,4.12
6322103,5,B00J2W7CM6,"Beautifully told story of three truly great American heroes.
Their exploits on the battlefield made them heroes...what they've done since, makes them great Americans.
Truly inspiring.",1402876800,,183,6.076923076923077
6322104,5,B00J2W7CM6,"Absolutely fantastic. The courage of these warriors. For the everyday person inspiration to never give up, never out of the fight!!!'",1399161600,,133,5.380952380952381
6322105,5,B00J2W7CM6,"This is a film that I wish all Americans would view. Unfortunately many in our society could care less about our Military let alone what happens to the Men and Women who put their lives in harms way to defend liberty for all.
I believe that this film will give hope to those that need it. The courage and strength to move forward with their lives.",1399075200,4,347,4.2727272727272725
6322106,5,B00J2W7CM6,"Three servicemen, each severely wounded - actually, the right word is maimed. Each battles to deal with their injuries. We see their families that support them, see them face what many people would find insurmountable. They deal with it and grow.

Marine Gunnery Sergeant Spanky Gibson fights the possibility of medical discharge and becomes the first above the first above the knee amputee to go back to combat duty.retiring as a Master Sgt. Now he has launched a new career as a veteran's counsellor, hoping to help others.

US Navy Seal Lieutenant Jason Redman  now advocates for wounded warriors.

US Marine Corporal Kyle Carpenter in March 2013 was announced as a Medal of Honor nominee.

Watch this, think of the obstacles you face and know that you can adapt and progress. These men are inspirations not just to Americans, but to all.",1397952000,,841,4.894366197183099
6322107,5,B00J2W7CM6,"Profound and emotional.  Too many tears to count - tears sprung not from despair but from hope and inspiration and good old-fashioned grit.......Kyle, Spanky, Jay, certainly, and their support systems - Kyle's parents, Spanky's kids, and of course, Jay's beautiful Erica and their children.  Heroes, all, yet they'd have you think they're just ordinary people who love their country and their 'brothers'.  Perhaps, but they are heroes of the first order who have lived their lives in extraordinary ways, and they continue to inspire our wounded, and all of us, to reach out, overcome and continue the fight.  Puts a lot of things in perspective.  And lest you think it's all tears, this DVD has a wonderful musical score, great lighting, grand sweeping scenery and even a bit of humor thrown in for comic relief - note particularly Jay's last line.  ""Still in the Fight"" surely deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary film.  It's always great when the good guys win!  Every American should see this.............and be ever grateful for our men and women in uniform.",1397433600,,1075,5.033898305084746
6322108,5,B00J2W7CM6,"I bought this movie because I saw Wounded Wear talk about it on their Facebook page.  Once I received it, I couldn't have been anymore excited to open it and watch it.

As a kid I always said, ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger; is crap.""  But after seeing this and meeting more wounded worriers, I have learned that ""What doesn't kill you really does make you stronger.  The fact Jay, Kyle and Spanky and every wounded worrier could go through what they; and be so positive is truly astounding.  If you want your life changed than buy and watch this movie.",1397347200,5,564,4.436893203883495

8647586,5,B00J2W7CM6,"This film replaced a visit to my class from a friend who is a wounded Vietnam Vet which was raising funds for Veteran's Village in San Diego Stand Down Project.  Though it may not be as interesting as having a person present who can be asked questions, the stories of these amazing men are extremely inspirational and I believe it opened the eyes of my students as to the sacrifices our brave men and women in uniform and their families make.",1433808000,,442,4.45679012345679

Proceeds go to great charities! I personally know Spanky Gibson and he is an amazing person who goes the extra mile every day to assist his brothers and sisters in arms and help them remain ""Still In The Fight""!
