4569940,5,B0054KVNH0,"From the first moment, the first scene in this film, you are carried into the spiritual world of the Casa and John of God. By the end of the film I was captivated by the man and his life of service to others.  The film is visually rich in color and texture. An excellent film! I have viewed other films that attempt to capture the hope and anguish of the people who line up at the Casa, but this is the first film that shares their faces, and their stories so deeply. There are a few short scenes that present the physical surgeries in detail, but fortunately most of the movie focuses on the spiritual healing and the testimony of everyday people. By the end of the movie I felt blessed to have experienced his story, and was wondering how I can be more of service in my community. This film does not cover details on how the Casa operates. There are several informative books and websites that cover the details.",1309132800,52,914,4.345029239766082

4569964,5,B0054KVNH0,Enjoyed this very much. I had a friend who traveled there for healing and this movie accurately represented the experience.,1390003200,,123,5.2
4569965,5,B0054KVNH0,"As a Brazilian, heard much about John but never had the urge to visit it because I always had good physical and spiritual health. Another big reason is that there are many John in Brazil, doing the same thing that he does. Thanks to the mixture of races that happened in the country since colonization, where we learned from our aboriginal to African slaves, the importance of respecting the spiritual manifestations what does not always come from established churches. The film is faithful to all that I know and heard of him. I recommend this movie to all those people who still need a push to put into practice all the practices that lead to a strong and secure connection to all spiritual beings in the universe. Yes, we are not talking about religion here. John's work is not about religion, it is much more then that. You have to see it.",1388534400,10,843,4.552631578947368

4569968,5,B0054KVNH0,"This is definitely the best documentary I have ever watched on spiritual healing.
Their understanding of how healing works rings true and is congruent with many genuine spiritual teachers/teachings.

What an amazing place, I would love to see similar places set up around the world.

I can't recommend it highly enough.",1372809600,4,319,5.235294117647059
4569969,5,B0054KVNH0,"I went to the Casa for the first time in 2012. I am returning this summer for my 4th trip to do more healing work. As an Integrative Medicine Practitioner and Nurse my experience at the Casa was even more wonderful than what could be captured by this film. All of the footage of the work done is exactly what you would see up close and personal during a visit. The healing, love and energy at this center is beyond what I have experienced anywhere. I thought this movie did an excellent job in giving the viewer a good overview of what happens at the Casa. It was very helpful to watch this movie and show it to family and friends before my trip. If you are interested in powerful alternative medicine you will LOVE this movie

4569970,5,B0054KVNH0,"I have seen a number of DVDs about John of God.  This is by
far the best on the market today.  This documentary gives  voice
to those who have travelled to Brazil to find healing and
understanding and to those whose life mission is to serve
the multitudes who come to the Casa.  The visuals
are executed with an eye of professionalism and the narrative is
sensitively written.  Combine this with a musical score that tugs
at your heart strings and you have a winning combination that
fills your soul with awe.  If you are thinking about this type of
journey or want to understand why people come from all over
the world to this small town in Brazil, this is a good place to begin.",1371340800,7,680,4.357142857142857

4569973,5,B0054KVNH0,"I really loved this movie. The quality of the production is excellent.

Having recently just discovered John of God (what's taken me so long, I don't know), I enthusiastically scoured Amazon for products about him, and found this. This movie is very spiritually uplifting. The message comes across in a very gentle healing way. It goes into details about the healings at the casa, and the protocols, as wells as many wonderful testimonials from people all over the world who have visited there.

Be warned that there are some very graphic scenes about how he cuts into people, so if you are squeamish about blood and seeing people with prongs going into their noses, you might need to close your eyes through those parts.

The overall message is a good one, and people like Oprah and Dr Wayne Dwyer (who himself had a healing) have given time to get the word out about this amazing man. The movie also shows real doctors who have been there and had their own healings. It sure makes you want to go and visit and see and hear the amazing events of healings in person.",1361145600,13,1066,4.570680628272251
4569974,5,B0054KVNH0,"The film was simply beautiful.  It captured the essence of the miraculous happenings in Abadaina, Brazil with grace and validity.  A must see for anyone entertaining a journey to The Casa with John of God or merely curious about the many documented healings,",1350864000,5,258,4.976744186046512
4569975,5,B0054KVNH0,"In my preparation to go to be Healed by John of God, I purchased this along with ""The Book of Miracles"" by Josie Ravenwind (excellent book!) and found this award winning doumentary to be awesome.  I cannot tell you how interesting this documentary is, even if you are not going, I highly recommend this DVD to all.  It is worth the money.  I have bought 3 to share with others and pass them around.  Everyone that watches it just loves it.  It is a very high quality made documentary on miracles, John of God (as seen on Oprah, twice) and how spiritual healing occurs.  i cannot praise this movie enough.",1338336000,16,604,4.445454545454545
4569976,5,B0054KVNH0,This movie is spell-bounding! It takes me back to abadania each time i watch it. It gives so much hope and faith in God in restoring our health. I had tears stream down my face and felt healing energy from the good entities at Casa. The Movie also gives us a reality check about working on ourselves to go within to become a better human being. It is movie that people must watch before going down to CASA. A fabulous movie!,1328227200,13,424,4.246913580246914
4569977,5,B0054KVNH0,"This is a ""must"" see for anyone interested in health and healing. If you have or have not heard of John of God, this video will change how you view possibility. Just buy it, and one to share with friends.",1316217600,19,204,4.125
4569978,5,B0054KVNH0,"I heard about this video three years ago and it is amazing how long it took to get out!  But I was not disappointed. Adding the story of Dom Ignacio was beautiful and poignant. I have been to the Casa four times in the last three years and it is always a miraculous experience. Love, healing of body mind and spirit, and people filled with hope, joy and compassion. This video captures all of that and adds results to the surgeries, both physical and spiritual. For those seeking this kind of experience, the video will not disappoint.",1315440000,25,535,4.515463917525773
4569979,5,B0054KVNH0,"I purchased this DVD from Amazon.com. It is very descriptive and helps others to know the workings of the miracles and mysteries of John of God. I highly recommend it for those on the spiritual path.

4569980,5,B0054KVNH0,"This film is the best I have yet seen on John of God and the healing work that is done at the Casa de Dom Inacio. It is a skillful, artistic, professional, engaging and sensitive piece of film making.

There are a couple of excellent books about John of God, such as Heather Cumming's ""John of God, The Brazilian Healer Who's Touched the Lives of Millions"" and Josie RavenWing's ""The Book of Miracles, The Healing Work of Joao de Deus,"" but none of the films about him prior to this one come close to capturing the depth of the experience at the Casa that ""Healing: Miracles, Mysteries and John of God"" captures.

The film opens with the journey of Ignatius of Loyola, the guiding spirit of the Casa. It is a wonderful metaphor for the spiritual journey that one takes in traveling to see John of God.  Through interviews with people, including two articulate and initially skeptical M.D.s, who visit the Casa, and mediums working there, the openness, vulnerability, intelligence, faith, work, wisdom and love available in this sacred place are evident.  The natural beauty of rural Abadiania, Brazil comes across powerfully in the photography.  The soundtrack blends with the imagery, creating a graceful sense of flow.

The film ends with Ignatius leaving his sword on the altar and the voiceover: ""When all human help fails, there is then room for the Divine.""

Having traveled twice to the Casa and heading back again in one month, I feel that I am there each time I watch this film.  Watching the film is itself a healing experience.  Thank you, David Unterberg, for making such a beautiful and intelligent film that truly captures the love and healing available to us on our journeys.",1311120000,63,1690,4.780068728522337

8456785,5,B0054KVNH0,"The film is WONDERFUL...

BUT a technical problem must be fixed :

How is it possible that this DVD indicates multiple languages (""language versions"" is the exact mention - see picture below), and when I tried to listen in French (or even any other language mentionned) it is impossible : the ""menu"" does not stay on the screen and only the English is going on... I bought it for nothing. I had already seen the english version and wanted to share this marvel with my friends and family speaking no english at all !!!
I sent this information to the DVD's publishers hoping that they are going to change something...
NOTE : In the meantime, I must say that the seller has processed to a refund of this DVD !",1473811200,,706,4.423076923076923

8456787,3,B0054KVNH0,"Professional quality film. My only disappointment was that this doesn't serve as a good introduction to John of God (in my opinion) and that's what I've been searching for. There were a number of things mentioned in this film that made sense to me only because I've read books by Heather Cummings and Gail Thackray which provided me with a better understanding than someone with no idea about mediumship, John of God, or the protocols and daily routines of the Casa in Brazil. I'd love to see a film that first shares information about the incredible feeling of love that is reportedly experienced by everyone present at the Casa...and then explains how the spirits (called the Entities) work through this medium's body to achieve spiritual healing, which changes people's lives in wonderful ways. This film shows footage of the most shocking things that happen at the Casa, the physical surgeries, at the beginning. They don't state the fact that there are just a few of these done; most people who receive surgery (rather than only healing) opt to have an invisible surgery. I like that they do say the reason some people choose to have a physical surgery is because they feel the need to see tangible evidence that something is happening.",1468972800,5,1241,4.8584905660377355
