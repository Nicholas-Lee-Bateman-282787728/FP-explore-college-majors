8515465,4,B007ETEOCK,"This DVD is a recording of the 2011 premier of the Opera in Latvia.  The Opera was composed in Germany after WWII, where the Latvian composer Bruno Skulte fled to from the Russians.  If I had to categorize this opera I would call it Folkloric Opera.  The libretto is taken from folkloric themes as well as the melodic music.  The moral message seems to be around the futility of war and tribal enmities. When the belongings of both sides are destroyed, peace is finally achieved.  The music can be seen also as a longing for simple and past times.  It is very melodic and without unnecessary sophistication, longing for a simple and peaceful world.  The production is straight forward, most probably as described by the composer and librettist.  The filming and the audio are not to the standards we are getting accustomed with technology, but doesn't take much from the enjoyment of this premier.
As for the singers, Dana Bramane as Makuta is the one to mention. She is very good in her role as singer and as actress.
The nationalistic aspects of this production are evident, and it seems to be the pride of the renewed Latvian nation.  If you are for exploring and enjoying a premier of an opera, this is a good investment.",1370131200,,1225,4.6342592592592595
8515466,4,B007ETEOCK,"As an aficionado of Eastern European/Russian music, especially operas, I purchased this DVD without knowing anything about the composer (Bruno Skulte) or Latvian opera.  The result was a delightful, tuneful folk drama with vivid characters, some magic overtones, and lyrical music.

I am totally unfamiliar with opera from Latvia.  Grove Dictionary of Opera has only three paragraphs on it, and Skulte's name is not included.  But the helpful booklet included with the DVD, gives a fairly detailed background on him, and the completion and debut of this opera.

Skulte was born in Kiev in 1905 and returned with his family to Latvia in 1922, before escaping to America in 1949 after World War II and the Russian occupation.  In New York, he composed much music, and was particularly instrumental in preserving Latvian music, especially choral works, and oversaw annual Latvian festivals for years.  All of this was at the expense of his own compositions.

This opera was written in 1947, but Skulte never completed the orchestration for the second half.  In recent years, the Latvian community in NY raised the money to engage his friend Adrejs Jansons (conductor here) to complete the score, AND to present the staged world premiere in Riga, Latvia in 2011, where this was filmed.

OK, enough background, but what about the opera itself?  It takes place in the small rural areas of Latvia where two adjacent ""estates"" (villages) have been feuding for years.  In the first act, Leva and Raiti celebrate with friends their marital engagement with a rollicking drinking songs, etc.  (It clearly reminded me of some of the chorus scenes of ""The Bartered Bride"" by Smetana.)  Wandering into this scene is a beautiful, mysterious woman with whom Raiti is immediately attracted/enchanted.  She identifies herself as Maruta, the Heiress of Vilkaci, the rival estate.  Leva orders her out, but Raiti is clearly smitten.

Of course, as it plays out, Raiti and Maruta fall in love, Leva is jealous, and warfare breaks out (offstage) when both ""estates"" are burned at the same time.  Maruta has born Raiti's child which he has not recognized.  But in the end, as both houses are burning, Raiti declares himself the father and  his love for Maruta, while all proclaim that the hatred should end and all should rebuild their lives together in harmony.

Act three was particularly effective for me.  There, in the forest at midnight, Leva fears what is happening to Raiti, and he then meets Maruta where they declare their love for each other.  The night air and music is intoxicating, and the emotional piques are vivid and well staged.

Although written fairly recently, this is an ""old fashioned"" opera in that it has quite clear folk elements in the music and the magic (not actual but implied).  To me, it is quite similar to Bartered Bride, but it is NOT a comedy, but a similar folk feel.  The costumes, sets and staging all bring this out effectively.

The singers are good, with Dana Bramane (Maruta) particularly excellent, as is Andzella Goba (Dace- an older lady with mystical powers.)  The chorus is also terrific.

As for the DVD itself, a few words of note.  There are no audio options, but it has dolby sound.  It has pretty good subtitles in many languages.  But the filming is a little primitive.  Only a few cameras (I didn't count them), and the microphones are clearly at the front of the stage, so when anyone is singing in the rear, the volume is quite low.  Occasionally, the camera work is pretty jerky.

Overall, this operas was a delight, very lyrical, with a sincere story of love amidst feuding villages.  The folk element predominates- all to the good.  If you like Czech opera, give this one a try.  I think you'll like it.",1337990400,13,3740,4.868462757527734
