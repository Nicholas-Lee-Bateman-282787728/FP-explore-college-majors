First of all, there is no English on the dvd's, the flash cards, the posters, or anything!  Also, the words are written in cyrillic, so i cannot read them to pronounce them.  I will have to find the words online and write them on the posters with a sharpie.
 This set is also over-priced, first of all, because there are long pauses between talking on the dvd's.  I think a lot more material could have fit into the time frame of the dvd's.  And all the extra stuff that comes with the deluxe set is definitely not worth the extra money. The flash cards are very thin and will not last and one side is blank, which would have been better if they had more words on the other side or the same words in english.
I like the characters and  I also think the dvd's are cute and i like the music (i grew up in the 80's!). So, I like the content, etc., there is just not enough for the price and they really need to have the words in english, as well.",1428278400,3,1063,4.052631578947368
