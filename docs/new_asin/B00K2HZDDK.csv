6401460,5,B00K2HZDDK,"Preliminary Pilates, produced by Dancing For Him Ministries, is a basic foundational DVD for beginners in Pilates. This DVD had two part with the first being the exercise routine and the second being about proper form. I appreciate how each exercise was over slowly and the form was described in full.

I really appreciate how Pastor Lynn dedicates a whole section to review and train on form.

I like rolling like ball and seal exercises. They are not just fun to do, but also building our body balance and extending the muscle sustainability. I personally benefit  a lot from shoulder bridge exercise, where it messages my back without any body's help. :)

6401474,5,B00K2HZDDK,"As a Physical Therapist, I found this video helpful because each movement is explained simply and clearly doing 5 reps each.  It works not just the ab muscles but also the back extensors which are often neglected in core workouts.  So, I enjoyed Lynn Hayden's inclusion of formal anatomical words to keep it professional but not too much so that people are lost in the technical terms.  After having 4 babies of my own as a PT, I found this workout very helpful to regain my core strength.",1455408000,,489,4.534090909090909
