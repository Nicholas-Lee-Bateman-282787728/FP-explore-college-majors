2569777,4,B000FK03OI,"Surprisingly funny, witty and charming. I'm glad I stumbled across this would be cult classic. Sensitive material is taken in stride and they couldn't have done it better.",1370476800,,171,5.142857142857143
2569778,3,B000FK03OI,"Aaltra, as a movie, has great potential.  Two rather unlikeable characters have an altercation that result in both becoming wheelchair bound.  They have to spend time together in the same hospital room, then without coordinated discussion, decide to seek out the manufacturer of the farm implement that caused their injuries and seek compensation.  Most of the film revolves around this trip.  But everything, I mean everything, seems to happen in slow motion.  Here's an example.  When they are being transported home in separate ambulances following their hospital stay, the drivers stop for a drink.  As a slow, one-sided conversation occurs between the drivers, every so often a hand reaches up from out of sight, recognized as coming from one of the guys in a wheelchair, lifts a beer glass, takes it below the height of the bar, then returns it to the bar with less beer than before.

That's 5 minutes. It was an effective technique for a subtle humor the first time, but it seemed the whole movie was a collection of these slow, laborious vignettes.  And that got me, the viewer, distracted.

I didn't hate the film; rather, I was disappointed that an intriguing film became boring.  I wanted it to end on a high note, and that high note never materialized.",1361664000,2,1264,4.859813084112149
2569779,5,B000FK03OI,Aaltra is an offbeat and very funny twist on an on-the-road movie.  Two not-so-friendly neighbors are brought together by an accident that catapults them on to a shared journey with an unexpected ending.,1337644800,,203,5.151515151515151
2569780,5,B000FK03OI,"Even if I watched this with no sound I would be mesmerized.  Some of the best footage and exquisite editing I've seen.  A must see for anyone in film, or, anyone who wants to enjoy a good flick.",1314662400,,194,4.078947368421052
2569781,5,B000FK03OI,"Directed by comedians Benot Delpine and Gustave Kervern, Aaltra is the unconventional road movie set in Finland.

Two rural neighbors set out on a journey to revenge the manufacturer of the tractor that left them both them both paralyzed, wheelchair-bound. Shot in black-and-white, Aaltra undermines conventional attitudes toward the disabled with its dry wit and acerbic, vengeful characters.

With cameo from famous Finnish director Aki Kaurismki.",1296086400,,449,5.787878787878788
2569782,5,B000FK03OI,"Although this comedy was made in 2004, it is shot in black and white.  In a French town, Gus (Gustave Kervern) is a farmer and a slacker while neighbor  Ben (Benot Delpine) has his own problems with his marriage and his love of the motorcross racing.  The two despise each other.  During a physical confrontation between the two, a freak accident occurs.  The  two men end up in the hospital together, both paralyzed and are resigned to wheelchairs.  They embark on a 2,000 mile journey  to Finland to sue the company Aaltra which makes the tractor involved in the accident.

It may be slightly confusing during the introduction to their dilemna, but the majority of the film takes place after the accident,  Moreoften, hitchhiking is the method of travel.  It is a long journey and the people they encounter along the way provide some amusing scenes.

There is not a lot of dialogue, the subtitles are easy to read.  English is frequently used, and French/Belgium are the languages.  At times, you may think translation is missing, but it is not, it has to do with the storyline.  The  stiff dry humor is black comedy, from  subtle to downright hilarious scenes.  One scene in particular is when Ben takes off on  motorcross bike while the owner is furious and with the usual profanity in English,  shouting ""you give people in wheelchairs a bad name.""  Another is listening to a man sing the popular 60's hit ""Sonny"" in a karoake bar.

Comedians who play the lead characters, Gus and Ben wrote and directed the movie.  The movie is presented by Film Movement, an organization that distributes fine foreign film that focuses on good acting, good writing and directing.  .... This film won several film festival awards.  See it!  ... Rizzo",1264118400,4,1739,4.751677852348993
2569783,5,B000FK03OI,"Next to the movie, a lot of fun is to watch someone seeing the movie for the first time.
Around the house all it takes is to say ""AALTRA"" to get one of us to smile.",1260057600,2,164,3.5833333333333335
2569784,5,B000FK03OI,"This little known gem of a French movie is dark yet funny.  We are introduced to two neighbors who do not like each other too much, but then, most people don't seem to like them either.  An accident occurs while they are arguing and they are both paralyzed.  Their disability did not make them better people.  They decide to go to Aaltra (a factory in Finland) to make them pay for producing faulty tractors, the cause of their accident and so their roadtrip begins....

The men are robbed while waiting for the next train and now, have no way of getting to Finland.  They decide to try and take advantage of being disabled with hilarious to demeaning results.  This movie showed the full spectrum of the their new ""disabled"" life.  People can be cruel to them and they are cruel back but they do manage to laugh and make the audience laugh as well.  Throughout it all, the two men remain focused on their goal - Aaltra, Finland.

They do manage to get to Aaltra but I cannot give the end away without ruining the movie.  This road trip to Aaltra was sorta like the yellow brick road to their personal salvation, which they do receive but not in the way they expected.  I can not recommend this movie enough if you don't mind subtitles (minor note, I wonder why the subtitles were a little off when foul language was used).  It is an extraordinary film.  Although it won a few awards at the lesser Film Festivals, it deserved better distribution and maybe the dvd will allow this movie the greater audience it deserves.",1215648000,6,1519,4.4963503649635035
2569785,5,B000FK03OI,"Aaltra follows two neighboring men, one a farmer and one a telecommuting business man who lives for motocross.  They have a bit of a feud going on, which culminates in a fistfight on the farmer's Aaltra tractor and both men being paralyzed from the waist down.  The farmer directss his bitterness at the tractor that paralyzed them both and sets off for Finland to find the factory.  The business man decides to go across Europe and watch motocross competitions.  They both leave for their trips the same day and their paths keep crossing, much to the chagrin of each, until they finally begin to travel together.

This movie was laugh out loud funny for me.  It pokes fun at society all the way through.  The two men are both unpleasant.  When their wallets are stolen the farmer attempts to mug passersby, while the business man attempts to block parked vehicles and charge a fee to get out of the way.  One even steals an old lady's motorized wheelchair.  They use their wheelchair bound status to stay overnight with a German family as it dawns on the family that they are being milked for free beers.

Other reviews talk about slow pacing.  I didn't find this to be the case.  There are long shots, but for a reason.  For example, long shots of the German family watching the men eat, as the men snap it up and the family grows increasingly pissed off but tries to be polite.  There is always something going on.

This is the most hilarious movie I have seen in a while.  It's well worth finding a copy.  Since it's pricey here, get it on interlibrary loan if you are just curious.",1181606400,12,1586,4.505263157894737
2569786,3,B000FK03OI,"To enjoy this movie, you have to have patience.  It is a quiet movie with little dialog and many long shots of fields or roads or people sitting.  As I watched I wondered why I was doing it, but by the end, I realized I had enjoyed it.  There are funny scenes and a humorous ending.  The plot is that two men have a mutual farm accident and must be in wheelchairs.  They then travel in the chairs to motocross races in Belgium, through Germany and on to Finland to find the manufacturer of the tractor which disabled them.  It is not ""hilarious"" as the cover proclaims, but it is not as sleepy as the pace implies.  If you like gentle, visual humor try this.",1160956800,6,658,4.216

2569798,5,B000FK03OI,"This is such an original movie. So very funny at times, I was laughing out loud, all alone.  With all the bad news in the world a film like this is pure escapism. Not an 'easy' film and I'm sure many will find it awful, but I am also sure many will find it as I have, a wonderful, hilariously funny and uplifting work of art. Beautifully photographed in widescreen black and white. My favorite combination. yes it is absurd but why take everything so seriously? My favorite things about this film are the locations and the people in these locations. the secondary characters, the passersby. the music is chosen with care. hard core rock to absurd lounge singer singing 'Sonny'.  so very offbeat and non conformist. I've never been to Finland but I'd sure like to get there after seeing this film. A breath of fresh air for me.",1447372800,2,826,4.5

There are lots of funny happenings along the way, but the film  suffers from its slow pace--not always excusable. The contrived ending is somewhat disappointing.
