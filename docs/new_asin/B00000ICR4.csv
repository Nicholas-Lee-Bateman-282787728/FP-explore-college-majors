1221151,5,B00000ICR4,"This DVD is an ideal companion to the excellent ""Presenting Felix the Cat"" DVD. Although it contains only 7 episodes, it does span from his debut to the end of his silent days.
The first 3 cartoons (Feline Follies, Felix Saves The Day, Felix in Hollywood are available on Felix's other DVD, but they are of a far stunning picture quality with better music.
The other cartoons are presented with added 1920's music and sound effects (when they were re-released), some of which are a bit crude (especially Felix's constant meowing in Futuritzy), but does serve up an idea of how desperate the cartoon studio was to bring Felix into the sound era after losing their lucrative distribution contract in the late 1920's.
All of the cartoons are well chosen, especially my favourite, Felix Woos Whoopee, in which a drunk Felix is constantly haunted by his booze-fuelled hallunications!
Also included is 1940/1950's colour fottage of Otto Messmer at work designing billboard animations.
This DVD is a must for the true animation fan, but will also serve as an ideal introduction to the early days of the timeless feline!",1027382400,20,1112,4.920212765957447
1221152,3,B00000ICR4,"Great animation is hard to come by these days, which makes this DVD collection of Felix the Cat cartoons worth having. However, one wishes the DVD had been longer than 51 minutes. Surely the producers could have thrown in a few additional cartoons or some supplementary material. As a result, the DVD leaves you wanting more gems such as ""Felix in Hollywood"" (1923) and ""Felix Woos Whoopee"" (1930). The print quality is quite good and the disc includes some color footage of animation pioneer Otto Messmer - the genius behind the cat.",1021593600,7,534,4.815217391304348
1221153,4,B00000ICR4,"I read up on these cartoons at college several years ago and this is the first time I've been able to get to see them - it's fascinating to watch these as examples of the best and most popular cartoons of their time, in the years immediately before Mickey Mouse - primitive as they appear now, this only serves to highlight the impact that Disney's work must have had soon after these cartoons were made. They're still witty and entertaining in their own right, predating the insidious idea that cartoons are a kids' medium, but it goes without saying that they should not be judged by today's technical standards. The few minutes of film of Otto Messmer in his later years is a nice extra, but a page or two of text on the historical background, either on-screen or in a leaflet, might have been  a good idea.",1013040000,10,810,4.472972972972973
1221154,3,B00000ICR4,"Like you probably are, I expected to see the Felix the Cat that I grew up with here, running around with his magic bag of tricks.  That's not what this DVD is about exactly.
These are some of the original Felix the Cat cartoons.  Way before the character we all immediately recognize as Felix was developed.  These are silent cartoons (just a soundtrack played in the background with the occasional screen-sized caption for dialogue or plot).  The art is fairly basic, but the animation is still all right.
That's not to say that this DVD is not etertaining.  It can be quite funny, and it's really interesting to see this very early stage of Felix's evolution.  For collector's and die-hard Felix fans, it's a must.  But for the majority of us who just remember an old friend that we love it's something of a disappointment.",1008979200,5,825,4.6482758620689655
1221155,4,B00000ICR4,"Great stuff! Felix the cat is of course classic animation at it's best. Crazy stuff that has obviously been a big influence on the animation that came later... and still influences.

1221191,5,B00000ICR4,"Felix the Cat is a cartoon character created in the silent film era. His black body, white eyes, and giant grin, coupled with the surrealism of the situations in which his cartoons place him, combined to make Felix one of the most recognizable cartoon characters next to Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck or Woody Woodpecker. Felix was the first character from animation to attain a level of popularity sufficient to draw movie audiences.[citation needed]

Felix's origins remain disputed. Australian cartoonist/film entrepreneur Pat Sullivan, owner of the Felix character, claimed during his lifetime to be its creator as well. American animator Otto Messmer, Sullivan's lead animator, has more commonly been assigned credit in recent decades. Some historians argue that Messmer ghosted for Sullivan. What is certain is that Felix emerged from Sullivan's studio, and cartoons featuring the character enjoyed success and popularity in the 1920s.",1255478400,3,961,5.537414965986395
1221192,3,B00000ICR4,"To be honest, we've only watched the first 3 cartoons so far.

So why am I reviewing it?

Only one of them was a felix cartoon, the second, popeye, the third an older one- not part of a series that I know of.  Good older cartoons to be sure, but, not a Felix collection.

The transfer quality is also not so good.  (It may be that the film's decayed over time).

Even though this is relatively inexpensive, I feel like I paid too much. I'd only buy this one in the bargain bin, and with the knowledge that you are not getting what the title would lead one to believe.",1142726400,20,567,4.109090909090909
1221193,5,B00000ICR4,"I bought 2 seperate dvds of this and neither of them will work on my few-years old player NOR my brand new lite-on DVD drive, NOR on my girlfriend's dvd player. It does, however, work on her parents' player. Im not sure why. The region is correct.

(Im giving it 5 stars to average with the already-posted reviews. I ahvent actually seen all of it yet.)",1134604800,2,353,4.348484848484849
1221194,5,B00000ICR4,"I was never into the old felix the cat cartoon so when I watched this movie for the first time, I had no previous feelings that could interfere with the honest judgement of the movie. I have to say though, that this was a great animated movie with a whole lot of imagination and creativity. It was very entertaining and will definitely stand the test of time with modern animated movies. I would definitely recommend buying it but not for anything over $20. I haven't really seen it that cheap on dvd anywhere, so if you really want it, the vhs will be more affordable.",1112054400,4,569,4.428571428571429
1221195,3,B00000ICR4,"I have long been a fan of the early, silent Felix cartoons. They have a life that few cartoons these days can match (even with sound).
There were many (relatively speaking) Felix complilations on VHS, but as that medium goes the way of the vinyl LP, I wondered if Felix would also be making the move (I doubt a ton of money is made off of silent animation these days, and since money seems to move most things...). Luckily someone did lead the charge, and now I can finally rid myself of the VCR.
This collection has a lot of good stuff in it, but what I found a little irritating is the removal of some of the original title sequences(i.e., the ink bottle sequence with Felix and a drawing hand; it does appear, but not before every toon like it would have originally). This could be seen as a tribute to Otto Mesmer and a slight to Pat Sullivan (Mesmer who is reputed to be the real genius behind Felix; Sullivan's name was splattered all over the titles as he took most of the public credit, but was mainly the PR man for most of Felix's run - see John Canemaker's book on Felix for more info), however, I felt like I was missing out, being a sort of purist when it comes to historical media. The titles of silent animation have as much character as the animations themselves - in the same way that old photographs have a character of their own even if the people aren't familiar. Other silent Felix collections are not edited in this manner (it's the first time I've seen it, at least).
Nonetheless, this collection is a good one, and there is much to be seen here. If you're not sensitive about missing titles (there are worse things in the world, after all), this compliation will view smoothly.
The footage of Otto Mesmer is very interesting, though it's what you would expect: someone sitting and drawing (and he's not drawing Felix; the footage looks like it could be from the 60s - it has a watered technicolor hue to it, and may be discarded footage from a documentary). It's not enthralling, but it's great to have any footage of the master behind Felix at work.",1031529600,27,2074,4.4319371727748695
7910195,5,B00000ICR4,"In my personal opinion, the best vintage for Felix the cat. The pre-1920ies stuff is unique and wonderful.",1500940800,,106,4.944444444444445
7910196,5,B00000ICR4,"Bought this, pretty happy with it. That said, I do have SOME concerns.

To the film's musical people or whatever: The ""sly as a fox"" number made me want to start cutting or find some rope and make a noose.

To the manufacturer: An all-regions dvd with Chinese writing in the menu isn't what I was expecting, but I digress. HOWEVER, occasional slowdown/lag WILL happen because, well, it's a loophole in bootleg laws. An obscure film no one involved in production wants anything to do with is easy to bootleg and sell to nostalgic freaks like me.

Other than those, however, it's a fun, likable movie with a fun character. Felix the Cat: The Movie is what I would call a ""cautionary purchase"". Do your research and always pay through Amazon. Never use ebay or craigslist, never buy it at a flea market. Thrift stores are OK.

Still, be wary of potential cons, and be prepared for lag and other nonsense like Chinese writing on the main menu.

7910204,4,B00000ICR4,"In 1999 Image Entertainment released a DVD compilation of Felix the Cat cartoons, from the characters debut in 1919 to 1924. Inexplicably, Image never followed up with a second collection, and allowed Presenting Felix the Cat to go out of print. Naturally, used copies now fetch high prices. This leaves us with another, briefer collection from Slingshot Entertainment, also from 1999, to take up the slack. The Slingshot release can be purchased for slightly less than a McDonalds Happy Meal, and it will not clog your arteries. The presentation is not as extensive as that from Image, but neither edition is ideal.

Felix the Cat predates Mickey Mouse by a decade but was just as popular in the 20s as Walts rodent was in the 30s. There is a longstanding dispute over who exactly created Felix, but he was born in the studio of Pat Sullivan. Sullivans animator, Otto Messmer, usually (and probably rightfully) receives the bulk of the credit. Felix shot to stardom rapidly, but faded in the 30s when Sullivan was reluctant to make the move to sound, thus paving the way for Mickeys meteoric ascent. The Felix character was revived in a weak, imitative TV series in the 1950s, and has appeared in two execrable feature films.

Although the quintessential compilation of Felix at his earliest (and best) remains to be released, the still-available Felix The Cat 1919-1930 will have to suffice until then.

In his original incarnation, Felix is boxy looking, almost a cubist parody, as are the dialogue balloons. It adds to the surreal quality of the films. Like most early animation icons, Felix evolved. In 1924, he would become lithe and more appealing, as we recognize him now. Although rounder in looks, Felix has not yet lost his sharp aesthetic edge, although that was to come.

Felixs debut is in 1919s Feline Follies. It is an undeniably primitive effort, but does have a surprisingly dark finale. Felix is named Master Tom here (he would be renamed shortly). Master Tom is feeling amorous. Luckily for him, a white feline shows up to pacify his raging libido. Naturally, nothing is easy, and Tom is required to serenade his new lady love. With all this activity, Tom neglects his mousing work, leaving his house vulnerable to an army of destructive Mickeys. This gets Tom booted out of home sweet home and, to make matters worse, Tom discovers his feline is unfaithful. Whats a Tom cat to do? Kill himself at the gasworks, of course!

Felix Saves The Day (1922) beings with Felix emerging from his ink pen to play baseball. A runaway ball lands his human playmate in hot water, with Keystone Kops flying over (live action) skyscrapers to make their arrest! Racial stereotyping in the 1920s movies was certainly not exclusive to live action films: with our human baseball hero in a Tower of London like penitentiary, the team is losing to the Tar Hills, a team of mammy-styled caricatures. Felix climbs up a row of question marks to alert his bosom mate. The only hope is rain, so Felix pinch hits for the team, driving his baseball straight up to Jupiter, who angrily decides to send a downpour to spoil the game. Felix saves what turns out to be a surreal day.

Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart and Will Hays all show up in Felix In Hollywood (1923), making it a delightful time capsule. Felixs owner is a serious stage actor who laments having to go to Hollywood to ply his trade. Felix transforms into his masters handbag, hitching a ride. Once in Tinseltown, Felix encounters the celebrities and, removing his tail, turns it into the Tramps cane. Felixs act of plagiarism incurs Charlies wrath, but after saving Fairbanks from a mesquiteer, Felix earns the coveted studio contract. (This short was listed in Jerry Becks famous 50 Greatest Cartoons, and was the only Felix cartoon to make the list).

Felix plays a good, if questionably effective, Samaritan in Felix Dopes It Out (1924). A down-on-his-luck alcoholic laments the curse of his gin-blossomed schnoz. Ready to eat a bullet, the Felix stops the act of self-murder with a promise of a cure for the poor fellows red nose can be found on the isle of Boola-Boola. With handy question mark in hand, a tub, and some long johns, Felix sets sail. The island is populated by cannibals, who are depicted as ape-like savages. Felix steals the secret cure: Drink more til your nose turns blue.

Futuritzy (1928)  is not prime Felix. The cat has his fortune told by a gypsy, and does not like her prediction of misfortune. He goes to an astrologer next, who predicts riches and a pretty girl. There is an interesting homage to Charles Lindbergh (who had made his famous flight the year before). Unfortunately, yet another racial caricature dates Futuritzy in the worst possible way.

In sharp contrast, Woos Whoopee (1928) engages in full-throttled surrealism, with a narrative excuse: Felix gets smashed out of his skull at the Whoopee Club. In his intoxicated, hallucinatory state, Felix has a run in with a frisky street light, various animals, smokes his own tail, gets swallowed by Jonahs whale (which mutates into an aggressive trumpet), and has to come home to a wife, who mimics his own crouched pacing.

Comicalamites (1928) is inventive, slapstick surrealism. Felix interacts with the animator throughout. Drawn but not inked, our hero gets fleshed out with the aid of a shoeshine man. Felix stumbles upon a weeping feline whose boyfriend has left her. Finding the girl not so pretty, Felix erases her faces a draws her a new one. Now, the potential girlfriend cops a Julie London attitude and catapults Felix in the role of sugar daddy. This means a pretty dress, fine jewelry, and a fur coat. Felix scavenger hunt takes him to the bottom of the ocean, making it the most visually sophisticated of the lot.

Despite the title, there are, oddly, no actual 1930 shorts here (the latest dates 1928). However, there is brief footage of Messmer designing billboard animation. The new musical accompaniment is by Jell Roll Morton and His Red Hot Chili Peppers. This release barely makes a dent in Felixs extensive silent oeuvre, but it is a worthwhile dent.
