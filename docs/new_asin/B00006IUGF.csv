7969715,5,B00006IUGF,This is a thorough aerobic workout which is lots of fun. The pre workout warm up is just right. The cool down and stretches are better than those of other exercise videos/DVDs i have done.,1515542400,,188,4.4
7969716,5,B00006IUGF,"As a cylclist with a broken wrist, I was looking for a workout that would be fun and that I could do with an injury (I even got to elevate my arm!) until I get back on the bike.  I tried several dance videos from the library and liked this one the best.  I like Elise's energy and attitude.  She doesn't count beats and get into it too technically but you can follow along her natural teaching style fairly easily.  I needed to rewind a few times to ""get it"" but it gets easier each time I do it.  I'm buying it now and will be using it alot in the off season.",1123545600,,560,3.920353982300885
7969717,2,B00006IUGF,"This is a joke workout. We do not recommend you buy it.
A Latin rhythm workout. Ok maybe it has some really bad latin rhythms but the workout is a pure USA aerobic workout. Just
becouse you name some USA aerobic steps with latin dance names does not make it a latin dance workout.
This video is a real disappointment.
The aerobic workout itself is a very good length. But do not think it has anything really to do with latin dance.
Vanessa's Afro Brazilian Dance Workout with Vanessa Isaac has much more latin steps in it.",1055462400,5,522,4.391752577319588
