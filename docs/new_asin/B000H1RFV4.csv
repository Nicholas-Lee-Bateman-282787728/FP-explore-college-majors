8135835,3,B000H1RFV4,"The movie is pretty good.  If you are the type who goes into horror movies expecting to be extremely scared with a great story and acting then most slasher flicks aren't for you.  This one isn't too bad.  I would give it more a 3 1/2 stars.  But it is your basic slasher type movie with lots of blood and gore.

Overall though, it isn't a movie I watch over and over again, but it is entertaining enough to either rent or buy if it is under $10.  Some decent entertainment to see for your first time watching this.",1392940800,,514,4.141414141414141
8135836,2,B000H1RFV4,"Heartstopper: 4 out of 10: After twenty minutes this movie really had me psyched. A true Eighties throwback it begins with two characters, a Death row inmate who has trouble being electrocuted (Shocker) and a good looking suicidal shy girl who is called whore by a bunch of teenage cheerleader vixens (Carrie). They meet in an ambulance and the Death row guys tattoo transfers to the suicidal girl. And we all know what happens next don't we.

The girl goes back to high school and takes revenge on the vixen sluts and her mother and everyone else; and there is violence and nudity and sexy high school girls kicking ass. (Okay let me calm down for a moment) Had the movie actually done that I would have been very happy indeed. Instead it just remakes Halloween 2. Yup a basically abandoned hospital with a staff of about 5 people. The serial killer comes back to life (of course) and starts using his patented fist pulling a heart through the chest maneuver (hence the name) which looks silly the first time and gets progressively sillier as the movie goes along.

In the Jamie Lee Curtis role we have Meredith Henderson who is surprisingly bland for a suicidal girl being chased by a serial killer. The killer is played not by headline actor Robert Englund (Who is an Amish Sheriff and leaves the movie fairly early) but James Binkly whose is simply the serial killer that won't shut up

In fact dialogue is a real problem in this film. Nobody talks like real people. All the conversation is either a witty rejoinder or a plot point or god forbid horrible self-conscious foreshadowing. And needless to say few people have been crying out for a Halloween 2 (or Visiting Hours) remake.

The sets are unconvincing and the hospital understaffed. The script and story is truly derivative and pedestrian. While this is hardly the worst direct to video horror movie I've seen. (I'm looking your way Lionsgate) Its biggest fault simply seems to be it does nothing I haven't seen done better dozens of times before.",1268265600,2,2009,4.698863636363637
8135837,1,B000H1RFV4,"Heartstopper (Bob Keen, 2006)

The opening scene of this movie is the single worst I have seen in any film this year. So why did I keep watching it? In order to bring you this review, dear reader, so that if possible, I may be able to spare you the horror of also getting sucked into this mess of a movie. Heartstopper is an unqualified mess of a movie that barely deserves the name; the only reason it doesn't get zero stars is because I actually finished it. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

Plot: Sara Wexler (Meredith Henderson of Shania: A Life in Eight Albums) is considering suicide because of an altercation at school. (We are never told whether the allegations made in flashback are true or not, though in all honesty it doesn't matter; it's just one of the little details that would have made this a better movie.) Well, we think she is, anyway, mostly because the jacket copy tells us. Why do I say this? Because she contemplates throwing herself off a bridge, then decides against it and is just walking down the road on a rainy night. She suddenly stops because she hears a voice in her head (this becomes important) and crouches down, only to be struck a glancing blow by Sheriff Berger (Robert Englund), who bundles her up in an ambulance and takes her to the hospital. He was already on his way there to observe the autopsy of Chambers (James Binkley, becoming a Romero regular), a serial killer whose execution did not really go as planned. He's sharing the ambulance with her. Problem is, said serial killer isn't really dead. Or he's back from the dead. Once again, not explained unless you read the jacket copy, though he does have supernatural powers of facial restoration thanks to the movie's small special effects budget. (A serial killer with an electrified face, now that would be fun. Not here, unfortunately.) Sara, along with classmate Walter (Degrassi: The Next Generation's Nathan Stephenson, who bears a striking resemblance to teen heartthrob Corbin Bleu), is trapped in the hospital with the sheriff, a number of medical professionals, and Chambers, after he kills the coroner and locks all the doors in the hospital (which used to be a mental asylum, and he probably knows his way around because he maybe used to live there... but again, we're never told). Simple from here on: survive and find a way to kill the possibly-undead Chambers before he kills Sara and Walter.

Now, remember when I said the little voice that's whispering in her head right before she crouches down on the road becomes important? Here's why: because while it's obvious Sara hears it (and comes to recognize it as Chambers' voice once they get to the hospital), she never mentions it again. When someone asks if she tried to kill herself, she nods. No mention that maybe she had help. In fact, she doesn't seem to believe she had, help, despite deciding not to jump off a bridge a very short time before. Are you following the logic here? Of course you're not. Neither is anyone else who saw this movie, because there's no logic to be found at all, only what seems to be a rewrite grafted over the first draft of the script without anyone reading for continuity (see all the other side notes in the synopsis, and that's just the tip of the iceberg).

I wish I could say this movie had some good points, especially because it's so closely modeled on a much better slasher film of recent years, Masayuki Ochiai's Infection. But Heartstopper took the surface idea from Infection, a dingy rural hospital with a killer running loose, and did nothing with it. There was certainly room for improvement over Infection, but this takes all the potential and flushes it down the drain. Nothing of worth here whatsoever. ",1260489600,,3721,4.692189892802451
8135838,2,B000H1RFV4,"Wow, i was expecting something much more...i think that the plot was solid and the idea was good but i got annoyed mor then anything at all of the missing parts...for one they tell you who dies...the actors are horrible...the black kid (nathan stephanson i think) acts like he's a 10 year old white kid, the killer talks to much and besides the one very gory part it was boring. like i said before the plot was good (in a hospital a ton of people to kill...but no there was 6 people to kill even if they kept the horrible acting the killer talking so much and they tell you who dies then if they had the hospital full of people like they usually do that would hav mad eht efilm ten times better...oh yea and then it just ends and you don't know what happned and you don't care becaseu it ended so abruptly.",1177113600,2,806,4.2064516129032254
8135839,5,B000H1RFV4,"I am a huge fan of Meredith Henderson

I really wanted to see this movie

I think if you don't like Meredith then don't rent the movie

It is a classic gore fest

But for me ,

I loved it",1168300800,2,187,3.575
8135840,2,B000H1RFV4,"I will only give this movie three stars. The plot to me was fair , could have  been better but not bad.

I only watched the film because I am fan of Robert Englund.  I think he did a good job in this film and the only reason why  I seen it. The other actors were good I think. Good actors but not a good film to show their skills.

The Killer, is maybe the worse thing in the movie. I found myself just want to smack him in the head during  the whole film.  I just wanted him to shut up half of the time. He talked to much for my liking, just to damn much.

The gore was great and done well.

A okay film that could have been better with alot more work and more changes.  Be sure to read reviews,, half of the time they are right.

After the death of Robert Englund in the film. I found it boring after that.

A good movie to maybe rent but not spend 20.00 dollors on. DONT EVEN BOTHER! RENT IT IF YOU CAN.

They also spoil the film by saying who dies . They say that Robert Englund  "" who plays on the good side of law for once"" dies in the film and the other kids are left on their own. A big Killer and the ending.

I did not even get the ending or how it even tied with the killer .  I didn't get how it played with him and the devil or gof for that matter. The worse ending I have  ever seen in a horror movie. And I  have seen many other bad horror movies. I only liked Robert Englund and the gore. That's it.",1164672000,,1415,3.7713310580204777
8135841,3,B000H1RFV4,"Did you ever think you'd see the day where Freddy Kreuger would play a heroic sheriff?  Wait no more.  Robert Englund has a supporting role as the sheriff in this average gorefest.  Englund's sheriff watches as dreaded serial killer Jonathan Chambers (a creepy James Binkey) is electrocuted and hauled off to the morgue for his autopsy.  Along the way they pick up a suicidal teenager (an effective Meredith Henderson) who is in the ambulance with Chambers and sees he is not quite dead.

Once we get to the hospital (another one of Hollywood's deserted hospitals), Chambers goes on a killing rage to locate Henderson, whose body he plans to take over and continue his killing spree, apparently in some bizarre deal with Satan.  Director Bob Keen keeps the tension pretty intense and even though the tornado conclusion comes out of nowhere, it does have a certain eeriness, with the predictable ""Oh, no, I'm not safe"" ending.  It's not the best of its lot, but it's viewable.",1163376000,2,975,4.837349397590361
8135842,2,B000H1RFV4,"The whole reason I bought this movie, when I saw it in the store,
was because it starred Robert Englund (for like about 20 minutes, mind you)
and the cover art seemed pretty sick.
I flipped it over, read the back, and was still interested.
Supernatural Mass Murderer on a killing spree
(ripping peoples hearts out and consuming them for sustenance)
in a locked hospital.
Sounded awfully cool, especially for a gorehound like myself.
I paid the 15 bucks, brought it home,
and then for about 90 minutes, cursed myself
for not waitng for a review on this unmemorable waste of my money.
So here it is.

Likes:
A couple of buckets of blood,
a few hearts,
an open chest cavity,
Robert Englund (although not even he could save this film from the depths of the bargain bin),
and a Pac-Man T-shirt.

Dislikes:
Continuity be damned.
In one scene the killer(Lets just call him Captian Cliche)
has sulfuric acid poured over his head,
and you see his flesh bubble, you see it.
Two Scenes later, TWO SCENES LATER! (without eating any hearts)
Captian Cliche's back to his normal crazy self.
In another scene the heros clothes are soaked in blood,
in the next scene not so bloody.

The Killer in this movie is what ultimately killed it for me. (no pun intended)
He just wouldn't shut up.
Cliche' after cliche'.
EVEN WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE AROUND!!
He just spouts them off to himself.
Theres a reason Leatherface, Jason Voorhies, and Michael Myers are feared and admired.
They know when to shut up and be menacing.
Everybody else in the movie was fine.

Some of the special effects at the begining were silly.
(Flesh shouldn't burn like paper)
Although the moving tatoos were interesting.
The ending was equally as silly.
SPOILER: A hurricane comes and sucks him away.
I'm not kidding, a hurricane.

If it wasn't for the two heros occasionally cracking jokes,
the brief time with Horror Legend Robert Englund,
and varios disenlodged organs.
I would have all but hated this movie, hence the extra star.
