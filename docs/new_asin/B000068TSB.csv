1726521,1,B000068TSB,"Please note that despite the packaging's attempt to make this look and sound like a decent low-budget horror film with good special effects (even making the cartoon characters look possibly computer animated in the images on the back of the box), it's really just a horrible movie filmed in 3 days on a home video camera.  The acting is horrible, the sets are horrible (even consisting of things like cartoon backgrounds drawn on hanging sheet), and the movie is mind-numbingly low-brow and apparently only exists for its high gore content, a sentiment which is reinforced by the fact that the intro, previews, and plea to join their fan club...all seem to cater towards a cult following of patrons interested in nothing but pure low-brow gore.
Like some of the people who reviewed the DVD version, I didn't make it very far into this movie, and actually apologized profusely to the people who I unwittingly subjected to it with my uneducated rental.  Don't be fooled into a rental..or *gasp* a purchase...by the packaging...this movie is utter...and isn't worth watching even for hardcore horror fans.  The only thing I learned from watching what little of this movie I could stomach is to avoid Brain Dead Films like the plague.",1036540800,,1230,4.932367149758454
1726522,3,B000068TSB,"Terror Toons is a film worthy of rental, but only if you are looking for a gory good time. The plot isn't necessarily scary, but instead it relies on some of the nastiest scenes of gore and over-the-top violence that I have seen in a movie to date. Think I've just got a weak stomach? Rent this film, and see how well you can stomach some of the scenes. However, if gore and a raunchy good time is what you are looking for, then rent it, but don't purchase it! Trust me, the film has enough blood, guts,  insanity, and above all, laughs to keep you from turning it off, but I just couldn't see myself watching this more than once. Plus, it's shot on a home video camera...so...3 stars for the fun factor involved.",1032652800,,713,4.281481481481482

1726525,3,B000068TSB,"I just watched Terror Toons, and here's my review of it.
The plot is nothing special, of course. In this kind of movie, it's the execution of that plot that makes it worthwhile. So is it worthwhile? Some yes, some no.
The bad stuff: the acting, dialog, and the human characters. None of them are very memorable except for the main characters' mother, who is played by a drag queen[!] and who in one scene complains about her husband getting drunk at a wedding and moonwalking into the cake. That got a small chuckle out of me. Every other person is just dull; played by horrible-to-barely-mediocre actors spouting clumsy, cliched slasher-flick dialog.
The good: the villains, the gore/special effects, and the production design. This is one of the better looking, more ambitious direct-to-video horror quickies I've seen. Dr. Carnage and his monster-monkey assistant Max are appropriately freaky, if not actually scary, and they take great pleasure in creatively carving up the cast of disposable characters with exagerrated cartoon weapons; think Itchy and Scratchy, but live-action. The music/soundtrack accentuates this. It's very inspired by Beetlejuice and goofy sound effects are used as a jarring accompanyment to the murders. The sets are very skewed and funhouse-like, with bright colors and weird props; effective use of lighting creates a scary-funhouse kind of atmosphere.
The bottom line: you've got to see this movie once to experience it, but repeated viewings are not essential, in my opinion. It's an acceptable drive-in-style slasher flick with some minor innovations, nothign more.",1029369600,,1600,5.303149606299213
1726536,1,B000068TSB,"After watching the trailer for this, it looked like the ultimate so-bad-its-good movie...but boy was I wrong.  It tried SO hard to be that that it fell completely flat on its face on every level.  I watched this with other friends who also enjoy so-bad-its-good films and they also thought this was awful.  It was also far too long, even at 75 minutes.  Everything about this is so bad, and so obvious that it was intentionally bad, that it loses all of the charm that gives most so-bad-its-good movies their appeal.  They even had a porn actress playing the role of a little kid, nudity and all.  Avoid this, unless you're really looking for the worst of the worst.",1389744000,,666,4.554621848739496

1726538,3,B000068TSB,"Terror Toons is a creative horror-comedy. It's not scary at all, and it's not too funny either (except for when Candy and Cindy's parents are onscreen), but it's got gore galore. It's about cartoons who pop out of the televison screen and start killing people in some of the grisliest ways imaginable. Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, and Michael Myers don't even do this much damage when they murder people. I'm talkiing decapatations, intestines, and some poor guy even loses his brain.

1726542,4,B000068TSB,"Possibly one of the most bizarre horror movies out there. Worth seeing for novelty value alone.
Two sisters get bothered by a creepy cartoon video, sent by the devil, no less. (Of course no-one knows it comes from the devil at this stage).
One sister loves it so much she inadvertently releases the characters from it into real life, so we get to see Dr. Carnage and Max Assassin (!) on a fun-filled, murderous rampage amongst the ranks of the silly sisters and their friends, boyfriends, whoever, it doesn't really matter, no-one is going to seriously care about any of the characters in this movie, it is just throwaway fun.

1726543,1,B000068TSB,"I cannot believe that I am writting a review abou this movie. I remember I actually picked the movie up at Hollywood Video as a joke to someone that always rents bad horror movie. But this has to be the worst joke I have ever played on someone. We both started to play the DVD and sure enough a guy pops on the scene with some spiked hair and a really crappy voice (He was trying to sound scary but he sounded more like he needed to go number two). He talks about the film and than it starts. We got about a strong three minutes in the movie and than returned it to Hollywood Video (even putting a word in to take the movie off the shelves).
I really don't know where to start with on what I hated about the movie. I can say that the film quialty looked something like a Hi-8 camera filmed it. Or I can say that both the stars looked like some girls they met at a Bordello. I can even say that the set and props all looked they were rented from a high school theatre arts class.

Who in their right mind thinks up stuff like pulling someones innards out and then pulling their upper skeleton half of the body out, holding it up and laughing like a madman? when I first started to watch it, I started to trip out because the freaky looking punk rock looking guy who was in disguise, looked and sounded like DR.

1726551,1,B000068TSB,"I can't begrudge anyone for having fun making a homemade horror movie. I used to do that when I was a kid, and I would always have a great time. The best thing about it was that I didn't have a script going into it; I just made up the sequence of events and the dialogue as I went along. After it was completed, I'd show it to my parents and friends. Everyone had fun watching it, including myself. However, my pleasure in making horror movies didn't delude me into believing I had to share it with the general public, and I'm sure those of you who own a video camera would agree. The only ones who don't seem to agree are the people behind ""Terror Toons,"" a film that proves anyone (and I really do mean anyone) can write, produce, and direct a film. These are the kinds of people I begrudge: the ones who feel that a cheaply made home video qualifies as a professional movie.

It's absolutely incredible that this film got released; no one in his or her right mind could have expected this blatantly amateurish work to be taken seriously, and if they did, then they need some seriously expensive professional help. It's a crude, barely half-hearted attempt at entertainment, setting into motion a wrongly conceived excursion into the world of storytelling. Its foray into violence and gore was so juvenile that it barely passes as laughable, and its intentionally cartoonish special effects were so low grade that ""special"" doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence. Who really wants to see a doctor scooping bloody entrails out of a person whose eyes are spinning like the googly peepers of Cookie Monster? For that matter, who would want to watch performances or hear dialogue that wouldn't even pass muster in an elementary school play? It wasn't a case of bad acting for the sake of satire or comedy; the people cast in ""Terror Toons"" simply could not act.

Even the story leaves a whole lot to be desired. When sisters Cindy (Beverly Lynn) and Candy (Lizzie Borden, of all names) are left home alone for the night, Cindy and her friend, Amy (Kerri Liu) decide to invite a couple of boys over for a little party. Of course, the conveniently absent parents have strictly forbidden this. But as we all know, teenagers never listen to the rules their parents set (especially since, in this case, the ""mother"" is played by a man). Candy initially protests. But as soon as she gets a mysterious package in the mail, her attention is averted. It contains a DVD called ""Terror Toons,"" and she immediately runs upstairs to watch it. I guess she didn't care that she was given an item she didn't send away for. Then again, why should she? Despite the fact that Lizzie Borden is a twenty-something busty blonde, she's playing a character whose mental capacity can't be above that of a ten- or eleven-year-old (if you don't believe me, watch the scene of her taking a bath while singing ""Rubber Ducky"").

Upon inserting the disc into her player, Candy immerses herself in a fast-paced, frenetic freak show of a cartoon series (despite the fact that all the characters are real, physical people). The two most prominent characters are the twisted Dr. Carnage (Matty Moo)--a mad scientist stereotype with a green colored, goblin-like face--and Max Assassin (Scott Barrows)--a monkey genetically altered into a gun-toting killing machine. Their appearances can only be compared to mass-produced Halloween masks, a quality that didn't do much to add to the film's credibility. But apparently it's credible enough for Candy, who watches their shameless exploits with the quiet enthusiasm of a kid watching a Saturday morning cartoon. At least, that's how she behaves at first; eventually, the show ends, leaving her with nothing but a shot of a hypnotically swirling spiral. She then falls asleep, giving Dr. Carnage and Max Assassin ample time to cross through the television screen into our world.

Meanwhile, Cindy and Amy invite Rick (Brandon Reininger) and Eddie (Fernando Pedilla), two typical horror movie males who like to work out and bring alcohol to parties. Their arrival leads to a discussion of what they should do, and almost immediately, it becomes a sexually charged debate: the guys want to play Strip Poker while the girls want to fool around with a Ouija board. They eventually compromise on a game of Strip Ouija. Even though I have no idea how this game would work, I wouldn't have minded watching this scene. I actually didn't mind it at first. Then I noticed the board itself; the filmmakers actually spelled out the name of the game as ""Weegee."" Was this done on purpose or did they genuinely not know how to spell the word properly? Ultimately, I realized it was pointless to try and figure it out.

It was also pointless to understand the direction this film went in. The demented toons eventually make their presence known to the rest of the cast, resulting in a mishmash of cinematic blunders, including a slew of over the top death scenes, most of which involved a series of oversized props. All of these murderous moments make use of slimy animal organs that are drenched in stage blood. And from that description alone, it's obvious that this is the kind of unnecessary drivel that would barely appeal to immature teenagers, let alone the horror movie demographic. How could it when it includes a cop (James Sullivan) that follows the rubber-faced killers into the real world? For him, the motto, ""To protect and serve"" amounts to nothing more than an excuse for an incredibly condescending attitude. And would it surprise you to learn that he likes donuts?

When Cindy meets the Devil (Jack Roberts), I came to the conclusion that the public should never have seen this. I'm sure the actors had a lot of fun working on ""Terror Toons."" In fact, I hope they did; no one working on something this bad deserves to be stressed in the process. But it can't be denied that this has all the qualities of a made-to-be-laughed-at personal film, something to be viewed only by family and friends. It's a disgraceful attempt at filmmaking, and it has no place in video stores or even in the thoughts of the movie going public.",1149724800,,6148,4.76266416510319

Terror Toons is the type of horror-comedy that gets trashed by so many people who were expecting something different when they slid the DVD into their player. I'm here to tell you, if you're not a fan of the cheesiest, dumbest, kookiest film making available to the public, then this is not for you.

A couple of satanic cartoon characters are released into a  house hold from a cartoon dvd delivered to the house by Satan. These 2 cartoon characters are there to kill who ever possible. In all sorts of cartoonish ways.

The acting is bad but to the point where you will keep watching, the gore is definitly there and not bad at all. The 2 daughters must be porn stars as some else stated, when you see you will be able to tell why. The plot it self is funny as the 2 cartoon killers are definitly hmorous.

To watch this you got to have an open mind on what it is. Its not really a horror movie just quit funny, silly and gorey, just watch it to have fun, that is all, and enjoy it for what it is.

A destined cult classic, I don't know ** MAYBE ***, but a film that should be viewed by horror fans that have an open mind and can watch something as ridiculous as this and enjoy it I did. Its just fun and humorous. With some very bad acting.

1726557,4,B000068TSB,"To preface this review I would like to warn the curious potential viewer that the aforementioned film is not for the faint of heart, moderately squeamish, or anyone who would characterize themselves as ""sophisticated"". As Joe Castro states in the special features, he filmed this movie in three days for $2,300. It's conception was based on a Radiohead bumper sticker Castro and the producer saw with a violent looking cartoon, at which point they mused about what homicidal toons would be like.

  The film, as can be surmised by the budget, is so bad that even indie student directors producing off minimum wages would cringe. The set, albeit colorful and incredibly unique, exists entirely in the house of one of Castro's friends. The ""music"" is a single, grating theme that one could swear was stolen nearly note for note from far more notable, legendary composer(Danny Elfman) straight from a far grander, memorable film(Beetlejuice). The acting is abysmal, the plot, were the viewer to actually analyze what little there is, full of holes, and unfortunately for someone who isn't at least partially sick by conventional and commercial terms of psychiatric health, the film is rather long for a B-movie horror, clocking in at nearly two hours.

  The ""terror toons"" themselves, a purple Gorilla with a tommy gun by the name of Max Assassin and his creator the mad scientist Dr. Carnage, are two men in cheap costumes purchasable at any local halloween shop. All this aside however, the movie itself is actually highly entertaining, in a reasonably disturbing fashion. Though the script is incredibly awful, or more specifically because it is, the dialogue becomes so wretched that it is incredibly humorous. The murders themselves are so zany, so completely over-the-top that they break the bounds of what one would consider the horror genre, and quickly transcend into the realm of comedy. This is greatly aided by the sound effects, namely a kazoo and things often affiliated with Looney Tunes. With silly sounds, goofy cackling from Dr. Carnage, and what can only be described as universally manipulated chimp laughter provided by Max Assassin, it's hard to take grotesque torture seriously.

  And grotesque it is. The gruesome twosome run the gambit of macabre, from human puppets to a full frontal labotomy. The gore-fest is constant, but the gore itself is so cheesy that it is very hard to take seriously. Add to this the worst animations in film history, which really have no place or reason to be in the story(i.e a pesky mosquito), and over all you have a movie that is so terrible it becomes hillarious.

  I chose to write this review because after reading the other member's commentary I felt that not a single one of them did the film justice. They either said that it was the worst thing they had ever seen and left it at that, or they said they loved it and never explained why. Granted, everything about this movie is atrocious, but the overall effect is one that had this viewer rolling on the floor with laughter..I did say you had to be at least moderately sick = ) And I guess the joke is on the haters because since it's release the film has had a rather large fan base and serves as the archetype for brain damage films, Castro's company. If you're the least bit curious and want a ""demented"" movie that will have you laughing when there is no plausible reason to, go out and rent Terror Toons.",1119225600,,3423,4.822525597269625

I'm not even taking budget into account,a good idea and a competant script even worth writing let alone filming are free. This piece of crap had to stop I didn't even finish watching it, thank god I had enough where-with-all to not destoy the disc, thank god I only rented this piece of crap. DO NOT BUY THIS, DON'T RENT THIS, DON'T EVEN LOOK AT IT AT THE VIDEO STORE, DON'T FINISH READING THIS REVIEW, just close your browser and walk anway from your computer and try to forget that you even heard about this movie. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE SO-BAD-IT'S-GOOD MOVIES IT'S INSULTING TO HUMANITY.

1726566,3,B000068TSB,"Terror Toons...what can be said about this huge pile of crap? I really don't even know where to begin, probably from the begining, yes? It starts off with the story of dr.carnage and his assistant, then it soon moves to Lizzi Bordon naked, with the mind of a 5 year old...as if thats not expected...then, you discover the parents are going to a wedding...a two day wedding?...The parents tell the girls not to have anybody over, but, as you never would of guessed, the older sister has a few people over while the younger sister is upstairs watching a newly arrived dvd in the mail titled ""Terror Toons"", which is of course directed by satan himself. Soon the toons come out of the TV and terrorize the teens. But wait! thats not all! The older sister turns into a super hero and visits satan, then, of course, destroys the toons and all is well again. I give one star to whoever directed this simply because he had the guts to put this out, and two stars for the side-splitting laughs I got out of this.",1077494400,,1004,4.4324324324324325
1726567,1,B000068TSB,"I'm so confused. Was this movie SUPPOSED to be scary and gory? Or was it supposed to be funny? Because it was none of the above. You know when something is SO bad that it becomes funny? Well this movie was SO bad that it went way past the funny level, and caused immense feelings of disturbance and rage. I wanted to hurt someone or myself after watching this. Whoever says this movie is gory must have half a brain. The peoples guts that were being ripped out was clearly cooked spaghetti and lentils. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It also didn't help that during every ""gory"" part all u hear is the Mad Doctor's irritating, shrill, corny laughter, a bicycle horn honking, and morphed circus music playing, accompanied by the purple Gorilla jumping around like a moron making stupid Chimp skreechy noises in the background. (I have a monkey plush toy with the EXACT sound effect as the gorilla sidekick..honest) This movie was so low budget and..well just bad. I'm all for independent and undeground films. But this was worse something u would see on your local cable access television show. The ""special effects"" were ridiculous. Remember computers in the 80s and early 90s? Try to think of the Print Shop program and all of their marvelous graphics. Those are the graphics that were used. Sorry to be a spoiler, but when someone was cut apart, they appropriately copy and pasted an image of a cartoon vulture. The vulture was a still picture, no movements at all. Who would have enough self esteem to add their names to the credits of this piece of garbage? The devil apparently. (yes it says made by The Devil in the opening credits) I mean, I'm ashamed of myself for having watched the entire thing. The previews before seeing this movie were priceless gems also. One movie has Ron Jeremy in it (whats with all the porn stars in these movies??). Another one is called Carnage: The Legend of Quiltface. These people put out a movie about a mass murderer named Quiltface. Need I say more?? Normally I would say don't rent this movie, however I kind of want the rest of the world to experience what my friend and I did. We had a good time ripping on it, but in the end it just left us hollow shells of human beings. We will never recover.",1074816000,4,2248,4.539408866995074

The movie goes off into different tangents and during the movie I wondered if there was a beginning, middle, or end.  The plot twists are abrupt and you may have to watch it a couple of time to truly make sense of the movie.

The incredible CGI and oscar worthy acting keeps ur heart racing this whole film. Freddy Kreuger,Jason Vorhees,Michael Myers these are all names we think of when we think of horror well after watching this film nobody strikes fear into my heart like the viscous duo of Dr. Carnage and Max Assassin. Not to be forgotten is the acting of Lizzie Borden who you can find naked anywhere on the web she reaches deep into her soul to make this film work.

If you thinking of renting or buying this movie, I say go for it. why? Lizzie Borden is hot, for one... dressed in her schoolgirlish charm... but besides that, the main reason to get this is for the scene where little Lizzie's spine, gets ripped out of her back, and she gets used as a puppet. come on now, if you like evil shtuff like that, this movie is worth seeing at LEAST once.",1058745600,2,690,4.2748091603053435
1726581,1,B000068TSB,"A few months back, I named ""Not Another Teen Movie"" as the worst movie ever. Well, as horrible and not-funny as that movie is, this one, called ""Terror Toons"" is even worse. At first it's fun to laugh at it. The production value is terrible the acting is atrocious and there is absolutely no plot. Then the movie gets annoying. Then gross. Then finally it gets unwatchable. This happens in the first 25 minutes of its ghastly 110-minute running time. There is tons of gore, many scenes that tease with possible nudity, endless scenes that have nothing to do with the rest of the movie, and not to mention the worst villains ever. The funniest part of this farce is the pitiful introduction by what we assume is the director. Words fail to describe the horrible execution. Imagine some loser with punk clothing and spiked hair speaking in what he hopes is an evil voice telling you about the villains of the movie and trying to make them sound evil and ferocious. The saddest part of all of it is that he looks proud of this movie. This is what happens when idiots with absolutely no creativity decide they can make a movie. The little kids in my neighborhood have done better than this.",1056758400,3,1186,4.546728971962617

But if you can put that asside, you should really enjoy this movie. The movie is about Dr. Carnage(Matt Falletta) and Max Assassin(Scott Barrows), they get out of the cartoon world through a DVD that is made by the Devil. Young Candy(porn legend, Lizzie Borden) watched this DVD and sends these Creatures free in our world.
The only one who can save us, is Cindy(Beverly Lynne, Candy's older sister.

1726584,1,B000068TSB,"It was a rainy ""memorial day weekend"", the local theatres were mobbed, so a friend and I rented this steaming pile of ...
Yeah, I've made intenstinal sculptures that were more appealing than this mess.  I fully expected to MST3K this movie to death, and oh boy, did I ever.  The VHS version has the producer/director/some dude behind the scenes, come out in a leather jacket, spiked hair and the worst ""i'm a bad guy fear me"" tone in the history of cinema and deliver the entire plot in 1 minute, before the actual ""feature"" begins.  The plot, the acting, the sets, the characters... it's all toilet tissue.  The single greatest special effect was the 4 seconds of nudity provided by the ""little girl"" (who looked like a 20something stripper with amazing fake boobs, Lizzie Borden? yeah..right) Not to mention this cross-dressing troglodyte who through 9 pounds of make-up, hair, and nail extensions was unable to pull off 12 lines of dialogue (as the MOM character no less!) in anything resembling a high range voice.  Indeed, the gales of laughter my friend and I received when ""she"" attempted to 'scream' and at the conclusion of the movie, and ""her"" voice was lower than ""DAD's"".... reminded me of Herman Munster in drag.... sad.  (Eddie Izzard you aren't...)
I can go on and on about this train wreck, I am still trying to figure out how the heck this junk made it to the shelf of my local video store......",1053993600,3,1412,4.673387096774194

1726587,1,B000068TSB,"OK, one question in this review:  Were you a fan of Mystery Science Theatre 3000?
Those who answered no, hit back, there's NO way you'll want to even TOUCH This video.
If you answered yes, I recommend renting this movie - only buying it if you want to drive friends crazy when they stop by from out of town.  The gore in this that's much hyped is SO laughable in it's attempt to be over the top, that's not much of a factor unless someone is really bothered by it - for example, whenever anything 'gory' happens that MIGHT look disturbing, they hold the camera on it for 5-10 seconds to provide ""maximum gore"" level.  The problem with this is that, simply put, effects fall apart when you study them too closely!  You'll see the brains are oatmeal, that the top of someone's head that just got carved off is quite obviously a hat, as is the exposed brain which is obviously liver, etc.
Why do you want this movie then?  Because it's so bad, it's good.  NOTE:  IT IS BEST WATCHED IN A GROUP SETTING!  We had a blast ripping the movie to pieces as it progressed, steadily getting more and more ridiculas.  Even the VHS version has the behind the scenes section, which is great - it repeats the same scenes over and over and when they ask people if they like how the movie came out, they ACTUALLY pause and think about it for seconds before trying to lie their way out of it.
You also get the classic moment where one of the actress likens one of the special effects experiences to her previous role in a movie titled ...  In fact, that about sums up the whole movie:  Gore porn.  There's less than 4 seconds of actual nudity but the acting, video quality, sound quality, plausability - that's pretty much what it seems like.
So rent this movie, turn down the lights, and watch it all the way through - the Brain Damaged trailers really set the mood with the awfulness, too, so don't skip them!!",1037491200,6,1892,4.358974358974359
