7473950,5,B016JB0JGS,"Everything I could want in an indie romance movie.  All of the characters had redeeming qualities, even when it appeared that the ""pretty, blonde, rich girl"" may have been a snot (spoiler: she totally wasn't)...there was never any cat fighting, bullying, name-calling.  It was refreshing, to say the least.

Everyone had things they needed to overcome, and they all did.  The small town setting made me miss home terribly, and I will admit...a cute boy with blue eyes in a Bronco?  SWOON!!!

Loved, loved, loved it.  Will definitely be looking for this on Blu-Ray.",1452470400,4,564,4.9361702127659575

7473952,3,B016JB0JGS,"I bought this for my granddaughter who loves horses, this movie has very little to do with horses, a small segment is about the rodeo.  Rather disappointed, movie was Ok for an adult to understand but my 9 year granddaughter lost interest.  Bad choice for this Nana!",1451260800,,266,4.638297872340425
7473953,4,B016JB0JGS,This film was an unexpected indie surprise. I enjoyed and it got better as it went along. Good clean independent film with quirky characters.,1450828800,4,141,4.916666666666667

7473955,5,B016JB0JGS,"I saw this film at the El Dorado Film Festival and fell in love with it!  Great writing, authentic characters, lovely soundtrack and definitely family-friendly.  I am looking forward to purchasing this and watching it with my children and grandchildren.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who wishes to watch an uplifting movie during the holidays.",1448150400,3,353,5.157894736842105
7473956,4,B016JB0JGS,"I also saw this at a film festival and enjoyed it immensely.  Great story, well cast and I was smiling or laughing through the whole film.  So glad I can now obtain the DVD to share with family and also send a copy to my niece (with 3 children 10 to 14) who will appreciate a film that's engaging, touching & funny without uncomfortable scenes & profanity.",1446595200,7,356,4.298507462686567
7474012,4,B016JB0JGS,"This was a much more enjoyable movie than I had expected. I mainly watched it because it was filmed in this area and I wanted to see the local references and extras. I enjoyed those, but really liked the storyline and underlying messages. Too often I end up wanting my time back after a movie is over, but this was time well spent. Good job!",1459296000,,341,4.2615384615384615
7474013,5,B016JB0JGS,My family and I love this film. It keeps getting better every time we view it. A feel-good film which reaffirms the importance of community.,1458950400,2,140,4.64

7474018,5,B016JB0JGS,"I grew up in Texas and lived in the Ozarks for some time.  This movie is spot on a love song to both regions.  I wish I had daughters, because I think this would be one of those dad (or mom) movies I would have loved to watch with them.  It is essentially two love stories, and both would have prompted fun and caring discussions about what real love can be and how good men and women can treat each other even when they're frustrated.  The story is well written and directed, with special props to the director of photography who presented us with a visually lovely film to watch.  Joey Lauren Adams' part is regrettably small, but I think its enough to show how far she's come as an actress.  I'll also point out that this film has an extraordinary soundtrack.  I'm waiting for the CD to come out, and I imagine it's one I'll play repeatedly in my car on long road trips.",1454371200,,873,4.254545454545455
7474019,5,B016JB0JGS,I love this movie and Kris Allen's song Love In A Small Town is excellent and perfect for the scenes in the movie. I also love the fact that Kris appears with Mary Steenburgen on the movie even for a little bit.,1453852800,,211,4.0476190476190474
7474020,2,B016JB0JGS,"Not really good acting, B movie",1453593600,,31,4.333333333333333
8736599,1,B016JB0JGS,"This movie portrays itself as Christian but I couldn't help walking away from it thinking it was mostly blasphemy.  I would not recommend this movie unless you enjoy them mocking Christians and Jesus by calling him ""Jerry"".  I'm not overly sensitive, I expect the world to look line the world and that is fine but I don't care for movies that appear Christian to be a mockery.  For what it is worth the movie was mostly clean but there were questionable morals.",1518825600,,461,4.597560975609756
8736600,5,B016JB0JGS,Also has a great soundtrack!,1496188800,,28,4.8

sweet",1473465600,,75,5.333333333333333
8736602,3,B016JB0JGS,"This 2014 film is the kind of independent production that usually goes direct to home video where it finds its audience.  There is one for this film but its definitely aimed at those who live in small rural towns. Yes, the central character, Emily, comes from the northeast (New Jersey)  during her summer vacation and learns the small town life. When the film starts you learn that Emily is looking for a summer job and the only one she can find is selling Christian books door-to-door (theres a lot more than just bibles) bibles in the south. All this is played for laughs and I started thinking I was watching the Broadway musical The Book of Mormon (but without the offensive words). I was ready to give up but stuck it out and it was entertaining.  Its really a coming of age story and, if you like those, youll probably like this one.

Emily is played by actress Jordan Scott (in her feature film debut) and she does well. The marquee name here is Joey Lauren Adams. Actress Mary Steenburgen is not in the film but per se but she co-wrote the original song used in the film Love in A small Town with American Idol winner Kris Allen. Allen sings the song on the soundtrack and on the soundtrack CD.

There virtually nothing offensive in the film  I think it won some Dove awards.  And its played at a number of major regional fil festivals.

The DVD has no special features.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8736606,5,B016JB0JGS,"Valley Inn stands out in a sea of mainstream films with its honest and unpretentious story telling. The cast might not be big names but deliver performances which will draw you in.

Sure enough the film does not have any groundbreaking plot, but its strong story character development makes you feel with the characters. What you get is a sweet and kinda romantic film which really is just ""Love in a small town"" (a song sung beautifully by American Idol winner Kris Allen).

If you are at home and just wanna rent/buy a film without explosive and boombastic sequences, Valley Inn might just surprise you.",1465689600,,605,4.752380952380952
8736607,5,B016JB0JGS,"I appreciated this movie for its interesting plot, clean language, realistic characters. I am familiar with the region of the country in which this story takes place, so I was amused with how true some of the details were for the area.  All in all, I thought it was a sweet story with decent values that I would watch again with my teenagers. I like movies that generate conversation with my kids because the story raises issues (even if they aren't earth-shattering) which makes us think.",1465171200,2,489,4.686046511627907
