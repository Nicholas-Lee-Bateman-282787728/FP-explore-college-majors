8271151,5,B0018TYBUM,"*Note* this movie is only able to be played on multi-region DVD players. It will not play on standard DVD players sold in the US.

Augusta's Battle is based on the book by Martha Tod Dudman, which tells of the real-life ordeal of her daughter, Augusta. The movie and book go hand in hand, and this film is fantastic for teenagers, particularly teen girls going through difficult times. This film is well-acted and deals with suicide, drug abuse, parental difficulties, and school-related issues. This film is far superior to ""Thirteen,"" which is popular among teen girls in the US.

The cast does a great job, particularly Mika Boorem as Augusta, as well as Sharon Lawrence and Tim Matheson, who play her parents. This is convincing, and real, and at times it is a gut-wrenching story of a misplaced teenage girl coming of age. Being that this is based on true events and real people, it tends to have more of an impact on teens than typical Hollywood-produced crap. I would strongly recommend both the book and the movie.",1298073600,4,1022,4.735955056179775
