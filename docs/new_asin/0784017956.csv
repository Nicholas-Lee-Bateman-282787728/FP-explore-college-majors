73487,4,0784017956,"This is a great beginner's video.  The exercises are easy but still give you a great sweat. After gaining 40 pounds, I considered my physical fitness days dead.  But because it's low impact, there are days when I am  doing the tape in the morning and evening. I loved this tape so much that I  bought another copy for my mom, who also has high praise for it. We are  both addicted! There are only two things that reduces it from a five-star  tape. The background noise of the beach is a bit distracting and,  therefore,  it is sometimes difficult to hear Denise Austin's instructions.  Additionally, the tape does a lot of repetition.  But if you're a beginner  like me, that's also very comforting.  All and all, GET THIS TAPE.",921024000,5,728,4.515384615384615
73488,5,0784017956,"This is a great workout for beginners- or people who don't have alot of time. It's about 25 minutes. Extremely easy steps to remember and to do- but it gives you a workout too. Denise Austin is slightly annoying, but once I got used to the workout I turned her down, and some of my favorite music up. Really great- if you're just starting. Or are out of shape.",1006905600,2,360,4.231884057971015
73489,5,0784017956,"This video has the ocean as a backdrop and is easy to follow along with the program.  No complicated steps here.  I love this workout tape and do it at least 5 days a week, religiously.  It helps me relax and get in tune with myself.  Not, to mention, I've seen results after only 4 weeks!
I highly recommend this for beginners and intermediates alike!  You'll enjoy it!",997660800,6,370,4.382352941176471
73490,3,0784017956,"This was my first exercise video. I did gym-dance several years ago and from there never stopped dancing, be it in the disco, creating choraographies, and so on, so I like things with a bit more pace, but this is just right to start out if you are out of shape (after having my daughter I ended up about 40 lbs too heavy) and want to get moving. It has prety simple moves, but not too simple that you won't be challenged. And if you do it regularly for a while, it will prepare you for some real stuff, like some serious cardio.
I gave it 3 stars only because I have now not used it for a while, as it's not challenging anymore, plus Denise's constant chatter becomes a little annoying after a while...",996883200,3,702,4.207407407407407
73491,5,0784017956,"Nice and short, as well as not too tough.  The steps she uses are NOT hard, and I am no dancer!  Even if they are a little difficult for you, it would only take a couple repeats of the tape to get them down.  I highly recommend this video for beginners, those who have fallen out of working out, and those who need to lose a lot of weight (talk to your doctor first, of course).
Denise allows you to get a workout without killing yourself.  You feel your heart rate pick up and your muscles working, but you are not dying like you might be in an aerobics class.  This great combination makes me want to get up and do the tape again, as opposed to other tapes where I just think how boring and painful they can be and decide to watch TV instead.  After a while, though, this workout can get too easy, so you have to step up to the next level and buy a new tape.  But if you are pressed for time and need to get in a light workout where you won't be drenched with sweat, this video is great.  And, of course, Denise is her ever-enthusiastic self and does a fantastic job in motivating you to work harder.",993859200,21,1102,4.069444444444445
73492,4,0784017956,"Between a long bus commute and my work schedule, I have only a few spare hours in the evening. Combine that with an early sunset and cold wet winter weather and that has left me desperate for an exercise outlet!
I am at least 50 pounds overweight and very out of shape, but since this video is only 30 minutes, it is easy to squeeze in at night and I end up drenching my teeshirt each time.  This video is too short to be tempted to skip!
The first time I did the video I wondered if it was ""enough"", since it seemed easy, but I think it is since I am sleeping well, I've got some light muscle aches in my butt and legs (3 weeks into it), and I find it a lot easier to tolerate the sitting on that long bus ride.
I cannot do the moves as smoothly as Denise does, but the key is to ""keep moving"" - and she reminds you often!  I also notice that as I keep doing the video, I see more details in her moves, I incorporate more details into my own moves, and I get better at doing the video!  For example, her cha-cha metamorphasizes into another move which requires that you stand up on your toes as you turn from side to side. I did not immediately see that the first week I was doing the video.
I like Austin's ""whole body"" approach too, in that while she's moving she talks about drinking lots of water and eating healthy food. If you keep playing a short video several times a week that reminds you of those things, pretty soon it starts to have a positive impact on you.  If you feel dumpy and depressed about your physicial condition, it's got a good psychological effect.
Austin suggests doing the video 3 times a week, preferably 4.  She also says you should start seeing results in 6 weeks, but I assume that means you've also cleaned up your eating habits enough so that the exercise will have some effect!",984441600,10,1812,4.180515759312321
73493,5,0784017956,"Having been familiar with Denise's older step videos, I was pleased to have found this workout tape when I was looking to get back into excercise. It provides an easy-to-follow, 35-minute workout (so that I have time to do it in the morning) which provides just the right intensity level for burning fat. It's great because you can do it without any equipment, and I can do it indoors (and out of the cold Michigan winter). It's nice to see the ocean (the workout is on a beach) when all I have is snow outside my windows. I've been using this and a toning video 3-5 times a week, which along with a healthy diet, has allowed me to lose 3-4 pounds each week!",980726400,16,658,4.314516129032258
73494,1,0784017956,"I was really disappointed with this video, for a number of reasons.  First of all, Denise is standing near the ocean, which makes for a nice view, but the noise of the waves seriously interfered with the sound quality -- at times I couldn't even hear her!  Also, I found the choreography to be far too intricate for a beginner.  It was nearly impossible for me to keep up (granted, I'm no Ginger Rogers).  And last but not least: Denise looks great, but it would have been nice to have some other people there . . . maybe even some with more ""average"" bodies.",972950400,3,559,4.346153846153846
73495,4,0784017956,"After college I got a job working under flourescent lights at a computer all day, needless to say my butt seriously started to spread - along with  the rest of me!  When I decided to get back in shape joining a gym seemed a  little intimidating.  I needed something that was convenient, fun and would  provide a good cardio workout without causing me bodily harm.  Luckily, I  found this video. The routines were challenging, yet can be learned  quickly.  Denise provides a great total-body workout that is energizing and  fun.  I love how she adds dance steps to the workout, my favorite segment  is a cha-cha/mambo combo that really works the waist and hips. This was a  perfect way to ease back into working out and is still a lot of fun to do  in the mornings as an energizer.",966384000,6,780,4.478571428571429
7790788,1,0784017956,"Again, I thought I was purchasing a DVD, but it was in VHS format.  I was very, very disappointed as I already had it in VHS format.  I think they should make it more pronounced.",1397174400,,178,4.057142857142857
7790789,5,0784017956,I was very happy to be able to find this tape on=line.  I had purchased this tape 10+years ago but mine was worn out.  This tape is a wonderful replacement.  Thank you.,1388102400,,168,4.1875
7790790,5,0784017956,"I was looking for a beginner aerobic exercise tape.  I am 76 years old and have always been involved in ""some sort"" of exercising. Seeing my doctor recently he said I should be doing aerobic exercising instead of Pilates. So I read your reviews and decided to go with the positive ones. Upon receiving the tape I ""watched it for a practice run"" and thought I'll never be able to do this. But, Denise says to go at your own pace, so I did and I am really enjoying it.  I haven't reached to 30 min. mark yet, or working as energetically as Denice, but I am working toward it and looking forward to keeping up with Denice.. Doctor's orders.. Thank's to Amazon for the convience and reviews that allowed me to order this tape by email..",1260403200,,732,4.335766423357664
7790791,4,0784017956,"I recently purchased three videos with exercises aimed at getting one back into shape.  The other two were Startin' Simple Easy Aerobics and Fabulous Forever with Mirabai Holland.  This was one of the best of the three.  I haven't exercised for three years, and I am recoveing from knee surgery.  I found Denise Austin's Xtralite aerobics easy on my limbs and fairly easy to follow.  She is, as always, invigorating and inspiring to watch and follow.  My only concern is that people who have never done aerobics might have trouble following the routines.  She does not always explain the steps, and she assumes viewers know basics such as grapevine and ball-change steps. People who do not already know these things will probably feel frustrated the first few times they use the tape.  Austin also adds some hops and skips to the routine, which I can not do.  They are not mandatory, and I am not even sure she is aware that she does them.  But Denise is Denise -- energetic, bouncy and breathless.  I love her, and this tape has been a great help for me.",1073347200,2,1055,4.618279569892473
7790792,4,0784017956,"Frankly, this tape is rather boring. Denise is at the beach again, exercising all alone and babbling her head off about how great exercise is for you. I wish she'd get a better scriptwriter! But this video is what it says--a basic low-aerobic tape with good instruction on form. It would be a lot more fun and motivating if other people were in it, and if the music were better. I have to force myself to face this tape, daily. It's just so...dull.",1042934400,2,448,4.409638554216867
7790793,4,0784017956,"This tape is great for beginners like me who can't remember the last time they exercised! I took an aerobics class a few years ago, and I can tell you that the steps you'll do with this tape are very similar to what you'd do in a class. The workout itself is at a good level - simple enough to not get lost, but difficult enough to get a good workout in the short time span.
Denise Austin seems to be very enthusiastic that you have taken the first step to making yourself healthier. At the end, she seems so proud of you that you think she's going to cry. And, it made me feel better to notice that she's not just a pretty face - by the end of the video, she was sweating, too!
The only really bad thing about this tape is the music. I don't know where they dug up this muzak, but it sounds like an 80's movie gone wrong. If Denise is motivational, then the music serves the exact opposite purpose.
All around I am happy with the way I feel (even though I've only had the tape a week) and am pleased I bought this tape. It's getting me up off the couch and EXERCISING!",1034035200,3,1069,4.047169811320755
7790794,5,0784017956,"I found this video to be great!  Seems easy but you end up sweating by the time the video is over.  Denise keeps you motivated while giving you little tips throughout the video.  I've seen results by using this video along with a couple of other videos by Denise Austin (Pilates, Super Stomachs, Hit the Spot).",1027900800,2,310,4.5
7790795,3,0784017956,"The low-budget production of this video puts an overall damper on it, but I still use the tape to get me moving.  It's a good half hour of lite aerobics, but still a challenge for the beginner exerciser, or for someone like me, who just has bad cardio and needs to build it up.  The music isn't anything great and she blabs more with positive drills like ""you're doing great, keep it up"", than instruction which would be more helpful so you know what she's doing next.  The exercises are marching based so they're easy to do.  As I said before, it gets you off the couch and gets you moving.",1020902400,,591,4.297297297297297
7790796,5,0784017956,Denise Austin leads a terrific doable workout for the beginner. Am really tired of all the muscular intermediate-advance workouts. More beginner's tapes like this should be produced to get everyone moving.,1018483200,,205,5.645161290322581
7790797,1,0784017956,"I am a beginner/almost intermediate who has loved Denise's workouts for years (although I didn't excercise much).  I was also about 100lbs overweight when I purchased this tape, and bought it in the hopes of getting a routine that was not too complex but would get my heart rate up.
Unfortunately, this workout is beyond Xtra lite.  I only did the routine once because it really was boring and ineffective.  I didn't work up any sweat or increase my heart rate.  Also, the music was so boring!  I ended up putting on my own music and improvising dance moves while the tape was on!  I do still love Denise and would recommend some of her other tapes that use interval training.  This is good for true novices and those who have very limited physical abilities.",1011571200,,759,4.5777777777777775
