1861698,5,B00008T259,"Delightfully sly comedy about the eternal struggle for supremacy between men and women, a contest which women of course won decisively centuries ago but which men keep contesting, the fools. Peter Sellers and Robert Morley are sublime and hilarious and the script is adapted from a James Thurber story. Wonderful. Wonderful.",1491004800,2,324,5.372549019607843
1861699,3,B00008T259,"This is a funny ENGLISH picture.  It is from1960 and is full of misogynistic themes because at that time it was a ""man's world"".  If you can get past the dated attitudes and just take the picture as a comedy you will enjoy it.  Remembering that at that time women were making strides in business in the U.S. but in Great Britain things moved slower, especially in Scotland which was (still is?) one of the bastions of male dominance.
As the plot states, an American Business woman is engaged to bring an OLD Scottish firm into the 20th century.  Her improvements to communication and filing actually work (until sabotaged by the Peter Sellers character) but of course she goes too far, she does want the firm to go from Scottish Tweed to Synthetic fiber, a sacrilege in anybody's book.
The picture and sound are VERY good but I only give it 3 stars as Kino Lorber never has SDH.  (update: I have been corrected in the comments section that KL DOES have films with SDH).  For older people SDH is almost a must today and for pictures from the U.K and other countries where accents may make it especially hard to understand dialog it is helpful, in this one they try not to overdo the accents as they probably wanted to sell it in the U.S. market as well.  Kino Lorber does find many films that normally do not get an updated release and do them in DVD and BD but The Criterion Collection does the same thing and they always have a full restoration of the film, along with SDH and usually hours of extras.  For what KL charges as its list price the least they should have is SDH.",1479340800,2,1576,4.391752577319588
1861700,5,B00008T259,"This is one of my all-time favorite films.  Sellers is brilliant in this film.  Just wish it was available on region 1.  I bought the region 2 as I have a DVD player that can play those, but would have preferred a region 1 so I could play it on any of my DVD players.  Seems so many great Sellers films aren't available anymore on DVD, such a shame.  He was a genius.",1365552000,6,367,3.9726027397260273
1861701,4,B00008T259,"Lesser known British Comedy  film from the earlier days of  comedic great Peter Sellers.
Here Peter Sellers re-teams with  ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" director Charles Crichton to deliver another biting comedy and examination of culture clashes. Peter Sellers plays a meek accountant in a firm that produces Scottish Kilts. When the ole time owner kicks the bucket, his son inherits  control. However, the son comes with his new partner, an American woman! Mrs. Barrows played by Constance Cummings.  She has some very different ideas about how to run a business. The old stogie accounting department will never be the same.  Sellers, the head of the accounting department has been given the task to acquaint her with the firm. She is rather taken aback by its many arcane ways of doing business and insists on immediate changes. Changes, that the accountant views as a grave threat to his existence.

This classic British  comedy is based on the short story ""The Catbird Seat"" by author James Thurber.  Interestingly enough the British horror director  and cinematographer  Freddie Francis was the director of photography on this 1959 film.  Freddie Francis went on to direct some infamous 60's and 70's  horror films like Torture Garden, Hysteria, and Girly. He won the OSCAR for his cinematography on the film GLORY (1990) and achieved wide acclaim and nominations for his work on the 1993 CAPE FEAR remake.",1212624000,8,1406,5.060869565217391
7986778,5,B00008T259,"Peter Sellers was a very talented actor.  Way before Closeau and the Pink Panther ,he did a lot of movies that were absolute gems.  This movie is one of them.  With a great supporting cast,  Robert Morley, Constance Cummings and even Donald Plesance.  This is a highly entertaining movie.  A Don Quixote  tale of an older man fighting to keep his company's old world values.  It's a  fight against the onset of mechanization vs higher profit and a loss of quality in product.  Buy this movie.  It has not been shown on TV in many years, and that is a shame.  Even TCM  seems to have missed the boat on this one.",1524441600,,611,4.348214285714286
7986779,5,B00008T259,I had been searching for this DVD (that can be played in the US) for quite a few years. Found it at Amazon and I am one happy shopper! This film is on my Top 10 All Time Favorite Films list. The quality of the recording is superb ... much improved over the very old VHS tape I had made from a TV broadcast many years ago. What a treat to finally be able to laugh uproariously while watching Peter Sellers at his finest. Reasonable price and quist shipment.,1523923200,,456,4.134831460674158

7986783,5,B00008T259,"Vintage Peter Sellers in a lesser-known vehicle.  Robert Morley is a howl as the scion of an ancient family business, and Constance Cummings as the brash American is great.

7986787,5,B00008T259,"I love this movie and consider it one of Peter Sellers best. It's in black and white but that adds to the humor setting. Constance Cummings is exceptional and understandabley would drive anyone over the edge.  I give it 5 stars because that's all permitted, but it's worth more.",1493251200,3,278,4.673469387755102
