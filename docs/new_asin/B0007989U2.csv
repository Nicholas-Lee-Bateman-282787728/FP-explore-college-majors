8046115,2,B0007989U2,"I like watching Amerian comedies of young people (too many might be INSERTED with a PRODUCT LINK here).

I like watchnig American comedies of Afro-American young people (read of a PRODUCT LINK above) surely.

Of course, neither everyone is W. Smith, nor in every movie world stars could play, but this produce is soooo boring that even I hardly like this music clan's either music or a plot underpinning.",1248393600,,404,4.840579710144928
8046116,1,B0007989U2,"while the Chicks in this Film kept my eye balls rolling all over,the film itself was a pure dud&that is being kind.it wasn't quite what i was expecting.this film must have been filmed at someone's crib because low-budget&no real spark is felt all throughout this picture. I always support various films but this is meant for a Garbage bin period.",1115510400,,346,4.783333333333333
8046117,2,B0007989U2,"Audrey comes from a musical family.  Her parents who still dress like its any year but 2005 use to be in a 70's group, and have yet to let go of that.  Her brother is a music mogul, and her sister is a rap artist.  They've all decided to grace Audrey with their unrepentant presence.  She's done her best to hide that part of her life from her man, and her sorority sisters.

I don't know why I do it.  I go into the stores looking for certain movies, and it's always another movie begging me to rescue it.

""PLEASE BUY ME!""  I walk past it a few times looking at other movies.  As I'm nearing the register I make one sweeping look and again its saying.

""PLEASE, I won't disappoint you!""

As I sigh I'm shaking my head.  Hubby was like this is some bull$#@! My oldest Diamond and I tried pressing our way, but to no avail.

Is it a law that low budget movies have to be loud, super bright, with the worse possible characters trying incredibly too hard?  Everything is SO EXTREME in low budget movies.  I don't mind watching a movie that never hit the theaters, but I don't want to watch a movie that's crap all the way through.",1113868800,5,1128,4.181395348837209
