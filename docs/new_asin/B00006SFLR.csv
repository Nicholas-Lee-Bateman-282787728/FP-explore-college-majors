8172411,4,B00006SFLR,"I knew nothing about Artrosis prior to purchasing this DVD, never even heard any of there music. Only reason I got this DVD is because they are a gothic band with female vocals, and I love female-fronted gothic/symphonic bands. Metal Mind Productions really did a good job on producing this DVD for an independent label. For a band that has not made it to mainstream, they actually sound good. My only thoughts as to why they can't bust out of Poland, is maybe because they don't perform in english and they don't use a drummer. This DVD is packed full of goodies, along with the concert you get videos, interviews, live bootleg performances, and audio tracks. So any gothic/symphonic fan that likes female vocals, this is a good purchase. Again, for a independent label, they did an excellent job making this DVD.",1337126400,,814,4.73943661971831
8172412,5,B00006SFLR,"Artrosis is/was an outstanding goth metal band from Poland.  This 2002 concert was recorded at the height of their career.

Heavenly female vocals by the pretty Medeah.  Her delivery is not operatic, instead using some ""chanting"" to add to her alto-pitched singing.  Heavy duty guitars mix with moody synths.  Songs are very interesting.  Progressive without being technical.  Artrosis sounds like no one else, very fresh.  More uptempo than most goth metal.  No male vocals.  Drumming is programmed, but that sounds much more boring than it really is, thanks to the genius of synth player/songwriter Maciej.

I think the no drummer thing always held Artrosis back as far as popularity.  Also, their English is limited.  They write in Polish.  Each album has 2 releases, one Polish, one English.  Someone else always translates, and Medeah doesn't have the confident delivery as when singing in her native tongue.  Artrosis also never got any promotion outside of Poland.

This release has songs sung in Polish.

There are loads of great extras on this well-produced DVD.

I highly recommend their first 3 albums, Hidden Dimension, In Nomine Noctis, and In The Flowers' Shade.  Go to soniccathedral dot com, lasercd dot com, or gemm dot com for those.",1137801600,4,1251,5.099009900990099
