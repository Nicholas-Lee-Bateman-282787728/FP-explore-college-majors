8198462,5,6304623585,"a fascinating history that discusses not only the military miracle that has allowed israel to survive in a sea of hostile neighbors, but also scientific innovations and contributions in medicine and farming that have made israel an important technological powerhouse.",1262390400,3,267,5.7
8198463,1,6304623585,"This was an informative historical video in as much as it shows (hopefully) the viewer how an attempt has been made to propagandize the Arab/Israeli conflict. It was definitely made with one purpose in mind. Throughout the entire film not one mention was made of the death and destruction that the Zionists committed against the Arab population. Not one reference was made about the brutal murders that were committed by the Zionist militias like the Irgun. Or how almost a million Arabs were driven from their homes and communities. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 10 for blatant bias alone. History is never one-sided, despite what's portrayed by films like this one.",1022457600,,672,4.752136752136752
8198464,5,6304623585,"This video is an amazing video on how israel started out, and how it is what it today. The video focuses on the first couple of years of Israel. Another very good video that also comes on DVD, is ""israel, 50 years war"". I highly recomend them both. They are both very good videos (DVD'S) and really show in-depth how israel started.",982540800,12,332,4.370967741935484
