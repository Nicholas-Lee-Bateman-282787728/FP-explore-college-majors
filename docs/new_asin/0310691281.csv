1921,5,0310691281,"John Ortberg is one of my ""go to"" guys. I buy his books as soon as they are published, and am seldom disappointed by what they have to say. I had no idea this book would be wrapped around John's relationship with Dallas Willard, another great Christian thinker and writer. I am about half way through this exploration of the Soul, and I have to say that in a world full of Christian bestsellers filled with shallow ideas and superficial teaching, this is a drink of cold water for my own soul. I am so grateful for someone who defines Christian faith and ministry less in terms of bigger and wider, and more in terms of deeper. This is a book much needed in our wold today",1402704000,3,672,4.299212598425197
1922,5,0310691281,"This is John Ortberg's tribute to his friend and mentor Dallas Willard.  As usual, contemporary anecdotes and scholars paired with the wisdom of past saints.  Best understood by the study facilitator in conjunction with the book.  Ortberg communicates with a rare mix of wisdom and humor.  You will laugh out loud, and also be touched deeply.  I bought the DVD alone before the curriculum kit was available and bought the book and study guide on Kindle.  The study guide is also good.  I have since purchased a hard cover book to keep and several to give as gifts.  All the Willard/Ortberg material is enlightening and moving, but to see John Ortberg describe the mentoring role Dallas Willard played in his life at critical times of despair and questioning will be an encouragement to anyone.  This is being presented in a Sunday School class with a 45 minute window of time.  It can be done, but it begs for more of an opportunity for discussions.  The comments from participants are all positive.  This one will change you.",1401753600,6,1026,4.767045454545454
