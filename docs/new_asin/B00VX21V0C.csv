Content: 2.5/5 stars

This dvd set sits inside your average dvd case... on the outside. On the inside you will see 2 discs sitting on the left and right side of the dvd case. The left disc contains 2 movies, while the right containing 3. This is fitting 6 hours of content on one disc, 4 1/2 on the other. Quality can be 4mbps (mega bits per second) at times, which (if you want very high quality out of a 2015 dvd, which is ~20 year old tech by now?) you might be disappointed. No special features (out of low budget disaster movies? Ha!) makes it an expected release on my end.

Flood: 3.5/5 stars

This miniseries is the longest miniseries that is disaster related at 196 minutes, beating titanic! The cgi special effects were great for when they're used. Mostly it is real water usage, and that makes it even better! It was great finally seeing a miniseries where there was no violence, although there are referneces. (guns firing but not seen) There is some infrequent language here, but for it being not rated, what else do you expect? Acting was also quite good. This miniseries is probably my favorite out of this movie set, like many others.

Flood: A Rivers Rampage: 3.5/5 stars

This film was based off of a true story of the historical mississippi river flood of the summer of 1993. Barely any CGI effects (which was actually good) and it was mainly real-water effects. The acting was real good for a movie like this. Some rescues and thrilling scenes, along with no language of any kind makes this a family movie you, and maybe your kids too, won't forget.

Killer Wave: 2.5/5 stars

The acting in this one was better than some others on this set in my opinion. The special effects were good but the amount used were really low for a 3 hour miniseries, especially the 2nd part. Some good moments but not enough to make this movie worth your time. Same concept as the next title reviewed.

Tidal Wave: No Escape: 2.5/5 stars

From the movie's description, it looks good. But there isn't much wave action. And imagine CG visual effects... in 1997... with a low budget movie... yeah. The acting was alright. In some parts, the movie had double speed scenes. Felt too fast. Overall it was a below-average disaster film with mediocre special effects.

Tornado!: 2.5/5 stars

The acting in this one is pretty good. The cgi special effects however... The tornadoes were 90% visible, 10% tranaparent. You can kinda see though them, and the tornadoes themselfs are pretty bad looking. They did a pretty good job on the debris effects however. With only a few tornado scenes throughout, this one probably won't be very entertaining to those who have either seen twister and/or expect at least decent effects, or the hollywood movies people. This one will disappoint.

Overall: 4/5 stars

A couple good/great titles, depending on your look of movies, and a few mediocre/bad movies make this pack a great addition to any movie collection! For the price i payed ($5.89 plus tax) makes it 4.25 stars outta 5 but you could pay more so it's 4/5. I hope this review helps you decide on wether or not you buy this set. Thanks for reading!",1434585600,4,3193,4.628318584070796

The price is VERY good,as I write this review--- I paid more.

Here's what I did:
I bought a similarly titled collection (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Storm-of-the-Century-Stephen-King-s/dp/B00AMXSFRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Storm of the Century Stephen King's</a>), also available

8711465,5,B00VX21V0C,"So far I have only watched the movie, FLOOD. A RIVER'S RAMPAGE, which is part of the five Disaster movie collection, STORMS OF THE CENTURY. I watched it thinking it was a totally different movie. And was pleasantly surprised by who the actors were and how well they portrayed their characters. I didn't expect to see Richard Thomas, but thoroughly enjoyed his depiction of a grieving widower, a dedicated father, and a town leader. It's a PG family movie for slightly older children. In 2008 there was a horrible devastating flood of the Mississippi and it was heart breaking how badly the towns along its banks stretching from from the North down to the Gulf of Mexico were effected.

In this movie it starts raining and doesn't sto. The dedication of the residents in towns the river is shown, as well as their heartbreak. I remember candidate Obama filling sandbags in Iowa. It's exhausting work. It takes like minded people working towards a common goal. This is a tension filled family drama that was very entertaining.",1510012800,,1024,4.818181818181818
