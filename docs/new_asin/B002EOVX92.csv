3918645,5,B002EOVX92,"A group of guys from an advertising agency -- including one young man who has been struggling to paint a portrait of his father, but can't properly visualize the man's face -- are looking for inspiration for an ad campaign for a cleaning fluid. They decide to take a jaunt into the woods and come to a very bad end -- although exactly what the nature of that end might be is eerily unclear. The first half of the film is basically all ominous, atmospheric set-up, aided considerably by the brilliantly creative sound design that is also integral to the film's nightmarishly bizarre second half. Horror fans with conventional tastes will likely hate this fascinating first feature from writer/director Graham Reznick (see the clueless one-star reviews below). In fact, you'll be more prone to enjoy I CAN SEE YOU if you can appreciate avant-garde filmmakers such as Kenneth Anger and Stan Brakhage at least as much as you enjoy John Carpenter or George Romero. The thing is, some viewers have an appreciation for cinema as a visual art form and some are just blind to it. To be engaged by a film like I CAN SEE YOU, you have to have an imagination to engage in the first place, and an inherent feel for the sort of dark poetry of the subconscious that's on display here. The DVD also features THE VIEWER, a terrific, award-winning 3D short film that plays with your head in an oddly dizzying way.",1361059200,,1395,4.629032258064516
3918646,1,B002EOVX92,I can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Not horror not anything really but a very boring very slow stoner's idea of a bad camping trip.,1350777600,,165,4.0
3918647,1,B002EOVX92,"Please use this time to do something rewarding or productive.  Do not waste your precious time on this.  It is a high school ""art"" film at best, and a cynical attempt to separate people from their hard earned money at the worst.  I was too patient, and gave this movie too much time thinking that it must improve.  It never did.  Sad, Sad, Sad attempt at moviemaking.  Don't encourage these people by renting or buying this waste.",1301270400,2,430,4.51948051948052
3918648,4,B002EOVX92,"Graham Reznick's ""I Can See You"" is not the resurrection of the horror genre, as critics from the Village Voice have so grandstandingly claimed; it is, however, a fun tour de force into a psychic zone that many people will indeed have to watch a movie (this one?) to experience.

The linear plot really doesn't matter too much.  Three ""ad men""-- the contemptible, snakey Doug (Duncan Skiles) , the..strange Richards, looking like an ad himself for a return to 70's apparel, and the robotic Kimble.  Kimble is sorta like every person you've ever met in your life with no personality and, strangely enough, a girlfriend who has plenty (Neal Jonas).

The three go camping to brainstorm for new ideas to represent their moutwashing product.  The whole thing is a bit incongrous: these three actors, obviously green, are art house hipsters trying to act like businessmen (not really though: it's barely concealed.) This adds, however, to the disorienting atmosphere which is at first darkly comical and then becomes sinister in a way which is difficult to articulate.  If Luis Bunuel and David Lynch had collaborated on how a man's psyche can breakdown during stress, *perhaps* this would have emerged.  Rebellion against the Daddy figure plays a big part in Richards' serious breakdown (the scene in the lake with hippie girl Sonia is perhaps the most effective).

The chief flaw with this noble endeavor is that it is TOO MUCH Lynch.  I don't know if the gang had been smoking j's and repeatedly watching Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive repeatedly or not, but it sure seems that way sometimes.  Coming with a set of three D goggles and an entertaining short ""interrogation"" film, this is well worth the watch if you'd enjoy the brain matter of every tweaked filmmakers smattered together with a sprinkle of acid here and there.  I did.",1286409600,2,1834,4.902912621359223
3918649,4,B002EOVX92,"""I Can See You""  is a fascinating low-budget horror film by Graham Reznick.  The three-man staff of a boutique ad firm leave their Brooklyn home base and head to a rural campsite to toss around ideas for a new campaign for a household cleaning product.  What begins as a low-pressure brainstorming session becomes a horrifying nightmare where the borders between reality and imagination, sanity and madness, are re-drawn or erased completely.  Director Reznick moves things along slowly at first, with few traditional moments of terror.  He backloads the horror and makes the viewer wait for it by creating a feeling of unease, laying the groundwork for the fireworks in the final reel.  I was reminded of several films -- ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" ""The Evil Dead,"" and ""Un Chien Andalou"" -- though ""I Can See You"" has a unique quirkiness all its own.  Special features include a behind-the-scenes featurette, deleted scenes,  and cast and crew audio commentaries.  Also included is the 3-D short (yes, those glasses are included) ""The Viewer,"" shot entirely from the perspective of an accused killer facing interrogation.  Like ""I Can See You,"" ""The Viewer"" evokes genre clich&eacute;s only to subvert them.",1258416000,8,1205,5.133333333333334
3918660,2,B002EOVX92,"This was a real bizzzzzzare movie. I'm assuming they lost the account.

.......and you wonder why half of big city go getters are on anti depressants and tranquilizers. One assumes they went to upstate NY, hmmmmm, interesting; wasn't aware Children of The Corn had a chapter on the East coast.

Aside from the extraneous commentary, the acting was dreadful. The storyline was incomprehensible; maybe it made sense if one were on truly serious medications but other than that, I have no idea what was going on. I'm not certain but I'm going to assume this was about someone having a very serious nervous breakdown or something along those lines.

whatever",1420416000,,654,4.927272727272728
3918661,4,B002EOVX92,"Wild beautiful ride in this good, maybe great, indie horror film. Starts slow, but worth the wait. NO ZOMBI DISCLAIMER: Surprised me with beauty and depth, and was 100% free of zombification, were-animalification, vampirification, slipknot knockoffs, and puppetry.

Big rewards for those into gorgeous psychedelia. Another reward is a back story disguised as sensuous arthouse inquiry into how the mind works under the influence of advertising...and other stuff that I won't describe, because that would constitute Spoilage.

Digital photo artifacts plague the quest that takes buddies-turned-startup dudes looking for ad campaign inspiration into the woods of Upstate NY.  What's happening in the photos they desperately need so they don't lose their only major ad account? Is it micorhyzomes ['shroom tentacles]making all the mischief? Bad lens?  Searching for Nature memes to promote a household product, we follow the four friends on a visually gorgeous descent into the psychic landscape that slips in and out of the green and black leaves and stones of the physical landscape, all courtesy of more than one ""unreliable narrator"" .

If you've never been to a film festival, never had college friends in art school or film school, never taken psychedelics, never watched things go horribly wrong on a camping trip, see this film anyway, so you get the chance in one single great little movie to catch up on all those vanishing rites of passage for a vanishing middle America that rarely breaks the tether of mobile devices, rarely leaves the couch or the game console to do anything real or interesting.

BTW, if this long review feels praise saturated, I must say there is some bad, hammy acting by one of the main characters. I don't think it can be accounted for. Unless it was a lack of budget to redo a couple of the scenes.

Nothing I've typed into this blank white space this morning really covers the explorations of the Deep Self and the side-trips into the meaning of friendship, into  cameras vs paintbrushes, inspiration vs profitability, autonomy vs freedom that I CAN SEE YOU takes you through.

So the double dose of tension between those who create and those who sell,  in other words, the so-American personal stuff of start-ups and advertising-- is the backstory of this impromptu camping escapade where the problems ain't the camping gear. Weird but not over-quirky, this film tastefully hits some retro Roger Corman notes in how we see transformation and in the end shocker. In a more campy way, it also folds in a David Lynch style wiggy narrator-in-front-of-blood-red curtains trope. Altogether though, it works. I realized the David Lynch parody provides a few occasions of silly contrast, an important relief from the otherwise non-stop rush of beautiful imagery and horrors.

The style breadcrumbs here are filling, more protein than carbs, because they're beautiful yet feel hand-made crafty, like lush effects in saturated color, bizarre imagery, and odd textures, probably inspired by experimental films of the '60s and '70s. And rarely available on Amazon. Those kinds of films are shown in film school or art class and can still be seen in the dwindling handful of restored film palaces of New York, San Francisco, L.A. and a few college towns. These art school-style visual gems hook you up and hook you into several weird worlds...and lead you along the crooked path to a couple of fine ending twists.

Thrills come, along with refreshingly small artsy doses of violence, in lashes of quick cutaways that never seem indulgent or pornographic.

Then there's the soundtrack, replete with the now familiar ghost elephant throbs of Tibetan trumpets, low gamelan style gongs and nano noise particles that swarm and weave themselves painlessly into that spooky glittering leash.

Then there's the faux folk song over the end credits. I laughed in the wee hours and may have waked up the neighbors. The song's a nutty parody so outrageous that it deserves a spot on SNL!

Don't know this director, who's also, according to the credits that I read through all the way because the song was so outrageous,  the writer and sound designer. I don't know him, but today, I heart him. Out loud. Thank you, Ben Dickinson, whoever the heck you are, you rocked me and shocked me and reminded me of how much fun putting high art back into indie horror can be for us, the jaded and the zombi and vampire fatigued.",1418169600,,4429,5.005442176870749
3918662,1,B002EOVX92,"Whoever wrote the good reviews must be related to the film's production.

3918664,2,B002EOVX92,"It's for the visually engaged viewer. There are many great uses of sound, lighting and digital effects to create a simmering undercurrent of dread. Do these things make up for a painfully slow, unresolved movie? Only an individual viewer can weigh these things. So that's my warning: The movie will only be interesting to those who allow cinematography, technique, atmosphere and style to make up for shortcomings in plot, action, character development or forward momentum. Much has been said about the finale: a psychedelic, horror freakout. This is a great segment and really ends the movie on a spooky, visceral high note. But is it really worth the ""price of admission?"" Does this 25 minutes make-up for the previous slow moving hour? Does it elevate the movie from 2 stars to 3?

8367946,3,B002EOVX92,"I have to say, this is one of the most challenging reviews I've had to tackle. I've put it off for a time, to give this film a real chance, and to ensure I'd wrapped my head around it as much as possible. That said, I have to disagree with most reviews, in that I don't think this is a movie you either love or hate - I'm, frankly, somewhere in the middle, for better or worse.

First, let's knock out the easy part: it's currently free on Amazon Prime, so (provided you're a Prime customer) you're not going to lose a penny taking a chance on this one - had I paid for it, I might be more included to review this more harshly...maybe. Yes, it's that difficult to assess as a film. But, let's set aside the price of admission and just get to the film... here we go...

I have to say, had I not been ""warned"" that this was a ""horror"" film by the Amazon categorization, I could easily have passed through almost the entire experience not knowing it might fall into that category. Thriller... maybe. But, what this definitely is, is a psychological journey. This is where most reviewers drop off the radar as far as tolerating this film. It's a near-psychedelic art house style journey that, frankly, lost me many times along the way. Yet, I kept coming back to it, and have now seen it twice, all the way through.

In the end, I have to give the filmmakers credit for bringing something novel to the screen, as this is certainly not like any film I've seen (I can't quite call this a ""movie"", as the term doesn't feel right for this one). Also, the fact that it kept bringing me back obviously means it got my attention and kept it, ultimately.

For me, I did value the experience. I was able to tolerate the trippiness of it all, and it rarely (rarely, though not always) devolved into an unwatchable, ""off the rails"", nonsensical jump into the void. I did like this film more the second time around, as it felt just linear enough having experienced it once before. The last 1/5 of the film, though, did ultimately ruin the story and the storytelling and went into a world it didn't need to transcend into, and I think the dance/song sequence should have been left on the cutting room floor.

In the end, this film was a unique experience. Not horror, but a trippy psychological thriller that I think is indeed polarlizing, and I can definitely understand people hating it. For me, though, I'm glad I checked it out - though I ca;'t think of anyone I'd recommend it to.

So, if this review comes off as bizarre, annoying and/or hard to digest, you definitely want to skip it, because the film is very much like this review...

If you're a fan of David Lynch, you may really like it - but it definitely is not for everyone, and most horror fans won't dig it.

PS - Question: why does an apparently huge multinational corporation hire a three-man, slacker, hipster studio ad shop - on its first major project - to salvage what appears to be a major international environmental black eye - especially when the apparent leader of the advertising team seems completely mentally unstable, without letup, without a moment of mental stablity, throughout the whole period covered in the film? Unless the whole experience is some kind of dreamlike fantasy world that exists only in his deluded mind?",1428883200,2,3288,4.4958123953098825
8367947,5,B002EOVX92,"If I can get one person to watch this film, I feel that I shall have done the world some good, because it is a thing of such visual and intellectual beauty that it really deserves a cult following. This is still my favorite of Larry Fessenden's Scareflix series. For anybody who appreciates psychedelia at any level should enjoy it. While it deliberately incorporates elements of classic woodsy Slasher films, it's closest aesthetic relative that I've so far encountered is the seminally brilliant Beyond the Black Rainbow, but it also contains elements seen in films such as Kubrik's 2001, the Beatles' Yellow Submarine and Rob Zombie's Lords of Salem.",1428796800,,653,5.0
