448856,5,6302241693,"Gigan is the third best monster ever created!  Godzilla and Anguirus were the best, and this movie had all three of them!  Too bad they had to put Ghidrah in there to stink it up!  Though Ghidrah wasn't the only thing  wrong with this, it had no plot!  5 STARS FOR GIGAN!",959644800,,271,4.134615384615385
448857,3,6302241693,"This is perhaps one of the best of Toho's original series. Once again aliens are trying to conquer earth using Gigan and King Ghidorah as weapons. This draws Godzilla and Anguirus from Monster Island to protect  earth. When the four creatures meet, a great monster battle takes place.  Gigan is an impressive creation and the return of Ghidorah makes the movie  cooler. This movie has a fairly good plot with few boring parts and little  action. The monster scenes are definitely worth watching. It's pretty funny  how every time Gigan takes off into the air to attack, he gets hit with the  atomic ray. Seeing the monsters talk is weird, but cool. It show s  something of Godzilla and Anguirus's attitude towards eachother. Pretty  cool. Gigan returns in the next movie: GODZILLA VS MEGALON.",954115200,2,792,4.858208955223881
448858,4,6302241693,"There are some who say this is a horrible movie. I strongly disagree. Okay,so the story is a little dumb and the acting isn't the best,but it's not that bad. It has a great battle scene at the end and you  even hear Godzilla and Anguirus talk! I think people are way too critical of  this movie. It is also the last apperance of King Gidorah in the original  Godzilla series(films 1 through 15).Also,Gigan is a really cool monster! It  is also alot better than the next film,Godzilla vs. Megalon,which couldn't  even be saved by Gigan.",928540800,,535,4.53125

448897,5,6302241693,"Otaku John here to review a great Godzilla movie, a cult classic from the '70's.  Okay, to be clear here, I grew up watching these movies on Saturday afternoons on my local TV station, and being an Otaku who loves Anime, Manga, Light Novels, and everything Japanese, I naturally love Godzilla as well.  The special effects are hilarious, as is to be expected from a 70's Godzilla movie, with Kaiju monsters and miniaturized sets.  I much prefer these classic Godzillas with the kaiju suits and Godzilla with his ""googly-eyes"" versus the Godzilla films from the 90's-2000's that just don't have the same charm or appeal.  The DVD quality is fine, (hey, it's a grainy old 70's movie... what do you expect?) and the value is a bargain.  These are the kind of movies you can watch with your kids, and when they grow up, they can watch with their kids.  These classic Godzillas never get old.  If you love Godzilla, (and I don't mean that U.S.-made monstrosity from the late 90's with Broderick), then you've gotta get this one.  I also recommend ""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster""  another Gem from the same era.",1503532800,,1105,4.683937823834197

448936,4,6302241693,"BOTTOM LINE: One of Godzilla's more unique films. The incorporation of the manga themes is a cool twist. Use of lots of stock footage is only real downside. The flick introduces Gigan, a bizarre cyborg creation that has a look, sound and style all his own. One last word... if you don't like bugs this movie will probably gross you out. LOL! 4 STARS

THE STORY: Gang of greasy corporate creeps insisting they're all about ""world peace"" give our human heroes and Godzilla no end of trouble.

THOUGHTS: Overall spectacle is slighted somewhat by overuse of stock footage (and stock music cues from monster music maestro Akira Ifukube). Godzilla and his sometimes enemy/sometimes pal, Angilas, must team up to battle new outer space menace Gigan and arch-villain turned muscle-for-hire, King Ghidorah. There's lotsa blood during the monster fights too, which may bother younger G-fans, so be warned. The human protagonists are perhaps the most eclectic ever seen in a Godzilla film, which helps make this particular entry in the series a little more memorable. One of the few '70s films to NOT feature any screaming kids in short shorts in the cast. Thank goodness! :-)

THE BLU-RAY: This is another really nice-looking release from Kraken. They've done a great job bringing some of the best of Godzilla's golden age titles to home video in hi-def. Same holds true here. The video & audio both pop on this release. Crisp focus, solid color representation and clear, clean sound. A few decent bonus goodies help, and you can watch it in either original Japanese language version w/English subtitles or enjoy the hammy Hong Kong dub we grew up with watching this on TV re-runs during the 1970's. Plenty of monster fun, this excellent blu-ray home release of GODZILLA vs. GIGAN comes recommended.",1496534400,,1789,4.956666666666667

The transfer is good quality, there's none of those film marks or streaks like you sometimes get with older movies.  The sound was high quality as well.  This is just an all around solid blu-ray release, especially for a movie from the early '70's.  For the movie itself this was never one of my absolute favorite Godzilla movies, sort of mid level , but it was fun to watch from time to time, and not quite so cheesy as Godzilla vs. Megalon, though I could have done without Godzilla ""talking"".  And it did introduce one of my favorite Godzilla opponents, Gigan.  Spoilers, my favorite part was always near the end when the aliens are revealed to be cockroaches.  End Spoilers.  Overall I completely recommend getting the blu-ray version of this movie if you can, you really can't ask for a better way to watch it until they come up with another new viewing technology.  But then it took forever for us to get these older Godzilla movies in blu-ray, so the next big thing might take just as long, here's hoping it won't.",1481673600,,1096,4.551020408163265

449000,3,6302241693,"I have read that this is one of the worst Godzilla movies ever made. I can understand that viewpoint from having watched the English overdub version. I haven't been able to stay awake through the Japanese subtitled version yet. Other reviews have pointed out the whys of what makes this an abysmal Godzilla movie. I'll just say that it is certainly not the best of the series. However, I don't think it's quite the worst, either. Godzilla should certainly not ever speak... EVER. Gigan is an interesting monster though and that is the main reason I ordered this movie. I would have liked to have seen more background information on the monsters, especially Gigan.",1480896000,3,663,4.824561403508772

449006,5,6302241693,"Godzilla Vs. Gigan made in 1972 directed by Jun Fukuda is one of my favorite Godzilla/Kaiju films from all time.  Godzilla and Angorius battle King Ghidorah the three headed monster and the new Kaiju coming from deep space Gigan.  His weird hooked appendages give him a really creepy look.  Sure there are some parts in the movie that drive the true Godzilla fangirls and boys nuts especially in the dubbed version.  Godzilla and Angorius appear to have a conversation.  Now since when did this happen?  In the Japanese language version this doesn't really happen, but in the dubbed version they have a conversation which makes all of us old schoolers cringe.  That said, This is a must have for any Godzilla fan due to the utter coolness of Gigan.
Just as a rule of thumb, parents don't go out and buy these films for your 4 year old because you remember them from your childhood.  The dubbed versions have language in them and the subbed versions do as well.  So no don't buy this for your toddler, buy this because you LOVE GODZILLA!",1475625600,,1036,4.617486338797814

The action scenes are very good, at first Godzilla takes a licking, as does Anguirus, but good monsters can't be kept down for long.  The evil humans lose control of their creatures, and they and Gigan and King Ghidorah are defeated.  Probably not the best entry in the series, but still entertaining.

449234,5,6302241693,"Despite criticisms that the Japanese Godzilla films were always cheap, low-brow entertainment the Toho sci-fi films of the '50s and '60s were actually big productions of the time, and well directed (often by Ishiro Honda) and with smart scripts (a lot of the intentional humor is lost in the English dubbing). I mean, look at a movie like Mothra: a great, fable-esque story; great songs; hilarious at times; and visually spectacular. Compare it to any US sci-fi film of the same era!

... but things got more bare-bones as the years went on. The Japanese film industry was in a pinch by the '70s and Godzilla felt the brunt of it, bad. By this film we had simple scripts, mostly aimed at small kids; tons of stock footage to pad out monster scenes; and just a greatly reduced budget in all areas. These are the cheesy Godzilla films of legend... but, they're a whole lot of fun. As a matter of fact, of all the notoriously 'bad' Godzilla films this one might be the best. It has so much wrong with it but you just don't care. Goofy charm pervades the whole thing, from the comic book aesthetic (comics had experiences a huge boom at the time and this movie specifically tried to tap into it. Sadly, this print of the movie for international distribution lacks monsters speaking via word balloons as in the Japanese print), to the goofy band of human heroes who end up saving the world, and monsters who act specifically like a set of tag-team wrestling partners. What can I say? It works.

Watch with the tongue-in-cheek (and Australian accented) English language dub for extra comedy.

And watch for the Godzilla suit: this film was so cheap they couldn't afford building a new Godzilla suit so they used one already used in 3 previous films. By the end of the film Godzilla is literally tearing to pieces onscreen!",1408579200,5,1816,4.633540372670807

449263,5,6302241693,"I've wanted to see this movie since I was 6 years old, and just yesterday, a week after my 20th birthday, I did. I've been very insistent on buying these 50th-anniversary DVDs as opposed to those Kraken Release versions. There's no special difference other than the box and disc art, but there's no BGM playing on the 50th-anni DVDs and it allows someone who might be a bit drowsy to fall asleep and not worry about wasting energy.

That aside, seeing this after 14 years of wanting to was actually worthwhile. I'm sorry to say that it was not like Godzilla vs Megalon with the costumes used (I just discovered had its first use in GvM), music style, or overall amusement. I know it was also emphasized as the first tag-team Godzilla movie, to this day, but it's ultimately about average for a Godzilla movie. It's not AWESOME, but it's nowhere near lame.

There were a few camera shots played in succession during Godzilla vs Megalon that I thought for years would be in this movie, since there was a costume change and no other shots had blood in them. After 14 years of suspicion, I'm happy to say I was right! HUAHAHAHA!

Anyway, for anyone who has yet to see this movie or order it (or the newer version with the extremely lousy box art and worse disc art), you will wet yourself when you see the backside and the disc.",1406592000,,1324,4.462809917355372

Well, Gigan is the good part. In my opinion, his design is one of the best in the Godzilla catalog. The other monster suits look really rough and worn out though. Somewhere in the middle of this movie it just starts dragging on and the monster fight doesn't pay off as it's ridden with stock footage which keep shifting the battle from night to day and back. It even repeats clips from itself showing the same clip of Gigan flying and cutting Godzilla over and over. Also, Godzilla and Angurius talk.. but I'm okay with that.

I'm beginning to see why I lost interest in the franchise after Godzilla's Revenge. Godzilla VS Gigan is one of the low points in the series. Too many stock footage sequences and some shoddier than usual special effects are just some of the problems with this entry.

It's also sillier than usual (if that's possible?) with talking monsters and cockroaches from outer space. It doesn't matter if they used word balloons in the original Japanese version, it's just really stupid. Godzilla seems to have forgotten all about his radioactive breath again and now he can swim like a speed boat whizzing through the ocean with his pal Angiurus. It doesn't really matter it's a Godzilla movie right? I like the big guy and I can accept all the silliness, but watching stock footage from an earlier Godzilla  kind of takes the fun out of these films.

Okay, I don't expect much from these films, but the earlier ones seemed to have better production values and scripts. On the plus side, Gigan and Ghidorah make a pretty good tag team and when the rumble gets going it's pretty darn good.

The DVD from Sony has a decent transfer and it's in widescreen, it also has options for Japanese and English language and subtitles. No bonus stuff just some trailers.",1395187200,,1359,4.697478991596639

449348,3,6302241693,"When King Ghidorah and Gigan are summoned to Earth by sinister aliens who are posing as the creators of the new World Children's Land theme park, it will be up to a comic artist and his friends to sabotage their evil plot and aid Godzilla in defeating the marauding monsters! Jun Fukuda returns to direct another mindless monster romp in GODZILLA VS GIGAN, the twelfth entry in the series. After two experimental attempts that strayed from the standard formula, GODZILLA VS GIGAN returns to a more traditional plot line involving an alien invasion, which always proved popular in the earlier films. The one-dimensional characters and recycled story elements are bad enough as it is, but unfortunately the film also relies heavily on stock footage for the majority of the battle sequences. The mighty King Ghidorah makes another exciting appearance alongside the menacing cyborg Gigan, who is given a unique new design that is quite unlike any of the other monsters. Together, the two go on a destructive rampage through Tokyo using clips from GHIDORAH THE THREE-HEADED DRAGON to cut costs. What few miniature arenas were actually constructed for the showdown between Godzilla, Anguirus, Ghidorah, and Gigan do pay off in the explosive finale. Fans will note the considerable amount of bloodshed caused by Gigan's spinning blades, as well as the questionable moments where Godzilla and Anguirus are somehow given the ability to speak. Although it lacks any form of substance, GODZILLA VS GIGAN can be enjoyed simply for its excessive monster violence, especially while ignoring the alien subplot entirely.

449369,4,6302241693,"If you are a Godzilla afficianado, you'll enjoy this movie. If you watch all of the Godzilla movies from the first to the last, you'll see Godzilla change in appearance & attitude. From a destructive vengeful creature to rubber-suited ""friend of man"" who goes to battle with other ""unwordly"" creatures to save mankind. THIS Godzilla is a real fun romp that does not hide it's comedy aspects & the agreed upon scientific theory that cockroachs will withstand armageddon & be the only creatures left after mankind destroys the planet. Having Godzilla and Anguilus ""talking"" to each other is funny! I have all but 4 of the Godzilla movies on DVD & I'm going to complete my collection soon (I have all of the VHS movies but I'm switching to DVDs because they will last longer). Many people don't like how Godzilla ""morphs"" from terrible monster to ""nice guy"" humankind helper throughout his movies but I enjoy all of his movies (even the ""bad"" ones) because that's Godzilla's history!",1345334400,,980,4.839285714285714
449370,2,6302241693,"The two best things about ""Godzilla vs. Gigan"" is that it's better than ""Hedorah"" and it features one of the most interesting and menacing-looking foes in the entire Godzilla series. A bird-like cyborg with a buzz saw for a chest, sharp hooks for hands and a menacing red eye and metallic beak on the face, Gigan is the main reason why this movie is nowhere near as bad as ""Hedorah"" and ""Final Wars"".

The worst thing about ""Godzilla vs. Gigan""? Everything else. Here, it's the budget more than the creativity that ruins the movie. Simply put, everything looks cheap. King Ghidorah, who also appears in this movie, is such a shadow of its former self that it looks less like a terrifying dragon and more of a flea-bitten Halloween costume (In contrast, ""Gigan"" looks great). There's a scene after Godzilla destroys the Godzilla tower where the Big-G is taunting Gigan and you can clearly see the costume falling apart. And then there's the stock footage: scenes from ""Ghidorah"", ""Monster Zero"", ""Destroy All Monsters"", ""War of the Gargantuas"", ""Hedorah"", ""Rodan"", and ""Ebirah"" are used to show Gigan and Ghidorah's destruction of Tokyo and the military and the monster battles. Even the soundtrack is composed of stock footage: all Akira Ifukube scores from various Toho monster movies, from ""Mothra vs. Godzilla"" to ""Frankenstein Conquers the World"".

The sad thing about ""Gigan"" is that despite the blatant financial woes and some head-scratching moments like Godzilla and Anguirus talking to each other through thought bubbles (in the American version, they literally speak through distorted English), it actually has a very interesting plot and that it could have worked had it not been for the budget, boring human characters and sluggish pacing. The head of an amusement park hires a gifted comic book illustrator to create monsters for the museum. Suddenly, the illustrator is caught in a mystery involving a woman, her brother and the theme park's executives, who are revealed to be Spacehunter Nebula aliens in human disguise. An intriguing premise receives a shoddy execution due to factors beyond the filmmakers' control.

In addition, ""Gigan"" has a couple of things to recommend: besides the villainous title character, there's a scene where Godzilla is getting the daylights beat out of him but not just Gigan and Ghidorah but by the Godzilla tower that fires a devastating laser beam at him. Godzilla is so brutally beaten down that you actually feel bad for the guy. The monster battles, while ridiculous and ruined by the overuse of stock footage, is still pretty enjoyable to watch, particularly the part where Anguirus uses his spiny back to assault Ghidorah and Gigan. And while the use of stock music may seem annoying, in hindsight, it's actually a treat in disguise since it serves as a greatest-hits collection of many Ifukube scores not heard in America at the time, due to meddling American studio executives replacing some with their own stock music.

""Gigan"" is nowhere near as incompetently directed as ""Hedorah"" and ""Final Wars"" but it still ranks at the low totem pole of Godzilla movies due to blatant use of stock footage, undeveloped human characters, some blatantly poor special effects and unrealized plot. Unfortunately, things would get much worse for the Big-G in the next movie. But that's another review for another day.

They used the Godzilla cookie monster suit for this one.  Yes the monsters have anthropomorphic traits such as talking and teasing each other. Only get this if you want to complete a collection.

449373,3,6302241693,"After the Godzilla vs. Hedorah (1971) debacle, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka wanted no more surprises. He ordered long-time Toho director Jun Fukuda to make a more 'classic' Godzilla film, one that harkened back to the glory days of Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964) and Monster Zero (1965). Unfortunately, by 1972 there was little money and resources left for the studio to make such a film again. Budgetary constraints resulted in the cheapest solution imaginable - digging into Toho's library of good films to help disguise a bad one. Stock music from maestro Akira Ifukube, who had conducted many of the best scores for Toho, stood in for the film's soundtrack and is the best thing about this movie. Footage from no less than a dozen films from Toho's back catalog were utilized, with little regard to continuity during the battle scenes. These include Rodan, The Mysterians, The Last War, Godzilla vs. Mothra, Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster, Monster Zero, Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster, War of the Gargantuas , Son of Godzilla, Destroy All Monsters, Godzilla's Revenge, and finally Godzilla vs. Hedorah. More of a floss budget than a shoestring budget.

The plot is as juvenile as it gets, with a comic book artist and his girlfriend uncovering a plot by businessmen who run a children's theme park. It turns out that they're alien invaders scheming to take over the earth. About these aliens...they're insects wearing human skin.

So how does this new DVD compare to the original Sony release? As far as the video, it's neither better nor worse than the image quality of the Sony release, which was already pretty good. The flier design is an improvement in my opinion, being similar to Classic Media's cover designs, with the original Japanese poster and both the Japanese and American titles on the cover. The plot synopses are cool and good for a chuckle. As for extras, there is only the original Japanese trailer with subtitles. The Sony dvds didn't even have that. Music from the film plays over the menus, which is a step up.",1301270400,5,2043,4.936046511627907

It's a bit campy and the alians, and their plan, are silly, but it's still fun to watch now and then.  Good bargan for the collector.",1297641600,,419,4.097560975609756

Although it's uncut, re-mastered, and in Japanese, thank God, it is hopelessly devoid of any real special features. Any who, I'm here to elaborate on what is considered one of the worst G-films. I'll say right off the bat in my humble opinion you could do a lot worse, with the terribly unoriginal monsters of ""Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster"" or the atrocious Musuko Goji suit of ""Son of Godzilla"".

The battles in this movie are particularly entertaining, but once again it is deterred y awful amounts of pathetic stock footage. Alas, it is up to Gigan to save this aspect of the film, which I believe he does. Gigan draws blood from both Godzilla and Anguirus giving the fight a true sense of brutality that was just plain awesome! For this in itself, along with the good choice of Ifukube themes, I highly enjoy the film. While still a dip in Godzilla's career, this piece is an intriguing, sometimes unintentionally funny, and enjoyable film that I recommend to G-fans.",1295481600,,1091,4.623711340206185

When the cartoonist plays an audio tape stolen from the aliens, Godzilla and Angilas, on Monster Island, detect it and set out to discover the source. Meanwhile, the aliens summon King Ghidorah and a new monster, Gigan, from outer space to wreak havoc on Earth. Godzilla and Angilas are soon pitted in a grand, occasionally bloody battle with the two space monsters.

After the experimental Godzilla vs. Hedorah, Toho returned to the more familiar theme of space aliens invading Earth with Godzilla vs. Gigan (a.k.a. Godzilla on Monster Island). The result, however, is a mish-mosh of stock footage, canned Akira Ifukube music, and juvenile monster antics that fall far short of the fantastic daikaiju romps of the 1960s. If not for a few shining moments of monsters destroying civilization, the lackluster cast and foolish script would make this a totally forgettable entry in the Godzilla series.

Despite featuring one of Godzilla's coolest-looking foes, the movie carries silliness to its utmost extreme, the monster battles largely being pale imitations of those in such classics as Ghidrah, The Three-Headed Monster; Monster Zero; and Destroy All Monsters. Extensive use of stock footage ruins any number of the sequences, and many of the new special effects scenes fall laughably below the standard set by the series' earlier entries. Still, the high-quality, widescreen DVD presentation greatly enhances the cheesy fun factor, and the movie can be recommended for the sheer amount of monster action.",1265500800,7,1643,5.291187739463601
449378,3,6302241693,"So the basis of this film is that aliens once again want to take over the Earth, and this time, they plan on using Ghidorah and Gigan for their nefarious purposes.....oh, and they are also building a kick-ass amusement park with a Godzilla tower!! How the amusement park factors into the whole taking over the Earth thing doesn't make a lot of sense until you find out that the Godzilla tower has a very cool laser in it's mouth, one the could kill Godzilla...(you know..as long as Godzilla only stands in front of the tower and doesn't approach it from the side or rear???).

Yes, this is one of the goofier entries in the Godzilla series. The whole idea of aliens using monsters to take over the Earth had been done several times by Toho, and in more imaginitive ways. These aliens don't seem that bright, and the re-use of several action shots from previous films kind of shows that this thing was made on a shoe-string budget. To top it off, or heroes in this film are a comic book artist, his controlling wife...and a fat Japanese hippie!

Godzilla and Anguirus do have a scene or two where they ""talk"" to each other. I don't think it would have bothered me except that they basically say nothing! If you are going to go the route of having the monsters communicate, at least have them say more than ""big trouble up ahead"" and ""come on""...

For all of it's faults though, I give ""Godzilla vs. Gigan"" a pass, and say you should add it to your collection simply because of the introduction of Gigan. This is one viscous monster, with hooks for hands, one big stabbing talon on each foot, and a buzz-saw on his belly, he slices and dices his way through Godzilla and Anguirus during the epic final battle. King Ghidorah is always fun to watch, so any film featured the three headed dragon is worth a place on your shelf as well. While this may be aimed at a younger crowd, it's not a kiddie film in the way ""All Monsters Attack"" is, though kids will like it.

Director Jun Fukuda (who had previously helmed Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster and Son of Godzilla) was brought on board and stock music from previous Toho films (all by composer Akira Ifukube) was used for the soundtrack.

Godzilla vs. Gigan is bad, even by Showa era standards.  The shameless use of stock footage for a good portion of the kaiju battles, the use of stock music, the boring human characters, and the shoddy special effects (in one scene you can literally see the Godzilla costume coming apart) make it one of the worst in the series.

The scene where he & King Ghidorah battle Godzilla & Angilas at an oil refinery is a definite highlight, with plenty of spectacular explosions & monster mayhem to go around.

They include Godzilla's Revenge, Godzilla vs The Smog Monster (Hedora), and Godzilla vs Megalon. The last two entries Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla and Terror of MechaGodzilla were gallant but unsuccessful attempts to bring Godzilla back to his up to Destroy All Monsters glory. Pre-Destroy All Monsters for those who don't like that movie. As for Godzilla Vs Gigan, it falls into a category all it's own. It doesn't fit into the Revenge, Smog Monster, or Megalon idea. Nor can it be linked to the Vs Mecha or Terror Of, ones either. I think the film makers of this one were quite smart to include Ghidorah and Anguirus in this one as a backup, just in case Godzilla alone fighting a new monster was unappealing. For years all I had was a grainy picture, tinny sounding fullscreen recorded from TV VHS, which used to contribute to my low opinion of this movie.

However despite that, this movie is still really good. Its a tag team match Godzilla and Anguirus vs Gigan and King Ghidorah. Ghidorah was pretty stiff looking in this one. Gigan was a cool creation.
This DVD from Sony/Columbia is uncut with some gore included..one is really a shocker with Anguirus nose in Gigan's chest..and blood spurts
Godzilla & Anguirus talk for some reason, that was an awkward scene, & cheesy..

And as for his little sidekick, he was only a diversion.  He didn't do a single thing until the very end basically.  The first part of the fight was seemingly in slow motion and you couldn't tell what the heck was going on.

As I've said before about Zilla flicks is, you can't expect a good movie when watching this, but at least you can have a lot of fun watching it.  For example, the acting was so bad in this, it was good.  There was some JAPANESE HIPPIE somehow tied into the story and most of the movie he is gnawing on some sort of phallic food.

449386,4,6302241693,"I am sick, so I decided to get a Big G movie. My friend and I love old cheesy movies, especially Godzillas. I got G vs Gigan and G: Final Wars (Which I am also righting a review about). G vs Gigan didn't disappoint me. I laughed and laughed over the cheesy fight scenes and the pathetic antics of the moronic Japenese actors. The aliens in this Godzilla are actually (of course) cockroaches from outer space! (Seriously. I kid you not.) I used the English dub for a short while but then simply opted for the Japanese voiceovers and English subtitles. The English dub was a collection of fifty year old voice actors. (Sad). But, now to what really matters: the monsters. There are four main ones in this movie, and a collection of small appearances. Godzilla (of course) is the hero, and then there's his sidekick, Anguiras. The little armodillo gets smacked around and beaten up, and is really no help. The villians are Gigan, a cyborg razor blade, and King Ghidorah. Gigan looks pretty cool, but King Ghidorah is done very poorly (I don't mind). At the beggining of the movie, Godzilla stomps out. I though he looked really pathetic until he roared. That trademark roar changed everything, and suddenly he was awesomeness itself. Anguirus is the best done monster. He looks pretty nice. There are several battle sequences, all cheesy the way I like it. In one scene where Gigan and King Ghidorah rampage through Tokyo (for the millioth time), Gigan actually stomps past a building with two dolls inside. Little Kelly Dolls with rosy cheeks! Little shrimps! Sad, but hilarious. So, all in all, you get what you expect. GET IT if you like Godzilla or cheesy B-flicks. DON'T GET IT if you dislike Godzilla, cheesy B-flicks, or girly Japanese 70s actors (and a talking Godzilla.) Good stuff, I say.",1173139200,2,1795,4.719745222929936

It's still good but not as good as most other G-films. Gigan is a decent opponent but there was a lot of stock footage. Seeing stock footage badly used in a movie is weird. Normally, movies don't have stock footage. Anyway, G fights Gigan a lot and King Ghidorah helps gigan at times. anguirus tries to help G but ends up getting beaten up through most of the fight scene. The monster/ttack fight scene, from where King Ghidorah and Gigan attack Tokyo onwards, is about 40 minutes long. It would have been better if the original footage were set during the day (because stock footage was set during the day). One thing that would have made this movie much better is if Rodan had been in it instead of Anguirus.",1144108800,,859,4.36875

449464,3,6302241693,"Any long running series has its ups and downs, and in a series as long-running as Godzilla those downs can be pretty low.  This one isn't bottom of the barrel, but you can definitely see it from there.

""Godzilla vs. Gigan"" (""Chiky kogeki meirei: Gojira tai Gaigan"" or ""Earth Assault Order: Godzilla vs. Gigan "") is the 12th film in the Showa series, at a time when Godzilla had turned from a rampaging beast of fear and destruction into a kid-friendly beastie cheered by the citizens of Japan.  Due to the hard times of the 70's Japanese film, the budget is tiny, and there is a heavy reliance on stock footage taken from previous Godzilla films.

The plot is somewhat oddball, with developers attempting to build Godzilla-land, a theme park built around Godzilla.  Of course, the developers are secretly cockroach-aliens, and when a hippie and a failed cartoonist get wind of their plan, quickly summon the terrors of King Ghidra and Gigan to Earth to help in their nefarious plan.  Godzilla and his stocky pal Angirasu are on hand to stop them.

Of course, the worst and most bizarre aspect of ""Godzilla vs. Gigan"" is the chatty Godzilla, as he and Angirasu exchange a few well-timed quips.  This isn't so bad in the original Japanese, where the audio is growling sounds and the dialog appears as word-balloons, but in the English dub there is an actual Godzilla voice.  A horrible decision on someones part.

However, unforgivable cheesyness aside,  Gigan is a decent foe for the Big G, with his buzz-saw belly and sharp claws.  He and King Ghidra make a nice tag-team pair, easily trouncing Godzilla and Angirasu to within an inch of their lives.  Godzilla isn't quite so mighty here, and he seems to have forgotten how to breath his atomic fire, until the last possible moment.

While more kid-friendly, the series gets bloodier with this picture, as Godzilla starts spouting red, and gives some back to Gigan and King Ghidra.  King Ghidra takes some nasty neck damage as well.

People attracted to the sillier aspects of Godzilla will love ""Godzilla vs. Gigan.""  Those who like at least a little menace with their monster should probably give this one a miss.",1121126400,30,2166,4.779569892473118
449465,3,6302241693,"The 1970's were for the most part a bad time for movies. Economic troubles amongst other such woes seemed to plague the entire world.

And the cinema had it no better. Again, for the most part.

See, for every Raging Bull, Taxi Driver and Star Wars, there always seemed to be a Giant Spider Invasion or Food of the Gods to make the average moviegoer queasy. Add the increasing popularity of television to the mix and well, you get the idea.

Seemed Godzilla was one of the lucky ones.

Well, yes and no. See, Godzilla managed to continue to be a mainstay in the theaters, but in order to do that, he would have to do an embarrasing amount of things most of us hardcore fans would soon like to forget. Like...

A. Use his breath to propel himself in the air.

B. Play second fiddle to Jet Jaguar in the following film Godzilla vs. Megalon.

C. Do a flying missile dropkick in said Megalon.

and...

D. Go from a walking doomsday device to lovable children's hero.

Which leads us to this film. See, having to weigh their budgetary options, Toho Co. Ltd, along with director Jun Fukuda, director of 5 Godzilla films, opted to use stock footage from previous Godzilla films like Monster Zero (which in itself used footage from Rodan (1957), also in this film), Ghidrah, the Three Headed Monster, Destroy all Monsters and Son of Godzilla, as well as other Toho outlets like Frankenstein Conquers the World. The idea was by using this footage Toho could save money in visual effects. This decision was and still is not appreciated by fans (me, I liked it, considering that at least most of the footage was from good films), blaming Jun Fukuda for ruining the Godzilla legacy.

But it wasn't all his fault. In the days where there was no money, screenplays were written in a day and moviemaking was basicly a rushed, incoherent job, even Fukuda today fells like watching these films are like ""opening old wounds.""

In either event, most of this footage was used again in Godzilla vs. Megalon, but I would reccomend watching this film at least once to get a glimpse of that infamous time in moviemaking.

The plot is recycled alien invasion with an anti pollution moral but the real reason you watch Godzilla vs Gigan is for the fight between monsters and this one is pretty good.

I respectfully must disagree.  In the huge (kidding) controversy over the all time worst G flick, this is my pick.  Bad, bad, falling apart G costume. Terrible direction and cinematography - looks more like one of those chinese kung fu flicks from a production value stand point.  Ifukube's the best, but even that's tired in this film for some reason.  Is it that the score outclasses the movie too much despite being stock?

The monsters ""converse"" ugggh! Throws sneaker at TV.  Wait, look, there's Mobil Oil blowing up again!  That goes back 10 years. Why did they use Mobil Oil over and over instead of something a little less conspicious?

I remember when this came on UHF TV as a kid.  Kewl! A never before seen, brand spankin' new, G-flick.  Huh?  What's this crap? I think I actually started channel surfing.  Never did that before.  Not even during Godzilla's revenge.  This one doesn't improve with age.  It's a shame Gigan's a pretty kewl monster.  Might have been a good adversary in the 60's when they gave the filmmakers a fighting chance via a reasonable budget.",1094083200,3,1230,4.721698113207547
449484,4,6302241693,"This is either one of the best godzilla movies, or one of the worst. It just depends on the way you look at it. The plot is surprisingly good for a 70's Godzilla movie. The only problem is that it has several of those ""70's moments"", the most prominant of which is the scene with the talking monsters (a scene so dumb, it puts megalon to shame). Scenes like that just make you want to take out the good ol' propane tank and down it. But if you overlook those parts, and just sit back, relax, and enjoy the cool monster action, Godzilla vs. Gigan is one of the most exciting, dramatic movies to date. However, the toxic cheese brought it down from the five stars I woud've given it if those parts were cut out. Oh, well, no  movie's perfect.

UPDATE: Forget what I said about the ""talking monsters"". The voices have been edited out for this DVD!!!",1093219200,5,846,4.314465408805032
449485,4,6302241693,"Back when I was younger, whenever I saw some Oriental people speaking in badly-dubbed English, odds were it was a Godzilla movie or a kung-fu movie.  If it was the former, I was in luck.  Well, Godzilla vs. Gigan was one of the first movies I saw that introduced me to the world of Toho Studio's monsters.
OK, the story.  Genko is a cartoonist trying to find a job with the aid of his female agent.  He finally finds something at the Construction Committee for the Children Fund, a non-profit org. dedicated to peace who are making an amusement park and even conducts operations from a Godzilla tower.  Genko is kind of creative in his monsters, but a description that he is ""stupid but at the same time cunning"" is kind of apropos.
That assessment comes from Fumio Sudo, the very young chairman of the Children Fund who does coordinate geometry for kicks.  His underling and Genko's immediate superior, a bespectacled reptilian-looking guy with thin mustache named Kubota.  Things take an interesting twist when Genko acquires a tape whose loss causes great consternation to the chairman and Kubota.  He then falls in with Machiko and Shosaku, who are a motley pair.  Machiko's a hottie nice in a fetching mini while Shosaku, with his long hair and headband, is a friendly but goofy-looking guy still wearing 60's fashion clothes.  Machiko's brother was working at the fund but has vanished.  How's this for a twist?  Our heroes learn that Kubota and Genko were killed in an accident a year ago!
This is at least the fourth time Ghidrah (King Ghidorah), the three-headed golden dragon, has been the heavy, and I wonder if he's gotten tired of getting pounded by Big G.  As for the gold and dark green Gigan, he is well-realized, with that buzzsaw belly of his doing quite some physical harm to Big G--see the blood gush from his arm at one point.  His appearance is reason enough to see this movie and yes, he is as destructive as Ghidrah.  He's clearly based after an eagle, with the shape of his head and beak, and three wings.  And I wonder when Toho Studios caught on that Angillus is one of the most useless monsters to have on your side.  I mean, he's like a spiky, long-snouted armadillo with no special skills, lasers,... agh!
A few other things:  Genko's monsters.  The name Shukra, the monster of homework, is a corruption of shikudai, which is the Japanese word for homework.  As for Mamagon, the monster of strict mothers, there is a humorous moment, as the drawing has a stark resemblance to someone else in the movie.  The intro after the titles are done show frames of Genko's animation, and also serves to remind the viewer that these movies are the cinematic equivalent of comic books, which kinda fits.  Also, Godzilla actually talks in this movie, which is unintentionally hilarious.  Finally, this was originally called Godzilla on Monster Island, which is ridiculous, since the action takes place in Japan.  This new title is more apropos.
Godzilla movies relied on some unexplained mystery, with two or three people caught up in some intrigue, and then Godzilla would appear, with or without one of his buddies, and fight the villainous monster.  This entry follows that formula, and the initial three-in-a-team motif.  And yes, there are the usual toy tanks and planes being destroyed by the bad monsters.  If one takes these movies within the context of the Godzilla canon, cool, as the good guys here are goofy but fun to watch, although this is a notch below Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla.  3.5, rounded to 4.",1068940800,4,3533,4.7569786535303775
449486,3,6302241693,"This movie could have been one of the better Godzilla movies. The plot, though well used, is good enough. Aliens (intelligent cockroaches) use Gigan and the great King Ghidra in an attempt to take over earth. The monster battle is top notch. The thing that keeps this movie from a 4 or perhaps 5 star rating is Godzilla talking. I expect, in fact relish the cheese in Godzilla movies but this was too much. Im not sure if it was Japanese or the English dubbing but whoever was responsible, it is a shame because as i said, it could have and should have been a good chapter in the ongoing saga of Godzilla.",1062201600,2,605,4.3628318584070795
449507,4,6302241693,"I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Godzilla movies. As a kid, there was nothing I enjoyed more than sitting home on a Saturday afternoon and watching the big Green guy take on some giant monster in the streets of Japan. I never really picked up on the fact that the monsters were just people in rubber suits, that the actors were dubbed, or that the movies were considered ""cheesy"" by many fans' standards. I didn't pick up on these things because I really didn't care. To me, these were the greatest movies on the planet and even the greatest most well thought-up scrutiny would not change my mind.
That being said, ""Godzilla Vs. Gigan"" or ""Godzilla On Monster Island"" as it is known as when aired on TV, was a big favorite. Not as good as the all-out battle royal that was ""Destroy All Monsters"" but still a tremendous film. Sure, the characters are Japanesse hippies and evil cockroaches disguised as humans in an attempt to take over the world but what the hell are you expectng? IT'S GODZILLA! In hindsight, the talking monsters were a bit much but even now, almost twenty years since I first saw it, I still could pop it in my VCR and enjoy it.
This time around, Godzilla and the giant spiny Aguilas are out to stop a giant robot bird called Gigan and Big G's always infamous rival, King Ghidorah, the three-headed space dragon that shoots out lightning. Some of the monster battle scenes are recycled from ""Ghidrah"" and ""Destroy All Monsters"" but what it takes, it also gives back as ""Godzilla Vs. Megalon"" does some borrowing of its own from this film.
Godzilla movies are great because they are good, brainless fun. Anyone can enjoy them. Common sense would dictate that anyone looking for a real serious motion picture is not gonna wanna pick up an old Japanesse monster movie from the 60's and if you were expecting such then shame on you. This will more than likely appeal to the same people who enjoy the old WWF wrestling matches from the 80's. So those in the mood for something a little silly, dim them lights and throw on a little ""Godzilla Vs. Gigan"". I insist.",1060732800,2,2091,4.519788918205805

449510,3,6302241693,"Godzilla talks in this movie.  I don't know who came up with this idea or why, nor do I know why his voice is made to sound like a Billy Crystal impersonation of an old Jewish man.  Thankfully, Godzilla is a monster of few words; he and Anguiras speak only a couple of times in the movie.  As for the plot, it is your typical inane Godzilla story--aliens have begun building a Children's Land Amusement Park, centered around a giant Godzilla replica; claiming to be seeking world peace, they are actually plotting to take over the earth.  An out-of-work cartoonist, whose comics feature such horrible monsters as the Monster of Homework and the Monster of Overbearing Mothers, manages to stumble across the group's evil plans.  Working with such allies as a black belt lady not immune to fainting and a Japanese Jerry Garcia lookalike, he sets about foiling the plans of the bad guys.  The aliens send for King Ghidorah and Gigan from their home world in the Hunter Nebula.  The alien monsters begin laying waste to Tokyo, but finally Godzilla and his sidekick Anguiras arrive to fight.  Godzilla had apparently become lazy and neglected his normal training regimen because he is far from all-powerful when the melee begins.  Not only is he abused by Ghidorah and Gigan, but he walks right into an alien trap.  Anguiras, who really has little offensive capabilities, gives a gritty performance, even taking on King Ghidorah monster-a-monster at one point.  At points in this battle, though, it is anyone's fight.
The special effects here are not that special, but that's okay with me.  Many of the scenes of destruction make obvious use of model cars, buildings, tanks with toy soldiers, etc..  Godzilla' costume does indeed look pretty ragged, barely holding up through the end of the fight.  Gigan does not impress me that much; the  tusk-like hands are okay, but the rotating circular saw in his chest seems sort of weird.  King Ghidorah, my favorite Godzilla foe, looks horrible in this movie.  His three heads each look like they have reached middle age, and his whole appearance seemed rather drab.  Most disappointingly, he is totally static (with unmoving heads) when he is shown flying in outer space.
A lot of people seem to prefer this film to its successor, Godzilla vs Megalon, but give me Megalon over Gigan any day.  For me, besides the utter ridiculousness of making Godzilla and Anguiras talk, this movie represents Godzilla's worst fight performance and most bedraggled appearance.  It's not the worst Godzilla movie, but it is far from the best.",1018656000,22,2564,4.891203703703703
