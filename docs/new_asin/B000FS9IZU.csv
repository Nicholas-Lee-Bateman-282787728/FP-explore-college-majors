The seller made it look like the DVD was new but looking closer the packaging is not new and the inside is all scratched including the DVD. We couldn't get past chapter 19. I bought this is July as a birthday gift and attempted to watch it for the first time today. It was in a dry place with other DVDs so I don't think it was ruined after, especially looking at the scratches I know for sure it was already damaged. I am not talking about one scene or two, the whole half part of the movie doesn't work. Will I be refunded or will the seller send me a new one?",1409529600,2,681,4.044444444444444
8125953,4,B000FS9IZU,"This is a very fine 1975 adaptation of RK Narayan's great novel The Guide. In the frame tale, a con man (nicely and naturalistically played by the superstar Dev Anand), just released from prison, seeks a new life, and ends up being mistaken for a holy man when he's found sleeping in an abandoned temple. In the central part we see how he ended up in jail because of his relationship with a gifted dancer named Rosie. If you're not accustomed to Bollywood films, you'll find this about an hour too long, but you can ff through some of the middle parts. There are quite a few musical numbers, more interwoven with the story than the usual Bwood movie, because Rosie is a dancer and these depict the course of her career, so some classical styles can be seen as well as much ""fillum"" Seventies-style OTTness. Mostly this movie struck me as unusually realistic in style, more modern in its look than any Bollywood films of the Seventies, and this was probably because a real attempt was being made to do justice to the original novel. Is it Bollywood, therefore, or not? Certainly it isn't an ""art film"" of the Bengali school; all the people who made it were in the Bollywood industry. Probably it wasn't appreciated by the average Bwood audience because it had ""art film"" elements (realism etc.) while the Western audience wouldn't have tolerated the Bwood conventions (length, musical numbers etc.). Maybe now it can be appreciated; it was ahead of its time when released. Also, a horrible English version was released; avoid that. This Shemaroo Hindi version is said to be the best one. There is wonderful music by the master composer, Burman, and some of the best singers of the day; great scenery and everyday mise en scene; fine performances. A classic that, if you're interested in India or a Bollywood fan, you'll want to see.",1236211200,13,1831,4.707165109034268
