2677754,5,B000JMK90K,"I have been looking for this movie for years. I had it on VCR tape and someone lifted it. It's a movie for everyone. No matter what country you're form there's always mischief at boarding school. There's a word used in the movie by the boys, that influenced my boyfriend to use it as his email address.",1238716800,4,302,4.315789473684211

2677775,2,B000JMK90K,"Oh Captain, my Captain.  But only if the dead poets were hungry, lacked the brilliant Mr. Williams, and were trapped in a movie which could only be described as plodding, slow, with zero character development.  Actually, that only means the similarities are a boys boarding school with a secret midnight society.  It's plodding and slow because there's so very little plot that much stretching is required.  Oddly, they didn't fill in the plot gaps with explanation of anyone's motivation, and therefore, you don't care about any of them.  Maybe, possibly, a half-hour after school program, and maybe, possibly, if it had been aired about 10 years before it were filmed.  I could see a third grader me in about 1983 enjoying this.",1462060800,,730,4.942622950819672
2677776,5,B000JMK90K,"A lovely, funny movie that is poignant and fun for family viewing. My ten year old daughter enjoyed it, and has asked to watch it again more than once.",1447632000,,151,4.241379310344827

8152211,5,B000JMK90K,"I could not help but to love this movie.  We've shared it with lots of guests and visitors usually after dinner on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Everyone loves it.  How brilliant for families and children to see a charming British movie about a young boy in a boarding school that channels being bullied for not being good at sports into forming a gang of nerds that become a secretive cooking cult that meets at midnight in the school's cafeteria kitchen.  Beautiful countryside, filming and scenery too.",1478131200,,501,4.790697674418604

8152213,3,B000JMK90K,"A Feast at Midnight has all of the basic ingredients for a 5-star rating the easy way: a bunch of mischievous boys at a boarding school, a good-hearted but incompetent headmaster, a tyrannical supervisor. And yet, unlike the dishes a bunch of kids made, the movie never gelled properly. As a group (though with considerable variation) the kids' acting abilities were at best mediocre. (At that young age, the director is clearly to blame for this failure.) And the script, despite certain contrived events, never generated sufficient sparkle. To put it differently, the film was not that funny. Nor did it kindle feelings such as deep sadness, sympathy, etc. In short, this movie failed. 2 1/2 stars",1477008000,,699,4.982905982905983
8152214,2,B000JMK90K,"I really WANTED to like this movie.  Sort of a cross between Julie & Julia and Dead Poet's Society.  Gove, a bullied boarding student with the singular talent of cooking well and an ability to muster other unpopular boys, sneaks into the school kitchen to cook up sweets.  An interesting premise that, to me, never felt like it rounded out well.  I was looking forward to an uplifting story about the underdog who prevails and succeeds.  With few exceptions, the characters seemed rather flat, the plot ho-hum, and the denouement disappointing.  The humorous scenes weren't all that funny, the potential for pathos glossed over.  Oh well!",1466640000,,638,4.962264150943396

8152218,5,B000JMK90K,"Absolutely terrible cover art ...not sure where they got it - almost makes it seem like it will be animated (it's not). Anyways, there are a few linguistic hurdles for any non-Britons, but an otherwise great family film, destined to make you hungry and appreciate good food and friends.",1465603200,2,286,4.857142857142857
