8250620,2,B0013FCWKC,"I currently own 4 Eastwood guitars: a Sidejack DLX, a Classic 6, an Airline Tuxedo, and an Airline 2P DLX. Eastwood's vision of retro hip coupled with improved quality across a lavish product array is cooler than cool. But to go even further and keep these guitars affordable... Well, players who ""get it"" are ecstatic, and Eastwood seems to be thriving in their niche market.

So with this DVD, I was hoping for an inside look at Eastwood's design and manufacturing processes -- how they select their models and work with different suppliers and factories to (re)produce them. I wanted to know more about the quirky vintage guitars that inspired them, perhaps even a comparison of new Eastwood models alongside the relics they emulate. I was curious about company history -- how they were initially financed, what obstacles they overcame, what the market reception was, how their distribution grew, and where they are today. At a minimum (especially considering this is really a promotional video), I expected an overview of their product line and some hints about where the company is headed.

Unfortunately, this DVD contains little to none of this.

Instead, the disc opens with Eastwood's president, Mike Robinson, having an informal discussion with musician, Joey Leone. They spend 12 minutes basically telling us what we already know: Imported guitars from the 1960s looked really cool, but didn't play well or sound good. Leone briefly demonstrates Eastwood's Airline H44 DLX, based on a 1950s Stratotone. Robinson displays (without closeups) a 1961 Eko 700 4v and mentions it was manufactured in an accordion factory using accordion parts and vinyl covering. Unfortunately, that brief moment of insight is the coolest part of this DVD, and that single vintage guitar is the ONLY actual example we see of Eastwood's inspiration. The obvious question (Does Eastwood offer a comparable model?) is conspicuously avoided.

Imagine how compelling this COULD have been if they had detailed the myriad shortcomings of such a relic (bowed necks, impossible actions, shoddy tuners, horrific pickups, unshielded wiring, etc.), then contrasted that with how Eastwood corrected all these issues with a brand new model that captures the same vibe! Truly, a missed opportunity.

Next, they take a puzzling few minutes to disassemble a cheap generic Strat copy -- NOT an Eastwood model -- to show what basic pickups and wiring looks like from the back. Curiously, this is the only guitar we ever see the inside of, and the commentary is notable only for its lack of information. (If you know that necks have truss rods, and pickups are magnetic and their sound is affected by where they are placed on the guitar, then you won't learn anything new here.)

Finally, the eye candy we've been waiting for as Robinson starts presenting the Eastwood line! But amid a vista of numerous cool guitars arranged for display, he picks up only the first 4 of these and discusses each for just a few seconds. These are the Saturn 63, Wandre DLX, Nashville 12, and Delta-6. A few jerky closeups fail to convey much, and the entire tour concludes within 2 minutes.

That's all there is for the informational segment (with nary a mention of the prototype Airline amps depicted on the cover). The remaining 7 minutes of the first chapter is Leone performing; and to fill out the disc, the second chapter adds an additional 25 minutes of Leone performing. Yes, he's playing Eastwood products, but this is a showcase for him more than the instruments.

If this seems like an odd approach to documenting an emerging guitar company, it may shed some light to know the content of this DVD (which incidentally is a DVD-R) was originally a myrareguitars webcast from November of 2006. In fact, most of the performance content can still be viewed there. So this DVD might be mildly interesting as free swag (or to Joey Leone fans). But at a list price of $24.98, or current Amazon price of $18.93, you may want to reconsider if you want to see or learn anything about Eastwood Guitars.",1369958400,,4052,4.948529411764706
