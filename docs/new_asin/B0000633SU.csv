1687072,5,B0000633SU,"I live in Akumal, Mexico where the IMAX team stayed while they filmed the wet cave portion at the Dos Ojos (Two Eyes) cenote and cave system.  ""Journey Into Amazing Caves"" is a truly amazing journey into depths and places seen by only a very few people, and the IMAX perspective is absolutely awesome and surreal.  Just the idea of taking the IMAX camera into these locations is mind boggling.  Dos Ojos gets the most time in the film, and this cave system is most accessible for people, albeit certified cave divers.  Enjoy it in the comfort of your home.",1018915200,,556,4.53
1687073,5,B0000633SU,"I saw this movie in DC last May and I totally loved it.  After the movie, I bought the books and CD.  The next weekend I went caving with my grotto.  This movie certainly sends a very positive and educational message to people about knowing caves better and further how to protect them.  I highly recommend it to everyone.",1017878400,2,322,4.406779661016949
1687074,5,B0000633SU,"This movie seen in the Omni Theater (at the Science Center) was absolutely breathtaking, and interesting!  I watched it twice,  once with a large group of Brownie Girl Scouts!  We haven't stopped talking about it since.

The soundtrack is fantastic... we've already purchased that!

2008 ** I just had to add that we DID finally get to buy the DVD a few years ago and literally EVERYONE we know has watched it... we actually had company come for the sole purpose of watching the Cave movie... the music is just fantastic and we have continued to watch it from time to time over the past several years; my children have brought it to school for their science classes to view (from 3rd to 7th grades so far.)  It is still one of my all-time favorites.  As you would expect, the videography is amazing, especially since we got the big-screen tv, and it is stunning to think that there are people doing this ""somewhere out there"" while we just live our everyday lives.",1016409600,4,964,4.569767441860465
1687105,3,B0000633SU,"There was clearly a lot of time and money put into filming this, and it really shows in the great shots.  Ice caves in Greenland -- wow!  Yucatan cave diving -- incredible!  But the narration is pretty much grade school level.  You won't learn a whole lot except that caves may provide materials for new medecines, a point that is repeated over and over and over without any elaboration.",1264896000,,387,4.565217391304348
1687106,5,B0000633SU,"These DVD's are wonderful. The blue ray high definition is incredible. I sometimes pull my chair right up in front of the tv and it looks even better. I just bought some others on state parks (Yosemite, etc.) Videos like these don't get any better. I recommend these to everyone interested in our national treasures.",1264550400,,316,4.763636363636364
1687107,1,B0000633SU,"WOW! What a HUGE disappointment. I ordered this for a Christmas gift for my husband who is a caver and this movie was NOTHING about AMAZING CAVES!  It was more suitable for my five year old son than my husband and it was quite possibly the biggest waste of time and money.  We actually could not even make it through the movie and turned it off!  The fact that I am even writing this review must say how dissatisfied I was, because I never write reviews!",1261440000,5,454,4.255813953488372
1687108,2,B0000633SU,"Some of the scene's were amazing, like the ice cave scene. The movie followed two girls doing research. I wanted more caves, and exploring them. This was pretty lame. The 2nd graders, made me think I was watching the magic school bus. If they would have shown more ""AMAZING"" caves then it would have been better.",1254614400,6,312,4.589285714285714
1687109,3,B0000633SU,"most of this movie was a search for extremophiles
there were more flyby mountain scenes, kayaking scenes, scenes of second graders than actual scenes of caves
the cave diving segment was pretty cool; thats why i gave it 3 stars not 2
if want to see something with lots of insides of caves this is not for you",1246233600,9,308,4.327586206896552
1687110,3,B0000633SU,"This is first and foremost a journey about two scientists looking for extremophiles.  It just happens that where they are searching is in caves.  The caves are spectacular, but since the focus is on the scientist you are left wanting more.

I was also disappointed in that it really wasn't narrated by Liam Neeson.  He introduced the movie, but the majority was the scientist explaining what they were doing.  When I read that the movie was ""narrated"" I was expecting something more along the lines of how David Attinborough narrates Planet Earth.

If you are looking for something more along the Planet Earth or the Scenic National Park Series, you may want to think twice about buying this DVD.  This video was okay, but I don't know how many times I will re-watch this so I don't think I received full value for my money.",1245024000,18,824,4.641379310344828
1687111,5,B0000633SU,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The camera work is stunning, there's a little bit of new info even for someone who keeps up with science news, the narrator's voice was very pleasant, the music good and (a personal favorite as a woman) it's focused on two women scientists. I'll enjoy watching it many times, even after the informational value is long gone.",1240704000,,356,4.758064516129032
1687112,3,B0000633SU,The video is MUCH better without sound as the first 4 minutes was full enough of humanistic and evolutionary rhetoric that I found it much more enjoyable without the sound.,1240272000,,172,4.766666666666667
1687113,4,B0000633SU,"This documentary on caves is fully refreshing, the cinematography is excellent and hearing instrumental renditions of the Moody Blues while watching these cavers do their thing was a great fit (then again the Moody Blues is a favorite group of mine though).  I think this film is great for kids and adults.  My only issue with it is that it is way too short, but still a breath of fresh air and likely worth owning.",1233964800,,415,4.52
1687114,5,B0000633SU,"My Brownie troop saw this video at a gem and mineral show.  There was tons of fascinating stuff at the show and the video was 40 minutes long, but I just could not tear them away.  First through third graders sat and watched the whole thing absolutely enthralled.  The objective of playing the video at the gem and mineral show was to interest people in spelunking.  Mission accomplished!  And how perfect for a troop of Brownies that it was women featured in the movie.  I plan to check this movie out of the library so my daughters can watch it again.",1176595200,,553,4.425742574257426
1687145,2,B0000633SU,"Two stars, because:

- The music by The Moody Blues is intrusive. It's everywhere, all the time, telling you how to feel and what to think. It's like watching the movie with someone who won't shut up. I tried finding an additional soundtrack without the music, or maybe with the music toned down a bit, but no such luck. If I'm ever going to see this film again, it'll have to be with the volume off.

- One of the climbers is incessantly repeating that they're doing this because it might lead to the cure for some disease. Just in case we thought they were crazy adventurers and not scientists. You even get the obligatory shot of a scientist doing scientific things inside a laboratory. I want CAVES! I don't care why they do it, I won't judge...

- There aren't nearly enough caves.",1092787200,41,786,4.444444444444445
1687146,3,B0000633SU,"This is a well-produced DVD and the imagery is very high resolution. Contrast and color are very good. Liam Neeson is an outstanding narrator. Most of the imagery of the movie is great. Very dramatic panoramas, especially the helicopter fly-throughs. You will enjoy watching the movie once.
Unfortunately, the reason I don't rate it more than 3 stars is Amazing Caves suffers the common IMAX shortcoming that it has been produced as an all ages, all audiences film ... with a juvenile story, written at the 4th grade level. Too much of this brief 40 minute movie is wasted tending to the silly plot.
One can sit through it once and enjoy it, certainly if you have kids with you, and at a real IMAX theater. Your kids might enjoy watching it more than once, especially younger daughters since the two main characters are women scientists/adventurers. But with kids being so smart and worldly these days, even 6th graders would tire of the simplistic story and narration.
Why can't there be IMAX movies with appeal at a more intelligent level? Everest is a good example of an IMAX movie which does succeed in appealing to all audiences, but isn't written at a juvenile level.
The great caving and nature imagery in Amazing Caves is very frequently interrupted so they can keep tending to their story line of two women on their caving exploration and adventure, always ""getting in contact"" via a hoaky-looking simulated web video multimedia laptop screen with a small class of kids somewhere. Of course it is simulated and plain silly. There is no live contact with anyone. Probably filmed months apart. Yet they keep returning to this .... story, at least 10 times during the movie. Very annoying. Maybe it will appeal to young kids ...
Since IMAX movies are so short anyway, why don't they produce an alternate-cut of IMAX movies so that when 6 months later they release it on DVD, they can include the theatrical, all-ages juvenile story film, and a more intelligent, less pandering version with more interesting and meaningful narration, and cutting out the 30% of the film wasted on hoaky story devices and replacing it with more excellent, dramatic imagery. I know this means extra work, but it would likely result in more DVD sales. Maybe they could even show both versions (Kids, Grown-Ups) at the theaters.
I have a large-screen projection system (162"") with 10-channel surround. I have a large collection of IMAX movies. I am always looking for good, high-resolution nature, space and science movies. I just wish that more IMAX movies were actually worth watching multiple times, without having to suffer through juvenile stories, plot devices and elementary-school writing.
If you want to see the movie for its good imagery, just rent somewhere or it or buy it on Amazon. You can always sell it again in the Amazon Marketplace, just like I did.",1060473600,38,2852,4.87037037037037
1687147,3,B0000633SU,"The concept is great, but the film leaves you wanting for more.  First off, getting only 35 minutes of story seems somewhat of a shortcut for the money you spend on a DVD.  The subject matter is caves, and if you are interested in the strange beauty of these areas like I am, you are not satisfied with the film.  They spend more time on the human element and diversions such as the kayaking mentioned in an earlier review.  They needed to dedicated more time to showing the wonderful formations that could be found inside the caves.",1054598400,8,533,4.463917525773196
1687148,3,B0000633SU,"I normally like the McGillivray-Freeman IMAX films, but I have to say that this one is the worst I have seen from that company. The subject matter was not very interesting and most of the shots are either close-up or small area shots which make poor use of the IMAX format. The best sequence in the film was flying through parts of the Grand Canyon.  This film has none of the interest or drama such as the IMAX film Dolphins has, nor did it have the spectacular area shots which make the most of the IMAX format such as Everest has. All in all, a mediocre effort from a usually winning team (McGillivray-Freeman).",1052352000,,614,4.433628318584071
1687149,5,B0000633SU,"First of all, I am a caver.  Before watching this IMAX movie in DC in an IMAX Theater I was afraid I would be disappointed because I realized this movie was to be made for the general public, was I wrong.  All thru this movie I kept thinking to myself, I can't wait until this movie is out on DVD, well it is and I highly recommend it.  True, it is written to address the general public, but as a caver of over 40 yrs I throughly enjoyed it and I have also bought the CD of the Soundtrack, it is a 5 star in my mind also and I am not a Moody Blues fan.
The photography is super, I like the behind the scenes part as much as the movie, so you are getting two shows for the price of one.  If something happened to my DVD of ""Journey Into Amazing Caves"", I would have to go out and buy another for my DVD library, I like it that much.
I have seen a few IMAX movies in my time and this is one of my favorites, if not my favorite, but I am a caver and I like caves.",1049068800,14,960,3.737623762376238
1687150,5,B0000633SU,"Even on a small screen, this IMAX special is riveting.  With visits to dry, ice and water caves, there are always thrilling moments.  Most of the first third deals with accessing the cave in the Grand Canyon with some nifty aerial tricks.  However, there is only a glimpse of the cavern itself.  More time is spent kayaking on the actual blue-green Colorado River.  The Greenland ice cave sequence again is more about the harrowing and dangerous aspect of unstable blue-ice caves, but still manages to thrill with fantastic photography.  The one last sequence in the cenotes of Mexico is truly amazing with divers actually taking off thier tanks to squeeze through holes!
The great soundtrack by the Moody Blues is not readily apparent and is played down except at the end and beginning.  The narration is sometimes annoying and juvenile, providing information that teenagers might find interesting.  I expected more cave shots and not science lessons.
However, this is a great film and includes a ""behind the scenes"" story that is every bit as interesting as the main movie.  The soundtrack in itself if better as a separate CD.",1042070400,14,1129,4.931216931216931
1687151,5,B0000633SU,"This is an amazing film! I haven't had the pleasure of seeing it on the IMAX screen though, but it is still breathtaking. I admire these 'cavers' for their courage in seeking out the unexplored places of the earth. Greenland was just beautiful, a place I know I won't be visiting anytime soon. There are many unexplored beautiful places on this planet noone has witnessed even yet, but this is a nice glimpse into that special world. I also recommend the soundtrack, very captivating. Enjoy! Peace, Dakota",1041465600,,505,4.816091954022989
1687152,5,B0000633SU,"If you have a widescreen TV, you won't be disappointed by this film.  Like all IMAX features, it's short but captures the most photogenic scenery imaginable.  It's not much more than an introduction to the world of caving, and it focuses on the search for extremophiles -- microorganisms which thrive in the most hostile of environments.  And in classic IMAX fashion, the film crew risks as much danger as any of the spelunkers but is so transparent you'll forget anyone else was there.
This film is replete with scenes of tiny humans in vast landscapes, cool blue glacial walls, breathtaking canyon vistas, and surreal, silent palatial caves.  The DTS soundtrack based on the music of the Moody Blues is perfectly expansive and well-suited for the glorious images.
Get this DVD.  Trust me.",1036886400,2,790,4.954545454545454
1687153,3,B0000633SU,"after a cave diving vacations in the Akumal area (where the underwater caves section of this film was made) i saw a magazine ad from this movie and to my surprise the movie was running in mexico city (where i live). a couple of days after my arrival i went to see this movie to the imax theater. i have to tell you all this because i was really thinking of it before actually seeing the movie. here i go:
pros:
1) there's no need to say that the photograpy was gorgeous and the huge screen leave you breathles at all times. after reading the credits (yes i do that), it was no surprise to find out that Wes Skilles was behind the underwater camera, he is one of the most experimented cave divers around and a incredible photographer, so thats one of the reasons that i'll probably end up buying this dvd.
cons
1) the film run time is to short (38 minutes)so if you're talking about underwater, dry and ice caves you will end up being short of time and leave the public wanting more. i ended up with the sensation of sex without any orgasm, frustated. if the producers idea was to show how ""cool and macho"" these beautiful places are there was no need to waste the talent and voice of Liam Nelson they just had had to send us a powerpont slide show and we would ended up with the same conclusion. but if the producers idea was to explain the importance of these places to the ecosistem and their beautiful fragility let me tell you that more imax film cans were necessary.
2) but what i really hated about this film (i will talk about the underwater caves only, the ones i know) is the fact that just like a mtv or xtreme sports video if focus more on the ""x factor"" of the caves, ""how cool they are"", how ""what's up dude attitude of the cavers"" and that's all wrong!!! it is bad reputation for the caves and a stereotypes the people who dive them.
maybe i was hoping too much from these film, maybe i was expecting something different from what mtv o xtreme sports would have done to cover this topic. that's my opinion. watch the film and have your own.",1026172800,11,2054,4.269230769230769
1687154,5,B0000633SU,I had been waiting for this film for some time as I was impressed with the same groups filming of everest. If you are not already interested in caving then this will wet your appetite. It nearly had me contemplating learning how to cave dive. I enjoyed the making of the film as much as the film itself and only hope it helps create more interest in preserving the beauty underground.,1019692800,2,384,4.422535211267606
7958355,5,B0000633SU,"The girl narrating it is awesome with her knowledge of caves and cave safety.  We could go to places without ever being in danger.
  But hats off to whoever wrote the music for this it is just as brilliant as the video itself and blu ray shows so much more definition.
  If i had seen this as a kid maybe i would have done something like this .. but it was college or vocational school and even though i was smart enough to go to college i went to voc. School.  But now i can show my boys they can do and be anything they want to be.",1498176000,,533,3.888888888888889

7958362,5,B0000633SU,"The quality of this documentary is unsurpassed. The cinematography, the locations chosen, even the people in the film are amazing. I can't say enough good things about this one. It is well worth the money to buy it on blu-ray, you won't be disappointed. I am planning on visiting one of the locations in the film next year, and can't wait!",1350518400,,339,4.573770491803279
7958363,5,B0000633SU,"1. I believe this film is actually a part of the ""IMAX Education"" experience and really was not meant for release as a form of entertainment. For educational value, this film hits it's mark. It's also still available to be seen in groups for educational purposes at most IMAX theaters. All you need do is call and set up a time/date and get pricing.
2. After seeing this feature on an IMAX screen, frankly, the film, on a television, unless it's at least 42"" and High Def, is really NICE but, not AMAZING!!! This film is for viewing on an IMAX screen in the LARGE SCREEN FORMAT. It's beautful on ANY screen so, don't be discouraged. But, it's FABULOUS on the BIG SCREEN and even better in High Definition.
3. The soundtrack, provided by the Brittish Classic Rock Group, The Moody Blues is not only hauntinly appropriate, it seems like the music was written for the film when actually only two songs off of the soundtrack were. The rest is alternate takes of Moodies Classics or re-recorded for the film and again, fit in perfectly. The Moody Blues (Justin Hayward, John Lodge, Grahame Edge, and Ray Thomas) did an incredible job and the soundtrack it's self is well worth the price of the CD. It is NOT just another Moody Blues Greatest Hits re-packaging.
3. The cinematography is incredible! If you can sit through the entire film, the last half of it make it well worth the wait. Especially if you have a big screen with decent definition.
4. Yes, some of the narrative is somewhat simplistic but, that's the nature of the educational beast. Again, this is a teaching documentary film that I think was meant to enlighten and inspire young and old to get involved in science, exploration and etc, rather than to ""entertain"" them.
So, in the end, if you don't PURPOSELY try to make more of this film than what is there, you'll enjoy it and appreciate it.
I didn't expect it to be any longer. Production costs for IMAX films are astronomical and so, unless it's a major commercial release with a lot of MONEY behind it, don't expect any IMAX feature to be much longer than 40 minutes. It's just too costly unless there is going to be a HUGE return on the investment, due to costs. It's why you don't see a lot of films done in the IMAX format and what we do see is usually geared to a MASS AUDIENCE with Children included in that formula.
For these reasons, I give the film 5 stars as taken it as what it is intended, it hits it's target in the bulls eye and does so with class, finess, and beauty. It's still an Amazing Journey and worth the price of admission.
The ONE AND ONLY NEGATIVE about the film is the fact that they do lead you to believe that Liam Neeson is going to Narrate. Alas, his involvement with this film is less than what is advertised on ANY LEVEL.",1283299200,2,2768,4.4400785854616895
7958364,3,B0000633SU,"Pros:
Some good footage inside various caves.

Cons:  The film mentions over and over the reason why these two women are exploring caves.... to find unique microbes that may someday cure cancer....  The repetition gets annoying.",1277424000,,228,5.277777777777778
