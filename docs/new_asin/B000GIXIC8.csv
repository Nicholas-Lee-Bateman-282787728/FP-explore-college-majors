2614164,5,B000GIXIC8,"My seven year old loves, loves, loves this series.  The main characters are quirky and not formulaic and the world they inhabit is made up of floating islands and dragons.  The hunters Gwizdo and Lian-Chu met at an orphanage and are fast friends.  Gwizdo finds the work, draws up contracts and Lian-Chu, the knitting warrior, does the actual hunting.  Hector is their little blue dragon what carries ALL of their equipment and is the muscle/motor for their flying machine called the St. George.  The women in this series are strong and capable. The reoccurring characters either run an inn with an iron hand or they are competent dragon hunters or aspiring dragon hunters. When Gwizdo or Lian Chu get off track, their friends set them right. We definitely like the series over the movie because the characters are more sympathetic and engaging. I do not mind that son watches the entire series over and over again.",1281830400,7,914,4.833333333333333

8132884,1,B000GIXIC8,"This is volume 2 of a TV series based on a feature film. I liked the original feature film Dragon Hunters, it was weird, unique, and had a startling sense of wonder. But the TV series has none of these. The drawing is terrible, the character Gwizdo is worse than irritating, he is an annoyance that makes the series unwatchable. However, I did like Lian Chu, the only decent character in the series, a true dragon hunter. It is too bad the TV series could not take the remarkable aspects of the feature film and develop it forward. Frankly, the background landscape is the best part of the TV series, not the characters. It stays as a one star review.",1490400000,,651,4.433333333333334

8132892,5,B000GIXIC8,"If you liked the CGI animated movie with forest whitaker, I probably butchered his name, sorry pal, you will love these episodes as well. Some have 4 and others have 3. They range from 75 min long too 100 min long but they are all worth the money. They are cute and fun and honest ont the mind especially for the kids. Watch with a pure heart. Not any blood or bad language, but dragons and creatures do die. If you don't have the movie Dragon hunters then get it, and then get all 5 discs with the 17 episodes on them. You'll like them. God bless you all.",1325548800,2,556,4.110091743119266
