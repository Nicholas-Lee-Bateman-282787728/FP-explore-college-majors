8716040,5,B00XIXJ9DA,"I loved this show so much. My love for animals made me pick it initially, and the animals are not just a distraction, but come with lessons on relationships. The family dynamic between the cast is so touching. The main lead, Shiba Ken, is one of the most expressive actors I have ever seen! His facial expressions are unrivaled!

The entire cast has great chemistry and you can't help but cry in several episodes, though this is a comedy the stories are serious. A recurring theme is reuniting with loved ones, and what really makes a family (The 3 leads are not related by blood).

You can see it on crunchyroll ^_^",1452643200,,616,4.491071428571429
