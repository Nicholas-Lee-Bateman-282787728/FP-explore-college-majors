7865608,5,6304242069,"The Beatles record their first LP, ""Please Please Me,"" which was also their first #1 single.  The album was recorded in one day, and on the last song, ""Twist and Shout,"" John's voice, from singing all day, begins to fail, which you can actually hear on the record.  The Beatles donate a song to the Rolling Stones, which they record and is shown here back-to-back with the Beatles' version.  The Beatles play on the London Polladium and the Royal Variety Show.  After a show in France, the Beatles get a #1 in America, which they treat with very high excitement.  The stellar live performances, the appearance and the young boys' good attitudes and cheery styles make this period of time one of the best for the Beatles.",1021507200,,720,4.637795275590551
7865609,5,6304242069,"Ladies and gentlemen, The Beatles!
We open with ""Rock and Roll Music,"" a studio recording with black and white movie footage accompaniment.  They then play ""All My Loving"" at the Hollywood Bowl, where we see not only a sell-out crowd, but hysterical girls standing outside the Bowl, with more fans sitting on trees across the street.  Not only was it an extraordinary concert, but, as George Martin says, it was ""a piece of history that will not occur again.""  ""All My Loving"" is the only song shown in this video, but if you desire to hear more, buy the 1977 record ""The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl.""
The Beatles record two new albums, one of which, ""Help!"", brings along a new film.  The Beatles, very addicted to marijuana by this time, laughed and laughed during the recording sessions, therefore making the film rather impossible.  (That is one reason for the film's funniness.)  Along with the movie, the Beatles perform ""Help!,"" ""Yesterday,"" ""Ticket to Ride,"" and ""Act Naturally"", all of which were recorded live on ""Blackpool Night Out"" on August 1, 1965.  They played 6 songs at this concert; the other 2 are ""I Feel Fine"" and ""I'm Down.""  That performance of ""I Feel Fine"" is available on Anthology 2, Disc 1.
Last but not least, the Beatles receive the MBEs, and meet the queen of England.",1019779200,,1302,4.730088495575221
7865610,5,6304242069,"If I were allowed just one Anthology volume on the proverbial deserted island, this is the one I'd take. Why? Because the electrifying footage from the historic Shea Stadium concert of August 15, 1965 is the highlight of the entire 8 volume set. Man, did they rock that night! Amped up on the adrenaleine of 56,000 shrieking Beatlemaniacs, the boys put the show of a lifetime. Nearly fifteen minutes (approximately half the concert) of beautifully restored footage makes its way onto Volume 5. The surge of energy reaches peak when a sweat-drenched John recklessly bangs the piano with his elbow during Paul's rave-up ""I'm Down"". The screaming throngs don't seem to notice, but George and Paul nearly double over in laughter, barely able to complete the song. The ""I'm Down"" fiasco perfectly depicts the deft manner in which the Beatles dealt with the ongoing madness which was their lives. Other highlights include meeting Elvis and the recording of Rubber Soul and Revolver, arguably the Beatles' best albums. Everything that was great about the Beatles --  from the memerizing spell of Beatlemania to the emergence of the world's greatest studio band-- is covered in Volume 5. It just doesn't get better than this.",1006819200,4,1217,5.024752475247524
