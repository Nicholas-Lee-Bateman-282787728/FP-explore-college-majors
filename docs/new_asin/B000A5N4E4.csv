8324960,5,B000A5N4E4,IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN CHECKING OUT A NUMBER OF MARTIAL ARTS WEAPONS AND LEARNING SOME EASY TO LEARN MOVES THEN THIS IS THE DVD FOR YOU. I AM INTERESTED IN THE JAPANESE SWORD AND HAVE GOT THIS PRESENTERS OTHER TWO BEGINNERS GUIDE DVDS ON KENDO AND IAIDO AND THIS ONE SHOWS HIM USING A WIDE SELECTION OF HAND HELD WEAPONS. I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED ON HOW SKILLED HE IS WITH THESE THINGS AND ON HIS LIVE BLADE SWORD DRAW. HE HAS SPARKED AN INTEREST IN ME IN LEARNING SOME OTHER MARTIAL ARTS WEAPONS AND IM PLEASED ABOUT THAT....HOWEVER IT IS ONLY A GUIDE AND HE DOESNT GO INTO A GREAT DEAL OF DEPTH BUT GIVES A REALY NICE OVER VIEW. I GIVE IT 5 STARS AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ... A WORTHY BUY.,1146960000,,690,4.156716417910448
