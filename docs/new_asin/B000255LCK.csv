2063019,4,B000255LCK,"Here we have the newest Steven actioner. The premise is basically that Steven s Billy Ray Lancing. A former agent who is now a survivalist working with animals. He is sponsering a girl named Irina. One day he receives a letter saying that Irina is no longer going to be able to correspond with him anymore. He thinks this is strange and goes to check it out. Matt Schulze plays Faisel(the bad guy). He is the boss of a human tracking network. The kids are being sold all across the world. Billy discovers whats really going on and tries to bring the network down.

As for the premise thats pretty much covers it. I liked the story in this one! Made more sense. The movie had a budget of $20 million, but it felt more expensive then that. All of the polish actors did a good job. The girl was good because she had emotion in her. The action SURPRISINGLY was average. There wasn't that much. But it was enough. People who have seen Belly of The Beast will maybe be dissapointed because the action scenes are not as fast. Matt was great as the villian! I would defenitly like to see Matt and Steven work together again. I will list the fight scenes in order:

1. Steven comes to his cabin with 6 men try to make him to go a van. He then says hell go quietly and then uses his aikido to defend himself.

2. Steven is leaving his hotel room when he sees 2 men coming down the hall. He then punches 1 of them and kicks him. The other he throws out a window.

3. Steven and his partner go to a house. When they get inside a assasin shots at them. Steven then pushes and slaps the guy around, but then escapes.

4. Steven and his partner go to a big room. They hide and wait for the bad guys to come. They have a shoot out thats is pretty fast.

5. The last scene is with Matt and Steven. They slap eachother then go to a sword fight.

All in all the movie was a good one, but don't expect a fast paced thriller like Belly of the Beast.",1090972800,4,1928,4.111702127659575
2063020,4,B000255LCK,"While it has some minor flaws it's a quality movie.  The action sequences aren't wire-fu or sped up.  The story is more believable than some of his other movies and the bond he shares with a pen-pal girl is a nice touch, as well as him teaching her secret code.  As in most of his other movies, he plays an ex-military/government agent that has more skill and wherewithall than any of the villians.  While this concept is the same in virtually *every* Seagal movie, it's still enjoyable to watch.  I do think he needs to branch out and play a different character than the same one he's played all this time.  All this aside, it's decent entertainment and it's better than his last two movies.",1090281600,31,692,4.496
2063021,5,B000255LCK,"For once Seagal gets a great script, thanks to screenwriter Trevor Miller. It's one of those stories you might've read in Time Magazine. Unsuspecting Americans are donating money to a Warsaw Orphanage. But this is no ordinary orphanage. it's a front for human trafficking. The kids are being sold on the internet, for nefarious purposes. But the human traffickers have one problem - Steven Seagal. He's been sponsoring a teenage girl at the orphanage - sending her letters, and money. And when the girl goes missing, it's Seagal to the rescue.
If you like good drama, spiced up with fight scenes - Out Of reach is for you. I never realized that Steven Seagal was such a good actor. But in Out Of Reach he flexes his acting muscles. He's imposing. He's cool. He's much more likeable than ever before. This might not be Under Seige. But what it lacks in explosions and pyrotechnics, it makes up for with clever dialogue, interesting settings, and a grown-up Seagal; who is strangely compelling.  It's a shame this movie never made it to Theaters, but in wide-screen (on DVD) the picture is dark, brooding, and ultimately quite a chilling ride. If you can't buy it - rent it. And if you can't rent it, put it on your Christmas List. Out Of reach is outta sight! A five star performance from Seagal!",1090108800,4,1295,4.655021834061135
2063022,5,B000255LCK,"Steven Seagal makes a strange return to form in what might best described as The Spy Who Came in From The Cold meets The Ipcress File. This is a stylish spy-thriller with overtones of Michael Caine and Ian Fleming. The set-up is simple enough: Seagal is a retired Spy who has sponsored a young orphan, in Poland. He sends her money and letters. Then suddenly, the girl goes missing. Seagal dusts off his trusty Browning 9MM, heads to Warsaw, and takes on what turns out to be a child-slavery ring.
That's the plot. But, what makes this a winner, is the stylish fight scenes. No to mention, Matt Schulze as the fantastically reptilian villain. Also the supporting cast, of largely unknown British and Polish actors are all very good. I liked the script. I liked the visuals. As for Seagal himself - he seems to be chanelling Marlon Brando, with his subtle, raspy, drawl. The climactic sword fight that ends Out Of Reach is truly spectacular. Obviously Director Poh-Chih Leong is drawing on his Hong Kong action-roots here. And for Seagal fans, you have to by this DVD; just to work-out who exactly has re-dubbed the Seagal voice-overs in some of the scenes. Two thumbs, way, way up!!!",1089763200,7,1183,4.6923076923076925
2063023,3,B000255LCK,"Is it me or does there seem to be a glut of Steven Seagal straight-to-DVD movies these days? I mean, we've had 'The Foreigner,' 'Belly of the Beast' and now the latest Polish-adventure installment, 'Out of Reach.' And as much of a 'fan' of Seagal's work as anyone can actually be, I have become accustomed to his fantasy, never-say-die screen persona in much the same way you grow used to the scars left by your youthful bout of chicken pox! Seagal's work is plot motivated for sure, the script worded a little too chessily for most tastes, the acts linked thinly at the best of times, but they are still good, honest, fun movies to sit back and crack a cold one to. In 'Out of Reach,' Seagal plays William (Billy) Lancing, a former covert agent turned survivalist who is thrown into his old line of work when he discovers that the foster program he is using to help a young girl is actually a human trafficking network. Sure, we've heard it all before, but it's the way that Seagal does his slow-mo karate moves on all the gun-totting assassins that makes it worth your hard earned dollars this time around! And, as I said before, this is set in Poland once again which is where last years 'The Foreigner' was set and trust me, his look is no different in either one! So, our man Seagal must have a two-for-the-price-of-one movie deal going on back a couple of years ago! Smart cookie! Oh yeah, of course there are fatal flaws in this film (in all his films!) - such as his supposed voice over which obviously is not his but is actually his arch enemy in the movie for some reason doing HIS dialogue! - but who cares anymore?! He sure doesn't so why should we? As stated, this is Seagal at his 'best' and so deserves to be rented or purchased as soon as possible!",1089331200,12,1764,4.397553516819572

The only thing that I hate is when I run across the voice-over's where its not Seagal talking its some other guy that doesn't sound like him at all.

2063036,3,B000255LCK,"Way above average for a straight-to-video Steven Seagal movie, Out of Reach has an outrageously unlikely premise and isn't afraid to have fun with it.  Basically Steven Seagal works with wildlife that are injured but once upon a time he was a seriously dangerous dude doing bad things for our government--and his former employers would like him dead in case he decides to write a tell-all book so he keeps a very low profile.  But he has one vulnerability--he sponsored a little girl in an orphanage in Poland and through the letters they write back and forth she has become his only friend and he is teaching her various types of coded cyphers.

Unfortunately the orphanage actually funnels young teenage girls into white slavery.  When his pen pal disappears Seagal travels to Poland to find her and in the process take down a white slavery ring that has eluded the local authorities for years.

The villain in Out of Reach is as much of a hoot as the goofy set-up.  He seems to live in the Taj Mahal his home is so immense.  He keeps Seagal's little friend around because he admires her intelligence, her ability at chess and her interest in cyphers.  He fences like an old-style upper-class villain played by Basil Rathbone once upon a time in Errol Flynn movies which eventually leads to a sword-fight showdown with Seagal.  When the bad guy realizes who is on his trail rather than do the ungentlemanly thing and simply dump the girl and disappear for a while he not only keeps her close by but even allows her to leave coded-cyphers for her would-be rescuer--unfortunately she doesn't realize her captor can read them as well.  My favorite is the message she leaves by rearranging a tray of sushi at a posh embassy gala--the message warns that it's a trap and the bad guy goes out of his way to make sure Seagal gets the girl's coded message, possibly to make things more sporting.

I was never a Steven Seagal fan when he was actually a movie star--his acting range was limited to saying his lines coherently, he always seemed too pleased with himself and he struck me as being immensely less likable than Jean Claude Van Damme, Sylvester Stallone, Chuck Norris or Arnold Schwarzenegger.  That said I do like two of his straight-to-video flicks--this one and Belly of the Beast which was directed by A Chinese Ghost Story's Ching Sui Tung.  If you are a genuine Steven Seagal fan unlike me you can probably add another star to my review.",1437436800,,2445,4.658139534883721

2063060,3,B000255LCK,"The plots of Steven Seagal's numerous direct to video movies, particularly those set in Eastern Europe, kind of run together into an indistinct blend of mayhem and destruction.  Out Of Reach (2004) features Seagal once again playing an ex-intelligence operative type, however offering a slightly different spin, as the main concern is the investigation of the disappearance of a young girl.

Living on a wildlife refuge in Canada, William Lansing (Seagal) has a special relationship with Irena Morawska (Ida Nowakowska), a thirteen year old girl who lives at an orphanage in Poland.  They exchange letters and share a deep friendship, until Irena and some of the other girls in the orphanage are turned over to a group led by Colonel Faisal (Matt Schulze), who is connected with an operation engaged in human trafficking.

When Lansing learns that contact with Irena has been lost, he travels to Warsaw, and violence soon breaks out.  Lansing kills a man who breaks into his room, but apparently that's not enough of an offense to be detained by the police.  When a young girl believed to be Irena is found dead, police detective Kasia Lato (Agnieszka Wagner) suspects that Lansing may be involved.  With the help of Nikki (Jan Plazalski), a young boy from the orphanage, Lansing gets a lead to Faisal, who is somehow tied to the Turkish embassy.

For unspecified reasons, the US Government wants Lansing, and several agents who have followed him to Poland, join forces with the flesh peddlers.  Things go off the deep end, as Lansing teams up with Detective Lato, and the two become very close, after Lansing extracts a bullet from her body, while she lying on a kitchen table.  Lansing sneaks into a party sponsored by the Turkish embassy, and discovers that Irena is still alive.  This sets the stage for the film's violent and mildly stylish conclusion.

While Out Of Touch is not well-written, the motivations of Seagal's character are admirable, and the action is fairly well executed.  The inclusion of children, and some other touches, like an injured bird, adds a little warmth, to a tale with huge gaps in logic.  What happens is often mystifying, including a bizarre nonsensical foray into a high class brothel, where a shootout occurs.  This is followed by a brief, mildly engaging sword fight, between Faisal and Lansing, set in a large atrium.  The setting for the finale has some potential, but unfortunately it isn't realized very well.

Seagal gives a generally solid performance, and appears to perform most of his action scenes himself, although his voice is occasionally dubbed.  Ida Nowakowska isn't given that much to do, but delivers a pretty good performance, as does Jan Plazalski.  Matt Schulze brings a pretentious weirdness to his thoroughly unlikeable character, whispering most of his lines, and attempting to act menacing, while terrorizing old women and little girls.

Compared to some of Seagal's more plodding direct to video releases, Out Of Reach grades out fairly well.  It delivers the kind of action you expect, and also provides slightly more emotional content, although you probably won't completely buy Seagal as a warm and fuzzy family guy.",1332374400,,3183,5.036259541984733
2063061,5,B000255LCK,"I really liked the movie, a lot of the time we get wrapped up in the action or drama but these are Movies and are intended to intertain us and this is what this movie does.....",1305849600,,176,3.9166666666666665
2063062,2,B000255LCK,"For Steven Segal fans, there are really only three groups of films - the good early ones, the military ones, and the other ones. The good ones are his early films, as Nico Toscani in ""Above the Law"" (1988), Mason Storm in ""Hard to Kill"" (1990), and my all time Segal fave Detective Gino Felino from ""Out for Justice"" (1991). His ""Under Siege"" (1992, 1995) films were a slight departure from the earlier films, but only in so far as it moved the setting from streets to military. I won't include ""Executive Decision"" (1995) in this discussion because you barely got through your popcorn before he disappeared. Starting in 1997 with ""Fire Down Below"" the story started to get in the way of the action, and the action started to recede into the background. Segal started shooting more than shoving, and his double began doing more of the moves. There are a couple of exceptions (e.g., ""Exit Wounds"") but generally speaking the films from the mid 90s onwards are a lot of talking and a lot of gesturing and not much else. A big drag.

Don't get me wrong. Segal has as much right to preach as anyone and I mostly agree with most of his sentiments. If he was giving a lecture I'd attend. But I go to see his films for the action - specifically for the non-traditional ways in which he combats his foes. Sure, throw in some Buddhist stuff and be respectful and meek and all that. But when the action is supposed to take over, let it flow.

""Out of Reach"" comes in 2004 in the middle of dozens of ""straight to video"" Segal films that fall into the third group - the ho hum other ones.

Segal (sans pony tail) plays an owner of a wildlife refugee who corresponds with a 13 year old girl in a Polish orphanage. She gets involved in human trafficking and Segal goes to her rescue, teaming up with a local policewoman. We get a few scenes of close-up hand-to-hand combat between Segal and 3 or 4 thugs, a few of the famous Segal pushes, and a climactic sword duel with Matt Schulze. You'll recognize Schulze from his roles as a villain in ""Blade"" (1998) and ""Transporter"" (2001) and their sequels.

The action is slightly better than average for one of Segal's ho hum films. Rapid Segal fans will want to see this film, but most of the rest of us will want to savor the good early ones.",1302652800,,2274,4.4071428571428575
2063063,2,B000255LCK,"This is one of two Steven Seagal movies, from around the same time, that I missed seeing when they first came out, I don't know if there were too many Seagal movies to keep track of at the time, or did they just all sound so familar that I thought I had seen them. Also, at this time Steve was making some of the worst crap of his once glorious career, so I wasn't always first in line to see his new flick, in fact I was becomming somewhat embarressed by the great one, and didn't want to see him in such failures. Well, no mater what the cause, six years later I got a hold of Out of Reach, slaped in the DVD and prepared for the worst. Luckily, it's not his worst, nor anything even close to being good, but as the saying might go, it's not half bad, well actually, a little more than half bad.

Seagal stars as a, well I'm not sure, we'll call him a mystery man. He lives in the forest, loves the wildlife, and correspondes with a 13 year-old ploish orphan girl. When she turns 14, she will be carted away from the orphanage, in the care of human traffickers, Seagal gets wind of this, though I'm not sure how, and hops the next plane out. Once in Poland, he must crack skulls, bust limbs, make friends with an orphan pickpocket boy, hook up with a hot Polish policewoman, and duel to the death (with swords) with the bad guy. All in ninety minutes work for Seagal.

The action is plentiful enough to keep the movie exiting and the viewer watching. The final battle with villian Matt Schulze, this is the swordfight, is actually fairly awesome. For Seagal die hards, but not necessarily anyone else. It should be noted that this is the first of Seagal's films where a large share of his dialogue has been dubbed by another actor, I don't know if it's just that nobody can due an impression of Seagal, or Sony Home Entertainment just didn't give a flying monkey pooh about it, but these ""actors"" never sound even remotley like Steve.",1267747200,2,1936,4.315934065934066
2063064,3,B000255LCK,"""Out Of Reach"" was a decent Steven Seagal effort. The plot was: William Lansing's pen pal gets kidnapped by an illegal human trafficking ring. Matt Schulze a.k.a ""Chupa"" from ""Blade II"" plays the very creepy villain Faisal. Also, in this film was Robbie Gee a.k.a ""Kahn"" from ""Underworld"".

The sword fight finale between Lansing and Faisal was short, but sweet. This scene was reminiscent of ""Marked For Death"" when Seagal fights the second & final ""Screwface"" at the end. Ahh nostalgia ...

My favorite part is right before the sword fight when Seagal says ""This my favorite moment in life"" and Faisal goes ""what's that?"" then Seagal says ""When the predator becomes the prey.""

Seagal deserves credit for tackling a real life issue in the world. Unfortunately, human trafficking takes place today. Seagal did this film 5 years before Liam Neeson's ""Taken"".

The voice dubbing that people criticize is only obvious in 3 scenes. The 3 voice-overs don't take anything away from the film. The voice dubbing was not as diabolical as ""Attack Force"" or ""A Dangerous Man"". The dubbing was done when the girl was reading the letter and when Seagal is thinking on the computer. The only obvious one was during the shoot out at the brothel. Steven Seagal voiced the majority of the lines himself (probably 90%).

The shoot out at the brothel was fan-F'n-tastic. Seagal was shooting at Robbie Gee and his cronies. Seagal turned that place into the ""Bordello of Blood"" better than ""Tales From The Crypt""!!!

Overall, I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars. You have to admire the noble task that  William Lansing embarked on. There is right and wrong in the world. Lansing was a hero. Seagal kills the villain Faisal with a ""Samurai Showdown"" move.",1267747200,3,1733,4.83445945945946
2063065,3,B000255LCK,"I just finished watching ""Out Of Reach"", and unlike the easily-definable DTV hits and misses like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Urban-Justice/dp/B000VECACQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Urban Justice</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Submerged/dp/B00083FZEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Submerged</a>, I'm thoroughly undecided about whether or not I like the movie or not.

It's got plenty of unlikable attributes that would ruin any other film, but the question that must be considered for all Seagal-starring flicks is whether or not its pluses outweigh its negatives. Let's look at it in an orderly fashion; maybe coming to a conclusion that way will be easier.

Story: Seagal is a reclusive ex-agent spending his time tending to injured woodland animals and writing to his pen-pal, 13-year-old Polish orphan Irena (Ida Nowakowska). When the girl is kidnapped by an international human trafficking ring, Seagal kicks butt to get her back.
Now that Liam Neeson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taken/dp/B001TODCII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taken</a>&nbsp;has been released, the story will be considered old-hat but nonetheless proves serviceable. While some of the chance happenings border on the ludicrous, the plot's not bogged down by endless sub-tangents and convolution. Straight-arrow is good for Seagal, even if you have to bend reality to keep it that way.

Acting: Fans know not to expect a lot from Seagal and they shouldn't change this prejudice for this one. Steven's his same old mumbly self but bad-guy Matt Schulze (playing almost the same role he did in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Transporter/dp/B00008AOVL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Transporter</a>) bests him for over-the-top hamminess...in a bad way. The rest of the cast is pretty acceptable, though: hero cop Agnieszka Wagner (""Thomas the Falconer"") and baddie agent Robbie Gee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underworld/dp/B0000VAFO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underworld</a>) don't discredit themselves, and young Ida Nowakowska is pretty good for a Polish girl reading and English script (her friend Jan Plazalski, on the other hand, could be the best child actor in the world but it wouldn't show through the completely weirdo role that was written for him).

Action: Most of the hand-to-hand action is quick and one-sided, but the choreography is fine and Seagal didn't call in too many stunt doubles this time around. A couple of solid gunfights distract from the lack of car chases. As a treat, the final showdown between Seagal and Schulze is a swordfight in a courtyard: it's nowhere near as fast-paced, lengthy, or exciting as the ones in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marked-for-Death/dp/6305168873/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marked for Death</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Sun/dp/B0006VL1IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Sun</a>, but is undeniably styled like a John Woo scene and therefore art-y enough to be appreciated.

Production: The editing is solid and without obvious glitches, though a few too many scenes feature off-screen voiceovers. Even worse, about a third of Seagal's dialogue is dubbed by another actor - one that sounds absolutely nothing like him - as well as a few of Matt Schulze's lines. The shooting locations aren't as drab as most of Seagal's made-in-Europe fare tends to be, with decent cinematography keeping most shots worth looking at.

I think I'm warming up to the movie, but purely because it's a Seagalian feature. Non-fans of his don't even need to think about checking this one out. The use of the very real crime of human trafficking as a plot device is realistic without being exploitive and is generally handled very well by director Po-Chih Leong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Immortality/dp/B000056VOT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Immortality</a>). Seagal's more likeable in this film than he had been recently, by way of his connection to the young girl via secret codes he taught her. The lengthy dubbing really gets on your nerves before long, though, and is probably the major reason why many perople don't approve of this one. In short, there are most definitely better DTV titles that our hero has done, but even if it's at the bottom of the ""acceptable"" rung, ""Out Of Reach"" fails to fall into the category of Seagal's bad movies. Fans will no doubt remain divided in opinion, but for what it's worth, it's staying on my shelf.",1215475200,2,4998,6.509774436090225
2063066,4,B000255LCK,"A small British-Polish thriller that exploits the common fear that lives and thrives in Europe. It is based on two associated lines of menace. On one side the problem of the numerous orphans in Eastern European countries and there illegal immigration into Europe. These orphans are little by little coming out but not through the normal official gate and highway but through some illegal procedure that transforms them into some kind of slaves. The second line is that of prostitution. In this case only girls are concerned, hence only female prostitution is considered. These two lines associate the fear of illegal immigrants, of national identity and its erosion in front of European integration and the moral fear or disgust at prostitution in general and at turning young teenage girls into prostitutes in particular. Then the involvement of some Turkish nationals is neither clear nor necessary but it corresponds to the desire to add an anti-Moslem touch and to fight against a possible integration of Turkey into Europe, a perspective many in Europe are against, though without any convincing arguments. In other words this film is more governed by European interest than anything else, and I mean political interests in this case. That is a real handicap because then the thrill is a lot less powerful and the story is a lot less convincing. The final escape of the two concerned children (what about all the others involved in the traffic in the film?) to the USA is even more surprising. What do Americans have to do with European prostitution?

2063069,2,B000255LCK,"On the trail of stinky excrements such as The Foreigner and Out for a Kill, current reigning straight-to-video monarch Steven Seagal returns to again inflict upon his ever-dwindling fan base more of his patented scowls, unsubtle enviromental messages, and his ridiculous, past-prime brand of martial arts.

Steven Seagal half-heartedly (and even that might be giving him too much credit) portrays William Lansing, a former special ops agent turned wildlife refuge environmentalist, who travels to Poland to look into why his 13-year-old orphaned buddy Irina Morawska has stopped corresponding (maybe she found out Seagal's 77 years old and is a slug). Lansing unearths a slimy but lucrative slavery ring and comes face to face with malignant main baddie Faisal. It now only remains to see how grisly a fate Faisal will have at the chubby but deadly hands of Lansing.

Out of Reach is utter crapola. The amateurish production values, the corny, highly derivative script and the cringe-worthy acting ""performances"" cause this video release to plummet faster than an ugly prostitute's self-respect. Seagal's mumbled diction is at an all-time low. At certain points, a voice actor had to dub Seagal's voice because the Green Peace sensei couldn't be bothered to come back to the studio for post-production work (it's so obviously not him doing the voice-over, reading those letters to Irina). The action sequences are so preposterous and so clumsily-set up that even David Carradine is giggling.

I was such a big fan of Seagal when he first exploded on the scene in Above the Law (1988). Back then, he was the epitomy of the film action hero, more down to earth than Van Damme and more realistic than Ah-nold. His first five features were awesome, stripped-down virtuoso cinemas of abrupt, lethal, down-and-dirty ass-kicking. In the 1990s,  the fact that he was a man of monosyllabic tendencies only contributed to his cultivated silent but deadly image. He was well on his way to becoming a martial arts icon. Then, sadly, pfffft...

Obviously, Seagal found out that he could still make beaucoup money without putting in a 100 percent effort. Over the years, the man had just let himself go, and it's a damn shame. True, he never was much of an actor: he probably uses his Burger King cash card more often than his SAG card. But now, even the low-rent genre he toils in should be embarassed to have him as a member.

Is it a surprise anymore when we find, in whatever film he's in, that his character has had special super-duper combat training in his past? First of all, if Steven Seagal were to now play a role other than that of an ex-military name-taker and ass-kicker, his Jabba the Hut-sized noggin would probably explode from the unexpected dramaturgical exertion, and all we'll have left of Seagal is the desolate remnants of a ponytail. His acting is now as strained and forced as his trousers belt must be. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen (I once walked out of a Dolph Lundgren flick; The Red Scorpion, I think it was) but it's pretty bad. For the record, Seagal has almost officially surpassed the unlamented Michael Dudikoff in terms of film careers rapidly circling into the toilet. One and a half stars. The rating would be lower but I'm sentimental.",1153008000,3,3273,4.898916967509026
2063070,1,B000255LCK,"This is not the Seagal of the early nineties. Something has happened to him and it's not good. He's gained weight, does not move like before, and is hard to understand. The technical process is terrible. I will never buy another Seagal (I have 14 of the old ones) again and I think Amazon should seriously consider taking this off their site.",1140048000,5,342,4.532258064516129
2063071,5,B000255LCK,"Whoa.  Seagal has just gone off in the last few years.  After getting back to theaters with Exit Wounds in 2001, he made the appalling Half Past Dead, and has now settled into his straight-to-DVD throne.

The guy must be making some serious change from these movies.  He's banged out around three flicks a year since 2003, all so dedicated to the new formula that I can only applaud him.  Seriously.  He just plays Seagal, and he's always an ex-secret agent, or something or other, he has the long coat to hide his wide-load body, and he whispers his words, getting dubbed in the process sometimes(!), and tries to underscore his films with a positive message about the environment, or life, or wisdom.  I mean, the man was proclaimed as the reincarnation of a Buddhist Lama not long ago, which apparently does not conflict with his doing one cheap action flick after another for a few million.  Oh, and he has a band and plays blues and tours and appears in guitar magazines.  What a renaissance man.

I don't remember the plot or story to this one, I only saw the last 15 minutes.  Suffice to say there are more exotic locales, another Asian director, excessive use of Seagal's army of stuntmen, more shameless Seagal mythology, more fat Seagal in long leather coats.

And yet, he is probably making more money than ever by now.  After that Mountain Dew commercial, because we all know Mountain Dew is the preferred elixir of Lamas everywhere, he is raking it in with these little gems.  They either have a) an Asian director, b) a rapper turned actor (DMX, Ja Rule, Treach, etc), or c) both.  The hairline retreating from his ever-expanding face, the acting still, er, bad, the action still incoherent due to editing that masks the fact that Seagal can't do any stunts (except for the one where he finishes off an IHOP Grand Slam breakfast in seconds), you know what you're going to get.  Idiotic 'entertainment' and a damn good laugh, even a cry for how far the large man has fallen.

2063072,5,B000255LCK,"Well maybe it's not _flawless_ per say. You might even say it's deeply flawed. I mean, if you're looking for semi-decent screenwriting, cinematography, action, direction, choreography, acting (for the most part), scenery or set-design than you will finish the film disappointed. But there are five factors which lead me to conclude that this is indeed, a masterpiece, and which leave me unable to give it anything other than full marks.

1) The bad guy, Matt Schulze, is like Kiefer Sutherland put through a B-Movie machine. Yes, he is more B-movie than KS.
2) One of the other actors in this used to be in a British Urban sitcom called ""Desmond's"". It was about a barbershop. And it was urban. And British.
3) There is a swordfight at the end of this movie. True, it is completely unexciting, and not particularly impressive, but it is a swordfight. You gotta give it that. I mean, have you noticed in those ""Rings Guys"" movies, or whatever they're called, they are all carrying around swords, but there is no real swordfighting. I mean, what gives! Anyway, I believe this is put in as a homage to the film ""Highlander"". As far as I know this was the first film to feature swordfighting, and they invented swords for it. I mean that's probably not true, but I'm not taking a degree in swords am I! Gimme a break! Do not send for Leo de Sarc, I am not doing no wrong!
4) Seagal is in a police station, using his own voice. He goes outside, his voice is dubbed. There are several scenes like this. Classic!
And finally:
5)Seagal rocks a totally sweet brown (and grey!) pleather coat for about half the film.

So an A+ then. Although not for effort.",1133222400,5,1647,4.5608108108108105

2063075,1,B000255LCK,"When I saw so-so actioner 'Belly of the Beast,' I thought Steven Seagal was well on the way to his 'comeback,' finally realizing that authentic-looking martial arts actions are what gave him the stardom, which is however fading away very fast.  Now I saw this film, and know I was terribly wrong.  His next film 'Out of Reach' is a huge letdown, probably the final nail in the coffin.

Don't get me wrong, I really like his films made in the 90s, like 'Under Siege' action-packed escapism entertainment.  In 'Out of Reach' Steven Seagal plays one Billy Ray Lancing, an ex-agent living in the wilds of Canada, where he finds injured animals and bring them to health.  Yet another embironmentally conscious hero from Seagal, but ... doesn't he see that these social messages have nothing to do with making good action films?

Add to that, Billy Ray exchanges letters with a little girl Irena living in an orphanage in Poland.  When it is reported that she is missing, and a nasty businee of 'human traffic' is suspected, he travels there incognito, secures a help from the local policewoman (while he has no ID), speaks a bit of French, and hits a PC keyboard like a pro, better than a Polish technichian, to restore a secretly recorded image.  We meet a hissable baddie (Matt Schultz), but anyway we are sure Seagal will win, because he has taught the little girl how to decode the 'cyphers' (and check out how she uses it, a scene which makes unexpectedly hilarious 'you-gotta-be-kiddin' 0moment).

So, how about the fact-moving kicking and chopping, once Seagal's trademark?  No, these thrilling martial arts actions are gone forever in this new film.  You just don't have actions in 'Out of Reach.'  As I counted them, well, in the first 40 minutes of 'Out Of Reach' you can see only two action set-pieces: in one, Seagal's hero Billy breaks a few arms and legs of the unkind government agents (about 30 seconds), and much later Billy smashes the glass of hotel bathroom and drops an assassin onto a parked car (another 30 seconds).  That's it, that's all.

There are more actions to come, obligatory shoot-outs and sword fights, but not enough to call 'Out of Reach' an action film.  The pace is terribly tedious, the images (when at night) are too dark, and worst of all, not only Seagal but slmost all the Polish cast sleepwalk in the pedestrian story.  Little girl looks bored while she is supposed to be in danger.

Finally, about director Po-Chih Leong (fairly good in Jude Law's brooding thriller with a vampire theme 'The Immortal') who is the least likely choice in Seagal's entire filmography to succeed in staging exciting actions, and the results turned out as we feared.  The slow-paced story is sleep-inducing, and what little action bits in the film are amateurish at best, with poorly-constructed shots in which fast editing attempts to conceal Seagal is no longer moving his bodies like he used to do.",1110672000,9,2920,4.7713717693836974
2063076,3,B000255LCK,"Joseph Heller could have easily been talking about Steven Seagal when he wrote: ""Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them."" Steven Seagal plays Lansing in ""Out of Reach.""  The basic plot goes something like this: Lansing is an ex-government agent (something called C.S.A) with a dark and mysterious past that is never even remotely revealed; he now lives on a wild life refuge and exchanges letters with a little girl (Irena) in an orphanage. This would at first be a little creepy, but an even creepier guy shows up at the orphanage and draws our attention away from Seagal because he takes all the girls to Turkey and sells them online to other creepy men like himself.  Apparently, trafficking a dozen teenage girls is a 100 million dollar illegal business that everyone in Turkey turns their eyes away from, except our hero, Lansing, and a beautiful, blonde, and (let's not forget) single cop. Also making an appearance is Seagal's strangely combed back hair, which makes him look oddly like Sesame Street's The Count. Give the Count months of protein shakes and growth hormones, maybe even a cold, slightly bored stare, and it would be just as menacing as Seagal in this film.  Also, let's not forget the slightly condescending and effeminate narrative voice-over.  (Voice-overs always mean it's a high quality film.)  Seagal also passes down some Eastern philosophy: ""Pave your own path. Do not wait for others to lead you.""  But lucky for him the antagonists have idiotic one-liners that are juxtaposed next to his, thus elevating anything Seagal says: ""Like any rose, the company must cut its thorn""; ""Learn to love pain, it'll set you free""; and my favorite mixed metaphor of the movie, ""If you don't protect your King, you're on the road to ruin.""

Murat Yilmaz (Azimi) delivered a surprising performance.  He plays a quiescent, alcoholic, sneaky kleptomaniac 12-year-old who is smarter than the entire police force in Poland and likes to communicate with nods and raised eyebrows.  Apart from every scene he's in, my favorite scene has to be when the blonde cop asks Lansing why he cares so much for this girl, and he replies by talking about his dark and mysterious past: ""There is something bad I did in my past, and I'm trying to make up for it.""  At first it's a mystery what he's talking about, but it becomes clear later that the bad thing he did was either ""Half Past Dead"" or ""Exit Wounds.""

We also get 2 Seagal's in this. For the first half of the movie he looks like the same Steven Seagal from Belly Of the Beast but by the end we have a quicker leaner Seagal from the past. There was enough money spent on this but the end result is not worthy of all that cash. How much does it cost to film two people hitting each other for a few minutes!

Billy Ray Lancing is a former covert agent (I was so surprised to find that out!) turned ""Survivalist"" who spends his time rescuing animals and getting in touch with nature. He is called to action however, when he suddenly discovers that the foster agency he is using to help a young girl is actually a front for a human trafficking industry. In time honored fashion the girl disappears, and Steven must put down his pruning shears and hemp weed knitting and rescue her. Plenty of rough & tumble, hard stares and stern ""If you harm her I'll......."" warnings follow as he cuts a swathe through the immoral band of naughty men, and the movie follows the standard formula. Our hero can of course make a high powered weapon from a stick of gum, and an empty beer can, and you immediately know that the army he is fighting have no chance. I know I am quite damning about these recent Seagal straight to video productions, which might make you ask why I keep watching them? Well, to be honest I've always been a fan of the aimless action flick, and Seagal has done some really fine work. Sadly as I hold my breath and wait for a return to movies of the Under Siege calibre, I find myself turning blue watching stuff like this instead. This is probably not as bad as the previous two offerings he has made, and credit to him for still managing to churn this stuff out, (he's hardly a young man anymore), but it is still pretty bad. Another complaint is the eco stuff - I have no problem with his obvious desire to make people more ecologically aware and responsible, but there is a platform to do it on properly, and this isn't it. Like Dangerous Ground, Fire Down Below, and The Patriot before this, the moralising wears a bit thin, and makes you ask him to jump one way or another. Either make a gratuitously violent action flick, OR a Greenpeace documentary, but STOP putting the two together please.

2063081,3,B000255LCK,"If you are a Steven Seagal fan, as I am, you will enjoy this movie for the plot and theme.  He generally has a cause that he trys to express in many of his movies, and this is no different.  I don't know much about the man outside of his movies, but from what I read in those I think he is a man with some deep convictions on certain topics.  It shows in his movies.  In this movie it is the human slave trade of young women which does go on, even today.  People have different ways of making social statements and I think this is his way of doing it, through some of his films.

This movie though lacked the action scenes normally found in his films, and the voiceovers completely ruined the movie for me.  How disconcerting to here the thoughts of the main character, Seagal, as an aside but with a completely different voice from his???  That happens throughout the entire movie. What in the world was the director thinking of?  This was absolutely the dumbest thing I think I have seen in a movie.  In addition, some of the action scenes were so obviously staged, and that showed too: specifically the sword fight and also in a couple other places. These made the action scenes seem unreal unlike most of his movies.

In any case it is worth a rental to watch.  The theme and plot were well done I think, and the script was pretty good too.  The young girl did a fine job of acting, also.  I think most Seagal fans will like this movie, but be upset with the voiceovers, as I am.
