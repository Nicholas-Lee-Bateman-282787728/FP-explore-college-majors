8681674,4,B00O2QWBOQ,"Nice health segments by one of my favorite actresses, Jane Seymour, who played Dr. Michaela Quinn on the 1990's series Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman.  Each of the 13 episodes is 30 minutes in length.  Each episode opens and closes with sponser commercials, such as Aetna health insurance, and then Jane introduces each topic followed by a personal story of someone experiencing that particular topic.  Jane then speaks with doctors and there are questions introduced by the audience.  Topics include autoimmune diseases, diabetes, women's cancers, and other topics.",1424649600,3,560,5.402298850574713
