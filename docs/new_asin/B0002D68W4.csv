Jim Clark Jr. is a top notch practical Three Gun competitor and this DVD/video gives some of his thoughts on working the practical/action shotgun. The ""combat"" in the title is a bit of a misnomer (even though the techniques are very similar) but only a fool would be confused by that given the fact that Mr. Clark, a prominent competition shooter, is the host.

The real weakness here is the descriptions are erratic. No standards or any approach to practice/training is really offered. Some of the shooting demos are interesting and Clark is clearly a talented action shotgunner but the much of the video is a camera man chasing him hand held.",1291593600,,744,4.628787878787879
8026454,1,B0002D68W4,"This DVD is the result of rednecks having a digital video camera.  This is the most unprofessional; over priced DVD I have ever seen.

This DVD has nothing to do with ""Combat Shotgun Techniques"".  This is a guy and his buddy with a video camera a shotgun and no script (Un-edited).

If you're a competition shooter and are really board and would like to waist the money this is for you.  How ever please understand, this video has NOTHING TO DO WITH COMBAT TECHNIQUES.",1102291200,16,468,4.523809523809524
