3876890,5,B0029JW2VA,"Theme Park Review's ""Roller Coasters In The Raw"" series are essential for any roller coaster fan. They include extensive video footage without any distracting music or annoying hosts that other roller coaster DVDs have. This volume features rides that have been torn down or are not currently opperating with little hope of salvation. It is as close to getting to ride these classics as you can get. The footage is shot exeptionally well. If you are an enthusiast or just someone who enjoys roller coasters, these DVDs surpass expectation and will bring you loads of entertainment.",1244764800,5,581,5.0625

I'll throw it out there right now...GREAT JOB! I'm amazed how many rides you had footage of that are no longer operating. A lot of these rides I wished I could have ridden and I'm glad that you guys put this DVD together so that many of us viewers could experience these rides. Some of the rides I do miss riding and others I'm truly glad they got rid of *cough*Flashback*cough*.
I may be in the minority hear but I really liked the old fashion videos of some of the older coasters that are featured near the end of both Discs. I'm really happy that people found some of their old footage to contribute to this DVD because it just makes it that much better.

Excellent work you guys and keep the DVD's coming because I will be here to buy them!

I love these DVD's by Theme Park Review...they show all the coaster footage they can of some crappy coaster to make that one person out there in the world be able to sleep at night knowing that they finally saw that coaster in action.

RAW 3 gets 3 thumbs up!

3876892,4,B0029JW2VA,"Although not as good as the other videos, I think its great that they put together videos of defunct rides that we will never see again. There are many funny moments on this DVD especially with the very rough rides, like Hurricane, Python, Orient Express, and Fujin Rajin 2, those scenes are hilarious, but they look extremely painful! I was very excited to see the footage of The Bat from Kings Island, Mega Zeph (because I've never seen those rides in action before.) Its said to see the Villian go the way it did. The extremely old footage of some rides were pretty entertaining also.  Thanks for another good video! Can't wait to see whats next from Theme Park Review!",1242604800,,672,4.6

8357817,5,B0029JW2VA,"My son has been fascinated by roller coasters for most of his life. I'm pretty sure we owned all of the videos intended for kids, and while he liked them, I sure got tired of hearing the cheesy dialog over and over and over.  Happily, his taste in both roller coasters and entertainment has become more sophisticated. I bought this for him and it quickly became his favorite, in large part because of the historic shots of roller coasters that have gone to that great Amusement Park in the Sky. If you have a coaster fan on your gift list, you won't go wrong with this one. The production quality is excellent and their customer service is superb.",1260576000,3,647,4.483050847457627
8357818,5,B0029JW2VA,"If you love amusement parks, are fascinated by roller coasters or just like watching people have fun, then this is for you. As with all the Robb Alvey dvds I have seen the production quality is great. Though this edition deals with defunct roller coasters there are second hand videos of lesser quality. But then again, how else would you get to see some of these ghost of the past?",1253664000,,382,4.4714285714285715
8357819,5,B0029JW2VA,"I love the roller coaster in the Raw 3 DVD  It is good for those to see coasters that they have not had the opportunity to ride plus for others, it brings back memories.  For me, it is a good reference source since I do construct roller coaster models.  I also recommend in the Raw volumes 1 and 2 also. Great for all roller coaster lovers.  Hope to see more.",1246147200,5,359,4.085714285714285
