What I remember principally is how it drew me in. A surgeon (I think British) visiting an East European country is asked to perform a difficult operation on a local man. The surgeon is not informed that the man is the dictator of the nation. He is told this only after the surgery seems to be a success. Although a ""success"" the patient then dies. Because no one must know that the dictator is dead, the surgeon must die. He prefers not to and runs away. The rest of the movie is about his run. On the way he meets a very comely young lady who sings the song ""Paper Doll"" in a charming accent. That's about all I can remember. Although I do remember the surprise ending, which I will not give away. Why the Christ isn't this fine movie available? Who would simply sit on a movie when it could be used to make money? This is a violation of human rights! As a citizen of the world I declare this film in the public domain and give permission to anyone to sell it or give it away. And anyone who disagrees with me can kiss my ass!",1463356800,,1173,4.149122807017544

It's a cat and mouse game of thrills and intrigue set in a mythical  European country. I like it more than 'The Third Man', and yet it's not available on DVD or Blu-ray! With a terrific cast including Herbert Lom, Jack Hawkins and Glynis Johns, this is one great film, I only hope someone will do the right thing, and get this released officially on DVD soon!",1453334400,,452,4.5
