2772749,5,B000NO2402,DVD Set has sent well before the expected delivery date.  Excellent DVD set.  Engrossing and loved watching it!,1200096000,,111,5.111111111111111
2772750,2,B000NO2402,"The first 2 discs (4 episodes) were exactly what i was expecting. True to life re-enactments. Very good.

The problem with this History channel series is when it get to the 3rd and 4th disc. There are no more re-enactments. Instead its mostly narration by Danny Glover. The last two discs, half of this series is very boring and not as clean and crisp as the first two discs.

Pass by this",1184284800,47,389,4.388888888888889
2772751,4,B000NO2402,"An outstanding collection of the best episodes of History Channel's ""Civil War Combat"" and ""Civil War Journal,"" the latter hosted and narrated by actor Danny Glover.

My only real qualms (and the reason I give this set 4 stars out of 5) is because A&E/History Channel basically recycled these previously released episodes and simply boxed them up together. That's fine and all as it's more convenient to have all of them together, BUT...if you're going to do that, why not put these episodes into anamorphic widescreen and/or remaster the video images as well? Some of these episodes look like they were transfered to DVD straight from a VHS source.

But this should not take away from the fact that these are extremely well-made histories - informative, educational and obviously produced by and with the assistance of those with a distinct passion for the Civil War.

Definitely worth your time and attention!",1181606400,67,911,5.0198675496688745

2772762,1,B000NO2402,"Being a Civil War buff, I was so excited to get this set as a gift.  The excitement disappeared when I watched the first disc.  The whole series presents the Civil War out of order.  Found out that the History Channel combined two different series into one set.  Can't believe they couldn't get the discs in chronological order.  Not much attention to detail on the covers.  They misspelled McClellan's name on the back of disc 5's cover.

Compared to Ken Burn's series, this set should not be on the same shelf.  It should be hidden away or shredded.

Not a Happy Camper",1331683200,3,571,4.519607843137255
2772763,4,B000NO2402,The show is very well done!  It stays on the path and doesn't seem to stray into conspiracy's or rumors.  Great series to show in schools!,1326758400,2,138,4.269230769230769
2772764,5,B000NO2402,"I consider myself somewhat of a Civil War Expert and this seems to be the best video I have found on the topic. It's very detailed and accurate with the information. I will continue to get movies made by the History Channel, for they truly are the best!",1274400000,3,253,4.291666666666667
2772765,5,B000NO2402,Very good coverage of the Civil War.  Wish more people would watch and understand the War Between the States.,1273190400,,109,4.7368421052631575
2772766,2,B000NO2402,"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers on here that this series, though reasonably priced, is not really worth your money.  Most of the problem with it is not its quality or production that is quite good.  It has more to do with the series being more of an odd pick of some essential battles of the Civil War, rather than a documentary done in some chronological order.  It more resembles parts of a much bigger series, lets say with 15 episodes for example, where 6 are just chosen at random and sold as a collection.  I would only recommend purchasing this series if you can find it used, and at a substantially reduced price...",1248048000,10,640,4.398305084745763
2772767,1,B000NO2402,"I bought this at Sam's Club (same title, packaging and UPC) and tried to return it, unsuccessfully. The back of the box says there is a ""24 page companion booklet,"" and ""interactive DVD-ROM content."" Neither of those is there, and though the Amazon listing does not seem to mention them, in case you are relying partly on a description of the same product from elsewhere, be forewarned.
  As I said, I attempted to return my copy. This is my highly biased opinion colored by my expectations. I was looking for a comprehensive understanding of more than the battles and generals involved. Do understand that I didn't have the patience to view the whole thing, but from watching the first disk and dipping into chapters on each of the other disks, it is my conclusion that this is an attempt to dramatize the battles and personalities involved, rather than to present an education in the many  aspects of a broad history of the war.
  Chapter after chapter seemed to consist of a few portentous comments by either Danny Glover or Roger Mudd, followed by endless battle reenactments, interspersed with short comments by historians on the battles and generals. I found myself overwhelmed by statistics of deaths and injuries, descriptions of tactics, and once again, endless battle reenactments.
  The Civil War was a turning point in American History. I expected to learn about the myriad contributing causes: political, economic, social, and more, along with the many facets of the consequences of the war. I wanted to learn about the times and the civilization that were backdrops to the war. I don't need to watch ten hours of battle dramatizations to understand only that there was tremendous suffering and heroism during that time.
  Gosh I wish I could return mine.  When will I learn not to shop at Sam's Club?",1231027200,5,1814,4.879478827361564
2772768,4,B000NO2402,"I enjoy Civil War history and decided to add this to my collection. While the programs themselves are enjoyable, I found myself scratching my head as to how this collection was put together.

It's not a ""new series"" but contains episodes of both The History Channel's ""Civil War Journal"" and ""Civil War Combat"" which aired originally in the mid 90's. (Until recently these were often shown on THC in the early morning hours). THC also has a couple of different boxed sets of ""Civil War Journal"" and some of the episodes here are included. For whatever reason, though, it seems impossible to obtain the ENTIRE collection of this great series. (From what I can determine, the whole series was originally released on VHS some time ago but is no longer available).

Regardless...

It is odd to me also that the various episodes here are presented in no particular order. You would think that something called ""The History Channel Presents the Civil War"" would perhaps start out with Fort Sumter on volume one, and go in chronological order. However, that's not the case here. Fort Sumter is somewhere on disk 3, I believe.

I feel like some intern at THC said, ""Hey, let's take some of these old shows and just throw some of them together as a DVD set!"" and someone listened.

Despite my irritation with the format, I really do enjoy this programming. It's just too bad that these great series are not grouped together as ONE boxed set.

Still, this is worthwhile and not too pricey.",1223596800,32,1479,4.713178294573644
2772769,1,B000NO2402,"I  expected more. No discussions on the facts, no timeline explanations, no didatic at all
Merely description of events.
For advanced experts,
If you are a newbie and really want to learn about Civil War do not purchase this.",1219190400,6,225,4.769230769230769
2772770,1,B000NO2402,The last four videos are too biased and very opinionated.  it took away the real truth of the story.  Danny Glover and the guest historians explain the story based in their opinions and feelings.,1218067200,9,195,4.705882352941177
8179703,5,B000NO2402,"What I like about many DVD sets as that you have no idea what you're buying... I think ""pig in a poke"" describes it. I thought that after buying this for an inflated price at Barnes & Noble. Don't get me wrong, I like the series and most of the episodes, but if I'd known what I was getting I wouldn't have bought it. So, here's what you get:

Disk 1. From THC's ""Civil War Battles"": The Hornet's Nest at Shiloh; The Bloody Lane at Antietam
Disk 2. Also from THC's ""Civil War Battles"": The Wheatfield at Gettysburg; The Tragedy at Cold Harbor
Disk 3. From ""Civil War Journal"": John Brown's War; Destiny at Fort Sumpter
Disk 4. Also ""CW Journal"": The Battle of 1st Bull Run; The 54th Massachusetts
Disk 5. Also ""CW Journal"": West Point Classmates - Civil War Enemies; Robert E. Lee
Disk 6. Also ""CW Journal"": Stonewall Jackson; Sherman and the March to the Sea

Each episode is about 48 minutes. It's a good collection, except I could have done within the 90 second unskippable THC network commercial about how I'm flying in a spaceship, fighting against Genghis Khan, etc. Thank God for the mute button.",1501891200,,1103,4.51
