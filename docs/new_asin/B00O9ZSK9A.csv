6729594,3,B00O9ZSK9A,Actor playing Rickover bland but overall documentary good.  Understand interviews with midshipmen close to accurate,1419120000,,115,6.666666666666667
6729595,5,B00O9ZSK9A,"As one of Rickover's men, I can relate to many of the stories in this excellent portrayal.  It is accurate, not harsh, yet shows clearly the sometimes irascible nature of one of my life heroes.",1419033600,27,193,4.514285714285714
6729596,4,B00O9ZSK9A,"If you're a nuke, you've heard a lot of these anecdotes before. It draws heavily from Polmar's and Rockwell's books and the sea stories therein; having someone act them out (poorly, I might add) adds very little. Often Admiral Rickover is portrayed as a bitter old man, ranting away without context. For example, it talks about Rickover stressing the candidates he interviewed for the program, without really explaining WHY he did so.

Still, there is a lot to like here, if for no other reason than the story itself is so compelling. We're endlessly fascinated by our engineering triumphs; here is one of the biggest that the public is only dimly aware of. It's an important story, an inspiring story, and this special does manage to capture some of that. There are a lot of video clips (notably the Barbra Walters interview) that even nukes may not have seen, and they had no trouble getting some pretty big names on board to talk about their first-hand experiences.

All in all, it's a good first attempt and I hope it inspires others to explore this story in more detail.",1419033600,4,1075,4.712765957446808
6729597,5,B00O9ZSK9A,"A powerful documentary and tribute to the life and achievements of Hyman Rickover, the man and the legend.  The filmmakers put us in a front row seat for Rickover's journey from his arrival in America from Poland at the age of 6, through his battles with the Navy, federal bureaucrats and defense contractors, his eccentric personality traits and unique management style, and his ultimate victory in realizing his vision.  This documentary is a ""master class"" on how the ""father of the nuclear Navy,"" surrounded by bureacratic inertia and conformity, transformed the U.S. fleet and spearheaded the creation of a whole new industry with the potential to meet the world's future energy needs--without burning fossil fuels. His relentless focus on safety resulted in a totally new nuclear propulsion system for Navy ships that has not experienced a single reactor accident in more than half a century.  Rickover's inspiring story, brilliantly told and re-enacted in this documentary, is full of lessons on leadership, strategic vision, overcoming obstacles, getting results, innovation, team-building and sheer perseverance that will inspire anyone who has dedicated their life to public service and is fired by the passion and commitment to change the world for the better.",1418860800,2,1271,5.376884422110553
6729598,3,B00O9ZSK9A,"I build nuclear submarines and am well-versed on the subject. This documentary was a hodgepodge of historical fact and re-enactment, but no new ground was broken. I would have liked to see more authentic recordings and videos of the Admiral instead of dramatizations. I would argue the Admiral himself would reject those dramatizations as phony and prefer the same.",1418688000,4,365,5.203389830508475
6729599,5,B00O9ZSK9A,"I watched the Rickover documentary by Manifold Productions. As one who had worked with many in the Nuclear Navy, this documentary has best captured the stories I had long heard about the famous Admiral.  The film had a good mix of dramatizations and archival footage.  Both Rickover's supporters and critics were given a strong hearing.  My only quibble is that there should have been some discussion of the Thresher accident and its impact on the program.  Nevertheless, this biographical film on Admiral Rickover is long overdue and does great justice to this important historical figure.  I recommend this to anyone interested in the history of the nuclear Navy or nuclear technology in general.",1418169600,21,698,5.1415929203539825
6729600,5,B00O9ZSK9A,"I went active duty in the US Navy as a Nuclear Propulsion Candidate in 1984, but I never knew much about Adm. Rickover. I appreciate this documentary covering Rickover's life and how he influenced the development of nuclear power in the Navy and in civilian life. Although I did not graduate from the nuclear program, I served as a conventional Machinist Mate in the Navy for a few years. I wish I had known more about Rickover's life back then. I'm impressed by the number of high-ranking and influential people who were able to offer their comments in this video. The acting in the dramatization segments wasn't great, but it was serviceable.

I'm highly irritated by the arrogant mob mentality that finds some issue to use for virtue signalling, using the emotional appeal of popular entertainment, to sway people into doing the wrong things for the wrong reasons. That's what I saw with all those jerks singing protest songs against nuclear power. That's the way the Liberal Left has been for most of a century. Some Western countries don't even allow nuclear ships to moor in their harbors, such is the poisonous insanity that has influenced the general public.

At two hours, this video is a bit long for most people's attention span unless they have a particular issue in one of the topics addressed.",1510617600,,1307,4.804444444444444
6729601,5,B00O9ZSK9A,"This should have also been dedicated to Adm. Rickover.  So many of the things he claimed ARE so.  The claims were so then and have only escalated.  Our nations education isn't as high now as it was in his time.  The various military, political and various types of rape of our country suffers; has only escalated.  We citizens of America have allowed it as long as it doesn't affect us personally.  Our laws and the medias help dress it up; its a shame there weren't more like Rickover.",1509580800,,486,4.465909090909091
6729602,5,B00O9ZSK9A,"I heard a lot of bad and a lot of good about this larger than life figure.  This documentary was exceedingly well done although I suspect the ""role playing"" was an understatement.  I doubt I would have liked working for the man...I don't enjoy being around anyone who treats others like garbage, he was a bully, but his results are impeccable and seeing his background with life and the Navy it is ""understandable.""  The second half is the best part in my opinion.  Having retired from two careers affiliated with government service there is a LOT of hard hitting truth reference people selling their souls or giving away their integrity for a dollar and this man did resist it.  I thought it was supremely well balanced.  It had former President Carter and other extremely high ranking government officials and contractors in it...some who Rickover called a liar!  I don't watch television (I don't let the garbage and accompanying bombarding commercials in my house) so I watch a LOT of educational and documentary shows, as well as movies and I MUST place this documentary in the top 5 documentaries I have ever seen!",1507334400,,1120,4.802083333333333
6729603,5,B00O9ZSK9A,Excellent documentary. Adm. Rickover was one of my personal heroes. I served a significant portion of my naval career onboard nuclear submarines. The training was intense; the standards were high and the crews were of the highest caliber. I can personally attest to the fact that Rickover was quite a character. Changed my life dramaticlly for the better! Thank you Admiral Rickover.,1505952000,,383,5.193548387096774

6729605,3,B00O9ZSK9A,"Historically significant story not only of the genesis of the nuclear Navy, but also of one man's battle against the forces of mediocrity. Rickover did far more for the country than it ever did for him.

Nelson is a talented actor but he is woefully miscast in this role.",1505520000,,271,4.530612244897959
6729606,4,B00O9ZSK9A,"This is a piece of history worth telling and worth learning.  Only disappointment:  inattention to detail on the part of the writers.  Sloppy writing about a man who would not tolerate sloppiness is a kind of insult.  Aside from the Naval uniforms and other Navy details, the program starts out with the wrong terminology about what was being created by Rickover.  The script says it would be the first true submersable.  Wrong Wrong Wrong.  All the submarines up until this time WERE submersables.  This was about the first true submarine.

One great truth exposed here is the danger of bureaucracy in anything.  The Navy that ignored Rickover is the same Navy that took three years into WW2 before it had a working submarine torpedo, taking the word of bureaucrats who had never tested their work over that of submarine commanders who missed target after target due to torpedoes that ran deep or expoded prematurely or were duds.  People who think and do are enemies of the world of forms and procedures.

If you can overlook the flaws, this is a 5-star documentary.  The flaws knock it down to 4 for me.  In spite of its shortcomings, this was a worthwhile production.",1505433600,,1171,4.7611940298507465

If you're not familiar with Rickover, you should watch and share with the young. This is an important part of American History.

The only corny thing about the movie is showing Rickover hiking in the woods to Oak Ridge. I hope this doesn't give the impression that there were no roads in Tennessee when Rickover wanted to visit the Nuclear plants.",1468627200,,468,4.8375

6729622,5,B00O9ZSK9A,"As a retired Navy Chief Yeoman, who served in the Submarine Service, I can tell you that I have put together many a ""Rickover"" letter. many cups of coffee, many hours into the wee hours, proofread after proofread.  With my CO and XO standing over my shoulders while I took dictation from them.  I would hand carry the envelope to the post office the next day - not the base post office either, the civilian one out in the town.  I also heard he liked fresh Thompson seedless grapes, served on a wooden tray while he went on sea trials of any new boat - and I understand he did go on the initial sea trials of any new boat - ""submarine"" in the parlance.

Good show, affects me more because I was ""there"" so to speak.",1464912000,,715,4.197080291970803

6729699,5,B00O9ZSK9A,"As a former Navy man,  I watched with great interest this absorbing account of the life of one of the most controversial figures in  naval history.
The program was amazingly comprehensive in charting the life of this man, who fled with his family from anti-Semitic oppression in his native Poland to the United States, in the first decade of the 20th century.  He arrived without being able to speak English, but his drive to succeed overcame that obstacle quickly.  He chose the Naval Academy because he was offered a free education.  Sadly,  anti-Semitism was the order of the day in the Navy,  with Rickover's page in the Academy yearbook being perforated, to allow it to be removed by other cadets who had a distaste for Jews!  Rickover struggled after graduation within the naval hierarchy, and only years later was given command of a rusty minesweeper.  Realizing that his career was not best directed at sea,  his brilliant engineering-based mind resulted in his directing general repair work for the Navy.  He was quickly recognized for his amazing ability to fix things others couldn't.  But,  promotions were constantly deferred, despite a strong record of accomplishment.  He volunteered towards the end of WWII to serve in the Pacific in a combat role, but before being relocated,  the war ended.  Sensing the potential of atomic energy to  provide a virtually limitless power source,  he relentlessly pursued the development of a ship-based nuclear reactor for a submarine, resulting in the deployment of the Nautilus in the early 1950's.  His accomplishment resulted in his being consulted to lead the development of the first commercial nuclear power plant in Shippingport, PA.  From information I learned from another interesting documentary,  it was Rickover's choice of reactor type that led to the promulgation of a design that produces a far larger quantity of nuclear waste than competitive configurations- an unfortunate situation that all of us now have to address. .

The program,, which uses dramatic recreations interspersed with documentary footage,  reveals the irascible nature of the man, even after he suffered a stroke.  His son was candid in acknowledging this significant character flaw.  Even Jimmy Carter, who was a member of Rickover's meticulously selected staff, noted he was a most demanding person,  but said he knew of no one more brilliant.  Rickover was totally intolerant of anything but perfection in his work, and demanded total dedication of his staff in achieving that goal.

All in all,  I could not recommend this program more highly, particularly to young people who may have little knowledge of this extraordinary figure.  They will learn much about the historical context of this period, and will appreciate what a determined, if not driven, individual can do to change our world.",1449100800,,2834,5.164835164835165
6729700,5,B00O9ZSK9A,"I had heard of Rickover before and the fact that he was abrupt, disrespectful of authority and completely contemptuous of any kind of mediocrity. The documentary highlighted those traits. I'm glad I never worked for him but am very grateful for his service and his dedication to engineering perfection. America is only the stronger for his efforts. Truly an unknown hero worthy of a better legacy.",1449100800,2,397,5.03030303030303

6729785,5,B00O9ZSK9A,"You will be both entertained and educated by this short PBS film describing the life of Admiral Rickover and how his personal fortitude proved even experts like Robert Oppenheimer (who stated nuclear subs were decades away wrong).  Rickover said he could do it in 4 years and delivered the Nautilus a little early.

Disliked by most Navy brass, Rickover played to Congress and they liked what they heard.  Over numerous objections, Rickover was put in charge of building the first civilian reactor which was a stunning success.  He testified before Congress whenever possible and was unafraid of telling off the brass, subcontractors, media people, and anyone else who he saw crossing his path.

The Navy Promotion Board tried time after time to forcibly retire Rickover and was overruled each time by Congress.  So Rickover got his stars which galled the Navy but pleased his fans.  Admiral Rickover was a one of a kind character and you may well find yourself at some points laughing out loud.  Enjoy the film. .",1446249600,,1014,4.923529411764706

Rickover was scary to a degree to a young, starting out in service directly from Iowa State, Ensign (ended Lt.) but very fair. Wife and I have several fun stories about his wanting his staff single as long as they could be (so he could expect as much as possible) and he was always very much of a gentleman to her. Also Capt. Anderson and crew gave a detailed lecture/story-report to in a conference room to the Admirals saff which is not mentioned but arranged by the Admiral and much appreciated.

I'm sure he was a difficult man to work for, but sometimes it takes men like that to get things done quickly (or at all).

6729834,4,B00O9ZSK9A,"I don't know much about Rickover besides what I saw in this documentary, so I can't speak to its accuracy. One thing that struck me as glaring  is that when they included quotes from his speeches, they showed him sitting at a desk in an office giving the speech, instead of standing in front of an audience. Very odd dramatic decision, but okay, probably a trivial point.

They had a number of re-enactments and quotes from people who knew him that depict him as screaming at people and making extreme demands. The film makers seem to be trying to portray this as ""aww, he was a quirky, eccentric guy"" when it came across to me more like he was rude and bullying. One quote could slip by where an associate says that when he talked to his subordinates he was rude and bullying, but when he talked to people from Congress and other big shots he was fawning and submissive. Interesting.

Of course the man was clearly a genius to accomplish what he did, and this film clearly shows his accomplishments and why they mattered.

Didn't talk much about his personal life. If he had a wife or kids or friends or any interests besides nuclear power, I don't recall them being mentioned. Maybe he had no outside interests. He was clearly a driven man.

All told it seemed like a fair portrayal of the man. Seemed a little biased to whitewashing his flaws, but didn't pretend they weren't there. And praised him where he deserved praise.",1444953600,,1427,4.536964980544747

The viewer is moved to endure collective guilt in Rickover's perception, and the producer's assertion that Rickover was hard done by because he was a Jew.  The documentary could well have done better without that sub story.  The dramatizations were inappropriately comic but archival film footage of Rickover showed him to be far from comical. Maybe it was just bad acting.  I think the documentary was a white wash of a very caustic yet competent man.",1440979200,,618,5.15

6729910,5,B00O9ZSK9A,Admiral Rickover asked questions fifty years ago that should embarrass leaders since that time with regard to relevant education for Americans.  He is a model for excellence and anyone who wants to think their way through life rather than accept conventional media dribble as to what this country is or should be.  He was able to move the Navy and nuclear power through harms way before the political class developed the lame self serving perpetual motion machine of dumb down that has infected this country for some 40 years.

6729930,5,B00O9ZSK9A,"This documentary is about as thorough as any documentary I've seen, especially when you consider Admiral Rickover wasn't a world leader.  What he was was a first-rate engineer who was the man who got the US to create a fleet of nuclear submarines.

He was not an easy man to work for -- he yelled at his underlings a lot, but he got things done.  He was sure they could make a workable, safe to operate, submarine that was powered by nuclear fission and his people managed that in only a few years.

This documentary draws on many sources, including several clips from ""60 Minutes"" about him and his work, many of those who knew and worked with him (including his widow and son, and President Jimmy Carter, who served under him).  There are clips of his meetings with Congress, who often saw to it that his work was funded when the Navy did not wish it.  They discuss the Cold War and why nuclear subs played a vital role in it.  Overall, it's very impressive!

I don't necessarily see him as being ""mean spirited"" as some had mentioned, I see him as someone with incredible focus who had no patience for appeasing people (when not necessary).
I have seen comments that state that anyone in the Navy or interested in the Navy, or interested in nuclear submarines should watch this movie. I would take this a step further and say that every American should watch this documentary or learn about this man.

6729977,3,B00O9ZSK9A,"The movie captured a lot of the Rickover persona and his unique perspectives on engineering. The writers didn't seem to have a clue about Naval ranks or uniforms though. There were some inadvertent chuckles spawned by that particular patch of cinematic oversight. For example, the film  depicted a young Jimmy Carter undergoing his ""trial by fire"" interview with Rickover well enough, but Carter was shown in the uniform of a full Navy Captain. The rank of US Navy Captain is equivalent to the rank of Colonel in the other US military services. Jimmy Carter was definitely not a Captain when he was applying to the Nuclear Power program. There were other narrative nitnoids attributable to the lack of knowledge about naval officer ranks but a non-military person wouldn't notice. Overall the film provided a more than passable introduction to the huge contributions of Admiral Rickover to the US Navy. The Admiral deserved his special place of honor due to his unrelenting dedication to the safe and reliable application of nuclear power to ships and other electric power generation systems. Without him, the adoption of nuclear based propulsion systems would likely have taken a far more tortuous path within the US Navy.",1437177600,6,1223,5.08457711442786

From his humble beginnings as an immigrant child within a poor Jewish family, he became an engineering genius that revolutionized U.S. strategic defense.

Truly, he was the right man at the right moment. The documentary does a great job in showing that. At the same time, though, the film's disjointed approach hurts it significantly. Things seem positively incoherent at times. Events jump around from one period of Rickover's life to another as the movie goes on. The film also flip-flops in an unhelpful way between fully reenacted scenes and situations described by interviewees as well as the narrator's recounting.
