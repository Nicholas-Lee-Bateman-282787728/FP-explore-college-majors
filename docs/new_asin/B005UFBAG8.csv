As a kid, this was one of my favorite western actors.
Great picture and sound quality.
I will be buying the complete collection.",1392681600,,180,4.484848484848484
4893811,4,B005UFBAG8,"The quality of the features and the audio are very good.  Also with each feature is an episode of the Melody Ranch radio program.  Being a baby boomer,it is enjoyable to sit back and watch the features from my younger days going to Saturday matinees.  All the Gene Autry collector series are well worth the price.",1386806400,2,313,4.553571428571429
4893812,3,B005UFBAG8,"In this 2-disc set we thoroughly enjoyed the first disc. The 2 movies melody Trail & The Big Show are delightful.  But, the second disc was a dissappointment as ,only one of the movies played.  Boots & Saddles played beautifully & is a good movie , but we couldn't play Rhythm of the Saddle.  It just kept flicking back to Boots & Saddles, I am wondering if this was a fault with all copies of this disc, or did we get a lemon.? It is too expensive to send the disc back , but, I would like to know if this is a one-off fault or does it apply to all those discs.  We would really like to get a copy of Rythm of the Saddle, but are afraid to risk buying it again.",1343347200,2,662,3.917910447761194
4893813,5,B005UFBAG8,It was great!!!!  hopefully they will bring out more of these.  Can hardly wait for volume 2 to be released.  Gene was great and it's a shame if they don't release more of these.,1327795200,3,178,4.176470588235294
4893814,1,B005UFBAG8,"I bought the set and was happy with Amazon's usual great service, but will not support anymore releases by Timeless Media and Gene Autry Entertainment as they put a bug on ""Melody Trail"" every 15 minutes.

I e-mailed Timeless and they claim piracy problems, well how about using a new anti-piracy prodcut called ""Macrovision?""  To make people who are not taping these films but spending their hard earned money have to have a product with a bug is ludicrous!",1326412800,10,458,4.784810126582278

8486802,4,B005UFBAG8,I love campy westerns and Gene Autry's westerns bring back great times as a child. These remastered westerns are fairly good quality most everyone who enjoys the genre will appreciate.,1453248000,,184,5.166666666666667

8486806,5,B005UFBAG8,"Be careful of some of the reviews for this Gene Autry Collection 1.  Some of them are not for this set at all, but for a Collection 1 from a different company and featuring ten movies......not the four movies on this set. These four movies are enjoyable Autry movies from the 1930s.  Some of them even feature Gene yodeling in one or more songs, as he did when he used to sing Jimmie Rodgers songs several years earlier.  ""The Big Show"" features Gene with future star, Roy Rogers.  In ""Boots and Saddles"", the villain is Gordon 'Wild Bill' Elliott just before becoming a star in his own right.

""Boots and Saddles"" especially is so long on comedy there is not much of the usual outlawry going on.  There is the big stagecoach race finale, so common in Republic westerns.

All in all, these movies are enjoyable and reproduced with excellent picture and sound quality.  Such a deal!",1403827200,,881,4.56687898089172
