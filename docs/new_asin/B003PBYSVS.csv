4164459,4,B003PBYSVS,"This is one of those movies I put on during the rainy days. I just sit back and enjoy the simple and fun 15 chapters.
It is a rare serial to find so if you collect I suggest you grab this one now. The transfer is not the best and I would say that no restoration was even attempted. But do not let that deter you from checking this out.
All of the leads are good and take thier roles seriously. Ray Crash Corrigan steals the serial as the ape. It is obvious that he was having a ball and adding little bits in every scene the ape is in.
The movie has all the trappings typical of serials. Hidden panels,captured heroines,special needed ingredients,villans in disguise and square jawed hero who seems to get beat up every chapter.
What more could you ask for? Great rainy day fun!",1308268800,,778,4.263513513513513
4164460,4,B003PBYSVS,"""The Monster and the Ape is a Columbia serial released in 1945, directed by Howard Bretherton.  Despite the title characters the story is treated fairly seriously, requiring less suspension of disbelief than with many serials from Columbia.

The so-called ""Monster"" is a robot, developed at Bainbridge Laboratories by Professor Franklin Arnold (Ralph Morgan) and Professor Ernst (George Macready) as a means freeing mankind from doing tiresome, repetitive and potentially hazardous tasks such as sitting through 15 chapters of a Columbia serial without going berserk.  Known as ""Metalogen Man"" after the rare material used in the control unit, the robot is demonstrated, first by lifting a large, empty cardboard box badly disguised as a block of granite -- it wobbles as the chains around it are grabbed, seen also in the chapter titles -- and then, in a curious application for a law-abiding robot, by pulling a bank vault door out of a mock-up wall.  But later, three of the lab's associates, Professors Ames, Marsden and Shaw, are mysteriously killed by a gorilla named Thor (Ray Corrigan).  Arnold tells Ernst that an engineer from the company planning to build the robots, Ken Morgan (Robert Lowery) is coming to move the prototype to a safe place, but Morgan is waylaid by a couple thugs, Joe Flint (Anthony Warde) and Dick Nordik (Jack Ingram) who steal his credentials.  Morgan is picked up by a car containing Professor Arnold, his daughter, Babs (Carole Mathews) and his chauffeur, Flash (Willie Best) who were looking for him.  They are not surprised that the robot has been stolen, but discover the hard way that Ernst is behind all the trouble.  Ernst has a lot more trouble to cause in his quest to control the world by robots, with many serial-movie hurdles to overcome such as finding more Metalogen, a problem also for our hero.

The robot, identified on the DVD package as being played by Ray Corrigan isn't badly done, though a little too human in shape and motion, and Corrigan's gorilla is familiar from several earlier serials.  The dual role is possible since, contrary to the cover art, the Ape never appears while the Metalogen Man is active.  As far as the plot allows, the acting is up to serial standards; Ralph Morgan and George Macready do quite well, and Robert Lowery is a reasonable hero most of the time.  He has one inexcusable sequence for a role model, in which he has entered a cabin looking for some stolen Metalogen, lights a cigarette, and then drops it, still burning, on the floor.  Smoking was still legal in 1945, but such careless behavior was expected only from the bad guys and he shows no other signs of being a nicotine fiend.  It looks like a creative shortfall in finding a source of ignition.  I wouldn't want to give away the plot, but there are a couple nearby drums marked ""Danger - Flammable"" and ""Explosive.""  Carole Mathews seems studious enough to be Professor Arnold's daughter, shows initiative in following clues and screams convincingly when required to do so.  Willie Best is mostly restricted to uninspired and racially stereotypical ""comic relief"" routines of the era, fortunately not too often.  Still, he proves in the next to last chapter that unlike his captors he has something other than sawdust for brains, and he was one of the five actors who received screen credit.  Use of two ""creatures"" helps propel the action, and while it might be wondered why Ernst's supposedly-abandoned house isn't guarded more closely, his hidden tunnels are a nice touch, clever enough to fool most serial-movie heroes.  The cliffhangers have a few minor ""cheats"" where the hero gets burned to a crisp in a brickyard furnace or is squashed flat by a giant boulder, only to be shown at the start of the next chapter rolling out of the way in the nick of time; nothing unusual.  Forgetting cliffhanger details is one reason why these are supposed to be watched with time between the chapters.  As for the activities of the Ape, the cover art on Cheezy's DVD appears to be of an actual movie poster with the tag lines ""A Thrilling 15-chapter serial of a mechanical monster GONE MAD!"" and ""His companion...the ape that fights crime...in a wonderful fantasy!""  Apparently, Columbia's marketing people were in a wonderful fantasy of their own, having never watched the film they were advertising.

Cheezy Flicks' edition, number 10-007, is on two DVD's.  In most chapters the print is clear enough and in fairly good condition, but no extensive restoration has been done.  Chapter 3 is badly scratched, in a band covering about a quarter of the frame width all the way through.  The other chapters are much better; the image is a little unsharp and mildly muddy, not ""from the original negative"" quality but reasonably good.  There are a few splices and some dirt, fairly minor defects.  The transfer to DVD is fine, the only obvious videotape artifact is the normal head-switching blip a few lines above the bottom of the frame, usually off-screen.  The sound is loud and clear, if occasionaly with a little noise, and mild low-frequency distortion common in 1940's Columbia serials.  The package advertises an ""original theatrical trailer"" and it is present, but following the last chapter and not indexed.  The picture quality of the trailer isn't very good, looking a bit faded, and is from ""A Columbia Reprint"" but at least it is authentic.

So while not an outstanding serial, it has entertainment value, proceeds with more logic than many and given the poor representation of Columbia's serials it is good to have it on DVD.  The transfer is good enough, and for two discs, the price is reasonable.",1284854400,15,5655,4.8930817610062896
4164461,3,B003PBYSVS,"Three stars is based on the portion of the movie I watched. I purchased this movie serial in the first release. I love movie serials and enjoyed this one up to the point where I reached the end of chapter nine and realized there was no second disc. The second disc was not included and it wasn't even a two disc case.
Perhaps this second release (if that's what it is) is a correction of this error. I returned the DVD for a refund and would like this movie in my collection but I'm leery of buying it a second time if the whole movie isn't there. I don't see that this problem is addressed anywhere by Amazon.
Apart from this major snafu, the movie itself was enjoyable, being fairly typical for serials of the 1940's. If you're familiar with serials, you'll know there is always a cliff-hanger ending of each chapter to be resolved in the next. Be aware that the movie cheats the ""escapes"" more blatantly than most. Not a problem for fans, but it's a groaner for the casual viewer. The video quality is only fair to be charitable being murky with some scratching.
All this would have been acceptable IF I HAD GOTTEN BOTH DISCS!",1276819200,16,1129,4.4066985645933014
4164462,3,B003PBYSVS,"(This is the review I posted on the first Amazon listing of this item) This is a fun serial. Not a great one like ""Daredevils of the Red Circle"" or ""Spy Smasher"" (or many others), but a fun one--and kinda goofy. While I haven't seen this particular release yet, I'm hoping it really is a new transfer of the film--'cause I'll definitely buy it if it is. BUT! If it's just a burned copy of one of the fan-quality copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy videos floating around the 'trading' network, then it's way, way, waaaaay over priced and you'd be better off buying one of the bootlegs offered on that auction site. And the cover blurb is willfully mis-leading: The ape is NOT the robot's companion and it does NOT fight crime.
I also find it interesting that this item now has two Amazon listings when (apparently) the only difference is that the release date was changed to July 27, 2010. You'd think they'd just update the existing listing instead of adding a second which kinda makes it seem as though someone's trying to make it look like a different release--but I don't know.",1276560000,3,1070,4.636842105263158

8401938,1,B003PBYSVS,"Since this is the only release, I still recommend getting it, if you want to own it. If you collect serials, be aware Cheezy Flicks releases will never be as good as VCI, Alpha, Grapevine, Olive Films, etc. They don't seem to care about the final release, or take pride in doing things correctly.

The print on this one is mediocre at best. Chapter 3 is damaged on the right side for the entire showing. The rest of the chapters all have a dark line down the right side of the screen about an inch and a half from the edge.

As is customary with Cheezy Flicks, they don't even take the time, or even care to spell the chapters correctly. Chapter 14 they misspelled ""flight"" as ""fight"", and in chapter 15 they misspelled ""triumphs"" as ""triumps"". They also listed the run time incorrectly. They claim it's 7.5 hours, when in reality it's approximately 5 hours and 20 minutes. This error is listed both on the product page and the actual packaging. It's just painfully amateurish and unprofessional.

I contacted them regarding King of the Rocket Men, and the fact almost all the titles were either spelled wrong, completely wrong, out of order, or all three, and they replied with the below email. Avoid these releases from Cheezy Flicks, unless they're the only option.

Disc seems in good condition,no skips,pops or other interference. Highly recommend this Cheezy Video. The ape is kinda obviously not real,the robot kinda clunky,but the actors are fun. Incredible our hero is in so many slugfests and still manages to get up for the bell.

8401943,5,B003PBYSVS,"The Monster and the Ape:  This is one of the lamest, slowest serials Ive ever seenand Ive seen several of the crusty, old Mascot serials from the early 1930sbut if you're a serial completest such as myself, youll be glad its even available on DVD.  And be forewarned, this serial contains some of the worst cheats ever!  As other reviewers have pointed out, the quality of the print is somewhat lacking, with noticeable audio and video imperfections that range from mostly clear to somewhat serviceable scattered throughout the 15 chapters.  Of the 12 serials that Cheezy Flicks has released to date, this one is by far the poorest in terms of quality, but thats not really a good indicator for comparisons sake considering how excellent most of their other serials are.  All in all, its totally watchable and recommended to serial enthusiasts.

FYI, I bought this from Cheezy Distribution via Amazon along with several other titles because they offered the best price, and they refunded me more than 90% of the system-generated per-title shipping costs, only charging me what it actually cost to ship the DVDs.  For the volume of titles I bought, purchasing them at a lower price from Cheezy and paying only five bucks to ship the lot was a far better deal than buying the DVDs at a higher list price from Amazon to get the free-shipping-over-$35 deal.",1433894400,,1353,4.8311688311688314
8401944,4,B003PBYSVS,"In this entertaining, fast-paced, above average serial,  Professor Arnold and his four colleagues have invented a powerful, but clunky robot.  It is not autonomous - it acts only upon receipt of commands transmitted from a control unit.  As limited as the robot is, a company wants to manufacturer them and sends engineer Ken Morgan to make arrangements, but before Morgan can meet Arnold, three of the inventors are murdered and the robot and its control unit have been stolen.

Eventually Arnold learns who is behind these dastardly deeds and retrieves the robot, but unfortunately its critical metalogen disc is missing - without it, the robot will not work.  The disc contains a very rare, mysterious metal only obtained from meteorites.

Beneath all of the various story lines, fist fights, and cliffhangers, the fundamental driver for these actions is the need to find additional supplies of metalogen in order to manufacture these robots . . . either for good . . . or for evil. . . .

Cliffhanger escapes: mundane.  In all cases, Mr. Morgan escapes by luck.  The most unusual of the dangers he'll face is a machine throwing out arcs of electricity - Morgan is pushed into a pit beneath the machine, which then erupts in a spray of sparks.  How does he survive?  I am not telling. . . .

Extras:  ""Other Cheezy Flicks"" (film trailers) and ""Intermission Time"" (clips from drive-in theater intermissions).

DVD - 2010.  Picture: good, but worn.  The black & white picture has low contrast, occasional flecking, and several vertical light and dark scratches in Chapter 3.  There is obvious cropping on the right side (most noticeable when it shows newspaper headlines) but otherwise not a problem.  Sound volume normal, clear.  Subtitles: none.",1425686400,,1748,4.9655172413793105
8401945,4,B003PBYSVS,"A much fun old Columbia serial from 1945 with the great George Macready done up decently by Cheezy Flicks DVD.  Good ol' Crash Corrigan and his gorilla suit get a workout here as does the mean looking robot from evil genius George Macready as they attempt to rob, kill, whatever to the top of the atomic heap!!!  Don't expect to make sense of things-- just enjoy!!!",1417651200,,365,4.515151515151516
8401946,4,B003PBYSVS,"The serial is how I remember it. My comments are directed to the dvd itself. I read bad reviews about bad transfers (audio, video, and technical problems) from CHEEZYFLICKS for at least 2 years. I really appreciate user reviews and feedback because it is so helpful. Finally because the price was right I purchased KING OF THE ROCKETMEN and THE MONSTER AND THE APE. I was very surprised and pleased with the quality (audio and video) of both features. Much better than I expected. There was a one minute replay of a scene in KING and that was all. (which was fine for me) I have not finished The Metalogen Man serial yet but the appearance is very good so far. I still watch vhs tapes (most of my serials at least 40) so I am accustomed to viewing imperfections and these dvds are on a par with the better quality vhs sources from the studios (COLUMBIA, REPUBLIC. etc.).",1380499200,4,870,4.477987421383648
8401947,5,B003PBYSVS,"This cheesy item is the best as far as so bad its good along with Teenagers From Outer Space and Robot Monster.  I'm sure I would like Plan 9 From Outer Space except that I don't watch stuff with vampires.  But using plates for flying saucers in that movie definitely typifies what is so bad it's good.  It's kind of like Teenagers From Outer Space in that I found the plot was actually decent and some elements that actually are good in it, but it definitely had some so bad it's good stuff.  Good for its time period.  The ""young good guy"" lead role here is played by the actor who was Batman in the '49 Batman and Robin serial.  One of the villains who was played by Anthony Warde was the leader of the Forest People in Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars and I liked him in both roles.  Interestingly, the villain who was in The Phantom who was uncredited in that one is the Police Inspector in a few chapters in this one.  All of these serials I am mentioning here are normal serials that are not so bad that they are good.  I would say that Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars is one of the three best serials, in fact but it is the second of the Flash Gordon trilogy so not a good starting point.  Actually, Anthony Warde was in the Buck Rogers serial as the bad buy and that was my starting point into serials and would be the good one to start good serials with.  Enjoy!",1366329600,,1363,4.16412213740458
