8529434,4,B008P76W5C,"Another very rare Rossini opera getting a full staging and excellent filming by the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, is certainly worth having and exploring.  Here the work is ""Sigismondo"", written and first performed in 1814, and just about never revived as a complete work again.  BUT, as was often the case, much of the music was recycled into later operas.

First, the opera itself.  The libretto is a very unsatisfying story wherein, 15 years prior to the opening of the opera, Prince Sigismondo, believing the false tale of his minister Ladislao that his wife Aldimira was unfaithful, sentenced her to death, and believed that she had, in fact, been executed.  But, this being opera, she was rescued and cared for by her Uncle Zenovito, disguising her as Eldira.  Over the past 15 years, Sigismondo has lamented her faithlessness and his execution of his wife, and has slipped into madness.  Now, Aldimira, with the help of her Uncle, returns and recaptures the heart and love of Sigismondo, for the happy ending.

The story is ludicrous and unconvincing, which is why it has lain dormant for almost 200 years, rarely performed at all.  But, the music is an excellent set of arias, duets, and ensemble/chorus  pieces that are uniformly excellent and flow MUCH better than the story.  So enjoy the music, and don't pay too much attention to the plot.

The singers are all very good to excellent.  But I must single out the lovely Olga Peretyatko as Aldimira for her gorgeous coloratura and emotional singing.  She really hits the notes, and the acting just great.  (One note- my wife and I both felt that in her looks AND her mannerisms, she reminded us of the young Anna Netrebko- another Russian singer of great acclaim.)

The staging is divided into two parts- the first act is in an insane asylum, and the second in Sigismondo's palace.  (I noticed that the palace set was almost identical to the asylum set, but the asylum set was all in white.  I think there is a subtle message here.)  There were ghostly doppelgangers of Aldimira and assorted asylum inmates floating around the set.  All quite effective and NOT disruptive of the story or especially the singing.

Being unfamiliar with this opera, as most opera fans are, you can play a little game of ""Spot that Tune"" while watching the show.  There are quite a few bits of music (including orchestral background as well as parts of arias) that were re-used in ""Barbiere"", ""Cenerentola"", ""Elizabetta"", and others.  And, of course, it contains all the classic Rossini musical touches- crescendoes,  double arias, grand duets, moments of stasis before the presto finale, etc.  All just musically delightful.

On the technical side, the filming and sound of the performance were excellent.  There was a 20 minute ""Making of"" documentary with interesting comments by the conductor, director, and Alberto Zedda, the head of the Rossini Festival.  There is no question that Pesaro has really upped its game in this and other recent releases.  (I am expecting there performance of ""Ciro in Babylonia"" this past summer to be released later this year.)",1361059200,5,3108,4.911708253358925
8529435,5,B008P76W5C,"Updating an opera and setting it in an asylum isn't a terribly original idea and it does usually have a sense of desperation about it, but there is of course a tradition of mad scenes in bel canto opera, so it's not necessarily inappropriate.  All the more so since Rossini's rarely heard 1814 opera Sigismondo actually opens with a mad scene of sorts rather than builds up to one, where Sigismondo, the king of Poland, is still tormented by the loss of his wife Aldimira, who he had executed 15 years ago on account of accusations of infidelity that had been laid against her.  Sigismondo belongs in this respect to another traditional opera theme then, that of innocent women unjustly accused of infidelity or having their maidenly honour called into question by a jealous admirer who has had his advances rejected.  Starting the way it does however, already wading in the depths of madness, Rossini's Sigismondo would seem to have other ambitions towards a psychological drama more closely aligned to Desdemona in Shakespeare's Othello - worked into an opera of course not just by Verdi but by Rossini himself soon after Sigismondo - and to the medieval legend of the saint Genoveva, the subject of Schumann's only opera.

As presented at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro in 2010, there's certainly a belief here that Sigismondo is worthy of more serious consideration and treatment.  I'm not sure that the music or Giuseppe Foppa's libretto are always strong enough to bear that kind of psychological probing, but the opera is certainly more experimental in its arrangements than some of Rossini's earlier work and it does indeed build up to a forceful expression of the situation in an impressive series of arias, duets and ensembles in the distinctly Mozartian Second Act.  The asylum setting for the First Act however is a powerful reflection of the state of Sigismondo's mind and there are other effective touches that bear this out, such as the three identical Aldimiras who torment both Sigismondo and Ladislao (the scheming First Minister who has betrayed and denounced the former Queen after being rejected by her), and the appearance of other asylum inmates who, since they all carry over into the palatial Stateroom of the Second Act, are clearly intended to be representations of the mindsets of the characters rather than actual figures.

The sense of ghostly apparitions haunting the characters also works well within the context of the drama, since (probably no surprise to opera-goers here) Aldimira is not actually dead, but having been rescued from her unjust fate 15 years ago, returns in the guise of Egelinda, the daughter of the noble Zenovito.  If the plot inevitably slips into high melodrama with her reappearance, the staging does manage to show that there are powerful feelings expressed with considerable skill by Rossini in this near-forgotten work.  At the very least Sigismondo gives the singers the opportunity to really shine if they are up to it, and fortunately they're all exceptionally good here.  As Sigismondo, mezzo-soprano Daniela Barcellona (yes, it's a trouser role) brings a brooding intensity that underplays the potential for raving melodrama, her vocal expression of the king's torment alone powerfully emotive, particularly - as it should be - in the king's direct encounters with Egelinda/Aldimira.  As Aldimira, Olga Peretyatko's rich, dark soprano suits the nature of her character's steely determination to resist the injustice of her fate.  It's not a coloratura role, but there are certainly vocal demands, and she handles them more than capably, working particularly well in the duets with Barcellona.  It's the high tenor role of Ladislao however that has some of the more coloratura arias and these are also sung well by Antonino Siragusa.

It's tremendous then to have the opportunity to see this work - and many others like it - revived by the Rossini Opera Festival and now being made available on DVD and Blu-ray.  It's particularly interesting to see these works being given the best possible representation in terms of musical performance and staging.  Despite the faith of the Pesaro team however, I don't think Sigismondo is a 5-star Rossini opera by any means, but this is certainly a 5-star production of an interesting work that, preceding and prefiguring Rossini's Neapolitan period, merits the effort and the commitment put into its revival here.  It's well filmed and recorded, looking and sounding very good in High Definition on the Blu-ray release.  It's mostly filmed 'straight', but the director does use split-screen effects a few times, although only for a few occasions of ensemble singing where it's actually good to be able to see all the performers.  Discreet radio mics are also used by the cast, but the sound and mixing sounds natural in both the PCM stereo and the upfront DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 tracks.  The Blu-ray is all-region compatible and contains subtitles in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish, Japanese and Korean.",1346803200,29,5025,5.097442143727162
