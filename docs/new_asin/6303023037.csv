533094,4,6303023037,"This movie reminded me of an American movie called ""Monster"".  Monster gave Charlize Theron a chance to act without the burden of being beautiful, and to an extent, this movie did the same for Gong Li.  But whereas Theron was completely de-fanged of her beauty by the Monster make-up crew, Gong Li just wore really dumpy clothing and was either pregnant or wore one of those pregnancy stomachs, so there were still flashes and glimpses of beauty here and there.

My favorite aspect of the movie was how understated everybody was.  There was a minimal amount of yelling and screaming.  Gong Li showed her extreme will and determination by jutting out here jaw and staring off into space and initiating another journey whenever a setback occurred.  The way she played this particular character just seemed, for lack of a better phrase, spot on.  Like if some quiet impoverished stubborn rural woman in China was trying to get justice for what happened to her husband, Gong Li to me acted the way such a woman would in real life.  The movie wasn't killer funny, but it had its moments.",1449187200,3,1082,4.718085106382978

But it was so realistic that it was hard to see the players as actors; they looked & acted just like normal citizens. It also portrayed the convoluted and almost comical justice system of China. My interest was in the star, Gong Li. I saw her in Miami Vice as the jaded and very sexy drug dealer.

533103,5,6303023037,"Like THE ROAD HOME and HOUSE OF THE FLYING DAGGERS after it, THE STORY OF QIU JU gets the audience lost in the story at the first moment. (The moment in this case being the title character's concern for her husband and the reason why she's so determined.) You also get a look at everyday China at the time, the working class view.

The village chief's arrogant behavior reminds us of what middle and working class residents have to put up with from landlords and other authority figures. Same with the justice system and how it frequently fails at its primary duty to the people.

Anyway, throughout the film Qiu Ju seeks out an apology from the Chief, and reacts the way any of us would when she doesn't get it: seek justice via the authorities. Even pregnancy, shortage of chili supply, and having to go through layers of the system don't make her quit. Then during her climactic labor (birth-giving), the chief shows his good side by helping her through it. She, of course, is grateful. And she (and we the audience) has forgotten about the assault charges until word of the chief's arrest comes up. The closing shots say that sometimes when you get what want, it is not what it's cracked up to be. Sometimes when you win, you actually lose.

The work of cast and crew is priceless. Everyone did their part the way it should. Gong Li's performance just happens to stand out, as she carries the film as the title figure. Again, THE STORY OF QIU JU looks at daily life and trials in the eyes of middle and working class people, in and out of China--and in an honest, non-fabricated manner. Plus, there is good and bad in everyone (as shown by the village chief); it's not like ""good in one, bad in another"".

THE STORY OF QIU JU. See it again and again, and it'll never get old, cliche, or any less relevant. Not ever.",1405468800,,1819,4.453453453453453

I usually enjoy foreign films and I enjoy thought-provoking films not action films.
I loved ""To Live"" and enjoyed ""Ermo"" but I found this film dull as can be.

The premise of the film is that a young woman's husband is kicked in the crotch by the local village chief for a perceived insult. The young wife protests that the chief was in the wrong and takes this grievance to higher and higher levels of Chinese bureaucracy.

Personally, I feel the message of this film is that the Chinese government is very caring and is concerned about the lot of its most vulnerable people and that, moreover, the government is composed of very wise and uncorruptible men. I personally am rather skeptical!

Last night we played it for the first time for some house guests. What a mess. From nearly the first frame it skipped and froze continually. Large sections of the story just disappeared in a flash....It was so bad one could not follow the plot, even though I had seen it before.
Then, two thirds of the way through, the thing just quit altogether.

533150,5,6303023037,"""The Story of Qiu Ju"" features a very recognizable cultural stock figure.  Gong Li plays the wife of a man who has been injured by a local official.  While they are offered a small settlement, Qiu Ju refuses to accept it and so, basically, takes on the system.  This is Silkwood or Phillip Seymour Hoffman taking on the tobacco industry or Mr. Smith in Washington or on and on and on.  We all know this character, the plucky underdog who refuses to give up and who, through grit and determination and with an unshakeable conviction in the rightness of their cause fight overwhelming odds, never giving up until finally, at the very end, truth and justice triumph.  The faceless bureaucrats lose and our hero carries the day.  But this movie was made in China.  They also know this character but they view this person in a completely different light.  In Chinese society this person is ""The Troublemaker.""  They don't know when to stop.  They don't recognize the good that people are trying to do them.  They don't appreciate the positions of others.  In ""The Story of Qiu Ju,"" the progressively more important officials that take time out of their busy schedules to hear out Qiu Ju are portrayed sympathetically.  They listen.  They want to help.  They extend themselves (one of the highest actually squires Qiu Ju around in his limo, helping her find her way in an unfamiliar city.)  In the end, and I don't want to give away too much, Qiu Ju herself is made to confront the fundamental error of her ways and she profoundly regrets the trouble she has caused.  I watched this movie with my wife, who is Chinese and at a certain point we both knew how the movie was going to end: I was shocked and she was bored.  Enjoy it.",1260230400,2,1723,4.55700325732899

533152,5,6303023037,"Of this Movie, Janet Mason from The New York Times says, ""SUPERB...The story of Qiu Ju reaffirms Zhang Yimou's stature as a story teller and visual artist of exceptional delicacy and insight"". International film sensation GONG LI (Memoirs of a Geisha) gives a luminous performance as Qiu Ju, a stoic peasant woman who demands an apology when her husband is humiliated by the village Chief. But the Chief is a headstrong man who refuses to apologise, sending Qiu Ju on a futile trek through the complicated Chinese judicial system. From her small village, to a nearby city and finally  to the large and impersonal district court, hers is a universal battle against bureaucracy and indifference. Winner of Best Picture and Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival, THE STORY OF QIU JU is ""funny, touching, surprising, provocative and entertaining every step of the way"".-David Sterritt, The Christian Science Monitor.",1258588800,,915,5.140939597315437
533153,5,6303023037,"I have been impressed by all the films that I have seen directed by Zhang Yimou.  In his films I not only have learned a great deal about China but have also been reminded or instructed about universal truths.

""The Story of Qiu Ju"" brings the viewer into rural China and the perspective of a farming and tradition-minded populace interacting with Communist governance, including the limitations on child-bearing, the police and legal system, and the new, growing urban culture.  I have a richer and I suspect accurate impression of China as a result of Zhang Yimou's intelligent artistry.

Alongside this almost documentary-like (yet superior to any documentary I can think of) portrayal of contemporary China, the director also presents a deeply moving and instructive account of the consequences of harmful human behaviors, behaviors that most of us (all of us?) indulge in frequently with little thought to the pain we are causing those around us.  In Qui Ju the circumstances are comic and would remain so did we not see how sadly they play out at the film's end.  A refusal by the village leader to apologize for hurting a man coupled with an equally stubborn refusal by the man's wife Qiu Ju to let go of her grievance bears bitter fruit for all concerned.

It is not the stuff of major tragedy but rather the expression of real, every day minor tragedies that makes ""The Story of Qiu Ju"" so poignant and powerful.  See this film to learn more about China, but see it also to get a fresh vision of the sorrow of missed opportunities when people fail to forgive.",1256342400,2,1568,4.738970588235294

533189,5,6303023037,"The story is well told in many of the other reviews--Qiu Ju's husband has taunted the village chief who retaliated and kicked her husband in the groin and ribs.  She is a peasant who undertakes a quest through the Chinese system of officials and courts, from village to city, seeking to compel the village chief to apologize.  He turns out not to be a bad man, and most of the people--including the officials--are good people throughout the movie.  There are many realistic pictures of people and village and city life in northwest China, and the story is compelling and interesting. What would be justice for this case?  How does ""losing face"" affect these people?  Is she right to do what she is doing? Unlike other reviewers, I was actually impressed with the quality of the justice system as portrayed, and her rights and ability to pursue one appeal after another, coupled with the practical nature of the remedies ordered by the officials and judges.  There are some real twists at the end, as the viewer bounces from one surprise to another. The ending will make you think about Qiu Ju and this movie for a long time--it was already a great movie before the ending.  Gong Li is a great actress, and Yimou Zhong is a great director.  I now plan to see all their movies.  This one also has humour--you will really be amused by the scene following where the peasants are told to dress like city people so as to avoid being the targets of criminals.

Gong is such a beauty yet she plays it so close to the heart as a peasant farm girl here. Her actions are deeply thought out and utterly natural in execution. I was marveling at this woman's talent. She's now at the very pinnacle of her profession in China and it is so easy to see why even in this early effort.

533191,4,6303023037,"This may be one of the best films ever made about the law, perfectly illustrating those first-year law school lessons that not every wrong amounts to a legal cause of action (i.e., merits a lawsuit) and that justice does not belong to the wronged individual, but to society as a whole. The law will always fail to satisy a personal sense of having been wronged. In this film, a woman feels slighted by an assault on her husband (a vicious kick in the nuts), and she spends the rest of the film pursuing ""justice"" in the form of an apology from the perpetrator, the local village administrator. The woman just happens to be Chinese, but the subsquent truths about the legal process are nigh universal. The village head is simply unwilling to acknowledge his fault, so various attempts to settle the dispute or find compromise are not enough to satisfy the woman, and she sets the wheels of legal procedure in motion, following them through to their ultimately unsatifsying conclusion as she travels to district and provincial capital cities. The resulting film, as an exercise in frustration, is as essential an addition to the ""literature"" of the law as Dickens' Bleak House or Trollope's Orley Farm, and should be on the curriculum of every law school.  (And a final note: I have never before or since been as impressed by actress Gong Li, who commands the screen by allowing her usual glamourous presence to be utterly subsumed into the character of a pregnant peasant woman. That she still stands out in one crowd scene just by sheer force of her pesonality is a testament to a charisma that, I admit, eluded me in many of her other films.)",1233532800,3,1643,4.704861111111111

When I first saw it, I thought the story was funny, quirky and well acted, especially by Gong Li.  Now that I have been to China several times (not in tour groups) and have had a chance to see some of rural China shown my by my new Chinese friends, I can appreciate how well Zhang Yimou has portrayed both the rural countryside and the bureaucracy that runs China today.  It seems that everywhere you go in China today, there are large numbers of people in uniforms acting official.  In many cases I had no idea what their duties were.  In this film the government offices always seem full of people petitioning the government for something, just as is Qiu Ju.  Gong's portrayal of her is so laid back and unglamorous that she seems very real.  I credit her acting skills with carrying the part off so well,so far as it is from her normal roles.  This film makes you laugh a lot, but also just stare in wonder as the Chinese countryside and cities roll out before Qiu Ju- and you.  The wonderful repetition of the bicycle ride out of her village on every new trip is a great image, the equivalent of saying ""here we go again!""

I understood the point the movie set out to make, it isn't a deep one. That's part of the whole issue with me...the movie is practically a documentary and moves slowly and methodically towards its stupor awakening surprise ending. The study of China is fascinating to be sure and I get the human side of the story. However, I found myself getting frustrated that so little was happening and that the title character was so maddeningly stubborn. Oddly enough, I dreamt of the movie all night long and was amazed at how it had crept into my subconscious so deeply.
On the plus side, the performances are perfect and the travel documentary of China, from the pristine snowy farms to the bustling gray and indifferent city is worth watching.

A five star cinema experience",1176768000,,247,4.369565217391305
533260,5,6303023037,"I have to be honest. When I read the Amazon mini-review of this film, I was doubtful as to whether or not this would be my type of film. I'm not even sure why but I just had a feeling. Well, all of my fears quickly dissipated within the first fifteen minutes or so. I quickly became engrossed in this wry little comedy-drama import. Lurking within the guise of a simple drama is a carefully sculpted story of one woman's single-minded mission to acquire satisfaction and justice on behalf of her injured husband.

Let me give you a little background first. The film opens with a very pregnant Qiu Ju (played by the brilliant Gong Li) pulling some sort of wagon into town. As it turns out, Qiu Ju (with the help of her sister-in-law, Meizi) is transporting her injured husband, Qinglai to the local doctor for emergency treatment. It is eventually revealed that the husband has suffered an embarrassing injury to his ""oh so private area"" as a result of an argument culminating in an well-placed kick from the village chieftain. Conflict immediately arises from the fact that she sees her husband as being injured, not only physically but, emotionally and spiritually as well. Her laid-back husband, on the other hand, is not as wounded as Qiu Ju would care to believe. He's happier to just move on and let bygones be bygones. This is unsatisfactory for wife, Qiu Ju who proceeds to set into motion an almost comedic series of events ultimately leading to a conclusion that she never anticipated. On its most basic level, this film is a modern day parable that explores the gray area between seeking justice and exacting revenge. It is a cautionary tale as well since it shows that justice is not an absolute. In fact, justice can be a somewhat intangible concept - something that needs to be defined by the human experience. In other words, one person's injustice can be another person's justice. Unfortunately, Qiu Ju lives in a world of black and white. Her simple life and simplistic approach to life affords her no latitude in this matter. As she gradually escalates her grievance upwardly from village, to town, to district, all the way to the big city, her black and white world becomes increasingly grayer. Although her intentions are pure at heart, she fails to see the shortsightedness of her actions. Her myopic view of the world ultimately leads to her downfall. What I find fascinating about this is director Zhang Yimou's ability to tell such a seemingly tragic tale within the framework of a comedy. He does this by telling the story in a most gentle fashion with the most delicate of narrative style.

Along the way, the viewer is rewarded with a glimpse into the ever-changing face of mainland China. As Qiu Ju travels from station to station we see the socioeconomic strata of China laid bare as if it were an archeological expedition. I immediately grasped the notion that the heart of China lay in its people. China's true legacy is not The Great Wall nor the Forbidden City. Rather, it is its people and I think this was the intent of the director. Throughout the film, Qiu Ju seems as if she were awash in a sea of humanity. At times, it seems comforting and at others ... frightening. Nonetheless, she moves forward in her mission undeterred. I also think that it was the intent of the director to expose the daunting bureaucratic nightmare that is the Chinese government. A draconian government that has lost sight of the very people that it is meant to serve. So, in a way, the film is an amalgam of comedy, drama and political satire.

The tempo of the film is deliberatly slow-paced not unlike Qiu Ju herself. I have a feeling that her brain also processes her experiences at the same exacting rate. The performances are genuine with much attention given to the dialogue. We see that although the Village Chief is in the wrong, he's really not a bad guy. He's stubborn, proud and indignant. We see that although the husband has been wronged, he's not entirely innocent either and must bear some responsibility for what has happened. That is, if he hadn't said what he had said to the Village Chief ... maybe none of this would've happened. This is what simple Qiu Ju fails to understand. People and situations cannot always be easily classified as either ""right"" or ""wrong"". Life is unfortunately more complex and convoluted than she would be willing to accept. As noble as it might seem to hold steadfastly to an ideal, the greater good sometimes arises from recognizing and accepting our own imperfect condition. The film is full of good people, bad people and a lot of people in-between. Although the film takes place in China, there is a sense that it could be just about anywhere in the world since the struggles contained within are so universal in nature. Zhang Yimou is very good at conveying the notion that people are the same wherever you go. I believe that and I think that is why I was so immediately drawn into this story. The film ends with a most poignant moment of self-realitization for Qiu Ju. In keeping within the framework of a parable, sweet Qiu Ju, while so intent on teaching society a lesson ends up being the one who is taught a lesson ... and a very important one at that. I could tell you what it is but, you would be better served by seeing for yourself!",1159142400,35,5309,4.645744680851064

Whether you support the quixotic quest of Qiu Ju and her sidekick Meizi (translation: younger sister) or not you will fall in love with the sincerity, purity and simplicity of their hearts.  These qualities (among others) that endear so many of the real people whom we (""foreigners""/non-Chinese) meet, while living in the People's Republic of China, to us are represented with amazing clarity and realism.  The story and plotline are very (almost too) simple; but the character development, and presentation of village, city, and district politics in China and the vast differences between people's lives in those settings is so interesting and intriguing that the movie will keep you amused, interested, and excited, and have you wishing to see more as the credits start rolling at the end of the movie.  This was one of the few movies that actually had me feeling as though I was back in China among so many wonderful friends, sights, and smells, and re-experiencing the oddly comfortable sense of chronic culture shock.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who truly wants to better understand our brothers' and sisters' situations in China and to have your heart and mind opened and broadened.  The movie is spoken in the Shaanxi dialect of Chinese (although I could understand much of it with my limited fluency in Mandarin) and subtitled in English.  Even though it is really a drama many of the comical and sweet interpersonal situations in this movie will have you laughing out loud as you learn to see into the hearts of the characters and look upon the vast cultural differences with more respect, compassion, and understanding.

533263,5,6303023037,"This intensely political and humane film, which I'd characterize as a dark tragedy,  shows how strong Chinese women really are. Although males are more in demand in this China of 1992 - and still apparently are - it is the female heroine, played to perfection by Chinese star Gong Li (""the most purely beautiful woman in the movies,"" according to Vanity Fair) who has more power than anyone, including her poor husband whose honor she is trying - but failing  - to restore. Even he is shocked by her staunch devotion to justice.

Director Zhang Yimou constructs the Chinese landscape with opulence and tenderness. Rich colors strike us, reminding us of the colorless society under Chairman Mao.  The vibrant reds of the chili peppers, grown by the heroine and her husband, portend blood that will come later.

I was surprised that this film, critical of the Chinese bureaucracy and the government, was allowed to be made.

This is a film that does not end neatly, but ends with a question. I won't give the plot away but the final scene is worth rewinding a couple of times on the 1993 video. The last shot is a masterpiece which will long linger with the viewer. To me, that's the sign of a stunning film: a great beginning and a great ending.",1149120000,3,1244,4.631818181818182
533264,5,6303023037,"Qiu Ju is a very simple, well-paced story. And Zhang Yimou tells it gorgeously.

The plot features a pregnant woman who decides to seek redress after her husband is kicked in the groin after an argument gets out of control between him, a humble chili farmer, and the local village ""mayor"" (the village here being a tiny rural community in Shaanxi province: think Yellow Earth) over his plan to construct some sort of building on his allotted plot.  While both parties are initially bitter over the confontation, they each in their own small way concede their responsibilities in allowing the situation to get out of hand, and their mutual hostilities eventually subside as they both fully realize that it is their fate to coexist together in an extremely isolated social world.

Qiu Ju, played by Gong Li, however decides that no attempt at redress is enough to satisfy her conception of justice--and what later on seems more ambiguously to lapse into a naively quixotic quest motivated both by vengeance and stubborn pride.

Her obsession with justice, and her inability to accept its reality in early 90's China:  the amicable resolution of conflict leading to the reestablishment of social harmony, and thus the affirmation of the status quo--leads her, a dirt-poor ""country"" woman to seek redress at increasingly higher levels of government. Qiu Ju's hope is for an investigation which thoroughly examines her ""case"" in the search for Truth, regardless of compensation.  And this film in its own masterful way is the depiction of a ""noble"" ideal steadfast pursued, beginning as something heroic and ending up as something miserably petty and banal when pursued in ignorant defiance of an immensely complex web of human cultural, societal and political factors.

As she goes through the tedious motions of negotiating her way through a labyrinthine administrative organ, at once, socially Confucian and politically Communist, she finds that every step higher means a rejection of the previous level's judgement.  Every verdict and attempt at mediation offered at one level, when appealled to the next level infers an indictment on those lower official's (albeit well-meaning) judgement.  So when she is finally ready to open the ostensibly highest level civil-case at the provincial level, she, unaware of the political dimension involved in justice, finds herself suing and potentially disgracing a civil servant--who she has found to be a genuinely kind, accessible, and well-intentioned--instead of her ""mayor"" from back home.

Its at this point in the narrative her pursuit of justice becomes personally vindictive--she has serious reservations about the idea of bringing an innocent man to trial when she really seeks to put her old ""town mayor"" before a jury.  Unable to accept the reality that the man she seeks to be punished can not possibly be punished within the prevailing context of saving face and representing the legitimacy of the body politic (the argument involved his enforcement of government policy) she resorts, without fully accepting the consequences, to a criminal trial, which involves a little exaggeration on her part.

Meanwhile the ""town mayor"" and the husband become increasingly close as the continuing litigation starts proving initially embarrassing, and eventually scandalous in its notoriety, as they are both alienated, and discredited, by the magnitude of the political attention brought to bear on each by Qiu Ju, whose actions escalate beyond each's control.  The husband in particular instead of merely accepting the damages reasonably stipulated by the government by a man whom he has gravely insulted and no longer bears any real animosity, ends up risking his livelihood as Qiu Ju desperately has to sell off larger and larger portions of his harvest to make expensive trips into the town and finally to the city--ostensibly on his behalf.

This is one of the most ""human"" stories I have ever seen filmed, and potentially Zhang Yimou's most provacative movie by virtue of both its subtlety and its humility of presentation (at the opposite end of the spectrum the is sumptuous and timeless and devastatingly elegant Ju Dou).  The cinematography, as expert as ever, is more documentary in style, looking like super 8, or PAL video from the 80's, and while not deliberately manipulating color for symbol's sake, allows the naturally occurring color and the immensity of the landscape, now both human and environmental, to negotiate its own level of significance with the viewer.  This is the film only a very self-assured director could make.

While the Zhang Yimou trademark long shots, long takes, and patient pacing are here, they are not emphasized--except in the scenes where Qiu Ju begins another journey away from home.  All of his trademark plot devices and character stereotypes, sometimes overwrought to the point of cliche--are here as well:  strong-willed young heroines from peasant backgrounds struggle hopelessly against greater societal forces, often braving ""modern"" cities, while comparatively one-dimensional men get on with the process of determining a workable, prosaic life on an exhausted and completely indifferent earth.

Despite the standard plot elements and characterizations I can say Qiu Ju is where Zhang Yimou's handling of them approaches and occassionally surpasses even Ibsen  or Chekhov in its ambiguity and its sense of naturalism; (and this is the same guy who grazed Euripedes with Ju Dou!) This is a very powerful movie, but recognizing that power will require some patience on the viewer's part.

Gong Li as Qiu Ju is probably her most difficult role as an actress (much more challenging than say Farewell My Concubine or Raise the Red Lantern), and she succeeds here brilliantly.",1147824000,5,5766,5.2513601741022855

I recently checked it out again at the local library - I guess the last time I watched it, I must have been distracted. This is a simple, universal story about ego, justice, karma and fate, expertly told by Zhang and his former muse, Gong Li. I found myself thinking about the film's implications and meaning for a long time after the film ended, to me evidence of a true work of art. It is a crime that this and other Zhang Yimou films have been so difficult to find in DVD format, while other, lesser films have enjoyed various releases and re-releases.",1134345600,10,725,4.5

Another fine performance by Gong Li in a story that takes too long to reach its disconcerting conclusion. Her character's determined struggle to seek a just settlement for the local Communist party official's assault on her husband is impressive. She is not deterred by physical hardship, swindlers, party bureaucrats, or the arrogance of the party official himself. The plot twist that occurs at the birth of her baby almost redeems the slow pace of the film up to that point of the story, but not quite. The quality of the audio transfer from the film to the DVD is uneven -- muffled in too many places. Misspelled subtitles also detract from the dialogue at times. The location shots (in the cities and rural areas) enhance the story but not quite enough for this reviewer. Not a waste of time for those with enough patience to wait for the story to reach its conclusion, but not as good as many other of Gong Li's & Yimou Zhang's work.",1117152000,2,1064,4.605263157894737

But if you are looking for a simple story that for me played out more like a documentary than a story line for a movie I think you will enjoy it.  The rural scenes and settings are real.  The village, journeys and settings are all real China, not a Hollywood set.  And the background actors are incredibly real people who don't work for screen actors guild.  For the person who thought the story couldn't be reality, have you lived under the Chinese communist system?

Having studied communism, visited both China and the Soviet Union in the early 1980's and spent a year in Korea during the war, I find this movie to be a startlingly realistic comparison of the rural way of life in China contrasted with a relatively modern city life and bureaucracy that the average Chinese peasant rarely if ever sees.  The story is cute, realistic, and has some very subtle humor mixed in, and has an ending that is more rapid and somewhat more unexpected than the preceding story.  Of course it doesn't hurt that Gong Li, my favorite Chinese actress, does a great acting job either.

To think that this movie, which pokes fun at the communist system, was made and released in China is even more remarkable.",1091577600,10,1272,4.568281938325991
533316,5,6303023037,"Zhang Yimou's ""The Story of Qiu Ju"" is not a masterpiece as is his film ""Raise the Red Lantern."" It doesn't have the epic qualities of ""To Live"" nor is it as visually stunning as ""The Road Home."" But ""Qiu Ju"" may well be Yimou's most thought provoking film, leaving you pondering the messages a long time after the film has ended.
Qiu Ju's husband has been kicked (""where it counts"") by the village chief. The only bit of justice Qiu Ju wants is an apology. It seems to be a simple enough request, but her search for the apology proves to be elusive as she encounters a legal system more interested in its own red tape than in the needs of ordinary people.
But this is not ""Erin Brockovich"" where the sides of ""good"" and ""bad"" are easily defined. The people in the legal system Qiu Ju encounters are genuinely decent folks. They are also, unfortunately, a bit clueless. And Qiu Ju is not beyond reproach herself. At the conclusion of the film even she is realizing that she has pushed the matter too far.
Just how far should one go to seek justice in this world? Even if you are totally in the right, does there come a time when you must let the matter rest for your own sake as well as everybody else's? There are no easy answers.
This is another great performance by Gong Li in the title role. She may be one of the most beautiful women in the world, but here she is not above playing ""dowdy."" And as usual, Zhang Yimou is nearly flawless in his direction. He gives a wonderful tip of the hat to the late French director Francois Truffaut in the end, echoing that famous final shot of Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows.""

533317,5,6303023037,"I viewed this film on a CVD without benefit of subtitles and had to rely on a Cantonese speaking colleague to translate the Chinese subtitles.  It was well worth the inconvenience (for both of us). It is a simple story that takes on comic proportions as the stubborn protagonist pursues her concept of justice through the snakelike pathways of the bureaucracy to an unexpected outcome - a universal problem that is as much in evidence in a democracy such as North America as it is anywhere.
I lived in Hong Kong for twenty years ('66 - '86) and experienced only the farcical soap operas etc of the Hong Kong film industry.  This production was an eye opener for me of the high quality that exists in Chinese films.  It set me on a trail of discovery that has resulted in a substantial number of Chinese films on DVD gracing my bookshelf (some produced by Hong Kong companies - Shaw Brothers (HK))
Gong Li plays the role of the relentless, stubborn housewife superbly and is an actress who has built herself a solid reputation for excellence for her roles in many films.  For a contrasting role by this brilliant star, I recommend Shanghai Triad.
The film is also expertly crafted and shows how much can be done with a simple story in the hands of skilled film makers.  This is also true of Shanghai Triad which I also remember for its music and photography.
Some of the other Chinese films I admire are The Road Home, The King of Masks and Farewell My Concubine (which paved the way for me to the Peking opera The Peony Pavillion).

Officer Li was interesting in this,he tried to make peace between the two parties. He even spent his own money to make a peace offering. He knew the village Chief (Wang) was a prideful man. Several attempts to make a monetary apology was not accepted. Qiu Ju reminds me of the determined lad in ""Beijing Bicycle"" just that stubborn. She went to all levels of the government to get a verbal apology.  Watch for the turn of events through each level of government she encounters,and the opportunities to let it go.

There is a sense of community and though Qiu Ju is stubborn about demanding an apology and the Chief just as stubborn in refusing it, the community seems to respect both sides.

Gong Li stars as Qiu Ju, a peasant woman with child whose husband is kicked in the groin by the local chief.  She wants an apology.  The chief of course will not apologize since he would then lose face.  Both are stubborn and obstinate.  Proud and determined, Qiu Ju steers her way through the bureaucracy from the village to the district to the city; but the thing she desires, an apology from the chief, eludes her.  He cannot apologize because he has only sired daughters.  He has license (he believes in his heart) because he was insulted by her husband who said he raised ""only hens.""

The Chinese locales, from village roads to big city avenues are presented with stunning clarity so that the color and the sense of life is vivid and compelling.  Director Zhang Yimou. forces us to see.  From the opening shot of the mass of people in the city walking toward us (out of which emerges Qiu Ju) to the feast celebrating the child's first month of life near the end, we feel the humanity of the great mass of the Chinese people.

In a sense this is a gentle satire of the bureaucratic state that modern China has become.  But Zhang Yimou emphasizes the bounty of China and not its poverty.  There is a sense of abundance with the corn drying in the eaves, the sheets of dough being cut into noodles, the fat cows on the roads and the bright red chili drying in the sun.  There is snow on the ground and the roads are unpaved, but there is an idyllic feeling of warmth emanating from the people.  One gets the idea that fairness and tolerance will prevail.

In another sense, this is a parable about the price of things and how that differs from what is really of value.  So often is price mentioned in the movie that I can tell you that a yuan at the time of the movie was worth about a dollar in its buying power.  (Four and a half yuan for a ""pound"" of chili; five yuan as a fair price for a short cab ride; twenty yuan for a legal letter.)  Getting justice in the strict sense is what Qiu Ju demands.  Her affable husband would settle for a lot less.  He is the wiser of the two.  Notice how Qiu Ju is acutely sensitive to price.  She bargains well and avoids most of the rip offs of the big city.  But what is the value of being a member of the community?  This is a lesson she needs to learn, and, as the movie ends, she does.

533370,5,6303023037,"This film once again pairs one of the greatest actress director teams.  Gong Li and Zhang Yimou.  This is the team that has given us so many great Chinese films.
What is different about this film is the time period. Most  of the Yimou Gong Li pairs have been very historical: WWII, the Mao years,  the Warlord period etc.  This film is different in that it is a look at  modern China and the current Communist beauracracy.
In the short run, its  a story of a woman trying to get justice for her embarrassed husband.  But  it is really a commentary on the current government in China and how people  in China are dealing with the system.
I don't want to go into too many  details about the plot and give anything away.
Just know this.  It's a  wondeful movie just like the other pairings of these two great moviemakers.",963273600,9,818,4.373333333333333

This story, a slow and meandering tale of little importance, drags out the idea that people in China have learned their government moves at a snail's pace and they cannot expect any relief or justice from it.

I am always amazed at how beautiful this actress is and what fine and  versatile performances she gives. I enjoyed the usual backdrop of inefficient and bumbling bureaucracy which provides for an ironic twist at the end. I can easily recommend this very good film.,1458518400,,341,5.089285714285714
