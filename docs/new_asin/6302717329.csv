510735,3,6302717329,"These Sidney Toler ""Monogram"" Chan films, the last in the series, don't measure up to Warner Oland's earlier efforts but they are still very entertaining to me. Even with Mantan Moreland, who probably offends the sensibilities of a lot of people with his scared black-man routine. I can see where that's offensive, but if you just take him as a comedian and let it go, you can enjoy and even laugh with him.

The only thing I did NOT find amusing in here, but I normally do, is Charlie's insults to his kid. In this film, Tolder insults ""Number Three Son"" (Benson Fong) so many times that it borders on downright mean-spiritedness.

Anyway, it was still a ""decent"" combination of mystery and comedy and the ending was cool, with Chan and his assistants chasing the bad guys around a ""fun house."" All the Charlie Chan movies are entertaining.",1233792000,,841,4.675675675675675
510736,3,6302717329,"1944's ""The Chinese Cat"" pits famous detective Charlie Chan, here played by Sidney Toler, against a murderous diamond smuggling gang.  The famous Honolulu detective, seconded to the U.S. Government for the war effort, is assisted by series regulars Number Three Son Tommy (Benson Fong) and nervous cab driver Birmingham Brown (Mantan Moreland).

Chan is asked to investigate a cold case involving the locked room murder of the husband of a wealthy socialite, who has now been acccused of the murder by a muck-raking novelist.  Chan and his son follow a rather improbable string of clues that point to a bigger conspiracy and high stakes in the form of stolen diamonds.  As witnesses keep showing up dead, and one dead witness keeps showing up alive, Chan, Tommy, and Brown close in on the smuggling gang's hideout in a old amusement park funhouse. The climax of the movie is a deadly cat and mouse chase through secret rooms.

Dialogue in this particular episode is unusually woooden.  Charlie's normal chastisement of his errant son seems almost like hectoring.  Tommy and Birmingham Brown are played mostly for laughs, although both will get a chance to be a hero in the end.  The plot is just obscure enough to keep the audience guessing for awhile, but the wrap-up seems artificially convenient. This movie will be of interest primarily to dedicated fans of the Charlie Chan series.",1207612800,,1386,4.96969696969697
510737,5,6302717329,"The 6 films in the box set basically concentrated on Sidney Toler as Charlie Chan joining the US Government during WII and solving mysteries involving weapons and other sundry items involved with the government. Due to the time era, Fox had dropped the series in fear of losing profits on the series and due to the anti-oriental sentiment at the time. B studio, Monogram picked the series up. ""The Chinese Cat"" deviates from the usual Chan films during this period and concentrates on murder and diamond smuggling with less emphasis on government projects. #3 son Benson Fong and sidekick Matlon Moore (portrayed as a very atypical stereotyped black person of era) are along for the fun and provide comic relief. Chan also has a few good one liners he delivers to #3 son. As most of the movies made during wartime were careful and cautionary, this outing is much more relaxed and entertaining and is more typical of the series prior to the war. I would stick with the pre-war movies (most of them are now public domain and not available). But if you can get them, they are far more enjoyable. For now, we have THE CHINESE CAT for our viewing pleasure.

The best outing by Chan during WWII.",1177113600,,1189,4.661904761904762
510738,3,6302717329,"I knew I was going to have fun with this film just from seeing some of the names in the credits.  Cy Kendall was the king of the rackets in the first Green Hornet serial.  Anthony Warde was Killer Kane to Buster Crabbe's Buck Rogers in the single Buck serial.  And John Davidson, who has a nice turn here as two creepy twins, was the Ghost in one of the Dick Tracy serials.

Plus there's I. Stanford Jolley,who was in every single B-movie and serial ever made (well, most of them, anyway).

Chan investigates a locked-room murder, chases some McGuffins in the form of cat statues, and ends up battling the bad guys in a gloomy fun-house.  A minor but enjoyable B-feature, and not so long that it overstays its welcome.",1163030400,,718,4.442748091603053
510739,3,6302717329,"Loosely based on novels by Earl Derr Biggers, 20th Century Fox's Charlie Chan series proved an audience favorite--but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor the studio feared audiences would turn against its Asian hero. This was a miscalculation: actor Sidney Toler took the role to ""poverty row"" Monogram Studios, where he continued to portray the character in eleven more popular films made between 1944 and his death in 1947.

20th Century Fox had regarded the Chan films as inexpensive ""B"" movies, but even so the studio took considerable care with them: the plots were often silly, but the pace was sharp, the dialogue witty, and the casts (which featured the likes of Bela Lugosi and Ray Milland) always expert. The result was a kindly charm which has stood the test of time. Monogram was a different matter: Chan films were ""B"" movies plain and simple. Little care was taken with scripts or cast and resulting films were flat, mediocre at best, virtually unwatchable at worst.

Released in 1944, THE CHINESE CAT finds Chan beset by son Tommy, who has promised the step-daughter of a murdered man assistance; they are joined in the investigation by cab driver Birmigham, who is not overeager to be reunited with the Chans given that murder tends to follow in their wake. Indeed, there will be three murders, stolen jewels, and a carnival fun house before the killers are captured. Like all the Monogram Chan films, the plot is trivial and the script even more so; unlike the worst of the Monogram Chan films, however, it does have the occasional touch of atmosphere and moves at a respectable pace.

Sidney Toler gives a nice reprise of Charlie Chan in this film, but as usual in the Monogram Chan films Mantan Moreland (Birmingham) is the real scene stealer.  Changing times have led us to look upon Moreland's brand of comedy as demeaning to African-Americans, but he was an expert actor and comic, and taken within the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s his work has tremendous charm and innocence.

Fans of the 20th Century Fox series are likely to find Monogram's Chan a significant disappointment and newcomers who like the Monogram films will probably consider them third-rate after encountering the Fox films. Like other Monogram Chan films, MEETING AT MIDNIGHT is best left to determined collectors. Three stars, and that's being generous.

510740,4,6302717329,THE CHINESE CAT is a surprisingly good war-time film by Monogram. Sidney Toler is back as Charlie and Benson Fong has the role of Tommy Chan. Tommy is Charlie's number three son. Manton Moreland as Birmingham Brown begins the movie as a cab driver and ends up as Charlie's chauffeur. Some of the best scenes take place in a fun house.,1030492800,10,334,4.491803278688525
510741,3,6302717329,"Monogram Pictures, one of the smaller Hollywood studios, really tried to make its Charlie Chan mysteries competitive with major-studio product, and this time it worked. ""The Chinese Cat"" (1944) has everything audiences had come to expect from the series: a capable cast of familiar character actors (Cy kendall, Ian Keith, Joan Woodbury, and at least four favorite serial performers), good direction (by the normally uninspired Phil Rosen), and striking photography (by veteran cameraman Ira Morgan). The story concerns an unsolved murder, and a muck-raking novelist whose latest book hits too close to home. Sidney Toler and Mantan Moreland are always enjoyable, and number-three son Benson Fong has more to do than usual (he defies the criminal mastermind in a memorable scene). Charlie Chan fans will enjoy this; followers of the Monogram corpus will applaud this fine companion piece to ""The Shanghai Cobra"" and ""The Scarlet Clue."" This is one ""B"" that gets a solid ""A"" for effort.",988243200,23,985,5.280254777070064
510742,2,6302717329,"For some reason, the second Monogram Chan movie is a bit slow moving during the first half of the film.  Mantan Moreland's comedy material is not very good this time, but would improve in The Scarlet Clue and The  Shanghai Cobra.  Chan and Number 3 son Tommy get captured and roughed up  this time, unusual in a Chan film.  I would call this a middling effort  from Monogram.  Classic Chan line is ""Expert is merely man who make  quick decision--and is sometimes right.""",935280000,15,470,4.578313253012048

There are several overlapping story threads. And the Chinese cat(S) turnout to be sculptures. We get to see Charlie's number three son Tommy (Benson Fong) always putting his foot in his mouth and stumbling into trouble. However he can be pretty tough when the chips are down. The real comic relief is Birmingham Brown, Taxi Driver (Mantan Moreland.)

510909,2,6302717329,"The Red Dragon, 1945 film

It begins in Mexico City. In the United States Embassy a man tells about the attempted theft of papers. They call in Charlie Chan. At the Hotel Miramar a man changes a typewriter ribbon. Inspector Cavarro arrives. They hear a shot! The man at the typewriter falls. Chan arrives with Tommy Chan and Chattanooga Brown. Walter Dorn was murdered just an hour ago. The six people there were taken to police headquarters for questioning. No gun was found. There is a bottle of Red Dragon Chinese Ink on the desk. Wyans papers were not found, they are about an atomic bomb! The police will check the typewriter, paper, and ribbon. The witnesses are questioned. Dorn was a detective. The witnesses have pasts. They must not leave the city.

There were no rifling marks on the bullets. How can that be? Wyans kept his important papers hidden away. His typewriter was stolen. Chan tells about the persons secrets. A week has passed. The rooms of the suspects were searched but no weapon found. Tommy and Chattanooga search the basement for a trunk. They find a dummy in a trunk. Others arrive, they are watched. Wyans tries to call Chan, there is a shot, and he falls. They police catch him. Charlie says there will be another killing as Wyans papers weren't found. One shot, two bullets found, no gun found. Countess Irene sings in the cabaret. She begins to talk when there is a shot; she will not talk now.

The other suspects are searched, no weapon found. But Charlie finds an object in his jacket! How is it fired? They search for a Chinese woman artist at the nightclub. Charlie does the rumba with Miss Ling and talks about a serious topic. She sold Wyans that ink. Then Tommy talks to Miss Ling. Chan inspects the old typewriter ribbon and finds a hidden message. Then he explains why no gun was found, something else fired the bullets! They go to the fifth floor to detect the murderer. Shots identify the room, but the person escaped. They go to the basement. Shots are fired in the trunk room! [How many bullets in a revolver?] A man staggers away until he is caught and arrested.

This is not a good story, it seems to be a poor imitation of previous movies. The use of atomic bomb secrets dates it to the end of 1945.",1486425600,,2248,4.515970515970516

My first and last attempt to play this product was last evening (8/6/16). First, I have never seen a pink play area on a DVD. That said, when I attempted to play the DVD, it immediately froze at the ""Warning"" screen. Let's face it, no one wants to read that information more than once. Several ejection and replays produced the DVD' valiant attempt to play, to the effect of various pixels flashing onscreen and the first movie (didn't get beyond that) freezing and releasing to several frames forward. Not what I would call a perfect product.

I ask that TGG Direct, LLC provide me with an address to which I can return this poorly-produced product. I have no use for it and, frankly, if other DVD's produced by this maker are of the same quality, I would suggest everyone buy elsewhere.

511382,3,6302717329,"Loosely basing the character the legendary police officer Chang Apana (1887-1933), author Earl Derr Biggers (1884-1933) wrote the first Charlie Chan novel in 1925. His novels, six in all, were immensely popular--and Hollywood soon bought the rights. At least two silent films, which do not survive, were made; a third film, BEYOND THAT CURTAIN, reduced the character of Chan to a minor role. In 1931, however, Fox studios hit the right mixture of mystery and comedy with CHARLIE CHAN CARRIES ON. The series originally starred Warner Oland; upon his death, the role of Chan passed to Sidney Toler and the films remained as popular as ever. But in 1941 the series hit a bump in the road: 20th Century Fox felt that an Asian detective would be unpopular in the wake of Pearl Harbor. Deeming the property worthless, they sold the rights to Chan to actor Sidney Toler--who proved 20th Century Fox wrong by taking the character to Mongram Studios, where the series continued with some success.

At 20th Century Fox, the Chan movies had ""B"" budgets, but they made use of ""A"" actors, writers, directors, and the studio's standing sets. At Monogram, ""B"" meant ""B,"" and the Chan films quickly lost the sly wit for which they were famous and drifted into mildly enjoyable but not greatly memorable programers.  Among the best known of the Monogram films are CHARLIE CHAN IN THE SECRET SERVICE (1944), THE CHINESE CAT (1944), and THE JADE MASK (1945.)  All three of these films star Sidney Toler as Chan with Mantan Moreland as sidekick Birmingham Brown.  The scripts lack the tightness and the wit of the 20th Century Fox films and the supporting casts range from adequate to merely wooden--but Toler is always enjoyable as Chan, and Moreland is a knockout.  By today's standards much of Moreland's comedy is politically incorrect, but he himself cannot be faulted, and he provides the glue that makes the films worth watching.

CHARLIE CHAN IN THE SECRET SERVICE finds Chan investigating the murder of a scientist whose invention would be of great value to the Axis powers.  THE CHINESE CAT concerns a murder deemed unsolvable by local experts and a diamond theft, and THE JADE MASK involves a gas that makes wood as hard as steel--not to mention a particularly nasty poison that kills within seconds.  None of these films are top-line, nowhere near the 20th Century Fox films, but the prints are very good and Chan collectors will find them a must have.  A warning note: all three titles are included in CHANTHOLOGY, so take care not double-buy.

511627,4,6302717329,"The following is a reprint of my review of a different single-disc collection of the same three movies. This box set is simply released by a different company at a higher price, though I read elsewhere that each film has its own disc (but the Amazon description reads one disc - if anyone can clarify, please add a comment to this review - Thanx). Either way, the films have not been restored and there are no special features, so for $$ reasons I recommend the other (Image Entertainment) single-disc collection instead. See review next.

The single-disc collection of Sidney Toler's Charlie Chan is basic, but worth it if you get it at a good price. In May 2012, I found it for $5 in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart. All three movies are on one side of the disc. There are no special features and the films have not been restored. (Thus they can be a little dark or have occasional scratches, but still are comfortably viewable.)

For those not familiar with Chan film history, Sidney Toler took over the title role following the death of Warner Oland. Toler did eight (I think) Chan films for Twentieth Century Fox. Then WWII intervened and the studio stopped the series. Toler purchased the rights for Chan films from Fox and made several more Chan films during the war period. The production quality, scripts, direction, etc. were not up to the level of the studio system, but they filled demand from the public.

These three films were made in 1944 so several times in the scripts there are ""propaganda"" moments, but not too overbearing. 'In The Secret Service' is the weakest of the three. Director Rosen seems to be trying to find his footing, and the supporting actors are trying to figure out their roles. By 'Chinese Cat' and 'Jade Mask', the story and direction have improved, though still not up to the standards demonstrated in the major studio releases.

In short, buy the Charlie Chan Collection Volumes 1-5 first. And if you like them (you probably will) and want more (especially if you like Toler's Chan), then this is a nice, inexpensive DVD for your collection.",1337040000,8,2078,4.700549450549451

511631,3,6302717329,"Charlie Chan and the Chinese Cat was a bit sub-standard production of Monogram Pictures and since it was a later show, probably that's why the predictable script and story.  Still, Charlie's sense of humor as acted by Sidney Toler was really well done.

Plot:  The story centers around a chess expert who is shot to death in a locked room but has a secret panel.  The case remains unsolved for six months!  Still, the crooks are about and are not happy that Chan is reopening the case.

As with the earlier Chan tales, we have to have some comic relief at the expense of his Number Three son and his cab driver Buchanan - typical racial stereotypes of the time may offend modern audiences and really there was no need for a sidekick.  Apparently Buchanan has been on other adventures with Chan as they seem to know each other well.

While clearing up the family name (the papers think his wife did it) we have lots of driving and investigating and not a lot of action until near the end when the case is solved.  The comic relief is rather stupid - there is a twin brother involved, one of whom is dead, and these guys think it's a ghost rather than a twin or a double.  Duh!

The Chinese Cat in question was used as a smuggling device, disguising jewel heists, but it was unclear how this was done.  Also little statues were also used but again not much info about the crooks or who was involved.  The ending was somewhat predictable.
Not the best Chan film, but it was in foggy San Francisco and the editing and music are typical fare for the time.  Rental.",1321747200,,1559,4.386759581881533
