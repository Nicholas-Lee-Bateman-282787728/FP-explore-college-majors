8114276,1,B000EU1Q7C,"Chloe's Closet is one of my favorite TV shows, it's fun, musical, it's filled with fun magical dress up adventures, cute characters, and it got you to use your imagination in a fun way, don't expect any of that in this show! I don't like Dragon Tales because it's not fun, cute, or entertaining at all. I mainly hate the plot and a few of the characters. Emmy and Max are sometimes annoying, but the two headed dragon is the worst character in the whole show! Doesn't make any since at all! This show is not teaching good lessons to kids for three reasons. 1. leaving home without telling the parents, 2. using your imagination in a bad kind of way, 3. learning that the most important thing is to do whatever you feel like doing. The songs are easily forgettable. Dragon Tales is not only a bad TV show, it's really contrived, weird, and the horrible show characters, voices, and songs might stay in your head for hours! Kids, say yes to Chloe's Closet and no to Dragon Tales!",1433635200,,977,4.433333333333334

8114278,4,B000EU1Q7C,"Most of the Dragon Tales videos are excellent, but I have found that the newer shows are too preachy and talk down to the kids/viewers. There is no need to repeat the moral again. Kids get it. They are smarter than we realize, and like my grandkids, they completely understand what is going on.

Overall, these are excellent, easy to understand for the 2 and above age group, and very well made. The stories are interesting and the characters are well rounded.",1388102400,,460,4.609756097560975
8114279,5,B000EU1Q7C,"lets be brave was one of my favorite movies in the series.  i give it 5 stars and the reason are as follows. it teaches young children about getting over their fears and it is funny at the same time.  the first one  included calling dr. zack this episode is when zack gets a thorn in his foot and is too afraid to call to the doctor. his friends encourage him to and he does. the second one is the big sleep over and i really like this one because zack reminds me of my grandmother when she is really tired.  i find it funny when whezzy wants to stay up all night but not zack.  the third one is called stormy weather and it is enjoyable as well.  the fourth one is sounds like trouble and it is quite funny.  lastly,  muscical scales really makes me laugh when zack and whezzy are dressed up in funny clothes.

my two favorite characters are emmy and zack.  emmy is an outstanding leader and zack is the most funny boy.  this movie is really great for children of any adge.  i am sure you will agree with me once you have watched this. hope you enjoy the movie and find my review helpful.",1329696000,,1089,4.109004739336493
8114280,4,B000EU1Q7C,"""Let's Be Brave"" is ""Dragon Tales"" release themed on the idea of stories that help the viewers to overcome fears. This release goes mostly with the classics, featuring four stories from the first season of the program and one selection from the recent third season.

""Calling Dr. Zak""

This is a great one. While Zak and Wheezie are practicing a song, Zak accidentally steps on a ""spinypine"" and gets a thorn stuck in his foot. Max, Emmy and the dragons all help him to not feel so afraid of going to the doctor.

""The Big Sleep Over""

Zak and Wheezie are holding a sleepover, but Cassie is afraid to spend the night away from home. Emmy first helps her to come to the sleepover and then everyone comes with a unique way to help her enjoy it.

""Stormy Weather""

Ord and his family are holding a big party for spring. While everything is being prepared, Max, Emmy and the dragons go to play at a playground in the sky. Then a storm comes and they take refuge in a cage --- but Ord is afraid of the thunder.

""Sounds Like Trouble""

When Max loses a toy he created called a goo ball, Max, Emmy and the dragons once again find themselves in a cave. But Ord is afraid of the darkness and the loud noises within.

""Musical Scales""

This is the story from the third season. Enrique arrives at Max and Emmys' wearing a colorful hat and won't take it off for anyone. In Dragon Land, Zak and Wheezie are ready to cancel a planned performance because they're embarrassed to appear in public --- their scales are shedding. Max, Emmy, Enrique and the dragons try all sorts of ways to cover up the shedding.

Overall, the stories fit the theme nicely. I can't fault any of the choices except maybe ""Sounds Like Trouble,"" which felt like a bit of a retread to me as far as the whole issue of Ord's fear of the darkness.

Like other ""Dragon Tales"" releases, this DVD doesn't contain anything in the way of special features, other than some promos and a few Dragon Tunes segments. The promos are for other Sony children's DVD releases, the Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection, ""Stuart Little 3"" and the upcoming film ""Open Season."" There's also a look at ""It's a Big Big World"" on PBS --- Sony is a show sponsor.

The three Dragon Tunes are ""Hum,"" ""Betcha Can"" and ""Speak Up."" I can't fault the choices, but I can fault the inconsistent presentation. One of these features the big follow-along words with exploding fireworks as seen on the ""Let's Start a Band"" DVD, whereas the other two only feature close-captioning. Also, it might be my imagination, but it sounds to me like they got somebody different to perform ""Hum.""",1154736000,,2610,4.504237288135593
