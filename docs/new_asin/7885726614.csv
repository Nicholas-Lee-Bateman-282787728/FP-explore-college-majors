7900891,4,7885726614,"I am writing this review because I think there is one element that has not been covered by the other reviews. Firstly though some disclaimers. I watched the film from a Greek DVD, the condition of the transfer was as bad as Toronto_Matt mentions  so I am not going to comment on the quality of the transfer on the DVD offered here. Another disclaimer: I am completely ignorant about martial arts; despite having seen several martial arts movies I know nothing about the differences of the various schools and types. It has been very helpful to read the reviews here. However, I must stress this for other viewers like me the ones not familiar with martial arts. You should approach the film without expecting to understand the finer details and the historical significance of the events. So, prepare to be mystified a bit with what is going on. However, having a grasp of the finer details of martial arts is not at all necessary to enjoy the film as the action is not its central element.
The main interest in the film for me is how the protagonist matures as the story develops and how this process is expressed aesthetically. I will just say that the main character starts with an extremely simplistic view of life but through the relationships he forms he becomes more tormented with doubt. The way I see it, in contrast to the other reviewers, it is not only a matter of humanity but of recognizing that life is full of dilemmas without a clear or correct answer. It is amazing how Kurosawa was able to make such a film in the middle of the Second World War! Also amazing is that in his first film, he manages to picture the changes and the inner life of his hero so beautifully, combining filmic and painterly elements. Sorry for being too vague but I do not want to expound a lot so as not to spoil the film.",1427500800,,1815,4.483383685800605
7900892,4,7885726614,"""Sanshiro Sugata"" aka ""Judo Saga"", like many of Akira Kurosawa's films that followed, is a martial-arts film that de-emphasizes combat and violence and focuses on the heart and serenity of Japanese martial arts.  It takes place during judo's formative years when jujitsu was the country's standard martial art. Jujitsu's emphasis is on brutal incapacitation of one's opponent by using leverage against him to obtain take-downs, joint locks, and chokes while judo is a refined form using the same basic principles and techinques, but with the intent to throw and subdue the opponent.  The two combat forms clashed in the late 1800's and a tournament was held in 1886 to decide which martial-art would be taught to the nation's police force.  And that is when this film takes place.

We meet the title character driving rickshaws for a living and aspiring to learn the art of jujitsu.  He then comes upon a judo master being attacked by a gang of jujitsu students eager to stomp out the threat to their beloved art.  As the older man easily dumps each assailant into the nearby river, Sugata is so impressed that he decides to become his disciple.  After an out-of-control street fight, Sugata's master disowns him, likening the mistake of teaching such an undisciplined man judo to giving a knife to a lunatic.  Sugata then attempts to atone by freezing to death in the pond in front of the dojo.  While spending the night in the frigid waters, Sugata comes upon a moment of clarity and is a changed man from that day forward.  But that's when the real problems start.

""Sanshiro Sugata"" -like all of Kurosawa's films- is an exceptional entry to the martial-arts film genre.  By juxtaposing the harsher form of jujitsu with judo and the various attitudes of their practitioners he shows us the two sides of the combat arts: the humane, honorable, zen side and the prideful, combative, strength-obsessed side.  The character of Sugata is an ideal hero; a sensitive soul with an appreciation for all things natural, an unflinching sense of honor, and of course a penchant for kicking tail when the need arises.

The fights are the one thing about this film that could have used improvement.  Aside from the opening battle, we seldom get to see the techniques of judo.  The camera tends to cut away from the grappling straight to a clumsy shot of the opponent flying through the air.  I would liken the presentation of judo matches to the boxing in the Rocky films; it's just not realistic.  And the jujitsu in this film is nearly nonexistent, as though the practitioners are but fodder waiting there to be thrown.  However, the final duel is an outstanding scene; moody, intense, and evocative.  This may be Akira Kurosawa's first film, but it didn't take him long to put his stamp on the industry.  Even the score is recognizable as 100% his.  For those interested in a judo film I highly recommend this peek into an important time in martial-arts history.  It's got everything you'd expect from the legendary director.

7900893,5,7885726614,"From the beginning of this film the differences between jujitsu and judo (Do) are made clear. The former is more of the art of martial art of combat.  The latter the martial art of living.  Gigiro Cana (Jano) Judo de-eimphasise the lethal espects of jujitsu that was widely practised in Japan for a more spiritual, approach more holistic with nature and its rhythms.

Sanshiro Sugata, initially not even aware of Judo, sees it founder in action against an ambush of jujitsu advocates and chooses the switch sides.  But, still unlearned in judo's deeper meanings, he becomes a raging bully.  Chastened by Mr. Jano, Sugata threatens to commit suicide!  Ultimately, he sees the error of his way, become a model student.  Here agan the use of recurring metaphor effectivley and creatively used.

Scenes of nature appear frequently: blossoming flowers, clouds, water, rolling grass hills--no dialogue, as a Western film might demand. And considering when it was made (1942) Akira made innovative use of the camera including slow motioin and (possibly) time lapse, and very soft melts from one scene to the next.

Sugata's two greatest challenges are his heart, when the daughter of his opponent is seen praying at a temple, and the foremost and young, jujitsu fighter.  A man determined not only to battle Sanshiro, but kill him.

Again the way of judo is in evidence when the two meet in final combat....Here the director again uses long shots of man dwarfted by nature and when the fight is over, but that would be telling.  A fine, moral film that is as valueable today for its humanity and story.",1200096000,4,1595,4.888475836431227
7900894,5,7885726614,"This dvd is a perfect transfer! Subtitles are on par and the quality is superb considering it's source. I completely disagree with the negative review from the other reviewer.

It is possible he was in a bad mood? Either way this is the only copy of this movie that exists and it's a must for anyone who studies film or is a fan of the genre. I am not going to spoil the movie for you!",1178755200,,385,4.065789473684211
7900895,1,7885726614,"Akira Kurosawa's first film as a director is one well worth searching out and seeing. Donald Ritchie has an outstanding review of it in his ""Films of Akira Kurosawa"" and many of his comments served to enrich and deepen my understanding of this great film.

However the Chinese DVD version of this film features terrible quality in both picture and subtitling.

Do yourself a favour and get a copy of the VHS tape which is available and is of much better quality or wait until a better version of the DVD is released.",1162252800,8,516,4.537634408602151
