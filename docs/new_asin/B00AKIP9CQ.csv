8553126,1,B00AKIP9CQ,"Ok, so my son stayed home sick and wanted to watch this.  about 10 minutes in as Thor is making his sacrifice to Odin, and Odin is being all pissy to his servants, he clearly says "" F-That!""  So, it is NOT suitable for kids!!!  I had to rewind it several times just to make sure what I heard was correct.  Don't watch this trash!",1391472000,4,329,4.015384615384615

8553128,3,B00AKIP9CQ,"I wish I hadn't let my kids watch this with me. I should have pre-watched it, it wasn't terrible (other than the lack of entertainment) but there was some content that my kids could have lived without being exposed to this young.",1372377600,6,229,4.476190476190476
