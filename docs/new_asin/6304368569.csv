853990,5,6304368569,Soooo happy to have found this one.  Our grandfather and relatives from Sugar Cane Indian Reserve in British Columbia is in it.  Good quality ole film.  Well worth the time and money to acquire it.,1265414400,2,197,4.571428571428571
853991,5,6304368569,"Just as I remembered - an excellent movie - a real classic.  It was a used disc, but very good quality.  I am very satisfied.",1259020800,,125,3.96
853992,4,6304368569,"I haven't seen this movie in years and wanted to be able to share it with my daughter without spending 100 bucks on the DVD.  She loved it.  I believe the tape may have been spliced toward the end, but that really didn't bother me. The picture quality was good and we look forward to enjoying the movie again and again.",1255305600,2,319,4.213114754098361
853993,5,6304368569,"Just out of the military, a young vet travels to the wilderness to meet with a Native American Chief to inform him about his son's death, but also to reflect amongst nature and find a new life-direction for himself. Living in a rented lakeside cabin, the young man, Bob Leslie (played by Patrick Wayne), discovers three small bear cubs orphaned by a local hunter. He decides to take them in as his family until they are old enough to live on their own. This does not sit well with the local tribe which believes their brother the bear should be left to the Great Spirit's will. But the tribe has troubles of their own, as the government has plans for their land to become a national park and wants to relocate them all to a reservation at another lake location. Bob unintentionally gets caught up in the dispute that rapidly threatens the relationships he's tried to form and the bears he wishes to protect.

If you're a fan of the oldschool Disney animal films, ""The Bears and I"", based on a true autobiographical book, should be quite enjoyable to you as one of their later films with that theme (1974). However, ""The Bears and I"" is as much about the struggle between the ""Indian"" tribe and the National Parks people as it is about three orphaned bear cubs frolicking and causing mischief. In fact, maybe more. I've read some disputes over the way Native Americans are represented in the film in contrast to the way the ""white man"" is represented. Let me just say that neither is depicted in a positive nor a negative light. The main character, Bob, is a bit naive, but he and his new Native American friend, Oliver Red Fern, are the two kind and level headed characters of the film, and the two battling sides are simply presented as stubborn and unwilling to negotiate. Luckily, this is a classic Disney film, and things work out well in the end in quite a clever and satisfying way. There are some clichs and the phrase ""you people"" is used a lot by the lead, so expect any ""Tropic Thunder"" fans to be noisy if they watch this movie, but over all, this is a beautiful film with breathtaking imagery, music from John Denver (well, one song used more than once), and some fine lessons about trust, friendship, love, life, and working together. The only DVD of this Disney release so far is the out-of-print Anchor Bay release. So glad I bought it years ago when I first bought a DVD player. Wish I'd bought more of those Anchor Bay Disney DVDs back then. One side of the disc is widescreen and the other is fullscreen, but there are no bonus features. I must admit, this has been on my shelf unwatched since I bought it, but I watched it today, and it was a delightful surprise!",1243987200,4,2682,4.484662576687117
853994,5,6304368569,"The movie The Bears and I was very good. The beginning of the the movie was absolutely breathtaking. The song fits very well with the movie. The song ""Sweet Surrender"" written by the late John Denver was written for the movie because of the ecological scenery. Throughout the movie the scenery was really truly God's country in British Columbia Canada. I think that Patrick Wanye, Chief Dan George and Robert Pine were very good actors in the movie. The movie is very much a family entertainment. I very highly recommend this movie.",1074556800,10,532,4.793478260869565
853995,5,6304368569,"I remember reading the paperback by Robert Franklin Leslie before seeing  this film -- and the film did live up to the book. (It's a true story, by  the way!) Actor Patrick Wayne, son of the late John Wayne, does a superb  job in the lead role.  The story centers on a man, prospecting for gold in  Canadian north woods in the 1960s, who adopted three orphaned bear cubs and  prepared them for the perils of living free. It's similar to ""Born  Free"" in some regards. Very recommended.",961459200,15,484,4.431818181818182
853996,3,6304368569,"This mid-70's Disney film is a mild (as Leonard Maltin calls it)but competent family film. Starring Patrick Wayne, son of John Wayne (and notice Patrick's walk!), as a Vietnam veteran going to see the father of a  fellow soldier killed in action. Chief Dan George protrays the late  soldier's father. Also stars Michael Ansara in another ethnic role, Robert  Pine of CHIPS, and solid character actor Andrew Duggan.
 Wayne's  character protects three orphaned cubs. This action causes friction with  the local Indian tribe who view the bear as their brother. Further trouble  is caused when the US government decides to build a National Park on the  property that the Indians are settled on. Maltin describes the film as  Wayne trying to settle the problems between the Indians and the ""white  bigots"", but there is NO scene or language of bigotry in the film. It  is a matter of property rights and the rights of indigenous people.
The  film is predictable as it is a Disney film, but it is very enjoyable. Wayne  narrates the story in the first person. The scenery is breathtaking. The  interplay of the bears is charming. The lessons learned at the end of the  film are valuable. Fun fare for the family.
A side note: John Denver  wrote and sung the title song ""Sweet Surrender"" for the film.",947721600,2,1294,4.761261261261262

854188,2,6304368569,"The story of a young veteran just home.  He heads up to the mountains to a place where his (Native American) army buddy, who didn't make it home, called home.  He brings a picture of him and his friend as a gift to the old chief who was his friends father, then rents an old run down cabin across the lake and settles in for some fishing and time to find himself.  There is some controversies, some poaching, some fights, some pretty scenes. Overall thought, not very entertaining. My little ones enjoyed the fun bear scenes, but that didn't really make it worth it.  I wouldn't watch again. It was fun to see Patrick Wayne in something, hadn't seen him in anything since Mclintock.",1425340800,,682,4.475806451612903
854189,5,6304368569,My 12 year old daughter and I watched this together and we both enjoyed it.  These older Disney movies are great family entertainment. The scenery in this was beautiful and my daughter never took her eyes off the screen.,1425168000,,220,4.641025641025641
854190,5,6304368569,"I'd never heard of this Disney gem before.  With a great cast that includes Patrick Wayne (son of John) Michael Ansara, and Chief Dan George, this film is much more than just another cute animal movie.  The Disney studios produced an excellent film about native Americans trying to remain on their traditional native land, which Uncle Sam wants to turn into a national park.  Although it is 40 years old, it is right out of today's headlines, as Congress just gave private industry the mining rights to a piece of National Forest that is sacred Apache land.  The Bears and I could have been produced today.  This film is a good one!",1418774400,5,632,4.607142857142857
854191,5,6304368569,"Classic 1960's Disney. I grew up on this kind of movie entertainment. Moral stories that capture your heart and soul. They reveal the actions of good and bad people, but show that good principles and character usually triumph in the end.",1412121600,,237,4.804878048780488

Note that there are a couple of fist fights in case you don't care for your children viewing those. We found nothing objectionable in this film.",1394841600,,298,4.321428571428571

854284,5,6304368569,I have read the book almost two times and love books and movies that are true.  The book has been passed around to several of my aunts that have read it. I didn't know there was a movie made until today. I am reading it now to an elderly lady that I take care of and we have to read a chapter or two a day. She is smitten with the story as was I when I first read it. Thanks Martha McDuffie,1391040000,,390,3.6987951807228914
854285,5,6304368569,I had read the book when it first came out and I was thrilled to find this movie on here to show my granddaughters!  A Disney movie worth seeing. Most people are unaware that Patrick Wayne is John Wayne's son.,1389398400,,209,4.225

854287,5,6304368569,"I watched this movie over and over when I was a little girl.  Loved it then and I loved watching it with my kids last week (4, 7, 9, 11).  They weren't as thrilled as I was, but all of them liked it.  Warning that the sub-plot is about relations between Native Americans and white government people, so can be tricky.  There is some mild violence and a few references to drinking.  The bad guy is bad, no doubt about it, but the story is sweet and the bears are adorable.  Recommend it as a fun family movie night selection.",1375056000,2,524,4.19
854288,4,6304368569,"I still own a VHS version of this movie and it is one of my favorite stories to watch.  However, in trying to get a DVD copy to update my library, I am amazed at the prices some people are charging for this movie.  $299 for a new DVD and $450 for a used one?  Really?  Is the DVD made of GOLD?  Only a moron would pay those kind of prices for ANY movie!  And what's up with a used DVD being worth more than a brand new one?  I see that a lot.  It's not a car, people.  It doesn't go up in value just because it is used.  My friend sells stuff online for rediculous prices and I asked him why?  He said, ""There's a sucker born every minute and I can sell anything for 20X what it's worth.""  All I can say is ""wow"".  I've got some used dog food I should sell.  Maybe I can get $500 for it.  It's classic dog food by the way...
Yes, I'm venting. Just very frustrated.  I'll eventually own a DVD version of ""The Bears and I"" at a reasonable price, but until then I'll just watch my VHS version.",1362268800,2,990,3.875

854290,1,6304368569,"Robert Franklin Leslie must have been embarassed to have his name associated with this Disney film!  After reading the book, I was so excited to see that a movie had been made and was still available on Amazon.  What a disappointment!  The script and acting were lame.  Don't waste your money. Read the book instead; it's wonderful.
