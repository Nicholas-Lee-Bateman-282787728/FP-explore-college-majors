3786145,4,B001SO6KNS,"In the tradition of Jet Li's ""Fearless"" and ""Fist of Legend"", comes the fourth collaboration between the Wilson Yip-Donnie Yen tag team who also brought us the phenomenal ""Shah Po Lang"" in 2005. ""IP MAN"" is based on the life of the man responsible for making the Chinese kung fu style of ""Wing Chun"" (said to have been invented by a woman), which is up to this day, is among China's most revered style. Yes, Ip Man is also the man who has a huge number of talented disciples--most notably, the late great Bruce Lee.

In the 1930's, the Chinese province of Fo Shan is a thriving place of martial arts schools, with various sects of different styles. Fo Shan is said to be the place where the famous Fong Sai-Yuk learned his art and therefore this place has a reputation. Ip Man (Donnie Yen) is a very accomplished martial artist but he keeps to himself, maintains a low profile and quietly spars with friends at home. But after an acknowledged victory over a fighter from the Northern quarter, Master Jin (Fan Siu Wong), Ip Man becomes an instant hero in Fo Shan.
Time passes and in the late 1930's, following the Japanese invasion, Ip Man's property was confiscated by the Japanese army and his family is forced to live an abject existence. One day, general Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), a fanatical practitioner in Karate, witnesses the skills of this Wing Chun master. The general becomes obsessed with Ip man, and demands that the Chinese style of Wing Chun be taught to the Japanese army. But Ip man refuses and instead challenges Miura to a duel. Ip Man has to uphold the benevolence of his art and protect Chinese dignity. The battle for national pride is about to begin....

The one thing I know for sure is that Ip Man is indeed Bruce Lee's first teacher in Hong Kong for many years, and that Ip man was indeed asked to teach the Japanese; the rest of the significant historical details in this biopic is a little questionable. Yip and screenwriter Edmond Wong does get some details right, but please keep in mind that this is an action film first and foremost--it is hardly a historical drama. The action direction by Hong Kong legend Sammo Hung is indeed amazing, and it is the film's main draw. The story has the usual elements of honor, family, loyalty and pride and offers very little that is fresh--but this doesn't mean that it made the film any less exciting.

There is very minor characterization involved. The film has two acts, and the first has Ip Man's status in the Fo Shan province. He is a business man and he doesn't teach his art, there are hints that he used to compete, but he decided to keep a low profile because of his wife, Cheng (played by Lynn Hung). His relationship with his wife and son is somewhat estranged at times because of his love for sparring--she throws a tantrum whenever he fights; Ip Man is a humble man, and shows his wife the respect due her. The second act is the effect of the Japanese invasion to the Chinese people, and the hardships of Master Ip and his family--which eventually leads to the film's encounters. While Donnie Yen may indeed lack the necessary acting ability to portray him dramatically--he sure has the presence of a highly trained martial artist. Director Yip did the right thing in focusing more on fights than dramatic impact. There are also some touches of social commentary seeing as how some Chinese prey on their countrymen and they only look out for themselves.

As I've said, Sammo Hung's action choreography is indeed phenomenal and it sure helps when you have a cast of real-life martial arts practitioners and action-honed actors such as Yen, Louis Fan and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, who holds a Kuro Obi in Judo in real life. Sammo Hung maintains a nice balance between finesse, realism and downright brutality--the fights are very intense and very focused. It is a mix of the usual wire-fu and some acrobatics. Highlights include Ip Man taking on 10 Japanese fighters in one time, the fight between Fan Siu Wong and Yen is quick but exciting, complemented with some subtle doses of humorous cracks. The fights are exquisitely shot, with multiple camera angles in a perspective view to close ups, so you can see all the hard-hitting action. There are also times when an opponent is thrown in the camera's view and I thought this added a lot of style and intense attitude. Yip and company knows how to shoot and edit fight scenes to make their actors look good; it proves to be the film's main showstopper.

The action encounters are nicely placed and Wilson Yip needs to be credited for maintaining an excellent pace with its balance between action and drama. While this film is historically inaccurate, for the most part, it does succeed as an action film--a very well done at that. The film does ultimately fail as a character-driven, true-to-life biopic. Donnie Yen's ""Ip Man"" is more about his capabilities as a fighter than who he really was as a man, which is no doubt due to fact that it wanted to maintain a China-friendly film. The film's structure is more of a popcorn action film than an emotional biopic of a man who made his mark in ""using his fists"" to unite the Chinese people. It plays too fast and free to fully realize the film's potential as a ""based on true events"" type of deal.

Despite some flaws in the script, and the filmmakers relying too much on the audiences' good beliefs rather than developing Ip Man as a man than as a caricature of a folk hero; (no doubt an attempt to match Wong Fei Hung in ""Once upon a Time in China"" and Huo Yuan Jia in ""Fearless"") to portray him as an inspirational role model/saint. ""IP MAN"" is a truly exciting film which is just full of action and the energy it exudes is just so much fun to watch. I am rather very interested in seeing as to what Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen would bring ""IP MAN 2"", which would hopefully show more of his experiences in Hong Kong (which may include his time with Bruce Lee). Of course, by that time, Wong Kar-Wai's version of ""IP MAN"" will be released and will hopefully have more historical significance than action thrills.

Still, this film comes with a ""Highly Recommended"" rating from me, it does RULE as a martial arts action film. [4  Stars]

3786146,5,B001SO6KNS,"Even though I am an instructor of a Wu Tang Kung Fu school, I am quite familiar with Wing Chun. In my view, Donnie Yen plays Ip Man, Bruce Lee's master to perfection. Ip Man's Wing Chun style, with its ""economy of movement"" is beautiful and excellent. I have seen several movies by Donnie Yen but he has never played so convincingly and so competently as in this movie. This movie is certainly much superior than Donnie Yen's collections 1 and 2. The storyline is also excellent. Ip Man proves himself continuously as nobel and dignified. He even works as a common laborer when the situation becomes impossibly hard. He becomes angry only when he realises that the Japanese has been murdering his colleagues. He challenged 10 Japanese which he can easily defeat. He even defeated the Japanese champion, General San Po.  He was killed by a gun but he never flinched. Ip Man is larger than life - a true Kung Fu master. If you are a Kung Fu aficionado, watch this movie and you will be raptly entertained. Dr Jusuf Hariman.",1233705600,,1021,4.579234972677596
3786147,5,B001SO6KNS,"This is easily one of the best kung fu movie I have seen.  Donnie Yen who plays the main character in the movie, Ip Man, really shines.  He is one of the few modern day actors who actually knows martial arts.  The fighting scenes are spectacular!  Don't miss out this great movie!",1233619200,,280,4.326923076923077
3786148,5,B001SO6KNS,"This film is one of the best movies ever made about a real life and true Kung Fu Master. Donnie Yen plays the part of Yip Man, at first when I heard that a movie of Yip Man was being made and that Donnie Yen was playing the main role well I thought that he would have to learn Wing Chun for at lease a year to be believable but his Wing Chun was so good that it appeared that he had been learning Wing Chun Kung Fu for a long time. I've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times now and all I can tell you is that I can't get enough of it. Now I don't think every scene in the movie was factual or based on the life of this amazing man but I do know that Yip Man was and is the main reason why Wing Chun is even known about today. If it were not for him accepting students in Hong Kong, then Wing Chun would possibly be hidden forever. Yip Man's most famous student was the great Bruce Lee, due to his popularity people around the world learned of the great system of Kung Fu known as ""WING CHUN""",1232496000,2,989,3.8058252427184467

3786154,5,B001SO6KNS,"Of the three films in the trilogy this is the best in my view. This movie is nothing less than a masterpiece as it beings all the elements together; a great story told in a compelling way, stunning cinematography, realistic sets, believable acting, and a healthy inventory of great fight scenes.

All those properly proportioned elements add a synergistic appeal whereby the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This unforgettable film is a [somewhat] historically accurate depiction of what Bruce Lee's master, Ip Man, experienced leading up to and including the Japanese invasion of China leading up to World War II.

If you are a Star Wars fan and haven't seen many Donnie Yen films (the actor who plays the title role in Ip Man), Donnie plays the Blind Monk in Rogue One. Those weren't special effect in Rogue One when Chirrut mwe kicks butt on those Storm Troopers. Yen really moves like that, and this film (Ip Man) fully showcases this actor/Martial Arts master talents.

Or if you are into surfing, Donnie Yen (the actor) is reminiscent of Multi-year World Champion Kelly Slater.... quiet, centered, a man who has transcended the need to prove himself. You see it in his face.

Buy this movie outright, because you will likely want to enjoy it over and over, as well as share the DVD with your friends.",1512691200,,1317,4.737991266375546

3786254,5,B001SO6KNS,"'Donnie Yen' plays legendary Chinese Martial-Arts Master 'IP Man'
'IP Man' lives with his wife 'Cheung Wing-Sing' (Lynn Hung) and young son in the city of 'Foshan' they are wealthy and
live in their own home.
Their World is turned upside down in the late 30's when the invading Japanese invaders over-run the city leaving the
couple homeless and having to scrape a living.
The occupying forces are indeed a brutal regime, many residents have fleed 'Foshan' those that remain struggle to find
enough to feed themselves ad their families.
Because of the struggle for food gangs emerge adding to the strife of the residents....
IP Man's reputation has gone before him, the Japanese commander a martial-arts expert himself seeks to have his kung-fu
guards trained-up in the art of 'Wing Chun' by 'IP Man' something he is reluctant to do, ultimately the Commander will seek
to match his skills against that of his Chinese counter-part.
'IP Man' will do everything he can to protect his fellow citizens from the gangs, but more importantly will inspire his fellow
citizens to stand up to their Japanese overlords.
This is quite simply a very good film which has a strong story-line in addition to the well enacted fight sequences, there are
moments of tension and indeed moments of an emotional nature along the way that all combined will engage your attention
throughout.

3786265,2,B001SO6KNS,"The 2star is for the Blu-ray disc which is apparently not compatible with my Panasonic DMP BD60 blu-ray player. When I inserted the Blu-ray, it starts to play the previews but freezes before it can complete the menu screen.  I was going to return it as defective when a friend took the trouble of Googling this issue and found forum describing the problem and a fix that sort of works. I played with it some more and decided to keep the blu-ray - problem and all.  Here's a couple of fixes.  When the Blu-ray comes up with the FBI Warning at the beginning, I pressed the Top Menu button on my remote which bypasses all the previews and takes me to the freeze screen.  At the freeze screen I can either input 000 or push 1 followed by ok button on my remote control.  This will start the movie playing. Next problem is the movie defaults to English speaking and no subtitle.  To fix this, while movie is playing, I pressed pop-up menu button on my remote.  This will bring up the menu showing you the following menu --> main menu/scene selection/setup/extras options.  I selected setup and changed the language to Cantonese which is the original language of the movie and changed subtitle to English-full feature. Then exit out of Setup and return to the main menu option and hit play on my remote.  This takes me back to the frozen screen.  I input 000 and wait and the movie plays keeping the changes to Cantonese with English subtitles.  Fiddling with it some more, can watch deleted scenes etc. I had to type a note with these instructions and tape it to my blu-ray cover to remind myself.  The movie and martial arts is worth 5 stars.

Embarrassed but delighted my Mum gently pulled me down without responding. Then and there I fell in love with chinese martial arts.

Fast forward over 30 years later and many martial arts in between until ""Ip Man"". I have bought this movie from Amazon over 5 times to give to friends. I have never bought a movie 5 times; the closest was ""Good Will Hunting"" 3 times. As I write this, I am awaiting a neighbour to get less busy and invite me to his place for coffee and cakes.

3786333,4,B001SO6KNS,"In southern China circa 1935 the province of Foshan was famous for its martial arts schools. One street had all the school. The masters had their students practice outside to entice prospective students. Just outside of town is a man so great at kung fu he doesn't even need to teach. His name is Ip Man. He lives in a fine mansion with his wife and son and plenty of wealth to spare. Occasionally a master will come to spar with him, though Ip always wins and is most gracious to his sparing partner (though his wife disapproves). One day, a gang of rough and tumble martial artists comes to town and challenges all the schools. The gang's leader beats all of the masters and comes to Ip Man's house for the ultimate showdown. Lots of fun kung fu action ensues.

But that's only the first third of the movie. The film takes an abrupt tonal shift away from comic kung fu fighting as the Japanese invade China (putting the World in World War II). The Chinese are oppressed and a Japanese general starts a program where the locals can try out their Chinese kung fu against his Japanese martial artists. Victorious locals can win a bag of rice, a valuable commodity under Japanese occupation. Ip Man is not interested in the fights until one of his friends disappears after going to the fight.

The movie has enough story to keep a viewer interested and the fight scenes are evenly spread throughout the film so it's never long before another entertain battle erupts. I did find the tonal shift a bit jarring (though not nearly as jarring as the title card at the end explaining how the Japanese left in 1945 after China won the war!). The fights are well choreographed with straightforward photography so viewers can see the action. Another surprise to me was Ip Man's historical status. He was an actual person and went on to found a school in Hong Kong where international superstar Bruce Lee learned kung fu. I imagine this movie is highly fictionalized and have no idea which parts are true and which false. It's certainly very entertaining.",1442880000,,2043,4.6098901098901095

3786345,5,B001SO6KNS,"Not usually into Chinese movies.  But this movie was excellent and well done.  Not just a mindless kung fu movie.  Sure it had lots of action, which included some of the best and most well choreographed fight scenes I've ever seen, but it actually has a solid plot and great action.  I watched it the first time with the English dubbed over.  But it really takes away from the quality of the movie and the excellent acting.  It adds corniness that isn't in the original.  So if you can stand subtitles I'd recommend them.  If all you care about is the action then it's still excellent with them.  I immediately watched the second as I haven't been this excited about a movie in a long time, but was disappointed.

I think the best part of this movie for me is that Ip Man doesn't just win fights.  He's untouchable!  Basically a martial arts god even among masters.  I don't want a movie about someone that barely scrapes out victory.  I want to see the best ever completely destroy and annihilate his enemies.

3786383,5,B001SO6KNS,"This is my first review on Amazon. I never though a kung fu flick would make my top ten movies of all time, much less my top four, but Ip Man has achieved much more than a simple martial arts flick in both nuancing and drama.

Allow me to explain. I am going to break this review into three parts, the martial arts, the drama, and the nuancing.

I will try not to go into the plot, as it would ruin the subtleties other reviewers have already covered.

And subtle this film is.

1) Kung Fu: I will not go over the varied styles of Kung Fu, and even Movie Fu, as other reviewers have called it, other than to say diversity is key. I found myself particularly liking Jin's leg-heavy, acrobatic style--which was thrown with so much tensed rage, one could sense a caged tiger within the man. The star of the show is Ip Man, and the first time I saw him fight, I found myself straining my frontal lobes at how impeccable, how perfect, his style of form displayed. How a man can hold such a straight spine, such perfect stance, without the use of cables, special effects, and stunt men, is phenomenal in the least. I have never seen such nail-biting martial arts, to say the least. Every martial artist is phenomenal in their own right, and to pick a favorite would be like choosing between masters in a rock-paper-scissor competition. All this, without the use of stunt cables. Throughout my entire viewing, I only caught one, and it was toward the beginning of the film. The dramatization of the arts is so realistic, it defies both convention and belief, in a single inhalation--one held throughout the entire film, I might add.

2) Dramatization: This film thrives on nuances. As I said, this is my first review, and there is a reason why. This film is so steeped in nuancing, I doubt a single westerner caught more than a third of it. Warning: There may be plot spoilers ahead.

This film thrives on suspense, inasmuch as characterization. The film moves in several stages, leading up to an emotional train wreck, which I will not ruin by explanation.

SPOILER AHEAD:

A single look in the Japanese generals eyes made me know he meant death.

Sociopaths rarely gain such dead eyes. The man had come beyond tears, so distorted in his thinking, not only did violence not affect him, he was willing to die for his belief.

Few men seem as if they are walking on a tightrope towards their doom.

I sensed a man on a death march, walking into oblivion, and at one point I found myself uttering an atheist prayer that he found his soul, and learned the art of mercy and compassion.

Throughout the film, Ip Man shows both restraint and compassion; the general, the Japanese, is quite his opposite.

Willing to fall on his own sword to prove his ego.

I found myself sobbing toward the middle of the film, and hysterically numb toward the end--I simply could not contain the nuances, the layers of what I had seen. Few people realize Asian cultures thrive on nuances. Rather than say no, they will 'think about it,' and offer a meal in return for rejection.

Eyes speak. Ip Man rarely blinks, but excessive eye contact can be construed as a threat in China, Japan, and elsewhere.

Nor will a Chinese man tell you no. They will tell you they will, 'think about it.'

Many westerners glazed over the film expecting action, and foregoing culture.

This is a film where a single step can mean death.

Needless to say, the restraint (Spoiler again!) at the end of the first film went over many westerner's heads.

Which leads me to my next point.

3) Nuancing: this film speaks through micro-expressions. A small flick of the eyes, a single step forward, is a challenge.

One that often ends in death.

In a movie where most of the story is told in body language, body movements, flicks of the eyes--verbal communication plays a minor role.

The entire ""affect,"" the inflection of the film, led to nail biting tension.

Oriental culture shows restraint. No rednecks puffing out chests and pounding them, ""Hey Buddy!"" Subtleties. Subtleties, only.

It is no wonder this film went over so many westerner heads. In the west, people are used to verbalizing their feelings.

In the east, eyes hooded like a cobra are meant to conceal feelings, and a tiny inflection of vocal tone or movement can be construed as a challenge. No large-scale macro movements. Only tiny micro expressions, leading to heart palpitations, where one must read subtlely between the lines.

This movie honors both subtlety and respect, but a great deal of nonverbal restraint, especially the ending, which I will not spoil.

I daresay, this entire film speaks in a kind of narrative symbolism, in which one either grasps the tiny nuances of respect, and Asiatic culture, or finds themselves meandering the seas of not-knowing. Either way, this film has something for everyone: Action, Drama, and Suspense.

If your hand is hovering above the ""Buy It"" button, do it now.

There is nothing else in western, or dare I say eastern even, like it. Ip Man is one of a kind.

Kindly,

A Fan.",1429920000,,5040,4.6206509539842875

3786393,5,B001SO6KNS,"Wing Chun is the master of martial arts, better than everyone in his town and seemingly there are no humans that can take down the Master of martial artsor could I be wrong? First, its a martial arts film, theres going to be fighting. The fight scenes in the film are some of the most impressive in comparison with other cinematographers and the film-making process from beginning to end.

I mean, every hit, move, punch, flip  and spin has a cause and effect(like dirt flying around, sounds to help with the visuals), the color correction and how they used color in the film was impressive and creative.

IP Man kept me on the edge of my seat with tension. It provided entertainment, action and it was fast pace, for the most part(for me thats important because I don't find movies that drag on to reach a point, worth my time, you have to have me within the first ten minutes or I might get turned off, quickly). IP Man is absolutely painstaking in every aspect possible, from mastering the arts, to filming, lighting, coloring and even choreography. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for something fast pace and similar to the Chan man.

This is one of a few (I think) martial art movies that goes beyond martial art courage and bravado. It is human spirit unyielding in the worst possible conditions. I of course watched IM 2 and the Final Fight. They were also great, and in a sense gave the background to a story ""behind the story"" of Bruce Lee. Master Lee is only slightly noted at the end of the third movie; this series is a solid knock out presentation of what life was probably like for the Master Ip, and how he overcame much loss and pain and to be a great martial fighter.
He was also the teacher of one who is certainly a vanguard for martial arts as we know it today.",1426636800,,773,4.194630872483222

3786427,5,B001SO6KNS,"Ip Man is an awesome film, man. ""Good kung fu doesn't depend on age or sex, but on how well you fight. You will know later."" It starts off very idyllic, with Ip Man sashaying around like a good Confucian gentleman, before clouds form and life gets really tough. The kung fu is simply amazing, and the story gets interesting too. Interesting touches, like the one character who is a traitor yelling out ""I am Chinese"" in Japanese. The fight scenes have incredible choreography, and we really feel like we're there with Donnie Yen.

I was not familiar with Donnie Yen as an actor, but he has great physical presence and star power, and plays a kung fu grandmaster to perfection. I especially love his battle with the braggart Northerner kung fu mercenary trying to establish a school in Foshan. The film is well-cast, although a few areas are less good - the Japanese are just a bit too creepy, and the Japanese actor who plays the commander of the Japanese occupational forces in Foshan, general Miura - a man who at least seems to have some sort of a moral compass - is just a bit too young for the role.

The bonus features are not very good, though. ""The Making of Ip Man"" (18:40) is a bunch of interviews with the actors, technicians and creators of the film, is all about praising everyone involved, except maybe for Sammo Hung, the action director, who also provides his praise with a bit of a sting. There are a few short features that are really just dressed up commercials and glamour shots of the actors and sets, often without any English language or subtitles. The deleted scenes are good, though - we see Ip Man on a bike, a fight between Ip Man and Master Ho, a scene of the Northern mercenary selling Ip Man to the Japanese, and a bloody riot at the end that shows a few characters being killed off (somewhat different than the film's end). We also get a beautiful scene of Miura committing seppuku, with the camera from the top showing the pool of blood spilling out.

One caveat, though - even though the producers involves Ip Man's real son Ip Chun here, the film is not entirely historical, especially the action embellishments, and trying to separate fact from fiction is probably too difficult. It's probably better to watch the film as a piece of entertainment, and to seek out other material about the real Ip Man, kung fu teacher to Bruce Lee, to find out more about the man himself.",1422316800,,2406,4.5264367816091955

3786518,4,B001SO6KNS,"Very Good movie - as advertised. However, I must say - I was disappointed when I read the Wiki entry and found out that the movie is BASED on the Ip Man - but most of this didn't happen. He hid out in Hong Kong during the war and Japanese occupation of China - he didn't courageously stay and fight for his people - that would have been fruitless and pointless. It is really very well made and very well acted, but particularly towards the end, it reminded me of propaganda films. For instance, the films states that the Japanese were defeated eventually - and implies that the Chinese did this and Americans are not even mentioned, although there was no coherent state in place to even fight the Japanese at the time - the U.S. saved them - not only from Japanese aggression, but then from Russia trying to seize as much of China as possible. It's a minor point, but it limits the audience for this film. I'd recommend Kung Fu Hustle if you want some comedy, or others if you want more action. This is very good if you want to absorb some culture and history and it's more of a real drama. It's success spawned sequels and an entire wave of imitators, using his name only. At least his eldest son advised and helped on this one. It's definitely worth a look - there is a lot of character development not often seen in this genre.",1406246400,2,1330,4.324

It was really relevant to me as I had an aunt who was a missionary doctor in China at the time they were invaded by Japan.  It was informative to see China as it was prior to the war and how WW2 impoverished many in the country.  Of course, many who were foreign nationals were repatriated to their own countries during the war, as was my aunt.  It was interesting to see that from the Chinese perspective their was significant corruption among the British rulers of Hong Kong after the war.",1403568000,,640,4.352941176470588

3786541,5,B001SO6KNS,"I've watched this movie at least a dozen times and it's just as good every time that I view it. Donnie Yen delivers in this biopic of Bruce's Master Ip Man. Ip, while a martial arts genius in his own right, avoids conflict and even goes so far as to not teach martial arts. He practices and studies for his own health and physical protection. He lives comfortably with his wife and young son. While he seems to have his wife's support, she would like him to spend more of the time he dedicates to the study of Wing Chun on his young son, who at one point ignores him.

So while this wealthy man seeks to live a life of quiet, out of the spotlight, conflict has a way of finding those who crave solace and thrusting them into confrontation. Foshan, renowned for it's martial arts master and practitioners, is where Ip Man lives. An aggressive master comes and competes against other masters and dispatches them with relative ease. The reputation of Foshan seem to be tarnished but the young aggressive master is laughed at by a tavern owner while having lunch, and is told, 'you haven't faced the best, Ip Man.'

When the young upstairs learns of Ip Man he challenges him. He insults Ip in the presence of his wife who takes offense and she responds to Ip to 'not break my things;"" fully confident in his abilities. Ip quickly dispatches the challenger but a darker enemy looms.  That is the Japanese army and occupation of Foshan and a great many other parts of China.

With thrilling action and well choreographed fight scenes, Ip Man explodes as a man of great stature looking to remain in the quiet of his own home becomes a hero. The emotional impact of lost and the collision of two society's paradigms and way's of living and fighting make for an interesting look into the history of a time of aggression and oppression in the history of Japan and China. It is a trip through time that reaffirms that the deeds of one man while not totally solitary can make a difference and create change where opportunity seems as improbable as a trip to the moon without a space ship. Seeing the skill and power of Ip Man through the guise of Donnie Yen makes you believe in the legend of Bruce Lee. Because such a great and celebrated figure must have learned from a man this damned good!

I highly recommend this film if you love Kung Fu flicks. I also recommend for any Bruce Lee fan because Ip displays the style of Wing Chun which isn't as widely known as White Crane and Tiger style. And most certainly for those who enjoy history told from the perspective of how it affect a smaller group of the population.",1401235200,,2606,4.454926624737945

3786543,5,B001SO6KNS,Ip Man movies with Donnie Yen are hard to beat. This quickly became one of our favorites. Every time we watch it we're amazed again. The action scenes are amazing. Not just the action but the writing and acting are really great. These movies made me look into Donnie Yen's work. Some of them are great but the Ip Man ones are the best for sure.,1401062400,,344,4.2272727272727275

3786546,2,B001SO6KNS,"I liked the movie until the end. I guess I'll put ""spoiler alert"" even though I've seen this part of the story in other reviews. So, Ip Man beats a Japanese general in a martial arts duel and this makes the Chinese rally and fight. And a line shows up that the Japanese unconditionally surrendered in 1945. I guess the USA had nothing to do with that surrender, huh. I know they take liberties in ""inspired by a true story"" movies, but everything I've found about it shows it's as close to a true story as Fargo was. It's an entertaining enough movie, I just wish I hadn't seen the blurbs at the end.",1400544000,,600,4.271929824561403

3786567,1,B001SO6KNS,"First off, the movie is pretty good for martial arts.  But I kinda feel like Amazon dropped the ball on this one.

The first copy I received would freeze during play.  I couldn't even watch the ending!  So I sent it back and Amazon replaced it.  The second copy that Amazon sent me played fine, but the case for the movie was damaged.  Didn't want to go through the hassle of sending this one back so I kept it.

3786593,5,B001SO6KNS,"The movie that propelled Donnie Yen into international stardom and gave birth to a legend is inspired by the true story of Bruce Lee's mentor and is one of the greatest martial arts movies of all time.

The story depicts Ip Man being challenged by a notorious martial artist who had defeated nearly all the martial arts masters in Foshan in tournaments to find a worthy opponent and prove his skill, only to find himself badly defeated by Ip. This gives rise to Ip's soaring popularity among the people who, slowly but surely, sought him out to be their master and provide them martial arts instruction.

It, then, focuses on the growing hardship faced by the Chinese people at the hands of Japanese aggressors who continually engage Chinese martial arts practitioners in matches in return for a sack of rice for every victory over their Japanese opponents, leading to innumerable being seriously injured and some tragic deaths on the part of the Chinese.

Unable to withstand the bullying at the hands of the Japanese, Ip Man takes on all of the Japanese martial artists in a match where he easily defeats them, inducing, resultant of this, a desire by the Japanese general to challenge him to a duel. Ip defeats the general in a death blow and gets shot by the general's henchman.

Based on a true story, Ip Man is truly a martial arts action masterpiece to be treasured.",1391990400,,1373,4.708333333333333

In fact, after watching it for a while, you kind of forget that you are reading sub titles.  Its the story of an interesting but normally humble man who also happens to be the finest master of kung fu in the known area.  He is a fairly wealthy man before the Japanese invasion of the Chinese mainland in the 1930s.  The story moves from a prosperous small town backdrop with Kung Fu as an interesting hobby to the struggles to survive during a military occupation.  It turns out the invading general in the area is a fan of martial arts and things start to get really interesting.  You likely already know that the lead character in the movie is actually the man who eventually taught the future superstar, Bruce Lee, personally.

High production values, top notch choreography and a good story (even if some of the facts are bent a little, but the story did make me research Ip Man's actual life, so it was a learning experience as well). Even so I am certain that Donnie Yen captured Ip Man's personality and essence.

I just finished watching it, and, I must admit, what I was told is true. Cinematically, this is a beautifully rendered film; from scenery to wardrobe it just looks great. The story is compelling, moving, and inspirational; and, most important, the martial arts is kick-ass!

I have no background in Wing Chun so I can't tell if it was authentic. But it did look spectacular (especially the chain-punching) and really got my attention.

3786649,1,B001SO6KNS,"I liked this movie at the start, with its bustling Chinese streets and diverse array of personalities that gave it a much more well rounded feel than a lot of other movies set in similar places. However, the more that I watched the wooden acting of Donnie Yen, listened to the insipidly written dialogue of his wife, and noticed little kids in occupied China practicing kung fu in cardigans that don't even look like they've had the Banana Republic tags removed, the less engaged I was. The martial arts scenes became increasingly stylized as the plot progressed; by the time Yen starts fighting the Japanese, he looks more like he's giving them some strange form of massage than actually fighting. The biggest shocker to me, however, was that the Chinese in fact won their long war against Japan on 15 Aug 1945, after being galvanized by Ip Man's nickle-plated fists to overthrow their oppressors. Kung fu, of course, is what did the trick.",1383782400,3,941,4.779141104294479

3786670,5,B001SO6KNS,"Since the century started there have not been many great martial arts films. So much so that I have moved away from the genre. The only two films that come to mind as great are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jet-Li-s-Fearless/dp/B000N4KENG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jet Li's Fearless</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon/dp/B008Y76VEK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>. I believe this film surpasses them both, and that is a pretty tall order.

Not only has this movie a compelling story and intense dramatic moments, delivered by a cast whose performances shine, but also, the pure martial arts elements are superbly choreographed and feel realistic. The calm demeanor Ip Man possesses throughout most of the movie makes this even better, since it lets the viewer appreciate the beauty of the art.

The writers did a great job in taking the real like of Yip Man, Bruce Lee's master, and create a semi-biographical story. The facts and fiction blend well and it is hard to really know where ones end and the others begin without researching the truth. Last but not least, I was mostly impressed by Donnie Yen. He was part of the cast in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hero/dp/B00742BVW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hero</a>, another very good martial arts movie, but his performance was not as memorable as what I saw here.

3786689,5,B001SO6KNS,"While searching through Netflix for something to watch the other night, I came across this movie. Judging from the cover picture, I guessed this movie was yet another over-blown, outrageous, ultra-violent and angry martial arts movie. In other words, I didn't have high hopes for it. After watching it for a half hour, though, I realized this movie was nothing like I expected. It was a rather calm, serious historical fiction movie that was based on actual events. The acting was good, the sets were good, and the fight choreography was the best I've ever seen. This movie had none of the supernatural Kung fu silliness of people jumping from building to building or kicking other people through walls or catching sword blades with their bare hands or stuff like that.

The fight scenes were fast and furious and really a marvel to watch. I was unfamiliar with the actors or the director or anyone else in the movie, but everyone involved with it impressed me.

The one thing that is a bit of a mystery to me is the R rating. This movie had two or three swear words and not much blood. Though there was a lot of Kung fu action, most of it was bloodless. There were a couple of shootings, but only one death by shooting. I think the R rating was too strong. A PG-13 rating would have been plenty strong. I would have no problem letting my 13-year old daughter or 11-year old son watch this movie. The lead character is a married man of morals, principles, discipline and honor, and that is a rare thing in movies, these days.

The original language version (Cantonese/Mandarin/Japanese, with English subtitles) conveys the passion of the actors that is missing in the English dubbed version and communicates the passion of the film, making it a very involving and touching experience.

Original language version:  very highly recommended.
English dubbed version:  forget about it.",1370649600,,549,5.8125
3786700,5,B001SO6KNS,"I got around to finally seeing this and must say I've become a big Donnie Yen fan. The movie based on the real life Ip Man was done excellent and the fight scenes were second to none. It was a real treat to hear the various actors nd director for their take on the movie and working with each other.

Two of those ""behind the scenes' stood out and made me appreciate the movie even more...

Donnie Yen had to learn the Wing Chun style of fighting from scratch. He was so thurough in research, studing and doing the Wing Chun moves that traditional practionist of Wing Chun were so impressed with his demostration in front of them they thought he had been doing it for years. He got all ""108"" moves done on the Wooden Wing Tsun Dummy right.

Second was the actor who protrays the Kung Fu Japaneese General in the movie, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi didn't know much of actual Martial Art like Kung Fu and Wing Chun. He does hold a Black Belt in Judo

I guess I'll snag Ip Man 2 after seeing this one...well worth it for any martial art movie fan.",1370476800,2,1033,4.255102040816326

It was a real treat watching him portray Ip Man. You can look up the synopsis on wiki or something. But the action sequences in this film are incredible and very explosive. The music score brings real passion into every scene and truly puts this story in your heart. This is the tale of a man who stands up for what is right and the representation of a country's honor.

I am a huge fan of Yen's and although his acting skills in previous movies have never jumped to the top of the list of what I love about him, they are on full display here.  For most of us that crave Martial Arts action in movies, we have to lower our expectation of plot and character development, and we know there probably isn't going to be an award winning dramatic performance by the guy going around kicking people's you know what.  There are a few exceptions to this and Ip Man is without a doubt one of those.

I didn't know much about the real story of Ip Man so I can't say too much about the historical accuracy of this movie.  I can guess that some creative license was taken but in the end I wasn't watching this looking for a documentary.  What we do get is brilliant acting, awesome fight choreography, character development, and a very moving story.

3786764,4,B001SO6KNS,"If you're looking for a great martial arts film, it's unlikely you'll be disappointed with this one. A friend recommended it to me after I mentioned how much I liked Raid: The Redemption. In Ip Man, Donnie Yen plays Ip, a martial arts master that refuses to open a school until the Japanese take over the city. When thugs begin to harass and rob the employees of a factory that belongs to his brother-in-law, Ip teaches the staff how to defend themselves and is ultimately invited to fight against Japanese martial artists for sport against Japanese fighters. The winner receives rice. Ip initially refuses, but when his close friend beats the Japanese in the ring and is subsequently  murdered, he decides to go in an effort to find out what happened.

The film is well-written and well-directed. It starts a little slow, but the characters are set up well, including Ip's wife who begins the film disgruntled about how much time Ip spends practicing his martial arts with others while his young son feels neglected. The fight scenes are well shot and well choreographed, even though I find them a bit too stylized and prefer those in The Raid: Redemption. Donnie Yen does a wonderful job playing the character of Ip Man. The Japanese characters are a bit stereotyped and flat, but it's not enough to pull you out of the movie.",1355443200,,1328,4.719827586206897

3786771,5,B001SO6KNS,"To say this is good for a foreign movie or to say that this is a good kung fu movie just don't do it justice.  This is just hands down a good movie.

It has a compelling true story, set against the backdrop of the Japanese occupation of China.  Well filmed, with great action set pieces and a number of satisfying subplots, the movie is compelling from it's first frame.  The film is held together by a strong performance by lead actor Donnie Yen who radiates a serene and purposeful self confidence throughout the film.

The story is told in a way that you feel everything he is going through, I don't want to say much else as to not give out the story but this is one of the best kung fu movies I have seen and Donnie Yen is spectacular in his performance.",1352592000,,379,4.053333333333334
3786773,5,B001SO6KNS,"Usually when you watch a kung fu movie (especially those made in China), a lot of them have overly exaggerated fighting sequences, hilariously obnoxious sound effects, horrible dubbing, and terrible overracting -this movie has none of that. First thing to address is Ip Man himself. Ip Man and his students are responsible for training the critically acclaimed martial artist, Bruce Lee. Many of his students not named Bruce Lee have become regionally recognized as outstanding martial artists and have gone to teach others. This shows also the heart of where Bruce got his martial arts understanding. Ip Chun (the son of Ip Man) and Bruce Lee have both expressed that Ip Man taught that there is no best martial art, only the best martial artist. Wing Chun is one of the most popular styles of southern kung fu thanks a lot to Ip Man and his students *wink* *wink*. Donnie Yen does a good job portraying the Kung Fu master and the art of Wing Chun in general. Even though Wing Chun isn't his background, he did a lot of work with Ip Chun and portrays many aspect of the Su Lim Tao, chi sao, and bo gerk accurately. Plus Donnie's acting in general is very good.

Next, The fight scenes are made to be highly realistic and high paced while capable of keeping you in suspense. The fight with 10 black belts is one of the best martial arts scenes in contemporary film. I won't spoil everything, but even though it is a choreographed fight, it doesn't bore you with the overdramatic nature of most martial arts films.

Lastly, the plot is extremely cohesive and engaging. Like I said before, this probably has some of the best acting performances out of any other martial arts films that I've seen: as a standalone film, its very entertaining on its own. It is historically accurate to a degree, though there are many embellishments to the story to fit the film genre. It has great pacing and you don't feel like its setting you up for the next fight scene. Go watch it now - its worthy of all the accolades its received and belongs to every film library.",1349222400,,2051,4.5858310626703

The action however, was very impressive, as good as any modern movie, and better. My only criticism was the final fight should have been the best, and I don't believe it was. Also, don't expect to watch this one for realism. All of the fights are pretty much one sided, and If I am not mistaken the hero actually only gets hit once throughout the entire movie, so.

The whole movie is full of non-sequiturs like this, deus-ex machina, and the story generally lacks reasoning and logic.

Found out my A-Prime includes Instant Video and thought I would give 'Ip Man' a shot.  Hollywood can say what they want, Mandarin Films and Donny Yen absolutely blew me away!

The Production Quality is excellent, yet the film is able to create that ""Old Time Sunday Afternoon Kung Fu Theater"" feel, minus the cheese.  Sure there is some added drama to the historical record, but the philosophy of Ip Man and Wing Cun is very much in tact. Donny Yen's technique is outstanding, and the fight scenes are not too over the top or lengthy. (That.. IS Wing Chun)

This film shows the hardships and struggles that we must face and the importance of staying grounded while working through things.  Try to stay good to our fellow man in spite of the situation you may find them or yourself in.

Hardcore Martial Arts (especially Kung Fu) fans should love this picture.

A great Action Film with some historical value and a good message for those looking for an evening's entertainment as well.

The eponymous focal figure Ip Man, drawn straight out of the history books, is the peaceful model of restraint and self-control. His easy smile, passive existence and unmatched skills make him very easy to pull for, especially when a trying second act pushes him past the breaking point, but the flick's deep reverence for his legacy strips away any chances at suspense or tension. Though gorgeously choreographed and filmed, the major fight scenes are universally one-sided, with Ip himself rarely absorbing more than a few glancing blows on his way to flashily disarming and dispensing each opponent. Even his last foe, a towering Japanese army general who effortlessly conquers three of Ip's peers at once, leaves behind little more than a cloud of dust and a disappointed, unspoken ""is that it?"" when he quietly takes a knee.

3786840,2,B001SO6KNS,"I'm a bit stunned that folks rate this so highly. I'm not talking about its merits as a set of fight scenes, which are mostly great. But you can't just ignore all the irresponsible crap that surrounds these scenes. I'm talking about the fact that Ip Man is just another in a recent string of shameless big-budget propaganda-like films coming out of China (""Hero"" is another example, though Ip Man is much more blatant and troubling).

Look, normally I would be the last person to overanalyze a kung fu flick, let alone chastise filmmakers for taking on historical atrocities. But this movie sees itself as much more than just a kung fu flick, and that's the problem. I realize that what the Japanese did to the Chinese before/during WWII was horrific. And I also understand that U.S. studios are just as capable of putting out pugilistic propaganda as the Chinese (Rocky IV, anyone?). But there are important differences that make Ip Man truly shameless and worthy of criticism, from its blatant hypocrisy (the autocratic Chinese lecturing the Japanese about being ""civilized"" when they massacre their own people in Tiananmen Square and are consistently ranked among the world's top oppressors by numerous human-rights organizations? You've GOT to be kidding me!) to near-delusional historical revisionism (at the end of the movie, the narrator proudly declares that the Chinese forced the Japanese surrender in 1945!) to implicit racism (the movie doesn't just criticize past Japanese imperialism; it also tries to make a case for intrinsic Chinese superiority, then and now). The fact that top-shelf actors and martial artists lent their talents to such an enterprise, and that many reviewers are praising them for doing so, is truly disturbing to me.

Regardless of the degree of fidelity to the life of the historical Ip Man to which this treatment may aspire, to me it is wonderful.  I see this as a work evoking an aristocratic ideal with which we Westerners can identify--and I assume is meaningful to Eastern cultures as well.  The protagonist, born to rank and privilege, devotes himself to the martial arts tradition of southern China (that is, Canton).  Only reluctantly does he allow himself to be drawn into the fray populated by lesser beings--be they thugs and robbers, or the rapacious Japanese occupiers.  He meets each challenge, in turn, with a superior calm--his most severe gesture being that of rolling up his sleeve a few inches.  His reserve, compassion, and graceful dispatching of his opponents evokes an ideal so potent that even high-ranking officers devoted to the fanatical cult of the Japanese Emperor are cowed by the moral victory he achieves in a martial arts duel with an arrogant (though somewhat gallant) Japanese General.",1324425600,,1236,4.946859903381642

Plot review: Chinese propaganda movie set between 1930-1940 of kung-fu legend Ip Man. Multiple hand to hand combat scenes that incease steadily in violence, escalating to broken limbs and brutal gun shot to the head. If you can get past the bad taste the blatant misinformation provided at the end of the movie leaves, you may enjoy a decent martial arts flick.

3786878,4,B001SO6KNS,"Disclaimer: I viewed this film as a streaming rental, and as such cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the disc.  My review has to do with the entertainment value of the film only.

There's probably not a great need for another positive review of 'Ip Man', other than the opportunity to pile on the recommendations.  Still, there are a couple of points one might want to consider when deciding whether to take a chance on it or not.

First, if you are already a fan of martial art films, then this is an excellent choice.  While I don't watch a ton of them, I was very impressed with the action sequences here, coupled with the production quality.  Like many movies of this type, there is not a tremendous amount of depth to the story - down and out good guy vs. a bad guy who has all the odds in his favor, yet the good guy wins out.  That's it in a nutshell, which is the formula for a lot of genre pictures, whether martial arts or American westerns.  But if you don't demand that every film you watch plumb the depths of the human condition, and are looking for a simple action film, then this one does it extremely well.

Ip Man was a genuine historical figure, and his particular variation of Kung Fu was called Wing Chun - and among his students was a young Bruce Lee.  This made me wonder how much of the rest of this story was true-to-life, though the only help that Wikipedia gives is that ""the film takes a number of liberties with Yip's life, often for dramatic effect"".  Now you know as much as I do - probably best to take most of the sequences as the process of mythologizing a folk hero.  Not that there's anything wrong with that!

One last note: The service I streamed this rental from had the original Cantonese and Japanese audio.  From a few of the other reviewers, it seems as if Amazon only offers this in a dubbed version.  Depending on how important the audio is to you may make Amazon's version best, or not.  The service I streamed from starts with an N and ends with an etflix.",1321747200,,2017,4.310344827586207
3786879,5,B001SO6KNS,This film has some of the best fight scenes I have seen in a while. And the fact that it's based on a true story makes it even better.,1321315200,,134,3.6551724137931036
3786880,5,B001SO6KNS,"NOTE: I streamed this video.

 This is an excellent film that focuses on the virtue of martial arts and its peaceful nature. This movie is mainly about a man that, through his martial arts, rallied the Chinese people against the oppressive Japanese forces during the Second Sino-Japanese war (same time frame as WWII).
 This movie mainly shows the path of Ip man before and during the war. How he went from being a fairly wealthy individual before the war, to little more than a peasant during it; and how he struggled to support his family during Japan's occupation of China.

 I don't want to give any of the movie away, but I found this movie to be very enjoyable. It's not the glamorized mindless violence garbage that Hollywood puts out. However, there is a lot of excellent martial arts action during this movie.

I was insulted at the end when it essentially gave China full credit for defeating the Japanese in WWII.  I went on to read several reviews about the historical inaccuracy of the movie, especially the portrayal of the main character.  Ordinarily I don't get too worked up over historical inaccuracy (I've come to expect this from movies, and generally I'm just looking to be entertained).  Between the ending and the subsequent reviews I was overwhelmed/reminded of the horrible things the Chinese goverment has done with its heavy-handed propaganda.

3786905,5,B001SO6KNS,"I miraculously managed to convince my wife to watch Ip Man through a game of rock-paper-scissors, and at first I began to feel bad about my decision; should the movie turn out to be terrible, I'd have a heck of a time convincing my wife to watch a movie of my choosing in the future.

At first the movie started fun, albeit a little cheesy; it really seemed like a mediocre martial-arts import movie, and I almost turned it off. However, the plotline takes a major turn delving into WWII, and turns into a moving and entertaining piece of cinema. I won't give too much away, since the surprise the plot took made me appreciate that much more, but I will state that this is a must-see piece.

The action is incredibly well-done throughout most of the movie, aside from a few moments which weren't quite as believable. However, this really brought back a more believable aspect to martial arts while still showcasing a greater than human approach (I was getting sick of the Crouching Tiger or Matrix style of martial arts cinema at this point). The acting is well done, with the characters fitting their intentionally stereotypical roles well.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie; this is definitely going into my top choices for movies. My wife, who can't stand action movies, and would never watch a Bruce-Lee movie no matter how much I pleaded, enjoyed this movie.

I have read other reviews of the a third movie which say its terrible and not worth the money.

3786917,2,B001SO6KNS,"Imagine that you sit down to watch a film titled ""Mickey Mantle's List."" The description of the film says ""Inspired by the life of baseball great Mickey Mantle."" In the film, Mickey travels to Germany, where his uncle owns a factory, and uses it to save lots of Jews. Then, in a baseball challenge, a Nazi general tries to strike him out, but he hits a home run. As a result, Americans back home are inspired, and launch D-Day. At the end of the film Mickey goes home to hit a lot of homers for the Yankees (while the crowd chants ""U.S.A.""). Your reaction is ""the story was like 'Inglorious Basterds 2,' but the tone was completely serious. Also, isn't Mickey Mantle's actual life good enough?"" Your friend replies:

""You just don't get it. Mickey Mantle was a hero, and he loved his wife. This movie might take some liberties but the important parts are true. Also, these are the best baseball scenes ever filmed in a movie. God bless America.""

So, yeah, that's basically what's going on in this film. I know most American viewers won't really care, and they try to get into it as fantasy. But I lived in China for three years, so I just wanted to put this review on here. In real life Ip Man lived in his mansion throughout the war, worked as a policeman because he liked it (not because he needed the money), and obviously never fought a general or whatever (or escaped afterwards, lol). He left for Hong Kong after the war, only because he was rich and the communists were confiscating people's property. I'm not knocking the guy, he certainly was incredible at martial arts, and I'm a Bruce Lee fan. Just weird to see this Chinese nationalism be so popular in the U.S. suddenly (these kinds of movies are on Chinese TV all day, though lower budget of course).

So, with that done, let me review it as a fantasy kung fu movie real quick. The early fight scenes are really well done, though the later ones are a bit rushed. Donnie Yen gives a great performance. The visual look isn't so great: the sets don't look like real buildings, and a lot of the scenes that are supposed to be outside are clearly inside. In fantasy movies that's fine, but then they throw in the WWII setting which is trying to be a real time and place, and it distracts from the fantasy.",1316131200,20,2265,4.439903846153846

This movie is certainly one worth being on the movie collectors shelf.

Being Blueray is also nice as it guarantees quality playback for the foreseeable future. I'm not sure how many extra features the special addition has but the added disk gives more info into behind the scenes aspects of the film, worth getting this version if you have an extra interest in martial arts/ Wing Tsun (Chun). If you think of this movie as another great ass kicking film to sit along side your other cult classics then the standard version will still satisfy.

Ip Man 1 is certainly the best out of the trilogy.",1315353600,,874,4.560509554140127
3786922,4,B001SO6KNS,"Watching a Hong Kong action films is a hit-and-miss affair. Some are great, some so-so, others just terrible, and ever-prolific actor Donnie Yen is no exception. As for his 2008 film ""Ip Man,"" an action-packed bio-pic loosely based on the life of the martial arts legend Ip Man (and master of Bruce Lee), this is definitely a hit.

Set in the bustling city of the 1930s Foshan, the movie follows the story of Ip Man (Donnie Yen), a mild-mannered martial arts grandmaster respected in the community, whose life undergoes a drastic change when Japanese army invades China. Now impoverished, Ip Man works at a coal mine, where some of the workers are chosen by the Japanese soldiers to fight at the dojo of the Japanese general and karate practitioner Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi).

One of the greatest assets of the film is, of course, its powerful martial arts fight sequences choreographed by Sammo Hung, especially the two battles between Donnie Yen and Fan Siu-wong as the leader of travelling martial arts fighters challenging Ip Man.  It is also notable that Donnie Yen has successfully created a unique heroic figure, an accomplished martial arts master of the Wing Chun style, who is also a wealthy family man. His likable portrayal of Ip Man greatly helps make the character believable, together with Donnie Yen's amazing martial arts skills (including the super-fast punching that will be seen in the sequel again).

The storyline itself is pretty familiar, but acceptable. One thing I didn't like about the film is its rather short climax. Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, himself a judo practitioner, does his best as a Japanese general and karate fighter, but as a martial artist he is obviously no match for seasoned professional like Donnie Yen. ""Ip Man"" needs someone more convincing as a fighter, like Hiroyuki Sanada or actors of that caliber.

Still, ""Ip Man"" is an exciting martial arts action film, much better than Donnie Yen's previous ""Flash Point."" With the excellent musical score of Kenji Kawai, ""Ip Man"" is one of the most impressive action films from the Hong Kong film industry of the new millennium. Also, don't forget the sequel where Sammo Hung himself appears opposite Donnie Yen.",1315008000,,2193,4.98087431693989

You can't really do both efficently, so I don't mind...rather appreciate the dubbing",1311552000,,345,4.75
3786929,4,B001SO6KNS,"Based strictly on the acting, action and quality of the movie, Ip Man deserves a 5. Donnie Yen does a phenomenal job portraying the use of Wing Chun as a useable fighting style. His technique sticks to the fundamentals of the style with only a few dramatic embellishments for cinematic effect. Also, no weird flying stuff, thank goodness.
The fights in the movie are intense and powerful, with enough of them to keep the action junkie happy, while still giving room for the plot. This is really one of the better ""Kung Fu"" movies I've seen in a while.
So why only 4 stars? Well I have a real problem with the Communist Chinese government trying to make some kind of folk hero out of the Grandmaster of a Martial Arts style I trained in for 5 years. Ip Man was known as a very good fighter, and was known to take on challengers, but wasn't some lordly gentleman. At the time of when the movie was supposed to take place he was a policeman, and after the war he had to flee to Hong Kong, without his family, because he supported an opposition party. This is a little nit-picky I know, but the point of the production company is clear as day. 1.) Pick one of the classic ""bad guys"", which will be a.) the Japanese, b.) the Ching Dynasty or c.) Westerners attempting to import drugs or export valuable artifacts. 2.) Make the hero a simple, down to earth common man who is always pleasant and respective of ""proper"" authority. 3.) Have a lot of heavy handed moments involving Chinese culture, strength, underestimated superiority and of course the need for unity. Over the years the Communists have found a way to make money off of their culture and to subtly push their message into all forms of media. Ip Man was a kick ass street brawler, not an iconic poster boy for the Revolution, and that just bothers me a little.

Pros:
AWESOME fights
Great Wing Chun action
Actual acting and plot. Donnie Yen may be a better actor/action star than Jet Li, Jackie Chan or Chow Yun Fat combined.

Cons:
Stinks of commie. Unless you are a history buff you probably won't notice it; which is probably the point.",1311465600,5,2096,4.484293193717278

I didn't think I would see anything that could live stand up in overall quality and appeal of those two movies; this one does. I even showed it to my wife (who is not crazy about these types of movies) and she liked it very much. That says a lot.

So I highly recommend you see this. If you like the overall feel, mood and quality of Jet Li's best, along with the skill and effect of Bruce Lee, you will definitely like this.

Also, the sequel (IP Man 2) is just about as good and the prequel (although not with Donnie Yen) is also very good and gives context to the characters before IP Man 1.

Also, I believe IP man was a very dedicated and humble man which I got from Donnies character.  I purchased the Blue Ray version for nothing more than the HD.  The picture in HD is great and clean with no hiccups like the DVD version- unless you upscaled it, otherwise horizontal bars and jaggys would appear.  The picture is much more 3 dimensional than the DVD version as should be.  However, I probably wouldn't expect it to start up without hitch unless you have a new blue ray player.

Great story line from beginning to end, it really gets you involved with the characters, and has you rooting for the good guys.  I'm glad they were not as graphic in the movie, or depicted how japan really treated the Chinese when they invaded; I think that would have put the movie on another level, and I am glad they gave you just enough oppression as to fuel your hatred as much as the main characters.

I watched the subtitled version and I was riveted to the screen. Epic story and so gripping I was completely blown away. Then, I wanted to share that amazement with my brother, who is not much of a reader, and he had a hard time keeping up with the subtitles so we switched over to dubbed. God awful. I was so disappointed.

Anyway, there is at least one single star review because of the dubbing so I am happy to give this 5 stars and let the other reviewer warn those concerned about why a great movie like this would get one star.

Not all historical movies are made as well as this one. The fighting is first class and the acting is, I think, superb if you can forgive the dubbing. I do wonder if that is really what Master Ip was really like, not because Donnie Yen played him badly but because his mannerisms were unusual compared to every other character in the film(s).

There are a lot of funny scenes in the movie. Considering part of the subject matter, the occupation of China by Japan, I found that to be a wonderful strength for the story. Japan was a cruel master of all occupied territories and this movie did a pretty good job of portraying that too. If anything, it was mild in that respect. They were merciless masters that starved their subjects to feed their war machine and their own people.

Although not a non-stop action movie, the story is well told, interesting and will keep your attention if you aren't an adrenalin junkie. Even more so since it is a peek into the life of the man that trained the legend Bruce Lee.

The quality is great--I believe the film becomes intentionally more monochromatic and grainy after the Japanese invasion.  Understanding that this is a movie about a grandmaster, we expect embellishment with the fight scenes (things like people defying gravity and such), but it is kept to a minimum.

3786985,3,B001SO6KNS,"I watched this with my family, who aren't actually interested in martial arts, and they thought it was great.  I also enjoyed it, as I would enjoy almost any kung fu film, but I didn't think it was great, either for its martial arts or its plot elements.

My family, especially my mother, was drawn in by the presentation of Ip's interactions with his family at the beginning of the film.  For people who don't know kung fu films and have gotten used to the western anti-heroes, seeing a hero portrayed as a gentlemanly family man is a thrilling experience.  They then found the fighting exciting.  When they found out Ip Man was a real person, they were beside themselves.

As for myself, I found this to be a very watchable but tame kung fu film.  It's too ahistorical to be considered an actual biographical portrayal of Ip Man's life, it's too PC vis-a-vis WWII to be dramatically compelling, and the fighting falls in a grey area where it has too much special effect to leave the impression of watching real fighting and not enough special effect to give the pleasure of fantasy fighting.  Although I enjoyed the beginning of the movie as did my family, I found the Japanese tournaments and their resolutions cliche and slightly boring.

The main thing this film has going for it are sympathetic characters and quite good acting for the depth of the script.  The sets, costuming, filmography, etc are also well done.  On the down side, the stench of nationalist sentiment hangs about this movie, as it does so much of the entertainment coming out of China today.

Ip Man (played by Donnie Yen), desperate for food, finds that a Japanese general will trade rice for sparring partners for his men.  But when his friends are killed in the process, it then becomes a matter of honor, not hunger, that drives him.

A secondary plot is when Ip Man fights a number of bandits trying to rob a friend's factory, and Ip Man trains the factory workers to protect themselves.

After the war, Ip Man develops a martial arts school which produces Bruce Lee, among others.

Much of the conversation seems stilted and shallow, but I suspect that was due in part to the translation (the film has subtitles in English).  I understand that there is quite of bit of artistic license used in this story.  Ip Man was a policeman himself, and he never battled a Japanese general.

3787004,4,B001SO6KNS,"Ip Man is a 'biopic' but - from the little I have read - it's probably only loosely based on its subject's actual life. Played by Donnie Yen (also seen in Seven Swords), Ip Man is a supremely talented martial artist who lives peacefully in Fo Shan, a place renowned for its martial artists. The Japanese invasion of China during WWII destroys his idyllic existence. Master Ip and everyone around him are suddenly poor and life becomes a brutal struggle for existence. In the movie, the former Fo Shan masters have to resort to going to a 'fight club' in order to earn bags of rice to stay alive. The film does a very good job of conveying the harsh existence of the time.

In the title role, Donnie Yen's serene presence works very well. I've noticed in all of his films that he has this calm but powerful vibe emanating from him. It makes him a great choice to play a martial arts master. However, he is also able to convey deep emotion just by very subtle things he does with his face or posture. For instance, when he smiles, it's so rare that it takes on major importance. When he calls the translator Li a traitor, there's a sudden hardness in his face that's just a shade different from his usual stoicism, but it's enough and it tells you everything you need to know. I found myself just watching him very closely because of this, and his performance rewarded the attention.

Admittedly, the plot of Ip Man is rather thin. There are several characters with arcs of one sort or another, but the movie ends up focused mostly on the horrors of life under the Japanese occupation as opposed to any deep insight into Master Ip or his philosophy (though there is certainly some of that to be found here). One big plus to this was that it left room for a lot of martial arts sequences to be smoothly woven into the story.

On the downside the focus on the occupation - especially through the dingy, depressing light in which these scenes are filmed - rendered Ip Man a bit cold and soulless at times. I feel like a good martial arts movie, even one dealing with dark or tragic subjects, should still reflect the spirit of the martial arts (which is not about darkness or post-modern angst). While the movie clearly wants to convey the horrors of occupation, I think it would have been a better move (and more poignant) to rely upon the actors and characters to get this across. For example, the scene where Master Ip confesses to his wife how useless he feels was extremely touching, as was the scene when Yuan opens the mysterious tin box his brother had been searching for. The desperation of the millworkers and that of the bandits who blackmail them was also compelling, but this conflict really didn't go anywhere specific.

Overall, I liked Ip Man and found it very moving, and I guess I'm picking at it because it's good enough to merit that kind of dissection. Most importantly, the martial arts sequences in Ip Man are very good. Much of the close-in fighting is especially tight and furious (and from what I understand the Wing Chun form is more about fighting at close range). Master Ip and Master Liu (another of the former Fo Shan masters) both had moves that make you want to reach for the rewind button. There was also great work from the actor who played the scruffy challenger from the north. A few less cuts would have enhanced the WOW! factor at times, and there is some unneeded use of wire fu. Not dissing wire fu in total, but the fact is that the best martial arts movies are the ones where you can best see the artists showing their skills with 'no strings attached' (that's why we watch!). So if you have good artists in the movie, it should be used sparingly. That said, Ip Man definitely delivers plenty of good martial arts, as well as a great performance from Donnie Yen and very moving story. Excellent movie!",1292976000,3,3839,4.495702005730659

On the film itself, the music score and action are amazing! Donnie Yen does a good job in bringing Ip Man to life in this movie! I will warn, however, this film isn't for little kids. This is more for the tweens to adult crowd. While there isn't much bad language in the movie, there is a lot of violence!

Ip Man begins the film as a wealthy but kind family man who teaches his kung fu form popularly known as Wing Chung. When the Japanese invade his country, he and his family are forced from their home and Ip Man is forced to work in the mines to provide for them. His rage over the injustices heaped upon him, his family and his countrymen come out when he witnesses one of his former fellow teachers executed needlessly. From there, Ip Man goes on a mission to not only fight the invading Japanese but united his countrymen against the Japanese during the early stages of World War II.

3787007,3,B001SO6KNS,"There has been quite sometime since I watched a great fight film, for my tastes the genre had ceased to be appealing. After watching Ipman, I think I will give it another lease.
 Set in 1930's China, Ipman is about the life of the Wing Chun master (Donnie Yen) who is only known to us because of his famous pupil Bruce Lee but let me tell you the teachers life was no less exciting. Ipman is a wealthy but kind and a generous man and one of the best martial art experts in his town. The invading Japanese army reduces the town to rubble and confiscates his house. He is forced to work in the mines. The commanding Japanese general is a martial art lover but also a pervert. He invites mine workers to come and fight him or his troops in return for a bag of rice. An incident happens and Ipman with great reluctance has to defend himself by fighting the general.
Ipman is a great film and along with the fights which are awesome there is a storyline. Some portions are silly in the script such as the uprising of the factory workers against the bandits but I have seen many Asian films and such story props are commonplace. I enjoyed this movie. 3 stars. 12/1/10",1292457600,2,1161,4.301369863013699

Its slow relax movie, but shifts into a Jet Li ""Unleashed"" frenzy!  Where Ip Man truly shows just how much more he is the best to those who challenge him and shows how he has the best heart to those who challenge others.

I have seen a lot of martial arts movies and none have recently impressed me so much. The martial arts look realistic with what looks like minimal wire work and the story although sometimes a little thin on the acting skills was interesting and well scripted. Donnie Yen is a great hero who will have you cheering during many of his excellently choreographed scenes. The film has a nice balance of comedy and drama and it is great to see a martial arts film in the unique setting of China during the Japanese occupation.

The martial art fights are good, but they tend to have the same moves over and over. The directing and photographing is really bad and the storyline is the same as most of the Chinese martial art movies.
The English language translation has so little emotion that it almost hurts my ears.

If you are a fan of  Jet Li's Fearless or the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon movie which has a magical beauty to it you will be very unsatisfied. I can't believe I paid for this....

The movie reminds me of the 80s where every military action movies was about the Soviet Union and USA. This time it is China vs. Japan in a extremely boring story line. The actors' play is worse that any Latin Soap opera.",1291507200,7,798,4.342281879194631

This bluray leaves alot to be desired though. The audio is suspect. I ignored the english dub (1/3) there are two ZHO DTS-HD multi-chi. (2/3) and (3/3).... What the difference is, I can't tell. But, then again I only speak english, maybe there is differences, I didn't pick up. The only thing I can say is the first ZHO option(2/3) the lips compared to dialogue is off way more than the second ZHO option.

The subtitle is worse. You are given two options. Both ENG 1/2 & 2/2 First of all 1/2 is non-existent. Nothing there.  2/2 is the only option in reality. The subtitle is suspect. Some words, I think are used wrong, please correct me if I am wrong.  But they just don't seem appropriate. In the first scene both Master Liu and Ip man say PLEASE, that is in the subtitle and the eng dubbed. So maybe I am incorrect. Secondly, when Ip Man fights Master Jin, the Subtitle says I'll PAY when he takes form. The ENG dub he says PLEASE. After ruining a vase he again says I'LL PAY. which makes more sense....
But like I said I might be mistaken, only speaking english.

Also, the video quality, is suspect. Visually the cinematragrahpy is great. But there is a couple instances of people ghosting or blurring when they move on screen.

It's really this simple:

This movie has it all; tragedy, drama, romance, humor, humility, heroism, a great story and screenplay, and some of the best martial arts choreography ever.

Unlike many Kung-Fu movie stories that are hard, if not impossible to follow; this is an easily understood, yet complex story that transposes cultures.

Donnie Yen makes delivering a beatdown look as effortless as swatting a fly. The story is beautiful and gave me a perspective I hadn't seen before into the Japanese occupation of China.

3787019,4,B001SO6KNS,"At one level, this is a fairly ordinary martial arts movie. Mangy-looking bad guys move in on a town of peace-loving martial art masters and their schools. The peace-lovingest master of all, Master Ip, whups him handily and sends him packing, after a neatly choreographed duel. (The best part, for my taste, came when his small son tricycled into the mayhem to pass the message that Mom wants the fight over before they break the rest of the furniture.)

This takes place in the 1930s, though, just before the outbreak of WWII. It's easy for Americans to forget the Sino-Japanese front of that war, which brutalized large swaths of the Chinese countryside. Master Ip's village falls, invaders commandeer his property and, like everyone else, his family falls into poverty under the invader's boot-heel. Master Ip takes the honorable route, finding what labor he can to support his family - a drop in social status that he takes with good grace, since he shares it with everyone else.

The general of the occupying forces starts a vicious series of fights, using Asian martial arts but with a gladiatorial feel to the 'entertainments'. These culminate in a faceoff between Ip and that general, with the result you'd expect - and with a disproportionate effect on the morale of the occupied Chinese.

As a plot mechanism, the lone defender of civil and family values stands as well in this movie as in scores of others before and since. This has special resonance, though, because of the historical background created by WWII, a legacy that survives even today in resentment at the atrocities committed back then. Perhaps the plot never excels (though some of the fight scenes do), but the historical setting taps into some very deep feelings.

3787025,4,B001SO6KNS,"Kung Fu movies have a spotty history at best. Some have been good. Others lousy and still others have been laughable. The past 10 years or so have seen a great maturing of the genre. The stars, directors, budgets have all risen to create a genuinely respectable category in film making. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Hero"" have not only been great Kung Fu movies, they've been great movies.

""Ip Man"" is right up there with the best. The producers were smart in using an actual historical event on which to base their film. The first act sets up the characters. You get to meet Master Ip and see how he truly embodies the philosophies of Kung Fu. He's a genuinely decent dude. In the second act the Japanese invade China and society breaks down. Two thirds of the population split the scene and the last third scrap for whatever food and jobs they can get while dodging Japanese soldiers. Master Ip Takes on slave level labor as he tries to keep the household together. The head Japanese General wants his Kung Fu soldiers to take on the locals in Kung Fu matches where a sack of rice is the prize for the winner. The third act is Ip Man finally caving into the request that he fight the Japanese General. He does and, of course, kicks his butt. They then go on to a post script on how he went on to form other Kung Fu schools and gained a couple of million desciples.

This is a good idea that works well. The sets and costuming look authentic and it is generally directed well. The sub-plots were decent enough and added depth to the proceedings, but the real joy here are the fight scenes. They are as well, if not better, choreographed and directed as any I've ever seen. The fights are spaced out nicely throughout the movie and they escalate in intensity. What is cool is the climactic fight between the two heavies isn't drawn out, Hollywood style, for too long. It's not short but long enough for the viewer to get his/her ya yas.

3787027,4,B001SO6KNS,"let's face it;  we are at an age where martial arts films are either ridiculous or banal.  HK and china are killing the genre with mediocre efforts that copy each other.  how many other Ip Man movies are now out?

Ip Man suffers from many of the same cliches as all the other recent martial arts films coming out of China.  from the Chinese nationalism (and anti-Japanese fervor) to the same wirefu moves we've seen in countless other movies.  how many times do we need to see two men dueling on a platform and one nearly falls at the edge only to somehow wirefu back to safety?  it's in here... hm, sounds a lot like Fearless with Jet Li.

of course, the Ip Man biography is... surprise, totally fabricated.  i guess that's ok because anyone who still thinks ""based on a true story"" is somehow true probably still believes in bigfoot and the tooth fairy.

having said all that, this movie is still quite good.  forget the Ip Man baggage, the political overtones, the cliche story and you get a very nice performance by Donnie Yen as the stoic and reluctant master.  that's right, Donnie Yen's acting is alone worth the watch.  his acting is both nuanced from his care of his wife and expressive when his inner fury boils over watching his friend get shot.  (and let me also add that Lam Ka-tung performed admirably as the Police chief turned traitor.  his side story added a nice dimension to an otherwise typical one.)

the martial arts choreography is restrained in the use of wirefu and yet, i wish it was even more so.  there is a gritty brutality to Ip Man when his anger and determination is fully realized.  and it was distracting to see some of the comical hanging in the air moves.  at least they didn't fight on poles for no apparent reason.

this may sound like a negative review, but only because this movie was good enough for me to care and want it to have been better. there are enough, ""wow, that was very cool!"" moments in the movie that make it a worthwhile purchase and i give it a very solid 4 stars.",1288310400,3,2021,4.425474254742547

Started from the time before World War II. Before the Japanese invasion there was Master IP. He was a well known good martial arts fighter and a good man who loved to help his people in need. Although he never had a martial arts school people knew how good he was and he was the best at it. He was modest to the core a really nice guy that cared for his family and respected his wife fully.
In china in the old times in order for a master to start a school for martial arts they had to fight the best to make their name known so students will sign up at their school.
if the masters wanted to make a name for themself they had to fight the best. And in master IPs town he was the best so they had to test him if they could really defeat his style. In order for IP not to embarrass the losers he always asked them to fight inside his home so no one can find out who won or lost or how bad the oponent can get beatten.

3787034,4,B001SO6KNS,"IP Man is a better than average action flick. In formula, it reminds me of some of the better US action films. Oddly, it is in this way that IP Man differs from some of the other Chinese martial arts films I have enjoyed: The fact that it is very American in formula. The story is simple, enjoyable and actually quite entertaining. However, I must point out that the Chinese nationalism in this movie is so over-the-top in your face, it toys with certain historical truths and is comically degrading to people of Japanese descent. I don't know, but there must be a lot of residual hatred over there OR quite simply, maybe this is the history that is taught in China! One example that at first I chuckled over, but then as I continued to ponder it, found that my laughter had turned to shock, occurs at the very end of the movie. This is not a spoiler. Just before the final credits, the subtitle states that in August of 1945, the Japanese surrended unconditionally because the Chinese had won the eight year war. No mention of the United States' involvement in the Japanese surrender at the end of WWII at all! I guess we didn't exist! And if you happen to be Japanese (I am not), the insults are constant throughout this film.

Nevertheless, IP Man is another beautiful film. The cinematography is crisp, it is colorful or drab to depict a mood, and it is constantly gorgeous. I really liked the main Character of the IP Man played by Donnie Chen. What a man of honorable character (at least as depicted in this film)! The martial arts scenes are well done, staged within a more realistic context than say: House of Flying Daggers.

3787070,5,B001SO6KNS,"Really, damn! In the realm of martial arts cinema, it really doesn't get more compelling than this movie. IP MAN, riveting and strewn with electrifying martial arts sequences, propels Donnie Yen to that summit of Asian action cinema (scooch over, Tony Jaa). IP MAN tells the semi-biographical story of the grandmaster of Wing Chun and, later in life, mentor to Bruce Lee. IP MAN presents a historical human drama, set in the backdrop of the Second Sino-Japanese War, and the story draws you in, but I think this has more to do with Donnie Yen's powerhouse performance more than anything else. I agree with those who say that this is Donnie Yen's finest work.

The harshness of the Japanese occupation will draw out hisses. It's hard not to sympathize with the populace of Foshan as lives become reduced to a state of poverty so abject that starving men volunteer to fight for the Japanese general's entertainment, all for a single sack of rice (should they win). Ip Man himself, widely regarded as the best martial artist in Foshan, finds his skills useless under Japanese rule and he struggles to support his family. Donnie Yen as Ip Man is grace under pressure, cultured and principled and self-deprecating (and, okay, maybe a bit detached). It takes a wanton act of brutality to turn him into an instrument of vengeance. And when Ip Man finally loses his cool... well, it sets the stage for a sequence of pure assownery. Donnie Yen's wing chun is dynamic and exciting, and he's so fluid in action. I have to say, at this point, that whoever came up with the wonderful score deserves a lot of credit. The score not only adds dramatic impact to the story but lends even more tension to the combat scenes. But you'll hear in the bonus features that even longtime practitioners of the wing chun discipline are raving about Donnie Yen's technique. It's surprising to learn that, before IP MAN, Donnie didn't know too much wing chun. He trained in it for the nine strenuous months leading up to the film's shooting.

Donnie Yen gets a great supporting cast: lovely Lynn Hung (in her film debut) as Ip Man's long-suffering wife (she loves her husband, can't stand it when he fights), Simon Yam as the cotton mill's distinguished owner and Ip Man's friend, and Fan Siu-Wong as Jin Shanzhao, the scruffy, over-aggressive martial artist from the north who challenges - and annihilates - the best martial arts schools in Foshan (until, in a thrilling contest, he eventually gets spanked by Ip Man). And if you don't absolutely end up loathing the sadistic Japanese colonel Sato, then actor Shibuya Tenma didn't do his job near well enough.

Ip Man early on is reluctant to take on students, and it isn't until the Japanese invasion that he starts teaching the basics of wing chun to the bullied cotton mill workers. What I appreciate is the touch of realism that went into the scene in which the bandits return to the mill and the workers initially apply what wing chun they've learned but then quickly go back to cowering when they realize that they're still not cut out for serious brawling.

My favorite moment has to be Ip Man simultaneously taking on ten Japanese fighters. But, oddly, my second favorite scene is when the fight between Ip Man and a challenger is put on pause when Ip's young son comes wheeling around in his bicycle to remind his dad that mom said not to break things in the house. This funny little moment was so unexpected, but it was a breath of fresh air, and it makes me like the movie that much more.

There is some contrived melodrama featuring two brothers we don't really care about, and there's plenty of Japanese bashing that goes on here. But, hey, it's a Chinese film, so a measure of nationalism is probably expected. I don't know how faithful this movie is to Ip Man's biography. I wouldn't be surprised if certain liberties were taken. But I look at this movie more as a martial arts fable, and whether the story strays from what really happened or not sort of gets swept under the rug when you factor in the excellent acting, the stirring martial arts, and the superior production values. Yup, I'm calling it: IP MAN is simply a great movie.

The Collector's Edition comes in 2 discs, with all bonus features available with English sub-titles. Disc 1: the film presentation; ""Making Of"" featurette (00:18:32 minutes); 3 Deleted Scenes (one of which informs us of Jin Shanzhao's final fate); the English trailer and the original theatrical trailer to IP MAN. Disc 2 contains: ""Shooting Diary"" - more behind-the-scenes footage (00:05:27), ""Behind the Sets"" of the cotton mill, the streets of Foshan, and Ip Man's residence; and nine interviews with cast & crew including Donnie Yen (00:22:07 minutes), film director Wilson Yip (00:23:10), actress Lynn Hung (00:07:48), and action director Sammo Hung who choreographed the martial arts sequences (00:08:02).",1281830400,11,4886,4.796912114014252

3787074,5,B001SO6KNS,"In ""Ip Man"", director Yip Wai Shun has constructed a 1930's biopic that combines epic martial arts footage with a moving storyline encompassing family, friendship and betrayal. A master of Wing Chun, a Chinese martial arts discipline passed down orally since the Qing dynasty, Ip Man (played by Donny Yen, who until this film had never practised Wing Chun) is a respected teacher who is seen as the ultimate sparring opponent in the Guandong town of Fo Shan. Known for it's multitude of martial arts ""schools"", Fo Shan streets are lined up with storefronts of teachers hoping to acquire potential students. Early scenes show how competitors knocked on the door of Ip Man's home to test their skills against his in an effort to supercede his legendary prowess in an attempt bring in more business. Sammo Hung, the action director for the film, interpolates the various fighting styles used against Ip Man with amazing success. When a northern fighter Jin Shanzhao (played by Fan Sui Wong) in the hope of setting up his own school in Fo Shan knocks on Ip Man's door for a fight, he spars with a variation of Shao Bei Fist, a loose, almost dance-like style. This juxtaposes awesomely with Man's Wing Chun - which is tight and disciplined, using a centerline defensive stance traditionally fought in close combat style. Ultimately, Ip Man defeats the northerner with a feather duster pulled from a vase in his ornately decorated home.

With the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, Fo Shan is turned into a ghetto. Ip Man, married with a young son, is relegated to shovelling coal amongst his former students in order to make ends meet. The Japanese General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi) in charge of the local occupying force, tasks Li Zhao (Ka Tung Lam), a former cop-turned-translator, to find willing martial-artists to face-off against an assembled troop of Japanese karate fighters in return for a bag of rice if the Chinese fighter wins their bout. After the disappearance of one of his friends after one of these matches, Ip Man steps into the ring and challenges 10 of the generals' Japanese fighters at once. The fight is stunning - and Ip Man emerges victorious. This leaves General Miura with a longing to fight the elusive and highly skilled Chinese opponent. He nudges his uninhibited and violent lieutenant to find Ip Man amongst the streets of Fo Shan in the guise that the general wants to enlist the astounding Chinese martial artist to teach the Japanese fighters the Wing Chun technique. Ip Man, having already been given this option after his victory over the 10 Japanese opponents, refuses and goes into hiding, feeling that the Japanese do not have the proper philisophical underpinning in order to absorb the teachings of his martial artistry.

Meanwhile, Ip Man's industrious friend, Zhou Qing Quan (Simon Lam), having maintained his cotton mill after the occupation, has been threatened by the northern fighter, Jin Shanzhao, who has ammassed a crew of renegades to try to extract protection money or product from business owners in Fo Shan. Man comes to Quan's aid, and trains his friend's employees to defend themselves for the next visit. When the northerners return, Quan's people are ready - and are backed by Ip Man, who uses a long pole with exceptional skill to ensure that their invaders will never return. This showdown, however, leads to the Japanese learning of Ip Man's wherabouts. With Quan being threatened if he doesn't give up the location of his friend, Ip Man comes forward, surrenduring to the Japanese.

The finale is epic - a fight between Ip Man, using Wing Chun, and General Miura, using karate. Fought upon a square stage in the town center, with an audience of Chinese held back at gunpoint by the Japanese occupying army, the anticipation pays off. The chance for Ip Man to give a glimmer of hope to his fellow countrymen has arrived, but it is also a deadly reckoning, as Miura's lieutenant expresses a threat of death to Ip Man should he defeat the general. An amazing instance of fight choreography is displayed. Hiroyuki Ikeuchi had never been trained in any martial artistry before this film, you would never know it...This, combined with Yen's utter mastery of Wing Chun lines this up as one of the most memorable fight scenes ever filmed.

Of particular note is the amazing cast and direction. Fluid camerawork, dramatic musical score and an inspired lighting perspective are evident throughout. If you are a fan of Johnny To's Election, Mission, and Triad Election you will see that a number of actors from these excellent films are featured here in Ip Man.

This film delivers on many levels:

- a biopic historical interpretation of the rise of Wing Chun, one of the world's most popular martial arts disciplines (Bruce Lee's mentor was Ip Man)
- a fantastic action film with action sequences directed by the legenday Sammo Hung
- an alternative, micro-perspective of the historical drama of the 1930's Japanese occupation of China

Ip Man not only has some of the best kung fu footage I've ever seen, as in Enter The Dragon good, but delivers a decent movie alongside the action. Yen is a fine actor as well as an insanely talented marital artist; his taciturn performance as Ip Man feels perfect in many ways, but never cheesy as so much of this genre can be.

There are also some beautiful shots by director Yip, and a few of the early scenes are played almost slapstick, which works well and gives way to straight drama as the plot moves forward. Chinese hatred towards the Japanese occupiers is still palpable, and there is a touch of propaganda feel here. But all in all, the amazing action combines with a surprisingly gentle touch throughout, along with a fine score (if derivative...count the Bond and other cues) and excellent cinematography, to create a real martial arts classic.",1280620800,,869,4.636363636363637

IP Man was the teacher of Bruce Lee and this is about his life when he was younger. There are definately excellent Martial Arts moments but there is also a story of the occupation of Japan and how the events of IP Man's life effected his family as well.

3787085,5,B001SO6KNS,"In the tradition of Jet Li's ""Fearless"" and ""Fist of Legend"", comes the fourth collaboration between the Wilson Yip-Donnie Yen tag team who also brought us the phenomenal ""Shah Po Lang"" in 2005. ""IP MAN"" is based on the life of the man responsible for making the Chinese kung fu style of ""Wing Chun"" (invented by a woman), which is up to this day, is among China's most revered style. Yes, Ip Man is also the man who has a huge number of talented disciples--most notably, the late great Bruce Lee.

In the 1930's, the Chinese province of Fo Shan is a thriving place of martial arts schools, with various sects of different styles. Fo Shan is said to be the place where the famous Wong Fei Hung learned his art and therefore this place has a reputation. Ip Man (Donnie Yen) is a very accomplished martial artist but he keeps to himself, maintains a low profile and quietly spars with friends at home. But after an acknowledged victory over a fighter from the Northern quarter, Master Jin (Fan Siu Wong), Ip Man becomes an instant hero in Fo Shan.

Time passes and in the late 1930's, following the Japanese invasion, Ip Man's property was confiscated by the Japanese army and his family is forced to live an abject existence. One day, general Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), a fanatical practitioner in Karate, witnesses the skills of this Wing Chun master. The general becomes obsessed with Ip man, and demands that the Chinese style of Wing Chun be taught to the Japanese army. But Ip man refuses and instead challenges Miura to a duel. Ip Man has to uphold the benevolence of his art and protect Chinese dignity. The battle for national pride is about to begin....

The one thing I know for sure is that Ip Man is indeed Bruce Lee's first teacher in Hong Kong for many years, and that Ip man was indeed asked to teach the Japanese; the rest of the significant historical details in this biopic is a little questionable. Yip and screenwriter Edmond Wong does get some details right, but please keep in mind that this is an action film first and foremost--it is hardly a historical drama. The action direction by Hong Kong legend Sammo Hung is indeed amazing, and it is the film's main draw. The story has the usual elements of honor, family, loyalty and pride and offers very little that is fresh--but this doesn't mean that it made the film any less exciting.

There is very minor characterization involved. The film has three acts, and the first has Ip Man's status in the Fo Shan province. He is a business man and he doesn't teach his art, there are hints that he used to compete, but he decided to keep a low profile because of his wife, Cheng (played by Lynn Hung). His relationship with his wife and son is somewhat estranged at times because of his love for sparring--she throws a tantrum whenever he fights; Ip Man is a humble man, and shows his wife the respect due her. The second act portrays the effect of the Japanese invasion on the people of China, and on the life of Master Ip and his family--which leads to the film's min encounters. While Donnie Yen may indeed lack the necessary acting ability to portray him dramatically--he sure has the presence of a highly trained martial artist. Director Yip did the right thing in focusing more on fights than dramatic impact. There are also some touches of social commentary seeing as how some Chinese prey on their countrymen and they only look out for themselves.

As I've said, Sammo Hung's action choreography is indeed phenomenal and it sure helps when you have a cast of real-life martial arts practitioners and action-honed actors such as Yen, Louis Fan and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, who holds a Kuro Obi in Judo in real life. Sammo Hung maintains a nice balance between finesse, realism and downright brutality--the fights are very intense and very focused. It is a mix of the usual wire-fu and occasional acrobatics. Highlights include, Ip Man taking on 10 Japanese fighters in one time, the fight between Fan Siu Wong and Yen is quick but exciting, complemented with some subtle doses of humorous cracks. The fights are exquisitely shot, with multiple camera angles in a perspective view to close ups, so you can see all the hard-hitting action. There are also times when an opponent is thrown in the camera's view and I thought this added a lot of style and intense attitude. Wilson Yip and company knows how to shoot fight sequences and their skill proves the film's showstopper.

The action encounters are nicely placed and Wilson Yip needs to be credited for maintaining an excellent pace with its balance between action and drama. While this film is historically inaccurate, for the most part, it does succeed as an action film--a very well done at that. The film does ultimately fail as a character-driven, true-to-life biopic. Donnie Yen's ""Ip Man"" is more about his capabilities as a fighter than who he really was as a man, which is no doubt due to fact that it wanted to maintain a China-friendly film. The film's structure more of a popcorn action film than an emotional biopic of a man who made his mark in using his fists to unite the Chinese people. It plays too fast and free to fully realize the film's potential as a ""based on true events"" type of deal.

Despite some flaws in the script, and the filmmakers relying too much on the audiences' good beliefs rather than developing Ip Man as a man than as a caricature of a folk hero; (no doubt an attempt to match Wong Fei Hung in ""Once upon a Time in China"" and Huo Yuan Jia in ""Fearless"") to portray him as an inspirational role model/saint. ""IP MAN"" is a truly exciting film which is just full of action and the energy it exudes is just so much fun to watch. I am rather very interested in seeing as to what Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen would bring ""IP MAN 2"", which would hopefully show more of his experiences in Hong Kong (which may include his time with Bruce Lee). Of course, by that time, I've read that Wong Kar-Wai's version of ""IP MAN"" will be released and will hopefully have more historical significance as well as action thrills.

Still, this film comes with a ""Highly Recommended"" rating from me, it does rule as martial arts action film. [4  Stars]

Wing Chun is an art that is unique as it descends from a Shaolin nun (Ng Mui) as oppose to a monk. It was passed on to Wing Chun.

However, whilst there have been dozens of memorable ones, few stand out as masterpieces in the Wuxia genre - 'Ip Man' is one such film, an instant classic that sets a new benchmark for action cinema. Wilson Yip, Sammo Hung and Donnie Yen have totally hit the mark in this outstanding motion picture, crafting a story that, although not sticking entirely to the facts (well, after all, it IS about entertainment!), works perfectly to tell the story of a real life Chinese hero, the late Grandmaster of Wing Chun Gung-fu, Ip Man. The camera work, direction and the performances of the entire crew make this a film that grabs the audience and holds them in its clutches from start to final gut-wrenching finish (all very good reasons why this film won the 'Best Picture' and ""Best Action Choreography' awards in the 2009 Hong Kong Film Awards). Donnie Yen gives what I feel is his finest performance ever, whilst Sammo Hung's action choreography is briliant, showcasing the art of Wing Chun in a manner never before done so well.

I was fortunate enough to first see it as part a special movie-marathon in a local theater.  Ip Man was one of the most talked-about films of the night (and there were some amazing films that night).  I strongly encourage anyone who loves martial arts to watch this.

Based on a true story, there is a very human element and depth of character that is often lacking in action-packed movies.  Donnie Yen's portrayal of the famous Ip Man is flawless.  But do not fear, there are plenty of fight sequences that are thoroughly entertaining for those that just want to see people kick some butt.

But that's not what I'm excited about for this movie and I won't pretend either. It's the fights, the choreography and level was amazing. And in the past years where most kung fu movies have your fighters defying gravity and physics, Ip Man does the opposite. Up to a point where the Master unleashes his skills with such ferocity does not make me cheer but stand there in awe at the raw power. Donnie Yen has outdone himself here. One nitpick is the climatic fight of the film...could have easily been the first fight of the film because it really didn't add anything other than how strong Master Ip really was.

All in all, I enjoyed the film for what it brought and I loved it. Though on the dvd product, the case is pretty flimsy and that should be worked on especially in closing the case with the assurance it's not about to pop open.",1260921600,,1099,4.382352941176471

Let's get another thing out of the way:

Loves: Great fights WITHOUT wires (i.e. Hate Wire-Fu)
Likes: Donnie Yen, Sammo Hung, Martial Arts

Ip Man is a semi-biopic of the Wing Chun style Grand Master of the same name. The plot, well, as with many Kung Fu movies, is all about Kung Fu schools, political intrigue and... well... that's basically it! For being a biopic they don't really delve too much in Ip Man's life but more on the setting... which takes place during the Japanese Invasion (1930-ish). So, ho-hum plot, check. But we don't watch these types of movies for the plot, we watch them for the action and this one delivers! I believe this movie tested Donnie Yen's mastery of martial arts more than any other movie before this one because I'm sure he had to get the Wing Chun fights done right and on most of them he did! Now, if you are thinking: ""why did this guy only gave the movie 3 stars?"" If you are going to buy this DVD, DON'T DO IT!!! First look at the Product Detail section of the page and notice the following:

Studio: Bonzai

NEVER BUY A BONZAI MEDIA MOVIE!!
These guys are just bootleggers (they are part of Red SUN DVDs if I'm not mistaken!) So basically the DVD quality is a joke! You are better of buying the original Region 2 discs!

3787115,5,B001SO6KNS,"It seems the director Yip Wai Shun is almost single-handedly resurrecting Chinese martial arts cinema and key to his success is his use of actual martial artists for whom he seems to have a healthy measure of respect.  Three such artists are Jacky Wu, Sammo Hung and Donnie Yen.  Sammo here does the action direction/ choreography and he knows what he's doing just as he knows his Wing Chun.  Yip Wai Shun knows how to tell a story and keeps the cinematography crisp and clear without making of it the trickster that's suppose to wow fans but only illustrates how ridiculous martial arts movies can get.  Shun also relies on the tireless natural acting talent of Simon Yam.  But the great success here, in my view, is in the seemingly ageless Donnie Yen.  Every long time Hong Kong action fan knows Donnie Yen unfairly overflows with natural talent and a work ethic few are inclined to emulate.  But for some reason, movie makers seem not to have known or cared and unlike Jackie Chan and Jet Li who still managed to get it right now and then, Donnie's movies just weren't cutting it.  Maybe the experience was good for him though because of late Yen's movies have been excellent and, given the sad shape of Hong Kong action flicks for too long now, transcendent.  Ip Man is a great movie and if you're a Donnie Yen admirer, it's greater still.  His acting is subtle, flawlessly dignified and (as action movies should be) inspiring.  This movie will probably always be listed among the top ten martial arts flicks of all time for more reasons than one needs to list but for no reason more critical than Donnie Yen's performance.

3787120,5,B001SO6KNS,"In the tradition of Jet Li's ""Fearless"" and ""Fist of Legend"", comes the fourth collaboration between the Wilson Yip-Donnie Yen tag team who also brought us the phenomenal ""Shah Po Lang"" in 2005. ""IP MAN"" is based on the life of the man responsible for making the Chinese kung fu style of ""Wing Chun"" (invented by a woman), which is up to this day, is among China's most revered style. Yes, Ip Man is also the man who has a huge number of talented disciples--most notably, the late great Bruce Lee.

In the 1930's, the Chinese province of Fo Shan is a thriving place of martial arts schools, with various sects of different styles. Fo Shan is said to be the place where the famous Wong Fei Hung learned his art and therefore this place has a reputation. Ip Man (Donnie Yen) is a very accomplished martial artist but he keeps to himself, maintains a low profile and quietly spars with friends at home. But after an acknowledged victory over a fighter from the Northern quarter, Master Jin (Fan Siu Wong), Ip Man becomes an instant hero in Fo Shan.

Time passes and in the late 1930's, following the Japanese invasion, Ip Man's property was confiscated by the Japanese army and his family is forced to live an abject existence. One day, general Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), a fanatical practitioner in Karate, witnesses the skills of this Wing Chun master. The general becomes obsessed with Ip man, and demands that the Chinese style of Wing Chun be taught to the Japanese army. But Ip man refuses and instead challenges Miura to a duel. Ip Man has to uphold the benevolence of his art and protect Chinese dignity. The battle for national pride is about to begin....

The one thing I know for sure is that Ip Man is indeed Bruce Lee's first teacher in Hong Kong for many years, and that Ip man was indeed asked to teach the Japanese; the rest of the significant historical details in this biopic is a little questionable. Yip and screenwriter Edmond Wong does get some details right, but please keep in mind that this is an action film first and foremost--it is hardly a historical drama. The action direction by Hong Kong legend Sammo Hung is indeed amazing, and it is the film's main draw. The story has the usual elements of honor, family, loyalty and pride and offers very little that is fresh--but this doesn't mean that it made the film any less exciting.

There is very minor characterization involved. The film has three acts, and the first has Ip Man's status in the Fo Shan province. He is a business man and he doesn't teach his art, there are hints that he used to compete, but he decided to keep a low profile because of his wife, Cheng (played by Lynn Hung). His relationship with his wife and son is somewhat estranged at times because of his love for sparring--she throws a tantrum whenever he fights; Ip Man is a humble man, and shows his wife the respect due her. The second act portrays the effect of the Japanese invasion on the people of China, and on the life of Master Ip and his family--which leads to the film's min encounters. While Donnie Yen may indeed lack the necessary acting ability to portray him dramatically--he sure has the presence of a highly trained martial artist. Director Yip did the right thing in focusing more on fights than dramatic impact. There are also some touches of social commentary seeing as how some Chinese prey on their countrymen and they only look out for themselves.

As I've said, Sammo Hung's action choreography is indeed phenomenal and it sure helps when you have a cast of real-life martial arts practitioners and action-honed actors such as Yen, Louis Fan and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, who holds a Kuro Obi in Judo in real life. Sammo Hung maintains a nice balance between finesse, realism and downright brutality--the fights are very intense and very focused. It is a mix of the usual wire-fu and occasional acrobatics. Highlights include, Ip Man taking on 10 Japanese fighters in one time, the fight between Fan Siu Wong and Yen is quick but exciting, complemented with some subtle doses of humorous cracks. The fights are exquisitely shot, with multiple camera angles in a perspective view to close ups, so you can see all the hard-hitting action. There are also times when an opponent is thrown in the camera's view and I thought this added a lot of style and intense attitude. Wilson Yip and company knows how to shoot fight sequences and their skill proves the film's showstopper.

The action encounters are nicely placed and Wilson Yip needs to be credited for maintaining an excellent pace with its balance between action and drama. While this film is historically inaccurate, for the most part, it does succeed as an action film--a very well done at that. The film does ultimately fail as a character-driven, true-to-life biopic. Donnie Yen's ""Ip Man"" is more about his capabilities as a fighter than who he really was as a man, which is no doubt due to fact that it wanted to maintain a China-friendly film. The film's structure more of a popcorn action film than an emotional biopic of a man who made his mark in using his fists to unite the Chinese people. It plays too fast and free to fully realize the film's potential as a ""based on true events"" type of deal.

Despite some flaws in the script, and the filmmakers relying too much on the audiences' good beliefs rather than developing Ip Man as a man than as a caricature of a folk hero; (no doubt an attempt to match Wong Fei Hung in ""Once upon a Time in China"" and Huo Yuan Jia in ""Fearless"") to portray him as an inspirational role model/saint. ""IP MAN"" is a truly exciting film which is just full of action and the energy it exudes is just so much fun to watch. I am rather very interested in seeing as to what Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen would bring ""IP MAN 2"", which would hopefully show more of his experiences in Hong Kong (which may include his time with Bruce Lee). Of course, by that time, I've read that Wong Kar-Wai's version of ""IP MAN"" will be released and will hopefully have more historical significance as well as action thrills.

Still, this film comes with a ""Highly Recommended"" rating from me, it does rule as martial arts action film. [4  Stars]

The acting is totally believable. The plot, based on a true story, conforms in many ways to the ""hero"" archetype discussed in Joseph Campbell's work. The direction and technical aspects are all ""A"" movie quality, and, IMHO, academy award material. The martial arts sequences are dramatically filmed, but not overdone, and Yen's ability to transmit the look of Wing Chun Gung Fu, a style which he studied just for the film, is impressive.

3787124,2,B001SO6KNS,"Blu-ray Video - Average (up-converting a DVD is almost the same to me)

Blu-ray Sound - Poor - The sound was loud when ths DVD loaded (level 16 on TV), then the titles and soundtrack of the movie were very low (level 30 on TV).  I prefer movies that I do not have to turn up and down while watching.

The movie was ok to watch 1 time.  The movie began strong with a wing chun sparring match that was
really good.  The fights started to become less and less realistic after.  The story of Ip Man, became
less and less like a biography, and more about 'The Legend of Ip Man' as the film continued.

I think my fundamental issue with the movie is that Ip Man was a real person, and the fights in this
movie started to violate physics.  I can accept this in fantasy movies, but not in supposed biographies.

'Dragon : A Bruce Lee story' was more realistic to me than this movie.  And if you have seen that one,
you will understand my frustration with Ip Man.

Read a book about Ip Man if you want to know the real person.  If you want to watch an action star
do some Wing Chun, pretend he is not Ip Man and watch this movie 1 time.

Donnie Yen really proves that he can act quite well for a Hong Kong action hero.  The family scenes were endearing and later quite heart wrenching depictions of the plight of the Chinese during their occupation.  He also does a great job of expressing the physical ideas of Wing Chun within the framework of this movie.  The ensemble cast especially the character actors and Northern Shaolin master make great use of their screen time.

3787132,5,B001SO6KNS,"This is probably the first ""martial arts"" film which does not rely on its martial arts to carry it.  Possibly this is due to the film being based on the real-life events of its progatonist, and the wonderfully-paced screenplay.  It's rare for an action film to develop its major characters so carefully, and lovingly, so by the middle of the film the audience actually feels the anguish of Ip Man and his family.

Don't get me wrong though, for those action kung-fu fans, there is much to rave about in this film as well.  Each action sequence is amazingly choreographed (by Sammo Hung of ""Martial Law"" TV fame), and masterfully enacted by Donnie Yen and the rest of the ensemble cast.

I must also mention the stunning quality of this Hong Kong edition of this film.  The visuals are crystal-clear, as is the audio (in DTS-HD).  I played this on a Hi-Def 50 inch plasma screen and I would swear this is in HD, even though I played it on my standard DVD player.

This movie blew me away- I expected a good ""martial arts"" movie, but was really surprised to find a rousing, heartfelt story about China during the Japanese occupation. The film effectively shows how martial arts is about so much more than just punching and kicking: in the film, and in the life of Ip Man, it becomes an embodiment of the Chinese national character, the expression of the dignity and spirit of the Chinese people, and a conduit for resistance to oppression.

Donnie Yen does an excellent job of conveying the humility and dignity of the character. I found myself really getting caught up in his struggle to maintain his honor in the face of the wearying oppression of the Japanese.

Of course, the fight scenes were terrific. The sets period costumes were also very well done and evocative, as was the music.

3787158,4,B001SO6KNS,"A stately big budget period biopic, loaded with well choreographed, shot and edited fight scenes, of the martial artist widely credited for bringing Wing Chun kung fu from southern China to Hong Kong in the early twentieth century, and whose concepts and training ideas were adapted by his most famous student, Bruce Lee, who promoted those ideas as, ""the way of the intercepting fist,"" in his book, ""The Tao of Jeet Kun Do."" The film clearly emulates the scope of the Jet Li film, ""Fearless"" - which was about the redemption of the martial arts fighter, Hua Yuan Jia, who (at least in the heavily fictionalized ""Fearless"") overcame a egotistical brutality to leave behind a similarly impressive legacy in the worldwide spread of the JingWu school of martial arts and general physical education (a kind of YMCA offering kung fu training as well as other forms of physical education in several countries).  The film is also noteworthy for Donnie Yen's atypically restrained performance as Ip Man, a wealthy martial artist, who lived in a town filled with good teachers, and resisted the Japanese colonial government in southern China, when they pressured him to teach japanese soldiers, resulting, ultimately in the historical Ip Man having to flee occupied China, and emigrate to Hong Kong, where he eventually began teaching to make a living (something most martial arts film fans might know going into the film).

However lacking the character arc Ronny Yu and the makers of ""Fearless"" imposed on the life story of Hua Yuan Jia (critics rightly point out Donnie Yen's Ip Man is nothing less than a living saint, and doesn't evolve at all as a character throughout the film) the filmmakers wisely make up for it by developing secondary characters drawn from the community Ip Man lives in before the Japanese invasion.  Some are forced to become collaborators with the occupation government, others are forced into matches with Japanese martial artists, others join tongs like the Axe Gang, which preyed on chinese civilians during the long period of the occupation and the chinese civil war.  All of these lives intersect with the newly dispossessed and impoverished Ip Man as he tries to survive, feed and defend his young wife and child, against the depredations forced on the southern chinese by the Japanese occupation, and eventually finds himself taking on challenge matches against japanese fighters, at first, to get food for his family, and then later, as a matter of principle.

That aside, the film is chock full of good-to-great martial arts fight scenes, including friendly (and some not so friendly) matches between members of the Fo Shan Mountain's large community of martial artists before the Japanese invasion, and increasingly desperate battles afterwards, between struggling workers and gangsters, starving martial artists and japanese soldiers, and publicized challenge matches against Japanese martial artists set up to further humiliate the oppressed population.  Though I do think fight choreographer Sammo Hung, and Yen didn't quite manage to get across the efficiency and sheer finesse exhibited by real masters of the style (possibly better seen in two earlier wing chun-based films he directed, ""Warriors Two] and ""Prodigal Son""), Hung deserves a lot of credit for choreographing the increasingly brutal fight scenes in a way that shows how Wing Chun differs from other styles of chinese and japanese martial arts.  (A much more detailed discussion of the major fight scenes is up at kungfucinema.com [...] for those with a strong interest in the technical side of these things.)  I particularly liked the performances of Yen (again, far more disciplined and restrained than usual), Louis Fan as a northern stylist, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as a Japanese General, Xing Yu and Chen Zhihui, as Fo Shan Mountain martial artists.

""Ip Man,"" is definitely worth seeing, and while it it doesn't quite match the dramatic strength of ""Fearless,"" the writers and filmmakers have crafted an interesting enough, well produced narrative to actually sit through the segments between the fight scenes, which is saying a lot these days. ""Ip Man, Part I"" has made pretty serious money (a sequel covering Ip Man's years in Hong Kong has been greenlit - I'm already looking forward to seeing who wins the big fight over who gets to play the young Bruce Lee) and I hope, along with ""Fearless"" it leads to more big budget period kung fu films with (hopefully) better and more interesting narratives than the usual ""theatre of revenge"" fare.  Judging from all the big budget period war movies (like ""Red Cliff I and II,"" ""Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon,"" ""The Warlords,"" ""Seven Swords,"" ""An Empress and The Warriors,"" ""A Battle of Wits"" coming out of China these days, it's clear the Chinese are willing to spend the money ... there's a good chance we'll also get more films like ""Fearless"" and ""Ip Man.""  Certainly there are no lack of candidates, (Wong Fei Hung, Yang Luchun, the Chen Family, Dong Haichuan, Yueh Fei, .. the list goes on) for cinematic canonization in the long, long history of Chinese martial arts.",1239494400,2,5130,5.080760095011876
3787159,4,B001SO6KNS,"A stately big budget period biopic, loaded with well choreographed, shot and edited fight scenes, of the martial artist widely credited for bringing Wing Chun kung fu from southern China to Hong Kong in the early twentieth century, and whose concepts and training ideas were adapted by his most famous student, Bruce Lee, who promoted those ideas as, ""the way of the intercepting fist,"" in his book, ""The Tao of Jeet Kun Do."" The film clearly emulates the scope of the Jet Li film, ""Fearless"" - which was about the redemption of the martial arts fighter, Hua Yuan Jia, who (at least in the heavily fictionalized ""Fearless"") overcame a egotistical brutality to leave behind a similarly impressive legacy in the worldwide spread of the JingWu school of martial arts and general physical education (a kind of YMCA offering kung fu training as well as other forms of physical education in several countries).  The film is also noteworthy for Donnie Yen's atypically restrained performance as Ip Man, a wealthy martial artist, who lived in a town filled with good teachers, and resisted the Japanese colonial government in southern China, when they pressured him to teach japanese soldiers, resulting, ultimately in the historical Ip Man having to flee occupied China, and emigrate to Hong Kong, where he eventually began teaching to make a living (something most martial arts film fans might know going into the film).

However lacking the character arc Ronny Yu and the makers of ""Fearless"" imposed on the life story of Hua Yuan Jia (critics rightly point out Donnie Yen's Ip Man is nothing less than a living saint, and doesn't evolve at all as a character throughout the film) the filmmakers wisely make up for it by developing secondary characters drawn from the community Ip Man lives in before the Japanese invasion.  Some are forced to become collaborators with the occupation government, others are forced into matches with Japanese martial artists, others join tongs like the Axe Gang, which preyed on chinese civilians during the long period of the occupation and the chinese civil war.  All of these lives intersect with the newly dispossessed and impoverished Ip Man as he tries to survive, feed and defend his young wife and child, against the depredations forced on the southern chinese by the Japanese occupation, and eventually finds himself taking on challenge matches against japanese fighters, at first, to get food for his family, and then later, as a matter of principle.

When the blu ray price come down a little bit. I will get a real blu ray dvd for my collection!!!!,1239321600,4,258,3.7962962962962963
3787162,5,B001SO6KNS,"Donnie Yen's crowning achievement?  Very possibly.  I've always thought Donnie was the paragon of martial artistry on film... I've also admired how he remains relatively true to the style of the hero in question, if that is relevant (See Iron Monkey, for example.).  The story of Ip Man is similar to that of Jet Li's ""Fearless"", but to be honest, Ip Man the movie is better.

The action scenes are works of art.  Donnie portrays Wing Chun with a good degree of authenticity to the style (considering, of course, the unavoidable dramatic, cinematic flair).  Donnie's technique is crisp, rapid, accurate, potent.  The choreography is splendid.  There is no significant wire work here, just economical, brutally efficient combat-- which is what Wing Chun is about.  Truly homage to the spirit of Wing Chun.  As a practitioner of Wing Chun, I can truly point to this movie, show it to my friends who don't know, and say: ""That's Wing Chun, that's what it's about.""

The story of Ip Man works well with Donnie's acting style.  Ip Man is a martial artist conflicted in his priorities-- reluctant to teach, fascinated with the art, struggling to balance family responsibilities with that of friends and comrades who get in trouble.  Forced by the Japanese occupation, near destitute, to feed his family and defend the honor of his friends, he finally fights and teaches to defend the honor of China, as well as uphold the spirit of kung fu.

I was a little nervous watching this film-- someone has posted virtually all the fight scenes on YouTube.  I was afraid that after seeing them, that this film would be a disappointment.  I had already seen the fight scenes... and kung fu flicks aren't exactly award-winning drama.  But Ip Man didn't disappoint.  The story was still compelling, interesting.  The fight scenes in context were more delicious than on YouTube (and the large widescreen, framerate and resolution upgrades didn't hurt!)  Donnie shows appropriate remorse, conflict, passion, and resolve.  It is understated-- like Donnie really tried to be true to the historical Ip Man.  It works well, and shows me that Donnie has really matured as an actor.  Hey, I know Donnie is never going to win an Oscar for his acting.. but you know what?  He really shows some maturity as a professional here.

This double disc edition is nice.  Lots of special features-- deleted scenes, interviews, production trailers, photo galleries.  I got it based on other reviews that the single disc version had dubbing issues.  I watched the Cantonese version (options for Mandarin also on this disc) with English subtitles... and if it was dubbed, I couldn't tell.  I don't speak Chinese, so can't tell you how accurate it was, but it sounded fairly authentic, and I hear enough Chinese to be able to say that much, at least.  The subtitles had one or two spelling errors, but minimal grammatical problems.  It seemed fairly true to the story's intent, was easy to follow, and kept me interested.

I'm biased.  I'm a Wing Chun practitioner and a Donnie Yen fan-- but I must say this has superseded ""Hero"" as my favorite kung fu flick.  It's at least in the same class as Jackie Chan's ""Drunken Master"" for unique, superlative martial arts.  The story and acting are good-- and while the storyline is a variation on a cliched theme for kung fu flicks, this one is well done.  If you enjoyed ""Fearless"" (I would rate it three stars)-- you'll like Ip Man so much better, I think.  If you practice Wing Chun (2 million worldwide!)-- you have to own this movie.  If you like Donnie Yen-- this might be his masterpiece.

Addendum: In deference to W. Kim's excellent review above, I took the liberty of renting and watching both movies ""Warriors Two"" and ""Prodigal Son"" as other movies that accurately depict Wing Chun as a martial art.  Both movies are your stereotypical Hong King B-movie ""Wuxi"" style soap opera kung fu flick.  Warriors Two is better storywise-- Prodigal Son, at least via the subtitles, didn't make sense much of the time.  Ah, but the reason why we watch such movies: ""Prodigal Son"" was the more accurate Wing Chun movie.  It depicts Wing Chun through the ""Wuxi"" B-movie filter, but has a lot of fairly sound representation given this understanding.  Prodigal Son was Wing Chun with lots of non-Wing Chun thrown in, or Wing Chun in a deep cat stance, or with some Longfist twist and things like that.  Just flashy show.  All in all, neither depicts Wing Chun as ""Ip Man"" does-- Ip Man is not stylized, although it, of course, depicts Wing Chun in an idealized way-- that is, the ultimate master of Wing Chun does every technique perfect and has every technique work perfectly.  But ""Ip Man"" is the only movie I have (still) seen that I can point to as ""authentic"" Wing Chun.",1239148800,52,4773,4.785801713586292

3787164,5,B001SO6KNS,"To be honest, I thought this movie was going to be another one of those Chinese films where the fighters fly all over the place. I stand corrected. Ip Man, which I believe should be spelled as ""Yip Man"", was an amazing story of one man's ability to beat the odds with courage and strength.

The movie focuses on Bruce Lee's Wing Chun master Yip Man who descends from a great martial arts lineage that can be traced back to Ng Mui, the shaolin nun who founded Wing Chun.

Now, I want someone to explain to me how Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon received so many awards? Clearly, this is a movie that can easily take Best Foreign Language Film without breaking a sweat. I can't recall seeing such a well balanced kung fu drama.

Do yourselves a favor and add this one to your collection. I'm going to hold out for the Blu-ray edition that's coming soon.",1237852800,,849,4.3949044585987265

3787171,4,B001SO6KNS,"The recent film ""Fearless"" (2006) starring Jet Li paved the way for this superior biopic about (Y)Ip Man, master of Wing Chun, who was the first to openly teach the art to the public.  He is also known to modern kung fu fans as the teacher of the one and only Bruce Lee.  The movie concentrates on the early adult life of Master Ip, when he lives in relative peace with his wife and young son in the city of Foshan.  This film has the benefits of an outstanding performance by Donnie Yen, the period detail and storytelling ability of director Wilson Yip, and the fantastic action choreography of Sammo Hung.  Hung here is exploring some old territory, as he previously directed, choreographed, and co-starred in two Wing Chun movies which documented the lineage that led to Yip Man:  ""Warriors Two"" (1978) and ""The Prodigal Son"" (1982).  Both have accurate and exciting depictions of the close-quarters fighting style, but ""Ip Man"" blazes new trails.

Ip Man is a nice, respectful fellow, who occasionally spars in friendly, closed-door matches with the local masters (of which there are many) in Foshan.  Though often asked to take students, Master Ip politely declines.  The happy and content life in Foshan ends with World War II when the Japanese take over the town.  With all prosperity gone, Master Ip is forced to take a job (I feel your pain, bro.) digging coal.  Soon the Japanese come by looking for fighters to spar with their soldiers.  When a friend goes to fight and never comes back, Ip decides to find out what happened.  His superior fighting abilities are witnessed by a Japanese General (Shibuya Tenma) who wants Master Ip to train his troops.

Donnie Yen is as quick and graceful as ever.  He and a few of his cohorts seem to be the only ones in Hong Kong interested in actually improving fight choreography in film.  ""SPL"" and ""Flashpoint"" (both directed by Yip) each broke new ground in screen fighting techniques.  Hell, I'll even admit that ""Dragon Tiger Gate"" (again, directed by Yip) is one of the better wire-fu flicks that I've ever sat through.  What puts this on the same level with those is that Wing Chun is not really the kind of martial art that looks good on film.  Not only do Yen and Sammo Hung pull it off, they also do so without sacrificing the integrity of the art.  It's not entirely flawless, with some wire use, bad slo-mo, and a little bit of goofy editing, but it's still fantastic.  Also worth mentioning is the performance of Fan Siu Wong (""Story of Ricky"") as a Northern master who defeats all the major players in Foshan.  We need to see more of him too!

Now on to the DVD:  Distributed by Sun Jian Media, it has no chapter selection (though there are chapters you can dig through sequentially), no special features, and no subtitles when paragraph after paragraph of Chinese newsprint tries to tell us what's going on.  If you know anything about history, it's not too hard to figure out, but how flippin' difficult is it to translate that stuff when you're already covering the dialogue?  And a biopic needs special features!  I can't stress that enough.  Also, the subtitles that are there disappear too quickly.  Subtitles are never a deterrent for me, but I'm not a speed-reader.  Minor complaint, I suppose.  When a better DVD comes along, I'll gladly buy it again, as this is a bona fide classic.  In widescreen with beautiful picture quality.  Mandarin  language with English subtitles.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  4.5 of 5

3787173,5,B001SO6KNS,"When IP Man first came to dvd I got the first print edition and have watched this fascinating movie now 6 times and it is still worth a repeat watch!  I now have the HK 2-disc special edition and this is the one to get with the special features!  This movie is about the life and times of IP Man, famous for his style of Chinese martial art - Wing Chun, which specializes in close quarter combat, concentrating on centerline attack and defense; Donnie Yen is an excellent martial artist and it shows in this film!  I won't give away the movie, just go and buy this fantastic movie, it has been compared to Fearless, which I have seen, and it is a great movie also, but this one, IP Man is my favorite of all my martial arts movies!",1235692800,2,731,4.207142857142857
3787174,5,B001SO6KNS,"Modern martial arts films fall into two categories: the fantastical wuxia variety, with its flying swordsmen fighting off whole battalions while emitting chi blasts with their palms, and the more realistic variant that seeks to depict an actual human fighting at the peak of human potential. Ip Man is the latter, and quite probably the finest example of this type of kung fu movie.

Though Ip Man's life story is altered for dramatic effect and the fight scenes are cinematized, it is about as fine an example of wing chun applied to real life as has been seen on screen. Action choreographer Sammo Hung, who directed the previous three best screen renditions of wing chun (Prodigal Son, Warriors Two, and the Wing Chun TV/telenovella series repackaged as a feature length film Twin Dragons) shows that he has continued to deepen his understanding of wing chun as a real fighting art and how to combine it with the requirements of an exciting movie fight. The telenovella provides more of an explanation of wing chun strategy and mindset, but Ip Man undoubtedly flourishes due to the excellent (and superior) physical skills of its star.

With Donnie Yen in the title role, we see the portrait of perhaps the greatest wing chun practioner of the past 100 years, in his prime. We see wing chun as an art that stresses timing, efficiency, directness and the instantaneous exploitation of offensive opportunities as soon as they arise. Mentally, we see wing chun as an art that advocates a highly aggressive response in combat. Yen does a superb job as both actor and martial artist.

Certain events in the film purportedly have a basis in reality: Ip's challenge fight with a Northern stylist, a confrontation with a gun-welding police officer, and a request by the Japanese military to instruct Japanese troops. However, the end, which sees Ip escaping to Hong Kong, implies that Ip was fleeing the Japanese. In fact, Ip fled to Hong Kong to avoid the wrath of the victorious Communists: as a former member of the privileged class who had demonstrated some Nationalist sympathies, he rightly realized that he would have been an obvious target for ""re-education"" and imprisonment. It is obvious that this fact was downplayed to make the movie more palatable for the mainland Chinese market.

One amusing scene in the movie features Ip, the great master, nevertheless helpless before the wrath of his wife, who vents her frustration at his devotion to training and sparring. Thousands, if not millions, of male wing chun students have found themselves in the same situation with their wives and girlfriends, so it is comforting to see that even Ip Man could not find a way out of this quandary.",1235347200,,2692,4.90989010989011
3787175,3,B001SO6KNS,"OK, I was originally going to give this a much lower star rating, but didn't want people to mistaken it as a negative review of the film itself, because it isn't, the film is a GREAT martial arts film. My low rating is the DVD itself. First thing I noticed is that the subtitles neglected to subtitle the words in the beginning credits. Now I'm not talking about the names, I'm talking about the first paragraph after the names right after you see him practicing Wing Chun, which tells the audience about the city and how it's known for being the origin of China's Nan Tian style of martial arts. And for that reason, it attracts martial artists from all over China to establish dojos and to exchange martial arts culture. It goes on to say that today Fuoshan (the town in the film where Ip Man is from) have become known as ""THE TOWN"" of martial arts. If you can't read Chinese, you won't know what that entire paragraph reads, and that's stupid because it's kind of important to the story.

The second thing I noticed is how poor the quality was. It's not so bad that it's unwatchable, but it's FAR worse than most DVD's I've owned.

Then the thing that made me stop watching this was the audio. For some reason they decided they didn't like the original audio stream and replaced it. But the first thing you'll notice is the volume. It's EXTREMELY low, you'll have to crank your system all the way up if you are to hear anything.

Then the next thing you'll notice is the bad syncing of the lips and of the fighting sound effects. The reason for this isn't apparent to those who don't know Chinese. But I do, I understand some Cantonese, which is a dialect of Chinese spoken most commonly by the ""common"" people, mainly from Canton. That is the language most of the people speak in this movie, except the Japs of course and those fighters from the North who spoke Mandarin. However, this is the reason why they redid the entire audio stream including the sound effects. They changed the audio from Cantonese to all Mandarin. I don't know why, perhaps this version was printed in China and they consider Mandarin the ""official"" dialect and kind of look down on Cantonese, Hakka, and other Chinese dialects.

To those who don't know the difference, this sucks because now the audio is too soft and the syncing is bad (you see a hit, then hear it, or vice versa) and they neglected to add back in some of the little verbal gestures Chinese people are known to make (like going ""mmm"" instead of actually saying yes, they did this in the original movie, but they omitted a lot of it in this print, instead, it's just silence).

But to those who understand Chinese, it also sucks because it takes the authenticity away since the film's locale's native language is Cantonese, so in real life, they would have been speaking Cantonese, not Mandarin, and people know this. That's why they had the inhabitants of this city speaking Cantonese and the fighters from the North that came down to challenge them spoke Mandarin. That is how it was and that is how they wanted to portray it. Now everyone spoke Mandarin and it's pretty annoying.

Either that or the Cantonese audio stream is so jarbled that I don't understand it. All I know is that when I first watched this movie, I understood almost all of it since I know Cantonese. When I bought this DVD, I couldn't understand any of it and had to use the subtitles... Not to mention I could barely hear it.

I don't know, the movie is a great movie, it is kind of like Fearless, but a little more historically accurate, Fearless was VERY inaccurate in terms of historical accuracy, this was a bit better, but the fighting is very different because this is Wing Chun, which is purely a close range fighting technique, which is where almost all fights end up anyhow so it's also the most practical of all martial arts in my opinion. You will almost NEVER get into a street fight where your opponent will stay a leg's length away from you so you can do Tae Kwon Do style kicks at them. That is completely unrealistic and exclusive to competition style fighting. In real fights, your opponent will tend to want to close the distance any chance he gets. So Wing Chun which focuses on close in, short arm fighting is perfect for that.

I suggest you watch this film, but I really would like to find a better print than this one, I know it exists because I've seen it not too long ago, a friend had it, but he doesn't have the box or anything and doesn't know what version it is.",1235347200,64,4514,4.469660194174757
