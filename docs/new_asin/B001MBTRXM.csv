8529807,4,B001MBTRXM,"This is an amazing story about survival, but it is an upsetting and melancholy story at the same time about how difficult it is to be sick in America with an unusual disease.  I saw a friend of mine get sick with an illness that he couldn't get diagnosed with for a long time and this story reminded of his struggle.  It's shot in a mostly first person manner and I was frequently impressed with the cinematography and it's interesting use of overlapping sound in certain scenes.  All in all, this is a very worthwhile movie and while it's not for everyone, those of you who have been through a terrible illness or seen others go through it will have a strong connection to this independent film...the best 13 bucks I've spent on a DVD  in a while.",1277769600,,748,4.398550724637682
8529808,4,B001MBTRXM,"I honestly sort of stumbled on this on amazon and thought I'd give it a shot since I enjoy independent films.  I wasn't really expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by this little doc made by a film student while he was suffering from an unusual and difficult to diagnose disease.  It's shot in a sort of rough-and-ready style primarily by the student himself, with a number of `video diary' scenes, but there are also extraordinary moments of beauty such as a montage of spring and a bitter one of winter that reflects his deteriorating condition.

`Of Unknown Etiology' certainly isn't for those who are used to Hollywood-style filmmaking with high production values and hyperactive editing, but for those who are willing to sit with John and his 90 minute journey to hell and back again it is a poignant little adventure.",1276646400,,830,4.830985915492958

8529810,5,B001MBTRXM,This movie is really interesting.  It's really fascinating to see how someone who is sick and has no idea what is wrong with them still learns to function in everyday life.  It definitely makes you appreciate being healthy!  I definitely recommend this movie.,1229040000,,259,4.976744186046512
