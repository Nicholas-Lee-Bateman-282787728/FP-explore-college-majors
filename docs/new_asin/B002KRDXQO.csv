8372196,3,B002KRDXQO,"As TNA inched closer to yet another Bound for Glory, they tried their hand at a theme PPV a bit like ""Lockdown"" and ""Slammiversary"" where, in this case, all the matches were contested under some form of hardcore rules (although several matches are wrestled as regular matches) much like WCW Uncensored was originally done. ""Hard Justice"" successfully bounced back from the abhorrent ""Victory Road"", but the failure of a few key matches kept it from being a total win.

The matches that didn't deliver were big ones: the TNA Title three-way between Matt Morgan, Sting and Kurt Angle was a short, unimaginative bout that lacked urgency and the TNA Legends Title match featured Kevin Nash trying--and mostly failing--to carry Mick Foley to a good match. Neither of these matches are terrible, they're just not anything worth writing home about. (To be fair, I would've killed for that three-way at ""Victory Road"", which is an indictment on that show more than anything!)

What saves the show are two solid tag team matches with Beer Money/the British Invasion and Team3D/Booker T & Steiner. Also, Abyss surprised with a pretty decent hardcore brawl with Jethro Holliday. But the REAL reason to watch this show is a really good Samoa Joe title defense against Homicide; they only get 9 minutes, but they knock it out of the park during that time.

There are a few other matches on the show, but nothing was really notable. That being said, there's nothing downright awful on this show and the highs are good enough to warrant a recommendation.",1411344000,,1539,4.888888888888889
8372197,4,B002KRDXQO,i like this one but it's not the best.,1405382400,,38,3.3333333333333335
8372198,2,B002KRDXQO,The PPV failed to move the storylines and push any wrestlers. The only good matches are the Legends title match between Mick Foley & Kevin Nash which was a real bloodbath and a good reminder of Mick's days in ECW and the Falls Count Anywhere match for the Tag Team title match between The Main Event Mafia(Booker T & Scott Steiner) & Team 3D(Brother Ray & Brother Devon) which was an arena-wide brawl that everyone excel at and a good reminder of the Steiner Bros.-Nasty Boys-NWA U.S tag team title match from Halloween Havoc 1990. The rest stink like a 5 year old hamburger. I give this dvd a 3 out of 10.,1315699200,,606,4.371681415929204
8372199,3,B002KRDXQO,"Steel Asylum Match: Suicide vs. Amazing Red vs. Jay Lethal vs. Daniels vs. Consequences Creed vs. Chris Sabin vs. Alex Shelley vs. D'Angelo Dinero - Before I get started, D'Angelo Dinero is the former Elijah Burke from WWE & this is his TNA debut.  As you can imagine, there is way too much action here to follow & try to summerize but this is the type of opening X division match you would expect as it was entertaining as hell from start to finish with tons of fast paced action, car crash bumps, and all sorts of innovative multiman action.  Keep an eye out on the Motor City Machine Guns during this match as their double teaming moves were a highlight reel in itself.

Abyss vs. Jethro Holliday - Again for those who don't already know, Holliday is the former Trevor Murdock from WWE & this is his TNA PPV debut.  This match was about Jetro trying to collect the $50,000 bounty Dr. Stevie had out on Abyss and all weapons were legal in this match.  Eventhough weapons were legal, there wasn't a heavy overload of thumbtacks, blood, and tables that you would normally expect from Abyss in this type of match as this was more about using a weapon like a chair to make regular moves more impactful.  This was the best performance you ever saw from Holliday in TNA resulting in a good solid match overall.

Hernandez vs. Big Rob Terry - This was for the ""Feast Or Fired"" case that the British Invasion stole from Hernandez months earlier & all I have to say here is that it will take longer to read my summary of this match than it will to just watch this squash so don't blink but this did it's job in making Hernandez coming off strong.

I.W.G.P. Tag Team Champions British Invasion vs. Beer Money Inc. - Eric Young, the leader of the ""World Elite"" faction, was at ringside on commentary.  This was a solid tag team match overall but look out for this one comedic spot involving the British Invasion landing in a ""akward"" position on each other.

TNA Knockout Champion Angelina Love & Velvet Sky vs. O.D.B. & Cody Deaner - To use an analogy, this is TNA's version of ""The Hills"" vs. ""King Of The Hill"" as these two teams are complete opposites of each other.  This match was a mix of the womens wrestling you would expect from the girls when O.D.B. was in & the comedy you would expect from Deaner as he just did what any horny man would do if he had a chance to get his hands on The Beautiful People & get away with it.  This is one of those matches where if you get the joke & accept it for what it is, you'll enjoy it but if your strickly a fan of the womens wrestling the knockouts have been known for since the beginning of the division, you may want to skip this one but at least it was more entertaining than the last time couple of times wrestling federations tried these type of intergender matches.
As a side note, due to her visa issues...this was the last TNA PPV appearence of Angelina Love.

X Division Champion Homicide vs. Samoa Joe - This was about Samoa Joe returning to his roots in the X Division in order to continue the Main Event Mafia championship domination from last month's Victory Road.  As the announcers would point out during the match, Samoa Joe's return to the X Division resulted in us seeing more of the ""vintage Samoa Joe"" wrestling style that we used to see from him back in the early days of his TNA career as this was probably his best in-ring PPV performance in months since before the ""Nation Of Violence.""  This wasn't the quality of their Ring Of Honor 30+ min. classics from early in their wrestling careers but it was still a solid contest overall between these two that also told a good story at times between Taz ""the teacher"" & Joe ""the student.""

Falls Count Anywhere Match: TNA Tag Team Champions Scott Steiner & Booker T vs. Team 3D - As you expect with anyone Team 3D is in a No DQ type of match, it didn't stay in the ring long as they fought through the crowd & ringside area using anything they can get their hands on in either the guardrail or steel chairs with Scott Steiner even pulling out a drive off the beachers at one point.  It started off as a brawl & stayed that way as they went back into the ring as the tables came into play at one point.  The match had an crappy ending after that got ""B.S."" chants from the crowd (the writers must have watched too many football games) but it didn't take away from what was a good & fun brawl and the best performances from Booker T & Scott Steiner on PPV in months.

TNA Legends Champion Mick Foley vs. Kevin Nash - As pointed out on the prematch bullet points, this was ""pride & respect"" vs. ""power & money.""  This was a match that told a good story about having it build up overtime as it started off as a regular match but slowly started turning into a bloody brawl (to the point where some got on the camera) with even Foley even showing signs of morphing into his into past hardcore personas of Mankind & Cactus Jack at various points.  This
resuled in a performance from both men that was way better than you would have expected going in with their work styles and physical limitations.  Tune in afterwards as you saw the first interaction between one longtime TNA superstar & the legend he was always compared to.

TNA Champion Kurt Angle vs. Sting vs. Matt Morgan - If you pay attention to the backstage interviews, this match played out the exact same way you expected it was a glorified handicap match as Morgan & Angle targeted Sting throughout the match what you expected to happen between Morgan & Angle happened resulting in Kurt Angle outsmarting everyone.  This was just more of a typical average three way dance than anything else with nothing really standing out overall past the overall story being told between Morgan & Angle.

So in the end, there really wasn't a bad match on here but there are a couple of times (Knockouts title/the Hernandez squash/the 3 way main event) where your either going to like or hate depending on if you accept the match for what it is & the story they were telling but overall, this is a TNA event worth checking out.",1254268800,,6077,4.385231316725979
8372200,4,B002KRDXQO,"I was amazed by Slammiversary, horridly disappointed by Victory Road, and as a result, I don't know what to expect coming into Hard Justice 2009. Since all the matches are under hardcore rules, the X-Division is represented, and D'Angelo Dinero (a.k.a Elijah Burke from WWE) is making his TNA debut in the Steel Asylum Match, I have a good feeling about this...

Steel Asylum #1 Contender's TNA X-Division Championship Match: Alex Shelley vs. Chris Sabin vs. Consequences Creed vs. Daniels vs. D'Angelo Dinero vs. Jay Lethal vs. Suicide vs. The Amazing Red
This match was freaking amazing, and so far, the match of the night (yes, hilarious joke since it is the first match). There wasn't even a second in the match where it wasn't absolutely exciting. Everyone did their part, with plenty of high action and unique double-team moves that prove that The Motor City Machineguns and Lethal Consequences need to get into the tag team picture soon. Amazing Red also proved his worth by falling off the top of the asylum and also hitting a hurracanrana...INTO A DDT WITH HIS FRIGGIN' LEGS! There were a few spots where a bunch of wrestlers would be up on the top turnbuckle and then they'd hit a giant move on each other all at the same time. A particularly impressive moment came when Suicide was super German suplexed off of the top turnbuckle and right into a bunch of other contestants! Alex Shelley got his face SMASHED into the asylum, and D'Angelo Dinero, formerly known as Elijah Burke in WWE, was also pretty impressive in his TNA debut match. He hit a Spear off the top ropes onto Daniels that came out of nowhere, and he also took a super STO from Daniels. Phenomenal match with a strange ending. Dinero, or ""The Pope"" as they're calling him, could've won the match, but he decided to attack Suicide, and he threw Suicide into the steel asylum in a sickening manner, giving Daniels the opportunity to climb out and win. PHENOMENAL match that should be seen by any TNA and any wrestling fan in general. Thank God they improved from last month and had the X-Division! Daniels is the #1 contender now. Winner: Daniels. Match Rating: 5/5

Hardcore Bounty Match: Abyss vs. Jethro Holliday (with Dr. Stevie)
Jethro Holliday, previously known as Trevor Murdoch in the WWE, has taken up on Dr. Stevie's offer to pay $50,000 to anyone who can beat Abyss. The match actually started out as a straight-wrestling contest, which was actually quite exciting. There was some psychology carried over from Victory Road with Holliday using the stick thing that Stevie used last month. When chairs got involved though, Holliday countered a move by Abyss to send the chair RIGHT into Abyss's crotch! Holliday would later get his head smashed into a chair set up in the turnbuckles, similarly to the fate that Stevie had last month as well. Got to love that kind of psychology in a hardcore match. Amazingly, Holliday kicked out of the Chokeslam, and using Stevie's distraction, got the advantage on Abyss. Holliday got ready with a pair of brass knuckles, only to have Abyss, predictably, counter it with the Black Hole Slam for the win. Pretty good match I suppose, but it was too short. After the match, Stevie got pissed off at Holliday, to which Holliday responded to by beating up on Stevie. Winner: Abyss. Match Rating: 4/5

Hardcore TNA World Heavyweight Championship Feast or Fired Briefcase Match: Big Rob (with The British Invasion) vs. Hernandez
What the hell? Instead of actually giving us a match, they gave us...eh, I'll get to it later. The British Invasion stole the briefcase from Hernandez, which guarantees a title shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at any time, similarly to the Money in the Bank deal in WWE. Regardless, the match started out with Hernandez tricking Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams into hitting Big Rob after powering out of a full-nelson applied by Rob (by the way, last month, ""Big Rob"" was known as Rob Terry...don't ask me what happened). Hernandez then hit a running shoulder block to...get the FREAKING pin. A joke match, but at least it wasn't a bad match that ran on forever. Winner: Hernandez. Match Rating: 2/5

IWGP Tag Team Championship Match: The British Invasion (Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams) (Champions) vs. Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm)
Apparently, TNA management changed their mind about the ""every match is a hardcore match"" stipulation, because there were a ton of moments in this match that clearly contradicted that previous statement. Disappointing, but the match was still actually quite good. Beer Money was the highlight, obviously, with plenty of exciting tag team offense. Magnus and Williams still botched a few moves here and there, unfortunately, but there was still some good moments with them. One particular spot was where either Magnus or Williams was in the tree of woe, and then Roode and Storm dragged his partner's crotch RIGHT into his face, which then caused him to fall out of the tree of woe, onto his partner (I have a hard time telling Williams and Magnus apart...hehe) in a 69 position! Beer Money was about to hit the DWI, but Eric Young, who was doing commentary, slid a title belt in and distracted the referee. This gave Williams and Magnus the opportunity to hit Roode with the title belt and retain the titles as Storm chased off Young. Good match, but they completely ignored the stipulation of the night. Winners: The British Invasion. Match Rating: 4/5

Special Stipulations Tag Team TNA Women's Knockout Championship Match: Angelina Love (Champion) and Velvet Sky (with Madison Rayne) vs. ODB and Cody Deaner
Yet another match that completely ignores the ""hardcore"" rules. It's a shame though, considering we know that women can actually put on good hardcore matches, especially in TNA with Taylor Wilde and Daffney. It'd be interesting to see more of that. Anyway, the special stipulation here was that if ODB or Deaner get the pin, ODB becomes champion. If Love or Sky get the pin, then Love retains the title. Love and ODB put on a decent match for a little while, with some basic offense, but when Sky and Deaner got in, Deaner started spanking Sky so hard her entire ass was a dark red. As the match progressed, Deaner kissed Love, Sky, AND Rayne, but when Sky countered a...hump attempt by holding onto Deaner so Rayne could spray him in the face with the hairspray (the referee was distracted by ODB and Love brawling), Deaner ducked, and Sky got it in the face! Deaner then rolled Sky up for the victory! It was ""eh"" really, with just enough spunk that I'm not going to take it down a notch. Honestly, ODB vs. Love would have been better, but oh well. After the match, Deaner ran off with the title, thinking he deserved it, and Sky and Love almost attacked Rayne, but the referee held them back. Winners: ODB and Cody Deaner. Match Rating: 4/5

TNA X-Division Championship Match: Homicide (Champion) vs. Samoa Joe (with Taz)
A fast-paced and exciting match that was actually quite good and ANOTHER great match. There was a ton of high-flying action and plenty of exciting spots, with Joe hitting suplexes on Homicide and Homicide hitting some impressive offense on Joe that included a sick neckbreaker and a cutter. Joe, at one point, applied a bunch of different submissions on Homicide in succession, including the Crossface, but Homicide later powered out of the Coquina Clutch. Joe hit his signature suicide dive and Homicide flipped THROUGH the middle rope and onto Joe at another point, but Taz distracted Homicide long enough for Joe to recover. Back in the ring, Joe locked in the Coquina Clutch and countered a takedown pin attempt by Homicide to add a body scissors, forcing Homicide to tap out. It was short, fast, and exciting as hell. This is what TNA is all about. Winner: Samoa Joe. Match Rating: 5/5

Hardcore TNA World Tag Team Championship Match: The Main Event Mafia (Booker T and Scott Steiner) (Champions) vs. Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon)
ANOTHER phenomenal match. The match started off as a brawl, and then spilled into the crowd. Scott Steiner nailed a flying clothesline OFF a cement barricade down quite a bit onto Brother Ray on the cement floor. There were plenty of chair shots on Brother Ray as well, while Devon dominated Booker T for most of the match, and even slammed him on the outside. When the fight went back into the ring, Team 3D had the advantage, though Booker saved Steiner from getting a Doomsday Device through a table! Ray then received a Book End through the table, and MEM had the advantage from there on. Booker missed the Axe Kick, which allowed Devon and Ray to hit the 3D!!! However, Steiner rolled Ray up just as Devon pinned Booker, and the two referees involved in the contest made simultaneous counts! Per referee decision, MEM was declared the winner!!! An awesome hardcore brawl that was just as exciting psychologically wise as it was hardcore wise. Winners: The Main Event Mafia. Match Rating: 5/5

Hardcore TNA Legends Championship Match: Mick Foley (Champion) vs. Kevin Nash
Could it be? Yet ANOTHER perfect match? Well, not quite. It was almost there, though. This was a straight brawl, with action on the outside, chair shots, and a unique counter at one point when Foley went for his elbow drop off the apron, only to have a chair thrown at his elbow, causing his fist to jab into his eye and bust him open EVERYWHERE. Nash got busted open when his face was slammed onto the steel steps. Foley pulled out the barbed wire baseball bat, but then Traci ran down to the ring and jumped on the apron. Nash hit the Big Boot on Foley, causing Foley to knock Traci off the apron (Traci used to manage Beer Money, Inc. and she's in The Main Event Mafia nowadays), and then Nash got the pinfall. Too short with a weak ending, but it was still highly entertaining. Afterwards, Abyss ran out with a barbed wire baseball bat to protect Foley from Nash. Winner: Kevin Nash. Match Rating: 4/5

Three Way TNA World Heavyweight Championship Match: Kurt Angle (Champion) vs. Matt Morgan vs. Sting
I used to hate Matt Morgan before this match. After this match, I respect him as a performer and a wrestler and I hope to see him in more main events after this. Everyone did their signature stuff, and Sting actually dominated both men for quite a while in the early portion of the match. Morgan and Angle were on the same side and double-teamed Sting for a while, but then when Sting threw Morgan into the ropes, Angle pulled the ropes down and Morgan fell to the concrete! A pissed off Morgan then started fighting Angle, and he hit the Carbon Footprint on Angle! In the ring, Sting kicked out of an Angle Slam and a Carbon Footprint!!! Sting then hit the Scorpion Death Drop on Morgan, but MORGAN KICKED OUT!!! I'm not even kidding. Angle tried to lock on the Ankle Lock on Sting, but Sting locked on the Scorpion Death Lock on Morgan. Sting countered the Angle Slam into an arm drag that was done beautifully. Morgan hit another Carbon Footprint on Sting, but as he was about to win, Angle pulled the referee out of the ring! Carrying a steel chair into the ring, Angle SMASHED it on Morgan's head, tossed Sting out of the ring, and then pinned Morgan!!! Awesome match!!! Matt Morgan has really proved himself. Please, please, please Angle vs. Morgan at No Surrender! Winner: Kurt Angle. Match Rating: 5/5

OVERALL EVENT
Hard Justice, to put it simply, was AWESOME. There was only one weak match, that being the ""match"" with Hernandez and Big Rob. The rest of the card was phenomenal, and I can't wait for their next pay-per-view. I hope it doesn't disappoint like Victory Road did.",1252627200,,11662,4.75172754195459
