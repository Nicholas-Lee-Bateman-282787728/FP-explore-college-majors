8432897,5,B004KDZM1K,"A strong stomach helps while viewing DCI Bain's final series. Mysteries bathed in blood, crime, grit, disgust, death, violence--but also with some rustic, rugged, Welch scenery, & touching father/daughter moments. Welch graphic crime thriller footage and engaging suspense, makes Bain  (Philip Madoc--""The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes"" ""The Last of the Mohicans"") is a crack police investigator, a widower, a father of a 17-year-old girl, with the toughness of ""Callan"" (British thriller series)  a top cop to watch in the murder investigation field. You may turn away at some of the blood and violence but never turn the set off. Who-what-how-when-where is too complex and draws the viewer to a must-find-out conclusion. His tenderness toward his daughter and the sometimes excess of episode murders sometimes resemble ""Midsomer Murders"" (a must hit series). Rough like ""Murphy's Law"", another strong-stomach series.

Episodes contain only a handful of regular cast. Daughter Hannah (Ffion wilkins) does well in every episode. Sharon Morgan is the pathologist, Margaret, and love looks to be in the air at times. These two help with comic relief amid all the gritty crime, as well as offering and receiving affection.

An honest box warning: ""Contains nudity and graphic scenes"" is true to the extreme! Specifically, ""A MIND TO KILL SERIES 1"" is abundant with violence, male and female nudity, blood, foul language, sex, mutilation, race issues, family violence, homosexuality, drug use, and other derelictions that exist alongside murders. NOT FOR KIDS or the squeamish! Not much left uncovered in this unrated Welsh detective drama. But it is well written, high-suspense, thriller mystery drama.

SUBTITLES-yes!
8 episodes average 97 min. each--feature-length+, like 8 theater films, a value. Text bonus is notes from daughter WPC Hannah, the forensic cop, & DS Alison
Now for DIEhards, the dark and bloody episode details (order of appearance on DVDs):
1 SHADOW FALLS- Welch DCI is back after a leave. A suspicious child suicide at a waterfall, but Bain digs deeper at his daughter Hannah's suggestion. She, as a side plot, is considering a school change. A shocking shared 3-coupled secret is dark & discovered.

2 BOX- Crime is a psychotic, pervert, kidnapper who kills. While this investigation progresses, Bain tries to deal with Hannah--at the station--a new copper--& soon in danger--worst possible. Intense episode.

3 THE LITTLE HOUSE IN THE FOREST- Did the forest dwelling pedophile kill a teenage girl? Bain teams with a young cop to solve this case--much to her dismay.

4 SOUNDBITES- fire is the chosen form of revenge for an abandoned son with a schizophrenic mom & politician dad.

5 THE INNER LIFE OF STRANGERS- Wales Pop Singer star, Meesh, retires & heads home. First one, then another, and another connections are murdered. Bain must try to stop her from being a next victim.

6 COLOUR BLIND- Racial tension leads to a death. It will require Bain & his crime team to keep this community from a violent eruption. Possible?? Racism & Relationships criss-cross.

7 ENGINEER- A post-surgical coma causes parents to act desperately. The Doc's daughter disappears in a bloody trail. Can Bain's team stop additional tragedy?

8 BLOOD AND WATER- A foster brother kills pregnant sister. The killer's blood (excuse the pun) brother (a cop) covers for him. A murder4ous family mess of a crime for Bain. The homey final scene is a smashing way to end ""A MIND to KILL"" final episode.

This is Series 3. It could serve as a stand alone series, just like each episode can. But there is a family and cop relationship that carries from one episode to another beginning with Episode 1 in Series 1. So if you like this, try the other ""A MIND to KILL"" series as well. I did.

Now...if you dare...",1298678400,8,3795,5.080385852090032
