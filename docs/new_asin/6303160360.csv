And so do I!",1247097600,,165,5.037037037037037
8014116,5,6303160360,"Excellent, upbeat video!  Students enjoyed the music and presentation.  They were actually able to remember the answers to review questions.
However, I would have prefered to see the digestive system or respitory system included rather than the episode on the skin, even though it was also fun and informative.
I liked the presentation and will most certainly purchase additional videos in the near future.",1005004800,15,406,5.328125
