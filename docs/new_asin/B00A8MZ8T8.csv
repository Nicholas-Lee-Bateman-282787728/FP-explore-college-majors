8548331,5,B00A8MZ8T8,Happy I didn't have to purchase the full set again.,1496275200,,51,4.2
8548332,5,B00A8MZ8T8,"I love this work out. I have been extremely fit and extremely out of shape after both my pregnancies. It is a great way to get started again and really does work if you do it everyday and watch your diet. The dance moves help give you better posture if you do them with hood form. Overall excellent way to get started again, a good stepping stone!",1466208000,,347,4.1940298507462686
8548333,1,B00A8MZ8T8,"This is one of the worst Dance Off the Inches DVDs. The instructor is annoying and it is unbelievably easy. You won't get any cardio or strength! I recommend instead either one of Jennifer Galardi's DVDs that has an abs or strength segment, or Turbo Jam, which is dancy but has good ab and strength work.",1455062400,,304,4.446428571428571
8548334,5,B00A8MZ8T8,Wonderful workout. So much fun!!!! I normally do Walk workouts with Leslie Sansone and I'm trying to do more variety and so glad that I tried this!,1400889600,,147,4.481481481481482
8548335,5,B00A8MZ8T8,"Has two 30 minute workouts and they are excellent. We do both each time and we really love the DVD.  It rates high in our group's collection.  Also, you can use toning sticks or weights. One dvd that you can do without getting down on the floor",1385856000,3,244,4.170212765957447
8548336,5,B00A8MZ8T8,"This is a great workout especially for someone that's beginning to get back into
fitness regardless of your age. I didn't feel overwhelmed trying to keep up.
This is one of my keepers, treasures.",1360022400,2,195,4.764705882352941
