1060188,1,6305721580,Don't buy this DVD because the movie is so boring. I 's lucky because I just rented it but not buying it. This is not one of collection or entertainment.,962236800,,153,4.133333333333334
1060189,4,6305721580,"I was edgy when I first saw this in the video store, but being an absolute Bowie fan I had to rent it. The only thing that is wrong with this movie is the fast english accents that all the actors have (imagine that- it's an  english film!). Disgust, love, betrayal, hate, apathy.. the emotions run  wild with this film! See it! cause who's great? DAVID BOWIE.",951955200,,359,4.343283582089552
1060190,3,6305721580,This film was a huge disapointment. The only bright spot was David Bowie. He played a old school gangster book keeper and was brilliant in his role. Goldie on the other hand should seriously consider sticking to his muzak.,949881600,,222,4.717948717948718
1060566,5,6305721580,"IF YOU ARE B MOVIE FAN, BRITISH GANGSTA FAN, AND OR HAD A HOUSE DANCE CREW IN THE LATE80S EARLY 90'S THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU.  THE HIP HOUSE DANCE ROUTINE IS ENOUGH TO BUY THE DVD. I SAW THIS MOVIE ON CABLE, AND I KNEW I NEEDED A COPY FOR ME AT THE CRIB.",1221696000,,256,3.5714285714285716
1060567,5,6305721580,"To put it bluntly, the film is great. The story is about family and how nobody can pull these two (Terry and Ray) apart... at least that's how Terry sees it. Along the way, Ray's little UK Garage style dance group finally gets the chance to do a show at a big club but under what consequence? The story has great plot twists making you wonder who is really behind all the killing which is later revealed in a voicemail that Ray receives at the end of the film.

The film features a good soundtrack, mostly UK Garage and breakbeat style tracks. It's too bad we didn't hear any DnB or Jungle. The image of the gangsters is quite solid with their nice armored black cars with bangin sound systems. Bowie's performance is good and in the intro you get to see his eyes in their true form and up close... one eye dilated and the other not.

Overall, in this genre of film, it's top notch... especially if you can relate to the nuances and scene that this is placed in. If you're not all that into UK urban culture or gangster flicks, it might not make a good flick to check, but otherwise... HIT IT UP!",1181692800,,1096,4.264423076923077
1060568,5,6305721580,"Goldie and David Bowie star in this gritty crime thriller. The film opens with Ray (Andrew Goth) and Terry (Goldie) getting released from jail. The two are cousins, long-time friends, and fellow gang members. Ray wants to go straight, have a family and a real job. Terry wants to get back in the business and does so with a life of crime. He makes a killing selling drugs to school kids, enlarges his already sizeable arsenal, and intimidates all who encroach on his turf, especially a mysterious Chinese gang. During Terry's incarceration, gang matters were left to the button-down super-efficient dealings of Bernie (Bowie); after his release, tensions between the two thugs rapidly build. Seeing Ray's return to the straight life as weakness, the evil jealous Terry kidnaps and tortures Ray's girlfriend. Ray resolves to get revenge and an ultra-violent shoot out soon ensues. The ending shall leave you in suspense......",1053129600,7,924,5.125827814569536
1060569,5,6305721580,"This quintessentially British movie will prob. leave many Americans confused... but its a terrific film! Called ""Everybody Loves Sunshine"" in the rest of the world, Busted tells the tale of two half-brothers who start (or try to) new lives after prison. One returns whole-hog to crime, while the other gets caught up in the Garage-club scene and starting a performance group.
There's a quasi-sexual tension between Goth and Goldie, but nothing overtly obvious... this is really not that kind of movie.
Bowie plays his business-manager villain expertly. Cold, calculated and ruthless. It's brilliant!
US audiences will undountedly find the ruff accents to be difficult at times to understand, but the movie captures the grim reality of UK gang wars very well - gangsta life is not a uniquely American thing, after all!
The soundtrack is brilliant, featuring some really nice Jungle, Garage and Ragga sounds... its too bad that this is not available in the States. :-(
Highly recommended for fans of British criminal movies.",1041465600,,1022,5.2
1060570,5,6305721580,"I watched BUSTED because I saw it advertised somewhere and so I went out to buy it.  BUSTED is very good movie.  The action, story line, and the music was good.  I was a little disapointed that David Bowie's music wasn't heard.  Because I watched BUSTED I am now a Goldie fan. I have most of his CDs.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes action, Goldie or Bowie. Oh and Andrew Goth is really cute he also directed this film.",1018310400,2,431,4.2073170731707314
1060571,4,6305721580,"Stylish low budget UK gangsta picture set in Manchester: drum'n'bass and ragga soundtrack with bass at realistic nightclub/car audio volumes (at least on the DVD version).  Expect your subwoofer(s) to get a good workout, and things to fall off the walls.  Maybe the boy-band-ish dance act is a little cheesy, but the violence and bass make up for it.

While the sound on the DVD is excellent, the video is full-screen (4:3) only, and not very sharp.  Some of the text in the credits is nearly illegible.  See the forum for this movie at IMDB for a transcription of the soundtrack listing.",1010448000,3,588,4.7254901960784315

1060574,3,6305721580,I was so pumped to find a copy of this for $10. After the first viewing I was a bit dissapointed. It's a bizarre movie that I am enjoying more and more as I watch it. The music is phat and I have to find the soundtrack if there is one out there. I love Bowie and Goldie so this film fits right in my collection. Take it at face value and enjoy the beats.,970358400,,354,3.7333333333333334

7893096,5,6305721580,"What can I say?  I am an absolute David Bowie fan and I adore everything with him in it.  Some people have rated this movie low, but I like it... I guess it depends on personal taste and how much of a fan you are, don't expect a piece of art cinema with this one, but also don't fully dismiss it. It is a good movie to watch on a rainy day at home.",1466380800,,348,3.689189189189189

7893101,5,6305721580,"In the UK...the film is called Everybody Loves Sunshine ( based on the book) Never did understand that title. The American tile still doesn't make much sense....although I would like to think it refers to the climax of the film.

This is one twisted movie with one twisted villain. so the story goes were two cousins are released from prison. They are both part of a drug gang run by David Bowie no less.
One of them (Ray) wants to leave the past behind. The other ( Terry) wants him to stay in; and would do anything to make certain he does.

Terry ( Goldie) steals the movie. It's his movie. He is really a frightening character if you look past his gold teeth.
Terry is also infatuated with Ray. There is a homosexual undercurrent running with concerns to Terry. When Terry walks in on Ray doing some pull ups...you know Terry has the hots for his cousin;
which brings me to something that always confused me. Are they really cousins ? Other characters refer to them as such...but it's somewhat vague. Also...what happened to the two of them in prison ? was it ray who protected the volatile Terry?

The film has a great ending ...even though I had to watch it again to hear what I think I heard. It's a sad ending for both Terry and Ray...especially Ray. That's not giving away anything...its just the kind of ending no one saw coming. At least I didn't on first viewing.",1416268800,,1375,4.448412698412699

The story is universal, not just for Britain. Two cousins that grew up together like brothers become gangstas. They both go into jail. When they get out, one wants to remain in the game the other wants a different life.
David Bowie is in this film and place gangsta (funny to me!).",1369958400,,440,4.313253012048193
