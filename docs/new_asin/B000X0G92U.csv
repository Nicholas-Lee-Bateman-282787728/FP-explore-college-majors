2993418,5,B000X0G92U,"a little bit sad, and very good. memorable characters plus a captivating story. you should watch it.",1203379200,2,100,4.9411764705882355
2993419,5,B000X0G92U,"The story about a girl who conquered time was first made popular by the much-revered novel by now legendary author Yasutaka Tsutsui. Since then, it has seen many other variations and adaptations including one television series and a couple feature-length live action films. Now this story has finally found its way to the world of animation. And the results are fantastic.

One school day, an ordinary girl unknowingly gains the ability to ""leap through time"", enabling her to travel to different stages from her memory. After learning how to control this power she has discovered, she begins to realize the responsibilities and consequences that result from using it and how it begins to affect her and those around her. It really is a unique blend of melodrama, romance, comedy, and science fiction, but you will hardly notice any genre while you are watching. The voice-acting and sound are quality, and the character designs by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (Wings of Honneamise, Evangelion) are superb. The movie's artistry is remarkably subtle for an animated feature even without much impeccable detail, making the whole visual presentation very fitting for a story of its kind.

Believe me when I say you don't have to be familiar with the story in order to enjoy it, and for those who have already seen previous incarnations of Tsutsui's novel this will be yet another take on a classic that will be very much to your liking. Overall, this was terrific and I recommend it to anyone who wants to treat themselves to a good movie that will keep you interested from beginning to end. It managed to capture the Japan Academy Prize for Best Animation of 2006, and it did so for good reasons. See it now!",1195257600,26,1696,4.865051903114187

2993447,5,B000X0G92U,"Quite simply put, Mamoru Hosada's The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is one of the greatest anime films ever made. Without spoiling too much, it touches on all kinds of social issues from bullying to awareness of one's surroundings and the people in them. The main idea presented here, however, is that it is best in life to deal with one's problems as they come instead of running from them. This film is cute and fun in most places, but still remains harsh and biting in others. Truly a masterpiece. For the fan of Makoto Shinkai's work, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is an excellent starting point for the exploration of the anime genre.",1517356800,5,639,4.565217391304348

2993469,2,B000X0G92U,"**SPOILER FREE**
The trailer makes this movie look like a mix of groundhog day and the butterfly effect, what with implying she's going to die and that she is altering everyone's future for the worse. Neither of those are really a major theme of the movie.  I was really excited to see it, and thus was disappointed as a result.
The movie isn't terrible, but it doesn't have the depth I was hoping for and ends without any real resolution.  Overall I wouldn't recommend it.",1512864000,2,473,4.552941176470588

2993487,4,B000X0G92U,"I truly enjoyed this movie because it reminds me of an animated, teenage Ground Hog Day. The animation was incredibly beautiful, and it had a lot of solid moments as far as movies go. I actually had to rewind and watch certain parts because of how amazing the animation, pace and lines were delivered. It just left a visceral feeling in my gut about what it means to grow up. The plucky leading lady is easy to like, as well as her gaggle of friends. You really get wrapped up in their stories. And even though I have a western perspective compared to the intended cultural audience, I think it plays well with everyone in that degree. The story line is easy follow, and it really draws you in on a personal level when the characters' are in peril. I think the ""How"" of the story line isn't as great as the overall telling of the story, but I still loved it because the characters were likable. The ending felt a tinge unsatisfying to me, but that's because it was left on an open note. Nonetheless, it's solid storytelling!",1505779200,,1024,4.423280423280423

I enjoyed the style of animation and the writing was often amusing but I found the ending has perhaps lost something in translation. I just didn't get it.

2993604,5,B000X0G92U,"Just finished watching ""The Girl Who Leapt Through TIme"" released by Funimation.
Although I've had ""The Girl Who Leapt Through TIme"" sitting amongst the shelves of my DVD cases for several years now - actually the original unopened DVD release is sitting in a drawer in Jeff H.'s condo - I never got around to watching it until last night.  I had gotten the newly released blue-ray version because Jeff H. is still being an idiot about ""Fencegate"" and is afraid his parents will highly disapprove if we ""gasp"" watch a DVD at his place.  [For the record, Jeff H. does turn 35 years old  this month.]
I shouldn't have waited so long to watch this vibrantly and compelling anime which is based on the original manga - ""Toki wa Kakeru Shoujo.""
At first, it seems that ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is a typical manga about a young school girl - Makoto Konno - who is having an incredible bad day.  Makoto oversleeps and is almost late for school.  She flunks a surprise pop quiz in her math class.  Makoto almost burns down the school in her cooking class.  She's spooked by someone in her science lab while she's dropping off notebooks and falls hard on the ground.  And to top it off, while running an errand for her mother after school,  the brakes on her bicycle fail and she get's killed at a train crossing.  Or does she?
At the moment of her impending death, Makoto discovers that she has the ability to leap backwards in time and change the future..
Disbelieving at first, but gaining confidence through multiple time leaps, Makoto does what anyone would - she makes her life better.  But there are unintended consequences for her actions and she learns that her ability to jump through time can cause great harm to other people.
Makoto does have an Aunt Witch who is an art restorer at a museum who she confides in about her ability to time leap.  Aunt Witch warns her niece that she is playing with fire.  Yet, there is something about Aunt Witch that is compelling.  She confesses that she had the ability  to time leap to, but lost it.  There are some hints that Aunt Witch is actually an adult version of Makoto.
Makoto is a bit of a tomboy; and her two best friends - the cheeky but endearing Chiaki Mamiya and evenheaded, gentlemanly Kosuke Tsuda - are her best friends and she uses her time leaping abilities to change their lives as well and sometimes not for the better.
Yet when Makoto does finally learn the truth about how she gained the ability to leap through time, she must use her fading ability to save Kosuke, who is fated to die in the same accident that she almost did in.
""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is an enduring anime that lingers with you long after the final scene.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

I was pleasantly surprised to see that the series was re-released on blu-ray and purchased it right away even though I already own in on DVD from a previous release so why do you ask did I give it 3/5 stars? well because the first time I ordered it the item didn't come with the cardboard slip cover and the box for the disc was cracked so I ordered a replacement and the replacement didn't come with the cardboard slip cover either even though there are pictures from other buyers showing that they got slip covers with the item. In the end I just gave up and kept it because I don't want to keep on an endless loop of returning stuff and getting the same results back but its disappointing that your not getting everything thats supposed to come with the item for fans of the show.,1480291200,5,1246,4.261603375527426

2993641,5,B000X0G92U,"I consider myself a casual anime fan -- I don't love it all, but there are series I enjoy, and I have a deep love for the films of Miyazaki and his company Studio Ghibli.  I had heard of ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" via an offhand mention by an Internet reviewer, who called it ""Groundhog Day if Bill Murray were a teenage girl.""  And while I wasn't expecting Miyazaki levels of mastery, I figured it was worth a watch.  The basic premise seemed cute and fun, even if it wasn't particularly groundbreaking.

If you go into this movie expecting a thrilling sci-fi action flick, you'll be disappointed.  But if you're in the mood for a sweet coming-of-age story that just happens to feature time travel, this film is excellent.

""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" follows Makoto, a high school student who's having the worst day of her life -- running late for school, flunking an important quiz, accidentally starting a fire during home economics... and being hit by a train on the way home from school.  And yet somehow, she managed to undo that last stroke of bad luck by jumping several seconds back in time.  Her aunt, an art restoration expert at a local museum, reveals to her that she has the ability to leap back in time, and Makoto is quick to find all sorts of fun, if mundane, uses for her ability.  She fixes her terrible day, aces her quiz, jumps back to experience her favorite dinner all over again, and stretches a karaoke session out to cover hours.  But soon she learns that not only is her time-leaping hurting others, but there's a limit to how many times she can leap... and her actions could hurt one of her friends, Chiaki, beyond repair.  With one leap remaining, can Makoto find a way to set things right?

The animation of this film isn't QUITE as good as the art of Studio Ghibli, and it does suffer from a few of the typical flaws one comes to expect in anime -- most notably same-face syndrome, vanishing noses, and mouths that slide to the side of the face.  But it's nonetheless gorgeous in its own right, with fluid animation, detailed and beautiful scenery shots, well-integrated CGI, and some imaginative (if a little trippy) visuals, especially during the leaps.  It's pleasant and even lovely to look at, without overtaking the story.

The characters in this series are well-done as well, feeling fleshed-out and believable.  Makoto is a character anyone can relate to, and though she tends to use her newfound ability for some stupid purposes, it's understandable -- who WOULDN'T use some fantastic ability for mundane purposes like sleeping in or fixing a simple mistake.  Her friends, Chiaki and Kousuke, are very different in personality (the laid-back and goofy Chiaki and the studious, serious Kousuke) but are likable characters, and even the stereotypical ""bratty little sister"" isn't just a one-note character but has a kind side as well.  And we get hints to Makoto's aunt, ""Auntie Witch,"" and that she might have experienced something similar to Makoto's newfound power when she was a girl...

The story focuses more on Makoto's progression as a character than on the specifics of her ability, and is more a unique coming-of-age story than a true sci-fi tale.  And I find that works.  The time-travel aspect is used as a tool rather than a silly gimmick, and it's through learning to use her power responsibly that Makoto matures and becomes a better person.  And while her story may ultimately be bittersweet, it's nonetheless heartwarming and satisfying to watch.

""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is an excellent film, less fantastic in nature than its name might suggest but still well worth watching.  It's a sweet tale with heartbreaking moments and a rewarding payoff, and well worth a look even if you're not an anime fan or prefer Studio Ghibli's output.  Probably best for ages 8 and up due to language and some dramatic moments.",1479254400,,3890,4.752976190476191

2993643,5,B000X0G92U,"Makota, the titular Girl Who Leapt Through Time, is a slightly eccentric Tokyo high school student who spends her days sleeping in and being late for class, playing baseball with her two male friends, Kousuke and Chiaki, and accidentally starting small fires in the chemistry lab.  One day at school she stumbles upon a discovery (not explained in full to either the viewer or Makota until late in the movie) that allows her to actually leap backwards in time.  She thinks this new ability is cool.  With little thought to the ramifications of her time jumps, she begins using her ability to jump back unlimited times in the morning to sleep as late as she wants without ever being late for class, correct embarassing or unwanted situations, and pondering her feelings for Kousuke and Chiaki; she's trying to decide if she likes one, both, or neither of them.  It's a charming and comedic anime that takes a turn into the metaphysical when it becomes apparant that Makota's time leaps aren't going unobserved, and when the movie begins tackling the question of where exactly this time travel comes from.  The movie has good animation, appealing characters, humor, mystery and emotion.

It's beautifully animated, and kind of like Shinkai's films, better appreciated if you don't think too hard about the logic - in this case, the logic of ""time leaps.""  Just accept it as a beautiful little story about a circle of friends, one of whom discovers she can jump back in time - and then has to deal with the consequences.

For those of us who have outgrown our school uniforms, it may also induce some measure of nostalgia for the days of forgotten homework, biking to the konbini, and after-class baseball. :)",1476921600,5,584,4.490566037735849

by how bad it was....

This is pretty clearly a problem with the time leaping, and nothing better illustrates my problem (and the director's problem) with time travel.  Great time travel stories, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steins-Gate/dp/B00KU3Y5CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steins Gate</a>, reveal themselves under pressure; bad ones, like the current movie, do the same.

High school student Makoto Konno climaxes a perfectly awful day by riding a malfunctioning bike to what should have been her death, but miraculously she manages to leap backwards in time and save her life.  What follows are a series of humorous incidents as Makoto basically misuses this mysterious power she has acquired until she suddenly realizes that lives are at stake as the power runs out.  So why only three stars?  Because of a sudden, blind, out of nowhere incident that literally makes no sense, especially when you remember what motivates a lot of her misdeeds.  This mishap is so unsettling, so astonishing that it utterly poisons the rest of the film, including the Sadder But Wiser Ending.

2993734,5,B000X0G92U,"Makoto (Emily Hirst) is an average teenager who enjoys spending her free time with her two best friends, Chiaki (Andrew Francis) and Kousuke (Alex Zahara). However, she has a particularly unlucky day that includes failing a math test and setting a fire in a home economics class. Things go from bad to worse for her when the brakes on her bicycle fail and ends up nearly losing her life colliding with a train. But she is saved when she suddenly discovers that she has the power to perform ""time leaps"" or the ability to essentially ""rewind"" time. Confused at first by this newfound power, she starts to use it to solve minor things in her own life including acing her math test and extending her leisure time. But it is not long before she realizes that this power can be used to manipulate the lives of those around her.

As a person whose knowledge of anime films is pretty much non-existent outside of the works of Studio Ghibli, this film caught my eye with an interesting sounding premise which reminded me of one of my favorite movies: 1993's Groundhog Day. I was not disappointed. To start off with, the characters in this film are simply great. There are no tired tropes in play here but the characters come off as realistic and likable. It is easy to like a character like Makoto as you watch her go through her life and attempt to use time leaps to improve it and sympathize with her when things do not always go according to plan. Likewise, the other characters come off as well written and enjoyable to watch. The writing in this film is quite excellent as it explores the possibilities and consequences of Makoto's time leaps. The film manages to use its premise to find humor that results in some very funny scenes. But at the same time, there are serious moments that come off as very touching. The animation itself, while not the best I have seen in the anime style, does work well. Characters are animated fluidly enough that do seem to be alive, but also cartoony at times to emphasize the emotions at hand.

If there is one criticism I have of this movie is that it comes off as somewhat unevenly paced. There are some spots where the movie just seems to slow down at awkward points and it becomes a little frustrating. However, this is only a minor point.

This set includes three discs. There is a standard DVD of the feature film, a DVD with some bonus features, and a Blu-ray with the feature film, which looks excellent, two audio commentaries, and storyboards.

This is a thoroughly enjoyable film that is sure to be enjoyed by fans of anime or just people that like a funny and touching animated film.",1468022400,,2628,4.537974683544304

2993764,3,B000X0G92U,"Funimation, you got me. Somehow, you managed to release a collector's edition with almost no collector value (just a small book that;s, well, OKAY), and a smushed plastic slipcover. That's bad enough, considering I got taken for a ride on the higher price. But then you put out an anime film without subtitles. (The listing says there are, but I can't find them in the menus and the subtitle button can't pull any up.) I guess I'm one of those annoying purists because with very rare exception, I prefer to watch with the original soundtrack. Which, ironically, is included. But what good is the original Japanese audio track if there aren't subtitles? I'm sure some anime fans speak fluent Japanese, but I'm not one of them. But doesn't it just seem like it shouldn't have even been a question to include them?

A disappointing release of a film that deserves someone who's paying attention to the details.

*EDITED* I contacted Funimation about the issue and was told that the subtitles were hardwired to the Japanese soundtrack. I had tried switching to the Japanese soundtrack without luck before, but I went ahead and tried again by putting the Japanese audiotrack on before starting the film. It worked this time, leading me to think that either you have to do so, or you have to wait a long time for them to kick in in other circumstances. Regardless, this does help correct the problem I complained about, even if it's not very user friendly and it eliminates the option of closed captioning. So I have adjusted my score. The collectors edition is still not worth it for anyone but the most strident diehards, but it does bump up the score by a star.",1466294400,7,1658,4.694158075601375

2993799,5,B000X0G92U,"One of my all time favorite anime movies, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a movie with amazing animation and characters. Nothing about this movie is predictable, it will take you in directions you never expected it to. A taste of both high school drama and existentialism.

Thinking back to my high school days I can definitely see parts of myself within Makoto (the heroine). She's naive, stubborn, and afraid of growing up. She's at a point in her life where she wants her small world and the people who live in it to remain unchanged (a sentiment and fear I'm sure we can all relate to at one point in time during adolescence).

As a teenager I can't tell you how many times I wished I could just go back ""redo"" a really bad day and fix all of the things that went wrong. Well, Makoto, an average teenage girl, suddenly finds herself with the ability to do just that. The way she uses her newfound powers as a teenager is completely relatable, to the point of hilarity. I don't want to spoil anything, but there is something much more dire about her powers than she realizes and she learns time traveling isn't all fun and games.

I will be honest, the first time I saw this I became overwhelmed with frustration toward Makoto at times and her actions toward a particular character caused my heart to physically ache. I just wanted to grab her by the shoulders and shake her and yell at her for being so cowardly, but I realized I was just projecting the anger I felt toward myself for doing similar things as a teenager and with that realization I felt I could truly see part of myself in Makoto and she became dear to me.

I think the overall message to take away from this movie is simply ""time waits for no one"". Quit living in fear of change or losing control and live your life to the fullest and with passion every day!

Finally!! A North American Blu-ray rerelease of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time!! The company who originally held the liscensing rights went out of business very soon after the Blu-Ray and DVD were released, causing only a small amount of Blu-Rays and DVDs to be produced.

She's about to be killed in an accident. Until suddenly, she finds herself lying on the ground a few minutes before the incident. She later understands that she can perform time leaps. She then carries on with her life, by taking advantage of the new ability that she somehow obtained. All the while, completely oblivious to any possibility of the consequences.-summary

When I fist saw this flick years ago I didn't expect it to be so good, especially when considering it was directed by Mamoru Hosoda, director of numerous Digimon titles; but I was very impressed by this movie. So impressed, that I watched it twice back to back, and it can easily make my top ten list of best anime films.

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a very well crafted film, and it does a lot of things right. The film does a very good job developing the characters personalities, but the main character Makoto possesses the most depth as it should be. The other characters are very likable as well as believable. They have some very fun and realistic personalities. I think there's someone everyone can relate to(that is, if you don't crave completely angst-ridden characters). The character development did surprise me somewhat due to the length of the film. Many anime films forsake character development, and merely utilize their characters only as plot devices, thus making it hard for the viewer to establish some type of connection. Thankfully, this isn't the case here.

Makoto is definitely the heart of the film, in which she drives home the films ""coming of age"" theme. Watching her grow by making and attempting to correct her mistakes is something viewers can take away, and possibly grow on for themselves.

The premise of the film being able to travel back in time appears to be a pretty realistic and heavy theme to me. I'm sure almost everyone in existence would love the ability to go back and fix some past dilemma. I believe this was a plot device that was used to some good effect.

The film is very fun, light hearted, and packed with a good dose of comedy that actually works. The comedy is more present during the first half. However, later on it takes a very dramatic turn with a thought provoking, yet realistic twist that definitely adds a bit more depth to a story which used such a serious gimmick to begin with. The film teaches one the possible hazards of being able to change past events, while also showing the possible benefits as well. Makoto's intentions on time leaping were innocent in every way, but her unawareness on the trade off proved to have consequences.

The animation is very good as well. It's very fluid throughout with great character body, hair, and facial movements. CG was definitely used and wasn't really a problem, but I've seen it blended in with 2D a lot better. The artwork is fantastic at times but not consistent. Overall, the character designs, and the scenery especially gives off a very neat and clean appearance. The backgrounds are simply beautiful.

I also have to give credit to the very wise use of the budget. The production values were pretty high, and this film could have very easily gotten worst visually over time, but they cleverly reused scenes during time leaps to prolong their budget. Therefore, the animation stayed at its best throughout even though there were a small amount of stills used. However, to a small degree which happens to play into my lows. The reused scenes are actually a negative for me just a little. The time jumps added to the comedy, but sometimes those exact scenes would replay in an almost endless loop, and the comedy would wear itself out. That's like someone telling you a funny joke 6 times in a row. It's just not going to be as funny anymore.

The soundtrack by Kiyoshi Yoshida was also very good. It consisted of piano pieces that would begin slow, and eventually speed up to match events during scenes. This provided a nice tune, which seemed to fit very well with the personality of the film. The voice acting was very well done for both languages. Of course, this is another time the sub outshines the dub clearly; but I will always prefer the dub in almost every thing that I watch. My reason being is simple. When focusing on reading subs, it's more difficult for me to pay attention to the visuals.

Overall, this is an anime film that more people need to know about. It's definitely among my favorites and I think it can fit perfectly in any otaku's collection. I also believe there is a lot here for casual fans as well.

Cons: Some comedy a bit over played",1428105600,,4810,4.673758865248227

It's my understanding that the Blu-Ray came out as Bandai went bankrupt or sold out so it was in very short supply after the initial release.  But I look around the net and see the film is still available pretty much everywhere except the US.  It's in Australia, but with a B region code.  It's available in Mexico with the A region code but no English language track.

Now that I got my collector's vitriol out, let me say what the movie IS.

It is a beautifully directed slice of life high school romance story with a neat scifi twist. The closest mind bending sweet story I can think of that comes close to this film is Groundhogs Day, but rather that the time loop being subject to a reseting clock, it is subject to the whims of a normal sweet high school girl and all of her neuroses. It does get dark at some moments, but what time travel story does not show a worst case scenario for time traveling highjacks?

2993949,3,B000X0G92U,"--Update--
I have come to the understanding that the movie is based on short stories from a Japanese youth magazine, which may explain the abrupt plot shift. People who may be well versed in Japanese culture, and knew about the original story (as it is fairly popular, like Dune or Lord of the Rings), probably expected this plot shift, but for us casual anime viewers, it probably came as a total shock.

I will leave my review as it is, and I have yet to make an edited version of the movie (for personal use), but I may get to it someday.

--Original Review--
I was recommended this movie, after having seen all of Miyazaki's films (I have also seen other anime movies and series). After watching it, I understand why there is all these five star reviews here on Amazon. The story is engrossing and will have you at the edge of your seat. It is a great mix of comedy, mystery, action, and even teenage romance. You can relate to Makoto, the main character, and there is a natural flow of her learning how to use her new found power of traveling back through time. Let's just say that time travel is done with a great deal of comedy in the beginning, and seriousness in the end.

So why three stars instead of five or four? First, I want it to be known that I really wanted to love this film. However, this movie has one glaring problem, one that I hope is a cultural difference more than anything else. The problem with this movie is the ending. The ending is such a huge plot shift that it made me (literally) scream at the television. Let's just say that one of the minor characters reveals a secret that is completely out of the blue, and does not fit that character's personality or motives.

The best I can describe it is like watching Mary Poppins and finding out that Bert is actually a magic stealing robot, or it is like watching Batman and finding out that Alfred is an alien in disguise trying to learn human culture.

The minor character and how that character acts throughout the whole movie does not make any sense with the secret reveal of who that character really is. Maybe it is a cultural thing, or maybe it is just bad writing, but it is such a jarring plot shift (in the last few minutes of the movie no less) that it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I even joked (although I might have been serious at the time) to edit that part of the movie out of the movie. It is so late coming that you could literally cut a few scenes, splice a few others, and the movie would end just fine.

I know many will disagree, or they may agree, but love the move so much to overlook the plot shift. All I can write, is that you need to watch this movie. The ending may make this movie only a rental, but the movie (up until the last few minutes) is just pure awesome.",1375747200,14,2780,4.255681818181818

The entire story was fantastic form beginning to end. It even had me in tears.

The Limited Edition is worth it since it comes with a little more.

2993951,5,B000X0G92U,"Every bone in my body is telling me ""Jonathan, this is a romance, it's a time traveling romance filled with plot holes, love triangles, and more teenee gooy romance then you can handle."" Yes, it's true; I've made somewhat of a reputation for myself amongst my family and friends for my hatred of these kinds of movies. You know, close nit group of friends (two guys, one girl), boy likes girl but doesn't have the guts to tell her for fear of ruining their friendship, girl likes guy but doesn't want to admit it, other guy likes girl but doesn't want relationship getting in the way of school, girl develops time traveling super powers, drama ensues. You know, your basic stuff.  If this were ANY other movie, made by any other director, done any differently than it was, I'd probably have a field day ripping this film a new one. And why not? Didn't I rip Myazaki's ""Whisper of the Heart"" for the same elements this movie has? Yes, I seem to remember doing that, and having good reasons for it too. It wasn't a fluke, I'm not in the habit of giving out bad reviews for Studio Ghibli's amazing (and I do mean amazing) work, much less a film Myazaki himself, the MASTER of anime, produced. But I did, and I stand by that decision.

But how then can I sit here with a straight face and tell you that The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a magnificent film. Not just a good film, but one of my favorite anime movies of all time that managed to bring a smile to the face of even a sarcastic cynic like me. Even with all its mellow drama, its plot holes, the love triangles and teeny weeny `cry me a river' romance I couldn't help but find myself completely enthralled by the story and characters.  I just can't explain it, maybe I've changed, maybe this night I was just in the mood, as it were, for a heartwarming little story about a teenage girl and her love for the cute funny best friend. I pride myself for my consistency, in my taste in music, movies, my political beliefs, etc, I'm nothing if not consistent. Logic, therefore, would tell me to hate this film, but I don't. In fact, I love it, so for the sake of the reading public (you guys) I will try to explain, to myself as well as to you, just why it is I loved this movie.

Makoto, Chiaki, and Kosuke are the best of friends. Just like any classic friend trio their personalities vary a lot, Makoto (the lead female) being mostly carefree and fun loving, Kosuke being the brains of the outfit, while Chiaki is laid back, lazy, but fun to be around. Together they make an inseparable team, playing a little catch, singing a little karioke, or just riding bikes their bikes. Like any good anime this films main strength lies with its characters. Rarely does an anime film capture so perfectly the character and personality of its characters, and even rarer are examples of anime that do this for teenage characters. At no point in time did I feel like I was watching a movie about fictional characters in a fictional world with fictional problems, instead I felt like I was simply watching three normal everyday people as they interact with each other and the world around them. I cannot overstate how amazing these characters are. So that helps explain why I love this film, as characters are the foundation upon which any story is built. That's not what surprises me here.

No, the surprising part is that the  love triangles and twist ending didn't completely turn me off to this film. After all, those are just the kind of things that usually activate the `let's trash a movie' part of my brain. It's my natural response. My BS flag goes up faster than it takes for an Elfen Lied character to take their clothes off. My fingers find their way to the C-R-A-P buttons on my keyboard, and I go on a funny rant that gets on the nerves of every fanboy on the internet. Overall a lot of fun, you all should try it sometime. Let this movie serve as an example to the Twilight fans of the world, to the writers who make their living writing crappy teen romances to sappy/shallow readers. Let this also serve as an example to all the snobby critics (myself included) who would normally never give a story like this a chance. The lesson being that ANY story can be done well provided the characters are strong enough to drive it. At its core this film is a teen age love story, and in the hands of an unskilled writer (Stephanie Meyers is but one example) this story would be complete and utter nonsense void of all artistic or entertainment value. But in the hands of a skilled writer, a visionary director, and talented actors, art is made. And that is what this movie is. Art.

I watched this movie years ago and never quite got around to finishing the review for it, but at the time I gave it a 4/5. Upon seeing it again I've realized that rating wasn't enough, so I'll bump this up to a 5/5. Yes, I am that impressed by it. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is an amazing anime film reminiscent of the movies of the legendary Studio Ghibli. The art, the music, the cinematography, he visuals, all add to the story to create something of a modest masterpiece. Does it have its flaws? Yes, most notably the blatant plot holes that litter it especially near the end of the film, but compared to the overall quality of the movie such transgressions can easily be forgiven and forgotten.

I love this movie. I hope you love it too.

Most stories in any form, you watch/see/read once and that's enough. This one is a classic storyline that's been done many times in various forms in Japan and that region of Asia, but this is the best perhaps because it is so simple in execution.

One aspect I found interesting, if you have some idea of what's coming in the next few years (supernova/binary star passing/comet cluster/ realm border to 4d and all the earth changes in the EM field leading to the next ice age as the volcanoes, EQs etc go off), is that the male time traveler mentions near the end about how crowded it is at that intersection etc. Imagine the situation after the Day After Tomorrow if you went back in time and found a crowded world where in your own timeline, there simply weren't many that survived.

2994020,4,B000X0G92U,"Take the basic concept of the movie ""The Butterfly Effect,"" tone it way, way, down, and make the hero a 17 year old female high school student and you have ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,""  a charming coming-of-age movie.  The heroine is given the ability to travel back in time.  At first she uses her powers frivilously but, under the guidance of an aunt who once had the ability herself, she learns to use it more responsibly.  While this is going on, she has to make up her mind if she wants to become romantically involved with one or the other of her male high school buddies she plays baseball with.  One of them has a secret...

The target audience is teenage girls (it's a ""shojo"" movie), so I didn't enjoy it as much as others might.  You might call it a romantic comedy, but there isn't that much romance, and it doesn't really have a lot of jokes.  It will make you smile rather than laugh.  Once, when the heroine is crying, they make her face ""cartoony,"" and it makes what should be a serious scene silly-looking.  The story is mostly mundane (no explosions, mecha, or tentacles), so the animation is simply adequate and not very impressive, apart from a few ""special effects"" during the time travelling.  In spite of these drawbacks, I would say that it's worth seeing at least once.  The English dub is well done.  Rated 13-plus, mostly for minor naughty language and innuendo.

2994021,5,B000X0G92U,"At a glance:
""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is a film that explores that desire we all have to go back and change how certain events worked out in our lives.  The main character find herself to have this ability, but how did she get it, and what if any complications are brought about by changing things?  The film is another exceptional work by director Mamoru Hosoda, who has been pegged by many to be the director to succeed the great Hayao Miyazaki in directing.  Incredible acting, complimented with great story telling, with vibrant backgrounds and animation make this film a classic that all ages can enjoy.

Some details (and spoilers):
This film in particular brought about my interest in director Mamoru Hosoda, as he delivered an exceptional film that is easy to recommend to others.  Often times with anime films you really need to consider the content, the genre, and the associated appeal, whereas I don't even consider these when suggesting this film to others.  It has an appeal that exists at different levels, both to younger audiences, as well as older audiences, all the while maintaining a sense of good pacing and timing that keep you genuinely interested in the characters.  The idea of going back in time has unfortunately obtained something of a stigma, but this film goes above that by not using time machines, and not altering world history.  The main character wishes to change the events in her life not out of her desire for greed or power, but for some very relatable reasons that help you to feel empathy toward her and what she is going through.  Ultimately the film begins to address some of the consequences that her actions have had, and you're left feeling as though you gained something from the experience  I found myself enjoying all elements of the film and I didn't have trouble ""getting into it"" or being distracted at points that weren't done correctly.  This film had a lot of love go into it, and I believe that's why many have taken so well to it in return.

Pros:
* The high definition version is crisp, clear, and really shows off the beautiful palette used for this film.
* Voice acting on the dub and sub were both incredibly well done, the emotion of the characters came through, and didn't feel forced.
* Bonus features are included with this release on the DVD that comes with it (this does not include the DVD version of the film)
* Great story, good pacing, and effective directing establish this film.

Cons:
* The release is not a DVD/Blu-Ray Combo
* The features included are on a DVD rather than a Blu-Ray
* While not incredibly expensive, the Blu-Ray is still a little more expensive than maybe it should be for a movie.",1334188800,,2684,4.649048625792812

It's a big encouragement to widen our anime horizons. Not only is it a memorable love story between two remarkable youngsters, it is a morality tale about adult responsibility and how a teenaged girl is compelled to grow into it--nearly at the cost of the lives of innocent people. What she is doing--jumping back in time to make trivial changes in her life--proves to be fantastically dangerous. The time travel schtik is merely the fuel source that enables the engine of the story to tick along. This is all about making bad decisions and good decisions--the stuff of adult life. Also, the lankier, sparer look of the anime style (vs. Miyazaki) is enchanting in its own way. A little more minimalist, but that's fine. Just a terrific film and highly recommended.",1331337600,,942,4.785276073619632

2994027,5,B000X0G92U,"I will say up front that the music, story, voice work in Japanese (I didn't watch English version), plot twists...it's just really lovely. The only weakness is some of the roughness in animating the human movement...but it's a minor quibble. This is a lovely, lovely film.

I won't say it has a happy-happy ending. I will say it has a beautiful ending, and everything that leads up to it is rather thrilling. It has some humor, some suspense, some sadness, some romance, and a lot that makes you wish you were young and had these great friends again, like we did in those days when we didn't have to worry about adult concerns, we were all about school-buddies-budding loves-etc.

I also love the idea of what ends up mattering the most--what would YOU travel back in tme for?--and how sometimes we do get a chance to fix things, or we mess it up more; but nothing can be perfect, even when we wish it so. We just do our best and hope for better.

I don't want to give too many specifics and mess up this film experience for you. Try to avoid spoilers. Trust me: This is best seen without knowing much of the plot other than, ""Girl (Makoto) who has two guy best-buddies with whom she shares most of her time finds her and their lives changing--and those in her wider circle-- when she acquires the ability to time leap.""

I'm not going to give any spoilers, but I'm going to say how much I love all the exciting twists and turns this movie throws at you.

The main character, Makoto, is your average, ordinary teenage girl. From what the movie suggests, she lives in Tokyo, Japan, where she tries hard at her school. When she seems to be slightly down on her luck, Makoto accidentally trips and hits her elbow on a time-travel device. From then on, much of the story shows her abusing the powers of time-travel. It all leads up to a suspensful climax.

2994033,5,B000X0G92U,"I watch a lot of different types of movies, and usually watch movies that either have more explosions or challenge the mind.

On a whim, I decided to check out The Girl Who Leapt Through Time when I was at Anime Detour in Minneapolis a couple years back, and boy was it a great decision!

This is simply an amazing movie.  The animation is superb, the voice acting is excellent, and the audio is astounding.  The Girl Who Leapt Through Time focuses on the very minute visual and audio details, ranging from small, barely visible objects to birds singing off in the distance.  Most movies don't put this much detail in, so it's very refreshing to see people think about the small things, especially when getting down to it, this movie is about the small things.

I'm not going to delve into the details about the story, but the actors were amazing, and really threw their emotions into their characters.  It's all the little things, the interactions between the characters and between the characters and the world that pull you into the story and makes it all believable.

I usually don't care for movies or TV shows when they force the characters to act like someone in this age group, when most people don't act like how they are portrayed in the media, but this movie is much more believable.  Going back in time to re-eat some pudding?  Now that's something a teenager would do!

I wanted to buy this on DVD, but when I heard it was coming out on Blu-ray, I knew I had to buy it ASAP!  The BD version does wonders for the minute audio details and the beautifully drawn/painted landscapes in the movie.  I just wonder how great the quality of the original 3000 pixel film reel version was.

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is my favorite animated movie!",1318896000,,1755,4.53015873015873
2994034,4,B000X0G92U,"When I was done watching this, I realized how much it reminded me of ""Run Lola Run"" - but the novel ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is based on came out decades earlier. So I guess Lola was influenced by Yasutaka Tsutsui's 1967 novel, ""Toki o Kakeru Sh'jo"" - the basis for this movie.  The comparisons are natural - Lola runs and runs to effect time. Makoto runs and jumps.

Makoto's adventures start by accident, and she's later convinced by her Aunt that it's a natural skill for teenage girls. She keeps jumping back in time to fix minor problems, but her ""corrections"" build up and she has to correct more and more serious complications.  It's an interesting romp in the life of a Japanese teenager in high school (again with the high school? Is every Anime set in a Japanese high school?) that features some amazing animation.

You don't have to - or want to - think too hard. The sub-plot with the missing piece of art is a stretch, and the last lines of the movie make for a feel-good ending, but make no sense. The art would be a total paradox that would have made the events in the movie impossible, and since Chiaki is from the far future, the last few lines in the movie are also impossible.

But it's not supposed to be a thinking movie - it's supposed to be entertainment, and that it is. Solid, fun and enjoyable.",1313884800,,1329,4.3861788617886175

It's a story of a High school girl procrastinating her final year and failing to commitment, only to later fall in love as well. The plot is deep enough to make you think about it later, but easy enough for others to understand so you can hold a conversation about the movie with non anime lovers. With the ending, it's realistic and not fairytale; which in some case can be a great finish but at the end there was a gaping hole left in my heart where I wanted the two to be happy together.

2994070,5,B000X0G92U,"Putting in my two cents:

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time has been on my to-watch list for awhile, but I never took the time to check it out until yesterday.  I (like most of the other reviewers) wasn't expecting too much, but after viewing their newer film ""Summer Wars"" I decided to give it a go.  I have to say that despite being a slightly older film, this exceeds Summer Wars in almost every aspect (except maybe computer animation).

There are literally no weaknesses in this film.  The animation quality remains high throughout.  The characters are beautifully hand drawn and the backgrounds painstakingly rendered (mostly hand drawn as well).  The use of computer animation is kept to a minimum and mainly occurs when we view a 'leap'.

The characters are strong and likable.  Makoto is your typical clumsy teenager.  A chance encounter followed by a (nearly) horrific accident enable her to 'leap' through time.  Rather than use this ability for so called 'evil' (I would be leaping back and investing heavily in certain stocks...), Makoto uses the ability to make her life and the lives of her friends better.  However, this begins to cause unforeseen and dire circumstances.

And this is about the point where the  movie shifts from lighthearted and somewhat comedic to fully dramatic and saddening.  I won't divulge any events or spoil any plots for you, but let's say that I was moved by the end of the film (though not quite teary eyed!).

The Japanese voice acting is strong, especially considering at least 2/3 main characters are voiced by a first time voice actor.  It goes to show you how in Japan, they take the voice acting seriously and cast well (rather than the majority of American dubbing firms which have a core of 5 or 6 full time actors that they HAVE to match to a main character in each series or film - often not getting the best match to the character).

So the story is strong with a little sci-fi edge, the characters are likable and well portrayed, the voice acting is wonderful, the animation is gorgeous... why haven't you seen this yet?  If you are not a fan of anime, this might be a good film to help change your mind.",1306022400,5,2159,4.63421052631579

Well-told with structural complexity, ""Girl"" often suggests implicit meaning well-beyond its family-friendly exterior, begging for open discussion and considered review.

As a film, it's highly entertaining, well-paced, well-drawn with appropriate ambience and a tale that is simple to understand, yet poses difficult choices for our heroine with varied results.  A ""Girl"" with a clear agenda, beset with problems of her own making, finding solutions that might not really be solutions, after all.

2994076,5,B000X0G92U,"I am an avid Anime fan.  I actually learned Japanese in college for 3 years for the sole purpose of watching Anime and reading Japanese Comics (aka Manga).

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (aka ""Tokikake"" for Japanese fans), leapt through the Japanese animation industry, catapulting Director Mamoru Hosoda into what I consider the ""next"" Miyazaki. This film won the 2007 Animation of the Year in the Japanese Academy Awards and his next work&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summer-Wars-Blu-ray/dp/B004DMIIOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summer Wars [Blu-ray</a>] won it in 2010.  It has now even been made into a Live Action movie with the same Japanese Title ""Toki wo Kakeru Shojo"" aka ""Time Traveler.""

Based on a novel, Tokikake the movie is actually a Sequel of the original novel (the protagonist of the original novel happens to be the Aunt of the main character in this movie--which makes us feel bitter sweet when the Aunt mentions what she mentions.)  And I won't give you a synopsis (the description and other reviewers can do that), but if you enjoy old Ghibli classics, you will also enjoy this movie.  The interesting thing about Director Hosoda is that he is able to mix Sci-Fi elements flawlessly into a normal modern day culture--well, Japanese culture--which draws you right into the characters and story.

Like his newest movie Summer Wars, this movie also mixes multiple categories of comedy, romance, slice of life, sci-fi and drama.  He'll give you a couple of twists in the story that will make you ""oooh!"" and ""Ahhh!"" in between the laughs and tension.

This is not only a family friendly movie (although I have yet to watch the English Language version, so not sure how they translated it, as sometimes they'll add expletives when there is none in the Japanese version, so will update this once it is released and I watch it) but it will be an excellent introduction to someone who enjoy's a well scripted movie.  This is not an ""action-packed"" sci-fi thriller, so don't expect skin and violence and fighting without a plotline.  Just get this when it comes out and you won't regret it.

And turns out to be a little full of herself but then you find her soft side.  Her friends are good charecters as well not imperitive at the start but near the end... I won't ruin it.

Not for the action fan but great for an anime fan.  Think a Spririted Away without the monsters and spirits.  The down to earth with the small amount of supernatrual element makes a beautiful movie.

2994088,5,B000X0G92U,"I will admit to knowing absolutely nothing about Manga and I thought this film was going to be an easy going cartoon. On watching I started to think 'this is going to be awful' when the heroine Makoto did her first face gurning over exaggeration. It reminded me of some really terrible cartoons my daughter used to watch. Luckily the gurning only reappeared occasionally in this story.

The voices and soundtrack are really good. You forget it wasn't originally English. The haunting piano music also stood out. Some of the settings and skyscapes are stunning and the leaping through time images were original and great to watch. The 'drawn' characters stopped me from ever believing this was a real story but I still enjoyed it.

This film is great fun. The leaping through time always ends with a comic thump back to earth or 'is anyone dead yet?'. You don't know what is going to happen next. The story also develops well and takes an unexpected turn into a sci fi love story. I think because of the themes the 12+ rating is about right.

I would describe this film as a cross between 'Groundhog Day' and 'Back to the Future' both very likeable, easily accessible films and this film is too. The story revolves around a highschool, a baseball field, an art gallery, Makoto's home and the road to school. It is quite a limited claustrophic setting but it works well and builds up the story tension as different things happen on ordinary days with Makoto's intervention. Some of it is life and death and some of it high school angst and some is pure pudding humour.

I think teenage girls would especially like the teen romance storyline. I think this would definitely be a teen 'date movie'.

2994091,4,B000X0G92U,"'The Girl Who Leapt Through Time' is an animation that follows your basic 'butterfly affect' storyline, but played out by Japanese teenagers. Therefore the adolescent changes made are seemingly no big deal, like helping the main character getting up late, enjoy marathon karaoke sessions and eat lost puddings and yet over time these small changes create a bigger impact. The film then follows her as she tried to resolve these issues and get her life back on track. The animation is very beautiful, without being too slick or digitalised (such as in Steamboy) and reminds me of Studio Ghibli's output, which has amazing animation but without the explosions and excessive animation tricks of other manga i've watched. This is all about the story and the animation. This film is relatively short at just over 90 minutes and it managed to keep me interested for the duration.

This comedy emotionally links the viewer strongly with the protagonist and, when the conflict occurs, it creates extremely powerful suspense and tension that is more involving than that which occurs in many suspense films.

As a result of seeing this movie, I'll definitely be more openminded about the possibility of seeing other anime movies in the future.

I did see one strange scene in the movie. There's a scene where Aunt Witch is talking, and then the camera focuses on a picture in the background behind Aunt Witch showing Aunt Witch as a young girl surrounded on either side by apparently her parents. Because of how long the camera focused on this picture, I thought the picture might mean something in the overall context of the movie, but nothing ever happened elsewhere in the movie that related back to the information in this picture. The whole movie was terrific, but I'm still bothered by the missing point of this seemingly wasted scene. Aunt Witch says she has time travelled too in addition to Makoto, but this is never really explained further anywhere. Why does her story appear to somewhat parallel the story of Makoto?

Star Trek is notable--or infamous--for its time travel plots, some of which are utterly laughable.  The concept is fun, but often breaks down via logic, leading to time travel ""rules"" such as not changing the past or screwing things up so much that you're never born.

But...what if you could go back in time and deliberately relive the same day, or the same moments, over and over?  What would you do?  What would you change?  Would you attempt to make the world a better place?  Would you go backwards for purely selfish reasons?

Consider, then, The Girl Who Leapt through Time (Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo), a movie that explores both concepts.

The plot revolves around Makoto, a student who discovers how to leap through time. Her antics are incredibly hilarious and realistic. Whether it is something a mundane as retaking a failed test or wanting to redo a night of karaoke over and over again, I was fascinated with the idea of traveling in time just to have those small moments back. The main characters are extremely likable and easy to relate to. They also add an extra amount of realism to the movie. They act, talk, react, etc. just as normal teens. You just cannot help but to like them. The plot takes a swift dramatic turn in the second half, when the main conflict finally reveals itself. To be honest, I found much of this part to be mind-blowing and completely unexpected-- in an amazing, I love this movie that much more kinda way.

2994142,5,B000X0G92U,"i saw this film recommened on a forum i occationally visit, and while i don't usually run off to watch everything recommended to me, the title sounded interesting so i decided to give it a go. and i'm glad i did. the story starts of rather slowly and sets itself up like a lot of other high school romance/ slice of life animes, it slowly progressed into a sort of sci-fi romance which was really touching.

the story follows a girl names makoto who likes spending time with her two best friends, kosuke, a serious, reserved sort or guy, and chiaki, a fun-loving joker. though the three of them have not always been best friends, we can see that they are very close and enjoy spending a lot of time together. the point at which the story takes a more sci-fi approach is on the day makoto is late for school. she is more often than not late, but on this specific day as she is hurdling down a hill, a train happens to be passing by at the bottom of said hill and she is going to fast to stop. she tries to slow down, but ends up hitting the barrier between the pedestrians and the train tracks and sends herself flying in the way of the train. just before she is squashed and our story is ended however, time stops and she finds herself transported back in time, and is safe from the squishing. she has some fun with this, though doesn't yet know the significance. around this time she discovers that one of her friends is developing feelings for her, and because she doesn't wish to change their relationship yet, uses the 'time machine' to avoid his asking her out. at the end she is forced to choose between love and friendship, but not in the way you'd think. the ending is something of a surprise (but you can kind of guess what'll happen if you pay attention to the clues), but the events that take place and the choices she makes leave you with a bittersweet feeling that makes the film worth the watch.

for those who have watched the ending, it would be an interesting argument to decide whether the love interest was truly in love or whether he just wanted to preserve a certain object... the aunt's story happens to suspiciously parallel makoto's, but it was an enjoyable movie in any case.",1255651200,,2200,4.389705882352941

2994176,5,B000X0G92U,"This is one of the best damn anime films ever made, if not the best.

I haven't heard about Yasutaka Tsutsui's original novel on which this movie is based on. ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is a prequel to the novel. But God, this is a masterpiece, with dazzling computer animation, backgrounds that even Makoto Shinkai couldn't handle and the most satisfying drama I've ever seen.

The anime involves Makoto Konno, a high school girl who is clumsier than ever. She hangs around, playing baseball with her buddies, studious Kosuke Tsuda and shaggy Chiaki Mamiya. One day, sneaking around a chemistry lab, she falls onto a seed. Little does she know that this seed has special abilities.

On her bicycle ride down a hill, a train is about to cross, and Makoto's wheels lock. Just when she gets hit, she ends up back on the top of the hill, before the train ever crossed. And she's still alive. When Makoto arrives to talk to her aunt about her mind-tripping experience, her aunt gives the suggestion that she went through a time delay. Her aunt says that some girls her age have the ability to jump to a different time when they least expect it. Is this just a coincidence?

No, it's not coincidence. In fact, in the middle of her time travels, this story turns into a heavily emotional romance. As much as Makoto wants to deny her feelings at first, she cannot help but admire the boy who also keeps her safe from danger. This is one of those films in which people cannot help but cry.

By the time viewers understand how Makoto's time traveling works, we can't help but wish that Chiaki would stick around a little longer, to help Makoto out. After all, they are extremely lovable as a couple, and they care for each other so deeply.

But even when we just think that Makoto will end up all alone, the director manages to slip in a great ending. This is one of those films that will cheer anyone up. The characters have such strong emotional bonds. And the use of time travel is mind tripping. Computer-generated images of LCD timers litter the time dimension through which Makoto heads into the past. The backgrounds are gorgeous.

Really, there's almost no better romantic anime film than ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time."" In fact, anyone can truly say that this is the best anime romance ever made. And Madhouse Studio does a magnificent job--probably the best in their company history.

This is a must-have film. Get it while Bandai Visual is still selling it. After all, with this recession, there's no telling when Bandai will go bankrupt.",1236816000,4,2550,4.626106194690266

Then, one day, she hears a noise in the school science lab. When she goes to investigate -- well, something happens, or seems to. After school, on her way home, her bike's breaks fail on a steep hill. She careens in front of a rushing train, with no way to avoid being hit. Then, quite suddenly, she appears back in the school again, a few hours before her date with death.

Somehow, she has developed the ability to go backwards in time, but with memory of that possible future. Then, over the next few days, she learns to leap at will. Life in early teen years gives plenty for her to want to do over, including romantic embarrassments involving her friends or herself. This ability has its limits, though, including a countdown that mysteriously appears on her arm. Then she discovers that she unwittingly took this ability away from someone else.

You won't find mega-mechs or flying swordsmen in this peaceful but engaging movie. You will find a few other manga stereotypes, including impossibly thin and leggy figures and shortie schoolgirl uniforms. Accept the conventions and look elsewhere for bam-pow excitement. This kid-safe movie offers some chaste teen romance and mystery, and some undefinable bit more. Give it a shot.

Makoto Konno is a slightly clumsy tomboy on the verge of the age right when teens start looking at the opposite sex differently whose priority is hanging out with her two best buddies - cheeky but endearing Chiaki Mamiya and evenheaded, gentlemanly Kosuke Tsuda.  One day, her bicycle brakes won't work, and she finds herself about to be killed by crashing into a train passing her lane.  Fortunately, a miracle occurs - and she finds herself having time-jumped backwards safe and sound.

After talking to her aunt, who had a similar experience, she experiments and finds that she can do it again, begining with small things like preventing the poaching of a snack by her sister.  But when things start progressing to slightly more serious matters and she takes a series of jumps in a panic when she realizes that one of her best guys is about to say something to her privately that will take them to a place from which they can't come back that she isn't sure she's ready to go, things take a dark turn and spiral out of control - and she finds that this time, she might not be able to fix what she's done...

Part sci-fi with a neat twist that anyone who isn't familiar with the source material probably won't see coming and part teen drama with an achingly accurate depiction of that critical time in life and personal development, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a warm, poignant work that should be in the collection of any anime fan.",1227398400,77,1664,4.5083056478405314

2994195,5,B000X0G92U,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie due to its weird title and what I felt was an awkward animation style. Plus I was an avid Hayao Miyazaki fan, and I did not believe any anime movie could overcome the feel-goodness of his movies in general. I was very wrong.

""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" (or ""Toki wa Kakeru Shoujo"") is about a girl named Makoto Konno who, after a strange encounter in a lab after school discovers she has the power to ""jump"" through time. Literally.

Although it started off slow, the pace made the hackneyed concept of time jumping much more original. Not to mention the main characters were all extremely likable and realistic. I couldn't help but root for Makoto in whatever crazy things she wound up doing in the past. The things she went back to change were trivial things, like a test she failed, or when her friend Chiaki confessed to her. They are all things that ordinary, idiotic people like ourselves would do if we had that power. This story is only something the Japanese could come up with, and I commemorate director Mamoru Hosoda for blending mundane Japanese life with such a fantastical concept like time travel. It's warm, funny, and touching. That is, for the first half.

The second half of the film takes a hugely dramatic turn. It's almost mind-blowing in the way things played out. For spoiler fans, it has something to do with Chiaki (You know, the friend who confessed to her?). Anyways, I loved this shift in the plot, even though it lost some of its precious feel-good elements along the way. Makoto still managed to keep some humor in her crazy ventures, and her personality is not lost in the plot twist. Chiaki's transformation though, I'm still a bit iffy about.

I think this movie is way up there with Miyazaki's films. The perfect blend of fantasy and feel-goodness, along with some dry humor as well makes for an excellent film. I also felt myself warming up to the animation style as well, which was very contemporary, so I wasn't used to it, but I'm now completely in love with it.

3227916,5,B000X0G92U,"The story about a girl who conquered time was first made popular by the much-revered novel by now legendary author Yasutaka Tsutsui. Since then, it has seen many other variations and adaptations including one television series and a couple feature-length live action films. Now this story has finally found its way to the world of animation. And the results are fantastic.

One school day, an ordinary girl unknowingly gains the ability to ""leap through time"", enabling her to travel to different stages from her memory. After learning how to control this power she has discovered, she begins to realize the responsibilities and consequences that result from using it and how it begins to affect her and those around her. It really is a unique blend of melodrama, romance, comedy, and science fiction, but you will hardly notice any genre while you are watching. The voice-acting and sound are quality, and the character designs by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (Wings of Honneamise, Evangelion) are superb. The movie's artistry is remarkably subtle for an animated feature even without much impeccable detail, making the whole visual presentation very fitting for a story of its kind.

Believe me when I say you don't have to be familiar with the story in order to enjoy it, and for those who have already seen previous incarnations of Tsutsui's novel this will be yet another take on a classic that will be very much to your liking. Overall, this was terrific and I recommend it to anyone who wants to treat themselves to a good movie that will keep you interested from beginning to end.

The animation was incredibly beautiful, and it had a lot of solid moments as far as movies go. I actually had to rewind and watch certain parts because of how amazing the animation, pace and lines were delivered. It just left a visceral feeling in my gut about what it means to grow up. The plucky leading lady is easy to like, as well as her gaggle of friends. You really get wrapped up in their stories. And even though I have a western perspective compared to the intended cultural audience, I think it plays well with everyone in that degree. The story line is easy follow, and it really draws you in on a personal level when the characters' are in peril. I think the ""How"" of the story line isn't as great as the overall telling of the story, but I still loved it because the characters were likable. The ending felt a tinge unsatisfying to me, but that's because it was left on an open note. Nonetheless, it's solid storytelling!",1505779200,,1024,4.423280423280423

3228101,5,B000X0G92U,"Just finished watching ""The Girl Who Leapt Through TIme"" released by Funimation.
Although I've had ""The Girl Who Leapt Through TIme"" sitting amongst the shelves of my DVD cases for several years now - actually the original unopened DVD release is sitting in a drawer in Jeff H.'s condo - I never got around to watching it until last night.  I had gotten the newly released blue-ray version because Jeff H. is still being an idiot about ""Fencegate"" and is afraid his parents will highly disapprove if we ""gasp"" watch a DVD at his place.  [For the record, Jeff H. does turn 35 years old  this month.]
I shouldn't have waited so long to watch this vibrantly and compelling anime which is based on the original manga - ""Toki wa Kakeru Shoujo.""
At first, it seems that ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is a typical manga about a young school girl - Makoto Konno - who is having an incredible bad day.  Makoto oversleeps and is almost late for school.  She flunks a surprise pop quiz in her math class.  Makoto almost burns down the school in her cooking class.  She's spooked by someone in her science lab while she's dropping off notebooks and falls hard on the ground.  And to top it off, while running an errand for her mother after school,  the brakes on her bicycle fail and she get's killed at a train crossing.  Or does she?
At the moment of her impending death, Makoto discovers that she has the ability to leap backwards in time and change the future..
Disbelieving at first, but gaining confidence through multiple time leaps, Makoto does what anyone would - she makes her life better.  But there are unintended consequences for her actions and she learns that her ability to jump through time can cause great harm to other people.
Makoto does have an Aunt Witch who is an art restorer at a museum who she confides in about her ability to time leap.  Aunt Witch warns her niece that she is playing with fire.  Yet, there is something about Aunt Witch that is compelling.  She confesses that she had the ability  to time leap to, but lost it.  There are some hints that Aunt Witch is actually an adult version of Makoto.
Makoto is a bit of a tomboy; and her two best friends - the cheeky but endearing Chiaki Mamiya and evenheaded, gentlemanly Kosuke Tsuda - are her best friends and she uses her time leaping abilities to change their lives as well and sometimes not for the better.
Yet when Makoto does finally learn the truth about how she gained the ability to leap through time, she must use her fading ability to save Kosuke, who is fated to die in the same accident that she almost did in.
""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is an enduring anime that lingers with you long after the final scene.

3228113,3,B000X0G92U,I love The Girl Who Leapt Through Time its a great classic anime with a lighthearted and touching story that has an amazing plot twist at the end that will make you say WOW! that was unexpected. Originally I purchased this series a few years ago on DVD after the original blu-ray release that was like $40-$50 a few years back sold out and my only option to purchase the show was the $20 DVD set that still wasn't sold out since the bluray had gone out of print. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the series was re-released on blu-ray and purchased it right away even though I already own in on DVD from a previous release so why do you ask did I give it 3/5 stars? well because the first time I ordered it the item didn't come with the cardboard slip cover and the box for the disc was cracked so I ordered a replacement and the replacement didn't come with the cardboard slip cover either even though there are pictures from other buyers showing that they got slip covers with the item. In the end I just gave up and kept it because I don't want to keep on an endless loop of returning stuff and getting the same results back but its disappointing that your not getting everything thats supposed to come with the item for fans of the show.,1480291200,5,1246,4.261603375527426

3228138,5,B000X0G92U,"I consider myself a casual anime fan -- I don't love it all, but there are series I enjoy, and I have a deep love for the films of Miyazaki and his company Studio Ghibli.  I had heard of ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" via an offhand mention by an Internet reviewer, who called it ""Groundhog Day if Bill Murray were a teenage girl.""  And while I wasn't expecting Miyazaki levels of mastery, I figured it was worth a watch.  The basic premise seemed cute and fun, even if it wasn't particularly groundbreaking.

If you go into this movie expecting a thrilling sci-fi action flick, you'll be disappointed.  But if you're in the mood for a sweet coming-of-age story that just happens to feature time travel, this film is excellent.

""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" follows Makoto, a high school student who's having the worst day of her life -- running late for school, flunking an important quiz, accidentally starting a fire during home economics... and being hit by a train on the way home from school.  And yet somehow, she managed to undo that last stroke of bad luck by jumping several seconds back in time.  Her aunt, an art restoration expert at a local museum, reveals to her that she has the ability to leap back in time, and Makoto is quick to find all sorts of fun, if mundane, uses for her ability.  She fixes her terrible day, aces her quiz, jumps back to experience her favorite dinner all over again, and stretches a karaoke session out to cover hours.  But soon she learns that not only is her time-leaping hurting others, but there's a limit to how many times she can leap... and her actions could hurt one of her friends, Chiaki, beyond repair.  With one leap remaining, can Makoto find a way to set things right?

The animation of this film isn't QUITE as good as the art of Studio Ghibli, and it does suffer from a few of the typical flaws one comes to expect in anime -- most notably same-face syndrome, vanishing noses, and mouths that slide to the side of the face.  But it's nonetheless gorgeous in its own right, with fluid animation, detailed and beautiful scenery shots, well-integrated CGI, and some imaginative (if a little trippy) visuals, especially during the leaps.  It's pleasant and even lovely to look at, without overtaking the story.

The characters in this series are well-done as well, feeling fleshed-out and believable.  Makoto is a character anyone can relate to, and though she tends to use her newfound ability for some stupid purposes, it's understandable -- who WOULDN'T use some fantastic ability for mundane purposes like sleeping in or fixing a simple mistake.  Her friends, Chiaki and Kousuke, are very different in personality (the laid-back and goofy Chiaki and the studious, serious Kousuke) but are likable characters, and even the stereotypical ""bratty little sister"" isn't just a one-note character but has a kind side as well.  And we get hints to Makoto's aunt, ""Auntie Witch,"" and that she might have experienced something similar to Makoto's newfound power when she was a girl...

The story focuses more on Makoto's progression as a character than on the specifics of her ability, and is more a unique coming-of-age story than a true sci-fi tale.  And I find that works.  The time-travel aspect is used as a tool rather than a silly gimmick, and it's through learning to use her power responsibly that Makoto matures and becomes a better person.  And while her story may ultimately be bittersweet, it's nonetheless heartwarming and satisfying to watch.

""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is an excellent film, less fantastic in nature than its name might suggest but still well worth watching.  It's a sweet tale with heartbreaking moments and a rewarding payoff, and well worth a look even if you're not an anime fan or prefer Studio Ghibli's output.

3228140,5,B000X0G92U,"Makota, the titular Girl Who Leapt Through Time, is a slightly eccentric Tokyo high school student who spends her days sleeping in and being late for class, playing baseball with her two male friends, Kousuke and Chiaki, and accidentally starting small fires in the chemistry lab.  One day at school she stumbles upon a discovery (not explained in full to either the viewer or Makota until late in the movie) that allows her to actually leap backwards in time.  She thinks this new ability is cool.  With little thought to the ramifications of her time jumps, she begins using her ability to jump back unlimited times in the morning to sleep as late as she wants without ever being late for class, correct embarassing or unwanted situations, and pondering her feelings for Kousuke and Chiaki; she's trying to decide if she likes one, both, or neither of them.  It's a charming and comedic anime that takes a turn into the metaphysical when it becomes apparant that Makota's time leaps aren't going unobserved, and when the movie begins tackling the question of where exactly this time travel comes from.  The movie has good animation, appealing characters, humor, mystery and emotion.

by how bad it was....

This is pretty clearly a problem with the time leaping, and nothing better illustrates my problem (and the director's problem) with time travel.  Great time travel stories, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steins-Gate/dp/B00KU3Y5CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steins Gate</a>, reveal themselves under pressure; bad ones, like the current movie, do the same.

High school student Makoto Konno climaxes a perfectly awful day by riding a malfunctioning bike to what should have been her death, but miraculously she manages to leap backwards in time and save her life.  What follows are a series of humorous incidents as Makoto basically misuses this mysterious power she has acquired until she suddenly realizes that lives are at stake as the power runs out.  So why only three stars?  Because of a sudden, blind, out of nowhere incident that literally makes no sense, especially when you remember what motivates a lot of her misdeeds.  This mishap is so unsettling, so astonishing that it utterly poisons the rest of the film, including the Sadder But Wiser Ending.

3228231,5,B000X0G92U,"Makoto (Emily Hirst) is an average teenager who enjoys spending her free time with her two best friends, Chiaki (Andrew Francis) and Kousuke (Alex Zahara). However, she has a particularly unlucky day that includes failing a math test and setting a fire in a home economics class. Things go from bad to worse for her when the brakes on her bicycle fail and ends up nearly losing her life colliding with a train. But she is saved when she suddenly discovers that she has the power to perform ""time leaps"" or the ability to essentially ""rewind"" time. Confused at first by this newfound power, she starts to use it to solve minor things in her own life including acing her math test and extending her leisure time. But it is not long before she realizes that this power can be used to manipulate the lives of those around her.

As a person whose knowledge of anime films is pretty much non-existent outside of the works of Studio Ghibli, this film caught my eye with an interesting sounding premise which reminded me of one of my favorite movies: 1993's Groundhog Day. I was not disappointed. To start off with, the characters in this film are simply great. There are no tired tropes in play here but the characters come off as realistic and likable. It is easy to like a character like Makoto as you watch her go through her life and attempt to use time leaps to improve it and sympathize with her when things do not always go according to plan. Likewise, the other characters come off as well written and enjoyable to watch. The writing in this film is quite excellent as it explores the possibilities and consequences of Makoto's time leaps. The film manages to use its premise to find humor that results in some very funny scenes. But at the same time, there are serious moments that come off as very touching. The animation itself, while not the best I have seen in the anime style, does work well. Characters are animated fluidly enough that do seem to be alive, but also cartoony at times to emphasize the emotions at hand.

If there is one criticism I have of this movie is that it comes off as somewhat unevenly paced. There are some spots where the movie just seems to slow down at awkward points and it becomes a little frustrating. However, this is only a minor point.

This set includes three discs. There is a standard DVD of the feature film, a DVD with some bonus features, and a Blu-ray with the feature film, which looks excellent, two audio commentaries, and storyboards.

This is a thoroughly enjoyable film that is sure to be enjoyed by fans of anime or just people that like a funny and touching animated film.",1468022400,,2628,4.537974683544304

3228261,3,B000X0G92U,"Funimation, you got me. Somehow, you managed to release a collector's edition with almost no collector value (just a small book that;s, well, OKAY), and a smushed plastic slipcover. That's bad enough, considering I got taken for a ride on the higher price. But then you put out an anime film without subtitles. (The listing says there are, but I can't find them in the menus and the subtitle button can't pull any up.) I guess I'm one of those annoying purists because with very rare exception, I prefer to watch with the original soundtrack. Which, ironically, is included. But what good is the original Japanese audio track if there aren't subtitles? I'm sure some anime fans speak fluent Japanese, but I'm not one of them. But doesn't it just seem like it shouldn't have even been a question to include them?

A disappointing release of a film that deserves someone who's paying attention to the details.

*EDITED* I contacted Funimation about the issue and was told that the subtitles were hardwired to the Japanese soundtrack. I had tried switching to the Japanese soundtrack without luck before, but I went ahead and tried again by putting the Japanese audiotrack on before starting the film. It worked this time, leading me to think that either you have to do so, or you have to wait a long time for them to kick in in other circumstances. Regardless, this does help correct the problem I complained about, even if it's not very user friendly and it eliminates the option of closed captioning. So I have adjusted my score. The collectors edition is still not worth it for anyone but the most strident diehards, but it does bump up the score by a star.",1466294400,7,1658,4.694158075601375

3228296,5,B000X0G92U,"One of my all time favorite anime movies, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a movie with amazing animation and characters. Nothing about this movie is predictable, it will take you in directions you never expected it to. A taste of both high school drama and existentialism.

Thinking back to my high school days I can definitely see parts of myself within Makoto (the heroine). She's naive, stubborn, and afraid of growing up. She's at a point in her life where she wants her small world and the people who live in it to remain unchanged (a sentiment and fear I'm sure we can all relate to at one point in time during adolescence).

As a teenager I can't tell you how many times I wished I could just go back ""redo"" a really bad day and fix all of the things that went wrong. Well, Makoto, an average teenage girl, suddenly finds herself with the ability to do just that. The way she uses her newfound powers as a teenager is completely relatable, to the point of hilarity. I don't want to spoil anything, but there is something much more dire about her powers than she realizes and she learns time traveling isn't all fun and games.

I will be honest, the first time I saw this I became overwhelmed with frustration toward Makoto at times and her actions toward a particular character caused my heart to physically ache. I just wanted to grab her by the shoulders and shake her and yell at her for being so cowardly, but I realized I was just projecting the anger I felt toward myself for doing similar things as a teenager and with that realization I felt I could truly see part of myself in Makoto and she became dear to me.

I think the overall message to take away from this movie is simply ""time waits for no one"". Quit living in fear of change or losing control and live your life to the fullest and with passion every day!

3228346,5,B000X0G92U,"Makoto Konno couldn't pick a better day to screw up. After waking up late for school, failing a pop quiz, and torching food in her cooking class, just to name a few. She's about to be killed in an accident. Until suddenly, she finds herself lying on the ground a few minutes before the incident. She later understands that she can perform time leaps. She then carries on with her life, by taking advantage of the new ability that she somehow obtained. All the while, completely oblivious to any possibility of the consequences.-summary

When I fist saw this flick years ago I didn't expect it to be so good, especially when considering it was directed by Mamoru Hosoda, director of numerous Digimon titles; but I was very impressed by this movie. So impressed, that I watched it twice back to back, and it can easily make my top ten list of best anime films.

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a very well crafted film, and it does a lot of things right. The film does a very good job developing the characters personalities, but the main character Makoto possesses the most depth as it should be. The other characters are very likable as well as believable. They have some very fun and realistic personalities. I think there's someone everyone can relate to(that is, if you don't crave completely angst-ridden characters). The character development did surprise me somewhat due to the length of the film. Many anime films forsake character development, and merely utilize their characters only as plot devices, thus making it hard for the viewer to establish some type of connection. Thankfully, this isn't the case here.

Makoto is definitely the heart of the film, in which she drives home the films ""coming of age"" theme. Watching her grow by making and attempting to correct her mistakes is something viewers can take away, and possibly grow on for themselves.

The premise of the film being able to travel back in time appears to be a pretty realistic and heavy theme to me. I'm sure almost everyone in existence would love the ability to go back and fix some past dilemma. I believe this was a plot device that was used to some good effect.

The film is very fun, light hearted, and packed with a good dose of comedy that actually works. The comedy is more present during the first half. However, later on it takes a very dramatic turn with a thought provoking, yet realistic twist that definitely adds a bit more depth to a story which used such a serious gimmick to begin with. The film teaches one the possible hazards of being able to change past events, while also showing the possible benefits as well. Makoto's intentions on time leaping were innocent in every way, but her unawareness on the trade off proved to have consequences.

The animation is very good as well. It's very fluid throughout with great character body, hair, and facial movements. CG was definitely used and wasn't really a problem, but I've seen it blended in with 2D a lot better. The artwork is fantastic at times but not consistent. Overall, the character designs, and the scenery especially gives off a very neat and clean appearance. The backgrounds are simply beautiful.

I also have to give credit to the very wise use of the budget. The production values were pretty high, and this film could have very easily gotten worst visually over time, but they cleverly reused scenes during time leaps to prolong their budget. Therefore, the animation stayed at its best throughout even though there were a small amount of stills used. However, to a small degree which happens to play into my lows. The reused scenes are actually a negative for me just a little. The time jumps added to the comedy, but sometimes those exact scenes would replay in an almost endless loop, and the comedy would wear itself out. That's like someone telling you a funny joke 6 times in a row. It's just not going to be as funny anymore.

The soundtrack by Kiyoshi Yoshida was also very good. It consisted of piano pieces that would begin slow, and eventually speed up to match events during scenes. This provided a nice tune, which seemed to fit very well with the personality of the film. The voice acting was very well done for both languages. Of course, this is another time the sub outshines the dub clearly; but I will always prefer the dub in almost every thing that I watch. My reason being is simple. When focusing on reading subs, it's more difficult for me to pay attention to the visuals.

Overall, this is an anime film that more people need to know about. It's definitely among my favorites and I think it can fit perfectly in any otaku's collection. I also believe there is a lot here for casual fans as well.

And the other 5 star reviews pretty much speak volumes.  But I have to wonder why this movie hasn't been re-released on Blu-ray.  It's my understanding that the Blu-Ray came out as Bandai went bankrupt or sold out so it was in very short supply after the initial release.  But I look around the net and see the film is still available pretty much everywhere except the US.  It's in Australia, but with a B region code.  It's available in Mexico with the A region code but no English language track.  It's obviously a popular movie with almost everyone who sees it, so why is it so impossible for a company to release this title on Blu-ray.....again.  Just asking?

Now that I got my collector's vitriol out, let me say what the movie IS.

It is a beautifully directed slice of life high school romance story with a neat scifi twist. The closest mind bending sweet story I can think of that comes close to this film is Groundhogs Day, but rather that the time loop being subject to a reseting clock, it is subject to the whims of a normal sweet high school girl and all of her neuroses. It does get dark at some moments, but what time travel story does not show a worst case scenario for time traveling highjacks?

3228446,3,B000X0G92U,"--Update--
I have come to the understanding that the movie is based on short stories from a Japanese youth magazine, which may explain the abrupt plot shift. People who may be well versed in Japanese culture, and knew about the original story (as it is fairly popular, like Dune or Lord of the Rings), probably expected this plot shift, but for us casual anime viewers, it probably came as a total shock.

I will leave my review as it is, and I have yet to make an edited version of the movie (for personal use), but I may get to it someday.

--Original Review--
I was recommended this movie, after having seen all of Miyazaki's films (I have also seen other anime movies and series). After watching it, I understand why there is all these five star reviews here on Amazon. The story is engrossing and will have you at the edge of your seat. It is a great mix of comedy, mystery, action, and even teenage romance. You can relate to Makoto, the main character, and there is a natural flow of her learning how to use her new found power of traveling back through time. Let's just say that time travel is done with a great deal of comedy in the beginning, and seriousness in the end.

So why three stars instead of five or four? First, I want it to be known that I really wanted to love this film. However, this movie has one glaring problem, one that I hope is a cultural difference more than anything else. The problem with this movie is the ending. The ending is such a huge plot shift that it made me (literally) scream at the television. Let's just say that one of the minor characters reveals a secret that is completely out of the blue, and does not fit that character's personality or motives.

The best I can describe it is like watching Mary Poppins and finding out that Bert is actually a magic stealing robot, or it is like watching Batman and finding out that Alfred is an alien in disguise trying to learn human culture.

The minor character and how that character acts throughout the whole movie does not make any sense with the secret reveal of who that character really is. Maybe it is a cultural thing, or maybe it is just bad writing, but it is such a jarring plot shift (in the last few minutes of the movie no less) that it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I even joked (although I might have been serious at the time) to edit that part of the movie out of the movie. It is so late coming that you could literally cut a few scenes, splice a few others, and the movie would end just fine.

I know many will disagree, or they may agree, but love the move so much to overlook the plot shift. All I can write, is that you need to watch this movie. The ending may make this movie only a rental, but the movie (up until the last few minutes) is just pure awesome.",1375747200,14,2780,4.255681818181818
3228447,5,B000X0G92U,"I purchased this movie on impulse because I had a little extra money. Let me tell you it was worth the buy!

I would recommend this for those who watch subbed anime since the English voice actors are... well... not up to par. The Japanese audio is amazing.",1374019200,,403,4.2894736842105265
3228448,5,B000X0G92U,"Every bone in my body is telling me ""Jonathan, this is a romance, it's a time traveling romance filled with plot holes, love triangles, and more teenee gooy romance then you can handle."" Yes, it's true; I've made somewhat of a reputation for myself amongst my family and friends for my hatred of these kinds of movies. You know, close nit group of friends (two guys, one girl), boy likes girl but doesn't have the guts to tell her for fear of ruining their friendship, girl likes guy but doesn't want to admit it, other guy likes girl but doesn't want relationship getting in the way of school, girl develops time traveling super powers, drama ensues. You know, your basic stuff.  If this were ANY other movie, made by any other director, done any differently than it was, I'd probably have a field day ripping this film a new one. And why not? Didn't I rip Myazaki's ""Whisper of the Heart"" for the same elements this movie has? Yes, I seem to remember doing that, and having good reasons for it too. It wasn't a fluke, I'm not in the habit of giving out bad reviews for Studio Ghibli's amazing (and I do mean amazing) work, much less a film Myazaki himself, the MASTER of anime, produced. But I did, and I stand by that decision.

But how then can I sit here with a straight face and tell you that The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a magnificent film. Not just a good film, but one of my favorite anime movies of all time that managed to bring a smile to the face of even a sarcastic cynic like me. Even with all its mellow drama, its plot holes, the love triangles and teeny weeny `cry me a river' romance I couldn't help but find myself completely enthralled by the story and characters.  I just can't explain it, maybe I've changed, maybe this night I was just in the mood, as it were, for a heartwarming little story about a teenage girl and her love for the cute funny best friend. I pride myself for my consistency, in my taste in music, movies, my political beliefs, etc, I'm nothing if not consistent. Logic, therefore, would tell me to hate this film, but I don't. In fact, I love it, so for the sake of the reading public (you guys) I will try to explain, to myself as well as to you, just why it is I loved this movie.

Makoto, Chiaki, and Kosuke are the best of friends. Just like any classic friend trio their personalities vary a lot, Makoto (the lead female) being mostly carefree and fun loving, Kosuke being the brains of the outfit, while Chiaki is laid back, lazy, but fun to be around. Together they make an inseparable team, playing a little catch, singing a little karioke, or just riding bikes their bikes. Like any good anime this films main strength lies with its characters. Rarely does an anime film capture so perfectly the character and personality of its characters, and even rarer are examples of anime that do this for teenage characters. At no point in time did I feel like I was watching a movie about fictional characters in a fictional world with fictional problems, instead I felt like I was simply watching three normal everyday people as they interact with each other and the world around them. I cannot overstate how amazing these characters are. So that helps explain why I love this film, as characters are the foundation upon which any story is built. That's not what surprises me here.

No, the surprising part is that the  love triangles and twist ending didn't completely turn me off to this film. After all, those are just the kind of things that usually activate the `let's trash a movie' part of my brain. It's my natural response. My BS flag goes up faster than it takes for an Elfen Lied character to take their clothes off. My fingers find their way to the C-R-A-P buttons on my keyboard, and I go on a funny rant that gets on the nerves of every fanboy on the internet. Overall a lot of fun, you all should try it sometime. Let this movie serve as an example to the Twilight fans of the world, to the writers who make their living writing crappy teen romances to sappy/shallow readers. Let this also serve as an example to all the snobby critics (myself included) who would normally never give a story like this a chance. The lesson being that ANY story can be done well provided the characters are strong enough to drive it. At its core this film is a teen age love story, and in the hands of an unskilled writer (Stephanie Meyers is but one example) this story would be complete and utter nonsense void of all artistic or entertainment value. But in the hands of a skilled writer, a visionary director, and talented actors, art is made. And that is what this movie is. Art.

I watched this movie years ago and never quite got around to finishing the review for it, but at the time I gave it a 4/5. Upon seeing it again I've realized that rating wasn't enough, so I'll bump this up to a 5/5. Yes, I am that impressed by it. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is an amazing anime film reminiscent of the movies of the legendary Studio Ghibli. The art, the music, the cinematography, he visuals, all add to the story to create something of a modest masterpiece. Does it have its flaws? Yes, most notably the blatant plot holes that litter it especially near the end of the film, but compared to the overall quality of the movie such transgressions can easily be forgiven and forgotten.

I love this movie. I hope you love it too.

Most stories in any form, you watch/see/read once and that's enough. This one is a classic storyline that's been done many times in various forms in Japan and that region of Asia, but this is the best perhaps because it is so simple in execution.

One aspect I found interesting, if you have some idea of what's coming in the next few years (supernova/binary star passing/comet cluster/ realm border to 4d and all the earth changes in the EM field leading to the next ice age as the volcanoes, EQs etc go off), is that the male time traveler mentions near the end about how crowded it is at that intersection etc. Imagine the situation after the Day After Tomorrow if you went back in time and found a crowded world where in your own timeline, there simply weren't many that survived. It would be like going from the countryside to the crowded cityscape anywhere in the world. No wonder he stayed longer than expected and the potential for a sequel if made soon.

3228517,4,B000X0G92U,"Take the basic concept of the movie ""The Butterfly Effect,"" tone it way, way, down, and make the hero a 17 year old female high school student and you have ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,""  a charming coming-of-age movie.  The heroine is given the ability to travel back in time.  At first she uses her powers frivilously but, under the guidance of an aunt who once had the ability herself, she learns to use it more responsibly.  While this is going on, she has to make up her mind if she wants to become romantically involved with one or the other of her male high school buddies she plays baseball with.  One of them has a secret...

The target audience is teenage girls (it's a ""shojo"" movie), so I didn't enjoy it as much as others might.  You might call it a romantic comedy, but there isn't that much romance, and it doesn't really have a lot of jokes.  It will make you smile rather than laugh.  Once, when the heroine is crying, they make her face ""cartoony,"" and it makes what should be a serious scene silly-looking.  The story is mostly mundane (no explosions, mecha, or tentacles), so the animation is simply adequate and not very impressive, apart from a few ""special effects"" during the time travelling.  In spite of these drawbacks, I would say that it's worth seeing at least once.  The English dub is well done.  Rated 13-plus, mostly for minor naughty language and innuendo.

3228518,5,B000X0G92U,"At a glance:
""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is a film that explores that desire we all have to go back and change how certain events worked out in our lives.  The main character find herself to have this ability, but how did she get it, and what if any complications are brought about by changing things?  The film is another exceptional work by director Mamoru Hosoda, who has been pegged by many to be the director to succeed the great Hayao Miyazaki in directing.  Incredible acting, complimented with great story telling, with vibrant backgrounds and animation make this film a classic that all ages can enjoy.

Some details (and spoilers):
This film in particular brought about my interest in director Mamoru Hosoda, as he delivered an exceptional film that is easy to recommend to others.  Often times with anime films you really need to consider the content, the genre, and the associated appeal, whereas I don't even consider these when suggesting this film to others.  It has an appeal that exists at different levels, both to younger audiences, as well as older audiences, all the while maintaining a sense of good pacing and timing that keep you genuinely interested in the characters.  The idea of going back in time has unfortunately obtained something of a stigma, but this film goes above that by not using time machines, and not altering world history.  The main character wishes to change the events in her life not out of her desire for greed or power, but for some very relatable reasons that help you to feel empathy toward her and what she is going through.  Ultimately the film begins to address some of the consequences that her actions have had, and you're left feeling as though you gained something from the experience  I found myself enjoying all elements of the film and I didn't have trouble ""getting into it"" or being distracted at points that weren't done correctly.  This film had a lot of love go into it, and I believe that's why many have taken so well to it in return.

Pros:
* The high definition version is crisp, clear, and really shows off the beautiful palette used for this film.
* Voice acting on the dub and sub were both incredibly well done, the emotion of the characters came through, and didn't feel forced.
* Bonus features are included with this release on the DVD that comes with it (this does not include the DVD version of the film)
* Great story, good pacing, and effective directing establish this film.

Cons:
* The release is not a DVD/Blu-Ray Combo
* The features included are on a DVD rather than a Blu-Ray
* While not incredibly expensive, the Blu-Ray is still a little more expensive than maybe it should be for a movie.",1334188800,,2684,4.649048625792812

3228521,4,B000X0G92U,"My husband and I have been Miyazaki fans for some time now, but haven't explored other anime films that much. We just had the opportunity to see TGWLTT and were utterly charmed. It's a big encouragement to widen our anime horizons. Not only is it a memorable love story between two remarkable youngsters, it is a morality tale about adult responsibility and how a teenaged girl is compelled to grow into it--nearly at the cost of the lives of innocent people. What she is doing--jumping back in time to make trivial changes in her life--proves to be fantastically dangerous. The time travel schtik is merely the fuel source that enables the engine of the story to tick along. This is all about making bad decisions and good decisions--the stuff of adult life. Also, the lankier, sparer look of the anime style (vs. Miyazaki) is enchanting in its own way. A little more minimalist, but that's fine. Just a terrific film and highly recommended.",1331337600,,942,4.785276073619632
3228522,4,B000X0G92U,"This is a wonderful movie. The only way I can explain it, is the first impression isn't the lasting one, at least for me. I didn't like this movie the first time I saw it.

I fell in love it with over time and realized this story will capture you and you will never want to leave. You'll want to watch it over and over and remain living in the perfect moments of the film.

I have now seen almost every version of this story. From made for TV dramas, TV shorts, and the semi-recent Live Action movie. I highly recommend this movie.

It's like a mystery and a teen coming-of-age story, wrapped up in the mind-bending logic of time travel. And for that last distinction, it does fairly better than many with only one or two holes.

It's family friendly and not so disorienting as to be indecipherable.",1327968000,,359,4.682539682539683
3228524,5,B000X0G92U,"I will say up front that the music, story, voice work in Japanese (I didn't watch English version), plot twists...it's just really lovely. The only weakness is some of the roughness in animating the human movement...but it's a minor quibble. This is a lovely, lovely film.

I won't say it has a happy-happy ending. I will say it has a beautiful ending, and everything that leads up to it is rather thrilling. It has some humor, some suspense, some sadness, some romance, and a lot that makes you wish you were young and had these great friends again, like we did in those days when we didn't have to worry about adult concerns, we were all about school-buddies-budding loves-etc.

I also love the idea of what ends up mattering the most--what would YOU travel back in tme for?--and how sometimes we do get a chance to fix things, or we mess it up more; but nothing can be perfect, even when we wish it so. We just do our best and hope for better.

I don't want to give too many specifics and mess up this film experience for you. Try to avoid spoilers. Trust me: This is best seen without knowing much of the plot other than, ""Girl (Makoto) who has two guy best-buddies with whom she shares most of her time finds her and their lives changing--and those in her wider circle-- when she acquires the ability to time leap."" That's all you need to know. More will spoil it for sure.

I'm not going to give any spoilers, but I'm going to say how much I love all the exciting twists and turns this movie throws at you.

The main character, Makoto, is your average, ordinary teenage girl. From what the movie suggests, she lives in Tokyo, Japan, where she tries hard at her school. When she seems to be slightly down on her luck, Makoto accidentally trips and hits her elbow on a time-travel device. From then on, much of the story shows her abusing the powers of time-travel. It all leads up to a suspensful climax.

3228530,5,B000X0G92U,"I watch a lot of different types of movies, and usually watch movies that either have more explosions or challenge the mind.

On a whim, I decided to check out The Girl Who Leapt Through Time when I was at Anime Detour in Minneapolis a couple years back, and boy was it a great decision!

This is simply an amazing movie.  The animation is superb, the voice acting is excellent, and the audio is astounding.  The Girl Who Leapt Through Time focuses on the very minute visual and audio details, ranging from small, barely visible objects to birds singing off in the distance.  Most movies don't put this much detail in, so it's very refreshing to see people think about the small things, especially when getting down to it, this movie is about the small things.

I'm not going to delve into the details about the story, but the actors were amazing, and really threw their emotions into their characters.  It's all the little things, the interactions between the characters and between the characters and the world that pull you into the story and makes it all believable.

I usually don't care for movies or TV shows when they force the characters to act like someone in this age group, when most people don't act like how they are portrayed in the media, but this movie is much more believable.  Going back in time to re-eat some pudding?  Now that's something a teenager would do!

I wanted to buy this on DVD, but when I heard it was coming out on Blu-ray, I knew I had to buy it ASAP!  The BD version does wonders for the minute audio details and the beautifully drawn/painted landscapes in the movie.  I just wonder how great the quality of the original 3000 pixel film reel version was.

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is my favorite animated movie!",1318896000,,1755,4.53015873015873
3228531,4,B000X0G92U,"When I was done watching this, I realized how much it reminded me of ""Run Lola Run"" - but the novel ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is based on came out decades earlier. So I guess Lola was influenced by Yasutaka Tsutsui's 1967 novel, ""Toki o Kakeru Sh'jo"" - the basis for this movie.  The comparisons are natural - Lola runs and runs to effect time. Makoto runs and jumps.

Makoto's adventures start by accident, and she's later convinced by her Aunt that it's a natural skill for teenage girls. She keeps jumping back in time to fix minor problems, but her ""corrections"" build up and she has to correct more and more serious complications.  It's an interesting romp in the life of a Japanese teenager in high school (again with the high school? Is every Anime set in a Japanese high school?) that features some amazing animation.

You don't have to - or want to - think too hard. The sub-plot with the missing piece of art is a stretch, and the last lines of the movie make for a feel-good ending, but make no sense. The art would be a total paradox that would have made the events in the movie impossible, and since Chiaki is from the far future, the last few lines in the movie are also impossible.

But it's not supposed to be a thinking movie - it's supposed to be entertainment, and that it is. Solid, fun and enjoyable.",1313884800,,1329,4.3861788617886175

It's a story of a High school girl procrastinating her final year and failing to commitment, only to later fall in love as well. The plot is deep enough to make you think about it later, but easy enough for others to understand so you can hold a conversation about the movie with non anime lovers.

3228567,5,B000X0G92U,"Putting in my two cents:

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time has been on my to-watch list for awhile, but I never took the time to check it out until yesterday.  I (like most of the other reviewers) wasn't expecting too much, but after viewing their newer film ""Summer Wars"" I decided to give it a go.  I have to say that despite being a slightly older film, this exceeds Summer Wars in almost every aspect (except maybe computer animation).

There are literally no weaknesses in this film.  The animation quality remains high throughout.  The characters are beautifully hand drawn and the backgrounds painstakingly rendered (mostly hand drawn as well).  The use of computer animation is kept to a minimum and mainly occurs when we view a 'leap'.

The characters are strong and likable.  Makoto is your typical clumsy teenager.  A chance encounter followed by a (nearly) horrific accident enable her to 'leap' through time.  Rather than use this ability for so called 'evil' (I would be leaping back and investing heavily in certain stocks...), Makoto uses the ability to make her life and the lives of her friends better.  However, this begins to cause unforeseen and dire circumstances.

And this is about the point where the  movie shifts from lighthearted and somewhat comedic to fully dramatic and saddening.  I won't divulge any events or spoil any plots for you, but let's say that I was moved by the end of the film (though not quite teary eyed!).

The Japanese voice acting is strong, especially considering at least 2/3 main characters are voiced by a first time voice actor.  It goes to show you how in Japan, they take the voice acting seriously and cast well (rather than the majority of American dubbing firms which have a core of 5 or 6 full time actors that they HAVE to match to a main character in each series or film - often not getting the best match to the character).

So the story is strong with a little sci-fi edge, the characters are likable and well portrayed, the voice acting is wonderful, the animation is gorgeous... why haven't you seen this yet?  If you are not a fan of anime, this might be a good film to help change your mind.",1306022400,5,2159,4.63421052631579

New to anime, as a genre and as a form of cinema,  ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time""  proved to be a special introduction for me. . . .  In fact, this film has proven to be consistently among my favorites, of any genre.

Well-told with structural complexity, ""Girl"" often suggests implicit meaning well-beyond its family-friendly exterior, begging for open discussion and considered review.

As a film, it's highly entertaining, well-paced, well-drawn with appropriate ambience and a tale that is simple to understand, yet poses difficult choices for our heroine with varied results.  A ""Girl"" with a clear agenda, beset with problems of her own making, finding solutions that might not really be solutions, after all.  It's fun, wistful, and challenges the viewer to extrapolate meanings not always displayed.

Simply put, watch it.  It's better than good. . . .",1304121600,2,968,5.187096774193549

3228573,5,B000X0G92U,"I am an avid Anime fan.  I actually learned Japanese in college for 3 years for the sole purpose of watching Anime and reading Japanese Comics (aka Manga).

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (aka ""Tokikake"" for Japanese fans), leapt through the Japanese animation industry, catapulting Director Mamoru Hosoda into what I consider the ""next"" Miyazaki. This film won the 2007 Animation of the Year in the Japanese Academy Awards and his next work&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summer-Wars-Blu-ray/dp/B004DMIIOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summer Wars [Blu-ray</a>] won it in 2010.  It has now even been made into a Live Action movie with the same Japanese Title ""Toki wo Kakeru Shojo"" aka ""Time Traveler.""

Based on a novel, Tokikake the movie is actually a Sequel of the original novel (the protagonist of the original novel happens to be the Aunt of the main character in this movie--which makes us feel bitter sweet when the Aunt mentions what she mentions.)  And I won't give you a synopsis (the description and other reviewers can do that), but if you enjoy old Ghibli classics, you will also enjoy this movie.  The interesting thing about Director Hosoda is that he is able to mix Sci-Fi elements flawlessly into a normal modern day culture--well, Japanese culture--which draws you right into the characters and story.

Like his newest movie Summer Wars, this movie also mixes multiple categories of comedy, romance, slice of life, sci-fi and drama.  He'll give you a couple of twists in the story that will make you ""oooh!"" and ""Ahhh!"" in between the laughs and tension.

This is not only a family friendly movie (although I have yet to watch the English Language version, so not sure how they translated it, as sometimes they'll add expletives when there is none in the Japanese version, so will update this once it is released and I watch it) but it will be an excellent introduction to someone who enjoy's a well scripted movie.  This is not an ""action-packed"" sci-fi thriller, so don't expect skin and violence and fighting without a plotline.  Just get this when it comes out and you won't regret it.

3228574,4,B000X0G92U,"I thought this movie would be a bore and lull me into sleep.  But I was hooked.  The great supernatrual element but still grounded in real life makes this movie.  It dosen't get stuck with the time travel it is used as a plot element.  The main girl starts off as a teenager with a normal life and two good friends.  And turns out to be a little full of herself but then you find her soft side.  Her friends are good charecters as well not imperitive at the start but near the end... I won't ruin it.

Not for the action fan but great for an anime fan.  Think a Spririted Away without the monsters and spirits.  The down to earth with the small amount of supernatrual element makes a beautiful movie.  Hopefully the team that made the movie stays together for a long time.  I want to see more of their work.",1301616000,2,807,4.175324675324675
3228585,5,B000X0G92U,"I will admit to knowing absolutely nothing about Manga and I thought this film was going to be an easy going cartoon. On watching I started to think 'this is going to be awful' when the heroine Makoto did her first face gurning over exaggeration. It reminded me of some really terrible cartoons my daughter used to watch. Luckily the gurning only reappeared occasionally in this story.

The voices and soundtrack are really good. You forget it wasn't originally English. The haunting piano music also stood out. Some of the settings and skyscapes are stunning and the leaping through time images were original and great to watch. The 'drawn' characters stopped me from ever believing this was a real story but I still enjoyed it.

This film is great fun. The leaping through time always ends with a comic thump back to earth or 'is anyone dead yet?'. You don't know what is going to happen next. The story also develops well and takes an unexpected turn into a sci fi love story. I think because of the themes the 12+ rating is about right.

I would describe this film as a cross between 'Groundhog Day' and 'Back to the Future' both very likeable, easily accessible films and this film is too. The story revolves around a highschool, a baseball field, an art gallery, Makoto's home and the road to school. It is quite a limited claustrophic setting but it works well and builds up the story tension as different things happen on ordinary days with Makoto's intervention. Some of it is life and death and some of it high school angst and some is pure pudding humour.

I think teenage girls would especially like the teen romance storyline. I think this would definitely be a teen 'date movie'.

3228588,4,B000X0G92U,"'The Girl Who Leapt Through Time' is an animation that follows your basic 'butterfly affect' storyline, but played out by Japanese teenagers. Therefore the adolescent changes made are seemingly no big deal, like helping the main character getting up late, enjoy marathon karaoke sessions and eat lost puddings and yet over time these small changes create a bigger impact. The film then follows her as she tried to resolve these issues and get her life back on track. The animation is very beautiful, without being too slick or digitalised (such as in Steamboy) and reminds me of Studio Ghibli's output, which has amazing animation but without the explosions and excessive animation tricks of other manga i've watched. This is all about the story and the animation. This film is relatively short at just over 90 minutes and it managed to keep me interested for the duration. It isn't the most original or stunning animation I've ever watched, but it was perfectly watchable and enjoyable never the less. Worth a try.

Spectacular animation, beautifully made, wonderful music, and great concepts.

I do feel it leaves you with some questions here and there, but it all seems to fit in line with the story, the themes and tones and such, and gives it a ""mysterious"" or ""sci-fi"" feel.

This movie made me laugh quite a few times and get pretty sad at one point. It has it's light and serious points and is a fun idea of real life meeting fantasy (time travel technology and people from the future).

However, there is an identifiable place where the mysterious intrudes, and from that point the story changes.  Beginning with a near-death experience, she enters a new phase in her life that audiences will find immensely hilarious before the events that culminate in the climax of the movie.  The film specializes in slap-stick humor, social comedy, and laughs that comes from understanding life's experiences.  This comedy emotionally links the viewer strongly with the protagonist and, when the conflict occurs, it creates extremely powerful suspense and tension that is more involving than that which occurs in many suspense films.  This movie may seem to resemble Donnie Darko near the beginning but it is, in my opinion, much better for many reasons.  The animation is beautiful, the characters are memorable, the comedy is hilarious, and the action is intense.

I took a chance and watched it anyway because I love the scifi genre including time travel. The subtitles were fine. It's the first time I've ever seen an anime movie. As a result of seeing this movie, I'll definitely be more openminded about the possibility of seeing other anime movies in the future.

I did see one strange scene in the movie. There's a scene where Aunt Witch is talking, and then the camera focuses on a picture in the background behind Aunt Witch showing Aunt Witch as a young girl surrounded on either side by apparently her parents. Because of how long the camera focused on this picture, I thought the picture might mean something in the overall context of the movie, but nothing ever happened elsewhere in the movie that related back to the information in this picture. The whole movie was terrific, but I'm still bothered by the missing point of this seemingly wasted scene. Aunt Witch says she has time travelled too in addition to Makoto, but this is never really explained further anywhere. Why does her story appear to somewhat parallel the story of Makoto?

3228623,5,B000X0G92U,"Unlike groundhog-day scenarios, time travel stories do not involve a repetition of a certain day.  Rather, the protagonist goes back in time either accidentally or on purpose.  Star Trek is notable--or infamous--for its time travel plots, some of which are utterly laughable.  The concept is fun, but often breaks down via logic, leading to time travel ""rules"" such as not changing the past or screwing things up so much that you're never born.

But...what if you could go back in time and deliberately relive the same day, or the same moments, over and over?  What would you do?  What would you change?  Would you attempt to make the world a better place?  Would you go backwards for purely selfish reasons?

Consider, then, The Girl Who Leapt through Time (Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo), a movie that explores both concepts.  Usually, I don't have anything to do with schoolgirl-in-love-for-the-first-time movies--or TV shows, books or music, save for Little House on the Prairie, that is.

Based in high amount of realism, the twists of science fiction make this movie that much more special. While it starts off a little slow, once the twists start coming into play, the viewer cannot help but be drawn into this highly imaginative tale.

The plot revolves around Makoto, a student who discovers how to leap through time. Her antics are incredibly hilarious and realistic. Whether it is something a mundane as retaking a failed test or wanting to redo a night of karaoke over and over again, I was fascinated with the idea of traveling in time just to have those small moments back. The main characters are extremely likable and easy to relate to. They also add an extra amount of realism to the movie. They act, talk, react, etc. just as normal teens. You just cannot help but to like them. The plot takes a swift dramatic turn in the second half, when the main conflict finally reveals itself. To be honest, I found much of this part to be mind-blowing and completely unexpected-- in an amazing, I love this movie that much more kinda way.

Even though there are some slower moments, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is full of hilarious and poignant moments that will make you laugh, cry, and think.

the story follows a girl names makoto who likes spending time with her two best friends, kosuke, a serious, reserved sort or guy, and chiaki, a fun-loving joker. though the three of them have not always been best friends, we can see that they are very close and enjoy spending a lot of time together. the point at which the story takes a more sci-fi approach is on the day makoto is late for school. she is more often than not late, but on this specific day as she is hurdling down a hill, a train happens to be passing by at the bottom of said hill and she is going to fast to stop. she tries to slow down, but ends up hitting the barrier between the pedestrians and the train tracks and sends herself flying in the way of the train. just before she is squashed and our story is ended however, time stops and she finds herself transported back in time, and is safe from the squishing. she has some fun with this, though doesn't yet know the significance. around this time she discovers that one of her friends is developing feelings for her, and because she doesn't wish to change their relationship yet, uses the 'time machine' to avoid his asking her out. at the end she is forced to choose between love and friendship, but not in the way you'd think. the ending is something of a surprise (but you can kind of guess what'll happen if you pay attention to the clues), but the events that take place and the choices she makes leave you with a bittersweet feeling that makes the film worth the watch.

Usually, time travel is nothing more than a plot device with out justification, ""deus ex machina"" if you will. However, there are subtle changes that occur with her ability to time travel.

3228673,5,B000X0G92U,"This is one of the best damn anime films ever made, if not the best.

I haven't heard about Yasutaka Tsutsui's original novel on which this movie is based on. ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is a prequel to the novel. But God, this is a masterpiece, with dazzling computer animation, backgrounds that even Makoto Shinkai couldn't handle and the most satisfying drama I've ever seen.

The anime involves Makoto Konno, a high school girl who is clumsier than ever. She hangs around, playing baseball with her buddies, studious Kosuke Tsuda and shaggy Chiaki Mamiya. One day, sneaking around a chemistry lab, she falls onto a seed. Little does she know that this seed has special abilities.

On her bicycle ride down a hill, a train is about to cross, and Makoto's wheels lock. Just when she gets hit, she ends up back on the top of the hill, before the train ever crossed. And she's still alive. When Makoto arrives to talk to her aunt about her mind-tripping experience, her aunt gives the suggestion that she went through a time delay. Her aunt says that some girls her age have the ability to jump to a different time when they least expect it. Is this just a coincidence?

No, it's not coincidence. In fact, in the middle of her time travels, this story turns into a heavily emotional romance. As much as Makoto wants to deny her feelings at first, she cannot help but admire the boy who also keeps her safe from danger. This is one of those films in which people cannot help but cry.

By the time viewers understand how Makoto's time traveling works, we can't help but wish that Chiaki would stick around a little longer, to help Makoto out. After all, they are extremely lovable as a couple, and they care for each other so deeply.

But even when we just think that Makoto will end up all alone, the director manages to slip in a great ending. This is one of those films that will cheer anyone up. The characters have such strong emotional bonds. And the use of time travel is mind tripping. Computer-generated images of LCD timers litter the time dimension through which Makoto heads into the past. The backgrounds are gorgeous.

Really, there's almost no better romantic anime film than ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time."" In fact, anyone can truly say that this is the best anime romance ever made. And Madhouse Studio does a magnificent job--probably the best in their company history.

This is a must-have film. Get it while Bandai Visual is still selling it. After all, with this recession, there's no telling when Bandai will go bankrupt.",1236816000,4,2550,4.626106194690266

Being an artist I often find myself disappointed with the art direction in these kinds of films, but in this one I was completely blown away.

3228688,4,B000X0G92U,"akoto seems ordinary enough. She has her friends, goes to school every day, and makes her way through those confusing early teen years. Then, one day, she hears a noise in the school science lab. When she goes to investigate -- well, something happens, or seems to. After school, on her way home, her bike's breaks fail on a steep hill. She careens in front of a rushing train, with no way to avoid being hit. Then, quite suddenly, she appears back in the school again, a few hours before her date with death.

Somehow, she has developed the ability to go backwards in time, but with memory of that possible future. Then, over the next few days, she learns to leap at will. Life in early teen years gives plenty for her to want to do over, including romantic embarrassments involving her friends or herself. This ability has its limits, though, including a countdown that mysteriously appears on her arm. Then she discovers that she unwittingly took this ability away from someone else.

You won't find mega-mechs or flying swordsmen in this peaceful but engaging movie. You will find a few other manga stereotypes, including impossibly thin and leggy figures and shortie schoolgirl uniforms. Accept the conventions and look elsewhere for bam-pow excitement. This kid-safe movie offers some chaste teen romance and mystery, and some undefinable bit more. Give it a shot.

Makoto Konno is a slightly clumsy tomboy on the verge of the age right when teens start looking at the opposite sex differently whose priority is hanging out with her two best buddies - cheeky but endearing Chiaki Mamiya and evenheaded, gentlemanly Kosuke Tsuda.  One day, her bicycle brakes won't work, and she finds herself about to be killed by crashing into a train passing her lane.  Fortunately, a miracle occurs - and she finds herself having time-jumped backwards safe and sound.

After talking to her aunt, who had a similar experience, she experiments and finds that she can do it again, begining with small things like preventing the poaching of a snack by her sister.  But when things start progressing to slightly more serious matters and she takes a series of jumps in a panic when she realizes that one of her best guys is about to say something to her privately that will take them to a place from which they can't come back that she isn't sure she's ready to go, things take a dark turn and spiral out of control - and she finds that this time, she might not be able to fix what she's done...

Part sci-fi with a neat twist that anyone who isn't familiar with the source material probably won't see coming and part teen drama with an achingly accurate depiction of that critical time in life and personal development, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a warm, poignant work that should be in the collection of any anime fan.",1227398400,77,1664,4.5083056478405314

This animation turned out well, it beat out another animation by studio Ghibli, it won various awards,it also won special distinction for feature film at France's Annecy International Animated Film Festival.

3228692,5,B000X0G92U,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie due to its weird title and what I felt was an awkward animation style. Plus I was an avid Hayao Miyazaki fan, and I did not believe any anime movie could overcome the feel-goodness of his movies in general. I was very wrong.

""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" (or ""Toki wa Kakeru Shoujo"") is about a girl named Makoto Konno who, after a strange encounter in a lab after school discovers she has the power to ""jump"" through time. Literally.

Although it started off slow, the pace made the hackneyed concept of time jumping much more original. Not to mention the main characters were all extremely likable and realistic. I couldn't help but root for Makoto in whatever crazy things she wound up doing in the past. The things she went back to change were trivial things, like a test she failed, or when her friend Chiaki confessed to her. They are all things that ordinary, idiotic people like ourselves would do if we had that power. This story is only something the Japanese could come up with, and I commemorate director Mamoru Hosoda for blending mundane Japanese life with such a fantastical concept like time travel. It's warm, funny, and touching. That is, for the first half.

The second half of the film takes a hugely dramatic turn. It's almost mind-blowing in the way things played out. For spoiler fans, it has something to do with Chiaki (You know, the friend who confessed to her?). Anyways, I loved this shift in the plot, even though it lost some of its precious feel-good elements along the way. Makoto still managed to keep some humor in her crazy ventures, and her personality is not lost in the plot twist. Chiaki's transformation though, I'm still a bit iffy about.

I think this movie is way up there with Miyazaki's films. The perfect blend of fantasy and feel-goodness, along with some dry humor as well makes for an excellent film. I also felt myself warming up to the animation style as well, which was very contemporary, so I wasn't used to it, but I'm now completely in love with it.
