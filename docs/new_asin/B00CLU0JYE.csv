5726278,2,B00CLU0JYE,This DVD was not what I expected. I am a program director for a senior citizen activity center and what I wanted was a Zumba video to use when our Zumba Gold instructor was out. What I got was a break down of the steps if the four or five Latin dances used in Zumba. That would have been fine if it was then brought together in a Zumba routine. But sadly it was not.,1373760000,16,366,3.8933333333333335
5726279,4,B00CLU0JYE,"Really like the DVD.  The pair who do the training are great.  Beto gives excellent directions on how to do the various steps.  And, they go slow enough for you to get it.  We are beginners at Zumba and this DVD is exactly what I was looking for.",1372291200,17,246,4.0625
5726280,1,B00CLU0JYE,I was searching for a DVD to start an exercise group for seniors.  This turned out not to be what I needed.  I did not feel it was properly presented.  At least I wasn't able to use it as I wishedl.,1371686400,,198,3.7804878048780486
5726281,5,B00CLU0JYE,I liked it.  It focuses on how to do steps of different dances.  This is not a stand alone but is a helpful tool.  I can refer to it anytime I need amd I like that.,1397001600,,164,3.5
5726282,2,B00CLU0JYE,"I can't get much out of it as it too difficult to see the positions of dancers since they are wearing black.  I am not young anymore and while I can see perfectly according to the eye doctor, it is hard to see in dim light.  With the dancers in black I cannot tell the leg positions like is a leg bent or straight unless looking at it from a side view.  Having a lighter color for the leg covering or light colored stripes would make this much easier to follow.  I gave up on it after the first section since I could not follow it, but maybe there is a costume change.",1396396800,5,568,4.0
5726283,5,B00CLU0JYE,It was very helpful having the different steps broken down.  I am taking a Zumba Gold class at the Y and the instructor just starts at the beginning and goes straight to the end.  It has been very difficult to follow until I got the DVE and actually learned some of the steps.,1395273600,,276,4.188679245283019
