8188745,5,B000MX3R64,"'Stickin Around' is one of those cartoons that is really good, but is underrated for stupid reasons. The show centers around two kids in elementary school named Stacy Stickler and her best friend Bradley who are just going through the motions of growing up. What makes the show interesting are two factors:

1. The show centers around imagination. Whenever the characters want something or are faced with a situation that they can't handle, they rely on this abstract form of reality (which when you watch it, you can't tell if the events are actually happening or they are only in their heads at times).

2. The look and feel of it. The artwork of the characters literally makes it seem like kids created their own show (which is the show's concept). The colors bounce around giving the image that kid's can't color in the lines (Boiler Paint Animation). And the characters are stick figures.

This VHS tape that I purchased is perfect. It came to my house in great condition and I got a thank you letter from the people (I was not expecting this)! It comes with a few short previews in the beginning of the tape and 6 episodes of the series. Even a little preview of what will be on the next tape! A good price, too!

If you're a parent trying to find something for your child, I highly recommend this show. The age group is roughly around 8-12, but I'm 23 and still enjoy it to this day. The only problem is is that their are a few jokes which you might (or not) want your kids to hear (talks of death mainly).

Give this show a try no matter what age group you are. You won't be disappointed!",1253232000,3,1596,4.414965986394558
