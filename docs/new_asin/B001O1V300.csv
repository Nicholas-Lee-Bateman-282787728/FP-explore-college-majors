3725782,1,B001O1V300,Unfortunately the DVD was of very bad quality. No subtitles available and after 15 minutes the whole movie stopped. Within the very short time we were able to enjoy the movie the dvd stopped itself.,1321142400,,198,4.685714285714286
3725783,5,B001O1V300,"The (IMHO) most beautiful woman on the planet in almost every shot? Well lit, well dressed, and done up?  Giving a performance that'll have you hope she'll do a Hollywood movie soon? That's 'Fashion'!
This one's MANDATORY for Priyanka Chopra fans.
You'll fall in love with the characters and the story. There aren't any cheesy song and dance numbers, which are typical for Bollywood movies. Despite its run time, Fashion has a great pace and there isn't a boring minute.
The acting in general is more Bollywood than Hollywood, meaning some overacting and not always entirely believable to many US audiences. You'll see what I mean when you watch Fashion. Which you should. Because it's awesome.",1315612800,4,694,4.982758620689655
3725784,5,B001O1V300,"It's an old story--a small-town girl with big dreams of supermodel stardom. And it's no revelation that there's a dark side to fashion. Sexually-degraded, drug-addled models have been depicted in film plenty--but not so much in India. The 2008 release of 'Fashion'--an expos-like cautionary tale about the industry there--was well-timed. Indian models have been emerging on the world stage as never before--globally, they've become de rigueur on catwalks and commercials in recent years. And the two leads in 'Fashion'--actresses Priyanka Chopra and Kangana Ranaut--produce forceful, renewed insight into just how ugly the beauty industry is with performances that swept all the major film awards.

The director Madhur Bhandarkar is known for hard-hitting realism and gritty topics. Marginalized figures, such as women and gay men, populate his films, and in fact, most of his stories are told from the perspective of a female protagonist. The main character in 'Fashion' is Meghna, played by Chopra, a middle-class girl who quickly compromises her middle-class values as soon as she lands in Mumbai with a chaste, cheesy portfolio that gets her nowhere. She's no wide-eyed wimp--she was tough enough to tell off her unsupportive parents and leave home, and it's her aggressive confidence that gets her attention--but she's not comfortable when she has to get risque to get ahead. Nor does it sit well with her when she has no choice but to move in with a male roommate, fellow struggling model Manav (Arjan Bajwa). He's a true friend, though, and they end up in love.

Meghna's also got an aspiring fashion designer, Rohit (Ashwin Mushran), in her corner, along with another wannabe model, Janet (Mugdha Godse). Janet doesn't have what it takes to make it big, but she has a big heart, and when her kind, gay college buddy, Rahul (Samir Soni), a top fashion designer, asks her to marry him for appearances, she accepts the comfortable life he offers.

Meghna aligns herself with the wrong people, however--Anisha (Kitu Gidwani) and Sarin (Arbaaz Khan), who head a top modeling agency. As Meghna starts rising to the top, she plants the seeds of her eventual fall--sleeping with her married boss, drinking heavily, becoming cruel and cocky, burning bridges left and right.

Chopra's deft emotional handling of a character on an identity roller-coaster ride is matched only by Ranaut's explosive portrayal of Shonali, a supermodel already on her way out and an unbearable, abrasive drug addict in an abusive relationship. Ranaut has made a name for herself playing trainwrecks--in 'Gangster' (2006) and 'Life in a...Metro' (2007), for example. Ranaut does unhinged with such skill that she's in danger of becoming typecast. For the purposes of this movie--in which she plays an unstable showstopper--she is the showstopper.

3725785,1,B001O1V300,This is Bollywood at its worse.  Fake emotions.  Fake drama.  Fake characters.  Fashion is a terrible film.  I'd only recommend it if your taste for Bollywood is towards something Karan Johar would make.  If that's your taste then go for it.  If not I'd say far away from this one.,1279411200,2,281,4.5
3725786,5,B001O1V300,"If you like the kind of movies where a small-town kid makes it big, then this is a good one for you.  The storyline seems pretty real - the mother wants her daughter to follow her dreams while the father is concerned that it's not a good career move.  They find out about her mistakes but still love and support her.

The meteoric rise in the fashion industry of the main character is really fun to watch.  I agree with the other reviewers the fashion shows and other models seem like the real thing.  You see the naive young girl slowly lose her ethics until she doesn't recognize herself any more and has a breakdown.  But then with the help of her father she finds herself again and finds her strength to become the good person she can be again, and be true to her friends.

Excellent film!",1274832000,2,793,4.3175675675675675
3725787,5,B001O1V300,"This movie is about the fashion and modeling industry where some models descend into despair with alcohol and drugs - a story that has been told many times before (but not as well) by Hollywood (not saying it's a remake).  One model falls completely to the bottom of the well of despair while another one falls only half way down and tries to help her up too. This is a quality film and easy to give a 5 but it does not have all the usual attributes that cause me to buy Indian films.

If you are looking for an Indian film that is funny and full of songs and dancing with some over acting thrown in here and there, (one of the reasons why I buy Indian films) then maybe this film is not for you.  That said, the music and background vocals are the best I've heard in this type of film. Models model clothes that look like they could actually be worn on this planet and real top models (by anyone's standards) model and act in this film.

So many actors do such a good job in this film that it is hard to single out anyone.  Priyanka Chopra is an absolute goddess of beauty and her acting (in this film) is right up there with the best. Kangana Ranaut (a young actress playing Shonali, (the top model) is brilliant in a tough roll.  Mugdha Gogse (a real model who acts in the film) plays a wonderfully light hearted but mentally strong woman who is unaffected by the down side of the modeling industry.  The male stars playing gay designers are, in a word, fabulous (they walk the edge without being too much).  As in real life, there are 2 groups of people - those who use people and throw them away and those who help people while risking themselves.  This is what makes the bittersweet ending so gratifying.",1265846400,3,1710,4.285714285714286
3725788,5,B001O1V300,"An outstanding movie. Great depiction of the dark side of fashion world and how people use and throw each other. Priyanka Chopra is a brilliant actor. Arjan Bajwa is not just dashing and cool-looking, he has talents to match.

Most importantly the movie is about redemption and rebirth. Meghna Mathur realizes that she just got lucky due to Shonali and tries to help Shonali. An exhilirating emotional experience!",1249948800,6,413,5.073529411764706
3725789,5,B001O1V300,"Being a huge Bollywood Fan I can honestly say that, Bollywood has literally out done itself with this Film!!!! The Fashions, the music, the sets, the storyline, and the actresses and actors all magnificent. Buy this one you will not be dissapointed.",1245801600,4,249,4.9523809523809526
3725790,5,B001O1V300,"The movie Fashion was very ""at the edge of your seat"" type of film. Although it was very long, I was still entertained the whole time. The film is about a small town girl Meghna Mathur(Priyanka Chopra)trying to pursue her dream as a supermodel. Meghna's longing ambition and drive for success makes her unreasonable. On her way up the latter of success she encounters a new side of her. This side does not only show her arrogance(Forgetting those who care for her, Affairs, Drinking, Drugs, not showing up for work, etc) it shows her way down the latter. You will be asking whats next.

It is worth the buying, the songs will get stuck in your head.",1239840000,7,649,4.547008547008547
