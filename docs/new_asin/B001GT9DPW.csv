This is a great ending to the second season and it provides a good ending for the series. There is a third season being aired in Japan, which deals with the fallout from these episodes. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if it will make it to the U.S., since Geneon is no longer producing anime.",1228608000,3,356,4.313432835820896
