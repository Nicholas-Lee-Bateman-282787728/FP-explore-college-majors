4389448,5,B004IY1AVM,"How great is it to have in one collection 4 all time great TV westerns? It's hard to say which are my favourites however, I would probably select Wagon Train because it was one of the earliest TV westerns I saw. I loved the haunting musical theme especially at the end of the show. The evergreen Ward Bond and Robert Culp who grace the earlier series are standouts. The Virgianian with James Drury probably comes in next due to his characteristically strong performances especially now since these later westerns also were in colour. Not far behind is Laramie with John Smith and Robert Fuller who lead the show. Laredo is possibly next but not necessarily last because it has great humour especially with Neville Brand. Johnny Brown of the earlier Lawman series also heads a great cast. A must to have for the true western enthuasiast.",1359504000,24,836,4.732876712328767

4389456,5,B004IY1AVM,"This is a great DVD set for the price. I love westerns, but was only familiar with ""The Virginian"" and ""Wagon Train."" I just received the set yesterday, and have watched three episodes of ""Laramie,"" and plan on watching some episodes of ""Laredo"" later today. The picture quality is OK, as Timeless Media, the company that produced the DVDs, takes pains to point out in the introduction. And considering the price, the quality of the picture is fine. The stories and the acting are great, I enjoyed them very much. I don't know if every set has the same episodes or not; mine were:

""The Virginian"" the first 3 episodes of season 1 - The Executioners, Woman from White Wing and Throw a Long Rope
""Laredo"" the best of season 1 - Rendezvous at Arillo, Anybody Here Seen Billy?, I See By Your Outfit, A Question of Discipline and Limit of the Law Larkin
""Wagon Train"" the first 4 episodes of season 1  - The Willy Moran Story, The Jean LeBec Story, The John Cameron Story and the Ruth Owens Story
""Laramie"" the first 5 episodes of season 3 - Dragon at the Door, Ladies Day, Siege at Jubilee, The Mountain Men and The Fatal Step

If you like westerns, especially ones that emphasize character development and storytelling rather than violence (although there is violence in these episodes), you will love this set.",1452902400,12,1309,4.609442060085837

4389460,4,B004IY1AVM,"Purchased this for my dad and he LOVED it, mainly for Laredo. I already knew he like the Virginian but he had never seen Laredo before and now it is one of his favorites. He ended up getting both seasons on DVD after that. They are quite funny. Neville Brand is quite hilarious. Wagon Train and Laramie are just ok. Great price for 15 hours of westerns",1439337600,4,352,4.268656716417911
4389461,4,B004IY1AVM,"If you grew up in the 50's and 60's tv was filled with westerns. This volume gives you 4 series of the day. The Virginian,Wagon Train, Larado and Laramie. I didn't much care for Larado as I found it foolish rather than its intention for comedy. The other 3 series are wonderful with stars like James Drury,Ward Bond,Robert Fuller to name but a few. In short,the cast of these 3 series are strong and memorable. There are 4-6 episodes from each series. Overall,a worthwhile purchase!",1438041600,7,482,4.682352941176471
