4240103,5,B00406UK00,"I went to see this documentary before it was revealed to be a hoax. The whole Joaquin Phoenix attitude and behavior since the Letterman interview cut my attention and I was following closely what was going on with him.

I went to the theater aware of rumors of the movie being a hoax, but nothing was official, so I thought I'd go see it and get to my own conclusion. After watching the movie, I was absolutely convinced that the movie was not a hoax, I felt deeply for Joaquin Phoenix, for him being a mess and for his suffering.

A week later, it was officially revealed that the movie was in fact a hoax, and I was amazed. The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely incredible, I know a lot about movies and acting and I can say that his performance was so believable that there was no doubt in my mind about it being true even though I was aware of the possibility of it being fake.

I think Joaquin Phoenix should be nominated for an academy award for this film, and I recommend everybody that chooses to see this documentary to focus on his acting, and the fact that he was in character for over a year and half.",1288396800,5,1124,4.2924528301886795
4240104,3,B00406UK00,"""I'm Still Here"" is a very strange piece of filmmaking. During the making of the movie, when Joaquin Phoenix was making the rounds looking disheveled (almost homeless), behaving erratically, and telling everyone he was retiring from acting to pursue a rap career, there were 3 main theories: 1) that he was on drugs 2) that the whole thing was an elaborate hoax and 3) that he had just lost his mind. Upon the film's release, Phoenix and the film's director, his brother-in-law Casey Affleck, chose to reveal that the whole thing was, indeed, a hoax, thereby having audiences see the film knowing for sure that the antics on display weren't authentic.

So since the question on everyone's mind was solved before the film's release, how does the film stand without the mystery? Kind of so-so. Unlike Sasha Baran Coen's mockumentaries in which he plays outrageous characters meant to expose cultural hypocrisy, Joaquin Phoenix is just playing a version of himself ... which makes his erratic, self-obsessed, and spacey behavior in the film less riotous than it is just uncomfortable. Don't get me wrong, he gives a brilliant performance, one that satirizes the modern celebrity who is self-important, lacks perspective and self-awareness, and has convinced himself that fame has given him the ability to succeed at anything that tickles his fancy. By pretending to embark on a rap career when he clearly has no talent for rapping, Phoenix is a parody of all the celebrities, especially those famous for not doing much of anything, who ""suddenly"" think they can become musicians, actors, authors, or entrepreneurs without having any training, experience, or skill. It's just that as a whole, for all its subversiveness, the whole thing fails to be particularly engaging. Sensing this, it's almost as if Casey Affleck felt the need to add just enough shock-value stunts to the outing (gratuitous male nudity of Phoenix's assistant, Phoenix doing drugs with hookers, etc.) to keep the audience engaged.

So as a subversive satire and showcase for Joaquin Phoenix's acting chops, the film succeeds. Unfortunately, it's only sporadically entertaining. Which is why I'm giving the whole strange, audacious thing 3 stars.",1288310400,9,2212,5.175977653631285
4240105,4,B00406UK00,"The trailer intrigued me and I was not let down.  It was a bit dark and uncomfortable at times, but what amazing acting.  Maybe this was a partial tribute to how his brother, River, passed on.  I don't know, but I have never seen anything like this and was riveted the whole time. Very thought provoking.",1288051200,3,304,4.392857142857143
4240106,4,B00406UK00,"I'm not sure what to make of this film. Either it was a real documentary that got a little too real and forced the guys to say it was a hoax or it really was fake. I did not see anything fake about living the superstar lifestyle. I'm giving this film 4 stars because I was mesmerized by the events going on by Mr. Phoenix. This is an art piece in my mind and worthy of some positive feedback. Perhaps, I am one of the few who ""get it"" but I thought Phoenix's lyrics were actual very good and I must admit I was singing the ""I'm still here"" theme in my mind for a day or two. It makes me wonder when the music video is coming out for the title song. Yet another opportunity for Affleck and Phoenix to get together and be creative. All in all this was a brutally honest film that got out of hand at times and I applaud Phoenix for the courage to put himself out like that to the world. I do not recommend this film for children at all because of the nudity and language (among other things). Adults can sit back and enjoy the peek into an artists life that Phoenix so graciously presents to the public. If this film was a fake, then consider me fooled.",1286841600,,1150,4.070484581497797
4240107,3,B00406UK00,"Oh my gosh.  What a maroon!  I almost feel sorry for JP, but then he opens his mouth and you realize he is a pre-madonna, winy little man child!  What an idiot.  He couldn't just respect his success and good fortune.  He couldn't just respect his audience, and the people around him.  What a douche!",1286323200,3,299,4.345454545454546
4240108,2,B00406UK00,"First off Joaquin Phoenix is a wonderful actor but has always been a bit of a troubled person. His brother River back in the 90's died of a drug overdose and most people thought Joaquin was soon to follow. So that raises the questions why would he want to tarnish his career by making an idiot out of himself, being hated by his peers and fans and just making himself look like an overall a-hole? Well. A lot of people who have drug problems or problems with fame usually just off themselves, go bankrupt or just disappear without a trace. The pressure was obviously getting to him so he decided to have his Brother-in-Law Casey Affleck(brother of Ben, whom ben hates) film this Shockumentary for people to view his melt down. This is the real deal, he is NOT that good of an actor to pull of an elaborate hoax such as this, if he were people would be laughing, he would be on the today show apologizing, among other talk shows, and also doing interviews. When he came on David Letterman the only reason he did it was to cover his a$%, and he knew that was the place were he majorly screwed up for the last time, and thought well i'll go back and pretend like i meant to do it all, and say gotcha DAVE and world.

For one, the use of illegal drugs on camera, which were not fake, snorting rock, coke, drinking, and smoking weed was NOT an act, nor was his manic behavior and glassy eyed cold stare through the whole film. You actually think people will watch this and say YES i definitely wanna work with this guy, he's wonderful. Also lets not forget the prostitutes he orders online when he's in New York in which it graphically shows him snorting coke off of a hookers breast among other sexual acts. All which leave a very sour and sickening feeling in the pit of your stomach. He claimed that lots of reality shows are staged while being interviewed on Letterman, which may be the case but taking it to such a shocking level is something people don't really want or care to see. Also those shows are made for a reason, and there is no just provocation at all for filming this insanity. Why rap? Well as he said he wanted to try something new, so why not? P Diddy being in the film a lot more than anyone else, should sue the crap out of him and whatever he has left. P Diddy is no actor and was not acting in this film, you could tell he was very annoyed by the camera(when he ""knew"" it was on) and that he didn't like Joaquin's behavior at all. At one point in the studio P Diddy gets really ticked off in the studio saying dude your not ready to record with me, and pretty much tells him to P off.

Not that anyone cares enough about this film to really care if i spoil it or not, i will just say its basically a rated X shockumentary and some of the things in it are just down right apualling. At one point he gets so mad at his friend-personal servant, that he rants on about how he is such a loser and piece of $%$^ and says he will S$%$ on his face, he will S%$$ on his face as he repeats over and over. Then the guy says ok, and they go into Joaquins bedroom when he's asleep and tries to take a dump on him while he's asleep. Umm ok. That will definitely put him in the runnings for another Academy Award. Also the language is beyond foul, every four letter word and then some fly out of this wasted piece of trash druggies mouth and you find yourself going wow, i use to like this guy.

So whats next Joaquin, you come back to acting and start a movie, and doing TV interviews and 18 months later say nahhh, i was just kidding, i'm quitting acting to become a shepperd or no wait and ARC WELDER yeah thats it? Point being this dude has severe mental disorders as you can sense in some of his films. His drug use is out of hand, also i'm not sure how he would stay out of trouble with the law by using illegal drugs on film, i'm sure a lot of law men have watched this saying, wow this is sick, we need to go pick this dude up. Of course most wouldnt know who he was in the film, hense the big ole nasty beard, and nappy hair. So seeing all the people he made mad including Ben Stiller, whom he really hurt when he asked him to play a part in his film Greenburg, when he said i HATE this part, really isn't going to just ""go away"", no matter how much A$% he kisses. So in summing this up i really feel sorry for a guy who had it all and just ruined it by trying to pull a stunt that backfired drastically. Am i wrong? I wish, but i don't think i am. After all the damage is done he's looking for apologies(or maybe not) and he's not going to get anything anytime soon, nor will anyone trust him to work with them again. Would YOU? So so long Joaquin it was nice having a great actor like yourself, and i'm not really writing this review, i'm just pretending to so people will give ""ME"" some attention. I have a crew on standby ready to record my life of Amazon.com review writing. Can't wait to make a film that makes me look like a huge idiot to show to the world. Then when i'm done, i'll type another review saying SORRY it was a HOAX. Could you possibly dig yourself any deeper than you already have? I thought not.",1285804800,7,5132,4.13
4240109,4,B00406UK00,"Watched this twice (PPV).  If it's a gag, it was cleverly conceived and brilliantly executed.  If it's a gag, it's right up there with ""This Is Spinal Tap"".

Now, if it is not a gag, well, Joaquin Phoenix has transformed himself into the ultimate in Hollywood cliches.  The misunderstood actor who wants to move past the restrictions of Hollywood and ""express his art"".  If it is not a gag, the real issue is that Phoenix is a dope addict and a rotten person indeed...but it's almost certainly a gag.

The highlights:

* About to meet P Diddy, Phoenix tells his companion: ""Don't tell them you're from New Jersey"".
* There are a lot of scenes with men lying around on beds talking.  One particular friend likes to expose his genitals for the cameras.  There is another scene of a naked friend running around while Phoenix playfully chases him with a towel, popping the friend's hind end. As the movie progressed, I half expected a gladiator scene.  Gag or not, there is a subtext here.  Not sure whether that was intended or not.
* Phoenix snorting coke (or powdered sugar) off a hooker's breasts.
* Ben Stiller (in on it?) trying to convince Phoenix to play in his new movie.  Phoenix accuses Stiller of ""playing Ben Stiller"" and that is exactly what he is doing.  It was the same semi-loser character from all of his films.
* Phoenix fleeing a movie premier and fighting furiously to get through a door with a huge ""this is not an exit"" sign on it.
* The actual hip hop performances.  Phoenix is like the huge drunk guy on karaoke night storming the stage to sing ""Free Bird"". The best indicator this is actually a big gag.
* Edward James Olmos delivering a hilariously kung-fu-circular-zen pep talk about drops of water vaporizing and ending up back at the top of the mountain (or something like that).  Pricelessly hysterical.
* A much put upon and harassed hanger-on who, having been pushed to his limits by the insane rants of River's brother, sneaks into Phoenix's bedroom and defecates on his face.  Perhaps this was the sub for the gladiator scene.
* One of the hanger's on trimming Phoenix's back hair.
* Phoenix ranting (there are lots of rants), while being transported via rental mini-van, that ""Leo"" is traveling on private jets.  Then, singling out his non-movie star cohorts, informs them he (Phoenix) understands that jet set world and they do not...thus, they are ruining his life.

It's all hilarious, even if - not very likely - it's meant to be serious.  It's like an Oliver Stone film: incredibly entertaining, but having little to do with truth.  It is definitely worth a look and, not to beat a dead horse, if it is all a gag, it is a stupendous five star effort...and it is almost certainly a gag.  If, perchance it's legit, Phoenix has to be one of the worst human beings not convicted of a violent crime.  A colossally self involved cliche who should be forced to work construction for a year.

...but it has to be a gag.",1285372800,9,2948,4.594646271510516

How else do you explain a guy with Academy Award nominations (not to mention other awards)under his belt to one day wake up and renounce the world that made him? Evil Roman in Gladiator to brooding crooner in Walk the Line, you know Joaquin Phoenix is no joke in the acting department. Didn't anyone see this coming? HE'S AN ACTOR! HE'S PLAYING-ACTING HERE! I mean, come on, a RAPPER? Give up the fame and limelights so he can build up a half-ass career in rap? That alone's an insult to rappers everywhere. No surprise Sean Coombs (P Diddy, cameo) lets him down easy and tells him he's not ready to record with him.

4240116,3,B00406UK00,"This film is quite funny. Having recently watched it for the first time (2015), I recalled when Joaquin Phoenix quit acting, grew a beard, and acted strangely on the Late Show. Well this film gives a lot of insight as to what was going on back then and with him. If you didn't follow the story back when it happened but remember things like the famous and hilarious Letterman interview then you should definitely give this movie a watch.

The film follows Joaquin Phoenix as he makes his transition from an actor to a rapper. The concept itself is funny (this was the first I'd heard that Phoenix quit acting to pursue hip hop) and is made all the more hilarious as time progresses and we see him go through the trials and tribulations that come with starting a new career.

Overall I would say that this movie is worth watching whether you have knowledge of Phoenix and director Casey Affleck's idea or not.",1443484800,,908,4.530487804878049

4240157,5,B00406UK00,"As an actor, I think Joaquin Phoenix is flipping brilliant. And as a person, I think he -- like almost all people, and certainly most successful artists that our culture simultaneously idolizes and preys upon -- is infinitely more complex than we could ever hope to imagine. This isn't a movie, it's a cultural experiment; and in my opinion (whether we saw it or not) every single one of us flunked. Because the mere fact that we paid attention to this silly public persona, picked it apart, laughed, ridiculed, endlessly analyzed motivations -- that says all it needs to say about our relentless, ridiculous obsession with fame. The movie, the part that ended up on the screen, is utterly beside the point ... or at least, so personally relevant to Joaquin Phoenix alone (being swallowed up by a river, or a River) that our shallow ""connect-the-dots"" attempts are irrelevant.

So I'm not giving the movie itself any rating. But Joaquin gets five stars, and I'd give him six or more if that were an option. For enduring the excruciatingly violent and public loss of such a caring and gifted older brother, at such a young age and in front of the whole prying world. For figuring out some way to not only go on, but to carve out a career characterized by roles of immense insight, grace, humor, and sensitivity.

I don't pretend to know the first thing about Joaquin Phoenix. But I know enough to realize that a loss of that magnitude irretrievably changes the course of a person's life; detonates and re-shapes entire aspects of a personality; prompts certain questions about the forces that fuel celebrity. To me, a book such as ""Last Night at the Viper Room"" and this movie -- they're tragic cultural companion pieces. Neither one reflects back anything even remotely flattering.

I think that the whole project evolved based on how each stage was received by the media.

For me it raised some interesting questions about celebrity, such as how a celebrity is owned by the media and how quickly the backlash appeared once said celebrity expressed a desire to go in a different direction.

There are some unnecessarily gross parts such as the poop scene and the vomit scene. It's too easy to just shock people with stuff like that and it doesn't add to the concept or the narrative.

The most disturbing scenes for me were the public booing and the Letterman interview. Why were these people so cruel and angry? He can do whatever the heck he wants. We don't own him. Whether the whole thing was a scam or not, why did it enrage people so much?

Letterman and the audience were quick to mock and ridicule someone who wasn't even defending himself. It was like a disgusting scene of schoolyard bullying. What if it was real, what if Joaquin had killed himself later that night? Just sick.

I could see the value in this project, but completely understand those who don't get it. They're probably the same people who got angry or mocked him.

 A train wreck or Dr Drew's rehab is more dramatic and enjoyable and not so long and unsatisfying.

4240219,5,B00406UK00,"A few years back, I was lying in bed watching David Letterman, as I usually do each night before dropping off to sleep.  This one night, I saw a strange, unkempt man come out and do one of the most bizarre interviews I've seen in a long time.  I couldn't believe this man was Joaquin Phoenix.  I vaguely recalled who Phoenix was, but his appearance was so altered, I couldn't place the face.  I thought this was one messed up individual, but filed it under ""entertainment"" and turned out the light and went to sleep.

Sometime later, a friend at work and I were talking about him and his appearance on Lettermen.  That's how I learned about this movie.  My friend recommended I watch it, telling me Joaquin agreed to the documentary so people can see who he really is.  I wasn't told that it was untrue, or at least my friend didn't reveal it to me.  Perhaps he didn't know; I'm not sure.

This weekend, I bumped into this mockumentary while browsing Amazon Instant Video content.  I started watching it, not really intending to watch it out.  I thought I'd watch fifteen minutes or so, just to get a feel for it, then ditch it for something else.  Boy was I wrong--I was riveted!

This character profile is so well done, I actually didn't know it was fake until after I finished watching it.  I had to research what happened to Joaquin Phoenix since the documentary, convinced he was probably dead or in rehab or continuing to flounder in a puddle of his own ill will.  I then learned it was all a farcical documentary and he's not only fine, he has actually completed a couple of movies since this was released.

What makes this movie so brilliant is its realism.  Joaquin Phoenix comes across as his own worst enemy, locked in a career-destructive fantasy believing he's something he isn't--a rap artist.  Throughout the movie, I'm watching him throw away his true talents for something less than mediocre.  It literally is like watching a train wreck and it's a sad and painful descent to witness.  I finished the movie clearly affected.

I can see how others might be divided by its realism.  I am, to some extent.  At one point he attacks a heckler in the crowd while performing at a rap concert.  While he's escorted out of the place, he makes a pit stop into the bathroom to puke.  He really does puke . . . four forceful stomach-churning spews into the toilet.  That wasn't faked.  If it was, did he slip himself something to puke before the scene?  If it wasn't, what motivated him to puke if the entire thing was a setup?  Moments like this, along with many others throughout the movie, add realism and intense dramatic impact.

Perhaps there was an element of truth to some of what we're seeing.  Perhaps it was all scripted.  This is the brilliance of this mockumentary.  If it isn't real, it raises the bar, in my eyes, to how truly talented Joaquin Phoenix is.  And I have to hand it to Casey Affleck, who did an outstanding job creating this movie.

Joaquin clearly states SEVERAL times that he was, in fact, acting for this mockumentary. He said he still loves acting, and went on to discuss how he gained weight for the role and how difficult and eye-opening it was to play a character he himself called ""an ass.""

My credibility came to an end during the final credits and saw Phoenix's name as co-scriptwriter (?) or after watching those deleted scenes when he's receiving suggestions on how to come out of the water (an acted documentary?). Then, I had no doubts that this cake was rotten...

It is brilliantly made, a clever parody of celebrity, and the culmination of a extended real world prank by Joaquin Phoenix as he very publicly announced his retirement from acting and into a hip hop career. As directed by Casey Affleck, it catches the vanity and self-entitlement of celebrity with a knowing sense. After all Phoenix comes from a life in the spotlight, one that took his brother's life, and Affleck, the lesser known than brother Ben, is no slouch in terms of talent and brains. So they fashion a cunning end to Phoenix's prank. At the time this was released, many still believed that he had lost his mind. For a year the public worried that this talented actor had really lost it. All your worst assumptions and emotions about the privileges of being a celebrity are tweaked in this film. The viewer became complicit in the the prank because we were had. It is a brilliant and unique idea.
But the film holds up on its own, too. Like 'Exit Through the Gift Shop' by Banksy, it raises wonderful questions on art and life, celebrity and talent, by personally putting the filmmaker's, or artist's reputation on the line. And look for an great performance by Sean Combs (P. Diddy) as a hip hop entrepreneur who brilliantly parodies and plays with our expectations of Diddy himself.
The message? We don't know these people, so perhaps we ought to give up the judgements we make of these celebrities and stars with whom we hold no real affiliation.

Preface
I want to start off by saying, that I have never been a huge Joaquin Phoenix fan. I am not saying that he isn't a terrific actor, only that I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to see one of his films, just because he was in it. I, like so many others probably thought he was a bit of a weird guy, only because he has played so many strange characters very well. He was the villain in Gladiator, the older son in the Mel Gibson alien movie and I recently recognized him as a kid in some older movie. Joaquin seems to be typecast as a withdrawn or troubled person and I must apologize for formulating the opinion that he was probably like that in real life, although I haven't verbalized that opinion previously.

I knew very little about the months this was being filmed and wasn't exposed to celebrity gossip, the rumor mill and didn't know that Joaquin was interested in quitting acting.
I am not someone who generally cares about the lives of celebrities, their opinions and certainly don't follow a bit of celebrity gossip. I'm may have heard something about the David Letterman thing, just didn't pay any attention or give it two seconds worth of thought. I think someone mentioned the documentary on a social network since it seemed moderately familiar when I picked it up.

This is the first time that I have felt compelled to write a review of a movie. I am not a writer by profession, I do however write creatively on a regular basis for recreation. I also don't study film, nor am I a critic of any sort. I have nothing to gain or credit to lose by expressing my thoughts on this film and I'm going to be as real as I can be, because the film merits my honesty. That being said, it's the ""most"" real thing that I have seen in a movie and I have watched more than my fair share.

The story really could have gone either way. Joaquin could have very easily been a successful recording artist and Casey did a tremendous job of capturing the events as they unfolded. When you are dedicated to telling the truth or portraying the truth on film you are bound to have things that are difficult for people to watch, but seem less `real' when they are preconceived about the premise of the film. The same is true of the events in the story, people formulated opinions about what Joaquin was trying to do and it added to the reasons that he wasn't successful. A universal truth that goes along the same lines is thinking that you can do no wrong, because we both know that you are bound to screw up eventually and having that attitude is a mistake all around.

Joaquin is a dreamer with vision. I immediately recognized that he was trying to go beyond himself and show people that he's more than just and actor, evident by him saying ""his goal was to bring out, what was inside of him"". I would be willing to bet that Phoenix has always felt like an artist, who is talented in many different arts but always struggled to discover his true art. Most artists know the one thing that they are really great at creating and since Joaquin had a connection to ""hip-hop as much as anyone has a connection to a type of music"", making it reasonable that he would express himself through that medium. The deleted scene in which JP discusses the ""origins"" of rap and hip hop was extraordinary to say the least and I doubt that a lot of people could have gone into that much detail about the form of music. I gained a tremendous amount of respect and saw his depth as a human being for making this film. I can't imagine anything that would take more guts and determination to do and I have no doubt that this film will be widely studied and interpreted.

Who among us can cast the first stone and say that they too have never been fed up with their jobs and being told what to do or thinking that you have a good opinion about a particular topic and no one was willing to listen or worse, make fun of you? How many times have you been publicly embarrassed and it was only a few people that saw it, yet everyone seemed to know about it? How many of you have been passed over when you clearly deserved an award and talked trash about the person who beat you out for a promotion? How many artists and visionaries have been grossly misunderstood for expressing themselves in this world? Too many if you ask me, but what do I know?

Joaquin is someone who operates on a higher plane than almost everyone else on the planet. I don't mean because of his celebrity as an actor, having a fabulous life or the illicit drug use, he is a creative genius and is trying to let the world know that it exists inside him. He's not another celebrity who burned themselves out or become a recluse, Joaquin simply got an idea in his head that sounded like the best thing in the world and had difficultly fully expressing it to the public or in a way they would be able to appreciate and understand. In a large sense, Phoenix is blossoming as a person and expanding his universe and those of us who have watched the film and get what he was trying to do, it's a unique gift that could never be duplicated. He said something like, ""I'm doing more than what people expect he's capable of doing"" and he is/was correct, and few can comprehend doing something like that.

Here's the problem. You have/had the right idea, but you didn't follow the right path to finding who you are as an artist and you can't take shortcuts on the path of life. I am not going to come down on you for making mistakes like others have, I will just point out a few things that needed ""tweaking"".

I know that it felt like the most amazing thing in the world, when you told the entertainment reporter that you were quitting acting and afterwards it must have seemed scary to think about. You are an amazingly talented and creative guy who has always had to ""act"" a certain way to please people. You have to do what directors say, you have to do a lot of things your agent tells you to do and act a certain way in public and are scrutinized or judged by so many people. Even though you've had opportunities in life, you haven't allowed many people to listen to what you have to say and to be judged on what you are made of as a person, not necessarily who everyone else expects you to be. All I have to say is, what's wrong with that, doesn't everyone deserve to be heard?

Watching the movie
The first time, I went in ""blind"" to what the film was about and paid close attention to the events as they unfolded. Before watching the second time, I watched the deleted scenes and found much of them to be thought provoking and gained a bit more insight into the project. The second time I watched with the DVD commentary and the third time I watched it from the perspective of how it could have all been improved. (The plan and execution, not the film itself)

From the very beginning I believed it all to be quite real and I was drawn in, hoping that Joaquin would be able to get his message out as he envisioned. I don't think that I have ever vested myself so entirely into a ""character"" and I didn't want to see him fail. My hope in seeing him find some success had nothing to do with being a fan of his body of work or even his musical vision, it was that Joaquin has passion about something other than what his work and felt compelled to pursue it with gusto. Say what you want about Joaquin, but you have to respect the effort he put into it.

The initial viewing made me feel sick to my stomach. This is going to sound a bit strange, but sick to my stomach in a good way, like it was something that I really needed to see, and hard to imagine at the same time. It was torturous and inspirational for me and it was like looking at a clip of reality and how tough life can sometimes be for people. The range of raw human emotions captured on film is simply astounding. Where else can you see someone who is completely on top of the world, believe that he would never be accepted again? Where else can you witness the creative process at its best and worst at the same time? Embarrassment, rage, determination and passion are difficult things to reproduce and I felt all those emotions as I watched. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and wasn't distracted by anything while watching. I felt relieved when it was over and had a more positive outlook about the film the following day.

The deleted scenes do a lot to substantiate the film as Casey envisioned and opened me up to the possibility that the events were staged and I believe some of them were scripted and/or redone. The DVD commentary is terrific and for a while, I was leaning towards believing that it could be an elaborate, brilliantly executed fictional story about a real person. I am assuming that most people were willing to ""buy"" the story as a hoax, publicity stunt or experimental film, but there is one thing that prevents me from falling in line, people can't act that well. It's far too real to be make-believe, and as good as an actor as Joaquin may be, he isn't that good, no one is.

The third time watching was very therapeutic me and I studied the film closely, taking note of the mistakes that were made in the process of switching careers, being a better person and how complex being a celebrity must be. The ideas expressed in this ""review"" are based upon my belief that most of the events are mostly true, how easily the story could have gone in a completely different direction and the personal connection I had to the film.

JP
Hey, we love you man. As friends we can forgive and forget, because people sometimes screw up, its human nature. I have personally screwed up a bunch of times that were equally embarrassing to me as your defeats were to you and I kept on pushing through, picked myself up and dusted myself off, just like the song. I promise that how ever bad it all seemed, no one is going to hold it against you. You are passionate about life and so many things that you are simply brimming over and when people have those characteristics, they have the tendency to express those feelings, often at an inappropriate time and place. It's not something to be ashamed about, nor is it something to worry about if you don't follow through on your ideas.

Don't want take any of this as talking down to you and believe me when I say that I believe you to be a highly intelligent person. I do however think that you are probably a bit ignorant about some things in this world, simply because as real as you think that you are, (relating to people, observing their behavior, etc) you have to be removed from society on many levels because of your celebrity. It's important that you recognize that fans of your acting skills, (your fans) have only seen that persona, and we both know that there is a lot more to Joaquin Phoenix. You said it yourself; you have been in a self imposed prison of characterization.

I would also bet that you were that kid in school that genuinely felt different, not necessarily because of having a famous brother and doing your own acting, just that your mind was always off somewhere else or you were drawing pictures instead of paying attention in class. Maybe you were a daydreamer and always seemed to be doing silly kid stuff that got you into trouble because you let your imagination and curiosity guide you. I would also wager that you excelled in any class that allowed you to be creative and you were most proud of those accomplishments while barely scraping by academically. None of those traits are necessarily bad to have in a kid, however they must be challenged in a different direction than regular kids.

Acting became the thing that allowed you to feel special and that you were part of something greater than yourself. At one time your career made you feel important, like it meant something in the bigger picture and gave you something to focus on other than your emotions while pretending to be someone else. I can imagine that an actor would have difficulties discovering who they are, when you are so busy portraying someone else's. Are you who you are because you were supposed to be, or are you who you are because someone else expected you to act that way and guided you towards that path?
I am not saying that there is anything necessarily wrong with the person you became, because I think you are a fun, likeable guy, and look at all the famous people who enjoy your company, the adoring fans and friends who genuinely care about you and why wouldn't they? You are an interesting character and I don't mean that in the sense of characterization. You have a way of bringing out the best in people, which is a talent in itself.

The drug use did seem a bit excessive throughout the film and I am sure you caught a lot of grief for doing so much. What people didn't point out is that the film is 6 months of video, edited down to an hour and a half and the audience is thinking its excessive for that time frame and don't see the big picture. I will say that I realize that for certain people, illegal drugs benefit them a substantial amount. Drugs can be a cure for depression, make you feel less inhibited and for a very small group of people drugs open creative centers of the brain that previously were dormant, opening them up to a world that they previously didn't know existed. In no way am I advocating drug use of any kind and feel strongly that there needs to be limits to all things of that nature. There has to be a happy medium or some middle ground because no one can operate at a peak performance if they are too high and you know there is such a thing as being too high. I personally would have been more disturbed if I saw you abusing prescription drugs and saw none of that in the film.

You are someone that needs to work, needed something to do, needs something to focus on. That's why you were an actor, it was your job, something that you did that took up a lot of your time and kept you centered and away from the laziness and kept your drug use to a much lower level. You had to study, you had to eat right, you had to constantly be getting haircuts, exercise, you had to look good on camera and spend long days and nights working. In the snow angel scene you said something like ""look at the difference in me since I retired from acting"", and the first thing I thought of was, ""he's feeling better than he ever has, but he's getting lazy"" and I think it was due to the fact that you were sitting around waiting for people to return your calls, waiting for what you knew in your mind was going to happen. It's called ""hurry up and wait"" and you learned it the hard way.

Performance review/ TV appearance

Local hip hop club
You studied the materials, changed and adapted, ensuring that you had the lyrics perfected and it sounded very good. I think nerves had much to do with your cadence being off, because people have the tendency to rush such things, particularly when the music starts before you are completely ready. Things always seem and sound better when you are in familiar settings and don't have a large group of people, not entirely knowing what to expect.

After the first performance Joaquin said that the audience had prejudged him and he was correct. The music wasn't something that they were programmed to listen to and the audience couldn't relate. Following the performance in the parking lot, your rap was phenomenal because you weren't nervous and I bought into it the same way that Matt did. All in all, it deserved merit and should have been a profound learning experience.

Vegas
The sound check isn't so someone can get a free show. A sound check allows the performer to know exactly what they will sound like when they are on stage and customize the audio to suit your needs.

The show seemed particularly bad, but it was more audio quality and faces of several of the audience that lead to that opinion. The camera angles and lighting weren't great but your performance was improved. Cadence was good this time.

Dave
Dave Letterman's job is to crack fun on people. He doesn't have serious conversations on his show. The character of Dave is a sharp witted comedian whose job is to make people laugh and the night you were on, he did his job well. Dude, a beard is a conversation piece, an opener, something to chit chat about and you should be able to accept any and all jokes that come your way. If you had said, ""it feels cool"", ""I should have done it years ago"", he would have been done talking about it.

I'll bet the song that had the lyrics ""sitting on the couch with David Letterman"" were going through your head a mile a minute.

Dave landed his joke late when he said it was unlikely that you'd perform on the show, not that it was unlikely you were pursuing a rap career.

Correct me if I am wrong, but doesn't Dave have signs that say ""applause"" and it's the audience's job to clap, cheer and laugh when the show wants them to? They weren't necessarily laughing at you.

The uni-bomber crack was funny, sorry but true.

The Miami club gig.
Those people were freaking spun. How can you expect them to listen to something deep?
I am sorry, but that seemed like the wrong place and wrong crowd to tell your story. The music as you were waiting to go on stage was bumping at almost a techno level and the crowd was dancing like crazy. When you are engrossed in the music as they apparently were, it stinks when they turn up the lights and the music slows.

Cool camera angles before the set, but it looked like a body on a coffin at one angle, especially if you turned it sideways. Sorry but true.

There is so much angst when you are face to face and being judged by someone in the audience acting like those guys who hang out at airports with video cameras. It's profoundly worse when you are expressing your art and they are making fun of you, literally for no other reason than you are a celebrity. Don't take it personally man, just brush it off and drive on. Anger is a wasteful emotion, it gets you all wound up in a direction that you don't want to go in and there is never a positive solution.

Something I have noticed about people at concerts with cameras is they aren't getting all the enjoyment from the moment as they could be. Maybe they got a good photo or video that they can show their friends, but aren't you there to see the band or the singer? Shouldn't they be paying attention to the music the lights, getting caught up in the vibe of being at a concert? All the people with cameras are having the LEAST amount of fun and I feel sorry for them.

I agreed with Larry who said that it was your best performance. You were ready, it was your time. You went to the sound check (which is a good idea, because you will be familiar with the stage lights and the way you sound through their speakers). It's like a practice for the main event and you dressed for the occasion. I really think the audience would have been fine hearing another song or two.

Music producer
I almost can't say enough good things about him and I am using this film as my basis for saying it. He's someone that you want to be on time to meet and if you are late or hold him up, it'll cost you some points. He isn't one for high fives or chit chats, he's there for business and you had better come with it quickly. He's someone that you talk to straight and you'd better have a plan all squared away, ready to present

He's not used to dealing with artists, he deals with performers. You recognized him as being a super smart hip-hop guy, but he is a success because he knows what sells to people. He tried to explain the theory in the first meeting when he discussed what people do in their industries. It isn't about art and true exploration, it's about putting a product out that sells and he is an expert at producing that product. He was trying to say that just because you like something, that doesn't mean others will. He knows the business of music, how to make money and something you have to know is that there are no free lunches in the world. Everything costs something and so does becoming a super cool hip hop artist.

I thought it was funny that he was flipping the TV channel and asking the other famous person in the room about his recent movie and didn't have a problem saying that another movie that he was in wasn't any good.

At the first meeting he just talked about business. The second time it was from a trying to understand you better, perspective.

You were crushed by not going immediately into the studio that you felt defeated. He didn't say that you weren't talented, just that you music needed work before it would be something that he would produce. ""Play me a hit"", ""I need to hear a hit"". I while I am not saying anything negative about your music, you should have listened to the music that he was listening to when you entered. The song was polished, layered and had repeating rhythms, just like every hit song that is played on the radio

I paid close attention to his eyes as he listened to the songs and there is no doubt that his eye movements were real and he gave the three songs a genuine listen. The first sounded good and obviously it passed the producers test because he asked to hear two more. He was also correct about the third song not being good enough and I am not entirely sure why you played it when you obviously had others that were better. That's right; I said you had others that were better. The ""complication"" song was the only song I heard that didn't register with me and I don't necessarily think it was the lyrics; more like the cadence didn't work. I think if he had given you some constructive criticism and broken down a few things that didn't work about the songs, you would have left with a positive outlook. I guess what they say is true, hindsight being 20/20, because you had one of the most successful record producer's ear and didn't use that opportunity to learn something.

Dude, you made it through 3 freaking plays with Combs and I can guarantee that it wasn't entirely because of who you were.

Your Friends
Anthony's bit was making Joaquin a better person, taking care of him and being a friend and I thought he did an excellent job. I am sure he is a bit strange, but who among that group isn't? I would be willing to bet that being a friend and caretaker for JP is a full time job and it's difficult to do your own thing when so much is going on with acting, making music and traveling. Where was the time for extra curricular activities when you have so much going on that you have little control over?

Anthony only did what he thought was in your best interest and hopefully you made amends on a personal level AND support whatever he is doing now. It's the right thing to do. If he did speak to the press, anything he said was an attempt at damage control. It seemed imperative to him that he do something to protect your interests

Anthony was the number one fan of what you were trying to do which was clearly at its most apparent when he said he wasn't going to laugh at you. None of it was funny and he believed in your music and what you were trying to do.

I do want to know why you told Larry to not tell puff that he was from jersey.

I say more Matt. I really liked everything he had to say, especially in the deleted scenes. He's an insightful guy and I can see why he is a friend. He's real and an asset to you, listen to him.

You weren't using your friends to the best of their abilities and potential. They all seemed like sharp people with only your best interests at heart. You need to get them to agree on an idea before you go all out. They care about you and you should expect them to be a sounding board, keep you centered. You don't need a bunch of yahoos running around doing stuff for you. They are an asset, your team and you should value their opinions and expect them to tell it to you straight, every single time.

You are too paranoid about looking bad. Sounded like such a priss, worried about what other people thought of you. Who cares if other guys are in limos and riding private jets, you are rolling with your peeps, your posse, entourage or whatever they call it these days.

Casey, random thoughts and questions
I must applaud you to the highest degree. What you have made with the film ""I'm Still Here"", transcends everything I have seen up to the point in which I watched it and I doubt that anything that will come close to the feelings and curiosity that your film brought me.

You can assume that I'm the person to watch this in 30 years like you mentioned in the commentary.

Is it art imitating life or life imitating art?

Fast forwarding through the party and stopping on Anthony's junk was very funny.

The only way it could be fake is if you told Joaquin that he could be a famous rapper and advised him on how he should go about doing it.

You had me fooled for a few minutes with the commentary. I actually questioned my level of conviction with your well played commentary and ability to speak. No doubt it was well thought out.

I wouldn't be bothered in the least bit if I were to find that the documentary was a fake.

Do I believe that certain scenes were added and a few were retakes and things added to make it a better story? Of course I do, but there is no way that some of those scenes were redone.

And it's fantastic to put in actual people who work for you as different fictional roles, like the computer nerd blogger at the end, giving his spin on the film. I believe the story about Edward James Olmos coming to your school as a kid and Casey remembering it and taking a couple of powerful statements away from it, but I don't believe the rationality for why he was there talking to Joaquin. Olmos was there because of the childhood story and because he was concerned with the direction Phoenix was going in. He's a compassionate guy and wanted to be able to visualize where Phoenix was coming from.

If Joaquin had succeeded and the hip hop career totally took of then you'd have a documentary of success instead of failure.

.

Portraying it as a hoax was the only way that the general public would accept such a thing. I believe much of the commentary was a brilliantly crafted tall tale to appease the audience.

You got me buying DVDs again and that wasn't an easy accomplishment. I haven't bought a movie in probably four years

EJO and my interpretation
I personally became a much bigger fan, based on his performance. What a cool guy he was to come to your place and have a real conversation with you? What a powerful speaker EJO is and what an awe inspiring story he can tell. I am really interested to know what he thought about your music. At first I thought it seemed like you were rapping and he wasn't listening, but in subsequent viewings, I saw that he was intently listening to you and thinking about what you were saying.

For a few minutes I thought that you understood the meaning of the story when you said that the story was about revealing, which could be taken as renewing or unveiling, as in ""revealing one's true self"". It seemed that you were very enthralled with the story and EJO and his powerful speaking abilities make it easy to be inspired. I did a search of the word ""revealing"" on a popular online dictionary and it took me to the definition of revelations, specifically the book of Revelations from the Bible and I thought that was pretty deep in itself.

Almost immediately, I noticed a similarity between Olmos' story and the Beatles song, ""Helter Skelter"", but always interpreted the song to have a different meaning...

""When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and turn
and I go for a ride
till I get to the bottom and I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah""

I thought the story ""mountaintop water drop"" story was about humility or being humble.
My take on the parable was being closest to God when they are at their lowest, not getting back to the top of the mountain. When you hit rock bottom and say to yourself, ""how did it all come to this?"" you look for any bit of hope that you can find and when all else fails, you start praying.

Religion is much deeper for people than just cause and effect.(cause being at your lowest point and effect being that they get something positive out of it). Being at your lowest point puts things into perspective and grounds you like nothing else because the ability to change isn't in most people's programming, unless something pushes them in that direction. You could just as easily make the argument that people are more pliable when at their lowest and are looking at something to hold on to, but it's more than that. People have a need to feel connected to something greater then themselves and believing in God is as real as it gets for them and its human nature.

Being humble is one of the most difficult things in this world. You don't self glorify; you aren't supposed to think that you are the least bit better than anyone else, regardless of who they are. I don't just mean in your day to day actions, I mean in life. You being a celebrity make you have power that you didn't think that you have. How many times have you felt bad for snubbing a fan who may have simply wanted you to know they felt like they had a personal connection to you through your work or just wanted an autograph for their own collection that they would cherish for a lifetime? Not everyone is looking to profit from talking to you or taking your photo, I promise. I've always thought the reason that actors bowed after a performance was that they were humbled by the praise bestowed upon them. ""Thank you, I am truly honored"".

People love failure; it's the basis of most gossip and definitely the topic of most celebrity new stories and I am not entirely sure why. Are they dissatisfied with their lives and feel the need to ""pile on"" to someone else? Does the envy stem from a secret desire to be rich and famous or is it something to talk about like so many people talk about sports, religion or politics? ""Did you hear what happened to so and so?"" or"" Boy, they really had it coming to them, thinking that they were so freaking cool"". Some fanatics even feel compelled to take it a step further, breaking down the wall and do what they can to perpetuate the failure and its all part of human nature.

You also know there is a lot of false praise when it comes to being a celebrity. In the past when you were being interviewed on television, you had to say what other people wanted you to say and couldn't reveal your true self. Often times when being interviewed for a magazine you may stretch from the character of Joaquin and give more insight to who you are as a person, but in the end, they are going to print what they want to print and you probably don't get to approve the final copy since I am sure that's the job of a publicist. Normal conversations with regular people are probably something you are probably lacking, because most people are going to treat you as someone special, not based on your merit as a person. I can imagine that its also very difficult to feel that relationships are real, not to say that the relationships with your friends in the film aren't close to being real, just that most probably treat you as a celebrity in one sense or another and you really can't fault them, its simply the way of the world.

All passionate people go through something exactly like what you went through, (the ups the downs, the triumphs and the heartbreaks), not on the same scale because you are a famous person and it happened in a world that you are accustomed, but they all go through something like your rang of emotions. Metaphorically speaking, It's almost like you met a girl that you really liked, she seemed interested and you fell head over heals in love with her. You started making plans, assuming things were mutual and you pushed too hard and too fast. >>> continued in comments section>>>>",1306281600,2,32537,4.362735381565907

4240261,4,B00406UK00,"I found this ""documentary"" on Netflix one night.  I wasn't really sure what to think or expect at first. My initial thought was, `this is going to be more than a silly mockumentary and rather an exploitative documentary of a train wreck'.

I don't really keep up with Hollywood's comings and goings, so I never really heard about Joaquin's career change from the paparazzi entertainment media outlets. I was pretty familiar with Joaquin as an actor from films like: To Die For, U Turn, Clay Pigeons, Gladiator, and Walk the Line. I've always liked the roles Joaquin has played and thought this was a surprising and daring turn for him as an academy award nominee.

Upon watching the film I was thoroughly entertained by the so called ""real"" Joaquin Phoenix. One scene in particular where Joaquin is reading over a script with Ben Stiller comes to mind. In this scene Joaquin calls out Ben Stiller for not separating himself from his characters. Stiller says something along the lines of, ""This is the real me. I'm not playing a character."" Shortly thereafter, Joaquin insults Stiller's comedies for making puns about cats in full-body casts. Joaquin then starts to crack up and says, ""That is pretty funny!"" Stiller and his friend are laughing as well at Joaquin's observation, but not at their recollection of how comical the scene Joaquin is referring to was, but rather at the fact that Joaquin confused the dog in `Something About Mary' for a cat. I find this scene was the best summation of the film in retrospect. Throughout `I'm Still Here' the viewer finds themselves entertained by Joaquin, but by different reasons than he pretends to presume or realize.

I don't doubt that this film was a sick joke,  la Andy Kaufman.  Joaquin has totally immersed himself in this ""role"" (if you can call it that) and it is believable. You can't help but feel compassion for him through this exploration of quasi-sadomasochistic defilement of his persona.

This film shows us the vicious nature of exploitative documentation, a style many of us have become accustomed to. The film also shows us how difficult Hollywood can be on entertainers and how it perpetuates the downfall of stardom; that is, whenever the opportunity presents itself.",1293926400,2,2235,4.912466843501326

Yeah it's weak in some parts, but what film in the 21st Century (so far,) does not come with some weak spots? This is after all a long movie, and probably some aspects could have been reduced in length and or cut. I don't think people who have not worked in this environment before will really understand this movie. There is a lot going on under the surface, even though some of it looks staged, it still provides that real life impact. I think it will take a number of years before this film is fully appreciated.

Right now, people have this image of Hollywood (right or wrong), and this movie tends to destroy that image.

Personally, I felt this business was all a hoax from the get-go, but the real question is, WAS IT A HOAX - OR WAS THE FINISHED PRODUCT AN ELABORATE COVER-UP?  I'll be honest with you, I enjoyed Joaquin's performance in ""Walk The Line"" - being a somewhat fan of Johnny Cash - but I was never a big Phoenix fan.  That's the problem that I have with this movie.  Though nobody can deny the innate talent that Phoenix has, in my opinion, he (despite his Oscar noms) was not such a big star that this doc would not make you think this could or couldn't be real.  And I guess, in retrospect, this is the hook that made people wonder whether any of this was all real or ficticious to begin with.  That being said, the movie is somewhat entertaining, but I honestly feel that it would have been more widely accepted had the audience been in on the joke to begin with.  As a piece of performance art, I guess you could say that this is alright.  I'm not disappointed to have spent money on this.  As a mockumentary, I think the box office totals speak for themselves.  At the end of the day, I can only say to Joaquin Phoenix and Casey Affleck, ""hey, you got my 20 bucks, and I have no problem with that, but please, if you do this again, don't show so much male frontal nudity"".  Okay, now I've gotten that out of the way, gentlemen, go back to making real movies.  I participated in this experiment with you (since I paid for it), but in the end I am left feeling less than satisfied.  On second thought, hit this one up on Redbox.  Oh yeah, I'm going to be nasty now - one of the guys in the commentary sounds like Chris Griffin from ""Family Guy"".  Sorry to make fun of people with speech impediments.",1292889600,,1805,4.252199413489736
4240264,4,B00406UK00,"I know it's not much of a compliment to say that Joachin Phoenix is utterly convincing as a petulant, self-deluded ***hole, but that's my verdict. It turns out that Phoenix and Casey Affleck staged this whole thing, and I suppose the triumph of it is that it doesn't ***look*** staged. Every cringe-inducing moment seemed convincing enough to me. Phoenix is, of course, playing with our perception of him. When you think about it, it's utterly rediculous that Phoenix would want to give up acting to become a rapper. However, when you think of high-profile celebrity wigouts such as what Britney Spears went through not that long ago, it isn't all that implausible that, fed enough drugs, money and gratuitous praise, someone like Phoenix could ***get it in his head*** that maybe his true calling is rap music. Stranger things have happened in real life. So the premise is just plausible enough to keep you wondering whether Phoenix is or isn't faking it, and after awhile he's embarrassed himself to such a degree that you figure no one would take a ""joke"" far enough to have the kind of disastrous results we see here. But Phoenix and Afflek do exactly that. I wouldn't call the finished product entirely enjoyable. Thought provoking, yes. Occasionally disgusting, yes. But enjoyable? I don't know, but that could be the whole point. I suppose this film works as a kind of twisted commentary on both celebrity and also the way ""reality"" is fed to us as entertainment. It's as if Phoenix has created the worst possible version of himself he and his collaborators could imagine, and run with the character. Maybe he succeeded too well, since the reception to this film hasn't exactly been celebration and acclaim. However, I have a feeling ""I'm Still Here"" could be a bit ahead of it's time. At the moment the very concept, never mind the excecution, is too jarring, but I think that in the future we're in for more films that consciously blur the line between fact and fiction, in which case ""I'm Still Here"" may eventually make more sense to more people. All in all, I have to give Phonenix and Affleck credit for sticking their creative necks out. You're probably more likely to hate this film than love it, but it does what it sets out to do. They pulled off the illusion of Phoenix destroying his professional life and coming far too close for comfort to losing his sanity. Once again, I don't know if this is a compliment or what, but I kind of want to see Phoenix's next movie just to make sure he's really all right. So maybe I'm slow, but for awhile there they sure had me fooled.",1292803200,5,2590,4.669584245076586

His character represents the arrogance of hollywood, and the abrupt descent to insanity that has nearly become a platitude in circles of fame. Phoenix made a bold move by acting under his own name, and it proved tremendously powerful. The philosophical gravity of the experiment is profound, and its implications on social identity. I believe this film has been sorely mistaken as a 'lost, self indulging' feature. I think it is the exact opposite, a truly artistic act made for the purpose of artistic advancement.",1292544000,4,605,5.247422680412371

STARRING: Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck, Antony Langdon and Sean Combs

WRITTEN BY: Joaquin Phoenix and Casey Affleck

DIRECTED BY: Casey Affleck

Rated: R
Genre: Comedy
Release Date: 10 September 2010
Review Date: 26 November 2010

I'm Still Here was an interesting and entertaining film, but poses a somewhat difficult scenario when one sits down to write a review of it. Do you disclose it as the comedy that it is, or do you play along with the notion that it's a documentary so as not to ruin the surprise for the unsuspecting? I choose to reveal it as a comedy; don't ask me why - just do. Well - maybe I don't want folks to think Phoenix is a freaking whack-job. Because not knowing this film is in fact a `movie' rather than a documentary, would cause you to believe just that.

Joaquin Phoenix IS still here, folks, and he remains a very talented actor and could find himself nominated for his third Oscar, for his brilliant performance in a dramatized and very much comedic portrayal of himself.

When I read Roger Ebert's review I was as puzzled, as I imagine he was when watching the film; because it wasn't obvious at first if he was leading the readers on by claiming the film was real, or if he did in fact buy into it. I had the luxury of already being keen to the fact that it was all a `hoax', where as Ebert took the film as real as could be. He writes, ""If this film turns out to still be part of an elaborate hoax, I'm going to be seriously pissed.""

Well, sorry to disappoint you, Ebe. Ebert offers no explanation as to why he would be `seriously pissed' and I can only guess that it's because he made it so clear in his review, that the film was real - that to discover it was not, would prove him wrong. He too gave the film a favorable review, but he must have left in a hurry and not waited around to see the immediate credit that said: written and produced by Joaquin Phoenix and Casey Affleck.  I'm not knocking on the guy, I love his work; I just find some mild amusement in the situation.

I'm Still Here shows us Joaquin Phoenix and the supposed life he lives. Drugs, hookers, depression, a stench-induced lack of self confidence matched evenly with a case of bad hygiene. No longer finding any personal gratification in his talented craft of acting, Phoenix has decided to throw in the towel in an effort to become a rap star.

I liked the film, but it lacked in a few areas, the biggest being an understanding of why he wanted to be a rapper. But then again, I suppose that's the appeal to the character version of himself that he is playing. It's explained why he is done with acting - but even Phoenix doesn't quite seem to know why he wants to rap.

In actuality, there are a lot of things he seems to be unsure of in his life, and this is where a majority of the laughs come from. I'm very curious to know how much of the dialogue was scripted, because it's very good and flawlessly presented to us through the acting. I imagine a great deal of it was improvised. My favorite line that Phoenix delivers is, ""I'd like a f***ing joint... and to be anywhere other than Washington f***ing DC... but life is not a CHRISTMAS, day.""

Some of it had to be improvised, as we see Phoenix on David Letterman, and talking with other celebrities ranging from Ben Stiller and Bruce Willis to Jack Nicholson and Mos Def; all of whom are not in on the film. They think the Phoenix they are talking to is the real deal.

And thus my hat is off to Mr. Phoenix. Much like Sacha Baron Cohen in last year's hilarious Bruno, Phoenix only had one shot to nail his performance when in a scene with these celebrities, if the film was going to work. If he cracked up or broke character, the entire film could have been tarnished.

He also doesn't have a colorful character like Bruno or Borat to hide behind; he's putting HIMSELF out there, and it is truly amazing to see how dedicated he was to the project when you look at the grand scheme of it all. He carried on this persona for at the very least, several months on end and the press ate it up, indulging in the opportunity to make a laughing stock of him.

Some of the most entertaining scenes in the film that also display his improvisational skills the best, are when he meets with Sean Combs in an effort to have an album produced. Like the other celebrities in the film, Combs is not aware that Phoenix is acting. He sees the cameras, yes, but is told only that Phoenix is doing a documentary on his life. These scenes are gold, and are among the best in the film. Combs is a very unique individual, and Phoenix plays his weirdness at full volume around him, and we are rolling.

It's not blindingly clear to me why Casey Affleck and Joaquin Phoenix decided to make this film, nor what the point of it really is, other than to be entertaining and make people laugh now that it's all out in the open and exposed as a joke. But maybe it's just as simple as that, and if so - great. If not, then who cares? That mentality seems to hang in the air of the film anyways, now that I think about it.

If you are concerned that Phoenix won't be acting anymore, you can relax. You need only to watch a six minute special feature on the DVD or Blu-Ray to hear from his own lips that he enjoyed doing this movie, and loves acting very much, and will always act.

I'm eager to see what he does next and I'd also like to mention that I think perhaps Phoenix is playing a grown up version of that troubled young man we saw him play in Ron Howard's classic, Parenthood. As a fan and a human being, I hope that's somewhat the case, and that in his real life, he's not into drugs and hookers.",1292025600,2,5662,4.279700654817587
4240268,1,B00406UK00,"I personally feel that this was not a hoax, that this was literally some idiots' rantings and ravings. I use to like this guy, not now and not ever again. He acts like a little bratty kid who has had his candy taken away by the school bully. If this was a joke then why would someone self mutilate their career like this? Either way, the only thing this movie accomplished for me was to make me despise him. I hope that he does get out of acting because after this film I do not have any desire to see him on the big screen again.",1291593600,5,530,4.009433962264151
4240269,3,B00406UK00,"...and it probably succeeds on that level, showcasing how tabloid rags, and even corporate-owned news media, can create celebrity out of nothing:  Anna Nicole Smith, Paris Hilton, Dr. Phil, Jon and Kate Gosselin, Kim Kardashian, Paula Dean, Sarah and Bristol Palin, Levi Johnston - the list goes on and on.  This fake live-cam of Joaquin Phoenix is like spending the night at a meth party, and is more stupid than funny.  Casey Affleck is a little late trying to sell this kind of thing - Sacha Baron Cohen has already milked it to the max (and with far more humor).  The sublime intellectuality of the hip-hop biz, and some raunchy and grotesque bits, are the definite highlights.",1290816000,,681,4.794871794871795
4240270,4,B00406UK00,If you go into this movie knowing that it was all a hoax then I'm sure you'll find the hilarity in it all. I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times because it's so completely laughable with some memorable one-liners. The best part of the movie was everyone's reactions to Joaquin's crazy antics. I know what Joaquin is capable of since he has remarkable other roles but it was still an enjoyable and comical watch. I'll leave the better directing to Ben instead of Casey.,1290470400,2,481,4.540229885057471
4240271,5,B00406UK00,"I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to see this film.  I'd heard weird things, seen Joaquin's ""behavior"" on David and everything else.  So, as I found myself mesmerized while watching this film, I could not believe what I was seeing.  This was an amazingly brave thing for Joaquin to do and I must say that he was absolutely brilliant.  Casey did a superb job of editing and filming and directing.  Both men were doing something no one else has done or probably ever will again.  If you can't look at it as performance art, then perhaps you do not really know good filmmaking when you see it.  As I said, it was funny in places, it was very sad, it was disgusting but it was all acting and it was brilliantly done on all fronts.  In my opinion, I think that people who are not accepting of it are uncomfortable with it because it is all laid out bare,  we can all see ourselves and what goes on in those parts of our psyche that we do not wish to ever let anyone else see.  We are all mad and depraved, in some sense, and we all have our vulnerabilities.  These we hide in our own little corners of our minds because we couldn't bear to be outcast or think of as crazy.  This is true and if anyone dismisses that notion, I suggest you sit alone with yourself and ask yourself what it is that you think about or do that is just too hard to share.  This film shares it all in a raw and sometimes uncomfortable manner but we must ask ourselves WHY we are uncomfortable...again, sit quietly and ask yourself that question.  I'd recommend this film to any serious film buff, not the ones who are superficially interested in films but can really see and hear what the character is about.  I'll buy the film and watch it many times.  And, I'm sure I will come away with something new each time.
Brilliantly done and kudos to Joaquin, one of our finest cinema stars today.  In any part he plays, he becomes that person.  It is not Joaquin Phoenix we are watching.  It is whomever he is playing the part of.  In each movie Julia Roberts does, she is playing a part but she is still always Julia Roberts.  She has to do that huge overworked smile and laugh no matter who she is in the film.  It's that way with most actors.  Leo DiCaprio becomes the person, not Leo.  Brad Pitt becomes the person, not Brad. More are like that, Eastwood, Natalie Portman, Kate Beckinsale, Scarlett Johannsen, Robert Duval, Robert DeNiro..those are actors who become the character and abandon their own personal persona, unlike for instance, Ms. Roberts.  In this case, as with all his films, this is a character and not merely Joaquin Phoenix.  That is the difference between a great actor and a good actor ie: Ms. Roberts or Ms. Aniston (don't get me wrong, I enjoy most of her movies) and the majority of actors today.
Don't  let this film pass you by if you truly do understand filmmaking and character portrayal.",1288656000,4,2898,4.378277153558052

8412170,3,B00406UK00,"Depressing is how I will sum it up. Sure it starts out funny if you're like me and knew it was supposed to be sort of a hoax movie. By the end though I felt depressed and so cannot recommend this movie. The movie begins and ends with these strange and awkward scenes of him in a river.  Then, throughout the movie there is unnecessary nudity(him ordering and having sex with supposed prostitutes, us having to see his assistant's genitals), chain-smoking, drinking and cursing. It's extremely long and while you will have moments that are funny, it becomes painful to watch sometimes throughout this strangely long movie. I will say that when it was over I felt depressed and had to rush and watch a comedy. Joaquin is such a gifted actor and a handsome man from a family we can all agree on is blessed looks and talent-wise, I hope this movie is not real. if it is, I hope he has passed such a stage in his life.",1459468800,,913,4.370588235294117
