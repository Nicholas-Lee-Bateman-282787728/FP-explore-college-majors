2799830,3,B000OUWM0C,"I rented this movie on Amazon Instant Video. I've seen the movie before and was watching it to satisfy a Bollywood craving.

The movie itself is about a family with three sons and a daughter. The first two hours are really happy and full of songs and dancing. The last hour is the family drama hour.

Giving this three stars because the quality of the video is pretty bad. The image was not clear and the audio sounded a little muffled at times.

There were no subtitles for most of the songs.",1357430400,,493,4.336956521739131

2799833,1,B000OUWM0C,"Had family over and we thought it might be a ""cute"" movie. But it turned out to be unbearably bad. Cheezy with bad acting. Couldn't watch after 20 mins.",1346889600,,152,4.275862068965517
2799834,3,B000OUWM0C,Its a nice family film about an old fashion father and mother who want there kids to live togather. The films has some great songs and a great story about unity among brothers/Sisters. The second half of the film is just a bunch of crying due to the mother being Manipulated by her friends. I usually only watch the first half of the film. the second half is just depressing.,1341792000,,375,4.371428571428571
2799835,3,B000OUWM0C,"First off let me just say this is a cute movie , pretty much american 1950'S style with no inappropriate scenes of any kind. Family friendly. Having said that I will go one further and say the acting was very sweet and the dance and little travel scenes very nice. Problem: if you are becoming a huge fan of Bollywood and you love not only the new shows(ones with plot or are fun) but these cute old cheese style ones , how on earth can you really figure out subtleties when 3/4 of the movie is singing and THE SONGS ARE NOT SUBTITLED AT ALL. There is only about one hours worth total of movie without singing and dancing and IF YOU DON'T SPEAK OR READ HINDI HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO RECOMMEND A 3 HOUR MOVIE. I am a lover of romance movies so I stuck with it but I just had to keep fast forwarding to the dialogue after a few minutes oF what the heck are they saying mode....HUGE MISTAKE. That is a real shame because the actors all do a fine job. DEFINITELY NEED TO RELOOP THIS ONE WITH SUBTITLES FOR THE SONGS.",1331769600,4,1009,4.126903553299492
2799836,5,B000OUWM0C,"I really love this movie, it is one of my favorite hindi movies. It is family-based and has great characters, great songs, a strong sense of morals, eye catching sets and clothing. I like that this movie doesnt contain violence, lude scenes etc. I highly recommend if you tend to like a more traditional hindi movie experience (like many movies from the 90's such as Hum Aapke Hain kaun), with a large talented cast. This movie is strongly based on positive interactions within an extended family and leaves you feeling good in the end.",1326067200,5,536,4.712765957446808
2799837,3,B000OUWM0C,"""Hum Saath-Saath Hain"" is reminiscent of some of the other family-centered Hindi dramas of the 1990s, such as ""Hum Aapke Hain Kaun"", and it preceded the very popular ""Khabi Khushi Khabhie Gham"", which deals with similar themes.  These themes are family unity; obedience to parents; loyalty to siblings; and the potential for family erosion when doubt and suspicion creep in.

The family at the core of this film is comprised of mother, father, and three sons who all live happily together and work for the prosperous family business (there's also a daughter, but she's already married and therefore lives with her husband's family).  The family functions according to a strict but loving hierarchy, in which the eldest son Vivek (Mohnish Behl) marries first and is set to inherit the top position in the family firm; the second son Prem (Salman Khan) is sent abroad to study so that he can also join the company; and the youngest son Vinod (Saif Ali Khan) is mischievous but always looks up to his elder brothers.

The first two hours of this three hour film are without any major family strife or drama - the focus is on the daily functioning of the family and the pairing off of each brother with his respective sweetheart.  Vivek, Prem and Vinod all get engaged in turn as the couples sing, dance, and bat their eyelashes at each other over the course of two hours.  When Preeti bakes sweets for Prem (his favorite sweets, of course!), that counts as high drama.  If the intricacies of life in an extended family hold no interest for you, then you will likely be bored to tears. If, however, you enjoy delicate flirtations and the visual feast that is Hindi cinema, then it will be a pleasant two hours.

The twist doesn't come until the final hour.  When the daughter of the family experiences some difficulties in her husband's home, the mother becomes paranoid that a similar schism will occur in her own family, carefully balanced as it is between three brothers and their three wives-to-be. In a moment of doubt, the mother causes the very schism she's afraid of, but under the pretense of protecting her two younger sons from the power of the elder (who's also only their half-brother).  I'm not giving away anything shocking when I say that all will be resolved in the end, since the very foundation of this film is the idea that family bonds should never be broken, and this family in particular is unbreakable.

All of the actors turn in fine performances; surprisingly, no one actor is the star over any other.  Salman Khan plays the shy, gentle brother and as such his performance is more subdued than usual. Mohnish Behl is great as the always-responsible, noble elder brother and Saif Ali Khan is credible as the playful, responsibility-dodging youngest brother.  The three women (Tabu, Sonali Bendre, and Karishma Kapoor) are lovely, but they don't have much scope for nuance in their roles; they are all dutiful, loving women who act appropriately and obediently.  Not much room for drama in such idealized characterizations.

In summary: watch this film if you enjoy family-centered Hindi dramas with delicate romance and lots of agonizing over the social rules of family life.",1305504000,7,3196,4.8385321100917436
2799838,2,B000OUWM0C,"This is about the trials and tribulations of a multigenerational family.
We found it disengaging and rather tedious. It went on and on without getting far at the beginning and we started skipping scenes to see if it picked up. In the end we abandoned it.
I'd hoped for more from a movie with Saif Ali Khan, Salman Khan & Karisma Kapoor but this was 1999 and I guess it wasn't among their better stuff. The music and dance was ho-hum and unmemorable too.
Elsewhere on the Net it scores average. However it was below average for us and not a keeper.",1242259200,4,547,4.372549019607843

2799880,2,B000OUWM0C,"I was looking forward to seeing this film  , partly because I am becoming  a  Salman  Khan  fan. Usually I watch a Bollywood film because of the ladies. Kareena , Rani , Katrina , or Aishwarya . This movie is one of the older movies , and was starting out a little slow , but the picture was so blurry and low -defined ( if that's a word ) that was irritating to watch. I may come back to this film later , but for now I'm going back to the newer releases that have a much clearer picture  for my entertainment. I wasn't going to give a comment because I couldn't really comment on what I couldn't see , but sometimes Amazon pesters you 'til you finally give up and comment , so I gave up .",1404086400,,690,3.963768115942029

2799891,5,B000OUWM0C,"Hum Saath Saath Hain is honest, straight-from-the heart story telling! Watching it after a decade it was released just re-affirms ones belief in a family.
Highlights of the movie:
 Families are meant to stay together and there is a place for everyone if each member is aware
 Respect has to be given where it is due
 If you are blessed with decent parents  honor them, not everyone is blessed in this way
 A celebration is a wonderful way to bring the entire family together
 It is not always right to rebel
This movie has a bevy of stars - Monish Bahl, Tabu, Salman Khan, Sonali Bendre, Saif Ali Khan, Karishma Kapoor and a host of other supporting characters. Beautiful songs and great dances  this was a truly enjoyable movie.",1385596800,,729,4.604651162790698

The  characters  are  perfectly chosen  for  each role.  The  'drama'  or  'trauma'  as I call it  is  inevitable!  But,  as  in  every movie  it makes  you  cry and  then  makes us  anxiously  wait  for  the  'happy ending' .  The  dancing  is  beyond  dreaming.  The Karisma Kapoor in ""Maiya Yashoda""  is  outstanding.  So  get  the  movie.  Enjoy  it beyond  words.",1380412800,,490,4.7105263157894735
