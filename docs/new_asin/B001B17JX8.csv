Good explanation for the muscles he was working on.",1507680000,,410,4.466666666666667
8281244,5,B001B17JX8,Extremely helpful.  Always good to have so I can sit and watch when I want in my home in peace.,1503014400,,95,3.75
8281245,5,B001B17JX8,Perfect video for anyone interested in exploring massage therapy. The instructor is very knowledgeable of the human body using scientific muscle notation. He has an abundance of experience within the field that is shared throughout the video. He gives tips on different ways to massage the muscles for different comfort levels for both therapist and client. It is very easy to watch. Given there is an actual person receiving the massage. Offers simple explainations to better understanding of risks.,1476144000,,500,5.341772151898734
8281246,5,B001B17JX8,I have alway given massage to my family and friends for the past 4 years after my wife developed some issue with her back and I could afford to send her to the massage therapist every other day.  I never charged anyone but I have has become so requested that I desisted that I could makes so money at this. I have a table and I got a few books and some videos for training so I could bone up on some skills if I was going to charge.  After a month of research I believe this version and the others from the same company have been the best resource that I have found.  I have a good client base now that pay and I have to turn people down every week because I just don't have the time. This is a great video that will help you learn those few tricks that really make the difference.,1473724800,,781,3.961783439490446
8281247,5,B001B17JX8,"This has been great for my clients with limited range of motion in their upper body. I have around 6 I'm working with right now that can barely turn their neck, and using the things I've learned with this dvd, so far 4 of them have almost gained full range of motion after a month or two of steady massages(2 a month).

It teaches the importance of working the pecs, which I like. They always need work! The dvd is very easy to learn from. I like to recruit another massage therapist/friend so I can follow along while learning, it's just the best way to do things. That way, the therapist can give me valuable feedback so that I know what my clients will be experiencing when I do certain techniques.

I have purchased all 3 of Meade Steadman's Deep Tissue Massage and like them all, I recommend getting them as a set.",1444521600,2,819,4.34640522875817
8281248,5,B001B17JX8,"This massage DVD is awesome and very detailed I am very happy I purchased it, I will be looking at more of Meade Steadman's DVDs. Can't wait to take one of his classes!",1415491200,,168,4.121212121212121
8281249,5,B001B17JX8,"Unfunny story - I had maybe a year's experience and didn't know very many deep tissue techniques.  Well I had a client royally complain about my deep tissue massage so I had a fire lit under my toosh to learn.  So I bought a DVD - this one.  It's really helped my practice at the spa and with private clients.  I've added some PNF techniques to complement the ones I learned in this DVD to really help release people's shoulders.  There are a couple techniques in the DVD that I don't use, but overall I use most of them.  Clients experience little discomfort and lots of tension release.",1343779200,3,588,4.398148148148148
