8738330,2,B0178N34A4,"I bought several of these Common Core Sight Words DVDs for the library where I am the children's librarian.  I am underwhelmed by them.  A woman stands there and says each word three times.  Then the word is used in a sentence, and then repeated three more times.  The DVD lasts about ten minutes.  There is nothing fun or appealing about the presentation, which would make a child want to join in, or watch it a second time.  This might be okay to borrow from a library, especially for homeschoolers, but I wouldn't recommend buying, especially since it is rather expensive for something so low-key and short.  I won't waste anymore of my limited DVD library budget on this series.",1466208000,,682,4.633333333333334
