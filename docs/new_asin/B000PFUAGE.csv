8191045,5,B000PFUAGE,Trick Or Treat is the best movie ever. I was 12 when that movie came out and I had to wait till it came on video. The Video tape broke down in 2016 so I found this DVD seems to show a clear picture then the tape did.  I even watched Slaugter House Of The Rising Sun and all I can say was OMG how insane but cool!,1480809600,,312,3.588235294117647

8191048,3,B000PFUAGE,"""Trick or Treat"" is a fun movie for those who like heavy metal from the 1980's. I would say it's a cult classic. The other movie is a low budget flick that is not good. Totally worth it for one movie.",1351382400,4,200,3.902439024390244
8191049,5,B000PFUAGE,"great old school movie for people from this generation, great sound track, classic hair metal, for the time the movie was made.",1346544000,3,127,4.818181818181818
8191050,5,B000PFUAGE,"If you are 40 y.o or older and you lived the 80's heavy metal era, you will love to watch, you again this again.

Perfect!!!!!

The other movie? I don't care... Maybe I will watch one day. Trick or Treat worth the full price. And it gives you a good tip: Never play your records backwards. :)

Heavy Metal till Die.",1332028800,6,315,4.131147540983607
