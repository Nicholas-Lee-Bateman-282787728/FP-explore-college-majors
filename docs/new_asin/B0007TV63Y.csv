2244002,3,B0007TV63Y,"My FIRM 5 day Abs (from the early 90s?) video finally broke, so I decided to try something new.

The workouts are okay, but only a couple exercises really work your abs long enough for you to feel it.  I think the problem is that they only do a couple reps of each exercise.

I'm still looking for a DVD that has 3-5 days of ab workouts that are challenging... I may just buy the FIRM again.",1134000000,8,391,4.0519480519480515
2244003,2,B0007TV63Y,"I go to abs classes frequently and wanted to get this DVD to help mix up my routine and give me something to do if I didn't want to leave the house.  I was a little disappointed in this DVD.  I love Self Magazine and their workouts and the amazon reviews made it seem very promising.  The routines are broken down into four separate workouts.  The only one that involved any effort on my part was the Pilates-inspired section.  As for the rest, the other sections would have you do too few reps, I felt, to get your muscles warmed up, let alone reshape them.  I think this DVD is great for beginners.  Its simple enough to follow and it won't scare you away too soon.  But if you're like me and you workout on a regular basis and just want a new routine, this probably isn't the abs workout for you.",1131062400,32,799,4.2105263157894735
2244004,5,B0007TV63Y,"I love ab work and I've been a fan of Violet Zaki since Crunch's ""Cardio Sculpt"" so I had high expectations for this workout. It did not disappoint me.

The workout begins with a warm-up that includes standing ab work with a dumbbell. Standing work is my least favorite approach to abs, but I thoroughly enjoy this routine.

The second series is stability ball with a variety of standing and floor exercises. I especially like the reverse crunches with the ball held between your legs. I can really feel it working my lower abs.

Both the warm-up and the stability ball sections include some lunges. Lunges usually bother my knees, but I haven't had any trouble with these sections, maybe because they are moderately-paced or held, stationary lunges.

The next series is pilates. I'm not a pilates expert but I love that the exercises here are a bit different such as leg circles with both legs. I find this version easier to do effectively and can really feel it in my abs, much more so than the usual single leg circles. I love that the bicycle twist is done slowly and held to a count of four. For an ab lover like myself this is candy... but it's also a more effective way to do this exercise.

The last series of exercises is yoga-based. It includes plank and side plank work, an interesting combo of boat with toe taps, and some cobra and locust inspired back work. There's one delicious side stretch with your legs tucked to one side where you raise one arm and slowly bring it down and thread it through your supporting arm that I just love. It's simple, feel-good elements like this that, for me, make the workout fly by.

I used to skip the cool down but have since realized that it's so short there's no reason to not do it. It's just a few minutes of simple twists and stretches.

The workout is filmed on a beach with two background exercisers. One shows modifications. From warm-up through cool down is about 27 minutes with the chapters running about 6 minutes each (the cool down is shorter). There's also a bonus cardio segment but I've never done it so I can't comment on it. The chaptering allows you to do one or more sections but I've found that once I get started I don't want to stop. It's a good 25 minutes of lower intensity, non-traditional ab work. If you're the type of exerciser who likes the fast-paced crunches you get with a Cathe or Firm workout then this DVD may not be for you. But if you're looking for a fun and effective way to work your abs I can't think of anything better.

Perhaps I have a thing for Aussie accents (I'm a big Keli Roberts fan too) but I just love Violet Zaki. She looks fit and beautiful in a healthy, natural way. And she has a calm energy that is encouraging without being distracting. There's only one point in the workout where her cuing falters, at least that I've noticed, when she simply says ""again"" and doesn't add ""on the other side."" Once you know the routine, it's no big deal. I wish she'd put out more workouts.",1130112000,11,2984,4.442413162705667
2244005,4,B0007TV63Y,"Self has created a strong sexy progressive workout to take you through a variety of exercises that will quickly tone your abs. The stability ball is not essential if you adapt those exercises with an exercise ring or just skip leaning on the ball and do the exercises on the floor. A set of weights and a mat are needed to complete the exercises.

Stretching is interspersed throughout the workout and it gives you a much needed rest between the more intense exercises. The exercises are taught well and then the instructor quickly raises the intensity. The addition of weights and raising the arms takes this workout to an intermediate to advanced routine.

Strong graceful moves make each exercise super efficient. The variety keeps your interest and there are creative adaptations for familiar exercises. Advice is given on how to stabilize your neck and the warm-up helps you to ease into the movements.

Routine:

Warming Up
Stability Ball
Pilates Abs
Yoga Abs
Cooldown

I think they could have made this much more adaptable because they have three women working out and there are few modifications for beginners. This is mostly an intermediate to advanced workout with an emphasis on Yoga stretching and Pilates conditioning.

I felt like I was only working out for about 15 minutes, so this seems to go fast and the creativity kept my attention. The wonderful beach setting is relaxing and healing.

If you are at the advanced level, you may think this is 5 stars for the balance challenges.

2244006,4,B0007TV63Y,"There's lots of variety in this video.  It's 4 six minute sections.  The 1st section is standing exercises, the 2nd section is with the stability ball, the 3rd section is pilates inspired exercises and the 4th section is yoga based.  I liked that there was a short warm-up before the workout.  Also, there's a short stretch after each section.  The instruction was very clear and the beach setting was great.  I was a little disappointed with the stability ball section.  I was hoping for more exercises ON the ball.  The only exercise on the ball was crunches.  The other exercises are WITH the ball - sweeping it to the side, holding it between your knees.  They are very effective exercises, it just wasn't what I expected.  Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.",1125964800,2,775,4.708955223880597
2244007,5,B0007TV63Y,"This workout kicks butt.  It's quite tough but it will really help you out if you also do cardio five days a week.  There are some new moves and old moves but it's interesting, challenging and there is an amazing backdrop (set live on a beach).

2244009,5,B0007TV63Y,"This is by far the best ab workout DVD I have found.  I especiall love the ""pilates"" abs section.  The moves really work your abdominal muscles, but are still easy enough for an intermediate person like myself.  I found it challenging, but not overwhelming.

I have definitely seen results in my ""love handles"" and upper abs!  I do this DVD 3-4 times a week, and it goes by SO fast!

Awesome abs workout!

P.S.  The girls do seem to smile a bit much though....how can you smile so big while your abs are BURNING!!!  haha",1120867200,19,520,4.389473684210526
2244010,4,B0007TV63Y,"Self: Firm Flat Abs Fast! is a sculpting workout that is just shy of 30 minutes in length.  On the DVD there is also a bonus cardio workout--at 5 minutes it's really only suitable as a warm-up. You'll need one 3 to 8 pound dumbbell and a stability ball.

This workout is broken up into four chapters, which can be done independently of one another.  The first chapter is just classic crunches--very familiar to just about everyone.  The second chapter incorporates the stability ball.  The first few moves of this chapter aren't for exercisers with low ceilings, but they should be easy to modify.  The third chapter is Pilates-inspired ab work.  The fourth chapter includes some very graceful yoga-inspired moves.  There is also a short cool-down segment at the end. None of the moves in this workout are mindblowingly new or different--they're all good solid well-tested moves packaged into one workout.

Violet Zaki, the instructor, discusses the workout before the warmup (you can fast-forward through that) and then at the end she has a rather long section discussing proper form and diet and how both contribute to better fitness.  The diet advice is pretty common sense stuff, but it never hurts to hear it one more time.

The setting is absolutely gorgeous. The workout filmed on the beach at a resort near Puerto Vallarta.  You can hear the waves crashing on the beach in the background, which is very calming.  As an instructor, Violet is very motivating. She cues well and keeps the patter (and the whooping) to a bare minimum. There are two backup exercisers, one of which is modifying. They are very ""normal"" looking--trim and fit without being overly lean. Violet looks strong and healthy.

The only thing I've found to give this DVD demerits on are the five or six commercials at the beginning. You can fast foward through them (or hit the Menu button) but still--I paid for my DVD and I don't feel like paying more for it by giving my time to these ads. It's why I only rated this DVD 4 stars.  Without the ads, it's a 5 star DVD with beautiful production values and good chaptering.

As a high-intermediate/low-advanced exerciser, I think this one is worth picking up as an add-on or for light days. I can definitely feel it in my abs after I do this workout, but I have yet to experience any DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) from it.  I would recommend this workout to just about any level of exerciser--if you do this workout, eat right, and get in regular cardiovascular exercise, you will definitely see results.",1118016000,92,2537,4.742596810933941
2244011,2,B0007TV63Y,"This is a good video for ab workout basics. Not great if you aren't a beginner. It requires a lot of equipment, too.",1280448000,,116,4.086956521739131
2244012,3,B0007TV63Y,I put myself at an intermediate level of fitness.  I have always liked this instructor a lot but I feel that her workouts are geared more towards beginners.  I need a more challenging routine to feel that I got a good workout.  I gave this three stars since I would recommend this to a beginner but would prefer they 1) give a title that is more descriptive about level the routine is geared for and 2) why don't they put the instructor on the cover with these self dvds?,1247011200,,471,4.269662921348314
2244013,4,B0007TV63Y,"This DVD workout is app. 28 minutes long including warm-up, 4 toning sections & cool-down.  There is an introduction at the beginning as well as a fairly lengthy postlude about diet and other tips for a healthy lifestyle.  There is also a short (app. 5 minute) cardio workout that you can select from the main menu.  If you put all of these together, you come up with the 45 minute length on the video.

The warm-up is very short, but adequate and then you move directly into standing crunch moves with 1 dumbbell.  Section 2 is with a stability ball, section 3 is pilates-inspired exercises and section 4 is yoga-inspired.  Each section is about 6 minutes long so there are not a lot of different exercises or repetitions, but I felt that the workout was still a good one.  I feel that, regardless of your level of fitness, you can get something out of this workout.  For beginners, one of the instructors does modifications, for an advanced workout, you can follow Violet, the lead instructor as she always does moves deeper, longer and more completely than the others.

The instructor was upbeat and encouraging without being obnoxious and had a great body.  The scenery was beautiful and the music was adequate.  I liked this workout because I did not really feel a huge strain while I was doing the workout, but I did feel a bit of soreness afterwards.  I also liked that there were few actual crunches in the workout and that the workout ended with the yoga section so that you get a nice cool down with stretching at the end.

My main complaint with the DVD is that I hate fast-forwarding through commercials and introductions on workout DVDs.  Thank goodness this wasn't a video!  The only other thing that I didn't like about this DVD is that most of the exercises focused on the obliques without doing much with my upper or lower abs so I feel that I need to do another DVD in tandem with this one to get a full abs workout.  Also, I feel that that ""fast"" claim in the title is a bit of a misnomer as the instructor tells you that ""if you do this workout 3 or more times a week, you can see results in as little as 4 weeks.""  I understand that getting safe results takes time, but I wouldn't necessarily call 4 weeks fast!  That said, I still recommend this DVD as it is quick, feels easy, contains simple poses & moves and the instructor is clear and easy to follow.",1240531200,,2377,4.43778801843318
2244014,2,B0007TV63Y,"I bought this product hoping for a lot of ab work.  This video focuses on cardio and then brings in some ab work.

2244015,2,B0007TV63Y,"I agree with another reviewer that there were not enough reps on any of the workouts to really feel like I got a workout.  The exercises themselves were good, but not for the more advanced exerciser.  I will look elsewhere for an awesome abs workout.  There is a Stability Ball Abs segment on Kathe Friedrich's Basic Step DVD that is awesome.  I would also reccommend the abs segment on Tamilee Webb's Tight on Time DVD.",1219968000,,420,4.56
2244016,3,B0007TV63Y,"I like the setting of the dvd on a beach a lot but like some people before said, the first two segments (traditional abs and balance ball) didn't really do much for me, there were not enough repetitions. But the yoga and pilates abs were pretty good. With that said, the ""Shape your Abs"" dvd is better in my opinion, because it is way harder. But of course, they don't have the pretty beach scenery.
The cardio workout is hardly a cardio workout, it is more like a warm-up.
There is one thing that is really getting on my nerves, which is the instrucor saying ""uh-huh"" all the time.
But I did like the instructions that were given on proper form and also the tips for healthy eating. I like that Self does not support diets, but healthy eating and tips on losing weight without a severe diet. Their weight loss tips are usually very inspiring.",1211414400,,843,4.410256410256411
2244017,5,B0007TV63Y,"I love this dvd. I viewed it on my netflix, and soon after I decided I had to buy it. I went everywhere (best buy, walmart, circuit city) and couldn't find it. I bought it here on Amazon and I got it today. I am an intermediate/low-advance exerciser, and this workout beat me. I felt ""good pain"" during the pilates workout! I love the ab ball workout! I love this dvd, and I will be doing this 3-4 times a week. I have been exercising for nearly 3 years now, and I haven't been able to achieve a flat stomach so I decided to give this a try.

I seriously hurt in areas of my abs I had forgotten I had the first couple times.  I do Pilates and Yoga classes regularly but this is intense (if you'll follow along) and quick.  I guess if you can already bounce a dime off your abs, it may not be challenging enough, but for Suzi Citizen who is doing her best to be fit and look great in (and out of) her jeans, this DVD rocks.",1204070400,2,495,3.92

As someone with lower back pain, this workout is a godsend because it's almost NO crunch-type exercises!

Make no mistake, these are challenging exercises, if done properly with good form, and precision.

For one - the little cardio section is only about 5 min and my heart rate barely got going.  She states 'come on stay with me' or something like that i was bored already.  The first two parts of the dvd (standing ab work and stability ball work) were the easiest thing i have ever done in my life. I couldn't even feel an ab muscle working at all. I'm NOT an advanced exerciser by any means but that was just a waste of time.  The stability ball dvd that came with my ball was harder than the stability ball part of this dvd.  The Pilates and Yoga section of the dvd did make me actually feel my abs which is the only reason why i gave it 3 stars.  I guess on off days i can do those two sections but i have a feeling this dvd will just collect dust now on the shelf.

I weigh 150 lbs. and am 5'5"" so Im not the skinniest and have had 2 kiddos in last 2 years.
