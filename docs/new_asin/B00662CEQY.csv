4961645,5,B00662CEQY,I loved this series. Thought the  actors were great in their rolls. The price is very reasonable. One to watch over again many times.,1352419200,,133,4.541666666666667
4961646,5,B00662CEQY,"We watched all of these shows on TV years ago starting with Fresh Fields when Hester and William were in England, then French Fields when William got a new job in France.  The show is up-to-date today as it was in the 80s and there are many good laughs in the realistic dialogue.  Great actors, fun to watch and we wish there was more of this clean language, proper programing today.  Great value and we'll play it over every two years till we push up daisies.",1344556800,4,460,4.325581395348837

4961648,5,B00662CEQY,"We used to watch this series on PBS and were delighted when it came out on DVD.  It is a well written and well acted series.  The Brits seem to have a knack for being both funny and satirical.  We have purchased the entire series, including Fresh Fields.  Thanks for the laughs.  It's nice to watch a comedy without bad language and inuendos.",1334793600,17,342,4.365079365079365
4961649,5,B00662CEQY,"Funny mid-life couple in love, not badgering each other. Their day, he an accountant, she (40) on the constant search of new creative outlets. Hester (Julia McKenzie-`Miss Marple' `Cranford') surviveS plots of activity & adventure. William (Anton Rodgers-`Lillie' `Affairs of the Heart') saves the day or plays along. Always a surprise laugh to end each episode. Sonja is a cameo, but son-in-law Peter (Philip Bird) returns as does daughter/wife Emma, but she is played by 2 different gals.
Very family oriented, with some fun play with words on risque topics, and a new French neighbor (Pamela Salem) a sexy gal who used ample episodes to slowly reveal. There's a maid (Valerie Lush) nobody understands--just shake your head, smile, like the cast and move on. Viewers of FRESH FIELDS quickly become enamored with the new cast and Hester's strawberry gray hair. ""FRESH"" London scenes convert to ""FRENCH"" vistas, quite appealing. I would recommend watching Sets one and two of ""FRESH FIELDS"" first, but it is not mandatory to enjoy this complete three year series that is an obvious sequel.

4961660,5,B00662CEQY,"I enjoyed the Fields so much in Fresh Fields, I had to have their continuing series in France. I think it might be even funnier, and more well-written, than their first series. Very very enjoyable! The Fields are just a very amusing couple to spend time with.",1389225600,3,259,4.531914893617022

4961662,5,B00662CEQY,Charming series.  Wish they had it on local television.  Anton Rodgers was priceless on May to December and he is excellent on this series as well.  My wife and I sat through the complete series during two evenings.  It was great and worth every penny.  It is nice to see a comedy with genuine excellent writing where the man does not come across as a complete idiot!,1384473600,4,367,4.417910447761194

Sooooo I'm sure others as well as myself, would just love to know when and if Amazon will EVER get set 3 & 4 to buy without buying the whole thing. Johns Island, SC...

4961666,3,B00662CEQY,"I have enjoyed the original Fresh Fields many times--it is well written and the actors and actresses seem perfect for their parts.  I was lookijg forward to French Fields, but it is not nearly up the standard of the original series.",1355529600,5,232,4.658536585365853

4961668,5,B00662CEQY,"OK, I'm grey haired so maybe younger people won't like this as much as I do, but I think it is very funny and well worth watching for the laughs.  Also, if you took French in school it is fun to hear the language, though, they do not speak much French in this English comedy since it is for English speakers.  For the hard of hearing or for people who cannot understand the slightest British accent there are subtitles.  Buy it and watch it over and over for the laughs and the culture, both British and French.",1353974400,2,511,4.247422680412371

When you watched it, it made you feel good. The characters in the series go together very well. I wish both series had lasted long for they were very enjoyable to watch, something I will do over and over again, well worth buying.  bob of susanville, calif.",1448668800,,434,4.564102564102564

8493659,5,B00662CEQY,Fun little series. I miss the 70's and 80's Brit-coms the most. Anton Rodgers was a wonderful low key actor. Miss him but now I can see him when ever I want. Julia McKenzie went on to become Miss Marple. Innocent cheeky fresh and fun.,1434153600,,234,4.222222222222222

8493664,4,B00662CEQY,"Situation comedy that eschews sexual innuendo and features happily married middle-aged protagonists is hard to find these days, at least in North America. That is why FRENCH FIELDS, the complete collection, is a welcome addition to the list of superb product being marketed in Canada and the United States by that purveyor of quality media, Acorn.

FRENCH FIELDS is a sequel to the series FRESH FIELDS, which featured the legendary Anton Rodgers and Julia McKenzie (the current Miss Marple) as William and Hester Fields, a middle-aged married couple who are very much in love and whose life together is alternately harmonious and discordant. Sometimes compared to I Love Lucy, the scenario is basically the same: tolerant and forgiving husband puts up with the antics of his hyperactive and well-meaning wife while at the core is a very loving, committed relationship. Zany neighbours and relatives add to the fun of it all.

The difference here is that in both FIELDS series, the acting is exemplary. True, Lucille Ball could act  she became a comedienne after a sincere stab at a dramatic career  but Desi Arnaz (wonderful and appealing as he was) was really just a personality, a foil for Lucy. Both McKenzie and the late Rodgers were seasoned stage actors when they assumed these roles in the mid-1980s. After four series and a total of 27 episodes of FRESH FIELDS, the creators realized that new life had to be breathed into the format were it to continue. And that is precisely what FRENCH FIELDS does. William and Hester decide that they aren't getting any younger and decide to uproot and move to France. Of course the change of scenery and culture brings with it new characters and situations and, for a time, this serves to invigorate the show. Towards the end of FRENCH FIELDS, it all seems somewhat familiar though, and one gets the feeling the producers of the show were aware they needed to draw things to a close while they were still fun. Thanks primarily to the two central performances  this really is superb acting on display, folks  the show continues to charm right to the end.

FRENCH FIELDS ran for three series and a total of 19 episodes and is available in one set of three discs. FRESH FIELDS is available in two sets, also distributed by Acorn Media.

The show is absolutely delightful, in large part because it is totally free of cynicism. While some might prefer their comedy  like their coffee  black, FRESH FIELDS and FRENCH FIELDS simply add the right amount of sugar, without becoming saccharine. This is the type of relaxing programming that is fun to watch after a long day at work. And, if you are lucky enough to be in a loving, supportive relationship like that of the Fields, you will especially appreciate the interaction between these two lovebirds. The show was widely watched in its day, though even then it was considered light-weight. Having said that, the fact that it is now available on DVD suggests there will always be a market for quality programming, no matter how light/heavy it may be. Though the Fields storylines avoid controversy and contention, they continue to entertain. And that, my friends, is the bottom line. Highly recommended.",1397433600,,3192,4.861878453038674
