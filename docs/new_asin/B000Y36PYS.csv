3011621,3,B000Y36PYS,"The Swiss director Andrea Staka (b. 1973) explores the power of place through the lives of three women living in Zurich in her film that has won several awards. The three women would seem to have very little in common except their motherland. Ruza is a Serbian who left Belgrade twenty-five years ago by choice. She had it good, but wanted better. She succeeded by opening a small cafeteria in Zurich, but inwardly she is more dour than the Swiss weather. Her employee Mila is a Croatian who wants to return to the motherland when she retires, but is deeply ambivalent because her children have settled in Switzerland. Into their boring cafeteria lives enters Ana, a twenty-two year old Bosnian from war-torn Sarajevo who epitomizes joie de vivre despite her own secrets that would make you guess otherwise. How these women relate to each other, and the choices they make about what used to be Yugoslavia, drive the plot of this film. In German, Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian, with English sub-titles.",1226448000,4,1002,4.8654970760233915
3011622,3,B000Y36PYS,"If you truly want to experience films that accurately depict other cultures, then you should start getting some Film Movements movies.  These are independent movies that describe dysfunctions from around the world with very fine sensibilities.  This film shows us two women whose lives cross paths.  One is Serbian woman, Ruza (Rose) who immigrated to Western Europe 25 years ago while the other is 22 year old Bosnian girl Ana who has recently left war torn Sarajevo.  Ana is damaged by years of war, her brother's suicide and her own restlessness.  We never really learn her true motives for leaving Sarajevo.  Ruza on the other hand has been living a quiet life, somewhat boring and predictable.  She has lover who she hides from the general public because she knows deeply that he is not a right person for her.  But she is so busy working in her restaurant that the life outside of that world really no longer exist for her.  Ana on the other hand is homeless.  She finds a place to sleep and take shower after her nightly escapades to a disco club.  There, she is picked up by men she never met before and she follows them to their apartments where she has sex with them, but also clens up, eats a little and finds enough strength for another day.  Although very dfferent in their age and temperament, these two women deeply influence each other's life.  I have enjoyed seevral moments in the film.  One is where elderly (Croatian) coupel is watching a TV show and husband makes a very dumb guess on the quiz question if for no other reason than for the reason that saying nothing seems stupid to him.  The other gives you a sense for proportion.  Same woman's husband steals her cash stash from her cash hiding place.  She has been saving that money for a new coat for herself.  He, on the other hand wants to use that money to pay for a new roof for the dream retirement home they are building in Croatia.  That incident as humiliating to a wife who works hard in the restaurant kitchen while her husband sits home all day watching TV pretending to be disabled (his foot is hurt), gives us some insight on how different standard of living is in West vs. East Europe.  Same amount of money can buy one coat in one place and build a roof in the other. Multi layered story, definitely not not be missed.",1193875200,26,2308,4.502403846153846
3011623,4,B000Y36PYS,"Having never seen a Swiss movie and seeing this had a relatively short running time, I was curious enough to check this one out.
The 2 main characters in the movie are Ana, a 22 year old free spirit and Rusa, a middle aged lonely woman who owns a restaurant in a working class neighborhood in Zurich. Ana goes to work for Rusa and with the pair being opposites in behavior and attitudes, this changes both their lives. Pay attention as there is a huge plot twist towards the end.
Most of the events in the movie take place in the less scenic parts of Switzerland although there is a brief trip to the Alps which is very much like a postcard. In addition to cheese, chocolate and watches, it looks like the Swiss can make a pretty decent movie too.",1329523200,3,747,4.304964539007092

3011625,5,B000Y36PYS,"I don't know why I was drawn to this little film. I was looking for something entertaining and just stumbled on it. The title, FRAULEIN, interested me, as I had spent several years in Germany in my youth and was curious because of the German/Serbian/Bosnian/Croatian subtitles. (I was hoping I'd recall what little German I learned while I was there.) But, as soon as this picture started, I was drawn into it. It was both hopeful and heartbreaking. And I especially liked the character of Ana (Marija Skaricic) from Sarajevo, who brought her plain beauty, youth, and energy into the lives of the two older women she met and befriended: Ruza (Marjiana Karanovic), the cold, joyless Serbian owner of a Swiss canteen, who hires Ana to do menial tasks and, at first, resists Ana's attempts to turn the workplace into a bright and welcoming stop for people going to and coming from their humdrum jobs, as well as the dishwashers, cooks, and busboys who work there; and Mila,(a Croatian) who isn't all that sure if she wants to leave Switzerland and her grown children and return to Croatia with her retired husband to build his dream house. That is, until they both learn more about the life-loving Ana. Ana..., for all her youthful energy and passion, has a secret that she keeps deep within her that causes her to live life to the fullest and bring hope for the future to the two women she emotionally touches.

OK...I haven't really said anything to spoil this film for anyone who might want to take a chance and watch it. I just wanted to say that FRAULEIN isn't really just an Eastern European Chick-flick. It's a deeply moving story about 3 women who survived a terrible civil war and learned to live again. 5 Stars",1326240000,5,1717,4.666666666666667

3011627,1,B000Y36PYS,"My wife and I just finished watching this movie, and we can't even believe that it was the same film that the other reviewers left such high ratings and glowing reviews for. Without giving away any of the story, all I can say is that while perhaps the acting was good and the production was well done, the movie was boring straight through. I kept waiting for it to go somewhere, entertain, compel or shock, and alas, it did none of those things for me. I can't quite say that any one thing about the movie was bad, but overall, it didn't entertain me or move me. I am an avid fan of movies of all kinds, and this is easily one of perhaps the 20 most boring movies I've ever seen in my life, not that I keep such a list, but if I did, this would be one it. Part of me feels guilty for leaving this bad review for this film that so many people seemed to love and praise. That being said, I would have much appreciated a candid review such as this one, had it been there two hours ago, thus sparing me the time wasted and boredom endured from watching this film. To be fair, I do understand that when it comes to artful films like this, especially, high quality works of art are not created for all to enjoy, but rather for some people to enjoy and not others. If everyone loved this movie, then maybe it wouldn't be so 'artful' but rather more mainstream. Maybe it just went over my head.",1317427200,8,1387,4.159851301115242

In less than an hour and a half, we learned how humans share their lives with only a few words spoken relying on their gestures and actions to propel the story.

8230881,2,B000Y36PYS,"Like a handful of others, I chose to watch ""Fraulein"" in large part due to the excellent reviews it has received here on Amazon. Its short duration was also appealing; regrettably, I do not always have time to watch longer films in one sitting, and I absolutely hate having to pause a movie and come back to it later. Unfortunately, viewing ""Fraulein"" turned out to be a waste of time.

I found this film to be extraordinarily slow. ""Fraulein"" is a story about one young woman's (Ana) unlikely impact on an older woman (Ruza). It becomes apparent early in the film that Ana is afflicted by a serious illness (which goes unnamed until late in the movie- watch out for spoilers in some of the other reviews), yet she remains a free, joyful spirit in spite of this. By contrast, Ruza is extremely boring and quite obviously content with her uninteresting life. The audience is subjected to long scenes of Ruza executing her daily routine which, as far as I can tell, are only included in the movie to demonstrate just how bland she really is. Mila, an employee at Ruza's restaurant who is equally dull and older still, also appears in a number of lengthy scenes. Far too much time is devoted to showing the audience just how boring these two women are.

While the acting is very good in ""Fraulein,"" the characters are not well-developed. Apparently, the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for all three of the main characters, but very little backstory is provided to direct viewers' emotions. While I got the impression I was supposed to pity Ruza, almost nothing she did on-screen motivated me to do so. The audience is shown everything and told very little. In this case, ""less"" unsuccessfully tries to be ""more.""

Ana is by far the most interesting character in the film, though she also comes across as somewhat contrived. Actress Marija Scaricic is not at fault for this- in fact, her performance is very solid. Instead, it is the result of a painfully average script. The dialogue contains little of the emotion the actresses display; there are more examples of irritating camera-work than interesting ones. Overall, though, I do not have much to critique technically, especially given what I imagine to be a meager budget for ""Fraulein.""

Ultimately, ""Fraulein"" failed to move me. Although there are a few very good scenes, the film as a whole is uninspiring. The dialogue fails to deliver the intended drama (mostly because of poor writing), and many of the silent scenes just drag on and on. In the end, I cared very little about Ruza, far less about Mila, and was only somewhat sympathetic to Ana, who (I think) was supposed to be a tragic hero of sorts. Regardless, I don't have the desire to slog through ""Fraulein"" again to try to sort out what I saw. Even an hour and fifteen minutes is too much time to devote to this exceptionally boring film.",1354492800,2,2860,4.702594810379241

8230883,3,B000Y36PYS,"English subtitled small low-budget film, a simple story nicely done.

Ruza is a lonely 50-ish single woman who owns/runs a restaurant (really more like a cafeteria).  She is strictly business and has built up thick walls - she doesn't get close to anyone or let anyone get close to her. A drab existence really, but since she's independent and has her own business she feels she's ""made it"".

Ana is a young woman (about 22) new in town without a plan, a bit of coin in her pocket, knows no one. She keeps her small bag of stuff in a little locker at the bus station and goes home with whatever new friends she makes.  One day Ana is in her restaurant and sees that an older employee has cut herself and she goes behind the counter to help her with the cut.  She notices that the serving line is stopped without the injured woman so she jumps in to help out. She is then offered a position, which she eventually takes but lets Ruza know she is just passing through.

In her brief stay in town, Ana manages to basically bulldoze past Ruzas protective walls, and breathe ""life"" back into her before moving on - also making the other workers (and patrons) lives a little better in the process.

Ana has leukemia and is in remission, and has decided to LIVE and enjoy every moment she has left (and not spend it getting treatment if she can avoid it). She keeps her illness to herself, but eventually confides to Ruza towards the end of the movie after they have become friends, as the ""remission"" ends.

This is not an ""exciting"" movie, sortof just ordinary life, and a brief snippet of Anas life at that.  You don't get to learn a whole lot about her past, where she's going when she leaves town or what happens to her, but it's not really important to the film.

It's nice that she does what she can to enjoy simple things and people.  May make you see things in your life just a tiny bit differently as well.

It's subtle and well done for what it's intended to be.  Not a ""must see"" or one I'd want to own and watch multiple times... just a simple and interesting little snippet about a few ordinary lives. I'm glad I watched it though.",1345075200,2,2137,4.339195979899498
