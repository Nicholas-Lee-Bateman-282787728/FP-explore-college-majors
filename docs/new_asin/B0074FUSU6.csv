8509891,3,B0074FUSU6,"This movie is valuable to fans of the 3 Stooges.  It is their debut, though they are not the stars and have only a small part. The group consists of the earliest Stooges: Shemp, Moe, and Larry.  After the movie, Shemp left the act and Curly (Jerome) replaced him.  Later, when Curly became ill, Shemp returned.

The movie itself doesn't have much to it, but provides and excuse for the comedy involved, much of which is not that funny to modern audiences.",1459382400,,455,4.512195121951219

8509894,3,B0074FUSU6,"This is a two disc set featuring Snow White and the Three Stooges(released June/61)on a dreaded double sided disc with full screen on one side and widescreen(1:85:1) on the other,along with Soup to Nuts(released Sept/30)on a single disc.
Snow white is a dreadful boor of a film with the Three Stooges just passing in and out when needed. The film leads are taken by Olympic gold medal skater Carol Heiss as Snow white and Edson Stroll as Prince Charming. You may or may not recall Stroll in his future more well known role as part of Quentin McHale's PT boat crew on McHale's Navy. The story finds Snow White enjoying a happy go lucky existence with her father when he is suddenly stricken ill and passes away. Her step mother then puts her in the dungeon for over a year so she can rule alone. When it comes time for the step mother to stop her mourning she orders Snow White taken into the woods and killed. However the man given that task cannot carry it out and he tells her to flee for her life. The Three Stooges are traveling minstrel type players along with an orphan who they rescued and adopted many years before from a man intent on killing him.
The princess runs and hides in the seven dwarfs house,coincidentally the same place the Three Stooges and their orphan are staying at. The orphan and the princess fall in love,of course,and down the line it is learned the orphan is in reality Prince charming,Snow White's true betrothed. The mean step mother turns herself into an old witch and gives Snow White a poison apple,which puts her to sleep only to be awakened by love's true kiss. When the Stooges find her they think she is dead and when they tell the Prince he of course delivers the kiss of all kisses and she awakes. The Prince now decides to help the villagers in an uprising against the wicked step mother. During the fight he is presumed dead also,but it was just a flesh wound. In the end the wicked step mother is dethroned and the two,along with the Stooges,skate off into the sunset.
I really wanted to like this film. There some sweet songs sung and it is a cute story,but the Stooges are so seldom seen and have such little to do,except to further the plot along,with very few laughs of any kind,that the Three Wiener Schnitzels(who ever they are)could have subbed for the Stooges and it would have made no difference. Remember this is at a time when the Stooges are starting to enjoy a huge resurgence in popularity due to their old Columbia shorts on TV.Even the kids who were the ones giving the Stooges their renewal would have been bored with this stinker because of just that fact. Too much sweetness,not enough Stoogness. This vehicle should have been at least 80/20(or more)Stooges instead of 20/80. The ONLY saving grace is the quality of the print. It is a beautiful pristine print and in colour to boot. Oh yes,the third Stooge at this juncture in time is Curly Joe De Rita. I was to see these three live at the CNE in just over two years hence. 2-2 1/2 stars.
Soup to Nuts is the best of the two here. This is an obvious early sound picture as everyone seems to be shouting at the top of their lungs to be heard. This film was written by Rube Goldberg,the famous cartoonist,and he actually appears in it in a brief scene. And his touch is seen throughout,especially with all the crazy gadgets Pop Otto(Charles Winninger)creates in his spare time. Also in cameos are a young Billy Barty,and Keystone/Chaplin veteran Max Swain is unmistakable as one of the restaurant patrons. Ted Healy is present of course along with Larry Fine,Moe and Shemp Howard and Fred Sanborn,who was more well known as pretty much the fourth Stooge in their vaudeville act. He plays the mute fireman,who is always running after the fire engine and is always trying to give Ted Healy a piece of paper from his jacket pocket,which he refuses until the very end.
Charles Winninger who plays Otto Schmidt runs a costume place which is going into bankruptcy. His assistant/salesman is Ted Healy,who between helping Pop and working at the fire station,has a very busy life. Pop gets a job waitering at a friends restaurant,while Healy holds down the fort back at the costume shop,between fires. Healy thinks he is bringing the business back to life but it is really due to the fellow in charge of the receivership who has fallen for Otto's daughter. In the end there is a fire and the couple are finally joined together. It is now we finally find out what the mute fireman was carrying in his pocket all that time.
Healy actually does a pretty good job throughout along with Winniger,who gives the film all of its solid acting moments. The Stooges are in the film more than I would have thought from all previous descriptions of it,and they have some pretty good material now and then. The Stooges actually sing together and even Healy does a nice singing bit when it comes his turn. After he does he and the Stooges go into a funny vaudeville routine. The topper is Larry Fine's elevator dance;you have to watch it to get it. We are so used to Moe being the lead in their shorts that it is hard not to notice that Shemp seems to be taking the lead in most situations in this film. Moe was even billed as Harry Howard. This is the Stooges first film and as such it is quite historical in that regard,and a must have for all fans of the knuckleheads. The print here,though having some quick jumps now and again and sound drop outs due to its age,is pristine and looks fabulous,not like the 82 year old film it is. 3 1/2-4 stars.
All in all we get a look at the Stooges at beginning of their careers on film and at the nadir of their careers,though at this time in the early 60s,on a popularity resurgence due to their old shorts shown on TV.Their first film is by far the best of the two,while the only thing good about Snow White is that it is in colour. I bought the set for Soup to Nuts and I am glad I did,while I treat Snow White more as a curiosity than anything. Recommended.",1336867200,4,5992,4.483074107959744
