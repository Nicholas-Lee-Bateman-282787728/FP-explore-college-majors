8455130,5,B0053C990C,La Nia de la Venta is a beautiful Spanish movie of 1950 Photographed in Fotocine color.  I saw this film when a was 6 years old with my mother who was fun of Lola Flores.  This film is a little gem.  Lola Flores singing and dancing of flamenco music was spectacular. I love this movie because bring back old remembrances.,1462579200,,321,4.316666666666666
