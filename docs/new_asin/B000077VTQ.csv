On a seperate note, does anyone have a list of the songs in the soundtrack?",1041379200,,284,4.480769230769231
1802501,5,B000077VTQ,I saw the premier of this movie and ever since it is with a doubt one of the best movies ever made.  It is for all the skiers that have an itch that no other movie has scratched,1039564800,,177,3.6578947368421053
1802502,5,B000077VTQ,This movie was sick! Everyone just went crazy. C.R Johnson was great and so was Seth Morisson. I could go on and on but it would take forever but everyone was just goin off. I think it is the best movie i have seen. Buy it. You won't regret it.,1039392000,,244,3.9

7974365,3,B000077VTQ,It gets boring watching guys do the same roll/flip off a cliff repeatedly for an hour. The first two Ski Movies offered much more variety and more adrenalized editing.,1068076800,4,167,4.793103448275862
7974366,5,B000077VTQ,"This was the abosulute best ski movie I've seen in a while. Sweet Tricks. Sweet Big Mountain stuff, Sweet skiiers, An Unbelieveable soundtrack, and even a snowmobile segment. The crevasse segment was amazing as well. This movie has amazing cinematography, and the video matches the sound perfectly. I've see a lot of ski movies this year, and this was by far the best, and best presented one to date. For those wondering, here is a list of songs (From the credits, in the order they are in the movie):
""Feel so Numb"" Rob Zombie
""Invincible"" Capone and Noreaga
""A Need To Escape"" Souldivider
""Trouble"" Cypress Hill
""This Life"" Primer 55
""Rock Star"" N.E.R.D.
""Killing Spree"" Swollen Members
""Burn it Black"" Injected
""Now or Never"" Dope
""Madness"" DELTRON 3030
""Take Your Best Shot"" Dope
""Cute Without the E"" Taking Back Sunday
""Boomerang"" Cirrus
""Fuel Injected"" Swollen Members
""Seperate Kingdom"" Fu Manchu
""Breathe"" Swollen Members feat Nelly Furtado
""Hang On"" 3rd Strike
""Keep the Sabbath Dream Alive"" Workhorse Movement
""Flow Heat"" 3rd Strike
""Time Goes By"" Soul Hooligan
""Things You Can Do"" DELTRON 3030",1064102400,16,1104,5.071428571428571
7974367,5,B000077VTQ,"This movie was the best out of all the ski movies so far.  All the skiers in it are sick esepecially Candide Thovex, Tanner Hall, CR Johnson, Johnny Moseley, JT Holmes, Aaron McGovern, Shawn Sullivan and Shane McConkey....  the soundtrack was dope especially the songs that Tanner Hall and Shawn Sullivan skied to.  I reccomend this movie to skiers of all type from racers, freestyle skiers and even snowboarders would like it.",1050019200,,427,4.902777777777778
7974368,4,B000077VTQ,"I've seen pretty much every ski movie put out his year and I've got to say that this was not the best one. First off they seriously over did it with the big mountain footage. Alot of the clips arn't even movie worthy. Secondly I think that Line slipped them something under the table as a very undeserveing Eric Pollard got 3 segments, which are all [poo.] Candide's segment was awesome but all of those clips are in every other ski movie. Brad Holmes looks like an amature sliding rails. And Seths segment only has a few good parts. The cravase jumping in Whistler Backcountry was super sick though. In my eyes ski movie 2 was alot better. But for movies this year I would reccomend ""The Playground"" - By 2 Track Productions, or ""Strike 3"" - By Level 1 Productions. If you like to watch alot of big mountain then SM3 is ok, but if you want more newschool action check out those other 2.",1049587200,7,887,4.349397590361446
