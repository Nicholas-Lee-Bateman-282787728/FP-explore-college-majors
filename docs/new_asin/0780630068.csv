32519,1,0780630068,"This movie shot right to the top of my WORST EVER list.  It was atrocious, boring, and has nothing to recommend it. Pullman not only was a disaster in  the acting department but as a director he should be shot.  I could only  hear one in five words in outdoor scenes, but I just had to watch it right  to the bitter end, as I could not believe how bad it was.
The plot  shifted around like a dogs hind leg, right when you thought there was going  to be some action - fade to black - new scene with absolutely no  explanation.  It was an agonising experience, one I do not intend to  repeat.  I just cannot believe how amateurish this production was and all I  could recommend about it was the scenery of hills, dales, trees and more  trees which were far more interesting than the wooden performances by all  concerned.  Lane struggled valiantly but she must be desperate for money to  accept this role (personally I'd rather beg in the street) than be  associated with such a poor production. If your into masochism then this is  the movie for you as it will certainly extract it's pound of flesh.",966729600,6,1098,4.351485148514851
32520,4,0780630068,"Pullman is the biggest drawback to this otherwise entertaining film. He's not leading man material. Not rugged enough. The two main characters, the  virginian and the ""schoolmarm,"" remain rather one dimensional  throughout and the movie provides no clues to their motivations or why she  would be interested in him. Also, she is too beautiful and smart and  socially well adjusted to believe that she would hop on a train to the  middle of nowhere. Why did she do it? And she seems to fall in love with  Pullman in the blink of an eye. Whoa, how did that happen? He didn't seem  all that great a catch. But the story holds up and its a pretty good one.  Made me very interested in seeing the 1929 and 1946 versions. I'd like to  also see C.B.DeMille's 1914 version, but I doubt if that will ever happen.  It looks like the book will have to do. Can't wait. Only $3.99 from this  place.",965260800,2,885,4.434782608695652
32531,3,0780630068,"The following review is for the original movie The Virginian, starring Joel McCrae not Bill Pullman as pictured.

Would have loved to see this on a big screen, but whoever set up the way this is shown doesn't give us the splendor that must have been enjoyed by moviegoers back then.
Also, can't figure out why closed captions aren't available, so if you're hard of hearing, good luck figuring out what is being  said in some of the more intimate scenes.",1487289600,,453,4.580246913580247

32551,3,0780630068,"Bill Pullman is a little old to play the title role. In the book the Viriginian is around 25-30 years old; and at over 40, Pullman doesn't quite work. Still, they've paired him with Diane Lane, also an older lead, and so the romance part works. Pullman also directed and he made some interesting visual choices, particularly to keep the camera mobile during long master shots, which lends the movie an air of slight surprise. A creditable version of the book, which preserves the major plot points, while avoiding some of the novelists questionable politics. It's a pity that the disc is in the old square TV format, because it's clear that it was filmed with the 1.78, widescreen ratio in mind, and a wide transfer would have been a better choice, especially given those Western (Alberta) landscapes.",1467936000,3,801,4.811594202898551

32556,3,0780630068,"I think that the plot of this film is good, but it dragged too much. Bill Pullman looks good, but did not seem to fit the part. He seemed like a non-cowboy dressed up as one. There were also a lot of parts that seemed to me to be truncated; they should have been longer, even though other parts, as I said, seemed to be overly long. This film is a far cry from a Clint Eastwood-type film. I have to admit that there were times when I wanted to just stop watching the film.",1451606400,,472,3.9789473684210526

32558,4,0780630068,"Released in 2000, The Virginian was the fifth movie version of the 1902 novel by Owen Wister. Bill Pullman directs and plays the titular character, a cowboy promoted to foreman on a remote Wyoming ranch. He falls for a schoolmarm newly-arrived from back East (Diane Lane) whos shocked by the uncivilized violence and justice she observes. John Savage plays the best friend while Colm Feore plays the main villain. Harris Yulin and Dennis Weaver are on hand as the big ranch owners.

This is the only film version of the story Ive seen and, Ill be honest, its a hard movie to catch a grip with. To appreciate it you have to bear with the first half, paying close attention to the mumbling dialogue, which paves the way for a worthwhile second half. Also keep in mind that this isn't a rollicking shoot-em-up Western; its more of a realistic drama in the Old West with flashes of Western staples, like hanging rustlers and saloon confrontations.  It has the look and tone of 2003 Open Range, but lacks the budget, since it was made-for-cable (TNT). While I love rousing Westerns when they're done right, like 2002s American Outlaws, I prefer the more realistic approach, like 1990s Dances With Wolves or 1992s Unforgiven. The Virginian is similar in tone and locale to these movies, but is hampered by its TV-budget.

The good news is that the locations, cast, cinematography, score and plot are all top caliber; unfortunately, the low-budget is glaring at times. For instance, theres a scene where the cowboys are forced to bring some horses down a steep hill and the entire sequence comes off awkward. Im sure director Pullman felt the same way and tried his best to make it make sense in the editing room. With a higher budget he couldve taken more time shooting that particular scene or done reshoots, but with the limited funds he had to make do with what he had. There are other scenes where I had to stop and think, Okay, whats really going on here and was eventually able to figure it out. This occasional lack of clarity was probably the result of cramming a 300-page book into a 95-minute movie.

The above explains my relatively low rating (6/10), but Im still giving it a marginal thumbs-up because the movies very worthwhile if you're willing to put in the time and effort. Somewhere during the second half I stopped TRYING to like it and was involved with the story and appreciated the filmmaking (photography, music, actors, etc.); I was just focusing on understanding the dialogue.

The schoolmarm and the government agents represent the encroachment of civilization to tame the West and men like the Virginian. The former succeeds while the latter cant handle the sometimes savage environment and suffer accordingly. While the protagonist understandably falls to the charms of the former the failure of the latter leaves him no recourse but to carry out justice, Western style.

The film was shot in Alberta, Canada.

32559,4,0780630068,"I have always liked Bill Pullman as a leading actor, more so in the few romances that have been filmed. (While You Were Sleeping, this western and parts of Independence Day come to mind.)  Don't know why he wasn't/isn't used more in that vein rather than other  'bit' parts (hardly there in The Equalizer).
While some of the language may seen a little antiquated in this version of The Virginian, I believe they were trying to stay true to the novel so that made it OK.  John Savage in a supporting part was pretty good but the two leads make this movie.  Gorgeous Canadian filming locations as well.",1439856000,,600,4.527777777777778

However, this DVD is crippled by the fact that it lacks two things that even the VHS edition has/had:
the 16:9 wide screen format and closed captions.

out to show its wide open Wyoming spaces to a crappy, truncated obsolete-TV 4:3 full screen.
And where are the closed captions that are needed to understand all the dialog?

I personally hated Trampas, which I was supposed to do. Harris Yulen was in his one of his best roles I felt, as the supportive Judge Garth. Diane Ladd was very appealing as Molly Stark.

But this is by far the best portrayal. I would give it more stars if I could. Bill Pullman clearly made this with reverence, true to the pace of the original story, and every bit as honest at the real West. My only wish is that every single scene in the book could've been in the movie, especially the scene where he switches all the babies in their blankets at a social.

The script was good in general for a traditional western with a laconic hero even if it is a TV movie, but there were a couple of moments that I did not fully understand because it's been a while since I read the book and I did not understand the cowboy movie vernacular perfectly.  I have some guesses but I am not confident of them.

The direction of the horses running was strong and added tension.  I liked James Drury in a role and Dennis Weaver, a little reminiscent touch with Mr. Drury that was well done.  I liked the music score alot.  As you can tell, I liked the movie!  I read Owen Wister's book when I was in my early teens.  As it was written in the early 1900's, and the time of the story is about 15 years earlier, the language and depiction of life and the setting would be fairly accurate.

32638,4,0780630068,"""The Virginian"" has one of the most long-lived story lines in the history of western film. How it has evolved over the years from its origins in Owen Wister's novel (1902) is a story unto itself. The first ""literary"" western, based on Wister's own visits to the West in the 1880s, it became a wildly popular bestseller, was quickly made into a successful stage play, and then five movies and a long-running TV series. A few basic elements of the plot have remained more or less intact: the Virginian's long courtship of Molly, the independent-minded schoolmarm from back East; the hanging of his best friend; the conflict with his nemesis Trampas; the shoot-out at sundown; and the famous line, ""Smile when you call me that.""

Bill Pullman's version is a lot closer to the original than the TV series, which played fast and loose with the material, but like every other version, it falls short of matching Wister's achievement. Pullman understands that the Virginian is a man of principle, honor, discretion, and remarkable patience. But his portrayal of these character traits makes him too stoic and flat. Wister's Virginian, still in his 20s, has a playful streak that gives him an irresistible, boyish charm. Pullman, unfortunately, is obviously twice that age, and without the youth of a younger actor he comes across as sometimes wooden.

Diane Lane's Molly is actually closer to Wister's conception of her character, and actresses from the beginning have had trouble conveying her spirited independence without seeming either shrill or stubbornly comical. Though Wister makes a point of saying that Molly is not a ""New Woman"" (i.e. early feminist), she comes across that way anyway - prepared to live her life as a single woman if need be, and free to marry whatever man she chooses, regardless of his social station - in this case, an unschooled, low-born cowboy.

In Wister's novel, there is an element of youthful willfulness to help account for her behavior. Diane Lane's portrayal of a woman somewhat past marrying age makes her independence plausible and even ""modern."" When she says she won't marry the Virginian if he kills Trampas, she means it, and unlike her predecessors, follows through on her promise. Pullman's Virginian has to go hat in hand to her and persuade her to reconsider. While Wister's ending has her retreating into helpless, all-forgiving love for her man, Pullman's Molly gets to hang on to her scruples about the ethics of gunning down another man in cold blood.

A curious development in this version of the story is the elevation of the character of Balaam, a neighboring rancher who mistreats horses in the novel and represents corresponding weaknesses of character. Here, played by Dennis Weaver, he becomes a second villain, whom the Virginian must deal with in the final shootout with Trampas. For Pullman, Balaam isn't just a bad apple, but a representative of corporate greed. This is a modern development we see in other recent westerns - the crooked CEO of an agribusiness willing to stop at nothing to maximize profits. (Cf. ""Appaloosa"" and ""Open Range"".) This development extends the final confrontation scene, but is a major departure from Wister's novel. Having it all take place inside the saloon, instead of out in the street, also limits the potential for suspense (Cf. ""High Noon"".)

Most agreeable about the film is its attempt to capture the open range of 1880s Wyoming. It portrays the sweeping beauty of the prairies, as well as the sense of isolation when people lived and worked so far from the nearest town or railroad. The music track in its haunting spareness is also very evocative, without the use of a big orchestra that was common in ""big"" westerns of the past. If you forget Wister and just watch the film as a low-keyed mix of frontier justice and love story, you shouldn't be disappointed, but treat yourself to the original sometime. Read ""The Virginian.""",1258761600,4,3927,4.952959028831563
32639,5,0780630068,The Virginian is a sweet story in the tradition of old westerns and with the same charm as the old TV series.  The ending is the twist you always wanted to see in the series. It was a nice role for Bill Pullman who plays this type of character so much better than some of the rougher and very unlikeable other movies I have seen him in.,1244851200,,336,4.014925373134329
32640,2,0780630068,"There are no words to describe how SLOW this movie was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film deals with the story of a schoolteacher from New England who meets a Virginian cowboy on the plains of Wyoming.

The presence of Bill Pullman and Diane Lane did very little to alleviate the pain of watching this slooow and boooring mooovie...

In addition, Diane Lane's character was way to pushy/bossy/feminist for late 19th century, making it rather unrealistic.

As for the supporting characters, this film does not seem to be their thing, and subsequently they look like they are out of place.

In relation to the plot and the dialogues, they are way beyond ""below average.""

With the exception of the setting, (the plains are indeed breathtaking!) everything else is nothing to write home about.

In conclusion, the potential for a decent movie was there if only the writers had the ability to... write!  A shame really...

32643,5,0780630068,"Director: Bill Pullman
Format: ColorRated: NR
Studio: Turner Home Video
Video Release Date: February 6, 2001
Cast:
Pullman  The Virginian
Diane Lane  Molly Stark
Dennis Weaver rival rancher
James Drury  The Judge
Others: unidentified
A schoolteacher, Molly Stark, comes West to Wyoming and meets the Virginian who falls for her.  He is made foreman of the Judge's ranch, but the ranch is competing with Dennis Weaver's (of Gunsmoke fame) ranch.  There is also  a rivalry between the Virginian and Trampas (""Smile when you call me that, pardner!""), who quits when he becomes foreman rather than take orders from him.  The Virginian is forced to hang one of his saddle mates when he turns outlaw.
This story has all of the elements of a good Western, pathos, struggle, rustling, violence of which Molly disaproves, and causes tension between them very similar to that in High Noon, made later.
This is the story that started them all, and became the pattern for the genre and was the granddaddy of all of the nonsense ""Wild West"" mythology, including the ridiculous fast draw contests in the middle of the street, the fancy cowboy outfits, and the idea that murderers adhered to chivalric rules of combat instead of the backshooting, drygulching and murders that actually took place, just as in the Bowery, but in smaller numbers in the West.

32644,4,0780630068,"This is one of the best westerns I have ever seen.  After spending our vacation in Montana this year, this video made me yearn for that majestic loneliness and the strong sense of the importance of the individual.  The unusual score also adds a mysterious, haunting quality to the film.
Yes, the story is a tad rushed, but the acting is superb.  For a first time director, Pullman, certainly drew touchingly realistic portrayals from the fine cast.  It is interesting to note how Pullman has ""modernized"" The Virginian by making him not such the perfect ""natural man"", ala Fennimore Cooper.  He is rather a man filled with a sense of anxiety and doubt, but who also has a strong sense of his own worth and duty to the people around him.",1002499200,20,736,4.587786259541985
32645,4,0780630068,"I really enjoyed this film, Bill Pullman was great in the leading role and made a fine job as director.  The only reason I did not give the film five stars was because it could have been a little longer, I would have liked more time to get to know the main characters.  If you like Westerns then this old style gentle film with a romantic story line is a good one to try.",982454400,4,371,4.0
32646,4,0780630068,"I personally enjoyed this production of the Virginian, but I will say that having read the book beforehand helped me out a lot.  The plot is rushed through in places, and I imagine some would find spots of it hard to follow if unfamiliar with the story.  I also found there to be a lack of character development, which could further mystify those who haven't read the book.  Unfortunately, two hours of film just isn't enough to do this fine book justice.  It just kills me that Bill Pullman didn't produce this as a mini-series a la Lonesome Dove; it would have been hands-down fantastic!
However, as is I enjoyed Bill Pullman as the leading man; his every-day guy look made him more realistic and a nice change from the stereotypical square-jawed hunk.  I also loved the cinematography of the picture; it really gives one the feeling of the West's vast, wide-open spaces.  Truly stunning scenery, especially with the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack.  And, while just a snip of the whole story, I felt the movie definately contained the spirit of Wistner's book.  I really enjoyed the fact that it used the same manner of speech and kept the old-fashioned feel; a touching love story with simple, honest characters. Some may find it a bit mellow, but you need to remember that the book was written almost 100 years ago in 1902.  I was personally thankful that they didn't try to snaz up the story in an attempt to appeal to a finicky modern audience; the book is a classic, and deserves to shine through as origionally written.
So, if you are willing to overlook a few flaws (mainly, rushing the story) I would recommend this version of the Virginian if you want a sweet, serious movie that is beautiful to look at ultimately touches the heart.",978480000,45,1745,4.676470588235294

Dennis Weaver was cast against type as the protagonist. It also had a credible love story to keep the ladies attention.  I thought it was more realistic in that the Virginian was depicted as a regular type of guy who had some very difficult decisions to make.  He made the decisions and then he had to suffer the consequences.",969753600,8,479,4.409090909090909

These are probably the same people that enjoy these so called artsy independent films that are going straight to video. Bill Pullman did try some things with direction which may or may not have worked.  But more importantly I think he made a very ENTERTAINING film of STRONG CHARACTER and INTEGRITY.  Films like this could only get made on TV and I think that is a shame.  Unlike most movies I watch nowadays I felt fantastic at the end of it, and not like I had just wasted a couple hours of my time.  I will definitely add it to my collection when it comes to DVD.",969580800,15,628,4.243697478991597
