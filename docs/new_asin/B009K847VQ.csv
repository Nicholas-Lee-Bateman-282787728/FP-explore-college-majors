8542391,5,B009K847VQ,I found the stories really interesting and informative. The format was also good. A lot of time videos I want to show my student are good except for this part is to slow or that part is to fast etc or it has great information but is boring. This video was engaging and well paced. The accompanying teacher resource is helpful and will be easily adapted to some of my classes.,1365206400,3,375,4.295774647887324
