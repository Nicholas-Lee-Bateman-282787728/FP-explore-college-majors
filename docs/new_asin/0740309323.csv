204778,2,0740309323,"The storyline is pretty uneventful because the golden rule of ""show don't tell"" was not followed. In movies the scene should show the FBI swarming a building and seizing assets - not show someone taking a phone call and hearing about it or listening to a radio and hearing about it... If you don't have the budget to show a few key action scenes, you don't have a movie. If you too away the video you could play this movie as a radio program and still have all the drama intact because there is no acting... just a bunch of ""telling.""

This film got that itch going but didn't really scratch it.  It got some of that done, which is what matters, even though it was obviously not big budget.  The sound seemed kind of amateurish at times, the acting merely adequate, the incidental music reminded me of an after school special.  But it wasn't bad.  It was a real movie and it competently did the things movies should do.  It just didn't fulfill what I hoped for it to be.  Which I guess is a metaphor for what went on in the film itself.

204783,3,0740309323,"This was a low-budget film with actors that were skilled enough to contribute to a film that is ""thought-provoking"" and ""engaging.""  You will  not get all the added production quality of a film that has a larger budget.  As far as the script and dialogue went,  it could have been better but overall it succeeded in getting the viewer to consider the actual consequences a computer intelligence drawing conclusions on the question of  ""Does God exist?""  At one point towards the end, a small clip is emailed that show a Philosopher considering a question of ""Whether it is ultimately beneficial to the further development of human progress that a conclusion be drawn about God's existence or whether it is best to leave this question to be one that is continually wrestled with on the personal level?""  Near Death Experience or NDE's come into play on a very small scale in the conversations between the computer, IVAN, and those who experienced them.  No doubt, the computer data gathering program finds that this provides evidence of something greater than humans alone in the universe but this is very indirectly presented and not given as much attention as I would have liked.

Spoiler Alert:  In the film, IVAN doesn't produce an answer to God's existence.  The premise comes down to the philosophical argument of WHY DO WE ---AS HUMANS-- WHO KNOW FEEL LOVE, PAIN, AND DEEP EMOTION WANT TO THROW AT SUCH A VERY SPIRITUAL, HUMAN-BASED QUESTION (GOD'S EXISTENCE) TO A COMPUTER THAT IS DATA-FED AND NOT SENSORY OR DESIGNED OR BUILT AS WE ARE.  Hmmm......very good point, no doubt.  As far as the ending went.....I really didn't like it all.  I thought the Director could have figured out a better to close out to the film, even with it being a low-budget film.  It's like you get invited on a journey with a very significant question and you get hopeful of what could be but then you are left with a somewhat inconclusive and abrupt ending, in relation to the beginning point of the film.  I didn't expect some fantastic ending at all....but I'm like REALLY???? at the end.  Overall this film had a decent plot.  The actors are above average (yet not award-winning performance by any stretch) but there is definitely elements that could be improved in the production.  I do think it's a great plot that should be picked up again with a Director who can take it to the next level.  I think the movie, TRANSCENDENCE, with Johnny Depp, has some similarities and you get all the great special effects with that film, since the budget was good.  If you want to watch a film that makes you think, either one of the films can succeed in that.  There are issues for all of us, as technology grows in it's ability to process information at unimaginable speed.  Would the artificial intelligence make decisions to our benefit or to our detriment?  That is something to think about, for sure.",1446940800,,2883,4.731462925851703

204787,5,0740309323,"This review contains spoilers.

A computer scientist gets dragged into a mall by his girlfriend. As he's sitting on the ""boyfriend bench"", he catches a strikingly beautiful mannequin staring at him. In that moment, he has a crush on her. That's a memorable moment from ""The God Question"", and it is much more than a humorous anecdote. Me thinks our protagonist, Stephen Kendrick, (played believably by Keith Langsdale) is easily taken in by things not human and expects more from them than they can give. Many of us do in the West. We frequently attribute human form or personality to inanimate objects. There is a lot of this anthropomorphizing in the movie. In another moment in the movie, Stephen is on the phone with a friendly customer service representative, and the conversation becomes mildly personal. She has caught his attention on at least one level, and he is interested in knowing where she is. At that moment, the call goes silent and he asks if his question was too personal. The silence continues. A moment later, a male voice comes on explaining that Stephen had been talking with a computer and his question confused it. Stephen had been taken in again. He'd had a ""crush"" on a ""mannequin.""

Lesser mortals and technology let Stephen down a lot in this movie, and he suffers through it all with a martyr's patience. There is weariness in all of his features and mannerisms as he suffers one fool after another, (including the suffering his own foolishness occasionally causes him).

The inanimate frequently catches our protagonist's attention in this movie, just as it does in our western culture. From smartphones to tablets to PCs and Macs, we rely on them for everything--from weather reports, to bill paying, to ""humanless human interaction"", to thinking about things for us. Our reliance on technology comes through clearly in the movie. The movie does not present technology as all good, though it comes close to presenting it as the god of this age. Still, the movie sees that fallacy and presents both the limits and benefits of technology. The super-intelligent computer it features, AKA Ivan, comes close to being omnipotent and omnipresent, but it is not a god that can be depended upon for answers, comfort, strength, or salvation. Despite its vast abilities, it is not able to create everything from nothing. It has the advantage, however, of knowing it was created by intelligent beings with complex language, code, elaborate hardware and software and is not just a product of a happy accident in a junkyard. It virtually knows everything, along with its own abilities, so even it would realize it's not God. I did want to know what Ivan thought of that intelligent Being, immeasurably greater than itself, but we are not given a glimpse into that--so that was disappointing. Ivan seems to relate to the humans asking it about God in the same way that Stephen relates to the fools in his world--with martyr like patience and weariness. But I'm doing a bit of my own anthropomorphizing.

There were three key themes in the movie for me, (I suppose these observations qualify as spoilers,) and they were spelled out very clearly in a few scenes. The first one is very early on at a conference. Our protagonist is asked by lecturer Jane Hurst, his future love interest, if the super-intelligent computer software he wrote the source code for can answer the question, ""Does God Exist?"". A woman behind him arrogantly declares, ""I don't need a machine to tell me what I already know."" I see that as the first in a trinity of themes.

Our protagonist stays after the lecture to introduce himself and explains to Jane, played believably by Cate Damon, that her question, ""Does God Exist?"" is on their list of questions for the computer. Unfortunately, before the question can be asked, the computer software gets banned (by stereotypical evil republicans opposed to science, progress, and enlightenment *yawn*). Luckily for us, Stephen has the software and the hardware, Ivan, and sets out to get an answer to the question, along with a wobbly colleague, Alan Moss, who has the conviction of a marshmallow and a book deal in mind. Alan's character is played believably by Jim Lobley. (Ivan is voiced by John Montanari, so it seems people are still needed in the near future when this movie takes place.)

Another key thematic moment comes when our protagonist's vacillating colleague asks, ""How come we're asking a machine that's never felt a thing--never felt love or pain, hunger--never felt faith or a gut instinct--why are we asking it a question about God? Honestly, why are we asking?""

This makes me wonder if the movie doubts its own existence, or at least the purpose for its existence. It also makes me wonder how many people are asking the same question of the movie since it gives no answer. (Not that it realistically can--especially one that will satisfy all viewers.)

The last thematic moment is when an online philosophy teacher says, ""Look, I just want to make a point here. A proper civilization is a tenuous business at best. It is held together as much by myth and wishful thinking as it is by fact and science. So a definitive answer for the question, 'Does God Exist, Yes or No?' ...may not necessarily be the best thing for an organized society. I mean, really, the mystery--personalized by all of us to fulfill our own spiritual needs--maybe that's the best thing after all.""

And that seems to be the conclusion of Ivan and the movie.

I know this movie won't work for a lot of people. It's too slow. There's not really anything ""happening."" It refuses to do the viewers' thinking on this issue, and it refuses to take a firm stand--one way or another--which I'm sure will irritate many. (Just asking the question is enough to irritate a whole bunch of people.) It's a lot of talk, talk, talk. It does have a lot of meat. It just doesn't have any gravy. But it worked for me. I didn't need it to tell me what I already know. I do believe in God, the God of the Bible, and I have many reasons for that--from the prophetic, archaeological, historical, and philosophical, to the scientific evidence, eye-witness testimony from Jesus' disciples, and the born-again experience itself. That's probably some of the same evidence ""Ivan"" would have combed through in an actual search, but we're never really given any evidence for either position. It's more about the human characters trying to convince, or trick, the computer to cooperate. I've watched this movie several times now, but more importantly, I'm still thinking about it days later. I can't say the same for big, Hollywood blockbuster action movies full of special effects, beautiful ""mannequins"", and things being blown to smithereens. I forget about them before I leave the theater. They don't impress me. I was very impressed with this, though. I was impressed with the writing, Stan Freeman, and the directing, Douglas Gordon. I hope they will give us more thought-provoking movies in the future.

In the end, the question, ""Does God Exist?"" is left unanswered.

Maybe it is a matter of faith after all.
