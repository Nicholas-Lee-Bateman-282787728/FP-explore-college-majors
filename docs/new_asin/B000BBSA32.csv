8084888,3,B000BBSA32,"I love gymnastics and was looking forward to seeing it preformed in the nude.  The artsy lighting does not allow one to actually see them perform, clothed or nude.  Mostly you see somebody in a shadow.  Mostly shadow.  Everything seems to be in slow motion.  This gives the picture a jerky motion.  Great idea.  Poor execution.  4.3 out of 10.  The ads at the end were amost the best part.",1370390400,,389,4.442857142857143
8084889,5,B000BBSA32,The title sort of tells all.  I originally got this (years ago) as a video tape and knew that it was good.  So getting it on DVD is even better.  This definitely is exquisite art -- unless you are uncomfortable with the way male humans are shaped.,1357689600,,247,4.212765957446808
8084890,2,B000BBSA32,"Earlier I had seem a clip from this movie showing two gymnasts doing a floor routine nude.  The clip was beautiful showing the muscular movements.  I made the assumption that the rest of the movie would be the same...wrong.  The 5+minute clip was the best out of the whole movie.  Much is done clothed and what is nude, the lighting is so poor that the performance is hardly worth watching.  The concept of the movie is wonderful, delivery is poor at best.  Nice to add to my collection, but really I feel I wasted my money.",1332720000,,524,4.40625
8084891,1,B000BBSA32,"Gymnastikos was very disappointing. The video did have nude gymnasts, however the  lighting was horrendous and the models were always moving too fast for the camera to do justice to a potentially sensual and erotic video. I do not recommend this video.",1255564800,,252,5.0

This DVD is ...well I have given it a one star rating if that tell you anything. Viewing is like through smoke. It is DARK, smokey, or just poorly shot, with low light in most of the video. Lighting seems primarily from behind the subjects. It is a tease, providing only a hint of what could be seen.",1202428800,3,451,6.174603174603175
8084893,2,B000BBSA32,"Hugely disappointed by this item. The picture quality is quite grainy, the lighting terrible, and in terms of ""full nudity""... hardly. Anything you want to see if obscured by shadow much of the time.

The best part of the DVD? The previews of other DVDs from this company at the end!",1200268800,2,283,4.549019607843137
8084894,2,B000BBSA32,"Greenwood filmed true athletes doing gymnastics. But the lighting is so ""creative"" that it fails to present the men anywhere near the excellence their perfect bodies deserves. It is like trying to workout nude in the dark.",1188518400,,222,5.027027027027027
8084895,2,B000BBSA32,"I am dissatisfied with this DVD because all the scene was photographed in a dark room, only with spotlightings. Therefore those details of the body (the shadowy parts, you know) couldn't be seen clearly, though not hidden beneath lycra and tights.",1151971200,3,247,5.048780487804878
8084896,5,B000BBSA32,"My review is based on the VHS version of Gymnastikos, as I have not seen the DVD on sale over here as yet.  I am not sure if the DVD is merely a copy of the video or if there are any 'extras' on offer.  My main complaint about the original is that time is wasted in showing the gymnasts exercising clothed.  That is a small niggle as this is such a wonderful opportunity to view, in all their naked glory, genuine East European gymnasts performing real moves, they are not faked up models.  There are no G-strings, no lycra, no airbrushing and no pixellation, this is the real thing, naked young men exercising and flexing their finely honed muscles without a stich.  In case you are wondering, yes, the camera focuses in and lovingly captures those details usually hidden beneath jock straps and tights.  We get to see torsos, limbs and yes, bare buns and genitals, the latter flopping around gently as the young men do hand stands and take to the rings.  If you are already a lover of Gymnastikos, they you will cherish a copy on DVD.  But just when will it become available?",1150156800,2,1077,4.431472081218274
8084897,5,B000BBSA32,"If you have ever wondered what those super hot gymnastits look without their tights, you have to check this out.  Left me wanting more.",1137196800,4,135,4.625
