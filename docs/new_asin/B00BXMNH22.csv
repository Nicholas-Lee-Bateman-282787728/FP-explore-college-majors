8575121,5,B00BXMNH22,"There is no easy way to help a child understand the complexities of grief, but Professor Child offers an extraordinary approach to guiding the young through this universal experience.  The Children and Grief DVD employs the personal lives of children telling their stories of loss in order to help others move through their own pain and solitude.  I found this DVD incredibly helpful when my own words of comfort for my children ran out. The added workbook proves continuously useful for launching discussions and further reflection.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who parents, teaches, counsels, or leads children.",1394409600,2,623,5.21
