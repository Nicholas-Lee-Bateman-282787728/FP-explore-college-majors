8652961,5,B00JPQ1IJ2,"I never got to see the original airings of ""The Larry Sanders Show"" in the early nineties. They were aired only on HBO at the time. I became a fan of Garry Shandling from his first series on Fox after he got his start on HBO with his self-titled show as well. He was quite funny with a dry wit and knew how to make fun of himself and the world of Los Angeles behind him. With this series, he takes on the late night talk shows especially the battle to succeed Johnny Carson aka King of Late Night television. Anyway, ""The Larry Sanders Show,"" was a superior comedy series in the cable market. Garry Shandling was ideal to play fictional Larry Sanders, a late night talk show host in Los Angeles. He is surrounded by an A-list group of talented actors and actresses like Jeffrey Tambor (who played his sidekick Hank Kingsley); Rip Torn as his producer Arty; Janeane Garofalo (his booking producer); Jeremy Piven (writer); and others.

In one episode, you get plenty of star appearances who mock themselves and the industry itself. The series is without a laugh track which is not so bad. The series covers Larry's first marriage to Megan Gallagher's character in the first season and a new relationship with Kathryn Harrold in the second season. With the exception of offensive language, this series could have aired in primetime. Anyway, the sitcom premise covers a wide variety of problems with guest stars like Elizabeth Ashley, Dana Carvey, Chris Farley, Peter Falk, Burt Reynolds, Jerry Seinfeld, Howard Stern, Dana Delaney, Talia Balsam, Hugh Hefner, John Ritter, Gene Siskel, and more in all its episodes

The first season was only about 13 episodes and the second season has two discs worth of episodes. Still it's a funny show more than 24 years after it first premiered on television. The series was before cell phone and computers and internet. The show reminds me of simpler times. If you're a fan of Jeffrey Tambor, you can see his talent decades before his success and final recognition for his performance in ""Transparent."" I was a fan of Tambor since he was on ""The Ropers.""

With Mill Creek DVDs, there are no special features. The set comes with three DVDs to cover the first two seasons. Unlike network series, this series has fewer episodes.",1456444800,2,2260,4.730964467005077

8652963,4,B00JPQ1IJ2,"I can't quite figure out how the king of cheapo dvd collections (Mill Creek) got the rights to put this out, since the complete set has already been released. But anyway.

The picture quality is very poor since they cram way too many episodes onto each disc, and there are no extras. The packaging is crummy (3 discs on top of each other on the same spindle). Also, I'm not sure but I think some episodes have been edited. If you're serious about loving this show, you're much better off buying the complete set instead of wasting your time with this. The complete set is a good quality product and rich with extra features.

However, if you're checking it out for the first time (or you're on a really tight budget), then this is a reasonable bargain.

When I can afford the real set, this one is going in the trash...but for now, I'm grateful to be able to watch and re-watch the first two terrific seasons for less than ten bucks.

Do I even have to mention how great the show is? It's better than almost anything that has ever been on American tv. See it!",1409443200,10,1059,4.3604060913705585
