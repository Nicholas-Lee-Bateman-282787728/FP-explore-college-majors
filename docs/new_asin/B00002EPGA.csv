1254366,5,B00002EPGA,"This video really is top class, if you have [money] spare, buy this video. I is a must see for all wrestling fans, even if you do not like these two amazing superstars. It shows the long and hard road of getting to the top of the mountin in the World Wrestling Federation that HHH and Chyna have  done. Not only does it show a good story, but it shows a wonderfull tale in  wonderfull context. Overall evaluation: BUY IT!",961113600,3,421,4.25
1254367,2,B00002EPGA,"It's Our Time, featuring wrestlers Hunter Hearst Helmsley and Chyna, definitely did not deliver. Beginning at around the time of his entry into Degeneration X, this video did a horrible job of analyzing Helmsley's  earlier WWF career. The amount of wrestling in the video is also herendous,  considering the fact that ""Triple H"" and Chyna are horrible  wrestlers. The only plus about the video is the excessive amount of  personal information spoken by Helmsley and Chyna themselves.",945302400,4,483,5.233766233766234

7915877,5,B00002EPGA,"Another tape I found in an old box I had full of VHS tapes.  This I think was the first tape where they had wrestlers ""breaking character"" & just like the DX tape, this was uncensored.  It takes on a more serious tone so don't expect girls flashing their boobs or anything but the language is hardcore.  This tape showed both Triple H & Chyna talking about their careers & even life outside the ring as a couple (at the time) such as Triple H talking about his hardcore decidating to weight training & how that started his career.  Of course, they didn't have the WCW footage back then so his run as Jean Paul-Levesque (his real name) in WCW wasn't touched upon.  The infamous ""curtain call"" was talked about and how he was pushed for it until Chyna finally came into the picture and also the behind the scenes story of how all that happened.  The DX run was also talked about in which how they had to push Vince to allow them to push the envelope with it & also how he took control of DX after Shawn retired due to his back and even at times took control when Shawn was around.  Their fued with the Nation is highlighted...including the famous skit where DX did impressions of The Nation & the ""forgotten classic"" ladder match between The Rock & HHH at SummerSlam '98.  The split between HHH & Chyna leading up to WrestleMania XV is glossed over and talks about why Triple H felt he had to turn heel to get to the top of the business.  From there, they talk about Triple H's road to the championship including highlights from the Fully Loaded strap match with The Rock & the SummerSlam match with Steve Austin & Mankind before finally winning the title the next night on RAW.  Chyna's career highlights are also shown throughout this as it shows her way into becoming the first woman to enter the Royal Rumble & also her progress through the King Of The Ring tournament.  verall, it was one of WWF's best home videos from the attitude era but unlike previous WWF VHS videos, I wouldn't wait for this one to come back out on DVD due to Chyna's leaving the WWF on such bad terms & how they already released a Triple H DVD covering some of the same issues that were talked about here.",1157328000,,2182,4.349753694581281
