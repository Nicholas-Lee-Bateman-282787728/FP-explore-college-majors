7759900,5,B01GGE7J70,Very good movie about Iran!,1475020800,,27,4.6
7759901,3,B01GGE7J70,"This was a film I was looking forward to seeing. It is about a Jewish businessman  Isaac (Adrien Brody) who is a successful jeweller. He is married to the wonderful Farnez  Selma Hayek in late 1970s Iran. We get some scene setting but not a lot about the toppling of the Shah and very little about Ayatollah Khomeini; just that The Revolutionary Guard have taken over .

Then the Guard come calling and Isaac is arrested and their whole World goes south in a very bad way. Now this is not a true story it is based on real events and those events are portrayed in a seemingly black and white way that supporters of the Ayatollah will see as very one sided. There is an attempt to balance the books but it sort of lacks credibility. Some of the scenes too were a bit of a stretch  but to say any of the detail could be a plot reveal  which I do not want to do.

The acting is all very good, but there is some unfortunate CGI, blue screen and the period detail is all wrong. They do not have a single Hillman Hunter on the street shots and at the time 90% of all cars were Hunters, they even assembled them there. The action is also very lame and the actions of some of the players lacked all credulity, it was almost sanitised as I remember all too well the carnage that was shown on our screens at the time. It would have been nice to have had a better portrayal of what actually took place to a country that was at a cross roads in its history and some could say is still paying the price today.",1475020800,,1495,4.120274914089347
7759902,5,B01GGE7J70,"Sad movie really... but this has to be the beginnings of the confusion of terminology of what is moslem, terrorism, al qaeda and how the inocent moslem people suffer due to moslem terrorists.",1474848000,,191,4.818181818181818
7759903,3,B01GGE7J70,Parts were hard to follow as storyline seemed disjointed.,1474848000,,57,5.444444444444445
7759904,5,B01GGE7J70,Excellent movie I had never heard of.  I chose it because I am Jewish and I love both the main actors.  It was one of the best movies depicting true events I have seen since Schindler List.  Excellent!!!,1474329600,2,203,4.2894736842105265
7759905,4,B01GGE7J70,great movie but falls flat at the end,1474329600,,37,3.75
7759906,5,B01GGE7J70,"This is a most beautiful but heart-wrenching movie about an upper middle class Jewish family living for generations in Iran and what horrors befall them during and after the revolution - simply because they are Jewish, professionals, and educated.  It is also an excellent look into the thinking of average Iranian people before and after the revolution, something we never saw on the news in US.  The acting is superb, the sets and production perfect.  A good human story though I had to think twice at the end before deciding that ""good"" did in fact triumph.  Not for kids or pre-teens.  Teenagers should be able to handle this, though some (adults, too) may choose or need to look away at times, even though the torture scenes are not too explicit but rely more on actors.",1474243200,2,775,4.711111111111111
7759907,2,B01GGE7J70,"It was too difficult to get beyond Hayek, and Brody's' terrible Iranian (Farsi) accents. It seems like it might have been a compelling story except that the leads were miscast. As usual in any movie with Iranian characters (""House of Sand and Fog, Crash, etc)  Shohreh Aghdashloo always gives a stunning performance as the ""Iranian mother figure.""

I do not mean to make light of this serious subject matter, nor of the authors story, but I wish it had been better cast.",1473811200,,470,4.719512195121951
7759908,4,B01GGE7J70,"The movie was good and I liked it, but not sure about Salma's performance. I like her as an actress, but not this time. Everyone else was great. The main prison guy performed very well. First I hated him as a guard and than liked him as a person who went through torture in the past. In general,I recommend the movie.",1473724800,2,317,4.213114754098361

7759913,4,B01GGE7J70,"This was an excellent movie, I just wish the Shiraz family had left Iran when you could drive to the airport, book a plane, and go. But what happened to them happens to many, a revolution comes and you don't realize it until it's too late. The film does have a happy ending, although I wish they had told us where the Shiraz family ended immigrating to.

What was most interesting was how the man's own employees ended up stealing from him, how he was betrayed by the people he helped when they had nothing. It also shows the problems of class warfare, such as the Muslim maid who tells them that her son told her ""why should some live like kings and others like rats."" What a load of crap, in every economic system there's going to be winners and losers, people on top, middle, and bottom. Who said life was fair? I went to college, then a trade school, then I made my dream come true of getting a job in advertising and it was a nightmare. Now I'm 41, I work from home, yet do I hate those who became Creative Directors and now drive BMW's? Do I resent them because they get to fly to Cannes to accept their gold lions? No, I don't. I'm simply doing other things.

Too bad Iranians replaced the Shah with Islamic barbarism. Too bad they rejected our superior western values and way of life. I guess some animals are destined to remain animals.",1473033600,,1345,4.312252964426878

  ""People are often unreasonable, irrational, and self-centered.  Forgive them anyway.

  If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives.  Be kind anyway.

  If you are successful, you will win some unfaithful friends and some genuine enemies.  Succeed anyway.

  If you are honest and sincere people may deceive you.  Be honest and sincere anyway.

  What you spend years creating, others could destroy overnight.  Create anyway.

  If you find serenity and happiness, some may be jealous.  Be happy anyway.

  The good you do today, will often be forgotten.  Do good anyway.

  Give the best you have, and it will never be enough.  Give your best anyway.

  In the final analysis, it is between you and God.  It was never between you and them anyway.""
