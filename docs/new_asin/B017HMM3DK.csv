8739305,3,B017HMM3DK,"The DVD consists of 2 discs with anthologies. One is ""Sinister Vision"" and the other is ""Bordello of Death""

Sinister Visions:

This film consists of 5 separate horror film shorts.

. The second feature is a dark comedy zombie film which will remind the viewer of ""Fido."" The special effects and acting are acceptable for this type of feature. The main problem I have with this film is that it turns horror into pornography. One of the things that has happened in our society, reflective in our films, is the instant gratification. Both adult films and action films have essentially eliminated plot, drama, characterization, theme, metaphors, and cinematography for the sake the continual climax scene. In this regard, the features in this film go straight to that horror scene. ""A Woman Scorned"" epitomizes this as it opens with a nude woman tied to a table. She dared to date a woman's former husband. There was no build up of any kind. The films are for people who desire instant horror gratification, those who want to watch the shower scene in ""Psycho"" but nothing leading up to it....still the features weren't bad, just short. Good make-up job on the Succubus. ""Genital Genocide"" was a waste.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Tori Montgomery, Pamela Ricardo, Kat Herlo, Mette Lvendahl, Andrea Santos,)

Bordello of Death:

This is three separate tales connected by an unusual bordello run my Madam Raven (Natalie Milner). The stories are short with no character build up and not much plot. The ""twists"" were not great and in this type of tale, that is a must. I would say the first story was my favorite, but none were serious standouts.
