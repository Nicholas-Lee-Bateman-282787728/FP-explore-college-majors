3630521,5,B001HM2CC4,"Remember when AMC (formerly American Movie Classics) used to actually show movies (and without commercials)? This DVD takes us back to 2004 when, like Turner Movie Classics, the cable channel showed quality films as well as specially produced documentaries. Thanks to Koch and their Koch Lorber Films division, the superb film has a new life. And it belongs in every 20th century history course - in high school as well as college - as well as every film-making course.

The 92-minute film - directed by Daniel Anker, and narrated by Gene Hackman - begins years before the Holocaust with Warner Brothers' films - many recently reissued as part of their ""Gangster"" series - on prejudice against the Jews in the US. And then we are up to Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" and Jack Benny as Hitler in ""To Be Or Not To Be"".

Then comes the Holocaust and the end of World War II. But it isn't until President Eisenhower sends 16 Hollywood moguls to Germany to see the horrors in the concentration camps, that films start to be made to educate Americans about the atrocities and tell the story.

With interviews with stars and Directors, Producers and scriptwriters and film historians (all listed in an earlier review on this site, so I won't list again), and SIGNIFICANT footage from the more recent films and TV mini-series (most notably the 30-hour-long ""War and Remembrance"" (1988), the story is graphically told. I did not remember how graphic some of the recreated scenes in the ""W&R"" series was, but it really grabs you and won't let go.

With the cooperation of the ""A"" list of Hollywood directing and producing community, the is certainly the best documentary on the subject I have seen and the video and film clips are in pristine condition.

There are no special features, but you'll be thinking about the scenes you've seen for hours after you've turned off your TV.

HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!

3630522,5,B001HM2CC4,"I found this documentary to be a compelling watch. It begins with an explanation for the lack of portrayal in Hollywood movies about the rising Nazi threat back in the early 1940s. The reason for this was due to the fact that Germany accounted for 10% of Hollywood's foreign market. But economics wasn't the only reason for the dearth of anti-Nazi depictions in movies made by Hollywood. There was quite a bit of anti-semitism within the US itself - e.g. the Ku Klux Klan and the German Bunde [sic], an organization that was based in the US and represented the interests of the sizable German population in the States did not want to see attacks on Hitler or the Nazis.

Yet, there were some compelling portrayal of life under the Nazis and how it affected the Jews. Movies like The Mortal Storm with Jimmy Stewart told the story of a respectable, upper middle class Jewish family in Germany and how the anti-semitic movement in Germany under Hitler and the Nazis affects them. There are also movies like The great Dictator starring Charlie Chaplin [who funded the movie himself], playing dual roles of a Jewish barber and a parody of Hitler. It was in the Great Dictator that the word ""Jew"" is first referenced in a Hollywoood production [even in the Mortal Storm, the phrase ""non-Aryan"" is used when referencing Jews].

This is a well-researched documentary and for someone like me who is keen on anything to do with the Holocaust and WW II history, I found it to be a minefield of interesting historical facts and trivia. I made a list of classic movies that I plan to look up and add to my library - movies like ""To Be or Not to Be"", starring Carole Lombard [a comedic attack on Nazi ideology], None Shall Escape [1944], The Search [1948], and Singing in the Dark [1956].

Besides covering the classic movies dealing with the Holocaust, there are also references to more contemporary productions such as Schindler's List, Sophie's Choice, War and Remembrance [1988 mini-series], and of course Holocaust [1978 mini-series].

A must-watch documentary for those interested in the Holocaust and Hollywood's depiction of it through the years.",1229299200,11,2141,4.825613079019074

Story line and plot, This is what Hollywood needed to do -and what not- to expose Nazi Germany's intentions --- It is a well-documented film with great interviews and original footage to prove that cinema can be used to fight for the right and wrong of world events --- In my book this is a great film to illustrate how everyone turned their back on what Hitler was doing against the Judaism --- Nevermore, please --- Some of the raw footage is missing when American troops discovered the death camps --- However, the narration accomplished the feelings of those who were watching back then --- Produced for the cable television network American Movie Classics, Imaginary Witness: Hollywood and the Holocaust was premiered at the 2004 Tribeca Film Festival.

8308937,4,B001HM2CC4,"A moving and thoughtful testament to how the Nazi genocide has been portrayed in American film and television.

A must-see, with two caveats:

First, most of the movies and TV programs mentioned in this documentary are either completely unavailable or are being scalped for exorbitant prices so that very few will be able to see them. War And Remembrance for example, is only available on Amazon for $166. This is unconscionable..

Second, this documentary does not mention the growing number of Holocaust deniers who claim that it either never happened or has been greatly exaggerated. I have heard Rush Limbaugh, for example, insist that probably only a few hundred thousand were killed, and that the gas chambers an ovens are a hoax invented by Jewish liberals after the war. They maintain also that much of the film footage was faked. This view is shared by many others in right-wing media, and a growing number of Americans, especially young people, are adopting.",1470528000,,968,5.0
8308938,5,B001HM2CC4,I had watched this video on Amazon Prime previously and decided to buy it.  This is a really good picture of how Hollywood and the Holocaust are related.  Anyone interested in Hollywood history or Holocaust history should watch it.,1421193600,,231,4.897435897435898

8308940,4,B001HM2CC4,"This is intended to be an educational vs. entertaining movie.  But the subject of Hollywood and the Holocaust is very complex, tied up as it is with pre-WWII US foreign policy, with Hollywood self-regulation, with the backgrounds of the leaders of the Hollywood studio, their interrelationships, and their inner conflicts, with the politics of some of the more influential Hollywood stars, and with the economics of the film industry.  The movie touches on most of these topics but does not go deep enough into any of them to be truly satisfying.",1403136000,,546,4.989010989010989
8308941,5,B001HM2CC4,"This movie follows hollywood's depiction and evolution in storytelling about the holocaust. Each decade was different in the approach that the studios followed and it took decades for this painful subject to be truly engrained in the worlds psyche. Hollywood and the tv series 'holocaust' are directly responsible for the massive awareness the world has now about the subject too. It wasn't easy for them to get to that point but after the series it became ok really for people to discuss the subject even with survivors.  It shows how each decade dealt with the subject and how they avoided it until the 1970's often. But landmark films like 'the pawnbroker' and 'anne franks diary' among others did deal with the subject. The 'pawnboker' really had scenes from tha camps in it. The classic 'judgement at nuremburg' take was also well done but centered on the allies in some ways. the 30 epsisode 'war and rememberance' really did a great job of showing shocking slaughter scenes that featured full nudity and this had never been allowed on tv before. It must be said that b movies even in the 1940's were really addressing the subject and of course 'the great dictator' which was the first film to use the word 'jew' in it! What a classic that  one was. This covers many films and both applauds and condemns the way film has shown the holocaust. However I didn't know that HALF the country watched the 1978 miniseries 'holocaust' and that in germany it made such a impact that they extended war crimes trial to this day. THe film is narratored by gene hackman and he keeps the films tone well paced. If you are interested in film history , or just the holocaust this is worth your viewing, It has many interviews from Hollywood actors and directors including steven spielburg as well as real survivors of the holocaust. There are many clips from various movies in this one and that is what you'd expect.",1346630400,,1905,4.700598802395209
8308942,4,B001HM2CC4,"Interesting analysis of the way Hollywood has dealt with the Holocaust, and some of the way it has failed to do so. Early anti-Nazi films, often condemned as violating America's supposed neutrality, then newsreels and propaganda films once we were in it, and the powerful message of film taken at the liberated death camps.

Scenes from some of the most powerful films are included, including ""Gentleman's Agreement"" and ""The Great Dictator,"" along with some interesting insights into the history of the film industry over the critical period. Also included are some scenes which tended to trivialize the Nazi era, including ""The Producers"" and ""Caberet.""

There was also an interesting parallel drawn between ""Roots"" and ""The Holocaust,"" both TV miniseries which were very successful but also raised controversy. I also learned enough about ""Shindler's List"" (about which I knew little) and ""Sophie's Choice"" (which I had read when it was new, before the film was made) to decide I wanted to see them too.

In spite of the horrible topic, this is not really a depressing film. It's about the integrity of the film makers, and indeed the courage they showed in bringing aspects of the truth home to American and world audiences. And it's about the survivors; to me, it's mostly about the survivors.",1336867200,,1298,5.05607476635514
8308943,5,B001HM2CC4,"This was a sensitively done, fascinating look at Hollywood's protrayal of the Holocaust from the early 1930's into the 2000's.  It was interesting to see the evolution of America's understanding of Nazism and the Holocaust reflected in film.  We journeyed rom a naive, simplistic and humorous view of Hitler and Nazism in the early 1930's, to placation and tolerance in the mid 30's, to a head-in-the-sand ignorance of the scope of atrocities that were occuring in Europe in America's pre-war days in 1939-1941.

When the war broke out, and after the shocking footage from the liberation of Bergen-Belsen was shown to Hollywood's elite, they struggled to portray the Holocaust in a way that balanced the truth with content that would be palatable to the American mass audience.  This struggle continues today.

I would highly recommend this documentary to anyone interested in learning more about America's knowledge (or ignorance) of, and reaction to, the Holocaust.  It's extremely engaging and engrossing; the short hour-and-a-half runtime will fly by.",1335916800,,1055,5.325301204819277
8308944,5,B001HM2CC4,"I just wanted to add briefly, that this truly excellent documentary is in fact encoded RC0, NOT RC1. It plays perfectly on RC2, RC1 and codefree devices.",1278460800,,153,4.703703703703703
8308945,4,B001HM2CC4,"""Imaginary Witness"" is an interesting although somewhat slight documentary about how Hollywood films have dealt with the Holocaust.  The documentary starts with the 1920s and discusses the uneasy relationship between Hollywood studios, which were run largely by Jewish Americans, and Germany, which was an eager consumer of films, contributing up to 10% of American film studio's grosses.  The Jewish-led studios were nervous about offending Germany while also wanting to avoid anti-semitism in the United States and accusations of bias, so negative depictions of Germany and later Hitler were rare in Hollywood films until the U.S. entered WWII.

Even during the war, films often avoided addressing issues of the Holocaust directly; for example, one of the most daring anti-Nazi films of the time, ""The Mortal Storm,"" never used the term ""Jew"" at all!  After the war, the studio heads toured Germany and filmed the death camps, playing the footage as newsreels before films.  At that point, they really lead the way in terms of speaking of the Holocaust, yet it would be decades before Hollywood films tackled the topic fully. Using interviews with top Hollywood filmmakers such as Sidney Lumet and Steve Spielberg, ""Imaginary Witness"" explores the reasons for this lag.

Although there have been dozens of documentaries in recent years that have explored seemingly more ""important"" aspects of the Holocaust, ""Imaginary Witness"" makes an intriguing argument.  To wit, most American's understanding of the Holocaust is vis a vis films!  How many of us think of ""Schindler's List,"" for example, when we think of Nazi atrocities?  For many of us, our personal connections to the Holocaust are through Hollywood films.  The newsreel footage shows nameless thousands of victims, but our connection is stronger to someone like Meryl Streep's character in ""Sophie's Choice"" because we know her story.  The specific is always more powerful than the general, and Hollywood films have, for better or worse, usually supplied our ""specifics"" with regard to the Holocaust.  I ended up learning a great deal more from this documentary than I anticipated, even though I had seen most of the Hollywood films it discusses - ""Imaginary Witness"" is a well-crafted documentary.",1262822400,3,2258,5.329577464788732
