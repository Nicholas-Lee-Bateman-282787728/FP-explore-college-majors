6877236,5,B00QMW3SVS,"This is a well produced, entertaining, and informative history of rock climbing in Yosemite Valley.

I climbed there in the mid to late '70s, know this history well and I think they got it right. Excellent archival images and footage, great interviews with many of the historic figures and the up to date stuff showing extreme free climbing and free soloing on big walls is timely given what Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson have just accomplished on the Dawn Wall on El Capitan.

If you're a Yosemite climber from any part of it's history, you'll enjoy this excellent documentary.",1421280000,5,582,4.8686868686868685
6877237,1,B00QMW3SVS,"I bought this DVD after really enjoying ReelRock.
But the DVD stops working about halfway through (stone masters part).
Unfortunately, I missed the return date.  Make sure to try out the DVD before the 30-day return period runs out!!!",1434931200,,234,5.0
6877238,1,B00QMW3SVS,While a somewhat interesting history i was seriously disappointed.  Too little climbing footage.  Too many left out.  Not much depth in the interviews.  Enjoy it for what it is - about a half dozen venti coffees and not much more.,1434931200,,230,4.675
6877239,4,B00QMW3SVS,"This was a fun watch, with cool production techniques and footage. I wasn't overwhelmed with awesomeness though- this seemed to be aimed toward a more general audience than for climbing nuts, and I already knew most of this stuff. I'd still recommend watching it, especially if you plan on subjecting friends/family/loved ones to your climbing obsession- this film is perfect.",1433721600,,376,5.283333333333333

6877244,5,B00QMW3SVS,Great movie!!,1424649600,,13,6.0
6877245,5,B00QMW3SVS,"Sensational documentary about amazing people devoting their lives to rock climbing in the most iconic of places; The great walls of Yosemite. For all of the valley's world class climbers and dirt-bags, climbing is not just a sport, but a metaphor for living. And the evolution of climbing in Yosemite serves as a metaphor for shifts in our culture from the 60s till today. This film captures all this in a coherent, compelling, exciting and beautiful way. Highly recommended for any viewer, outdoor athlete or not.",1423785600,3,514,4.988372093023256

8692137,4,B00QMW3SVS,"I hope people READ this review and don't just look at the stars. As far as the MOVIE goes,  I'd give it 6 stars! Best history and very well done mixing video with animated stills that add a lot of life to the otherwise lifeless still shots.

HOWEVER, just as I read in a few other reviews, I've now bought THREE of these DVDS and they all LICK UP just over 20 minutes into the movie! On the first one, Camp4, the seller replied with some BS line that 3-5% ov DVDs have problems in the recording process. They were easy to return to, but YOU MUST RETURN WITHIN 30 DAYS, OR YOU'RE SOL!  I'm glad I read the reviews where people got burned by THAT.

So, I'm going to try another seller.  The movie is great, the quality, or sourde of the mfg process is lacking.",1494028800,,758,4.129251700680272
