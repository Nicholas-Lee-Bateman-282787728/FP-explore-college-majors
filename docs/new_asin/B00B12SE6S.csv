8560484,5,B00B12SE6S,"""Coin Toss"" is a heartwarming film in every sense.  It renders a wonderful love story shaped by luck and the coincidental nature of life.  As you watch this delightful independent film by Satya Kharkar, you can't help but to root for the protagonist Tom Benett who confronts and triumphs over various difficulties due to his good nature.  What I especially love about this film is its soft sense of humor and its interesting plot.  ""Coin Toss"" is a perfect example of how Independent Cinema provides a creative outlet for local directorial talent.  This lovely movie definitely gets a thumbs up from me.",1370563200,2,603,4.872549019607843
