Lets clear this up I don't work for the company, I own the product and have the original shipping box to prove it and two I made a comment as to the motherboard Ethernet board failed and needed to be replaced to prove it wasn't a perfect. The product has pluses and minuses but in the end I was somewhat happy I did feel if an article is sold to add a second video card they should sell the card or offer to buy back instead they just bailed on the entire option",1520553600,,594,4.0

6168721,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Furious 7 is great. It has lots of action, unstop, lots of very pretty half-dressed girls, many chases, men fighting men hand to hand and with all kinds of weapons, women fighting women hand to hand, lots of impossible feats made possible somehow, some sentimentality, and much destruction - it seems that an entire city is destroyed. Viewers who like this kind of action will thrill while watching this film.
The crew had hurt the younger brother of an ex-British special ops agent who was so lethal the British retired him. This is Jason Statham. Jason decides to get revenge, to kill the entire team. They need to find him and stop him.
Meanwhile, the US government tells Vin Diesel that if he and his team will get a computer drive back to the government, the government will lend it to the team to help find Jason. The task given them seems impossible  thats why the government had to turn to the team.",1514764800,,907,4.564417177914111

6168733,5,B00HLTD8RA,"My favorite out of all the Fast & Furious movies, the final film in the franchise with Paul Walker (R.I.P.) is exciting, and full of the family moments that make this franchise great. The ending, while pretending to be the crew accepting the character Brian commiting to the family life as a House-Husband, they are actually saying goodbye to Paul Walker, who tragically died before filming was complete. Still, his brother stepped in to be the body double and they CGI'd his face on, so they can film Paul's Final scenes, and honestly, that final beach scene made everyone in my theater weep, because they all knew what it really meant.

Goodbye, Paul",1511827200,2,652,4.769911504424779

6168859,3,B00HLTD8RA,The Blu-ray is great but the movie itself is a total mess. The sad death of actor Paul Walker definitely shows in this movie with obvious signs of reshoots and really bad cgi mapping over stunt doubles faces for Walker. The action is fun but after a while you get exhausted knowing they added more and more to make up for the lack of real scenes with Paul Walker. It just feels fractured to me.,1505692800,,394,4.266666666666667

After Han gets kicked at the end of 6 (picking up where his death in Tokyo Drift left off), Dom and the crew get together to find his killer (Jason Statham) and avenge his death. They add Kurt Russell to the cast and The Rock returns for a blockbuster showdown. All action on top of death defying stunts that will keep you on edge every turn.",1498348800,,416,4.2125

6169116,5,B00HLTD8RA,"The 5th movie in the series was a sort of reboot and had a clever ending introducing a new character. In the 6th we said goodbye to another and welcomed one back. In the 7th we said another good bye and just when you thought they'd done it all it gets even more intense. I won't spoil it for others, but this was the movie in which Paul Walker had been killed in real life and it was amazing that they were able to get the movie out. There are some very memorable lines from the movie, among my favorites are:

Brian to Dom: ""Cars don't fly""
Dom to Letty: Its about time
And Dominick's thoughts at the end (a tribute to Paul Walker):  No matter where you are, whether it's a quarter-mile away or halfway around the world, you'll always be with me and you'll always be my brother

I can't wait for the next installments in the long running series. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.",1496275200,2,886,4.1395348837209305

6169336,5,B00HLTD8RA,"This review will focus on the Sound an Video rather than the movie itself -

This set includes a 4K UHD disc, 1080p Blu-Ray disc and an Ultraviolet copy (which I believe also redeems in UHD). The UHD disc requires an ""Ultra HD Blu-Ray"" player. My copy also include a coupon for a free ticket to The Fate of the Furious (Fast & The Furious 8). For the current price of 20-bucks, it's a great set.

With most recent titles being a 2k upscale to 4k, I've found there to be an upgrade.. but a small one. This set has a surprisingly noticeable upgrade in 4K. When viewed on an OLED TV, the colors and clarity really stood out over the already very-good Blu-Ray disc. Video shows a small amount of grain/noise, but it's all nicely done. The sound is a bit of a controversy as it's lossy.. but on my (non-atmos) receiver it sounded great. Lots of punch and clear surround.

Overall, highly recommended set. After recent disappointing 4K discs or minimal upgrades, this was a great treat!",1491609600,,980,4.4636871508379885

I was saddened by the loss of this handsome young actor and decided to buy this, his last movie.  There is an over abundance of action, so much that you have to suspend your idea of reality and just kick back and enjoy.  Flying cars and explosions abound, as well as bullets and martial art fights--its all there.  Oh, yeah, attractive men as well.  I know they had to use stand-ins for Paul's character in some of the scenes, but it was very hard to tell.  There is some suggestive language but no sex scenes.  Dom's girlfriend is a Tough Chick who runs around with a sour expression all through the movie, like she bit into a sour grape.  Mostly this is just a roaring good romp.  I just ordered the set of F&F--I guess I am a convert!",1490313600,2,879,4.178571428571429

This Fast & Furious film has everything a viewer would want to see minus all the bloody scenes that typically accompany films of this nature. In addition, I thought the success of this film was largely due to the adept cast. A must watch film in the Fast & Furious series, but especially if you're new to the franchise itself!

I've watched every entry in the series and I just can't do it anymore.  1st-genuinely good, 2nd-terrible, 3rd-probably the best, 4th through 6th-morphed into a summer popcorn flick but it worked. Which leaves us with this dud; stealth choppers in LA? Check! Dialogue that says ""oh no, they have armor piercing rounds"" that literally bounce off said armored vehicle? Yup! More explosions than a Michael Bay movie? Of course! Re-using scenes from prior movies? Sure! At this point it's clear that they've run out of any semblance of coherent ideas and just keep throwing stuff against the wall.  Honestly, 15 year old me would think this movie was terrible; that said the best part of the movie was the ending tribute.  At least they got that part right.",1483747200,,759,4.8604651162790695

It's mostly a made for TV soap opera as just about ever scene has 5-7 characters in frame, the most unoriginal and unbelievable story, and computer generated car chase stuff that while looks great is not the same as the real thing.  I fast forwarded through it after the first 15 minutes.  This movie really shouldn't have been made.",1483315200,,402,4.7

6170758,5,B00HLTD8RA,"This is the best movies of the Fast and Furious series. One reason is the tribute to Paul Walker at the end of the movie. Also the cars are amazing.
 One reason that this movie is so great is the.tribute to Paul Walker at the end. In the tribute it was Paul Walker and they played little clips from all of the Fast and Furious movies, and at the very end they put in big bold letters For Paul against a white backround, and it was an amazing tribute to Paul Walker.
 Another reason why this is a great movie is the cars are amazing until they get destroyed. On of the cars that stands out to me is the, 1970 Dodge Charger R/T is a stunning car that has 426 Hemi with a supercharger and a BDS blower,, And the 1995 Toyota Supra MKIV that Paul drove in the end of the movie. It is a beautiful car.
Overall Furious 7 is the best in the Fast and Furious franchise. With the cars and the tribute to Paul the movie in my opinion the best out of all of the Furious movies.",1474243200,,965,3.994818652849741

6170786,3,B00HLTD8RA,"Now see, I loved this franchise. I loved it even when people say that ""they are just beating the dead horse with the next movie coming out"". However, this movie has drawn far away from anything car related. They will throw scenes in that don't really even make sense to the plot, just because there are fast cars in it and girls in skirts.
I've purchased the ""6 DVD set"" of the first 6 movies and watched it tenfold. I've prolong myself watching this due to the tragic loss of Paul (which I perhaps conspire that he is still alive, and it was part of the promotion to help justify this movie), and I knew out was going to be sad. This is perhaps the only reason why it has any stars: it does a great job of sending him off and to rest easy.",1473724800,,740,4.110344827586207

Hope they don't make anymore...Vin Diesel is NOT a good actor, and needs to find something else to do with his life in my opinion. He may be eye candy for some women (not me), so maybe modeling would be better, or a fitness host? Predictable movie. Not worth the new release price.",1468540800,,457,4.264367816091954

6171196,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen. This definitely is the best Fast and the Furious movie to date and Furious 8 will have a lot of hype to beat this. This one takes both Fast 6 and Tokyo Drift and puts them under one character, Deckard Shaw. He's the older brother of the villain from Fast 6 and also the guy who hits and burns Han's car at the end of Tokyo Drift. He attacks Toretto and the gang while also putting Hobbes in the hospital. This has so much action and the fact they came back to California where it all began makes a good sequence of storyline. The end is also a great tribute to Paul Walker.",1467158400,,625,4.048387096774194

6171572,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Excellent movie with a talented cast. I have enjoyed the sequels of this movie; although this was very emotional watching knowing that Paul Walker will no longer be a part of the sequels. I loved the last scene of him driving off in one direction and Vin Diesel in the other......tears, tears, tears:(",1463097600,,301,4.69811320754717
6171573,1,B00HLTD8RA,"Okay, I'll be honest - if I hadn't got this movie in a box set I probably wouldn't have bothered to watch it at all. But I did so I did and here's what I think...

Firstly this is the 7th movie in the franchise of Fast and Furious. The movie itself it dedicated to Paul Walker (plays Brian) who died in a car crash during a break from the filming. At this point let me state that if I didn't know the movie wasn't finished I wouldn't have guessed - it is fairly difficult to pick out when it is Paul vs stand-in - so that was obviously done well. This movie picks up with Han dead in Tokyo and Dom bringing him home to bury - at the same time we are introduced to a new bad-guy (the brother of the one from no 6 who also isn't really dead). I can't really say much more for the plot because over the course of the almost 2 1/2 hours my attention wasn't held..oh, the Letty and Dom on-off thing was frustrating and was like watching teenagers who needed to grow up.

What's wrong with the movie? Where do I start...There are far too many characters who aren't needed. This movie could have been completed without Hobbs at all or Elena. The movie goes from one bang-crash to another with no one suffering any bad injuries...really it was like they were all super-human. It was distracting. This series was good because people liked the humaness of the characters. This movie is just a disaster from beginning to end. I won't be watching the next....3 that are supposed to be made unless they cull the characters, get a plot that makes sense, and hold back on the CGI effects.",1463097600,,1573,4.25752508361204

6172507,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Furious 7 is the latest installment of the Fast and the Furious series and the classic go-for-broke mentality follows the films that preceded it in the series, however, it seemed this movie had much more to offer than the on screen story. Part way through the film, Paul Walker was killed in a devastating car accident which shook the movies production all together. With the help of computer graphics and Walkers younger brothers Caleb and Cody, Furious 7 was finally brought to fruition on the big screen.
Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is a man who thrives off of strong faith, will, and family as he sets out to protect the ones he loves the most throughout the film as an act of revenge. The movie jumps out of the gate with the surprising death of Han (Sung Kang), one of the main characters from previous films in the series, and an explosion at the Los Angeles home of Toretto and his longtime friend Brian OConnor (Paul Walker). The acts of terror are brought to the big screen by an Englishman named Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), whose main objective was to find Toretto and his entourage, who through brute force put DSS agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne The Rock Johnson) in the hospital for a majority of the movie to get necessary information seeing as Hobbs and Toretto worked together closely in the last film. As a result, Toretto assembles his team of old friends and battles for his threatened manhood, and safety.
Dwayne Johnson brings to life the role of Hobbs through his built frame and serious attitude which brings a much needed presence to this opening hand to hand combat scene. This antagonist role is played by Jason Statham wonderfully with his emotionless expressions and raspy voice that gives viewers the chill down their spine that an enemy should evoke.
Like any other Fast and Furious installment, this one comes with plenty of action scenes packed with unique camera tricks that director James Wan made good use of in previous films he directed including the Insidious films, and The Conjuring. The action of this movie really gave Wan the ability to use his camera tricks to his advantage and give the movie an extra dynamic that was visually appealing to the viewer while keeping them on their toes.
The plot of this film is so vast and action packed that its difficult to fully encompass, although the plot doesnt matter much with these films. The main objective of the Fast and Furious films is to throw its audience into an action packed, memorable chapter in the lives of Dominic Toretto and his family, which is the money making line when it comes to the main group of actors whose appearances can be found throughout all seven movies. This unity of having so many memories throughout the whole series really makes the family concept believable throughout Furious 7 and the solid two hours and twenty minutes the movie decides to fill with visually appealing settings, cars, and action.
The final scene of Furious 7 is a very touching tribute to the late Paul Walker, which will bring any big fan of Paul Walker and the series to tears. The film shows flashbacks to prior films that involved Diesel and Walker and features an overhead shot of the twos cars going their separate ways on a dividing highway. With Walker appearing in 6 of the 7 films, he was the centerpiece of the series and a very emotional tribute featuring outstanding flashbacks was the best way for Furious 7 to end. Knowing that this was the last time you would see Paul hanging off of a cliff, holding onto a bus for dear life, or seeing him grip the racing wheel of a European tuner one last time as Brian really made the experience a special one for fans everywhere.",1456185600,,3673,4.669753086419753

6173358,3,B00HLTD8RA,"Great film, if you are a 17 year old-never-had-a-real-date-with-no-life-WWE-fanboy male who is delusional enough to believe he would ever actually stand a chance dating one of the many scantily clad women in this film, who chokes his cat while fantasizing about impossibly tricked out cars he will never drive let alone ever own, who believes The Scorpion King really was a historical figure, and who aspires to be the best Call of Duty player on the planet as his one, all time, great achievement in life, and could care less about smart writing, real storylines of any depth, or any decent acting. Otherwise, the production qualities of the film are on par with the best money can buy in Hollywood for a major studio action film, ... ample amounts of action-fight scenes, stellar -although impossibly unrealistic -stunt/action scenes, great locations, good visuals, on target, high energy modern music score, and pretty decent editing .... in short, pretty much what one who is a typical fan of such movies, in it's target demographic, might expect. In that regard, if you liked all the other films in this franchise, you are likely to enjoy this one, ... really, this should have been marketed as Science Fiction and Fantasy, though, for it's many totally impossible stunt and action sequences. For this genre of film, you get what you pay for, if it's your kind of thing, and you don't mind totally nonsensical scenarios that demand you not only suspend disbelief, but actually abandon all conscious thought, then you won't be disappointed with this film. Hey, it's Vin Diesel and The Rock, ... what do you expect?",1453766400,,1618,4.930402930402931

The action in the movie is awesome, and of course the cars who can forget the cars!!! Dominick's car in the movie is probabaly my favorite. This movie is a MUST SEE!!",1452988800,,399,4.0

6173833,2,B00HLTD8RA,"Let me tell you why it's a 2 star. The only reason i gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is because Paul Walker died and I feel bad for him, his friends, and his family, but this movie was garbage. If they jumped out of one more building or fell down a mountain and survived for the 100th time I was so done. Don't even get me started with this because it was annoying when somehow when the Rock was ready to go he flexed with his BROKEN ARM and the cast just broke off, then literally 10 minutes after he broke his arm he lifts a 1000lb piece of concrete off of Vin Diesel. Now comes to the concrete part, I mean really?? He created enough force to make the parking garage just collapse while it was crumbling????? I mean really come on man I'm not asking for much but when Fast 5 came out and they were pulling the huge vault down the street I thought it couldn't get more unrealistic than that, but hey I guess the only reason people thought this movie was good was because Paul Walker died",1452902400,,984,4.051282051282051

6174755,1,B00HLTD8RA,"What happened here?  I laughed out loud after Vin Diesel's first line, both the writing and his delivery were so incredibly bad.  I think the first twenty minutes are worth watching just because you will not believe what a self-parody this ""action"" film is.  It is strangely to films, the first half ending after a miserably filmed car sequence and moving to ""the Middle East"" and then ending with a shootout that was aborted at the beginning.  Actions films like these are always preposterously implausible.  That is part of the fun of watching them.  I liked the Fast and Furious 1-3 even before it became Fast and Furious (those articles in front of the adjectives just took up too much space).  But Furious7 actually takes it itself seriously, so seriously that I could not help laughing over and over again.  It does all the terrible things it does on purpose.  I figured once the car porn stuff got started about 30 minutes, all of the heavy, melodramatic bilge would just go away and we'd have car porn for the rest of the film.  But no.  All of the bogus heavy-handed romance of the first 30 minutes comes back until the car porn starts up again.  And in the second part, there are two car jumps, one right after the other, just as there are two title sequences at the beginning of the film and then two songs to transition between the two halves.  Someone really meant to design this film this exact way.  Either that or the writer and director were acting some kind of death drive, a repetition compulsion.  This film actually feels like it is itself a videogame, as if the acting and pacing were timed to make the actors look and sound like robots.  Kurt Russell does manage to shine through.",1451174400,,1703,4.552631578947368

6175146,5,B00HLTD8RA,"""Furious 7"" is a non-stop thrill ride that delivers on every front.  Diesel and crew are back on the job in more exotic locales (this time Abu Dhabi).  I especially enjoyed the cameo by Ronda Rousey. It's great to see an action-adventure film that makes the women as badass as the men. Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) may have lost her memory but none of her hot-as-heck (and I'm a woman!) swagger and kick-butt ability, although I was somewhat disappointed in Jordana Brewster's lesser role (perhaps she was too busy with ""Dallas'?) The story never bogs down and moves seamlessly, and even the most unbelievable stunts are so well done that the viewer feels the experience.

7 manages to pay tribute to its losses without becoming maudlin.  Lost characters Han and Gisele get a moving farewell, and of course the ending tribute to Paul Walker had my whole cinema in tears. This was beautifully done and fans must applaud the cast's decision not to take the easy way out and simply kill off his character. Can't wait for 8!",1450224000,,1018,4.734463276836158

It was action packed hey is some of this unrealistic of course but it worked for the avengers it worked for fast and furious. I think it would of been better if Pauls character died at the end because it would made the tribute more interesting . but I still love the song and terrific ending. Paul and the cast gave powerful performances in this film. I will say that Paul impact on the film show he was very loved and will be so missed not only to his cast mates but to the entire world.

I thought the way they paid tribute to Mr. Walker was classy in that it portrayed him as a loving father with a vision toward the future.
The story was fairly well told with a few lapses in anything resembling reality or physics, but was fun, none-the-less.
It was worth the Cyber-Monday money I spent on it (but I don't think I would pay over $15 for it),

Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) wants revenge after what Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Dom (Vin Diesel) did to his brother Owen (Luke Evans).
  Dom and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) drive to Rosamond for the Race Wars, but the crowd becomes too much for Letty to handle. She still hasn't fully covered from her past accident and years of memory loss. Later, at her mock gravestone in the cemetery, she decides to leave Dom and the relationship.
  Dom visits Brian (Paul Walker) and while taking to  Mia (Jordana Brewster), discovers she is pregnant. She wants Brian to quit these dangerous adventures. Someone left a package on Brian and Mia's doorstep. Shaw sets off the explosive. Dom, Brian, Mia and child are fine, but the house is gone.
  With all this and Han (Sung Kang) dead, it is time for Dom's racing team to get back together and go after Deckard Shaw.

Paul Walker died November 30, 2013, age 40, while taking a day off from filming and attending a charity event in Valencia, California. He decided to be a passenger in a show automobile that ended up in a car accident, crashed into a tree, exploded and burned him and the driver to death.
  This film was re-written and they used as much already-filmed footage of Paul Walker as they could. They finished scenes using CGI-effects and Paul's brothers, Caleb and Cody as stand-ins and voice-actors.

6175365,1,B00HLTD8RA,"I didn't expect much of this movie and it sure delivered! Vin Diesal has an ego the size of Texas. Back in Fast Five as if the idea of him beating The Rock in a fight wasn't ludicrous enough, (no pun intended) he has proven to be superhuman, driving headfirst off cliffs, playing chicken with Jason Stathom, taking multiple hits to the head with a wrench, and he just shakes it off! I love The Rock but didn't know it was possible to fall out of a building and actually survive. Besides Jason Stathom getting revenge for his brother, the plot lost me. After an hour into the movie I just stopped watching it. Lost interest. I loved the action movies of yesteryear like the Die Hards, Lethel Weapons, Rambos while far fetched contained a decent amount of realism. This movie was idiotic. But what do I know? Second highest grossing movie of the year, 3 more in the works, and Vin Diesal wants an Oscar for Best Picture! Ohh the possibilities!

Oh, the humanity!!

Expect plenty of pretend action and crappola CGI effects, folks.  Add the dumbest script ever and Van Diesel's signature mumbling, and it's pretty painful.

If you must insist on trying it, do yourself a favor and quit after about 30 or 40 minutes.  Every minute thereafter represents a moment in time that may be appreciated in some other way.  Life is short, folks.  Run the other way.",1449360000,6,747,4.364963503649635

My gradson's  BluRay and My 2 different BluRay machines say that they do not recognize the DVD.  Since my grandson does not live near me, it took a while to retrieve the DVD from him and try to play it myself.  It still won't play.  And you won't take it back, according to my computer request.  I've purchased hundreds of DVDs from you and only had one other that failed to perform and which I returned.  Well it still won't play -- not recognized by player.  AND YOU WON'T ACCEPT IT BACK.

That being said I'd enjoyed this one as a really fun action movie. Compared to Fast 6 it was more interesting to me. I'm hoping it will be the last but I know there are talks about making more which as a fan of the series is nice but I'd rather just see them reboot it with a new cast.

I liked the tribute to Paul Walker at the end where the two starts are driving side by side and Paul Walker (obviously not Paul Walker) veers off onto a side road and disappears.  Non stop action.

6176755,3,B00HLTD8RA,"Its good to see another fast and furious movie; but is time that when they do the movie they revised it.
It seems more like an Avengers Movie than a group of Normal People driving Normal Fast Cars and Working for the Government. This movie copy a lot of other movies and TV Series The Eye of God= The Machine in Person of Interest. The way they fight and never bleed= Statham can do Loki vacations; Vin Dissel can do Captain America vacations; the Rock can do the Hulk vacations and Kurt Russel (Mr. Nobody)= David Hasselhoff (Michael Knight) The Man who does not exist; also works for a Secret Organization and he really Drives a Fast and Indestructible car name KITT; that also Jumps from 2 buildings and it can really hold damage from bombs and missiles even laser damages.  Really come on I know is a movie but man they went the extra mile convincing people that you can fall of a risk, fall of an 8 story building, explode a parking lot; hit their faces with meta tubes and tada nothing happens not a single drop of blood.  If this was an Avenger Movie or a Knight Rider movie is ok but This a movie about Normal People Driving Normal (a little bit modify cars) so for the next movie add some blood in the fights and be more realistic in the car sequences and fighting sequences.",1447891200,,1284,4.345833333333333

With a self referential nod and a wink to the absurdity that unfolds on screen, the ensemble cast zooms along and embraces the insanity of the action and dialogue. The frenetic pace of the movie doesn't allow the viewer to digest how improbable the previous scene was, because we're already onto the next scene of preposterous action fueled high-jinks. The caliber of action stars in this movie is off the charts and I look forward to future installments when Dwayne Johnson has to carry a physical rock the size of his cars and smash it furiously into the audience's sense of wonderment.",1447718400,,754,4.71969696969697

The action scenes are fantastic and hard to believe that they can be performed.  Waiting on 8 to come out in a couple of years.

6177462,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Unfortunately, I have to admit that this is the first film I've seen in the ""Furious"" franchise.  I purchased the DVD for only three reasons.  I wanted to see the fight sequence between Michelle Rodriguez and Rhonda Rousey  I'm certainly a big fan of Rhonda's and wanted to see how Michelle did against her.  I also wanted to see the legendary actor, Kurt Russell, in action.  I've been an avid fan of Kurt's for over three decades, and I was hoping to see him do his thing, which he did in spades.  He may be back for Furious 8.  Last, I wanted to see the fantastic car-jump scene between three buildings in Abu Dhabi.  These three scenes were all I hoped they would be, and certainly much more.

What surprised me, however, is just how much I found myself enjoying the entire movie.  This isn't Lawrence of Arabia or The Bridge Over the River Kwai, but I rated it 5-stars because for its genre, the film delivers on what it promises and clearly holds your interest to the last minute.  I especially loved the hand-to-hand combat sequences between Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel.

One last thing, even though Paul Walker passed away when the film was only halfway through completion, the production company still managed to finish the movie with the help of Paul's two brothers and CSI efftects.  For me, it was like Paul Walker was in the entire film.

Great job!

Now, I'm going back to watch Furious 6 & 5.",1446940800,,1427,4.51953125

It only does well because people love the characters. It can't be because they feel like they are watching great film making.

6177497,4,B00HLTD8RA,"If you've seen the others, than you know what to expect here.  Some of the stunts are a bit far-fetched (and this is reason why I can not give this movie 5 stars).  This one goes into the ""yeah right! Like that'll happen"" mode.  Also, if you want to watch the movies in order, move Tokyo Drift from being the 3rd movie to being the 6th movie.  This one opens up with scenes taken from Tokyo Drift.  Furious Five is still my favorite one in the series.

Just remember one thing when you watch this the first time.  Have the tissue handy cause I sure needed it towards the end!  The first time my eyes watered was when Dom (Vin Diesel) is dying in the arms of Letty.  The second time was at the end with Vin Diesel's voice over saying good bye to Paul Walker.  It hard to say goodbye to such good friends.",1446940800,,803,4.122580645161291

6177616,2,B00HLTD8RA,"I am not the target audience for this franchise but I enjoyed previous installments, specifically 5, and I like the actors. This one however I disliked from the beginning when the secondary villain caused significant damage to a hospital caring for his brother and then instructed the staff in the room to provide the best care for his brother, never mind that he'd just significantly negatively effected their ability to do so. Instead of impressing me I thought the villain stupid. But a worse sequence in my opinion is when Hobbs found same villain hacking the agency's files where Hobbs works and basically began a conversation with him instead of immediately halting the hack. Just found it totally unbelievable that a top security agent would stand chatting while a criminal hacked his files. It was the villain's audacity, I get it, that the writer was trying to show but what stood out for me was Hobbs' non-response. It's believable that a top security agent wouldn't expect to find a criminal stealing from him and in his face about it, but the writer had Hobbs respond in a way totally unbelievable. I'd much rather have had Hobbs immediately launch himself at the villain and been defeated in that fight, rather than initiate a conversation. For me, a conversation was the exact wrong thing a proactive security agent would do if he encountered such an in your face criminal. I admit I've never, to my knowledge, met a top security agent, but my opinion of U.S. government anti-terrorist agencies is that they're very, I'd argue extremely, proactive. An agent, in my opinion, would've immediately attempted to halt the theft, never mind conversing with the criminal. So the film lost me there. Everything following that was noise and property damage. I gave it 2 stars, one for crazy stunts and one because it was in focus. Disliked the music. Totally disbelieved that a bunch of scantily clad young women would be in the middle of the desert to observe race wars. I was thinking heat exhaustion, sun stroke, where's the water. And the guy took a punch from Letty with no problem, without even an insult muttered under his breath. Yeah, right. It would've been more believable if he'd reacted honestly to being punched in the mouth, and then caught Dom eyeballing him and decided to amend his first response. That at least would've helped the story seem somewhat grounded in reality. They need another writer cause whoever's writing their scripts, if they keep going like this, is going to trash the franchise.",1446768000,,2522,4.867441860465116

I watched the entire thing, and it was entertaining, but really, there's nothing epic that happens after the first hour.

6177816,2,B00HLTD8RA,"Walked out before the movie was even half done. It was so badly edited that I couldn't figure out what was even going on.

I enjoyed 1, 4, and 5 tremendously. 2 and 3 were okay, but not as interesting with Vin Diesel missing. 6 was so-so, with a silly plot. So, now our villainous, hijacking, prison escapees are heroes, because the Governments of the world can't take down a drug cartel.

Reminds me a lot of the Suicide Squad, actually, and I hadn't thought of that angle before now... hmm...

So I have no idea why people are gushing about the ending, but that is apparently why they're giving it 5 stars. Ignore the entire movie, and if the ending has some sappy farewell to the actor who passed away, all is forgiven. Can someone please tell me why people are so idiotic? I'm glad Chris Nolan didn't follow this recipe for The Dark Knight, otherwise Batman would have held a big beautiful ceremony for the Joker at the end.

It goes without saying that this was the worst of the series. But if you want to throw you money at a nonsensical story, more power to you. Who am I to try and convince anyone that this movie made no sense? That it was written for 12-year old boys? That might explain the reviews...",1446508800,2,1212,4.349557522123894

6177819,5,B00HLTD8RA,"EXCELLENT movie of the pack!! I also purchased the bundle of the first 6 in the collectible tire and chrome set. They saved room in the tire for the Furious 7. You won't be disappointed with this movie...I saw it in the theater and was amazed at all the stunts they have in this. I will miss Paul, as he didn't finish this movie, but they used his 2 brothers to CG over their faces with Paul's. I could spot when he was not in the seen only because I've seen how movies are shot and the end result on film.

STILL I must buy!!!",1446508800,,527,4.019047619047619
6177820,3,B00HLTD8RA,"Overall it was an okay movie. Certain scenes were a hokey, and the humor in some parts felt forced as opposed to previous versions where it came off more natural. Ronda Rousey had a small roll in the movie, and although the girl can break you in half in the octagon, she simply cannot act (truth be told, her lines sucked too). If I was disappointed by anything it was that the villain (Deckard Shaw played by Jason Statham) was simply not believable. From the very beginning he came across as a bad guy from a comic book rather than an action film. Like Rousey's lines, and the rest of the general humor, his presence was also forced.

7 movies in, I can see how it's getting harder to sustain that same adrenaline rush we got from F&F1 & 2F,2F. But this one went way off the rails and by itself is entertaining, but not a good follow-up to such a entertaining series. If anything needed to change, they should have removed half the humor, given Rousey better lines (or no lines at all; just let her scowl at you and let the punches fly), and focused more on the car chasing in either direction.

In spite of all that, the ending was very nicely done. It was subtle, but direct and was a nice tribute.",1446508800,,1202,4.314159292035399

The cinematography, the filming (notably of a particular fight scene between Statham and the Rock), the story, just outstanding. And moments that genuinely make you laugh. And of course the final scene, which in theaters had three grown men on the verge of tears. But some of us really feel like we grew up with Paul Walker. If a film can take you through a range of emotions and manage to resolve at the end, it is truly a great film in my humble opinion. Amazing. I'm going to watch it a third time very soon.",1446336000,,662,4.390243902439025

The most interesting part was after the film was over when I remembered that one of the main characters died during the making of the film and I went and read how they used computer animated graphics to add him into to a number of the main and pivotal scenes. They did a really good job with that, I was impressed. Otherwise the movie was fast cars, snarky dialog, blowing stuff up, and sappy romance. But fun to watch.",1446076800,,464,4.224719101123595

They aren't made to be thought provoking. All films fit under a category. If you want a thought provoking film that speaks to you on a deeper level, watch something else. These movies fall under ""Just for Entertaintment; Need something watch on Friday with homemade popcorn.""

I like these films for the car action, fighting scenes, sense of humor, and likable characters.

This film was no different from the rest. I like that the characters are close friends who consider themselves family, they stick together, help each other, and like family, they tease each other. I think the actors made these films successful for the most part because not only were they able to make their characters likable, but the actors themselves are likable people.",1445990400,,884,4.886666666666667

6178127,3,B00HLTD8RA,"Not quite sure what to make of this release. Paul Walkers passing really effects the flow of this film. It feels rushed in some scenes and suddenly cut in others, giving a very convoluted vibe. Obviously this can't be held against James Wan as I'm sure he did the best with the time he had. The CGI and ending was very tastefully and respectfully done - It really shines through in these films that these people really care about each other.

The scenes involving bimbos and up-skirts came across as tacky and out of place. I like looking at ladies as much as the next straight guy, but considering how much these films have changed - it just felt stuck on for no added benefit.

In terms of the product, I'm a bit disappointed that they didn't do a deeper segment into Paul Walker in the special features. Considering this was his last film, it would of been nice to see some never before seen footage and possibly an interview with the cast reflecting on their friendship with Paul or how it was working with him through the franchise.

Overall, while this film may not hold a candle to Fast 5 and 6 - it still comes recommended to any F&F fan.",1445990400,,1146,4.39622641509434

6178333,4,B00HLTD8RA,"This movie only goes so high on my rating scale because I think Paul Walker did his part in this movie, and because he is the entire heart of the Fast & Furious franchise.  His charm and energy radiate in this last installment of his, and I nearly teared up from his exit from the screen.  Pual, RIP and know that you were one of the greats in my book!

But let's analyze the rest of the film.. I feel like the action was over-the-top, which i admit I do like in certain instances.  However, I feel like the acting was riddled with flawed one-liners, attempting to make the characters (especially Diesel's) stand out as bad-asses.  I hated every time they spouted this nonesense.  I also felt like this last action sequences were stroking Diesel's ego, if you're gonna play dead just to torment your on-screen-wife, you're a jerk.

I can understand that a lot of mixed reviews about this movie are justified, because i'm certainly divided.  But I think this was a fairly good film if you can cover your ears during the at times horrid line deliveries.  In my final opinion,  the franchise should end here, because Paul's exit will certainly be imprinted in everyone's minds, and it was a fantastic way to end.",1445731200,,1209,4.555555555555555

6178392,4,B00HLTD8RA,"I will admit that I have never been a huge F&F fan but I have enjoyed the action sequences and cool looking cars.  With this movie series, you know exactly what you are going to get with no surprises.  As it is with sequels, some movies in the series have been better than others and at times the sequels had more flash than story.  So I expected a bit more of the same with Furious 7 and in some ways they don't change what the series is noted for with its fast cars, wild stunts and action packed sequences.  To my surprise, this has a better story this time around and a good villain with the addition of Jason Statham who is always comfortable in this type of role, good guy or bad.  I also like the addition of Kurt Russell as well.  Granted the stunts are a bit over the top but this movie brings the fun back to the F&F series.  I do feel the movie is a bit too long though at over 2 hours and 20 minutes.  I do say that the tribute to Paul Walker is a nice touch and to me (even though I know the F&F don't want to hear it) this is a great way to send off the series.  I personally don't think it would be the same series without Walker.

6178702,1,B00HLTD8RA,"I call it profit pandering when all that the producers ask of the writer and director is to make sure there are as many formula scenes (movie history has proven these to be money makers) as possible to attract the widest audience.
Check out the proof:
1. Prolonged close up shots of the rear ends (said this way to bypass Amazon censors) of bikini, barely clad, humans. Check!
2. Prolonged close up shots of the males who compensate for their small appendage (said this way to bypass Amazon censors) by over pumping (exaggerating) the male antlers (i.e. muscle). A skill acquired first by practice posturing in front of their full length mirrors. Males further enhance their displays by seeming to always be wearing tight tees (if at all) with small sleeves to promote those antlers. So much non-functional muscle that if they tried running they might outrun a sloth. Check!
3. Furthering this theme is the storyline of ""muscle"" cars accompanied by prolonged close ups of ""pushing the pedal to the metal"" and massaging the manual shift with the that standard coup de grce - squealing tires. Oh, and the car drop from airplane - done before. Check!
4. Assault on bad guy fortress - done so many times in film it has actually become boring. Fight scenes - an Oscar for camera angles. Bruce Lee, if he could see this, would be laughing in his Lake View home. Check!
5. Dialogue? Written for that part of the audience that struggled to pass sophomore English in high school. Check!
6. Inject into the storyline the latest pop news headlines caption grabber - terrorists and hackers. Check!",1445472000,6,1585,4.746376811594203

This is a good vs. bad, fast vs. slower adventure featuring more than car chases and stunts.  Vin Diesel is his usual macho but winsome self wooing his lady.  Picture a Dodge Challenger, Plymouth 'Cuda, Bugatti Veyron, Jeep Wrangler, Subaru Impreza and a Nissan GTR with 700 horses.  The Supercar, though, deserves its own statement:  The Lykan HyperSport made in the Middle East, has a max speed of 240 mph and goes from zero to 60mph in less than 3 seconds and costs over $3.5 million.  And wait until you see WHERE it goes.  Think of Mission Impossible in world-renown cities building to more than a smashing conclusion.  As a final note:  While this film was being produced, actor Paul Walker died in his car so his brothers stepped in to take his place in the film.",1445299200,,943,4.559523809523809

6178953,1,B00HLTD8RA,"Absolute trash.

This movie is so bad, but it's not even funny bad.  I don't care about Paul Walker....I was just after a halfway decent movie for Friday night.  Combination of stilted, foot-in-mouth, twee dialogue delivered by actors who could barely pass an infomercial audition, completely off-the-wall stunts that leave physics in their rear-view mirror, INCREDIBLY boring car chases, and the sort of puerile, high-schooler attitude towards life and ""romance"" (sexiness) that is just nauseating to anyone who's ever actually matured past puberty.....leaves you reeling with amazement at its inadequacies, of which there are many.

This movie was literally written and made for the packs of teenaged zombies that we call younger people nowadays.  Thumping hip-hop, nary a good actor anywhere to be seen, and the most lame excuse for a plot that exists only to throw in a peppering of opportunities for the men to look even more po-faced and the women to lose even more garments amidst the supposed-to-be-crises that they are supposed-to-be-dealing with.

Aside:  They should have hired Top Gear's Clarkson/Hammond/May to make and film the car chases, a-la their one episode with The Sweeney.  They made a car chase with a Ford Focus and an under-powered Jaguar driven by an overweight car show host and a confused Armenian look (and feel) more exciting than ANY of the absolute trash contained in Furious 7.",1445212800,,1410,5.180616740088106

This is even more insane than the rest of the franchise.  Which makes you wonder how they're going to top it.",1445040000,,395,4.472222222222222

6179507,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Just yesterday evening, I was at the grocery store and there's a movie rental place there. I originally was asking him if they had ""San Andreas,"" but he said not for another day.

We started talking about ""Furious 7"" and that I was just about to go see it on April 3rd when I got sick, and stayed sick, including having a stroke, the whole time it was in theaters.

So I finally just bought it last week, and it was about time I saw it! Totally worth the wait, and I told him that the only time I noticed that Brian was not Paul was when he had a close up, talking with 'Hello Kitty,' (cause I couldn't and can't remember her name [memory still lagging from the stroke], and it was the scene right after Letty says, ""Hello Kitty's awake."" LOL!) All I said at that moment was, ""That is not Paul.""

But the rest of it was spot on! Especially the very end when they show him twice in the car.
The guy at the video store told me that was actually done using CGI with one of his brothers, and I couldn't believe it.

I had to assume that they took video from one of the previous movies in order to get those shots, but I am just stunned at how well that came out by using his brother! Simply unreal!

I keep watching that end scene over and over with tears in my eyes! Just can't help myself!

But I asked him if he knew about the order that the movies are meant to be watched now. He said no, he had never heard of any certain order. So I told him that since ""Tokyo Drift"" was so out of place, especially with Han, the series should be watched as, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7.

I told him, that first of all, Han's story in #3, brings about so much confusion and makes no sense as to why he's in #4, 5 & 6. But then during the credits of #6, it shows that exact scene of Han from #3, from a different standpoint. But it's still the same scene. But it sets everything up for #7.

Then in #7, we see it happen again near the start of the movie, putting things together. In #3, we also saw a cameo of Dom at the very end, about to race the main character. In #7, we see Dom talking to him more in depth, along with some of the other characters from #3, who are still teenagers, as they were at the time that movie was made in... 2006 I believe???

So that places the events of #3 nine years ahead of the time it was released, to the same time as #7 was released. Therefore the reason the movies should be watched in this order... 1, 2, (4, 5, 6), 3, (7... [8, 9] )...?

6179562,3,B00HLTD8RA,"I have seen people say ""this is the best Fast and the Furious movie to date"", and if you're going on the criteria of ""cohesive storyline and action sequences"", that's probably true. However, if you're watching for cool cars, races, and shenanigans, you will find yourself more disappointed than I was with any other movie that's come out in the last year (which I had high hopes for). The whole film is more like Die Hard meets the Three (6?) stooges, but in any good way. Statham's character was far less interesting than I'd hoped for, and the ludicrous scene where both he and Diesel walk away from a high speed front end collisions with nothing more than wobbly gaits and tricklingly bloodied noses made me scoff out loud, ""suspend belief""? Sure, but there are some things that just make me irritated with Hollywood's brashness in the face of grounded story telling.

By the end of it, where everyone was probably crying, I was bored. I didn't know Paul Walker, he was a boring actor that always came off stiff to me and while I didn't wish him ill, much less death, I don't care enough I needed a 20 minute long goodbye scene so I could pine on with sobs like he was my best friend.

The movie gets a solid B- for being pretentious and irritatingly over the top.",1444608000,,1267,4.48051948051948

I cannot really think of a negative here, I saw it in the theatre and I just watched the dvd. If you are a fan of the Furious films then you will not be disappointed. They also provided a wonderful tribute to the memory of Paul Walker. I truly enjoy fight scenes done by Vin Disel and/or Jason Statham in all there movies. But the best fight scene involves two other characters in this film and that was truly an unexpected bonus. What makes this such a great film is its appeal to everybody; there is comedy, there is romance, there is drama and of course there is action.

6179792,5,B00HLTD8RA,"THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!! I am NOT going into the plot/story of this movie. If you have seen the previous six movies in the series, you will NOT be disappointed. The action is awesome!! The continuity of the storyline is very well presented and the ""family"" concept is also very well presented. The loss of Paul Walker is given a wonderful and heartfelt farewell, in a way that only the original cast members can show. His brothers represented his loss in the latter parts of the movie so very well. You actually don't feel like Paul is missing at all. I don't know how well they can continue the movie franchise, but Fast and Furious so far has been a grand ride on the big screen!!!! YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! And...those of you who just have to be critical of a movie of this high caliber....have just got to be brain dead!!! lolol........",1444348800,,850,4.455128205128205

I can't see there being another one of these even if the terrible tragedy hadn't happened.  The central piece of these had been 'driving'.  Now the central piece has become the characters mainly Diesel and Walker but the story line has gotten so incredible that if I take away the over the top CGI, there is not much of a story of interest to follow.",1444262400,,447,4.162790697674419

This is a very poignant film in the series as it's the last one with Paul Walker in it. Walker dies in a car crash not related to the film during the filming of the film. The directors did a very touching and appropriate homage to Walker at the end of the film and it is reason enough to see this film.,1444262400,,471,4.303370786516854

Don't get me wrong, I love the corny lines and the Hollywood portrayal of the Cali street racing scene of the first Fast and the Furious movie but watching a fat Vin Diesel acting and dressing like its still 1999 just makes me sad. The story line in this movie is so bad, I wouldn't be surprised if you told me Vin Diesel wrote the script in crayon himself.

My expectations for this movie were extremely low. This movie makes Transformers: Age of Extinction look like Citizen Kane.",1444176000,,627,4.589285714285714

6180455,2,B00HLTD8RA,"I really really wanted to LOVE this movie. But in my opinion (YES MY OPINION, so hate me quietly), I think they did an injustice to Paul's memory by subbing his brother's bodies and his face through out. When I saw it in theaters I thought it was weird, and everyone (mostly men) seemed very emotionally attached to this idea. They used clipped scenes with solo Paul, the group talking and the him alone. They did a poor job of dubbing his face/voice over his brothers. And the story line seemed very weak. I did like the final drive at the end. It would have been nice to have a beautiful story saved for the credits/bonus features, and a truly good complete story line with wonderful graphics and scenes than a mosh up memorial movie they did. I think it would have been much better to write him out of the major story line (maybe held captive) and killed or an ""I'm done I have a family to think about"" scene.

6180457,5,B00HLTD8RA,"I usually am able to review the newer films soon after there DVD/Blu-ray release, due to illness recently i have been unable
to either watch or review during recent times, consequently catching up will take a while.
This the seventh in this electric movie - series, sadly the movie was tinged with the tragic loss during it's filming of one of the
leading lights of this popular series, 'Paul Walker' who died aged just 40 whilst a passenger in a high-speed car-accident 30th
November 2013.
The film full of it's usual foot-to-the-peddle high-speed explosive action as 'Dominic Toretto' s' (Vin Diesel) family find themselves
in a kill or be killed situation as resourceful and highly skilled 'Deckard Shaw' (Jason Statham)seeks revenge against those he holds
responsible for the death of his younger brother.
Another action -packed thrill-ride.(the visual sequences in 'Abu Dahbi' a genuine treat)

6180460,3,B00HLTD8RA,"Not as good as I had hoped.  The script was not clever and although I appreciated the special effects and action scenes they were too far fetched.  I also certainly respected the tribute at the end for Paul Walker but it made the entirely of the film confusing. The ending did not bring closure but consternation.  It would have been better if they had ended the film, paused during the credits and then rolled a separate tribute.",1443657600,,430,4.558441558441558

6180720,4,B00HLTD8RA,"I'm quite a latecomer to the FAST & FURIOUS franchise, having gotten on with the fourth entry, but not really liking it until FAST FIVE. Here we are, seven films in, the series has morphed into something else entirely different from the street racing formula it started as. While the previous two were heist films, FURIOUS 7 goes into full superhero mode. I mean, can nothing kill these people? Still, once you embrace the absurdity there's a lot of fun to be had with the over-the-top action and quip-making. The plot, as if it really matters, involves Dom and his team going after Deckard Shaw, who is hunting them down because of what they did to his brother in the previous movie. It's actually an interesting dual family dynamic that, sadly, isn't really played up save for one scene at the beginning. That's also the scene where we're introduced to just how bada** that Shaw is by seeing the aftermath of what he did to the hospital where his brother is staying. Sadly, nothing in the rest of the film lives up to that level of awesome. Along the way, the team has to extract a hacker so that they can get some incredible piece of technology that will help them find Shaw. However, the ""God's Eye"" is merely a plot-driving MacGuffin that extends the running time, and kind of useless because Shaw just keeps showing up where Dom and company are anyway as the plot requires. And that's generally the biggest problem with FURIOUS 7: it relies too heavily and coincidence and convenience to drive the story. Still, the film delivers on the action it promises. Big time. The coolest stunt in the whole film is probably where they parachute cars down onto a mountain, which looked to be achieved practically (at least part of it). I can only imagine what an adrenaline rush it would have been to see it on a premium format screen (like IMAX), but it was still effective on my laptop. But, for my money, the film's best action sequence takes place in Abu Dhabi. James Wan, best known until now for directing low-budget horror films, was at his directorial best here deftly cutting between concurrent action sequences and witty banter courtesy of Roman (Tyrese). After this show-stopping segment, the final ""street fight"" was almost anti-climactic by comparison. As for the lulls between the action, there was plenty of talk about family as is typical for the series. Yet, none of it really felt genuine until the emotional final scene which pays tribute, and says farewell, to Paul Walker. That moment alone, out of all the other similar ones throughout the series, was heartfelt and touching without being clichd. So, is this highbrow entertainment? Heck no! But, it knows what it is and delivers what the target audience wants.",1443312000,,2729,4.747368421052632

Yes, in this latest addition there are all the requisites for a testosterone-fueled blockbuster action movie - car chases, explosions, death-defying stunts, girls in skimpy bikinis.  All that's really missing is a plausible and realistic plot, but I guess that's optional these days.  Also, can't Dwayne Johnson weary anything else but skin-tight Under Armour shirts and combat boots?  Must be what he sleeps in too.

6180822,2,B00HLTD8RA,"**Spoiler Alert**
Something is lost on this film. Maybe it has to do with the fact that the acting is terrible or the stunts are so far over the top that even suspending reality can't pull this out of a nose dive. This movie lacks the one thing the original film had - soul. While not the greatest movie, the original had a certain charm to it. There is absolutely nothing like that in this film. You can hear that plainly in the dialog.

The best part of this film was Ronda Rousey. I really like the chick-fight scene between her and Letty. I had to laugh though because in IRL, Ronda would have obliterated her in 27 seconds.

It was like watching an amped up version of ""Triple XXX"". Only in this one Vin Diesel saves the world. I mean really, a terrorist flying a helicopter and a remote control drone that fires missiles on the streets of El-Ay? All the damage inflicted to the city and not one mention of who is going to clean that mess up. The movie started off great and they had me up to the point where they blew up Dominic's house. After that, the whole thing just unravels for me. The whole, car rolling down a cliff? Sh1t, that would kill anyone at the perceived speed they are rolling at. Brian hanging on to the end of a bus that is teetering on the edge of cliff and is only saved by making a well timed jump to Letty's car who, coincidentally was at the right place at the right time and was able to precisely put the rear bumper where Brian needed it to be. Then he just gets up and gets in the car like nothing happened. Not a broken bone or limp or anything.

About half way through, I just wanted it to be over. I thought it would never end and I kept thinking, that surely they can wrap this up now but, it kept dragging on until the bitter end. This movie goes way over the top.

All the magic that was captured in the first films, especially the very first is devoid in this movie. It's a total two hour schlock fest for Vin Diesel to parade around like a Marvel Super Hero because all the things he does in this film only a comic book character could do.",1443225600,,2080,4.153846153846154

6181509,1,B00HLTD8RA,This film was so bad. The story doesnt make any sense at all. Just because Paul walker died doesnt mean you have to give this movie 5 stars or have to like it ://////,1443052800,18,166,3.911764705882353
6181510,2,B00HLTD8RA,"This is easily one of the weaker entries in the franchise.  The storyline was weak, and almost nonsensical.  There was very little fluidity in the story.  The film was edited together as though they were presenting a series of small vignettes or episodes, not one fluid movie.  The dialog was straight out of the Hollywood action movie dictionary, nothing original.  It was painfully obvious during the movie that Paul Walker had much more work to do on the film prior to his unfortunate passing.  He had very little dialog, and seemed to be along for the ride as opposed to having a more prominent role.  Jason Statham's character was ridiculous.  He must have had some sort of magical transport machine, as he managed to appear everywhere that Dom and his team traveled to.  Not only was Jason Statham there, he had an endless supply of vehicles and weaponry with him.  It was akin to a Friday the 13th film when Jason Vorhees shows up everywhere, despite the victims running away from him.  Dwayne Johnson was simply channeling the same character he played in the G.I. Joe sequel.  It was almost laughable.  This is the painful, honest question everyone needs to ask themselves:  Had Paul Walker not passed away, would this movie have been as successful as it was?  Would the ending that Furious 7 was given have made sense in a world where Paul Walker was still with us?  While the character of Brian O'Conner had an epiphany of sorts during the movie, it felt forced and decidedly out of character overall.  It is OK to have a ""mindless"" action film, but it needs to be cohesive and innovative.  Furious 7 is none of those things.",1443052800,10,1635,4.6573426573426575
6181521,2,B00HLTD8RA,"I'm all for action, but this is so over the top! I can only suspend disbelief so far, this movie asks too much of the viewer. The acting and dialogue is laughable. I really tried to like it. I was also disappointed in the HD sound. The midrange and mix in general was strange on both my high end systems. RIP Paul.",1443052800,2,314,4.080645161290323
6181522,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Not since Gilliam's ""Brazil"" or perhaps Orson Welles's ""Magnificent Ambersons"" has a film been so transformed by the inclusion of additional material and shown us a director's complete vision. Now the gratuitous butt shots, bulging biceps, close-ups of feet stomping on pedals and hands slamming sticks into gears are given more weight and context, exposing modern man's existential ennui as he attempts to come to terms with the cognitive dissonance of simultaneously harnessing the powers of nature in the creation and of complex machinery bound by the laws of physics while still holding onto the complex spiritual truths of ""family""",1443052800,4,636,5.37

6181526,5,B00HLTD8RA,Great movie for Paul Walkers last. Dwayne Johnson is over the top as usual. Laid up most of the movie and then all of a sudden can stand up and go kick ass.,1443052800,,156,3.757575757575758
6181527,5,B00HLTD8RA,"What a ways to end the series.  thanks to Paul Walker's twin brother, It was made with style.",1443052800,,93,4.166666666666667
6181528,5,B00HLTD8RA,"There are many things in this series that I haven't appreciated, but overall, it's great entertainment, and this installment is far and away the best. While the series has always been about family, the tribute and the way they ended it was absolutely perfect. The acting was par for the course of this series, but when one combines all of the series' history, then adds the dimension of Paul Walker's death, IRL, this release IS the Fast & Furious series. It's just epic, on multiple levels.

If you have hated this series from day one, you'll hate this one too, and probably won't get to the best part(s) without turning it off. But if you liked, or even tolerated any of the previous installments, you do NOT want to miss this one, if you're a movie buff. This has less of the undesirable garbage, and such a great ending, unless you hate this series, you really need to see this. It's far and away my favorite of the series. Most importantly, because it was definitely more about family this time than any of the previous films, but with an incredible amount of action and thrills.

Just don't share it with anybody under age 13; especially if you haven't accustomed them to looking away or fast-forwarding/skipping the most violent stuff; this is a very adult movie when it comes to violence, although the language and sexuality isn't as quite as adult as some other series installments (but it IS there, for those of you with young children, two scenes in particular warrant your attention/censorship). The action is interspersed throughout the movie, and quite intense, and very well done. And the graphics are great; only in two scenes can you even tell what is rendered and what was captured from real life. The special effects team did a great job.

The soundtrack was what you would expect from F&F flick, EXCEPT for the tribute song, See You Again by Wiz Khalifa (Feat. Charlie Puth). That is an epic ending to Paul Walker's role in this series, and easily the best song of the entire series.

To be honest, if they make another Fast & Furious movie, it just might ruin it. I hope they leave this alone and move on to other projects. This is a perfect ending to the series. Hopefully they'll leave it alone; if they keep going, they'll have to be EXTREMELY sensitive to fans' expectations and preferences if they don't want to ruin it with a bomb that burns off untold $millions of investor cash. If they mess with Paul Walker's legacy, or ruin it with a half-assed encore, it will really ruin the brand and everything connected with it.

Honestly, it might be best to wait for a generation then do a reboot, IF and ONLY IF they can cast the perfect cast and do it justice. But there was only one Paul Walker, and there is only one Vin Diesel, so I don't see it happening. That combo was great for many reasons, and it can't ever happen again in this life, for obvious reasons.

So in closing, if you like Fast & Furious movies, or have liked ANY of the previous installments, DO NOT MISS THIS ONE. You'll be glad you saw this. It's very entertaining, and the tribute is just perfect. Seriously. Kudos to everyone involved in its production!",1442966400,,3152,4.569911504424779

Kudos to the director James Wan, the actors and everyone involved in the production of this movie for keeping in spirit ""For Paul"". It was entertaining from start to finish and once again will keep you coming back for more. The movie delivers not only on the need for speed and action, but you  feel the love for family and more exploration of the characters. My husband and I also enjoyed seeing Kurt Russell, Jason Statham and of course the Rock all in one movie.
Furious 7 is one to buy for your collection as it is an instant classic!!! Warning, the ending will make the hardest person tear up.... my husband and I both cried!! RIP Paul Walker",1442966400,,723,4.43609022556391

6181559,5,B00HLTD8RA,"I have nothing bad to say about this movie. If you have watched all of the Fast and Furious movies then you will love this one just as much of the next. Even if you have not seen the first six movies you will enjoy this movie. If you are a car lover you will fully enjoy all of these movies and especially this one. Even a non-car lover would love this movie and would watch them over and over. Also if you are more a family type of person then this movie is for you, one of the characters says I don't have friends, I have family this movie is a great way to show that family is important and it is what it is all about. There is not a specific user for this product it is simply for everyone that enjoys a good movie.
 As we all know Paul Walker passed away during the filming of this movie, but you would never know, his character didn't have any less screen time. The writers handled the situation very well and had a great tribute to Paul. It was a respectful send-off and amazing way to show that they cared a lot about him. All of the characters were well played throughout the entire movie and you would have never known that anything bad had happened.
 There might be some areas of the movie that you might be lost if you have not seen any of the other movies, but other than that there wasn't anything I could point out wrong with this movie. I would not be able to talk bad about this movie even if it were to save my life, and neither will you if you watch it.
 This movie will be one of your favorites in the series, and if you have not seen any of the other movies it will make you want to watch of the others. You will soon become a huge fan of these movies and watch them over and over. Everyone will love the Fast and Furious movies.",1442966400,,1750,4.022988505747127

I don't want to spoil anything so I won't go into any detail, the ending was a great tribute to Paul and I actually got a little choked up, movies rarely get to me on an emotional level like that.

Jason Stattham plays ones of the most enjoyably delicious villain of all times; he'd make a great 007 villain too!  The cars are exceptionally beautiful and ""innovative"" prototypes.

I honestly don't want to throw spoilers in this review, but I do have to say that some scenes are a bit dumb and could have been written (that's right - written) better. In general I wasn't too impressed with Ramsey as a hacker character - NO WAY. Why couldn't that pretty girl play a kidnapped daughter of some cool hacker instead or something? Looking at her and hear her talking.... like an elementary school teacher... can you believe that that girl wrote some cyber insanity??? c'mon.

2.) Is there a decent computer store in Abu Dabi (this is the city where the billionaires reside)? Hello.... I don't want to put a spoiler, so you will see what I am talking about when you watch it.

3.)  If a car gets badly hit at the bottom, so you can see through its floor, I don't think it would be able to run again and go reverse(we are talking about 100k tuned up race car) but hey - at the same time a 3+ million dollar car, also bulletproof (of course)... has a problem you not gonna believe what kind...

The action part is what makes this film really awesome. All Mission Impossible movies with Tom look like bunch of kids playing ""Cowboys and Indians"" on the backyard compare to the action scenes I saw in this film.

6181648,2,B00HLTD8RA,"Dominic and his crew thought they'd left the bad cinema behind. They had defeated stereotypical terrorist Owen Shaw and split up. But now, despite an enormous film budget, Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw, played by a grunting and grimacing cardboard cutout wielding bagfulls of what look like practice grenades, is out making the crew feel bad by hurling both insults and the grenades, unceremoniously blowing up nearby furniture and other inanimate objects for revenge.

Worse yet, a former blood-diamond miner named Jakarde who struck it rich and purchased a military helicopter and a free license to use it within US airspace to blow up Los Angeles without any flak from the U.S. military, and another cardboard cutout character aptly named ""Mr. Nobody"" but actually Snake Plissken in an undercover cameo role, are both competing to steal a computer spyware program borrowed from Microsoft's Windows X that can turn any technological device into cold hard cash.

Torretto must reconvene with his team to wrench fight Shaw and retrieve the spyware program while caught in a power struggle between the former blood-diamond miner and the United States government's agent, Snake Plissken.  But luckily, like an episode of the A-Team, no one really gets hurt in this movie and there are many shiny objects and explosions to keep the viewer from noting a complete lack of realism, directorial discretion, or plot.

PS> This movie was so silly, and by that I do not mean humorous, but laugh-out-loud dumb.  It was as unrealistic as a childish superhero cartoon, which I thought was an unfitting ""vehicle"" for Paul Walker's well-deserved tribute and farewell.

6181679,3,B00HLTD8RA,"So we speed up to #7 in this gigantically popular action series. Dont expect much meaningful storyline, but do expect a lot of action form a crew that seems to love blowing up cars and driving them through the air and through the tall buildings of Abu Dabai and other fascinating locales. The film is overly long for the paucity of content, but for F & F fans it will satisfy.

Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew thought they'd left the criminal mercenary life behind. They'd defeated international terrorist Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and went their separate ways. But now, Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), is out killing the crew one by one for revenge. Worse, a Somalian terrorist called Jakarde (Djimon Hounsou) and a shady government official called ""Mr. Nobody"" (Kurt Russell) are both competing to steal a computer terrorism program called ""God's Eye,"" that can turn any technological device into a weapon. Torretto must reconvene with his team to stop Shaw and retrieve the God's Eye program while caught in a power struggle between the terrorist and the United States government. The 7 of course are Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Michelle Rodriguez, and Lucas Black and the cast is rounded out with some other strong actors.

It is a speed action genre film and if that is your bag youll love it and likely forgive the shallow content. Grady Harp, September 15",1442707200,,1417,4.9

6181717,4,B00HLTD8RA,"I liked this movie. I didn't keep up with whole series. I only watched the first one and this one. I mainly stayed away from these movies because of the bad actors/acting and ridiculous story. This movie was a lot of fun. Lots of action and plenty of cars. And plenty of Females' butts. The acting is still bad. The story isn't very good at all. But it's all in good fun. Just sit back and watch the ridiculousness of the action. Dwayne Johnson, Vinny Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez... the trifecta of bad acting. Enjoy.",1442707200,,519,4.473684210526316

6181731,5,B00HLTD8RA,"I was kid in the local street racing scene here in New Orleans back when the first movie came out. We were quarter mile guys with semi fast cars, no drifting or anything like that. I still remember the fun we had in that theater for the first movie. Domestic vs Import guys.. Ragging each other.. after the movie we all rode out together and went to the lakefront. It was one of the best weekends I can remember. I followed the career and life of Paul Walker after that movie. He was a huge Mustang fan like myself, and had several fox body cars like mine. He was a family man and ran a charity that did so much good. He was a great person.. never in the news for drugs or DUI or any shady anything. I was saddened by his loss and the end of this movie was a touching way to send him off. The movie itself was very good! RIP Paul I hope they have some fast cars in heaven!",1442707200,,872,3.9885714285714284

6181754,5,B00HLTD8RA,"++Warning++ This will contain spoilers from the prior films, and hints, but no major giveaways from this movie.  If you have not seen the prior films, proceed with caution.

The film continues the tradition of the franchise by ratcheting up the action, stunts and fight sequences from the last one.  It is also very bittersweet in that it will be the last movie in which we see Paul Walker or his character Brian any longer.  Most likely anyone reading this by now knows how the film handled his character after Paul Walker died about halfway through the filming of the movie, but for those who have not I will not spoil it.  The last 5-10 minutes of the film is essentially a tribute to him, leading the the black letters For Paul, just before the credits roll.

As far as the story goes, the crux of it is that Jason Statham's character plays the brother of Shaw, the bad guy from Part 6.  He is out for revenge against everyone who took his brother down, including Hobbs, and all of Toretto's crew.  This results in a great fight sequence between The Rock and Statham early on in the movie (which takes The Rock out until the end of the film), and then a cat and mouse game between Shaw and the rest of the crew throughout the rest of the movie.  The beginning of the movie actually starts after the events of the end of Part 6, then shows what we saw at the end of the credits in Part 6, showing where Tokyo Drift fit into the sequence of films,. then picked up in the ""present day.""  The movie also introduces a couple new characters that may or may not be involved in the upcoming sequels including Kurt Russell as a covert military leader type helping Dom and the Crew take down Shaw, and a hacker named Ramsey.

The movie does not try to take itself too seriously.  The action sequences are very over the top, and some of the things (like The Rock flexing a cast off his arm) are just put in to be silly and almost lampoon some of the old school action movies.  There is also the family theme that has underscored the relationships of all the characters (especially at the end of the movie) which is really the only part where it does take itself seriously.  There is a great mountainside chase, that rivals any car chase sequence done in any movie, some very good fight sequences, including one between Ronda Rousey and Michelle Rodriguez, and a couple between Paul Walker and Tony Jaa.

For those who get the disc, the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray.  There are two versions of the movie included, the Theatrical and Extended version.  There is a commentary track on the movie, then a couple hours worth of making of and behind the scenes features, including showing how they pulled off many of the action sequences with as many practical effects as they could.  There is also the ""See You Again"" music video, and a making of the Universal Theme Park Ride.  The only thing they did not have which would have been nice to see is something about how Paul Walker's brothers were used as stand ins for him to finish his parts of the film, much in the way Brandon Lee's part in The Crow was finished after his death.

Ultimately everyone knows what the movies are and are not.  If you are looking for award winning acting and writing, this is not it.  Although I would argue that many of the actors have grown into their characters very well, and the acting and writing has become better over the span of films, it is what it is.  That said, the cinematography  and action sequences rival that seen in any movie.  The movies definitely have a blockbuster feel to them now, and it is clear the set up is for the franchise to go on.  How that will work with one of the two leads gone will remain to be seen, but this is definitely worth adding to your collection if you are a fan of the series.",1442620800,,3806,4.370738636363637

Nope, just slow mos, women's butts, techno blaring, some deep sounding words, nonsensical car chases, repeat, repeat, repeat. Even if you are looking to turn off your brain for 2 hours this is painful. Nobody can turn their brain off this much.

Some of these have actually been good but this one is terrible.

6181801,3,B00HLTD8RA,"Furious 7 continues the successful franchise formula with over-the-top car stunts  the films raison dtre. The plot involves villain Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) determined to destroy the gang of car thieves led by Domin Toretto (Vin Diesel). Shaw is the older brother of Owen, who was defeated and disfigured by Dom and crew in Fast & Furious 6, and is now out for revenge. A highly trained assassin, Deckard Shaw is a seemingly unstoppable force intent on one thing only: the annihilation of Dom and his men.  A mysterious government agent known as Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) approaches Dom offering him a chance to get to Shaw in exchange for the retrieval of an advanced piece of espionage technology and the rescue of its creator.

This mission sets the stage for a global manhunt with cars doing things Detroit never intended, all for bigger and better thrills. Most of what occurs is pure action, with little attention to science or probability. This is the kind of movie you cant analyze too seriously; its meant to be enjoyed purely on a visceral level. In that department, Furious 7 delivers. This is the movie Paul Walker was filming when he died in an off-the-set car accident. The production shut down for several months while the writers and director James Wan tried to figure out how to complete the film without its star. Walkers brothers were hired as acting doubles and CGI images of Walker were superimposed. Because of Walkers untimely death, the film has a certain sadness underlying the vehicular mayhem.

Bonus features on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Extended Edition Combo Pack include deleted scenes, music video, and several making-of featurettes.",1442534400,3,1666,4.982014388489208

This was a really awesome movie with some jaw dropping action scenes and a nicely woven plot that manages to bring everyone back as they are being hunted by great bad guy Jason Statham in his quest for revenge.
As the movie comes to a close you can see how they set up the Rock's much rumored spin off franchise of his own and they have said goodbye to Paul Walker in such a way of grace with flashbacks throughout the series of the movies.
As much as I love these movies and as much as Fast 5 breathed some much needed life into them and 6 was great as was this it is time to close the door and go out in a classy way.

 I mean, think about it, James Bond has existed for decades Proving his right to be extremely capable in any situation.  Then there's Batman A legend. He can kind of pull off almost anything himself Then there's just unstoppable force is like the Terminator Which we expect to survive everything and be really strong.

 And then there are the writers of the ""Fast & Furious"" series Who just decided, with no discipline or respect, to make their characters perhaps the most talented, skilled, intelligent characters in all of movie history. They should recruit Lucy from the movie ""Lucy"". Then they can just priest time and do anything they want.

I dunno... It's just off putting.

Sad to see Paul Walker's last big film.  Apparently he was one of the best people in the world, giving to charity all the time without taking any credit.",1442448000,,1125,4.659898477157361

The ending (with out giving spoilers) is a reason I would say all die hard Paul Walker fans should buy this. Don't believe me? Then buy it your self and find out. Its worth it. Like I said the only bad thing is all the cgi used, other then that this movie was the 2nd best fast and furious movie I seen by far. i still liked 2 fast 2 furious the most for some reason.

6182082,5,B00HLTD8RA,"""Furious 7"" is great! This is how the story goes: Dominic and his crew thought they'd left the criminal mercenary life behind. They'd defeated international terrorist Owen Shaw and went their separate ways. But now, Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw, is out killing the crew one by one for revenge. Worse, a Somalian terrorist called Jakarde and a shady government official called ""Mr. Nobody"" are both competing to steal a computer terrorism program called ""God's Eye,"" that can turn any technological device into a weapon. Torretto must reconvene with his team to stop Shaw and retrieve the God's Eye program while caught in a power struggle between the terrorist and the United States government.

The cast led by Vin Diesel (also produced) (as Dominic Torretto), Paul Walker (as Brian O'Conner) & Dwayne Johnson (as Hobbs) is great. The directing by James Wan is great. The story & screenplay by Chris Morgan (also executive produced) is great.

The music by Brian Tyler is great. The cinematography by Stephen F. Windon & Marc Spicer is great. The film editing by Kirk Morri, Christian Wagner, Dylan Highsmith & Leigh Folsom Boyd is great. The casting by Kelly Roy & Anne McCarthy is great. The production design by Bill Brzeski is great. The art direction by Jonathan Carlos, Alan Hook, Desma Murphy & Jay Pelissier is great.

Earls, Mayumi Konishi-Valentine, Alex McCaroll, Sarah Forrest & Anne Porter is great. The costume design by Sanja Milkovic Hays is great. The stunts coordinated by Joel Kramer, Spiro Razatos, Troy Robinson, Oakley Lehman, Andy & Jack Gill & fights coordinated by Jeff Imada & John Koyama is great. The special effects supervised by Daniel Sudick, Joel Mitchell, Martin Hill & Joe Letteri is great. The visual effects supervised by Jay Barton, Eric D.

This is a great and well-done impressive film / sequel. This is also a great sequel to the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise, that is easily the best film of the franchise. This is also a great and fitting tribute to Paul Walker. James Wan is an impressive fit to the franchise.

6182134,5,B00HLTD8RA,"And one last ride it is!!! I have to say that ""Furious 7"" is, in a word, fantastic. When you add a British Special Forces assassin, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), to the already great mix of characters, and he is the bad guy coming after Dom (Vin Diesel) and the fast crew for revenge you just know that there is going to be more action and more excitement than in any of the previous installments. Especially when Shaw gets the better of DSS agents Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Elena Neves (Elsa Pataky) in their first confrontation.

If that is not enough, a black operative known as, at least to himself, ""Mr Nobody"" (Kurt Russell) makes quite an entrance to offer assistance in exchange for a favor that Nobody needs from Dom. And, just for good measure to ensure a good time, add in some high tech (the ""God's eye""), the billionaire Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou) from Abu Dhabi and his rockin' head of security (Ronda Rousey). They certainly do take some pristine rides to the desert.

The overall plot and sub-plots weave their way through the story and the ride is as fast and as furious as one can take. Car chases, knockdown drag-out fights, gunfire, heavy artillery, eye candy, and even flying cars...what more could one want? As with all other films in this highly entertaining franchise the comedy relief is always welcome and helps make these movies what they are. Some of the stunts and visuals are simply amazing. Unreal, yes, but loads of fun. Definitely a high octane ride! As a final note, I have to say that how the studio and fellow actors paid tribute to Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker - R.I.P.) was great, a real class act.

In terms of a product, you really get your money's-worth ... Blu-Ray, DVD, Ultraviolet and iTunes Digital Copy. And be sure to read all the code sheet as Universal also offers you the choice of a free additional UV movie.",1442275200,,1867,4.6006006006006

6182216,5,B00HLTD8RA,"A proper send-off to Paul Walker and his legacy. This movie had all the action you could ask for, but definitely had the 'family is all that matters' theme running through it. You could tell they really made this as a thank-you, we miss you, we are thinking of you, tribute to Walker. Even though its nearly 2 1/2 hours, you are kept engaged and interested throughout the film. Yes, some of the dialogue leaves something to be desired. If you can look past some of those 'hollywood' moments, you will be warmly rewarded with a sense that you are being included in their family, and their desire to truly thank their audience for over a decade of loyalty, and to say good-bye to someone they truly felt was family.",1442275200,,713,4.492307692307692

6182233,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Talk about over the top! This was certainly an ambitious movie, what many Bond movies should have been. Their tuxedo moments in this movie pay homage to that, I suppose, but it is one heck of a thrill ride. It's like Bond, Mission Impossible, and Terminator rolled into one. Of course, there are many ""are you kidding me"" moments, but if you don't enjoy them anyway, you're seriously watching the wrong movie.

The fight choreography is again top notch, and so are the ridiculous car stunts, including driving a luxury car from one skyscraper through the air into another. One criticism would be that the big battle at the end seems a bit too long, but maybe that's because you have been rattled with the action throughout.

Of course, the big item lurking in the back of your mind as you're watching all of this is, how are they going to do Paul Walker's sendoff? The ending was a masterfully done tribute that made me, uh, a bit misty ... along with the background song, it was a great way to deal with Paul's tragic death.

For go-for-broke stunts and this tribute, this should have a place in every action aficionado's library.",1442188800,2,1131,4.589108910891089

It also manages to give a nice nod and touching send off to beloved star Paul Walker who passed away during filming; the end of the movie made me cry and I really didn't want to/ tried not to.

6182396,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Best of the fast and furious movies.  I have been a fan of fast and furious franchise since the beginning.  The stories,  action, cast chemistry just unmatchable.  There have been some real disappointments along the way such as Tokyo Drift and despite the intense action most recently, I really was not very happy with Fast and Furious 6 either but this one now with 7 more than made up for everything that was weak in some of the earlier films.  An incredible 'possible ending' to the franchise while  at the same time potentially leaving it open for a possible Fast and Furious 8; though I am in agreement along with most that this would probably be the best point to just go out  while on top. Any further movies would have to face the impossible challange of pushing the bar even higher.  Of course some of the action in this film was completely over the top just plain crazy and flat out unrealistic if you think about it but it still left you on the edge of your seat both cringing and laughing at the same time, was  just fantastic.  I am glad they decided to keep Paul's character in this movie verses just flat writing him out.  Having completed only initial shooting before he was gone, it would of been much easier to write him out completely for this movie.  If someone did not know what had happened, you would not know at least until the end.  They did such an incredibly excellent job between the CG, composite footage, and body stand in all used to recreate Paul and fimish out his character with the help of his brothers, just amazing job very well done.  Sure, there a few moments where if you knew already, you can tell a bit but if you didn't, I don't think someone would really notice and it was that seamless.  The movie was emotional, intense, action packed, intricate plot with more complex levels than some might realize pulling in all the elements which has made this franchise work well while taking everything to a new extreme.  Again some parts were over the top unrealistically crazy like the clean over the top tower jumps but it just added to the comedy and great entertainment which is what movies are really about anyway.  This is definitely one for the home collection and I will get this as soon as it is available. ADDENDUM:  I since received my extended edition Blueray and as expected is a must have for any home collection.  As a few have commented they could not see a difference between extended and regular editions, I did a simultaneous play of both side by side and found every edited moment.  Little to nothing is added to content but deleted scenes also on the Blueray give you some extra insight there.  What is changed is substantial on many of the action shots in most cases adding in extra seconds of footage re-editing and lengthening fight scenes.  The initial opening scene at the hospital is lengthened substantially and they worked in Dom's necklace in the extended version.  The after funeral car chicken scene is also lengthened as is the Abu Dabhi party cat fight scene.  The final Dom battle scene is another one.  The first conversation meeting Ramsey is re-edited very subtly and need side by side to notice the difference.  The rest is mostly adding seconds extra between cut points in most action scenes.  Very well done.",1441756800,2,3285,4.590051457975986
6182397,5,B00HLTD8RA,"The BEST of the series.  It should really end here.  This movie was NON-STOP action.  And inventive, interesting action at that.  You are going to watch without blinking, with mouth wide open.  The dangerous predicaments are thrilling.  The hand-to-hand combat is insanely fun and complex.  The dialogue is well-written.  Nothing corny.  The plot twists and turns at such a fast pace, until its pile-up of a climax leaves you breathless.  Its resolution includes a touching tribute to Paul Walker (RIP) that breaks the wall between viewer, actor, and character.  Beautiful.

6182521,2,B00HLTD8RA,"Application of video-game-logic to a movie plot paired with large helpings of sentimental glurge. I guess action movie plots have always diverged from anything even vaguely possible in the real world and we all expect a certain amount of macho posturing and gallows humor as part of the scenery. But why all the whiny character interaction? Pretty much everything terrible comes from opera -- so I'll lay the blame there.

Maybe this movie would have been interesting if the creative team showed the slightest awareness that both the heroes and the main villain, played by Jason Statham, share the identical ""family above all"" ethos. As a statement about what happens when groups of super-powered sociopaths caring only for the welfare of their own families come to blows it could have had some merit.

I also thought it was strange how many ""innocent"" civilians get killed just so that they can get the ""bad guys"" off their track. Character development was horrible and they are paper thin with no soul. They did a good job faking Paul W., but the end scene is so corny, it is almost bizarre.

In this movie it just seemed like a whole bunch of disjointed scenes were thrown in to give a nearly emotionless introduction to the characters.

I went in wanting to enjoy the movie, but just wasn't able to suspend my belief enough to get into the story.  Lots of good stunts.",1441152000,,523,4.531914893617022

The entire franchise has been fun to see it develop over the years and this movie continued in the same tradition.  I've enjoyed how they have added some big names to the movies over the years and you can tell that these actors all just have fun together.  Their chemistry on the screen keeps you watching, especially Ludacris and Tyrese, I could watch those two go at it for days.  I didn't realize Kurt Russell was in this so that was great to see him as I've been a fan of his since I was younger.  The directing and location settings were unbelievable, they went all out for that.

6182992,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Furious 7
Fast & Furious began in 2001 as a movie involving an undercover cop in Los Angeles street racing but abandoned that setting for heists involving over-the-top action sequences and globe-trotting surveillance. For years the Fast & Furious series has been building a dense and complex mythology in modern Hollywood.

In the last film, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his team defeated a British criminal named Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). In Fast & Furious 7, Deckard (Jason Statham), Shaws elder brother vows revenge. Deckard murders one of Torettos buddies and attacks his secret agent friend Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). He also blows up Torettos house and nearly kills Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Brians wife who is also Torettos sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Brian and Mias young son. Wan states that this is what leads to Toretto vowing revenge on Deckard. This happens before Toretto and the rest of his crew, which also includes comic relief Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and computer expert Tej (Chris Ludacris Bridges), hook up with Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), a shadowy government operative to try and locate a tracking device.

Fast & Furious 7 does feel like the series farewell as the characters sullenly talk about taking one last ride together. Two different scenes are set in graveyards making it impossible to watch these moments and not think about Paul Walker who died in a tragic car accident in November 2013 before production had ended. Though Furious 7 delivers essential thrills, Walkers real life fate is on the audiences mind when his character, Brian OConner, hangs off the edge of a cliff from a crushed bus.

 The films midsection is most fascinating Disappointingly, Dwayne Johnson sits most of this chapter out.  Though he does make the most of his limited screen time.ng and thrilling to watch. The series ends with a wonderful tribute to Paul Walker. .  I would recommend the audience to watch the movie as it delivers plenty of loud cars and bad tempers.",1440979200,,1987,5.006060606060606

6183096,5,B00HLTD8RA,"This film has non-stop exciting action and all sorts of improbable but enjoyable situations. I felt that one regular cast member who has grown along with the rest of the cast as the series has evolved was dispensed with too readily, but otherwise a great film, outstanding cast, excellent cinematography and direction. This will definitely please fans of the Fast and Furious franchise and the hot rod, speed movie genre. This film has lots of fun and excitement and is OK for families with older kids to watch. There is no profanity that I can recall but lots of violence, although it has an ethereal quality. This is the most durable, bulletproof family of hot-rodders you will ever meet. Spellbinding special effects and touching tribute to the late Paul Walker, a talented artist who left us much too soon. Filmmaking gold.",1440979200,,827,4.872340425531915

6183126,4,B00HLTD8RA,"Completely outrageous and ridiculous in every way. Full of holes in logic and action scenes that defy the laws of physics. The dialogue sounds like it's written by a third grader, and the fight scenes appears even less feasible/realistic than those in the WWE. All in all, everything a Fast & Furious movie should be! Lacks some of the relationship emotion of the 6th installment, but the fitting salute to Mr. Walker at the end leaves the emotions satisfied.",1440979200,,459,4.822784810126582

6183212,3,B00HLTD8RA,"About the stunts, if you differ it's only because you are suckas fan....... First off the series has went wayyyyyyyy down hill. The ""stunts"" are shameful and non believable. Jumping out of a plane? Sure When speeds are suppose to reach up to 200mph with the weight of car so how will you breathe without masks......the general ease crowd probably don't know the basics about this that's why it was only ""cool"" to most. There are a quit few that are starting to feel they have gon too far to the left though..............anyways on to the movie, story was a basic script with insert Rock recycled badas moment, insert a I'm a badas moment by ven disieal, insert tyrese cornball non funny kid acting ways that kids mainly get a chuckle out of, insert ludacris supposedly a smart tech nerd when in ff2 he was a hustler-thug; right. There was nothing in this movie that you haven't seen in the other ff movies. Granted death of paul walker thingy was nice but you cant give the ridiculous movie a pass for that.

They are scared if they drop rock and focus on running from cops/stealing cars people will get bored so their sulotion is to give you dumb stunts and meathead moments by the rock that makes him look like superman all the time.",1440892800,,1235,4.513392857142857

6183308,3,B00HLTD8RA,"Meh, I watched it, but will probably not ever watch it again. It's pretty much what you would expect from the F&F movies. I found the acting just terrible to the point where there were times where I had to cringe or roll my eyes after one of the actors said his/her line. I'm sure a lot of people gave it a good rating simply because of it being Paul's last movie. I can understand that if you were a hardcore fan of the series, and in truth I gave it 3 stars because I didn't think there was even one of the movies in this series that was worth more than that. Most or even all the driving is done in front of a green screen, which I detest. It's not even close to looking realistic at all.

This particular F&F movie was way over the top on all counts. Acting (seriously, it was horrible), special effects, the so-called driving, pretty much all the action scenes were just so over-blown it tended to ruin the movie for me. Sure it looked cool, but in the end it still ruined it for me because of just how unrealistic it was. These people defy certain death so many times if was just stupid.

Again, if you're a fan of this franchise, you'll most likely like this movie. Of all the actors in this series I think only Paul had any idea how to actually drive in real life. Which is really my biggest beet with a car-type movie. If you can't drive to begin with, don't get in the car because it is most definitely going to show.",1440892800,3,1427,4.148014440433213

If you have godlike disbelief suspension and like crazy action that seems over the top even for a Saints Row game, this is probably a 5 for you.  Dwayne Johnson's character falls 4 stories ONTO a car with a 130lb woman on top of him and suffers only a fractured wrist (or that's what it seems like because he marches around the middle of a major metropolitan city carrying a mini-gun in the last scene), people drive off mountains and walk away from it with barely a scratch because ""roll cage"", so on and so forth...

6183499,4,B00HLTD8RA,"""Furious 7"" (2015) is directed by James Wan (The Conjuring, Insidious, Saw). This film is about Deckard Shaw's (Jason Satham) revenge for his comatose brother Owen Shaw as he tracks down the team of Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto, and Brian O'Conner. This film is an amazing blockbuster film that rivals the Marvel Avenger films for shear spectacular action. Cars are parachuted from cargo carriers, cars careen down mountain sides, one car even crashes through one skyscraper tower over into two other adjacent towers. Paul Walker died at the age of only 40 in a single vehicle accident before the filming was even half finished, however through rewrites and clever editing one would never have known it from the finished film. At the time of this writing it is interesting to note that this film has grossed more than films like Skyfall, and Lord of the Rings, and has moved into the top 4 position for all time earnings for a film just behind Marvel's The Avengers.

Here we are, the seventh film in to a long running franchise and it just happens to be one of the best, one of the most unique and one of the most creative yet.

No complaints from this guy either. I've loved the ride. Furious 7 to me is the most ""blockbuster"" film of the series to date. I honestly don't think this movie was any less exciting or ""big"" than any Marvel movie I've seen except for maybe Avengers and Winter Soldier.

This was also a movie I went into with high expectations but was also curious to see how they would pull off this sequel given the fact that Paul Walker tragically passed away during the beginning of the movie's production. Now that I mentioned all of that, let's go over the movie itself. The story revolves around Deckard Shaw, who swears revenge on Dominic Toretto's group after the death of his brother Owen Shaw (the bad guy from the 6th movie). After Deckard Shaw kills a member of Toretto's group, Toretto gets his group back together and prepares for an action-packed fight towards Shaw. Was this sequel good? It wasn't just good..............IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!! I was genuinely surprised at how much fun I had with this movie and especially with how they managed to film this sequel without Paul Walker to continue his role as Brian O'Connor. If you don't know, Paul's brothers Caleb and Cody were used to complete his scenes. Jason Statham was definetly perfect as the antagonist and watching the rest of the main cast members continue their roles as their characters was awesome to watch. The movie has constant moments of well-directed action sequences but also has some moments of humor and surprisingly, a few moments of drama. The one thing that defined this movie is of course the final scene. I won't give away the ending for those who haven't seen it, but let's just say that your eyes will more likely pour a lot of tears. Overall, Furious 7 was an outstanding movie with a perfect way to honor one of the franchise's most well-beloved actors, Paul Walker. If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out on a phenomenal action movie!!!!",1437177600,2,1833,4.660493827160494
6183563,1,B00HLTD8RA,"Now, don't get me wrong.  Paul Walker was a nice guy who did a lot of nice things, but he wasn't exactly a groundbreaking actor.  Same can be said for anyone else in this franchise.  Furious 7 takes this franchise to a whole new level of ridiculous.  2F2F and Tokyo Drift aside (dont even get me started on how bad those were), I have been a huge fan of this series from the beginning, and I am usually at the theater opening night, ticket in hand.  The plots are never plausible, but the films are (almost) always entertaining and action-packed.  This one was neither of those things.

There was so much unnecessary dialog in this film, much of it being the basic message of all that matters is family.  If youve seen ANY of the FNF movies starring the core cast (Diesel, Walker, Brewster, Rodriguez), then you know this theme is the driving force and trigger for all of each plot.  If you didn't watch one through six, you're probably not going to watch number seven.  So why shove it down the audiences throats for two hours and seventeen minutes?  It got old after the eleventh or twelfth super-sappy, way-too-quiet touching conversation.  I get it.  You love each other.  Moving on.

The action scenes were well beyond over the top.  At one point, we have Dom and Brian in a car with no breaks jumping from one skyscraper to another via driving through the mirrored plate glass windows at high speeds.  Um, no.  Maybe one for the sake of a great action scene, but we really need to push it out to two jumps?  Really?  You took it from unrealistic but good for action to so far out of the realm of possibility that it just came off as laughable.

Additionally, the scene where Dom is standing up on top of the parking garage, stomps his foot, and the concrete crumbles right in front of him as though he were some sort of titan.  Hes not.  His one little stomp is not going to be the thing that causes the three-foot-deep piece of concrete to crumble.

Lets not even get into the fight scene between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham (I love Statham but The Rock would squish that man with one good squeeze), the almost cartoonish first car chase scene, or the fact that the cameos in the movie served absolutely no purpose.

Plus, the ending made NO SENSE.  None.  Im just saying, you guys could have spent a little bit more time in the writers room.

Disappointed.  Very, very disappointed.

I will warn you, bad movie or not, watching and knowing that's the last time we'd see Paul Walker WILL bring tears to your eyes.  The writers tried very hard to make this installment in the franchise an emotion-fueled hell ride.  Hints of the emotion they were going for are certainly there, but for the most part, it just fell short.  I'm sad to see the end of this particular era.  I just wish they had given Walker a better executed farewell.",1436918400,11,2842,4.464980544747082

6183587,5,B00HLTD8RA,"If theres one thing to want from a Fast and Furious film, its outrageous vehicle-fueled action. On that front, this seventh film delivers amply, then still heaps even more on top just for the heck of it. Its robust budget is on full display as all manner of cars are repeatedly raced, flown and destroyed in the most outlandish feats. The characters are now equally superpowered to survive such fantastic stunts unharmed, often engaging in hand-to-hand combat which wouldve killed a regular mortal twenty-times over. A typical action scene from this movie would be the glorious finale to another inferior film, yet F7 is not only happy to give the viewer such climactic moments, but then it cant help itself but as to immediately top such moments in its incessant quest for the greatest thrills. With a wide cast of characters at its disposal, the scenes often crosscut back and forth to deliver all manner of excitement and thrills simultaneously a magical world where fistfights, car chases and shootouts are all happening everywhere at the same time.

Sure, the dialog can be clunky, the acting middling, and both logic and reality are often non-existent to explain its dumbed-down plot. But the heart is good enough, the score is quite strong, and the cinematography and effects are all visually top-notch. So when the film also features several of the decades best action scenes in one movie, theres no reason a true action junkie wouldnt enjoy this filmmaking zenith of vehicular carnage - a glorious ode to speed, explosions and all manners of violence.",1435276800,,1560,4.9541984732824424

6183593,4,B00HLTD8RA,"""Furious 7"" (2015) is directed by James Wan (The Conjuring, Insidious, Saw). This film is about Deckard Shaw's (Jason Satham) revenge for his comatose brother Owen Shaw as he tracks down the team of Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto, and Brian O'Conner. This film is an amazing blockbuster film that rivals the Marvel Avenger films for shear spectacular action. Cars are parachuted from cargo carriers, cars careen down mountain sides, one car even crashes through one skyscraper tower over into two other adjacent towers. Paul Walker died at the age of only 40 in a single vehicle accident before the filming was even half finished, however through rewrites and clever editing one would never have known it from the finished film. At the time of this writing it is interesting to note that this film has grossed more than films like Skyfall, and Lord of the Rings, and has moved into the top 4 position for all time earnings for a film just behind Marvel's The Avengers. This franchise just seems to get better and better.",1433635200,,1011,4.816091954022989
6183594,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his tight-knit gang of street racers must battle the brother of a defeated nemesis and rescue a software genius from terrorists.

Holy Christ! That was fun. Who knew James Wan (Saw, Insidious, The Conjuring) could direct such an awe inspiring action flick. Sure he directed the great revenge film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Sentence/dp/B000Y7U97I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Sentence</a>&nbsp;with Kevin Bacon, but he just topped it with this entry to the F&F series. Without a doubt the best one so far. Not only is it the best, it's also the most over-the-top, unrealistic and corny one yet. That's what makes it so special. You have the regulars Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster etc. And they brought back Dwayne Johnson (The Rock)  & Jason Statham and added the fabulous Rhonda Rousey (small cameo fighting Michelle R).

The most surprising addition is certainly Kurt Russell. The man is a legend in my household and I grew up watching him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-from-New-York/dp/B00S0DW46M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape from New York</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thing/dp/B001CW7ZWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thing</a>. Thankfully it looks like Kurt is on the comeback trail. He has the awesome sounding horror/western 'Bone Tomahawk' coming up, and of course 'The Hateful Eight' directed by Quentin Tarantino. Glad to see him again!

I enjoyed the film immensely and the fast pace action. Paul Walker will certainly be missed. His brother finished some of his scenes for him and the ending is a real tear jerker.

6183596,4,B00HLTD8RA,"When THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS was released in 2001, despite becoming a sensation and catapulting leads Vin Diesel and Paul Walker into certified stardom and leading-man status (and for a time, gave director Rob Cohen a bit of a career), it didn't seem like it was exactly the kind of film that would launch a franchise that has lasted for 14 years and giving us seven films. Although in hindsight, it totally is the kind of film that could launch a franchise and a rabid fanbase; it has super-cool leads, super-cool cars, super-hot women, super-intense action, and a bare minimum of plot. Even when the series began to falter with its less-than-interesting entries like TOKYO DRIFT and the fourth film, simply titled FAST AND FURIOUS, it knew that it had to reinvent itself as a true action film franchise. The audience was becoming sick of the constant meaningless racing scenes and wanted something more well action-y, like gunplay and what-not. That gave us FAST FIVE, a balls-out pedal-to-the-medal action film that not only introduced intrepid manhunter Hobbs (Dwayne No Longer The Rock Johnson) to the series but became one of my favorite surprises of 2011. Then came FAST AND FURIOUS 6, which, while entertaining and crazy, was maybe a little too dark for me. Now, in what should be the franchises final film for various reasons but most assuredly won't be (because MONEY), comes FURIOUS 7, the franchises most psychotic and chaotic entry that benefits from some inventive set pieces, some genuine emotional content, and a check your brain at the door aloofness that comes only with absolute confidence that the fans are going to be blown away.

The film opens seemingly moments after the pre-credits ending of 6 where Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham, really relishing the hell out of playing a proper villain) is at the bedside of his comatose younger brother Owen (the previous installments big bad, Luke Evans) and swears vengeance. As he leaves the hospital room, the halls and exterior of the building are LITTERED with bodies of guards and doctors, indicating that Deckard is not a man to be trifled with. Next, we cut back to back in Los Angeles where Hobbs is working late at his office and Deckard sneaks in to gather intel on the crew that hurt his baby brother. An abbreviated fight ensues where Hobbs in blown out of a fifth-floor window, lands on the roof of a car, and still survives. Meanwhile, Dominic Torretto (Vin Diesel) is still assisting Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) in recovering her memory prior to her demise in the fourth film. Still encountering some PTSD, she leaves Dom to try to find what she lost on her own. Meanwhile, Brian OConnor (Paul Walker) is adjusting to life without a mission and being a dad in a minivan taking his son to school. He and his wife Mia (Jordana Brewster) are still (?) living with Dom in his house as Dom finds a package from Japan and gets a call from Deckard, who is just leaving the post-credits sequence from 6 where he has just killed Han (Sung King), and the package blows up Doms house.  A brief connection with Hobbs leaves Dom with the information that the elder Shaw was a British Special Forces soldier that became too extreme for them and has been in hiding for six years until now and is seeking revenge. Dom and Brian reunite with Tej (Chris Ludacris Bridges), Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Letty to meet Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), a super-secret spook with a specific agenda; get Dom and his crew to rescue a hacker called Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel, GAME OF THRONES) who has designed a piece of software called Gods Eye that can hack into any intenet-connected camera on the planet and find any person anywhere. Shes been kidnapped by an international terrorist Jakande (Djimon Hounsou) and is in transit. If Dom can retrieve Gods Eye for Mr. Nobody, he can use it to find Shaw and preferably, kill him.

This leads them on an international game of cat-and-mouse where Dom and crew need to save Ramsey, who is being transported in Jakandes HEAVILY armed convoy in Azerbaijan, where naturally, Shaw is waiting for them. After her mostly-successful rescue, they need to retrieve the program thats been installed into a Jordanian princes supercar in Abu Dhabi, where Shaw is waiting for them. They escape by the skin of their teeth, plug in the Gods Eye and track Shaw who is waiting for them with his new friends, namely Jakandes team. Again, barely escaping, but losing the Maguffin ahem Gods Eye, they retreat to their home turf where the final confrontation will occur across the streets, skies, and rooftops of the City of Angels.

James Wan (the director of SAW and DEATH SENTENCE) takes over for Justin Lin, who directed the previous three films, and turns the crazy up to eleven with sequences that are so astonishingly and ridiculously absurd, even LOONEY TUNES animators would have seen this film and said, Dial it down a notch, man. Yes, its that crazy. The whole finale with the helicopter, the drone and the cars is what Michael Bay must see when hes on LSD, and yet, because its a FAST AND FURIOUS film, it works. Its just SO over the top that you either jump right on board or you just forget it and go see something else. The skydiving cars sequence alone is so inspired yet so defiant of logic, you have a feeling that the filmmakers looked at a statue of Isaac Newton and blew it up with a nitrous tank. Then theres the triple jump across divisions of the Burj Khalifa that is just you get the point. And of course, the film does fit the franchises required quota of 12,000 camera shots taken from a womans butt/crotch level. So don't you worry, male teen and pre-teen audience members; you get your moneys worth here.

There are times where the film insults you, though. I can suspend my disbelief only so long, but when Paul Walker squares off against Tony Jaa (of ONG BAK and THE PROTECTOR), who plays Jakandes lead henchman, there is no way on earth that Paul Walker wins that fight. Not at all. Its literally like if you had a film from the 70s that was unearthed where Robert Redford fought Bruce Lee AND WON. Nope. It just doesnt happen. And the same thing happened in this film as it did in the last film: Michelle Rodriguez fights a series of female MMA champions AND WINS. Last film, it was Gina Carano, and this film, its Ronda Rousey. NOPE.

Of course, as par for the course, no one in the cast of FURIOUS 7 is exactly doing their career-best performance, but they all seem to be having a good time, particularly Statham and Russell, who really sinks his teeth into this role and has almost too much fun with it. Hes far too genial for the head of a super-secret black-ops organization, and that leads me to another point. While the whole idea of the Gods Eye program falling into the hands of the US Government gave me some thoughts on how the film was going to treat that concept, I forgot that this is a FAST AND FURIOUS film, and that it would naturally go nowhere as far as socio-political commentary would be concerned, so don't worry about being confronted with anything intellectually challenging here.

One of the things this film lacked from the previous few entries were some positive steps in the gender politics arena as well. Serious ass-kicking women like Gal Gadot, Gina Carano and Elsa Pataky were introduced and made part of the team for a while. This film gets Letty back on the side of the angels, but sidelines Pataky to about 60 seconds of screen-time and Jordana Brewster is reduced to merely a fretting wife and mother. And though this film does give ample screen-time to Nathalie Emmanuel and Rodriguez, it doesnt really pave the way forward for women in action cinema as the last few films were trying to do.

All this is still kind of moot though, because the world of FAST AND FURIOUS clearly belongs to the Y chromosome half of the population. Im not saying that women shouldnt or don't like it because they clearly do, but this isn't that franchise and it never has been. Whether thats good or bad seems like it should matter, but it doesnt really, because, and Ill say it one last time its a FAST AND FURIOUS film. No one came in here trying to change the world; they just wanted to bring some entertainment to the masses. And they succeeded. And I'm not trying to say that in a snobbish way; I've seen ALL of these films, and for the most part, I enjoy them.

I would be extremely remiss if I didn't take a moment to comment on the tragic death of Paul Walker. He has always been a fine performer even if he seemed a little wooden at times, and his connection to the fans of this franchise is indeed powerful. The tribute this film pays to him is quite moving even if the moments of CGI Paul Walker are a little distracting. I cried a little. He'll certainly be missed.

While FURIOUS 7 won't be a serious contender for my year-end Best Of list, its certainly a lot of fun, even if while you're watching it, you can feel people like Bill Nye and Neil Degrasse-Tyson having conniptions.

However, since Fast and Furious they have not let me down and this movie was no exception. This is by far the second best film in the series...and quite honestly probably only viewed that way by me because The Fast and the Furious is the one that got me hooked. There is plenty in this movie for fans of all kinds of genres. I would, however, suggest if you aren't familiar with the franchise familiarize yourself with the last two movies first (at the very least).

And it gets one star if you just like movies.
I mean do not misunderstand me, it is a fan to watch action movie,
with great cars, great guns, great bad lines, and a lot of wild driving
and unrealistic scenes, which are kind of natural in the series.
Still, there are some scenes here that go over the top, unique in
cinema history (remember that when you watch the skyscraper scene).
But once again they over do it (eg they even include a drone in a scene)
and that is why there are those who like the series and a lot who don't
There is no need to talk plot since no one really cares if there is one.
Of course, like we all know this is the last movie in the series that Paul Walker did,
and to that extent, the necessary respect is given to him in this movie.

I will say that this is the worst movie of the series. I know it's Hollywood and everything is exaggerated but this goes above and beyond. I finished the movie just to make fun of everything about it, especially something like Vin diesel lifting up the car with his bare hands so Paul Walker can tinker underneath it then driving across the 3 towers. What a joke. What makes me more mad than that stuff is how commercialized it was. You have these dumb celebrity cameos like Ronda rousey and iggy azalea and there's a ton of name brand crap all around. I absolutely loved the first one. Minimal story line a lot of racing and not 20 scenes of choreographed fights which is what you get in this one.

6183641,1,B00HLTD8RA,"This movie was absolutely ridiculous. I've been a huge fan of the series since the beginning and yeah there are some parts in every fast and the furious movie but this one seems like every scene of action was beyond stupid and unrealistic. There was more cars flying through the air than driving on the road, only one racing scene and some street driving and a hijack is about all you get in this one along with some crazy car crashes where the driver gets out uninjured. If you're a fan of the series you should watch this movie to appreciate the old ones that much more. There was one good part to this movie and that was the end because 1. The tribute to Paul Walker 2. The movie was done. Sadly this movie will not make it on the shelf next to all the other fast and the furious DVDs I own. Sad but true.",1431216000,9,808,4.1528662420382165
6183642,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Not only did I love this film but I love the whole franchise. As a woman, this is one of my favorite action films.
I love the way the ending came when all the actors dedicated this to Paul Walker especially doing the tribute. It was sad to lose such a great actor in a tragic accident, no one expected it to happen. I will surely miss him in movies but we can always go back and watch his films anytime. Not only I give kudos to his buddies on and off film, I also give kudos to his brother Cody for standing in on his behalf. They surely do look alike and if they do an 8th installment, would love him to join the Fast Family and come as Brian's younger brother. Good job on this movie. Will always be a fan. Miss you Paul :)",1431129600,3,726,3.945578231292517
6183643,5,B00HLTD8RA,Never a disappointment. I enjoyed ever Fast and Furious movies. The cast is perfect and I love how they kept everyone and their relationship is great. This movie was the best because of the tribute they made to Paul. It was very heartbreaking to see Paul in the movie and then know that he's gone at the end. I hope they make a huge box collection when they stop making the movies. It's definitely a collection to keep.,1431043200,2,419,4.384615384615385
6183644,4,B00HLTD8RA,"This is way, way, way over the top, but consistently fun and enjoyable. Nice to see so many top stars crammed into an exciting film, and any movie where Jason Statham faces off against both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson is a must. Contains one of the best lines in movie history: Leti: ""Did you bring the cavalry?"" Hobbs: ""Woman, I am the cavalry.""",1430697600,4,348,4.453125
6183645,4,B00HLTD8RA,"If you expect the Fast & Furious sequel Furious 7 to be over-the-top balls-to-the-wall action with frenetic and quick-cut fight sequences, explosions, big tough guys carrying on as big tough guys, explosions, lots of people yelling and screaming as they drive really fast in some hot hot hot cars that defy both physics and gravity, explosions, and glimpses of women dressed all shexshay as they dance and strut around cars and poolsand explosions, then you might be just a little disappointed to find out that there aren't as many explosions as you might have expected in this latest entry to the Paul Walker/ Vin Diesel action/adventure series that has really taken ahold of the gonzo action elements and run with them.  It also manages to give a nice nod and touching send off to beloved star Paul Walker who passed away during filming; the end of the movie made me cry and I really didn't want to/ tried not to.  Walker really will be missed.

Plot: Following directly from Fast 6 (not a bad idea to watch that before you view this one, but also not necessary for new viewers) Walkers Brian OConnor is trying to adjust to the sedate role of dad in the minivan crowd and Diesels Dominic Toretto is hanging out at in the barrio when they receive an explosive delivery from baddie Deckard Shaw (played by an always visceral Jason Statham) who is a black ops English badass who is looking to take revenge on the people who killed his brother (see the aforementioned Fast 6 for relevant history).  What transpires is Deckards almost success and it prompts Dom and Brian to reconvene their crew one last time and take the fight to Deckard.  Along the way they get the help from a covert U.S. Special Forces team that they have to help in order to get what they want.  You can expect the U.S. team to double-cross them, of course.  The F&F crew (or family as they refer to each other) go on a globe-trotting mission before finally returning to their L.A. stomping grounds for the final showdown with Deckard and other baddies.  In the end not all of the family will be coming back

I have been careful not to give away any major spoilers in my summary, but there may be some (mis)leading elements there.  What I will say is that this entry continues the trend of the series to pack a walloping amount within the film and include new stars even if in essentially cameo roles.  Fans of mega-MMA star Ronda Rousey will get a brief glimpse of her in an action scene that I felt was unnecessary and didn't showcase her potential (while she wasn't a stand-out in Expendables 3 she did work well within that movie).  Grizzled action anti-hero Kurt Russel shows up as a kinda corny Special Forces division head who can make things happen.  Tony Jaa also shows up as a superior hand-to-hand combatant and its a pleasure to watch his fluid and creative choreography and movements.  Relative newcomer and new addition to the F&F family is Ramsey (played by Brit Nathalie Emmanuel who is cute as a button but not given anything substantial to do other than look goodwhich she does.) but the real steal here is Statham.  Early on in the movie he has a physical showdown with Hobbs (Dwayne The Rock Johnson) that turns out to be a fun fight and establishes him as a worthy villain but the movie also sets it up for us to suspect that well only be seeing him again at the end.  Fortunately for us this is not so as Statham routinely (and unexplainedly) turns up throughout the movie to hunt down and harry our heroes.  Hes a real pain in their necks and (spoiler) you don't actually see him dieso.sequel?  I wouldnt mind seeing him turn up again.  At any rate there are some ridiculous action sequences like cars driving down a forested mountainside, some nicely staged fights like Walker versus Jaa or Statham versus the Rock, surprise relationship reveals like Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Doms (censored), and lots of unexplained happenstance.  Par for the course.

My main complaint about the movie is the editing.  They give us interesting visual angles and some fun camera tricks but Im not sure that theres a camera shot that ever stays on track for more than 4-5 seconds!  This drives me nuts.  This must feel like what it is to have visual ADHD.  At times it can help create excitement or tension but when its overly used it becomes distracting (and sometimes disorienting).  This, in combo with the movies actual length (running about 2 hours and 10 minutes before end credits), makes the movie feel longer than it should.  If you liked, really liked, or loved the previous two installments to the F&F franchise then you should at least enjoy the movie.  I think that it provides a nice stopping point to the franchise, is a smart and reverent way to bow out deceased star Walker, but 5 & 6 were ultimately better and cleaner films than this busy and buzzy clocker that is all kinds of summer popcorn crazy.",1430438400,14,4901,4.608745684695052

6183667,5,B00HLTD8RA,"It took me just about 3 years of Patients to see this movie I couldn't wait for it to come out. I followed every social media post they had for this movie, to tell you how much is done and what have they finished. Ive seen every single post and mini clips about the movie and every part was exiting. When the movie came out it gave me excitement, Goosebumps, and laughter. I would love to watch this movie over and over again and won't get sick of it. Every part of this movie makes you feel in an alternative way, some parts might make you want to tear up, while some other parts want you to laugh out loud that youll get shushed by the people around you.
The animation is just too respectable because most of the film was produced by CGI technology.  For Example; the makers of the film used CGI to keep Paul walker in the movie because of his recent death and replaced him with his brother to keep the movie going and CGI technology made is possible by making Paul walkers face appear on his brother body as he is acting out his part.
All of the animations and stunts grab your attention through the whole movie. Some of the stunts that took my Attention and made me retell them to others were, when Vin diesel raced his car on the middle of a Skyscraper and zoomed out the window while jumping to the next Skyscraper and going right though it and surprising everyone with his entrance though the window that was 100 story tall. With that he also continued fighting the criminals.
It is easy to keep up with the whole plot of the movie. I would recommend this movie to any one that hasn't seen it yet, and also recommend their previous movies witch are also fantastic. All the fast and furious movies are just too exiting to watch. You will not be disappointed with this movie at all and its worth all the money they expect from you.

 Fast and the furious 7 is not a film that is going to win any of the Academy Awards, but it is a film that will keep you entertained for two hours and will not make your time a waist. This Film is worth the time and money for you to go and see it in the theater. It is the best one in the series.

Be sure not to go over the speed limit after you see this movie because it made me want to race a few cars on the way home!!!",1430352000,7,2262,4.122448979591836
6183668,4,B00HLTD8RA,"It was about fourteen years ago that the original Fast and the Furious was made, and since then I have seen all of the hit franchise. Like its predecessors, Furious Seven is a fun movie with a lot of over-the-top action sequences (in which cars can fly!), but this time it has an unexpectedly emotional ending, especially for the fans of the series.

The story is simple. One character played by Jason Statham, seeking revenge for his severely injured brother, threatens the peaceful life of Dominic (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker). To fight back the new enemy, Dominic and the crew agree to accept the offer of Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), leader of a covert ops team, and to obtain a computer program God's Eye that can locate anyone almost instantly.

With the franchises signature stunt work including outrageous car action, Furious Seven offers lots of action set-pieces, but the most impressive part of the film is its conclusion, where the filmmakers say goodbye to Paul Walker in a fitting way.

If you have not seen any of the franchise, probably Furious Seven would not be the best starting point. You would think characters are too many (and they are), and some episodes seem pointless. For anyone who has been following the series for years, Furious Seven would be a great ride that is both enjoyable and poignant.",1430265600,12,1329,4.794759825327511
6183669,4,B00HLTD8RA,"Theatrical review. Possible spoilers. In what I expect will be one of the biggest movies of the year, the series may also have produced the best chapter yet. This edition picks up close to where the last one ended. After dispatching bad guy, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) in the earlier film we see his bad-ass older brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) pledge revenge on Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew beginning with his government accomplice Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson).

We know that Shaw isn't to be trifled with early on as he and Hobbs go mano y mano with only Hobbs being sent to the hospital. Shaw, having hacked Hobbs's computer has the names and locations of everyone and begins his vengeful killing spree in Tokyo and almost gets Dom, his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), his new brother-in-law, Brian (Paul Walker) and their toddler, with a bomb. After this happens, Dom gets that look in his eye and vows to go after Shaw.

In a secondary plotline, a secretive quasi-government unit headed by ""Mr. Nobody"" (a scene stealing Kurt Russell), wants Dom and his crew to rescue a tech-genius named Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel from ""Game of Thrones""). She's developed a system that can track anyone in the world by hacking into traffic cameras, computers, cell phones and any and all electronic devices and using sophisticated facial recognition software. If the crew can pull it off, Dom is promised access in order to track down Shaw.

This is all just an excuse to kick-start a couple of hours of non-stop action sequences, the best of which is Dom, Brian, Letty (Michelle Rodrigues) who still has memory loss, Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris) sky-dive...along with their cars...onto an otherwise obscure mountain highway in Azerbaijan. This undetected approach allows them to find and rescue Ramsey, but only after a series of remarkably staged and executed stunts involving cars, stunt drivers and the actors.

Unlike previous F & F films, I found these to be tension-filled in addition to the action. Djimon Hounsou shows up here as the leader of the group who kidnapped Ramsey, along with Asian action star Tony Jaa who has a fearsome fight with Brian in this sequence and later in the film. All of this nonsense clears the way for some even more ridiculous, but downright brilliant scenes shot in Abu Dhabi where Dom launches a $3.5 million super car through a series of glassy skyscrapers.

Eventually the gang returns to L. A. with Shaw and Jakande (Hounsou) hot on their trail with the ""God's Eye"" device in their pocket. In addition to some terrific action sequences and well-choreographed fights, the movie concludes with an emotional send off to Walker who died in the middle of shooting the film in 2013. While it plays within the confines of the script, it is also an obvious fond farewell from the hearts of the actors. Yeah, it's authentic and it's touching.",1430179200,7,2882,4.861507128309572

This is a great guy movie - it is also a great girls night out movie, and a great date movie - it truly has something for everyone.

This has everything you expect from the Furious franchise, but an even bigger focus on family.  The funny thing is, after watching this, it made me think a lot of the Disney animated movie Lilo & Stitch :).

I loved the addition of Kurt Russell, as well as Jason Statham, who plays pretty much the same character he always plays, just on the villain side this time.

Amazing what they did with this movie from a continuity and filming perspective given the timing of the situation with Paul Walker, all I can say is wow, and there has to be some sort of award for this movie this year.  The tribute at the end was extremely moving, and if you are a Paul Walker fan, you might find yourself welling up just a bit (or more).  Made me think a bit about my friends as well.

So go have a great time and don't miss this one!  If you haven't seen the others in the franchise, make sure to see what you've missed - it helps make the story that much more interesting.  But regardless, it is a hell of a ride!",1430006400,112,1355,4.153256704980843

Most of the movie was entertaining, altho incredibly unbelievable--and I don't mean that in a good way.  The stunts and special effects get 5 stars, such as they were, while the storyline and acting get 2 stars at best.  So, I'm awarding 3 stars overall.  That being said, after you've produced 6 movies of this type, what are you going to do to make #7 stand out?  The over-used clichs and ""cliff-hanger"" events were so predictable, I could have written this script.  The actors put a lot of effort into grunting out their dialogue--when there was dialogue.  One-to-five-word sentences were the norm.  But, hey, do you really go see this movie for the great acting and witty banter?  The wife said she really enjoyed it because of all the cute guys...  Oh well, I'm pretty sure I will never watch this movie again.  I probably wouldn't have watched it in the first place, but I got (2) ""free"" vouchers from Castrol when I did my last oil change for my car.

Our tickets for IMAX were $12.25 each (the vouchers were for up to $13 each).  I also could have waited for this one to come out on DVD and paid about $3 for a rental the whole family could watch together.

6183684,4,B00HLTD8RA,"Im not sure when exactly it happened (probably around 2011s Fast Five, thanks Dwayne), but the Fast & Furious Franchise quickly became a serious guilty pleasure of mine.

Since moving from a street racing-based franchise to an Avengers-esq gathering of franchise heroes with a touch of Oceans 11-style high-end heisting, I haven't been able to escape these films. Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6 mark two of the most insanely enjoyable action movies of the decade so far, so it goes without saying that I  like many others of you  was very much looking forward to Furious 7 for Summer 2014.

Unfortunately, however, life had another plan for us all. With the tragic  and ironic  death of star Paul Walker in a high-speed car crash during a production break, Universal Pictures, and the films cast (lead by star and producer Vin Diesel) had to take a long step away from the film, and really decide if they wanted to finish it  and also  if they could finish the film.

Furious 7 finally hit theaters last week, and Im pleased to say that while the final film doesnt entirely hit the highs of Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6, the end result is another insane action film, filled with heart as it sends off one of its key players.

Set shortly after Fast & Furious 6  which in and of itself is sort of followed by Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift, the third film in the franchise  Furious 7 thrusts us into the world of Deckard Shaw (action legend Jason Statham). Shaw is the brother of Owen Shaw  the villain of the last installment  who is out for revenge, aimed directly at Dominic Torretto (Diesel) and his makeshift family, the stars of this franchise. He kills off Asian racer Han (as shown in the post-credits scene of Fast & Furious 6), he puts Hobbs (Dwayne The Rock Johnson) in the hospital, and is aiming to take the rest of the crew out.

This of course worries Dom, as he is obsessed with two things: cars, and the protection of his family, which has become a bit more official with his sister Mias (Jordana Brewster) involvement with ex-cop Brian OConnor (Paul Walker). The two even have a child now, which means that Brian cant quite get called into as many insane adventures anymore. Add that Doms love interest Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is still dealing with the amnesia she had when she came back from the dead  yes, thats a thing  and Doms got a lot on his plate this installment.

This plot  somewhat straight forward, pitting Dom vs. Shaw in a battle to protect everything he knows and loves  is further complicated with three additions: (1) a shadowy government organization lead by Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), who wishes to have Dom help them find (2) a hacker named Ramsey (Game of Thrones Nathalie Emmanuel), who is being held captive by (3) a terrorist group lead by Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou), who wishes to have control of an observation software called the Gods Eye, which allows the user to monitor every and all camera, cellphone communication and satelite to track anyone in the world. They tie this together as Mr. Nobody offering Dom the chance to easily find Shaw in return for completing the rescue mission, but as you can see  its three additional plot points that muddy a pretty straightforward story.

Perhaps this is due to the off screen tragedy  with the movie only half complete at the time of Walkers passing, director James Wan (Insidious), Vin Diesel and writer Chris Morgan worked hard to pull the movie back together and deliver something that both came together and and served as a farewell to Walkers character.

For the most part  they succeeded.

The action remains intense and insane, featuring the same eye-popping stunts and mind-bending physics fans have come to expect in the franchise. Since the shift of the franchise after Fast Five, Furious 7 again delivers an Avengers-esq gathering of leads who do the impossible. The action peaks somewhat early with a jaw dropping smash-and-grab sequence where the team aims to rescue Ramsey, which involves a mountain side race, mounted turrets, a giant armored bus, and (of course) a group of cars being dropped from an airplane. Wan, who is new to the franchise, shows himself an adept director of action, shooting very unique hand-to-hand combat with dizzying camera work, but has the steady hand to allow the vehicular action to breathe, letting fans take in how crazy the creators of this franchise are to do what they do with (mostly) real cars completing the stunts.

I could mention a few flaws of the film, namely that with Han and Giselle gone (and Hobbs sidelined), the cast doesnt feel as fun, and how new additions Tony Jaa and Rhonda Rousey basically just serve the film to star in some visceral fight sequences (which in Rouseys case, may be best  shes an incredible fighter, but not so great at the line readsstill love you, girl!). But the fact is, in the face of incredible adversity, Wan, Diesel and the entire Furious family pulled this film together. Sometimes it definitely feels held together by gum, spit and hope, but it remains another immensely enjoyable installment in arguably one of the finest franchises going today.

Besides, Furious 7 deserves all of your money for finally proving one thing: Iggy Azalea causes PTSD.",1428883200,6,5243,4.730769230769231

6183704,1,B00HLTD8RA,"The original fast and furious film was believable drama and down to earth. It didn't need a sequel but we live in a time when directors would rather turn a movie into a franchise and milk the same idea instead of creating an original idea. Furious 7 as well as the other 5 sequels to the original film in this series have made tons of cash but in the process have sacrificed all realism. Besides a nice ending for the late Paul Walkers character Brian O Connor, Furious 7 is a soulless film that gives us nothing but over the top action scenes and a further soiling of the original films legacy.

Let's begin by turning the clock back briefly: First film good, Second film decent, third film ok, things were going downhill but as far as movie franchises go it could have been worse. Then it got worse. If the rushed storyline and ridiculous underground tunnel chase of the 4th film wasn't when the franchise went into the toilet they gave us The Rock! Yes The Rock: a wwe wrestler and 45 year old man who wears a leotard and pretends to fight other men! He's also an ""actor"" who's given us such brilliant classics as....oh yeah all those movies he was in suck! Then let's add .... Drumroll!.... Jason Statham! Yes the guy who has stared in more action movies then there are stars in the sky but only made one that was any good (crank). Yes let's take 2 well known celebs and bad actors to add to the cast because of course that helps create realism! Oh and let's bring back Lucas Black because we all know everyone loved his performance in Tokyo Drift so much so that he was fired after only 1film!

Let's be real here everyone it's only this popular because of Paul Walkers death. Like Nirvana before Kurt Cobains suicide this film series was doing well financially but was nowhere near the success it is today breaking box office records. Unlike Nirvana the quality of the product doesn't deserve the ridiculous money it's taking in. People need to boycott movie franchises for this madness to end. If your going to make 7 movies why not just become a tv series? Unfortunately this story will keep continuing as long as you support it but it's 6 and counting sequels are all unjustified.

Franchises should only be allowed when they work. The new direction this franchise started in the 4th film and through Furious 7 is an insult to the fans intelligence. What will they do for fast and furious 8? Maybe they can team up with Dog the bounty hunter and hunt Isis! Oh and for the 9th film they will team up with William Shatner and hunt aliens!

In closing please boycott all sequels to any movie so hollywood will be forced to actually make real movies again.

6183705,3,B00HLTD8RA,"One last ride.

Furious 7 was the first movie I was really excited to see this year. It really signals the kick-off of ""movie season"" for me, the summer blockbusters that wait until the heat hits to pop your popcorn and steam the ice from your Coca-Cola. I love the Furious series. Like I said in my review of Fast & Furious 6, it's gone from a movie about an underground street racer to a crew of super heros, doing battle with villains on an unbelievable level. It's like as if a 13 year old boy's imagination has been transplanted to the screen. I hope that in Fast & Furious 8, they battle the Avengers.

Furious 7 continues to build where Fast & Furious 6 left off story-wise. The brother of a fallen villain comes to avenge him (played by Jason Statham). While avoiding him, the Fast crew is also tasked with grabbing an electronic gadget called 'God's Eye' for a U.S. shadow operation, which can track people in real time, wherever they are in the world. How will they grab the gadget from militants while avoiding Statham? With cars, of course. With lots and lots of cars.

You come to a Fast & Furious movie for the stunts. This one doesn't disappoint there. Taking things to yet another level, we have cars dropping out of the sky in the mountains, flying between skyscrapers in Abu Dabi, and screetching through the streets of L.A. There's also a fair bit of hand to hand combat here, and it's well done - Tony Jaa (The Protector, Ong Bak) is introduced to American audiences in Furious 7, and his talent is on full display. It almost made me forget about the pile of crap that was The Protector 2.

The cast is one of the reasons people keep coming back to the Furious series. They've obviously got buckets of chemistry (not including Michelle Rodriguez, who just seems out of place in every scene she shares with anyone) from the years of working together (since 2001). Unfortunately, this marks the last movie of Paul Walker's short career. The movie was not finished when he passed away, but the CGI is so well done that it was never distracting seeing Walker on screen. There were only a few scenes that were obvious to me that there was work done, but it never took me out of the movie. A scene where Brian talks on the phone with Mia was particularly choppy, but I have got to give the editors credit here. What a job they did. The Rock is fabulous as always, Statham was great, and there were a lot of bit cameos from old players in the series.

Furious 7 isn't lacking, however. The dialogue here seems to have gotten worse, something that I didn't think was possible after Fast & Furious 6. The one liners are god awful (""You know the thing about street fights? The street always wins.""), with only The Rock getting laughs out of my audience. The story is filled with the same ridiculousness you've come to expect from the series. Statham's character magically appears in any country the crew travels to with the necessary gear to head them off at all times. If you've ever played Friday the 13th on the original NES, he reminds me of Jason. Anywhere, any time. Like he teleports. There are also very little consequences to our characters actions. Destroy three buildings in a foreign country? Next scene - back in L.A. There are maybe 3 cops shown in the entire movie, and their cars are dispatched of instantly. Again, this is par for the course, but it could have been done a bit smarter. There are also a curious amount of ass shots from women in bikinis. Anywhere they go, there's an ass to look at. My pal Moose put it pretty well - there are three speeds to this movie. 1, the rap video - slow motion women dancing or walking from behind set to music. 2, the soap opera with awful dialogue. 3, balls to the wall action.

As everything wraps up, they have a touching tribute for the late Paul Walker with a Vin Diesel voice over. It's a touching moment, and I swear someone was chopping onions in the theater while that was happening.

This wasn't my favorite Fast & Furious installment. Far from it, actually. I think Justin Lin was the perfect director for this, and he moved on to direct the Terminator series. James Wan does pretty well with what he had to work with, but it didn't do for me what 5 & 6 did.

My final score: C+",1428278400,5,4258,4.42911877394636
6183706,5,B00HLTD8RA,"I've got nothing but praise for this movie.  Here we are, the seventh film in to a long running franchise and it just happens to be one of the best, one of the most unique and one of the most creative yet.  Throughout the Fast and Furious series, the franchise has slowly grown from its humble beginnings as an undercover cop film that featured street racers and fast cars to something bigger and more bombastic with each new entry.  No complaints from this guy either.  I've loved the ride.  Furious 7 to me is the most ""blockbuster"" film of the series to date.  I honestly don't think this movie was any less exciting or ""big"" than any Marvel movie I've seen except for maybe Avengers and Winter Soldier.  It was a huge movie, even more ambitious than the 6th which I thought was extremely ambitious in its own right.  This has instantly become one of my favorites in the series easily on Par with #1 and #5 my other two favorites.

  I also wanted to say what I thought about the Paul Walker situation.  The way his character is handled in this film is nothing short of brilliant.  I know the film was only half finished when he passed away, but you would never know it.  The character ""Brian"" has no less screen time than he has always had.  And keeping this spoiler free, the way they handled writing him out of further movies was straight up brilliant, touching and moved at least this guy to tears.  Honestly.  It was a tragedy that Paul Walker died so young and his unfortunate passing must have created a huge problem for the production of this film that could've ended up leaving it a complete disaster.  Luckily that was not the case.  I would love to shake the hands of everyone involved in making this movie for the way that they handled Paul's passing and finishing the filming with his character still completely intact.  It was an outstanding tribute to an integral player in this franchise and an actor taken before his time.  I'm sure it was not an easy undertaking.  The creative team behind this film all deserve all the kudos in the world for the most respectful send off of Paul Walker they could have possibly come up with.  I'm sure his family and friends would be proud, as would he.",1428278400,373,2208,4.465
6183707,5,B00HLTD8RA,"FURIOUS 7 delivers more over the top action, extremely attractive tough women, and of course badass cars. Originally titled FAST AND FURIOUS 7 the film was slated for a July 2014 release, but around Thanksgiving 2013 the world received tragic news that Paul Walker died in a car accident while hosting a charity event. Universal Studios and the film makers shut down production temporarily to mourn the loss of a great man. Paul Walker's 2 brothers stepped in to help finish the movie.

FURIOUS 7 takes directly after FAST AND FURIOUS 6, and the sins of London have follow Dominic Toretto and his family to his LA home, as Deckhart Shaw (Jason Statham) seeks revenge for Toretto's family for crippling his brother Owen Shaw. But lets be honest, you don't see a Fast and Furious movie for story (like TRANSFORMERS) you see it for pure, over the top fun and FURIOUS 7 delivers that with ease.

Newcomers include Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Ronda Rousey, Djimon Hounson, Tony Jaa, and a actress from Game of Thrones who plays a mysterious character. And just like Dwayne Johnson from FAST FIVE, they all fit perfectly in this movie. Most notably Kurt Russell and Jason Statham. Kurt Russell fits perfectly in this movie and plays a likable fun character. And Jason Statham for the first time plays the a villain in a movie, and he's also perfect in the movie.

Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Ludacris, Tyrese Gibson, Jordana Brewster, Dwayne Johnson, and Michelle Rodriguez return and are good as ever. But you might be disappointed if you love The Rock's character Hobbs, cause he's not in the movie that much, even though there's a reason why.

FURIOUS 7 is the best FAST AND FURIOUS to date, and the end of the movie a amazing, emotional, farewell tribute to Paul Walker. Trust me when you see the movie, you will shed a tear at the end.",1428192000,19,1832,4.697819314641745
6183708,5,B00HLTD8RA,"As fate would have it bad guy Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) has a vengeful brother Deckard (Jason Statham) who seeks out our heroes. Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) still has memory issues. Deckard shows up in LA (and anywhere else in the world at random) as ""the sins of London have followed us home.""

The film gets a bit weird in it effort to create over-the-top action. It seems Deckard is former British special ops who is an expert at being a ghost. His own unit is attempting to take him out as well. This becomes ""a war between shadows and ghosts"" as head spook Kurt Russell claims. Now in order to find Deckard, who always finds them, they must first rescue Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has the ultimate hacking chip called God's Eye whereby they can locate anybody in the world. This way they can track Deckard who is hunting them. The crew goes on a world tour.

The film includes cars parachuting from planes; a cat fight in formal wear (Ronda Rousey): building jumping; bullet proof everything; cars with no airbags; and the destruction of LA. The action was so incredibly impossible it made me laugh along with the cheesy lines. Oh yes. They re-invented the word ""cliff hanger.""

There was a nice tribute to Paul Walker at the end of the film.",1428192000,,1247,4.582959641255606
6183709,3,B00HLTD8RA,"Nine Things About the Film ""Furious 7""

1. It's kinda cool to see the fast and furious gang back again. But the series now needs to fit in the category of ""fantasy"", because everybody has become magical, indestructible superheroes, and the plot has absolutely nothing to do with reality. And I understand why the title was shortened to ""Furious 7"". The movie is kind of slow until the last 45 minutes.

2. For some reason, James Wan directed this movie. Up to now, he has only directed horror movies (he's most famous for ""Saw"").

3. There are actually two plots in the film. The first is a continuation of part 6. Jason Statham plays Deckard, the brother of the bad guy in the last film. Statham is probably best known as the guy in ""The Transporter"", and he plays basically the same character in this film. I suspect that Deckard really is the Transporter, and this is what he does between jobs.

4. The second plot is about a secret organization in the government that is looking for a hacker. Even though they have all the resources, computer experts, and hundreds of agents, they can't get the hacker. So they hire these six renegade car racers to do it.

5. The technology in the film is very interesting. It turns out that if you put a bomb on the front porch of a house, the house will explode from the inside. Also, there is now a little computer chip that allows you to look at every camera, computer, and cell phone in the world, at the same time.  Oh yeah, and if you want to override the security system of one of the richest men in the world, all you have to do is open the phone outlet and cut the orange wire.

6.  Paul Walker died halfway through filming, so the script had to be rewritten, and Walker's brothers were used as stand-ins for him. Computer effects were added onto the brothers to make them look like Paul. Yes, Paul Walker has become computer-generated.

7.  Lucas Black, the star of the 3rd ""Fast and Furious"" film, has a cameo in this movie. He has signed on to be in part 8 and 9.

8. The film came up with a classy way to write Paul Walker out of the story, while guaranteeing that the series will continue. And the best part of the movie is the very end, which is a tribute to Paul.

9. This movie is dumb, loud, and ridiculous. But if you know what you're getting into (and you should, considering this is the 7th movie), it's not terrible.",1428192000,4,2377,4.340857787810384
6183710,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Director James Wan who is known mainly for horror movies (Insidious, Saw, The Conjuring), was new to the Fast and Furious franchise. He had the task of making a 7th film that is and remains popular to movie-goers and fans alike.  I have been anticipating this movie for a LONG time, and today I will review the movie Furious 7.

Set after the rollercoaster that was Fast and Furious 6, we see Dom take Letty to a familiar event known as race wars-in hopes to trigger her memory. Meanwhile, Brian is also behind the wheel; the wheel of a minivan taking his son Jack to school. Over in London however, we meet a man Deckard Shaw who is at a hospital visiting his injured brother Owen Shaw (Fast and Furious 6's main villain) and seeing his brother in this condition, he swears revenge on those who put his brother in his hospital bed. And so begins Furious 7.

Returning as Dominic Toretto, Vin Diesel gives another good performance in the movie. You mess with a member of Dominic's family, then he definitely shows why that is a BAD idea. Dwayne Johnson stars as Luke Hobbs and does a fantastic job. Though Hobb's is not in the movie a lot, he delivers his usual one-liners and delivers some memorable action scenes; especially the one between Hobbs and Deckard Shaw. And for those of you that read my Fast Five review, I said that there was going to be a ""familiar action star- a damn good one at that"". And that action star is  Jason Statham as primary antagonist Deckard Shaw. In my opinion, he did a really good job. Not only does Shaw has the moves, he has a ton of artillery, and some unexpected allies that assist in his chaos. I had a blast watching Statham as Shaw. Michelle Rodriguez portrays Letty Ortiz and I feel she does A LOT better in Furious 7 than she has in the previous films. Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris provide the movie with humor as Roman and Tej, while martial artists Ronda Rousey and Tony Jaa kick a lot of serious butt as Kara and Kiet. Nathalie Emmanuel and actor Djimon Hounsou star as Megan Ramsey and Mose Jakande and both of them do a really great job in the movie. Kurt Russell stars as Mr. Nobody(that is his name) and does an exceptional job assisting Dominic and the crew in tracking Shaw. And finally, actor Paul Walker makes his final appearance as the man fans have come to know as Brian O'Conner. Not only does he have some incredible action scenes(which I will speak on in a minute), but the Furious 7 does a great job in providing fans with a touching tribute to Paul Walker. Great job by the cast.

Story wise, Its may seem like Furious 7's main point is revenge. But I like how the movie kept the theme of family from Fast and Furious 6  and shows the importance and bond of a family. On to the action scenes, I can not say enough about how well the action scenes are in the movie. The fight scenes are choreographed and sequenced so smoothly. I especially enjoyed (MILD SPOILER) Hobbs vs Shaw, and all of Brian's fight scenes were nicely detailed. What is even more likable is that Furious 7 knows exactly what type of movie it is and delivers in terms of action, the actors/actresses(especially Rodriguez, Johnson, Walker, and Statham), the gorgeous scenery and set locations of the movie, the direction of James Wan, and because Furious 7 keeps the viewer's attention the entire duration of the movie. While I would certainly like to see the franchise end here out of respect to Paul Walker, I have heard rumors that there will be not only 8th, but a 9th, and 10th movie. But if you needed any further detail of why you should see this movie then I will end my review just by saying GO SEE Furious 7 because it is

A Great Experience

6183712,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Just saw Furious 7 and will probably go back to see it again for the moments I missed the first time.  I have seen all of the movies in this franchise and look forward to each new installment.  The actors have grown in abilities, and in the sense of family .  Granted the action has increased from being somewhat plausible to crashing a sports car through high rise buildings in a foreign country.  But people, we go to the movies for entertainment, not reality!  After all, we have accepted, loved,  and spent lots of money on other movies that were beyond belief.  When is the last time your sister decided to marry a talking teddy bear?  Do you think all the displays in your local museum come to life after dark?  Don't forget ""Beam me up, Scotty"" or your sports car changing into a robot.  Suspension of belief is what we need sometimes.

We can get enough reality on the nightly news where the bad guys seem to be winning.  I love to see movies where it finally looks like the good guys can fight fire with fire.  Dom isn't afraid to throw down and neither are any of his 'family'. They get several extra points for showing the strength and abilities in women, especially Letty, instead of just throwing in mindless eye candy. All movies have some beautiful women just for the sake of showing some skin...but at least they let Letty be strong, physical, as well as showing her emotions and beauty without having to take her clothes off every other scene. Great character, glad they brought her back.  Dom's character needed Letty.  It is refreshing to see an alpha that fights FOR his family instead going home after his day at work and abusing his wife and kids.  And he isn't ashamed to say that  family is what is important.
After watching the franchise all these years, it feels as if  they are family to us.  It is sad that one of the family is gone...we will miss Paul and the films he would have made.  They did well at honoring him in the completion of this movie and a beautiful job of saying ""farewell"" to Brian.  Families have loss and go on with life.  I would be terrible for this franchise family to call it quits and unravel  because one of them is no longer here.

of this.  There are many more entertaining chapters and storylines that could be explored.",1428192000,,2277,4.442028985507246
6183713,4,B00HLTD8RA,"The Fast & Furious series occupies a very unique place for movie lovers. One the one hand, its without a shadow of a doubt the most successful original franchise Hollywood has seen in decades, and has built a loyal following of fans who will accept any amount of over-the-top hokum it throws at them. On the other side are those who don't understand why people care about these obviously terrible movies. What the latter group fails to get, and the bombastic, gratuitous, and pure awesomeness of Furious 7 won't convince them, is how deeply personal these movies are when boiled down to their very essence.

No greater example of the close-knit ties between this franchise and its fans exists than in Furious 7, which sadly marks the final screen role for the late Paul Walker. His death in the middle of production creates a chasm that simply can't be filled, even with his twin brothers filling in noticeably in various scenes. But it's more than just the physical stuff we miss. The oft-cited theme of ""family' is pumped up more than ever in Chris Morgan's screenplay, and every scene with Walker brings a little pang of hurt. While there's a deeply sentimental tone throughout, Furious 7 is also the biggest, loudest, and ""holy crap that was incredible!!!"" chapter yet. It's like injecting Red Bull straight into your veins and pouring liquid speed into your eyeballs.

Once considered the red-headed stepchild, 2006's 'Tokyo Drift' is now one of the most important installments as things finally came full circle after the death of Han (Sung Kang) at the hands of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), the older brother to Owen Shaw who was seemingly killed in Fast & Furious 6. Deckard is an unstoppable force, and after making his presence felt in explosive fashion, he goes toe-to-toe in the ultimate machismo showdown against Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), leaving Hobbs laid up in the hospital. If that doesn't establish Shaw as the baddest man on the planet nothing else will.

While Shaw seeks revenge against Dom and the rest of his family, Brian (Walker) is entering a new phase of his life as a father and husband, so surviving the war to come is more paramount than ever. Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is still struggling to cope with her near death and subsequent amnesia, with Dom basically doing a four-wheeled version of The Vow to jog her memory. The action once again takes them around the world, with help from a covert agent played by Kurt Russell, plus a stop in Tokyo to revisit Lucas Black's 'Tokyo Drift' character. That scene doesn't work out as well as it should since the flashbacks don't jibe with the present, but it's still a cool bit of nostalgia and world-building. They also pick up a new recruit in Ramsey (played by the incredibly hot Nathalie Emmanuel), a computer hacker with a super MacGuffin device capable of spying on anyone. And of course Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris) trade quips in the middle of pulling death-defying feats Superman wouldn't dare.

And let's talk about those feats because Furious 7 is basically one mind-blowing set piece after another, designed to evoke the loudest possible response from its fans. In terms of plot this may be the weakest yet but incoming director James Wan doesn't give a crap about all of that. He's dropping cars from airplanes and flying cars between buildings! In one incredibly well-choreographed set piece Wan hits us with literally everything he can think of: car chases, armed buses, cliff diving, gun fights, a brawl between Walker and martial arts superstar Tony Jaa, sniper rifles, Djimon Hounsou in slick shades...damned if it doesn't have everything a genre fan could want. The only thing missing is a cat fight and that comes later when Rodriguez throws down with UFC champ Ronda Rousey. What's most impressive is that this is really Wan's first time tackling this kind of genre, having built his career on horrors. Youd never know it, though, and clearly he's been taking some tips from The Raid in the use of wild, kinetic camera angles. The hand-to-hand combat is faster, the vehicular mayhem more insane than ever. Even if this turns out to be Wan's only film before moving on he has made quite the impression. Making less of an impact are Rousey and Jaa, whose talents aren't given nearly enough time to shine. On the other hand, Johnson is bolder and more oiled up than ever as Hobbs. In a film full of superheroes he's the most superhero-y of them all, not even broken bones can stop him!

For those who wonder why these movies are so successful? It's really quite simple. As over-the-top and stupidly unbelievable as many of the action scenes are, they are balanced nicely an emotional sincerity that is easy to understand. None of these characters are especially deep, we all get that, but we recognize that they would all die to protect one another. That's an incredibly powerful thing that the franchise has tapped into, and Furious 7 keeps that tradition alive even when turning the page.",1428192000,,4999,4.828471411901984

6183716,5,B00HLTD8RA,"In my opinion, it's officially over. This multi-billion dollar muscle-car franchise has ended. If Vin Diesel tries again, it will be a big mistake. There is nowhere to go after this one, particularly when we all know Paul Walker is dead and we see his character, through the wizardry of body doubles, CGI and scenes already in the can before his death, take another path. The last few indelible minutes of this film are deeply affecting, the audience was riveted.

Director James Wan (""Saw"") specializes in action movies and this one is waaay over the top. One of the things have I appreciated about this series has been the skillful stunt driving and the minimal computer generated imaging. This is NOT one of them; HOWEVER, the emphasis on family values, bravery, loyalty and trust which has been the heart of the franchise, is unchanged, so in my opinion they can leave with their heads' unbowed.

We see (I'm abbreviating the name for the returnees):
  * Vin Diesel (""Furious"") Dominic is trying to help his wife Letty remember events in their lives before her traumatic brain injury.
  * Michelle Rodriguez (""Furious"") Letty feels she died on the date she sees on her tombstone; she doesn't even remember they are married.
  * Paul Walker (""Furious"") Brian worries that he's not tough enough to face domesticity...and he already misses the bullets. But it's hard to see his modest little bungalow blown to smithereens.
  * Jordana Brewster (""Furious"") Mia wants her husband to accept his family and be happy to give up the excitement of his past life.
  * Tyrese Gibson (""Furious"") Roman is hilarious as the alpha-alpha of the group (you've gotta see it!). He makes the plans....
  * Ludacris (""Furious"") Our favorite hacker Tej, may have found a soul mate in the tech wizard they are trying to rescue.
  * Dwayne Johnson (""Furious"") Watch Hobbs rid himself of a nuisance, the arm cast from an early scuffle, by flexing those ridiculous biceps.
  * Lucas Black (""Furious"") No real need to include Sean, but that Southern accent is so charming.... And he DOES explain stuff.
  * Jason Statham (""Furious"") Deckard Shaw is the Energizer Bunny who JUST WON""T STOP! His brother was caught by our heroes in the last movie, so Deckard is out for revenge.
  * Nathalie Emmanuel (""Game of Thrones"") Ramsey is the ultimate hacker; she has devised a brilliant new program that will revolutionize law enforcement. I like the way she immediately categorizes everyone!
  * Kurt Russell (""The Art of the Steal"") Mr. Nobody must have the deus ex machina, the plot device that is the central issue: a brilliant digital tracking system that makes everything up until now, absolutely archaic.

Over the years, because of the lack of profanity, the skill of the stunt drivers and the emphasis on family values (including prayer before a meal), I have been intrigued by this series. I have taken great pride in its huge success, both domestic and international, and hope the franchise ends on this high note. I will own the DVD just for the last few minutes. I've preordered it from Amazon.",1428105600,,3074,4.842911877394636
6183737,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Ok, before I start talking about the film, let me just say that they really show WAY too much of this film in the trailers, TV spots, behind the scenes features, etc. One TV commercial showed WAY too much of the ending, so, not cool.
In this film, Deckard Shaw(Jason Statham) is hunting the team to avenge his brother Owen from the last film. Dom(Vin Diesel), Brian(Paul Walker) and the rest of the team set out to avenge Han and to find Shaw before he finds them.
In a nutshell, this is another great Fast and Furious movie, bringing the immense fun, amazing action, compelling morals, laugh out loud humor and unforgettable characters back and better than ever!
The plane drop scene was awesome!
The entire Abu Dahbi part of the movie was a lot of fun!
I loved Ramsey! She was great! She's a very welcome new addition to the team!
Kurt Russel was the real scene-stealer as Mr. Nobody, a mysterious yet very cheerful and charismatic government agent.
Michelle Rodriguez really stepped it up as Letty. Not that there was anything wrong with how she played her before. She gets emotional on a few occasions and she does it very well.
There are some shocking revelations about characters that we've known for a while, the last of which is really nice.
The cast of Tokyo Drift finally returns after 9 years... but then leaves 60 seconds later...... oh well.
And, the scene everyone is talking about, the ending really is a beautiful and extremely emotional farewell to both an unforgettable character and, from what I hear, an amazing human being.
In closing, Furious 7 is another outstanding installment in what really is the greatest film saga of our generation.",1428105600,,1661,4.711340206185567

6183740,4,B00HLTD8RA,"Theatrical review.  Possible spoilers.  In what I expect will be one of the biggest movies of the year, the series may also have produced the best chapter yet.  This edition picks up close to where the last one ended.  After dispatching bad guy, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) in the earlier film we see his bad-ass older brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) pledge revenge on Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew beginning with his government accomplice Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson).

We know that Shaw isn't to be trifled with early on as he and Hobbs go mano y mano with only Hobbs being sent to the hospital.  Shaw, having hacked Hobbs's computer has the names and locations of everyone and begins his vengeful killing spree in Tokyo and almost gets Dom, his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), his new brother-in-law, Brian (Paul Walker) and their toddler, with a bomb.  After this happens, Dom gets that look in his eye and vows to go after Shaw.

In a secondary plotline, a secretive quasi-government unit headed by ""Mr. Nobody"" (a scene stealing Kurt Russell), wants Dom and his crew to rescue a tech-genius named Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel from ""Game of Thrones"").  She's developed a system that can track anyone in the world by hacking into traffic cameras, computers, cell phones and any and all electronic devices and using sophisticated facial recognition software.  If the crew can pull it off, Dom is promised access in order to track down Shaw.

This is all just an excuse to kick-start a couple of hours of non-stop action sequences, the best of which is Dom, Brian, Letty (Michelle Rodrigues) who still has memory loss, Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris) sky-dive...along with their cars...onto an otherwise obscure mountain highway in Azerbaijan.  This undetected approach allows them to find and rescue Ramsey, but only after a series of remarkably staged and executed stunts involving cars, stunt drivers and the actors.

Unlike previous F & F films, I found these to be tension-filled in addition to the action.  Djimon Hounsou shows up here as the leader of the group who kidnapped Ramsey, along with Asian action star Tony Jaa who has a fearsome fight with Brian in this sequence and later in the film.  All of this nonsense clears the way for some even more ridiculous, but downright brilliant scenes shot in Abu Dhabi where Dom launches a $3.5 million super car through a series of glassy skyscrapers.

Eventually the gang returns to L. A. with Shaw and Jakande (Hounsou) hot on their trail with the ""God's Eye"" device in their pocket.  In addition to some terrific action sequences and well-choreographed fights, the movie concludes with an emotional send off to Walker who died in the middle of shooting the film in 2013.  While it plays within the confines of the script, it is also an obvious fond farewell from the hearts of the actors.  Yeah, it's authentic and it's touching.",1428105600,3,2896,4.861507128309572
6183741,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Ever since the first fast and the furious came out in 2001 I was hooked. It's crazy how long this franchise has been, and the characters and how they are a family in real life. When you have someone in your life for that long it's incredible to see their relationships grow. Furious 7 was very amazing! It was a bit long but it was expected, there were tons and tons of fighting scenes, I think they could've reduced that by 10 minutes. Before going in to see the movie I heard Paul completed 85% of his scenes, and the rest were going to be played by his brothers. I couldn't tell until the last 15-20 min of the film thy had his brothers do the scenes but they digitally altered the face to make it look identical to Paul's. No matter what, they did a great job on the entire film, the ending was just such so emotional though. I cried at a few parts in the film because you see the characters true emotion not just acting. At the end is where you see it the most, the second to last scene where they are all at the beach you can see it in their faces and thinking ""Paul this is for you brother"" I balled my eyes out. In all honesty I do not think they should go on and do an 8th or 9th movie. I heard it was based in new York and that's why Kirt russel was in this movie, because he will be in the next. They should leave it how it ended. Without Paul there should be no more it's just not the same.

6183742,5,B00HLTD8RA,"Furious 7

 By the time a movie franchise has reached number seven we can expect one of two outcomes.  We could well expect that the film turns out to be loud, expensive and flat, with all imagination long used up.  Or we can find a film that has a kind of perfection of its type.  In Furious 7 we have the later.  We have a film that precisely meets our expectations.  It may be loud, expensive and predicable-even silly if we were silly enough to examine too closely some of the plot set ups-but we just don't care.  Even big summer action movies have a range from dross to gold and this one shine bight yellow.
 We give a hoot because after so many of the Furious films we recognize the characters.  And the direction keeps things moving in interesting way.  First the characters.
 Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has an interesting and very close family.  They race cars and fight bad guys for the government.  Well, sometimes they have to fight the government but usually everyone makes up afterward.  Don and his people also wreck cars and kill people, often in spectacular ways.  But we end up caring about Dom's family nearly as much as he does.  Brian (the late Paul Walker), once an enemy of Dom's now has married Don's sister Mia (Mordana Brewster).  Brian, Mia and their child are safely in the family.  But love runs deep in the family and not always along blood lines.  Comrades in arms are also granted family status by the ruler, Dom.  These include Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) Dom's amnesiac wife-she doesn't remember that she and Dom are married.  Characters Roman and Tej are played by music crossover stars Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris.  New comer to the family is Nathalie Emmanuel (Game of Thrones) who plays Ramsey, a computer hacker and plot hub.
Dwayne The Rock Johnson plays federal cop Hobbs who might also have family standing.
 The villain is played by tough guy Jason Statham.  In one of the best bits in the film Statham goes nose to nose with The Rock in a very well staged battle.  We want to see if a big, fast fighter,
Statham, can beat an even bigger, stronger but maybe not quite so fast fighter, Johnson.  For a back up villain the producers give us Djimon Hounsou as the brains behind the forces of evil.  Also featured are Kurt Russell, Noel Gugliemi and Lucas Black.  We were pleased to see our favorite tough girl Ronda Rousey make an appearance as a bodyguard.  Rousey won an Olympic medal in Judo for the USA before going on the full fight mode as a UFO champion.  She and Michelle Rodriguez have a splendid knock down drag out fight in the middle of a fancy party.
 Which brings us to the direction of James Wan.  We know Wan best from his directorial efforts in Saw and The Conjuring.  He believably drops high performance automobiles out of a C-17 cargo plane and we buy right into it.  It turns out that the technology of GPS directed parachutes actually exists, which makes it even cooler.  He also jumps a sports car from one skyscraper to another.  Twice.  Wow.
 Writer Gary Scott has penned four other of the Furious films.  He understands that his job is to get his characters into dangerous situations so that they can get to safety in loud, dangerous and exciting ways.  Which is exactly what he does.  And director James Wan makes the gang look really cool while they do it.  Which explains why we go see these things in our millions.
 These guys spent a reported $250 million to make this slam bang speed and explosion extravaganza, which makes it almost imperative to go watch it.  I mean, they went to all that trouble to make the film, we should go and see it, right?  Definitely right.
 The PG-13 rated film lasts a good long two hours and 17 minutes.
 Actor Paul Walker lost his life in an unrelated car wreck during shooting.  Director Wan carefully shot around the loss of the actor using Walker's two brothers as body doubles, among other techniques.  This results in a film that the uninformed viewer would not suspect had this problem.
 The film ends with a lovely and touching homage to Paul Walker.

6183744,2,B00HLTD8RA,"I am a big fan of James Wan. I think he has made some of the most thrilling horrors in recent years. His films often leave me wanting more and I am never shy of revisiting them after the passage of some time. When I heard he is directing Fast and Furious (a franchise I'd never been interested in) I wondered what he will bring to the table in an action based plot.

The last film of the franchise I saw was Fast and Furious 2. This was back in the day. Don't know why I thought they may have improved. Oh yes, its the people who've been watching these films. They said I must watch the 5th one and all but I never bothered until right now.

Where do I begin? The story line is terrible, the plot and execution is extremely cliche. There are 1 second action scenes where you are made to just simply stop blinking. The action is over the top, completely made up and absolutely trashy.

Did anyone watch ""White House Down"" ? This is that bad.
Did you watch Pacific Rim? It is that bad.

I don't think I am watching a Blockbuster anytime soon because it saddens me to see the level Hollywood stoops to. I don't mean all Blockbusters but some films are so poorly executed with no storyline.

There is a scene involving a car crash through three buildings in Dubai. The crew would never pull it off in real life without being arrested on 67 counts and being lashed to death. I think it was a pretty good scene.

By the way, I don't believe in 3D so went for the 2D version. My wife noticed I was getting very fidgety halfway during the film. I felt such a huge sigh of relief after we walked out shortly before the end. We were the only ones I guess. The crowd seemed enthralled.

I think if you enjoyed any of the older films, there's a good chance you will enjoy this one.

It was cringe worthy to watch Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and even The Rock. They were all very bad in this film but blame the storyline or whatever or maybe even all three.",1428019200,3,1940,4.168449197860962
6183745,5,B00HLTD8RA,"SPOILER FREE!

I just want to preface this review by stating I have been a fan of this series since it first came out and have kind of grown up as I watched it.  I was 19 and in college with no responsibilities, single, and a care free life the first time I saw Fast and Furious.  I am now 33 married and just had our second child.  Given the themes of this movie, the evolution of the characters, only make this movie even more poignant.

The core of this series has always been about family, and the 7th film is no different.  It truly takes the dramatic core of family and takes it to another level.  As a person who has grown along with the series and watched the characters grow and have families in the movies, this movie truly emphasizes something in life that few action movies are able to stress, and that is Family.  Dom states ""I don't have friends.  I have family."" And that is exactly what this movie is about.  The performances feel so real, especially given the knowledge that Paul Walker passed during filming adds even more emotional weight to many of the scenes.  I almost feel as though it is almost Vin Diesel himself talking to his compadres at times rather then the character talking to other characters.  That is how real it seemed at times.

Plot Synopsis:  As seen from the previews, this movie is about revenge.  However, there is an added twist to this.  I will not state exactly, but I will say that I felt that Jason Statham was quite underused in this movie.  I felt that his character had minimal development and was a stereotypical ""bad guy on a revenge trip.""  As in any Fast movie the action set pieces are too notch and require a hefty dose of suspension of disbelief,  but isn't that way you came to see these films anyway.  I did feel the last 35 minute action sequence could have been shortened by 5-10 min. Or so.  But the other scenes were the perfect length and never felt bloated.

In regards to how they finished the movie despite not having Paul walker. Only in a couple of instances was the CGI noticeable, but if you were not looking specifically for it, I feel that most people would not notice.  It was very well done, and I truly felt he was pretty much in the whole move.

However,  after 2 hours of nonstop action and thrills you are treated to one of the greatest endings in cinematic history.  The last ten minutes are worth the price of admission alone.  Congrats to Universal, the writing staff, director and the actors for putting together the best possible ending I could imagine.  I, as well as everyone else, was wondering how they could walk the fine line of paying tribute without being tacky or being overly emotional such that you felt like it was a funeral. Well they did it.  It was PERFECT,  and if you can't relate to the ending in some fashion then you are likely a robot.  The performances at the end felt more genuine than almost anything I have ever seen on film.  They will be talking about this ending for eternity.

No posthumous Oscar will be awarded to Paul Walker, but, it does provide a nice send off just the same.

Exciting action sequences, vehicular carnage and relentless hand-to-hand combats - F7 delivers a powerhouse!

The film isn't only about slick cars and explosions, it's also about friends, family, trust and love.  Hats off to Director James Wan and Universal -  despite his tragic death midway through production completing 80% of his scenes, Walker remains a key figure in the film, with his 2 younger brothers' clever use of their body doubles and CGI effects.

Paul Walker was an amazing actor and had a certain screen presence we will miss. This is an out-and-out amazing film in some respects. The entire cast was perfect. FURIOUS 7 blew me away at times and disappointed at others. Somehow the entire cast and crew went far beyond anyone could imagine in what seems like a tribute to Paul Walker. I loved parts of it and felt let down in some of the scenes that looked a bit contrived. The film making in FURIOUS 7 is some of the best I have ever seen for this series, but once again it some very weak moments.

They pushed the envelope and went far beyond and perhaps too far at times. The action, the story, the characters and a lot of emotion make this one of the best films of this series, yet something seemed lacking.  Paul will be missed. In the final analysis he seemed like an appendage to this film, simply just a footnote and that was sad. Brian Tyler composed a score that is full of drive, energy and emotion. It is one of his best.
