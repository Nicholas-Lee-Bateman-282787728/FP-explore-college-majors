8685783,4,B00OZOIJB4,"Very strong. Any family drama has to be close to pitch-perfect, and this one was. Excellent script, excellent acting, excellent direction. Cherien Dabis is quite the talent. Detail I loved (SPOILER): of course the mother w the rope would have been trying to untangle a relationship of her own, it would make no sense that it would work for someone else. Maybe next time for Ms. Dabis: a mystery!",1480550400,,395,4.739130434782608

8685787,2,B00OZOIJB4,"I thought this story of a Jordanian woman living in New York would be fascinating.  At the beginning of the film she is returning to her home where her mother still lives, to arrange for her marriage to a Jordanian man who also lives in the US.  Her two sisters meet her and there is a lot of familial reunion going on, including a visit to the father who divorced the mother several years earlier and has remarried.  IT's a rich mix of characters and promises to be a good story.

In my opinion, however, it fails to live up to its potential.  The characters are largely stereotypes -- the frumpy mother who has become a Christian, the Lesbian sister who has just dropped out of massage school, another sister who has just been fired from her job and seems desperate to find a man.  May, the heroine, who is played by the writer/director, is definitely the Star.  She is model-thin and beautiful, we see her running in shorts a lot, which attracts attention from passing men.  She see her applying her make-up, trying on her wedding dress (she is stunnint), sneaking cigarettes while staring moodily into space.  She is not only the beauty of the family, the film tells us but the Smart, Successful one.  She is the author of a widely acclaimed first book and is working on a second.  Her fiance is no slouch either, comes from a wealthy family and teaches at Columbia.  Her unattractive, unsuccessful relatives serve as foils to her grandeur.  She is dismissive of all of them, especially of her mother's religion.

As the plans for the wedding progress, in the hands of the groom's mother, who is sparing no expensive for the wonderful couple, May begins to have some tinges of doubt.  She meets a handsome young frllow who, of course, falls for her.  She plays tennis with him.  She is very good, of course, and beets him.  He takes her out to the desert and shows her the stars.  Poor May just can't make up her mind what to do!

The subplot involves May's father, a rich American playboy type with red hair, who has re-married to a super-model type who is May's age.
All the girls are mad at him for abandoning them.  It's quite odd that none of them, all brunettes, bear the least trace of a light haired dad.  The relationship between him and the Mom is so unrealistic as to appear ludicrous.

The big suspense of the story is whether May will or will not go through with her wedding.  We are supposed to care, but frankly I couldn't find  enough redeeming qualities in May to cause me to care about her.  I fast forwarded to the end.

8685790,4,B00OZOIJB4,"""May In the Summer"" (2013 release; 99 min.) brings the story of a woman named May. As the movie opens, we see May arriving (from New York) in the Middle East (specifically, Jordan), where she meets up with her mom and her 2 sisters. May is getting ready for her wedding in a few weeks to Ziad, a secular Muslim who is a professor at NYU. May's mom, an Arab Christian, disapproves of the marriage. Meanwhile we also get to know May's dad, who divorced her mom 8 years ago and is now remarried to a much younger woman. One evening, May and her sisters go out and May gets to know Karim, a nice guy who seems to take a liking for May (and maybe likewise). Will May marry Ziad? Will her mom change her mind and approve of the marriage? And what about May's friendship with Karim? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is a tour-de-force for writer-director Cherien Dabis, who also stars as May. She is an up-and-coming talent and this is her second movie as a director. Second, the movie stretches both into comedy and drama, but in the end this resonates best as a tender family drama. There are several outstanding scenes, including between the three sister, all of whom have insecurities they have trouble dealing with. The relationship between May and her mom, and May and her dad, respectively, are also presented with rich details. Third, the movie is set in the Middle East, and as such it makes for some great photographic scenes. Check out the sisters' visit to the Dead Sea, which is captured in all of its glory (I had a chance to visit the Dead Sea several years ago, loved it).

""May In the Summer"" opened without any pre-release hype or advertising at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati in September, and I figured this will not play very long so I went to see it right away. I had a private screening at the matinee showing I saw this at (as in: I was literally the only person in the theatre). No matter. This is an excellent movie, and it made me think of Woody Allen's ""Hannah And Her Sisters"" for some reason. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention that writer-director Dabis did her undergraduate studies here at the University of Cincinnati (before moving on the graduate film school at Columbia). All that aside, if you are interested in a tender family drama that is MILES away from your standard Holywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""May In the Summer"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1415318400,9,2528,4.493478260869566
