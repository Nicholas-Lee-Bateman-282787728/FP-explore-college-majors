8261072,5,B00166FBV0,"I believe this DVD is well worth the purchase!  Besides showing why this Kansas Jayhawk team is the greatest Kansas team ever (2:12 left in game and no less than NINE points down -- many a team would have simply fallen to pieces at that point), this is a very fine group of young men.  They always displayed unselfish behavior and excellent character in their basketball games. And I am not prejudice to Kansas basketball since I live in Oklahoma (I would love to see an Oklahoma team of such quality.)  The Jayhawks certainly deserved their national championship!",1214784000,,564,4.73469387755102

If you are looking for the entire Final Four...you will not find it here.

As a Kansas alum, fan, and native Kansan...this DVD bothers me greatly. I would guess that many fans will want the full national semi-final game just as much as the championship game, but you will not get it here. The KU vs. UNC game has random cuts in the action. I was lucky enough to see a replay before the national title game, but I would prefer to own that UNC stomping in its entirety.

I just do not understand why the NCAA cannot get it right. The best DVD set I have purchased was the 2004 Red Sox set. I would happily pay extra to get all the Kansas tourney games, but I guess this is the best you can hope for this year. The sad thing is that the bare bones 1988 KU DVD that is two separate DVDs is even better than this one.",1211846400,5,848,4.035714285714286
8261075,1,B00166FBV0,"Although this says it is still in pre-order, I received my copy on May 24. I am a huge Memphis fan and was excited to get a copy of all of the games in the Final Four so I could do a better job of analyzing what was going on.  Can't happen. THIS IS ONLY A HIGHLIGHTS DVD, under no circumstances is this anything near any entire game.  You see a dunk when its a 2 point game then the next shot is during a 10 point game.  This is completely incoherent.",1211760000,3,451,3.880434782608696
