7166968,5,B00XBL0J6U,"By way of introduction, this five-star review comes from a holder of a Master of Divinity degree from Yale--which means the content is familiar, to say the least.  What earned it the high rating is the excellence of the production, from writing to filming to narration to post-production polishing.  I learned so much from Jonathan Phillips' travels over some 12,000 miles in seven countries, the places where the early church took root and struggled to survive after the crucifixion of Jesus.  The lives of Peter and Paul are a dual focus, for they were the most determined (and therefore most persecuted) spreaders of the gospel.  The conversion of the Emperor Constantine the Great to Christianity in was a crucial turning point, for it marked the beginning of relief of persecution in the Roman Empire.  While this six-part series is often hard to watch precisely because of the vicious persecution of the early Christians, we must bear in mind the recurrence of their persecution in the Middle East today, making the video even more pertinent.  It would be an excellent centerpiece for a church study and discussion group.",1442534400,74,1127,5.0
7166969,5,B00XBL0J6U,"Excellent photography and well researched commentary and narrative. This is a very comprehensive treatment of a most important historical period. The six part video flows smoothly and almost seamlessly as it journeys through the early Christian history and evolution. Well worth adding to your video library and hosting viewings in your home for family, friends and church members.",1441584000,24,381,5.586206896551724

7166971,5,B00XBL0J6U,"I highly recommend this holyland story production.  Having been there in 2008 it very much rejuvenates what I once traveled to see.  Boastiing, in my possession are most all the video productions available about the holyland story,  mho this one of the best I've seen.",1438992000,13,268,4.911111111111111
7166972,5,B00XBL0J6U,"This is a marvelous film that everyone interested in the history of Christianity should see. It is filled with details that are not otherwise generally available, and more importantly, you get to visit each of these places and look at the artefacts and remnants from past civilizations. The graphics are good and the photography is excellent. It's not however, a perfect film as my rating ""5"" implies. The experts are definitely from the B list, and seem to be chosen because of their proximity to Phillips. There is also an orthodox approach to the history of Christianity, taking the accepted POV which is church dogma, but not necessarily the latest interpretation of events/people. Putting aside these issues, the film is unduplicated in giving you access to material you can't find elsewhere. Phillips and his crew are to be commended for giving us this great gift.",1433116800,41,870,5.006896551724138

7166977,5,B00XBL0J6U,"Professor Jonathan Phillips of Royal Holloway, University of London, takes us in the footsteps of Christ, the Apostles, martyrs and Romans in a journey of three hundred years, from the birth of Christ to the acceptance of the persecuted Way of Christianity as the Roman faith.

Along the way we see the spots familiar from the Bible from Jerusalem to Patmos in the Aegean, especially places visited by Saul/Paul.  Some are ruined, others are still thriving centers.  Since ""church architecture"" as such did not exist, we see  places like a cave near Antioch where Paul and Barnabas may have worshiped.  And we see the oldest dated extant bit of Scripture . . . in Manchester.  All fascinating.

Professor Phillips approach is refreshing, in that he takes the history of the New Testament uncritically as he goes from Jerusalem to Rome and further.  While the series endorses no religion, it's a useful tool, I've found, in teaching Sunday School and augmenting my own Scriptural knowledge by actually seeing the places he visits.  On the other hand, the series' sole problem is that Professor Phillips uses the same open-mindedness he brings to history to showing us places like ""the grotto where Jesus was born"" (places which at best can be nothing more than a guess but are probably pious frauds).  It also has the major flaw of most such documentaries (especially those by Michael Wood, James Burke, etc.) which goes on the assumption that no place is so magnificent it can't be bettered by having the narrator standing in front of it, blocking half of it.

Professor Phillips is a pleasant tour guide, very likeable.  All he needs is a touch of humor and the occasional twinkle in his eye.  But probably due to the touchiness of his subject matter, he eschews humor and gives it to us straight.",1513900800,,1798,4.817589576547231
7166978,5,B00XBL0J6U,"I saw this series on streaming media and had to have it. This is the best documentary I've ever seen on early Christianity. You're also taken to holy sites you may never have seen elsewhere on other documentaries, like the cave where the first known image of St. Paul is on the wall and St. John's cave. So much more!",1513296000,,317,4.3
7166979,5,B00XBL0J6U,"One of the best DVDs I have ever seen.  I really enjoyed it, especially the episodes in the second part.  I learned a great deal from them and it was fascinating.  The entire program was very well done.",1506988800,,202,4.2631578947368425

7166983,5,B00XBL0J6U,"A wonderful journey. It covers the main players in the drama but doesn't ignore sects and individuals who played supporting roles. I am interested in the gnostics, a little understood sect but one with great influence I think, and the program gives an honest appraisal of this group without making it out to be irrelevant and unworthy of much notice.  Other individuals like Tertullian are explored in some depth.  It would be impossible to please everybody in any film about the history of a world religion, but this documentary probably comes close to doing that.  The script stays close to the Biblical sources without leaning too heavily on the academic, but also brings in some of the interesting and important tales and traditions spawned by the movement. The viewer comes away with a broader understanding of the early history of Christianity. The cinematography is great too though at times the music may overpower the words a little bit making it hard to understand.",1497916800,3,975,4.969325153374233
7166984,5,B00XBL0J6U,"In six one hour episodes over two disks this tells the story of Christianity beginning with the birth of Christ (includes a visit to what is thought to be the actual location in Bethlehem), to Jerusalem as a youth, his ministry and death.

The second disk features the next generation of believers, their torments, and faith. Eventually Christianity becomes state sanctioned. Features interviews, artwork, and visits to locations.

7166987,3,B00XBL0J6U,"This is really a good video.  I would have preferred a greater emphasis on the video presentation than in the seeming constant insertion of commentary at every moment.  Nevertheless, this was excellent for my purposes.  What destroyed the beauty of this presentation for me is the constant loud, intrusive, and annoying music.  Somebody somewhere decided, (perhaps at the History Channel ?)  that all historical perspectives should be embossed with music they considered to be emotionally appropriate.  The louder the better.  I truly despise this notion and the music in this video is way over the top in volume and constancy.  I truly prefer that I be able to hear what speakers or local sounds are trying to tell me.  Let me hear city sounds.  Let me hear wind rustling leaves.  Let me hear some moments of silence.  Mood setting music is lovely for a Disney animation film.  It is distracting if given no rest in an intellectual presentation.",1494633600,9,946,4.9113924050632916

7166992,5,B00XBL0J6U,We are using this for our Lenten series in my church.  The photography is beautiful and the narrative of the life of the early church between the time of the apostles and the legalization of all religions in the Roman empire under Emperor Constantine with the Edict of Milan in 313 AD. is fascinating and an often overlooked period in church history. The series raises a number of critical questions for us to consider in the modern era.  What is our principle message to the world around us?  How do we react to the hostility and indifference of the secular world around us?  What do we need in leadership? Are all interpretations of Christianity equally valid or do we have a rule of faith and a creed that still guides us? What are we willing to sacrifice to be Christians?,1490227200,2,776,4.521428571428571

7166996,5,B00XBL0J6U,"This is one of the best videos on the history of Christianity.

7167002,4,B00XBL0J6U,"I found the documentary enjoyable and beautifully photographed.  One major disappointment was the first part which covered the life and career of Jesus.  Unlike the coverage of the evolution of Christianity from after his death to the age of Constantine, the portion of the documentary covering Jesus' life was too superficial.  It presented the Nativity story as true without discussing the historic analyses that dispute the story about Joseph and Mary being required, for taxation purposes, to go to Joseph's purported birthplace (Bethlehem).  The Romans were more interested in taxing people where they presently lived.  There is no evidence that the Roman government required subjects to travel long distances to their original birthplaces.  That would have been economically disruptive.  Also, since Jesus was born in the Kingdom of Judaea, his parents would have owed taxes to Herod the Great's government, not to the Romans.  The Nativity story links the taxation narrative to the Roman census administered by Quirinius, the Roman governor of Syria.  This census occurred in 6 AD, several years after Jesus' birth obviating the need for a Nativity story.  Also, Jesus and his parents lived in Galilee which was directly under the rule of the Tetrarch Herod Antipas.  Qurinius' census would not have applied to Galilee since Galilee in 6 AD was technically a client kingdom and not directly ruled by the Roman government.  When compared to the more thorough analysis of the post Jesus history of Christianity presented in the documentary, this superficial coverage of Jesus's life was disappointing.

The rest of the documentary was more interesting and nuanced.  Overall, I enjoyed the documentary and would recommend it.",1479081600,3,1729,5.332103321033211
7167003,5,B00XBL0J6U,"In this six-episode video series, historian Jonathan Phillips takes the viewer on a 9000-mile trip from the ministry of Jesus Christ to the flourishing of the faith during the reign of Constantine the Great.

This is a six-hour series that does a very good job of showing the progression of the Christian faith from the time when the Son of God came to Earth and the development of the early church and it's leading figures. Jonathan Phillips does a good job, not only of telling us ""what"" happened, but taking us on a trip to ""where"" it all happened and what the world was like when the familiar events took place.

The episodes are: Birth of a Faith, The Great Missionary, Age of the Apostles, From Apocalypse to Heresies, Pagans and the Cult of Martyrs and Constantine. The first, obviously, is about the life of Jesus and his ultimate sacrifice on Calvary and resurrection leaving the empty tomb. The second focuses on Paul while the third segment is about the lives of the apostles. The second disk begins with the book of Revelations and the many heresies that arose early on. The DVD looks at the persecutions throughout the early period by both Jews and Roman emperors and then ends with the official tolerance of Christianity within the Roman Empire by the Empderor Constantine who adopted the faith as his own.

This is a very good DVD set with six hourly episodes. The production quality is excellent with wonderful cinematography, good musical scores, a good host/narrator and often astounding locations. I have a few quibbles, but in light of the many positives, they're not even worth mentioning! This is a five-star series for the Christian and well worth the reasonable price.

Having taken a tour ""In The Footsteps of St. Paul"" it was wonderful to know that I had been to and seen the sights of so many of the same places including Phillipi where Paul was arrested and put on trial.  Also, Lydia who was a merchant (imagine WOMEN merchants in those times!) who sold the tiny purple mollusks which produced the dye for the garments of royalty.  She was in the region and heard Paul preach, whereupon she asked him to baptize her in the small brook we were shown.  Lydia was the FIRST EUROPEAN to be baptized into Christianity.

The scripture that is emphasized is appropriate to the narration and while it's not evangelical; it gives a great platform for after viewing conversation should that be the desired focus.,1451433600,7,608,5.214285714285714

8715617,5,B00XBL0J6U,"This is a very interesting history of Christianity by someone who actually knows something about it from a religious perspective.  I first saw it on a Christmas eve marathon on PBS last year.  The production has been out since 2015. It covers Jesus time as well as the subsequent time through Constantine, the roman emperor that legalized the new religion.  The narator is the author and takes you through the holy land and the roman empire to bring the story and the history to life.",1528934400,,484,4.670588235294118
