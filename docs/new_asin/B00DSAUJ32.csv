5853540,5,B00DSAUJ32,Excellent cut classics. Trying to get more.,1412467200,2,43,5.285714285714286
5853541,4,B00DSAUJ32,Very typical Roger Corman. OK films but not academy award winners.  Good for an evening's viewing when nothing is on your 200 channel cable network. (Normal),1409788800,12,157,5.038461538461538

5853543,2,B00DSAUJ32,This DVD was terrible. The monsters were laughable. It's not even worth the low price I paid for it.,1404172800,,100,4.315789473684211
5853544,2,B00DSAUJ32,Movies were dull in picture and content. I did like the case though. Got it at an ok price. Not worth hunting down.,1401321600,,115,4.043478260869565
5853545,4,B00DSAUJ32,seeing these movies reminds me what it was like before cable when you had wait till satureday afternoon to watch these kind of horror movies .There alright they take you back when those kind of movies easy to make but can still be scary. But that's just me.,1388102400,9,257,4.375
5853546,2,B00DSAUJ32,I love sci fi but this wasn't good at all. This will be one that I won't keep in my collection.,1381104000,4,95,3.5714285714285716
5853547,2,B00DSAUJ32,"Apparently, the films in this collection are ""The Little Shop Of Horrors"", ""Attack Of The Giant Leeches"", ""The Wasp Woman"", ""Creature From The Haunted Sea"", ""She Gods Of Shark Reef"", and ""Beast From Haunted Cave."" All are public domain films, and based on the price, none are anything other than the usual good to horrible quality copies that are already available for a few dollars from several different companies. No extras and nothing special, unless the ""collectors tin"" excites you. By the way, ""She Gods Of Shark Reef"" is not a monster movie. Hardly even any sharks either.",1380240000,76,580,4.928571428571429
5853548,5,B00DSAUJ32,I love Roger Corman. I want to get It conquered the world on dvd. I have it on tape and I have played it so many times I am almost afraid to play it again. I sure hope it is on this.,1377302400,5,182,3.357142857142857
5853559,3,B00DSAUJ32,"Ok, just what are you getting w/ this package? Well, there are the six movies- ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES (grown men in plastic trash-bag ""leech"" costumes eating hillbillies! Features a sizzling Yvette Vickers in the role of her career!), CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA (monster resembling an eeevil christmas tree kills off a crew of sea-faring crooks), BEAST FROM HAUNTED CAVE (Thieves on the run, encounter a mysterious creature, bent on their destruction), LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS (Jonathon Haze keeps his carnivorous plant supplied w/ human blood! Features Dick Miller as a flower-eating customer, and Jack Nicholson's famous trip to the dentist!), SHE GODS OF SHARK REEF (The one complete dud of this collection, includes no real plot, no real shark action, and not much of the she gods), WASP WOMAN (Beautiful Susan Cabot finds a cure for aging through queen wasp royal jelly injections, only to discover hideous side effects!). Actually, I love five out of six of these ""classics"". The problem is that these exact, scratchy, public domain versions of the films can be found on several big, 50-100-200 movie DVD packs! So, it's not worth it from a strictly financial standpoint. However, there are probably people who would love the tin box, w/ its full-color cover. Sooo, this would probably be a great gift for the person who loves cheeeze, has never seen these particular movies, and loves groovy packaging...",1438387200,4,1418,5.064102564102564

5853561,3,B00DSAUJ32,The films were decent representatives of their era and of Corman's work. The disc arrived loose in the tin and were scratched so badly that I could only watch one movie and a portion of a second. Amazon made good on the purchase. I would caution others to buy this package due to the design which rendered the damage to the discs.,1436400000,,330,4.338709677419355

5853565,3,B00DSAUJ32,"I bought this for the tin. There. I said it. There are 2 good reasons to buy this: the tin is pretty cool looking and I am happy with that (altho it is oddly put together with some sort of cotter pin thingy), and the print quality for Little Shop of Horrors is very VERY good. So if you collect B-SciFi stuff and/or like LSOH it is worth $5 prime. Now the bad stuff: The other 2 movies with high camp/cheese value: Wasp Woman and Giant Leeches are presented in AWFUL transfers from bad prints; there are YT uploads that look better. This is really too bad as Yvette Vickers and Susan Cabot are stunningly beautiful women and deserve better. The second disc is made up of 3 DOG movies, even by Corman standards. Shark Goddesses is horrible, not sci-fi, and has no redeeming qualities. Haunted Sea/Cave are pretty bad but are saved from being complete wastes of time by some hilariously bad monsters at the end. Overall 3 stars. If Wasp Woman and Giant Leeches had the visual quality of LSOH it would have been a pretty good package for the money, as it is buy it ONLY if you really like LSOH and want a good transfer and/or as a collectible.",1424995200,25,1140,4.356807511737089
