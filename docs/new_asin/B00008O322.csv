7985865,3,B00008O322,"This fourth film in the nineties series of Zero Woman is not typical of the usual action oriented films. This portrayal of Rei seems rather weak in her commitment to Zero Division and its missions. The story is more about her friendship/relationship with a girly-boy that she takes in as a roommate. She kills for the government and later finds out he kills clients both out of revenge and for self-loathing. A quick film at 77 minutes, one can easily cut the story down to less than an hour. The weakest of the film series and should be watched only for those viewers that already have seen the other Zero Woman films.",1400457600,2,619,4.535714285714286
7985866,3,B00008O322,"Advertised as almost softcore, it isn't that right off the bat.  As a film, the acting is good with Zero Woman, a pretty Bond like assasin, looking for a sereal killer.  There is a bit of nudity and violence as she befriends a man who has been raped.  The relationship becomes a complicated one.  Three stars is generous, for die hard Asian film fans.",1106179200,7,351,4.4375
