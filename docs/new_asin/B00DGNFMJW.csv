5798150,3,B00DGNFMJW,"After receiving 4 replacements and sending the other three replacements in as defective because of multi scratched discs, I finally got a good workable set.  It wasn't easy, but worth it.  I will give The A-Team a 4 star rating as a show, but universal studios gets 3 stars for poor quality, but A better rating since I finally got a good set.

This season has not aired on TV much through the years, it was like watching this season for the first time.  They always show Some season 1, and mostly Season 2 and 4.  A a few episodes from Season 5.  I really enjoyed this season, and cannot understand why it hardly ever aired on TV.

Murdock drives B.A.'S van into the water with him in it, when B.A. returns from a mission off screen at the end of the episode.  It was a funny and rare moment where B.A. would let Murdock use his van.  Dwight Schultz & Mr. T. Are the comic relief of the show, and keep things funny for me as a viewer.  Like Timber, at the end Murdock thinks he has caught big foot in his trap, he caught B.A. and he threatened Murdock.  Stuff like this always makes the A-Team worth watching.

I can't remember which season this was, but B.A. was tied up when the plane crashed, and Hannibal untied him, and B.A. came out laughing after spewing out loud threats.  Hannibal later explained to the group that after the mission was through, b. A. had his permission to get even with all of them.  He taunted each one of them, and it was very comical.  This series is a riot! It is worth my time trying to get a good set.  I highly recommend it.",1393977600,2,1559,4.233898305084746

5798154,5,B00DGNFMJW,"This 1984-85 Season takes me back to memory lane to when I was 12 years old in the 6th grade and watched it every Tuesday night at 8PM on NBC before RIPTIDE at 9PM.

Additionally, this was also the season when Amy Allen's successor Tawnia Baker  (Marla Heasley )leaves the show with an emotional goodbye in the ""Bend In The River "" and the A-Team went back to being a foursome again permanently.

This 1984-1985 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was ""Let's All Be There "".

This season of A-TEAM also had some interesting guest stars like
*Stepfanie Kramer in the ""Fire"" episode during her co-starring days as the brassy homicide detective Sgt. Dede McCall on HUNTER
*Joe Santos in the ""Trouble On Wheels "" episode after his co-starring days as the often overwhelmed Det. Dennis Becker on THE ROCKFORD FILES
*Markie Post in the "" Hot Styles "" episode during her co-starring days as Terri Michaels on THE FALL GUY
*James Luisi in the ""Trouble On Wheels "" episode after his co-starring days as the disgruntled Lt. Chapman on THE ROCKFORD FILES
*James Callahan in ""The Island ""episode before his co-starring days as Walter Powell on CHARLES IN CHARGE
*Mills Watson in the ""Trouble On Wheels ""episode after his co-starring days as the doofus Deputy Perkins on SHERIFF LOBO",1453593600,2,1295,4.691629955947136
