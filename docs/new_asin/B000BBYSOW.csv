2411410,5,B000BBYSOW,"Turtle press offers 2 DVDs of contemporary Korean sword arts (Kumdo and Haedong Kumdo). Kumdo is a sport which uses split bamboo poles for swords and requires heavy kendo-style protective gear.  That style is in another video, Kumdo&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kumdo-Sword-Art/dp/B0006ZYPGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kumdo: Sword Art</a>.  This DVD is about the other martial art, Haedong Kumdo, which is completely different.  Haedong Kumdo uses both real metal swords and practice wooden swords.  This is a practical art with military applications, which generates powerful strikes.  In this video, Korean masters demonstrate breaking wooden poles using a wooden practice sword.  No heavy protective gear is used, except for self restraint.

Some sword videos are boring.  Not this one!  This video is very professional, and almost looks like a documentary or infomercial with pleasing photography, narration, and background music. It includes stances and sword basics in an fast and pleasing way.  This DVD also shows enough short clips from a Hedong Kumdo class to allow a potential student to see if they would like to take lessons. This video includes 4 forms, Shimsang Gumbup, Yedo Gumbup, Bonkuk Gumbup and Jangbek Gumbup.  The Yedo Gumbuk and Bonkuk Gumbuk are different than the ancient Ye do and Bok Kuk Gum forms demonstrated in Ancient Korean Sword and Weapon Arts&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Korean-Sword-and-Weapon-Arts-DVD/dp/B000CC45WK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Korean Sword and Weapon Arts DVD</a>. The forms, nevertheless, maintain the same gracefulness, circular motions, and train the body to generate enough power for practical sword defense, just like the original military forms.  The video also shows cutting exercises, which demonstrate the practical power of these techniques.  Combat practice further shows the practicality of these techniques.

The cover of the video is a little misleading, as the techniques in the video almost never require the low stances or the flexibility shown in the stance on the cover.  This is a martial art that almost anyone can learn, and the participants in the tape include both men and women, and both young and old.

The video also includes material beyond sword arts, such as breathing exercises and demonstrations of Ki, which is believed to be an unseen energy within the martial artist.  In one demonstration, a Korean master punches toward a lighted candle, but stops short of hitting it. His ki extinquishes the flame.  Nevertheless, this 70 minute video is not only interesting, it still provides more than enough sword material to be worth more than its reasonable price.",1188432000,9,2739,5.805
2411411,5,B000BBYSOW,"I've heard about this sword art, but never seen it practiced. Apparently it's quite the big thing in Korea these days. This DVD is a good overview of Haedong Kumdo (sometimes called Haidong Gumdo) - especially the higher rank forms and cutting techniques. All of the instructors are very skilled and some are quite high ranking practitioners in Korea so you know you're seeing the forms and techniques done the way their supposed to be done, not a third-hand imitation. For practitioners, especially those outside of Korea, I think this is a great asset in learning. This isn't an instructional DVD but it doesn't pretend to be so I'm giving it 5 stars for accomplishing exactly what it promises to with very good production values and plenty of content.",1149033600,8,754,4.852713178294573
2411412,2,B000BBYSOW,"Unless you practice the system or forms presented in this video, you will not find it of use. This video contain almost no instruction or useful applications. As a practitioner of Chinese Swordsmanship I purchased it out of curiousity, I wish I had spent my money on something else... The Rock 'n' Roll presentation of the cutting sequenced just gave me a headache.",1146441600,3,365,4.809523809523809
8084790,5,B000BBYSOW,So MUCH information! Where to begin? My friend and I are practicing each day. Fun and exciting.......,1497312000,,101,5.0
8084791,2,B000BBYSOW,It would've got one star if the price wasn't so cheap. I am pretty sure this was recorded with one of the shoulder cams from the 80s. Oh and it's not instructional it's just an overview of the art.,1457568000,,197,4.076923076923077
8084792,4,B000BBYSOW,"As a martial artist (5th DAN,  in both Japanese & Korean Arts)  and practitioner of Japanese Sword I found this DVD interesting and a worthwhile purchase.  It is more of a demonstration video with not much instruction.  Though the demonstrators were masters at times some of the techniques seemed a little sloppy with an emphasis placed on showmanship throughout the video.  Some of the acrobatic techniques in the forms and some techniques could be questioned as to practicality in actual combat and wondering if these techniques were added for showmanship.  The forms however were very interesting to watch as well as the cutting demonstrations which were highly repetitive.  The music throughout the video at times was both annoying and distracting.  The video is highly recommended for students of the sword arts.",1454112000,,817,5.183206106870229
8084793,2,B000BBYSOW,"Disappointed with this video.  I carry a 3rd dan in Haedong Kumdo, and thought this might be a good reference for my students, but the execution is sloppy, there is no real information, and it's pretty clear this video is just meant to be ""pretty""",1419984000,2,247,4.488888888888889
8084794,1,B000BBYSOW,"There is no instructional video on this DVD. If you watch the trailer on turtle press' YouTube channel, it is only what you see in the trailer. It is only demonstrations, you will not be able to learn haidong gumdo by watching masters performing high level skills without teaching basics.",1400025600,,288,4.78
8084795,4,B000BBYSOW,"I really liked this dvd, although it didn't offer many lessons on the basics. I have been learning sword for about twelve years now and was looking for something to build off. My experience is mostly in kendo, shin kendo, Siouyu Ryu Iai-jitsu, and a little korean sword. The video shows each sequence twice, and varies a few angles for clarity, but you will be on your own in the details. If you are interested in learning sword, this is great to augment your training in you have prior experience. If you do not at least have the basics, this will not teach them to you. There are still some areas that I would like to have explained, at least shown an application of the techniques.
This is all based on the old korean military text, Muye Dobo Tongji. I have a few versions of this book and notice that the methods do indeed reflect the book, but remember, it's all translated so what they're doing is a translation, it may be dead-on or way-off what the ancient koreans were practicing. Still, I am not disappointed, I have used this to up my training.",1373328000,2,1055,4.443298969072165
8084796,1,B000BBYSOW,"I take classes these people don't know what they're talking about.  I don't even know what this teaches you form 1-12? All i know is its a rip off.  Its spelled ""Haidong Gumdo""or Gumdo for short.",1363305600,,195,4.388888888888889
8084797,4,B000BBYSOW,"I'm not, nor do I claim to be a sword master.  I've never used a sword for practice of any kind of sorts of activity.  I was very impressed by what I seen.  I can see by the labeling how some would viewers would feel mislead.  From what I viewed - seen the instructors did a very good job of giving examples, of there Art, and froms - technique's.  The instructional part of DVD - depends on the viewer, and there level of understanding - concepts on training, and fighting.  All in I really did like what I viewed.  Leonardo P. Ambrose",1313193600,2,536,4.196078431372549
8084798,5,B000BBYSOW,"this dvd is nice for fans.
not deep enough to learn new moves.
maybe not deep enough to make new friends.
but who knows hdgd will like to have seen this dvd once.",1306281600,2,162,3.9393939393939394
