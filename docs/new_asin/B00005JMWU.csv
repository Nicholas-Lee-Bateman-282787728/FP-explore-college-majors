1501702,4,B00005JMWU,"Gritty film with a fun story line and fine music. It does tend to romanticize the culture and fails to focus on Roma morality, which differa significantly from that of the rest of the world.",1447113600,,190,4.457142857142857
1501703,5,B00005JMWU,"I own very few DVDs, but I searched long and wide for this one, and for a long time wasn't able to find it. This movie is strictly for art-movies lovers, as far from Hollywood-ness, action, romance and suspense as only can be, even though it is a masterful handling of some of these things. A combination of surrealism and brutal reality, extraordinarily funny and extraordinarily heart-wrenching. It is one of the five or six totally unforgettable movies I have seen in my life, a real masterpiece.",1432944000,,499,4.747126436781609

1501791,1,B00005JMWU,"Strange and dark movie. Scenes of rape, child abuse and exploitation. Depressing to say the least. There is nothing ""magical"" about this movie. If you want to ""save"" your two hours - we wish we could get it back to no avail.",1406764800,,224,4.357142857142857
1501792,5,B00005JMWU,"This film, along with 'The Double Life of Veronique,' 'The Magic Toy Shop,' and one or two others, is one of the most luminous, transcendant, magical and haunting films I have ever seen. Never a false move, or unsubtle one. The plot has surprising twists that make perfect sense. The ending is tragic, and perfect.

Another reviewer said it will haunt you forever once you see, and he is correct. I tried to find it online for years and am glad Amazon.com has it.",1406160000,,463,4.511904761904762

1501794,4,B00005JMWU,"I bought the exact same DVD in Korea because this one you are about to buy is made in Korea.
The movie itself is a masterpiece. My best. Trust me. I have over 4,000 DVDs and Blurays and this movie is my personal best.
The visual of this DVD is 2/5 it feels like beeing transferred from the VHS. But does it really matter? It's TIME OF THE GYPSIS!!!
Go ahead and buy it while it is still exist!!!
After it's gone, It will be gone.
It won't be released from America or any other country anymore.
This is it!!
PS: Am I the seller of this DVD? NA.",1393372800,,543,3.9908256880733943

1501796,5,B00005JMWU,"As an American Rom, I have never loved a movie more that represents truth. However  me being a Rom or not Does not change the fact that since I saw it nearly 20 years ago I still find this is most touching, truthful and haunting films I've ever seen. Unfortunately I used to own the full 4 1/2 hour version that The Great Emir Kusturica  originally aired on Yugoslavian television That I idiotically gave to an old girlfriend who never returned it. Now this version is nearly impossible to find. But if you can and you love this film as much as I do seek out Kusturica DVD box set which has the two DVD full version which is even better, which Seems almost impossible. And for those Gadjo's  or non-Rom this film will give you the purest and most truthful insight on what it means to be Roma and true Rom culture than any other film you will ever come across. I find it terribly tragic that there is no official DVD release, if not a criterion collection version of this film. If anyone is ever been interested in Gypsy culture, and what it truly means to be, don't pass this film by. Every person I've ever made to sit and watch this film has loved it dearly. It it is our duty to make sure that this film gets an official DVD release. And not a bootlegged Korean version. And if dreams can really come true the four a half hour version will also be officially released. For those of you who enjoy this great film as much as I, look for the full version Please and leave a remark on this review telling me where I can find it again.",1386115200,,1533,4.225255972696246
1501797,3,B00005JMWU,"While I don't share the same enthusiasm of the five-star reviewers, I have to admit, I was riveted. Not because I thought this was an amazing film, but because it fascinated me. This lifestyle and culture is foreign to me, and I felt like I was experiencing something incredibly unique. And even though I'm not as gung-ho as some of the other reviewers, I'm not about to discredit them, either. This is certainly a, ""to each his own'"" type of movie. And even though these were't Oscar winning performances, the acting was surprisingly good, all things considered. It's not one that I'd purchase, but as a one-shot deal, to me, it was worth renting. As a recommendation, I'd give it along with a warning: This film is not for everyone. If you're looking for something completely different, something NOT HOLLYWOOD, and you're interested in movies about other cultures, than this movie is worth looking into. There is nudity, drinking, and a scene of forced prostitution, so it definitely isn't 'family friendly', but it IS a unique experience that some people might find worth watching. Just keep in mind: This is NOT a high budget Hollywood movie. But if you're looking for something fascinatingly unique, than this is one to consider. I think three stars is a fair rating.",1381622400,,1273,4.844036697247707
1501798,5,B00005JMWU,"excellent film ~ gritty, poignant, thought-provoking.
Gives an excellent picture of life on the margins of society, and the difficulties",1376784000,,136,5.85
1501799,5,B00005JMWU,"This movie is a ""must see"". It is definitely one of Kusturica's best (which is saying something for a 3-time Cannes Golden Palm winner). Time of Gypsies has some of the same actors as Black Cat, White Cat (also a contender for Kusturica's best). Time of Gypsies is a bit more disjointed, but the stays with you in a way that few other movies do. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1376611200,,365,4.462686567164179
1501800,5,B00005JMWU,If I were forced to pick one I'd call this my favorite. The double tra=nslation is a little wonky but I'm glad someone finally put it on DVD for this region. I first saw the film on VHS. Greart condition and shipping time. I'm pleased with this seller.,1367625600,,252,4.270833333333333
1501906,3,B00005JMWU,"this was an okay substitute with a lot of favorite themes of the metteur -en- scene, flowing rivers geese, Romas and the passions, i really liked but not as joyful as Black cat white cat, less fairy tale like and more dystopic",1362960000,,226,4.404761904761905
1501907,5,B00005JMWU,"excellent, innocent and beautiful. A unscripted look at life in a gypsy family. Highly recommend this film. Hate Amazon film rating",1358812800,,131,5.285714285714286
1501908,5,B00005JMWU,"A superb movie. It captures the spirit of these people so well and let's you appreciate the struggles and the all the complexities involved. Thank you, Kosturica.",1355529600,,162,5.037037037037037
1501909,5,B00005JMWU,"An excellent film portraying the hard life of the poorer Romani, but not necessary the portrayal of all Roma.
As with other ethnic groups , there does exist different economical and social strata. The film is very profound and haunting but does have its moments where Romani life and its music brings much joy and fulfilment. I recommend this film to those who have a broad understanding (without stereotyping the entire people and its culture).",1354147200,,445,4.946666666666666
1501910,5,B00005JMWU,"I was very happy to finally be able to purchase this classic from Emir Kusturica. The quality is superb and, although it's produced in Korea, there was no problem viewing the subtitles in English.",1342915200,,196,4.794117647058823
1501911,3,B00005JMWU,"I've searched for a DVD of this film for years, but the only versions available were VHS tapes, and DVDs not formatted for US players. Finally, this version released in S. Korea is formatted for all regions. Unfortunately, the visual quality is less than ideal, and the English subtitles appear to have been dashed off by a non-English speaker - misspellings, odd word choices, and the pronoun ""I"" is hit and miss capitalized and then not - often within a single sentence. The story, characters and images remain compelling, but the poor production of this release is distracting and disappointing.",1303862400,,598,4.99
1501912,3,B00005JMWU,"I can see why many people love this movie, but it is just not my cup-of-tea.

Great story about a kid growing up the life of a gypsy. Some quite humourous moments and lots of diverse characters.

Problem is: It just goes on too long. I lost interest after an hour and skipped much of the last hour. I think I still got pretty much the whole plot though.

Great visuals in the 2 main locations, to show the contrast between the Gypsy world and the big city. The acting was ok, sometimes great sometimes not so.

Overall, a unique experience to watch, but some of the scenes just drag on. For example, the wedding - I skipped to the bride and groom leaving in the car, must have been a good 10 minutes and really felt like I hadn't missed a thing.",1282176000,,745,4.188811188811189
1501913,5,B00005JMWU,"I rarely give 5-star ratings for anything. This deserves my 5-star rating. Why? Firstly, the structure and dialogue of the movie. It constantly keeps me engaged and interested in the flow. The story had a unique twist. Even though it's about an innocent boy who gets ""lured"" to a the crime world of ""lies and deceit,"" the way in which the director tells the story is strikingly unique and ultimately, emotionally  beautiful and touching.

It is not really ""sappy"" because the dark comedy outweighs that. There are moments where you really see into the lives of these people, despite the surreal dreamy scenes and ethereal atmosphere. And the cinematography blew me away - absolutely beautiful. There are no apparent 3D computer ""special effects"", but there are scenes that are so surreal that they can stay in your mind long after the movie is finished. I was entranced by the scenes.

The characters really grew on me, especially the main character, Perhan. You not only become an observer watching him, but the director weaves the story in such a way that you start to see the world through Perhan's eyes. You become like the innocent boy that Perhan was, as he transforms into a different world. You become his side-kick along his journey.

The movie is also very dynamic, moving from place to place, city to city. I like that in a movie, and enjoy the way in which the director weaved the scenes almost seamlessly together. It is quite a work of art, visually and storyboard-wise. It is not only a movie; it is a total experience. You must watch to understand fully what I mean. You will not only be entertained but learn something about this culture in a very unique way.",1275696000,,1676,4.709897610921502
1501914,5,B00005JMWU,"At this point in time my only comment can be, that the negligence of not releasing this film on DVD is a crime against culture, liberty and art. Who the hell is responsible for such an oversight. Even the ""Pay for View"" download from Amazon.com is witheld from customers outside the U.S. It's an absolute scandal. Amazon is certainly guilty in some way. Or is there an excuse - such as imminent terrorist dangers emanating from people outside the U.S. watching this film.  For this reason I am boycotting amazon for the time-being.

This film won Emir Kusterica the ""Best Director"" award (Unanimously!) at the Cannes Film Festival 1989.

Please correct this sorry state of affairs and I will happily spend my money with you again!",1246665600,,730,4.777777777777778
1501915,5,B00005JMWU,"I've seen this movie a few times and it's one of my all time favorites. It appears to be out of print on VHS...I think, and it is not available on DVD. I saw it when it came out in the theaters and then went looking for it fairly recently so I could watch it again. The used copy I bought was in so-so condition, but it was worth it. It's about a boy who initially has good intentions when he chooses to work for a con artist to earn enough money to help his family and his girlfriend, but becomes corrupted by the lifestyle. It's a tale that is both touching and comedic, the characters are really strong and the cinematography is great. I also bought the soundtrack, which is one of the best aspects of the film, it's beautiful.",1234656000,,730,4.184397163120567
1501982,1,B00005JMWU,"I am surprized everybody likes this movie. Not me. If the movie is not on public channels its not worth it. Like my favored "" When Harry met Sallie""  which is shown regularly and after I watched it about 20 times I start thinking--United States is communistic country after all.
Additional trouble is I cannot buy this ""Time of the gypsies"" which again and again  proves we don't need it.
Hahaha.",1218412800,,396,4.563380281690141
1501983,5,B00005JMWU,"Watched it today for the first time in a couple of years, having managed to seize a used copy from a closing video rental store. I figured it had to have been sold by then, but some sly, kindred soul had actually hidden it deep in the tape racks.

It still is the most harrowing and affecting cinematic odyssey I have ever experienced. Like receiving truth through magic.

How many five star reviews are necessary for distributors to realize the value of this film? Seriously...",1198368000,,478,4.6117647058823525
1501984,5,B00005JMWU,"I just want to add my voice to those who have expressed below, with more passion and erudition than I can, how magical this movie is.  I saw it, bought it, years ago when I stumbled on it for rent at Tower Records.  It is one of the only movies I own, I think about it's imagery all the time, I bring it up anytime anyone asks if I have seen any other movie, and I will always keep a working VCR player until they release it on DVD even if I never watch it again.  It opened up a space, a room, in the forefront of my mind - the imagery is burned there, because it surfaces again and again, sharp as it was 15 years ago.",1190851200,,620,3.828125
1501985,5,B00005JMWU,I saw this film many years ago and still recall the visceral impact it had on me. This film has so much heart and soul and is so moving and visually stunning. This film needs to be re-released on DVD!! It is an amazing little gem of a movie. In the mean time I guess I'll have to settle for the VHS.,1186444800,,299,3.838709677419355
1501986,5,B00005JMWU,"One of the most evocative and haunting movies I've ever seen, Time of the Gypsies leaves a bittersweet taste that tugs at some long lost childhood memory, though it most certainly is very unlike your own! The cinematography is so richly saturated and the soundtrack so stirring and emotive that all your senses get pulled into the story of little Pehran. A beautifully melancholic film that captures the essence of a very enigmatic people.",1135036800,,439,4.945945945945946
1501987,5,B00005JMWU,"This is one of the movies which you have never heard of, will never probably hear about.  Wonder what would have brought you here to read this review.

I saw this movie, when I was flipping channels in Hotel in Toronto in 2003 - the movie started on a slow note, but the various turns it took for the poor little boy Pehran was very saddening and makes your heart heavy at the end of the movie.

The movie captures the essence of gypsy living - their desire to settle down, the dreams in big cities, their local heroes and their family(?) life.

Excellent sound tracks and videography - I can still remember the lake in one of the moview scenes",1132790400,,644,4.297520661157025
1501988,5,B00005JMWU,"Any review given might be irrelevat , when it comes to describe ""Dom Za Vesanje"" , also known as ""Time of the Gypsies"".The plot s well known, and it s really hard to find , better example in the world of cinematography, where the music fits the story that perfect. Ready for an emotional soul trip?

Get to watch this extraordinary movie.

Too bad that DVD version has never been released.",1124928000,,389,4.464788732394366
1501989,5,B00005JMWU,"Emir Kusturica got inmersed with all the imaginable poetry and still more in the gypsy world. And his hallucinating handle camera helps eloquently for the absolute triumph of this artwork.
The dreams, hopes and tragedy will be told with such splendor that you will be surprised with its freshness and rapture.
A formidable statement that consolidated once more to Kusturica as one of the most promiment directors of the world in those ages.",1115856000,,440,5.041095890410959
1501990,5,B00005JMWU,"I decided to make, instead of the review, a comment of the film:
I couldn't believe what I was watching at the first 10 minutes. I didn't know if I had to laught, cry or just stare at the tv.
The history of the characters is amazing. One by one envolves you and introduce you to their owne history.

1501991,5,B00005JMWU,"The first great film from the greatest living European director.  Underground may be a more weighty work, but this is a deeply felt and beautiful movie.  The acting is great, the music superb and the art direction grotesque and masterful.  It is a fairy tale, an ethnography, a comic caper and a work of neorealism.  It succeeds at each level.
If one needs more evidence that this is a vapid and vile age, please note that this, one of the great masterworks of recent world cinema, is available only on VHS, while that Silent Bob releases on DVD interviews in which he pontificates away.",1050883200,,587,4.615384615384615

I first time saw this movie when I was no more than 14 years old. I saw it with my parents, and to be honest, I wasn't very excited at the moment... but ten minutes later I was unable to take away my eyes and mind from the screen. This film made me cry, laugh, think and then cry again. It made a point of change, It taught me WHAT I want from a movie, and it showed me that this kind of movie is unfortunately rare.",1012521600,,578,3.9913793103448274

1502071,4,B00005JMWU,"'Time of the gypsies' is a big, full movie.  It is full in the way a magic realism novel is full, with its inter-generational cast of characters; its vivid community life, where private is always public, and where the elements lash and squelch; where joy and tragedy co-exist; where magic, dream and delusion are fruitfully indistinguishable.  It is full in the Fellini sense, with its grand set pieces; its profusion of grotesques; its bursting compression of many plots; its general noisiness.  it is one film containing many simultaneous films (a gangster film; a surreal road movie; a romantic comedy; a rites-of-passage; a Christian allegory).  It somehow feels a little thin, like a tapestry of chunks from a massive novel.  it is certainly an example of retrospective dating - at the time it seemed a masterpiece; over a decade on, it's pastiche Kusturica.",987724800,,863,5.049295774647887
1502072,5,B00005JMWU,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It was my first Kosturitza movie and since then I have watched most of them.  Time of the Gypsies still remains my favorite (Black Cat White Cat is getting close). The story is about a gypsy who has to make a life choice and he chooses wrong, losing his closest people.  A sad and very well done film.  Coming from a region very close to Yugoslavia and knowing well the lifestyle of Easter European gypsies, I can say that the portrayal of the gypsies is very accurate.
But perhaps the best part of the movie is its music--Goran Bregovich is unbelievable.  Even if all of my above comments are ignored, the soundtrack alone is worth watching teh entire movie.",986860800,,709,4.423076923076923
1502073,5,B00005JMWU,"Having lived and worked in Russia for one year[1997], where the Gypsies are everywhere and seemed exactly like they do in this movie, I can vouch that this wonderful film is something you will never forget. After I saw this, I availed myself of the many books that have been written about the Gypsy or Rom culture. They are originally descended--it is thought--from India. However, they have been nomadic for so long it is hard to pin them down. The Rom culture is very strong and family oriented. They have, unfortunately, been the subject of much persecution.",954028800,,561,4.793814432989691

Be careful: this  one will haunt you for the rest of your life.

1502075,5,B00005JMWU,"Do not let this title fool you: I was completely cast away and totally spellbound by this movie. It only served to enhance the aura of the film to subconciously have to listen to the Romany language being spoken because it  is a lovely and strange tongue. The subtitles were simple but sometimes a  bit wrong which led to a lightening up on some of the tragedy the evolves  in this story.
It is a world we never get to glimpse; a secret chasm of  humanity living on the cusp of depricating debauchery and exploitation of  its own people.  It totally shakes and spins what we know of life. A  beautiful sad undulating pathos floats us from frame to frame on this film.  The music is superb and I wish it has a sound track because for days it has  been echoing through my brain.
 There is kind of an over done  ""thing"" about a bridal veil that sort of floats around like a  spectre on a wire...but that does not detract from this hauntingly lovely  film. SEE IT!",943660800,,960,4.29608938547486
