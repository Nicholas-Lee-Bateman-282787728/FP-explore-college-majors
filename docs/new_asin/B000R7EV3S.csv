8199098,4,B000R7EV3S,This is a good learning and teaching tool for drummers who are working in both drum line and a band. This man can play the rudiments of drumming and he sure displays that here.,1397433600,,176,4.205882352941177
8199099,3,B000R7EV3S,"This drum video was of an international rudiment champion.  He can play the rudiments, no question.  It's good to have something you can easily go to in order to see the rudiments pulled off correctly.  The video does that, so I can't really go below three stars.  But, this video is not really DVD-quality.  Plus, this guy is kind of a tool in the way he presents his drumsticks before and after each rudiment.  There's also no real explanation of how to actually execute the rudiment, or how you'd use a rudiment in actual playing (like using paradiddles in order to switch hands on the downbeat).  He just pulls out his sticks like some twitchy robot, launches into the rudiment and puts his sticks back like a twitchy robot.

Bottom line...save your money.  The rudiment clips on youtube are just as good, if not better.",1249171200,2,824,4.627586206896551
