In the video a guy was handing people bags with grounding kits but what was in the bag??? We don't know.

What kind of wire is best for grounding?  copper, aluminum, composite, steel?
Does the voltage go towards 0 when grounded? Why is this good for living things?
How effective is using an outlet to ground when people live in high condo & it's a long path for the wiring in the walls to reach the ground?

6031048,5,B00FTE5R4G,"I congratulate the makers of this documentary for the fine way they have woven into it the stories of ordinary people who have benefited from ""earthing/grounding"" along with obvious endorsements from scientific and environmental pioneers such as Dr. David Suzuki.

I learned about ""earthing"" initially from a woman with multiple sclerosis who had posted a link to the talk on it by Dr. Stephen Sinatra, MD at David Wolfe's ""Longevity Now Conference"".  Because of my background in electromagnetics, radio physics, and climatology, initially through a PhD in electrical engineering, and my more recent background doing full-time epidemiological research, the segment of Dr. Sinatra's talk about live blood before and after ""earthing"" made a particular impression.  I read the book ""Earthing"" and couldn't wait to start trying the ""earthing"" sheet and other products, which I ordered immediately.  Furthermore, I decided to try a small experiment on myself even before receiving the products.  I hooked myself up to the ground on the electrical system by attaching a lamp cord to the grounded center screw on the faceplate of an electrical outlet, with the other bare ends in my sock.  I noticed within five minutes that my body was relaxing, and that this did not ""turn off"" as to some extent meditation or Reiki do after completion.  Of course the latter can't be continued indefinitely as can ""earthing"".

I used the lamp-cord approach in bed the first night, and had the best sleep that I had probably had in 20 years.  Besides feeling very rested on fully awakening, I noticed that I could dose, something that I had not been able to do except perhaps two or three times in that 20 years.  I have found this technique so powerful for my own sleep that I typically fall asleep within a few minutes after ""hitting the earthing sheet"".  I always notice the sense of my body relaxing immediately, and the sense of ""tingling"" in the feet and hands that I feel is stronger the more I have felt stressed beforehand or not grounded myself for a few hours. On the few occasions when my body is so ""worked up"" from stress of some kind or another that ""earthing"" is slow to work, I find that Reiki helps further, and therefore at such times also use it before sleep.  Note that the earthing products have a 100 kilohm resistor in series for safety, unlike my lamp cord.  Note also my review of the ""earthing starter kit"" where I comment on the design of the ""earthing"" sheet.  Finally, note my review of the ""earthing recovery bag"" where I comment on the apparent enhanced benefit of its design innovation.

What followed had even more powerful benefits for my health:

(i) I have lost the apparent chronic adrenal fatigue that I had for 18 years, the worst of my symptoms since the 1990's.  Of the 40+ symptoms I had in the late 1990's and had gradually been getting rid of since then through attention to nutrition and hydration, apparent detoxification (e.g., replacement of mercury-amalgam dental fillings, use of a near-infrared far-visible ""electric-light"" sauna, application of some apparent liver-detoxification techniques, and use of ""dry-skin brushing"",  the latter reputed to cleanse the lymphatic system), and sunlight sufficiency, this was one of the few holdout problems besides sleep, all difficult to bear, that didn't respond well to any of the other techniques that I tried.  It disappeared within days of starting ""earthing"".

(ii) I also lost my ""cold extremities"" (feet and hands) within days of starting ""earthing"".  This was especially noticeable because I started ""earthing"" on 11 Nov 2010, and it was already getting quite cold at my home in Eastern Ontario by then. Pretty clearly, this seems because the circulation to my feet and hands improved. Apparently the extra electrons (beyond those from food) charge up the red blood cells more negatively so that they repel each other and flow more freely. This ""freely flowing"" action can be observed on the video of Dr. Stephen Sinatra noted above.  My guess is that improvement in thyroid function may also have been a factor in losing the cold extremities.  One other way in which I noticed the improvement in circulation was through my cross country skiing.  I used to be able to easily ski to work at -27C or so in the morning and keep my feet warm in the ski boots that I had.  At a certain point, I couldn't do this beyond -10C.  I know that I can now do it again at least to -18C, and haven't yet tried it at lower temperatures.

(iii) Before ""earthing"", I had got to the point where I usually had some morning muscle stiffness on arising from sleep.  This also disappeared within days.

(iv) Over the three years time that I have been ""earthing"", I have generally become more relaxed overall.  I was feeling so stressed by some aspects of my research by 2010 that I had the very real sense of my stress being a little out of control. I quickly lost this sense soon after I began ""earthing"", and the overall effect has gradually improved further with time.  I had been diagnosed with a ""sympathetic dominant"" nervous system in 2005, and ""earthing"" has apparently rebalanced my autonomic nervous system as the research references copied onto the website of the ""Earthing Institute"" suggest.  Note that the dozen or so research studies done on ""earthing"" and the associated increasingly-supported hypotheses for its basis that are included in these references should be fairly understandable by those without a scientific background because they are mostly based on experimental results.

Since ""earthing"" had such a quick and significant benefit for me, I decided that I would not take the risk, given my past health issues, and only use the ""earthing"" sheet at night, even though this is the time when most bodily regeneration seems to be done.  I have therefore also been using the ""earthing"" footpad while seated, and much of the time the torso band while working in the kitchen or elsewhere, the telescopic cord being hardly noticeable.  (Unfortunately, except during my half-hour sun break in bare feet and bathing suit on most warm sunny days, I don't find much barefoot contact with the earth suitable for my lifestyle now, and am looking forward to the day when a range of well-designed shoes will have electrical grounding suitably built into ""minimalist"" soles and heels. 4 Aug 2015: Note my review of the new ""earthing"" shoes by Pluggz, specifically the ""grounding drivers"".)  After some experimentation, I quickly had the sense that the ""earthing"" half-sheet worked best for me when used full length and rapped around my pillow.  My sister found the same thing when trying this some months later after initially using the sheet across the bottom of her bed.  I have some small concern that using the sheet full length too soon might be problematic for those with environmental chemical poisoning issues if ""earthing"" increases levels of the energy coenzyme ATP as suggested by Dr. Sinatra and his colleagues and if the number and location of the grounding points while sleeping matters, too rapid an increase in cellular energy possibly allowing for greater detoxification too quickly.  I think the increase in ATP levels may be evidenced by my rapid recovery from apparent chronic adrenal fatigue and the observations of others of increased energy.

There are observations in the scientific literature that both sufficient electrons and sufficient energy in the red to near-infrared range (e.g., see ANNEX and papers of Dr. T.I. Karu) may be necessary in generating adequate levels of ATP.  In order to supply the extra electrons to help generate ATP, act as antioxidants within the body, and accomplish other ""inflammation-reducing"" tasks as suggested in the references copied onto the ""Earthing Institute"" website, it seems to me that a tiny flow of electrons through the body must be established.  My guess is that the flow of electrons potentially needed throughout the body is accomplished by circuits established through a combination of (a) the electrical grounding of the person, and (b) the ""plating"" of positive air ions on the surface of the skin, both as suggested by John F. Wetling as part of his explanation for how acupuncture best works in his 2006 article, ""About 'Acupuncture Qi', and what's it all about?"", available on the internet.  Do the location and number of grounding points on the surface of the skin make a difference to the directions of flow of such currents through the body?  Is the apparently helpful use of ""earthing"" patches placed in different locations on the body noted in the book ""Earthing"" evidence for this?

Obviously not everyone benefits as much, as the authors of the book ""Earthing"" make clear.  It seems to depend on the degree of ""electron deficiency"" that the person has, and perhaps the extent of their fundamental health problems since it seems that the persons with the largest health problems sometimes benefit most.  My mother didn't think she observed any effect from ""earthing"" initially, but I have noticed that she no longer takes any painkiller for her knee, which is something that she occasionally did before.  My aunt didn't notice anything either, but I have observed that her doctor reduced her thyroid medication after about a year.

Since I indicate the lamp-cord approach in my observations above, I emphasize the cautionary admonitions on the ""Earthing Institute"" website that: (a) if the person being earthed/grounded is taking thyroid medication, it is important to have their doctor check if it needs to be reduced at some point, (b) if the person is on the drug Coumadin/warfarin or another ""blood thinner"", likewise more quickly, since ""earthing"" also apparently thins the blood as demonstrated in Dr. Stephen Sinatra's video.

ANNEX-Update (11 February 2014):  After reading Dr. Gerald Pollack's books, ""Cells, Gels, and the Engines of Life"" (2001), ""The Fourth Phase of Water: Beyond Solid, Liquid, and Vapor"" (2013; see my separate reviews of both books), and seeing his illuminating interviews and lectures on the internet,  I think that application of ""earthing"" must help provide adequate hydration of the cells with ""structured water"", help generate the associated exclusion of many solutes from such structured-water zones, help move unwanted solutes out through the lymphatic system, and help with other forms of specialized work such as activating the muscles (itself also helping to produce lymphatic flow). etc.  My guess is that electrons from the earth work together with those from the metabolic breakdown of food to generate the negatively-charged ATP in the cell mitochondria, which appear to attach to already negatively-charged protein surfaces in the cell (perhaps already the sites of electrons from the earth as suggested by Pollack in an interview, the whole process referred to as ""charge-induced protein extension""), allowing larger negatively-charged zones of structured water and perhaps therefore more discrimination against unwanted solutes than might otherwise be the case.  According to Pollack (2001), there is apparently a translocation of ATP from the mitochondria to the cell protein surfaces during a period of partially de-structured water, then a structuring of the water in the vicinity because of the concentration of negative charge on the cell surfaces, then a hydrolization of ATP to ADP and Pi, a partial de-structuring of the water during recycling of ADP and Pi back to the mitochondria and new ATP in the opposite direction, and return to the next cycle.  It seems plausible that the ""earthing"" source of electrons is an older evolutionary source than that of food, one that is available continuously.

As described in the more recent book, Pollack and his colleagues have demonstrated experimentally that electromagnetic wave energy, mainly in the near infrared and visible-red range of the spectrum in that order of importance, helps generate and maintain such negatively-charged zones and adjacent positively-charged zones of hydronium ions (H3O)+ in bulk liquid water in non-cellular containers, a seemingly general result that should apply to cellular and extracellular regions of the body with hydrophilic/""water-loving"" surfaces also.  (The highest energy outputs of an ""electric light"" sauna occur in the same order, just as in natural sunlight.  Is it significant that I couldn't get rid of my major symptoms without ""earthing"", despite the fact that I was frequently exposed to sunlight from 2005, and usually in the ""electric-light"" sauna twice a day for 40 minutes for over two years from 2005?  Those techniques helped but they didn't eliminate my major symptoms, which I take as evidence for the high importance of ""earthing"".)  This seems most likely to be the oldest evolutionary source of energy.  A continuous supply of electrons from the earth, and from metabolism, could work together with the continuous supply of largely near-infrared light energy to maintain the apparently structured-water molecules of H3O2 within and possibly exterior to the cells, along with adjacent zones of positively-charged bulk water and hydronium ions, such zone pairs essentially constituting a series of ""batteries"" as noted by Pollack.

Pollack and his colleagues have also demonstrated that the creation of such structured-water zones in narrow tubes can cause the water to flow continuously in one direction through such tubes with exposure to infrared light. This three-energy-source process, or an even more general four-energy source process (including a pulsed magnetic energy source noted below), including that from ""earthing"", and the resulting phase transitions in water may also at least partially help explain the process of blood movement through the smallest capillaries and the connected parallel lymph flow partially upwards in the body against gravity, both important for good circulation.  It has been noted by Pollack, for example, that there is some blood flow for up to an hour after the heart stops beating. Moreover, I have noticed that my dry-skin brushing is always followed by a need to urinate, and Pollack notes that the volume of water held by diapers is many more times that of urine, a demonstration of the larger molecules contained in urine. I know that practitioners of ""lymphatic drainage massage"" also find that urination follows from this, and the scientific literature apparently confirms the elimination of some unwanted waste products from such application.  It is known that lymphatic pumping is increased by ATP among other things, and that it is decreased by unwanted reactive oxygen metabolites.

I have so far only alluded to possible constant direct currents (DC) flowing through the body to meet positive air ions of mostly nitrogen on the surface of the skin.  There is some evidence that the zones of structured water facilitate electrical conduction in the body.  The documentary alludes to a potential role for Schumann resonance fields in ""earthing"", which are solar- and lightning-generated ELF waves in the atmospheric ""waveguide"" between the earth and the ionosphere.  Because of the known similarity in the frequencies of brain waves to those of Schumann resonance, it does not seem unlikely that electromagnetic induction from these waves, or simply a modulation of the positive ion charge and associated electric field on the skin at a point distant from the grounding point, or both, could provide the equivalent of a ""pulsed"" DC signal on top of an average DC component.  Besides potentially helping to explain why ""earthing"" might reduce ""jetlag"" by at least helping to control a kind of ""body clock"" based on the known different day-night character of the phenomenon, and that of brain waves (suggested by some as associated with the variations of melatonin), this may constitute a natural form of pulsed EMF corresponding to the artificial PEMF accepted by the US FDA as suitable treatment for certain heath conditions.  Indeed, both electric field and magnetic field variations of Schumann resonance waves have been measured, and there is other evidence that Schumann resonance fields may affect health.  Since the body is known to contain some magnetite, energy medicine techniques such as Reiki may be another natural application of PEMF, and indeed, magnetometer measurements during Reiki seem to have confirmed this.

The documentary appeared to attach some scientific significance to ancient humans dancing around such sites as Stonehenge on Salisbury plane in southern England, and our ancestors may have felt wonder for at least one reason.  Just as ""earthing"" appears to enhance ATP production in animals and plants, both enhanced magnetic fields at the earth's surface that are associated with natural magnetic anomalies, telluric currents near some such sites, or flowing water near the same or other sites, and enhanced electric fields associated with the same sites or others (e.g., at the top of stone pyramids or earthen mounds), could also help to increase total negative charge, and therefore ATP levels, in seeds deposited there.  The building of such structures because of their effect on seeds deposited there is the fundamental hypothesis of Burke and Halberg in their book ""Seed of Knowledge Stone of Plenty"" (see my separate review), although they seem to associate the effect with a kind of ""stress hardening"" on the seeds, rather than to the effect noted above.  ""Stress hardening"", or its sub-technique of ""cold hardening"", could be separate effects allowing increased net energy generation through overall reduction of free radicals, possible examples being that of exercise noted by the authors, and the effect of an alternating hot and cold shower on the feeling of increased energy and well being in human subjects.  In any case, it does not seem far fetched to imagine a similar effect on the plants subsequently grown from such seeds (demonstrated by Burke and Halberg) and possibly also on their human planters dancing there.

Increased ATP production in seeds could be explained through the application of either or both enhanced electric and magnetic fields.  With the latter, it could arise through a speeding up of the orbital velocity of valence electrons around their nuclei, a principle discussed by Dr. Dean Bonlie in application to magnetic mattress pads used to enhance the earth's magnetic field below humans lying there.  As evidenced through the work of Bonlie and others, the presence of the earth's magnetic field may itself be an essential requirement, along with ""earthing"", for the generation of sufficient ATP in seeds, plants, and animals.  This could occur through an increase in total negative charge applied to the phase-transition processes in cellular water discussed by Dr.  Pollack.  Indeed, there is other evidence for such an additional magnetic mechanism referred to as ""magneto-protonics"", explained as the ""cyclotron resonance application of proton transport in water under the action of the earth's magnetic field"".  Is this effect associated with a potential role for magnetic field variations from Schumann resonance also?

Because of the apparent importance of water structuring in the body and ""earthing"" as a partial driver of this, I think that there should be an altitude factor associated with ""earthing"", the benefit increasing with increasing altitude.  As noted, I believe that ""earthing"" functions in part because of a difference of electric potential across essentially two points on the body.  One is the point(s) at ground potential touching the earth.  The other is the point, or more strictly the points, where the positive air ions are ""plating"" on the skin elsewhere.  Since the number of positive air ions plating on the skin should increase with increasing altitude, following the normal increase of positive air ion density with increasing altitude, the magnitude of the electric field across the body should also increase.  Through a simple application of Ohm's law, this should increase the magnitude of the tiny current flowing through the body, and therefore the amount of negative charge available for the structuring of water in the cellular and extracellular body matrix.  I think this may be one reason for the apparent increase of life expectancy at higher altitudes.  I discuss this issue in a little more depth in my review of ""Seed of Knowledge Stone of Plenty"", since this should also affect seeds and plants.  Moreover, I think that evidence for this effect may already be provided through the known tendency of the builders of some of the ancient mounds and pyramids to erect as high structures as within their means.

It seems clear to me now that since the resistance of human skin is known to be high, at least at those points other than the acupuncture points, only those points on the skin touching the earth (or the ""earthing"" product) are at ground potential.  Other points are at the potential associated with the positive air ions plating on the skin.  I believe this is the reason why ""earthing"" patches placed near pain points, or ""zones of inflammation"", have been found to be effective.  This would help direct current flow through such zones, increasing the number of electrons available for the structuring of water in them, and for the consequent elimination of unwanted solutes.  I think that this may be also the reason why the larger the area of skin contact with the ""earthing"" sheet, apparently the better. Acupuncture should also function in much the same way, but with the needle directing the current through the ""zone of inflammation"", rather than the ""earthing"" patch doing this.  The difference is that since the needle increases the positive air ion density on it and in its vicinity, the effect should be amplified.  My guess is that if the body is not grounded during acupuncture, its operation may depend on both negative and positive air ions plating on the skin in different locations, the location of the negative ions functioning as a very inefficient ground point in effect.

The possible geophysical sources of energy input to the body discussed here, including that of Schumann resonance, were addressed (along with magnetic pulse energy from Reiki and other energy medicine techniques) by one of the current ""earthing"" pioneers, Dr. James Oschmann, in his books, ""Energy Medicine:  The Scientific Basis"" (2000) and/or ""Energy Medicine in Therapeutics and Human Performance"" (2003). He recognized even in the earlier book the potentially important role of water in the cellular and extracellular matrix, and discussed in his second book the initial important work of Pollack (2001) and his predecessors on phase-transition processes.  In view of the apparent importance of ""earthing"" as a simple and inexpensive fundamental preventative and curative health modality, and the apparent fundamental role of cellular and extracellular water therein, I find the historical article of physiologist Dr. Ray Peat, ""Pathological Science and General Electric: Threatening the Paradigm"", rather telling.  What a fitting finale to a beautiful and important documentary to have the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra performing the score to ""The Grounded"" grounded!

UPDATE (7 Aug 2015): Apparently as a result of my 97-year-old mothers seven-month illness and death last September, I felt unusually stressed and a little fatigued for many months until recently.  In fact, it had me thinking that ""earthing"" was not working as well for me as previously.  About two months ago, I began using transdermal magnesium chloride hexahydrate in place of oral magnesium supplements that I had been using for 22 years, including apparently some of the best absorbable ones in recent years (e.g., magnesium glycinate).  I noticed some significant beneficial effect within minutes and much more over the two months since then.  As it turns out, the scientific literature on the essential role of magnesium ions in activating ATP and preventing overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is extensive, and there is compelling information available that oral supplementation of magnesium may no longer be sufficient for anyone, let alone those of my age and older who don't absorb nutrients as well as younger people (e.g., see the book and articles by Dr. Mark Sircus on transdermal magnesium and the videos of Ian Clark at easemagnesium dot com).  Although I knew that stress tended to deplete magnesium, I hadnt appreciated that repletion through oral supplementation could take so long for someone in my situation.  Thus, it seems that ""earthing"" may not be sufficient to raise ATP levels adequately, to balance the autonomic nervous system, etc. in some cases.  Is this one of the reasons that some people don't benefit from ""earthing"" as much as others?

UPDATE (5 Oct. 2016): Not so fast on my initial conclusion above that transdermal magnesium chloride hexahydrate could totally replace supplemented oral magnesium for someone over 70!  Yes, this worked exceedingly well at first, which I take as evidence that it better provides for certain regions of the body (e.g., muscles, etc.?) than does oral magnesium. However, after about six months, I again noticed that ""earthing"" was not working so well, especially as evidenced through poorer sleep and some unusual anxiety.  Even more alarming, I soon began to suffer from other symptoms that I was slow to recognize must have been caused by oral magnesium deficiency (constipation followed by two hemorrhoids, gum problem, etc.).  I say this because as soon as I began to supplement again with oral magnesium glycinate, while at the same time reducing the two transdermal applications per day (morning and just before bedtime) to just before bedtime, the constipation problem disappeared immediately followed soon after by the other symptoms.  I had already thought that two applications per day was more than should be necessary, especially on the basis of information from the supplier, but I initially reasoned that my particularly stressful lines of research might cause more magnesium depletion than normal. To my further relief, I quickly had the sense that ""earthing"" was fully working again.  Unfortunately, I had incorrectly diagnosed the constipation problem as entirely due to somewhat carelessly increasing bread consumption while decreasing vegetable consumption, a not unlikely diagnosis, and one supported by the two doctors to whom I posed it.

Clearly the transdermal magnesium had quickly eliminated the small amount of muscle tension that I knew was occasionally present, especially through an intermittent muscle spasm in my upper back and neck, and TMJ, that had appeared over the previous thee years, both of which an osteopathic physiotherapist thought were caused by the large amount of sitting that I do, and could be cured by special exercises. However, by somewhat of a coincidence, I began applying the transdermal magnesium and eliminated the oral magnesium supplementation without the latter, and quickly concluded that magnesium deficiency in the muscles was the major issue, and didn't initiate the special exercises.  Such a quick significant change is what led me to believe for so long that I could eliminate the oral magnesium supplementation, save for what was in my multivitamin, despite the new symptoms.

In retrospect, with all of the symptoms now departed,  it seems likely that someone over 70 and possibly a good deal sooner needs to supplement magnesium sufficiently from both oral and transdermal sources, each satisfying an apparent separate set of requirements.  A better reading of the book of Dr. Mark Sircus, ""Transdermal Magnesium"", makes clear that he already recommended both.  Think about it, we absorb magnesium chloride transdermally by swimming in seawater or salty lakes, and our ancestors who frequently dived for molluscs and other underwater creatures must have gotten even more.  Therefore, using a spray-on source for magnesium chloride hexahydrate, in addition to oral magnesium, seems not unreasonable.

In conclusion, since we know scientifically that electrons and magnesium are cofactors in generating ATP, let us not too quickly conclude that either  ""earthing"" or supplemented magnesium are unnecessary if one or the other fail to work as we expect from anecdotes.  Moreover, let us pay more attention to the natural health experts on magnesium on the best sources of the latter. Note that Dr. Laura Koniver, MD, an ""earthing"" expert, and someone with an apparently good deal of intuitive insight on other natural health issues also recommends supplementing magnesium from a Great Salt Lake source of other minerals also.  I am now doing this along with the transdermal and oral capsule sources on a regular basis, instead of just after a sauna, in order to ""hedge my bets"".

6 Apr 2017:  Although I have the sense that most adults, and especially elderly ones, benefit from magnesium supplementation and a diet high in this mineral, I am reminded by a reading of the new book of Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, MD, ""Nutrition and the Autonomic Nervous System: The Scientific Foundations of the Gonzalez Protocol"", that it likely depends on metabolic type, as does supplementation with other major nutrients such as potassium or calcium.  The book suggests, for example, that magnesium and potassium supplementation are necessary to move individuals with overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system to balance, and that calcium supplementation is necessary to move individuals with overactivation of the parasympathetic system to balance.  It seems likely that ""earthing"" also has a significant effect on autonomic balance because of the calming effects observed in some individuals.  Do sympathetic-dominant individuals benefit more from ""earthing"" than parasympathetic-dominant ones, or do both benefit equally? What about those who might be considered ""balanced metabolic types""?",1382745600,155,29991,5.22711157455683

6031066,2,B00FTE5R4G,"I'm giving this movie two stars for excellent camera work and the scene of a man joyfully wrestling a wolf.

The other three stars are missing because there just isn't a lot to this movie. It bounces around from one subject to the next pretty quickly, offers only the barest efforts at scientific study, and generally feels like the combined product of optimism and marijuana.

Often the director will begin to focus on some subject as it applies to the movies premise and then simply wander off as touching music and beautiful cinematography wash out any chance of a coherent thought forming. This happens over, and over, and over as the movie plays out, and it became quite monotonous and boring for me.

The subject of the movie is ""grounding"" or ""earthing"" which is the process of connecting to the earth's electric field through either direct contact or the use of a conductor. Which is about as much useful information as you will get out of watching ""The Grounded."" I really don't think there was a solid plan here for sharing the process or reasoning behind this subject. I can't really see any harm in standing around in the dirt barefoot, or watching a movie full of optimistic Ghanja science. I just don't think there's much to gain intellectually from the latter.

Overall, you're probably better of spending twenty minutes standing barefoot in the dirt than watching this movie, and Dr. Joseph Mercola would likely agree with me.",1445558400,4,1442,4.80241935483871

I read the Earthing book by Ober/Sinatra/Zucker and I thought it was amazing. Great introduction to earthing. I'm just trying earthing for the first time and so far I am seeing subtle but definite effects, so naturally I'm excited to read/watch anything I can about it.

Unfortunately, I couldn't connect with this film. It's intentions are good, and there are nuggets about earthing within it that were interesting, but it seems to be more of one man's life opus. It's disjointed, veers off in many directions, and doesn't provide a lot of solid information. I was hoping for a true, basic documentary here -- i.e., something that does for earthing what ""Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead"" did for juicing -- but this comes off as more of a first-time filmmaker's project, overly dramatic and confusing. I hope another filmmaker picks up the trail and makes a true documentary about earthing.",1432425600,5,940,4.832298136645963

The Alaskan filmmaker brings incredible research and studies to the screen with this amazing film. The concept of ""earthing"" is so simple and yet it makes complete common sense. He takes us around the world from the world of medicine and science to nature and history. He began testing this in his home town of Haines, Alaska and witnesses it working on his friends, people in the town, plants and animals. Even the Apollo astronauts get involved as we are taken on a journey of an orderly universe which takes place in our own bodies. It was incredible to see the results on the blood velocity after two hours of earthing. The results were unequivocal and incredible.

I have a young family member with serious OCD and I also figured out that when he's having one of his worst OCD episodes, I can make him take off his socks & shoes and stand in the grass and he will calm down.  But in the winter, that's not so feasible.  So I'm getting some grounding products to try it ""indoors"" (many of the starter kits seem to come with the book and/or movie, actually).  I didn't get how it could work from indoors until I saw the movie...duh, the 3rd prong on any electrical outlet is ""grounded"" into the earth and that's how these things work.  is it truly the same as being outside in nature?

6031085,5,B00FTE5R4G,"The AMA & Pharmaceutical America  verses Mother Earth / Returning to our roots - pun intended.

This is a great documentary that bridges sensitive topics in a clear and concise manner. Does corporate America want to keep you as a subscriber to the endless renewal of harmful prescription drugs and practices or not?

There are two sides:
Most will argue that this is a lunatic-fringe movie produced by under-informed zealots who feature quacks and charlatans.
Others will give witness to their specific recovery harvested from the nurturing powers of Mother Earth. This is a direct contradiction of popular believes of western civilization.

The most significant gain in heath around the planet can be linked to two things:
Refrigeration of foods
Better personal hygiene mandating that people wash their hands before touching food.

There is a lot at state for the future of humanity in this decade. To paraphrase astronaut Charlie Duke about the future - if we don't get there together we don't get there at all. That pretty much sums it up in a nutshell.

IF YOU QUESTION the value of all the drugs which by law must state in their commercials - the potential of death, cancer, suicidal tendencies, and a host of other side-affects then you might want to glean something from this movie. IF YOU STILL THINK there is no such thing as global warming and believe what the AMA & Pharmaceutical America is selling you, then you probably will not. When it all comes down to it - the choice is yours. Having more information allows you to make better choices.

With a few exceptions - You cannot get cancer from walking barefoot on the earth. But who's going to make any huge profits from telling you to take your shoes off and go for a walk in the park? Again, the choice is yours. E = MC

6031087,3,B00FTE5R4G,"I was disappointed in this film.  I heard about Grounding and watched some YouTube videos that intrigued me mainly because I have a long history of chronic pain and autoimmune disease that I have managed to recover from through diet and many other healthy lifestyle changes.  I live in NYC and have always been sensitive to EMF pollution, light, sound, and stress of the city.  I have always loved nature and try to spend as much time in nature as possible.  I have noticed that while in the wilderness or on the beach, I love being skin-to-dirt and feel much better for it.  So the ""Earthing"" movement appeals to me.  And I loved Kroschel's ""Dying to have Known"" film.  So I was eager to watch this, and really did a hyped up sell job to get my 87 year old mother to watch it with me.  I am glad I didn't ask anyone else.  I felt it was poorly done, and definitely not up to ""National Geographic"" standards, as the filmmaker refers to himself.  The camerawork is bouncy, and there are too many shots that are irrelevant to the film.  Poor editing choices.  Not enough specifics.  He gives credit to the people who originated the ""Grounding"" theories, but does not explain how or why it works.  That is a key selling point in this country, IMO.  And I don't understand why he kept harping on the importance of astronauts.  This type of mish-mash movie does not help alternative healing methods and reduces credibility.  Yes, Dr. Mercola has a certain amount of visibility, and I'm not surprised that he likes grounding, but he also didn't say enough about it in a convincing way.  It jumped around too much with the baby moose, and his son & girlfriend -- it became distracting.  A friend of mine loaned me this movie because she got it with an earthing sheet.  She loves the sheet, and I might buy one, but I would not waste my money on this movie, that's for sure.

6031131,2,B00FTE5R4G,It's way too long repeating the same point over and over that this is a life changing idea/modality. But they don't give the viewer a way to try it themselves.

6031132,3,B00FTE5R4G,The movie had some really good information and some good parts but it seemed very disjointed for me and also they talk about what they used for the town in Alaska but never showed what exactly they were using or where to find them if the customer wanted to get some for themselves.

6031134,5,B00FTE5R4G,"Low cost documentary that introduces the concept of grounding for various health issues.  The producer walks the talk and grounds himself using various methods. My wife and I thought it worth trying and have seen benefits in sleeping and reduction of inflammatory type (muscle soreness, arthritis) issues.  An excellent film to introduce you to the concepts and some of the research that has been done.  The theory makes some sense, we are surrounded now by many more electrical energy sources that ever before and we don't touch the earth as often any more.  While they don't portray this as a ""cure all"" for any ailment, there definitely is something here.",1386720000,2,658,4.954545454545454

6031137,5,B00FTE5R4G,5 of 5 stars. I was blown away when I first viewed this documentary. Everything in it makes perfect sense and I plan to try this theory to see if it will help with the pain and inflammation of my back dur to disk degeneration and some osteoporosis.

6031141,4,B00FTE5R4G,"I watched this last night, and enjoyed watching it. I didn't need to be convinced, because I have already been sleeping on a grounding sheet for over 2 years. It was a powerful reminder of the benefits of grounding though. I liked the build up to the 30 year paraplegic who could barely twitch his toe before grounding, and then showing him walk with a walker after a so called ""debunker"" said he was not aware of any evidence that grounding has any effect on the human body. The bottom line is grounding works. The movie shows the simple experiments on plants and flowers which anyone could duplicate if they care. But the real benefit is of course how it helps people and animals get rid of pain, sleep better, stop snoring and improve their overall health by putting out the fires of inflammation in the body. Minus 1 star because I felt they went off a little with Stonehenge and other ancient artifacts, that to me have little bearing on the subject.",1385683200,3,955,4.526011560693641

8618539,5,B00FTE5R4G,"My spouse said I should find this movie and watch it.
Being a skeptic, my first thought was, ""BS"".
However, watching the movie intrigued me.
Since the concept is very simple, I decided to give it a try, if nothing else, to see if was actually BS.
Off to my workshop.
I'll explain what I did in case anyone else wants to try.
I took an old computer power cord about 6 ft long, cut off the end that connects to the computer, cut about 5 inches of the outer jacket off, exposing the 3 conductor wires inside.
I cut the black (normally hot) wire off even with the jacket.
I cut the white wire about an inch longer than the black. This prevents the cut end of the hot black wire from possibly contacting the cut end of the neutral white wire.
This left about 5 inches of the green (ground) wire sticking out of the jacket.
I then stripped about 1/2 inch of the green wire insulation off the end, exposing the copper conductor.
Next, I soldered about 4 ft of a single 18 ga stranded copper automotive wire to the green ground conductor on the power cord.
This makes my earthing wire about 10 ft total.
I then soldered about a 12 in bare 14 ga solid copper wire (house wiring) to the end of the automotive wire.
My plan was to wrap the bare solid conductor around my ankle while sleeping.
The solid 14 ga wire will easily bend and retain it's shape, while pulling off my ankle if I get up and forget to remove it.
I then covered the black, white wire cut ends and solder joints with heat shrink.
The heat shrink makes the job look neater, ads an extra margin of safety and covers the exposed solder.
So, I have almost nothing invested in my ""earthing"" wire except for a few minutes of my time and some leftover parts from my shop.

I plugged my earthing wire, Checked it with my MASTECH  MS8209 multi meter to make sure it was grounded and not somehow ""hot"".
Wrapped the solid copper wire around my bare ankle and went to bed.

My best nights sleep in many years!!! (I'm on the far side of 60)
I woke up less to change positions, and fell back to sleep very quickly when I did.
I snored much less, according to my spouse, and when I did snore, it was quieter.
I woke with less aches and pains, less stiffness.
I actually slept longer. I usually only get about a good solid 4 hours then I wake and it is very hard to go back to sleep, so I get up for a couple of hours until I get drowsy and try to go back to sleep.
Grounded, I slept for almost a solid 6 hours, got up to go pee, and then was able to go back to sleep again!

Now, about a month later and I'm no longer a skeptic.
I've built more earthing cords so we both now sleep grounded and are grounded while sitting watching movies or reading.
My spouse also sleeps better and just feels better in general.
She suffers from chronic joint pain. Sleep for her involved tossing and turning until finally falling asleep.
After grounding, she describes a feeling of her muscles relaxing, and allowing her to fall asleep much easier.
She also reports being able to fall back to sleep much easier after waking.
She also snores less :)

I've changed my earthing system a little.
The cord: by removing the solid copper wire at the end, replacing it with an alligator clip.
I purchased about $30 worth of copper/nickle conductive fabric and made some conductive bands that wrap around my ankle or wrist and then hold it in place with the alligator clip.
The bands work great and are more comfortable than the solid wire.

Grounding may not work well for everyone,( few things do ), but I say try it and see for yourself.
I'm convinced it has changed my life for the better :)",1479945600,3,3614,4.253275109170306
