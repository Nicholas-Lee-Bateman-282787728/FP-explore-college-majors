2654314,5,B000IB16KO,This is a major break through for me in watercolor.  I've learned so much on how to control the medium and I'm completely comfortable for the first time ever in watercolor.  Great instructions.  If you want a technique that is realistic but definitely a piece of artwork buy this DVD and paint your heart out.  Happy painting one and all.,1215734400,14,338,4.583333333333333
2654315,5,B000IB16KO,"I thought this was a great DVD,she explains her techniques very well. As a beginner I felt that I got a lot out of it. After watching it a couple of times I did the apple study and was amazed at my results.

2654316,5,B000IB16KO,"I have watched this DVD several times - very well done, Susan explains the process with great detail.",1186876800,10,101,4.666666666666667
2654317,5,B000IB16KO,"This is a great DVD Set (of 2 DVD's).  The artist, Ms. Susan Harrison-Tustain, clearly explains the reasons for doing every step (like stretching the paper and priming the area to be painted with water, etc.), and demonstrates her techniques explicitly without hiding anything as trade secrets, which shows that she is a genuine master painter.  A beginner can learn a lot from this DVD than reading from many books.  The difficult thing in watercolor is to correct mistakes.  She explains how to avoid mistakes in the first place and also shows how to correct mistakes like hard edges.  I thank her for creating this DVD Set.",1183593600,32,626,4.813084112149533
2654318,5,B000IB16KO,I paint with Acrylics and hadn't tried watercolor...This was a great book to aid me in trying watercolor...It also has such beautiful pictures and I enjoyed seeing...,1399248000,,166,5.185185185185185
2654319,5,B000IB16KO,I have been watching these videos. They are very well done. I have watched them several times and I learn more every time through. She explains things very well. I work for a while and then go back and watch sections of the video again. Then I work some more and repeat the process. This way I am learning more and more and I am becoming more proficient. Susan's instruction is easy enough to be of immediate help. It is also detailed and complex enough to give me a lot to work on in the future as I progress in my abilities.,1375747200,2,526,4.166666666666667
2654320,5,B000IB16KO,"I have learned so much from this video, especially the use of the limited transparent palette and layering techniques.  The simplified palette was a refreshing change of the way I was painting .  Susan's techniques can be applied to any type of painting, not just florals.  She is easy to listen to and follow along, and sticks to her subject, no excess babble.  I will watch this again and again, well worth the price.  Of note, I wish the lighting was better for her presentations, but that is the only slight complaint I have.",1374537600,3,529,4.585106382978723
2654321,5,B000IB16KO,Ms. Tustain's workshop is so easy to follow and so inspiring.  I will continue buying her CD workshops in the future and any waterfolor books that she may have new on the market.  She is a wonderful artist and teacher.,1369353600,,218,4.425
2654322,5,B000IB16KO,I love how Susan stresses the importance of learning how to observe objects to be a better artist. I'm excited to be learning how to achieve richness and depth of color in my painting.,1367712000,,184,4.4411764705882355
2654323,5,B000IB16KO,"I cannot say enough good about Susan and her talents. I love the video and really appreciate how careful she is to take you through each step of the process. For a new watercolor painter or even someone with experience, this is a great investment and exciting video to work with.",1280361600,3,279,4.490196078431373
2654324,5,B000IB16KO,"I am a newcomer to watercolor painting and I couldn't wait to receive my DVD ""Susan Harrison-Tustain's One-on-One Watercolor Workshops. This DVD is so inspiring that I know with plenty of practice I can one day accomplish techniques similiar to Susan's.  The step by step application of paint, the explaination of light and shadows and the saturation of individual colors used to create this masterpiece is so inspirational. The more you watch the DVD you begin to see the importance of each tiny step of adding washes and building them up so that your end result becomes so lifelike that you want to smell the roses.  You will need lots of practice & patience to accomplish these techniques but the continual viewing of the DVD will give you the confidence that you need to take the first step.",1269648000,7,795,4.753623188405797
2654325,5,B000IB16KO,"This woman i s wonderful artist but what makes this dvd special is that she is a wonderful teacher as well. Her dvd collection has helped me take my art to a new level. She is forthcoming about her techniques and her choice of materials. No secrets here... and that is the most important thing in a teaching dvd. She also shares her studio, and her inspirations. This particular dvd is a cherished addition to my collection and I will watch it many times throughout the years.",1266537600,3,476,4.482758620689655
2654326,4,B000IB16KO,"I am trying to find a good application method as I develop my style.  I would love to master the realist style one day, but for now, I will try very hard to emulate Susan's methods.  I would recommend this cd to any intermediate or advanced watercolor artist developing different methods of application.  It shows what can be achieved with a very different method than I was taught when I took my watercolor classes.  Pay close attention to the supplies, especially the use of transparent watercolor.  I have never used them before, so this cd was a revelation.  I loved the finished work that Susan does.  It is almost like magic watching her do her stuff.",1252108800,5,657,4.612068965517241
2654327,5,B000IB16KO,"I purchased Glorious Garden Flowers at the urging of my grandmother to try out watercolor. Ms. Harrison-Tustain's introduction touched me and resonated with me. My style is not loose and abstract - and neither is hers. I enjoy the detail that makes a painting come to life. Ms. Harrison-Tustain's book explained how to create the important detail that makes my watercolors stand out from others. I followed up with her DVD's and have found that her method or instruction of watercolor painting is applicable to all types of subjects. This book will change your way of looking at watercolor washes - making your subjects glow - and it will help you understand the why watercolor works like it does!

I can honestly recommend buying two sets, you will wear out the first watching it over and over again!

Enoy the journey,

8144692,5,B000IB16KO,"I love it and will use it to reinforce my watercolour skills, a great tool.
Still waiting for the Glorious Garden Flowers in Watercolour Book, Please look into it for me, Thank you, Lisa",1518480000,,186,4.5
8144693,5,B000IB16KO,Fabulous can't wait to get started working along with her. Very precise and detailed teacher.,1462233600,,93,5.266666666666667
8144694,1,B000IB16KO,The artist is lovely and talented but don't waste your money if you are a beginner watercolor and are expecting to learn how to paint flowers like Susan. It is a very sketchy DVD and the camera lighting is terrible. She only demonstrates part of a flower and it didn't enable me to learn how to paint a flower on my own. I am so disappointed. I have watched and learned from many tutorials since I began in October (I belong to artist network TV which has wonderful watercolor tutorials)  and this was the most disappointing and the most expensive! I feel like I wasted my $54 Christmas money...down the drain! so disappointing. I had such high expectations because I am such a fan of hers. I am going to contact Amazon and find out if it is too late return. . I wished I had watched it sooner so I could have returned it.,1455408000,4,822,4.303225806451613
8144695,5,B000IB16KO,There is a lot of good information in this DVD I am glad I bought it.,1445212800,,69,3.375
8144696,5,B000IB16KO,I am a beginner painter - so for what it is worth - I love these DVDs.  Ms. Harrison-Tustain is very thorough in her teaching.  Ms. Harrison-Tustain actually TEACHES you how to paint.  I have purchased other DVDs that were a total waste of time because they treat you as if you were a first grader and you learn nothing.  Ms. H-T walks you through from start to finish with lots of tips along the way.  It is not for children learning to paint though - it is for adults. Hope that helps.,1437264000,2,487,4.193548387096774
8144697,4,B000IB16KO,"This is a very expensive DVD set but it's worth supporting such a great teacher, and frankly compared to what it would cost to take a watercolor class in person it's a good deal.  My wife found out about Susan from a youtube video and was instantly hooked.  Can't wait to see how she improves with Susan's help!  I'll update this review in a year or so.",1431907200,,353,4.2388059701492535
8144698,5,B000IB16KO,One of the best videos on watercolor I've ever seen. I look forward to buying more of her videos.,1426636800,,97,4.157894736842105
8144699,5,B000IB16KO,"Beautiful with gorgeous details. A must watch on both of the DVDs that come with this One-on-one instruction. It is a long and intense process to achieve the level of quality that the artist delivers, but well worth it for the depth of beauty. Even for the novice watercolorist, this is very helpful to develop new techniques.",1424736000,,326,4.7368421052631575
8144700,5,B000IB16KO,"I have searched far and wide for the best art instruction, and finding Susan Harrison-Tustain's DVD's was truly a breakthrough for me and my painting.  This one is exceptional.  As an artist who paints in watercolor - concentrating heavily on florals - I couldn't ask for a better DVD to provide instruction. hints and tips as well as the opportunity to follow along on a floral study.
This highly rated DVD 2 disc set with over 3 and a half hours of instruction is a MUST HAVE for watercolor artists. This is a compilation of Susan Harrison-Tustain's two best selling Videos: ""Glorious Garden Flowers in Watercolor"" and ""Watercolor Breakthroughs"". In it, Susan talks about materials, preparation techniques as well as Susan's own unique ""priming method"" to achieve the glowing, realistic looking results she achieves in her paintings.  She holds nothing back! There is a practice study to learn the basic methods, and then a floral study where these methods are applied in great detail on a rose study. The ""Watercolor Breakthroughs"", (2nd DVD) demonstrates how to achieve various surface textures, watercolor rescue tips, background approaches, as well as other elements such as dewdrops and the velvety texture of a red rose petal. Both contain Highly detailed instruction at a pace where the viewer could easily follow along.

I have also reviewed two other videos of Susan's, as I have all that she has produced.  At the risk of repeating myself too much - I do want buyers to know that if you are looking for ways to find an ""edge"" in your watercolor paintings - to be able to render realistic florals, surfaces, textures, backgrounds in your studies, this truly is one of the best videos out there. I have watched many and enjoy the methods of several artists, but I do feel Susan's stand leaps and bounds above the others for a couple of reasons. Her teaching style is patient, thorough and highly detailed. Essentially, she shares exactly what she does - and it can be difficult to find an artist with this level of transparency about their working methods. Her DVDs (all three of them essentially) have honestly advanced my painting skills by years. The work I am able to produce by applying these methods look as if I have been painting much longer than I actually have!

I have also come to understand that Susan will be coming out with a new DVD very soon called ""Watercolor Masterclass"". I believe this is going to be the first in a series of DVDs which will go even deeper into the subjects of crucial elements of a successful painting, how to paint life like leaves and mixing vibrant greens. All challenging subjects in their own right. I can't wait for this one to come out (I imagine it, too, will be available here on Amazon) and after I watch it, I will be sure to post my review here.

Beginners will start off with good habits, and intermediate or advanced artists will further extend their skills. Much to learn here!  I have come to understand that Susan has sold over 25,000 DVD's, and that her exhibitions in New Zealand are highly anticipated events.  I am not surprised!",1404345600,3,3099,4.745353159851301
8144701,5,B000IB16KO,"I really needed a tutorial with this kind of close up study, her voice is soothing, she is an excellent teacher, and I really feel the money was well spent, and will be ordering her other dvd's in the future.",1400371200,,208,4.225
