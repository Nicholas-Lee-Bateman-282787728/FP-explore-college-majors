This particular course is a no nonsense approach to America at war. I went through 2 hours of this course and couldn't wait to see the rest of the course. The General built up each lecture based on our national history very beginnings of Pre America as we know her today. The General takes you though the different phases of our military operations. It is not like sitting in school as a kid.. The General has been through countless situations in his 30 plus years. He has been there and experienced it first had. That's what makes this course powerful. All his sources and references are  up-to-date, concise and very clear. The viewer of this course will to know things that very few people, other than military people would understand.

This course will give the viewer a better understanding and perspective on warfare as a whole.  Any viewer that has family members in the servces will also better understand whats going on in a bigger scale. It goes beyond understanding what warfare (fighting)  but also every aspect of finance, economics, culture,  politics, and government diplomacy which comes into play. Highly recommend this course for anyone interested in what goes on. General Clark -  Thank you with all my heart - for your knowledge, wisdom, experience and training, I salute you SIR!!!",1519603200,,1578,4.865671641791045
