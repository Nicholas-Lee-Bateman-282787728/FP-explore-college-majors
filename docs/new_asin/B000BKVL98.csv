8088317,1,B000BKVL98,"There's no such thing as ""Roswell"". In fact, not even the town of Roswell seem to exist. It certainly doesn't show up on my map of New Hampshire. The so-called UFO crash in Roswell was a BARN OWL. I mean, that should be obvious. It flew. So do owls. It crashed. So do owls. It scared the living daylights out of some rednecks. So do owls. The ""alien bodies"" retrieved were also owls. I mean, look at the eyes. They are big, green and glow at night. Just like the eyes of the New Hampshire subspecies of Barnie Owl. Case closed. The so-called Patterson-Gimli movie of the JFK assassination also shows a Barn Owl. So why did the federal gov classify the Roswell barn owl crash? The explanation is obvious: the anti-owl faction of the East Coast establishment wants to repeal the Endangered Species Act. They hate owls. Don't ask me why.",1351209600,2,834,4.493421052631579
8088318,1,B000BKVL98,"Don't waste your time on this over-hyped DVD.  I really expected something with more intelligence and integrity coming from the History Channel.  Basically, one witness was revealed, his story was either bogus or proved to be a dead-end.  End of story as far as this History Channel DVD goes.  They concluded Roswell was a hoax based on one person's testimony.  Very poorly done.  Whether you believe or not, the point is this was very shoddy work and not worth the money or time.  Next time, I'll pay more attention to how other viewers have rated items.  Look for more credible investigators/scientists to explore both sides of the story in an intelligent fashion.  I wasn't looking for an answer as to whether or not
Roswell really was the site of a UFO crash, but was at least hoping to garner some new details and probably create some more questions and  theories of my own.  This DVD provided none of that.  Shame on the History Channel--this was just a money-grab.",1323820800,2,971,4.714285714285714
8088319,1,B000BKVL98,"The History Channel puts out basic propogandist disinformation!  I give this and all other of their so-called research films ZERO STARS!*  My experience while watching History Channel specials causes me grave concern for American logic.  They contradict themselves repeatedly,skip over and omit critical evidence and use illogical sequences in order to mimic true scientific evaluation.  The greatest damage this theatrical troop produces, happens when they use phsycological word tricks aimed mainly at the 'Judge Judy' fan-base.....  *NOTE I wasn't given the choice of zero stars by Amazon!",1235088000,16,592,5.758620689655173
8088320,5,B000BKVL98,"I wanted to find more info on this subject, but didn't want anything weird. I found this dvd to be very intelligent. It presented the information in a very objective manner, which I liked, and I did learn a lot.",1233187200,5,211,4.3
