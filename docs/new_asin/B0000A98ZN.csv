1904001,1,B0000A98ZN,"From the box cover & the rating, this movie would appear to be a party movie that takes place @ a Colorado ski resort.  Well, it does take place in Colorado, but that's where the veracity of the box cover ends.  Despite an ""R"" rating for sexuality, this was a ""PG"" film at best.  While there are some hot babes in the film, there is absolutely no nudity in it - zilch.  If, like me, you're enticed to buy this DVD based on the provacative girl on the cover, I would urge you to look elsewhere.

As for the story itself, well......I just found it boring.  It's not really a comedy as the only funny scene is at the beginning when the Duke grad finds out there aren't any Wall Street jobs available for him.  Meanwhile, he owes Duke university $250,000 for tuition.  Bummer!  At that point I thought the film was going to be what I thought it was, but the rest of it was basically just a lame soap opera.",1225238400,4,902,4.1976744186046515
1904002,1,B0000A98ZN,The characters are so dull. The acting is mediocre and the theme is so predictable that I would prefer to watch HOmer Simpson.,1151020800,,126,4.521739130434782
1904003,2,B0000A98ZN,"Although ""deleted scenes"" are promised on the back cover of the box, there are no deleted scenes on the DVD. Instead there's a perfunctory ""documentary"" which interviews the cast and other creators, who recite a common litany of how much fun it was to make the film. In this short segment there are a very few informal shots of the players that aren't in the film, but there are no deleted scenes in the normal usage of the term. Rather disappointing since the cast in audio commentary talks about seemingly dozens of neat scenes that ""hopefully will be in the DVD deleted scenes section.""

 Also, although the box promises ""2.35 wide screen,"" the film is pan-and-scan and only slightly letterboxed at about a 1.85 to 1 ratio. Some of the scenes are annoying because of the missing portion of the image.

 Also, it's not a gross teen comedy as the box copy suggests, more of a puppy-love romance with the ""four buddies"" comedy stuff as a sidebar. Which makes it potentially better, I guess, but it suffers from a lack of talent, especially in Ventimiglia's acting and in the writing. Very anemic; not much here. In the key scenes the players just hem and haw, since they're not given much to say. Kevin Kirkpatrick, in a small part, is way beyond the rest of the cast in acting sophistication. He draws a very perceptive portrait; extremely funny, but not a typical caricature, the most real character in the movie.",1129075200,4,1415,4.670682730923695
1904004,1,B0000A98ZN,"there is no actualy snowboarding or skiing, its a boring chick flick with a ranting sissy main character",1127865600,5,104,4.833333333333333
1904005,3,B0000A98ZN,"You would think that this movie is a really cheesy teen flick with gratuitous nude scenes and absolutely no story.  Just look at the horrible box cover . . . it does no justice to what the movie really tries to cover: growing up, friendship, and love.

I just saw this movie for the first time the other day.  I was expecting it to be a horrid piece of junk, but the movie completely surprised me.  At best, critics will give it a B-/C+ (which is good considering that it's intended audience is the same people who love the American Pie movies).

The story?  It's about a group of friends from Aspen who are moving on with their lives after college.  Honestly, it's everything American Pie 2 wasn't but SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

Another good thing is that most teen-flick or WB watchers will recognize most of the cast.  Although their acting isn't memorable, they do a fine job representing a typical group of guys and gals after college.

Overall, I was quite pleased with the movie.  I didn't see it on DVD, so I can't comment on any special features or anything.  But strictly about the movie, you'll have a good time watching this with your buddies or gals.  Although it's far from being a really great film, it does stand out among the newer (2000-2005) teenage or young adult releases.",1106611200,13,1285,4.510822510822511
1904006,1,B0000A98ZN,"I am not kidding. This matt kid spends the entire time
saying all the philosophy stuff that doesn't apply.
the hot chick is actaully not as hot as the side kick.
the jokes were lame and I thought they filmed it on the first shot everytime. it was very predictable and maybe worth watching
just because it is terrible.",1085443200,3,317,4.389830508474576
1904007,3,B0000A98ZN,The movie was pretty good.  However the soundtrack is awesome.  I have been going to see Bottle of Justus play for the past 5 years.  They are awesome guys with an awesome band.  I am so happy to see how far they have come.  I encourage everyone to go out and buy their CD's.,1083196800,6,275,4.018518518518518
1904008,5,B0000A98ZN,"I thought this movie was hilarious. It had loads of laughs when the four friends get together, and when the girls come in they create two cute love stories. It's a story about what we know we have to do after graduation, and the fear that we might choose the wrong path. In the end the movie shows that along with friendship, laughs, and love, the path is easy to find, if you follow you heart. This movie is definitely a must see.",1078444800,7,431,4.204819277108434
1904009,5,B0000A98ZN,"Winter Break is very entertaining. Funny and warm, I'll probably be watching it all winter. Seriously!",1062806400,3,102,5.4375
7996264,5,B0000A98ZN,"I enjoyed it. It's about the tension between following a sensible life plan vs. honoring the non-sensible things you find yourself irresistibly and inexplicably drawn to.

I liked the characters, the ski footage, the night hike to ski under full moon, and the reminders of how it felt to be among like minded lovers of the mountains who valued experiencing life as opposed to making themselves fit into a life plan that was the wrong shape for them.

The movie reminded me a lot of the camaraderie I experienced working at an amazing mountain in Wyoming many winters ago. The movie is funny, the romance feels genuine and believable, and some of the details are really well executed.

***The cover picture does not represent the movie. There is no blonde with cleavage skiing in a red bra. Check out another movie if that's what you're looking for.",1523232000,,848,4.755102040816326

7996266,1,B0000A98ZN,"This movie was terrible. I'm not gonna lie, I watched this for Milo, but even THAT wasn't enough for me to finish it halfway and I had to watch another movie that would help me to uncringe myself- yes that is a thing. Sounds like the writer and director were at their wits end trying to keep up The whole Early 2000sAmericanPie/VanWilder/BeerFest tradition. Filled with cringe worthy puns and sex jokes that were so bad it made my JuniorHigh classmates sex jokes seem almost Shakespearean. It had one of the guys from American Pie in it I forgot his name but in American Pie he was the one that slept with Stifflers mom- let's just say after this film I'm glad his acting career is permanently over. It takes a comedic genius to play off Obnoxious and funny and baby he ain't got it. It got to a point where I could tell that the other actors were laughing at his jokes and ""charisma"" just screaming ""god let me get this paycheck!"" I'm surprised they were all still friends with him.

The story itself took a complete turn that I wasn't expecting which was a guy learning about his post grad future of endless debt talking to his counselor (who was honestly the funniest thing in the whole movie), and what better way to escape student loans and completely blow off your potentially privileged  money making uncles diamond store than to run away to the snow covered hills getting hammered drunk and objectifying blondes. The director did have a very obvious HitchcockComplex for blondes since they were the only women that existed in THIS movies planet.",1479945600,,1553,4.6231884057971016

7996269,1,B0000A98ZN,This would not play. We tried several times and movie would not play. Hoping to get refund eventually. This rating is minus one star.,1460073600,,133,4.583333333333333
7996270,3,B0000A98ZN,"Matt (Milo Ventimiglia) has just graduated college. Time to join the work force and be an adult, right? Not! His best friend, Peter (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and wild school buddies convince him to winter in Aspen instead. Matt falls in love with Michelle (Maggie Lawson) and must decide between money and career or following his heart. That is the story, I amended it because the description had the word "" hilarious"" in it and it WAS NOT. If this was supposed to be some kind of Rom-com, it fell way short. It was cute and that is the bet I will go. The cast was wonderful and I am a huge Milo fan, this guy never got the recognition or he just made bad choices, but I like him. There is nothing special about the story. but it is a sweet little movie with the standard characters. I didn't love it but didn't hate it either, so if you have some time to kill it is seriously ....okay.",1459209600,,880,4.244047619047619
7996271,2,B0000A98ZN,"Matt (Milo Ventimiglia) has a $179,000 in student loans @ 7.92% and has limited opportunities on Wall Street due to the current layoff. He decides to spend some time in Aspen, Colorado because he doesn't have any money. He gets a job as a kid's ski instructor and meets Michelle (Maggie Lawson) the girl of his dreams and one with a boyfriend in New York, Anne Faris in a minor role.

The film is a comedy romance and was light on both. It s not a teen sex romp either in spite of the girl in the red hot bra on the DVD cover, that is not in the film. There is no real sex or nudity. It is just implied. 2 F-bombs, but there is some PG-13 style sex talk. A very watered down film no matter what you seek...unless it is a watered down romance....you know the one where the guy at the end returns to the girl to confess his undying love. Please, take your own life if you thought that was a plot spoiler.

7996272,4,B0000A98ZN,Great Movie! It was funny and heartfelt. Excellent acting by Milo Ventimiglia and the entire cast.,1410825600,,98,5.1875
7996273,2,B0000A98ZN,"I'm sure it was a funny movie. Luckily I didn't have to pay for it because I didn't even finish the movie. I'm thinking the screenwriter has some bone to pick with Buffalo, NY. That's the crux of the movie, the main character, in order to start paying off his student loans after college, has to take a menial job at his uncle's business in the northern most, snow filled city of America, Buffalo, NY. Nearly in Canada as the main character's ex girlfriend put it succintly. Meanwhile, it's December 30th, 2011, right now and we've barely gotten an inch of snow here. Which sucks because my nephews wanted to go sledding.

Anyways, I didn't really appreciate the cheap shots at my city. It would have been funny one or two times.",1325203200,3,729,4.5227272727272725
