8125633,4,B000FQJAWI,"Camarillo is the man.  Great material and organized intelligently.  I started applying his concepts right away, and it improved my judo for bjj right away.  The goofy spy theme was a little too silly for me.  That's the only downside, which is easy to move past.",1494633600,,262,4.630434782608695
8125634,5,B000FQJAWI,"I loved this set. It has a lot of advanced material and not all of the stuff on it is actually useful for me. The flying attacks are way too advanced. That said some of the submissions and the counters, and his technique for teaching throws is incredible. Some of the foot sweep counters he showed are really cool and I feel they should be very useful for me in practice. I loved some of the foot sweeps (from the side) he showed and also the counters to those. I should also mention that Dave's book guerrilla jiu jitsu was incredible and I used it as one of my main inspirations back when I was devoted to training and to improving my jiu jitsu. I would rate this set as well the Saulo Ribeiro set as the best jiu jitsu instructionals on the market. Dave teaches as well as Saulo Ribeiro in my opinion. Furthermore these instructional's are very interesting to watch, unlike the ultra boring to tears, instructionals from groundfighter.com, like say Marcelo Garcia's submission grappling series. My favorite disc is probably disc one: secrets of the judoka. This disc contains many incredible takedowns. I have never really learned many efficient takedowns at my jiu jitsu school and this dvd fills that gap quite well I believe. Most jiu jitsu fighters have poor Judo ability in my opinion (other than of course Helio Gracie who seemed to have excellent Judo skill). Even Marcelo Garcia said that he relies on wrestling to get the fight to the mat (i.e the bread and butter of his takedowns game is single and double leg takedowns). My only complaint is that the camerawork is pretty bad. The cameraman tried too hard to focus on the picture at certain critical moments, but that just made the picture blurry. Of all the instructionals I own (which may be around a dozen, if not more) this has the worst camerawork by far. The material is great, the camerawork isn't.",1361836800,,1870,4.618618618618618
8125635,5,B000FQJAWI,"This is a must have dvd; if you are a true judo or jiu jitsu student. It will improve you game and skill. This dvd opens your eyes to options that you didn't think possible within techniques, with quick transition between moves made simple through Dave Camarillo's instructions and demos.",1162857600,4,288,4.78
