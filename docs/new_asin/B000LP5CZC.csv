The veterans share heartfelt, intense stories that I believe are usually kept bottled up inside. The cinematography and audio are top-notch: not only was our crew very professional (the cinematographer travels the world working on projects for NOVA and National Geographic, among others) but they were a great source of support. What you don't see off camera--after we left the cemetery, in an emotional point in the documentary--are the group of us joking around with a bunch of local kids, who had very little in terms of material possessions, but were so full of joy and jokes that our tears quickly turned to laughter. And the countryside--absolutely beautiful. In many ways it's the land and the people of Vietnam who star in this documentary, though to see children who are still suffering from the hardships of war (particularly in birth defects believed to be related to Agent Orange) is heartbreaking. But it's reality, unfortunately, and many people like the Friends of Danang are doing what they can to help heal those wounds of war. If you, like me, grew up in the 70s and 80s learning absolutely nothing about the Vietnam War (or about the country, or the people) because it was not discussed in school--watch this. You'll learn a lot.",1290384000,,1393,4.906779661016949

If you are interested in the Vietnam Conflict..especially the humanitarian side of things..this program is for you. It basically centers around a group of veterans (HEROES IN MY EYES)and others..such as a special young lady who lost her father when she was a baby...with a camera following them during their journey through Vietnam. I am glad I watched this program..and recommend you google the ""Friends of Danang"" and check out their website...I am sure they can use our support",1194739200,,632,4.861111111111111
