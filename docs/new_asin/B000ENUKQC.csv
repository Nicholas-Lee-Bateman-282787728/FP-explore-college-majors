8111824,4,B000ENUKQC,"Redwall always has a charm to it with its characters and atmosphere, so it's a delight that the second season's faithful enough to make the most of it. Nice locations, appealing character designs with a variety of species, the bad guys can be as unique as the good guys. Aside from Tim Curry's wonderful performance as the villain Slagar, the voice acting was better than I expected, entertaining and believable. That helps immersion with the more serious moments, of which there's many, and I consider the book it's based off of to be one of the stronger books in the series. It's worth watching along with Season 3, and I wish the show had never ended.",1371772800,,654,4.646551724137931
8111825,5,B000ENUKQC,"Excellent! Very hard to find season 2 of Redwall.
I think that viewers both young and old will find
something to like here.  The video itelf is over 200
minutes in total, so this might be something to
watch over several cold winter's nights.",1292889600,,241,4.4772727272727275
8111826,5,B000ENUKQC,"For those of you who have read the first novel in the ""Redwall"" series or seen the first season on television, you'll probably enjoy this season even more.  Matthias, the young hero of Redwall, is grown now and has a child of his own named Mattimeo.

""Mattimeo:A Tale of Redwall"", a direct sequel to the original ""Redwall"" story, focuses on Matthias's quest to save the children of the abbey.  The children were kidnapped by the villainous slave trader, Slagar the Cruel (voiced by Tim Curry), who is out for revenge against Matthias.
Along the way, Matthias rejoins some old friends and makes some new ones.

If you enjoyed the first season of Redwall, you will definitely like Mattimeo, a great work of family-oriented entertainment.",1207094400,2,735,4.903225806451613
8111827,5,B000ENUKQC,Still as good as the first season and still lovable with more to love,1168819200,,69,4.0
8111828,4,B000ENUKQC,Being a fan of fantasy can limit a reader or movie goer greatly. I found the books by Mr. Jacques to be entertaining to say the least. The younger generation will find the animated movie made from his work on Mattimeo enjoyable to watch and entertaining to boot. The artwork is good stoy line follows the novel and the characters are all very well developed. Though the DVD is expensive it would give a family at least two nights of enjoyable watching.,1168300800,,452,4.524390243902439
8111829,5,B000ENUKQC,"This is a fairly good adaptation of the Redwall series of books (edited slightly from the books, mainly to remove some more gruesome scenes). This DVD isn't for young children as there are some characters killed in the series (though most deaths are off-screen).

Also the technical specs listed for this DVD are incorrect. Currently the page lists that the DVD comes in English and Japanese and is closed-captioned. This is not true. The two DVDs are English only and there are no subtitles or closed-captions on either disk.",1154390400,,526,4.910112359550562
