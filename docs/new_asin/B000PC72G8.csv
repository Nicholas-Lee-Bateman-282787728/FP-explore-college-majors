The plot was well -- mundane, a RUB Lawyer rides his bike along with his buddy on the weekends. They stop off at biker bars and strip clubs to hang with real bikers.

The buddy leaves with one of the strippers and the next morning, our Rub Lawyer learns his buddy has been killed and suddenly now a bike club believe he knows the whereabouts of a package that was stolen from them.

As you can guess, there are others who also seek the package and if our Rub does not come up with the goods his duaghter dies.

The Copy I bought from AMAZON is titled 'Screaming Metal' still the same film. Either way it is an independant low budget film with less than stellar acting performances.

The movie is remeniscent of the Drive In days. The writer/actor/
director/producer/set builder/ what ever else is listed at the end in the credits. Did however come up with some good music for the sound track The band ITHICA is pretty good.

If your looking for an Oscar winner you won't find it here but if you want an hour and a half of escape with some nice bikes this is for you.",1265155200,2,1141,4.235023041474655
