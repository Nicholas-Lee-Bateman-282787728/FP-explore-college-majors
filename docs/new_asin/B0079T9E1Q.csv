Composer/Conductor Maestro Alexander Prior's score is nothing short of being a well written descriptive musical event. The choreography of Natalia Kasatkina and Vladimir Vasiliev (infamous Bolshoi Ballet artists), along with the sets and costumes are nothing short of breathtaking! Producer/Director Clemente D'Alessio has taken all of the these elements and has captured the spirit of what was and is a very special event that is not to be missed.

This DVD is not only a pleasing performance, but is also very appropriate video for children of all ages to watch as well.  The younger child would be attracted to the magic woven by the vivid colors, music and dance.  The older child/student would be intrigued as well, but would also find the story of young composer/conductor Alexander Prior a source of inspiration and motivation.

Mowgli is definitely an experience for all!",1332115200,8,1121,5.037837837837838
