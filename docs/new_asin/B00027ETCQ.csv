8023293,2,B00027ETCQ,"I heard so many bad reviews of this movie, and I frankly ignored them because I love Sam Neill movies.  So, I purchased it anyway hoping for a dark and passionate romance flick, and instead I watched one of the most boring, dissatisfying and bizarre movies I have ever spent two hours on.
The movie starts off with this handsome, enigmatic stranger (Sam Neill) who has some kind of obsession with this woman (Rachael Blake), and after charming her onto his boat, he takes her to this secluded shack where he grooms her to be his love forever or something.  The exciting and dangerous love thing that I was looking to get a thrill from doesn't last even to halfway through the movie when she kills him...and he dies. And then she stuffs him in a freezer along with the frozen peas, etc, and he ""comes back"".  The rest of the movie is spent with her chopping fire wood, staring at the sea and occasionally talking to a frozen dead guy.
I can forgive Sam for this movie, but I saw the film and one time was enough.  I will look for my Sam Neill fix elsewhere.",1525046400,,1056,4.345177664974619

8023295,1,B00027ETCQ,"Tries to be: love story, mystery, adventure, supernatural. Fails at all. Long, slow, boring. Almost saved by good casting/acting, but face it: this flick is a mangy mongrel dog.",1483574400,,177,5.137931034482759
