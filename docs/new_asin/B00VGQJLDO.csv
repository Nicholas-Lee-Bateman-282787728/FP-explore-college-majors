I have never liked Television this much",1436832000,,75,5.333333333333333
7089383,5,B00VGQJLDO,"I have not purchased yet. However, I have been watching it on AMC. Missing episodes here and there. I am wanting my own copy as soon as possible.

I have Seasons 1 through 4 already.",1429747200,,182,4.2
7089384,2,B00VGQJLDO,"When I first heard about the Walking Dead a few years back, I sort of ignored it. I, however, decided to watch it and was quite impressed with it. I think it was around Season 4, once they got out of the prison and lost some people I liked, I started to grow bored of the series. Lately, I feel as though I am spending 5 minutes out of the 42 some minutes per episode actually enjoying it. For the most part, it just drags on and on and on and on. People talk, slash a few walkers, talk some more, picture is too dark to see, people talk, slash walkers, you get the idea.
And now in Season 5, there are more flash backs which are pointless to see. Are they really trying to stretch a 15 minute idea into 42 minutes per episode?

I liked Season 1. Six episodes, ran a bit smoother, liked a lot of the people. Season five, still with Maggie & Glenn 'rolls eyes' They need to spend their 42 minutes per episode and SPEED IT UP some.

Kill off Maggie, maybe even Glenn, and maybe I will see some more episodes. Most likely, season 5 will be my last season.",1429574400,2,1052,4.0772946859903385
7089385,5,B00VGQJLDO,Amazon should separate these instant videos reviews from dvds. On all tv shows an movies. Helps keep confusion down. The listings are separate reviews need to be too. BTW The Walking Dead Rocks!,1428883200,,194,4.909090909090909

7089388,4,B00VGQJLDO,"The discs come in plastic snap cases. They play fine.

I remember watching the first season of The Walking Dead (2010- ) back in 2010. Id never heard of the show and didn't know anything about it. I was searching for a new favorite show after Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009) ended. The first time I watched The Walking Dead the unexpected blood and gore made me jump off the couch and walk around the living room, pacing and laughing in a defense mechanism sort of way. I was so shocked to see something that graphic on TV.

After I got over my initial shock The Walking Dead became one of my favorite shows, until the fourth or fifth season. I was watching the show to see what characters from the quarry in the first season would survive to the end of the series. I dreamed of how I would end the show if I was in charge of the series. I wanted to see Carl kill Rick, then Daryl kill Carl, then Carol kill Daryl, and then have Carol surrounded and ripped apart by walkers, with Morgan watching from a second story window of a nearby building, muttering I told them to clear. They needed to clear. But that didn't happen and when I heard the shows creators talking about twelve or more seasons I realized there was no planned ending, and then they started spinoff shows like Fear the Walking Dead (2015- ), and I lost all interest in the show and stopped watching the series after season six.

With no planned ending The Walking Dead is just another soap opera that I don't care to follow. There are so many wonderful shows available to binge watch these days. Im not going to waste my time and money on a show that doesnt know where its going. Maybe Ill watch the last episode of the show if the series ever ends to see what characters from the quarry in season one make it to the end. The shows characters initial goal of surviving, established in season one, is what I cared about. I wanted to see what characters from season one survived and if they found a cure for the disease. With those goals muted the series is a ship without a rudder.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1521158400,,3501,4.905405405405405

7089560,4,B00VGQJLDO,"The Walking Dead Season Five in my viewpoint was a very good season but not their best.  This is way I give it a four star rating,  I don't give away hints or spoilers to people about the season because if they want to see it fresh then just buy the DVD season.  The season as a whole had people still alive and well and also people who you find hard to read or figure out what purpose they have for current season or have keep on survive season after season besides main stars.  I enjoy every episode expect one main one which looking back I understand why the wrote it the way they did for overall arch of the season to go to. But based on this season I do ask myself one main question how do the writers make that big choice of who to keep and who to get rid of, that must be the single biggest issue writing the scripts for the tv show season by season.  I have yet to see season six on tv currently, but this was by far a very bloody season and brutal deaths not just walkers but human beings.  So in closing still an amazing season of the show The Walking Dead makes you angry, frustrated, hurt, crying, you basically feel every emotion in this season as in the others but more profund for this season.  Still worth the money for the season and the special features well worth the money of how they do the behind the scenes look at the filming.",1456358400,,1350,4.110266159695818

7089567,5,B00VGQJLDO,"The Walking Dead is one of the best shows on cable (or anywhere). I can't believe I've been watching for going on six years. The show is exciting, exhilerating and scary as hell.

  The world, for all intents and purposes has ended and the few left have banded together (good guys one team and bad guys another) to  find shelter, food and most especially to get away from the zoombies! Now these zommbies are people that have died from the nuclear fallout, starvation, etc but they come back to life and have a good thirst for the humans still alive.

The main group begins with Rick - the hero. He has a son Carl who has grown up much to fast. The story begings with Rick losing his family, in a hospital where no-one is home, is empty and looked like an explosion hit is headfirst. He is alone (he had been shot earlier during his Sheiff duties).  The escape, aided by Glen (you will love this little guy) is tricky, scary and will have you on the edge of your seat. Zombies are everywhere just waiting to tear at anything that is alive.

You see those that have died come back to life and are looking for food in the form of 'people' -and 'ugh' even a poor horse could not escape.

The twists and turns of the show, the writing, the acting, the emotions are beyond belief and one of the few shows that has me yelling at the TV..'NO, STOP, GET AWAY, HURRY, NOOOOO.'' It really is that exciting.

After the show (Sunday at 9PM-AMC-app at Amazon or Xfinity Demand) Chris Hardwick has a 'Talking Dead' show and then all the happenings we just saw are talked about. This week some were (surprise..boo hoo) killed (spoiler) that surprised the hell out of the audience but I guess somebody has to go sometime,

Eventually Rick and his 'family' of odd characters find a prison and settle in for quite awhile until threatened by another band who want shelter, food and the like.

 Many others who have found Rick, some had to be killed, others found to be a great help - the old good guys and bad guys.

Ricks group has moved on from one place to another while the dead are building up to monstrous proportions.  So many  zombies that if Rick and all persons left alive were quadrupled ten times the zombies would consume them all with no trouble.

I love the show and this is one show that has what you
call 'DIE-HARD FANS' and and I do mean DIE-HARD.

Check it out. There are usually marathons on some of the other cable channels. Check the Amazon AMC app or Xfinity demand (though the complete six years isn't there I don't think).

If need be buy the seasons--it's pricey but damn good or you could catch up with the DVD's as I think the price has gone down on many of them.

Either way if you like spooky, scary, adrenaline pumping-YOURS AND THEIRS this is the show that will cover it all-even screaming at the TV..''NO...GO AWAY...DON'T KILL GLEN...NO......''
i'M JUST WAITING FOR MY NEIGHBORS TO TAKE ME AWAY.

BUT; A small warning: This is not a show for kids; the tauma, the killings, the ugly ugly zombies would give them nightmares for years to come.

Do not miss out on this show-it's a winner and I know eventually the 'group of good guys' will be able to reclaim the home they did find shortly before the zombies broke through the gates. This 'community' was built and to Rick's surprise and those of his group they planned to stay there among the citizens who had made somewhat of a life there. Now all this has been threatened - again - by the nasty zombies.  Tune in....

PS: These suckers can only be killed by chopping their heads off...gross.....but so damn real it's hard to think it isn't!!!

7089585,5,B00VGQJLDO,"I was hesitant on watching something called ""The Walking Dead"" because even though I love horror movies I've never ever liked zombie movies. My son told me I would LOVE it and since he talked me into watching a sweet series called ""Breaking Bad"" I thought maybe this kid is on to something! I still doubted I'd like it. I dragged my feet for a few weeks and then I gave in...I was desperate to purge on yet another series, so I thought I'd give it a shot...and again I was hooked! This is tastefully (no pun intended) done with excellent actors- excellent story behind said zombies that makes sense to me. These zombies aren't clawing out of their graves but have a virus that becomes active once they die naturally or not so natural (zombie bite, etc) and the government failed to contain it or is responsible for it in the first place. This will come into light soon after or in first season). Really really love this series, gimme more!",1454112000,,939,4.465116279069767

7089639,5,B00VGQJLDO,"I absolutely love The Walking Dead. I think this was by far my favorite season so far. I don't get to watch the show weekly so I have to impatiently wait for the show to come out on DVD/BluRay. Which may be a good thing as I don't think that I would ever have the patience to wait for a new episode each week.

I finished this season within a few days of it being released on DVD, and I am still in shock! The way this season ended I thought there was going to be another episode after. They left us with such a cliff hanger! I can't wait until season 6 is released!",1449878400,,566,3.9217391304347826

7089643,5,B00VGQJLDO,"LOVE THIS SHOW.  Best show on TV.  I don't usually watch TV anymore because of all the cursing and commercials, but one night when season 1 was on, my husband was watching it and I walked in and asked him what he was watching.  Loving horror, I sat down with the intention of watching out of curiosity but ended up falling in love with the program and have been watching it ever since.  I have the whole series so far.  What I like most is the fact that there is very little, if any, cursing.  Hats off to the writers for that.  Andrew Lincoln and the whole cast are excellent in making a fantasy seem so real.",1449360000,,610,4.162393162393163
7089644,3,B00VGQJLDO,"Quality of the DVD itself? GREAT! Quality of season 5? Eh....
The second half of season 4 was BORING! I love TWD, don't get me wrong, but the second half of season 4 was a snooze-fest for me. Because of this, I was really worried that it wouldn't be able to recover! It did recover a little bit more in this season, but it is still building it's way back. Season 6 just hit it's mid-season finale, and it is AWESOME so far! So don't be discouraged if you don't love season 5, it's just building back up! :)",1449360000,,506,4.121212121212121

7089661,5,B00VGQJLDO,"I am admittedly the biggest Walking Dead fan.  I love the story and all the characters.  Season 5 was so good from start to finish but really had it's sad moments. If you've never watched it, you should.  It's not just about zombies.  Makes you wonder if the stuff ever really hit the fan, what kind of people would be left in the world.",1448323200,,337,4.21875
7089662,3,B00VGQJLDO,"Haven't seen the series in a while and checked it out from the library. I'd forgotten how violent, bloody and disgusting it could be, as walking decomposing corpses are major players this season and stopping them from attempting to eat live players requires violent action be done to their heads, such scenes filmed in all their messy, close-up, glory. After I'd acclimated to that, I found the season episodes okay. Not stellar, not awful, but okay. Some of the zombie kill scenes were abit loud and ""squelchy"" for my taste but I'm middle age and perhaps am just too old an audience for this type of visual violent excess. Acting is great and I like the program's title music/theme. Worth a watch if you like zombie movies but be prepared for extreme blood and gore.",1448323200,,767,4.688888888888889

7089768,1,B00VGQJLDO,"It seems like the characters get dumber and dumber every season. It's a miracle they've survived this long. Why would you spend so much time, money and effort to put together a realistic zombie show and then have people behave like idiots? If you walk into a train tunnel full of zombies, you should die. If you walk into a human abattoir, you should die. IF YOU JUMP INTO A BASEMENT FLOODED WITH BACTERIA-LADEN WATER YOU SHOULD DIE! If not from a zombie bite, then from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). I can suspend disbelief for zombies. I can suspend disbelief for the continued viability of gasoline (although that's a stretch). What I can no longer accept are characters whose motivations change with the wind and do stupid, stupid things and yet still survive.

On another note, it appears that the quality of the DVD is subpar, too. I had two sets of this season and both got scratched the first time I played them.)",1444262400,2,943,4.75

7089775,5,B00VGQJLDO,"Another great season of The Walking Dead.  For me the whole Terminus part that we'd been hanging out to see how it developed since the end of Season 4 was dealt and finished with way too quickly but other than that it was great.  We find out what happened to Beth in this season, a fair bit more about the newer joinees of the group with the mission to get one of them to Washington and of course there are plenty of bad humans along the way.  The actor who played the title character from Everybody Hates Chris (Tyler Williams) plays a survivor in this season too.  Although zombies aren't as big a threat to the group as other survivors there's still a couple of really cool looking ones such as some that were napalmed and stuck to the carpark and have been burnt by the sun in the years since, and another group of zombies who have been trapped in water with their soggy skin hanging off them.  In the extras (Australian version anyway) we see those actors getting zombified and other cool stuff.  Speaking of the extras, there's hours of them, including an analysis of each episode of Season 5.  Can't wait for season 6!",1444176000,,1125,4.405797101449275

7089845,3,B00VGQJLDO,"I bought season 5 a few weeks ago at Target.  It contained 5 discs.  Each episode was clearly marked on each disc.  However, at the end of season 4, the bottom fell out.  The ending was so awkward, it seemed unfinished.  Disc 5 is a total disappointment.  Though it clearly said Season 5--there was no season 5.  The season 5 disc only has featurettes from all the ""previous"" seasons 1-4.  All of which proved to be redundant, uninformative and a total lackluster.  The disc does not have special features or featurettes written on it.  It only says  Season 5, which is totally misleading.  I feel like I have been gypped.  Is there anyone else who has experienced this same problem.  Have I been gypped?  Because, it sure feels like it.  PS: It's bad enough they have one-too-many ""fade to black"" badly cut commercial moments throughout all the episodes.  Now they have Rick acting like some nonsensical mental case on crack-meth from Hell.  He's had melt-downs throughout the show, but they made sense.  It was understandable.  Any who...please share your knowledge of Season Five's disc 5 ""missing"" episodes.",1442880000,2,1111,4.839572192513369

7089866,5,B00VGQJLDO,"This is one of the best TV shows ever made regardless of category! If you like zombie survival horror, you will love this TV series! This is the fifth season in AMC's masterpiece airing on Sunday nights. The ragtag group, now accustomed to being wild amd brutal, are in a town named Terminus but not all is as it seems. Now there might even be a cure for the zombie virus but can they be certain? People from the past seasons that were lost in the fighting turn out to not be dead but are actually alive, surviving hardships, and are not too far behind Rick's group on the road. I do not want to give any spoilers because if you have never seen this TV series, YOU ARE MISSING OUT. Now they meet new people in new towns that are almost as strange and deadly. Some find peace while others are very skeptical. One question they all soon face though is after everything that has happened to them which has battle hardened and toughened them into a pack of wolverines(no Marvel character pun intended) is this: can a wild animal, now called themselves, be domesticated, tamed, and contented? Find out in this VERY graphic, rule breaking, ultra violent TV series in which the censors sweat bricks every time they watch it! This is NOT for children! VERY gory and bloody! Outstanding makeup and props on a level with movie theater quality make this easily one of the best TV shows ever made. This is what Z Nation on SciFi Channel wants to be when or if it ever grows up. Z Nation probably copied The Walking Dead anyway but Walking Dead is ten times better! Z Nation has more comedy and is not movie theater quality level but is not all bad either. If you like survival horror like Resident Evil then this is your type of TV series. Human beings are now in the minority while zombies are ruling the world. Who will survive?",1442275200,,1818,4.413690476190476

7089890,4,B00VGQJLDO,My wife has been waiting for this for a long time. The best thing about watching this on Amazon is the lack of commercialsespecially the non-stop political adds. I can't wait to see this group get to Washington. That's the only place in the country where the zombies will still be talking. I'm pretty sure the people who started the whole thing will probably still be alive in a bunker somewhere.,1441497600,,399,4.633802816901408

7089893,5,B00VGQJLDO,"If you've read my other reviews, you know how I feel about TWD! Outstanding stories and exceptional acting. It isn't horror stories or science fiction with monsters or campy Zombies. The Walking Dead are the HUMAN survivors. And the monsters are the other humans who still exist by their own corruption of civilization! This season has shown this situation exceptionally well.  Watch to find the secret of ""TERMINUS"" and the fate of Rick and the other ""walking dead"" in their exodus. It makes the viewer eager for the debut of season six! That's how I feel...and that's exactly what AMC wants too! Amazon provided this DVD set at exceptional value, saving me almost 50 % off the original price..and it is brand new, not used, first day of issue!",1441411200,,745,4.775193798449612

7089898,4,B00VGQJLDO,"The season started off great with the first episode at Terminus, and in a slow pace sends the story of the group into a well crafted Season. Overall, I liked this season a lot, but did feel certain episodes caused me to feel disjointed and annoyed.but after you watch the whole season, you feel like you have read a well thought out book. For whatever reason, I think some of the casting is a little off, but probably intentional. I don't think that the Priest or Rick's new love interest was casted well.so I am hoping they both get killed off early next season. Not falling in love with the Alexandria community cast, but adjusting accordingly. If it wasn't for the season finale (plus Morgan coming back) wrapping everything up so well.I would have given this season 2 thumbs down, but kudos to the cast and producers for doing a great job.",1441238400,,852,4.6118421052631575

7089901,1,B00VGQJLDO,"So here we are on season 5 of the most popular show on television. Most popular, but definitely not the best. I'm really sick of the same old plot line, season after season. The season begins with our cast of soap opera actors esvaping from cannibal hell hole, Terminus. Now, I won't lie. That was a heck of an episode. But as soon as we get to episide 2, same stuff, different episode. We meet new, shady characters. Can they be trusted? Will the writers waste our time with more crazy Rick? Or how about how when the group arrives in their current ""temporary home"" , everyone seems to shower....but not Darryl! What, will the fan girls riot if Darryl showers, as well? Anyways, most people will still watch this terrible show no matter what I think, right? At least Beth is dead!!!",1441238400,4,783,4.4825174825174825
7089902,5,B00VGQJLDO,The best season yet!,1441238400,,20,4.25
7089903,5,B00VGQJLDO,"I only had the opportunity to watch the first 4 or 5 episodes, since my cable company deleted AMC over their own ignorance. That's fine. I deleted them and am much happier. Now on with the show. We've watched this show from the first episode in my house. It's a bit gross at times. Makes you think a little. Also keeps you guessing what's going to happen. There is always something happening. Nothing ever goes as planned. Carol, Daryl, Rick and the gang keep things moving along. Never a dull moment. If you haven't seen Season 5 (as I have not) this is a perfect way to get caught up on the show. AMC actually knows they have a massive hit with this show. The DVDs came in perfect condition. Very happy with my purchase. Surprised it took a couple of weeks after release to reach me. But it's here! That's all I care about!",1441152000,,825,4.329032258064516

There is just the perfect mixture of violence, scare factor, death, and story line in this series that as soon as I started watching, I knew it was going to be a show for me. If you aren't partial to violence, blood, gore, and etc, then I don't recommend this show for you. But who knows, you might surprise yourself!",1441065600,,441,4.2

7089917,4,B00VGQJLDO,"Is this always going to be the Rick Grimes show? I think the series is at a crossroads right now and it's in danger of becoming a little too predictable. Some of the positives were the humor that Abraham, Rosita and Eugene brought. I'm looking forward to seeing Morgan use that stick next year. I don't think my favorite character- Michonne is quite ready to give up her Samurai sword just yet. That's good.
I wouldn't be surprised if the writers got ideas from fans. Nothing wrong with that. They finally found a place with strong walls and it's about time. Shouldn't they have learned to be more mobile by now? They should be trying to find out what it's like where winters get below freezing.
There was a letdown this year but it's still the best series ever.",1440892800,,762,4.489208633093525

7089920,5,B00VGQJLDO,"I didn't think I'd like a show about zombies but I was wrong. It's not about zombies but about trust, loyalty, how humans change in dire circumstances, and how you can still keep your humanity when the world has fallen apart.

This is quite possibly the best show I've ever watched on television and I've watched a lot of TV. Give it a chance, it may surprise you.",1440806400,,364,4.352941176470588
