2832018,5,B000Q6GUKW,season two is a must see. just as good as season one. wish the show was still on today or a spin off,1393891200,,100,3.391304347826087
2832019,5,B000Q6GUKW,WEEDS is very well written with well fleshed out characters. I enjoy the variety of everyday type of characters. Would recommend to most o f my friends.,1391472000,,152,4.666666666666667

2832043,5,B000Q6GUKW,I loved the whole weeds series. Too funny.  You don't want to miss this outrageous time. It is to High a time.,1379116800,,110,4.0
2832044,5,B000Q6GUKW,"I wonder if Weeds might have been approved of by Kurt Weil and Bertolt Brecht who wrote Three Penny Opera? To me it's a sly and wonderful satirical soap opera about our present delusional fantasies of what it means to keep up with the Jones's in America today and the nature of what our class ideas are as to what constitutes success at any price. This is the funny sunny side of what Breaking Bad is the dark apocalyptic evil version. I love the characters, the premise and the sarcastic twists of plot.",1378598400,,504,4.43010752688172

2832046,2,B000Q6GUKW,"Weeds definitely has some funny moments. I went in with the understanding the show is about drug dealing and the lifestyle that comes with it, the moral decay and sexual perversiveness got to be too much, so I stopped watching.",1376265600,,227,4.7
2832047,5,B000Q6GUKW,"I started watching Weeds during its second season and lost track of when it came on once I got busy in my life.  I always wanted to catch up on what I missed, so I decided to buy all of the seasons versus streaming them online.  There aren't many television series that I do this for, but I love this show!",1375401600,,306,4.0
2832048,5,B000Q6GUKW,Season 2. One of the better seasons before it went too far off the deep end of the later seasons,1372809600,,96,3.85
2832049,5,B000Q6GUKW,"I have watched Weeds when the first season started.  I have watched all 8 seasons.  I have now watched it for the second time.  I'm sure I will watch a third, and many more times again.  Funny and sad, love them all",1371081600,,215,4.0476190476190474

2832051,3,B000Q6GUKW,"I received number three for a Birthday present, and I received number six, but I didn't get the other's. I think the product is probably great, I just wonder if it is sitting where my camera for repair was. My camera was signed for at the Fuji repair shop 2 days after I sent it, so it said. I called them and they didn't get it until nine months after I called. I have never shipped or ordered, anything that wasn't legal period. Where are you?",1367971200,,445,4.186046511627907

2832069,4,B000Q6GUKW,"Picks up where season one left off, our suburban weed queen pin has expanded to a point of security, she then starts dating a DEA agent whom she marries to keep him from being able to testify against her. This set covers the entire 2nd season which leaves you with a huge cliffhanger.",1366502400,,284,4.377358490566038
2832070,5,B000Q6GUKW,"I have loved Weeds and since I always want to watch old episodes over and over and over, I decided to order the seasons and I could not be happier.",1366416000,,147,3.933333333333333
2832071,5,B000Q6GUKW,Even better then season one. This show is witty and shocking. I love being able to stream the episodes instead of having to purchase the dvds for a much higher price.,1364774400,,166,4.387096774193548
2832072,3,B000Q6GUKW,"If I had seen this series first, I probably would have liked it better. Lightweight, paper-thin characters, no real sense of risk. My wife won't even watch it.",1364169600,,159,4.714285714285714

2832074,5,B000Q6GUKW,The Botwin' s are my favorite tv family.  Everyone will enjoy this unless you're an uptight prude.  The story revolves around the mother but everyone has their own story to tell and it's done beautifully.,1363219200,,204,4.8
2832075,1,B000Q6GUKW,"The dvd set didn't came with the other cover to protect the first cover, plus the first disc had scratches and smeared on it",1363046400,,124,4.208333333333333

2832100,5,B000Q6GUKW,Weeds is one of the best shows ever written.  Executive Producer and writer Jenji Kohan is a genius and the second season only makes the viewer crave more!,1361318400,,155,4.535714285714286

2832104,5,B000Q6GUKW,I bought seasons 1-7 and watch them over and over.  You would think every episode is the finale with how it keeps you on the edge of your seat!  Awesome series!,1358726400,,160,4.129032258064516
2832105,5,B000Q6GUKW,"And it is still wonderfull . I love Martin Donovon since watching him play on trust and the fact he played not a nice person was confusing
my partner did a marathon and finished the whole season in a week",1358121600,,204,4.125
2832106,5,B000Q6GUKW,"I started watching this show on Showtime, loved it so much I bought Season One and Season Two, so I could watch them over and over again. Great show.",1357862400,,149,4.172413793103448

2832118,5,B000Q6GUKW,"Looking back at all of ""Weeds"", the eary seasons were clearly the best and this season might have been best of all. The cast and supporting characters are comfortable with the humourous tone of the show and deliver their lines with style. The plot devices still seem fresh. Suburban Agrestic, with it's horribly beautiful McMansions and Garage Mahals, is the perfect backdrop for all the shenanigans. Weeds was appointment-TV in those days, and I'm pleased to have the Blu-Ray set to relive the shows. The set has some interesting extras as well and this was the peak of a cmedy series that dragged on far too long.",1350086400,,615,4.757009345794392
2832119,5,B000Q6GUKW,This is the second season of the halirous comedy. Mom's moving up and things are getting hot. The cast are great in all their parts. This is a must have for all that are fans,1334534400,,174,4.0
2832120,2,B000Q6GUKW,"I loved the season overall,, but alot of scenes were cut out of the original episodes. I assumed it would be full length",1332460800,,120,4.260869565217392
2832121,1,B000Q6GUKW,"I ended up sending this product back as it was defective. I couldn't watch it! This was the first time I have ever had to send something back that I purchased on Amazon. I do realize however, that this item came from someone other than Amazon. I am waiting to be reimbursed.",1330214400,,274,4.288461538461538
2832122,4,B000Q6GUKW,Loved this so much I bought it for my mother in law as a gift for Christmas...she has a great sense of humor and loves this show almost as much as I do!,1325030400,,152,3.6363636363636362
2832123,5,B000Q6GUKW,"I purchased this from Amazon on a whim for 11 dollars. I absolutely ADORE Weeds. It actually has knocked Buffy the Vampire Slayer down a peg for me, as this is definitely my favourite show ever made. The fact that I say it was a whim that I purchased it is because I have Netflix, and they have (almost) every episode streaming. Therefore, with shows they stream, I have to ask myself what the point is in purchasing the show...With the fantastic price of the Weeds sets though, I decided to say 'forget it' and went ahead with the purchase...And boy was I glad I did!

Netflix's ""HD"" episodes do NOT hold a candle to the BEAUTIFUL image the Blu shows on my screen. The original on air episodes do not hold a candle to what I see on my television. Everything is absolutely gorgeous; Clear as day. I can literally count arm hairs. I can see pores. I can CLEARLY see stubble. Wrinkles...Everything is absolutely gorgeous and incredibly clear. I'm not sure if it's my television, my blu-ray player, or some combination thereof, but I do NOT at all see what some people are saying about the picture being low quality.

I'm not going to waste your time telling you about the show. Chances are, if you are here, you already know all about the show and are looking for information on the actual BLU RAY transfer, not the content of the show itself. I know that's what I come and look at these reviews for.",1322352000,2,1398,4.43579766536965
2832124,5,B000Q6GUKW,This company was great to work with. My DVD's incredibly fast and when I received a scratched season 2 and a (so far perfect) season 3  I e-mailed them and they sent me out a brand new season 2 for free and even threw an extra season 4 free of charge and over nighted it. I will forever be a customer to this company ! It is so rare to find great customer service like this especially on the internet.

I mean when you think about it a lot of fine things like classical music, cultural studies, unique wines and art really aren't always appreciated by the masses and within all those things I mentioned there are even sub groups that like certain elements about them as well.

2832147,5,B000Q6GUKW,"Ok, here's the deal.  If your looking for a hilarious TV series to watch while your waiting for a new season of something else this is great to fill the void.  If you have Showtime (which I don't) you can watch this on TV but as I don't I started watching this through Netfilx and couldn't get enough.  Funny as hell.  At some point you want to question the moral fiber of Nancy Botwin but she's just doing what she has to for her kids and to survive.  The character that Jenji created is strong and resilient kinda like a warrior.  She deals with everything and makes choices to fix the here and now rather than dwell on the future.  Wouldn't recommend this for your kids right off the bat until you watch the first few episodes of the first season.  Has some nudity duh it's on showtime.  But overall funny as hell and soooo worth your time to watch :)",1269216000,,854,4.254658385093168
2832158,4,B000Q6GUKW,"Showtime's ""Weeds"" offers a stellar second season as a follow-up to its hilarious opening salvo.  The second season of every good series is a treat as the actors get more comfortable with their characters and the writers get to explore some of the better ideas they couldn't squeeze into the first season (plus, by virtue of being picked up for another run, the writers feel a little more free to push the envelope).  But nothing has gotten tired or stale, and the writers generally haven't written themselves into a corner.

That description holds true for most of Season Two of the Battle for Agrestic.  On the one side we have our heroine, Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), emerging marijuana entrepreneur.  She's still trying to keep her dysfunctional family together while dealing with her beloved husband's early demise, but at the end of Season One she was pulling it together.  She even found her rebound relationship with the sensitive, dryly funny Peter Scottson (Martin Donovan).  But in the Season One cliffhanger par excellence, she learns the hard way that he's a DEA agent.  Not only that, but in Season Two we learn that Peter's more than a little familiar with the drug heirarchy in Agrestic, although this clever guy is able to sidestep Nancy's chosen career rather neatly.

At least, for a while.

Season Two is essentially Season One again, only more so.  Conrad (Romany Malco) continues to pine for both Nancy and the freedom to grow truly divine weeed.  Celia (Elizabeth Perkins) remains the Queen Bee of Agrestic and takes on Doug (Kevin Nealon, still awesome) for his cherished city council seat.  Nancy's kids and brother-in-law remain screwed up - comically so.  And through it all Nancy soldiers on with the blithe knowledge that things have to work out for her, 'cause she's got nowhere else to go.

My only problem with Season Two is that one character does a dramatic u-turn during the season, and the change is not true to the character.  I don't want to give anything away, but this change smacks of writers realizing a looming problem with where the show needed to go, and so this character is suddenly transformed . . . with dire consequences.

Still, this is a minor complaint for a season that builds to a Mexican stand-off in the finale that would have made Sergio Leone proud.  Kudos to all for another fine season in Agrestic.",1265328000,,2366,4.814356435643564
2832159,3,B000Q6GUKW,"okay, I got in to Weeds on a recommendation from a friend...I am totally addicted.  This review is not about the show but, about the format.  I went with Blu-ray format so I could check it out on my new LED television and BD player.  I am a bit disappointed in the quality - it is little better than a standard DVD that has been up-converted.  I was able to get seasons 1-3 on sale at Amazon for same price as the regular DVD so, at least I didn't over-pay.  But, if I had shelled out the full-price, I would be upset about it.  If you can get it on sale, go for it.  But, don't expect a lot of WOW factor.",1265241600,,606,3.918032786885246

From the end of episode 10 until about halfway through episode 12 the disc stutters and pauses constantly. I returned the first one I ordered thinking it was just a one-off defect, but the second one I received is defective in exactly the same way. Guess I'll have to contact Lions Gate about the issue.

Update 12/21: The disc is not defective, my LG BD390 has an issue with it. A friend played it on his Samsung player with no issues. I contacted LG about it, we'll see if/what they say.",1260489600,,600,4.357142857142857

2832166,3,B000Q6GUKW,"Not many of my friends have watched Weeds. Entourage, Seinfeld, 24, Lost, Prison Break, Extras seem like more familiar options but many people haven't even seen enough of those. One thing that I noticed about Weeds is that it has the most adorable soundtrack. You never know what they're going to come up with so I have a nice time using the newest app for my blackberry, Shazam.

Nancy Botwin (?) from weeds is a character with many flaws. She is not the best actress and she is easy to like sometimes but she is easier to dislike and find downright stupid. Conrad is a good character and the children plus brother in law are funny but sometimes you will find that too much time is spent on these characters making you feel that the show doesn't know whether to be young or old or mixed or how to be. This could be one reason the show is average if anyone's being honest.

Celia Hodes has a rather annoying character. And Doug Wilson is a bit like an annoying wasp. Conrad's family is wierd and I like the portrayal of a black family. Shane and Silas are both very good characters but sometimes they focus so much on Shane and it makes me feel so young and dank that I don't feel like watching it.

Is there too much of reference  to sex in the show? Well, that begs to raise another question. Is there too much weed in weeds? I think so.

I'll tell you why I call this average television now. I call it average because the show never seems to be going any place and anyone with a good chronological state of mind will find it impossible to not call it shady and fake overall.

But then again, I still watch it and possibly will. Season two's end was 9/10. Maybe that's why.",1252972800,,1675,4.284810126582278

Half of each show is not even about weed, drug dealing or drug dealers. Half is about the next door neighbors cancer chick and her fat daughter. I despise Mary Parker. Her face looks like Michael jacksons and she is always wide eyed bug eyed staring around when she talks. Retarded. The guys that are on the show are effimanates and the women are supposed to be all empowered. Stupid show about weed that is not funny.

2832183,4,B000Q6GUKW,"This is a great series.  This season isn't as ""serious"" as the first one, in that there is NO WAY this stuff could happen, but it is as good in that there are some really humorous moments and great characters.

In my opinion the frist couple of seasons are the peak of this show.  Interesting story lines and sub-plots that keep you guessing.  At this point, you still like the characters, who seem to have an ounce of remorse for all the stuff they do to hurt people.",1240617600,,468,4.284090909090909
2832184,4,B000Q6GUKW,"I haven't subscribed to Showtime in years, so I came to this party late.  I bought the first season on a recommendation, and while I liked it a good  bit, it seemed all a bit transparent.  It was too self-consciously quirky for it to get a hook deep in.  Characters are given droll dialogue that skims personalities, leaving out anything that couldn't be exploited for oddness.  It's the standard juxtaposition of relaxed hipness against the staid pettiness of self-righteousness, an in-your-face mockery of mainstream values already gainsaid by the basic naughtier truth.  Sometimes the stories went out of their way to find the most shocking scenario, skidding to a stop just short of offending anybody who might mount an effective complaint, even daring to show a nearly prepubescent girl locked in a lesbian puppy-love embrace.  This could be mistaken by the easily titillated for avant-garde television.  It doesn't seem so out-there to me, but is instead just plain fun to watch.  So by season's end, I concluded that the series was likable and entertaining, but unremarkable.  It finished with Nancy's business plan fully detailed, down to a division of labor.  Without a cliffhanger finale it felt complete and I didn't hurry to find out what happened next.  When I noticed this economically priced&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Complete-Second-Season/dp/B000Q6GUKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Complete Second Season</a>&nbsp;on Blu-ray, there was no reason not to follow Nancy's further adventures as TVs most enterprising MILF.

The second season maintained the brisk pace of the first, the dialogue still distinguished by the skippy style.  Like in the first season, the tension we're supposed to feel in Nancy's conflict over her familial obligations as a role model and her illegal role-busting activities is never a convincing source of drama or comedy for me, and my attention wanders until we get back to the good stuff.  Other than that, the series has definitely improved, has become darker.  A few hair-raising elements were added, events that make you a little nervous for Nancy.  She's compromised in nearly every episode, in some situations that are dangerous, some which are resolved in humorous ways; in others, not so humorous.  And the season finale has one humdinger of a cliffhanger.  I'm happily hooked now, and I'm eagerly looking forward to the third season.

As for the Blu-ray itself, I'm got a few reservations about the picture quality.  Oh, it's sharp enough alright.  But some textures are lost during particular lighting conditions, especially during closeups under a bright light or in the slanted light of a setting sun.  The skin tones became oversaturated in a garish yellowish hue.  The picture would shift suddenly as the light reached a threshold, jumping to a hotter palette, the complexions bleached in a yellow-to-white glare.  It's not unacceptable, but it was noticeable if you're overly sensitive to such things.  I shrugged it off because pleasing saturation levels were the norm, with everything sharply outlined with window-clear clarity.  However, beyond its slickness and its clean air, this series doesn't have a unique visual style, making hi-def inessential to the enjoyment of it.  Maybe next time I'll settle for the SD edition.

Unless the Blu-ray edition is cheaper, as it was this time out.

2832199,3,B000Q6GUKW,"Like Little Children, American Beauty, and Edward Scissorhands, Weeds portrays a planned community as a forgotten circle of Dante's Inferno.  Suburban life really isn't the gated paradise the brochures from the housing committee promise; rather, it's a cesspool of petty people with too much money and nothing to do with their lives.  We've see these kinds of shows and movies before.  What's unique about Weeds is that there really aren't any sympathetic characters.  Even the children in the show come off as selfish demons (who seem far too wise and ironic for their respective ages).  The cast is superb.  The things they do and say make you alternately cringe, laugh, and open your mouth wide to say, ""He did not just do that!""  And it's worth mentioning that the end credits to each episode generally feature a very funny and sometimes dirty folk or pop song that serves as an audio metaphor for the entire episode.  I enjoy the show's attempt to tell a quirky and increasingly unrealistic tale that must be a tremendous challenge for the writers.

On the other hand, the show doesn't evolve much further than a writer's delight: So much of the dialogue is simply a stream of creative, new curse words and phrases.  These start off as shocking and funny, but the veneer wears thin when you realize that it's just a device to divide your attention from the fact that very little is happening in the show, because all of the characters are made of the same selfish mold.  It reminds me of how Family Guy uses the same device in nearly episode: Something happens and Peter will be reminded of the time when he [fill in the blank], and the show proceeds to randomize the plot with a barely relevant flashback.  Again, funny for a while, but it gets old fast.

I should say that I'm not at all put off by Weed's liberal politics, with which I tend to sympathize, and which is probably the most consistent (biased?) part of the show.  Yet something essential is missing from the discussions on race, immigration, drug trafficking, teen pregnancy, single motherhood, suburban life, religion, draft dodging, and so on.  In the end, I have a sinking feeling that the show itself is selfish.  The show, like the characters in it, wants to gate itself off from the views of dissenters like conservatives and the religious.  But that's the way extremism works: Just as fundamentalism breeds no irony and imposes a black/white morality onto humanity, material secularism obfuscates personal responsibility and self-discipline.  In short, the show preaches to the choir who thinks the world would be better if everyone was a little higher, and the show only rarely entertains the possibility that maybe that's not really true either.",1233532800,11,2725,4.848812095032398

2832207,4,B000Q6GUKW,"The conceit of ""Weeds"" (suburban mom turns to selling pot) seems like it would be difficult to sustain over time.  Fortunately, the second season of ""Weeds"" pulls it off successfully by being funny but also keeping to the original theme.  As the season opens, Nancy decides to end her relationship with Peter when she discovers that he is a DEA agent; he seems oblivious to the fact that she's a drug dealer, but this relationship will continue to haunt her throughout the season.  Another character, Celia, undergoes a transformation after she has a minor car accident and decides to run for city council to unseat the pot-smoking Doug.  The other major plot involves Nancy and Conrad going into business together.

Season 2 of ""Weeds"" is as good as season 1, with the addition of more scares for Nancy.  It turns out that selling drugs in the suburbs isn't as safe or clean as she envisioned.  These changes help make the series more believable; however, the show starts to go slightly off the rails toward the end of the season, as more and more forces press on Nancy.  The season ends in an exciting cliffhanger, which is funny although out of character for the series.

On the down side, the most annoying character, Nancy's brother-in-law Andy, continues to get too much screen time, including an annoying draft-dodging subplot.  I'm sure his pot-fueled irresponsibility appeals to some viewers, but I find him irritating and unfunny.  Fortunately, some of the more enjoyable characters (e.g., Conrad and Heylia) get some nice new twists, which helps balance out the season.

The most intriguing is the budding romance between Nancy and Conrad while the one with her DEA agent boyfriend steadily falls apart.  It becomes pretty apparent he isn't a nice guy but Conrad is.  Cecila becomes a city councilwoman and Doug hates her and has sex with her.  Isabelle becomes a clothes model for Huskaroo and Nancy's boys become more involved in the drug business.  The story line is rich in other ways too.  So far this season is the best but the 4th season isn't too shabby either.  Near perfect show.",1227398400,,691,4.516129032258065
2832219,5,B000Q6GUKW,"I could resort to an ""addicted"" pun or throw in some sly jokes about dealing out as much laughs as Nancy does weed, etcetera, etcetera.  But when it comes down to this, the best way to talk about the second season of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weeds/dp/B0018B7E8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weeds</a>&nbsp;isn't marijuana puns, it's the simple truth.  This is a strong season of what was already a damn good show.  The writers pretty much took everything that worked about the first season and made it better.  They took risks, which in itself is a special thing in television, and each of those risks paid off in the end.

The status quo of the show changes, because Nancy graduates from small time dealer to a big wig grower/supplier, which leads to tension between her and... well, pretty much everyone.  The show manages to keep a healthy balance of drama and comedy while juggling the many on-going arcs of the series.  Each short episode in this collection is so textured and so crammed full of little moments of greatness that the season could probably be watched in one sitting.

I said it about the first season, and I'll say it again here.  From the acting, to the music (different artist performing the theme song each time now), to the direction, to the writing, this is a seamless show that is among the best series currently airing.

2832239,5,B000Q6GUKW,"People who follow Weeds are probably addicts and don't need a description, but for those who don't know or don't have Showtime, Weeds Season 2 is awesome.  The first part of the series resolves Season 1s cliffhanger ending in which Nancy ends up dating a DEA agent.  The middle sets up a number of new complications, stemming from her connection to the DEA and from new business aquaintances.  The end brings all of the many threads together in one giant mess and then fixes it with a deus ex machina that is actually believable.  It also leaves us hanging once again and does it in style.  As Nancy's complications increase, so does the drama, but the humor goes through the roof!

The writing is even better than the 1st season, with tons of memorable lines and hilarious visual moments.  Season 2 is also a lot sexier.  Nearly every character hooks up in some way, even Shane, in a kinda creepy way.  Silas' and Andy's relationships are just freakin' hilarious.  Lots of bad guys get what they deserve.  Celia raises bitchiness to new heights (even some drug dealers are impressed).  Doug pulls pranks on an epic scale and sings.  Nancy gets naked and starts to play rough (socially and in business).  I don't want to spoil it, but it's outstanding.

This DVD set is great, too.  The extras are well done and interesting.  You get 7 commentaries, a lot of ""Little Boxes,"" some featurettes, and even Huskaroos! commercials.  The music is critical since Season 3 ditches the much-loved theme song altogether.  This one of the best shows on TV, in my opinion, and having the whole season at once is a brilliant way to watch it since many of these episodes will leave you demanding more, RIGHT NOW.",1217376000,2,1697,4.653198653198653

More subtle and yet more complex than ""The Sopranos,"" this is Mary-Louise Parker at her best and bringing out the best in the cast around her. Incredible writing. Worth the price of a Showtime subscription all by itself, and certainly worth every penny of the cost for the DVD collection. Don't scrimp; if you have the equipment spring for the Blu-ray versions of all three seasons available so far (Season 4 just started this week with Albert Brooks added to the cast -- butI am going to miss the theme song of the first three seasons).

2832243,5,B000Q6GUKW,"If you've seen the first season of Weeds, then you basically know what to expect from the second season. Hilarious writing and performances mixed with serious family drama. Everything gets taken up a notch in the second season, though, with Nancy getting caught up in more complex situations right up until the final moments of the season, which I won't spoil here. The comedy is also a bit broader, but always on the mark.

My only complaint is that Silas is even more insufferable than before (he is the one character on the show I truly can't stand--it seems like all he does is throw temper tantrums). Thankfully, he is largely relegated to his own side story and doesn't spoil much of the fun!

If you haven't seen season one, then you should check it out first. A lot of the character relationships are set up there, and jumping in at season two might leave you wondering how things got to this point.",1212537600,,907,4.558282208588957

2832246,4,B000Q6GUKW,"It's hard for me to nail down what is so interesting about weeds.  I know why it is fun.  Every episode cliffhangs into the next, the writers make us care about the characters, even the ones that are being jerks.  The second season ending!  Wow!

What is so interesting is the moral ambiguity that everyone lives with one the show.  Nancy tries to keep her sons in line while breaking the law.  Children aren't sheltered they are pushed into the same lifestyle and actions as the adults.  Nancy continues to walk an ever-thinning tight rope while trying to do the right thing.  Perhaps the writers are trying to paint a picture of their opinion of everyday lives by going way over the top regarding the evil that we all do just to stay afloat.  I don't mind that story line at all, because when somebody on the show does something wrong, or evil, they end up paying for it to some degree.  It isn't like 24 where the main character breaks every rule and everything ends up forgiven.  Or the writers could just be writing a television show that I'm addicted to.

Take Silas for instance, a teenager who thinks only of himself, who sleeps with his girlfriend and gets her pregnant so she will stay with him. He is disrespectful to his mother and almost every adult on the show.  But he is potrayed as a ""normal teenager""...When Peter or Nancy try to tell him how to behave he simply blows them off.  Sorry but most teenagers don't act like that, however that is how he is potrayed. And I don't have a problem with it, because he lost his girlfriend, lost a lot of what is important to him because he acts that way.  I would never watch this show if he acted like a total jerk and nothing wrong ever happened to him.

I don't usually like shows where life is potrayed as ""you gotta step on someone to get by"" and that the only answer to all of our problems is drugs, alcohol or sex.  At least that is what all of the characters seem to do to get by.  They step on all of the things that are really important in life just to get the things they want.  Through all of that, you still find your self rooting for Nancy, for the two boys, for Andy, for Conrad, and even for Celia.

 Every episode more is dumped onto each character's plate and all of us lean forward in our seats to see how they can not only solve their problems but just live through the day.

I like this show a lot, it presents a strange worldview.  I believe there are people out there that think their lives are just this horrible and it is kill or be killed just to survive. Agree or don't, it does make WEEDS and very fun, very funny and very interesting show to watch.",1211587200,,2635,4.266129032258065

Using this; as a way of dealing with her emotional collapse, in return for providing for the family by dealing marijuana to neighbours and spacey school-kids. Nancy is played with perfect pokerfaced-untelling-drug-seller mum by Mary-Louise Parker, ex-West Wing star who talks on a less political and more social tasks of day to day life. She is groomed for any social eventuality. Alongside the mum of two is youngest Shane (Alexander Gould) who played the voice of Nemo in `Finding Nemo' who is less stutter and more into the wild flights of fancy. Older bro Silas (Hunter Parrish) who is eager to get his school life on the OC-type list by doing anything or anyone possible.

Yes, selling drugs makes good TV? Weeds outshines the morally ambiguous judgement on drugs.  Some of the people who do drugs are good, some are bad. But it's the person we judge, not the substance.
While it seems a bit Desperate Housewives, it's got a lot more going for it. With bitchy neighbour Elizabeth Perkins who makes the typical rich mum attitude take a leap forward.
With its entwined spontaneity, this is addictive and yet bizarrely enjoyable. Like most TV shows trying today: firmly planted in reality.",1206576000,2,1432,4.913223140495868

This show has depth if you need it but you can also just view this series as a fun romp full of charming characters in a sexy suburban setting. There's an iceberg here-an underplot if you look for it. Nancy is self-conscious about the fact that the neighbors seem to know her husband spent all of their savings on a kitchen remodel before he died. She wonders if her neighbors will know her Prada is fake. But instead of downscaling her life, she turns to dealing drugs supplied to her by black friends that live on the wrong side of town.

When she needs it, it's the black folks that come through for her but that doesn't stop her from somewhat betraying them when her DEA boyfriend/husband demands it. Neither does it stop her from denying the sexual chemistry that exists between her and her black business partner Conrad. Nancy walks a fine line between the life she should lead and the life she's trying to lead. Despite almost never doing the right thing, Nancy is a character you will like because it's apparent that in this modern life, morals get compromised in super shiny suburbia.",1204761600,3,1338,4.665254237288136

2832316,1,B000Q6GUKW,"This was tough one for me.  I praised season 1 of  Weeds simply because the quirky characters and originality of the concept trumped the childish depravity.  Alas, Season 2 gives you more of the same times two and that's the problem: they pushed the envelope and it's not funny anymore. Let's see, suburban matrons like Elizabeth Perkins cheat on their husbands and do it with wackos like Kevin Nealon.  See, Elizabeth is the GOP caricature, a Fascist homemaker doing all these positions with Kevin, the local Liberal. In fact, other than Perkins, the characters look as if they just stepped out of a Move On. Org meeting where they discuss Dick Chaney's need to kill as many Americans as possible in order to corner the rhubarb market. Dastardly!

In one middle-school debate, the writers put a hate Bush speech in a little cherubs mouth. Ughhh!  Okay, I get it: there's no alternative for poor mom in this evil USA but to be a priestess of bud. Sigh!  It's no longer a comedy when you can't feel sorry for mom, can't relate to the morons that inhabit California, and when you can't help but feel terribly sorry for the kids that live there and the child actors that have to act out adult fetishes, then you understand: what's funny to Hollywood types ain't funny to real people.",1189987200,10,1280,4.6371681415929205

2832326,5,B000Q6GUKW,"Another great season of ""Weeds"", as fully satisfying as season one.  Every episode features laughs, sexiness, good drama, and unexpected twists and turns.  And you also get a bigger dose of fun this time out, as season two gives you twelve great episodes instead of season one's ten.

Other Amazon reviews mention specific example after specific example of why this is such a great season of television, so I won't repeat those examples here, instead adding one additional observation that I haven't yet seen mentioned in any detail in these reviews, namely how excellently the breast cancer storyline is handled.

More specifically, what was so refreshing about the ""Celia gets breast cancer"" plotline is how much wasn't endlessly discussed.  A lesser TV series or TV movie would show an attractive woman getting breast cancer and then, following her surgery, we'd be certain to see the woman agonizing about her desirability, doubting her femininity, etc., etc.  However, in ""Weeds"", sexy, desirable Celia Hodes discovers she has breast cancer, promptly get surgery, and within two episodes is out there being the same sexy, desirable Celia Hodes we saw before.  She even enters into a hot affair with Councilman Doug, and he doesn't display any problems with her recent cancer surgery, either.  The topic never comes up.

I just found this ""non treatment"" treatment of the issue very refreshing.  By not making Celia show even the smallest concern about her desirability post-surgery, instead showing her going full bore back to her previous hedonistic pursuits, the show delivered a strong message, clearly communicating that a woman's true allure revolves around so much more than the current state of her bosom.  In other words, by not making an overt statement on the issue, the show made a powerful statement on the issue.

And typical of the sly, playfully intelligent ""Weeds"", this powerful, positive statement is delivered by showing a selfish, hedonistic woman go on being selfish and hedonistic post-hospital stay.  It has to be the first time in television history where blatantly irresponsibile behavior is used to deliver an inspirational message.  And you just gotta love that.

And you just gotta love ""Weeds"".  This show just keeps getting better and better.",1188432000,2,2277,5.180327868852459
2832327,4,B000Q6GUKW,"At the end of the first season of Weeds, Nancy Botwin--suburban widow and drug dealer extraordinaire--had just opened her own bakery and was starting to make an honest living. Nancy's oldest son Silas was getting serious about his deaf girlfriend and having the sex to prove it, her younger son was acting out by making terrorist video tapes and shooting at renegade mountain lions, and her (ex?) brother-in-law had decided to go to rabbinical school to escape the war in Iraq. Oh yeah. And Nancy had just learned that her new boyfriend was a DEA agent. OOPS!

The second season picked up with all that action, and more. Nancy and her partner-in-crime Conrad decided to start growing pot instead of just dealing it, Nancy marries her DEA agent boyfriend, and little miss MILF finally realizes that she may have gotten in over her head. You think?

Weeds may not be the best show on television, but it's certainly one of the most entertaining. The suburban community of Agrestic, California is hilarious with its uptight residents who have no idea about their town's dirty little secret. The supporting cast, including Nancy's crooked CPA and city councilman Doug, her best friend and cancer survivor Celia, and her former dealer Heylia Turner James only serve to enhance an already great cast of characters. Once you start watching, it's kind of hard to stop, and I will admit that for me this show is as addicting as the product Nancy sells.

A recent episode featured a pot expo, with scenes that featured the wonderful journal ""Cannabis Culture.""
But the flattering portrayal of the Israeli soldier is kind of disturbing.  Imagine if during the Apartheid regime, there was a show on tv that lovingly portrayed a South African soldier.  On top of that, the Israeli soldier character has a line where she says her brother was killed by a Hamas suicide bomber in a pizza parlor.  In the context of the reality of 3 or 4 times as many Palestinian civilians being killed than Israeli civilians, I think the pizza parlor anecdote (one that right-wing radio hosts repeat over and over again) is morally unfortunate.  Maybe in future episodes, there will be an Arab person who talks about the crimes committed against them; and maybe even an Arab militant will be portrayed in an understanding fashion, as the Israeli soldier is.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arabs-and-Terrorism/dp/B000R4SKEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arabs and Terrorism</a>

As said before it didn't ruin the comedy aspect of the show, in fact it is stil able to make light of very serious theme.
As always the acting, both dramatic and comedic (I found Mary Louise Parker hilarious at times) is wonderful, a real joy and pleasure to watch.
The DVD itself is a good job: LOTS of bonuses for such a small boxset, stuff like trivia tracks which are quite interesting and commentaries, and little pieces of technical information here and there. Gag reel.. the classics but really nicely done.

2832340,3,B000Q6GUKW,"One of the worst kept secrets in the entire world may be that the American suburbs are fueled by one very green plant. And who can blame them really seeing as how these neighborhoods function as basically totalitarian police states that thrive off of petty feuds, boredom, racism and exclusivity. Not that this show has any interest in ripping open the belly of the beast and leaving the entrails around for us to feed on, rather it is a surprisingly sweet show that actually idealizes many of the bizarre habits of the suburbanites. And there in lies the magic of the show, it is not about dealing drugs but rather about nothing more than this set of quirky characters. We hang out with generally likeable, downright relatable characters (who all happen to be narcissists) as they engage in the emptiness that is their lives. The dialogue is witty and filled with aggrandizing monologues that were probably a dream for the writers and were certainly a treat for me. Like ""The Sopranos"" it is an alternate, criminal take on the American Dream. And really, how did you earn your money? Was nobody stepped on, exploited, killed, or maimed, directly or indirectly, because of your quest for a high standard of living? I certainly can't say that.

The basic story arch this season deals with Nancy's (Mary-Louise Parker) decision to date a DEA agent named Peter (Martin Donovan). The overtly obvious set up actually produces some real results because the writers envision the characters as real people with real emotions. Lust begets love which begets betrayal which begets vengeance. Of course he would really use his governmental tools to eavesdrop on her; we're only taken aback by it because TV characters aren't supposed to be that smart. As the season progresses you realize that there was actually a big picture in place all along and that the writers weren't just sitting around baked for the first half. But after seeing how good things get in the end you look back on the first five episodes and feel as though they were squandered. I also loved the way that the personal interests infringed upon the business interests. All the characters make bad decisions, but they make these bad decisions in the name of a greater good and that is what keeps things interesting.

Mary-Louise Parker, after all these years, is truly more radiant than ever. She also turns in a strong yet underwhelming performance. Nancy is the soul of the show and Parker plays her up as the most likeable drug kingpin you could ever imagine. The show does little politicking for the legalization of pot but it is clear that that is where they stand. We can say free market all we want but isn't Nancy chasing the Armenians out of town the same as the pharmaceutical companies pushing for the illegalization of drugs that actually work? I will admit that the show never rises above the level of fun diversion. The episodes fly by (which is a good thing) but good luck placing this show into a specific genre. Comedy? Probably....but how many comedies do you know involve the elements that are found here? And the season ending cliffhanger shows that while their may be laughs for us the ticket holders in the future things in Agrestic are not looking all that humorous.",1186358400,24,3246,4.774021352313167

2832343,5,B000Q6GUKW,"The new and IMPROVED ""Weeds"". I only gave Season #1, three stars. I found many of the episodes too slow and plodding. I kept watching just for M.L. Parker and loved the final episode of Season #1.

For you harder to please folks, like myself, you can believe the hype. The 4 and 5 star reviews are now much closer to what this series deserves. I'm sure all the lovers of Season #1, would like to give Season #2, 10 stars out of five (if they were allowed to).

 Season 2, is simply filled with better plots (both dramatic and comedic), crisper dialogue, and much better pacing! Now the 30 minute episodes go by so fast, I was always left wanting more and was rarely (if ever) bored (it's good to finally be in the majority)! I think, of the 12 episodes of Season 2, I LOVED 11 and thought the other one was still very good.

I even loved the way they had different singers and or music styles for the opening theme song, ""Little Boxes"", in each episode. A very nice touch.

The DVD extras will also supposedly include a ""Little Boxes"" musical montage as well as 7 commentaries, a gag reel, 4 featurettes, Huskaroo commercials and a ""Jammin' Nation"" Extended Performance.

So, even if you were less than impressed with Season #1, do yourself a favor and at least rent or download two episodes of Season 2 and see if you agree. I'd give Season #2 on it's own, 4 and a half stars. So, since the DVD has extras, that will push it to 5 stars.

The tone of its second season reminds me more than anything of the venerable ""Six Feet Under"": it's extremely funny, and extremely smart, and it moves from ultra-dry sitcom territory into much darker places (and back) without warning or apology.

""Weeds"" casts its satirical throwing stars in 360 degrees.  While drug warriors get their well-justified comeuppance, we more libertarian types don't get off exactly scot-free.  Just the right medicine when it comes to a debate that's been all but shut down in more mainstream circles.

2832349,5,B000Q6GUKW,"I love the television series WEEDS on Showtime.

It's great!  Why?  Well... it has a variety of factors that make it good, one being the casting. The entire cast of this show helps make what it is, a great drama.

The plot is obviously a bit risque but it draws you in and begs to be tollerated.  After a while, you get intrigued in the storylines and get hooked on the suspense.  Every now and then, you get a lil bit of sadness and or romance to trigger up some emotions.  Otherwise, your rooting with either laughter or applauding the extreme efforts some of the cast members go to just make it.

The story does not just evolve around Mary Louise Parker but other charachters as well.  Therefore you are not drowned down with one single plot but multiple storylines that play well within eachother.

If you are looking for a edgy new aged series to plop down one weekend and engulf yourself in, this show has got to be it.

You'll be rooting for more after the end of each episode.  Only if they made the episodes longer.  You don't want it to end. But, when it does... you come down from your high and await the next series.

This is certainly not a show for those under 18 but for adults, it brings you into a level of great television but with a cinematic view.
