472450,4,6302499003,"'Nosotros los pobres' is a movie I have used several times in my high school Spanish classes.  I find that it is sufficiently ""impactante"" to transport my students to another place and time. I would highly recommend this film to other Spanish teachers.  The healthy confusion in the relationship between the various characters, combined with the teetering plot line and compelling emotional content keeps students biting at the bit as they yearn-squirm to understand what is going on.  It is a ""clsica del cine mexicano"".

472451,4,6302499003,"Nosotros Los Pobres Part II: Ustedes Los Ricos(1949) picks up where the first film left off. The biological father of Chachita(Evita Munoz), Manuel(Miguel Manzano), tries to adopt her...by force! If things weren't bad enough, Ledo(Jorge Arriaga) breaks out of jail and wants to get even with Pepe El Toro(Pedro Infante)!
 ULR has characters from the first film(Pepe, Celia, Tostada, Guayaba, etc.) as well as new ones(Atarantado, El Bracero, Torito, etc.). The first half of the film is fun and breezy, but the second hour has a nightmarish tone! ULR has one of the most climactic scenes ever filmed: Pepe El Toro is hanging to the side of a skyscraper and Ledo tries to kick him off! Will Pepe survive? Find out for yourselves.

The adventure continues in Pepe El Toro(1953)...",1220832000,2,778,4.976923076923077

472534,5,6302499003,"This movie is one of the icons of the Mexican Golden Cinema era.
The content of the movie also encompasses generally the sentiment of Mexican culture, meaning irony, difficulties and hard work. If you want to understand the roots of Mexican culture, like the ""telenovelas"" this movie will give you a glimpse.

To give you an idea of who Pedro Infante is for us imagine he would be a combination between Elvis, James Dean and Tom Hanks.",1357257600,3,435,4.64935064935065
