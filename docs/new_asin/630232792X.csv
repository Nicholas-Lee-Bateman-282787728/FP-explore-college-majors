455254,4,630232792X,"This is the most faithful adaption of an H.P. Lovecraft tale that I have ever seen. It is based upon the novella ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"", one of Lovecraft's masterpieces. The film doesn't bring about  the sense of dread and horror that Lovecraft easily manages to evoke in hos  story, but it is reasonably faithful to the storyline. It is updated to a  modern day setting, and some of the more doubtful aspects of Lovecraft's  tale are updated (the substituion of a private detective for CDW's uncle,  for example). The emphasis on the history of the sorceror who possessed CDW  is not emphasised enough, but on the whole a very accurate treatment.  Unlike most horror flicks, there is little extra violence or nudity added  where the plot does not call for it. A very good film, in my opinion.",959904000,4,804,4.652482269503546

455278,4,630232792X,"H.P. Lovecraft never had much literary success when he was alive; and his dense mythology of inter-dimensional monstrosities lurking just outside of our fragile reality proved difficult to translate cinematically as well.  In fact, the very first movie adaptation, Roger Corman's The Haunted Palace (1963), disguised itself as part of the director's popular Edgar Allan Poe series, when the actual source material was loosely based on Lovecraft's story The Case of Charles Dexter Ward.  But the breakout success of Re-Animator (1985) on home video twenty years later proved without a doubt that the author wasn't box-office poison after all...and filmmakers decided to give the tale of Charles Dexter Ward another go under yet another title:  The Resurrected.

With a modern day setting - 1991 at the time of filming - the story adds a private investigator to the mix, John March (John Terry), hired by Claire Ward (Jane Sibbett) to snoop out an explanation for her husband's unusual behavior.  Charles Dexter Ward (Chris Sarandon) just hasn't been the same after discovering the personal effects of his distant relative, Joseph Curwen (also played by Sarandon in a dual role), moving out of the family home to conduct mysterious scientific experiments with nosy interruptions.

March's investigation only raises more questions:  why is Ward speaking in such a formal Olde English manner...who are his strange associates...and what smells so god-awful behind the locked door to the basement?  Eventually, Claire has her husband committed to a mental institution to evaluate his psychotic state and strange craving for human flesh.  Meanwhile, a search of the house where he'd been working turns up a menagerie of half-finished monsters and an awful family secret that just won't stay dead!

Director Dan O'Bannon, although a genre legend thanks to his screenplay for Alien, was only heading behind the camera for the second time in his career, the first being 1985's entertaining zombie flick The Return of the Living Dead.  But where that film played fast and loose with horror conventions, leaning more towards comedy than straight-up scares, The Resurrected goes for a much more serious tone.  The script by Brent V. Friedman stays faithful to the spirit of Lovecraft's story, plunging our hero into the depths of demonic alchemy, facing off against fleshy afterbirth aberrations that threaten not just his sanity but also his very soul.

But the inexperience of both creators shows in the final product.  O'Bannon (who was supposedly quite ill during the shoot) lays on the film noir angle too thick, introducing Claire in nostalgic Bogey / Bacall fashion, then overlights the proceedings with the bland efficiency of a corporate instructional video.  Things improve as the movie develops, including a spooky underground set where Ward has abandoned his less successful experiments.  But even here, the budget prevents O'Bannon from truly capturing Lovecraft's prose in all its deformed glory.

The Resurrected's true ace-in-hole is Chris Sarandon.  With a series of genre credits to his name (The Sentinel, Fright Night and Child's Play), the actor obviously didn't look down on the material and his performance, which could have easily turned into a campy retread of Vincent Price-style histrionics, anchors the film in a twisted sort of reality.  His line readings, often direct quotations from Lovecraft's text, make even the most preposterous supernatural braggadocio sound convincing.  Sure, a bit of Prince Humperdink from The Princess Bride sneaks in from time to time, but even that works in an almost inexplicably entertaining way.

As to whether this is the best cinematic adaptation of Lovecraft, the debate rages on.  For my money, John Carpenter (ironically, O'Bannon's creative partner on their first film, Dark Star) came the closest with In the Mouth of Madness (1994), but it's only inspired by the author's work, not a true adaptation, if you want to be picky.  The Resurrected wins points for sticking close to its source material and generating some real atmosphere along the way.

Scream Factory delivers a solid hi-def transfer (the film went straight-to-video upon release so a theatrical comparison is impossible), a 2K scan of the interpositive, and pulls out all the stops when it comes to extras.  Besides an excellent group effort audio commentary with contributions from the filmmaking team (O'Bannon passed away in 2009) there are interviews with Jane Sibbett, Chris Sarandon, Brent V. Friedman and composer Richard Band.  Of even more interest to those longtime fans of the films, about 20 minutes of deleted and extended scenes are included.  Taken from a workprint, there's not enough here to change the course of the film, but it's interesting to see extra character beats and romantic subplots.  Scream Factory's release shows a lot of love for this little film that still lingers in many a fan's memory.",1504137600,5,4944,5.247776365946633

455308,5,630232792X,"Very interesting challenges exist when you want to make a book into a movie. What do you keep? What do your ignore? What just won't translate since you are working with two different mediums, each wonderful in it's own right. My rule would be to stay true to the basic line or underlying message of the book. This production of Lovecraft's story is very successful in staying true to the writer while allowing a film maker to recreate that idea on the silver screen. Terry and Sarandon give excellent performances. I think Sarandon's is the strongest since villains always get to have the most fun. The hero almost acts a the straight man to the villain. The love interest is fun but rightfully takes a seat further back on the bus.  The line Dexter's wife says about falling in love with his smile while viewing a picture of his dazzling, perfectly toothed smile plays well into the villain later on. (Will give no spoiler. It's a great line and ties together beautifully.)

This is one of my standards at Halloween or any time I want a well written/well acted horror story. It truly is creepy and though while mild by many standards since it is not a slice and dice or a sadistic blood orgy with torture and mutilation as the comic relief: It's a class act. Many people forget that our own imaginations, let loose and allowed to flow like a good blood transfusion, thrive on what you don't see, what you don't hear. Even worse, maybe...

I love this film, it's well worth watching and coming back to revisit for some good ol' scary story telling. I have studied film to write, as a technician and director/producer. If I ever get a chance to create a magical world for the silver screen, I hope I can give the audience something that matches the great elements of this story, brought to life to scare the wits of those who understand what really makes a scary movie.",1411776000,2,1868,4.537091988130563
455309,5,630232792X,"What a pleasant surprise!  Good gore, a story that kept me curious and odd creature-effects outweighed the blaring acting and film-adapted writing flaws.  Fans of gore and H. P. Lovecraft should definitely try out this little gem and enjoy.  ALTERNTATE TITLE:  Shatterbrain, I have no clue why.

This nifty Lovecraftian film is about a man who finds the lab journals of an old ancestor and is drawn into continuing his work--however morally questionable it may be.  Private detective John March, the narrator of our story, is approached by Claire Ward about her husband Charles Dextor Ward (Chris Sarandon) and why exactly he moved out of their home and especially why he requires suspicious quantities of meat and blood delivered for his mysterious experiments.  Charles' laboratory, a secluded house, has a local reputation for wreaking of carrion.  Hmmmm...

While all Lovecraft-adaptations diverge from the actual stories, the better ones retain strong elements amid modernizations.  Director Dan O'Bannon (Return of the Living Dead and writer of Alien, Life Force, Total Recall, Screamers, Bleeders and the Total Recall remake, among many others) follows suit accordingly with heavy weird tones, a general adoration for the macabre and a powerful element of mystery that prods viewers' curiosity into wondering the same things as Charles' estranged wife.  ""What is he working on at the house?  Why does he need all that meat? What is that smell?""

Based on H. P. Lovecraft's ""The Strange Case of Charles Dexter Ward,"" this adaptation is far from action-packed.  Instead, it follows Lovecraftian suit with horror that prods at your curiosity.  It is one of the better Lovecraft adaptations I have yet seen, with some disturbing images and ambiance.  It captures the atmosphere and the alchemy, the darkness and the ""less is more"" approach that leave haunting little shadows staring at its viewer, and it feeds the imagination. Another reason it is worth tasting is because it also leads the viewer forward, tempting them to keep going in order to unravel the mystery of what has happened.

As Dr. Ward, Chris Sarandon does a fine job.  He captures the tone and the horror of discovery well.  Missing the mark and deviating far from the purpose of the film is the grossly over-focused attention to a (pointless) romantic interest between Ward's wife and the detective.  This side-story is handled poorly and inconsistently, as if the writer couldn't decide whether to escalate the romance or not.  But, ill-placed romantic subplot aside, this is about as smart a film as we could hope for providing such a tiny budget.  As Lovecraft wrote of utilizing the ""essential saltes"" of an organism to bring it back from the dead, Ward's work is suggestive of genetic experimentation and cloning.  Unfortunately for Ward, the results were not exactly as he expected.

Lots of gore, blood and various remains.  We enjoy great zombie (i.e., animated dead flesh) effects,  some off-putting surgical imagery and surreal dream sequences.  The monster effects and action are limited largely to the very end, but it's all well worth the wait.  There are LOADS of special effects in the third act.  Some classic, refreshing stop-motion and claymation action as well as creature make-ups.

This film was a really nice surprise.  REALLY.  This is for lovers of gore, the macabre, Lovecraft, dark horror films and worthy horror stories.",1375488000,3,3419,5.13768115942029

455311,3,630232792X,"<strong>The Resurrected</strong> (Dan O'Bannon, 1992)

The great screenwriter Dan O'Bannon made an indelible mark in Hollywood with his first two scripts, a couple of science-fiction tales that twisted genre conventions called <em>Dark Star</em> (made into a cult-classic 1974 movie by a then-unknown director named John Capenter) and <em>Alien</em> (made into a classic 1979 film by then-obscure TV episode director Ridley Scott). While O'Bannon would pursue science fiction his entire working career as a writer, penning such gems as <em>Total Recall</em> and <em>Invaders from Mars</em>, when he took to the director's chair, he went with the other genre he'd worked in: horror. O'Bannon was also responsible for the script for the excellent, overlooked 1981 Gary Sherman film <em>Dead and Buried</em>, so he obviously had horror chops. Then, in 1984, he got his first chance to direct, and he jumped at it. The result was 1985's <em>The Return of the Living Dead</em>, to this day the best zombedy of all time and, to my mind, one of the best movies in any genre. (On my list of the thousand best movies ever made, <em>The Return of the Living Dead</em> sits at #8.) For some reason, O'Bannon would wait another seven years to direct again, and when he did, he found himself guilty of the same hubris so many horror directors fall prey to: first off, he attempted to adapt an H. P. Lovecraft story (""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"") to the screen, something that has been tried many times and usually failed. Second, and more odd for a veteran screenwriter: he went off someone else's script to do it.

<em>The Resurrected</em> (since re-released under the even more ludicrous title <em>Shatterbrain</em>) tells us the story of one Charles Dexter Ward (<em>Fright Night</em>'s Chris Sarandon), a nice, average guy from New England who happens to own a second house out in the middle of nowhere. As the time he spends up there increases, his wife Claire (Jane Sibbett, who should be, but probably isn't, best remembered as the female lead on the highly underrated TV series <em>Herman's Head</em>) hires a private investigator (<em>Full Metal Jacket</em>'s John Terry) to find out what he's up to. The two of them discover a diary from the eighteenth century kept by one of Ward's ancestors, and begin to fear that Ward is duplicating the experiments of Joseph Curwen (also played by Sarandon, which should give you a clue).

It's not a bad little film, and aside from updating the setting to the 1990s, it's surprisingly faithful to the source material. And yet, O'Bannon never quite seems to inhabit the material the way he did with <em>The Return of the Living Dead</em>, a screenplay he wrote. This one was turned in by Brent V. Friedman, who in the twenty years since the release of this movie has become a very respected writer of TV science fiction (<em>Dark Skies</em>, the recent <em>Twilight Zone</em> reboot, <em>The Clone Wars</em>), but who in 1992 was a relatively-untested commodity, best known for <em>Hollywood Hot Tubs 2: Educating Crystal</em>. Not really the guy to be developing a Lovecraft script, and it shows. But compared to most of the direct-to-DVD nonsense out there, the flaws in it are minor, and have to do with pacing and characterization (on the script side) and lighting and set design (on the tech side) rather than major problems that turn this into a showstopper.

It's not <em>The Return of the Living Dead</em>, but then, few things are. Probably best sought out these days by O'Bannon completists or fans of the principals, but Lovecraft purists take note: this is, comparatively, a pretty good adaptation. ** ",1329264000,,3654,5.033057851239669
455312,5,630232792X,"When I first saw this movie on VHS years ago, I was stunned. Being a huge Lovecraft fan I'm weary of any movie that is Lovecraft inspired. I'm not one of those people who says a movie is crap because they didn't do the story exactly like the book. I understand that there are going to be differences no matter how hard they try to be faithful to the book. I get it, but the problem with most book-adapted movies to me is when they do something else entirely and don't even get the atmosphere of the book into the movie. That's my problem with these kinds of movies. (Example is the 3 movies that are based on Matheson's I Am Legend, The Last Man on Earth, The Omega Man, and of course the horrible I Am Legend with Will Smith. With the exception of the Last Man On Earth, which is the most faithful of the 3, and has Vincent Price in it, those movies are nothing like the original story, especially I Am Legend which is so horrible and just plain wrong. C'mon they even named the movie after the book. It's disgusting really. Anyway, if you're a Lovecraft fan like me and want to see a faithful adaption of one of his stories on screen than check out The Resurrected. It's based off The Case of Charles Dexter Ward and is great. Dan O'bannon did a great job of capturing the creepy atmosphere of the original story.

The pluses are good direction, good writing and very good make-up and special effects. Also, Chris Sarandon gives it his best.

On the downside, this movie was put together by Full Moon's Charles Band and like those Full Moon pictures, the film looks pretty cheap (the movie screams 'low budget' right from the DVD menu) and most of the actors are stiff no-names.

455343,3,630232792X,"Loosely based on the Lovecraft story, The Strange Case of Charles Dexter Ward, The Ressurected is one of the best of the ""Lovecraft"" films out there.

Sticking to the suspenseful aspects of the script and Lovecraft's story is what this film does best. For me, I would have liked more time spent on that creepy, oh so creepy farm, so that I could have completely gotten the whiggins. When they enter the house, it is quite suspenseful, but never so suspenseful as when they are traversing the stone pathways and tunnels beneath the house and the surrounding land. That is downright nervewracking!

My chief complaint(s) is the acting/editing. I combine these two because I know that the actors involved are better in some scenes and less so in others. For example, in the beginning of the film, John Terry as the dectective is stiff and his delivery is awkward. However, he gets better as the film goes on. Terry is a competent actor. Therefore, I must believe that it is the way those scenes were edited.

This is a low budget film and that brings in its own set of dynamics. The script is not as tight as it could be. There's an attempt at building a romance between the detective and Jane Tibbet (Ward's wife), but it just sort of peter's out and isn't fully developed.

The negatives aside, this is a very competent horror/suspense film. It was made on a low budget, but the script is far better than many films with far better budgets.

Chris Sarandon as Charles Dexter Ward is firing on all cylinders. An actor who might have been once thought to be leading man material, Sarandon has made a name for himself in film portraying some of the most sinister of parts: Michael in ""The Sentinel"", Jerry in ""Fright Night"" and here in ""The Resurrected"".

Still, for what it's worth, I'm glad to see this movie released.  Based on Lovecraft's short novel ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"", it's not too horrible.  The movie people do add Ward's wife, who didn't exist in the story, and a private eye, who also didn't exist in the story, but they also remove Dr. Willett, who was one of the main characters in the story, so I guess it kind of balances out.  The feel is good, though, and actually fairly Lovecraftian.  I was impressed with the acting, because Chris Sarrandon was the only name I was even barely familiar with, and then it was because of Susan that I knew his name.  If you love the tales of Lovecraft, and also love movies, then this movie is by far the best adaptation.  Almost as good as ""In the Mouth of Madness"", although that is NOT really a Lovecraft story.  It just feels like it.",1125619200,2,992,4.377049180327869
455399,3,630232792X,"""The Resurrected"" is probably the first successful film adaptation of the work of HP Lovecraft. Based on the short story ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward"", director Dan O'Bannon (""The Return of the Living Dead"") manages to squeeze a smart, creepy and atmospheric movie out of a very small budget.

The film stars Chris Sarandon (""Fright Night"") as both Ward and his distant..relative. Though he hasn't been seen much since, when he does pop up on screen he always gives you something to remember.

The film's story is basically this (without giving away the details), Ward is a scientist who stumbles upon an old family secret and discovers a way to bring back those long dead, specifically his ancestor. Of course there are major complications along the way which have serious consequences for Ward.

His wife becomes suspicious and distraught and seeks the aid of a PI to uncover just what is happening to her husband. What he learns is truly horrific, from Ward's fate to the unspeakable ""failures"" in the darkened catacombs underneath the old Ward estate.

""The Resurrected"" is certainly the most faithful Lovecraft film to date with only a few changes being made to help aid the transition from strange short story to feature film. Forget the other adaptations or the ""inspired by"" films, ""The Resurrected"" is the way to go.

The DVD will unfortunately be full screen only, Dolby 2.0 sound and have no bonus features. ""The Resurrected"" should have been in widescreen as it was filmed in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio.",1121644800,6,1516,4.90625

A great flick for those horror fans who love creepy investigative movies. I have it and I like it. If you like RE-animator get this one.",1116288000,5,415,4.671232876712328
455401,5,630232792X,"The Resurrected is loosely based on Lovecraft's ""The Case Of Charles Dexter Ward"", but you don't have to have read Lovecraft to enjoy this low budget thriller.

The acting is decent, with pretty Jane Sibbett as Claire and sexy Chris Sarandon as Charles, and even a decent performance from Robert Romanns (remember snakey Mike Damone from Fast Times At Ridgemont High?) as Lonnie Peck, detective John Marsh's partner.

While it follows the Lovecraftian basis of underlying fear and shadowy horror, there are enough chunky things in this broth to satisfy gore fans as well as thriller fans.  The movie is a little slow to take off, setting up the background of Charles's odd behavior and midnight flesh deliveries, moving with slow but deliberate dread towards the culmination of Claire and John's expedition into the cellar of the old house.

While the monsters are a bit cheesy in appearance, they make up for it in the grotesquery of their creation; truly horrifyingly put together chucks of flesh, teeth and pudding, enough to make you hit that pause button in order to study it's deformities before vomiting.

The plot?  Claire seeks the help of detective John Marsh to help her discover what her husband Charles has been up to.  It seems Charles has isolated himself at his labs, taking strange deliveries at odd hours.

John discovers more than just a dedicated scientist, he discovers a madman who believes he has found the secret to immortality.  The shipments Charles received were in part the old bones of men who were once considered wizards, and when John and Claire confront Charles they find that he is ill and strangely different.

The rest of the story will unfold on its own, very well filmed and laid out, with a creeping sense of ""Uh-Oh"" that will lead you eventually into Charles's cellar of atrocities.  The use of flashlight-only photography in the cellar was marvelously done, adding the right dimension of terror and allowing the corners to fill their darkness with shuddering fear.

All and all, a B-horror movie well worth the price to purchase; I just wish they would release it on DVD.  Enjoy!",1094688000,10,2120,4.888268156424581
455402,5,630232792X,"When your husband goes a little mad and starts doing experiments in private, first leading you to believe that something grand is happening and then ordering you not to keep tabs on him and the estranged people he's now dealing with, what do you do? While most people would choose ""get the hell out of Dodge"" for 500 and would be correct in doing so, this story instead revolves around the not-so-bright outlooks spawned by love and a private investigator being brought into the fray to find out what's going on. This action is good because I'm not involved, too, eventually leading to interesting playgrounds in the lands of ""what's that smell,"" ""what is that moving in that pit,"" and ""look at this book I found explaining the dark past,"" giving one ocular candy on which to feed.
While many haven't really liked this adaptation of The Case of Charlie Dexter Ward, I find it to be a really nice watch and like to summon it to my VHS player when I need something to entertain me. Part of the reason I can say that is because it is a fair adaptation of Lovecraftian thought, but that it doesn't try to retain everything Lovecraftian. It instead captures the needed portions, the atmosphere and the alchemy, the darkness and the ""less is more"" approach that leave haunting little shadows staring at its viewer, and it feeds the imagination. Another reason it is worth tasting is because it also leads the viewer forward, tempting them to keep going in order to unravel the mystery of what has happened, and then it suddenly pays off in a flashback to the ""grotesque of the past"" and a fast-forward to ""the hideousness still thriving today."" To me, that's like finding a pirates bounty within a seemingly ugly chest, not expecting too much but opening it to uncover more.
While a few points could possibly be taken away from the movie because of the overcooked undertones, I thought that they actually fit into everything nicely. The way the experiments were treated gleaned hideously at me from the shadows, too, and the horror of discovery, the true payoff, was superb. Perhaps this couldn't be called a pure fabrication in the realms of cinematic bliss for those wanting complexity, but it is definitely homage material to CDW brought to us by Dan O'Bannon. Does that mean its not campy? No, but that's part of the equation, with gore and atmosphere rounding it all out well.

Well, me too.  That aside, the acting and special effects are weak, but the mood is all there.  It is definitely worth a viewing if you are a Lovecraft fan.

455404,4,630232792X,"This second film adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft's famous novella, ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward,"" comes off slightly better and more faithful than the first (The Haunted Palace, 1963)  -  though both are good  -  and is one of the best screen adaptations of the author's work, to date.
Chris Sarandon plays Charles Dexter Ward, who goes mad shortly after moving into an isolated inherited estate.  Wife Jane Sibbett hires private investigator John Terry to find out why.  Terry gradually uncovers a centuries-old familial conspiracy involving alchemy and the raising of the dead, connected to a charnel house straight out of Dante's or Goya's worst nightmares.
The production and effects are top-notch.  Richard Band provides another of his moody soundtracks, and FX-meister Todd Masters generates some of the most unsettling living dead/zombie effects ever seen on film.  Brent V. Friedman's script is slow to get rolling, but pays off in the end and is refreshingly adult for this kind of thing, as is Dan O'Bannon's direction.  The performances are consistent and good, though Sarandon comes off a bit campy at times.  There are some glaring irregularities in logic  -  since when has there ever been a padded cell the size of a hotel suite, for instance, with its own openable picture window?  -  but not enough to detract from the pleasure of this great, gory horror-fest.",1029888000,4,1379,5.0176211453744495
455405,3,630232792X,"H. P. Lovecraft called this story The Strange Case of Charles Dexter Ward, and it remains one of the creepiest stories I have ever read. It is not action packed like most of today's films; it is more of a horror that plays in your mind when you relax and try to go to sleep or something.
Dan O'Bannon's The Resurrected is only a little less successful than the story. It is probably the best Lovecraft adaptation I have yet seen, with some really disturbing images and ambiance.
The film is about a man who finds the journals of an old ancestor and is drawn into continuing his occult delvings. His wife comes to a private detective (modern trappings of the screenwriters) with the strange tale of her husband's obsessive studies at an old farm near the Pawtuxet river. She wants to know why he has moved out less than a year into their marriage and why he gets huge quantities of meat and blood delivered so often.
The detective and his associate delve into the mystery, and that is when the film becomes very effective and haunting. It seems that Charles Ward found the writings of an ancient and reviled ancestor Joseph Curwen, who was burned at his farm by the townspeople for practising witchcraft. The atmosphere of Lovecraft's story is strong in the recounting of Curwen's tale through the writings of a local witness to the burning. He described strange events near the farm, strange sounds at night. Also, during one year's heavy spring flooding, horrible, malformed but vaguely human things were washed out of the riverbank near the farm.
The detective goes out to see Ward, who has a new companion named Dr. Ash that wears many bandages on his face. Of course, he finds nothing until later. Underneath the house is a chamber of horrors that also captures some of the genuine chills of the story. Down there in the subterranean gloom, our man finds out just what Ward has been up to, and just manages to get away with his life.
I will not say anymore, lest I spoil it for those who have not read the story. The plot has a good twist in it, long before that became the modern marketing strategy of movies like Sixth Sense, What Lies Beneath, etc.
Chris Sarandon plays Ward, and he is the most excellent thing about this film. He gives an appropriately elaborate performance that still manages to look and feel uncontrived. He is a powerful presence in this role.
Typically, Lovecraft's writing style does not translate very well to the screen. He favored atmosphere over action except in his more lowbrow efforts like the Herbert West stories. Unfortunately this film tries to make it more accessible to the viewer by layering a detective story on top of it. An interesting method, but it rings false in this context. So does the understated romantic angle between detective Marsh and Ward's wife. The movie can't seem to decide if there is a romance or not, as if there might have been more that was cut out. It is totally gratuitous anyway, just something to appeal to the masses.
I do recommend this film despite it's shortcomings. The story is strong enough to survive the little faults. Dan O'Bannon could have gone the campy route (a la Brian Yuzna) with it but he did not (yea!). This one has much more intelligence than the average low-budget movie as well as the faintest suggestion of cloning or genetic experimentation. Lovecraft did write about taking the 'essential saltes' of a creature and bringing it back to life. Unfortunately for Charles Dexter Ward, the results were not what he expected.",1017446400,44,3517,4.683360258481422

This film may not be high budget but since when has that been a prerequisite for a well made movie? The script is solid and well written, keeping a good pace and interest without overreaching itself. The direction is on target creating a feel very much like you would get reading ""The case of Charles Dexter Ward"". The cinematography is beautiful at capturing the dark gritty atmposphere and tight feel of a Lovecraft thriller. The only are the film itself may be lacking is in the acting, but to be honest it isn't near as bad as it could have been and it is almost unnoticable when you have become immersed in the atmosphere of this film.
