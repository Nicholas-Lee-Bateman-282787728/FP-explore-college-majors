380016,1,6301933869,"This movie is so bad that is not fun. Boring, awful direction, amateurish acting, the plot doesn't make sense. If you thought that SUPERFLY T.N.T. was bad this is worst ( Priest working for the cops to capture the big drug dealers? Give me a break!). Go back and watch the original SUPERFLY which is the one,I am sure, that the guy that gave this one five stars was thinking of. Avoid this one, you have been warned!",1079654400,,416,4.346153846153846

380065,5,6301933869,"If you want great acting, high production values, and a plot that makes sense, look elsewhere. But if you can turn your brain off,  remember the late 80's, and love Blaxpoitation flicks, this is THE movie to watch.  The movie poster really does tell you everything you need to know.

380287,1,6301933869,"Just an awful movie, this.  Stilted lines, wooden acting, goofy fight & shooting scenes, bad; just bad.  Most of the actors seem more interested in posing as hard men than in furthering the plot.  Like boys in a junior school, given a camera and asked to make a film--too bloody cool for school they become.  R=",1432512000,,311,4.5

380289,1,6301933869,"before i saw this movie i was convinced that any actor replacing ron o'neal as priest definitely wouldn't cut it.  i was right.  every time someone addressed this character as 'priest' i felt a small pang.  for some unknown reason this character returns to new york after living aboard for a couple of decades.  there's no reference to his love and confidante 'georgia' who was a major player in helping him  ""get out of the life"" and accompanied him to europe (not to mention that unforgettable tub scene). after all the years that have passed his ex-partner eddie finally gets his comeuppance.  things don't go so well for ""priest's"" other ex-drug buddy 'nate' either. the end of the movie was somewhat perplexing.  i was under the impression his new woman had been molested and then killed by crooked cops.  the ending shows her and ""priest"" enjoying the sights of europe after ""priest"" puts away all the 'bad guys'.  superfly tnt definitely had it's shortcomings but at least there was ron o'neal to keep fan's eye's riveted to the screen.",1406073600,2,1043,4.782122905027933
380290,5,6301933869,i had bought the superfly from amazon i was glad to see the return excellentt better to me than the first one amazon is the best place to buy old and new movies i have a excellent collection of over 200 movies i have purchased being a amazon customer i love it thank you amazom and its sellers keep up the good work,1357862400,2,315,4.015873015873016
380291,5,6301933869,"I miss Ron O'Neil. He was Superfly. In this one we get Nathan Purdee who does extremely well with what he's given but it's just not the same as having Ron in the role. But Purdee is cool and does his best to make this a decent flick and I appreciate that.
The reviewer who said that in this one Priest ""works with the cops"" is incorrect. The cops try to force him to work for them and Priest REFUSES. He handles things HIS WAY. That's exactly how it should be.
The original Superfly was about a clever man who wanted out of ""the life"" and the soundtrack by the great Curtis Mayfield let us know that drugs aren't the answer. Mayfield returns in Return of Superfly and lets us know that Priest is still clean (see Superfly T.N.T) and he's on the right track and a positive force.
Return of Superfly proves just how right Priest was. His associate, who turned on him all those years ago in the original and kept pushing drugs and kissing up to ""the man"" who really ran the drug trade, has been killed. Now Priest must stand alone from the dealers and the cops and handle thing his way. I liked that.
What makes Priest such a great character is that he's a thinking man's hero. He uses his brain to get out of tough situations in all three Superfly films. This one wasn't made in the 70's and so it gets a bad rap for not being ""real blackspoitation"" but I enjoyed it a great deal. An excellent third part to the story of Priest.",1103068800,8,1426,4.227106227106227
