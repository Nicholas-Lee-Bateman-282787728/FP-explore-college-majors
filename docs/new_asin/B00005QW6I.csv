1652344,3,B00005QW6I,"Still struggle with the boom mike appearing in some scenes above the actors, making the film obviuosly a bit cheesey.  Short on story line but the actors pull it off. Brimley and Mitcheum are great and the supporting actors do a good job given the script.
The acting made the story believable enough to endure.  Felt like I was watching a biography where you want to see what happens dispite the quality of the camera and mike work.",1361491200,5,432,4.5256410256410255
1652345,5,B00005QW6I,Enjoyed watching this movie a lot. Really like Wilford Brimley and Robert Mitchem and they play well together in this movie.,1360540800,4,124,4.9523809523809526
1652346,3,B00005QW6I,"I enjoy old movies and this one, a real movie critic might rate as a ""B"" movie or maybe 1-star. However I like both Mitchum and Brimley they probably did this one between real jobs just to stay busy. Movie has lots of flaws not the actors fault I especially like the scenes in tight quarters where you can see the boom mike swinging back and forth between actors. I found the movie entertaining pretty good story line and good flaws so for those I give it 3-Stars.",1360454400,3,464,4.284090909090909
1652347,5,B00005QW6I,"I hadn't seen this movie until just recently, but I'm now a huge fan.  Brimley and Mitchum are top-notch in the roles of Johnny Thompson and Red Haines.  It's very exciting throughout, I definitely recommend seeing it.",1334707200,5,218,4.864864864864865
1652348,5,B00005QW6I,"Wilford Brimley and Robert Mitchum both laid down great performances for this movie. This movie was produced in an era before the time of special effects and CGI, however, it holds its own due to good content, solid and honest acting, and a good story line. It was enjoyable.",1298246400,11,275,4.63265306122449
1652349,3,B00005QW6I,Both of the stars were a little old for a cops and robbers movie--You could just about predict something before it occured.  Hard to think they were still buddies to the end.,1266105600,,174,4.4375
1652350,3,B00005QW6I,"Robert Mitchum, the patriarch of Winds of War & War and Remembrance does not make a very good bad guy. He is reluctantly forced into escaping during a prison transfer but his heart isn't in it. The interaction between Mitchum and Brimley is the only redeeming factor of the movie. The chase seen is unbelievable because there is just no way two old geezers can run like that. Spoiler alert: Who gets shot and who has the heart attack?",1448236800,,434,4.506329113924051
1652351,4,B00005QW6I,"Mitchum is his usual bad boy self and Wilford Bromley does an equally good job of playing the relentless pursuer.  I enjoyed this, because I grew up when Mitchum was the celebrated criminal in Hollywood, having caught a drug charge or two for smoking and possessing MJ in the late 40's when only really hard core junkies and musicians were known to do it.  He also got into torrid love affairs with starlets and getting into brawls which Hedda Hopper featured in tabloids like Screen Magazine and the Hollywood Mirror!  He still had it when he made this film!  Also like Lee Marvin a Marine who served in the Pacific during WWII!  You just don't get that kind anymore and today's tough guys never had it like he did and a few others like Marvin!",1443744000,,745,4.488888888888889

1652358,1,B00005QW6I,boring.  I couldn't finish watching it.  My wife watched the whole thing but didn't think it was any good either.  Good cast; but they seem to walk thru their roles in this boring movie.,1428105600,,186,4.411764705882353

1652361,1,B00005QW6I,"OMG, this movie was terrible.  On three different occasions I saw a microphone appear in the shot!  The plot was weak although it was helped bu Robert Mitchum and Wilford Brimley's acting skills.  I could almost see Wilford reminding Robert to check his blood sugar (and check it often - for diabeetus) in the final scene where he finally caught up to Robert.",1412899200,,359,4.666666666666667
1652362,2,B00005QW6I,"This movie moved so sloooooooow, although I don't need a high action packed movie for my viewing pleasure this one chugged along. Robert Mitchum has been a long time favorite of mine so this made the movie bearable for me. I also enjoy the acting of Wilford Brumley so this was an added liking.",1412640000,,294,4.462962962962963

1652365,4,B00005QW6I,Good tale of two friends who choose to iive life in their own terms.  One on the side of the law and other in th face of the law.  Enjoyed the banter between the two and how friendships change with age and occupation.,1403222400,,217,4.023255813953488

1652367,2,B00005QW6I,"I watched this movie because I've always was a big Robert Mitchum fan, but this movie was a disappointment. It was slow going and draggy. But, Mitchum kept it from being a total loser!",1400112000,,184,4.4411764705882355
1652368,1,B00005QW6I,"didn't meet the strength of Mitchum, actually didn't finish it.  The whole family story didn't seem to fit any type of plot.  Love Robert Mitchum  movies, but this one was not up to par.",1399161600,,186,4.411764705882353
1652369,3,B00005QW6I,"Low budget made for TV plus an aged Robert Mitchum. But, still Classic Robert Mitchum with a bonus portion of Brimley.",1396051200,,118,4.666666666666667

1652372,2,B00005QW6I,"As a fan of Bob Mitchum, it pains me to say it, This one is worth passing. Despite the support from veteran actor Wilford Brimley, this film about an aging con sprung from a life sentence is TIRED, SLOW AND GOING NOWHERE!
My advice...don't waste your time.",1393200000,,256,4.468085106382978
1652373,3,B00005QW6I,"So much more could have come out of this movie.  Its a ""B"" at best, slow paced, lacking any definitive dramatic point.  Great to see Mitchum and and Brimly though.",1389398400,,163,4.4
1652374,5,B00005QW6I,"It was great to find this on DVD.  Goodl story, Great actors who worked well together.
Probably wouldn't appeal to to youngsters who want more explosions, fights and other
violence....and profanity.  But I loved it.",1386979200,6,215,5.114285714285714
1652375,4,B00005QW6I,"John Thompson is the essence of a natural Existentialist.  I will watch this film again just to observe Thompson's (the Robert Mitchum character's) responses to the situations which confront him.  Essentially this is a film about an escaped convict and his die-hard hunter played by Wilford Brimley.  Kathleen York, is such a chameleon as an actress, that I'd believed I'd never seen her before in anything, but she is always working, it seems, and is also a talented writer.  In this film she transforms herself into a carelessly emotional and unsophisticated young woman who one would worry about due to her spontaneous choices and complete abandon.  It is unusual that one finds characters so well rounded as to inspire real interest in what is to befall them.  Is this due to good writing (writer, John Carlen, d. 2009)? the acting?  According to IMDB: ""His [Carlen's] time in prison as a male hustler and a bank robber served as inspiration for some of his film scripts. He began writing while in jail"".
Without film tricks, car crashes, bombs, perspiring actors, blaring music, etc., this viewer's interest was consistent from beginning to end.  When Thompson finds a high stakes card game, the precedent for his quick insight into other players has been set up previously in the carnival scene in which he observes a carnival hustler cheating his young nephew.  This situation of protecting innocence, which he also does with his flighty niece, makes him a heroic bad guy.  Even after reminding myself that this man did not only steal from crooks, but also hard working folks, I still didn't want him to get caught.  Why ""Existentialism""? -- because one of the major tenets is that everything is about choice.  We choose, even if we choose not to choose.  Thompson chooses to choose.  Even with the possibility of losing, he chooses, he decides.  Unlike choices one makes often in life, his choices could mean complete downfall.  In that aspect, this movie inspires one to find one's own private courage to navigate the world unmasked, deciding to decide, win or lose.",1382313600,10,2075,4.919540229885057
1652376,3,B00005QW6I,"If you enjoy a character study with little action you should enjoy this.
There is the added bonus of this movie offering the most shots of the boom mic.",1373155200,,152,4.275862068965517
1652377,4,B00005QW6I,"I have been a long time fan of Robert  Mitchum one of the great actors of all time

1652378,3,B00005QW6I,"But as to the plot, it comes under the heading, work for the boys. Keeps them working. Good for movie night and keep that popcorn coming...",1370390400,,139,4.384615384615385
1652379,3,B00005QW6I,Robert Mitchum and Wilfred Brimley give good performances in this uninspired film.  The production is sloppy and the writing is hackneyed.  You can drive a truck through the holes in the plot.  Recommended only for fans of the two lead actors.,1370131200,,243,4.878048780487805

7951377,3,B00005QW6I,"I have always been a fan of Robert Mitchum and that led me to this little known movie that I had not heard of before. My enthusiasm for Mitchum, and to some extent Brimley, forced me to watch the movie in its entirety. But if other actors starred, I would have given up on this turkey at the half way mark. Mitchum basically walks through it as though he needed to get a couple weeks pay but knew as well as I did that the story was lame. So watch it if you are a big fan of real man Bob, but otherwise save your time and take a nap.",1482883200,3,533,3.8545454545454545
7951378,1,B00005QW6I,"This movie just SCREAMED TV movie. 2 great actors, sad to see them reduced to this in their later years. The film quality, the acting, the story, all of it------watch some of Mitchums ""real"" movies, don't waste your time on this thing",1473552000,,234,4.595238095238095
