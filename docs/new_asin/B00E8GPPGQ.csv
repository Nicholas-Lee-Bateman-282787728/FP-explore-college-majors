5895819,5,B00E8GPPGQ,"Excellent show with perfect casting. There is no laugh/sound track which makes it so nice to watch. Malcolm often breaks the 4th wall while staying in character. It's pretty amazing for a child actor so young to be able to do that.
The dvd's were all clear and perfect. The seller was quick to answer emails and very nice (Cinema Cornucopia).  He even emailed prior to the transaction to make sure I knew these dvd's were Region 2.  If you live in America and want to purchase this set (it is Region 2) all you have to do is buy a dvd player that plays region free dvd's. Amazon sells them (Samsung) and they're not expensive. These dvd's aren't sold in the US because we are not Region 2.
You won't be disapointed!",1449100800,3,715,4.368421052631579

5895822,5,B00E8GPPGQ,"Just to confirm, I am American. So this review is coming from an American buyer.
I bought this box set about a week ago (for much cheaper than it's selling for on Amazon right now actually), and if you love this show as much as I do, this IS essential. I grew up watching this show, so naturally I wanted to own every single episode, not only Season 1.
Yes, this is Region 2, but it is NOT PAL format like the above states. I was really surprised to find out (when I was copying the DVD's to break the Region 2 code) that all of the discs are actually 720x480 NTSC (PAL is 720x576), nowhere on the actual box set, or any of the separate DVD cases does it say PAL, and the only thing PAL DVD's will play on for me is my Xbox 360. Usually with PAL, you get this terrible 4% speed-up on the video and sound. I noticed while watching the first 2 DVD's that it sounded totally fine. So I took a closer look at each DVD's video properties, and they are for sure NTSC. The only thing stopping me from watching the original DVD's on my DVD player is the annoying Region 2 coding.
All of the episodes are 16:9 Widescreen (with the exception of the very first pilot episode) and the picture looks great. The sound quality is excellent as well. I have absolutely no complaints about this box set, besides the Region 2 coding. Still, even with the Region 2 coding, I give it 5 stars, because you know what you're getting yourself into when you purchase it.
When I purchased this set, I assumed it was going to be in PAL, and it turned out to be NTSC, which plays perfect in all my DVD players (after I re-burned each DVD and broke the region code). Once you break the region code, you won't have any issues watching the DVD's on your DVD player (unless you have a dinosaur DVD player that won't play burnable DVD's).
So if you are American, and don't want to wait possibly forever for a complete 7 Seasons - Region 1 DVD set to come out for this show (because all we have right now, as I write this review today, November 5th, 2014, is Season 1 released here in America), buy this set, along with a pack of burnable Dual Layer DVD-9 discs so you can break the Region 2 code to Region 0. You will need exactly 21 Dual Layer DVD-9 discs, and 1 DVD-5 burnable to be able to back these up without compressing the video (because Season 2 - Disc 4 only contains 4 episodes, so there is no compression needed because it's already a DVD-5 disc).
Please keep in mind I am not advocating that people bootleg anything, or make copies to sell them. That is criminal, I can't stand pirates. That's one huge reason that I actually PURCHASED this set, and didn't just download some highly compressed .avi junk that was recorded off TV and uploaded online somewhere. Unfortunately sometimes we have to go to extremes to be able to watch our favorite shows on DVD today, because it takes so long for companies to pull their heads out of their asses. I do not like streaming media at ALL (Netflix, Hulu or whatever), I like the thought of owning a PHYSICAL copy of my favorite shows and movies I watch, not only because I can proudly display them on my DVD shelf, but also because I don't like the quality of streaming video either.
When you live in a world where it takes forever for a DVD set of a show that's not even all that old to get a complete DVD release, you have to do what you can to be able to enjoy it. And who knows, maybe 3 years from now there will be a domestic Region 1 release for Malcolm In The Middle, but personally I don't want to wait 3 years. I've waited long enough already. Plus, knowing 'Copyright Laws' in America, when, or if this set finally DOES come out to Blu-Ray or DVD, the original soundtrack audio will probably be replaced with different crap because the company didn't want to shell out the money to pay the original artists (that's exactly what happened in the case of Tales From The Darkside, I'm surprised Monsters had the original soundtrack). I am curious about The Wonder Years set. I have been thinking about purchasing the locker set that Time Life released, but I'm not sure if they ruined the original soundtrack, and for a show like that, it's essential to have the original soundtrack left the way it was when it aired on TV.
Even if there is a domestic release, by this time I won't even want to buy the Region 1 set, because I am fine with this set.
Sure there are no special features besides whats on the Season 1 DVD's (which are the same as the domestic release), but I don't care about that. I just want to be able to watch the show at my convenience in real DVD quality.
So besides the Region 2 coding on this set, it's perfect in my opinion. If you really love this show as much as I do, and you have some knowledge of backing DVD's up, purchase this set, back up all 22 DVD's to Region 0 and enjoy!",1429920000,12,4830,4.256800870511426
5895823,5,B00E8GPPGQ,"I don't where to even begin. This show was so good, very accurate portrayal of many families in the United States including my own, all kinds of chaotic plots per episode, an absolutely superb cast, very addicting TV show, all of the before the show starts intros to show something funny, fantastic writing and acting and just basically everything you need to create a perfect family TV show.

One of the things that makes this show so good is just how realistic this show can be displaying families with some exaggerated plots and use of materials that many may not have access to. For example, in 1 episode, Hal gets a steam-roller to crush things because he enjoys crushing things. The purpose is basically to show what would happen if you yourself actually had a steam-roller. Some of the before the TV show starts shows what almost everyone has done. In 1 episode, everyone's parents have said not to play ball in the house. In this segment, it shows what actually happens when you play baseball in the house. They naturally break something, they then say they should stop. Then Reese or Malcolm says OK, but you would have been out. They then proceed to keep playing. All of these things shown throughout this show, everyone can relate to at least 1 way or another. That is what separates 1 good show from something else.

The bottom line is that if you missed this show when it was on TV, then you have no idea what you have been missing. Any viewer of this series will easily tell you that it is worth watching at least once. On American TV, I don't think this show comes on anymore, however, it still airs in other countries. This show was never available on US-NTSC formats, it is available on PAL only. Be careful when someone says that they do have a copy of this show on US-NTSC they are trying to sell. It will be a pirated version. I did some research as to why this was never released in the US except for the first 2 seasons, it had something to do with music rights. They were not sure if this show would do well enough to cover all the rights to the content to make it profitable.

If you do not have a Region 2 PAL DVD player, then you still have options. Also, note that there is a big difference between Region 2 NTSC and Region 2 PAL. Region 2 NTSC is for Japan. Your Japanese DVD Player or Japanese PS2 will not play these discs.
Options:
-Import a PAL DVD player (cannot be from Australia, that is Region 6)
-Get a region free DVD player
-Import a European PAL Region 2 PS2 / PS3 (untested on PS4)
-The most obvious solution is just use your computer. VLC Media player does not scan regions on discs, they will play everything from everywhere. If you use Microsoft Media Players, they will allow you to switch your regions 6 times and then lock it. This affects everything DVD rom in your computer.

The only places I know this boxset was released are:
UK (Region 2 PAL)
Germany (Region 2 PAL)
Australia (Region 6 PAL)

The United States is Region 1-NTSC-U for DVD and Region A for blurays. Blurays can be multi-regioned (be able to play Regions ABC [all])",1426982400,14,3081,4.426807760141093

5895832,5,B00E8GPPGQ,"After several years apparently in legal limbo, the full TV series is at last available through an overseas outfit, and done well. If you have been looking for ""Malcolm in the Middle"", and have a DVD player that can handle Region 2 DVD's (non-US) -- and such players aren't very expensive --  you can stop reading and just get it, no worries. It was done right. Original music and even some ""extra"" scenes.

The show was originally filmed and shown in the US from 2000-2006 in a 4:3 aspect ratio picture format, before the switch to digital TV. The source material is therefore not hi-def, and can visually seem a little dark in some scenes in the first couple seasons, soft-focused in some bright scenes. This DVD series presents the episodes in 16:9 widescreen format by zooming in a bit and trimming the top and bottom, but the reframing is well done and is not noticeable without  original broadcast versions to compare with.

But such nits aren't important.  The set is professionally mastered with professional menus; select individual episodes or ""play all"".
It looks good on DVD, though the show originated in the era of VHS tapes, just as DVD was emerging ... perhaps this is why the legal framework wasn't right for US release of the whole series.

There are a few extras (which might have been on the Season One set that WAS released in the US long ago):
  - Extended Pilot episode
  - Commentary tracks for Season One episodes
  - Some blooper compilation, gag reel, some deleted scenes
  - A feature ""Malcolm in the Middle: A Stroke of Genius"" feature
  - A feature ""Dewey's Day Job: A Portrait of Erik Per Sullivan""
  - Behind the scenes sneak-preview of Season Two.

When the show first aired in 2000, I watched the first couple minutes and turned it off, repulsed by the opening scene: a very-hairy Hal standing nude in the kitchen as Lois shaved his entire body and the boys ate breakfast. It looked like some tasteless show dedicated to redefining the lowest common denominator.

Never looked at it again; avoided it for years, thinking ""yech!"" the few times the remote landed on it for a moment. But years later, I happened to pause long enough to decide the opening scene was an unfortunately placed anomaly.

The show went into reruns for a couple years after production ended, and it was possible to see the entire series digitally broadcast and even just-barely record it to computer before re-runs stopped. Have no idea if it has been showing on cable since then.

But, with this DVD set, I discovered the broadcast reruns had NOT shown the prologue scene, 90% of the time starting with the show theme & credits.  So the DVD was a nice surprise, providing a minute or two of additional comic preludes not seen before.

Even within the show, there are times when the DVD appears to show longer scenes with additional material beyond what the broadcast reruns showed. Not much, and not often, but here and there. Your mileage may vary depending on how it was edited where you were for the broadcast.

For those who haven't seen the show:

Malcom in the Middle operates on a totally different level than most TV comedies.

A typical comedy, say the currently-popular ""Big Bang Theory"", could be written by almost anyone (I could write it, even a computer could write it), following the typical sitcom formula: defined personalities trading ""one-two"" jabs ... a sentence or two to set up the joke, then a line to deliver the joke, which is usually some insult to another character. Then there is a laugh-track so the audience knows that something ""funny"" happened.

By contrast, Malcolm in the Middle is NOT about trading thin jokes and insults.  It is inspired genius, with characters and situations spinning off in ways that can't be predicted, but which manage to be extreme-yet-authentic.

The playground is defined by bullies ""carving out random spheres of influence"", who take their role seriously, trading professional tips on how to get the most leverage in a head-lock.

The teacher of the gifted class was formerly a student there, returning to teach after his dot.com failed and his net worth went from 240 million to $147. Since everyone in the class is gifted, everyone gets an A, ""but some A's are worth more than others"" and he institutes a ranking system, adjusting it moment-to-moment as the students talk. ""We have names!""  ""Yes, I know #8.""

Everything matters passionately, to kids and parents, as the kids charge head-long into misbehavior. Mother Lois observes ""They think MAYBE 2 minutes ahead; our job is to make sure reality crashes down on them in the time available"".

You have never seen a story of a teenager getting his driver's license until you have seen Reese's ...

The chaos and combativeness drives each member of the family in different ways. The delinquent Francis to military school and a series of strange jobs where he ends up a natural leader to his surprise. Reese a talented cook/bully always on the edge of being a problem for the state, Malcolm a perpetually grumpy genius who wants to be normal, and the youngest, Dewey, a gifted musician driven into an inner world by the combat with his older brothers, secretly assembling a pipe organ in the garage from house-hold debris, leading to one of the most surreal scenes of the show -- of which there were more than a few (parking lot brawl on 50-foot stilts with Uncle Sam?)

The show has plenty of heart, as Hal and Lois have a rock-solid marriage around which all the chaos revolves. The ""Flashback"" episode of Season Two gives a look at how the family developed into its current state, with Malcolm being born on the front lawn after the four-year old Francis locks his mother out of the car until she admits she is a ""poopy face"", which she will not do no matter what, preventing them from getting to the hospital.

As husband Hal drives up sipping a soda, he sees the medics and ambulances spread out on his front law, rushes up and frantically asks a neighbor lounging by a tree ""What happened?!"".  The neighbor laconically observes, ""Your wife gave birth on the lawn..."" He's seen it all before and worse with the Wilkerson's ... nothing unusual here!

One might not want Malcolm's delinquent family as neighbors, but from a safe distance you have to admire the perseverance, optimism, willingness to challenge arbitrary authority (and accept the punishment if caught), no matter what it costs them. Malcolm asks his brother Reese in astonishment: ""You don't read anything?!  Ever?!  Not even comics?  Why not?!""  Reese: ""It makes it seem like They won"".

I see the show as sort of the last gasp of the Ritalin Generation, before such exuberance and energy was routinely medicated away to produce compliance with authority.

Some shows that came afterward, like ""My Name is Earl"" and ""Raising Hope"", have similar comedic sensibilities though very different set-ups. Harry Harrison's science-fiction books on the ""Adventures of the Stainless Steel Rat"" always seemed a dead-ringer for the Francis character from MITM, all grown up.

The DVD set offers 3323 minutes of material, and while people's sense of humor varies, there is a good chance that will be 3321 minutes of continuous smiling -- taking off two minutes for the opening episode's ""full body shaving"" scene ...",1463875200,22,7292,4.802241793434748
