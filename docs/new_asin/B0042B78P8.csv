4249178,5,B0042B78P8,"Writing a critique about the Canal Plus drama, Carlos, is agonizing. The cast is perfect. The historicity of events is closest to the known record. Drama buildup is impeccable, despite the length of this three part series.

The only problem is that this great production leaves viewers in love with Carlos, a shallow demagogue, a Marxist-turned-Islamist and a gun for hire who worked for the world's most notorious secret police of Iraq, Syria, and Libya, among other oppressive regimes.

From his prison in France, Carlos today praises 9/11, Osama Ben Laden and Saddam Hussein, a stance that is absent in this movie that shows the man more of a sexy Don Juan than a human beast who justifies wholesale killings of civilians as being part of an ongoing world revolution against capitalism and imperialism.

It should be noted, however, that Carlos's brutal behavior surfaces from time to time. In Part III, he cold-bloodedly ordered the killing of a Lebanese journalist who had previously interviewed him.

The handsome Edgar Ramirez skillfully plays Carlos, the num de guerre of Illitch Ramirez Sanchez. Born to a Marxist Venezuelan father, Carlos was studying in Moscow when he was deported and found himself training with Palestinian guerilla groups in Lebanon's Bekaa valley. Carlos was recruited by Palestinian Wadih Haddad (played by Lebanese composer and singer Ahmad Kaabour), member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the mastermind of its militant network responsible for dozens of bombings and plane hijackings throughout the 1970s.

Carlos became Haddad's man in Paris, where the Venezuelan militant organized several attacks that culminated in his killing of two French police officers. Carlos was forced to flee and rejoin his master in Aden, then the capital of the Communist Southern Yemen. While there, Haddad tasked Carlos with kidnapping OPEC oil ministers at their meeting in Vienna in 1975. The operation did not go according to plan, and Haddad and Carlos departed ways thereafter, with each of them maintaining his own militant network.

Haddad died in 1978 and his network eventually disbanded. Secret services from the Soviet bloc and a few Arab countries found in Carlos a useful tool to settle scores with their opponents, and sometimes with each other like in the case of Iraqi and Syrian rivals.

With the downfall of the Soviet Union in 1990, however, the world changed, the Soviet bloc was disbanded and Carlos lost his friends. He went into hiding in Khartoum, Sudan. But his hosts eventually caved to French pressure and handed him over in 1994. He was tranquilized and flown to Paris where he was tried and sentenced to life in prison.

Carlos the movie is also a good history account of events in, or related to, the Middle East. The producers understandably air a disclaimer that, despite their research, they were forced to fictionalize part of their movie.

Still, the movie highlights several aspects of the currents that underlie the so-called liberation movements in Arab countries. More often than not, violence employed by the dictator regimes of Iraq, Syria and other tyrants aims at improving their bargaining positions with Western nations, or at settling scores with each other.

Perhaps one of the most telling similarities between then and now is the Syrian unwavering campaign to sabotage a French documentary that showed Damascus's involvement in the killing of French Ambassador to Lebanon Louis De Lamar in 1981.

Like in 1981 when Syria employed whatever violence at its disposal to prevent any leveling of accusations against its involvement, Syria in 2010 still uses all kinds of possible terror to derail a UN-created tribunal to bring to justice the perpetrators of the 2005 assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Syria is widely believed to be involved in the crime along with Lebanese partners such as Hezbollah.

Also telling is the way the Middle East changed at the time, which still apply today. Syria housed Carlos for several years. But when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1990 while the US stood on the verge of recreating a new Middle East, Syria changed course and kicked Carlos out. This should stand as a reminder to all those who believe today that Syrian troubling behavior can be changed that, absent any cataclysmic changes in the region, such as an eclipse of the rising power of Iran - Syria's staunch sponsor and ally - Damascus will never change course.

In terms of production and for those who like to dig into details, they will certainly find glitches. War-time Beirut had a different infrastructure than the one depicted in the movie, thus different sidewalks and airport landscape. And while the movie makes sure to reprint the famous red Middle East Airline ticket, for instance, actors carry the new series Lebanese passports in scenes depicting the 1970s. Also, the Sudanese police do not drive Harley Davidson motorbikes or US-made Jeeps. Lebanese security personnel do.

Such details should not derail viewers. After all, even the best-funded of Hollywood movies depicting the Middle East (such as Robert Redford and Brad Pitt's Spy Game, George Clooney's Syriana, or Steven Spielberg's Munich) commit errors. Compare Syriana with its $50 million budget and barely comprehensible spoken Arabic to Carlos, its $20 million budget and nearly impeccable use of several languages and attention to detail.",1287014400,3,5433,5.152099886492622

8413414,5,B0042B78P8,"Fascinating 5 hour plus, 3 part film about Carlos the Jackal (although
he never actually called himself that) the headline grabbing terrorist
of the 70s and 80s.

With little exposition, we're dropped into a whirlwind of violence,
self-aggrandizement, sexual seduction, and power games, moving at an
almost dizzying speed. The film allows us to slowly figure out Carlos,
instead of explain him in a simple facile way.

While never sympathetic, somehow the amazing Edgar Rameriez allows us
to feel for this id and ego driven creature, powered far more by the
need for attention and adulation (whether from women or the press) than
by true belief. Indeed, one of the most interesting things about the
film is how (intentionally) shallow and hollow Carlos's political
monologues ring.

The last 1/3 is the slowest and hardest to sit through. Carlos's slow
decline into ineffectiveness and unimportance is sometimes patience
trying. But Rob Nelson, in his excellent New York Village Voice review makes a
strong argument that this is 1) unavoidable after the high paced rush
of the first two parts and 2) part of the point of the film; without
his fixes of women and power there wasn't much to Carlos, and without
them both he and we want it to be over.

This is a film I'd like to see again. While I don't quite agree (yet)
with the many critics who have hailed this as of the best films of last
10 years, I do think it's a challenging, brilliantly acted, wonderfully
made film, that gives context both to modern terrorism and recent world
history. Add to that, an exploration of the blurring fine line between
power and uncontrolled narcissism that seems to dog leaders (especially
male) of all political stripes from Hitler to Bill Clinton to George
Bush to Carlos.

8413416,4,B0042B78P8,"Carlos is the Venezuelan revolutionary who left his university studies in Moscow in 1970 and travelled straight to Beirut to join the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. He got his nickname from the Frederick Forsyth novel ""The Day of the Jackal.""  This film is shot in three parts for television, a five-hour and 33-minute production. It is an achievement that shows the way countries use criminals to further their international goals. The film is informative, it also offers drama with excitement, suspense, and tragedy.

The film is based on research by Oliver Assayas, co-writer Dan Franck and producer Daniel Leconte. The film is presented as fiction because so much of the life of Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, who became known as Carlos, remains unknown. It spans the time from 1975 through 1994. This is a powerful film and Edgar Ramierz takes on the role of Carlos with great effectiveness. He ages from a young hot bloodied man to a middle-age businessman with a nice little pot belly, and then goes through a period when he is lean and muscular after training in Syria. His looks change as does his moustache, beard and hair, and yet he is Carlos if you take a good look.

His major operation was the OPEC raid in 1974. He and his small cadre took 42 hostages and demanded an airplane to take them to Algiers. No country wanted him to land. And, this took him to Baghdad and Tripoli before returning to Algiers. The man known as Carlos said that Marxism was his religion and that he was dedicated to the Palestinian cause.  He used his ideology primarily to dominate others. Toward the end, even his superiors in the Palestinian liberation movement were fed up with him, and after exhausting the hospitality of Libya, Syria and Iraq, he became a man without a country. He used women to feed his ego, and they seemed attracted to him. One wife had a child with him, but left him because she realized the child had no future living with Carlos.

I must say that if I was a smoker, I would have quit after viewing this film. I have never seen more smoking in a movie. Every character smokes heavily, and Carlos constantly. The smoking may have had some symbolism, but it escapes me. The smoking became a distraction.

This is a film about an individual with a flair for terrorism and some sort of feeling for revolution. I remember reading in the papers and various spy novels about Carlos over the years. He seemed a mysterious, dangerous individual, who was a killer for hire. And, that is essentially what he became. His small group that fought with him, were either imprisoned or died, and he is once again the lone Carlos waiting his time behind bars.

8413417,4,B0042B78P8,"Although the DVD is not yet available in NTSC format for the US, it is available on Netflix on demand - HD streaming to your computer, tablet or TV.

A definitive and fairly comprehensive look at the havoc and terror created by Carlos the Jackal in the 70's. Even though the 'mini-series' is almost six hours long, the pacing of the film is so good that you become totally immersed in it. Time flies as one gets mesmerized by the story, and the overall effort of the team which made it. The quality of acting, writing, directing and overall film making is simply superb. Many good things have already been written about Edgar Ramirez's portrayal of Carlos, and it is definitive no doubt, but his supporting cast deserves a lot of credit as well. The various locations are well handled, although when one sees tall green trees swaying in the background in what is supposed to be late December in Vienna, one chuckles a bit, but is soon immersed back in the story again.

The story begins after what must have been Carlos' formative years and shows him determined to become a ""soldier"" for the revolution with Europe as his base. Hints are thrown in as to his years as a student in Moscow before he embarked as a terrorist. Questions linger, was he always a KGB agent ? Did they directly or indirectly control him throughout his days as a terrorist ? He comes in contact with Wadi Haddad and takes on jobs for him, including the infamous OPEC kidnapping in Vienna. A falling out with Haddad after the OPEC incidence occurs,  followed by a detailed recruitment by and sponsorship of the Syrians, followed by more falling out and finally refuge with the Sudanese and eventual capture by the French DST in the mid-90's. All breathtakingly told, acted, and filmed.

I wish the filmmakers would have chosen to tell us even more, like the story behind all his controllers - their motivations, politically driven in-fighting amongst various mid-east intelligence agencies which may have resulted in Carlos being sponsored by so many different groups (Haddad to Syria to Libya to Iran to Sudan). What were the Western intelligence agencies doing, or not doing, about it ? It would have been speculative but the filmmakers proclaim in the beginning that they had to take many liberties anyway, a little more would have been even more fun.

The movie is extremely enjoyable, well researched and worth the viewing. It is available for online streaming in HD on Netflix, which is how I saw it.",1298937600,,2479,4.729166666666667

NOTE THAT THERE IS A VERSION THAT IS all-region NTSC (USA format) on Amazon, but you have to search for ""CARLOS JACKAL DVD"". If you just search for CARLOS DVD, it doesn't show up. This first DVD, I ended up watching on my computer. Then I bought the other one (3-disc set) and watched it again on my TV. This is a must see. The other (USA playable version) is much cheaper, and is better quality with superior packaging so I feel kinda ripped off. That is why I'm giving it only 2 stars.

8413419,5,B0042B78P8,"This film shows an early form of terrorism,an early prototype for Bin Laden,in the 1970s-1990s,a playboy Marxist/ atheist who sought fame,women,money and notoriety for his terror attacks. Terrorists do not follow stereotypes, they are individually different. This suits them. Unlike the fundamentalist terrorists of our day, he fought to increase his own status and power which translated into his obtaining more women and luxuries at each step on his way up the status hierarchy. In revenge against the Mossad attack on a PFLP leader, Mohamed Boudia, he shot Joseph Sieff,a Jewish businessman. He was recruited by the Palestinian militants. His preferred mode of attack was using bombs. Trained as an assassin,he was given the name Carlos. His disdain for human life is shown by his attacks against planes ,trains and nuclear power stations or the use of car bombs.

Carlos the Jackal tells the story of Ilich Ramrez Snchez aka Carlos the Jackal,a Venezuelan multi-linguist. The shorter version concentrates on the Latin Quarter shoot-out,killing 2 French policemen and an associate, Moukherbal,who had betrayed him. Then the terrorist attack he was most known for:his participation in the raid on the OPEC headquarters. This resulted in over 60 hostages being taken and a hostage flight through various Arab countries prior to the release of the hostages for $20 million. This shows a turning point as he sees his role change from ideologist to businessman. He also declares he's a ""soldier not a martyr"" using action not words.

He is shown as a vain,narcissist,preening naked in front of a mirror,or seducing a woman with a suggestively held grenade. He is involved with German terrorists like Magdelena Kop,who had his child. He also has problems with his testicles and seeks to get them operated on. The shortened version skips over a lot of the 80s,when we see he was in league with the communist countries as well as the Arabs,involvement with the secret service and cold war. He was involved with heads of state and the Stasi. He also made several attacks on French installations in France. We also get him adopting a changing appearance from would-be Che lookalike(at time of OPEC operation) to a pot-bellied man with love-handles. There are many close-ups,due to it being made expansively for TV in 3 episodes, as well as a smaller version made for cinematic release,and it's well researched,but to be ""regarded as a work of fiction"",according to Assayass.

With the demise of the Soviet Union,he was asked to leave Syria,due as well to new American peace initiatives in the Middle East. He ends up in Sudan,where he was finally arrested and sedated and taken back to France for trial. He was tried for the murder of the 2 French policemen and given a life sentence. This film joins many others, Che,The Baader-Meinhoff Complex,The Legend of Rita,Syriana,in demythologising and attempting to explain such figures. The film is dynamic and fluid,using post-punk music like Wire,The Lightening Seeds,Sonic Youth,New Order, conveying the kind of music he may have listened to as a maverick terrorist for-hire to Arab or cold war goverments. Prior to being caught Carlos was the invisible terrorist,who supported figures like Saddam Hussein,BinLaden and converted to Islam while in jail and also married his lawyer. Ramirez is superb in this role.",1290470400,2,3353,5.1599264705882355
8413420,4,B0042B78P8,"CARLOS is a five hour miniseries that has garnered some of the longest articles of praise from the newspapers across the country.  Technically speaking that is understandable: the shots of the various countries discussed and the quality of acting from a very broad spectrum of actors across the world is impressive.  But the story (or documentary as this is a recreation of many years of revolutionary movements that culminated in a world famous raiding encounter at the OPEC oil ministers conference in Vienna in 1975) wares thin very quickly.  Yes, it is somewhat enlightening to follow the development and actions of Ilich Ramrez Snchez, the Venezuelan revolutionary better known as 'Carlos', who founded a worldwide terrorist organization, finding his goals through hijacking of planes, capturing hostages, arranging talks with some of the major countries in the world.  But there is such a sameness to the action that after about 2 hours of the series it is difficult to wait for the central climactic drama.  Writers Dan Franck and Olivier Assayas (remembered for 'Paris, je t'aime' and 'Irma Vep' who also directs) may have taken some liberties with facts but they do deliver enough information about the birth and breeding of terrorist groups to give us all a wake-up call.

dgar Ramrez, a young Venezuelan actor fluent in many languages, is the main reason for watching this epic suspense thriller.  He is a major presence and makes 'Carlos' seem like a righteous humanitarian revolutionary - a problem when the details of the real character Carlos are examined.  He is able assisted by a strong cast  - a few of the main additional characters are played by Alexander Scheer, Alejandro Arroyo, Ahmad Kaabour, Talal El-Jordi  and Juana Acosta in addition to many many others.  But sitting through he series, especially during the long hours of lack of activity aboard a hijacked airplane with hostages for example,  begins to bog down the story. Once the idea of the story is hatched it simply becomes a long song spanning many countries and diminishes in interest. The series is due to open in theaters this week: it will be interesting to see if they play the entire 5 hours in one sitting!  Grady Harp, October 10",1287273600,,2224,4.962264150943396
