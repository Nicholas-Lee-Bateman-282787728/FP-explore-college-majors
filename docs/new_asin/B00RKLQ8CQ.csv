8695446,5,B00RKLQ8CQ,"If you are planning to make this great hike, this show is a must to help with your planning. It will make you very keen to get there and get started. If you have already made the walk, then this will make a fine souvenir. Part 2 is beautifully made also. The videography and narration are first class and you really get the feeling of the beautiful scenery and  the history of all the places en route. What it does not do is make the hike look easy, as some others do about this particular tough walk.",1421712000,,501,4.164948453608248
