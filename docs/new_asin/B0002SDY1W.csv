2117411,1,B0002SDY1W,Why is there no 'buy the entire season' option? Won't be purchasing until there is. I bought season 1-5 using the buy entire season and wonder why this is not an option for the last season.,1362355200,,189,4.277777777777778
2117412,3,B0002SDY1W,"I have bought all six seasons of Sex and the City on Amazon Instant Video. I appreciate the ease of purchase and viewing. Every season has been perfect, except season six. For the longest time there was no option to buy the entire series, only episode by episode...which is ridiculous. I waited and finally Amazon responded to the many requests to make the entire series available for purchase (thanks Amazon)! However, I am very disappointed to discover that episode three is missing. I have searched online about this and it seems that many people have discovered this and Amazon has done nothing to rectify the problem. Anyway...great show, but disappointed to have to seek out an additional episode three.",1360281600,,709,4.966386554621849
2117413,5,B0002SDY1W,"While I didn't agree with the outcome of the final episodes of this final year, there were some wonderful moments in this last season.  My favorites were the post it episode, and the episodes with Baryshnikov.  My disappointment with the last few episodes had more to do with the believability of a writer (Carrie) who would leave the U.S. for Paris without taking her computer, without planning to write, without having any kind of professional plan for herself.  I also didn't believe that a woman would so stupid as to expect anything less than total determined focus on the part of her lover in preparing his first big show in many years.  Anyone who understands the committment of artists to their work would never be that stupid -- and if Carrie didn't understand that commitment, then she is a fool -- which is a disappointing way to end the series.",1357948800,,856,4.6866666666666665
2117414,5,B0002SDY1W,My favorite season of Sex & The City.  Perfect finale to one of my favorite television shows.  Highly recommend this season.,1357257600,,124,4.857142857142857
2117415,4,B0002SDY1W,I missed the series when it was shown in the late 90s. It is smart and very funny! The actresses were great - Kim Catrell was exceptional!!!!!!,1351296000,,143,4.333333333333333
2117416,1,B0002SDY1W,I would also appreciate it if I could buy the whole season. Buying one episode at a time is ridiculous.,1349827200,,103,4.2
2117417,4,B0002SDY1W,Great season. All the episodes are fantastic. And the quality of purchasing them through Amazon Prime online was great. But where's episode 3 of Season 6?,1349654400,,154,4.961538461538462
2117418,1,B0002SDY1W,"I came online after trying to buy the 6th season on my Roku device (which I love and bought on Amazon). I thought it was strange when on my Roku I wasn't allowed to buy the whole season, like I was on every other season. My first thought was, well, maybe it is just on the Roku, so I cam online and found it to be the same. You have to buy episode by episode. Put a whole, better price on the season, like you have doen with ALL the other seasons please!",1345075200,3,454,3.89247311827957
2117419,1,B0002SDY1W,"I ordered Season 6 of Sex and the City.  When the dvd's arrived they would not play in my dvd player.  When I contacted the seller he said it clearly states that I ordered ""region 2"" dvd.  I have bought many dvd's and have never had to look to see what ""region"" it is coming from.  I am in the U.S. and it came from the U.S. so I would assume it is valid in the U.S.  I think this seller is being deceiving in assuming a normal American buyer would know that there is a difference.  I have asked numerous people and nobody has heard of ever having to ask.  And the icing on the cake when I return it, I get to pay for shipping TWICE and I still have no dvd set.  Total crock.",1341446400,5,675,3.875912408759124
2117460,5,B0002SDY1W,"I love the "" episodes with the Russian"" especially the last one!

I am so glad I bought all of the seasons on Amazon, because they're all ""uncut"".
I never realized how much is cut out of the episodes that are on TV (the re-runs). As I started watching each Amazon episode, there were all these extra conversations and scenes that they don't show on TV, and you get all ""raw verbage"" from the girls with no ""bleeps"" or substitute wording (be careful if you have children around while you're watching it!). I've watched the TV episodes probably 50 times each over the years, and never realized how much they cut-out of each show until I watched the Amazon versions.

2117725,5,B0002SDY1W,"Every single woman who has purchased baby and wedding gifts galore for their friends will appreciate this episode. When Carrie feels she has been ""shoe shamed"", her spunkiness comes out in full force!! :)",1384819200,,204,5.029411764705882
2117726,5,B0002SDY1W,I loved it. It makes me wish I had watched the show during its original run. A truly romantic episode.,1379548800,,102,4.15
2117727,5,B0002SDY1W,This is the final (and probably the best) episode of Sex and the City. Carrie's dresses are amazing....and *sigh* Big!,1376006400,,118,4.95
2117728,5,B0002SDY1W,"I love this series. When it was on HBO I couldn't get enough of it. It shows how women can flirt and pick up guys
just like the guys do.",1375401600,,136,3.566666666666667
2117729,5,B0002SDY1W,I chose this rating because this TV series is awesome.  I like the price of the episode.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Sex and the City.,1371168000,,150,4.137931034482759

2117731,5,B0002SDY1W,"If you're already a fan of Sex and the City from the movies or previous seasons, you'll of this - its the best season.  It's still edgy, funny, and clever - but now its also incredibly touching!",1365811200,,194,4.243243243243243
8031321,1,B0002SDY1W,"The season won't play on our DVD players. It has a certain code and when looking that code up, it states that it can only be played on certain DVD players in other countries. Worthless actually. Wouldnt even give it one star!",1516924800,,225,4.380952380952381
8031322,5,B0002SDY1W,"I loved this. I never watched the show back then because I was too busy raising my kids. Glad I could catch it here. I know it's fiction, but I love how it discussed real-life issues of various sorts and I love how she summed it all up in her article... The woes of dating and finding love mean so much to me. It gives me hope that one day I may find love-since my marriage only lasted 2 years, but I am very thankful for my family. I went to the theatre to see the movie and would go if there was a new one. I like that they are cheery-especially Charlotte. So many characters to love on this show.",1516406400,,599,3.958677685950413
8031323,4,B0002SDY1W,I love ordering used DVDs. It's a really cheap alternative. All the discs in this order worked perfectly. The case was a little worn but for the price I didn't mind. It was delivered on time too.,1507334400,,195,4.297297297297297
8031324,2,B0002SDY1W,"Although I've watched this show over a number of years, usually when I'm under the weather, I find it totally unrealistic concerning Carrie's character. She works for a rag paper and yet she always wears fabulous and expensive clothes and shoes and eats out all the time. How can she afford all this and still have a roof over her head? From what former New York friends have shared, rents in New York City are astronomical. I find it unrealistic and silly.",1502928000,,457,4.585365853658536
8031325,3,B0002SDY1W,"Baryshnikov with Sarah Jessica Parker?  He must have really needed a gig, because the scenes with Sarah Jessica Parker were too pathetic and awkward to watch. It was like bringing Tempier Bandol '69 to a redneck picnic with pimento cheese sandwiches.  'Carrie' behaved like a total unsophisticated dolt: completely out of her element -- not that she was EVER sophisticated with all the hair extensions, the grunge inspired tees, and the weird mole on her face.  At least the costumers were able to score gorgeous designer clothing and Manolos for SATC.  And she wondered why Big never introduced her to his mother?  Then we have the unbelievably BAD MISS, when the show stupidly paired handsome and suave Blair Underwood with awkward lesbian Cynthia Nixon, only to return Ms. Harvard Law to a Scooby Doo-reading bartender with whom she had a baby out of wedlock.  Next we have beyond skanky Cougar Samantha with young superstar Smith Jarrod, a kid 20 something years her junior, who was wasting his youth in a situation which was just twisted and inappropriate.  And finally we have the stupid adoption and conception-challenged story line between Harry and the always over-acting, overly optimistic, Charlotte.  Then they had the nerve to make 2 films after this useless series went in to neverland.
This show started out as something interesting for HBO - something that broke the rules back in its day.  However, every good thing must end, and instead of going out on a high note, this went out like a bad cartoon.  The writers got bored, the storylines suffered.  Good Riddance.",1501372800,,1582,4.954545454545454
8031326,1,B0002SDY1W,Horrible! Doesn't work at all,1501113600,,29,5.0
8031327,5,B0002SDY1W,"I absolutely love this show. I love Carrie but i do not support her relationship with Big, it is beautiful love but it is also abusive. I really do hope he has changed. And how she treated Adrian was messed up, i was glad to see he got a happy ending too. Samantha is by far my favorite character in the whole show, she is real and raw and her confidence is so attractive. Charlotte is sweet, i like her too and my worst character is definitely Miranda, i like that she is a career woman that knows what she wants and is strong but then again, i hate that she does not let go, even a little bit and give up control, she eventually learned that with Steve and i was glad. Carrie can be self centered and thinks the whole world revolves around her but their friendship is beautiful and i hope i find friendship like that.

Amazing show!",1495929600,,834,4.180124223602484
