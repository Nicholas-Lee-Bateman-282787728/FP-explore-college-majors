7795847,2,0767849833,"This DVD collection is entitled, 'Starter Pack,' a name that suits it well.  The movies enclosed will suit each member of most families, or at least that's the way this pack should have been.  Sleepless in Seatle, starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, is the basic women's movie filled with the type of plot and comedy that will keep you occupied without really entertaining you.  Godzilla, is the type of movie the whole family can usually watch, (except for very young children) where once again the giant dinosaur is attacking.  The Mask of Zorro is similar to Godzilla in family appeal.  Also, marking the major film debut of Catherine Zeta-Jones, it is a more teenager-friendly movie than the others in the series.  Finally, Ghostbusters is a classic film the whole family can enjoy, filled with above-average humor and the kind of plot young kids can even understand.  The features on Ghostbusters make it a more worthwhile purchanse than the others, and the price on this package doesn't produce much of a disscount over buying the movies sepertely.  If you enjoy all of these movies, this is a nice way for you to save a few dollars.  Otherwise, buy The Mask of Zorro or Ghostbusters seperately on DVD, they're the only two movies in this set that are really worth purchasing.  This starter pack also does not contain any movie that really displays the power of DVD.  If you have just bought a DVD player and want to see what it can really do, instead of buying this package, buy The Matrix, Fight Club, and the Disney version of Robin Hood (for young kids to enjoy).  These will not only show you how great DVD's can be, but will cover spectrum age-wise when it comes time to watch a DVD.  Also, buying those three movies seperately is a much better way to spend your money than buying this package.",981936000,10,1803,4.632075471698113
