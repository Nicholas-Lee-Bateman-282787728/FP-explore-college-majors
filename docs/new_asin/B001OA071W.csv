8330004,1,B001OA071W,The music is derivative but you may wonder derivative of whom? There's the problem. the music is derivative of many derivatives that serve as acoustic shadows to films displaying characters getting up from chairs before deciding to sit down again. The costumes and sets would be impressive for a prediction put on by a fifth grade class. The sneezing episode of one character might make a kindergarten child spiral into a fit of an uncontrollable laugh provided s/he was mentally challenged. Amazon will take it back for $ 1.50 which is generous.,1388793600,2,546,4.945652173913044
8330005,3,B001OA071W,"This isn't one of my favorite operas by any means.  The production is OK, but, of course, I preferred the local Minnesota Production and cast.",1372032000,,142,4.68
8330006,5,B001OA071W,"Pinocchio was Dove's 21st opera and was intended to be, in his own words, an `opera for the family' with an intended appeal range from young to old. It must be stated that this laudable aim has met with considerable success. This recorded production is taken from Opera North which premiered it to considerable acclaim.

The story is well known and the opera is told in 20 fairly short sections reduced from the original story's 36 chapters. The composer's musical style is essentially lyrical which makes it easy to listen to. Beyond that it is possible to detect possible influences that may have applied. To my mind I would suggest that there are flavours of Benjamin Britten and Leonard Bernstein. The writing is expert and is interesting enough to hold the attention without becoming offensively extreme in its modernity. The characterisation throughout is both imaginative and interesting with lots of effective musical textures to constantly engage the attention.

The lead parts of Pinocchio, Geppetto, The Blue Fairy, Cricket plus the other 14 listed character parts are all expertly sung and performed. There are simply too many of excellence to describe fully in a review such as this. Suffice it to say that there is not a weak moment anywhere and that includes the outstanding chorus. It is difficult to imagine any of this being better performed or produced than that which is presented here.

The recording values are equally excellent. The camera work is crisp, detailed and totally involving. The sound is presented in full-toned surround sound and stereo which reproduce both the singers and orchestra with superb clarity and cohesiveness.

This is a modern opera with wide appeal, a strong narrative line, skilful music and a libretto which, in this case, includes a good deal of humour. The audience's amusement can clearly be heard during the section where Pinocchio's nose gets longer! The final applause is justly enthusiastic and is a good guide to its success.

In summary therefore, it seems reasonable to give this popular new opera recording the full 5 stars. It should give a great number of newcomers a great deal of enjoyment, and for those who have attended the live performances, a fine memento of an enjoyable occasion.",1343088000,,2253,5.029490616621984
8330007,4,B001OA071W,"Jonathan Dove's music was exciting and (as it should be) the truly driving force behind this delightful opera!  The familiar story was emboldened with not only a more accurate telling to its original spirit but with such exciting orchestration, it was able to accomplish what few operas for families and young people have been able to do: provide real drama including exciting twist and turns, humor, and the all too often missing scary bits!  There are, of course, problems, such as issues with the overly saccharine rhyme here and there, the almost overly obscene tonality of it all, but with such smart direction, and (again) lush and percussive orchestration, it works much more than it ever fails.  It makes this opera lover wish the piece were being performed in his city!  Well worth the add to one's collection!",1302825600,2,819,4.913043478260869
8330008,5,B001OA071W,"The libretto is based on the original story (and not the sanitized Disney version) which makes it much richer and profound. Although the story seems to be about the adventures of a puppet miss-behaving, in reality it is a story about the love between father and son. Pinocchio gets into various adventures as a result of others inciting him there, while he wants to help his father; and Geppetto getting himself into trouble while searching for his son. The theatrical staging is just wonderful, simple and sophisticated leaving your imagination to complete the scene. It is very very effective. The music and the words are really one, making it easy to understand and enjoy. The singers are first rate in their voices and acting, and act they do!! If opera is the blending of music, words, acting and staging this opera with this production is it.
Don't be scared by the fact it is a new opera. It is interesting and enjoyable for kids as well as adults. Highly recommended.",1250467200,5,975,4.741176470588235
8330009,4,B001OA071W,"Those of you who only know Pinocchio from the much-simplified Disney version are in for a real treat.  This fine opera sets the entire story by Carlo Collodi (just released in a new translation by New York Review Books) and so gives new depth and substance to the familiar tale.  Dove's music, an amalgam of Janacek, Britten, Stravinsky, Bernstein, Broadway, and even Gilbert & Sullivan can rather overdo the minimalist staccato brass and percussion figures, but charms nonetheless.  Those who have suggested that the opera be trimmed and shortened in deference to a child's short attention span misunderstand what the composer & librettist are trying to do.  In any event, this piece is just as much for adults as children.

The production itself is splendidly inventive.  The modest stage area is used is used with great originality, and the set design and costumes are wonderful.  The cast is excellent, and sing and act with energy, fine voices, and clear diction, making the subtitles unnecessary. Much of the music is whimsical and quite simple by operatic standards, but one or two numbers approach the power that Benjamin Britten could summon in his best works.  This composer could clearly go on to bigger things.

Finally, the Blu-ray itself is reference-quality, as sharp and colorful as any I have seen.  This is a winsome piece sure to charm the most jaded opera viewer as well as those who don't think they like opera at all.",1240185600,10,1439,4.909090909090909
