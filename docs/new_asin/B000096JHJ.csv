7989826,1,B000096JHJ,"This film is one of those commercials, you have to pay to watch. Luckily, I got it as an extra film with another film on DVD, so I did not have to pay a cent.

This film essentially features old film material from navy SEAL training, along with some narration. The focus of the film is on BUDS training, which stands for Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL. Basically, what they tell you is that in order to get into a SEAL team, you have to be in good shape, and be extremely tough mentally.

If you can avoid it, don't buy this film. Even if you get if free, you still waste 30 minutes from your life by watching the film.
