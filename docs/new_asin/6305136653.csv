This 1958 thriller starred John Carradine, famous actor and father of David, Keith, etc., of the Carradine family of actors also known as ""The Voice"" due to his deep baritone, which vibrates nicely in this film.

Also the screenwriter Arthur C. Pierce is also known for his horror film scripts such as Women of the Prehistoric Planet in the 1960s and some Fantasy Island TV scripts in the 1970s and many horror film scripts The Navy vs. the Night Monsters (1966) (uncredited) ; The Las Vegas Hillbillys (1966); Mutiny in Outer Space (1965) (uncredited); The Human Duplicators (1965) (uncredited), etc. etc.!

Herbert Greene directed, and per IMDB seems it is the only film he did direct.  He had worked as an associate director with  William Castle on Strait Jacket (1964) with Joan Crawford as an axe murderess (on Netflix!).

The cool black & white ""so bad it's good"" British-made film starts out with a certificate from the British Board of Film Censors.  Relief!

And then we have a rooster crowing to the words Association of British Pathe, distributors!  (This was a funny reminiscence of MGM's lion.)

Anyway, a UFO is being tracked by radar.  Suddenly, a giant beach ball has settled in the valley, floating on its own.

Scientist (Carl Sorenson) is interesting in the knowledge it will bring.  Colonel Matthews though is interested in the military advantages and snickers behind his back, ""You know how these civilians are!""  Oh, brother.

Strange things start happening around town as the Cosmic Man floats around checking out the town.  Scantily clad women scream at the sight.  Fat men call the cops and cars are zipping everywhere.  This is a good photographic point here, the black & white at night, no dialogue and melodramatic music.  Cool stuff.

There is a bit of mild soap opera that is quickly dropped, no doubt due to the wooden acting of Angela Greene, who at times reacts little and other times overreacts.  Quite odd.  Her little boy is disabled and may not live a year.

As the story progresses, we learn of the military's plan to knock off the Cosmic Man and his beach ball.  CM then presents himself (without the earlier disguise -- he's also a guest at the motel-- ) and states his purpose, to check out the humans and urge them to change their murderous ways before they can become one with the intergalactic community.

The general there thinks this is a bunch of hooey; his pals come out with guns blazing -- women scream!  as CM laughs at bullets.  CM also warns that no one should try to stop him upon departure.

Later that night, while Scientist urgently works towards helping out CM, CM dons his human disguise and plays chess with our little boy.  He's no Will Robinson (Billy Mumy) and has none of that ""gee whiz"" air, though he tries hard enough.

And the story goes.  Very similar in many respects to Day the Earth Stood Still.

Recommended.  Another fine B-Film gem.",1245110400,9,2919,4.739562624254473

972650,3,6305136653,"While watching The Cosmic Man, I couldn't help but notice the extreme similarities to the much better movie, The Day The Earth Stood Still, which was released eight years prior in 1951.  The movie's main star, John Carradine, plays the enigmatic cosmic man.
Anyway, this low budget movie starts with reports from various locations on the Earth of a mysterious, flying object.  This object, which turns out to be a giant, interstellar gumball, lands in a place called Bronson Canyon, a place many movie fans may recognize as it was used quite often throughout the years in such movies as Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), Robin Hood (1922), and The Searchers (1956), to name a few.  Well, the giant, space gumball doesn't really land, but hovers in one spot, never actually touching the ground.  The theory of anti-gravity is posed, and I am sure this probably sounded a lot cooler back in 1959 than it does now, almost fifty years later.
The military tries to throw a blanket of secrecy over this astounding event, but word gets out in the local community anyway, as they have a party line phone system.  The military does cordon off the area, and a scientist, the renowned Dr. Karl Sorenson, one of the scientists involved in the creation of the atomic bomb, is called in to help decide what to do with the enigmatic candy-like object from space. (I'm serious, every time I saw this ship, I thought it was the world's largest jawbreaker.)  We soon see the appearance of a plot thread so worn it's transparent as the civilian scientist has a ideology clash with the head military types in that the military believes this could be the beginning of an invasion (which is quite sensible and reasonable, in my opinion), and the possibilities of new technology to create newer, more powerful weapons.  The civilian scientist is more concerned with knowledge and believes if beings from space possessed the power of interstellar travel, they could surely wipe the humans out easily.  His speculation leads him to think this ship and whatever occupants it may contain are here for more peaceful purposes.
Soon an unnoticed beam on light emits from the space object, and the Cosmic Man makes his appearance...sort of.  He is somewhat invisible, but makes an inordinate amount of sound moving around, so we know he's there.  Later he does appear in a shadowy form, kind of see though, like the plot, and then later he shows up in a very solid form in clothes he stole from someone.  This cosmic man fluctuates between these three states of being, based on his mood, I guess.  I think some reason was given as to why, but I was still trying to wrap my mind around the concept of this notion of anti-gravity, so I probably missed it.
Well, the military starts to try and move the space ship, to no avail, and then tries to break into the ship, again, with no luck, while the scientist gathers clues to support that there was an inhabitant of the ship, and he has left and is now walking about freely.  Things go on this way for awhile, and there is a sort of subplot involving a widowed woman and her disabled son that was really corny.  Events finally do come to a head as the cosmic man makes his appearance known, and the military leaders become hostile at what they don't know or understand.  A great effort was spent basically showing how ignorant the military and the average civilian is when it comes to the unknown compared against the value of what could be learned by those in the altruistic scientific community.
Does the cosmic man come in peace?  Or does he herald an invasion of unstoppable flesh eating aliens out to steal our women?  The print presented by Image Entertainment looks great, but there are no extras except for a few trailers.  Oh yeah, there are many sort of unintentionally funny moments in this movie, but my favorite was when someone would mention the main female character's deceased husband and she would get this far away look on her face.  I think it was supposed to represent longing and remembrance, but it appeared to me as a momentary lapse of brain function.  Not a bad sci-fi movie, but not a great one, either, as it's plagued with wooden performances, predictable and corny plots, and a ham fisted delivery of a message I already got from a much better movie made eight years prior to this release.",1074816000,2,4338,4.660550458715596
972651,2,6305136653,"A rather obvious rip-off of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, this dreary SF effort gives us John Carradine as a grim wise guy (oops, I mean wise man) from another planet who arrives on Earth to give us the usual warning, while befriending a child as a sideline.  His spaceship looks like a giant golf ball, and his major weirdness is that he often appears in negative form.  Carradine is good in the title role, but the film is otherwise a dud.",1033257600,3,442,4.313253012048193
972652,4,6305136653,"Cosmic Man exists in that netherworld of zero-budget SF schlock (e.g., Astounding She Monster, Teenagers from Outer Space, Beast of Yucca Flats) wherein the lack of funds precludes any real special effects or exciting action, yet somehow a uniquely warped atmosphere is established that invites contemplation by dedicated bad-film fanatics. This was the freshman screenplay of cheesy-SF writer Arthur C. Pierce, who later penned mostly-boring 1960s ""sci-fi"" duds Destination Inner Space, Cyborg 2087, Dimension 5, etc., and also directed the far more interesting if even schlockier Navy vs. the Night Monsters, Women of the Prehistoric Planet, and Las Vegas Hillbillys. The plot steals shamelessly from The Day the Earth Stood Still, adapting the latter's ambitious `peacenik scientists vs. military hawks' thematics to accomodate shoestring production values. Second-and-last-time director Herbert Greene had been assistant director on Invisible Invaders, The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake, and the Lone Ranger TV series. Lyn Osborn (Invasion of the Saucer Men, Space Patrol) and Ken Clayton (Johnnie in Lost Lonely and Vicious) both play Air Force sergeants here. Their radar station, while already tracking a UFO, receives a report of an 8-foot diameter silver hovering metallic sphere (""looks like a satellite"") from forest rangers in nearby Stone Canyon. Astrophysicist Dr. Sorensen (Bruce Bennett, AKA Herman Brix, former 1930s Tarzan) is called in from the Pacific Technical Institute by slimy Colonel Mathews (Paul Langton; The Snow Creature, Incredible Shrinking Man, Invisible Invaders) to figure out exactly what to do with the big shiny golf ball. They use as their base of operations a nearby lodge (housing a beautiful Rock-Ola jukebox) owned by war-widow Kathy Grant (Angela Greene; Night of the Blood Beast, Tickle Me) whose wheelchair-bound son Kenny just happens to have read all of Dr. Sorensen's books (""he discovered omicron radiation!"") and is an aspiring astrophysicist himself. Lots of meaningless technobabble concerning antigravity ensues, and the Colonel tries to put the make on Mrs. Grant, ick! The cosmic man (John Carradine) shows up (as basically a black, nearly featureless shadow) and proceeds to wreak havoc, accompanied by enigmatic silent vignettes, stock footage of police cars, and even some half-baked cheesecake. Then, in a bit seemingly borrowed from The Invisible Man, he shows up in humanoid form, bundled up in a parka, alpine hat, and weird X-Ray Spex-ish glasses, checks into the lodge right under everyone's noses, and hangs out playing chess with little Kenny in his bedroom! Meanwhile, the military men and scientists can't budge the floating ball, so Colonel Mathews, Dr. Sorensen, and Kenny (!?) have a lengthy debate on how to catch the cosmic man, brush up on some basic astronomical trivia, and discuss Dr. Sorensen's guilt over contributing to the bombing of Hiroshima (!!). It all winds up at Bronson Canyon, as these things often do, for the miraculous and hokey denouement. Not exactly a laugh-a-minute bad-film atrocity, Cosmic Man still has the twisted logic, awkward pacing, and strange, Woodian dialogue (""Here, Colonel, have a mint"") that trash film junkies crave. Kind of like an ""SF"" episode of Father Knows Best, or a really poverty-stricken companion piece to Invaders from Mars or perhaps Giant Gila Monster (try it!). Mainstream movie fans beware!
Yet another entry in Image's Wade Williams Collection, Cosmic Man looks terrific on DVD. Apparently transferred from a British release print (it opens with the BBFC certificate and Associated British Pathe logo) the film looks virtually pristine, with excellent black level, contrast, brightness, sharpness, and shadow/highlight detail. Physical damage is limited to only some very light speckling and blemishing. I haven't a clue what the negative reviewer below is complaining about, unless Image actually dug up a far superior print and remastered the disc within the last two years (which seems unlikely). It really looks beautiful overall, especially for such a no-budget stinker. The included Cosmic Man trailer (narrated by Paul Frees) is also pretty crisp, with very good tonal values, but exhibiting some light scratching, lining, speckling, and blemishing. Twelve chapter stops and five bonus WWC trailers are the only other extras, but for bad-cinema lovers this is a pretty solid set for the money. ""Goodbye, cosmic man.""",1031529600,9,4451,5.461538461538462

After a lot of UFO sightings, a giant floating golf ball parks itself in a canyon.  What is it?  Where does it come from?  Was anything or anyone inside of it?  Scientists and the military cant agree on its purpose.  Scientists want to study it; the military want to see if it has any applications they might put to use.  Is it a weapon?  Can it be a weapon?  Lets haul it away and pick it apart at our leisure.  But it cant be hauled away and it becomes quite noisy when provoked.  And why does everyone hear footsteps when theres no one there?  Soon, everyone starts seeing a shadow man.  EEK!  It was horrible!  Dogs howl, women scream when they spy it spying in their windows (this is why you have curtains!).  But the shadow man is ever so helpful.  He corrects a diagram a scientist was careless to leave out in the open.  Finally, he speaks.  Hes decided that hes seen enough and he wants to go home.  Sounds reasonable to me but the military sees it otherwise.

So much and yet so little happens in this 72 minute film.  The best thing it has going for it is John Carradine as Cosmic Man.  That fabulous voice.

972811,4,6305136653,"WATCH THE SKIES! is a hit and miss collection of three minor sci-fi entries. Movie #1> THE COSMIC MAN- A UFO crash-lands on Earth, causing great concern for the military. A scientist is called in to examine the craft. He discovers a free-floating orb, hovering about six feet off the ground. Of course, the Colonel in charge sees it as a weapon, or a way to dominate space travel. Unbeknownst to anyone, a visitor from another world (John Carradine- INVISIBLE INVADERS, THE ASTRO ZOMBIES, THE HOWLING) has come via the orb. Why is he here? What does he want? At first, he spends his time as a shadow-figure (a cropped-in negative), silently creeping about, causing panic. Eventually, he takes on a more ""human"" appearance. Trouble starts when the military attempts to take control of the spaceship. Soon, THE COSMIC MAN reveals his agenda. This is another movie that owes a great deal to THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Movie #2> THE FLYING SAUCER- An international playboy (Mikel Conrad) and his nurse (Pat Garrison) are sent to a cabin in Alaska to learn the secrets behind THE FLYING SAUCER. Things bog down to a crawl, as the movie turns into a nature film. Absolutely nothing of interest occurs until 40+ minutes into the ""action"". In the meantime, we are treated to endless footage of the Alaskan hinterlands! While not a bad story, there's just too much padding, turning this into one looonng, dull experience! Movie #3> STRANGER FROM VENUS- Pretty much the British version of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, it contains many similar elements, including an alien visitor (Helmut Dantine) w/ an agenda / ultimatum for the wayward Earthlings. It even co-stars Patricia Neal (THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL) as the alien's only human friend! Certainly, STRANGER FROM VENUS is a smaller, lower-budgeted film, but it still manages to get its point across. So, this three movie set has two good movies and one that could have been much better.

972992,3,6305136653,"Overall I am happy with these movies, however the picture & sound quality could be improved. Obviously they weren't properly restored before being transferred to the discs. I would have preferred to know about this prior to ordering them, but they could be worse.

As for the movies themselves, I rate them as follows:

""The Cosmic Man"" - 7/10, a decent film with spooky atmosphere.

""The Flying Saucer"" - 5/10, somewhat slow & tedious. It starts off as a kind of romantic comedy with a little suspense & action right at the end. Thankfully.

""Stranger from Venus"" - 8/10, an obvious remake of ""The Day the Earth stood still"", but surprisingly creepy & thoughtful. Overall, my favourite of the 3 movies.",1350172800,4,703,4.785123966942149

973070,3,6305136653,"""The Cosmic Man"" (1958) B&W:  If you are Dr. Sorenson, famed Astrophysicist, you have the opportunity of a lifetime: to study a UFO; it had landed in a nearby canyon.  You are the first to arrive.  It is not a flying saucer, but a featureless levitating, 6 foot wide white ball.  Probably too small to carry any creatures, probably an interstellar probe.  But later mysterious things happen and then, in the dim lamp light at the lodge, an uncertain silhouette of a man appears . . . .
Comments: Much technical jargon spouted by Dr. Sorenson; all of it meaningless.  The most entertaining is his speculation on a new theory of gravity, with the purpose to explain the UFO's anti-gravity lift.
Picture (DVD): 3.  Sound: volume low.  Subtitles: none.  Extras: trailers.

""The Flying Saucer"" (1949) B&W:  If you are Hank, you've got a problem.  A Russian spy ring, operating in the Territory of Alaska, had been infiltrated by your agent; he has since disappeared, but before he did, he reported the Russians believe a flying saucer is operating out of an area near the Taku glacier.  Fortunately Mike's father owns a hunting lodge there, unfortunately Mike is not an agent, he is a playboy, fond of drinking and doesn't take this seriously.  So you send agent Vee along; it will be a tough job keeping Mike in line; there will be times when she wishes she could muzzle him . . . .
Comments: Slow paced, at times feels more like an Alaskan travelogue than a spy-versus-spy flick.
Picture: 3, flecks, streaks.  Sound: volume low, coarse-most noticeable in the music.  Subtitles: none.  Extras: trailers.

""Stranger From Venus"" (1954) B&W:  If you are the man with no name who walked into an old English Inn one evening, you have a simple mission: tell the Earth creatures, you find there, to bring the representatives of the world's governments to a nearby clearing 2 days from now to receive a gravely important message from Venus.  You expected compliance, unfortunately you had not anticipated the duplicitous, self-serving behavior of human politicians . . . .
If you are Arthur, you are a powerful politician.  You are in love with Susan; she's afraid and asks you to let her leave.  You assure her, she has nothing to fear; but you misunderstand her fear: she is afraid of falling in love with the Venusian . . . .

A mysterious object is found in Bronson Canyon (a real location used in the filming of ""Robot Monster"" 1953). Naturally the military is antsy and request a top scientist Dr. Karl Sorenson (Bruce Bennett) investigate.

All the elements are there with the three-way love interest between the widowed mother Kathy Grant (Angela Greene) of a crippled kid Ken (Scotty Morrow), scientist Dr. Sorenson and military Col. Matthews (Paul Langton.) They must speculate on the good bad and ugly of their mysterious invader (John Carradine).

An added plus is the fun of seeing the technology of the time this film was made. And a vintage look at the Griffith Park Observatory. Too bad they did not show the inside as there is a nifty pendulum that swings with the rotation of the earth.

7883891,2,6305136653,"A weird, offbeat collection of three 1950's sci-fi cheapies, at least two of them strongly influenced by the 1951 classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still.""  Indeed, one of them, ""Stranger from Venus,"" even used the same female star, Patricia Neal, in the same role, as the war widow who befriends an alien from outer space (Helmut Dantine in the role Michael Rennie played in the earlier film) and tries to get the rest of humanity to understand him. ""Stranger from Venus"" isn't much of a movie (and one wonders why, when it takes place in England, the cars are set up with left-hand steering wheels for U.S. instead of British roads) but it's still better than the other two movies here. ""The Cosmic Man"" is yet another ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" knockoff with John Carradine as the sympathetic alien this time, and while it's a much better movie than his horrible ""The Unearthly"" from two years earlier it's still a major comedown for him. And ""The Flying Saucer"" -- the first film ever made using that phrase -- is a cheat in which the titular aircraft isn't even from outer space: it's a terrestrial machine invented by a scientist in Alaska and the gimmick is the U.S. and an unnamed sinister foreign power (though given that this was made in 1950 at the start of the Cold War it's not hard to guess whom they meant) are both after the design. It's the sort of movie in which it's easy to tell who the spies are by the way they slink around and hunch down when they eavesdrop on people through half-open doors, and the only reason to watch it is the stunning nature footage of Alaska used as a backdrop for the silly things the action are doing. Nothing here is either as good as ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" or as so-bad-it's-good campy as Ed Wood's own ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" knockoff, ""Plan Nine from Outer Space.""
