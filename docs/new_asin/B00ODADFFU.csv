8683271,5,B00ODADFFU,"Schizophrenia is a disease that most Americans know very little about. Schizophrenia is such a complex mental disease that it is quite difficult even to explain and discuss with those who are uneducated about the disease. Symptoms are varied and each person is affected differently. In A BEAUTIFUL MIND, Ron Howard has pulled off an Oscar-worthy job of exploring one man's struggle with the disease through the life of Nobel Prize winner, John Nash. The film skips a great deal of Nash's life. However, in the two and a half hours that the movie runs, the audience is caught up in the life and mentality of Nash. No film can truly do justice to a person's life and achievements. However, movies can educate and inform us of greatness within our midst that would go otherwise unnoticed. A BEAUTIFUL MIND is such a film. Contrary to what some have suggested, the film deals with schizophrenia in a tasteful and thoughtful manner, illumining the audience to the false reality that schizophrenics exist within.

Russell Crowe is once again superb and has earned another Oscar nomination with his performance of Nash. Though he is quickly becoming a matinee-idol type star, films like this continue to illustrate his skill and display that he has become one of Hollywood's elite not solely because of his looks (aka Tom Cruise), but because of his talent.

Jennifer Connelly also pulls of an Oscar-worthy performance as Nash's wife. I've been a fan of Connelly since her early days starring in LABYRINTH and it's great to finally see her beginning to receive the recognition she deserves. She more than holds her own against the strong charisma of Russell Crowe.

The movie does not have a great deal of time to deal with the relationship between Nash and his wife. Nevertheless, the film briefly touches upon their relationship without becoming sappy.

Overall, a wonderful movie with great acting, exploring the horror of schizophrenia and the power of love.",1415232000,,1955,4.951219512195122
