The ""swans way reprise""  is a beautiful slowed rendition of "" into a swan""  preformed, mainly to a piano.",1431561600,,303,4.375
8345837,5,B001VAF6RA,"If you have to make a choice of post-Banshees DVDs, this concert is just so much better than the Dreamshow Siouxsie video with the full orchestra.  Everything about this is better, the setlist, the camera work, the audience energy.  Siouxsie looks great and she plays to advantage her vocal limitations (she's settled into a huskier deeper voice than when the Banshees were together).  She seems to be having more fun and the costumes/outfits give her more freedom of movement than the ones in the earlier video.  And here we do not focus on the drummer too, nobody paid for that, they wanna see the talent.  Don't get me wrong, Budgie's a good drummer but that's not what we came to see.",1407542400,5,688,4.652892561983471
