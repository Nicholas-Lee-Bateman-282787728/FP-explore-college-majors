8189184,3,B000P6R570,"These past years have seen the works of Italian genre Director Fernando Di Leo gracing our US monitors with no less than two box sets representing his best work.  This release from New Star Video is ,however, entirely another matter.  After the release of his excellent 'SHOOT FIRST, DIE LATER' aka 'IL POLIZIOTTO E MARCIO'-1974, he decided to blend the crime drama with a comedy sex farce with painful results.  'LOADED GUNS' aka 'COLPO IN CANNA'  is one of those Euro titles which sunk many genres including the Spaghetti Western by trying to mix dead serious themes with slapstick comedy( the 'TRINITY'  films are a good example) .  The results are extremely painful too watch in these modern times and does not represent Di Leo's best efforts.  The beautiful Ursula Andress who was no stranger to these types of films having made many in Italy at that time tries to bring dignity to her role by playing it straight bouncing off the films insanity by vamping up her character.  Di Leo takes full advantage of Ursula 's assets and this is what saves the film.  Along for the ride is Woody Strode who found himself in Europe and worked with Di Leo and other Euro Directors but is just wasted here.  The Music score by Luis Enriquez Bacalov is as hectic as the films pace.  More bad news is that New Star Video used an inferior print and presents it in a full screen faded slightly fuzzy transfer and English dubbed.  Their is no pan and scan so the image is dead on making some of the characters invisible in some shots as they spout their dialogue. The only extra is a still gallery of frame blowups from the fuzzy transfer. Recommended for Ursula Andress fans (nudity abounds) and for Euro completists only.",1421280000,,1710,4.6072607260726075
8189185,5,B000P6R570,Apart from flashes of Ursula Andress naked I thought this a total waste of money. If you are an Ursula fan you may be interested but otherwise save your money and buy another title.,1300579200,4,181,4.352941176470588
