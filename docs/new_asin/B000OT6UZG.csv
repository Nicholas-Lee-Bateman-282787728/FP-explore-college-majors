2799414,5,B000OT6UZG,"I have to say this film caught me by suprise, not only is it a great little horror film, but also has a lot to say about modern society, and its dangers on people who are least able deal with them. I won't go into the plot as you realy have to see it for yourself, and knowing too much may spoil the film for you. I will warn some people... This film is NOT Hollywood Mainstream stuff, so if your looking for big effects, big name actors and lots of eye candy, KEEP LOOKING.
I realy couldn't fault the movie in terms of plot and acting, and as a hardcore horror film fan very few films manage to get under my skin, this is one of the few that did. Why? I guess its the subject matter, society creating its monsters. not new, you say, true, but the monster in this film is very human an some will understand and even be able to relate to his plight, and thats the scarry part.
My only complaint is that the DVD is not 16X9 its letterboxed 4x3.
Picture quality is ok too good, but it should have been 16x9. My five star rateing is for the film only.",1299715200,,1047,4.038461538461538
2799415,4,B000OT6UZG,"Lockout (Ricardo Islas, 2006)

While Lockout does not have the lowest rating on IMDB, not by a longshot, a trip through the comments section is quite telling. This is a movie that seems to be universally loathed. And I don't mean it's just people saying ""you know, this movie kinda sucks."" This is a movie that inspires passionate hatred in those who've seen it. Seemingly all of them. And I think I understand why; while it is labeled as a horror film, and was marketed as a horror film, Lockout really isn't a horror film. In fact, with the exception of a very few scenes, nothing about Lockout says ""horror film"" in the least. If you approach it as a kind of ""minority drama"" (for lack of a better term), on the other hand, Lockout, with its white-flight-leading-to-weird-goings-on plot and closet-racist protagonist, is an immensely satisfying journey. As a low-rent art film, as a friend of mine always said, ""that [censored for Amazon consumption] is boss."" It reminds me of--and I kid you not here--Jon Jost. Yeah, it's that good.

Dan (Kris Desautels) is not all that likable a guy, but you know, you can kinda identify with him. He's having a pretty bad time of things. After an opening scene which doesn't seem to connect to anything (be patient), we look in on Dan's life as he's being laid off by his Hispanic boss because his job's been outsourced to Mumbai (""India. That's where Mumbai is.""). After he leaves work, he starts noticing the number of people around him who talk in accents, or in foreign languages. Dan's the kind of guy who thinks that maybe these folks oughta all go back where they came from. At least, that's the idea you get...until he gets home and you find he's married to Chris (Cyn Dulay), a Hispanic Pacific Islander, and they're living with Chris' sister Rowena (Claire Davenport). Concerned about money now that he's laid off, Dan suggests the family rent out the place in the big city and go live in the big ancestral pile in rural Wisconsin (see the white-flight thing?). Rural Wisconsin, as it turns out, is a pretty darned weird place.

Toss the idea of this as a horror film. Really, just eliminate it from your skull. Think of Dan as a modern variation on Tom, the protagonist of Jost's Last Chants for a Slow Dance. He's maybe a little more sympathetic, since Jost offers us no way to ever empathize with Tom, while Islas actually seems to go out of his way to present Dan as a multi-faceted, eminently empathetic (if not likable) character. I mean, you've got a racist (and when I call Dan a racist, bear in mind that I'm talking about the normally-unconscious kind of stuff that is normally referred to as ""white privilege"" attitude) who's married to a minority character. She may be drop-dead gorgeous, but she's not passing. We've already got a guy who's got to be conflicted, and you put him in a situation (and a realistic situation it is; I'm sure we all have at least an acquaintance who's faced this circumstance) that exacerbates that conflict. Then you simply let him go and see what happens. Sure, there are other pieces of this that don't have anything to do with Dan and his whiteness complex. Rowena was trying to eke out a living as a professional dominatrix in the city (while hiding the income from her sister), and wants to try and keep up the practice in Wisconsin; her first tentative step towards that puts both her and Dan at odds with a strange local family. This seems to be the root of the horror-movie storyline in the film, but it's almost treated as an afterthought here (another reason why this should have been marketed as an indie art film rather than a low-budget horror flick). There's also some oddness about a body in the basement and a festering spider bite (and, of course, the spider bite is  yet another symbol of Dan's conflicted spirit). But none of this stuff necessarily points to a horror film. I'm serious--watch this as a double feature with Last Chants for a Slow Dance and it will suddenly all become clear to you. It's not even that there's a brilliant movie lurking under the surface here; it's right out there for everyone to see, and the only problem with it was the marketing. See this movie, and combat those on IMDB who castigated it because it's not a horror movie. ****",1238371200,,4273,4.618421052631579
2799416,4,B000OT6UZG,"""Lockout"" paints a dreary picture of a Midwestern family, forced to relocate from a posh Chicago lifestyle, to a rundown Wisconsin farmhouse with a few extra bumps in the night.
Writer / Director Ricardo Islas uses a strange aray of imagery to bring his story to the forefront of our concious. Often disturbing, but always thought-provoking in the way the film evolves, ""Lockout"" seems to take a few viewings before the backbone of (just what) is taking place becomes clear.
I'll admit... I was very confused the first time around, but the film has a way of growing on you, and it's uneasiness makes for an enjoyable movie experience.
Great acting and a nice grainy feel to the cinematography makes ""Lockout"" a nice addition to any collection.",1238112000,,743,4.858267716535433
2799417,2,B000OT6UZG,"Usually, ripping on a film is kind of fun (despite the flood of ""No"" votes such behavior attracts).  And rest assured; I am going to rip this as it truly deserves.  However, I'm actually going to feel bad complaining about this movie for a lot of reasons. I guess I should crank up the shredder and start the ripping...

-DECENT ACTORS PLAYING DULL PEOPLE
Do you know what the basic problem is with playing people as realistically as possible?  They're just damn dull!!  That's right; you, me and just about everyone else in this world would make a dull movie character.  That's why most films are about remarkable people or ordinary people in remarkable situations.  This film has a lot of ordinary people doing a lot of nothing for about the first hour. There is lots of complaining, introspection, and driving around.  Yet, these are people we've all seen or met or know.  The actors actually did a very good job.  The problem is the story didn't give them much to do for the first hour.

-A CLEVER STORY THAT BORED ME TO TEARS.
How's that for being conflicted?  The biggest problem with this story is that all the boring and seemingly incoherent events that take place in the first three quarters of the film only have meaning during the last 5 minutes.  Until then, even though I suspected it was getting to a point, I was still bored.  As it turned out, all the little introspective moments and seemingly mundane events were actually building a case for mental breakdown.  It was still boring.
Aside from my boredom, I really had trouble buying into the motivation for some of the people's actions and some things never do get properly explained.  A guy just loses his job and his first reaction is to move from his Chicago suburban apartment into his rundown, isolated Wisconsin farm house, and his wife also thinks it's a good idea.  Yea, that would cheer me up too.  What about that hitchhiker?  She's alive, she's dead, she's alive, she's dead... ...WTF?  Trust me, that never makes sense.  This is the first reason I'm sticking it to this film; Good story, bad screenplay.

-I SUSPECTED HOW IT WAS GOING TO END AFTER 20 MINUTES
I'm going to say some stuff now that could very easily spoil this movie if you are inclined to watch it.  I won't say anything specific about how this ends (which is key), but just by telling you what I noticed, you may figure it out.  SO BEWARE.  This is a poor mans version of ""High Tension"" without the high tension.  There, I spoiled it.  If you haven't seen that particular French film (which I happen to like), then just let me say that it had a big cheating ending.  You know; you couldn't know the killer because you were seeing events through the wrong eyes?  ""High Tension"" ticked off a lot of people when it ended.  ""Lockout"" will tick you off after the first 20 minutes and then it will tick you off again at the end.  The worst ploy used was the voyeuristic mystery camera in the bushes, watching the protagonists from afar.  It turns out there is nobody watching at all.  That's really cheap!  The funny thing is, I suspected who the killer was very early in the film. I just needed to wait and find out how they were going to explain it.  It turns out they couldn't do it without cheating. This is the second reason I'm deriding this film; Cheating on a grand scale while still being predictable.

-MEANINGFUL SEX AND MEANINGLESS GORE.
Let's talk about sex, baby!!  Sorry about that.  Would you ever want to see yourself having sex?  I wouldn't.  It rarely works out as well as in the movies, visually speaking.  One sex scene is like watching yourself (I would suspect).  The important thing is what's going on in their minds and not in the bed.  Another sex scene simply explains the mindset of a character in order to explain later events.  Also, a mysterious dark couple partakes in asphyxiation-sex which surprisingly has a purpose.  So, the sex scenes are full of meaning.
The gore in this film is close up and graphic.  I really didn't see any sense to it at all.  The implication of brutality would have done more for me.  The gore here was the definition of ""gratuitous"".  If you see no problem with that, keep in mind it really only occurs in the last 20 minutes of the film and only a couple of times.

-WHAT""S ALL THIS ABOUT SPANISH, DOC?
I'm not certain what the point of this was but every authority figure in this film was Spanish speaking.  The lead character gets fired by his Spanish speaking boss for not knowing how to speak a second language which gets the ball rolling in this film.  Are there a lot of Spanish speaking doctors in Wisconsin?  Is all this part of the psychosis?  In the end, it turns out to be some mysterious Spanish American psychosis conspiracy.  You think I'm joking?  I think the Director was.  However, this joke was completely over (or under?) my head.  Obviously, I'm not sure what he was getting at.  But don't think I'm joking; it is part of this movie.

-BUT I DO FEEL BAD.
Director Ricardo Islas is a remarkable character himself.  Here is a guy who made his first horror film at the age of 16.  He literally hoodwinked a south-of-the-border TV station to produce his film if he got enough sponsors.  Of course, he did.  The funny part is, all involved agreed to make his film because they were convinced he'd never get it going.  After watching his interview, I fell in love with his attitude and love for horror films.  He actually did a great job making this very low budget independent horror film.  He did a good job of directing his actors.  He even had a very thoughtful concept.  If only it could have been more interesting and less deceptive.  I didn't agree with his use of gore either.  I normally cut slack for low budget films, but Islas clearly knows how to use his limited resources.  It's funny; I think everyone who made this film has a lot of talent.  Yet, I would not recommend this film due to its lack of entertainment value and unfortunate deceptions to move the plot.

One day the water lines are blocked and the man of the house decides to see what the problem is, he heads to the basement to fix the problem. When he sees water dripping every where, he moves in for a closer look. What he then sees is a small hole in the wall just below the leak. He decides what the hell, and sticks his hand in the hole then all of a sudden.......  Like I said, I don't wanna spoil this movie. I loved it and had few flaws to it. Acting was around par level. Begining was a little slow but movie takes a huge turn. Has mystery, suspence, comedy, gore, drug abuse, sex, and a plot. I would give it 5 stars but I can't do that for a Horror flim.

2799427,5,B000OT6UZG,"Generally speaking when someone refers to most horror films, no one likes to put the words ""thinking man's"" and ""horror"" together. Horror is often perceived to be a genre that requires no thinking, no logic, and one would even go as far to say no plot, but one thing people always can associate horror with is violence, gore, nudity, etc.

So when it comes down the nitty gritty, horror films aren't often looked upon with kind eyes by critics alike for this said reason. They expect nothing more than a senseless bloodbath with no retribution whatsoever. Well thankfully, times are changing and horror  although still having its share of mindless bloodbaths  is turning into a genre that is becoming somewhat respected. Films like Saw while being grotesque also manage to put forth not only an interesting story, but a twist here and there that keeps the viewer guessing and constantly on their toes. It's a thinking man's horror film in sense. A whodunit if you will.

When it comes down to looking at a film like Lockout one can only assume two things by viewing the cover art and the synopsis on the back; it's going to be one of those senseless bloodbath types of films, or it's going to be boring as sin. Thankfully, it's neither.

The film has a basic premise, a story about a Dan, a man who cannot adjust to his company's new procedures and after 10 years of service, he is let go. It appears that the company needs people that can speak other languages and Dan cannot. He decides to move out to a country home he and his family have to take it easy and minimize the cost of living. Upon arrival things appear normal, but nothing is ever what it seems  especially in a horror film.

The film mostly takes place in the old home and an abandoned barn where we meet our protagonists; two very messed up individuals who come into the picture due to a certain girl's strange habits. They enjoy violent sex and the occasional bodily dismemberment. It becomes clear very quickly that the pair is stalking Dan and his family and soon a final confrontation begins.

As the film moves on, one picks up little hints here and there about the film's subject matter. It's very clear Dan is not friendly amongst the Hispanic or other foreign language citizens as everyone he meets he is either rude to, or just blows off. Odd considering that his wife and sister-in-law are also from other countries but that's just another part of this story's wonderful brain.

The film does move along quite slowly but it builds up to a nice confrontation and a hell of a twist ending that I saw part of it coming, but the rest was a total shock. In any film's case, not just horror, a good twist these days is very hard to find.

The acting sells the story as each actor portrays their characters very well. The arguments are real, the talking is real, it all feels real, nothing sounds pre-written or staged which is also, something difficult to find. The protagonists have no speaking lines which add not only to their weirdness but make them feel like more of a threat.

The special features on the disc unfortunately are nil, nothing but a behind the scenes documentary and a trailer. Although the documentary was lengthy, a commentary would have been nice but the film works well enough on its own so I cannot complain. The picture comes through very clear and has that shot-on-video look but doesn't quite nail it, looks more like digital than anything but it does not detract from the film's viewing experience at all. If anything it adds to it.

Lockout is one of those films people are either going to really love, or hate incredibly. I loved it. The film works its way under your skin, keeps you thinking at the end as it all falls into your lap and holds the viewer's interest for its running time. The story is thick, the acting is great, and the twist is one of those that won't make sense at first; but once you place all the facts of the film together and think about how it all falls into place; it will. Definitely a film you will be going, ""Oh, okay so THAT'S what happened and that's why this was like this, okay I get it now."" But it's not going to be something you will get right away, you'll have to think.

If something that's going to pick at your brain hours after you watch it is what you're looking for, Lockout is it. If it isn't, well you might want to look elsewhere. This film has its brain planted firmly into its grizzly end and doesn't stop ticking until the credits roll. I applaud the writers and the people behind this film for bringing something like this to the horror genre. It's just the kind of film it needs to push itself up from being mindless entertainment to actual entertainment. Seek this one out, it's well worth it.
