8022598,5,B000260R6Y,"For video enjoyment , I like this performance .  All three ladies sing excellent , and do not exhibit typical  ' emotive drama queen '  tendencies seen in opera videos .  I can even listen to this video without watching the screen , and appreciate Mozart's music , which I can never do enough .  However , for cd listening , one cannot do better than the Karajan performance on EMI with Bruscantini and Schwartzkopf and company .  My runner-up for cd listening is the Jochum performance on DG with the lovely Irmgard Seefried .",1420156800,,527,4.494736842105263
8022599,3,B000260R6Y,"The sound quality is terrible on this DVD of the 1975 Glyndebourne production of  Mozart's ""Cos fan tutte.""  I'm going to throw my copy away as soon as I've finished writing this review.  Which is too bad, because the singers are definitely worth hearing, especially a young Thomas Allen and the Swedish soprano Helena Dse, who sings the role of Fiordiligi with an absolute perfection of voice and acting.  She is easily this cynical old opera's most sympathetic character, anyway, and her grand aria, ""Come scoglio"" is sung with ravishing chest notes, beautiful triplets, and a top to die for.  The beauty comes through even on this flat squealing soundtrack.

Australian tenor Anson Austin as Ferrando has to fake some of his high notes, but otherwise produces a clear, pleasant sound.  Pert little Danile Perriers as Despina has a voice that matches the soundtrack screech for brassy screech.  Her voice is very appropriate for her impudent, skeptical character, but I kept wishing someone would oil the screen door.  Bass-baritone Frantz Ptri as Don Alfonso was the embodiment of cynicism.

The ladies are beautifully costumed, even Despina in mobcap and primrose yellow dress, but the two boyfriends, Ferrando and Guglielmo are dressed like cartoon soldiers even before they change into their Albanian rig.  The interior sets are decorated with lovely old porcelain and soft colors, but the designer's exterior skies looked like early Technicolor sunsets.

The ensemble singing was a highlight of this production, but in spite of Mozart's ravishing music, I rarely watch this opera in any edition.  Ferrando and Guglielmo should have had enough sense to toss Don Alfonso into the Neapolitan harbor when he suggested that they practice such a cruel deception on their unsuspecting lovers.",1409788800,,1792,5.180555555555555
8022600,2,B000260R6Y,"That this is an old production, no problem. The singers are very good but the transfer is absolutely disgraceful.
And I mean DISGRACEFUL! should not be offered. A CD would be honorable.",1403049600,,185,4.8125
8022601,3,B000260R6Y,"Though it's a rather basic sort of production with traditional costuming and whimsical sets (for the little stage at Glyndbourne), this Cosi features bright, funny performances from everyone involved; nicely sung, too. The outstanding performance, IMO, is Daniele Perriers' Despina--tiny, pretty, funny, bent, and deliciously devious. Just delightful. The downside here, alas, is the quality of video and sound. Muddy, low-low-res video from 1975--hard to watch at times. The sound isn't much better, with frequent distortion. Still, considered as a video document of a fine production, it's worth having.",1316908800,3,605,5.808988764044944
8022602,5,B000260R6Y,"There are many reasons to bypass this 1975 performance as has been noted by other reviewers.  But I have owned three other DVDs of this opera and find that I still enjoy this one the most.  As a piece of ensemble work in performance it is still the most satisfying.  On my progressive scan player the visual portion of the signal is really quite good and the sound is not embarassing.  The sets, on that small stage of the old house, are charming and totally appropriate (I think modern directors have quite forgotten that word and its meaning.) Like the early Glyndebourne Marriage of Figaro (which has a somewhat stronger cast) the Cosi remains an object lesson in how to stage a Mozart opera.  I do occassional look for a more modern performance of works like these but find that the older performances still provide the most satisfaction and delight.  If I find another newer performance the this work I'm sure I will always return to this performance whose sum is definetly greater than its parts.",1244332800,4,1002,4.6647727272727275
8022603,5,B000260R6Y,"Very bright, lots of close-ups -- which is good because the physical beauty and acting ability of the players needs to be accented -- as the sound quality is barely adequate.  A great problem with Mozart is that the feeling of 'small action on a large stage' is a killer -- compare the La Scala 'Don' with Thomas Allen.  This has an extremely small stage feel -- just perfect.  Petri as Don Alonso is a little too virile to have put himself out of commission in the way he apparently has -- true, he is a ""philosopher"" but, as a philosophy professor myself, I wish he wouldn't drink (or have others drink) that much wine that early in the morning!",1139184000,4,647,4.375
8022604,3,B000260R6Y,"This is my fifth Cosi on DVD, and unfortunately it ranks near the bottom on all fronts - musically, technically and dramatically.  It's an antique (by video standards) live from 1975 Glyndebourne Festival, and the technical aspects show - sound is lukewarm, early video capture a bit harsh.  The cast is good enough - one would expect no slouches at Glyndebourne - but none really thrill.  Pritchard takes things rather fast, particularly in the first act, and doesn't make use of much rubatto.  The production is simple, standard and rather bland.  Worth acquiring perhaps for the real collector only.",1115769600,9,602,5.040404040404041
8022605,4,B000260R6Y,"This is a DVD of the 1975 Glyndebourne production of 'Cos fan tutte' previously available on VHS. It's from the old house and features attractive young singers--yes, back then even Thomas Allan, the Guglielmo, was a young man!--and the energetic and expert conducting of John Pritchard, who learnt this opera at the right hand of Glyndebourne's earliest and probably greatest Mozart conductor, Fritz Busch. By and large the cast was not then and is not now well-known (Helene Dse as Fiordiligi, Sylvia Lindenstrand as Dorabella, Anson Austin as Ferrando, Danile Perriers as Despina, and Frantz Ptri as Don Alfonso) except for (now Sir) Thomas Allen. However, it is a first-rate cast who act well, move gracefully, sing beautifully (if a bit undercharacterized in some spots) and form a smooth ensemble. The sets are a bit generic,  a bit stylized, and a bit 1970s Day-Glo. The stage direction (by Adrian Slack) is fairly traditional. Even the comic bits by Despina and Don Alonso are pretty stock. But then there's the music by Mozart; who can resist that? This is surely Mozart's and Da Ponte's most delicious comedy. I have a hard time understanding why it was not as popular through the decades as 'Nozze di Figaro' and 'Don Giovanni' have been; perhaps earlier generations found the plot risqu, although it seems to me it simply points out the frailties and temptations of young lovers without being particularly sensationalist about it.

A couple of high points. The tenor Anson Austin, who spent most of his career singing at the Sydney Opera in his native Australia, is an attractive man whose honeyed tenor is beautifully controlled. His 'Un aura amorosa' is delectable. Fiordiligi's 'Come scoglio' is well sung, if a bit tame. Dorabella's 'Smanie implacabili' and Guglielmo's 'Donne mie, la fate a tanti' are superb. But it's in the ensembles that this cast really shines, and the two finales are excitingly done.

There are other probably better videos of this opera. I have not seen any other video productions of this opera, alas, and cannot compare it with them, although one can imagine that the John Eliot Gardiner version, with original instruments, would be excellent if that approach is your meat, and the Barenboim has gotten some rave reviews.

One caveat: the sound on this DVD is a just a bit bass-shy and has some minor distortion at high dynamic levels (at least on my equipment).
