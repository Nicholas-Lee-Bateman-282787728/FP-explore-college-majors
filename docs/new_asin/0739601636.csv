7788320,5,0739601636,"This video was hillarious! The Tom Green show is one of my favorite shows and this is like a best of. I like the beggining part where he is going around in crutches falling down. But thats just the beggining, this video is a hillarious wacked-out video that I deffinitly recommend.",972000000,,281,4.529411764705882
7788321,5,0739601636,"at first viewing, this may not seem as funny as his usual ""antics"", but this video will grow on you after you realize, and appreciate the different type of humor he used to go for, years ago. it's  relatively the same schtick, but it's more random stuff than usual. (i tend  to like his older stuff slightly better). i especially like the  ""dennis woodroffe"" skit in which they interview a struggling  actor, trying to make it in hollywood. the guy starts saying that he's sick  of seeing the ""same 15 people acting"", and that he wishes they  ""would all go on a vacation permanantly, so that i could  work""...after a few moments of silence, the guy starts laughing  hysterically, for about 20 seconds. and during the skit toms' face is  pressed up against the camera, as curiously stares at the lens. there just  isn't the type of comedy you will see here, found anywhere else. and for  all you phil giroux-aholics, as i admitedly am, there is a suprising # of  appearances by him. but you WILL thank me, if you decide to buy this.",962236800,2,1031,4.513513513513513
