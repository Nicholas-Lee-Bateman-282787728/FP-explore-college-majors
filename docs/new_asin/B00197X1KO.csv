8272426,5,B00197X1KO,I have watched this several times now and it is well worth the money...no matter how short it is.  The DVD shows that THE HOLLIES were great live!  They captured just about everything on the recordings live!  AMAZING!,1272758400,,217,4.657894736842105
8272427,2,B00197X1KO,"This performance of the Hollies is better than the Small Faces and Kinks volumes for performance but still too short.  Another reviewer said it was 11 minutes long but I think it may be shorter than that.  Live without lip-synching, at least.

The band plays hard with more enthusiasm than others I have seen outside of the Eric Burdon & The Animals & Episode Six one, which I think is the best of the series so far that I've seen.

Set List:

1. Stop Stop Stop
2. On A Carousel
3. Bus Stop
4. Instrumental & Dance

The last song is an instrumental cover of ""Jeff's Boogie"" of the Yardbirds with Jeff Beck.  Tony Hicks is no Jeff Beck, though.

Muddy sound is a problem but at least the video quality isn't bad considering when it was made.

As in the other DVDs of the series, the camera work & lighting is not the best but better than some of the others.

The German audience is mixed with some dancing to the music but many others just stand around and arn't even watching the band!  Graham even scolds them a bit.  Whatsup with them?  Why be on a TV show like this and not even watch the band?

This performance to me shows the original Hollies were a much better live band than I thought they would be and have read about.  I have a couple of live import LPs from their 1970s lineups, and I think the original outfit may actually have been better, or at least more inspired.

Good for someone wanting some decent Hollies in their live music video collection but too short to recommend strongly.",1242604800,,1499,4.318996415770609
8272428,4,B00197X1KO,"Though this dvd does little to alieviate the paucity of video of early Hollies as it's only three songs proper and a sort of hoedown exit-music improvisation.  That said, I love this stuff.  The first cut, Stop Stop Stop, gets things off to a rousing start and shows the teenage Tony Hicks playing great on an iconic way cool Vox 12-string electric guitar. Allan Clarke looks charismatic and Graham Nash is the serious one.  Bus Stop and Carousel follow for three great songs all back-to-back.  The video and audio are as good as one can expect which is to say not perfection, but certainly good enough to enjoy.  It's fortunate just to have this made available and I want to encourage more to be made of available, hopefully not just the European rock and roll TV shows, but American ones too like Hullabaloo, Shindig, Where The Action Is, ABC's In Concert, Don Kirshner's Rock Concert, and Midnight Special.  What makes this, and other Beat Beat Beat shows so special is the fact the performances were live and not lip-syncs.  It makes it clear The Hollies were not a vocal group, but a real rock band that could rip it up.  Perhaps this is for mostly fans due to the price/song quantity thing, but just about everyone of any taste would have to admit these were, and are, great songs.  I love it and recommend it.",1233964800,7,1316,4.56595744680851
8272429,3,B00197X1KO,"$11 for 11 minutes/4 songs? the Amazon UK site has this for 3 pounds (6 dollars)...
the tracks are:
1. Stop Stop Stop
2. Bus Stop
3. Carousel
4. Instrumental and Dance

I haven't watched this recently, but if I remember correctly these are live, not lipsynced performances.
Great for Hollies fans, but not a good value...",1212796800,10,321,4.631578947368421
