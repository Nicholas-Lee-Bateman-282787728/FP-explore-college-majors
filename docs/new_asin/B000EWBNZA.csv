I love this entire series. Ken Watanabe is fascinating and believable as the doctor/assassin in old Edo. I wish they would release the entire TV series, but as of now, only a portion of the total TV programs are available. If you love Ken Watanabe, this series is for you.",1240704000,2,527,7.365079365079365
