2798753,3,B000OPODNQ,This is a totally retro superman cartoon. It's not as well animated as the theatrical Flesher cartoons. Also the plots are a bit outlandish (ie aliens and wizards). But it is fun to watch.,1182902400,3,188,4.5588235294117645
2798754,5,B000OPODNQ,"It's about time they released these classic cartoons. The New Adventures of Superman was my favorite growing up. The simple plots along with the music made these the classics that they are.  I'm sure they will release the remaining episodes as well as Superboy,Aquaman,and the Justice League. I taped these cartoons off of Boomerang a few years ago. They were ok except for the commercials and the fact small portions were omitted from the shows. I also bought the Super Powers VHS from Amazon. Release all of these fine shows from the vault--they have been collecting dust long enough!!!",1182643200,11,588,4.9393939393939394
2798755,5,B000OPODNQ,"""Superman! Rocketed to Earth as an infant when the distant planet Krypton exploded. And who disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for the Daily Planet fights a neverending battle for truth, justice and freedom with super powers far beyond those of ordinary mortals!""

That's how announcer Jackson Beck opened this classic show from 1966. The opening scene showing Superman smashing meteorites to the show's very '60s jazz main title theme still looks cool.

Following the '40s&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fleischer-Superman/dp/6305943389/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fleischer Superman</a>&nbsp;(made for theaters) and the '50s&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adventures-of-Superman/dp/B000A5046K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adventures of Superman</a>&nbsp;(first done as a movie then a TV series), Filmation's New Adventures of Superman (1966) was the first Superman done specifically for television. Paid a sum of $36,000 per completed half-hour by CBS (who struck a deal with DC Comics to create the show), Superman also was the then-little studio's first major TV deal.

The legacy of the more revered Fleischer Superman shorts was not lost on Filmation. ""The Fleischers did, as far as I'm concerned, the definitive one. So much so that we actually managed to hire some of them to work for us,"" producer Lou Scheimer said.

In additon to comics faithful character designs, and effective yet limited [compared to today] animation, The New Adventures of Superman also featured the voices of Fleischer Superman's Bud Collyer and Joan Alexander (alternating with Julie Bennett) as the animated Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane.

As a result, the series was a breakout hit. So much so Filmation was given a bonus and a 2nd season where the show expanded to ""The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure"" adding heroes Green Lantern, Hawkman, the Flash, the Atom, Teen Titans, and Justice League to the lineup.

Due to the ongoing Siegel/DC/Time Warner battle for Superboy copyrights, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superboy/dp/6300273288/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superboy</a>&nbsp;episodes originally sandwiched between the Superman episodes are not included in this set. Despite this, I still recommend the set solely on the strength of the thirty-six 6 min. Superman eps that are included.

2798757,2,B000OPODNQ,"The plans for New Adventures of Superman disappoint me a lot. The Superboy cartoons from the original show have been left out altogether, according to the latest online news I've read.

As well as that, they'll only include the 36 Superman cartoons from the first 18 episodes (ie first season) of New Adventures of Superman.

Another 8 episodes (with 16 Superman cartoons and 8 Superboy cartoons) were produced in 1967 for the Superman Aquaman Hour of Adventure. (I'd hoped for years to see all of that released in full).

A further 8 two-part Superman stories and 8 more accompanying Superboy stories were produced for the Batman Superman Hour in 1968. (I'd like very much to see all that released in full, making the following complete: Superman, Batman, Aquaman, Superboy, and Aquaman's guest star spots of Justice League, Teen Titans, Atom, Hawkman, Green Lantern, Flash).

The Shazam live action series is another long awaited DC character I'd love to see released in full.

I'd also like to see the other seasons of Superfriends & Super Powers Team too. We got two sets two years ago, which I enjoyed a lot, leaving me keen to see the many other incarnations of the show:

Superfriends (1973 one hour stories)

All-New Superfriends Hour (1976; four stories with Wondertwins, guest stars, whole team, team-ups)

World's Greatest Superfriends (1980)

Superfriends (1981-83 six min shorts; 3 per show; 3 seasons)

Superfriends: Legendary Super Powers Show (1984)

I just wished they kept these in the same consistency I use to watch on TV w/ Superboy episodes in between the Superman shows. Also the following seasons w/ Aquaman, Teen Titans, Batman instead of separating them. Besides that I agree w/ the extra behind the scenes interviews saying these episodes are like comic books come to life. The narrations being so detailed you can actually just listen to the audio like a radio program.

The only regret is these are only the cartoons made in 1966, and not the ones in 1967, you have to order specifically for those Superman cartoons. I would have liked to have seen more Superboy cartoons included.

The colours are fantastic, the music is jazzy and fun, Ted Knight does some narration, you get Jimmy Olsen and Lois, and, well what's not to love.

2798816,4,B000OPODNQ,"'The New Adventures of Superman' was the first animated immortalisation of the Man of Steel for the small screen audience, since the Fleischer theatrical shorts of the 1940s.  It was Filmation's first attempt at television animation, having acquired the license rights for DC characters, and quickly became Saturday morning's staple for superheroics for decades to come.  The show's first season, which aired on CBS from 1966-67, had a particular format of two 7-8 minute Superman cartoons, with one 7-8 minute episode of the first season of 'The Adventures of Superboy' sandwiched in-between.  Subsequent seasons would incorporate a variety of other DC superheroes into the format, including Aquaman, Batman, Atom and Hawkman, amongst others.  What is most interesting about this show and subsequent seasons is that it served somewhat as a precursor to the long-running Super Friends series of the 70s and 80s, after Hanna-Barbera acquired the rights to use DC characters from Filmation.
Throughout this first season of 36 7-8 minute episodes, Superman/Clark Kent deals with a lot of rather one-dimensional space villains from Pluto and Jupiter, for example, mad scientists harnessing insectoid and robotic powers, plus an army of sea-creatures and pre-historic dinosaurs.  Classic villains from the Superman comic books also make their first appearance in animated form here in a few episodes, including Lex Luthor, the Prankster,the Parasite (albeit in a rather child-friendly depiction compared to his appearance in the comics), the Toyman, Brainiac, Mr. Mxyzptlk and original villains, the Sorcerer and the Wicked Warlock.  Also making their small screen debut alongside the Man of Steel and his rogues gallery are Daily Planet Chief Editor Perry White, journalistic reporter Lois Lane and cub-reporter Jimmy Olsen.  Interestingly, Bud Collyer, who voiced Superman in the 1940s' Fleischer shorts and the long-running radio programme, also voiced the man of Steel here; while Joan Alexander, who also voiced Lois Lane in the same radio show, reprises her role here as the journalistic beauty of Metropolis.  Ted Knight, who went on to narrate the adventures and action during the Super Friends series, also provides narration here, explaining the action as it is happening in a way very much synonymous with radio broadcasting.
Ironically, compared to today's standards, the action presented was very limited and Superman was not permitted to pull punches towards anyone or advocate any use of violence towards his enemies.  This was due to a parental union, stating that comic book violence in books and on television were a bad influence on the young target audience.  Therefore, the majority of DC's Filmation Adventures series and subsequent Super Friends cartoons (as well as many other contemporary Hanna-Barbera cartoon series) were not especially full of animated action sequences, but did present a lot of moral messages for young children through dialogue and story-telling.  Also, being a fledgling company, Filmation was famous for making use of stock footage quite frequently in their series and, unfortunately, this makes the cartoon sequences a little repetitive and predictable at times.  However, on the whole, the character depictions and storyboards are relatively faithful to their comic-book counterparts, such as the utilisation of Jimmy Olsen's Superman signal watch, for example.
Regarding this release from the DC Comics Classic Collection, the first season of 'The New Adventures of Superman', comprising 36 episodes (culminating in 252 minutes of classic animation fun!), is spread over two disks, containing 18 episodes each, with each disc having an approximate running time of just over two hours long.  Unfortunately, the 'Adventures of Superboy' segments, exploring Superman's teenage exploits, are not included, presumably due to the on-going legal dispute regarding character copyright and creation.  Ironically, they did include the intro to one of the segments towards the end of the first disk, though the episode itself is not included.  With the recent release of the Superboy live-action series on DVD, hopefully there will be a separate release of these segments on the horizon, plus additional seasons of 'The New Adventures of Superman' with any luck.  Upon loading the second disk, there plays a sneak peek of the, then, upcoming release of 'Superman: Doomsday' on DVD, which is based upon the 'Death and Return of Superman' trilogy.  The bonus features included comprise of trailers showcasing other Warner Brothers' releases from the Hanna-Barbera studio, including Birdman and Space Ghost, amongst others.  The main addition to this set is a retrospective featurette entitled 'Superman in 1966', which looks back over the history of Superman from his debut in comics through to this series in 1966; exploring the connections made to the contemporary comic book stories at the time, and how Filmation acquired the rights to animate DC's most famous superhero.  I would have appreciated the option of subtitling in English and possibly other language features, but this is only a minor flaw.
As an additional retro accompaniment, I would suggest exploring both the two disk DVD set of 'DC Superheroes - The Filmation Adventures'; which includes the guest spot segments from 'The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure' (1967/68), and 'The Adventures of Aquaman', also available in a two disk DVD set from the DC Comics Classic Collection (which includes the Aquaman segments from the aforementioned show).  Thankfully, Warner Brothers have finally released the last two seasons of 'The New Adventures of Superman' onto DVD as of 2014, and let's hope that we won't have to wait too long for the interconnecting Season One Superboy segments to be made available to a very eager audience of golden-age animation and Superman enthusiasts.",1370476800,,5879,5.43956043956044

2798820,3,B000OPODNQ,"This is the cartoon that got me interested in the Superman comic books as a kid.  There has been some criticism about the quality of the stories, especially in comparison to the 90s cartoons.  In reality, they are true to the Superman comics, circa 1960.  Simple story lines, little character development, and no continuing stories are qualities consistent with both the comic and the cartoons of the time period. To me it's part of their charm and appeal.  When you add to it the retro history of the development of the cartoon and it's impact on Saturday morning cartoon, it's a must have for any Superman collection.

A bigger criticism is the quality of the DVD, the major reason for the lower rating.  I can't understand in this day why they didn't digitally remaster the originals for a cleaner look.

I was very disappointed. The animation was stiff, the stories was weak, It was as if they forgot those great superman cartoons of the 40's.

2798825,5,B000OPODNQ,"As a child of the '80s and early '90s I was also into comic books of the era, too. Batman and Superman were at the top of the list for me...I love the Super Friends cartoons as well. I was not familiar with the earlier cartoons of Superman until they were released on a low-budget home video in the early '90s. Those cartoons were the theatrical releases by the Fleischer Studio. I was then acquainted with the George Reeves version of Superman when Nick-at-Nite began to air the television show...around the same time I began hearing the radio version with Bud Collyer that would often show up on NPR and the anthology series, When Radio Was, formerly hosted by Stan Freberg.

I was very familiar with the movie version of Superman played by Christopher Reeve. The movies used to air seemingly all the time in the 1980's on HBO and TBS.

In addition to his role as Superman, Bud Collyer was equally famous as a game show host (""To Tell the Truth"", ""Winner Take All"", ""Beat the Clock"", etc. etc.). In one of his last appearances on television, which can be seen on You Tube, there were some of Collyer's peers and contemporaries who were completely unaware of his 20 plus year association with the Superman character.

In this DVD we get 36 six minute episodes. I don't necessarily know if each episode runs exactly 6 minutes but I'd say 6 and a half to 7 minutes is the general length per episode. Among the many adventures in this collection quite a few of them are wonderful in their story-telling...one of the adventures that's fine but isn't on the same level as the other episodes is ""The Iron Eater"". In that episode Superman has to stop a bizarre looking mechanical menace devouring iron all over the world. That episode, as well as ""The Imp-Practical Joker"" featuring Mr. Mxyzptlk, are more whimsical than anything else. As was noted by another reviewer a lot of the episodes aren't in chronological order. ""Superman Meets Brainiac"" is on Disc 2 while ""The Return of Brainiac"" is on Disc 1.

In what could be described as a forerunner to the future Legion of Doom makes an appearance as A.P.E. The members of the A.P.E organization are: Lex Luthor, Toyman, Prankster, and the Warlock. In their episode ""The Men from A.P.E."" we have Luthor as the inventor of a Kryptonic projector which is shot from a light-house. It's beam of kryptonite is capable of aiming at Superman within a mile radius. The villains purposely device schemes that cause Superman to fly near the light-house. ""The Tree Men from Arbora"" is a tale of a tree creature that consumes gallons of water...ponds, rivers, even the water from a by-stander's car engine. The creature hides in the Redwood Forrest and Superman has to battle him and return him to the Arbora planet.

""Merlin's Magic Marbles"" involves Luthor and his assistant, Blinky, obtaining magic marbles from the spirit of Merlin. Toyman, in a later episode, creates a robot version of Superman for criminal use. The episode, ""The Two Faces of Superman"", is on Disc 2. One of the funnier aspects of the dialogue is when Superman refers to one of the insects in ""Insect Raiders"" as Buzzy...in another episode, ""The Prehistoric Pterodactyls"", Superman refers to one of them as Terry Baby. In the Superman history there have been various criminals to use the name, Toyman. The original, Winslow Schott, is who the Toyman in these cartoons is based on. The illustration of him in these cartoons has him with dark hair, a big red bow tie, and just as a side-note the Toyman in these cartoons makes me think of comedian Henry Morgan (a regular panelist on the classic game show, I'VE GOT A SECRET).

Something of a mystery to me is the identity of the person providing the voice in the opening sequence saying the line ""It's Superman!"". We hear Jackson Beck do the narration but then we hear ""It's a bird!"", ""It's a plane!"", and then ""It's Superman!"". The reason I'm curious about who did that particular ""It's Superman!"" voice-over is because it sounds incredibly like Danny Dark, the man who voiced Superman in the 1970's and 1980's Super Friends episodes. If anyone has any information I'd love to know if it was Danny Dark or someone else.

Given that ""The New Adventures of Superman"" originally consisted of three short episodes per half hour (2 of Superman, 1 of Super-Boy) we have all of the Superman episodes that aired on that program. Since there were 2 short adventures of Superman per half hour episode, and there were a total of 18 half hour episodes produced, that's 36 in total.

The Super-Boy episodes aren't included due to legal complications.

To clear up some of the on-going confusion of whether to call this a ""complete series"" it's important to note that without the Super-Boy segments it isn't a ""complete series"" but as far as the Superman segments are concerned it's indeed a ""complete series"" since it has each and every Superman adventure from the first season, 1966-1967. The second season, 1967-1968, aired under the title THE SUPERMAN/AQUAMAN HOUR OF ADVENTURE. The third season, 1968-1969, aired as THE BATMAN/SUPERMAN HOUR.

Each of those Superman adventures in the third season were split up into 2 parts.

The fourth season, 1969-1970, was nothing but reruns from earlier seasons.

Bud Collyer passed away on September 8, 1969 which was the same day an updated version of ""To Tell the Truth"" began airing with Garry Moore as the host!

Collyer was the voice of Superman/Clark Kent on radio, in theatrical cartoons, and in the made for TV cartoons of the mid to late '60s.

The voice of Lois Lane in these episodes is Joan Alexander...she also provided the voice of Lois on the radio version, too. She became a regular panelist on the 1950's game show, THE NAME'S THE SAME.

Jack Grimes is the voice of Jimmy Olsen in these cartoons just as he was in the final few years of the Superman radio show.

The show's narrator, Jackson Beck, also provided the voice of Perry White in addition to various incidental characters. Beck was also the narrator and voice of Perry White in the radio version of Superman. Beck's most recognized cartoon voice is that of Bluto/Brutus in the Popeye cartoons produced from 1944 through the 1960's.",1304812800,,6195,4.754189944134078

As much as I enjoyed the Superfriends in their different incarnations, I prefered the Filmation Superman - I always found the Superfriends' Superman as being a bit of a wimp!

The Filmation version of Superman runs a close second to the Fleischer animation in my opinion, (although by modern standards the animation may seem limited and stilted) both had great storylines and their mood reflected the comicbooks of the times.

2798838,4,B000OPODNQ,"The New Adventures of Superman
(Released June 26, 2007 by Warner Home Video)  DVD Review by Joe Torcivia

This, of course, is Filmation's trend setting series from 1966.

Up front, I must express an almost lifelong affection for the DC Comics Super Heroes, and a 15 year long love affair with the DC Animated Series BATMAN, SUPERMAN, BATMAN BEYOND, JUSTICE LEAGUE and JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED, produced by Bruce Timm for Warner Bros. I also enjoyed the 1960s DC cartoons from Filmation Studios.

This DVD set should have been a ""lock"" for me but, instead, it is a very mixed bag.  Oh, there's plenty of great stuff -- especially when viewed through nostalgia-colored glasses, where Filmation's legendary shortcomings are minimized by the good feelings these shows originally created.

We know and accept Filmation's faults for what they were - and are!  The source of my uncharacteristic displeasure is the dispensing with the usually high standards practiced by Warner Home Video, in the assembling of this package.

There are far too many ""CONS"" to allow me to enjoy this DVD collection to the extent that I had hoped.  Yet, the ""PROS"", in many ways, still manage to make the package a worthwhile entertainment experience.

The CONS:

The series is NOT COMPLETE!  I'm very disappointed in that!  The Superboy segments (originally part of each half-hour episode) are omitted.  Somehow, I can understand that, as SB remains in some sort of legal limbo between DC/WB and the heirs of Jerry Siegel.  BUT, all the Superman episodes are not there either.

The box claims 36 episodes.  What they don't tell you is that there were TWO Superman cartoons per show -- plus one Superboy -- and that those are counted as SEPARATE episodes... even though each ""pair"" of Superman shorts are framed by the show's original opening and closing credits -- indicating it to be ONE SHOW.  So, in actuality you get 18 original shows - really TWO THIRDS of 18 shows - despite the box's claim of 36 ""episodes"".  Not exactly trickery, but the feeling of it is there, nonetheless.

Later, there were a handful of TWO-PART SUPERMAN EPISODES that are also not in this set.  Granted, these were made for the BATMAN/SUPERMAN HOUR show of 1968 -- but they were also shown as part of the SUPERMAN show after Batman split off into his own show.  Perhaps they will be part of a possible BATMAN/SUPERMAN HOUR release -- though there were not nearly enough of them to give Supes a fair representation on such a set, as many of the earlier Superman shorts were mixed into that show as ""extender"".

Either way, I expected to see the two-parters here.  Further research reveals that there are about 16 short Superman cartoons also absent from this set and, hopefully, all this missing material is being hoarded for a second volume.  After all, this was never billed as ""The Complete Series"", so maybe I was expecting too much, having been accustomed to the general quality of other WHV releases... the also-incomplete NEW SCOOBY-DOO MOVIES set, notwithstanding.

The transfers to DVD have got to be the worst I've ever seen from a major studio - with the possible exception of certain elements of WHV's ""THE MAGILLA GORILLA SHOW"" set!  Yes, I know it's Filmation, and it's SUPPOSED TO look bad.  But, it appears that little effort was made to clean these cartoons up.  The Mr. Mxyzptlk episode, ""The Imp-Practical Joker"" (Which I remembered sort of fondly and especially wanted to see and contrast with Bruce Timm and Paul Dini's 1997 masterpiece ""Mxyzpixilated"" from SUPERMAN THE ANIMATED SERIES), is unbelievably bad with lines, streaking, and visual debris across the image!  SHAME ON YOU WARNER HOME VIDEO!

In six minutes, the stories are often too brief and many of them are hokey, even by Silver Age comic book standards, but others are good.  Besides, some very good Superman stories were done in eight pages or so, in the Silver Age comic books of legendary editor Mort Weisinger.

In addition to being incomplete, badly transferred, and sometimes hokey (though I can't really blame the ""hokey"" on WHV, can I?), there is NO PROPER ORDER to the presentation!  We DVD enthusiasts like things organized, complete, uncut, and IN ORDER!  None of that here!

""Superman Meets Brainiac"" is on DISC TWO, while ""The Return of Brainiac"" is on DISC ONE!  Um... all you have to do is READ THE TITLES to know this is the wrong thing to do, folks!

The PACKAGING is that slimmer, cheaper packaging that Warner Home Video has used since the latter part of 2005, where one disc rests upon another.  You cannot handle or remove DISC TWO without first removing or handling DISC ONE.  There is always potential, however slight, for damage with packaging of this sort.

The PROS:

 It's Superman!

It's Superman is as close to an accurate Mort Weisinger / Silver Age comic book interpretation as we could ever have hoped to get!

Bud Collyer and Joan Alexander, from the Max Fleschier theatrical days and radio series, are reunited as Superman/Clark, and Lois!

The character designs are as closely based on classic Silver Age Superman artist Curt Swan as was possible to do in such limited animation.

It is the first animated use of Jimmy Olsen. Though sans freckles, he looks just as he did in his own comic -- that is when he wasn't being transformed into a turtle, werewolf, or other monster.

DC Comics editor Mort Weisinger was a consultant to the series, and his name is in the end credits of every show.

Actual DC writers of the time did scripts:  George Kashdan, William Woolfolk, Arnold Drake, Bill Finger (Considered by many to be the uncredited co-creator of Batman!), and someone who -- to my knowledge -- was never involved with DC, Oscar Bensol.  As all the other writers were actual DC writers, I wonder if ""Bensol"" wasn't a pen name for someone else.  (Jerry Siegel, perhaps?)

Bob Hastings (LT. Carpenter on sixties sit-com MC HALE'S NAVY) begins an over 30-year association with DC Comics characters by voicing Jimmy Olsen and the absent-due to-being-in court Superboy.  Hastings essentially recreated Carpenter for a cameo in the Adam West Batman series (in a scene with Alan ""Fred Flintstone"" Reed, no less!), and became best known as the voice of Commissioner Gordon in the '90s BATMAN ANIMATED SERIES!

Gravely voiced Jackson Beck (...I can still hear him voicing commercials for Little Caesar's Pizza, and Thompson's Water Seal) is the Narrator and Perry White.

The first use (I believe), outside of comics, of Luthor, Brainiac, Mxyzptlk, Toyman, Prankster, Titano the Giant Ape, and a vastly different Parasite - who meets a bit of a shocking end for a mid-sixties Sat-AM cartoon.  Ditto for the ending of the second Brainiac episode.  No spoilers here!

And THIS justifies the price of admission... The extra feature: ""Superman in '66""!  Featured commentators include comic book writer Mark Waid, actor Mark Hamill, DC Publisher Paul Levitz, and Filmation's Lou Scheimer, among others.  Waid is so vocal, he practically hosts the thing!

They discuss Superman, the times socially and politically, Curt Swan, Mort Weisinger, and many, many Silver Age Superman comic book panels and pages are shown throughout.  Scheimer discusses the early days of Filmation, how they got the contract from DC to do Superman (...with more than a bit of bluffing and trickery -- that I'm surprised that he admits to here!), and how important Superman was to putting Filmation on the map, and its impact on Sat-AM TV for years to follow.

For any fan of TV animation, comic books, DC heroes, or the Silver Age in general, this is ONE GREAT FEATURE!

So, despite some serious flaws, I'd say buy The New Adventures of Superman DVD set... if you are a fan of any of the above categories.  Sit back and enjoy the ""title opening"" to each classic cartoon, where Superman flies THROUGH a brick wall that (as drawn) he could just as easily have flown around!

...Sometimes it's great to just accept stuff like this for its own sake!",1199232000,47,7984,4.860843819393042
2798839,5,B000OPODNQ,"I know the 1940s Fleischer Superman cartoons were classics, and I even own the DVD. But after seeing ""The New Adventures of Superman,"" I've permanently changed my preference.

Some people were disappointed with the bare-bones packaging, and lack of features. But that didn't bother me at all. I was far more interested in the picture quality which I thought was very good.

And unlike The New Adventures of Batman, there are real fights with real action in this show. This series fills the screen with gunfire, explosions, and plenty of good old-fashioned fist-fighting.

I was especially impressed with the stories and the artwork.

I never was very fond of the 1980s rework that not only dumbed down Superman's powers but basically reduced him to another helpless player being thrown about by chaos. He hardly seems super at all anymore.

But in New Adventures, Superman was everything that I liked about him: an invincible superhuman who really believed there was a difference between good guys and bad guys.

Seeing Superman's tremendous physical strength in action was a real treat. Among my favorite moments:

""The Force Phantom"" - Invading aliens frantically try to power up their artificial energy creature to withstand the power Superman's fists.

""The Deadly Icebergs"" - Three giant icebergs loaded with explosives threaten to obliterate a cruise ship. But Superman puts his brute strength to good use to keep the ship safe and still catch the crooks.

""The Invisible Raiders"" - When the Sorcerer threatens millions by creating a catastrophic earthquake, Superman dives deep into the earth and uses his bare hands to close the fissure

""The Toys of Doom"" - The riveting final scene shows Superman standing up to the Toyman's army of toy soldiers. As the toy army fires round after round of bullets, Superman just stands there and lets the torrent of bullets bounce of his chest.

""The Deadly Super Doll"" - The Sorcerer is simply no match against Superman's towering strength. In one scene, Jimmy Olsen is frozen with fright as the walls of a cave close in on him. Superman appears just in time to push the walls away.

The artwork is also really effective. While it's no surprise that artists make Superman massively built, this series seemed to do it in a way that brought out his titanic strength without all the steroid-induced overdefinition that is pretty much standard in modern-day comic books. Every time Clark Kent changed into his Superman outfit, it always struck me how gigantic Superman's arms were.

But if having a bad copy is better than none, I appreciate this being released, and through Amazon relatively cheaply.

The Adventures of Suberboy and Krypto shorts which screened inbetween 2 Superman shorts to fill out the original half hour when it screened decades ago, have not been included and hopefully they will be released on DVD as well. There were additional New Adventures of Superman episodes made as 2 parters in conjunction with screening with Aquaman (1967) and Batman & Robin (1968 version) and hopefully Warners will release those also in a Volume 2 as the quality of animation and stories actually improved. Great to hear Warners will roll out Aquaman on dvd this year October 23rd but disappointing the 1968 version Batman did not get released (yet). The mid to late 60's Filmation animation had it's own unique style of animation, voice over and soundtrack and by the 70's, it changed somewhat.
Would also be fantastic for Warners to also release the Hawkman, Flash, Green Lantern, the Atom, Justice League & Teen Titan animated shorts of 1967 which originally screened with Aquaman.

2798846,5,B000OPODNQ,"Let's get one thing straight: THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN was a monster hit for the out of the gate Filmation and CBS TV.
Thanks to TNAOS and Hanna-Barbera's SPACE GHOST AND DINO BOY Saturday mornings became super-hero heaven (and ratings gold).

Was the Filmation animation a touch ""austere""? Yes. Did I then, or now care? No. The show does now what it did in 1966: intertain me.

Filmation was small but they sure made what they had count. Hiring Jackson Beck for the narrations (he made every episode exciting), Joan Alexander as Lois Lane, and John Marion for music was smart (in my heart Marion's Superman music is just as good as John Williams'). Getting Bud Collyer to voice Superman was fate, luck, genius, and a blessing.

I didn't know at the time that Mr. Collyer had ""a little"" experience with The Man of Steel. All I knew was he made Superman sound great (and made the Clark Kent secret identity thing believable). To this day I get a chill when I hear Mr. Collyer's Clark Kent say: ""This is a job...FOR SUPERMAN""! And John Marion's background music during the costume change helped to make it cooler.

The show was (and still is) exciting. It's a damn same THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERBOY cartoons were not included (they were a reason why the show was a hit). Do us a favor Warner Bros? Settle it. The fans do not deserve this.

My only gripe is on the special feature. The featurette ""Superman in '66"" was ok but not enough time was spent discussing the show itself. The bulk of it talks alot about the Silver Age (where Superman reigned supreme). The best stuff comes from interviews with President of Warner Brothers Animation Sander Schwartz, DC Comics publisher Paul Levitz, Filmation co-founder Lou Scheimer, Filmation artist and historian Michael Swanigan, and actor Mark Hamill, a comic book/animation fan who proves he knows his stuff.

The coolest interview material comes from Filmation's Scheimer and historian Swanigan. There's a great story Scheimer shares about how Filmation bluffed DC into thinking they were a larger studio than they actually were in order to secure the right to do the cartoon. Waid on the other hand was given more screen time than he deserved and brings very little to the table. They should have interviewed series director Hal Sutherland (like they did for the STAR TREK: THE ANIMATED SERIES dvd)instead.

THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN will make a excellent addition to all Superman fans (and fans of classic super-hero animation)dvd shelves. The look and sound are pristine and damn cool to look at.
Filmation & Warner Bros...ya did good. Thank you.
(Now hurry up with the remaining episodes and be sure to include ALL the bumpers, trailers, and promos. Skimp nothing)

That's it. But let me sent a very special thanks to: Norm Prescott and Lou Schemer, John Marion, Jackson Beck, Joan Alexander, Hal Sutherland, and of course Bud Collyer.
Thank you for showing to me FIRST how incredibly cool Superman is (and always will be).
And thanks to Warner Bros for the dvd reminder.",1183680000,8,3030,4.813461538461539
2798847,4,B000OPODNQ,"Although I grew up watching (reruns of) the George Reeves t.v. series, I was always disappointed that they never included any comic-book villains.  Filmation's terrific animated show, despite its flaws, definitely delivered on the comic-book action.  AND those wonderful super-villains!

Each episode moves at a brisk pace (they're only about 6 minutes apiece), and contains enough colorful action to satifsy die-hard comic book fans.  Plots involving alien invaders, giant chimps, etc. may seem ""cheesy"" to more jaded viewers of today, but the series was very much in-line with what was happening in the Superman comics of the era.

Fans of the seventies's ""Challenge of the Superfriends"" will probably like these, but they may seem pretty dated to folks whose primarily knowledge of the character comes from ""Smallville"" (I'm not knocking that show...I like it quite a bit, actually).  The only real downside to ""The New Adventures of Superman"" is that the animation is a bit limited.  But if you've seen ANY Filmation series, you know about what to expect.

I hope Super-fans will support this release so we can see the rest of the Filmation DC Comics shows from the sixites.",1183593600,23,1178,5.130890052356021
