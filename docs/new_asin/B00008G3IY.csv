7982434,5,B00008G3IY,"I am an exerciser,and aerobicise is my new workout I am trying out. Filmed back in the early 1980s,this is the first aerobicise workout I tryed. I hope to try out the other ones soon.
  This tape is great,I don`t care if it is dated or not I think the music on it is terrific and gets you moving. It includes killer toning exercises that will make you sore the next day,aerobics that I think are very easy to follow and they are fun to do. I have been doing this tape for a while now and I am feeling and seeing the difference. This tape is not for beginners but start doing it slowly you will catch on. All of the pretty girls who are instructing have no shoes on and are doing the workout in their bare feet. You can wear shoes if you want to,if thats what you are used to. You will love the aerobics,thay are so fun to do and give you a sweat. If you are man sitting down to just watch the tape thats fine too,but if your a woman like I am and want to get into shape with a great workout than join in with aerobicise. These girls are very motivating. Great workout",1181865600,2,1067,4.028301886792453
7982435,5,B00008G3IY,"I have no interest in actually doing aerobics, but put Darcy DeMoss in a white leotard and have her bend herself into a yummy human pretzel and I'm there. There is something more erotic about watching these women excercise than the most explicit hardcore pornography. I mean, I SUPPOSE one could buy the tape and actually DO the aerobics...let me know how that works out for you.",1171497600,3,379,4.6716417910447765
