8699662,1,B00SX54CS0,"In spite of the cover, this is not a werewolf film. Some young adults working as reporters/investigators go to an abandoned military base and discover a creature which is ""way way above top secret."" The creature does project a wolf-like silhouette but when we get glimpses of the creature face on, it looks more simian and couldn't possibly project a wolf-like silhouette.

The film consisted mostly of people talking on  walkies-talkie interrupted by an occasional attack of which we see very little. Low budget. Bad sound track. Boring script. 71 very long minutes

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1430611200,2,600,5.040404040404041
