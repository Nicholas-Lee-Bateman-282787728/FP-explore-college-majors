5168430,2,B008KOCJV6,But this is just a personal opinion.  My son didn't find it exciting and it just didn't keep him interested.  We just have to keep looking for something else that is as exciting and captivating as Grouchland.  Now that was 5 Stars!  Even me and my husband like that movie.,1156723200,,272,4.38
5168431,5,B008KOCJV6,My 6 year old is non-verbal and a movie fanatic.  He had Elmo's Cookbook years ago and wore it out - this year that was all he wanted from Santa - 1 hour after opening it he accidentally cracked the dvd - and was heartbroken.  Thus the reason for re-ordering - this is a wonderful movie!!!!!!!!,1143072000,2,294,4.232142857142857
5168432,5,B008KOCJV6,We have watched this video over and over.  Emeril is fun with Elmo and the children.  We also loved the segment with Heather the Queen of Pockets.  This video encourages young children to try new foods.  Our family highly recommends this video.,1141689600,,244,4.738095238095238
5168433,4,B008KOCJV6,"This is the selected video of choice so often that I believe I've memorized the words...Emeril is a marketing brand name ""king""...when my 4 year old goes to the store and shouts ""Mommy, there's Emeril"" you know something's going right!",1131408000,,235,4.9
5168434,1,B008KOCJV6,"I rented this so my son could watch his favorite chef, Emeril Lagasse, in tandem with his favorite show, Sesame Street - and I will admit that we all liked the Emeril (and Telly) part.
That being said, this is another of the variety of Sesame Street videos that uses contrived setups, bad puppetry, celebrity appearances, and educational drivel to spoon-feed information to toddlers like they were so many fois gras geese.  Ugh!
Yes, there's loads of Elmo for fans.  There's also a blue-screened flying puppet to push the contrived plot forwards.  The REAL Sesame clips are few and far between; most of the plot takes place in the kitchen set, and the songs are all ""new."" To top it off, they have Broadway star Heather Headly appearing to make Vietnamese Summer Rolls, and sing a heartrending song about trying new foods.  What does Heather Headly have to do with food?  Why aren't her considerable talents used in a video about music or singing or acting?
So - don't buy this.  Buy ""Let's Eat"" if you're looking for a fun Sesame Street video about food.",1045094400,9,1055,4.675675675675675
5168435,5,B008KOCJV6,"My daughter absolutely ADORED this video at 18 months.  And she still does a year later.  Even though we no longer view it twice a day, it has leaked into our everyday life in several ways. For instance, she pretends to not want to try new foods so that I will sing the Pocket Queen song.  It works-she'll try almost anything.
Yes, I find Genie a little annoying. But, the little girl in this video is destined for a career in the entertainment field.  She is really good.  Of course, Heather Headly is enchanting.
I think the only down side is that my daughter also tries to BAM her food sometimes at the dinner table!",1038873600,11,619,4.3478260869565215
5168436,4,B008KOCJV6,"Our 18 month old daughter, who would happily watch Elmo talk for two hours about income tax returns, thinks this video is just great!  It has music, kids, Elmo, food, Elmo . . . in short, she stares at the TV during the entire thing, with the awed silence of the true Elmophile.  However, I find it a little tedious.  This is definitely one of those ""Okay, Mommy's going into the other room now . . ."" tapes.  So just for all you parents out there who care how YOU'LL like the video, here's my two cents.
For one thing, cooking is a subject that not all kids are going to take to.  I suppose the idea behind the tape is that kids should learn that they CAN cook (with help).  The treats Elmo and his friends prepare include kid favorites like pizza and ice cream.  But some kids probably just want to eat these things, and couldn't care less about how to make them.  They might find the tape a little dull.
Also, the kids on this tape are just adorable, but a little older than the usual Sesame Street crowd (I'm guessing they're about 7 or 8).  Obviously, they needed kids who were capable of doing the cooking-related tasks on the video, which leads me to believe that three or four year olds might not be able to ""cook"" as well as Elmo and his friends do here.  But slightly older kids who wish they were Emeril and haven't outgrown Sesame Street are a perfect audience!
The musical numbers here are a bit grating, but not as bad as all that.  If you can get over the annoying voice of the Genie character who helps our friends in the kitchen, and ignore the unfunny food puns, you'll get to see Emeril give a brief lesson in pizza-making.  To me, it looks like he'd rather be somewhere else, but maybe this is his usual expression.  The kids do get to ""bam"" toppings on the pizza, by the way.
The highlight of the video comes toward the very end, when the ""Pocket Queen"" (who writes this stuff?) teaches Elmo about pocket-shaped food.  Her song about taking a chance and giving new things a try is great!  Very pretty duet with Elmo, and a nice message to boot.  I can forgive this tape its flaws for this wonderful two minutes.
Writing: B-, Music: B+, Elmo-Onscreen-Time: A+",1003017600,33,2179,4.3432098765432094
5168437,5,B008KOCJV6,"I think one of the greatest joys in life is seeing things through children's minds.  My older son loves watching Emeril cook and of course loves Elmo and my younger son loves Elmo as well.  When this video came out, it was the perfect gift for both of them.  This video has many songs that stick with the children because of it's catchy words and beats.  Elmo and his Sesame Street friends really make cooking fun and enjoyable.  They teach about ingredients, different cooking phrases, cooking utensils, how to follow directions, different foods and how to work together.  The video is definitely beneficial and demonstrates positive attitudes in the kitchen and with friends.  My son breaks out the pots and pans and makes believe he is cooking and he tells me what ingredients and how much he is going to put it.  This proves to me that the video is educational, yet fun to look at because he really enjoys himself.  Cooking doesn't have to be a chore.  It can be a rewarding experience when your children actually understand what they are doing.",987552000,13,1049,4.683060109289618

5168442,5,B008KOCJV6,"So I don't like this movie as I find it less colorful or fun than others,  but my son really likes it and that's what counts. He specifically asks for Elmo and Telly. This is a little older video, has guest stars, and they make different foods together with a fairy type character. It follows a story line of teaching Elmo and Telly that though they are kids they can make food too.",1412985600,,382,4.232876712328767

5168447,5,B008KOCJV6,"That was the quote from my (now 7-year old) when she was 2 and knew that Chef Emeril had cooked with Elmo.  She watched Emeril Live with my husband and me and then (of course) was a HUGE fan of Sesame Street.  I don't remember what Chef Emeril did, but to hear my then 2-year old say ""Chef Emeril, so kind"" was a riot and has stuck with me, even though we now have a 4 year old and an almost 2 year old who have watched this.  Very fun DVD, great mix of Emeril's personality and Sesame Street!",1356566400,,493,3.95959595959596

5168451,5,B008KOCJV6,"I bought this for my niece who is learning Chinese - she is 4 and going to a Chinese immersion school in Washington DC. She loves watching this title and the other ones too that are in Chinese. Parents only allow for the programming she watches to be in chinese so that this was the perfect gift. I plan to get her more of them (all of them) and I think it's great. Good for any bilingual child! highly recommend. The content is so simple that they can not only understand what is going on but based on the context, they can learn a new language too - what a great way to learn a language! I am in!

5168453,5,B008KOCJV6,My son absolutely loves this movie. He has had it for over a year and still watches it weekly. My only complaint is that the guest actors like emeril look like they are reading off script boards. But it really emphasizes healthy eating and is darling. My son likes to help me cook so it was right up his alley. Got it when he was turning three and now he is four and a half.,1307491200,,374,4.0

5168457,5,B008KOCJV6,"I got this after seeing Elmo on ""Emeril Live"" one night, and Emeril is in Elmo's DVD.  Elmo is so cute, and through his eagerness to learn he encourages children to learn.  He's a good example for children.  Elmo actually does some of the cooking in this one.  The guy behind Elmo is brilliant.  He knows what's good for children to see and hear, and he certainly has the right voice for this character.  I would recommend anything with Elmo in it.",1169078400,2,448,4.402439024390244
