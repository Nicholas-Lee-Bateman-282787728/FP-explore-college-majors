294220,4,6300271358,"Brilliant storytelling (almost fable-like original novel by Paul Theroux) highlights this underrated film of a man's quest for -God only knows.
Idealistic inventor Allie Fox (Harrison Ford) packs up the wife  and kids, and heads off to the deep part of the Central American jungle,  with an ice-making machine, no less.
A man of unquenchable thirst, Fox's  obsessive, driving quest destroys not only himself and his family, but all  that surrounds him as well. There can be no satisfaction in his world, no  accomplishment, no salvation.
Saul Zaentz (English Patient) produced and  Peter Weir (Truman Show) directed, this Paul Schrader script. That's a good  enough reason to suggest right here, but Ford is brilliant as he turns from  idealistic inventor to self-described deity.
Beautiful jungle landscapes  only add to the experience.
But the moral to the story is?",952992000,4,868,5.231884057971015
294221,4,6300271358,"For fans of director Peter Weir, whose films deal exclusively with themes of man confronting his destiny and / or madness, ""The Mosquito Coast"" is his greatest effort.  Here, Harrison Ford plays Allie Fox, a  heartland family man sidelining as a eccentric inventor who grows weary of  the disenchanting greed and (what he perceives as) disintegration of  America.  He moves his family to South America where he ends up purchasing  a small village, and successfully creates his own primal vision of utopia.  Through a series of problems he fails to see as beyond his control (nature,  internal turmoil, religious & milirary interferences) his utopia begins  to crumble and Allie resorts to the selfish, materialistic American ideals  he so venemously despised.  However, Allie cannot see his own faults as he  clings desperately to a dream that is ravaging himself & his family.  The descension sends him into a palpable madness as his family helplessly  watches.  No screenwriter other than Paul Schrader communicates madness  better.  Ford unarguably delivers his best performance EVER; no other  character portrayed by Ford has been given so much emotion and freedom to  use (it would of been more appropriate for Ford to receive an Oscar  nomination for Best Actor for this film rather than for ""Witness""  - also directed by Weir).
In some ways this film is more difficult than  the Schrader-scripted ""Taxi Driver"" or Weir's  ""Fearless"", which also deal with themes of dementia.  Typically,  what you receive is a character who is either combating their madness or  completely unaware of it.  With this film, inventor Allie Fox embraces his  madness because he sees it as the only catalyst to his freedom.  A powerful  and overlooked film.",947289600,7,1742,5.117857142857143
294222,5,6300271358,"Say about this movie what you want, if you like Harrison Ford because of his acting ability, this is the movie to watch.  Ford gives an enticing, complex, and multi-facetted performance as Allie Fox, a man with a vision  of utopia, blind to the reality that binds him.  With his vision and  inventions, Fox takes his family into the rain forests of Central America,  where he sets a chain of events in motion that soon eludes his control and  --in the destructive devastation released on man and nature-- the scope of  his imagination.
Mr. Ford's portrayal of this driven, and in the end  obsessed man is not that of a simple villain.  Through Allie Fox, Mr. Ford  brings to the screen a range of emotions no other character has ever  allowed him to explore and does an amazing job with.  This is the kind of  performance that desrves an Academy Award.
A great, albeit less popular  follow up to 'Witness,' 'The Mosquito Coast' reunites Ford with Australian  director Peter Weir. This is a great movie, visual and character driven.  Finally, it is available in the grand widescreen format it deserves!",945302400,37,1101,4.71578947368421

movie also.  There is a dark side to Genius and heroism as Harrison Ford played the lead role of an eccentric, brilliant inventor with 9 patents - and 6 pending approval.  The inventor takes his wife and 4 children into the remote jungles on the Mosquito Coast of Central America with the intent to carve out a new society.  This adventure includes elements of true life in regards to native tribes, roving bands of robbers/squatters and the hostile environment of a jungle with a river delta that evolve into a real test of survival.  The conclusion of this movie demonstrates tragedy is equal in the outcome to success.  Jerome Hellman s' production is a marvelous adaptation of Paul Theroux's bestseller.",1442534400,2,846,4.8

294547,5,6300271358,"I am a ""child"" of the 80s, and loved the big blockbusters (and at the top of that list, Star Wars and Indiana Jones). Harrison Ford was and
still is an idol of mine.

When I first saw Mosquito Coast on video in the late 80's, my expectations were of a grand adventure in the tradition of Indiana
Jones. I just rewatched the trailer for the film, and the narrator literally mentions Indiana Jones and says that this is ""Ford's biggest
adventure yet."" The trailer is almost 100% composed of explosions, which again completely sets the wrong expectations. So when I saw it as
a young teenager, I was thoroughly disappointed at the lack of action. There was just too much pesky dialog and not enough ""good parts."" Not
enough explosions, by golly! Well, almost 30 years later, the film holds up incredibly well, and I find it infinitely more enjoyable than
that first viewing. In my mind I put it in a category of ""Ford's boring movie"", but now I see it as one of his finest acting performances
(possibly his best), and the story and production of the film has an artistic quality that was completely unappreciated by kids in the 80s,
and even critics in the 80s (Roger Ebert gave it a thumbs down for being too boring).

If this movie was released today, I would not be surprised to find it on the Best Picture nomination list, and Ford up for best actor (and
River Phoenix for supporting actor). The film is just incredible. The underlying storyline about consumerism is as relevant today as ever.
The characters are unpredictable, yet you can identify with them. The location shooting adds a dimension and authenticity to the film that
just cannot be replaced by filming on a Hollywood studio backlot.

In summary, I highly recommend this film and plan on adding it to my very limited personal collection of treasured movies (right next to
Indiana Jones!).",1430352000,,1854,4.646341463414634

A young & vibrant , Harrison Ford, & Helen Mirren play wonderfully off each other! A strong supporting role, solidly performance by a gifted young River Phoenix, who left us way way too soon! It's not a conventional movie, but I feel fabulously well made!  It is based on the novel by Paul Theroux. The film tells the story of a family that leaves the United States and tries to find a happier and simpler life in the jungles of Central America. However, their jungle paradise quickly turns into a dystopia as their stubborn father's behavior becomes increasingly erratic and aggressive. It was shot in the cities of Cartersville and Rome in Georgia, in addition to Baltimore, Maryland, and Belize.

294775,5,6300271358,"A long-running sidewinder of a film, you don't know how quite to receive Allie Fox's character, as his headstrong plunge into the mosquito coast (Central America, Atlantic side) is both fiercely reckless and enviably adventurous / domineering. One can understand some of his opinions and frustrations: the US has seemingly sold itself down the river, allowing a homogenous surrounding society to encircle the resourceful individual to cope on his own, seeking freedom via removal and distance.  But obviously no sane man would bring his family to a third world blank slate!

This premise makes for a unique film, both harrowing and exciting (fun even) at times, but seems nigh impossible. But this feeling of impossibility, prods an ironic finger at the viewer as if to tauntingly bring in to question the feasibility of such a course of action. As strange and uncertain as it may be, life in the great unknown might be better for some, than the cyclical baseline economy of service and consumerism we today in the west (and increasingly the world) live in, and are told to enjoy.

A vicarious experience, and perhaps escapist at its core, The Mosquito Coast presents Fox's vision upon an unsuspecting group of natives and reinforces the thematic outcomes of man's grappling of nature through caustic technological means. Something here resonates (albeit on a more domestic level) with W Herzog's Aguirre the Wrath of God, Kurt Vonnegut's novel Galapagos and Jacques Ellul's powerful The Technological Society, all great considerations in themselves.

This is a great film, albeit a little long-winded, turning a trendy topic of today, of weighing the merits of technological society against its run-amok detriments, into a riveting allegorical portrait of one man's struggle against the unchallenged, uncontrolled tide. Sad to say, they really don't make movies like this any more, and if they do, not with such a strong lead of Ford as Dr Allie Fox.  Another great allegorical lesson, as well as a oftentimes a visual treat.",1379721600,,2026,5.145896656534954

294833,5,6300271358,"The thin line between genius and madness aptly describes the central figure, Allie Fox, in Paul Therouxs novel Mosquito Coast, told through the eyes of a teenage boy whose admiration of his father borders on hero worship. Fox is an inventor, philosopher, mechanical whiz and all-around handy man who eschews consumerism and views most people as scavengers and thieves. Fox (cleverly named) thinks through hard work he can improve upon the ills of society and create an ideal utopia by harnessing energy and resources to create a self-sustaining lifestyle.  In this novel, the fathers spiral into madness is revealed through sharp dialogue and action, defined by his single-minded purpose as he takes his family on a perilous journey into the unknown. Allies distain for religion, social order, and materialism and his self-aggrandizing conviction that he alone can improve the world, leads to his ultimate Prometheus-like self-destruction when he is dispelled by his sons and, like Prometheus, his life ends in a torturous death.
Allie is a man of many talents; self-educated, with mechanical aptitude, and a sharp-witted tongue.  His cynicism and distain of society is revealed as he rails against consumerism and big business, while preaching the sins of wastefulness and the importance of getting work done.  His disillusionment with American culture dissolves into distain for his boss and life, and results in his desire to flee the confines of Hatfield, Massachusetts. In his ambitious quest to build a better society, he hatches a plan to take his family of six to live in the jungle coastline of Honduras. Like Prometheus,  the Titan god of forethought and crafty counsel who was entrusted with the task of molding mankind out of clay, Allie attempts to better the lives of his creation. In the myth, Promethus steals fire from heaven and delivers it to mortal kind hidden inside a fennel-stalk. (theoi.com) Allie creates ice from fire for what he feels is the survival of man in the form of a refrigerator he names Fat Boy in a cornfield.  As punishment for Prometheus rebellious acts, Zeus ordered the creation of Pandora (the first woman) as a means to deliver misfortune into the house of man, or as a way to cheat mankind of the company of the good spirits. (theoi.com).  Similarly, Allie invites three strangers into his Garden of Eden, then destroys them by blowing up his invention, ending the saga in evil destruction. In the myth, Prometheus is arrested and bound to a stake on Mount Kaukasos where an eagle was set to feed upon his ever-regenerating liver (or, some say, heart) (theio.com). In Mosquito Coast, Allie continues to go against the current and in the end is bound in chains by his sons, then crawls upon a mound of rocks where buzzards feed upon his carcass.  The eerie myth-like similarities and symbolism Theroux incorporates throughout Mosquito Coast serves to make this work a brilliant and timeless masterpiece and when reading about the birds feeding upon the breast, the reader cant help but to recall the myth of Prometheus.",1365379200,2,3063,5.029585798816568

Helen Mirren is also one of my favorites and she did not disappoint.  Many modern movies this dramatic seem to be relying on multiple special effects to create thrills, but this story needs little of that.  Ford's character becomes more and more puzzling as the plot thickens and mesmerizes, but it all comes together, as it should.

If you are looking for the usual mind-numbing special effects or car chases, move on.  This is Harrison Ford's best work, ever.  Although it is frustrating to watch things unravel, you have to admire the spirit of Allie Fox.  Sure he goes a bit mad, but when you try to escape the phoniness of America and find yourself confronted by a typical looney tele-evangelist who represents every thing you despise, you would come unglued also.

Most people think this movie has a sad ending, but I thought it had a great and satisfying ending.  Allie is laying on his back on a raft, paralyzed and about to die from a gunshot from the phony preacher. An aerial shot shows the raft about to leave the jungle, yet when he asks his wife ""Are we still heading upstream Mother?"", and since she has always loved him, she lies and says ""Yes Dear"" to some beautiful ending music.

294952,4,6300271358,"There was a time, in my youth, when I was utterly obsessed with this movie.  I thought it was the greatest film I had ever seen, and without hesitation I was recommending it left and right to everyone I knew.

Yes, I was a film critic even at the ripe-old-age of eight.

As I got older I had the fondest of memories of this film and continued to recommend it when talking with friends, despite the fact that it had been years since I'd seen it.  So, without much prodding, I sat down with the wife to indulge this childhood favorite and I was reminded of why I loved it so much, but I found that I was also more critical of the film than I had been in those years growing up.

The film, which is beautifully shot and expertly acted, has some trouble with its footing towards the end.  In fact, the whole second half seems to wobble from the initial shock of the plot.  It actually suffers from similar focal issues seen in another River Phoenix 80's film; `Running on Empty'.  The shift from Allie Fox's abrasive `New World Order' to his son's determination to separate from it derails some of the subtle intensity created in the film's outset, and while the film's finale feels authentic and somewhat appropriate, it also feels (and this is with years between viewings) to be somewhat predictable and clich&eacute;d.

Still, `The Mosquito Coast' is a ravishingly engrossing film with stellar performances by Harrison Ford (a career highlight for the mere fact that this is SO far removed from his usual fare), River Phoenix (such a bright young star who left us too soon) and especially Helen Mirren (so internally ferocious and infectiously commanding; I just love her early work).  The lush cinematography, accompanied by Wier's depth of directorial scope keep the film moving at a brisk pace and draw us even, even when plotting difficulties begin to fray the films tightly woven beginnings.

294954,4,6300271358,"""Mosquito Coast"" (1986) is directed by Peter Weir (Picnic at Hanging Rock, Dead Poets Society). The film is about a brilliant inventor, Allie Fox (Harrison Ford), who decides to leave the United States in order to seek a better life in the jungles of the Mosquito Coast (Honduras/Belize). He builds a small settlement with local residents and creates a larger version of his ice making machine, but things start to go wrong when he meets up with a tribe of aborigines and a group of bandits. Helen Mirren also stars as his wife, and River Phoenix as his son.

The dvd looks okay though the early part of the film has a lot of noticeable dust particles, however, as the film progresses these seem less apparent. There are no special features included.

295003,4,6300271358,"""The Mosquito Coast"" came out in late 1986 and bombed; it was the only film Harrison Ford starred in that failed to make back what it cost (which was $25 million; only bringing in $14 million).

THE PLOT: Ford stars as Allie Fox, a genius inventor who ""dropped out of Harvard to get an education."" He hates what America has become so takes his family to the Mosquito Coast in Central America where he buys a 'town' on a river in the middle of nowhere. They work hard at building a small egalitarian society and he builds a colossal ice machine, becoming the local hero. But that's not enough for him. His megalomania brings him into conflict with his country, with religion/God, with nature, with people and, finally, with his very own family. As the saying goes, ""Pride goeth before destruction.""

I can see why the film bombed at theaters; this is not an entertaining movie in the conventional sense, so don't seek it out for that purpose. Also, Ford usually plays likable heroes in his films, whereas here he's an anti-hero or, more accurately, a raving lunatic. Yes, he still possesses a glimmer of his likable charisma, at first, and his leadership skills, genius and work ethic are all admirable, but all in all he's a rude, obnoxious know-it-all, not to mention a naive idealist, despite his smarts. This is depicted in the opening scenes where Allie takes his son to a hardware store and reams out the clerk (Jason Alexander before Seinfeld fame) because the product he wants was made in Japan; like the the guy had anything to do with that decision (rolling my eyes). Also, Allie successfully starts an impressive utopia-of-sorts in the jungle but he unwisely fails to bring guns for protection. Did he think he could create 'paradise' without savage wolves preying on it?

""The Mosquito Coast"" is a very odd film and is therefore hard to rate, but for what it is it's good and even great in some ways. It brings to mind other eccentric hard-to-classify jungle films like ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Fitzcarraldo,"" ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God,"" ""Sorcerer"" and, believe it or not, Clark Griswold and the ""Vacation"" flicks. It's obviously a psychological study with the requisite lessons, some of which include: [Don't read further unless you've seen the film]

- The aforementioned ""Pride goeth before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.""
- In trying to escape society, a person will eventually mirror its evils. Society, regardless of its quality (pleasant or miserable), is largely inescapable. It's like the only salesman in town. He can cuss you out, charge whatever he wants, and even beat you with the item you need/desire. You can either take this or try to make the product yourself, which may be difficult or nigh impossible. Allie didn't like it so he went elsewhere. It takes a unique person to pick up and leave the comforts of society, a strong and talented person. However, such a personality usually has a dark side, which isn't revealed until the second half of the picture. What happens when/if this 'dark side' goes unchecked? Eventually, Allie becomes an inescapable society unto himself. His family cannot leave him for the same reasons he couldn't leave society: inability to procure food and shelter, lack of safety, lack of luxury, etc. Allie provides them with all these. In return, he requires their complete loyalty in working toward his goals and tolerates no disobedience. He becomes the same monster as the society he so badly wanted to leave. Hence, his son (River Phoenix) becomes the person he was at the beginning, albeit the dictatorial 'society' his son is trying to escape is Allie himself!
- The inherent problems of a utopian society in a dystopian world. Their little village was for all intents and purposes practically perfect: self-sufficient, organized, ecologically sound, non-violent, etc. Then a few thugs with guns come along and ruin everything. It's basically saying that human society has and always will be dominated by those with the power to kill. In creating a perfect society, Allie didn't think ahead to the prospect of negative external influences. He thought he could isolate himself from the insanity and madness of the rest of the world. As a naive idealist, Allie really didn't want to face or accept the possibility of violence or having to protect his town. It's just common sense that anything good will tried to be taken sooner or later by someone bad. Allie may have been correct in criticizing America for its decadence and allowing a culture of greed & stupidity to flourish, but he was wrong to criticize America for having a strong military with formidable weapons.
- No matter where you go in this world corruption/evil/violence exists. Even if you're at a lagoon that's not on a map, pieces of corruption will naturally float ashore. Nature itself is corrupt: Nature's heat burns your skin like fire then drowns you in a flood, not to mention you slowly grow old and eventually die. Even if you're intelligent and talented enough to overcome all such external problems, what about the evil within that we're so easily blinded to, like arrogance, hatred, stubbornness and envy?
- What creates a better lasting society -- science/technology or Christianity/religion? Or Both? The film shows both Allie and the missionary, Spellgood, taking their families to the Mosquito Coast to start societies. Allie's society fails because of his devolving megalomania, whereas Spellgood's is obviouly successful -- his village is clean, orderly and happy; they have built a magnificent church and comfortable housing; his people are clothed and fed; they sing so sweetly that Allie's children mistake them for angels. Spellgood's people may have given up some freedom but in return they had a thriving, disciplined society. Spellgood's success naturally gives birth to another evil within Allie's heart -- envy. He becomes so envious and hateful, in fact, that he literally tries to incinerate Spellgood's jungle utopia! It should be pointed out that Spellgood isn't depicted in the film as the 'good guy.' It's obvious that he's a bit of a loon himself with the typical negative conotations of Christian ministers usually seen in movies. In fact, it's clear that Spellgood is a megalomaniac like Allie. So what's the difference between the two? Unlike Allie, Spellgood has faith in and submits to something beyond himself, something greater -- God -- and this belief and reverence keeps his pride in check, that is, keeps him humble. Evidence of this is shown in the church scene where the congregation watches Spellgood on tv; his sermon doesn't attempt to bring glory to himself but rather focuses on teaching the people how to commune with the Almighty, using a telephone as a simple object lesson. Which brings us to...
- Having no faith except in yourself is not good. Allie believed that technology and his genius alone would save them, but it was this that destroyed them. Allie had no faith but in himself. When this happens one's pride remains unchecked and will run its natural course. Most important to him was freedom -- yet only for himself, he was a tyrant with his family; such freedom leaves him dead and his family alienated, impoverished and lost, yet thankfully not totally without hope.

One great scene to watch for is when Allie's giant ice machine explodes, literally creating hell on earth; look for his horrified/astonished expression as he gazes at the annhilation of his dream.

The tropical scenes were shot in Belize, which is just North of the actual Mosquito Coast in Eastern Nicaragua/Honduras. This area wasn't named after the insect but rather the Miskito natives, the word being butchered into 'Mosquito' by European settlers.",1269302400,,7727,4.972157772621809

Was I wrong!!  Ford gives such a great performance that he should've at least be given an Oscar nomination but unfortunately like another island saga, ""The Mission"", ""Coast"" did poor business at the box office.  This is a thought provoking action tale with superb performances from not only from Ford, but also from Helen Mirren as his long suffering wife, the late River Phoenix as his loyal son and Andre Gregory as his nemesis, the bible thumping minister.  But it's Harrison's riveting performance that will keep you glued to your seat plus astounding cinematography and Peter Weir's fine direction (too bad they haven't made any other films after this).",1226102400,2,987,4.863095238095238
295040,4,6300271358,"Mosquito Coast, along with Witness and Presumed Innocent, for me cemented Harrison Ford as the greatest actor of my early adult years.

While Witness was universally praised (as it should have been) Mosquito Coast flew under the radar for many, and truly it is a depressing film. Recently I found a copy in the bargain bin at a video store and brought it home, and my wife had no recollection of ever seeing it before. When I found her in the right mood to sit down and pay attention to it, we watched this moving story about a good man's descent into darkness and madness.

So here's the deal, Mosquito Coast is not an entertaining film; you may hate it if that's what you are looking for. However, if you are in the mood for a psychological study of how good intentions can go awry, then this is a movie that has some of the best dramatic acting you will ever see.

295042,4,6300271358,"This film grabbed my attention immediately and didn't let go until the final scene.  The main character, Allie Fox, played brilliantly by Harrison Ford is shown at first to be an eccentric guy who dropped out of Harvard ""to get an education.""  He has a beautiful, intelligent looking wife, played by Helen Mirren who is apparently homeschooling her four kids, and they seem to be living a happy life in the country somewhere.  Yes, he's a bit opinionated and is not shy about sharing his worldview, which is that the USA is going down the tubes, but he is warm and enterprising and obviously loves and is adored by his family.

Like others before him, he decides to put his ideals to the test.  He has enormous confidence in his ""genius"" and his ideas and the trusting wife and four small kids leave everything behind, the dishes in the sink, and go with him to some jungle in Central America.  I kept trying to like this guy, especially as I saw his wife's unquestioning faith in him, even though I found him annoying---not the kind of guy you'd want to get stuck with in a conversation at a party.

En route to their destination they meet up with a Christian missionary, played with religious zeal by Andre Gregory (of ""My Dinner with Andre"").  Fox hates religion and can out-quote the Bible to the minister. You might think that he'd be glad to make friends with the only other white people in the area, but his supreme arrogance brands everyone who differs from his opinions as bad.  In this way the missionary is a perfect mirror for him, but he doesn't get the clue.  He is as intolerant and narrow minded in his own vision, as he accuses the minister of being.

He buys a town from a drunken German and they set about to create their own utopia.  The town comes with some local inhabitants and Fox embraces them and enlists their help in building the place up.  There is a little racism here in that all of the natives are seen as good and all of the other white folks are seen as bad.  Of course he is the ""Father""--the one who is in charge, because he bought the place.

At first his superior mechanical abilities and tremendous work ethic pay off and they build a lovely little village with gardens and everyone looks happy.  He builds his special invention, a huge ice maker, which he feels is his supreme contribution to the world---bringing ice to the jungle.  It's a big hit with the natives but he isn't content with being the local hero; he learns that there are some natives a ways away and he forces his family and friends to lug large hunks of ice to show these folks.

Well, things go downhill from there on...some Whites who are armed with machine guns come for a visit and, things go from bad to very bad.  Fox doesn't ever give in and even as he drags his family into increasingly distressing situations he turns his back at every offer of help.  He becomes more and more paranoid and tyrannical and ends up being more destructive than he probably ever could have imagined.

As interesting as the events are, what is the most fascinating is the character development of the Fox family.  We see the initial seeds of megalomania in Allie while he's still at home, and once he's on his own and is truly the king of his little kingdom, it gets worse.  The unfortunate memories of Jim Jones did flash across my mind as I watched this.  The two sons provide the most touching parts of the story.  They obviously idolize their father in the beginning, but as things progress they are forced to realize that he is deluded and putting everyone in danger.  This can't be easy for any young boy.

What I had a problem with was the characterization of Fox's wife, whom he calls ""mother.""  As played by Helen Mirren, she seems to be a highly intelligent, beautiful, strong woman and that's the problem.  I haven't read the novel so I don't know how she's portrayed there.  As wonderful an actress as Mirren is, I think she is really miscast, because such a strong smart woman would have stood up to her husband much earlier on.  Maybe Mirren just can't play weak, submissive women and I think that this is the major flaw in the film.  Love for her husband is one thing, but putting her children in increasingly riskier situations is another.

Ford shines here as a complex character--so much more interesting than his other ""hero"" roles.  The kids are good.  The scenery is gorgeous.  The music is good.  It's definitely a worthwhile film.",1205798400,2,4449,4.50936329588015
295043,5,6300271358,"""The Mosquito Coast"" is one of the unheralded great films of the Eighties.  I read Paul Theroux's novel after seeing the film on video and mesmerizing a book as it was I realized that though not unfilmable it would be difficult to translate to the screen.  Director Peter Weir and writer Paul Schrader succeeded.  What one would find problematic in the book is the Allie Fox character is a tad unsympathetic.  What Harrison Ford has achieved without compromising the character is imbuing Allie with a little empathy.  This demonstrates to those who would relegate Ford to the Han Solo or Indiana Jones parts what a consummate actor he is.  Another difficult part is the one assayed by Helen Mirren as Mother.  A lesser actress would lead you to believe that Mother is spineless and compliant in indulging her husband's preposterous whims.  Watch Mirren in the closing moments of the film and you realize that Mother acquieses to Allie more out of love than a lack of backbone.  Lastly, the late lamented River Phoenix makes his mark as the Fox's oldest son torn between idolizing adoration for his father and repulsion toward's Allie's thoughtless cruelty.  The film contains lush tropic scenery and a haunting score by Maurice Jarre.

295086,3,6300271358,"The movie is based on a book by the prodigal Paul Theroux. It is centered around Allie Fox (Harrison Ford) and his family's migration to the remote and enigmatic Mosquito Coast. The tropical jungle gives Allie a virgin ground for creating a superior civilization. Surprisingly, he thinks ice is synonymous with civilization and builds a monstrous machine that generates ice, air-conditioning and condensed water. The ice-making machine is called Fat Boy. It is a giant manifestation of his creative genius. He hikes (lugging ice blocks) to remote Indian villages to proudly show them ice that he created. Not surprisingly, the Fat Boy initiates the sudden collapse of his remote & superior civilization. Thereafter, he gets madly obsessed to create another (more elemental) civilization on an unmapped place and exposes his family to great peril, hardships and hunger. He nurtures a strong dislike towards the missionaries operating in rural-rural Mosquito. His dislike towards them and the disappointment of failing in multiple attempts to create & sustain a civilization leads him to burning down a mission city. The reprisal is strong and he is shot & fatally wounded.

If you've read the book, then (subconsciously) you'll be trying to relate every scene to the book and will always be disappointed because the movie seems to move very fast. At times it'll be digressing from the book's story line and other times, it'll be an exact enactment. The mental picture painted by the mind while reading the book is very vivid & colorful compared to the scenes depicted in the movie.
I think movies based on wonderful & compelling books/novels should spend some time building the initial story (as in the book). In the movie, it would have helped if the director would have spent some more time showing Allie, his family members, his creational genius and his plot to migrate to the Mosquito Coast. The director should not assume that everyone watching the movie has read the book. That is the best approach for a mixed audience (folks who have read the book & folks who have not).

Nonetheless, the movie is watchable. Harrison Ford (as Allie) shines and the dramatic Mosquito Coast scenery & rugged jungle beauty is alluring and well shot. I particularly liked the shots of the tiny boat coasting upstream amidst thick jungle whilst being bathed in tropical sunshine. Fat Boy's manifestation is very impressive. The movie will leave you with a very strong afterthought about the manmade creations. To be honest, we are in very many ways (despite the luxuries) a forsaken captive of our own creation.

The movie's background score is lackluster. A good music score would have complemented the jungle backdrop.",1181692800,,2707,5.065022421524664
295087,5,6300271358,"I am disgusted at editorial reviews of this film that claim Allie Fox to be eccentric, mad and obsessive- do not be fooled by the rambling of these idiots.

This film is not about a madman, it is about an idealist.  If you believe America to be the Land of Oppurtunity- not the Land of Result, if you believe in hard work; if you believe in technocracy; if you believe that a mans destiny is determined by what he makes it, that that destiny is not to be left alone to God, but that God made Man intelligent and strong so that he could survive and better his world; if you believe that a mans efforts, thoughts and struggles are the things which compose his body, blood and soul- that these efforts are worth dying for, that they are a mans life and that those who would take them from him are taking no less than his life and are no less than murderers and thieves; if you believe these things to be true then this movie is for you.  On the other hand, if you're a mosquito and any of these things make you feel uncomfortable then this movie was not meant for you- however such evil creatures as yourself may find the film enjoyable as you may choose to morbidly relish in the struggle and pains of the protagonist.

The film is deep and intelligent and riddled with powerful lines and scenes; the details of which I wouldn't dare reveal to you.  I will say that The Mosquito Coast is a tragedy that brings some comfort in knowing that one is not the only one who thinks as one does- that the world of Good Men is not entirely lonely.

295088,5,6300271358,"This movie not only has one of the best actors ever taking the lead role - it has a great storyline. Harrison Ford's character is a little on the weird side, but is also very easy for the viewer to relate to in one way or the other.

How many people living in America have thought about the possiblity of leaving the country? How many people would love to experience what a more simplistic way of life could be without feeling bogged down by all of our modern technologies and so-called advancements? Yet very few ever take the risk...

Although Allie is disenchanted with what America has become over the years, he is also psychologically fitted with a traditional protestant work ethic; the same mindset upon which America was built - this irony is seen by the decisions he makes throughout the film, and this drives him to insanity.

The characters surrounding Allie create the conflict within the film, most notably his son Charlie (played by River Pheonix), who narrates during the film and tells the events from his point of view. Charlie respected his father but also was able to recognize the progressive decay of his father's mental health. As the oldest (there is a younger son and daughter), Charlie takes a role of leadership within the family and sometimes has to stand up to his own rolemodel.

Allie's wife (whom he refers to as 'Mother'), is played by Helen Mirren. Her struggle in the film is seen by her submissiveness to Allie and her dedication to him often blinding her to the sickness of her husband, and thus preventing her from not allowing her family to make correct decisions.

There is a missionary whom Allie argues with which adds to the film's philosophical tension. At times you wish different descisions had been made, the direction of the storyline may frustrate you, but I believe this was the filmmakers intension - human nature can be unpredictable, untrustworthy, flawed.

Faith vs willpower, simplicity vs complexity, technology vs nature, self- fullfillment vs group responsibility...this film has it all. A MUST SEE!!!

Hopefully I have left the storyline somewhat ambiguous for those who have not seen this movie, and perhaps those who haven't seen it in a long time. I will finish this review with one of my favorite quotes from the film to further convince you of the brilliance of 'The Mosquito Coast':

""We eat when we're not hungry, drink when we're not thirsty. We buy what we don't need and throw away everything that's useful. Why sell a man what he wants? Sell him what he doesn't need. Pretend he's got eight legs and two stomachs and money to burn. It's wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong."" -Allie Fox (Harrison Ford)

RECOMMENDATION: If you are looking for some other great films from 80's with great acting and storytelling then 'Gorillas in the Mist' should be next on your list.

Peter Weir is one of our most lyrical directors... now, if he'd only add those 7 minutes back to ""Hanging Rock""!

If you've read the Thoreaux classic you might agree with me in believing that the story itself is exceptional, and the movie required nothing less than an outstanding actor to assume the role of Allie, the leader of the Fox family. For 120 minutes Fox leads his loyal family across unfamiliar seas to a new and overwhelmingly different life among tribal villagers. At one point Allie seems to be in control of their lives, and then control is wrestled away by mother nature, who 'only has curved lines' when Allie insists on right angles.

The ultimate irony is in Allie's criticism of America. He manages to bring all that he hates about America with him to the foreign land of Mosquitia.

As a fellow American who's left my home country to live in a third world country, I can relate to Fox's search for a different life. Very highly recommended.",1119398400,3,977,4.609195402298851
295135,3,6300271358,"When I first saw this movie in the 1980s I was blown away by Harrison Ford's powerful portrayal of a God-like character that would do anything to maintain his kingdom.

In those days it seemed to have everything -- a solid plot, exotic location shooting, a big significant portrayal by a big name actor and solid support by the well-known cast.

When I watched it on DVD in 2005, it didn't seem quite that great anymore. After seeing Helen Mirren in ""Calendar Girls"", her performance in this film seems decidedly mono-dimensional. The late River Phoenix died of a drug overdose. And While Ford seemed credible as the 1980s era estranged inventor, he now seems wayward in 2005, a decade after guys spouting off just like his character blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City.

So none of the characters seems in 2005 quite what they were 20 years ago. Is it possible for time and real events to change the nature of my outlook on a film? Of course, but I don't think that's all that's changed.

Even though his movies continue to sell well as the box office and in post-theater sales, I don't think Harrison Ford has gone on to become a better actor since this film. When I compare his work here and in more recent fare like ""Patriot Games"", I don't see much growth. By comparison, Tommy Lee Jones' performance in ""Rolling Thunder"" and his work in ""The Hunted"" show great growth.

So did everyone simply overrate Ford's performance in this movie, and that overrating is now more apparent since his high profile divorce and establishment with the female star of a prime time televison show? Who knows.

I guess my point here is this -- this may have been the best acting of Ford's career when he was still a rising star in the 1980s. But viewing it 20 years later, it simply doesn't seem to be that great anymore.",1116806400,3,1817,4.558282208588957
295136,4,6300271358,"Harrison Ford is an ingenious inventor who struggles with the American capitalism. So he takes his ideas and his family to live in the jungle at the 'Mosquito Coast' where he thinks the natives will be enourmously grateful for his ice-making machine. The story is told by his oldest son who does not judge on his fathers decisions for a very long time.

But in the jungle things do not turn out as expected. The plots has some unexpected turns and I really liked the characters which are very un-hollywood like, e.g. no one really is a hero or the glamorous saviour. However, during the families stay in the jungle, the father more and more looses contact to reality and gets obsessed with living from scratch, forcing his children and wife to follow him. I can understand that his wife is loyal to him, but I can at no point believe that she, as a loving mother, does not protect her children from their father. In my opinion, this is where the story looses its authenticity. The end is somewhat shallow, but you will have to look at it to make up your mind.

It is a very interesting movie with excellent actors and I can really recommend it if you are not looking for Hollywood-Drama or an Happy-End.

As to the features of the DVD, if I remember correctly there are none.",1113350400,2,1275,4.463519313304721

Convinced the country is going to the dogs, he packs up the family and heads for a primitive area of Honduras. Combining the pioneer spirit with enterprise, he build a giant ice-making machine for the natives, along with a town to go with it. But Fox can't compromise his ideas or ideals and as things begin to go wrong, he slips into madness and drags his family down with him. Based closely on Paul Theroux's book, the movie has the same strengths and weaknesses: at first we are captivated by this eccentric but apparently right-thinking man, but as the scene shifts to the jungle, things become confused and incidents just seam to pile up one after the other. Like the book, what starts out as promising ends up disappointing.",1110931200,,823,4.722222222222222
295138,2,6300271358,"Having become disenchanted, as many viewers have, with Harrison Ford's recent choice in acting roles, I decided to check out some of his earlier, more adventurous efforts.  ""Witness"" and ""Frantic"" both impressed me as empassioned performances outside Ford's usual action/adventure sphere.  Unfortunately, ""cast against type"" doesn't always translate to ""good,"" and this film is a striking example.  Not that Ford doesn't try, but a patchy character arc, heavy-handed dialogue, and rather ludicrous symbolism more than counterbalance his sincere efforts.  Indeed, the symbol serving as the centerpiece is not only total fiction, but what happens around it will have you slapping your head in disbelief.  When paradise explodes, so to speak, watch a rocket literally shoot off into the sky.  It's a pretty clear indication of where the film is going, into a lumbering fourth act that won't quit.  While watching this film with a friend of mine (we both appreciate the books ""Lord Of The Flies,"" and ""Heart of Darkness,"" as well as films like ""Walkabout"" and ""Fitzcarraldo""), the DVD paused about five minutes from the end, not moving forward or back, leading him to comment, ""This disc must be cursed.""  We had to watch the remainder of the film on the pan-and-scan side.
All that said, ""The Mosquito Coast"" is not without some merits.  It is strikingly photographed, and River Phoenix does his best to carry the real emotional weight, while ladies Helen Mirren and Martha Plimpton (given one hilarious line near the beginning and barely seen again) are relegated to the background. In the end, Ford's star power does not make this social commentary resonate any more than if Richard Dreyfuss had played the role, and noble intentions are buried beneath plot elements that disappear (the children's money system) or never get past ridiculous (the preacher played by Andre Gregory, who won't make anyone forget ""My Dinner With Andre"").  Too bad.  I was hoping to discover an overlooked gem.  I'm sad to say this film might be little-seen for a reason.",1109721600,5,2048,5.117117117117117
295139,4,6300271358,"Peter Weir's (Gallipoli) film adapted from a novel by Paul Theroux's with a script written by Paul Schrader.  The film follows the rise and fall of a dissilusioned American inventor who, after being fed up with the frustrations of modern life at home, moves to live a more simple life in a tropical paradise where all goes wrong.  Well acted and directed, this is an interesting film analyzing the flaws in of western thought: particulary related to progress, innovation, and technology.

Harrison Ford plays Allie Fox, a disenfranchized American entrepreneur/inventor who believes that there's no more progress in America compared to the days when an Edison or a Bell could market their ideas without frustration.  He chooses to leave with his entire family for a modest life in the jungles of a South American country.  After moralizing an evangelical preacher for his hipocracy, Fox settles with primitive natives and tries to persuade them on the benefits of technology: in this case, an ice making/cooling machine he invented.  Despite his high hopes of progress, everything Fox plans goes terribly wrong  and he's forced to accept his shortcomings.

The film is well balanced and carries the theme quite well.  This film is a criticism of the can-make it better approach commonly associated with the American/Western view of the world.  The film juxtaposes a complex contraption against the background of a primitive society existing in equilibrium with nature.  Everything the indigens bring into their life comes from the jungle and returns to it.  Along come the agents of progress telling the simple folk how much better life would be if they had air conditioning and refrigeration in their steamy jungles: sounds like a good idea doens't it.  The film then shows the audience how such a foreign contraption upsets the nature's equilibrium and so the social peace.

The message in this film reflects various instances showing how the 'progress' of invention and industry brings more woes than advantages.  A perfect example of this in real life is when various powdered milk companies, with heavy-handed backing from their respective governments, promoted their products to Third World countries such as India as better than breast milk because its higher nutritional value.  The logic being that powdered milk would provide the usually malnourished children of these parts with better milk than breast milk.  The problem was that seemingly these 'caring' corporations never bothered to think of how these 'poor and helpless' children would drink the powdered milk they so proudly promoted.  The simple truth was that these corporate saviors were too busy thinking about their expected profit margins instead of their customers to bother reaching the logical and predictable results as to who would be buying their product: poor rural mothers of malnourished children who had no access to any source of potable water that would be required to dilute their miracle product.  After falling for their marketing blitz, mothers who bought the 'Super-new! Buy-now! Last-chance-to-fall-for-our-new-gimmick! Don't be without it!' powdered milk formula found their children dying of typhoid, colera, and other pathogens commonly found in tainted water where countries lack proper water and sanitation systems.

This film is a revealing social critique on the woes of 'progress' and 'growth' and seeks to show the limitations of such social/world views in their application to real life and other cultures in particular.  The acting is strong and gripping: definitely a film worth renting or owning.",1094083200,4,3599,5.301056338028169

Ford as Allie Fox is an inventor, a genius, a man too smart for the world around him. He is a mechanical engineer who takes his family to Central America in search of Utopia, as he defines it.  Of course, his family does not want to leave behind civilization and all of the comforts that home brings, but no one can resist his will.  Perhaps that and his abrasive irritating manner are aspects of his insanity.
He does not expect to find another zealot, particularly in the form of Reverend Spellgood (Andre Gregory) who has determined to bring Christianity to the natives.  Fox's goal is to bring his definition of civilization.  The conflict and comparison between two very strong characters is part of what makes Paul Theroux's story work
River Phoenix as Charlie, the son who comes of age, and through whose eyes we see this story, is brilliant.  Helen Mirrin, recently of 'Calendar Girls,' is stunning; her portrayal of a woman in love with her family, wanting to support her husband, yet protect her family is touching.  John Seale's, directory of photography, work is outstanding, and reminds me of other fascinating movies brought to life by the careful use of lights, shadows, and lush, verdant scenery.
Ford's portrayal of the disintegration of a brilliant man, inventor, know-it-all, family despot is compelling, but gets lost in the slow, tedious complexities of a long journey - both mentally and the one his family travels.  Yet, it has been almost twenty years since I saw the theatrical release, and I remember this film.  I still think about it, wonder about motives and actions - and that is what makes this an excellent film, in my opinion.
This is one of the most difficult films to rate because it was overly long and somewhat wearisome, but it is also powerful.  However, when actors, a story, and cinematography linger in my imagination and analysis processes since 1986, I must give it five stars.  I know that some people will be bored because it is slow, but I will watch it many times to enjoy the nuances.

295142,4,6300271358,"Don't sit down and watch The Mosquito Coast expecting another Six Days and Seven Nights.  Harrison Ford plays serious as a misguided, stubborn father who drags his family through hell.  Unlike many of Harrison's other characters, you will not necessarily identify positively with Allie Fox.  Instead of the likable brashness of Han Solo, Ford presents us with an despicable genius, an Einstein who does not consider the effects of his choices on others.
If the viewer doesn't expect Ford's feel-good characters from past performances, the movie will not be quite as disorienting as when I watched it.  Being accustomed to cheering for Ford's characters in previous movies, it was confusing and frustrating to see him so thick-headed.  While you may know people like Allie Fox, as I do, let's hope he's not you.
The story of a father taking his family into the wild has been explored many times, often with a mid-life crisis element involved.  Here, an incredibly intelligent inventor who lacks common sense shoves his family into amazingly difficult situations.  He believes his thoughts are perfectly reasoned, that life will be perfect after carrying out his plan.  I feel logic dictates that perfection is impossible.  Certainly, some deep discussion can occur after the movie's credits.
With half of marriages ending in divorce nowadays, many will watch this film and say, ""Why doesn't she divorce this stooge?""  However, even mismanaged families want to stick together, especially when kids are involved; this realization makes the spouse's questionable actions a touch more believable.
The supporting cast is very solid, with every performance believable.  Not a single weak link really exists here, and the cinematography drops you right in the middle of the jungle.
I enjoyed the movie simply to see Harrison Ford truly acting.  The Mosquito Coast shows his range as an actor.  A good watch for true fans of Harrison Ford, plus a lot of food for thought.",1081555200,10,1962,5.132075471698113
295143,4,6300271358,"Never read the book but saw this film when I was 16, and once again in my early 30's. At 16 I found Ford's portrayal and the storyline to be downright depressing and deplorable. Why? Well, for years as a kid I saw Ford play all the heroic roles that made him a super star. Then I realized Ford was entering his ""let me play more mature multi-faceted in-depth characters"" phase. So, from watching him play swashbuckler in the jungle to bushwhacker in the jungle I was disappointed but yet intrigued by the role of the eccentric (understatement)Allie Fox.
Now, in my 30's and seeng it on dvd for the first time, I am older and able to understand this film with great admiration for Ford's portrayal in a very challenging role along with some of the finest work by the late River Phoenix !
The story is based (from what other fans or readers of the novel have said)loosely on the novel of an American inventor who is greatly at odds with and disillusioned by American society, government, etc., in every which way he can think of. He soon packs up his family and moves to Central America to a place called Mosquitia to build a new life. The motivation or drive is to build an incredible ice machine (for central home cooling and other multi purposes) the likes of which the primitive natives have never seen. Soon, all goes awry with a combination of Allie's sinking into madness and unwanted trespassers who wreak havoc. Allie's determination to stay in his new found world soon begins to take its toll on his family !
What is remarkable is the central character's descent from a quirky and highly eccentric grumpy inventor to a man falling into madness and taking his family with him. As the saying goes, there is a method to his madness or madness to his method. The end result is one of tragedy and great loss. Ford's portrayal of Fox is the first time we the viewers see him as a good/bad/nasty/grumpy/ugly guy...It is one of Ford's better riveting performances due to his multi-personality role and the character's painful decline in sanity...
This is one of Ford's underrated roles and films to date. Do not miss this opportunity to see the Mosquito Coast based on a few disgruntled critics or viewers/readers who remain faithful to the novel...",1075766400,6,2249,4.625
295184,5,6300271358,"I'm a huge fan of both the novel and the film. Yes, the novel goes into more depth and the lead character, played by Harrison Ford on his best performance, is even more of a lunatic in it. This is a gorgeous film that has no easy answers and no cookie cutter characters. I think most of us agree with most of Allie Fox's sentiments about American society, but he takes himslef and his family to the furthest extremes of his obsessions. The minimal score provides a wonderful atmosphere and the entire cast is excellent, especially the late River Phoenix.
If you are looking for an easy film with little challenges for the viewer, watch Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. If you want to see him in an edgy, risky and brave role, try The Mosquito Coast.",1073692800,3,748,4.467153284671533

So, if you enjoy generic modern movies - fast-paced, dialog you don't have to pay attention to, sexy folks, thrilling drama, smart-alec humor, etc. - then I would avoid this one.
HOWEVER, if you would like to see a movie that tests and proves false an old fallacy of ours - that of the noble savage - then it is well worth seeing.  Ford plays a brilliant but misunderstood & underappreciated inventor that keeps thinking that modern civilization is the source of many evils.  Therefore, he moves his family to the jungle in South America to live the simplified life with ""innocent"" tribal folks.  In doing so, he tests the often-held ideal that indigenous tribes or remote civilizations hold pure values that we have lost.  The way that the movie works out this theme is incredibly believable and thought-provoking.  Ford's journey as his last hope is shattered is also worth seeing.",1072137600,15,994,4.716763005780347
295186,4,6300271358,"The stars I gave are for Harrison Ford's acting alone. He did a wonderful job in this role. I don't remember him winning an Oscar for this or anything ( if he did I don't remember ), but he deserved one. River Phoenix was surprisingly wasted. Usually River does wonderful in anything he's in but in this you didn't need him.  If you like films like "" The Beach "", and "" Lord of the Flies "", where men turn insane in beautiful tropical areas you will love this film.
Allie Fox ( Ford ) is an inventer sick of how America is being poisoned by little or no values. He walks around town raising hell and spewing nonsense with laid back son Charlie Fox ( River Phoenix ) by his side.  Allie fusses, spits and carries on with how he hates America than packs up his family and rushes to Belize where he believes the world is just beginning. His wife, Mother ( Helen Mirren ) ( She's only known as "" Mother "" )and their other three children are shocked to see Allie's drug them to an empty, backwards part of Belize far away from civilization. He spits, spews and shouts until he's made a village with the islanders from his bare hands. He makes an enemy out of the nosey reverand who believes he is going against the church by taking the land from the islanders.  Anyway, while the Foxes are enjoying nature after Allie invents a machine for ice and air conditioning, spanish men with guns show up and refuse to leave. In order to get rid of them Allie makes his son Charlie start a fire where the men sleep. That's when Allie's life goes down hill and he becomes even crazier.  The men get killed. Allie accidentally destroys not only his invention, but the entire little village. By this time Allie is as demented as a serial killer. The family packs up and finds a beach. Suddenly he keeps his family prisoner. He becomes so crazy he feels they're going to turn on him. Allie begans destroying everything he doesn't agree with while risking his family's life along the way.  And the only  thing Helen Mirren's character says is: "" Why are you doing this to us? "" At that point the pity I felt for Mother was killed by her stupidity. The younger brother, Jerry was a great actor. River Phoenix was dry which was very disappointing.
I haven't read the book yet but the plot didn't add up.  Helen Mirren's part could have been written smarter. How could Allie Fox rant and rave and she not see that he is insane? Please! I could tell he was a nut before he took his family away from America. The fact that he refers to his own wife as Mother should have tipped the family off. In that aspect the film could have been better. How does a man completely fall apart and his family not realize it until he's almost dead? That killed the plot's chance of being decent. Without Harrison Ford's dynamic performance this movie wouldn't be as popular as it is now. It came out in 1986 when everyone thought the world revolved around River Phoenix and his "" Stand by Me "" pals.
The film is entertaining thanks to Harrison Ford ( only ). Once again we suffer with horrible Martha Plimpton just because she and River were an item in real life. She was the most not needed character of all. Luckily she wasn't seen but twice. You can skip her scenes easily and save yourself the misery.

295188,4,6300271358,"The Mosquito Coast is a thoroughly enjoyable film by Peter Weir that, while not perfect, manages to be entertaining through its complex characters in the midst of extraordinary situations.
When inventor Allie Fox (Harrison Ford) decides to call America quits, he takes his family down to live off the land in Central America. While surviving in the harsh jungles, Fox's fervent belief in his ideals, reflected in the eyes of a religious fanatic running a nearby missionary, slowly tear his family apart. The story is like a modern Swiss Family Robinson, except the family is stranded by choice, not chance.
It's this adventure quality that helps the film be so enjoyable, but it's also the complexity of Fox, a man you can't help but admire while despising, that keeps you riveted to the screen. Performances here by Ford as well as supporting actors including River Phoenix as his son are right on the money. The film serves as a commentary on how far is too far to follow your beliefs blindly, and the message comes out strong.
If there's any major problem with The Mosquito Coast, it's that it's too short. It feels like we're missing some of the story at times, and that could be due to its adaptation from a longer novel. An additional 20 minutes could easily fill the gaps in the story and help create a better sense of the amount of time the fox's lived in the wild. But on the other hand, the ending seems to go on too long after what seems like the climax, and the film would have benefited from condensed events at that point.
Despite these problems, The Mosquito Coast definitely doesn't fail as either entertaining or enlightening, and is well worth multiple viewings. Highly recommended for anyone who loves realistic outdoor survival films.",1042934400,5,1754,4.7730263157894735
295189,5,6300271358,"Peter Weir's under-appreciated masterpiece draws a striking comparison between religious zealotry and the utopian fantasies of technological imperialism.  The smarmy Reverend Spellgood heads south into Central America to spread the Christian faith.  Paranoid inventor Allie Fox does likewise, but his mission is somewhat different though no less religious in its intensity - he wants to bring ice, and by his logic 'civilization', to the locals.  Both men are 'missionaries', both equally blind to the personal and social costs of the 'salvation' they bring.  The cast is excellent.  Helen Mirren is near flawless as the devoted but cautious mother, and River Phoenix really impresses as the coming-of-age son through whose eyes the story unfolds.  But Ford is absolutely perfect as the father.  This was truly inspired casting, as it uses our latent feelings for the actor to put us in precisely the same position as his on-screen family: we want to love him - this quintessentially paternal hero - despite his destructive obsession.  But in the end we have to accept that he gets exactly what he deserves.  I'm surprised Ford doesn't seek out more roles like this one, rather than settling for repetitive action fare or trying to reinvent himself as Bogart.  Adapted with considerable skill by Paul Schrader from an exquisite novel by Paul Theroux, this film is a rare find: a powerful, gripping, moving story with something important to say.",1038960000,112,1444,5.185344827586207

295192,5,6300271358,"Someone once said that ignorance is bliss; and if you follow through the reasoning process that leads to that conclusion, you discover that it is, indeed, true.  Another way of saying it would be, that the less you know, the happier you are likely to be; kind of a ""what you don't know can't hurt you"" perspective, but true, nevertheless.  Conversely then, what can be said about knowledge?  About knowing too much?  Can genius, for example, be equated with a life of torment?  Can knowing-- and more precisely, understanding-- too much bring about anguish and unhappiness?  The answer to that , of course, cannot be absolute, for there are a number of variables that must first be factored in, one of the most prevalent being that thin line that separates the true genius from madness, and how close to which side of that line the individual in question resides.  It's a situation examined in depth by director Peter Weir, in his riveting, thought provoking drama, ""The Mosquito Coast,"" starring Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren and River Phoenix.
 Allie Fox (Ford) is a family man; he has a devoted wife, ""Mother (Mirren),"" and four children, the eldest of whom, Charlie (Phoenix), thinks his dad is a genius.  Which he is.  Allie Fox is an inventor who believes it's man's job to tinker with an unfinished world and make it work.  He is also a true individual, the epitome of the man who marches to his own drum-- and in his case, his drum is the ""only"" one he will march to.  He sees such potential in everything around him, but he also sees that very same potential being wasted at every turn by seemingly everyone, from the average guy just trying to make a living, to a Corporate America he sees as the impetus that has already begun to destroy the nation.  All around him he sees a country and a people that has lost that spirit that made America strong; he sees ruin and decay in everything:  In the lack of quality in any and all manufactured goods, and in the apathy of the acquiescent consumer.  And he's had enough.  Refusing to stand by and watch America die, he packs up and moves his family to a remote section of a jungle in Central America, near the coast of La Moskitia; and it is there that he discovers a land, that to him, is paradise-- and where he also encounters the demons that plague those who know too much, and feel too deeply.
 Working from an intelligent and penetrating screenplay by Paul Schrader (adapted from the novel by Paul Theroux), Weir delivers a thoroughly engrossing character study that parallels Werner Herzog's 1972 masterpiece, ""Aguirre, The Wrath of God,"" inasmuch as it examines the effects of self-perceived omnipotence in an individual driven to extreme measures by a singular quest for power and autonomy (albeit in different times and with different motives).  Allie Fox, like Don Lope de Aguirre, becomes a victim of his own obsession, consequently victimizing those around him, as well, by losing sight of his own ideals and getting swept away in the current of a distorted sense of purpose.  Allie leaves an environment he perceives as defective for one that is ultimately equally flawed-- that being the environs within his own mind.  All of which is hauntingly presented by Weir, aided by John Seale and Maurice Jarre, whose cinematography and score, respectively, helps to create the atmosphere that so effectively underscores the drama of the story.
 As Allie Fox, Harrison Ford gives a performance that is one of his best and most powerful ever, affecting a commanding presence that dominates virtually every scene-- so compelling that his presence is felt even when he is absent from the screen.  This isn't a character you are going to like, necessarily; and yet you are going to care about him, because there's something in him that reflects and addresses concerns that are universal, which makes Allie someone to whom many in the audience will be able to relate and identify.  He's the man who believes that he truly ""can"" be an island unto himself, and beyond his personal peccadilloes, that is the kind of strength that demands admiration; for at the same time, it enables forgiveness.  It's a solid portrayal of a man at cross purposes with himself, who realizes to some extent what he is doing, yet adamantly refuses to back down.  And this is the man Ford brings to life so vividly; he's convincing, and his Allie Fox is disconcertingly real.
 Helen Mirren also turns in a memorable performance as Allie's devoted wife, whom he calls ""Mother.""  Mirren says more without dialogue-- through a subtle expression, or even the merest glance-- than most actors do with a limitless number of words.  And it's her moments of silence that are some of the most telling of the film, while at the same time adding strength to the lines she does recite.  In the end, Mirren creates a character who chooses her words well, then uses them wisely-- and it's a portrayal that is, without question, one of the strengths of the film.  In the way Mother looks at Allie, Mirren conveys that love and absolute loyalty that makes everything they do believable.  There is complete trust there, which you can feel when, standing in her kitchen, for example, she gives a final glance at the dishes piled high in the sink; a glance at the life she's leaving behind to follow her husband.  And she's happy.  In it's simplicity and brevity, it's a powerful scene that says so much about who she is, and who ""they"" are.  And Mirren makes it work beautifully.
 Phoenix does a solid job, too, providing the narrative of the film as Charlie.  He is perfectly cast as Ford's son, and he succeeds in giving ""The Mosquito Coast"" that sense of reflection and perspective that makes it a truly memorable, and emotionally involving, film.",1021852800,5,5764,4.746238716148445

In order to feel it I think in an old traditional family when the father/husband/man was in charge of it. This family and specially his wife trusts him and admires him! This was key: to follow him in his gigantic adventure! There was not the typical individualism that makes couples split. I had a father who followed his dreams. Thanks to that I have a better understanding of the world and its needs! And let me tell you I have always been a very happy person who follows her dreams!

295244,5,6300271358,"Striking locations, solid acting, and fidelity to the original story make this an excellent film. In contrast to what has been written in certain other reviews, this is exactly the way in which a book should be brought to life on the silver screen.
To wit- much of the dialogue used in the film has been lifted directly from the book. The storyline follows the novel with nearly exact precision. Sure, some of the detail gets left out, but it's impossible to make a feature-length film from a full-length novel without losing some of the subleties. If they're that important to you, skip the movie and stick to the book.
Secondly, Harrison Ford's preformance as the self-destructive genius Allie Fox is beyond question. Author Paul Theroux was among Ford's biggest fans, once quoted as saying ""He IS Allie Fox."" Ford took the role after Jack Nicholson turned it down, and this is likely for the best - his performance, superlatives aside, is in fact Oscar-worthy. The rest of the cast offers standout performances - especially noteworthy are Helen Mirren and the late River Phoenix, as Mother and Charlie respectively.
Perhaps this film's biggest detriment is the story itself - the psychologically dark plot can be as off-putting as it is fascinating.
This film should be viewed for what it is - an excellent film version of the book and a fascinating, dark tale of self-destruction. Fans of Harrison Ford's lighter action films might not enjoy the movie because of the dark plot. This movie, however, was never intended to please all of the people all of the time; keeping that in mind, this is an excellent film.",1009584000,2,1615,4.833935018050542
295245,2,6300271358,"This movie was nowhere near as good as the book. I'm surprised that anyone who read the book would think the movie's better. The movie's so unfulfilling because so much of the progression between events is left out. Instead the movie jumps from image to image in many places, as if a 5 second scene here and a 10 second scene there are enough to show how the family adapted to the environment--and, more importantly, adapted the environment to them. Of course, this is an insight that one could not have without reading the book and seeing how much was left out. There is a right way and a wrong way to adapt a book to the silver screen. This was the wrong way. If you insist on watching it, try reading the book first.",1009238400,2,719,4.333333333333333
295246,5,6300271358,"It isn't often that a movie makes you understand the character motivation better than the original book.  MOSQUITO COAST is a movie that does.  Throughout the book I wanted to sit down and counsel the mother about the absurdity of her allowing the self-centered father to distroy all their lives.  Yes, I blamed the mother as much as the father for permiting the horrors that happen to this family.  Why would any woman subject herself and her children to this kind of tyranny?  Harrison Ford's wonderful portrayal of the egocentric father and Peter Weir's genius in directing (the cinematography ... as in all Peter Weir films, is on a scale with Hitchcock's)suddenly make the story click.  Yes, the father is still obnoxious, but you understand why when you see this movie, and you understand why the mother puts up with it, and why the story has to end in the way it does.  No halfway on this one ... a fulfilling story from beginning to end.",989539200,4,945,4.656626506024097
295247,1,6300271358,I really didn't enjoy this movie.  It definitely wasn't anything special and was rather annoying to watch. All you want to do throughout the whole movie is slap Harrison Ford for thinking he's some kind of god and for forcing his family to be where they don't want to.  Don't waste your time watching this.,988243200,7,306,4.545454545454546
295248,5,6300271358,"Wow, is this ever a great movie.  I love the intensity Ford brings to the main character, who is determined to create his own world by his own rules and ends up destroying everything-- most notably his son's belief in him.  I also love the fact that the film remains (mostly) true to the novel--a rarity.  Nor is there a formulaic happy ending.  You'll get sucked in to the vision of Utopia just as River Phoenix is.",988070400,,416,4.363636363636363
295249,5,6300271358,"This movie brings new dimensions of meaning to the word ""rationalization.""  Harrison Ford's three-quarters-crazy character, Ally Fox, is one of the more spookily magnetic nutball geniuses it has been my pleasure to view in action.  His goal of creating a utopia falls into the usual pitfalls in store for such schemes...  Actually, he really CAN make things more pleasant for everyone, because he seriously is tremendously gifted, in a mechanical way.  The problem is, he's nuts, so he needs to always be in the center, revealing truths to people, and having them enthralled by his charisma.  He can never, ever leave well enough alone.  It just ain't gonna happen, it's not in his nature...  One little scene no one seems to really notice is the Thanksgiving dinner the Fox family celebrates in the jungle.  Helen Mirren comes downstairs, resplendent in her holiday garb, and the whole family is happy for a few moments.  There is an awkward pause, and then they all dig in and start eating.  What is missing here?  Ummm...  Well, what holiday are they supposed to be celebrating?  That's right, Thanksgiving!  Do they say grace?  Do they give thanks?  No way!  For my money, that little moment was one of the most telling things in the whole movie.  Ally Fox is like a black hole for simple, thankful happiness.  He just sucks it in, and it's never seen again.  He's always focused on his next project, and life itself just passes him by, unless he can use it for one of his perfectionist schemes.  And even as things deteriorate for him, (near the end he is basically paralyzed), his brain just keeps on going, and coming up with reasons why he is heading in just the direction he wants to be headed in.  It's pretty spooky.  Talk about your basic tragic hero.  Lordie lordie.  Seventeen billion thumbs up.",975283200,4,1809,4.739549839228296
295250,5,6300271358,"This movie contains all the elements that make a great story, and best of all, includes a great cast and wonderful cinematography.  Harrison Ford plays a very dynamic character who fits the mold of the misguided husband  who downplays his pernicious acts with a ""I'm doing this for you"" speech.  Incredible!  Part of you loves him for his genius, part of you hates him  for his hazardous ambition.  I would classify this movie as a tragedy, but  what better way to learn from the ideal human experience of survival, hope  and trial.  The DVD looks sharp (for an older movie!) and has a nice  trailer on it, but that's really it.  I noticed the Amazon comment of ""Fine  film grain is revealed throughout,"" and I quote Allie Fox, ""Sounds  perfect!"" - I love the sharp film look!  This movie is a keeper, and an  excellent chapter in Harrison Ford's hall of fame!  Peter Weir too!  SEE  IT!",961372800,16,887,4.54140127388535
295251,4,6300271358,"Harrison Ford gives one of his most forceful and compelling performances as Allie Fox, an inventor who moves his family to the jungle of Central America to establish an isolationist utopia.  As his dream builds, and then  unravels, he moves along the scale from manic genius to meglomanic  obsession, putting him at heightened odds with  God, nature, man, and  finally, his own family. Ford's dazzling performance is enhanced by Helen  Mirren's quiet intensity as his loyal wife, and River Phoenix's thoughtful  portrayal of his observant oldest son.  Look quickly for cameos by Jason  Alexander (TV's ""Seinfeld"") and Butterfly McQueen (""Gone  With the Wind"")!  A beautifully photographed and handsomely mounted  production, perceptively directed by Peter Weir.
The DVD offers both  widescreen and pan & scan tranfers; I preferred the widescreen which  preserves the film's magnificent visual compositions.  Video and sound are  both clear and crisp, and the theatrical trailer makes a nice bonus  supplement.  Recommended for fans of Ford and Weir, and for viewers who  like a strong mix  of character study and action-adventure.",961286400,42,1130,5.421965317919075
295252,4,6300271358,"This is a movie forgotten somewhere in Ford's and director Weir's filmography. It's a shame, because it is compelling, well written.
