Kenshin verus Cho was the first battle on the tape and it was great. Cho's westrn accent in the dub suits him quite well, it goes with his clothes and that mondo do of his. Next on the battle list we got Nenji (Okina) verus Aoshi Shinomori. It was a pretty cool fight between the two, but Aoshi claimed victory through use of his double kodachi technique, the Kaiten Kenbu Rokuren. On the last episode of the tape we get to see more of Hiko training to Kenshin to learn the Final Attack of the Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu. It's a pretty serious episode that showed some light on Kenshin past has a kid. But it has it's funny moments has well when Hiko askes Kenshin to attack him with the Kuzu-ryu-sen.",1004486400,,831,4.2993630573248405
