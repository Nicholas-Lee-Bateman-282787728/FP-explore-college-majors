2550738,3,B000F3UA70,"I rented this movie, and I'm glad I didn't spend too much on the rental. It was cute, and entertaining enough, but as someone who buys plenty of DVDs, I wouldn't have purchased this one. It had its moments, though, and I enjoyed watching it once, even though plenty of parts of it don't really make sense.",1169942400,4,305,4.368421052631579
2550739,1,B000F3UA70,"Look, I'm used to movies like ""Better than chocolate"", ""Listen"", ""Gia"", Monster, series like ""The L word"", real good lesbian stuff. When I got this movie thinking it was a good lesbian drama, I was completly dissapointed. Boring, unrealistic, stupid... do not waste your time/money. The real lesbian of the movie ends up with a guy, and the main characters were so boring! oh god! I still regret I watched it. Hey, if you wanna see a lesbian movie that has never been properly discovered, buy ""Listen"", it's only a VHS version, but it's hot, great lesbian thriller... reminds me of Basic Instinct but better.",1166140800,18,608,4.8
2550740,1,B000F3UA70,"I appreciate the effort. I really do. Especially from a woman filmmaker on a tight budget. I applaud the movie for that reason only. 1 star for effort!

But, honestly, aren't there any decent scripts and actors out there? Isn't there anyone willing to invest money in lesbian films? We are STARVED for anything half way decent, and will shell out some bucks on Amazon to get it. But I refuse to part with hard earned cash for something on par with the very bad ""Bar Girls,"" which describes this movie to a T.

Unfortunately, this film gets one star from me because (a) it was completely unbelievable, (b) the pacing was terrible, (c) the acting was energetic, but not in the right places, and (d) I was bored.

A MUCH better low budget/made by women film is ""Kissing Jessica Stein."" Even ""Go Fish"" gets points for style (and 2 stars from me, although it DID have worse acting). Back to the drawing board! And don't ask for my money until you have something at ""It's in the Water""-level or better.",1164758400,6,996,4.49171270718232
2550741,2,B000F3UA70,"With altogether too brief funny moments to break it up, the overall feel of this movie was amaturish and wooden.  Based on a hard to believe premise - would you, as an ex who was jilted 10 short months ago, agree to be the Maid of Honor for the lover who left you? - nope, me either.  I kept feeling like I was watching a bad high school theater production - shot in the Winchester mystery house.  Continuity issues, a weak and disjointed story line heavy on the stereotypes, and a badly stiched together plot drove this movie into the dirt for me.

Watching paint dry would have been so much more entertaining.

I want my 98 minutes back.",1156723200,10,639,4.336134453781512
2550742,2,B000F3UA70,It was okay. The acting wasn't all that great and neither was the story line. I did like how April's mother came around so fast and was more concerned about her daughter being happy rather than who she was with.,1153267200,,211,4.3
2550743,4,B000F3UA70,"If you are looking for sex, this is not the movie for you. There isn't any.  However, if you like a lot of story lines going on at once, along with romantic comedy then this is a good flick.  I think it to be very realistic with good lines and a cast that has very good chemistry.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1149292800,22,306,3.9836065573770494
2550744,4,B000F3UA70,Over all this movie was very funny.  Yeah it was alittle over but it is a comedy so you don't really expect real life situtions.  The way the characters are weaved together and the story is told is not your everyday coming out to your parents.  It is a story of true love over coming impossible odds in a funny non in your face I am gay so deal with it way.  It has very nice cross over appeal.,1146441600,4,394,3.949367088607595
2550745,2,B000F3UA70,It starts out kinda interesting but later it turns out to be like the third season of the l word..  it has its funny moments but some of the scenes go way too over the top..  the only thing worth watching would be the chick who plays Alex (the maid of honor) =),1145491200,4,261,3.9056603773584904

2550752,4,B000F3UA70,It was fun to watch. A feel good comedy because hopefully your life isn't like the one in the movie. The movies would be a good date movie to curl up on the couch and watch with a friend and have some laughs.,1382659200,,208,3.86046511627907
2550753,5,B000F3UA70,"April (Maria Cina), who is about to be married to Pauly (Randall Batinkoff) has asked long time friend and ex-girlfriend Alex (Trish Doolan) to host her wedding shower. As the eccentric guests begin to arrive, they bring their own set of dramas to an already charged atmosphere. Gay best friend Jake (Joe Tabbanella) is on the lookout for his next boyfriend, Kelly (Lara Harris) has man trouble and Pauly's sister Spring Dawn (Delaina Mitchell) has just changed her name because of a new career in adult entertainment. Then Sasha (Honey Labrador) and Sophie (Arly Jover) arrive while in the middle of a fight about their relationship.

As the alcohol flows freely, everyone begins sharing more than they should and Alex let's slip that she and April were in a relationship for five years. Seeing Alex again has brought back long repressed feelings in April leading her to re-think her marriage to Pauly. As if the day couldn't get any stranger, the `live' entertainment arrives, in the form of a super sexy Spanish dancer Roxy - then the fun begins.

Trish Doolan wrote, produced, directed and starred in this fantastically zany comedy/drama. What seems like a normal event, under her direction is thrown into bizarre laugh aloud scenarios. Although created on a small budget, the film doesn't show it in the least and the soundtrack of favourites from the past will keep your toes tapping.

Maria Cina is fantastic as bride-to-be April caught between family expectations and following her heart. Delaina Mitchell is hilarious as Pauly's sister Spring Dawn, the rising porn star.

2550754,5,B000F3UA70,It was good to find this.  I enjoyed it when it first came out.  It came up again in the 'others also purchased',1363824000,,112,3.8260869565217392
2550755,3,B000F3UA70,"The movie's premise while cliche is a stable in LGBT cinema. It's a funny movie to watch and has some hilarious lines, unfourtunately the writer/producer/star/director Trish Doolan put too much into the movie. There are too many characters with their own side storylines that are resolved too quickly as well as the main plot being summed up in a matter of hours (tv time). The story is set during a bridal shower and after a bit of controversy everything gets wrapped in a neat little package. If the time span had been longer though this would have made for a much more plausible movie. But if you're not looking for plausibility or deep thinking than this movie is fun to enjoy and get a few good laughs.",1341360000,,707,4.574803149606299
2550756,3,B000F3UA70,"This movie is so bad that it's good - it's just so atrociously acted, cheesy lines, unlikely hookups, bad characters (I mean - seriously, groom gets dumped and is ready to run home to wait for a Spanish hottie?) and everyone gets drunk, laid and hooked-up. It's pretty dang funny in a lot of ways but maybe not for what you see at face value. It's a good ""bad"" movie.",1316563200,,367,4.257142857142857
2550757,4,B000F3UA70,"""April's Shower"" is a funny, moving, entirely believable film about the choice between what the heart desires and what society will accept. I would recommend this film highly to anyone with an open mind who likes good comedy (a rarity in Hollywood these days).

Basic synopsis: Alex has been asked to be the maid of honour at her friend April's wedding, and is in the process of throwing April her wedding shower. There's just one complication: Alex and April used to be lovers, but April left because she was afraid of coming out dating another woman. When Alex let's their relationship slip during the shower (in front of April's controlling Mother) things get surreal.

""April's Shower"" is filled with funny, lively characters. It benefits from a well-written script, a capable cast, and a breezy and engaging pace. The Heathen Hippy gives it four fresh bouquets.",1293580800,,866,4.9655172413793105
2550758,1,B000F3UA70,"The reviews here reveal that some people found pleasure in this film.  Unfortunately, I do not find myself among them. I could not wait for it to end. I watched the whole thing only because I had paid to rent it, but it was mostly a painful experience.

No one is really connected to anyone in this film. Almost all the characters seem narcissistic and flippant. There are so many characters introduced who are carrying zany, personal issues, and we are supposed to care about these. But the reader has no motivation to care, due to the disorganized storyline.

The attempt to create a warm reunion of people who care about each other falls short. None of the characters have much heart, and there are even several face-slapping scenes! The only appealing character was the young nerdy woman, who appears briefly. Please, let us have more well-written films with appealing characters.",1268352000,,884,4.841059602649007
2550759,5,B000F3UA70,"I love cheesy movies, and this one is right up there.  The randomness is what makes me laugh the most.",1222646400,,102,4.1
2550760,5,B000F3UA70,"Honestly, I am surprised this film has been rated so poorly.  I thought this was one of the best lesbian movies I have seen since Better than Chocolate.  My partner and I have watched any and every gay and lesbian film out there, and believe me this is definitely not a bad one at all.  In fact it had very good production values.

Many have complained about the plot being unrealistic, but it's a comedy what do you honestly expect with a comedy?  There were so many funny and clever lines that I looked forward to rewatching the movie again and again. And have tried to commit many one those great one-line zingers to memory.  In this manner I can see this sort of film more appealng to those who like camp and who can appreciate this sort of advanced humor.

I felt that it was extremely well-written and that the movie was very subtle with certain details.  The audience really had to pay attention to the lines to understand the backstory.  Perhaps this is a reason that so many have reviewed this so poorly.  I contend that it is more of a thinking person's movie rather than a movie just there to entertain you, as so many films do so nowadays.

I really thought that so many of the lines were brilliant.  For example, one device that I especially liked was the mirror-like reflectiveness of the front door of the house and that most of the guests who entered had a comment about it which was very revealing about their character. But again these details are subtle, if you don't pay attention to details you will miss so many of the wonderful moments in this movie.

We lesbians are so used to having stories in which the lesbians are crazed homicidal maniacs who must die a tortuous death if they are not willing to repent and go with a man, however, I was not bothered by the fact that many of the so-called lesbians were trying the idea of sleeping with men on.  In fact I feel that many people may have missed the point of this movie - that who we sleep with isn't about one's genitals at all, rather it's who we actually do fall for or what we have in common with others of a like-minded spirit.  I thought that it was brilliant that the one lesbian you would least expect to fall for a man actually tried what her partner was advocating all along...not limiting herself to one person or one type of love...  I found it to be quite profound and brilliant and no, I myself am quite happy with monogamy... so that's not the reason why it appealed to me.

I feel that if you are open minded enough not to pigeonhole your characters into being a certain way or type, if you have a clever sense of humor and are willing to think about what you are watching, that this movie is wonderful.  Despite the contrived circumstances of any comedy, I found it to be quite honest about real life situations.  I highly recommend it.  And yes, I have added it to my own personal collection of must-see lesbian cinema.",1221955200,,2913,4.379182156133829
2550761,1,B000F3UA70,I just don't know what to say other than save your money. This movie was just pure nonsense. I wish I could've given it zero stars.,1219795200,,131,4.076923076923077

2550764,1,B000F3UA70,"I am doing research on lesbian films. And so far I have been completely let down with only a few exceptions, the best exception so far is Saving Face, I will explain.

It has been my experience watching ""lesbian"" films that in some way, shape, or form a man is involved before woman proclaims her lesbianism or after, as in April Showers. I do not know ANY lesbian who would sleep with a man. Even in the highly proclaimed lesbian film Go Fish a ""lesbian"" sleeps with a man. Its a disgrace and an insult to imagine that any lesbian would sleep with a man.

I have nothing against men, I have several male friends. But this seems like a male propaganda in order to change the face of lesbianism into ""just waiting for the man arrive.""

What's worse, is that a woman film maker would even consider making a lesbian film where the lesbian sleeps with a man.

These films are shameful and should never be in teh same category as lesbian films. They should be with the bisexual films.",1181088000,5,979,4.392265193370166
