2619863,5,B000GUJYQ0,"Even when the first of the Predator films were released starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, I was hooked.  As a science fiction/horror fan, this and all the other Predator series filled my every expectation.  The entire production; especially, the ""Predator"" was mesmerizing.  This series is only one of a continuing series of film that truly got better with each production. In Predator 2, the original psuedo-Rastafari predator, continued to share some additional memorable action scenes with  Danny Glover.  I love these film and watch them bi-weekly.  In all likelihood, I'll probably wind up buying a replacement set.  In a word, this package is GREAT!  Buy it!",1182902400,,662,5.298076923076923

2619868,5,B000GUJYQ0,"Predator stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch, a mercenary hired by the Federal Government to track down whatever is killing some of it's people. The Predator it'self is an other world being that comes to earth every so many years to hunt humans. The trophy the Predator takes is human skulls. The predator uses stealth camouflage technology to blend in with it's surroundings much like a chameleon to blend in, unseen, with it's surroundings.

When all of Dutch's hunting party are killed, Dutch and the Predator hunt each other. Dutch uses his own camouflage to become invisible to the Predator.

In Predator 2, Los Angeles is enduring a heat wave and a crime wave, so the pressure on police officer Michael Harrigan (Danny Glover) to solve a strange string of murders is mounting. Harrigan thinks the culprit can be found among the warring gangs and drug cartels, but FBI Special Agent Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) knows the horrible truth: Their killer is a fearsome extraterrestrial (Kevin Peter Hall) with keen hunting abilities that include superior night vision and the power to make itself invisible.

This is a great movie with a surprising ending. If you liked Predator, you will like Predator 2",1443830400,,1202,4.970149253731344

2619879,5,B000GUJYQ0,"The beginning of a Franchise!  Arnold and Danny were two of the biggest stars in Hollywood when these movies were made.  In fact, they always seemed to have placed the ADVENTURE aspects of the movie experiences before the ACTION!  This is what I mean... Arnold S. and D. Glover knew that there were dozens of movies being produced in Hollywood.  They focused on providing the vicarious participants an experience through their intense story lines and moral code.  This is reflected throughout each movie when the Predator displays his code when he refuses to attack an unarmed woman and one who is pregnant.  Women and the helpless are always protected by a hero.  Their movies are about the characters and not cruelty.

2619893,5,B000GUJYQ0,"Well, I've been collecting Blu-rays for a short time now, and finally got the new Full HD TV set-up, and then starting re-watching some older titles on DVD.... now, I told myself that I wouldn't be making the effort to be re-buying many old titles that I already own, but after seeing a lot of the ""classics"" again, and in comparison to the new HD format, all I have to say is... yikes! A lot of them suffer badly from transfers that came from a much dirtier and damaged film source. The first ""Predator""(one of my all-time faves) on DVD is one of those that is WAY to sub-par in video quality for my tastes. SO MANY black specks and scratches pop-up, that it's flat-out distracting to watch now by today's standards.

So, I had to make the effort of up-grading this bad-boy on good ol' Blu-Ray... and whatta'ya know, Best Buy has both the 1st and 2nd Predators movies on sale this week (for only $7.99) in a nifty little Double Feature 2-Pack. I did a lot of research to find out what exactly this Collection consists of, and there is a lot of back-and-forth on what was actually included. There were many reviews stating that the set included the much more superior release of the 1st Predator, the 2010 ""Ultimate Hunter Edition"" which includes butt-loads of special features and a far better, fully remastered HD transfer, as opposed to the far inferior 2008 Blu-Ray release of the film that really didn't do the masterpiece justice(from what I've heard).  But, then there were many other conflicting reviews stating that this set actually contains the cruddy 2008 release... ahhhh, who to believe?! Well, I figured it would be worth it to throw caution to the wind and just buy it at this awesome price, and hope I get the ""UHE"" version of the 1st film...  and, I DID! SWEET!

So, I am here(after putting you all through this painful rant) to confirm that the version that Best Buy is currently selling is the proper 2-Disc Pack, with the much more superior UHE version of ""Predator""... and, of course, a great copy of its equally entertaining sequel as well!

While some still confirm that there are copies floating around out there that do still contain the 2008 version, I can say with certainty that the one I bought this week at BB does include the correct version.",1395792000,8,2274,4.5911330049261085
2619894,4,B000GUJYQ0,"Lots of action, interesting concepts, lots of blood and gore, liked the design of the monster aliens.  the fact that these were good films is shown by the fact that further sequels were made.",1395446400,,191,4.617647058823529

2619898,5,B000GUJYQ0,I had probably the oldest version of Predator on Bluray. It was released prior to the ultimate hunter edition and I didn't own Predator 2. I had heard that the UHD version has the special features as my old copy of predator did not have any special features and only just the film. Also it sounds like the UHD is the better picture as it might have been remastered from what other reviewers have stated. After watching the UHD version I can tell the picture is a tad better but not a huge difference. To confirm though this double features that includes the UHD does have the special features included. So now i have both movies for relatively cheap now. Predator is one of my all time favorite sci fi movies and probably my favorite Arnold movie. Definitely worth the buy for the combo.,1392249600,3,787,4.472222222222222

Apparently, I'm not the only one having issues with disc one, judging by the other one star reviews. What is going on here? Could it be that Predator is actually the older 2008 release disguised as the UHE? If you wanna get rid of a lot of unsold and unwanted inventory, just bury it like they did the e.t.

2619918,4,B000GUJYQ0,"Here's m thoughts on ""Predator"": it's ""The Most Dangerous Game""... but with a masked alien instead of a creepy guy with a satanic goatee.

That's the basic concept behind this gory, suspenseful sci-fi thriller. which starts off as your usual macho BOOMBOOMfest but quickly mutates into something far creepier. Sadly ""Predator 2"" doesn't measure up to its brilliant predecessor -- while not horrendous, it loses a lot of that primal grittiness in favor of a very dated urban scenario.

""Predator"": Major Alan ""Dutch"" Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team have been assigned to rescue a cabinet minister kidnapped by guerillas in Guatemala. The team basically blows up the entire guerilla compound and everyone in it, except for one woman (Elpidia Carrillo) that they take prisoner. But on the way back, their numbers start dwindling -- one soldier is dragged away and gutted, and another is shot through the chest with an energy blast. Something far worse than the guerillas is stalking the team through the jungle -- an unknown Predator is determined to kill everyone worth hunting.

""Predator 2"": The Colombian and Jamaican drug gangs are currently in a massive war for Los Angeles, which is interrupted by a mysterious invisible creature that starts killing both sides. Lieutenant Michael Harrigan (Danny Glover) finds out that an extraterrestrial Predator is loose in his city -- and in turn, the Predator is being hunted by a covert government agency.

""Predator"" and ""Predator 2"" are pretty much what you would expect from a classic action movie and its sequel -- the first one is pretty brilliant, and the second one is competent but suffers by comparison to the first. In fact, the only thing the two movies have in common is a tentacle-haired, antifreeze-blooded alien who likes to skin things.

The original ""Predator"" is a grimy, gritty piece of work, with a small number of soldiers moving through a sweaty tropical forest. It has a very primal, timeless feeling -- you could set this story in any wilderness, in any time period, and it would feel roughly the same. And having the characters be so isolated in the jungle just hammers that home.

""Predator 2"" loses that primal, timeless feeling, mostly by planting itself in an urban setting swarming with people... and oh yeah, dating itself with the government-agency-seeking-aliens subplot. It's not a bad movie, but it doesn't grip you the way the first film does -- although it does have some clever moments, such as the Predator scanning a child with a toy weapon.

One thing both movies do have is excellent casting. Schwarzenegger does what he does best, roaring and blasting his way through the jungle, uttering some lovely lines that have reached cinematic immortality (""Get to da choppah!""). Glover gives a good performance as well as a hard-bitten, weary cop who has enough on his plate before the aliens show up.

""Predator / Predator 2"" is a duology worth watching -- the first movie is a deserving action/sci-fi classic, the second more flawed but still watchable. Just don't watch the Predators' battles with the xenomorphs.",1364515200,2,3109,5.023300970873787

There are people who're constantly nagging about the PQ/SQ of movies intended for home theatre viewing experience. It gets to the point where I start wanting to say hateful things to them. Taking the first Terminator movie for example, during the time of laserdics, people complained about the movie being monotrack and didn't have any surround sound effects. Now as it is remastered with surrounds in blu-ray disc, people wanted the monotrack to be added along with the remastered track.
Those people gathered in online forums and  posting insolent and hateful comments about these movie releases. My thought on this is that if they really understand the difference and want to pursue the quality they will be addressing the publishing company whether individually or collectively, instead of ranting about at public online communities. They did it just to feel good about themselves, that they are people of class and are not going to give in quality of life, without realizing what they really want and just following other people blindly.

In the case of this Predator/ Predator bundle, I have seen some extremely negative reviews on blu-ray.com, criticizing the digital noise reduction procedure conducted in making the ""Ultimate Hunter Edition"" of the Predator. The movie turned out very fine in picture quality on my TV screen. The effects alleged to have produced all those hateful comments on bluray.com are only present in the first 5 minutes. Despite the fact that they way EXAGGERATED the badness of the image quality, the scenes look a little waxy for a few reasons: it's the compound effect of a strong single light source (incandescent lamps from above the picture) in a night scene on characters' makeups which included the applying of oil and water to make them look tough. Here on Amazon, most people with common sense (including me) are not bothered by the results of the Digital Noise Reduction and enjoy the movie a lot. The subsequent scenes in the jungle that last the whole movie look better than ever. The great thing about making the picture look less dated in this particular case is that, the vivid look of jungle makes the adventure more engaging. Due the nature of the movie, Predator is not like the Terminator and Terminator 2 where a surreal tint of the environment in the setting might as well get you going, communicating with the scenes in the movie.

I haven't checked out the features of Predator yet. But the menu is well designed and easy for navigation. Unlike many others, I didn't enjoy Predator 2 as much as the first movie. I felt the story was rushed all the way (no shift of speed) and the director failed to capture the emotion of the film (lack of close-ups). Also there is no pop-up menu for Predator that you may call up in the middle of watching. But all in all, this bundle pack deserves a 5 star for its value. And it will be a great addition to your sci-fi movie collection.",1361491200,5,3376,5.328330206378987

Several purchasers of the double feature have confirmed this on various forums. NOTE: This review does not apply to the Predator Collection released in October 2010.

I received an email from Amazon customer service that states this double feature now contains the 2008 release, which has no extras or special features and uses an older, inferior MPEG-2 AVC video codec. I sent an email to Foxconnect asking them to verify the version of Predator that is currently included in this double feature release. I will post their response here if I receive definitive information. (EDIT) 2/14/2013. I have exchanged emails with Foxconnect, the contact for Fox Home Entertainment. I detailed the differences between the 2008 and 2010 releases of Predator for them and asked which release this double feature contains. They refused to tell me anything, other than it was a Blu-ray of the 1987 movie Predator.(EDIT) 3/11/2013. Please read the comments for additional information. Everyone who has commented has received the 2010 Ultimate Hunter Edition with this double feature.

At this point, my conclusion is that they may have been using this Own the Moments release as a vehicle to get rid of some unsold inventory of the 2008 Blu-ray release. Since everyone who has commented on this review has confirmed that they have received the Ultimate Hunter Edition, the email from Amazon customer service was probably incorrect. The most recent response from customer service regarding this issue is that they relied on information from their inventory dept.

There are strong opinions on which of these two releases is superior. Before purchasing this item, be sure to check the reviews of the individual releases for the 2008 and the 2010 before you take a chance on purchasing this double feature.

Frankly, you are better off buying the individual releases, to guarantee that you are getting the version you prefer.

When they wait 14 years to release a spin-off and 20 years to release a sequel, those turds aren't even part of the original franchise in my eyes.  They should have just left Predator alone after Danny Glover went at it in 1990, and thanks to this 2-movie box set, I can stylishly pretend that they did.  As long as this sits on my shelf, those three abominations that came out in recent years don't even exist.  I love it.",1298332800,8,583,4.216216216216216
2619926,3,B000GUJYQ0,"This appears to be the first Blu-ray of Predator and not the Predator Ultimate Hunter Edition that so many people have a problem with. You decide which one you want. Seems to be that you can buy this set cheaper individually. I don't think it's obsolete, as it will be a while before a 3 disc Blu set comes out with PREDATORS included. Your choice. I'd rather have the 4 individual Blu-ray's (PREDATOR, PREDATOR ULTIMATE HUNTER EDITION, PREDATOR 2, and PREDATORS) and both AVP's to complete my collection. It won't kill your wallet to purchase them individually. The 3 stars are for how much this set costs. Personally, it's a preference thing. I prefer NOT to waste so much money just to have a cheap packaged boxed set. Look up the movies individually for specifications on the blu-ray discs as I'm not an expert on that. The movies themselves (not the conversions and all) I'd give 5 stars each.",1288224000,8,898,4.654088050314465

2619930,4,B000GUJYQ0,"The Predator first burst onto the scene in the late 80's and to my surprise several youngsters today were unaware of these first two films.
I had to order these DVDs to enlighten these young men...now they are hooked all over again when I put this ground breaking film into context for them.
These Muscle bound jocks like Jesse Ventura,Arnold Swartzenneger and Mr Action Jackson-Carl Weathers is nothing but Extra Testosterone. I really enjoyed the over hyped macho acting these guys brought to this film...only to be humbled by a creature, all 7-6 plus of him (the late Kevin P Hall)from outer space.
This film was pure adrenalin from start to finish...and Danny Glovers follow up in Predator 2 was nice icing. Yeah the cliched over sexed Los Angeles Backdrop and hyped up gang activity is a lil much but proves necessary for the second Predator to feel at home. This time in the concrete jungle.
I really enjoyed these two films and the Predator is one of the coolest baddies that you will ever see...well as long as he turns off his personal cloaking device.
If you like action,suspense,seeing red blood and florescent green alien blood then I highly recommend this double pack of Predator.
Failing that , have a look at what two politicians( Arnold Swartz & Jesse Ventura) used to get up to back in the day!",1216252800,,1311,4.7043478260869565
2619931,4,B000GUJYQ0,"Sometimes, I'm in the mood for a comedy with witty dialog and clever satire. Sometimes, I'm in the mood for a drama to jerk my tears or stimulate my brain cells. At other times, though, I just want to sit down for a few hours and watch people die in really awesome ways. The Predator movies deliver just that, served up by one of the most wicked killers in movie-villain history, right up there with Chucky, Darth Vader, or the T-1000. And both Predator movies are served up right here, both in their two-disc widescreen glory, in a nifty box set. Though it's not as ""uber"" as the Alien Quadrilogy or Ultimate Matrix Collection, it's about as uber as a two-movie franchise can really expect. I would have given this box set five stars if not for the fact that, from an academic standpoint, they're not really ""good"" movies - they're just good at what they do.",1205107200,,859,4.477707006369426
2619932,4,B000GUJYQ0,"I saw this item advertised and decided to look into it. I wanted the 2 disk versions of each movie and thought this would be a good option..particularly because other reviews indicated it was packaged in a slim case (my shelf needs some room, so consolidation and smaller size, without sacrificing content is attractive to me). Each one of the special editions of these two movies goes for around $13-$15 a piece so it seemed like a good enough deal.
I picked this up and when I first got it in my hands, I started to doubt my choice. As advertised, the slip case contained only 2 slim dvd cases. I wondered if each one of those actually contained contained 2 disk, or did I in fact get the old, bare bones versions? And the fact that there are no specs on the outer slip as to the contents didn't make me feel any better. I slid the snap cases for each film out of the slip case and grew more aggrevated as the back of each case showed the features listed on the ""bare bones"" versions only. I opened the cases and to my relief, it was indeed the 2 disk versions, with a disk on the inside of each door. So it looks like someone at Fox messed up, or was just lazy, because this is the 2 disk version of each film, in the bare bones boxes.
So rest assured, you are getting the 2 disk special editions for a decent price and in a more compact package. (search around...I found mine for a heck of a price elsewhere).
As for the movies, I'm sure you have seen them. Predator, despite a few small moments, still holds up well. I Can't say as much for Pred 2. The movie is dated, and some of the things that made it a bit silly originally, shine even bolder here. Still, when Kevin Peter Hall is onscreen in a Stan Winston designed Predator suit, it is enteratining.
As for the features, there is some real fun stuff here. The cast of both films is entertaining to watch in enterviews..particularly the first film. The first film had a big group of testosterone driven guys and you can tell it was a fun boys club on set. I mean, you have 2 future governors in that cast, both with super competitive personalities bigger than life. As for the second film, I have two words...Gary Busey.
If you don't own the Predator films and are thinking about getting them, this is the way to go...as long as you can overlook the mis-packaging.",1200182400,14,2324,4.296127562642369

8134791,5,B000GUJYQ0,"I love the Alien / Predator franchise!
And these two movies on blu-ray are a must have! And this set delivers... and then some!
PREDATOR:
What I liked was:
1. All the human characters in this movie served a great purpose.
2. The action was hardcore!
3. The visual effects were awesome!
4. The movie had a very simple, yet intriguing plot.

This movie was a great example of a sci-fi / horror / action blend.
Also one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's top ten best movies in my book!
My grade: A+ or five stars!

PREDATOR 2:
What I liked was:
1. Again, the visual effects and action sequences were
hardcore!
2. Most of the characters / actors were great!

What I didn't like was:
1. The movie didn't have enough plot to hold the movie
up some of the time, and seemed mindless at times.
2. The gang wars had too much senseless killing
going on between them and against citizens of L.A.

Overall, a good but not great edition to the AVP universe!
My grade: B- or three stars.

Bottom line: We get to see two of the better looking movies on
Blu-ray and they looked and sounded fantastic! The first movie is
a keeper, but others might have a different out-look on the second
one.
My grade for the set: A- or four-and-a-half stars!",1486944000,2,1218,4.371681415929204
