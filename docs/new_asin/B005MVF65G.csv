4836956,4,B005MVF65G,"**May contain minor spoilers**

An attempt is made to humanize the conspirators, namely Mrs. Surrat, but does so to little effect.  We see no real connection between her and her children, only a story of their drunken father and her attempts to make a living told within the cold stone walls of her prison cell.

Whether she was guilty or not, we may never truly know.  Many versions of her story abound, but in the end, history is written from the standpoint of the victors. We all know - or should know - that.  Evidence has even been presented suggesting Boothe survived long after Lincoln's assassination, evidence with historical backing, but like the evidence in Surrat's case, it has been buried once more.

This could easily turn into an argument of defending assassins, conspirators and such, but the greatest lesson to come from this movie remains.  That lesson is that from Mrs. Surrat's trial came the defense of one of our greatest rights:  The right to a trial by jury in peacetime OR war.  She may have been guilty, but the process of her trial was unfair and unconstitutional.

I don't ""blame the government"" as some one star reviewers suggest. I'm not anti-government. In fact, I am grateful that at long last, decent officials finally realized the injustice of Mrs. Surrat's trial and they agreed to stand for the rights of all by declaring trials like hers would not happen again.

This movie should be viewed as entertainment first, given historical inaccuracies (even the best historical movie has them), but secondly as a chance for us to delve deeper into history. Movies like this one should prompt us to think, to discuss and more importantly to LEARN not just the ""victor's"" point of view, but also the ""loser's.""

All that said, please allow me to interject what I feel is a bit of humor.  At 1:07 in the movie, listen for the modern sounding toilet as Aiken waits to speak with Johnson.  It's just a wee bit out of place, don't you think?",1324166400,,1966,4.6938775510204085
4836957,4,B005MVF65G,"My wife and I saw this movie twice in the theater and will be getting the DVD.

The basic story is told through the other reviewers here so I won't go through the effort to re-write it again.

What must be remembered is that ALL historic movies are just that - MOVIES! If you want history, read some books. One reviewer did it right stating that after the movie, research was sought to find the true story. That's what everyone should do.

Mr. Redford did a fine piece of story telling, but as for history, much has been omitted. Mrs. Surratt was not the saintly woman he portrayed her as in this film.

I've met and spoken with authors of books such as ""Assassin's Accomplice,"" ""American Brutus,"" and ""Lincoln's Avengers."" They do not all agree on Mrs. Surratt's guilt. More though do lean towards guilt.

My opinion is that she WAS guilty. The movie sways the viewer the other way. Still, my wife and I will own this movie.",1324166400,,925,4.449704142011834
4836958,4,B005MVF65G,"This film barely made it to cinema release in the UK and despite having a sterling cast and a director in Robert Redford seems to have received little attention generally on the eastern side of the Atlantic.

Redford has always been a politically engaged individual who has made political films. He showed with the exquiste ""A river runs through it"" that he was confident enough with a story to take his time with it, and with the, in my view, very underrated ""Lions for lambs"" that he was not afraid of making films about ideas that also discuss ideas in some detail.

These elements are drawn together in this movie which explores a dark coda to the Lincoln assasination: the military tribunal which tried the conspirators. The film focuses upon Fredrick Aiken, a former Union officer and lawyer, who is drawn, rather against his will, into defending one of the alleged conspirators, Mary Surrat, the owner of the boarding house where John Wilkes Booth met with his co-conspirators.

This facinating story is not well known, and Redford has drawn from it clear parallels with some of the contemporary abuses of American power that wartime has brought.

I think James McAvoy is one of the most exciting actors alive and here he delivers one of his trademark ham-free performances as Aiken. The rest of the international cast delivers fine support, particularly the great Kevin Kline, brilliantly convincing as Edwin Stanton, the War Secretary, whose single-mindedness in prosecuting the war to preserve the Union threatens the very principles of the Union in the absence of Lincoln's wise authority.

In summary this is a thoughtful, tense and at times very moving courtroom and civil war drama that celebrates moral courage where others have focussed on the physical variety. Vastly better than most of what is available at the multiplex of a weekend.",1323734400,3,1853,4.983818770226537

4836975,1,B005MVF65G,"I saw a display in DC on the events leading up to and including what happened the night of Lincoln's assassination and the subsequent days that gave a great deal of detail that was completely missing from movie. While I can guess that Redford was trying to show the injustice of the trial, it only ended up coming across like a pro-assassin piece.

You have to watch this movie as the fiction that it is -- it has not tried to sell itself as a documentary and would never pass as such. Pretty much every major detail of the events were left out or flat out depicted incorrectly. Based on actual history, there was no doubt that Mary Surratt was guilty. While I have no doubt the tribunal was not friendly to Surratt, it would not have taken the complete railroading and disregard for the law that this movie portrayed to find her guilty.

I always enjoy McAvoy, which is why I put this movie on, but even he was hard to sit through. What could have been a truly interesting movie (I would have highly recommended the display I saw in DC if it was still showing, as it was fascinating) was just bogged down with fiction.",1525132800,,1119,4.375

Lincoln was portrayed as a beloved leader and that isn't as true as many would like you to believe and had Marys son surrendered things would have played out differently. Its hard not to draw comparisons between the events surrounding the assignations of Lincoln and Kennedy in that the alleged shooter knew much more than they were allowed to tell. It was also what appeared to be a good period piece and a single candle didn't light up a room like a 1000w bulb.

Keep in mind, I have never walked out on or turned off any Civil War film. Ever. And I have sat through Gods and Generals TWICE. Clearly I am committed to Hollywood's take on this epic historical event. But I just could not stomach this wretched piece of rubbish.

If the first twenty minutes were any indication of things to come in the rest of the film, then I suppose I would have been treated to more over-wrought testaments to ""American"" jurisprudence - the right to a trial by one's peers and the notion of innocence before guilt can be established without any element of doubt. Thanks for the elementary lesson in  law.

But wait, there are more lessons to be learned here. Yes - Mary Surratt was indeed a woman. Her implication in the murder of Abraham Lincoln and her subsequent execution were shocking to be sure. Thanks for the elementary lesson in nineteenth-century gender assumptions.

The problem, at least in the first few scenes that I could watch, is that both of these issues are of great significance - then and now - but they were glossed over in a tisk-tisk fashion only after dripping a taste of sickening ""look-at-how-we've-progressed-but-there's-still-work-to-be-done"" syrup on for good measure. And even this was done so in a mumbly dead-pan stumble fest. Such nonsense can only refelct some of the worst writing, the worst acting, the worst directing, or a combination of the three. I would have been more riveted watching a plate of white toast get stale as time slowly, painfully passed.

Not that the film was completely lacking in merits. I got a bit of a chuckle at the actor who played John Wilkes Booth. With all the southern-Gothic charm of a junior high production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, his brutish pronunciation of the Virginia state motto in the Ford's Theatre scene - sic semper tyrannis - was delightful. I suppose this was merely an effort to ""southernize"" or if you like, ""Rebelize"" the president's assassin (who was not a redneck but a classically trained actor), by giving him a slightly raspier Jethro Bodine-esque accent. Such clumsy and obvious efforts make me laugh.

But who knows? Maybe the utter brilliance of rest of the film made up for the first twenty minutes. I will never know. Perhaps it got slightly less patronizingly preachy. Maybe there was a musical number. Maybe robots. If anyone has seen the whole thing, chime in.

4836994,3,B005MVF65G,"Review of The Conspirator
Hot Toasty Rag, September 25, 2017

The Conspirator is a courtroom drama about those involved in Abraham Lincolns assassination. Major history buffs might already know the tidbits presented in this story, but I was a political science major in college, and even I was surprised by parts of the plot.

Seven men are on trial, as well as one woman, the mother of one of the co-conspirators. The only man who steps up as a defense lawyer for the accused is the young and inexperienced James McAvoy, and he comes across countless obstacles as he tries to give Robin Wright her right to a fair trial.

If you didn't know Robert Redford directed this movie, you would probably think to yourself, James McAvoy must really like Robert Redford! As it is, Im sure he does like Robert Redford, as does the rest of the all-star cast, since stars famously vie to work for the father of Sundance. If you close your eyes during some of the courtroom speeches, it almost sounds like Redford himself is talking. I think the directorial influence on the leading actor is rather cute, and its easy to imagine that had this movie been made thirty years earlier, the defense lawyer would probably have been blond.

The Conspirator has beautiful, realistic set and costume design, and the men in the castMcAvoy, Kevin Kline, Tom Wilkinson, and Colm Meaneyseem authentic in their surroundings. My biggest complaint about the film are the ladies. Neither Robin Wright, nor Evan Rachel Wood, and especially not Alexis Bledel, seem like they belonged in the 1860s. Trying to ignore Bledels contemporary face and voice is impossible, but thankfully she has a very tiny part. Wood also feels very contemporary, the way she moves and the patter of her speech. And even though Wright has a plain face and doesnt sound like a California valley girl, she still seems contemporary. Women were treated differently back then, and a woman her age would have a completely different aura from decades of living in the 1800s. Wright feels like an independent woman who has never been mistreated or disrespected.

That criticism aside, if you like that era of history, this is a very good movie to watch. Robert Redford is an excellent director, and its very fun to see McAvoy project his essence in the lead role.",1506297600,,2300,4.797979797979798

4837024,5,B005MVF65G,"It's one of the most meaningful, and well presented, movies about American history ever. It's been over 150 years since the American system underwent a radical change with the regime of Lincoln, possibly the most hated man in American history, which is probably why they made him a saint.
This movie will give even the most history-challenged Americans  pause for thought about the nature of monarchical  government .
  Be ready to pay attention and see the ""civil war"" for what it was: a meltdown of  independence. This movie will become more relevant  as time goes on.
Mary Surat is spellbinding and the rest of the cast is great.
  Warning : it portrays a few Southerners as good people.",1470528000,,690,4.788135593220339

4837028,5,B005MVF65G,"When it comes to the story of Mary Surratt, everyone knows how the story ends.  You may not know the name, but you will recall who she was:  she ran the boarding house in which John Wilkes Booth & his cronies devised plans to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln, Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward.  {While it was not mentioned in the movie, I believe they also conspired to assassinate Ulysses S. Grant as well}.  Everyone assumed that she ""had"" to know what was going on, given that she owned the boarding house.

While everyone knows how the story ends,  almost nobody outside the esoteric realm of civil war era historians are familiar with the intricacies of her case.......until now.  The present movie takes the viewer back in time to 1865.  The civil war is over, but it will claim one last high ranking casualty:  Abraham Lincoln.  Seward was stabbed several times, but he lived.  Andrew Johnson escaped the plot to kill him unscathed.  The entire country wanted revenge.  There was also a fear that anything short of a swift show of might would embolden other southerners to try an insurrection.  These were delicate times.

Such is the backdrop of the present movie.  It questions where a person's right to a fair trial is usurped by that nagging variable known as political expediency.  Should anyone ever be used as a judicial sacrificial lamb?  The storyline has obvious overtones which parallel our own times.  We have a great many people accused of terrorism that we are holding @ Gitmo.  They are not even American citizens.  Do they have rights?  If so, what rights to we grant them?  When we have pundits on FOX NEWS espousing that we should just ""skip the trials & shoot them"" the didactic point of the present movie strikes home.

For people who have read Plato and / or have an interest in the concept of justice, this disc is highly recommended.  For civil era buffs, this film is an absolute must-have.  Was Mary Surratt guilty or innocent?  You decide ~ but watch this movie 1st.",1467417600,,2039,4.71875

I mean the trial itself was as pointed out that was thrown together in a unfair selection of judges, jury, etc. making it certain that Mary Suruat wouldn't receive a fair trial.

4837037,5,B005MVF65G,"About Mary Surrat and more...A timely review of a situation where the state of emergency in the country allowed the military to take over the trial of civilian suspects. In ex parte Milligan, the United States Supreme Court held that the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act that had been in place since 1864 -  did not itself authorize trial by military tribunals, and that neither the Act nor the laws of war permitted the imposition of martial law when civilian courts were open and operating unimpeded.
 The Guantanamo Bay situation raised similar issues though the laws had been clarified-once more- by President Andrew Johnson's issuance of Proclamation 148 that lifted the suspension at the end of the civil war.
I suspect Mr. Redford is not indifferent to the parallels of what is happening at the present moment.

4837046,4,B005MVF65G,"I applaud the creators of the film for attempting to be as historically accurate as possible, but I was disappointed that nothing was portrayed about Lincoln's Vice President, Andrew Johnson, in the film.  He played a very important part in Mary Surratt's story, and in the assassination of Lincoln.  Much pressure was placed on him to commute Mary's sentence to imprisonment, many military officers and politicians didn't want the stigma of executing a woman.  Mary's daughter Anna, as well as family members of the others accused, attempted to plead their case with Andrew Johnson at the White House several times, but were refused admittance.  Also, on the day of the assassination John Wilkes Booth left a calling card in Andrew Johnson's ""message box"" at the hotel he was living at, and it's always been a mystery as to what connection he had with Booth.  Not to mention the fact that Andrew Johnson was supposed to be the third government official to be assassinated in the conspiracy... (with Lincoln and Seward) but his would-be assassin ""chickened out"" at the last minute.  All of this history was left out of the film.  For that reason I give the film a 4 instead of a 5.",1454457600,10,1181,4.788177339901478

4837126,2,B005MVF65G,"A static and forced history lesson of a film, not quite alive or gripping for such a compelling story.  Heavily skewed towards Robin Wright's forlorn and downtrodden portrayal of Mary Surrat as an innocent victim of the justice system. Most historical accounts reveal that she was not innocent.

Much of the script is taken from the Lincoln murder trial transcript for credibility. On spite of it, there are many liberties with other actual facts, the presumed innocence of Surrat among the most egregious. Though an important story, director Robert Redford misses the mark here. Read James Swanson's book Manhunt / The 12 Day Chase For Lincoln's Killer for a more thorough and credible account of the events of the assassination that lead up to the trial.",1440892800,8,756,4.992063492063492

I did not realize there were questions about Mary Surratt's guilt or issues with the trial.  I learned a lot.

4837206,4,B005MVF65G,"L.A. Law meets post-Civil War Guantanamo Bay in this ""outstandingly"" performed military tribunal melodrama. Passionately acted by Leads, James McAvoy (representing Attorney Frederick Aiken), and House of Cards Star, Robin Wright (Mary Surratt, defendant and mother of Confederate sympathizer Son). Supporting roles by Tom Wilkinson and colossal English actor, (Reverdy Johnson), Colm Meaney (Judge Hunter) and Kevin Kline (Edwin M. Stanton).

Robert Redford produces and directs a freshly versioned Lincoln conspiracy story and period piece. No political agendas or personal social statements in this movie. Redford plays it mostly straight upholding historical fact with courtroom dialog from the original transcripts. The result: an unexpected but welcomed courtroom suspense thriller where the moviegoer tries their own case as 13th juror, assigning guilt or innocence. I was particularly impressed with cast wardrobe. Uniform / dress textures and colors were vibrant and tangible  hoorah for 1080p! FOUR STARS from this old school Perry Mason fan and anti-special effects talkie snob!

4837282,3,B005MVF65G,"A well told story of how fear arising from war, the Civil War and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, drives men to abandon the Constitutional rights of American citizens in the name of peace and security for US citizens.  The story evokes other similar incidents in our history as a nation.  The internment of over 100,000 Japanese Americans by FDR, in early 1942, in essentially prisoner of war camps.  In our recent history, the reaction to events of 9-11 saw the Congress, adopt with only one dissenting vote the Patriot Act.  Implementation lead to widespread data collection, searching financial records, confinement of foreign nationals under conditions often in violation of Geneva accords for the treatment of prisoners, in general the broad trampling of Constitutional rights.  Robert Redford's movie provokes us to consider why our leaders, men sworn to uphold the Constitution do, in the face of danger and threats to our security from enemies foreign and domestic, turn their backs on the Constitution and act in contravention to the core beliefs established with the founding of this nation.",1431648000,3,1107,5.196629213483146

The use of lighting, or perhaps ill use, is odd.  The sun in the eyes of the viewer (us), makes it difficult sometimes to keep an eye on the subject rather than illustrate the scene as it should be.  Regardless, the director felt it necessary to show this as part of the movie.  While it may be an irritant to me it does add to the tension of the movie.

I do feel this movie shows far more about the post war and subsequent ill feelings and animosity of Southerners towards the North.  The acting is quite good on ""both sides"".  It is terribly important to remember, especially in this age of issues (most recently Baltimore, April, 2015) that a lynch mob is still a lynch mob regardless of whose authority.  We still have certain rights such as a right to a prejudice free trial by a jury of our peers.

4837333,3,B005MVF65G,"3 1/2 stars -- this is a nice costume drama with a timely flavor, but it lacks a bit in intensity.  It's the story of Mary Surratt (Robin Wright), mother of one of the conspirators in Lincoln's assassination (and the attempted assassination of the Vice-President and Secretary of State), and the effort to defend her by the young lawyer (and former Union officer) Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy).  It becomes clear early to Aiken that the government wants to execute Surratt as a way of discouraging those few Confederate soldiers who are continuing to fight on, even after Lee's surrender.  I call it timely, for at the time of its release in 2010, the issue in the US was very much the question of what was justified in the name of national security, as the former members of the Bush administration sought to justify harsh measures and even torture against terrorist suspects and to justify too the treatment of them in special courts outside the civilian justice system.  In ""The Conspirator,"" there is also military court, and it seems quite obvious that Aiken's maneuvering as a defense lawyer is going to be quite limited.  It doesn't help that Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Kevin Kline) has his thumb firmly on the scales of justice, and it is he who articulates quite unapologetically the idea that since the Union is still in danger, justice might have to take a back seat to expediency.  He's not above pressuring witnesses and suborning perjury, and as Aiken tries to defend his client in these circumstances, his own loyalty comes into question, despite his having been a wounded and honorably-serving veteran.  By the end, suffice it to say, Aiken is thoroughly disillusioned by the law and its susceptibility to political manipulation.

These issues are important, so it's a pity that the movie is so low-key.  Nobody does a bad job -- with Robin Wright being perhaps the most compelling performer -- but it seems more interested in setting out the issues than in engaging us with them vividly via drama.  A movie like this should make its points, of course, but when, in the course of the movie, you feel the points being checked off, then something is missing.  Robert Redford directs with efficiency, and the story lines are clear, but in his earlier ""Quiz Show,"" for example, the legal setting and the acting generated some heat.  Here we have light without the heat, and if it's not really all that bad, it's nonetheless not up to Redford's best or the best of the very fine cast, whom we've seen being much more engaging in other movies.",1429574400,,2559,4.777777777777778

The lawyer is portrayed by James McAvoy who was the star of the show for me.  I found the character of Suratt well done (Robin Wright) but I didn't care much about her. It was the lawyer's efforts. Well worth watch. The other spot on effort was done by Kevin Kline as Stanton. He should have gotten an Oscar nomination as supporting actor. I would love to see a bio film with Kline as Stanton.

Though the interpretation of Suratt's involvement with the assassination can be disagreed with, at least the history is close to what happened. Nice to see somebody care about the history for a change. You can watch this one with the family.",1428710400,,784,4.5928571428571425

4837385,4,B005MVF65G,"I enjoyed the film and recommend it. I thought Redford's direction was competent, which you'd expect, but not highly imaginative. I suppose some of this goes to the script and the camera work, but I'm sure Redford had all the authority needed to make any changes there and chose not to. I'm finding this with Eastwood as well--these great actors have spent years on sets and must know everything a director needs to know in order to function. I once worked on a show with another prominent Hollywood actor who had it in her contract that she would direct one or more episodes each season. I was walking through the building one day and overheard her and her cameraman discussing lens selection and it was like listening to astrophysicists--I had no idea what they were talking about. But just because someone is highly knowledgeable doesn't mean he or she is fully suited for direction at the highest level. There are incredible directors who are less successful as actors. Redford's a great actor and a competent director, but in my opinion not a great director.  I feel a little bad pointing this out, but it is what it is.

The only other criticism I have is similarly qualified. I thought Robin Wright's performance was good, but somewhat limited. Her characterization of the alleged conspirator in the plot against Lincoln reminded me too much of her characterization in ""House of Cards,"" where she plays Kevin Spacey's wife--a little too heavy on the forbearance and glacial remove.

4837512,4,B005MVF65G,"From what I've read so far, this film is historically accurate - which is not the end all be all, but that's a great starting point for a film about an actual, historical event. Some folks think historically accurate = boring. For me, accuracy counts. A film that has many untruths is hard to watch. Knowing that what you see is an accurate depiction gives it that much more credibility in my mind.
That's not to say that everything that is historically accurate is entertaining. But this film not only appears to be accurate, it is also entertaining as well. James McAvoy does a credible job in the lead role, but Robin Wright steals the show.
The film also does a great job in not making judgment as to the guilt or innocence of Mary Surratt. That's a huge thing. I believe it accurately depicts the rush to judgment by the US, Stanton in particular, of those charged in the conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln.

4837549,2,B005MVF65G,"The problem with movies based on historical facts is that some writer wants to ""jazz it up."" If the truth gets in the way of the plot, then just ignore the truth. As a movie, it was quite enjoyable. I have no complaints of the acting (but the casting of Booth must not have been much of a priority).

From a historical vantage you do get the core nugget of truth, that Mary Surratt, an American citizen and a civilian was tried by a military tribunal (in kangaroo court fashion), with little due process and with complete disregard for the truth.

This movie however also disregards the truth. It focuses on one of Mrs. Surratt's attorneys, fictionalizing an account of his crusade to defend his client. The fact is that Mrs. Surratt's attorneys gave her a dreadful defense, and she bemoaned this fact all the way to the gallows.

This movie lost focus. The true facts of these rag tag conspirators led by a narcissistic and psychotic stage actor would have made for a fascinating movie. When fact is stranger than fiction, Hollywood should not embellish away the facts. If the focus had been on Mary Surratt; instead of on some minor attorney, then there would not have been any need to play so loosey-goosey with the facts.",1424476800,4,1225,4.610091743119266

4837553,4,B005MVF65G,Overall a good movie.  The story is one that had been largely ignored by history.  In an unusual portrayal of historical events it points out the lengths to which a prosecution will go to achieve its desired ends.  The courtroom drama and the events outside the courtroom that effect the overall outcome of the trial are well played yet in some cases over played.

4837598,3,B005MVF65G,"Anyone with a passing knowledge of American history knows that Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by actor John Wilkes Booth. What ISN'T commonly known is that Booth was part of a ring of Confederate conspirators.

And one of the most important trials of the 19th century comes to life in ""The Conspirator,"" Robert Redford's dramatization of the trial of Mary Surratt and the men who conspired with Booth. James McAvoy and Robin Wright both give stellar performances as a clever young lawyer and a woman railroaded by an angry, vengeful government, but the direction often loses its energy and becomes rather flat and stagey.

In 1865, the Civil War has just ended and the North is celebrating its victory. But then assassins are sent to attack the Secretary of State and the Vice President. And at a play that Lincoln is attending, Booth (Toby Kebbell) shoots the president, shouts ""Sic Semper Tyrannis! The South is avenged!"" and somehow manages to escape the theatre. The dying Lincoln is taken to a nearby house, and dies shortly after. The conspirators are hunted down, and Booth is killed when they are burned out of the barn where they are hiding.

One of the suspects is Mary Surratt (Wright), the mother of one conspirator and the owner of a boardinghouse where they met. Since the government is determined to punish as many people as possible, she is presumed by everyone -- including former soldier/up-and-coming lawyer Frederick Aiken (McAvoy) -- to be completely guilty.

Then Aiken finds himself in the horrible position of having to defend her, even though he doesn't doubt her guilt. But her innocence or guilt soon become less certain in his mind, even as he realizes that the trial of the suspects is not a true trial -- witnesses are bribed or threatened, and the prosecution refuses to even consider that Mary might not have been a conspirator. As Aiken's life and career fall apart, he throws himself into the last desperate attempts to save her from the hangman's noose.

While obviously the assassination of Lincoln was an important moment in American history, ""The Conspirator"" looks at the smaller, groundbreaking changes that happened because of it -- namely, the first execution of a white woman by the federal government, and the new right of a civilian trial instead of a merely-a-formality-before-we-hang-everyone military tribunal. It's a sobering reminder that government corruption is nothing new, and that basic rights like a proper trial by one's peers must be fought for constantly, not just once.

As the backdrop to this drama, Redford does an excellent job portraying the fractured, fragile nature of a post-Civil War United States -- there's an undercurrent of seething rage and pain from both sides, glazed over with Washington parties and jaunts to elegant theatres. And the depiction of Lincoln's final hours is absolutely riveting, with the desperate and hysterical citizens crowding outside the building where he dies, surrounded by dead-eyed, hopeless officials and doctors.

Unfortunately, the movie loses a lot of its energy after the first half hour. After that first burst of energy, Mary and the conspirators are all captured and... it simply becomes very very contemplative and stagey, more like a play than a proper movie. Redford doesn't seem to quite know how to inject suspense into the courtroom drama scenes, relying mostly on the occasional outburst from Wright or McAvoy to give it some passion. So for long stretches, it just sort of drags itself along, floating Aiken through subplots that aren't very interesting (such as his visit to Mary's daughter).

McAvoy and Wright both give excellent performances here, as world-weary people who hail from opposite sides of a war that has blistered them both -- he is a fierce young lawyer whose love of justice overrides any blind loyalty to the War Department, and she is a quiet, tormented enigma whose guilt or innocence is never entirely clear. There are some solid performances by Evan Rachel Wood, Colm Meaney, Tom Wilkensen and Danny Huston, but the story effectively revolves around those two actors and the oddly combative chemistry they share.

""The Conspirator"" is graced with some excellent performances and a great setting, but Robert Redford's stage-like story seems to lose its momentum after the first half hour, making it a chore to sit through some of the story. A fascinating if flawed story.",1423094400,2,4414,5.060522696011004

It's never satisfying to see what might be considered justice, run off the rails, especially by the military, the government, or nowadays, corporations. In the heat of the moment and with the cruel desire for revenge, the first woman in U.S. history was murdered by the State. President Lincoln would not have approved of it, though he too did what he felt was necessary in a time of Civil War. Madness, all madness. And when the need for revenge cooled, and her son John went to trial, he was set free, just as his mother ought to have been.

4837810,4,B005MVF65G,An interesting story about the conspirators who planned to kidnap Lincoln from a different perspective- the defense of Mary Surratt. The photography was excellent and I kept wondering where it was shot (I didn't watch the credits). Don't know if the Washington Arsenal (Navy Yard) had a moat around it but the interiors where the trial took place and the courtyard where the hangings occurred were accurate representations of the photos of the period. The ending leaves out the disposition of the conspirators (except for John Surratt). Dr. Samuel Mudd was only mentioned when they named the conspirators at the beginning of the trial and when they described the medical attention Booth received during his escape. Dr. Mudd escaped the gallows by one vote and was sentenced to life imprisonment at Ft. Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas.  He was pardoned by President Andrew Johnson in 1869.,1418083200,,886,5.068493150684931

So often, we only hear about John Wilkes Booth when discussing or reading about the death of our 16th President, but this movie brought me into the life of another person who was caught up in the conspiracy to kill both a beloved and hated man.  It also dealt with highly complex and emotional issues of the time involving putting a woman on trial for her life and the range of consequences she could face.

By the time the movie was over I was filled with a range of emotions, a feat not often brought out by a movie.",1417478400,,599,4.378378378378378

I was not familiar, however, with the details of this case or how relevant it would be to our present time. Trying civilians before a military tribunal came up once again in the aftermath of 9/11. I'd always assumed that Mary Surratt was guilty; now I'm not so sure. However, anyone who knows this case understands Surratt's guilt or innocence is not the crux of this case. People concerned with the Bill of Rights and those liberties protected by our Constitution would do well to see this movie. I think it would surprise many to see that the country once looked at Southerners with the same degree of suspicion that many today look at Muslims. The lesson we always seem to forget is that our rights mean nothing if they don't protect everyone in times of crisis as well as times of peace.",1417392000,,989,4.593220338983051

For the most part acting was good and the story line was engaging. I am a student of civil war history and would have been put off if the story line had deviated too far from historical reality. Thank goodness it didn't do so too much.

4837965,4,B005MVF65G,"Well acted by James McAvoy, who is drafted as defense attorney for Mary Surratt (acted by Robin Wright, whose performance is also strong - I didn't even recognized her!). Originally reluctant to defend her, McAvoy's character become a passionate believer in her innocence and pays a personal price for strong defense when the powers-that-be and the public would have preferred a perfunctory one. (Obvious parallels with Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."") The movie's point of view is that Mrs. Surratt was railroaded, but the historical record is less clear. Mrs. Surratt must have known there was a conspiracy, although perhaps not an assassination, in the works.

Were they entitled to the same standards of justice which existed even one day before the assassination or because of the country's emotional injury was ""justice"" even possible? ""Just shoot them"" was a common solution that had gained wide support even in the upper reaches of government.

At the first, ""The Conspirator"" seems to be just another history movie for those who are interested in the era, but with an excellent cast and writing, the movie shows us the issues that people had in 1895 were not that different from those many of us have today regarding American citizens who support causes to harm the United States but are not the ones that pull the trigger.",1415491200,,889,4.926666666666667

There was so much fear and ""need for revenge"" that perhaps Mary Surrat was more of an unfortunate bystander than a quasi-participant in those unfortunate events in 1865.

Well written, acted and directed. Production values were extremely high considering the time that has transpired since the events actually happened.

How ironic that Lincoln began a major Party which today has fostered the very EVIL he would have been opposed to in principle and in fact.

Much like many historical ""relooks"" done today it is critical of events and characters by todays standards alone.  While many of the events are depicted truly, the morality slant of the producer and director on the events are tilted to a viewpoint that probably did not have any consequence at the actual time in history.

It shows with striking clarity two historical facts:  that the nation wanted blood after the assassination and was determined to have it and that our basic freedoms as set forth in the Constitution--like the right to a trial by jury and the writ of habeas corpus--are so important and were in grave danger just after the Civil War. Through Robert Redford's  skilled direction, we learn how Mary Surratt was put to trial and executed at the whim of a military tribunal, not with a fair, public trial before a jury. Her simple rights as an American such as the right to face her accusers, the right to a jury trial, and the right to appeal any verdict were trampled on in the wake of the Republican nation's quest for vengence.

When freedom and justice were served up as expendable in the supposed interest of what certain government officials saw as the greater good.  God help us all when someone comes into power who thinks they know what is best for everyone.  I do not think there is any doubt Mary Surratt received no justice.
You are also introduced to the lawyer who I had never thought about before.  A man of courage even if he was no convinced of the woman's innocence felt she deserved a fighting chance and fair trail.

4838291,5,B005MVF65G,"Director and producer Robert Redford shows that the debates we have today on the relevancy of Constitutional rights during exceptional times like war or acts of terror are not new, but occupy a significant part of the American experience--although an often ignored part.

The film is based on the true story of the military trial of Mary Surrat, one of the accused conspirators in the Lincoln assassination. Surrat (played by Robin Wright) was unfortunate enough to own the boarding house where several of the conspirators met--including her son. A military court is ordered by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, one of the most infamous characters in Lincoln's cabinet. It was Stanton who ordered and oversaw, with Lincoln's approval, the mass arrests and imprisonment of thousands of American citizens during the war. Most of those imprisoned were newspaper editors and reporters, anti-war (or anti-Lincoln) Democrats, alleged Southern sympathizers, and simply anyone the government wanted out of the way.

Stanton now orchestrates a kangaroo court to provide an angry and paranoid nation with swift ""justice"" for the accused and ""healing for the nation.""

The military court is selected by Stanton. The accused are not allowed to testify in their own defense. Surrat herself is kept in solitary confinement under constant guard. Oddly enough, the attorney chosen to represent Surrat is a former Union war hero lately turned lawyer, Captain Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy). Aiken is chosen by his firm to represent Surrat because he is not a Southerner. He is a reluctant defender completely prejudiced against Surrat at the beginning.

But as the mock trial commences, Aiken is troubled by the complete lack of regard for constitutional protections and due process owed his client. Witnesses are threatened, attorney/client privilege is suspended, and false witnesses are brought forward to accuse Surrat. Aiken becomes disillusioned that the country he fought four years to defend is allowing such a mockery of justice to an American citizen.

Meanwhile, Aiken loses friends daily as war fever rages and anyone not walking in lockstep with Stanton's policies is considered seditious and unpatriotic. At one point, Aiken confronts Secretary Stanton about the injustice of the case, and Stanton reminds him of a primary argument that Lincoln himself used in defending the Civil War: the rights enjoyed by Americans are not as important as the security of the nation itself.

Lincoln was confronted early in the war by opponents in Congress who asked him to justify the multiple constitutional violations being perpetrated by the administration. Lincoln responded that he was violating part of the Constitution in order to prevent the whole of it being violated by the ""rebels.""

The confusing, purely political logic of Lincoln would be easily flagged by the historian enjoying the advantage of hindsight if Lincoln's position had not later been recycled by Stanton, Woodrow Wilson, FDR, LBJ, Bush I and II, Obama, and basically anyone wanting a trump card over the ""Supreme Law of the Land."" Americans are historically so conditioned to ""exceptions"" to Constitutional freedoms and guarantees that the exceptions have become the rule.

Redford shows great wisdom and depth by selecting the Surrat case as the stage on which he presents his audience with the horrible consequences of a ""government by expediency."" The idolatrous devotion of Americans to the ""Lincoln myth"" would make it impossible for Redford to make his point had he chosen any number of equally tragic cases that took place prior to Mary Surrat's during the Civil War. But Redford wisely picks an easy moral case. Surrat was a widow and a single parent who was in the wrong place at the wrong time in a post-Lincoln regime governed by easy villains who not one in a thousand Americans could name in a lineup today.

Captain Aiken easily shows that the government can only prove beyond a shadow of doubt that Surrat is guilty of nothing more than being the mother of one of the suspected conspirators. Yet the government argues that the ""interests of the nation"" must be placed ahead of the rights of the individual. Stanton argues that too much blood has already been shed. If Surrat is freed, then the nation risks further unrest and a continuation of war. It may be wrong to execute Mary Surrat, but it would be worse not to execute her. In the end, the cowardice and fear of men (who should have protected the innocent and weak) allowed Mary Surrat to be hung by the neck until dead.

At the end of the film, Redford inserts a post script before the credits, pointing out that the US Supreme Court ruled one year later (in Ex parte Milligan) that American citizens could not be tried in a military court--even during war time. So the audience is left with some assurance that Surrat's case was a recognized exception and her death not entirely in vain.

But, alas, Redford's charitable desire to provide some relief to his morally indignant audience is muted in those of us who did not fall asleep during our postbellum American history classes. The US Supreme Court ruling in Milligan took place in 1866. But the radical Republican-controlled Congress passed the first of several Reconstruction Acts in 1867. These acts effectively abolished the Southern states, divided the South into five military districts, and put the whole region under marshal law. When Congress feared retribution by the Supreme Court, it simply abolished the Habeus Corpus Act and removed the issue from the Court's jurisdiction. The fit of madness that condemned Mary Surrat to death would last another 10 years. Some believe it has never fully ended.",1410998400,,5697,5.088865096359743

Even the much celebrated Union army reputedly the victors and on the right side of the cause was not above such attitude, in this case, the inn-keeper, Mary Surrat along with others irrespective of the fact that there was no actual evidence against her. Also it becomes clear that President Andrew Johnson fell far short of filling Lincoln's shoes when it came to justice or magnanimity towards the supposed 'enemy'.

But what do you know of the trial of those accused of conspiring with Booth? Maybe you know Dr Mudd was imprisoned for setting Booth's broken leg.

Mary Surratt was an inn keeper, and certainly a Southern sympathizer. But was she a conspirator in the plot to assassinate Lincoln?

The movie follows the trial of Mary Surratt. Despite her attorney's protestations she was tried by a military tribunal. Convicted, she became the first woman to be executed by the federal government.

Following her death the US Supreme Court ruled that even in time of war a civilian citizen was entitled to a civilian, not a miltary trial.

Robert Redford makes good movies, but he's very liberal and tried to make her the abused innocent mother of one the conspirators, and the owner of a boarding house where the conspirators stayed. Unfortunately, 'Cuzin' Mary was up to her bonnet in the planning and execution (no pun intended) of the murder and attempted murders. She was guilty. But where Redford did well was show how sentiments were so strong that those in charge really did abuse her Constitutional rights and railroaded her through the trial, found her guilty then hanged he with three of the others. What if she had been given her rights? Maybe she would have received a prison sentence, as did a couple of the others. But was she guilty of the charges? Definitely. Robin Wright did a good job as Mary (Jenkins) Surratt, and several others did their parts well. I especially liked the recreation of the buildings and the prison.",1385337600,,1144,4.782828282828283

4838343,4,B005MVF65G,"Like most Robert Redford films, this movie about the trial of Lincoln's assassination conspirators is historically meticulous and dramatically rich, but also slow-moving and frequently under-played in key moments. In the extra features, Redford said he was going for a deliberately musty look to the sets, unfortunately resulting in an ""Antiques Roadshow"" vibe that weighs the film down like a lead ball while leaching the visceral impact of every scene. But the film is certainly well-cast with many familiar TV and cinema faces. James McAvoy is good as the idealistic young lawyer assigned to defend Mary Surratt, a Southern Catholic widow who ran the boarding house where John Wilkes Booth and friends planned the death of Abraham Lincoln, leaving herself as the only female conspirator charged in military court with treason. Redford analogizes the post-assassination backlash of 1865 to present-day abuse of civil liberties. Rather than taking sides for or against Surratt, played here with iron resolve by Robin Wright Penn, Redford lets her remain distant, trying to suggest her guilt and innocence simultaneously. Ironically, the greater historicity here means weakened drama, for which Redford relies on Kevin Kline in a clearly villainous role as War Secretary Edwin Stanton. It creates a weird sense of disconnect to see Stanton consistently played as a villain while Surratt is played as an enigma rather than hero. It's a good film, but not great. Daniel Day-Lewis probably did a better job in ""Lincoln"" because of his efforts to provide insights into Lincoln's character. This film refuses to give us real insight into anyone except McAvoy, whose gradual transformation comes across here as a touch more self-righteous than genuine. The film should have been about the titular Mary Surratt, not her lawyer.",1381536000,,1820,5.322916666666667

If for no other reason than to shed a bit of truth on what usually gets REALLY glossed over.
Lincolns Northern War of Aggression was my countries darkest hour.
If you think people...especially Politicians and Generals...cared anymore more about slaves than did their opposite Southern numbers did...you need to get a grip.
States rights and paving the way for Northern Capital and a Northern Industrial Revolution is what happened.
Factory owners do not want to own slaves...they want wage slaves. Once the Southern Governments were swepped aside...the carpet baggers moved in...and Northern capital theories were imposed.
It was not until a man named Martin King Jr...100 years later....,came along did The North take a look at the misery they helped to create in The South.

The returning war hero/attorney Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) will do anything to protect the constitution even if government control is stalled, on the basis there is no point of having a nation if the protected rights of its citizens are lost.

This movie seems well-directed, the acting is great, and the story is compelling.

4838381,1,B005MVF65G,"As a movie:
Even judged as a propaganda film, this is a bad movie. For ""preaching to the choir"", I would give it 3-stars (""It's OK""), but for the general audience, it is 1-star.

Because of the script, most of the characters are little more than cardboard cut-outs. Only Robin Wright (as Mary Surratt) has presence as a character. The other main character is her lawyer Frederick Aiken (played by James McAvoy), but his role is primarily to be outraged, thereby serving as a vehicle for preaching at the audience. I quickly developed an unintended dislike for his character, which increased throughout the movie.

The scenes are set-pieces and the flow is poor, resulting in a movie that feels slow-paced and meandering. There is no sense of grappling with the issues or alternatives -- there are only pronouncements and posturing. The movie doesn't rise to even the level of a mediocre episode of Law and Order. Also, many of the scenes do not feel authentic (beyond the costumes and sets). First, many of Aiken's diatribes feel incredibly modern, including things that you weren't likely to hear in 1965, much less in 1865 (I am both old enough and young enough to remember the 1960s). Second, the portrayal of the trial feels derivative of too many movies about military (show) trials, reinforcing my assessment below that the script wasn't driven by the history.

As history:
This movie prominently advertises itself as presenting a true story, and this needs to be rebutted. If one watches the documentary in the Extras or reads the history, the kindest thing that can be said is that the movie ""was inspired by actual events"", or more accurately that it cherry-picked and distorted events. The viewer will likely have the false impression that this was a short, hurried trial (there was a long line of both prosecution and defense witnesses). That there was little evidence of her guilt. That Mary Surratt was badly mistreated, for example being denied visits by her daughter. ...

The movie presents images that are virtually guaranteed to be misinterpreted. For example, the prisoners are shown with bags over their heads, invoking parallels to torture. However, those were _padded_ bags and were introduced in response to a suicide attempt, but apparently were also intended to keep the prisoners from communicating with each other. The bags did turn out to be painful, but I haven't seen anything that suggests that was intentional (above the level of the jailers putting on bags more tightly than needed).

The documentary (in the Extras) briefly raises the point that much of the controversy about Mary Surratt's guilt was rooted not in the factual evidence, but in sexism -- that a woman wouldn't/couldn't do such a thing. Yet you won't see this in the movie even though it was a significant part of the trial (character witnesses, pleas for clemency, ...).

In describing the response to the assassination, one of the movie's historians describes that assassination as unthinkable. Yet there had been multiple assassination attempts against Lincoln, starting before his inauguration.

One of those historians repeatedly attributes Mary Surratt's execution to animosity against Catholics, yet never explains (beyond the existence of religious prejudices) and never mentions that there was a large population of Catholics in Maryland -- because it was founded as a colony as a refuge for Catholics (Aside: In case you are wondering, some of my ancestors came to the US as Protestants fleeing Catholics, some as Catholics fleeing Protestants, and some as Protestants fleeing other types of Protestants).

One of the historians in the Extras took umbrage at the measures taken to keep the conspirators from escaping on the reasoning that they hadn't yet been convicted. This seems suggestive of the politics underlying the movie.

Some of the historians in the documentary seem to be pushing political agendas. One talks about Sec of War Stanton pushing to get ""a correct result"" as if that was unconnected to justice. Yet the history of the investigation and the trial was one of focusing in on only the most central of the plotters -- many who were unquestionably Confederate sympathizers but were only minor facilitators of the plot were not prosecuted, and not all those convicted were executed. Yet the movie gives the strong impression that the political pressures was to execute persons without concern for their guilt. If so, why include a woman which was bound to be highly controversial?

The presentation of the choice to use a military tribunal in both the included documentary and the movie fails to provide even a cursory appreciation for the problems of a civilian trial. For example, until the influx of Northerners during the Civil War, Washington DC was a decidedly Southern city and very pro-slavery (much of the Capitol Building construction used slave labor) and at the time of the trial still had very large pro-Confederacy elements -- the conspirators were hardly alone in this (Aside: neighboring Maryland was a slave state, and although it did not join the Confederacy, much of its population was pro-slavery). In a civilian trial, how would one credibly assemble a jury where there wouldn't be at least one juror who would ignore the facts and instead vote his pro-slavery politics? What would have been the results of a wrongful acquittal of the conspirators?

Although the movie is based on the belief that politics determined the verdict, its rendering of the politics of the time is not to be taken seriously. It is minimal, simplistic and mostly wrong.

----
As an allegory:
It is hard to believe that this movie is not intended primarily as a comment on military tribunals in the current ""Global War on Terror"", and was distorted to fill that role. Instead, the Lincoln assassination should be viewed as the opening act in a century of terrorism associated with the Ku Klux Klan (and its predecessors and similar organizations). With the defeat of the Confederate armies, the Union was desperate to keep the rebel troops from melting away and forming guerrilla bands and having the war likely continue for decades. While that was largely prevented, the South stepped down one notch on the insurgency intensity scale and resorted to a widespread campaign of terror to virtually re-institute slavery under other guises and to re-assert the economic and political power of large portions of the old slave-holding class. The North temporarily won the Civil War in 1865, but the South's near-total victory was completed by 1877 (with a few remaining pockets of resistance to be mopped up).

Although the trial of Mary Surratt was hardly perfect, it was good-enough and justice was almost certainly done. And it showed a government that could respond effectively and intelligently to an extreme act of terror. It did not wildly and indiscriminately over-react, but implemented a limited, highly targeted response that was open to widespread press coverage and that produced a result that was timely without being rushed.
Aside: In choosing to return to a quasi-feudal political and economic system that required the mass of the population -- white and black -- to be kept in poverty, the South consigned itself to be an impoverished region for decades. That system was broken by what could be regarded as the Second Reconstruction: Starting with FDR, the federal government deliberately pumped massive subsidies into the Southern economy (military bases, TVA...). This was followed by education reform, voting rights...

So why wasn't this the allegory chosen by Redford et al??

4838383,2,B005MVF65G,"The Conspirator is a star studded period piece concerning the kangaroo court trial of those involved in the Lincoln assassination, specifically the rather thin case against Mary Surratt, played by the usually brilliant Robin Wright. Surratt's son was involved in Booth's numerous revenge plots. Mrs. Surratt owned the boarding house in which the conspirators often met. While there are a number of historical theories and interpretations, the film points out the unconstitutional manner in which the trial was conducted. Historical accuracy or inaccuracy is not my main point of analysis. While obvious characterizations are whole or partially fictitious, the circumstances, Surratt's guilt or innocence and the depth of the pro-Southern conspiracy, are open to historical debate. Therefore, this film is merely an interpretation. However, it is simply flat. Directed by Robert Redford and brimming with talent, it has no logical right to be as lifeless as it felt to me. I can't help but compare it to Spielberg's Lincoln, where political conversation and intrigue is gripping and evocative or Spielberg's earlier historical courtroom drama, Amistad. Compared to those films, the finely crafted sets, costuming, and casting of The Conspirator is dragged down by its lack of passion and its rather drab style. The subject matter is ripe for overblown melodrama or opportunities for taut historical commentary. The Conspirator lands disappointingly in the middle.",1371427200,,1462,5.560538116591928

The courtroom dynamics are nearly identical, with unreliable witnesses that the ""green"" but bright defense lawyer rips apart.  I suppose Redford was interested in transposing the story to an American context to create an allegory that would critique the Bush years and remind us all how willing we were (and still are) to trample the constitution for public appeasement.  So, fine, there is the producer's motivation, but, then it's his job to make the compelling allegory.  Yes, yes, we get it: the bloodlust for revenge, despite the fact that many people of the era HATED Lincoln (I'm not talking about Southerners--Lincoln was barely re-elected). So fine, there you have the making for ample political allegory, but it does not deliver.  It is too indebted to ""Breaker Morant"" and not really willing to break out from under its shadow.  In the end, it is what it is:  a fairly transparent remake of a foreign film.  I didn't think ""Sommersby"" (1993) was that good of a remake either [of ""The Return of Martin Guerre"" (1982)] but by comparison, ""Sommersby"" at least holds it own.  This film does not--sadly. Watch ""Breaker Morant"" instead: that's a hell of a film.",1371340800,,1593,4.947368421052632

4838402,4,B005MVF65G,"Robert Redford's ""The Conspirator"" (2010) is about the only woman to be charged as a co-conspirator in Lincoln's assassination. Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) ran the boarding house where her son, John (Johnny Simmons), regularly met with John Wilkes Booth and others plotting their seditious deeds. Mary Claims she simply ran a boarding house and didn't know what her tenants and their friends were hatching. The young lawyer assigned to defend her, Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy), knows that she probably knew more, but also that there's not enough evidence to convict her and, by extension, execute her.

The film starts with Lincoln's assassination and the search for Booth, but then settles into a courtroom drama. I found the first half engrossing enough for a historical drama, but it was the second half that really hooked me in when I discovered that ""The Conspirator"" wasn't just about the Surratt family. It's just as much about Aiken's determination to do what's right, whatever the cost, and the consequences of this decision.

At only 27 years of age, I'm sure those who assigned Aiken the job of defending Mary Surratt weren't expecting much, especially since he fought for the North and despised the rebellion. He was a puppet expected to just go-through-the-motions of defending Surratt. But, as Aiken discovers that there's really not enough evidence to convict Mary and observes the outright corruption of the prosecution, Aiken understands that there's more than just Mary Surratt's life at stake. If she could be railroaded and executed so easily in the land of the free, anyone could.

But there's a hefty price for doing what's right if it goes against the grain of popular opinion.

Alexis Bledel also stars as Aiken's woman and Evan Rachel Wood as Mary's daughter, both excellent.

The film was shot in Georgia and runs 122 minutes.

FINAL SAY: ""The Conspirator"" does exactly what a good historical drama should do -- it takes the viewer back into the historical world of the characters and does it effectively and realistically. It also prompts you to look into the facts of the real-life events afterward. Even more, the potent subtexts are driven home.

The story is about a women who happened to be running a boarding house that John Wilkes Booth visited and as the story suggests conspired against Lincoln and the government of the north along with her son. When Lincoln was assassinated they came after her because they felt she had been party to the conspiracy. She was likely shielding her son's possible involvement but the story is about the court case that came about and the lawyer that was assigned to defend her. Interesting story.

The acting was very good, and the numerous villains played their parts well.

Got me researching more about the Surratt clan and Frederick Aiken's (Mary's overmatched lawyer's) life post-trial. I'll watch anything Redford is involved in, and this was good, not great as a piece of acting and a piece of storytelling.

But I thought Robin Wright did an excellent job showing layers of the main character, Mary Surratt, so that you really weren't sure whether she had anything to do with the plot or not.  Clearly, the underlying theme of the film was the willingness and tendency for our government to disregard the Constitution and its protections in the name of public safety, and the film had clear parallels to Guantanamo.  James McAvoy was very believable as the reluctant defense attorney,although I wish just once the character would have (rightly) pointed out that all of the accused deserved a fair trial and skilled representation, instead of letting people get away with cutting him for representing Mary. I suspect the actual historical person would have done so.

In the end, I learned a lot about the aftermath of Lincoln's assassination that I hadn't known before, even if the ""bad"" characters (the army officers and the sec of defense, for example), tended to veer into mustache twirling villain territory from time to time.",1361577600,,1187,4.97979797979798

4838455,5,B005MVF65G,"The assassination of Abraham Lincoln at the end of our Civil War was probably one of the most emotionally and politically traumatizing events in our history up to that time. Lincoln, almost universally considered our best and most effective president, had led the country through the War; and Lee's army had just recently surrendered. In the aftermath of assassination, virtually everyone who had any connection to, or association with, John Wilkes Booth, the primary conspirator, was rounded up and incarcerated. There was a government-directed effort to rush to judgement...to get past the trial; punish the offenders; and return the country to normalcy ASAP. To expedite the trial, a military tribunal was used...the civilian perpetrators were tried in a military court, without benefit of trial by jury. Mary Surratt, who ran the boarding house where the conspirators met, was arrested and charged with conspiracy too and this fine historical drama tells her story. One of the conspirators, still at large, was her son, John, and the thinking was that charging and trying his mother would flush him out. It didn't, John Surratt was tried by jury a year later and walked. This is the first film produced by the American Film Company, which was founded on the noble belief that historical films are more compelling than fiction. It was masterfully crafted by Robert Redford behind the camera and features superb performances by Robin Wright as Mary Surratt; and James McAvoy, as her defense lawyer, Frederick Aiken. Evan Rachel Wood, Alexis Bledel, Tom Wilkinson and Kevin Kline deliver fine performances too in support roles. Hopefully this is just the first of other films of this nature to be produced during the sesquicentennial anniversary years of the Civil War. This one carries my highest recommendation.",1360972800,,1814,5.215753424657534

4838458,3,B005MVF65G,"""The Conspirator"" is the first film produced by American Film Company established in 2008, and if you watch the film's end credits closely (or visit the company's homepage), you know the new studio is primarily interested in making historically accurate films based on American history.

The story itself is an intriguing one. Set in post-Civil War Washington, ""The Conspirator"" is about a young attorney Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy), who reluctantly defends Mary Surratt (Robin Wright), a boarding house owner who was accused of harboring the men responsible for the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.

Directed by Robert Redford, the film spends considerable time following the change that happens in Frederick, from an indifferent and inexperienced young lawyer to a passionate and dedicated one. His transformation is convincing, largely thanks to James McAvoy's effecting performance, but with courtroom drama that often feels rushed, ""The Conspirator"" as a historical drama sometimes seems not really interested in whether Mary is ""guilty"" - legally or morally - or not. Some characters like Frederick's friend Sarah Weston (Alexis Bledel) are flat and one-dimensional, making the main plotline a bit melodramatic at times.

Most viewers will notice the message from the director (whose previous effort was a political drama ""Lions for Lambs""): a message relevant to the present day, especially the post 9/11 political climate. You will not miss the point, and once you get it, there is not much that will make you think.

I really don't know what to say about ""The Conspirator,"" of which fact-based plot is certainly intriguing, but the result is rather dry. The film is not preachy or dull, but I couldn't help feeling there is a better approach to make a more emotionally charged film out of this historical material.",1360540800,,1827,5.289655172413793

What a disservice to our youth that this event, regardless of Mary Surrat's guilt or innocence, will likely stay in the outer fringes of History as most know it.

That said, this is very good film that maybe works because of Redford's style, telling the story of the lone female accused of being part of the conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. Mary Surratt (Robin Wright, in a nicely nuanced performance) ran the boarding house where John Wilkes Booth and his co-conspirators (including Mary's own son) plan Lincoln's (as well as other) assassination, and when her son escapes justice its almost as if the law arrests Mary in his place. She swears she had no knowledge of any of the plans discussed in her own home, and with even her court-appointed attorney (James McAvoy) unsure of what to believe, the case against Mary Surratt heads to trial as he tries to find evidence of her innocence. Not just a courtroom melodrama, the film features some fine performances, and nice suspense as McAvoy pokes around and finds evidence that comes more and more to make him believe Mary may have been set up ... though whether it will help or not, when the powers that be have already tried and convicted Mary in their heads, is a different matter.",1356912000,,1200,4.8019323671497585
4838481,5,B005MVF65G,"I now have seen the movie after leaving a comment a couple of days ago, which I still stand by, because I think conspiracies abound all throughout history and we NEVER get the real or whole truth on the matter. Just like JFK, they pushed the Warren Commission to come up with its report so as to quiet a country, we find the same evidence here in the Lincoln assassination.
I am a Civil War buff and know much more than the lay person on the facts, but I have to say, I knew very little about Mary Surratt then and now even more so after the film.  Robert Redford did a beautiful job recreating the events as best as possible in both look and feel, though no one is 100% on the mark after over a century and a half has gone by.  I have to admit that after I saw the movie, I couldn't get enough to read to see what I could come up with.

I knew little of Mary Surratt and after the movie, I got to know more of her, but still, she had a mysterious way about her. There was one comment in the film where Aiken goes up to Stanton and as I forget his lead in line, but it was to protect Mary, he said, John or Mary, he didn't care as long as he got one of them! Now that should make you ears prick up right away! For the sake of expediency he was willing to sacrifice Mary for her son John so that the trial was over with and the country could move on, which it did. Oddly enough, when John did come back and got arrested, there were NO CHARGES brought against him and he went scott free. Now how could that be if he was the one who was in the middle of the group and was far more guilty than his mother, but it was over with and there was no need to go any further.
I found it odd that the 7 defendants, only 4 were executed and 3 served little time! How could that be? What plagued me throughout the movie is that I could not tell if Mary knew more than she was admitting to. I seem to think that she did not know much more, and if tried by a jury of peers, as she should have been, she would not have been found guilty, let alone hanged! She was a religious woman and more so than people understand. She sent her children to Catholic schools to get the best education and religious training. This does not sound like a revengeful woman who would be in the thick of things in assassinating the President! Mind you, she did know a little more than let on, but it was nothing that would condemn her. She was a very protective mother and she only wanted to make sure that her son would be spared, so she took the fall for him.

There were things that were brought up at the tribunal that in a court of law, would not have been admissible in court. The character backgrounds of the witnesses against her were either extremely flawed, or they out and out lied on the stand. I tend to think that if John Surratt had come back, his mother would have been let off on lesser charges...but it was not to be so and the trial went speedily to its conclusion. It was also odd that they tried all the defendants at the same time.

I think everyone should see this movie, whether interested or not, to see how this happens again and again in our history and how the right of habeous corpous is thrown to the side for a swift resolution and lets the powers that be have their own way with the law. We've seen this right after JFK was assassinated and again soon after 9/11! Is our guaranteed Constitutional rights to be ignored when those in power deem it expedient to do so...and what they think is the best for the country, even though it may be a total lie? I feel this movie is trying to tell us that, from the very first time it happened to the American public.

I can't say for sure, nor can anyone else, just how guilty Mary Surratt was. But I feel she was NOT that guilty to warrant the verdict put upon her and that history has a dark blotch because of it. If she was guilty of anything, it was protecting her son. All this movie did for me was bring up more and more questions on a subject I never thought about...but isn't that a good thing that we should question history as to its motives and try to find out as best we can, why they turned out the way they did? At the end, I felt nothing but pity for Mary, for she was the only one of the 4 that did NOT try and kill anyone and she was even more innocent than the other 3 who escaped without much of a punishment.

All episodes from today's ""war of terror"" as the American government (and others as well) round up the bad guys, or whoever they suspect of being the bad guys.

Well, yes.  But also, according to this Robert Redford -directed first film in the American Film Company production line, the prevailing atmosphere on the Union side, political, legal and military around those who conspired to kill Abraham Lincoln (and Vice-President Johnson and Secretary Of State Seward) along with John Wilkes Booth. The film centers on the pre-trial and trial events of the only woman brought to trial in the conspiracy (it was at her boarding house where conspiracy was advanced), Mary E. Surratt who was tried before a Union Army military commission, and eventually the first woman hanged by the federal government, for her part in the conspiracy.

We all, those of us who revere the historic memory of Abraham Lincoln, are glad, glad as hell that the south and slavery were defeated. We are nevertheless as supporters of democratic rights now (and hopefully back then, as well) concerned about the modern day issues that this film brings out whether we are sympathetic to Mary Surratt's plight (or those of today's political  prisoners).

4838489,5,B005MVF65G,"With the wave of films and books about Lincoln, I was curious about this movie and then saw that Robert Redford directed, so I knew it would be good. He's an excellent director. His movies always entertain and engage me -- they are thoughtful and beautiful and he gets wonderful performances out of excellent actors.
This was no disappointment. I had never heard of Mary Surrat and her fate as an accomplice in the assassination of Lincoln. It's a true story and the movie draws tight the tension between justice and expediency. Expediency wins. The film depicts how the powerful can bend justice and forsake it for what they consider a higher purpose, or, in this case, it's implied, for revenge.
This is a fact of life in any age. I think that's what Redford is saying -- it's in America's dna -- the forsaking of the principles of the Constitutional rights of individuals on the whim of the powerful in certain moments of history. James McAvoy is wonderful as the young lawyer who is at first ordered to defend Mary Suratt, and then embraces his job realizing the hazard and danger for all when the rights of one person are trampled.
Robin Wright is stoic and heroic as Mary Surratt, she nails the character ... beautiful performance.
Kevin Kline disappears into the character of Seward, giving a masterful performance as the secretary of state whose stated motive for railroading Mary is to preserve peace after the civil war and to keep southerners in their place, so to speak.
The cast shines, and the movie is true to period, very enjoyable, and, also, sad, compassionate, and --- warning, another spoiler -- McAvoy's character, after the farce of a ""trial"", left the law and became the first editor of the Washington Post...dedicated to truth as a newspaperman...a noble profession that I hope survives this age!

4838490,4,B005MVF65G,"On the night of 14 April 1865, John Wilkes Booth shot President Lincoln. In addition, the plotters aimed to kill the Vice President and Secretary of State, thus eliminating the next 2 successors. Only Booth succeeded.

Booth and his conspirators met frequently at the boarding house of Mary Surratt. Her son, John, was involved but it's unclear just how much Mary Surratt knew and how much she aided the plot.

This movie depicts the assassination night, and the legal defense of Mary by a reluctant lawyer, Frederick Aiken.
Overall, the movie maintains a good sense of historical accuracy, showing the courtroom scenes which were held as a military tribunal rather than in a civilian court. We have the zealous Aiken being true to the Constitutional rights of the accused and imperial government bureaucrats and big wigs who seem bent on railroading a guilty verdict and influencing the sentence.
One thing I didn't understand is why they portrayed Frederick Aiken and his wife, Sarah Weston as engaged rather than married. They married 8 years before the action in the movie.

The language used seemed to be pointed at current decisions made with respect to the war on terror. In this sense, the producer is making a parallel in the same way that Arthur Miller's Crucible although historically depicting the Salem Witch Trials was a actually a criticism of McCarthyism.

Overall, a good drama with history you won't have to ""unlearn.""",1353715200,,1436,4.99581589958159
4838491,4,B005MVF65G,"First, this is a fine movie.  I liked Robin Wright's restrained acting in the difficult part of Mary Seuratt.  The movie leaves us in doubt about her guilt in the conspiracy to kill Lincoln as it must.

I watched this movie just a few days after seeing Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln.""  During that film Lincoln gives an extended explanation that he freed the slaves during the Civil War as a matter of military necessity even though he was unsure whether the action was constitutional.  He had also suspended the right of habeas corpus during that war.  In The Conspirator Mary Seuratt is denied a civil trial and is tried by the military at the behest of Sec. of War Stanton who states he wants to preserve the newly won peace.  (The Supreme Court later upholds a citizen's right to a civilian trial according to a note at the end of the film). Stanton also works with Pres. Andrew Johnson to deny a writ of habeas corpus submitted by Seuratt's attorney in a last ditch effort to save her from being hanged.

Part of the message from the film is to remind us, particularly after 9/11, that we have this recurring theme in our history of ""bending"" the Constitution when events cause our emotions to run high.  We are reminded that the rights of all citizens are protected in that Constitution.

The sheer blatant manipulation of facts, ideas and witnesses during the trial held is mind boggling; but, was what could be expected in a situation and at that time under those circumstances.  Civilians were rarely tried in military court, although it was done.  I know of another instance where a military court pushed through a similar quick military trial of civilians and had them hung for their ""war crimes"" as Mary Serrot was hung for hers. You feel like you learn a lot about Mary through her attorney, Mr. Aiken as he goes through the process of trying to prove her innocence.

Robin Wright brings a quiet strength to the character of Mary Serrot that is wonderful to watch.  Kevin Kline as Edwin Stanton, Secretary of War is another stellar performance.  Good direction by Robert Redford, once again.  Right on target.

4838508,2,B005MVF65G,"I'm about a third of the way through this (watching it over lunch breaks) and I was just taken up short by the dialogue I just heard; it's literally a paraphrase of the very same lines taken right from the movie ""Breaker Morant.""  The captain has just arrived at the suspects jail cell.  Her exchange with him asking about his experience, all the way up to where he tells her that he only knows what he has read in the papers is line-for-line virtually the same as the exchange between The defense attorney and LT Morant and his men when they first meet in the prison in South Africa.  What a shamelss ripoff of writing!  And from a production backed by Robert Redford?!?  How shameful.  The movie just dropped at least one star.  I will add to this if I find any more sequences that seem to be copied.

...OK, I now watched the first courtroom sequence and the cross examination of the divinity student, the raising of objections by the prosecutor, the ""you are a liar"" outburst from a prisoner, the style of the defense attorney beginning by bumbling and then finishing strong were all extraordinarily similar to the first courtroom sequence in Breaker Morant where Captian Robertson is torn apart. Did the director and write have no decency?  It is such an obvious rip-off of that movie.

...Again when Mary objected to the inkeeper's lying testimony and was told that her objections prejudiced her case, this was almost word for word from Breaker Morant.  The scene where the army captain changes his story and McAvoy is flabbergasted was also very reminiscent of the scene in Breaker Morant where the general refuses to confirm the order to execute prisoners.

Overall, if you were to watch the two movies side by side, you would be struck by the similarities in the courtroom dramas, as well as in some of the other scenes and the overall sequence of the narrative and shots.  Even the times when the court adjourns were similar.  I have never seen such a flagrant copy of a movie's rythm, scenes, dialogue and even shots.  Maybe this happens a lot more than I know, but I'm just shocked that the production designers, writers, director or whoever was responsible for this did not even make an attempt to hide it.  It's remarkable and so very disappointing coming from Robert Redford.  I have such great respect for his lifelong body of work, but this movie has truly changed my perspective.  If he can't make movies any more without copying from someone else (or allowing his staff to do the copying), then perhaps it's time for him to hang it up.  On the other hand, Breaker Morant is a truly excellent army-themed courtroom drama, also based on real events.  It was made in the early 1980's but the production stands very strong even today.  Rent and watch that if you want to see this genre done well. In the end, because of this plageurism-like copying, I had to give the movie 2 stars.  Oh, and Evan Rachel Wood acted terribly, Kevin Kline over-acted his role, McAvoy's wife was just wooden and terrible and many of the other characters were nothing more than characatures.  Even without the copying, this movie is not deserving of more than 3 stars.  The costumes and sets were good though, as was a lot of the cinematography.

4838516,5,B005MVF65G,"Great court-room movies are always about more than just the case.  They are usually an intertwining of multiple stories, all of which affect the case itself.  This can be said of this movie.  The title of the movie refers to Mary Surrat, who was tried and convicted of being part of the conspiracy to kill Abraham Lincoln.  Her case and her defense by Union war hero Frederick Aiken is only one key part of the movie.  Another key part is the internal tension within Mr. Aiken in trying to determine her innocence or guilt, and his conflicts with Mary and her daughter in trying to get them to tell him the truth.  This drama itself rivals that of the courtroom.  Smaller story-lines include the conflicts between Mr. Aiken and his peers, which include his girlfriend, his friends at a local gentleman's club, and the machinations of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.  The movie is anchored by great acting from numerous roles.  Lifelong comic actor Kevin Kline turns in a good performance as Edwin Stanton.  James McAvoy does a wonderful job playing lawyer Frederick Aiken, a character whose internal turmoil is only surpassed by the conflicts he has with those around him.  Probably the best acting is done by the two actresses; Robin Wright playing the ""Conspirator"", and Evan Rachel Wood playing her daughter.  The former sacrifices herself to protect her son, who she knows was intimately involved in a plot to kidnap President Lincoln.  The latter is convinced to turn against her brother to try and save her mother; to no avail.  All told, a great drama set in the aftermath of two of the most important events in US history; the Civil War and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.",1343520000,,1686,4.768965517241379

4838518,5,B005MVF65G,"The movie starts with the assassination of President Lincoln and moves quickly to the trial. This was done so the audience would get a feel about how rushed the trial had become. James McAvoy plays Frederick Aiken, the Union officer forced to defend Mary. He believes she is guilty. Mary (Robin Wright) is a quiet woman who is a solid block of courage. She is a rebel sympathizer. The conspiracy meetings took place at her boarding house. The movie shows her face during the trial with occasional outbursts. This was not the case. Her face was veiled during most of the trial and during the testimony of her daughter Anna. However, no woman in Hollywood wants to play that role, so they had her unveiled.

Robin Wright looked very much like the depiction we have of Mary Surratt. Noticed how the Secretary of Defense took charge of the situation after the assassination and would allow the VP to take over when he said so. The acting was good and the historical dress and background characters seemed to be accurate down to the straw hats worn by the hangmen.

Robert Redford just doesn't choose movies to direct because he thinks they would make good movies. The movies are selected in order to make comparisons to our world today. The question of the legality of the military court for the conspirators is the same legal question that exists today for those at Guantanamo. Just substitute 9-11 for the assassination, and Muslims for confederates. There were threats of biological warfare and ""the world has forever changed."" Mr. Aiken claims how his prisoner is mistreated. It is countered by ""How you forgotten how our people are treated by the rebels?"" Mary is ""Catholic."" She wears black from head to toe. She is said to spit on every Union soldier and wears a bone from a Union soldier around her neck. They demonize and dehumanize her. Sound familiar?

Her's is an interesting story and the debate on her guilt or innocence in the Lincoln Conspiracy will rage on. Certainly her trial was not a high point of American judiciary proceedings. The film is well done and well acted. My only objection is that it borders on the propagandistic in several places, but it stayed close to historical events by and large. Viewers who are just seeking entertainment will be disappointed by ""The Conspirator."" Those who have an interest in history should find it very revealing.

4838521,4,B005MVF65G,"The movie takes place at the end of the American Civil War.  The movie's plot concerns the alleged conspirators of the assanation of President Lincoln.  A young 27 year old US Army captain (James McAvoy) is given the responsibility of defending one of the alleged conspirators , Mary Surratt (Robin Wright).  Mrs. Surratt is a widow who owned a boarding house where John Wilkes Booth and others, including her son conspired to kill Lincoln.  The question posed is: Is Mary also part of the conspiracy?

What I found difficult is the movie takes on a crime suspense feel.  Yet I it loses its suspense for me since I know the eventual outcome of the trial.  What I found fascinating is the overall sentiments of a 1865 post-war American.  The conflict within the young northern attorney who struggles to defend a Southern Catholic and the personal sacrifices he makes to defend the constitutional right to a fair trial.  This theme is that resonates again and again.  It is clear the trial (war tribunal) is a set out to revenge the death of their fallen leader.  But do the ends justify the means?

The movie is nicely staged, with decent quality scenes and acting.  Consumes were nicely done and helped set the era.  The acting is good, better than some but not an Oscar contender.

It allowed one to see the turmoil this Union Soldier, turned lawyer was facing in the hysteria. It shows how easily people will allow themselves to be manipulated by unquestionably believing published newspaper articles about others or incidents. Hopefully we will be evolving out of that stupidity sooner than later.

I do wish there would have been more mention at the beginning or ending of the movie if what happened in the movie was based on fact, transcripts, stories, newspaper articles etc., or if it was mainly fictional.

It is a Historic, True account of what was behind the assination of President Lincoln. The fact that Mary Surrett was not proven guilty, in a Prejudice Court and Environment. The Constitution totally ignored by all those of the Prosecution, the fact that she was guilty before even being tried in a Military Court and not one by her Peers. The Secretary of War only interested in seeing someone ""pay"" for Lincoln's assination, innocent or guilty, man or woman. Others involved in the Conspiracy lied in court, or was not apprehended and got off scott free.  The DVD arrived in very good condition and well packed. Very good job, for the wrapping, sending and condition of items bought, is very important for the consumer. Thank you. I would recommend this movie to anyone who finds interest in our Country's history.
Also, the true feelings of the Americans, both North and South towards one another. Much hurt, pain and grief from all. For the North continued for several decades to punish those who were on the Confederate side of the boundries of this country. They were even denied to have equal representation or anyone representing them in our National Government-Congress or House of Representatives, for a long time after the war ended.

Abraham Lincoln knew the feelings and pain of the Northern and Southern people towards one another. He ""did not"" want the South punished for ""any reason"" after the war ended. He just wanted our country to be reunited, be civil and sypathtic to one another, so as to heal all the wounds from this horrible war. His full intentions was to reunify the United States of America. This is what he was fighting for. To once again see America reunited. But sadly it didn't happen that way, due to his death. This is quite evident and reveals it so much in this movie.
A movie that every school child should see, or even adults, for it is a very sad part of our American Heritage and History. But the TRUTH, it reveals.

Thank you to Robert Redford for bringing this very factual, moving, emotional and Historical movie for all Americans to see and experience. A great job very well done.

I wonder if someday, someone like Mr. Redford, will make a historical movie, based entirely on facts, the truth of the John F. Kennedy Assination? Yes it is out there. For even today they (experts in many different fields) are still researching and revealing what took place. I will never live to see it, but maybe someday the whole truth will come out for Americans to know the Conspiracy that enveloped his murder. LBJ had much to gain by getting rid of the Kennedy Brothers, and he managed it, all within his term as Vice President (to become the new President of the USA) and President then for a second term of office.

4838541,4,B005MVF65G,"I'm not exactly sure what possessed me to rent this but I'm glad I did.
Without giving anything away the whole movie is about Lincoln's assassins.
Primarily about Mary Surratt.
Either you're interested in the time period or you're not.
I found the entire thing fascinating.
I wasn't too sure how historically accurate the movie was so I'm rereading my history books as I write this.
The movie was beautifully directed.
Wonderfully acted.
Pacing, score pretty much everything was excellent.
People may find the whole thing rather dull as I've read in other reviews.
I for one really enjoyed the whole film and found it neither dull nor uninteresting.
A powerful film about a tumultuous time in America.
A must watch for period buffs.
I recommend it.",1324252800,2,748,4.897637795275591

8479843,1,B005MVF65G,Fictional movie about one of the worst moment in our history. Best to show both sides of the story. I saw a bias towards one side. Another propaganda movie against the death penalty? Robert Redford tends to produce in this manner.,1526688000,2,230,4.634146341463414

8479845,5,B005MVF65G,This is one of the most moving movies I have seen. I do not know if it is accurate to all the events and circumstances however the actors are top notch and the directing of the movie couldn't have been better. A story about injustice and how far men in power will go to achieve the goals they see fit. The truth doesn't matter to such men. Their goals must be reached at all costs even to the sacrifice of their own duty to God and country.,1526515200,,440,4.068965517241379

Very well made, great photography, actors and the plot could not be better. 10 stars if it was possible.",1526428800,,266,4.5625
