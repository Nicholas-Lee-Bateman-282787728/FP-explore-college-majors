8464742,5,B005C46SLE,Nice video but wish it had captioning..the echoes are annoying.,1429488000,,63,5.4
8464743,3,B005C46SLE,"If you have problems with motion-sickness, do not watch this video. The camera close-ups are very abrupt and jerky; I was feeling uncomfortable. I wish that Kathy had spent more time describing her fabric choices and techniques and less time on why she chose the subject matter.",1411603200,,278,4.9361702127659575
8464744,3,B005C46SLE,I am glad to have this DVD and did enjoy it but I personally prefer a DVD that is like a hands on workshop.  Kathy shared her quilts and gave a very monotone narrative about them and discussed some of her techniques but it is not like other DVD's that really show you how to do something in more visual details.,1343520000,9,311,4.098360655737705
