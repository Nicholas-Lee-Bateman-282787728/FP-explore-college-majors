7596965,5,B01AAZVX96,"LOVE the series BUT----

There is no listing for a Blu-ray version of season 2 (S1 is gorgeous to watch in Blu-ray)
What gives????

Maybe studio should offer on-demand Blu-ray disks, like is done for DVD's of seasons of Survivor.  They seem to forget most folks have high-def flatscreens now!!",1452902400,15,293,4.82

7596973,5,B01AAZVX96,"Season 2 is even better than the first. The complexities and richness of the story and characters keeps the viewer riveted to the screen. I am astounded at how the series has developed, with characters developing and extraordinary twists and turns in the plot. Although Abe is the main character the rest of the cast are uniformly superb, and Turn is as much their story as his. Some of the scenes are marvelous, such as the primitive submarine or Simcoe's introduction to the Rangers. It is often uncomfortable as viewers find their sympathies shifting and often contradictory. The theme of sons and fathers (not just by blood) is foregrounded in this series and provides one of the many compelling deeper elements of the story. Like a Dickens novel, characters who never meet are yet inextricably entwined with each other.

It is helpful to know something of the history of the period and its aftermath, so that the rejoicing over France joining the war is nuanced by our knowledge that aiding the Americans hastens the financial crisis in France and thus the French Revolution. Similarly, our appreciation of John Andre is tempered by our awareness of what is to come. Turn is a brilliant series, intensified by our knowledge of what was at stake. There are some television series which become classics and I do not doubt that Turn is one of these.",1503532800,,1351,4.823275862068965

7597010,5,B01AAZVX96,So many citizens of this country know only the basics for the Revolutionary War. As the result of viewing Turn I became more intimately involved in learning more the war and its participants. I would recommend not only watching this series but to do more reading about the war. Common people played a very important role especially in the spy ring created by Washington and known as the Culpers. They were humble people and true patriots.,1480982400,2,438,4.776315789473684
7597011,5,B01AAZVX96,"I really love this series.  The acting is first rate and the story line is historical about Washington's spy network during the American Revolution.  Teaching history we do not have a lot of time to spend on things like this which are interesting and I think would motivate students to want to learn more.  I've always enjoyed this time period and George Washington, my top pick for president (right man at right place at right time).  If you have an interest in history, Washington, or just a good story then this series is meant for you.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  It may even make you want to learn more to check to see how accurate it is.",1480982400,5,655,4.46218487394958

Once I actually give the dvds to my brother-in-law, I will find out if the problems mentioned in lower ratings reviews are also a problem with the one I bought.

7597058,4,B01AAZVX96,"TURN's  exaggerated  take  on  the  Rev  War  continues  with a second  season  of  making  up  the  History  as  it  goes  along.  In  some  respects  this  one  is  more  extreme  and  distorted  than  the  first  season.  Claiming  Charles  Lee  to  be part  of  a  conspiracy  to  betray  Washy  is  taking  things a  bit too  far.  Lee  certainly  was a  vainglorious  fool,  and  he  did  shoot  his  mouth  off  with  his  British  captors,  but  to  claim  that  he  deliberately wanted  to walk  the  Continental army  into  an  ambush is  taking  things  too  far!

Lee  wanted  command  for  sure,  and  he  thought  Washy's  Monmouth  battle  plan  faulty  (which  it  was).  His  efforts  to  overtake  Clinton's  rearguard  were  confused  and  half-hearted,  but  not  treasonous.  He  disobeyed  orders  and  had  no  respect  for  his  commander (Washy).

The  series  finally  concludes  with  something resembling a  battle,  although  the  Monmouth we  get  is uninspired  at  best.  Why  not  at least  show  the  retreat  that  Lee's  Avant  Garde  made  and  include  Washy's  great  stage  moment  when  he  rallied  it,  dismissed  Lee  (which  is  shown)  and  the  steadied  the  line  behind  the  usual  fence  ontop  of a  Hill which  was  sufficient  to  slow  Clinton's  riposte.  Cute  little  Major  Andre  while  on  the  staff  did  not  come  up  with  any  battle  winning  strategy  of  course.  The  plan  to  attack  Lee's  bumbling  effort  was  simply  made  on  the  spot  by  Clinton  and  largely  implemented  by  Cornwallis.  If  Washy  had  fought these  two  formidable  adversaries  in  the  open  ground,  rather  than  in  a defensive  position,  the  Continental  army  likely  would  have  been  in  great  peril. Also,  where  was  the  great  Baron  Stueben  and  his  legendary  retraining  of  the  army before  the  campaign!?

 I  like  the  production  value  of  this  series,  and  the  acting  and  plot  are  inspired,  but  surely  this  could  have been  just as  good  a series  w/o  having  to  invent  history  by  distorting  the  roles  of  historical  characters.  John  Graves  Simcoe  was  not  some  crazy  psychopath,  and  Robert  Rogers  was  long  retired  and  not  some  over-weight  Scots  maniac.  TURN  falls  very  much  short  of  being  the  best  portrayal  of  the  Rev  War,  but  it  does  try  hard.  I  shudder  to  think  how  the  History  will  be  tortured  further  in  what  appears  will  be  yet a  third  season!",1465862400,,2516,4.745358090185676
7597059,5,B01AAZVX96,I highly recommend this second season of Turn that shows the further developments of the spies.

7597064,5,B01AAZVX96,"Amazon is right on track with expedience...timing ,,,so good.  Will continue to use.  As far as series ""TURN"": I really admire ACTUAL ACTING!!!  Anyone can act-out current lifestyle, street gang stuff...just go downtown or work in a city office...ugh.  Anyway..for actors WITH COSTUME OF THE TIME PERIOD..actually HAVE TO ACT is most EXCELLENT.  I am very glad there are still series like this.  SIMPKO and Major HOWELL are excellent in their acting...as is EVERYONE...the character SIMPKO is perfectly done...the VOICE, curtly and respectful in one part...then total devious and creepy in the next GOOD JOB!!! And, I support in a small way Williamsburg...KUDOS TO WILLIAMSBURG for allowing some sets to take place there!!!!!

7597102,1,B01AAZVX96,"In between watching Season one of ""Turn: Washington's Spies"" and watching the second season of ""Turn"", I happened to watch two seasons of ""Hell On Wheels""; another historical mini-series that was premiered on AMC before ""Turn"" was aired.  Consequently, when I started season two of ""Turn"", I realized that they were using the same plot line, only this time the historical era was set during the American Revolution rather than the building of the transcontinental railroad, as in ""Hell On Wheels.""  The similar elements of both series, thus far, are the fact that nobody is allowed to be in a fulfilling relationship, there is excessive and gory violence in both series, there is a psychopathic character in both series (in ""Hell On Wheels"" it is the Norwegian Swede and in ""Turn"" it is the British soldier who keeps returning to Seatucket) who actually is right about the lead protagonists and their involvements but has evil methods of dealing with their knowledge, there is an African-American character who can read (reading was a rarity in both eras for all people types), there are frequent references made towards the banal and regarding prostitutes, the music is sometimes time period appropriate and often not from the era for it is as though the producers can't make up their minds about which kind of music they are going to use, there is a general gloom created by a shadowy type of filming or something, and there is a continual feeling that they are about to reveal a deep dark secret that know one knows, but there actually is nothing all that enlightening that is revealed.  Admittedly, both series are compelling in their way and deal with historical eras that aren't covered often on television.  However, this series especially seems to cheapen the historical characters, such as the way they deal with the sculptor, Patience Wright early on.  Usually the rule in historical fiction is to portray the real historical characters as accurately as possible while entertaining events that are rumored to have happened.  But, to actually have them engage in activities that are known not to have happened is considered a severe oversight.  Since I felt while watching this season that I was just watching a repeat of ""Hell On Wheels"" and that wasn't something that appealed to me enough to do, I ended up being unable to finish out the season.  And I won't be watching any more of this show.",1460246400,2,2405,4.877450980392157
7597103,5,B01AAZVX96,I love this series. I'm just disappointed they don't have this on blu-ray.,1459382400,4,74,4.769230769230769
7597104,5,B01AAZVX96,"This is without doubt the best show on TV.  Some people complain because the writers have changed some of the historical narrative, but this is a drama based upon history---not a dry as dust documentary.  And the only reason that the writers have had to add in things like Abe and Anna's love affair is that current audiences will not watch a good show unless there is smut.  The scripts are superb, and they are delivered superbly.  It is such a relief to see a show that is intelligent and thoughtful instead of dumb jock illiterate.  The costumes and historic settings plus the meticulously researched purpose built sets are spectacular.  Even the FX work to recreate the colonial world are extremely well done for a TV series with a limited TV budget.  Overall, this show should really rate 10 Stars.",1459209600,7,804,4.7
7597105,5,B01AAZVX96,"I absolutely LOVE this series....can't say enough good things about it!!! Characters are complex and captivating, and the storylines are exquisitely done! Don't hesitate to buy this one. You will not be disappointed.

***As for the DVD- I got a bit confused with two of the episodes because they were mixed up on the disc, therefore I watched them out of order. I believe they were ""Houses Divided"" and ""Valley Forge""- not sure if it is just my copy or a widespread issue. Loved the series anyway, having already seen it on AMC last summer....can't wait for season 3 on April 25!!!

Also for those of you who are looking for the blu-Ray version, odds are that will come along in time as it did with season 1.",1459036800,10,708,4.5234375

7597108,5,B01AAZVX96,"I got hooked on Season 1 of TURN last Spring via Netflix and my timing was perfect as I finished the final episode of season 1, Season 2 was just starting on AMC. If you thought Season 1 was great (which I did), Season 2 is even more thrilling, more complex, more interesting, and incredible character development. This isn't a military drama, a period piece, or a spy thriller per se. It's a bit of all three and not easily classified. There is a lot of suspense built into S2, which left my heart pounding and on the edge of my seat week after week. The great thing about this series, and one season 2 really builds on, is that both sides of the revolution are presented pretty fairly. The hat does tip towards the ""rebels"" of course but the redcoats are presented in sympathetic ways, shown to be human in strengths and flaws, and not the typical corny caricature of a British officer in America. It makes the suspense even more wrenching because you develop strong affinity for both sides of the war thanks to the character development the TURN writers have presented.

As for the DVD, I was very pleased with the extras. If you follow TURN's website, you'll see there's interviews every week with cast and crew insights. All those interviews are presented episode by episode on the DVD, plus 2 great featurettes of The Treacherous Trio (Andre/Shippen/Arnold) and Washington & Billy Lee. There's a decent amount of deleted/extended scenes. I'm only disappointed this didn't come in BluRay format.",1458950400,24,1500,4.7251908396946565

Better to have Season 2 then not at all. Sad that AMC is being so CHEAP!",1458691200,5,367,4.183098591549296
7597111,5,B01AAZVX96,"This is a fun watch and very informative.  Before this show came out I had no knowledge on the spies during the war and it peaked my curiosity to research it.  As far as the events go it had kept pretty true to actual history.  I really enjoyed season 1 but I think season 2 was better.  With this trend season 3 should be better than 2 which is what a show should do, top itself each season.",1456012800,6,392,3.9871794871794872
